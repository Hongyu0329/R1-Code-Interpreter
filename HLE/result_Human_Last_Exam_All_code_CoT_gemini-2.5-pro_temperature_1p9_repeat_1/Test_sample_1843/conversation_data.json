    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ with conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Factorize the conductor N**: First, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$.\n    $N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n2.  **Decomposition of Characters**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1\\chi_2\\chi_3\\chi_4\\chi_5$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo the corresponding prime power factor of $N$ ($p_i^{a_i}$).\n    -   $\\chi_1$: primitive character modulo $2^2=4$.\n    -   $\\chi_2$: primitive character modulo $3^2=9$.\n    -   $\\chi_3$: primitive character modulo $7$.\n    -   $\\chi_4$: primitive character modulo $11$.\n    -   $\\chi_5$: primitive character modulo $13$.\n\n3.  **Order of a Character**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$. We need this to be exactly 6.\n\n4.  **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: We can find the number of characters of order 6 using the inclusion-exclusion principle on the lattice of divisors of 6. Let $C(k)$ be the number of primitive characters with conductor $N$ and order exactly $k$. Let $\\mathcal{N}_d(N)$ be the number of primitive characters with conductor $N$ whose order divides $d$. The number of characters of order 6 is given by:\n    $C(6) = \\mathcal{N}_6(N) - \\mathcal{N}_3(N) - \\mathcal{N}_2(N) + \\mathcal{N}_1(N)$.\n\n5.  **Multiplicative Property**: The function $\\mathcal{N}_d(N)$ is multiplicative with respect to the prime power factors of $N$. So, $\\mathcal{N}_d(N) = \\prod_i \\mathcal{N}_d(p_i^{a_i})$, where $\\mathcal{N}_d(p^a)$ is the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ whose order divides $d$.\n\n6.  **Calculate $\\mathcal{N}_d(p^a)$ for each factor**: We will write a Python script to calculate $\\mathcal{N}_d(p^a)$ for each prime power factor of $N$ and for each divisor $d$ of 6 (i.e., $d=1, 2, 3, 6$).\n    -   For a prime modulus $p$, a character is primitive if it's non-trivial. $\\mathcal{N}_d(p)$ is the number of non-trivial characters whose order divides $\\gcd(d, p-1)$.\n    -   For $p^a$ with $a>1$, the calculation is more involved and depends on the structure of the group of characters modulo $p^a$.\n\n7.  **Combine Results**: Finally, we will multiply the component values to get $\\mathcal{N}_d(N)$ and apply the inclusion-exclusion formula to find the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not hasattr(phi, \"memo\"):\n        phi.memo = {}\n    if n in phi.memo:\n        return phi.memo[n]\n    \n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    phi.memo[n] = result\n    return result\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not hasattr(get_divisors, \"memo\"):\n        get_divisors.memo = {}\n    if n in get_divisors.memo:\n        return get_divisors.memo[n]\n        \n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    get_divisors.memo[n] = sorted(list(divs))\n    return get_divisors.memo[n]\n\ndef count_prim_chars_order_divides_d(p, a, d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of primitive characters modulo p^a whose order divides d.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For prime modulus p, primitive characters are the non-trivial ones.\n    # The group of characters is cyclic of order p-1.\n    if a == 1:\n        if p == 2: # Mod 2, only trivial char (conductor 1), so no primitive chars.\n            return 0\n        group_order = p - 1\n        common_order_divs = math.gcd(d, group_order)\n        divs = get_divisors(common_order_divs)\n        count = 0\n        for k in divs:\n            if k > 1:  # Order > 1 for non-trivial characters\n                count += phi(k)\n        return count\n\n    # For modulus p^a, a > 1\n    if p == 2:\n        if a == 2: # Mod 4, one primitive character of order 2.\n            return 1 if d % 2 == 0 else 0\n        else: # Mod 2^a for a >= 3 not needed for this problem.\n            raise ValueError(f\"Case p=2, a={a} is not handled.\")\n            \n    # For odd prime p, a >= 2.
