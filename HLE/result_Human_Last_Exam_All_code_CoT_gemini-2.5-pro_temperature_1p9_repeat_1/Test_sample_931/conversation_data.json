    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  I will first determine the known diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) by consulting established entomological knowledge.\n2.  I will evaluate each answer choice based on these facts. Adult snakeflies are known predators of small, soft-bodied insects like aphids, but they also supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.\n3.  I will identify which of the single choices (A-E) are correct. Based on my knowledge, 'Nectar' (A) and 'Totara Aphids' (E) are both correct food sources.\n4.  Since two options are correct, the most accurate answer will be the one that combines them. Choice F represents 'A and E'.\n5.  I will then write a Python script that programmatically represents this deductive process. The script will:\n    *   Define the choices and their factual accuracy.\n    *   Print the step-by-step analysis of each potential food source.\n    *   Construct a final \"equation\" that shows how the correct individual answers combine to form the final, most complete choice.\n    *   Print the final answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans to determine the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the potential food sources and their validity based on biological facts.\n    # Adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) are primarily predators but also feed on nectar.\n    food_sources = {\n        'A': {'name': 'Nectar', 'is_correct': True},\n        'B': {'name': 'Māhoe pollen', 'is_correct': False}, # They eat pollen, but this specific type is a distractor; not their primary or defining food.\n        'C': {'name': 'Fungus', 'is_correct': False}, # They are not fungivores.\n        'D': {'name': 'Karamū leaf tissue', 'is_correct': False}, # They are not herbivores.\n        'E': {'name': 'Totara Aphids', 'is_correct': True}, # Aphids are a classic prey item.\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Print the analysis for each individual food source.\n    print(\"Evaluating known food sources for adult Raphidiopterans:\")\n    correct_options = []\n    for key, data in food_sources.items():\n        if data['is_correct']:\n            print(f\"- Verdict for Option {key} ({data['name']}): CORRECT.

We'll represent the options as the \"numbers\".\n    print(f\"({food_sources[component_1_key]['name']}) + ({food_sources[component_2_key]['name']}) = Option {final_answer_key}\")\n\nsolve_raphidioptera_diet()\n\n<<<F>>>\n```"
