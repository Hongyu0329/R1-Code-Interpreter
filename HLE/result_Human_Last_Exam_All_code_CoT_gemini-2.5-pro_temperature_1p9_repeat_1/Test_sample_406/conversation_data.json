    "Of course, I can help with that. The existence of a \"tripled fixed point\" is typically guaranteed by a generalization of the famous Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to a system of three equations.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to derive and present the conditions:\n1.  **Define the Problem**: First, we will correctly interpret the functions and define what a \"tripled fixed point\" means in this context. Based on your notation, we will assume the second function `G` was intended to be `H`. The function signatures are slightly unusual (`G: Y*X*Y → Y`), but we can work with them.\n2.  **Use a Standard Technique**: We will define a single mapping `T` on the combined product space `M = X × Y × Z`. A tripled fixed point of `(F, G, H)` is then simply a standard fixed point of this combined mapping `T`.\n3.  **Apply Banach's Fixed-Point Theorem**: The theorem states that if `M` is a complete metric space and `T` is a contraction mapping on `M`, then `T` has a unique fixed point.\n4.  **Derive the Conditions**: We will translate the condition that `T` is a contraction into specific conditions on the functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. This will result in a set of inequalities that their contraction coefficients must satisfy.\n5.  **Present in Code**: I will write a Python script that uses `print()` statements to clearly output all these steps, definitions, and the final derived conditions.\n\nHere is the Python code that explains and presents the final conditions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_conditions_for_tripled_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and prints the conditions for the existence of an\n    FGH-tripled fixed point based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied\n    to a product space.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We need to handle unicode characters for mathematical symbols\n    if sys.stdout.encoding != 'UTF-8':\n        sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='UTF-8')\n\n    print(\"--- Conditions for an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point ---\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Define the Mathematical Setup\")\n    print(\"Let (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) be metric spaces.\")\n    print(\"Let the functions F, G, and H be defined as follows (correcting the second 'G' to 'H'):\")\n    print(\"  F: X × Y × Z → X\")\n    print(\"  G: Y × X × Y → Y\")\n    print(\"  H: Z × Y × X → Z\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Define the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\")\n    print(\"A point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the system of equations:\")\n    print(\"  x = F(x, y, z)\")\n    print(\"  y = G(y, x, y)\")\n    print(\"  z = H(z, y, x)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Define a Single Mapping on the Product Space\")\n    print(\"We can combine these into a single mapping T on the product space M = X × Y × Z.\")\n    print(\"Define the metric d_M on M as: d_M((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂).\")\n    print(\"Define the mapping T: M → M as:\")\n    print(\"  T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))\")\n    print(\"A fixed point of T, where T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z), is precisely an FGH-tripled fixed point.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem\")\n    print(\"The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that if T is a contraction on a complete metric space M, it has a unique fixed point.\")\n    print(\"This leads to the following conditions:\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- DERIVED CONDITIONS ---\")\n    print(\"\\nCONDITION A: Completeness\")\n    print(\"The metric spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nCONDITION B: Individual Contraction Inequalities\")\n    print(\"There must exist non-negative constants (k₁, k₂, k₃, l₁, l₂, l₃, m₁, m₂, m₃) such that for all x₁,x₂ ∈ X, y₁,y₂ ∈ Y, z₁,z₂ ∈ Z:\")\n    print(\"  1. d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂))  ≤  k₁·d_X(x₁, x₂) + k₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + k₃·d_Z(z₁, z₂)\")\n    print(\"  2. d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y'₁), G(y₂, x₂, y'₂))  ≤  l₁·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + l₂·d_X(x₁, x₂) + l₃·d_Y(y'₁, y'₂)\")\n    print(\"  3. d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂))  ≤  m₁·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + m₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + m₃·d_X(x₁, x₂)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nCONDITION C: Combined Contraction Condition\")\n    print(\"To ensure the overall mapping T is a contraction, the sum of coefficients affecting each component metric must be less than 1.\")\n    print(\"The sufficient condition is that the maximum of these sums is less than 1.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the condition is:\")\n    print(\"  max(k₁ + l₂ + m₃,  k₂ + l₁ + l₃ + m₂,  k₃ + m₁)  <  1\")\n    print(\"\\nIf all three conditions (A, B, C) are met, a unique FGH-tripled fixed point exists.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    get_conditions_for_tripled_fixed_point()\n```\n<<<Assuming (X,d_X), (Y,d_Y), and (Z,d_Z) are complete metric spaces and F, G, H satisfy the contraction inequalities `d_X(F(..),F(..)) ≤ k₁d_X+k₂d_Y+k₃d_Z`, `d_Y(G(..),G(..)) ≤ l₁d_Y+l₂d_X+l₃d_Y`, and `d_Z(H(..),H(..)) ≤ m₁d_Z+m₂d_Y+m₃d_X` for non-negative constants, a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist if `max(k₁ + l₂ + m₃, k₂ + l₁ + l₃ + m₂, k₃ + m₁) < 1`.>>>"
