    "My plan is to scan the Latin hexameter line by determining the quantity (long or short) of each syllable and then grouping them into feet.\n\n### Step-by-step Scansion:\n\n1.  **The Line**: `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n2.  **Vowel Quantities & Knowns**:\n    *   `vērum`: Long 'e' by nature.\n    *   `ŭbĭ`: Both vowels are short.\n    *   `ĕquī`: Genitive singular has a short 'e' and long 'i'. However, for the line to scan, the initial 'e' must be treated as long (`ē`) as a form of poetic license (*metri causa*). Thus, `ēquī` gives two long syllables.\n    *   `atque`: Long 'a' by position (followed by 't' and 'q').\n    *   `hŏmĭnis`: All vowels are short.\n    *   `cāsū`: Ablative case has a long 'a' and long 'u'.\n    *   `convĕnit`: Present tense form. `con-` is long by position. `-vĕ-` is short. `-nĭt` is short.\n    *   `ĭmāgō`: The 'i' is naturally short, but to fit the meter, it is likely lengthened (*metri causa*). The 'a' and 'o' are long. We will scan it as `īmāgō`.\n3.  **Elisions**: An elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel (or -m) is followed by a word beginning with a vowel (or h-).\n    *   `verum ubi` -> `ver(um) ubi`\n    *   `atque hominis` -> `atqu(e) hominis`\n4.  **Foot-by-Foot Analysis**:\n\n    *   **Foot 1**: `verum ubi` -> Elides to `vēr(um) ŭbĭ`. The syllables are `vēr` (long), `ŭ` (short), `bĭ` (short). This forms a **Dactyl (D)**.\n        `— ◡ ◡`\n\n    *   **Foot 2**: `equi` -> Scanned as `ēquī`. The syllables are `ē` (long) and `quī` (long). This forms a **Spondee (S)**.\n        `— —`\n\n    *   **Foot 3**: `atque hominis` -> Elides to `atqu(e) hŏmĭnis`. The syllables for this foot are `atqu` (long by position), `hŏ` (short), `mĭ` (short). This forms a **Dactyl (D)**.\n        `— ◡ ◡`\n\n    *   **Foot 4**: `nis casu` -> The remaining syllable `-nis` from `hominis` is long by position (followed by `n`, `s`, and `c-`). The first syllable `cā-` from `cāsū` is long. This forms a **Spondee (S)**.\n        `— —`\n\n    *   **Foot 5**: `-su convenit` -> The second syllable `-sū` from `cāsū` is long. The word `convĕnit` provides the next two short syllables `-vĕ-` and `-nĭt-`. The syllable `cŏn-` gets absorbed into the previous foot's beat, or more accurately, the foot division happens after `cāsū`. The foot starts with `cŏnvĕnĭt`. The syllables are `cŏn` (long), `vĕ` (short), `nĭt` (short). This forms a **Dactyl (D)**.\n        `— ◡ ◡`\n\n    *   **Foot 6**: `imago` -> Scanned as `īmāgō`. The syllables `ī` and `mā` are both long. The last syllable is anceps (can be long or short) but completes the spondaic foot. This forms a **Spondee (S)**.\n        `— —`\n\n5.  **Final Pattern**: D S D S D S\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the provided Latin hexameter line and prints the result.\n    The scansion is determined through linguistic analysis and stored in this function.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    # The scansion pattern derived step-by-step is D S D S D S.\n    # D = Dactyl (long-short-short)\n    # S = Spondee (long-long)\n    scansion = \"D S D S D S\"\n\n    print(f\"Latin Line: {line}\")\n    print(f\"Scansion: {scansion}\")\n\nscan_hexameter()\n```\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
