# --- Step 1: Analyze the given eigenvalues ---
lambda_1 = 0.0
lambda_2 = 0.0
lambda_n = 5.6

print("Step 1: Analyzing the Laplacian eigenvalues.")
print(f"The first eigenvalue lambda_1 is {lambda_1}.")
print(f"The second eigenvalue lambda_2 is {lambda_2}.")
print("The multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 in a graph Laplacian is equal to the number of connected components (c).")
print("Since at least two eigenvalues are 0, we know c >= 2.")
print("The phrasing 'the first 2 eigenvalues' implies these are all the zero eigenvalues.")
c = 2
print(f"Therefore, we conclude that the number of connected components is c = {c}.\n")

# --- Step 2: Analyze the information about the incidence matrix B ---
nullity_B_transpose_B = 2

print("Step 2: Analyzing the incidence matrix information.")
print(f"We are given that null(B_transpose * B) = {nullity_B_transpose_B}.")
print("This is equivalent to the nullity of the incidence matrix B itself, null(B).")
print("The nullity of B is the graph's cyclomatic number (beta_1), which measures the number of independent cycles.")
print("The formula for the cyclomatic number is: beta_1 = m - n + c, where m is edges, n is vertices, c is components.")
print(f"So, we have the equation: m - n + c = {nullity_B_transpose_B}.\n")

# --- Step 3: Synthesize and Conclude ---
print("Step 3: Combining the two pieces of information.")
print("From Step 1, we have c = 2.")
print("Substituting c into the equation from Step 2 gives us a consistency check:")
# We can't know m and n, but we can print the structure of the equation.
# The following f-string demonstrates the substitution of c = 2 into the equation m - n + c = 2.
print(f"m - n + {c} = {nullity_B_transpose_B}")
print("This simplifies to m - n = 0, which means m = n.")
print("A graph with 2 components and m=n is valid (e.g., two separate cycle graphs).\n")

# --- Step 4: Final Conclusion ---
print("Conclusion: The most reliable deduction is that the graph has exactly two connected components.")
print("This corresponds to answer choice B.")
