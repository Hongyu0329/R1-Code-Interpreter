# The number of sissone fermes in the Act II Odette variation choreographed by
# Yuri Grigorovich is a set piece of choreography. This script presents that number.
# The famous sequence consists of 16 sissone fermes.

# Define the number of sequences of this step. It's performed as one continuous sequence.
num_sequences = 1

# Define the number of sissone fermes performed in that one sequence.
sissones_in_sequence = 16

# Calculate the total.
total_sissones = num_sequences * sissones_in_sequence

# Display the result in the requested equation format.
