    "The number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2 can be determined by classifying the possible geometric configurations of the special fiber in a semi-stable family of curves. This classification was carried out by Namikawa and Ueno. The \"type\" of reduction refers to the topological structure of this fiber, which can be conveniently described by its dual graph. In a dual graph, each vertex represents an irreducible component of the curve, weighted by its genus, and edges represent nodes where components intersect. A loop on a vertex represents a self-intersection (a node on that component).\n\nA curve is \"semi-stable\" if its only singularities are nodes and any smooth rational component (a component of genus 0) intersects the other components in at least two points. For a curve of genus 2, the arithmetic genus of its stable reduction must be 2.\n\nFollowing the classification of the topological types of minimal semi-stable fibers, there are 10 distinct configurations. The Python code below enumerates these 10 types and prints the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_reduction_types():\n    \"\"\"\n    Enumerates and counts the types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # This list describes the 10 types of minimal semi-stable reduction for genus 2 curves,\n    # often represented by their dual graphs.\n    # g(n) denotes a component of genus n.
