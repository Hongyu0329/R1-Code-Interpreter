    # Part (a)
    # The premises g . 1_R = 0 (from the problem statement) and g^2 . 1_R = 1_R (from question a)
    # are contradictory under the standard assumption of an associative action (g^2 . r = g . (g . r)),
    # as this would imply 1_R = g^2 . 1_R = g . (g . 1_R) = g . 0 = 0, which means R is the trivial ring.
    # Additionally, the term "symmetric" is not defined, making the question ambiguous.
    # Therefore, the implication is unlikely to hold.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b)
    # We need to compute x^2 a . 1_R for q = -1.
    # The general formula is: x^j a . r = sum_{k=0 to j} (-1)^k * q^(-k(k-1)/2) * C(j,k,q^-1) * (x.1_R)^(j-k) * (g^k a . r) * (x.1_R)^k
    # Here, j=2, r=1_R, q=-1 (so q^-1 = -1), and w = (x . 1_R).

    # k=0 term: coefficient is (-1)^0 * (-1)^0 = 1. q-binomial C(2,0,-1) is 1.
    # Resulting term is 1 * w^2 * (a . 1_R).
    
    # k=1 term: The q-binomial C(2,1,-1) = (1+(-1)^-1)/(1) = 1 - 1 = 0.
    # So the term for k=1 is 0.

    # k=2 term: coefficient is (-1)^2 * (-1)^(-2*(1)/2) = 1 * (-1)^-1 = -1. q-binomial C(2,2,-1) is 1.
    # Resulting term is -1 * (g^2 a . 1_R) * w^2.

    # Summing the terms for j=2:
    w_str_b = "(x . 1_R)"
    term1_b = f"1*(a . 1_R)"
    term2_b = f"1*(g^2 a . 1_R)"
    answer_b = f"{w_str_b}^2 {term1_b} - {term2_b} {w_str_b}^2"

    # Part (c)
    # We need to express x^3 a . 1_R where w = (x . 1_R) is in Z(R).
    # Since w is central, we can factor it out of the sum.
    # x^3 a . 1_R = ( sum_{k=0 to 3} (-1)^k * q^(-k(k-1)/2) * C(3,k,q^-1) * (g^k a . 1_R) ) * w^3

    # k=0: coeff = 1. C(3,0) = 1. Term: 1 * (a . 1_R)
    # k=1: coeff = -1. C(3,1,q^-1) = 1+q^-1+q^-2. Term: -(1+q^-1+q^-2)*(g a . 1_R)
    # k=2: coeff = q^-1. C(3,2,q^-1) = 1+q^-1+q^-2. Term: q^-1(1+q^-1+q^-2)*(g^2 a . 1_R)
    # k=3: coeff = -q^-3. C(3,3) = 1. Term: -q^-3 * (g^3 a . 1_R)

    # Building the expression:
    c_k0 = "1*(a . 1_R)"
    c_k1 = " - (1+q^-1+q^-2)*(g a . 1_R)"
    c_k2 = " + q^-1*(1+q^-1+q^-2)*(g^2 a . 1_R)"
    c_k3 = " - q^-3*(g^3 a . 1_R)"
