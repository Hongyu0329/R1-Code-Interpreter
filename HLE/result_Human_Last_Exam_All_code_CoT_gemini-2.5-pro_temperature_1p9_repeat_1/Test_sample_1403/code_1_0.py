def solve_hat_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the hat puzzle by calculating the guaranteed number of correct guesses
    for two different scenarios and then finding the difference.

    # --- Problem Setup ---
    # Number of individuals in the puzzle.
    num_people = 9
    # The wording "either black and yellow or blue and white" implies two distinct hat types.
    # We will represent them numerically as 0 and 1.
    num_hat_types = 2

    # --- Scenario 1: Simultaneous Guesses (Find N) ---
    # In this scenario, all 9 individuals guess at the same time.
    # The optimal strategy is to partition the group based on a guess about the overall parity
    # (even/odd) of the number of hats of one type.
    # To maximize the guaranteed number of correct guesses, we split the 9 people
    # into two groups with sizes as close as possible.
    group_1_size = num_people // num_hat_types
    group_2_size = num_people - group_1_size

    # The number of people guaranteed to be correct is the size of the smaller group.
    # If the true parity matches Group 1's assumption, group_1_size people are right.
    # If the true parity matches Group 2's assumption, group_2_size people are right.
    # The guaranteed number of correct guesses (N) is the minimum of these two outcomes.
    N = min(group_1_size, group_2_size)

    # --- Scenario 2: One Person Guesses First (Find M) ---
    # In this scenario, one person acts as a "signaler." They guess first.
    # The signaler sees the hats of the other 8 people and uses their guess to
    # signal the parity (even/odd count) of those 8 hats.
    # The signaler's own guess is not guaranteed to be correct.
    # The remaining 8 people hear this signal. Each of them also sees the other 7 hats.
    # Knowing the parity of the full group of 8 (from the signal) and seeing 7 of the hats
    # allows each person to deduce their own hat with certainty.
    # Therefore, all remaining (num_people - 1) individuals are guaranteed to be correct.
    M = num_people - 1

    # --- Final Calculation (M - N) ---
    difference = M - N
