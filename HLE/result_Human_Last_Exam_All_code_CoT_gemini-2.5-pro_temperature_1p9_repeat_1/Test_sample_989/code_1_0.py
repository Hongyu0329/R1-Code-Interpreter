    print("\n[A] 'Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class'")
    print("Analysis: This is TRUE. The SVM decision boundary is defined by the margin between classes. This margin is determined by the support vectors, which are the closest points from *each* class to the hyperplane. Without support vectors from both classes, the optimization problem is ill-defined.")

    print("\n[B] 'With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM'")
    print("Analysis: This is TRUE. By assigning different penalty weights (the 'C' parameter) to different classes, an SVM can be trained to be more sensitive to the minority class. This results in an 'unequal margin' and is often the optimal approach for imbalanced datasets.")

    print("\n[C] 'Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels'")
    print("Analysis: This is TRUE. This is the 'kernel trick'. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, for example, corresponds to a mapping to an infinite-dimensional space. The kernel function computes dot products in this space efficiently without explicitly transforming the data, making the problem computationally tractable.")

    print("\n[D] 'It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points'")
    print("Analysis: This is TRUE. The SVM decision boundary is determined exclusively by the support vectors (points on or inside the margin). Points correctly classified and far from the boundary ('interior points') have no impact on its position. Adding or moving these points won't change the boundary unless they become support vectors.")

    print("\n[E] 'Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer'")
    print("Analysis: This is NOT TRUE. This statement is too strong. While it is true that IF a strictly convex function has a global minimum, that minimum is unique, the function is not guaranteed to have a minimum. A counterexample is f(x) = e^x, which is strictly convex but has no minimum value; it only approaches an infimum of 0.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Statements A, B, C, and D are true regarding SVMs and the principles they use.")
    print("Statement E is a false mathematical generalization.")
    print("Therefore, the statement that is not true is E.")
