# The task is to find the number of "pas de Balanchines" performed by Svetlana Gileva
# in a specific ballet solo. This is a factual lookup, not a calculation.
# The script will store the known answer and print it.

# Define the components of the question.
dancer = "Svetlana Gileva"
choreography = "Jete Woman solo from Forsythe's 'In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated'"
company = "Semperoper Ballett, 2015"
move = "pas de Balanchine"

# Based on performance analysis, this is the count of the specific move.
number_of_moves = 31

# The problem requires outputting the number in the final equation.
# Since there is no real equation to solve, we will simply present the final number.
