    # Step 1: Define the core of the problem.
    # The question asks for a fundamental limitation of "bulk" experiments, meaning
    # experiments that measure the average properties of a very large number of molecules.
    # This must be a limitation that exists even with perfect equipment ("ideal experimental conditions").
    print("Analyzing the limitations of bulk experiments for NA thermodynamics...")

    # Step 2: Evaluate the provided options.
    print("\nOption A & B: Relate to the 'model', not the 'experiment'.")
    print("Assuming zero heat capacity change (A) or Temperature-independent parameters (B) are simplifications of the NNBP model used to analyze the data, not a limitation of the physical measurement itself.")

    print("\nOption D & E: Relate to 'experimental error', not 'fundamental limitations'.")
    print("Issues like temperature oscillations (D) or lack of temperature control (E) are experimental imperfections. The problem specifies 'ideal experimental conditions', so we disregard these.")

    print("\nOption C: Relates directly to the 'bulk' nature of the measurement.")
    print("A bulk measurement averages the signal across all molecules in the solution. If the sample is 'heterogeneous'—containing a mix of different species (e.g., correctly folded, misfolded, aggregated)—the experiment cannot distinguish them. It only reports the average behavior.")
    print("This 'impossibility to capture heterogeneity' is a fundamental limitation of averaging over a large population.")
