    "To find the number of integers $x$ for which the expression $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square, we need to find the number of integer solutions to the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the polynomial:** We are looking for integer pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation. First, we need to ensure that $P(x) \\ge 0$. We can analyze the roots of $P(x)$ to determine the regions where it is non-negative.\n    By testing values, we find that the roots of $P(x)=0$ are approximately at $x \\approx -8.5$, $x \\approx 7.5$, and $x \\approx 16.5$.\n    Thus, $P(x) \\ge 0$ for integers $x$ in the intervals $[-8, 7]$ and $[17, \\infty)$.\n\n2.  **Bound the search space:** For large values of $x$, it's possible to show that $P(x)$ lies strictly between two consecutive perfect squares, which would mean it cannot be a square itself. However, since $P(x)$ has an odd degree, a more robust method is to analyze the related even-degree polynomial $Q(x) = x P(x)$.\n    Let $Q(x) = xP(x) = x^4 - 16x^3 - 72x^2 + 1056x$. We can bound $Q(x)$ between the squares of two consecutive polynomials in $x$.\n    Consider the polynomials $S_1(x) = x^2 - 8x - 69$ and $S_2(x) = x^2 - 8x - 68$.\n    It can be shown that for $x \\ge 63$:\n    $S_1(x)^2 < Q(x) < S_2(x)^2$\n    This means that for $x \\ge 63$, $Q(x)$ can never be a perfect square.\n\n3.  **Relate $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$:** If $P(x)$ is a perfect square, let's say $P(x) = y^2$, then $Q(x) = xP(x) = xy^2$. For $Q(x)$ to be a perfect square, $x$ must also be a perfect square.\n    However, since we've established that $Q(x)$ is never a perfect square for $x \\ge 63$, it follows that $P(x)$ cannot be a perfect square for any $x \\ge 63$.\n\n4.  **Perform a finite search:** The problem is now reduced to checking a finite set of integers. We need to check the integers $x$ in the determined ranges where $P(x) \\ge 0$ and $x < 63$. These ranges are:\n    *   $x \\in [-8, 7]$\n    *   $x \\in [17, 62]$\n\n5.  **Execute the search:** We can use a Python script to iterate through these ranges, calculate $P(x)$, and check if it's a perfect square.\n\nThe following Python code implements this search.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the number of integers x for which\n    P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056 is a perfect square.\n    \n    The search for x is limited to the ranges [-8, 7] and [17, 62],\n    as explained by the mathematical analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    solutions = []\n    \n    # Define the ranges to check\n    ranges_to_check = [range(-8, 8), range(17, 63)]\n    \n    print(\"Searching for integer solutions x where P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056 is a perfect square...\")\n    print(\"=\"*80)\n    \n    for r in ranges_to_check:\n        for x in r:\n            # Calculate P(x)\n            p_x = x**3 - 16*x**2 - 72*x + 1056\n            \n            # P(x) must be non-negative\n            if p_x >= 0:\n                # Check if it's a perfect square\n                sqrt_px = math.isqrt(p_x)\n                if sqrt_px * sqrt_px == p_x:\n                    solutions.append(x)\n                    # Output the equation for each solution found\n                    print(f\"Found a solution for x = {x}:\")\n                    print(f\"({x})^3 - 16*({x})^2 - 72*({x}) + 1056 = {p_x} = {sqrt_px}^2\")\n                    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"=\"*80)\n    print(f\"Total number of integers found: {len(solutions)}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<3>>>"
