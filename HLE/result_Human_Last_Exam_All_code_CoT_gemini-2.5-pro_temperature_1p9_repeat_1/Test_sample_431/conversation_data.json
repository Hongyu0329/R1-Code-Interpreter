    "To determine the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker of the human GABAAρ1 receptor, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Protein Sequence:** There are multiple isoforms and database entries for the human GABAAρ1 receptor. I will use the NCBI Reference Sequence **NP_002035.1**, which corresponds to Isoform 3 of UniProt entry P24046. This is a well-documented sequence for the GABRR1 gene product.\n2.  **Identify the Linker Domain Boundaries:** I will use the domain annotations provided by the NCBI entry for NP_002035.1.\n    *   Transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) is annotated at residues 297-317.\n    *   Transmembrane domain 4 (TM4) is annotated at residues 429-449.\n    *   Therefore, the intracellular linker connecting them spans from residue **318 to 428**.\n3.  **Extract the Linker Sequence:** I will write a Python script to store the full protein sequence and extract the specific sequence for the linker domain (residues 318-428).\n4.  **Count Cysteine Residues:** The script will then iterate through the extracted linker sequence to find and count all occurrences of the Cysteine residue, represented by the single-letter code 'C'. The script will also identify the exact position of each Cysteine in the full-length protein.\n5.  **Output the Result:** The final script will print the total count of Cysteine residues found in the specified linker domain, along with their positions in the protein sequence.\n\n```python\ndef count_cysteine_in_linker():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker\n    of the human GABAArho1 receptor (NCBI RefSeq NP_002035.1).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
