def print_checkmate_sequence():
    """
    This function prints the move sequence for the forced checkmate.

    The chosen sequence is based on a classic pattern known as Philidor's Legacy.
    It begins with 1... Nf2+, which forces a checkmate in a few moves.

    Note: The move 4. Rxg1 in the provided option is illegal based on the board state.
    The only legal move for White is 4. Kxg1, after which 4... Nf2# is checkmate.
    We will print the sequence as given in the selected answer choice.
