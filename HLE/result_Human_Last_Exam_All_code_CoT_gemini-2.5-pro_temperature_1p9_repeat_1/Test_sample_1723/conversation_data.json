    "This is a classic mycology question. While the idea of a distinctly \"blue spore print\" is a common point of confusion, there is a specific genus renowned for a unique blue characteristic. The question likely refers to the production of blue latex or \"milk\" when the mushroom is cut, as no genus is known to produce a truly blue spore deposit. I will provide the name of this genus.\n\nI will write a simple Python script to store the name of the genus in a variable and then print it out in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mushroom_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the trivia question about the mushroom genus\n    known for a distinct blue characteristic.\n\n    While the question mentions a \"blue spore print\", this is a common misnomer.\n    The famous characteristic is actually the production of blue latex (milk)\n    when the mushroom is damaged. The genus known for this is Lactarius.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The name of the genus known for its blue-latex-producing species.\n    genus_name = \"Lactarius\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a clear statement.\n    print(f\"The genus of mushroom known for producing a distinctly blue latex (often mistaken for a blue spore print) is: {genus_name}\")\n\nsolve_mushroom_trivia()\n```\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
