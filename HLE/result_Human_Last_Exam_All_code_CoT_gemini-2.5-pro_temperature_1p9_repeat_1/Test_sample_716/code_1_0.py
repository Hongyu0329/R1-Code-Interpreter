    Calculates and explains the Hausdorff dimension of the given curve.

    The curve is defined by:
    x(t) = sin(pi * t)
    y(t) = sin(t)
    z(t) = cos(2t)

    This is a mathematical problem that can be solved analytically. The code

    # Step 1: Analyze the curve's properties.
    # The curve is the image of the map r(t) from R to R^3.
    # The functions x(t), y(t), and z(t) are all continuously differentiable (C^1).

    # Step 2: Establish a lower bound for the dimension.
    # The Hausdorff dimension of a set is not decreased by a projection map.
    # Let's project the curve onto the y-axis. The image of this projection is
    # the set of all possible values of y(t) = sin(t), which is the closed
    # interval [-1, 1].
    
    # The Hausdorff dimension of an interval [a, b] is 1.

    # So, dim_H(Curve) >= dim_H([-1, 1]) = 1.
    
    # Step 3: Establish an upper bound for the dimension.
    # A key property is that for a Lipschitz continuous map f: A -> B,
    # we have dim_H(f(A)) <= dim_H(A).
    
    # Our map r(t) is C^1, which implies it is locally Lipschitz. This means
    # on any finite interval [a, b], the map is Lipschitz.
    # The domain is the real line R, which can be seen as a countable union
    # of intervals like [n, n+1] for integer n.
    # The Hausdorff dimension of each interval [n, n+1] is 1.
    
    # Because the map is Lipschitz on each interval, the dimension of the
    # image of each interval is at most 1.
    # The entire curve is a countable union of these pieces, and the dimension
    # of a countable union of sets is the supremum of their dimensions.
    # Therefore, the dimension of the whole curve is at most 1.
    upper_bound = 1

    # Step 4: Conclude the dimension.
    # From our analysis, we have:
    # lower_bound <= dim_H(Curve) <= upper_bound
    # 1 <= dim_H(Curve) <= 1
