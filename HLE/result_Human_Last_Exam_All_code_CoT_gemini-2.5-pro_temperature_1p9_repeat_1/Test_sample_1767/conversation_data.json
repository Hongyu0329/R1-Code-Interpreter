    "Of course. Here is the thinking process and the final python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the core physical principle:** The question asks for the Chern number of a combined system made of two Chern insulators. The key principle here is the additivity of topological invariants, specifically the Chern number. When two topological systems are combined (stacked or joined laterally) and they are non-interacting or weakly coupled, the Chern number of the composite system is simply the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n2.  **Define the given values:** We are given two insulators, each with a Chern number of 1.\n    *   C₁ = 1\n    *   C₂ = 1\n3.  **Apply the principle:** The total Chern number, C_total, will be the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n    *   C_total = C₁ + C₂\n4.  **Calculate the result:**\n    *   C_total = 1 + 1 = 2\n5.  **Construct the Python code:** The code will define the initial Chern numbers, perform the addition, and print out an explanation along with the final equation and result, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of a 2D material.\n# For non-interacting or weakly coupled systems, the Chern number is an additive quantity.\n# When two systems are brought together to form a junction, the Chern number of the\n# combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n# Define the Chern numbers of the two insulators.\nc1 = 1\nc2 = 1\n\n# Calculate the Chern number of the junction.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the explanation and the result.\nprint(\"Principle: The Chern number of a combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers of its individual components.\")\nprint(f\"Chern number of the first insulator (C1): {c1}\")\nprint(f\"Chern number of the second insulator (C2): {c2}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe Chern number of the junction (C_total) is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, the Chern number of the junction is {c_total}.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
