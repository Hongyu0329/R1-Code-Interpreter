Thinking Process:

1.  Assigning FTIR Peaks to Structures:
    -   ~1652 cm^-1: Corresponds to Alpha-helix structures.
    -   ~1618 cm^-1: Corresponds to the strong band of Beta-sheet structures.
    -   ~1680 cm^-1: Corresponds to the weak band of anti-parallel Beta-sheet structures.
    -   ~1645 cm^-1 (broad): Corresponds to Disordered/Random Coil structures.

2.  Analyzing the Concentration Titration (Gelation):
    The problem states that upon increasing concentration, which induces gelation, there is an increase in peaks at both 1652 cm^-1 and 1618 cm^-1.
    -   The increase at 1652 cm^-1 indicates the FORMATION of Alpha-helices.
    -   The increase at 1618 cm^-1 indicates the FORMATION of Beta-sheets.
    -   This shows that the gelation process involves the folding of proteins from a less ordered state into both of these ordered structures.

3.  Analyzing the Heating Experiment (De-gelation):
    -   Upon heating, the gel breaks down.
    -   The peaks at 1618 cm^-1 and 1680 cm^-1 (Beta-sheets) disappear. This means the beta-sheet structure is essential for the gel but is thermally unstable.
    -   The peak at 1645 cm^-1 (Disordered) grows stronger. This confirms that the ordered structures are unfolding back into a disordered state.

4.  Conclusion:
    The proteins start as disordered. Upon gelation (via concentration), they fold into a mixture of alpha-helices (increase at 1652 cm^-1) and beta-sheets (increase at 1618 cm^-1). Heating reverses this process. Therefore, the best explanation is that disordered structures fold into both beta-sheets and alpha-helices during gelation.

This matches answer choice I.
