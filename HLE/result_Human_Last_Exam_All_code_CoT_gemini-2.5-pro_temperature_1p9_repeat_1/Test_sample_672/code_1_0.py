# The user wants python code that solves the problem and prints the output.
# The task is to perform scansion on the line:
# "And in the letter, my cousin mentions a piece of advice"
# The notation should be "/" for stressed syllables and "x" for unstressed syllables, with no spaces.

# Let's break down the line syllable by syllable and determine the stress.
# And (x) in (x) the (x) let(/)ter(x), my(x) cou(/)sin(x) men(/)tions(x) a(x) piece(/) of(x) ad(x)vice(/)

scansion = "xxx/xx/x/xx/x/x/"

# The problem states "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# This instruction seems to be a template error from a previous math-related task.
# I will interpret it as a requirement to be very clear and explicit about the output.
# Since there is no equation, I will simply print the final scansion string.
# A direct print is the cleanest way to follow the user's instructions.
print(scansion)
