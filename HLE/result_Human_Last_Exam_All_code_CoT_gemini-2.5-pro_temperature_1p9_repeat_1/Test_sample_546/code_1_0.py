# The problem simplifies to calculating 2**81 based on number theory arguments
# which are independent of the specific large value of p, given the primality conditions.

# The function f(p) simplifies to a constant value.
# f(p) = 2^81 mod N
# Since 2^81 is smaller than N (which is a very large number dependent on p),
# the result is simply 2^81.

final_value = 2**81

# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The simplified final equation is f(p) = 2^81.
# I will print the value of 2^81.
