def solve_set_theory_question():
    """
    This function analyzes the relationship between an inaccessible cardinal and a measurable cardinal
    in ZFC set theory to determine the correct answer.

    The system S is ZFC + "there exists an inaccessible cardinal κ".
    The statement P is "there exists a nontrivial elementary embedding j: V -> M with critical point κ",
    which is equivalent to "κ is a measurable cardinal".

    1. Provability of P in S: The existence of a measurable cardinal is a strictly stronger
       hypothesis than the existence of an inaccessible cardinal. Therefore, S cannot prove P.
       This eliminates option A.

    2. Provability of ¬P in S: It is a theorem that every measurable cardinal is inaccessible.
       Therefore, if we assume P is true (a measurable cardinal κ exists), it follows that S is
       also true (an inaccessible cardinal κ exists). If S could prove ¬P, it would mean that a
       theory (ZFC + measurable) that implies S is inconsistent with S, which is a contradiction.
       Thus, S cannot prove ¬P. This eliminates option B.

    3. Independence: Since S can neither prove P nor ¬P, P is independent of S.
       This supports option C.

    4. Contradiction and Meaninglessness: P is a standard, well-formed large cardinal axiom. It doesn't
       lead to a known contradiction in S (which would imply S proves ¬P) and is perfectly
       meaningful. This eliminates D and E.

    The correct answer is C.
