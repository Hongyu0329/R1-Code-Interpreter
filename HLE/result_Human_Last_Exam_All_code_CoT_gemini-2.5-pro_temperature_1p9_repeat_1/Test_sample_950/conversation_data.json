    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the space**: The space of $k$-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $Gr(k, n)$. For this problem, we are considering the space of $3$-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, which is $Gr(3, 5)$.\n\n2.  **Define the Goal**: We want to compute the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The term \"rank of a torsion group\" here means the number of cyclic summands in its decomposition into primary cyclic groups. For example, the rank of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ is 3.\n\n3.  **Methodology**:\n    a.  We will start with the known structure of the integral homology groups, $H_i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, as computed in algebraic topology literature.\n    b.  We will then use the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT) for cohomology to determine the structure of the integral cohomology groups, $H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The UCT provides a way to compute cohomology from homology. For integer coefficients, the theorem states that for each degree $i$, there's a split short exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to \\text{Ext}(H_{i-1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\text{Hom}(H_i(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$\n    This implies $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_i(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}(H_{i-1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    c.  The $\\text{Hom}(H_i, \\mathbb{Z})$ term corresponds to the free part of the cohomology group $H^i$, while the $\\text{Ext}(H_{i-1}, \\mathbb{Z})$ term corresponds to its torsion part.\n    d.  By summing the ranks of the torsion parts of each cohomology group $H^i$, we find the total rank of the torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring.\n\n4.  **Implementation**:\n    The provided Python code will automate this process.\n    a.  The integral homology groups of $Gr(3, 5)$, taken from established topological computations, are stored in a dictionary. An abelian group like $\\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus \\bigoplus_j \\mathbb{Z}_{m_j}$ is represented as a tuple `(r, [m_j])`.\n    b.  The code calculates each cohomology group $H^i$ using the UCT formula.\n    c.  Finally, it calculates the total rank of the torsion part by summing the number of cyclic components for each degree $i$.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\n    of the Grassmannian manifold Gr(3, 5).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The dimension of the manifold Gr(3, 5) is k(n-k) = 3 * (5-3) = 6.\n    dim = 6\n\n    # The integral homology groups H_i(Gr(3, 5); Z) are known from the literature.\n    # A group G = Z^r + Z_m1 + Z_m2 + ... is represented as a tuple (r, [m1, m2, ...]).\n    # H_i is {0} for i > 6.\n    # Data from Randall, D.
