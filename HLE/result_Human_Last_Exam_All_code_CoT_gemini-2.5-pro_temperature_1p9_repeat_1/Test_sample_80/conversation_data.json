    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Calculate Total Edge Squares:** I will first determine the total number of squares on the edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard. An 8x8 board has 4 sides of 8 squares, but the 4 corner squares are counted twice, so the total is (8 * 4) - 4 = 28.\n2.  **Analyze Bishop Placement:** Bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color. This means we can treat the problem of placing bishops on white squares and black squares as two separate, independent problems.\n3.  **Count Squares by Color:** I will determine the number of white and black squares on the edge. The 28 edge squares are split evenly, resulting in 14 white and 14 black squares.\n4.  **Maximize Bishops per Color:** On the edge, every square of a given color attacks exactly one other edge square of the same color (e.g., the white square a2 attacks b1, corner a8 attacks h1, etc.). This means the squares of each color can be grouped into non-overlapping attacking pairs. For the 14 white squares, there are 7 such pairs. To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, one must place a single bishop in each pair, for a total of 7 bishops on white squares. The same logic applies to the 14 black squares, allowing for 7 more bishops.\n5.  **Calculate Final Answer:** The total number of placed bishops is the sum from both colors (7 + 7 = 14). The number of empty edge squares is the total number of edge squares minus the total number of placed bishops (28 - 14 = 14).\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishop_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on them.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    total_edge_squares = (board_size * 4) - 4\n\n    print(f\"A standard {board_size}x{board_size} chessboard has {total_edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Divide the problem by color.\n    # The edge squares are split evenly between white and black.\n    squares_per_color = total_edge_squares // 2\n    print(f\"These squares are divided into {squares_per_color} white and {squares_per_color} black squares.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the maximum bishops that can be placed.\n    # On the edge, every square of a given color forms an attacking pair with\n    # exactly one other edge square of the same color.\n    # To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we place one per pair.\n    max_bishops_per_color = squares_per_color // 2\n\n    # The total number of bishops is the sum for both colors.\n    total_placed_bishops = max_bishops_per_color * 2\n\n    print(f\"To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, you can place {total_placed_bishops} bishops on the edge.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the number of empty squares.\n    empty_squares = total_edge_squares - total_placed_bishops\n\n    print(\"\\nThe number of edge squares that would lack bishops is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} (total edge squares) - {total_placed_bishops} (placed bishops) = {empty_squares} (empty squares)\")\n\nsolve_bishop_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
