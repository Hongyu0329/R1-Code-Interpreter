    **Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data and Reaction Pathway**

    1.  **Decoding the Final Product's Structure from NMR:**

        The provided spectral data allows us to identify the structural components of the final product:
        - From ¹H NMR:
          - A peak at **1.70 ppm** (singlet, 9H) is the classic signature of a tert-butyl group, -(CH₃)₃, originating from tert-butyl hydrazine.
          - The combination of a triplet at **8.69 ppm** (1H) and a doublet at **4.73 ppm** (2H) indicates a -NH-CH₂- fragment where the NH proton is coupled to the CH₂ protons.
          - A multiplet at **7.37 – 7.22 ppm** integrating to 5H is characteristic of a monosubstituted phenyl group (-C₆H₅).
          - Combining the previous two points reveals a benzylamino group (-NH-CH₂-C₆H₅), which comes from the benzylamine reagent.
          - Two singlets remain at **8.24 ppm** and **8.11 ppm**. Since the benzyl and tert-butyl groups have been accounted for, these must belong to the core structure. The presence of only one or two C-H protons on the core ring is indicated. A structure with a single C-H on a heterocyclic ring and a remaining N-H from the hydrazine linker would perfectly match this observation.

        - From ¹³C NMR:
          - Signals at **59.79 ppm** (quaternary C) and **29.25 ppm** (methyl C) confirm the tert-butyl group.
          - The signal at **43.52 ppm** corresponds to the -CH₂- carbon of the benzyl group.
          - Signals in the range **127-140 ppm** (139.82, 130.16, 128.82, 127.85, 127.35) account for the phenyl carbons.
          - Critically, the product has a highly shielded carbon at **102.23 ppm**. This is typical for a C-H carbon at the C5 position of a pyrimidine ring that has strong electron-donating groups at positions 4 and 6.
          - The three signals at **156.89, 154.96, and 152.80 ppm** are characteristic of the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 of a highly substituted pyrimidine ring.

    2.  **Assembling the Product and Deducing the Starting Material:**

        - The data strongly suggests the final product is a pyrimidine derivative with one C-H left on the ring (at C5). This means positions 2, 4, and 6 are substituted.
        - The substituents are a benzylamino group and a tert-butylhydrazinyl group, added during the two synthetic steps.
        - Since only two reagents were added, one of the original functionalities from Compound A must remain at either C2, C4, or C6. Given that the additions are nucleophilic substitutions, the original groups on Compound A were likely leaving groups, such as halogen atoms. The final product is therefore a 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrimidine.
        - The most logical structure for the product is 2-chloro-4-(2-tert-butylhydrazinyl)-6-(benzylamino)pyrimidine. This fits all the spectral data.
        - To arrive at this product, the starting material, Compound A, must have had three leaving groups at positions 2, 4, and 6. The most common and logical precursor for such a synthesis is 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine.

    **Conclusion:**

    The starting material, Compound A, which is sequentially reacted with tert-butyl hydrazine and then benzylamine to yield a product consistent with the given NMR data, is identified as 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine.
