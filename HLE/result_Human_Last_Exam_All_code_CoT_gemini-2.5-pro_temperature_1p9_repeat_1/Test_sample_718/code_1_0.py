def solve_tame_functor_problem():
    """
    This function explains and solves the problem about the resolvability of a tame functor.

    The question asks for the integer 'n' for which a tame functor on an upper semilattice
    is n-resolvable.

    1.  An n-resolvable functor is one with a projective dimension of at most n.
    2.  An upper semilattice is a specific type of partially ordered set. Functors on it
        correspond to modules over its incidence algebra.
    3.  A "tame functor" generally refers to an indecomposable module that is neither
        preprojective nor preinjective for a tame incidence algebra.
    4.  While for general tame algebras, the projective dimension of such modules can be
        infinite, the specific structure of an upper semilattice imposes strong constraints.
    5.  Deep results in the representation theory of posets show that for this specific
        class of algebras, the projective dimension of such modules is bounded.
    6.  The value for this bound is 2. For instance, minimal non-hereditary finite-type
        lattices (like M3) have a global dimension of 2, and minimal wild upper
        semilattices also have a global dimension of 2. This points to 2 being the
        critical value separating different types of representation behavior.

    Therefore, a tame functor is 2-resolvable. The final equation is n = 2.
