    The final upper bound is constructed as follows:

    Class = {circuit_base}^{depth_exponent_value}

    Where:
      {circuit_base}: Stands for 'Threshold Circuit'. This is derived from the 'saturated'
             nature of the activation functions. 'T' is for Threshold and
             'C' is for Circuit.

      ^{depth_exponent_value}: This number is the exponent on the logarithm of the circuit depth.
             A value of '{depth_exponent_value}' signifies a depth of O((log n)^{depth_exponent_value}),
             or simply O(log n). This depth arises from the inherent
             parallelism in the transformer's matrix multiplication and
             attention mechanisms.

    The fact that the model uses 'float activations' is handled by assuming they can be
    approximated with polynomially many bits of precision without changing the overall class.
    The term 'average-hard-attention' is a specific mechanism, but its computational complexity
    does not exceed that of standard attention in a way that would push it out of this class.
