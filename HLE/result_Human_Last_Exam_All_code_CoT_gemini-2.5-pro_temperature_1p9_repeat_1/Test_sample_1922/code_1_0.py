    print("Step 1: Evaluating the accuracy of each statement.")
    print(" - A is correct. Augustine's strong doctrines on grace and predestination are widely seen as influential on, and similar to, the later theology of John Calvin. This is a common point of discussion.")
    print(" - C is correct. In works like 'On Free Choice of the Will', Augustine treats the 'voluntas' (will) as a central faculty of the human soul or psyche, a concept he developed with an awareness of classical philosophy, including Stoic thought (e.g., Seneca).")
    print(" - D is correct. A hallmark of Augustinian thought is the fusion of faith and reason. Philosophical inquiry, for him, is inseparable from theological premises, especially when discussing topics like 'free will' and divine 'grace.'")
    print(" - E is correct. The scholar Ã‰tienne Gilson argued that for Augustine, grace is efficaciously irresistible but distinguished this from the later, more rigid Jansenist interpretation. This is an accurate representation of a major scholarly view.")
    print(" - F is correct. In his dialogue 'On Free Choice of the Will', Augustine argues against his interlocutor, Evodius, that humanity is responsible for sin because sin originates from the misuse of the 'voluntas', not from a flaw in God's creation.\n")

    print("Step 2: Identifying the incorrect statement.")
    print(" - B is incorrect. This statement mischaracterizes the work of the historian R. A. Markus. While Markus did analyze Augustine's view of freedom as 'asymmetrical' (i.e., humans can choose sin on their own but require grace to choose good), the claim that he did so while 'ignoring his thoughts on predestination and grace' is false.")
    print(" - Scholarly work often involves focusing on or re-interpreting certain aspects of a thinker's work, but a prominent Augustinian scholar like Markus would not simply 'ignore' tenets as central as predestination and grace. His work may de-emphasize them in favor of social or historical analyses, but that is critically different from ignoring them. Therefore, this statement is a misrepresentation of his scholarship.\n")

    print("Step 3: Providing the final answer.")
    print("The statement that is not correct is B.")
    
    # Final answer output
    final_answer = 'B'
