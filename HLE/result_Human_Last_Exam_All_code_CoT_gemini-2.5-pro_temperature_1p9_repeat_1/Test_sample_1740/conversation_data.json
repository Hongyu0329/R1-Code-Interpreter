    "To determine the number of let-7 family members in humans, we need to count the distinct mature microRNAs that belong to this family. The let-7 family is defined by sequence homology, particularly in the seed region.\n\nThe family can be broken down as follows:\n1.  **The canonical `let-7` members:** This group includes `let-7a`, `let-7b`, `let-7c`, `let-7d`, `let-7e`, `let-7f`, `let-7g`, and `let-7i`. This accounts for 8 distinct members.\n2.  **The closely related `miR-98`:** Due to its sequence similarity, `miR-98` is also considered a member of the let-7 family. This adds 1 more member.\n\nThe following Python code will list these members, demonstrate the calculation, and print the total number.\n\n```python\ndef count_let7_family_members():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The canonical let-7 members (not including miR-98)\n    core_let7_members = [\n        \"let-7a\", \"let-7b\", \"let-7c\", \"let-7d\",\n        \"let-7e\", \"let-7f\", \"let-7g\", \"let-7i\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Other members of the let-7 family based on sequence homology\n    related_members = [\"miR-98\"]\n    \n    num_core_members = len(core_let7_members)\n    num_related_members = len(related_members)\n    total_members = num_core_members + num_related_members\n    \n    print(\"The human let-7 family consists of several members, typically grouped into:\")\n    print(f\"1.
