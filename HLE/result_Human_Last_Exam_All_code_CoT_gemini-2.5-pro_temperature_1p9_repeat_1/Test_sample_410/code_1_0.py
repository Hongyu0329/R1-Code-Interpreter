# Step 1: Find the parameters of the function f(x)
# f(x) = a_f * e^(2x) + b_f * e^x + c_f
# From lim_{x->-inf} (f(x)+3)/e^x = 1, we get c_f = -3 and b_f = 1.
# From f(ln(2)) = 0, we have a_f * 4 + 1 * 2 - 3 = 0 => 4*a_f = 1 => a_f = 1/4.
a_f = 1/4
b_f = 1
c_f = -3
print(f"The function f(x) is defined by the parameters a={a_f}, b={b_f}, c={c_f}.")
print(f"So, f(x) = ({a_f})*e^(2x) + ({b_f})*e^x + ({c_f}).")

# Step 2: Analyze the integral equation to find the new a and b.
# The identity in the problem holds if a = f(ln(b)).
# This gives the relation: a = (1/4)b^2 + b - 3.
# This relation has infinitely many solutions for (a,b).
# For a unique solution, we consider the special case that simplifies the integral equation.
# This occurs when one of the integrals is zero.
# If ln(b) = ln(2), i.e., b=2, the integral of f(x) is zero.
# In this case, a = f(ln(2)), which is given to be 0.
# So, the specific solution is a=0, b=2.
a_int = 0
b_int = 2

print(f"a = {a_int}")
print(f"b = {b_int}")

# Step 3: Calculate the final sum a+b
final_sum = a_int + b_int
print(f"The final answer is a + b = {a_int} + {b_int} = {final_sum}")
