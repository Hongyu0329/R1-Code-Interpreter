    "To find the smallest possible denominator of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with area 263, where all sides are rational, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem Setup:**\n    Let the sides of the right triangle be `a`, `b`, and the hypotenuse be `c`. The sides are rational numbers.\n    The area is `A = (1/2) * a * b = 263`.\n    The Pythagorean theorem states `a² + b² = c²`.\n    The number 263, the area of such a triangle, is known as a congruent number.\n\n2.  **Parametrization of Sides:**\n    The sides of any such triangle can be generated using a rational scaling factor, `λ`, and a primitive Pythagorean triple generator pair of integers `(m, n)` where `m > n > 0`, `gcd(m, n) = 1`, and `m`, `n` have opposite parity.\n    The sides are: `a = λ(m² - n²)`, `b = λ(2mn)`, `c = λ(m² + n²)`.\n\n3.  **Relating to the Area:**\n    Substitute these into the area formula:\n    `A = (1/2) * [λ(m² - n²)] * [λ(2mn)] = λ² * mn(m² - n²) = 263`\n    For `λ` to be rational, `λ = p/q`, we must have `λ² = 263 / (mn(m² - n²))`.\n    This implies that `263 * mn(m² - n²)` must be a perfect square of a rational number. Let `C = mn(m² - n²)`, which is called the \"congruum\". For `λ` to be rational, `263 * C` must be the square of an integer. This can only happen if the square-free part of `C` is 263.\n    So, `C = 263 * S²` for some integer `S`.\n\n4.  **Finding the Hypotenuse:**\n    From the area equation, `λ² * (263 * S²) = 263`, which simplifies to `λ² * S² = 1`, so `λ = 1/S`.\n    The hypotenuse `c` is given by:\n    `c = λ(m² + n²) = (1/S) * (m² + n²) = (m² + n²) / S`\n\n5.  **Minimizing the Denominator:**\n    The denominator of the hypotenuse `c` in its simplest form is `S / gcd(m² + n², S)`. Our goal is to find the pair `(m, n)` that minimizes this value.\n\n6.  **Computational Search:**\n    We can write a Python script to search for pairs `(m, n)` satisfying the conditions. For each pair, we calculate the congruum `C`, check if `C/263` is a perfect square, and if so, calculate the resulting denominator of the hypotenuse. We keep track of the pair that yields the smallest denominator. Since the required `m` and `n` can be large, the search limit might need to be set high.\n\nThe following Python code implements this search.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Computes the greatest common divisor of two integers.\"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if an integer is a perfect square.\n    Returns a tuple (is_square, square_root).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False, -1\n    if n == 0:\n        return True, 0\n    s = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return s * s == n, s\n\ndef find_hypotenuse_denominator(area, search_limit_m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the (m, n) pair that gives the smallest hypotenuse denominator for a given area.\n    \"\"\"\n    min_denominator = float('inf')\n    solution = {}\n\n    # Iterate through (m, n) pairs that generate primitive Pythagorean triples\n    # Conditions: m > n > 0, gcd(m, n) = 1, and m, n have opposite parity.\n    for m in range(2, search_limit_m + 1):\n        for n in range(1, m):\n            if (m - n) % 2 == 1 and gcd(m, n) == 1:\n                # Calculate the congruum\n                congruum = m * n * (m - n) * (m + n)\n                \n                if congruum == 0:\n                    continue\n\n                # We require the square-free part of the congruum to be the area\n                if congruum % area == 0:\n                    val = congruum // area\n                    is_sq, s = is_perfect_square(val)\n                    \n                    if is_sq:\n                        # Found a valid (m,n) pair\n                        num_c = m * m + n * n\n                        common_divisor = gcd(num_c, s)\n                        den_c = s // common_divisor\n                        \n                        if den_c < min_denominator:\n                            min_denominator = den_c\n                            solution = {\n                                'm': m,\n                                'n': n,\n                                'S': s,\n                                'num_c': num_c // common_divisor,\n                                'den_c': den_c\n                            }\n    return solution\n\n# Set the area and search limit.
