    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Factor the polynomial**: The given polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ can be factored. We'll identify the factors.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group**: We'll find the Galois group for each irreducible factor over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let these be $G_1$ and $G_2$.\n3.  **Compositum Field**: The splitting field $K$ of $P(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its factors. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ will be the direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$, provided the individual splitting fields have a trivial intersection (i.e., only $\\mathbb{Q}$). We will verify this condition.\n4.  **Galois Correspondence**: According to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ contained in $K$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n5.  **Find Normal Subgroups**: We need to find all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$. The condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ means we exclude the subgroups $H=G$ (which corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}$) and $H=\\{e\\}$ (which corresponds to $L=K$).\n6.  **Calculate Degrees**: For each identified normal subgroup $H$, we calculate its index $[G:H]$ to find the possible degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n7.  **List the Degrees**: We collect all unique degrees found in the previous step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step solution to find the possible degrees\n    of intermediate normal field extensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the polynomial\")\n    poly_str = \"P(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6\"\n    print(f\"The polynomial is {poly_str}.\")\n    print(\"By regrouping terms, we can factor it:\")\n    print(\"P(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)\")\n    print(\"P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)\")\n    print(\"P(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)\")\n    print(\"Let f1(x) = x^2 - 2 and f2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Determine the Galois groups of the factors\")\n    print(\"For f1(x) = x^2 - 2, the roots are +/- sqrt(2).
