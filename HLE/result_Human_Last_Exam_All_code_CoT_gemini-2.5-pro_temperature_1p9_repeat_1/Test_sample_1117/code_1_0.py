    # Nature of the reaction
    print("Reaction Type:")
    print("The reaction is an 'exohedral functionalization'. The disilirane adds to the OUTSIDE of the C80 cage.")
    print("This addition breaks the symmetry of the fullerene cage.")

    # Effect on endohedral atoms
    print("Effect on Internal Cerium Atoms:")
    print("The external chemical group alters the electronic landscape inside the cage.")
    print("It creates a region of high electron density on the cage wall directly beneath the point of attachment.")
    print("The positive Ce^3+ ions are strongly attracted to this new, localized electron-rich site.")
    print("This site and the one diametrically opposite can be considered the 'poles' of the modified fullerene.")
    print("To minimize their mutual electrostatic repulsion, the two Ce^3+ ions will occupy positions at opposite ends of the cage, along this new polar axis.")

    # Conclusion
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The free random motion of the cerium atoms ceases, and they become locked into specific positions. These positions are at the poles of the fullerene.")
