def solve_inductance_change():
    """
    This function calculates and prints the expression for the change in mutual
    inductance per unit length between the two circuits when the concentrators are added.

    The change is Delta_M' = M_2' - M_1', where M_1' is the mutual inductance
    for the bare circuits and M_2' is the value with the concentrator shells.

    1. M_1' (Bare circuits): In the limit d >> h, the mutual inductance per unit length
       is M_1' = (mu_0 * h^2) / (2 * pi * d^2).

    2. M_2' (With shells): The shells with mu_r -> infinity act as perfect magnetic
       shields for the internal circuits. The field from circuit 1 is contained
       within its shell, so the field at circuit 2 is zero. Thus, the flux
       through circuit 2 is zero, and M_2' = 0.

    3. Delta_M': The change is Delta_M' = 0 - M_1'.
