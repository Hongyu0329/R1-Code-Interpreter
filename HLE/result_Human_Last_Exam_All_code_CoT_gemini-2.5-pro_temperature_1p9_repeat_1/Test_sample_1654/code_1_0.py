    A POLICE superintendent, Otchumyelov, in a new overcoat and carrying a bundle, is walking across the market-place. A red-haired policeman with a sieve full of confiscated gooseberries stalks after him. All around is silence. Not a soul is in the square. The open doors of the shops and taverns stare desolately at the world, like hungry mouths. There is not even a beggar near them.

    "So you bite, you damned brute?" Otchumyelov hears suddenly. "Lads, don't let him go! Biting is not allowed nowadays. Hold him! Ah-ah!"

    There is the sound of a dog's yelp. Otchumyelov looks round and sees a dog run out of Pitchugin the timber-merchant's yard, hopping on three legs. A man in a starched print shirt, with his waistcoat unbuttoned, is chasing it. He runs after the dog, and, throwing his body forward, falls to the ground and seizes it by its hind-legs. Once more a yelp, and another shout of "Don't let go!" Sleepy faces are protruded from the shop-doors, and a crowd quickly collects round the timber-yard, as though it had sprung out of the earth.

    "It's a public disturbance, your Honour," says the policeman.

    Otchumyelov makes a half-turn to the left, and walks towards the crowd.

    By the timber-yard gate he sees the man in the unbuttoned waistcoat, who stands with his right hand raised, showing a bleeding finger to the crowd. On his semi-drunken face is written "You shall not get off, you rascal," and his very finger has the look of a flag of victory. Otchumyelov recognizes him as Hryukin the goldsmith. In the middle of the crowd, with its front paws extended and its whole body trembling, sits the cause of the disturbance, a little white borzoi pup, with a sharp muzzle and a yellow patch on its back. Its tearful eyes have a look of misery and terror.

    "What's all this?" asks Otchumyelov, pushing his way through the crowd. "What are you here for? Why are you waving your finger? Who was it that shouted?"

    "I was walking along here, your Honour, and not interfering with any one," begins Hryukin, with his hand to his mouth, and a cough. "I was talking about firewood with Mitry Mitritch, when this low brute, for no reason whatever, bit my finger. You must excuse me, I am a working man, and my work is delicate. I shall have to have damages, because I may not be able to use this finger for a week. It's not the law, your Honour, that one should be a victim to dumb brutes. If every one is going to be bitten, life will not be worth living."

    "H'm. Very good," says Otchumyelov, sternly, coughing and moving his eyebrows. "Very good. Whose dog is it? I will not let this pass. I'll teach them to let their dogs run about! It is time that these gentlemen were looked after, if they will not obey the regulations. When he is fined, the blackguard, a good sum, he will learn what it means to keep dogs and such-like stray cattle. I'll give him a lesson. Yeldrin," says the superintendent to the policeman, "find out whose dog this is, and draw up a report. The dog must be killed. Without delay. It is sure to be mad. Whose dog is it, I ask?"

    "I fancy that is General Zhigalov's dog," says some one in the crowd.

    "General Zhigalov's? H'm. . . . Take off my coat, Yeldrin. . . . It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain. But I have one misgiving. Can it have reached your finger? It is so small, and you are so big! You must have scratched your finger with a nail, and then the idea entered your head to get something for it. I know your sort. You are a set of devils."

    "He put a cigar-end into its mouth, for a joke, your Honour, and the dog was not a fool; it snapped at him. He is a queer fellow, your Honour."

    "That's a lie. You did not see it, so you are lying. His Honour is a wise man, and understands when a man is lying and when he is telling the truth, like before God. And if I am lying, let him decide. It's the law. . . . We are all equal now. I have a brother a policeman, if you want to know."

    "Don't argue!"

    "No, that's not the General's dog," says the policeman with profound conviction, "the General has not got one like that. His are all setters."

    "Do you know that for a fact?"

    "Yes, your Honour."

    "I know it, too. The General has valuable dogs, thoroughbred, and this is goodness knows what! A nasty, fawning thing. No coat, no shape. A low creature. And to keep a dog like that! Where is their sense? If a dog like that were to turn up in Petersburg or Moscow, do you know what would happen? They would not wait for the law, they would kill it on the spot. You have suffered, Hryukin, and it must not be passed over. We must give them a lesson. It is time."

    "And yet it may be the General's," says the policeman, thinking aloud. ". . . It's not written on its face. I saw one like it the other day in his yard."

    "It is the General's, that's certain!" says a voice in the crowd.

    "H'm. . . . Help me on with my coat, Yeldrin, my lad. . . . There's a wind getting up. . . . I feel chilly. You must take it to the General's, and inquire there. Say I found it and sent it. And tell them not to let it run into the street. It may be a valuable dog, and if every pig sticks a cigar-end into its mouth it will soon be spoilt. A dog is a delicate animal. And you, you blockhead, put your hand down! It's your own fault."

    "Here comes the General's cook, ask him. . . . Hi, Prokhor! Come here, my man. Look at this dog. Is it one of yours?"

    "What an idea! We have never had one like that."

    "There's no need to waste time asking," says Otchumyelov. "It's a stray dog! There's no need to waste time talking. Since you say it is a stray, it is a stray. It must be destroyed, that's all about it."

    "It is not our dog," Prokhor goes on. "It belongs to the General's brother, who came the other day. Our master does not care for borzois. His brother does."

    "Do you mean the General's brother is here? Vladimir Ivanych?" cries Otchumyelov, and his whole face is irradiated with a smile of tenderness. "Well, I never! And I did not know! Has he come on a visit?"

    "Yes."

    "Well, I never! He could not keep away from his brother. . . . And I did not know. So this is his dog? Delighted to hear it. . . . Take it. It's not a bad pup. . . . A lively creature. . . . Snapped at this fellow's finger! Ha-ha-ha! . . . Come, why are you trembling? Rrr . . . rrr. . . . The rogue is angry . . . a nice little pup."

    Prokhor calls the dog, and walks away from the timber-yard with her. The crowd laughs at Hryukin.

    "I'll make you smart yet!" Otchumyelov threatens him, and, wrapping himself in his greatcoat, he goes on his way through the market-place.
