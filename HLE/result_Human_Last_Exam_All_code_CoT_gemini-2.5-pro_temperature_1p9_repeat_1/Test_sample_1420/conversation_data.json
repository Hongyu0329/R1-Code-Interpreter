    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a 3-dimensional system using the epsilon expansion, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Epsilon Expansion:** This is a cornerstone technique in the renormalization group theory that calculates critical exponents as a power series in the small parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`, where `d_c` is the upper critical dimension and `d` is the spatial dimension. It is most accurate when `d` is close to `d_c`.\n2.  **Identify Key Parameters:** For a broad class of systems described by φ⁴ theory (such as the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension `d_c` is 4. The problem specifies a spatial dimension of `d = 3`. Therefore, the expansion parameter is `ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n3.  **Specify the Universality Class:** The value of the critical exponent `α` depends on the symmetries of the system, which are captured by the number of components of the order parameter, `n`. As it is not specified, I will use `n=1`, which corresponds to the Ising model universality class, the most common and fundamental example.\n4.  **Apply the Standard Formula:** I will use the well-established formula for the specific heat exponent `α` derived from a first-order (one-loop) epsilon expansion: `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`.\n5.  **Calculate and Code the Result:** I will provide a Python script that carries out this calculation. The script will clearly state the parameters used and print the full equation with the numbers substituted, demonstrating how the final value is obtained, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_specific_heat_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the first-order\n    epsilon expansion for the Ising universality class in d=3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters for the calculation\n    d = 3      # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = 4    # Upper critical dimension for the phi^4 model\n    n = 1      # Number of components for the order parameter (n=1 for the Ising model)\n\n    # 1.
