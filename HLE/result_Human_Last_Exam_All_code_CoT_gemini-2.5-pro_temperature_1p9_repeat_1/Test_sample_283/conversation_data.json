    "To determine the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication of two Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrices, we first need to understand how an HSS matrix is defined and how many fundamental submatrices it contains.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the HSS Structure:** An HSS matrix is recursively partitioned. A matrix `M` is split into a 2x2 block form: `[[M11, M12], [M21, M22]]`. The off-diagonal blocks `M12` and `M21` are represented in a compressed low-rank format. The diagonal blocks `M11` and `M22` are recursively partitioned further. This process creates a binary tree structure.\n2.  **Identify the \"Submatrices\":** The fundamental components (submatrices) that define the HSS representation are:\n    *   The low-rank representations of the **off-diagonal blocks** at every level of the hierarchy (corresponding to the internal nodes of the tree).\n    *   The dense **diagonal blocks** at the deepest level of partitioning (corresponding to the leaf nodes of the tree).\n3.  **Count Submatrices for One HSS Matrix:** For a tree of depth `d`, we will calculate:\n    *   The number of internal nodes, which determines the number of pairs of off-diagonal blocks. A binary tree of depth `d` has `2^d - 1` internal nodes.\n    *   The number of leaf nodes, which corresponds to the number of dense diagonal blocks at the lowest level. A binary tree of depth `d` has `2^d` leaf nodes.\n    *   The total number of submatrices for one matrix is the sum of all off-diagonal blocks and leaf-level diagonal blocks.\n4.  **Calculate for Matrix Multiplication:** The multiplication `C = A * B` requires access to the submatrices of both input matrices, `A` and `B`. Therefore, the total number of accessed submatrices will be twice the number for a single matrix.\n5.  **Code the Calculation:** A Python script will be used to perform these calculations for a depth `d=4` and print the result, showing each step of the process.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hss_submatrix_access():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication\n    of two HSS matrices with a tree of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    depth = 4\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing an HSS tree of depth d = {depth}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # 1.
