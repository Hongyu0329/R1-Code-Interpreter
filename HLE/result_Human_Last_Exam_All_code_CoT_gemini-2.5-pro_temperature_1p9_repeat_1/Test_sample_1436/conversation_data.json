    "This problem requires calculating the symmetry factor of a specific Feynman diagram. The symmetry factor, denoted by 'S', is a crucial concept in quantum field theory for correcting the overcounting of diagrams that are topologically identical.\n\n### My Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Diagram:** Based on the description \"two vertices and four field contractions,\" I'll identify the structure of the Feynman diagram. This corresponds to a vacuum diagram in a theory like $\\phi^4$ theory, where two vertices are connected by four internal lines (propagators).\n2.  **Identify Symmetries:** The symmetry factor is the number of ways the components of the diagram can be rearranged without changing its overall structure. I will identify the two sources of symmetry in this diagram:\n    *   **Vertex Interchangeability:** The two vertices are identical, so they can be swapped.\n    *   **Line Interchangeability:** The four lines connecting the vertices are also identical and can be permuted among themselves.\n3.  **Calculate the Factor:** The total symmetry factor is the product of the number of permutations for each source of symmetry.\n    *   Number of vertex permutations = 2!\n    *   Number of line permutations = 4!\n    *   Total symmetry factor S = 2! * 4!\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print out each step of the equation clearly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_feynman_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four internal lines.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of vertices in the diagram\n    num_vertices = 2\n    \n    # Number of identical lines (field contractions) connecting the vertices\n    num_lines = 4\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Calculate symmetry from interchanging vertices ---\n    # The two vertices are identical, so they can be swapped without\n    # changing the diagram's topology.\n    # The number of ways to permute them is num_vertices!\n    vertex_symmetry = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n    \n    # --- Step 2: Calculate symmetry from interchanging lines ---\n    # The four lines connecting the two vertices are identical.
