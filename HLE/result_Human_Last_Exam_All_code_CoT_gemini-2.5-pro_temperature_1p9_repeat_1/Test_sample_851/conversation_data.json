    "This question is about identifying crystal classes with a specific combination of symmetry properties. Let's break down the requirements step by step.\n\n**1. Understanding the Properties:**\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. For this to occur, the crystal structure must be **chiral** (lacking any improper rotation axes, such as a center of inversion or a mirror plane). The crystal classes that are chiral (and thus can exhibit true optical activity) are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, and 432.\n*   **Achiral:** This is the opposite of chiral. An achiral crystal class possesses at least one mirror plane or a center of inversion. Therefore, a crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral.\n*   **Non-Polar:** A crystal is non-polar if it does not have a unique directional axis. The polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Any class not in this list is non-polar.\n\n**2. The Contradiction:**\n\nThe question asks for **achiral** classes that have the symmetry for **optical activity**. As explained above, true optical activity requires chirality. This presents a contradiction. However, in crystallography, the term \"optical activity\" is sometimes used more broadly to include optical rotation effects caused by a phenomenon called **spatial dispersion**, which can occur in a few specific achiral classes. We must assume the question is referring to this broader definition.\n\n**3. The Plan:**\n\nWe will identify the crystal classes that satisfy all three of the following conditions:\n1.  **Is achiral:** The class is *not* one of the truly chiral classes.\n2.  **Is non-polar:** The class is *not* one of the ten polar classes.\n3.  **Shows gyrotropic effects (the broader \"optical activity\"):** The class belongs to a small set of achiral classes (m, mm2, -4, 4mm, -42m) where spatial dispersion can cause rotation of polarized light.\n\nThe Python code below will systematically check which of the crystal classes mentioned in the options satisfy all three of these specific conditions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes from the given options that meet the specified\n    criteria: achiral, non-polar, and allowing for gyrotropic effects (a broader\n    form of optical activity).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the sets of crystal classes based on their properties.\n    # Note: Hermann-Mauguin symbols are used.
