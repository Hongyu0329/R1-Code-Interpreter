    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct hand to jam all-in with:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Situation**: We are in an early position (UTG+1) with a short stack (16 big blinds) near the money bubble.\n    *   **Position (UTG+1)**: Being in an early position means we must act before most of our opponents. This requires us to play a stronger, tighter range of hands because there are many players left who could wake up with a monster hand.\n    *   **Stack Size (16bb)**: This stack is in the \"push/fold\" zone. It's generally incorrect to make a standard-sized raise with the intention of folding to a 3-bet, as it commits too much of our stack. Going all-in (jamming) is the standard play with strong hands in this stack depth.\n    *   **Money Bubble**: This is the most critical factor. The ICM (Independent Chip Model) pressure is immense. Players with medium or big stacks will be very reluctant to call our all-in without a premium hand because busting out before the money is a disaster. This reluctance from our opponents gives our all-in shove much more \"fold equity,\" meaning we can profitably shove with a wider range of hands than we normally could.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options**: We need to check which of the given hands fall into a standard shoving range for this specific situation. A typical shoving range from UTG+1 with 16bb, accounting for the bubble's fold equity, would include strong pairs, strong suited aces, and strong offsuit Broadway hands. A widely accepted range is `66+, A9s+, KTs+, QJs+, ATo+, KQo`.\n\n3.  **Choose the Best Option**: Based on the standard range, it's likely that multiple hands in the options are correct shoves (e.g., 99, AJo, AKo). The question asks for the hand you *should* jam, implying the best choice. To break the tie, we should consider how each hand performs when we *do* get called. Since our opponents will only call with a very strong range (e.g., `TT+`, `AK`), we should choose the hand that has the best equity against that calling range.\n\n    *   **AKo vs. `TT+, AK`**: Has about 42% equity. It blocks AA and KK and dominates any weaker Ace a villain might call with.\n    *   **99 vs. `TT+, AK`**: Has about 35% equity. It is crushed by all pairs `TT` or higher and is only a small favorite against `AK`.\n    *   **AJo vs. `TT+, AK`**: Has about 28% equity. It is dominated by `AK` and crushed by the pairs.\n    *   **QJs vs. `TT+, AK`**: Has about 29% equity. It performs poorly against this tight range.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: `AKo` has the best performance when called by the tight range we expect to face on the bubble. While `99` and `AJo` are also standard shoves, `AKo` is the most robust and profitable choice due to its excellent equity and powerful blocker effects.\n\nHere is a Python script that defines a standard shoving range and checks which of the options are correct shoves.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef expand_range(range_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Expands a poker hand range string into a list of specific hands.\n    Example: \"88+, ATs+, AQo+\" -> ['AA', 'KK', ..., '88', 'AKs', ..., 'ATs', 'AKo', 'AQo']\n    \"\"\"\n    ranks = '23456789TJQKA'\n    hands = set()\n    parts = range_str.split(',')\n    for part in parts:\n        part = part.strip()\n        if len(part) == 2: # Unpaired hand like 'AK'\n             hands.add(part)\n             continue\n        \n        rank1, rank2, kind = part[0], part[1], part[2:]\n        \n        # Handle pairs like '88+'\n        if rank1 == rank2 and kind == '+':\n            start_index = ranks.index(rank1)\n            for i in range(start_index, len(ranks)):\n                hands.add(ranks[i] + ranks[i])\n        # Handle suited connectors like 'ATs+'\n        elif kind == 's+':\n            start_index1 = ranks.index(rank1)\n            start_index2 = ranks.index(rank2)\n            for i in range(start_index2, start_index1):\n                 hands.add(ranks[start_index1] + ranks[i] + 's')\n        # Handle offsuit connectors like 'AQo+'\n        elif kind == 'o+':\n            start_index1 = ranks.index(rank1)\n            start_index2 = ranks.index(rank2)\n            for i in range(start_index2, start_index1):\n                 hands.add(ranks[start_index1] + ranks[i] + 'o')\n        # Handle specific hands like 'QJs'\n        elif kind in ['s', 'o'] or not kind:\n             hands.add(part)\n\n    return list(hands)\n\ndef check_hand(hand, push_range_list):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a hand is in the pushing range.\"\"\"\n    return hand in push_range_list\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to analyze the poker scenario and determine the correct action.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the situation\n    position = \"UTG+1\"\n    stack_bb = 16\n    situation = \"Near the money bubble\"\n    \n    # A standard Push/Fold chart for 16bb from UTG+1 (9-max)\n    # 66+, A9s+, KTs+, QJs+, ATo+, KQo\n    # This notation means: pairs of 6s or better, Ace-9 suited or better, etc.\n    push_range_hands = [\n        # Pairs 66+\n        'AA', 'KK', 'QQ', 'JJ', 'TT', '99', '88', '77', '66',\n        # Suited Aces A9s+\n        'AKs', 'AQs', 'AJs', 'ATs', 'A9s',\n        # Suited Kings KTs+\n        'KQs', 'KJs', 'KTs',\n        # Suited Queens QJs+\n        'QJs',\n        # Offsuit Aces ATo+\n        'AKo', 'AQo', 'AJo', 'ATo',\n        # Offsuit Kings KQo\n        'KQo'\n    ]\n    \n    # Options given by the user\n    options = collections.OrderedDict([\n        ('A', {'hand': 'QJs', 'description': 'QJs'}),\n        ('B', {'hand': None, 'description': 'None of these'}),\n        ('C', {'hand': '99', 'description': '99'}),\n        ('D', {'hand': 'AJo', 'description': 'AJo'}),\n        ('E', {'hand': 'AKo', 'description': 'AKo'})\n    ])\n\n    print(f\"Situation: Jamming with {stack_bb}bb from {position} on the money bubble.\\n\")\n    print(f\"A standard shoving range for this spot is: 66+, A9s+, KTs+, QJs+, ATo+, KQo\\n\")\n    print(\"Checking which of the hands fall into this range:\")\n\n    correct_shoves = []\n    for key, val in options.items():\n        if val['hand']:\n            is_shove = check_hand(val['hand'], push_range_hands)\n            if is_shove:\n                correct_shoves.append(f\"{key}. {val['description']}\")\n                print(f\"- {val['description']}: Correct to shove.\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"- {val['description']}: Incorrect to shove (Fold).\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    if len(correct_shoves) > 1:\n        print(\"Multiple hands are correct shoves based on standard charts.\")\n        print(\"To choose the BEST hand, we analyze equity against a tight calling range (e.g., TT+, AK).\")\n        print(\"Equity when called:\")\n        print(\" - AKo: ~42%\")\n        print(\" - 99:  ~35%\")\n        print(\" - AJo: ~28%\")\n        print(\" - QJs: ~29%\")\n        print(\"\\nAKo has the best equity when called, making it the most robust and profitable shove.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Only one hand is a clear shove based on the analysis.\")\n\nmain()\n<<<E>>>\n```"
