        "For example, the geocentric model of the solar system was a well-justified belief for centuries, but it was not true. "
        "The JTB model correctly excludes this from being knowledge because the 'True' condition failed. However, "
        "from the perspective of the individual believer, there is often no internal way to distinguish between a Justified *True* Belief and a Justified *False* Belief. "
        "The 'True' condition is an external requirement that the believer may have no independent way of verifying. "
        "This means the JTB definition works well for classifying knowledge in hindsight but is not a practical guide for an individual "
