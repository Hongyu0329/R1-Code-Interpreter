    "The JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge, while foundational, faces several challenges even when Gettier problems are disregarded. Given the constraint of only two epistemic states (Knowledge and Belief), here is a plan to identify two significant problems.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the \"Justified\" component:** The requirement for justification is central to the JTB theory. I will explore the logical implications of needing to justify a belief, specifically what is required to know that the justification itself is valid. This leads to a classic philosophical dilemma.\n2.  **Analyze the \"True\" component:** The requirement for truth is what separates knowledge from mere belief. I will examine the relationship between justification and truth, focusing on the problem that a belief can be well-justified but still false. This highlights a critical disconnect between the internal state of the believer (their justification) and the external state of the world (the truth).\n3.  **Synthesize and Format:** I will articulate these two problems and present them within a Python code block as requested, using a `print` function to output the explanation as a string.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains two problems with the JTB definition of knowledge,\n    ignoring Gettier cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    problem1_title = \"Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification\"\n    problem1_explanation = (\n        \"The 'Justified' condition of the JTB theory is not self-sufficient. \"\n        \"If a belief 'B' must be justified by 'J1', what validates J1? To *know* that J1 is a good justification, \"\n        \"one would presumably need a justified true belief about J1, which would require another justification, 'J2'. \"\n        \"This process continues, leading to an infinite regress (J1 needs J2, J2 needs J3, etc.). \"\n        \"The alternative is to stop at a justification that is not itself justified, which would make all subsequent knowledge \"\n        \"based on a dogmatic assumption. The JTB model does not provide a solution to this paradox, known as the \"\n        \"Agrippan Trilemma, about where the chain of justification should end.\"\n    )\n\n    problem2_title = \"Problem 2: The Problem of Fallible Justification\"\n    problem2_explanation = (\n        \"A belief can be perfectly and rationally justified based on all available evidence, yet still be false. \"\n        \"For example, the geocentric model of the solar system was a well-justified belief for centuries, but it was not true. \"\n        \"The JTB model correctly excludes this from being knowledge because the 'True' condition failed. However, \"\n        \"from the perspective of the individual believer, there is often no internal way to distinguish between a Justified *True* Belief and a Justified *False* Belief. \"\n        \"The 'True' condition is an external requirement that the believer may have no independent way of verifying. \"\n        \"This means the JTB definition works well for classifying knowledge in hindsight but is not a practical guide for an individual \"\n        \"to determine if their own current justified beliefs actually count as knowledge.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"{problem1_title}\\n{'-' * len(problem1_title)}\\n{problem1_explanation}\\n\")\n    print(f\"{problem2_title}\\n{'-' * len(problem2_title)}\\n{problem2_explanation}\")\n\nexplain_jtb_problems()\n```\n<<<The two problems are the Regress Problem of Justification and the Problem of Fallible Justification, as detailed in the code's output.>>>"
