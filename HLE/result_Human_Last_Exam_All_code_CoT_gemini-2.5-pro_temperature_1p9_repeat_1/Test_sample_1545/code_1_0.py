# Although there are multiple combinations that fit the options, a deeper dive 
# suggests certain configurations are more likely.
# For example: p=6, q=7, r=4 => 6 + 14 + 12 = 32
# Another: p=6, q=8, r=3 => 6 + 16 + 9 = 31
# And: p=6, q=7, r=5 => 6 + 14 + 15 = 35
# And: p=6, q=8, r=4 => 6 + 16 + 12 = 34
# Since multiple answers are possible based on interpretation, and the prompt
# requests all valid options, let's determine what the sorted list is.
# The valid numerical results found by the script are [31, 32, 34, 35, 37].
# Let's map these to letters:
# 31 -> A
# 32 -> B
# 34 -> D
# 35 -> E
# 37 -> I
# The format requires a sorted list of capitalized letter choices.
