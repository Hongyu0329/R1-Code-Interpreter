    print("In DM1, the CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene is unstable and tends to expand. This 'somatic instability' is thought to occur during DNA replication. The repetitive sequence on the lagging strand can form stable secondary structures like hairpins, which disrupts the replication process.")

This extended lifetime of unsealed nicks provides more opportunity for the newly synthesized CTG strand to slip, form a hairpin, and lead to re-replication of the repeat region. The cell's repair machinery often resolves this by adding repeats, thus leading to expansion.")
