    "My plan is to first identify the bacterium known for producing a chemical compound that exhibits triboluminescent properties. The property of triboluminescence in this context is associated with the luciferase enzyme produced by the bacterium. I will research which bacterial genus is known for this. Once the genus is identified, I will create a simple Python script to declare this name as a string and print it in a full sentence to answer the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_bacterium_genus():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the genus of bacterium known for\n  producing a compound that exhibits triboluminescence.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens produces a luciferase enzyme.\n  # When this enzyme is crystallized, it exhibits triboluminescence,\n  # which is the emission of light when the crystals are crushed or broken.\n  genus = \"Photorhabdus\"\n\n  print(f\"The genus of bacterium that produces a chemical compound exhibiting triboluminescent properties is: {genus}\")\n\nfind_bacterium_genus()\n```\n<<<Photorhabdus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What genus of bacterium produces a chemical compound that exhibits triboluminescent properties?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
