def solve_go_puzzle():
    """
    This function analyzes a Go position to determine the best move for Black to capture a group of White stones.

    The problem can be solved by following these steps:
    1.  Identify the connected group of White stones that needs to be captured.
    2.  Determine the 'liberties' of this group, which are the adjacent empty intersection points.
    3.  Find the 'vital point' among these liberties. The vital point is the move that is most critical for both life and death. Playing on this point prevents the defending group from making the required two 'eyes' to live.
    4.  Evaluate the candidate moves provided in the multiple-choice options.

    Analysis:
    The White stones at (2,5), (1,4), (3,4), (3,3), and (2,2) form a single group.
    The liberties of this group are the empty points: (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), and (3,2).
    The point (2,4) is a 'vital point' because:
    - It is adjacent to three different White stones. Playing here significantly reduces the group's liberties.
    - It is the key point for White to create a large eye shape. If Black does not play at (2,4), White can play there and secure enough space to live.

    By playing at (2,4), Black initiates a sequence that leads to the capture of the entire White group, regardless of White's responses.
