    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group, $\\rho(X)$, of the variety $X = C^{(15)}$, which is the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve $C$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the relevant formula:** The rank of the Néron-Severi group of the n-th symmetric power of a curve $C$, denoted $\\rho(C^{(n)})$, is given by a well-known formula that relates it to the Jacobian variety $J(C)$ of the curve. The formula is $\\rho(C^{(n)}) = 1 + \\text{rank}(\\text{End}(J(C)))$, where $\\text{End}(J(C))$ is the endomorphism ring of the Jacobian. Notice that this rank is independent of the power $n$, so the fact that we have the 15th symmetric power is not crucial for the final rank calculation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the formula:** The problem reduces to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for the rank of the endomorphism ring of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n    *   The **smallest rank** occurs for a \"general\" curve, whose Jacobian has the minimal possible number of endomorphisms.\n    *   The **largest rank** occurs for a \"special\" curve with Complex Multiplication (CM), whose Jacobian has the maximal possible number of endomorphisms.\n\n3.  **Execute the calculations:** We will write a Python script to carry out the calculations for the smallest and largest ranks based on the properties of Jacobians of genus 3 curves.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3  # Genus of the curve C\n    n = 15 # The symmetric power, not needed for the rank calculation but given\n\n    print(f\"The task is to find the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^({n}),\")\n    print(f\"where C is a curve of genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group, rho(X), is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"rho(X) = 1 + rank(End(J(C)))\")\n    print(\"where J(C) is the Jacobian of C and End(J(C)) is its endomorphism ring.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe need to find the minimum and maximum possible values for rank(End(J(C))).\")\n\n    # --- Smallest Rank ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Smallest Possible Rank ---\")\n    print(\"This occurs for a 'general' curve C.
