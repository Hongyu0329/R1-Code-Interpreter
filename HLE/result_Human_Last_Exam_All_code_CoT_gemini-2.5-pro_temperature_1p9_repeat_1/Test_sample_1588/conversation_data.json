    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan followed by the Python code to solve the problem.\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order `n` in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion for two generators `X` and `Y` corresponds to the dimension of the `n`-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra generated by `X` and `Y`. This dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula:\n\n`dim(L_n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(n/d) * k^d`\n\nwhere:\n-   `n` is the order (in this case, 10).\n-   `k` is the number of generators (2 for `X` and `Y`).\n-   The sum `Σ` is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n-   `μ` is the Möbius function.\n\nMy plan is to implement this formula in Python for `n=10`:\n1.  Write a helper function to find all divisors of `n`.\n2.  Write helper functions to compute the Möbius function `μ(x)`. This requires finding the prime factorization of `x`.\n3.  Use these helpers to calculate each term in the sum of Witt's formula.\n4.  Finally, sum the terms and divide by `n` to get the final result.\n5.  The script will print out each number used in the calculation of the final equation to show the process clearly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of prime factors of a given number.\n    Example: get_prime_factorization(12) -> [2, 2, 3]\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp_num = num\n    while d * d <= temp_num:\n        while temp_num % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            temp_num //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_num > 1:\n        factors.append(temp_num)\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Möbius function mu(n).\n    - mu(n) = 1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    - mu(n) = -1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    - mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    \n    # Check for squared prime factors\n    if len(prime_factors) != len(set(prime_factors)):\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # It's square-free\n        return (-1)**len(prime_factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of a number n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef calculate_bch_nonzero_coeffs(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients for a given order n\n    in the BCH expansion with k generators using Witt's formula and\n    prints the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    print(\"The number of nonzero coefficients is calculated using Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"  Number = (1/n) * Σ_{{d|n}} μ(n/d) * k^d\\n\")\n    print(f\"For this problem, n = {n} (order 10) and k = 2 (generators X and Y).\")\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"\\nThe divisors 'd' of n={n} are: {divisors}\")\n    \n    sum_terms_values = []\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating each term 'μ(n/d) * k^d' in the sum:\")\n    for d in divisors:\n        n_over_d = n // d\n        mu_val = mobius(n_over_d)\n        term_val = mu_val * (k**d)\n        total_sum += term_val\n        sum_terms_values.append(term_val)\n        \n        print(f\"  For d={d:2d}: μ(n/d) = μ({n}/{d}) = μ({n_over_d}) = {mu_val:2d}.
