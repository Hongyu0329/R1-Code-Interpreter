The procedure states: 'the PDA batch was autoclaved at 121 degrees under high pressure for 25 minutes' after the chloramphenicol was added."""

This means it is sensitive to heat and breaks down or becomes inactive when subjected to high temperatures like those used in an autoclave (121 degrees Celsius). The standard and correct procedure is to autoclave the media first, let it cool to a safe temperature (around 50Â°C), and then add any heat-sensitive supplements like chloramphenicol aseptically."""

Batches 1 and 2, which were presumably prepared correctly with the antibiotic added after autoclaving, retained their antibacterial properties."""

    step4_text = """The lab believed Batch 3 was safe because it was prepared in a biosafety cabinet, which seemed more rigorous, and it passed a Quality Control (QC) check. The QC check was flawed; it failed to detect the absence of antibacterial activity. This could be because the QC organism (*Bacillus subtilis*) was in its spore form and didn't germinate during the test, or the lab simply misinterpreted the results."""

They overlooked a fundamental principle of microbiology: the heat-labile nature of chloramphenicol. When all batches were exposed to common airborne bacteria (like the spore-forming rods found), only Batch 3 lacked the protection to inhibit bacterial growth, leading to the observed contamination."""
