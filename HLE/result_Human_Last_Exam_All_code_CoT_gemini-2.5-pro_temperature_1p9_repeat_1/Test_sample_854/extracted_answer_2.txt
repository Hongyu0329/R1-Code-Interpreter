The laboratory's crucial mistake was adding the heat-sensitive antibiotic, chloramphenicol, to Batch 3 *before* autoclaving. The high heat of the autoclave (121Â°C) destroyed the antibiotic, rendering the agar unable to inhibit bacterial growth. They were misled into believing the batch was safe because of a flawed or misinterpreted Quality Control check and a false sense of security from using a biosafety cabinet during preparation.
