    print("Parameter: k\n")

    print("Step 1: Complexity on General Graphs")
    print("The problem is a 'packing' problem, where we need to pack k structures (cycles of length >= k) into a graph.")
    print("These problems are often computationally hard. The DisjointCycles problem is known to be W[1]-complete on general graphs.")
    print("This means an algorithm with a runtime of f(k) * poly(|V|) is unlikely to exist, where f is any function depending only on k.")

    print("Many problems that are W[1]-hard on general graphs become fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) on planar graphs.")
    print("This is a major pattern in parameterized complexity. For example, k-Clique and k-Disjoint Paths are both FPT on planar graphs.")
    print("The techniques used for planar graphs (like sphere-cut decompositions) are powerful and often lead to FPT algorithms for packing problems.")

    print("B. States the problem is FPT on planar graphs but W[1]-complete on general graphs. This aligns perfectly with the common behavior of such problems.")
    print("C. W[2]-complete is unlikely, as the problem's logical structure does not match canonical W[2]-complete problems like Dominating Set.")
    print("D. coNP-hard is false, as the problem is in NP.")
    print("E. While the problem might also be FPT on bounded-degree graphs, option B describes the behavior on a broader and more significant graph class (planar graphs).\n")
