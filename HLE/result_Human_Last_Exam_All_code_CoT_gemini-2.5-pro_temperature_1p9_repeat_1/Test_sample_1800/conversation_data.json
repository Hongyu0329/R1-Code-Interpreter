    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for the specified catalytic reactions.\n\nMy plan is to first identify the ideal composition of Ni-Ceria catalysts from scientific literature, as the optimal ratio is determined through experimental research rather than direct calculation. Research indicates that a composition with a 10% molar doping of Ni into the Ceria lattice, corresponding to a formula of Ni₀.₁Ce₀.₉O₂-δ, provides an excellent balance of active sites and catalyst stability for both Water Gas Shift and water splitting reactions. This composition maximizes the synergistic interaction at the Ni-Ceria interface, which is crucial for catalytic activity.\n\nI will then write a Python script that calculates the Ni/Ce molar ratio based on this ideal stoichiometry (Ni₀.₁Ce₀.₉O₂-δ). The script will clearly show the moles of Ni and Ce from the formula and then compute their ratio.\n\n```python\n# Molar amounts of Nickel and Cerium based on the ideal catalyst stoichiometry Ni(0.1)Ce(0.9)O(2-d)\nmoles_Ni = 0.1\nmoles_Ce = 0.9\n\n# Calculate the ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio\nideal_ratio = moles_Ni / moles_Ce\n\n# Print the explanation and the result\nprint(\"Based on scientific findings, a highly effective composition for Ni-Ceria catalysts corresponds to the formula Ni(0.1)Ce(0.9)O(2-d).\")\nprint(\"This maximizes the number of active interface sites crucial for the reaction.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"Ideal Ratio = Moles of Ni / Moles of Ce\")\n# We explicitly print each number in the final equation as requested.\nprint(f\"Ideal Ratio = {moles_Ni} / {moles_Ce} = {ideal_ratio:.3f}\")\n```\n<<<0.111>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
