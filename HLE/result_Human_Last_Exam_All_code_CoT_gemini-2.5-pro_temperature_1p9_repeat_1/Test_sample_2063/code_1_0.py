    Calculates the limiting probability P(n) as n -> infinity.

    The probability P(n) is for the successful replication of a DNA sequence
    of length n, where success is defined as the count of each of the 8 bases `x`
    (c_x) not being congruent to `x` modulo 8.

    As n approaches infinity, the events {c_x mod 8 = x} become
    independent, and the probability of each such event approaches 1/8.
    The probability of the complementary event {c_x mod 8 != x} is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.

    The overall probability of success is the product of these probabilities for
    all 8 bases, which is (7/8)^8.
