# We found that the probability p_n is proportional to 1/n.
# p_n = C/n for some constant C.
# We want to calculate the limit of ln(1/p_n) / ln(n) as n -> infinity.
# ln(1/p_n) = ln(n/C) = ln(n) - ln(C)
# So, [ln(1/p_n) / ln(n)] = [ln(n) - ln(C)] / ln(n) = 1 - ln(C)/ln(n)
# As n -> infinity, ln(n) -> infinity, so ln(C)/ln(n) -> 0.
# The limit is 1.

# The code will demonstrate this logic.
# The actual value of the constant C is not needed to find the limit.
# We can represent the final calculation step symbolically.

# Final equation we want to compute is lim_{n->inf} (ln(n) - ln(C)) / ln(n)
# For the output, we will show the structure of this calculation, leading to the result.

k = 1 # The exponent in p_n scaling, p_n ~ n^(-k)

# The expression whose limit we are finding is: (k*ln(n) - ln(C)) / ln(n)
# which simplifies to k - ln(C)/ln(n)
# The limit as n->infinity is k.
# In our problem, we've deduced k=1.

# To be explicit as requested, showing the calculation in the final output:
numerator_term1 = f"ln(n)"
# Let's assume some constant for demonstration
C = 2.0
numerator_term2 = f"ln({C})"
denominator = "ln(n)"

# The structure of the expression is (numerator_term1 - numerator_term2) / denominator
# As n gets very large, numerator_term1 becomes dominant in the numerator.
# So the expression approaches numerator_term1 / denominator = ln(n)/ln(n) = 1.

# Although we have the final answer, the user wants to see the numbers in an equation.
# Since we are dealing with a limit, we can't put a single number for n.
# Let's demonstrate with a very large n.
n = 10**100
C = 2 # An arbitrary choice for the constant C

# Numerator: ln(n/C) = ln(n) - ln(C)

log_C = np.log(C)
numerator = log_n - log_C

# Denominator: ln(n)
denominator_val = log_n

# The value
value = numerator / denominator_val

# Let's print the formula and the result symbolically
# 'k' is the result we derived.
