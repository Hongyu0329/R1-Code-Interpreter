    "This problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects a specific family of lines. Through a series of steps in convex analysis, the problem can be reduced to calculating the area of a particular polygon.\n\n### My step-by-step thinking:\n1.  **Analyze the Condition:** The problem requires a convex domain `K` to intersect every line `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n2.  **Simplify with Symmetry:** For any convex set `K` that solves the problem, its centrally symmetrized version `(K - K) / 2` also solves it and has a smaller or equal area. So, we can assume the minimal domain `K` is centrally symmetric with respect to the origin.\n3.  **Use Support Functions:** For a centrally symmetric convex body `K`, the condition of intersecting the line `px + qy = 1` is equivalent to the condition `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1`, where `h_K` is the support function of `K`. This condition must hold for all coprime integer pairs `(p, q)`.\n4.  **Extend the Condition:** If `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1` holds for all coprime pairs, it can be shown to hold for all non-zero integer pairs `(p, q)`. This is because any non-zero integer pair `(p', q')` can be written as `k(p, q)` where `(p, q)` is coprime and `k ≥ 1` is an integer. Then, `h_K(p', q') = h_K(k(p, q)) = k * h_K(p, q) ≥ k * 1 ≥ 1`.\n5.  **Find the Minimal Support Function:** We now seek the minimal-area convex body `K` such that `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1` for all non-zero integers `(p, q)`. The minimal valid support function (that is also convex) is known to be `h_*(p, q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\n6.  **Identify the Dual Body:** The convex body `K*` whose support function is `h_*(p, q) = max(|p|, |q|)` is the L1-unit ball in 2D. This is the region defined by `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`, which is a square (or diamond) with vertices at `(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0),` and `(0, -1)`.\n7.  **Calculate the Area:** The final task is to calculate the area of this square. I will use the Shoelace formula for the area of a polygon, which is a straightforward calculation that can be implemented in code.\n\nThe formula is: `Area = 0.5 * |(x₁y₂ - y₁x₂) + (x₂y₃ - y₂x₃) + ... + (xₙy₁ - yₙx₁)|`.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan to calculate the final area.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines px+qy=1,\n    where p and q are coprime integers.\n    \n    The problem reduces to finding the area of the convex body K defined by |x| + |y| <= 1.\n    This body is a square with vertices at (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1).\n    We use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of this polygon.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Vertices of the polygon |x| + |y| <= 1\n    vertices = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]\n    \n    # Apply the Shoelace formula\n    n = len(vertices)\n    area = 0.0\n    \n    print(\"The minimal area corresponds to the area of the polygon with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1).\")\n    print(\"We calculate this area using the Shoelace formula: Area = 0.5 * |sum(x[i]*y[i+1] - x[i+1]*y[i])|\")\n    \n    sum_parts = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        j = (i + 1) % n\n        x_i, y_i = vertices[i]\n        x_j, y_j = vertices[j]\n        \n        term = x_i * y_j - x_j * y_i\n        sum_parts.append(term)\n        area += term\n        \n    final_area = 0.5 * abs(area)\n\n    # Outputting each number in the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"\\nThe equation is: Area = 0.5 * |({sum_parts[0]}) + ({sum_parts[1]}) + ({sum_parts[2]}) + ({sum_parts[3]})|\")\n    print(f\"Area = 0.5 * |{area}|\")\n    print(f\"Final Area = {final_area}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
