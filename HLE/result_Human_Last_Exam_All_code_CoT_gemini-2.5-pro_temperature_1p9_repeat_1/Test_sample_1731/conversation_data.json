    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the task, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Conceptual Framework**: The task is to find the equilibrium mean energy and entropy for a photon gas (Bose case for light quanta) using principles related to large deviation theory. In statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state, the one that maximizes entropy. Large deviation theorems like Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff provide a framework for understanding the probability of non-equilibrium states (deviations). The equilibrium state corresponds to the peak of the probability distribution, i.e., the state of \"zero deviation.\" The entropy `S` is directly related to the large deviation rate function (`I`), often as `I = -S/N k_B`. Therefore, maximizing the entropy is the method to find the equilibrium state.\n\n2.  **Method**: We will use the Grand Canonical Ensemble, which is the correct framework for a system of photons where the particle number is not conserved (implying the chemical potential `μ=0`).\n\n3.  **Derivation Steps**:\n    *   Start with the Bose-Einstein distribution for the mean number of photons `<n_ε>` in a state with energy `ε`.\n    *   Define the density of states `g(ε)` for photons confined to a 3D volume `V`.\n    *   Calculate the equilibrium mean energy `E` by integrating the energy per state (`ε * <n_ε>`) over the density of states: `E = ∫ ε * <n_ε> * g(ε) dε`.\n    *   Solve this integral, which results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black-body radiation (`E ∝ T⁴`).\n    *   Calculate the equilibrium entropy `S` using the thermodynamic relation for a photon gas, which can be derived from the grand partition function. This yields a simple relationship between entropy, energy, and temperature: `S = (4/3)E/T`.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library for symbolic representation. The script will not perform numerical calculations but will present the derived symbolic formulas for `E` and `S`, explicitly printing the numerical constants within those equations as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef derive_photon_gas_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically derives and prints the equilibrium values for\n    mean energy (E) and entropy (S) of a photon gas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define symbolic variables for physical constants and parameters.\n    # V: Volume, h: Planck's constant, c: speed of light, k_B: Boltzmann constant, T: Temperature\n    V, h, c, k_B, T = sp.symbols('V h c k_B T', positive=True, real=True)\n    # eps (varepsilon): energy of a single photon mode\n    eps = sp.Symbol('varepsilon', positive=True, real=True)\n\n    # beta is a common shorthand in statistical mechanics\n    beta = 1 / (k_B * T)\n\n    # Introduction to the physical model\n    print(\"Derivation of Equilibrium Properties for a Photon Gas (Bose case for light quanta)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n    print(\"The equilibrium state is the macrostate of maximum entropy.
