    Calculates the number of codimension 2 boundary strata of M_bar_3,1.

    This corresponds to counting the number of non-isomorphic stable dual graphs with:
    - genus g = 3
    - marked points n = 1
    - nodes k = 2 (codimension = #nodes)

    The calculation proceeds by enumerating graphs based on their number of vertices (V).
    The main constraints are:
    1. Genus formula: sum(g_v) + h_1 = 3, where h_1 = #edges - #vertices + 1.
       With #edges = 2, this simplifies to sum(g_v) = #vertices.
    2. Stability: A vertex v with g_v=0 must have valence(v) >= 3.
