    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify all knots with a crossing number of four or less.** These are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1).\n2.  **Determine which integral surgeries on these knots result in homology 3-spheres.** A 3-manifold created by an integral surgery with coefficient *p* on a knot *K* is a homology sphere if and only if the absolute value of the surgery coefficient, |p|, is 1. Therefore, we only need to consider +1 and -1 surgeries for each knot.\n3.  **Analyze the resulting manifolds for each knot.** We will check if the resulting homology spheres are distinct elements in the homology cobordism group ($\\Theta^3_H$). Two manifolds are distinct if they are not homology cobordant.\n4.  **Count the unique elements.** We will sum up the number of distinct elements found from all the knots.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan, explaining each step and calculating the final count.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and explains how many elements of the homology cobordism\n    group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"This script determines the number of homology cobordism group elements from knots with at most 4 crossings.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: List the knots\n    knots = [\"Unknot (0_1)\", \"Trefoil knot (3_1)\", \"Figure-eight knot (4_1)\"]\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify knots with at most 4 crossings.\")\n    print(f\"The knots are: {', '.join(knots)}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Explain surgery condition for homology spheres\n    print(\"Step 2: Identify valid surgeries.\")\n    print(\"An integral surgery on a knot with coefficient 'p' yields a homology sphere if and only if |p| = 1.\")\n    print(\"Thus, we only consider +1 and -1 surgeries for each knot.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze each knot and count the elements\n    print(\"Step 3 & 4: Analyze each knot and count the resulting unique elements.\")\n\n    # Dictionary to store the unique elements found, using descriptions as keys.\n    # The identity element is the 3-sphere S^3.\n    unique_elements = {\"S^3 (identity)\"}\n\n    # Analysis of the Unknot\n    print(\"\\n--- Analyzing the Unknot ---\")\n    print(\"+1 and -1 surgery on the unknot both yield the 3-sphere, S^3.\")\n    print(\"S^3 is the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\")\n    num_from_unknot = 1\n    print(f\"Unique elements from the Unknot: {num_from_unknot}\")\n\n    # Analysis of the Trefoil knot\n    print(\"\\n--- Analyzing the Trefoil knot (3_1) ---\")\n    print(\"+1 surgery yields the Poincaré sphere (P), a non-trivial element.\")\n    unique_elements.add(\"Poincaré sphere (P)\")\n    print(\"-1 surgery yields its inverse, the oppositely-oriented Poincaré sphere (-P).\")\n    print(\"P and -P are distinct, non-trivial elements.\")\n    unique_elements.add(\"-P\")\n    num_from_trefoil = 2\n    print(f\"New unique elements from the Trefoil: {num_from_trefoil}\")\n\n    # Analysis of the Figure-eight knot\n    print(\"\\n--- Analyzing the Figure-eight knot (4_1) ---\")\n    print(\"+1 surgery yields another non-trivial element (Q), which is distinct from S^3, P, and -P.\")\n    unique_elements.add(\"Sphere from +1 surgery on 4_1 (Q)\")\n    print(\"-1 surgery yields its distinct inverse (-Q).\")\n    unique_elements.add(\"-Q\")\n    num_from_fig8 = 2\n    print(f\"New unique elements from the Figure-eight knot: {num_from_fig8}\\n\")\n\n    # Final Calculation\n    total_elements = num_from_unknot + num_from_trefoil + num_from_fig8\n    print(\"--- Final Count ---\")\n    print(\"The distinct elements found are:\")\n    for element in sorted(list(unique_elements)):\n        print(f\" - {element}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSumming the contributions from each knot:\")\n    print(f\"{num_from_unknot} (from Unknot) + {num_from_trefoil} (from Trefoil) + {num_from_fig8} (from Figure-eight) = {total_elements}\")\n\n    # Print the final answer in the required format\n    # Redirecting to stderr for the final answer format as requested in some similar problems\n    # to separate it from the main informational output.\n    # However, since the instruction doesn't specify, printing to stdout is also fine.\n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of distinct elements is {total_elements}.\")\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    print(f\"<<<{total_elements}>>>\")\n\nsolve_homology_cobordism_count()\n```"
