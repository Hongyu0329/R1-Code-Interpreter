# The length of the sequences.
sequence_length = 100

# For a binary sequence of a given length, the maximum number of blocks of a single
# digit (e.g., '0') occurs when the digits alternate perfectly.
# A sequence like "010101..." of length 100 has 50 blocks of '0's and 50 blocks of '1's.

max_blocks_of_1s = sequence_length // 2

# To find the minimum number of operations 'n' for ANY transformation, we must
# consider the worst-case scenario. This involves transforming a sequence with the
# maximum number of blocks into another, structurally different sequence that also
# has the maximum number of blocks.

# Let's consider the transformation path through an intermediate state,
# for example, a sequence of all '0's.
# Cost = (operations to remove all '1'-blocks from the initial sequence) +
#        (operations to insert all '1'-blocks for the target sequence).

# The worst-case initial sequence ('S_i') has the maximum number of '1'-blocks.
cost_to_remove_S_i_blocks = max_blocks_of_1s

# The worst-case target sequence ('S_t') also has the maximum number of '1'-blocks.
cost_to_insert_S_t_blocks = max_blocks_of_1s

# In the absolute worst case (e.g., transforming '1010...' to '0101...'), no
# blocks can be meaningfully reused, so this path is the most optimal.
# The total minimum operations for this worst-case is the sum of these costs.
# An identical calculation can be made using an all-'1's intermediate, which would involve
# removing and inserting the maximum number of '0'-blocks, yielding the same result.

n = cost_to_remove_S_i_blocks + cost_to_insert_S_t_blocks

print(f"The cost is the sum of operations to destroy the initial structure and create the target structure.")
print(f"For the worst case, this is the maximum number of '0' or '1' blocks in the initial sequence plus the maximum in the target sequence.")
