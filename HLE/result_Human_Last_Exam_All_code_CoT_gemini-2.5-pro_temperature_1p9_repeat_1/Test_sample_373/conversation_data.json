    "To solve this problem, I will calculate the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during a randomized uniform gossiping process.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Model the Graph:** A 10-node barbell graph is formed by two 5-node complete graphs (cliques), connected by a single edge, which is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Define the Gossiping Process:** Randomized uniform gossiping involves two steps:\n    *   A node is selected uniformly at random from all 10 nodes.\n    *   The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random.\n3.  **Identify the Target Event:** The event \"sampling the bottleneck edge\" occurs if one of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge is chosen, and it then chooses its neighbor across the bottleneck. Let's call these nodes `u` and `v`.\n4.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. For the bottleneck nodes `u` and `v`: each is connected to 4 other nodes in its own clique and 1 node (the other bottleneck node) in the other clique. Therefore, the degree of both `u` and `v` is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The total probability is the sum of two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** Node `u` is selected (probability `1/10`), and it chooses `v` (probability `1/degree(u)` which is `1/5`). The probability is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n    *   **Scenario 2:** Node `v` is selected (probability `1/10`), and it chooses `u` (probability `1/degree(v)` which is `1/5`). The probability is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n    *   The total probability is the sum of these two scenarios: `1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n6.  **Code the Solution:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\n# A script to calculate the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph.\n\ndef solve_gossiping_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node\n    barbell graph under randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # A standard 10-node barbell graph consists of two 5-node cliques.\n    clique_size = 5\n\n    # The bottleneck edge connects one node from each clique.
