    "The quantity you are asking about is a fundamental concept in the field of nuclear reactor noise analysis. My plan is to first identify the common name for this quantity. Then, I will explain the underlying physics, starting from the generalized pair correlation function and its Fourier transform. To satisfy the request for a code-based answer, I will present a simplified, but widely used, model from this fieldâ€”the point kinetics model. Finally, I will provide a Python script that calculates the parameters for this model for a typical nuclear system and prints the resulting equation for the quantity in question, fulfilling the requirement to show the numbers in the final equation.\n\nThe space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function, which describes fluctuations in the neutron population, is commonly called the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**.\n\nIn the point-kinetics model, which ignores spatial effects, the Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD) is described by a Lorentzian function dependent on the system's kinetic parameters. The Python code below defines these parameters for a representative critical reactor and presents the specific form of the APSD equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates parameters for the point-kinetics Power Spectral Density (PSD)\n    and prints the resulting equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Define parameters for the point-kinetics model ---\n    \n    # Prompt neutron generation time in seconds. A typical value for a thermal reactor.\n    Lambda = 2.0e-5\n    \n    # Effective delayed neutron fraction.\n    beta_eff = 0.0065\n    \n    # Reactivity of the system. Let's assume the system is exactly critical (rho = 0).\n    reactivity = 0.0\n    \n    # Rossi-alpha is the prompt neutron decay constant in s^-1.\n    # It characterizes the time scale of the prompt neutron population's response.\n    try:\n        alpha = (beta_eff - reactivity) / Lambda\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Error: Prompt neutron generation time (Lambda) cannot be zero.\")\n        return\n\n    # The constant 'A' in the PSD formula represents the magnitude of the fluctuations.\n    # It depends on factors like reactor power, fission neutron statistics (Diven factor),\n    # and detector efficiency. We'll use an example value for illustration.\n    A = 5.0e-3  # Arbitrary units, e.g., (counts/s)^2 / Hz\n\n    # --- Output the explanation and results ---\n    \n    print(\"The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the Power Spectral Density (PSD).\")\n    print(\"\\nIn the simplified point-kinetics approximation (which neglects spatial effects), the Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD) has the following mathematical form:\")\n    print(\"APSD(omega) = A / (alpha^2 + omega^2)\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Using typical parameters for a critical thermal reactor:\")\n    print(f\"  - Prompt neutron generation time (Lambda): {Lambda:.2e} s\")\n    print(f\"  - Effective delayed neutron fraction (beta_eff): {beta_eff}\")\n    print(f\"  - Reactivity (rho): {reactivity}\")\n    print(f\"  - Amplitude constant (A): {A} (arbitrary units)\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"The calculated prompt neutron decay constant (Rossi-alpha) is:\")\n    print(f\"  alpha = ({beta_eff} - {reactivity}) / {Lambda:.2e} = {alpha:.2f} s^-1\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Therefore, the final equation for the Power Spectral Density with these specific numbers is:\")\n    \n    # Final output showing the equation with numbers embedded, as requested.\n    print(f\"APSD(omega) = {A} / ({alpha:.2f}^2 + omega^2)\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<Power Spectral Density>>>"
