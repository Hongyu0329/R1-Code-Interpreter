    "Of course. Here is a plan to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the Data:** I will create two Python dictionaries.\n    *   The first dictionary will map each of the 17 wallpaper groups to its corresponding point group (crystal class).\n    *   The second dictionary will map each point group to its order (the number of symmetry operations it contains). The point groups of order 2 are '2' (180Â° rotation) and 'm' (reflection).\n\n2.  **Iterate and Filter:** The code will loop through all 17 wallpaper groups. For each group, it will look up its point group and then find the order of that point group.\n\n3.  **Count and Display:** If the point group's order is 2, the wallpaper group will be added to a list of results. Finally, the code will print the names of the identified groups and show the final count as a simple addition equation.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the wallpaper groups that have a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the mapping from each wallpaper group to its point group.\n    # The keys are the 17 wallpaper groups in IUC notation.\n    # The values are their corresponding point groups in Hermann-Mauguin notation.\n    wallpaper_to_point_group = {\n        'p1': '1', 'p2': '2', 'pm': 'm', 'pg': 'm', 'cm': 'm',\n        'pmm': '2mm', 'pmg': '2mm', 'pgg': '2mm', 'cmm': '2mm',\n        'p4': '4', 'p4m': '4mm', 'p4g': '4mm',\n        'p3': '3', 'p3m1': '3m', 'p31m': '3m',\n        'p6': '6', 'p6m': '6mm'\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the order of each point group.\n    # The keys are the point groups, and values are their orders.\n    point_group_orders = {\n        '1': 1, '2': 2, 'm': 2, '2mm': 4, '4': 4, '4mm': 8,\n        '3': 3, '3m': 6, '6': 6, '6mm': 12\n    }\n    \n    target_order = 2\n    found_groups = []\n\n    # Step 3: Iterate through wallpaper groups to find those with a point group of the target order.\n    for group, point_group in wallpaper_to_point_group.items():\n        if point_group_orders.get(point_group) == target_order:\n            found_groups.append(group)\n    \n    # Sort for consistent, readable output\n    found_groups.sort()\n\n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with point group of order {target_order} are: {', '.join(found_groups)}.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Display the final count as an equation.\n    count = len(found_groups)\n    if count > 0:\n        equation_parts = [\"1\"] * count\n        equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n        print(f\"The total count is {equation_str} = {count}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"There are 0 such groups.\")\n\ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
