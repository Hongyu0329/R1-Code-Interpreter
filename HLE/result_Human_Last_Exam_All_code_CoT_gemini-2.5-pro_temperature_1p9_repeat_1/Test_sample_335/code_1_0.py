# Step 1: Define the properties of the first component, K1 = C_{4,3}(Conway).
# The knot K1 is the (4,3)-cable of the Conway knot.
# The simplicial volume of a cable C_{p,q}(J) is |p| * ||S^3 \ J||.
p_cable = 4
# The Conway knot is a slice knot, and the simplicial volume of any slice knot complement is 0.
vol_conway_complement = 0
# Calculate the simplicial volume of the first component.
vol_comp1 = p_cable * vol_conway_complement

# Step 2: Define the properties of the second component, K2 = Wh_-^2(Eight).
# K2 is the 2-twisted negative Whitehead double of the figure-eight knot.
# A theorem by Brock and Dunfield states that the simplicial volume of the complement of
# any twisted Whitehead double is 0.
vol_comp2 = 0

# Step 3: Calculate the total simplicial volume V.
# The simplicial volume is additive over connected sums.
V = vol_comp1 + vol_comp2

# Step 4: Compute the final value floor(10^6 * V).
factor = 10**6
result = math.floor(factor * V)

# Print the final equation with all its numerical components as requested.
