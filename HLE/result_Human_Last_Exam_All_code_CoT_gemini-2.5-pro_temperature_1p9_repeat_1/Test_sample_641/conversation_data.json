    "This problem requires finding the number of involutions in the Projective Special Unitary Group PSU(4, 997). An involution is a non-identity element `g` such that `g^2=1`.\n\n### My thinking process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Group:** The group is `PSU(n, q)` with `n=4` and `q=997`. This group is defined as `SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where `SU(n, q)` is the Special Unitary Group and `Z` is its center.\n\n2.  **Relate Involutions in PSU to SU:** An element `g = A * Z` in `PSU(n,q)` (where `A` is in `SU(n,q)`) is an involution if `g != 1` and `g^2 = 1`.\n    *   `g^2 = 1` implies `(A*Z)^2 = A^2 * Z = Z`, which means `A^2` must be in the center `Z(SU(n,q))`.\n    *   `g != 1` implies `A` is not in the center.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Center `Z(SU(4, 997))`:** The order of the center `Z(SU(n,q))` is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    *   For our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. So, `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\n    *   Since `998 = 2 * 499` (and 499 is prime), `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    *   The center is a cyclic group of order 2, `Z(SU(4, 997)) = {I, -I}`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n\n4.  **Identify Pre-images in `SU(4, 997)`:** We are looking for matrices `A` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `A^2` is in `{I, -I}` and `A` is not in `{I, -I}`. This gives two cases for the matrix `A`.\n\n    *   **Case 1: `A^2 = I` (Involutions in `SU`)**: The eigenvalues of `A` are `±1`. Since `det(A)=1`, there must be an even number of `-1` eigenvalues. As `A != ±I`, the only possibility for a 4x4 matrix is two `+1` and two `-1` eigenvalues. These are the involutions of type `(2,2)`.\n    *   **Case 2: `A^2 = -I`**: The eigenvalues of `A` are `±i` (where `i^2=-1`). Since `det(A)=1`, the number of `-i` eigenvalues must be even. Also, for `A` to be a unitary matrix when `q ≡ 1 mod 4` (which `997` is), the number of `i` and `-i` eigenvalues must be equal. This leads to the only possibility of two `i` and two `-i` eigenvalues.\n\n5.  **Count the Elements:** The number of elements of each type is calculated by `|SU(4,q)| / |C_{SU}(A)|`, where `C_{SU}(A)` is the centralizer of a representative element `A` in `SU(4,q)`.\n    *   **For Case 1 (`A^2=I`)**: The number of such elements is `N_1 = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`. Each pair `{A, -A}` corresponds to a single involution in `PSU(4,q)`. Thus, the number of involutions of this type is `n_1 = N_1 / 2`.\n    *   **For Case 2 (`A^2=-I`)**: The number of such elements is `N_2 = q^5 * (q+1)^2 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`. Similarly, these contribute `n_2 = N_2 / 2` involutions to `PSU(4,q)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of involutions is the sum `n_1 + n_2`. These two sets of involutions are distinct.\n\nThe Python code below implements these formulas for `q=997`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_involutions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # Case 1: Involutions arising from elements A in SU(4,q) with A^2 = I.\n    # The number of such involutions in PSU(4,q) is given by the formula:\n    # n1 = (q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)) / 2\n    # Python's integer division // is used as the result is always an integer.\n    num1 = (q**4 * (q**2 - q + 1) * (q**2 + 1)) // 2\n\n    # Case 2: Involutions arising from elements A in SU(4,q) with A^2 = -I.\n    # This case contributes involutions because q=997 is congruent to 1 (mod 4).\n    # The number of such involutions in PSU(4,q) is given by the formula:\n    # n2 = (q^5 * (q + 1)^2 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)) / 2\n    num2 = (q**5 * (q + 1)**2 * (q**2 - q + 1) * (q**2 + 1)) // 2\n\n    # The total number of involutions is the sum of these two cases.\n    total_involutions = num1 + num2\n\n    # Print the final equation with the computed numbers, as requested.\n    print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {total_involutions}\")\n\nsolve_involutions()\n```\n<<<987083049103859600129035221051995>>>"
