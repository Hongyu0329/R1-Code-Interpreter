# Plan:
# 1. Define the values for n_2 and n_3 based on the analysis.
#    From the problem's combinatorial constraints (4-regular, n C5s, 
#    removal of a vertex removes 5 C5s), the smallest number of vertices `n` 
#    for such a graph is determined to be 20.
# 2. Assign this value to both n_2 and n_3.
#    n_2 corresponds to the 2-planar case.
#    n_3 corresponds to the 3-planar case.
#    The analysis suggests n=20 for both cases under the problem's assumptions.
n_2 = 20
n_3 = 20

# 3. Perform the final calculation as requested.
#    The expression is (n_2 + n_3) * n_2.
result = (n_2 + n_3) * n_2

# 4. Print the final result along with the values used in the equation.
print(f"n_2 = {n_2}")
print(f"n_3 = {n_3}")
print(f"({n_2} + {n_3}) * {n_2} = {result}")
