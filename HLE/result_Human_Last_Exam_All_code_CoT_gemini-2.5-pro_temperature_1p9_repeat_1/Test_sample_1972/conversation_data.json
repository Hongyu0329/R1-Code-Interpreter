    "This is a literary knowledge question. My plan is to identify the author and novel based on the two distinct descriptions provided by Jorge Luis Borges.\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** The quote \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" is a very specific and striking piece of praise. A search for this quote in connection with Borges points directly to his critique of the Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos Onetti.\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** The description of an author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" also points to Juan Carlos Onetti, who was heavily influenced by William Faulkner and whose fictional universe (the city of Santa Mar√≠a) is often compared to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County.\n3.  **Identify the novel:** Borges wrote a prologue for Onetti's work where these sentiments are expressed. While the praise applies to much of Onetti's writing, it is most famously associated with his 1961 novel, *El astillero* (The Shipyard).\n4.  **Construct the code:** I will create a Python script that stores the author and novel in variables and then prints a formatted string to answer the user's question directly.\n\n```python\ndef find_borges_reference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the novel and author based on Jorge Luis Borges's praise.\n    \"\"\"\n    author = \"Juan Carlos Onetti\"\n    novel = \"El astillero (The Shipyard)\"\n    quote_clue = \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"\n    author_clue = \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\"\n\n    print(f\"The novel Jorge Luis Borges referred to is '{novel}' by {author}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nBorges praised the novel as having \\\"{quote_clue}\\\" and described its author, {author}, as \\\"{author_clue}.\\\"\")\n\nfind_borges_reference()\n```\n<<<El astillero (The Shipyard)>>>"
