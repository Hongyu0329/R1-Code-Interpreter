    "This problem can be solved using a result from Morse theory, a field of mathematics that studies the relationship between the topology of a manifold and the critical points of a smooth function defined on it.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Introduce the relevant theorem:** The Weak Morse Inequalities state that for any smooth function on a compact, boundaryless manifold (like the 2-torus), the total number of critical points is always greater than or equal to the sum of its Betti numbers.\n2.  **Define Betti numbers for the 2-torus ($T^2$):**\n    *   $b_0$: The number of connected components. For a torus, this is 1.\n    *   $b_1$: The number of \"one-dimensional holes\" or independent loops. A torus has two such loops (one around its central axis, and one through the hole). So, $b_1 = 2$.\n    *   $b_2$: The number of \"two-dimensional holes\" or enclosed voids. A torus encloses one such void. So, $b_2 = 1$.\n3.  **Calculate the sum:** Summing these Betti numbers ($b_0 + b_1 + b_2$) gives us the theoretical minimum number of critical points.\n4.  **Confirm the minimum:** We must also confirm that this minimum can actually be achieved. The function $f(x, y) = \\cos(x) + \\cos(y)$ on the torus (where $x, y \\in [0, 2\\pi)$) is a standard example that has exactly this minimum number of critical points (one maximum, one minimum, and two saddle points).\n5.  **Write the code:** The Python script will define the Betti numbers for the torus and print the calculation of their sum, which represents the minimal number of critical points.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this minimal number based on the sum of the Betti numbers.\n\n```python\n# The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a compact manifold\n# is bounded below by the sum of its Betti numbers.\n\n# Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2):\nb_0 = 1  # number of connected components\nb_1 = 2  # number of 1-dimensional (\"circular\") holes\nb_2 = 1  # number of 2-dimensional (\"void\") holes\n\n# Calculate the sum of the Betti numbers.\n# This sum gives the minimal number of critical points.\nminimal_critical_points = b_0 + b_1 + b_2\n\nprint(\"The minimal number of critical points is the sum of the Betti numbers of the 2-torus.\")\nprint(\"The Betti numbers are b_0, b_1, and b_2.\")\nprint(f\"b_0 = {b_0}\")\nprint(f\"b_1 = {b_1}\")\nprint(f\"b_2 = {b_2}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n# Output each number in the final equation\nprint(f\"{b_0} + {b_1} + {b_2} = {minimal_critical_points}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
