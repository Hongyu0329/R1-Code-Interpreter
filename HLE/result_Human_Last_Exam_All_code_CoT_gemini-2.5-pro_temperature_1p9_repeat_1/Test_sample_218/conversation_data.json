    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ whose dimension is less than 500,000.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The irreps of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. For this problem, $n=25$.\n2.  First, we need a way to generate all unique integer partitions of 25. An integer partition of 25 is a set of positive integers that sum to 25 (e.g., (25), (24, 1), (23, 2), (23, 1, 1), etc.).\n3.  For each partition, we will calculate the dimension of its corresponding irrep. The dimension can be calculated using the **Hook Length Formula**.\n4.  The Hook Length Formula states that the dimension $d_{\\lambda}$ of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ is:\n    $d_{\\lambda} = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{ij}}$\n    where the product in the denominator is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$.\n5.  The hook length $h_{ij}$ for a cell is the number of cells to its right in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus one (for the cell itself).\n6.  We will implement a Python script that:\n    a. Generates all partitions of 25.\n    b. For each partition, calculates the dimension of the irrep using the Hook Length Formula. Python's ability to handle arbitrarily large integers is very helpful here, as $25!$ is a large number.\n    c. Checks if the calculated dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n    d. Counts how many partitions satisfy this condition.\n7.  Finally, the script will print the total count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef partitions(n, max_val=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all integer partitions of n.\n    An integer partition is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers.\n    The generator yields partitions as tuples in reverse lexicographical order.\n    For example, for n=4, it yields (4,), (3, 1), (2, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1).\n    \"\"\"\n    if max_val is None:\n        max_val = n\n    if n == 0:\n        yield ()\n        return\n    # 'i' is the first and largest part of the partition.\n    for i in range(min(n, max_val), 0, -1):\n        # The rest of the partition must sum to n-i, and its parts\n        # must be no larger than i to maintain descending order.\n        for p in partitions(n - i, i):\n            yield (i,) + p\n\ndef get_irrep_dimension(n, partition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of an irreducible representation of S_n\n    corresponding to the given partition, using the Hook Length Formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The numerator in the formula is n!\n    numerator = math.factorial(n)\n    \n    # The denominator is the product of all hook lengths.\n    denominator = 1\n    \n    # We iterate through each cell of the Young diagram for the partition.\n    # The row index is 'i' and the column index is 'j'.\n    for i, row_len in enumerate(partition):\n        for j in range(row_len):\n            # Calculate the hook length for the cell at (i, j).\n            \n            # Count cells to the right in the same row, plus the cell itself.\n            hooks_in_row = row_len - j\n            \n            # Count cells below in the same column, plus the cell itself.\n            hooks_in_col = 0\n            for k in range(i, len(partition)):\n                # A cell exists at row k, column j if the length of row k is at least j+1.\n                if partition[k] > j:\n                    hooks_in_col += 1\n                else:\n                    # Since partition parts are sorted in descending order,\n                    # no subsequent row will have a cell in this column.\n                    break\n            \n            # The hook length is the sum of hooks in the row and column,\n            # minus 1 because the cell itself is counted in both.\n            hook_length = hooks_in_row + hooks_in_col - 1\n            denominator *= hook_length\n    \n    # The dimension is guaranteed to be an integer.
