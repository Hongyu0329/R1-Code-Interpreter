    "In poker, specifically No-Limit Hold'em, the range of hands you should play (or \"open\") from the button is the widest of any position. This is because you are in the latest position and are guaranteed to act last after the flop. In a rake-free environment, this incentive is even stronger, leading to an even wider opening range.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine the worst suited Jack to open:\n\n1.  **List all Suited Jack Hands:** We will consider all hands where the Jack is the highest card and the hand is suited. These are JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s. (Hands like AJs, KJs, QJs are significantly stronger and are always opens).\n2.  **Rank the Hands:** We will rank these hands from best to worst based on two key principles:\n    *   **Connectivity:** How close the two cards are. Closer cards (like in JTs) have a higher probability of making a straight.\n    *   **Kicker Strength:** The value of the lower card. If you make a pair of Jacks, a higher kicker is better.\n3.  **Identify the Worst Hand:** Based on this ranking, the hand at the bottom of the list will be the \"worst\" one. In standard game theory optimal (GTO) play for this scenario, all of these suited Jacks are profitable to open-raise. The \"worst\" one is simply the one with the lowest expected value that is still profitable to play. J2s is the least connected and has the weakest kicker, making it the weakest hand in this group.\n\nThe following Python code will list these hands and identify the worst one based on this logic.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB cash game.\n\n    The ranking is based on connectivity and kicker strength. A hand like JTs is best\n    because it's a suited connector. The value decreases as the second card gets lower.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # List of suited Jack hands (where Jack is the high card), ranked from best to worst.\n    # Note: AJs, KJs, and QJs are stronger and always considered opens.\n    ranked_suited_jacks = [\n        \"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\",\n        \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"\n    ]\n\n    # In a standard 100BB rake-free button opening range, all of the hands above\n    # are considered profitable opens.\n    # The \"worst\" hand is the one at the end of this ranked list.\n    worst_hand = ranked_suited_jacks[-1]\n\n    print(\"Poker Hand Analysis: Worst Suited Jack to Open from the Button\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"In a 100BB game, the button should open a wide range of hands.\")\n    print(\"This includes all suited Jacks because of their flush potential and high card value.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe rank suited Jacks based on connectivity and kicker strength:\")\n    print(ranked_suited_jacks)\n    print(\"\\nThe hand with the lowest rank, J2s, is the least connected and has the weakest kicker.\")\n    print(\"While still a profitable open, it has the lowest expected value of the group.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The worst suited Jack you should open is: {worst_hand}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
