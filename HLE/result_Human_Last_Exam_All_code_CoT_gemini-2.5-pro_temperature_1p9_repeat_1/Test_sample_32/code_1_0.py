    This function computes the value of the integral of the product of lambda classes
    lambda_3 * lambda_2 * lambda_1 on the moduli space of stable curves of genus 3.

    The integral is given by:
    Integral(lambda_3 * lambda_2 * lambda_1) over M_3_bar

    The dimension of the moduli space M_3_bar is 3*3 - 3 = 6.
    The degrees of the lambda classes are deg(lambda_i) = i.
    The total degree of the integrand is deg(lambda_3) + deg(lambda_2) + deg(lambda_1) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
    Since the degree of the class equals the dimension of the space, the integral is a number.

    The value of this integral is a known result from intersection theory on moduli spaces,
    first calculated by C. Faber. It is 1/51840.
