    "My plan is to determine the duration of the Second Great War based on the established StarCraft lore timeline.\n\n1.  **Establish Start Date:** The war began in the year 2504 with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*.\n2.  **Establish End Date:** The war concluded in the year 2508 with the events of the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue, *Into the Void*.\n3.  **Calculate Duration:** I will subtract the start year from the end year to find the total duration.\n4.  **Round Up:** The result is a whole number, so rounding it up will not change its value.\n5.  **Construct Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the full equation and result as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# According to StarCraft lore, the Second Great War starts in 2504\n# and concludes in the epilogue in 2508.\nstart_year = 2504\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The problem asks to round up, which doesn't change an integer result.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\nprint(f\"The Second Great War in StarCraft lore started in the year {start_year} and ended in the year {end_year}.\")\nprint(f\"To find the duration, we calculate the difference.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {end_year} - {start_year} = {final_duration}\")\nprint(f\"The war lasted for {final_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
