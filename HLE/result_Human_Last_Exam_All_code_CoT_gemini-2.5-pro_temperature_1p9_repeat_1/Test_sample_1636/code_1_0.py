    explanation = """
    To understand why the author says the sea 'measures and re-measures/distance', we can break down the poem's imagery:

    1.  The primary action is 'measures and re-measures'. This implies a constant, cyclical process. The most direct and powerful cycle associated with the sea is the ebb and flow of the tides. The changing tide line physically alters the distance from the shore to the water, making the tide a form of measurement. This covers the idea of an immediate, physical distance.

    2.  The poem's final line is 'And the moon unveils herself.' The introduction of the moon is a key element. Scientifically and symbolically, the moon governs the tides through its gravitational pull.

    3.  By connecting the sea's action (tides) with the appearance of the moon (the cause of tides), the poem links two distinct scales of distance. The sea's 'measuring' is the tangible effect on Earth of the vast, cosmic distance to the moon.

    Therefore, the line evokes two ideas of distance: the immediate, ever-changing distance on the shoreline, and the immense, causal distance to the moon. Option E best captures this dual meaning, linking the sea's immediate activity to the distant moon that drives it.
