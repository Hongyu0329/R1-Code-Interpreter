# The task is to identify the major product when (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is
# treated with potassium tert-butoxide.

# Step 1: This is an E2 elimination reaction due to the strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide)
# reacting with a secondary alkyl halide.

# Step 2: The E2 reaction requires a trans-diaxial arrangement of the leaving group (Br)
# and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon.

# Step 3: The stereochemistry (1S,2R) indicates a 'cis' relationship between the bromo and methyl groups.
# The most stable chair conformation places the larger methyl group in the equatorial position and
# the bromo group in the axial position. This axial bromo group is correctly oriented for an E2 reaction.

# Step 4: There are two possible protons that can be removed:
# a) The axial proton on C2, leading to the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).
# b) The axial proton on C6, leading to the Hofmann product (3-methylcyclohexene).

# Step 5: Potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base. It preferentially attacks the less
# sterically hindered proton. The proton on C6 is more accessible than the proton on C2 (which is near the methyl group).
# Therefore, the Hofmann product is the major product.

# Step 6: Identify and print the name of the Hofmann product.
product_name = "3-methylcyclohexene"
