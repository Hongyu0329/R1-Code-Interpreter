    "This is an E2 elimination reaction. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reagents and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which is a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong and sterically bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Substrate**: The (1S, 2R) configuration on a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane means the substituents (bromo and methyl) have a `cis` relationship, i.e., they are on the same face of the ring.\n3.  **Analyze the Chair Conformation**: For a `cis`-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, one substituent must be axial and the other equatorial. The ring will adopt the conformation that places the larger group in the more stable equatorial position. The methyl group is larger than the bromo group, so the most stable conformer has an **equatorial methyl group** and an **axial bromo group**.\n4.  **Apply E2 Reaction Geometry**: The E2 reaction requires a specific geometry where the leaving group (Br) and the proton (H) to be removed are anti-periplanar. In a cyclohexane chair, this means they must both be in axial positions, but on adjacent carbons and pointing in opposite directions (trans-diaxial). Since the stable conformer has an axial bromo group, it is already set up for an E2 reaction.\n5.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways**: We need to find axial protons on the carbons adjacent to the one bearing the bromine (C1).\n    *   **At C2**: This carbon has the equatorial methyl group. Its other substituent is an axial proton. Removing this proton (which is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine) leads to the formation of **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted (trisubstituted) alkene, known as the Zaitsev product.\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two protons, one axial and one equatorial. Removing the axial proton (which is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine) leads to the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted (disubstituted) alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n6.  **Determine the Major Product**: The outcome of the reaction (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann product) depends on the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is a very bulky base. Due to steric hindrance, it preferentially abstracts the most sterically accessible proton. The axial proton on C6 is on a simple `-CH2-` group and is much more accessible than the axial proton on C2, which is hindered by the adjacent equatorial methyl group. Therefore, the bulky base will favor the formation of the Hofmann product.\n\nThe major product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the major product when (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is\n# treated with potassium tert-butoxide.\n\n# Step 1: This is an E2 elimination reaction due to the strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide)\n# reacting with a secondary alkyl halide.\n\n# Step 2: The E2 reaction requires a trans-diaxial arrangement of the leaving group (Br)\n# and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon.\n\n# Step 3: The stereochemistry (1S,2R) indicates a 'cis' relationship between the bromo and methyl groups.\n# The most stable chair conformation places the larger methyl group in the equatorial position and\n# the bromo group in the axial position. This axial bromo group is correctly oriented for an E2 reaction.\n\n# Step 4: There are two possible protons that can be removed:\n# a) The axial proton on C2, leading to the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).\n# b) The axial proton on C6, leading to the Hofmann product (3-methylcyclohexene).\n\n# Step 5: Potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base. It preferentially attacks the less\n# sterically hindered proton. The proton on C6 is more accessible than the proton on C2 (which is near the methyl group).\n# Therefore, the Hofmann product is the major product.\n\n# Step 6: Identify and print the name of the Hofmann product.\nproduct_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\nprint(\"The name of the product is:\")\nprint(product_name)\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
