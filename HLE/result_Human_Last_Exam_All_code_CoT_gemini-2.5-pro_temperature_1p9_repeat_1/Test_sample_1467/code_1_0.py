    This script explains and prints the complexity classes for two transformer scenarios.
    
    Question 1: What is the complexity class of constant precision transformers?
    
    Explanation:
    1.  A "constant precision" transformer uses numbers with a fixed number of bits (e.g., 8-bit or 16-bit floats).
    2.  The fundamental operations in a transformer are arithmetic (matrix multiplication, addition) and non-linear functions (like softmax).
    3.  On constant-precision numbers, all these operations can be performed by circuits of constant depth and polynomial size. Specifically, they require threshold gates (e.g., for adding many numbers), which places them in the class TC0 (Constant-Depth Threshold Circuits).
    4.  A standard transformer has a fixed, constant number of layers. Composing a constant number of TC0 circuits results in a circuit that is still in TC0.
    5.  Therefore, a constant-depth, polynomial-width, constant-precision transformer is in TC0. The formal equation can be written as: Complexity = TC^0.

    """
    Question 2: If we allow polynomial steps of chain-of-thought reasoning, what complexity class does it represent?
    
    Explanation:
    1.  "Polynomial steps of chain-of-thought" means the transformer model is applied sequentially for a number of steps that is a polynomial in the input size, `n`. The output of one step is used as input for the next.
    2.  This creates an inherently sequential computation. We cannot parallelize these steps into a constant-depth circuit.
    3.  We established that a single pass of the transformer (the base model) is in TC0. Any function in TC0 can be computed in Polynomial Time on a sequential machine like a Turing machine.
    4.  The total computation involves running a polynomial-time algorithm for a polynomial number of times (`p(n)` steps).
    5.  The total time is `(number of steps) * (time per step) = p(n) * PolyTime(n)`, which is still polynomial time.
    6.  The class of problems solvable in polynomial time is P.
