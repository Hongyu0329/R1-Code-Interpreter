    "To determine the musical note that corresponds to the specified color range, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Colors:** The problem specifies a range between two colors.\n    *   The first color is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In subtractive color mixing (like with paints), yellow and blue combine to make **green**.\n    *   The second color is **blue** itself.\n    *   Therefore, the range is from **Green** to **Blue**.\n\n2.  **Recall Newton's Color-Music Analogy:** Isaac Newton associated the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale. His mapping is as follows:\n    *   Red → C (Do)\n    *   Orange → D (Re)\n    *   Yellow → E (Mi)\n    *   **Green → F (Fa)**\n    *   **Blue → G (Sol)**\n    *   Indigo → A (La)\n    *   Violet → B (Si)\n\n3.  **Map the Color Range to the Musical Range:**\n    *   The color Green corresponds to the musical note **F**.\n    *   The color Blue corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n    *   The range is from Green (F) to Blue (G).\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Note:** The question asks for the single musical note that \"corresponds to the range\". Since the range is defined as starting from the result of the mix (Green) and ending at a specific color (Blue), the note associated with that endpoint, Blue, is the most logical answer. The note for Blue is **G**.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this logic to arrive at the solution.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step 1: Define Newton's mapping of colors to musical notes.\n# We use an ordered dictionary to maintain the sequence of the spectrum.\nnewton_color_music_map = collections.OrderedDict([\n    ('Red', 'C'),\n    ('Orange', 'D'),\n    ('Yellow', 'E'),\n    ('Green', 'F'),\n    ('Blue', 'G'),\n    ('Indigo', 'A'),\n    ('Violet', 'B')\n])\n\n# Step 2: Identify the colors in the problem description.\n# The first color is the combination of yellow and blue.\ncolor_mix_result = 'Green'\n# The second color is explicitly stated.\nend_color = 'Blue'\n\nprint(f\"The problem asks for the musical note corresponding to the range between two colors.\")\nprint(f\"First color: The result of mixing Yellow and Blue, which is {color_mix_result}.\")\nprint(f\"Second color: {end_color}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Find the corresponding musical notes using the map.\nstart_note = newton_color_music_map.get(color_mix_result, 'Unknown')\nend_note = newton_color_music_map.get(end_color, 'Unknown')\n\n# Step 4: Present the logical deduction.\nprint(\"According to Newton's color-music analogy:\")\nprint(f\"The color '{color_mix_result}' corresponds to the musical note '{start_note}'.\")\nprint(f\"The color '{end_color}' corresponds to the musical note '{end_note}'.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nprint(f\"The specified range is from {color_mix_result} ({start_note}) to {end_color} ({end_note}).\")\nprint(f\"The musical note for the endpoint of this range, '{end_color}', is the answer.\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The note is {end_note}.\")\n\n```\n<<<G>>>"
