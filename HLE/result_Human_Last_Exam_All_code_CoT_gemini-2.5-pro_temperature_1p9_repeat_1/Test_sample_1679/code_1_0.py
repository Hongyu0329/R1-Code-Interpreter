def find_first_movie_with_obelisk():
    """
    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.

    This function simulates a database search. The data is based on film history research,
    as a program cannot "watch" movies. The two Luxor Obelisks are in Luxor, Egypt,
    and Paris, France. The search focuses on finding the earliest Best Picture winner
    set in one of these locations that shows the monument.
