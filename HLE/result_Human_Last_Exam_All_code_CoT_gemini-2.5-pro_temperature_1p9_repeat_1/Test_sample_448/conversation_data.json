    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the rarest noble gas and its percentage.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  I will first identify the noble gases and their respective abundances. The most common and standard measurement for the abundance of these gases is their concentration in the Earth's atmosphere, measured in percentage by volume. Although the question asks about \"all terrestrial matter,\" the atmosphere is the primary reservoir for free noble gases, and the relative order of rarity is the same. The year 2002 does not change these fundamentally stable figures.\n2.  I will create a Python dictionary to store the names of the noble gases and their percentage abundances. This includes Radon, which, despite being radioactive, is a naturally occurring noble gas and is known to be the rarest.\n3.  The Python script will then find the gas with the minimum percentage from this dictionary.\n4.  To meet the specific requirement to \"output each number in the final equation,\" I will construct and print a string that represents the comparison of all the abundance values to find the minimum, showing it as an equation.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the name of the rarest noble gas and its percentage.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Define a dictionary with the noble gases and their atmospheric abundance in percent.\n# The abundance of Radon is extremely low and variable; this is an estimated average value.\nnoble_gas_abundances = collections.OrderedDict({\n    \"Helium\": 0.000524,\n    \"Neon\": 0.001818,\n    \"Argon\": 0.934,\n    \"Krypton\": 0.000114,\n    \"Xenon\": 0.0000087,\n    \"Radon\": 6e-18,\n})\n\n# Step 3: Find the rarest gas (the one with the minimum abundance).\nrarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundances, key=noble_gas_abundances.get)\nrarest_gas_percentage = noble_gas_abundances[rarest_gas_name]\n\n# Step 4: Format the search for the minimum value as an equation,\n# fulfilling the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement.\nall_percentages = list(noble_gas_abundances.values())\nequation_str = f\"min({', '.join(map(str, all_percentages))}) = {rarest_gas_percentage}\"\n\nprint(\"To find the rarest noble gas, we compare their atmospheric percentages:\")\nprint(equation_str)\nprint(\"\\n---\\n\")\n\n# Step 5: Print the conclusion.\nprint(f\"The minimum percentage in the comparison is {rarest_gas_percentage}%.\")\nprint(f\"This percentage corresponds to the noble gas: {rarest_gas_name}.\")\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage is {rarest_gas_name} with approximately {rarest_gas_percentage}% abundance in the atmosphere.\")\n\n```\n<<<6e-18>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
