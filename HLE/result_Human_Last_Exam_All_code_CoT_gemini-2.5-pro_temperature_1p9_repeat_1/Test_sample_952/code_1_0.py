    Solves the diamond arrangement problem.

    The problem asks for the largest integer k such that for every valid arrangement
    of diamonds on a 2024 x 2024 grid, there are at least k movable diamonds.
    This value k is the minimum number of movable diamonds over all possible valid arrangements.

    A valid arrangement has at most one diamond per cell and no two diamonds on adjacent cells.
    A diamond is movable if it can be moved to an adjacent empty cell and the new arrangement
    is still valid.

    To find the minimum, we can construct a specific arrangement and calculate the number of
    movable diamonds for it. If we can find an arrangement with zero movable diamonds,
    then the minimum k must be 0.

    Consider the checkerboard arrangement where a diamond is placed on every cell (i, j)
    for which i + j is even. Let's call this set of cells 'A'.
    This is a valid arrangement because all neighbors of such a cell are cells where the
    sum of coordinates is odd, so no two diamonds are adjacent.

    Now, let's analyze if any diamond in this arrangement is movable.
    - Pick a diamond at a cell C (where i + j is even).
    - To move it, we select an adjacent cell C' (where i' + j' must be odd).
    - The new arrangement A' = (A \\ {C}) U {C'} is valid if and only if C' is not
      adjacent to any cell in A \\ {C}.
    - Let's look at the neighbors of C'. Any neighbor of C' is a cell where the
      coordinate sum is even (a 'black' cell), and thus contains a diamond in arrangement A.
    - Any cell in a grid of size >= 2x2 has at least 2 neighbors. So, C' has at least
      one neighbor other than C, let's call it C''.
    - Since C'' is a 'black' cell and is not C, there is a diamond on C'' in the original
      arrangement A. This diamond remains in the set A \\ {C}.
    - This means the new diamond at C' would be adjacent to the diamond at C'', which
      violates the condition.
    - This is true for any diamond in arrangement A and any potential move.

    Therefore, in the checkerboard arrangement on the 2024 x 2024 grid, there are
    exactly 0 movable diamonds.

    Since we have found an arrangement with 0 movable diamonds, the minimum number `k`
    over all arrangements must be at most 0. As the count of movable diamonds cannot be negative,
    k must be exactly 0.

    There is no complex equation to solve; the answer is derived logically.
