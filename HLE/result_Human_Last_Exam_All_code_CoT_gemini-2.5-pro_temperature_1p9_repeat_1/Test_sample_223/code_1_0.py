def solve_chairs_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the chair puzzle based on logical deduction.

    Let N be the number of chairs.
    The number of occupied chairs (k) can only increase if a person sits in a chair
    such that both adjacent chairs are empty. This is an "augmenting" move.

    The process of increasing the number of chairs stops when there are no more
    such empty spots. This happens when all empty chairs are isolated between
    occupied chairs, forming a pattern like P_P_P...

    In such a pattern, for k people, there are k-1 empty chairs between them.
    There can also be empty chairs at the ends.
    Let e_start and e_end be the number of empty chairs at the start and end (0 or 1).
    Total chairs N = k (occupied) + (k-1) (gaps) + e_start + e_end
    N = 2k - 1 + e_start + e_end
    2k = N + 1 - (e_start + e_end)

    For N=20: 2k = 21 - (e_start + e_end)
    To maximize k, we need an integer solution.
    If (e_start + e_end) = 1, then 2k = 20, which means k = 10.
    If (e_start + e_end) is 0 or 2, 2k is odd, which has no integer solution for k.

    Thus, the maximum number of chairs that can be occupied is 10.
    The final configuration could be: P_P_P_P_P_P_P_P_P_P_ (10 people, 10 empty chairs).
    Or _P_P_P_P_P_P_P_P_P_P (also 10 people).
    """
    num_chairs = 20
    # Based on the logic 2k = N + 1 - (e_start + e_end), we find the maximum k.
    # To get an even number on the right side for 2k, N+1-(e_start+e_end) must be even.
    # N+1 = 21. So 21 - (e_start+e_end) must be even. This requires (e_start+e_end) to be odd.
    # Since e_start and e_end can only be 0 or 1, their sum must be 1.
    # 2k = 21 - 1 = 20
    max_occupied = (num_chairs + 1 - 1) / 2
    
    # We can model one possible final equation, representing P_P_..._P_
    # 10 people + 10 empty chairs = 20 total chairs

    num_empty_ends = 1     # e.g., an empty chair at the end of the row
