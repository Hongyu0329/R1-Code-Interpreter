    "My approach to solving this puzzle is to first deduce the transformation rule from the given input-output examples and then apply that rule to the new input to find the missing output.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Examples:** I will represent the comma-separated strings as 2D grids of characters and compare the input and output grids for `Input_A`/`Output_A` and `Input_B`/`Output_B` to identify the pattern of changes.\n2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** Based on the analysis, the change appears to be centered around the digit '2'. The '2' seems to move to a new position, leaving a '0' in its original place. My hypothesis is that the '2' attempts to move one step diagonally upward. It prioritizes a move to the top-right position if it's empty ('0'). If not, it attempts to move to the top-left position if that is empty. If neither move is possible, it stays put.\n3.  **Verify the Rule:** I will test this rule against both provided examples (A and B) to ensure it consistently produces the correct output.\n    *   **Example A:** `(1,1)` is '2'. Top-right `(0,2)` is '1' (blocked). Top-left `(0,0)` is '0' (free). The '2' moves to `(0,0)`. This matches `Output_A`.\n    *   **Example B:** `(3,6)` is '2'. Top-right `(2,7)` is '0' (free). The '2' moves to `(2,7)`. This matches `Output_B`.\n4.  **Apply the Rule to Input C:** I will apply the verified rule to `Input_C` to calculate the `MISSING` value. In `Input_C`, the '2' is at `(1,4)`. Its top-right neighbor at `(0,5)` is '0', so the '2' will move there.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script to implement this logic. The script will parse the input string, locate the '2', apply the move logic, and then format the resulting grid back into the required output string format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by transforming the input grid based on a discovered rule.\n    The rule is that a '2' moves diagonally up-right if the target cell is '0',\n    otherwise it tries to move diagonally up-left if that target cell is '0'.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_c = '000000,011120,111111'\n\n    # Step 1: Parse the input string into a 2D grid\n    rows_str = input_c.split(',')\n    grid = [list(row) for row in rows_str]\n\n    if not grid or not grid[0]:\n        print(input_c)\n        return\n\n    num_rows = len(grid)\n    num_cols = len(grid[0])\n\n    # Step 2: Find the location of '2'.
