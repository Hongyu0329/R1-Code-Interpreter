    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the price and quantity where the supply and demand curves intersect. After finding the equilibrium point (Qe, Pe), we can calculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus. The sum of these two surpluses gives us the total welfare.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Supply and Demand Functions:** We will represent the given supply `P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)` and demand `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_D))` as Python functions.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium (Qe, Pe):** We will find the point where supply equals demand by numerically solving the equation `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` for the equilibrium quantity `Qe`. Then, we'll substitute `Qe` back into either function to find the equilibrium price `Pe`.\n3.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):** Consumer surplus is the area between the demand curve and the equilibrium price line. It's calculated by the integral of the demand function from 0 to `Qe`, minus the total revenue (`Pe * Qe`).\n    *   CS = `∫[0 to Qe] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - Pe * Qe`\n4.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):** Producer surplus is the area between the equilibrium price line and the supply curve. It's calculated as the total revenue (`Pe * Qe`) minus the integral of the supply function from its starting quantity (`Q > 2^(1/3)`) up to `Qe`.\n    *   PS = `Pe * Qe - ∫[2^(1/3) to Qe] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n5.  **Calculate Total Welfare (TW):** The total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus: `TW = CS + PS`.\n\nWe will use Python's `scipy` library for numerical solving and integration.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# 1. Define supply and demand functions\ndef supply_func(q):\n    \"\"\"Defines the supply function P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\"\"\"\n    if q**3 <= 2:\n        return np.nan # Not defined for q <= 2^(1/3)\n    return np.log(q**3 - 2)\n\ndef demand_func(q):\n    \"\"\"Defines the demand function P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\"\"\"\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\n# 2. Find market equilibrium\n# We need to solve demand_func(q) - supply_func(q) = 0\ndef equilibrium_difference(q):\n    # This check ensures the function is well-behaved for the solver\n    if q**3 <= 2:\n        # Return a large positive value if q is too low, as demand price will be higher than supply price\n        return 1.0 \n    return demand_func(q) - supply_func(q)\n\n# Solving numerically. A quick check shows the root is between 4 and 5.\n# equilibrium_difference(4) is positive, equilibrium_difference(5) is negative.\nsolution = root_scalar(equilibrium_difference, bracket=[4, 5], method='brentq')\nQ_e = solution.root\nP_e = demand_func(Q_e)\n\n# 3. Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS)\n# CS = Integral(Demand) from 0 to Q_e - P_e * Q_e\nintegral_demand, _ = quad(demand_func, 0, Q_e)\nconsumer_surplus = integral_demand - P_e * Q_e\n\n# 4. Calculate Producer Surplus (PS)\n# PS = P_e * Q_e - Integral(Supply) from Q_min to Q_e\n# The supply function is defined for Q > 2^(1/3)\nq_min_supply = (2)**(1/3)\nintegral_supply, _ = quad(supply_func, q_min_supply, Q_e)\nproducer_surplus = P_e * Q_e - integral_supply\n\n# 5. Calculate Total Welfare (TW)\ntotal_welfare = consumer_surplus + producer_surplus\n\n# Print all the calculated values\nprint(f\"Market Equilibrium:\")\nprint(f\"Equilibrium Quantity (Qe): {Q_e:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Equilibrium Price (Pe): {P_e:.4f}\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"Surplus Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"Consumer Surplus: {consumer_surplus:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Producer Surplus: {producer_surplus:.4f}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The Final Equation for Total Welfare is:\")\nprint(f\"Total Welfare = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus\")\nprint(f\"Total Welfare = {consumer_surplus:.4f} + {producer_surplus:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Total Welfare = {total_welfare:.4f}\")\n\n<<<22.0122>>>\n```"
