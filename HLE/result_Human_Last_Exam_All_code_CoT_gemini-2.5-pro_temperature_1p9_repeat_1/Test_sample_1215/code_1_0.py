    print("1. The problem asks for the minimum number of variables in a formula ψ that is logically equivalent to φ.")
    print("   This minimum number is equal to the number of essential variables in φ. Let's call this number k.")
    print("   Since φ is not a tautology or a contradiction, it must depend on at least one variable. So, k ≥ 1.\n")

    print("2. Let's use the properties of φ to find a constraint on k.")
    print("   φ has n variables and is true for 2^(n-1) assignments.")
    print("   The number of satisfying assignments for φ can also be expressed using k.")
    print("   Let φ' be the simplified version of φ using only its k essential variables.")
    print("   Let N_k be the number of satisfying assignments for φ' (out of 2^k total assignments).")
    print("   The n-k non-essential variables can be assigned any value, so each satisfying assignment of φ' corresponds to 2^(n-k) assignments for φ.")
    print("   This gives the equation: (Number of satisfying assignments for φ) = N_k * 2^(n-k).\n")

    print("3. Now, we solve for N_k.")

    print("   The formula φ'(p1) = p1 is true only when p1 is True, so it has exactly 1 satisfying assignment.\n")

    print("   We have shown that it's possible for the number of essential variables to be k=1.")
    print("   Since we already established that k must be at least 1, the minimum possible value for k is 1.")
    print("   To confirm, the formula φ(p1, p2, ..., pn) = p1 defined on n ≥ 2 variables satisfies all the conditions of the problem and has k=1 essential variable.")
