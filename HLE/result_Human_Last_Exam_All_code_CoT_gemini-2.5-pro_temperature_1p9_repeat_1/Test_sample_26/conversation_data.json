    "This problem requires concepts from algebraic topology and algebraic geometry to determine the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$, for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its free part, which can be found by tensoring the group with the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  Establish the basic topological properties of $X$ and the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n2.  Calculate the Betti numbers of $X$ using standard formulas from algebraic geometry, such as the adjunction formula and Noether's formula.\n3.  Use the long exact sequence of homology for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ to compute the relative homology groups $H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n4.  Apply the relative Hurewicz theorem to relate these relative homology groups to the relative homotopy groups $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n5.  Analyze the long exact sequence of homotopy for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n6.  By examining the ranks of the groups in this sequence, we can deduce that $\\pi_3(X)$ is a torsion group, which means its rank is 0.\n\nThe following Python script carries out the numerical calculations needed for this argument and presents the logical steps to reach the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef nCr(n, r):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the binomial coefficient 'n choose r'.\"\"\"\n    return math.comb(n, r)\n\n# --- Step 1: Define parameters ---\n# X is a smooth hypersurface of degree d in CP^n.\nn = 3\nd = 5\n# The complex dimension of X is n-1.
