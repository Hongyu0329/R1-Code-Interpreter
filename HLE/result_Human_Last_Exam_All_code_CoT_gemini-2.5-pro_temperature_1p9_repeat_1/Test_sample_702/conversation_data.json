    "This problem asks for the connectivity of a specific map in algebraic topology. The solution relies on a known theorem regarding such maps.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the map and spaces**: The map is $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. This is a well-known map in homotopy theory, related to the Samelson product.\n2.  **Recall the relevant theorem**: A key result by F. Cohen, T. Lada, and J.P. May gives the connectivity of this type of map. The theorem states that for the map $\\alpha_{m,n}: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^{m+1} \\wedge \\Omega S^{n+1}) \\to \\Omega(S^{m+1} \\wedge S^{n+1})$, the connectivity is $m+n+1$. A map is $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\pi_i$, is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i = k$.\n3.  **Apply the theorem to the specific case**: Our map involves the spheres $S^4$ and $S^6$. We can match this to the theorem's notation $S^{m+1}$ and $S^{n+1}$.\n    *   $m+1 = 4 \\implies m = 3$.\n    *   $n+1 = 6 \\implies n = 5$.\n4.  **Calculate the connectivity**: Using the formula from the theorem, the connectivity is $k = m + n + 1$.\n5.  **Construct the Python code**: I will write a Python script that states the theorem, performs the calculation step-by-step showing all the numbers involved in the final equation, and prints the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_connectivity_of_map():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map\n    Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)\n    based on a theorem from algebraic topology.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The dimensions of the spheres in the problem.\n    d1 = 4\n    d2 = 6\n\n    print(\"The problem is to find the connectivity of the map:\")\n    print(f\"f: Sigma(Omega S^{d1} wedge Omega S^{d2}) -> Omega(S^{d1} wedge S^{d2})\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"To solve this, we use a standard result from algebraic topology concerning this map,\")\n    print(\"which is related to the Samelson product.\")\n    print(\"\")\n    \n    print(\"The theorem states that for a map of the form\")\n    print(\"alpha_{m,n}: Sigma(Omega S^{m+1} wedge Omega S^{n+1}) -> Omega(S^{m+1} wedge S^{n+1}),\")\n    print(\"the connectivity is given by the formula k = m + n + 1.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"In our case, we have spheres S^4 and S^6, so we match the dimensions:\")\n    print(f\"m + 1 = {d1}\")\n    print(f\"n + 1 = {d2}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Calculate m and n\n    m = d1 - 1\n    n = d2 - 1\n\n    print(\"Solving for m and n:\")\n    print(f\"m = {d1} - 1 = {m}\")\n    print(f\"n = {d2} - 1 = {n}\")\n    print(\"\")\n    \n    # Calculate the connectivity using the formula\n    connectivity = m + n + 1\n    \n    print(\"Now we can calculate the connectivity k using the formula k = m + n + 1.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{m} + {n} + 1 = {connectivity}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"Therefore, the connectivity of the map is:\")\n    print(connectivity)\n\n# Execute the function to find the answer.\ncalculate_connectivity_of_map()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
