    "Of course. Here is my analysis and the Python code to explain the result.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the core physical principle:** Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\n2.  **Determine the material requirement:** Such processes are only possible in materials that have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (denoted as χ⁽²⁾).\n3.  **Relate the requirement to material symmetry:** Due to fundamental symmetry principles, χ⁽²⁾ is strictly zero for any material that has a center of inversion (is centrosymmetric).\n4.  **Evaluate the material in question:** Free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), in their common and stable crystalline phases (e.g., β₁₂ and χ₃), are centrosymmetric.\n5.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Since boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their χ⁽²⁾ is zero, and they are not expected to exhibit SPDC.\n6.  **Code the logic:** I will write a Python script that walks through this logical chain and prints the conclusion clearly.\n\n```python\ndef check_spdc_capability(material_name, is_centrosymmetric):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a material is expected to exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)\n    based on its crystal symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the potential for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) in:\", material_name)\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the fundamental requirement for SPDC.\n    print(\"Step 1: SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect.\")\n    print(\"         Its occurrence depends on a material property called the second-order\")\n    print(\"         nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as chi_2 (χ⁽²⁾).\")\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the role of material symmetry.\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: A material's crystal symmetry dictates whether chi_2 is zero or non-zero.\")\n    print(\"         For materials that have a center of inversion (are centrosymmetric),\")\n    print(\"         chi_2 is required by symmetry to be zero.\")\n    print(\"         Therefore, only non-centrosymmetric materials can exhibit SPDC.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Apply this principle to the specific material.\n    print(f\"\\nStep 3: Evaluating the crystal structure of {material_name}.\")\n    if is_centrosymmetric:\n        print(f\"         Research shows that the common, stable phases of free-standing\")\n        print(f\"         {material_name} (borophene) are centrosymmetric.\")\n        chi_2 = 0\n    else:\n        # This case is not applicable for borophene but is included for completeness.\n        print(f\"         {material_name} is found to be non-centrosymmetric.\")\n        chi_2 = \"non-zero\" \n\n    # Step 4: Formulate the conclusion based on the derived value of chi_2.\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Based on the symmetry, the value for the key parameter is determined.\")\n    print(f\"         The equation for the bulk second-order susceptibility is: chi_2 = {chi_2}\")\n\n    if chi_2 == 0:\n        conclusion = (\n            f\"Conclusion: No. Bulk, free-standing {material_name} are NOT expected to exhibit\\n\"\n            \"            spontaneous parametric downconversion.

This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to lack inversion symmetry (i.e., be non-centrosymmetric). Common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry, meaning their second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero, which forbids this process.>>>"
