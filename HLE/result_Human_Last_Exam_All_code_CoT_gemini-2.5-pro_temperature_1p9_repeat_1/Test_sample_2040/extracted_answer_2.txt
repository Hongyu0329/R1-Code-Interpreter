No, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to lack inversion symmetry (i.e., be non-centrosymmetric). Common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry, meaning their second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero, which forbids this process.
