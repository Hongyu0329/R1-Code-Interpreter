    "To determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄), we need to review the established chemical synthesis methods.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The most common method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride is the direct reaction between Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F₂) gas. The balanced chemical equation is Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄.\n2.  **Analyze reaction conditions:** This synthesis is an equilibrium reaction that requires energy input (heating) to proceed at a practical and efficient rate.\n3.  **Determine the optimal temperature:** Chemical literature and textbooks establish that heating the reactants in a nickel vessel to **400 °C** is the standard condition for achieving a good yield of XeF₄ efficiently.\n    *   Temperatures significantly lower than 400 °C result in a very slow reaction rate, making the process inefficient.\n    *   Temperatures significantly higher (e.g., 600 °C) and with excess fluorine tend to favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆), reducing the efficiency and purity of the desired XeF₄ product.\n4.  **Select the best answer:** Based on this, 400 °C is the coldest temperature among the given choices that allows for the *efficient* synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n5.  **Implement in code:** I will write a Python script that states these facts, prints the reaction equation with its numerical components, and programmatically identifies the correct choice from the provided list.\n\n```python\ndef solve_xenon_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the conditions for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) synthesis\n    to find the coldest efficient temperature from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Answer choices provided in the problem\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": 600,\n        \"B\": 400,\n        \"C\": 200,\n        \"D\": 78,\n        \"E\": 0,\n        \"F\": -78\n    }\n\n    # Established efficient temperature for the synthesis\n    efficient_synthesis_temp = 400\n\n    print(\"The efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is achieved by the direct reaction of Xenon and Fluorine.\")\n    print(\"The chemical equation for this reaction is: Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄\")\n    \n    # As requested, outputting each number in the final equation\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in the final balanced equation are:\")\n    coefficient_F2 = 2\n    subscript_in_F2 = 2\n    subscript_in_XeF4 = 4\n    \n    print(f\" - The coefficient for Fluorine (F₂) is: {coefficient_F2}\")\n    # Note: subscript numbers are also numbers in the equation's representation\n    print(f\" - The subscript for Fluorine (F₂) is: {subscript_in_F2}\")\n    print(f\" - The subscript for Fluorine in the product Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is: {subscript_in_XeF4}\")\n\n\n    print(f\"\\nThis reaction is typically heated to achieve an efficient rate.\")\n    print(f\"The standard temperature for this process is {efficient_synthesis_temp}°C.\")\n    print(\"Lower temperatures result in an impractically slow reaction, while higher temperatures can produce undesired byproducts like XeF₆.\")\n    \n    # Find the letter corresponding to the correct temperature\n    correct_choice_letter = None\n    for letter, temp in choices.items():\n        if temp == efficient_synthesis_temp:\n            correct_choice_letter = letter\n            break\n    \n    if correct_choice_letter:\n        print(f\"\\nFrom the choices provided, {efficient_synthesis_temp}°C corresponds to option {correct_choice_letter}.\")\n        print(f\"Therefore, it is the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can still be produced efficiently.\")\n        print(f\"<<<{correct_choice_letter}>>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nThe standard efficient temperature was not found in the answer choices.\")\n\nsolve_xenon_synthesis()\n```"
