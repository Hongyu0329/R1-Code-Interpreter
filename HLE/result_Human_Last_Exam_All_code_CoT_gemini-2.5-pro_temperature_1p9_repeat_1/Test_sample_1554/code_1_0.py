# He distinguished between:
# 1. Symptoms (oznaki): Natural signs causally linked to what they signify (e.g., smoke is a symptom of fire).
# 2. Signals (sygna≈Çy): Conventional signs established by rule to communicate or cause a reaction (e.g., a bell ringing to signal the start of a class).

# The answer is the name of this philosopher.
philosopher_name = "Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz"
