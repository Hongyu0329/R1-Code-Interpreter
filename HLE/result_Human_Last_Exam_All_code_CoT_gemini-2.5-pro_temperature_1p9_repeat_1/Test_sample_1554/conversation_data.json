    "The user is asking a knowledge-based question about a philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School. The specific concept to identify the philosopher by is the decomposition of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Search my knowledge base for philosophers associated with the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n2.  Within that group, identify the philosopher whose work in semiotics or epistemology includes the distinction between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals).\n3.  The philosopher who made this specific distinction is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n4.  As per the instructions, I will write a simple Python script to store this name in a variable and then print it as the answer.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking to identify a specific philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n# The key distinction is the decomposition of a sign or \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n# This work is a core part of the semiotic theory of Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n# He distinguished between:\n# 1. Symptoms (oznaki): Natural signs causally linked to what they signify (e.g., smoke is a symptom of fire).\n# 2. Signals (sygna≈Çy): Conventional signs established by rule to communicate or cause a reaction (e.g., a bell ringing to signal the start of a class).\n\n# The answer is the name of this philosopher.\nphilosopher_name = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n\n# Print the final answer.\nprint(philosopher_name)\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
