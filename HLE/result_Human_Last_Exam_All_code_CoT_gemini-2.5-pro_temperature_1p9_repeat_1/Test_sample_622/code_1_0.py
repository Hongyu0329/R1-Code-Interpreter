    print("   - The pronoun 'She' is the subject and 'c-commands' the R-expression 'Mary' in the object position.")
    print("   - Principle C states that an R-expression (like 'Mary') must be 'free,' meaning it cannot be c-commanded by a co-referential noun phrase.")

    # --- Analysis of Sentence B ---
    sentence_b = "B. Whose does John like glasses?"

    print("   - This sentence is ungrammatical, but not due to a binding principle violation.")
    print("   - It is an incorrectly formed question from a statement like 'John likes Mary's glasses'.")
    print("   - The error is a violation of a syntactic movement rule (the Left Branch Condition), which prevents extracting a possessor ('Whose') from a noun phrase while leaving the noun ('glasses') behind.")
    print("   - The correct question would be 'Whose glasses does John like?'.")
    print("   - CONCLUSION: This sentence is ungrammatical due to a movement constraint, not a binding principle violation.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Sentence C ---
    sentence_c = "C. Who does John like Mary and?"
    print(sentence_c)
    print("   - This sentence is also ungrammatical, and like B, the reason is a movement constraint.")
    print("   - It attempts to form a question by moving 'who' (corresponding to 'himself') out of a coordinate structure ('Mary and himself').")
    print("   - This violates the Coordinate Structure Constraint, which prohibits moving an element out of a conjoined phrase.")
    print("   - CONCLUSION: This sentence is ungrammatical due to a movement constraint, not a binding principle violation.\n")
