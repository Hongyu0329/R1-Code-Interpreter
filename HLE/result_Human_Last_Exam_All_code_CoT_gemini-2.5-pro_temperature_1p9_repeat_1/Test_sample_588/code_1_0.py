def solve_and_print_tuple():
    """
    This function calculates and prints the lexicographically least tuple
    (a_1, b_1, ..., a_l, b_l) based on the problem's conditions.

    The derivation is based on interpreting the "full" property of a manifold M
    as the vanishing of its Euler characteristic, chi(M) = 0.
    This leads to the equation:
        l - 1 = 2 * sum((1 - a_i) * (1 - b_i) for i in 1..l)
    where a_i, b_i != 1.

    The minimal length `l` is found to be 3, which gives the condition:
        sum((1 - a_i) * (1 - b_i) for i in 1..3) = 1.

    To find the lexicographically smallest tuple, we choose the smallest possible
    pairs (a, b) that satisfy the sum. The combination of C values {1, 1, -1}
    is achieved with the set of pairs {(0,0), (0,0), (0,2)}.

    When sorted and flattened, these pairs give the lexicographically smallest tuple.

    # The pairs, sorted lexicographically:
    p1 = (0, 0)
    p2 = (0, 0)
    p3 = (0, 2)
    
    # The final tuple
    final_tuple = p1 + p2 + p3
    
    # The prompt requires the final answer formatted as a flat tuple.
    # We will print the numbers of the tuple in the required format.
