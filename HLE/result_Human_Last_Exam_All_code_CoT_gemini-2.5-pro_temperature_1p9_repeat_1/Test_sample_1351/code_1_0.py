    This function solves the stingray duo problem as specified.
    
    (a) We determine if a (3,2)-stingray duo in GL_5(4) is always irreducible.
        A known result states that for d=e1+e2, a stingray duo is reducible if and only if
        U1=F2 and U2=F1. Since pairs satisfying this can be constructed, the answer is No.

    (b) The conditions for reducibility are U1=F2 and U2=F1. These correspond to
        options (2) and (3). Condition (1) F1 intersect F2 != {0} is shown to be impossible
        for a stingray duo when d=e1+e2.

    (c) We calculate the proportion of irreducible (3,2)-stingray duos among all such duos.
        This proportion is 1 - P(reducible).
        The probability of a duo being reducible is the probability that F1=U2 and F2=U1.
        For a given decomposition V = U1 (+) U2, there are q^(e1*e2) choices for the complement F1 of U1,
        and q^(e2*e1) choices for the complement F2 of U2.
        The reducible case corresponds to one specific choice for each.
        The probability of reducibility is (1/q^(e1*e2)) * (1/q^(e2*e1)) = 1/q^(2*e1*e2).
