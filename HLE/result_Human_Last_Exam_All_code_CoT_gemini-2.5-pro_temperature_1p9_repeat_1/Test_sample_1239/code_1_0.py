# Task: Calculate the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the 
# incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.

# The dimension is the sum of the number of parameters for each independent symmetry.

# 1. Time translation (t -> t + a)
# This transformation has one parameter.
time_translation = 1

# 2. Space translations (x -> x + b)
# In R^3, this is a vector with 3 components.
space_translations = 3

# 3. Space rotations (x -> R*x)
# The group of rotations in 3D, SO(3), has 3 dimensions.
space_rotations = 3

# 4. Galilean boosts (v -> v + u, x -> x + u*t, ...)
# The boost velocity vector 'u' has 3 components.
galilean_boosts = 3

# 5. Scaling transformation
# There is a single-parameter family of scaling transformations that
# leaves the equations invariant.
scaling = 1

# 6. Pressure shift (p -> p + c)
# The equations only depend on the gradient of the pressure, so shifting
# the pressure by a constant is a symmetry. This has one parameter.
pressure_shift = 1

# The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions from each symmetry.
