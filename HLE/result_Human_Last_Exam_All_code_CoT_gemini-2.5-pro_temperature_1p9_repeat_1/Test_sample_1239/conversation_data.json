    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to find all the continuous transformations of the independent variables (time and space) and dependent variables (velocity and pressure) that leave the equations invariant. This is a standard problem in the group analysis of differential equations.\n\nThe full symmetry group is actually infinite-dimensional, due to the pressure term's \"gauge freedom\" (since only its gradient appears, an arbitrary function of time can be added to it). However, the standard question refers to the dimension of the *maximal finite-dimensional* symmetry subgroup.\n\nThis finite-dimensional group is composed of the following transformations:\n\n1.  **Time translation**: Shifting the time origin. This provides 1 dimension.\n2.  **Space translations**: Shifting the spatial origin in any of the 3 directions. This provides 3 dimensions.\n3.  **Spatial rotations**: Rotating the coordinate system in 3D space. The rotation group SO(3) is 3-dimensional.\n4.  **Galilean boosts**: Shifting to a uniformly moving reference frame. Since the velocity boost can be in any of the 3 directions, this provides 3 dimensions.\n5.  **Scaling (or Dilation)**: A specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure that leaves the equations invariant. This is a single transformation type, providing 1 dimension.\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of the dimensions from each of these independent symmetry types. The following Python code calculates and explains this sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of\n    symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The dimension of the Lie group is the number of independent parameters\n    # defining the symmetry transformations.
