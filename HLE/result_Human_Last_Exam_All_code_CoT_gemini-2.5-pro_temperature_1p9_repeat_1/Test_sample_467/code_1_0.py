# The task is to find the Morse index of a minimal surface M
# whose Gauss map is g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).

# For a complete minimal surface of genus zero and finite total curvature,
# the Morse index is given by the Lopez-Ros formula: Index = d + p - 2
# d = degree of the Gauss map g(z)
# p = number of ends of the surface (poles of g(z))

# 1. Define the numerator and denominator of the Gauss map.
#    g(z) = N(z) / D(z)
#    N(z) = z
#    D(z) = z^3 + 2

# 2. Determine the degrees of the polynomials.
deg_numerator = 1
deg_denominator = 3

# 3. Calculate the degree 'd' of the Gauss map.
#    d is the maximum of the degrees of the numerator and denominator.
d = max(deg_numerator, deg_denominator)

# 4. Calculate the number of ends 'p'.
#    p is the number of poles, which is the degree of the denominator.
p = deg_denominator

# 5. Calculate the Morse index using the formula.
morse_index = d + p - 2

# 6. Print the explanation and the result.

print("The formula is: Index = d + p - 2")
print(f"The degree of the Gauss map, d, is the maximum degree of the numerator (deg={deg_numerator}) and the denominator (deg={deg_denominator}), so d = {d}.")
print(f"The number of ends, p, is the number of poles, which is the degree of the denominator, so p = {p}.")
print("Plugging the values into the formula:")
