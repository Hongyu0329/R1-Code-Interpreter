    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will first analyze the system's behavior in the phase plane. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that divides trajectories with different qualitative behaviors. These are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle-type equilibrium points.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the equilibrium points:** We first find the points $(d, u)$ where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are zero to understand the long-term behavior of the system.\n    *   The equation $u'(t) = u^2(t)(u(t)-1) = 0$ gives equilibrium lines at $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n    *   For $u=0$, the first equation becomes $d' = 2d^2$, so $d=0$ is the equilibrium. This gives the point $(0, 0)$.\n    *   For $u=1$, the first equation becomes $d' = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1)$, so $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives the points $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n    *   We have three equilibrium points: $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(-1,1)$.\n\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points:** We compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluate its eigenvalues at each point to determine their stability. The Jacobian matrix is:\n    $J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   At $(0, 1)$, $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are 1 and 2 (both positive), so this is an unstable node (a source).\n    *   At $(-1, 1)$, $J = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are -2 and 1 (one positive, one negative), so this is a saddle point. Saddle points are crucial for finding separatrices.\n\n3.  **Find the equation for trajectories (separatrix):** We derive the equation for the trajectories in the $(u, d)$ phase plane by considering $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$.\n    $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1 - u)}{u^2(u - 1)}$\n    This is a Riccati differential equation, which is generally hard to solve. However, we can try to find a particular solution, especially one that corresponds to a separatrix. A separatrix often connects two equilibrium points. The unstable manifold of the saddle point $(-1,1)$ is a separatrix.\n\n4.  **Find a particular solution:** We will guess a simple polynomial form for the solution, $d(u)$. Let's try $d(u) = C u^k$. By balancing the powers of $u$ in the equation, the form $d(u) = C u^2$ appears promising. Let's substitute $d(u) = Cu^2$ and its derivative $\\frac{dd}{du} = 2Cu$ into the Riccati equation:\n    $2Cu = \\frac{2(Cu^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(Cu^2) + u^4 - u^3}{u^3 - u^2}$\n    Simplifying this algebraic equation, we find that it holds for all $u$ if we choose $C = -1$.\n    Thus, $d(u) = -u^2$ is a particular solution.\n\n5.  **Verify the separatrix:** Let's check if this solution corresponds to a separatrix.\n    *   The curve $d = -u^2$ passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$, since for $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$.\n    *   It also passes through the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$.\n    *   The unstable manifold at the saddle point $(-1, 1)$ must be tangent to the corresponding eigenvector. The eigenvector for the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda=1$ of $J(-1,1)$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which implies a slope of $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2/1 = -2$ at this point.\n    *   The slope of our solution curve $d = -u^2$ at $u=1$ is $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2)|_{u=1} = -2u|_{u=1} = -2$.\n    *   Since the curve passes through the saddle point and its slope matches the direction of the unstable manifold, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point and therefore is the primary separatrix of the system.\n\nThe following Python code defines the parameters of this equation and prints the result.\n\n```python\n# The separatrix of the system is given by an equation of the form d = a * u**b.\n# This script defines the values of the coefficient 'a' and the exponent 'b'\n# and then prints the final equation.\n\n# Define the coefficient 'a'\na = -1\n\n# Define the exponent 'b'\nb = 2\n\n# Print the values of the parameters.\nprint(f\"The equation for the separatrix is of the form: d = a * u**b\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient a is: {a}\")\nprint(f\"The exponent b is: {b}\")\n\n# Print the final equation for the separatrix.\nprint(f\"The separatrix is given by the equation: d = {a} * u**{b}\")\n\n```\n<<<d = -u**2>>>"
