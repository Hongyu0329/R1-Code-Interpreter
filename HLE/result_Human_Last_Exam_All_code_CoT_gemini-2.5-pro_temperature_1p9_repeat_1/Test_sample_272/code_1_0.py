    # The symbol for infinity is represented as 'oo' in strings.

    # H has torsion, so cd(H) is infinite.

    # (2) What is the cohomological dimension of G?
    # G contains H, so G also has torsion, and cd(G) is infinite.

    # (3) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of H?
    # H is virtually Z, cd(Z)=1. So vcd(H)=1.
    ans3 = 1

    # (4) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of G?
    # G is virtually a free group, cd(F_r)=1 for r>0. So vcd(G)=1.
    ans4 = 1

    # (5) How many ends does H have?
    # H is virtually Z, so it has 2 ends.
    ans5 = 2

    # (6) How many ends does G have?
    # G is a non-trivial free product of infinite groups, so it has infinitely many ends.
    ans6 = "oo"

    # (7) What is the cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
    # P is the trivial group {1} for odd prime p. cd({1}) = 0.
    ans7 = 0
    
    # (8) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
    # P is the trivial group {1}. vcd({1}) = 0.
    ans8 = 0

    # (9) What is the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(G,F_p)?
    # Hom(G, F_p) is the trivial group since p is odd. The dimension is 0.
