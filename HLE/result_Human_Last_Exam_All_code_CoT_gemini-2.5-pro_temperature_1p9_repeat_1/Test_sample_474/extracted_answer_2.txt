The proposed approach is not fully valid because it uses a human visual model (untrained undergraduates) as a proxy for the relevant predator's visual system, which is the key driver of mimicry's ecological function. Predators, like birds, have different visual capabilities (e.g., UV vision) and learn to avoid warning signals through experience, aspects which are not captured by this methodology. While it might provide a preliminary hypothesis, it could lead to ecologically inaccurate conclusions.
