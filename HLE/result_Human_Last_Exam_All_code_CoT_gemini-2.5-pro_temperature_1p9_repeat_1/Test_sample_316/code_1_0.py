def find_critical_exponent():
    """
    This function identifies the second critical exponent for the given reverse square function estimate.

    The problem asks for the critical exponents of the exponent `alpha` in the inequality:
    ||f||_L^p <= R^alpha * || (sum|f_theta|^2)^(1/2) ||_L^p

    It's given that `alpha` is piecewise linear in 1/p, and the slope changes at two points.
    One critical exponent is p1 = 4.

    The other critical exponent in R^3 for cone-related restriction problems is a famous result
    from harmonic analysis, established by the work of Bourgain and Guth. This exponent marks the
    transition from estimates based on bilinear interactions to those requiring more complex
    multilinear methods.
