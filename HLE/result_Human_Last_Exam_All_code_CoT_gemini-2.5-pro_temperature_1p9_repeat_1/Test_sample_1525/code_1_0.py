    Analyzes each statement and counts the number of correct ones.
    
    A. The recursive definition of P_k introduces an order-dependence.
       Analysis: The order is defined as "order of appearance", and the final set
       is order-independent. So, the statement is incorrect.
    
    B. The claim that γ[γ⁻¹[P]] = P is not generally true.
       Analysis: Applying γ to any segregated program P' results in P. Thus, applying γ to
       the set γ⁻¹[P] results in {P}. The claim holds under this interpretation.
       So, the statement is incorrect.
       
    C. γ⁻¹[γ[P]] might not be identical to P.
       Analysis: Aggregation γ is potentially lossy (many-to-one). Segregation γ⁻¹
       cannot uniquely recover the original program. So, the statement is correct.
       
    D. It's not clear if γ⁻¹[S₀] generates all combinations or is ambiguous.
       Analysis: The definition uses a union operator, which clearly implies
       generating all combinations. It is not ambiguous. So, the statement is incorrect.
       
    E. The claim means coarse-grained inference causes no information loss.
       Analysis: The equation γ(refined_computation) = coarse_computation is a formal
       statement of soundness and completeness, meaning the coarse-grained computation
       lacks no information compared to the refined one. So, the statement is correct.
