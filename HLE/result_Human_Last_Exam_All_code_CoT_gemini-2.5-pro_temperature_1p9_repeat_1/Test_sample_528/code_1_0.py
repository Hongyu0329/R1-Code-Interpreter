# Plan:
# The problem is to count the number of set tuples (S1, S2, S3, S4) such that
# S1 is a subset of S2, S2 of S3, S3 of S4, and S4 of {1,2,3,4,5}.
# And i is an element of Si for i = 1, 2, 3.

# We can solve this by considering where each element from {1,2,3,4,5} can be placed.
# This creates 5 disjoint regions: S1, S2\S1, S3\S2, S4\S3, and {1,2,3,4,5}\S4.

# Choices for element 1: 1 must be in S1.
# This gives 1 choice.
c1 = 1

# Choices for element 2: 2 must be in S2.
# It can be in S1 or S2\S1.
# This gives 2 choices.
c2 = 2

# Choices for element 3: 3 must be in S3.
# It can be in S1, S2\S1, or S3\S2.
# This gives 3 choices.
c3 = 3

# Choices for element 4: No constraints.
# It can be in any of the 5 regions.
# This gives 5 choices.
c4 = 5

# Choices for element 5: No constraints.
# It can be in any of the 5 regions.
# This gives 5 choices.
c5 = 5

# Total number is the product of choices for each element.
total_sets = c1 * c2 * c3 * c4 * c5

print(f"The total number of sets is the product of the number of choices for each element's placement.")
print(f"The final calculation is: {c1} * {c2} * {c3} * {c4} * {c5} = {total_sets}")
