    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the personalities and roles of each character in Andrei Tarkovsky's \"Solaris\" in relation to the film's central themes of memory, humanity, and Earth.\n\n1.  **Kris Kelvin:** He is the protagonist, a psychologist sent from Earth. The film opens and closes with him at his family's dacha on Earth, surrounded by nature. While he is deeply connected to Earth, he is a recent arrival to the space station and is the one to whom the other characters confess their feelings.\n2.  **Hari:** She is a \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his deceased wife. She has no actual memories of Earth and yearns for a human experience she can never truly have. She wouldn't miss something she has never known.\n3.  **Dr. Snaut:** He is one of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He has been in space for a long time and has grown cynical and introspective. He often engages Kris in philosophical discussions about humanity's purpose and its disconnection from its home. It is very much in his character to feel a deep, almost shameful nostalgia for simple, natural phenomena.\n4.  **Dr. Sartorius:** The other surviving scientist, Sartorius is cold, rational, and obsessed with the scientific aspects of their predicament. He suppresses his emotions and would likely view missing something like rustling leaves as a contemptible weakness, not something to confess.\n5.  **Gibarian:** He was Kris's friend and a crew member who committed suicide before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a video recording he left for Kris, expressing his despair. While he was desperate, the specific quote is from a living character.\n\nBased on this analysis, Dr. Snaut is the most likely character to have this specific feeling of shame mixed with homesickness. In a key monologue, he confesses this very feeling to Kris, lamenting how far they've strayed from Earth and their own humanity.\n\nI will now write a Python script that states this reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines which character in the 1972 movie 'Solaris'\n    is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    question = \"In the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie Solaris which character is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Kris',\n        'B': 'Hari',\n        'C': 'Snaut',\n        'D': 'Sartorius',\n        'E': 'Gibarian'\n    }\n\n    # Step 1: Provide the detailed reasoning for the correct answer.\n    explanation = (\n        \"In the film, the character Dr. Snaut has a conversation with Kris Kelvin where he discusses\\n\"\n        \"the psychological toll their long mission has taken.
