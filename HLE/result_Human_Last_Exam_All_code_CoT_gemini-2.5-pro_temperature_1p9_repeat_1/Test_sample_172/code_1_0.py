def solve_chromatic_number():
    """
    Calculates the correspondence chromatic number of a graph derived from a cycle
    where each edge is replaced by multiple parallel edges.

    The starting graph is C_100, a cycle graph with 100 vertices. In a cycle,
    each vertex is connected to two others, so its degree in the simple graph is 2.
    Each of these edges is replaced by 1234 parallel edges.

    The correspondence chromatic number (or DP-chromatic number) for this type of
    multigraph is given by the formula d*m + 1, where 'd' is the degree of each
    vertex in the simple graph and 'm' is the multiplicity of each edge.

    In our case:
    d = 2 (from C_100)
    m = 1234 (the number of parallel edges)
    """

    # Degree of each vertex in the simple cycle graph C_100
    d = 2

    # Number of parallel edges replacing each original edge
    m = 1234

    # The formula for the correspondence chromatic number is d * m + 1
    result = d * m + 1

    print("The graph is derived from a cycle graph C_100.")
