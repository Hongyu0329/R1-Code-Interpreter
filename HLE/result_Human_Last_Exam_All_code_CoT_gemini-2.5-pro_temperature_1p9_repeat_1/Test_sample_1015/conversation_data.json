    "My plan is to first understand the technical differences between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods regarding the ballet step *cambré derrière* (a bend of the upper body backwards). I will then map these differences to the given answer choices to find the most accurate one. The Python code will serve to explain this reasoning and print the final conclusion.\n\n1.  **Vaganova Method:** This Russian method is known for its strictness and precision. In a *cambré derrière*, the Vaganova technique insists that the dancer's hips remain perfectly square and aligned. The bend should come purely from the spine, primarily the upper and middle back, creating a clean, pure arc. The stability of the hips is paramount.\n\n2.  **Balanchine Method:** Developed by George Balanchine for the New York City Ballet, this American style is known for its speed, musicality, and neo-classical lines. In a Balanchine *cambré derrière*, the dancer is often encouraged to lift and open the hip. This creates a spiral effect in the torso and allows for a visually deeper, more dynamic, and off-balance line. It sacrifices the strict squareness of the hips for a more expressive and extended aesthetic.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Choices:**\n    *   A. Arm placement during allongé: While minor stylistic differences exist, this is not the primary distinction.\n    *   B. Placement of hip: This is the core difference. Vaganova demands square hips; Balanchine allows an open, lifted hip.\n    *   C. Speed: Speed is determined by the musical accompaniment for the specific exercise, not the method for this particular step.\n    *   D. Degree of backbend: The different hip placement in the Balanchine method *enables* a different quality and sometimes a deeper backbend, but the root cause of the difference is the hip placement itself. Therefore, 'B' is the more fundamental answer.\n    *   E. Placement of head: Head placement is generally similar in both (following the line of the arm/shoulder), and it's not the defining difference.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The most significant and defining difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine *cambré derrière* is the placement of the hip. The Python code below will outline this logic.\n\n```python\ndef explain_ballet_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the primary difference between a cambré derrière\n    in the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods and selects the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the key characteristic of each method for a cambré derrière.\n    vaganova_principle = \"Hips must remain square and stable.\"\n    balanchine_principle = \"Hip is allowed to lift and open, creating a spiral.\"\n\n    # Define the answer choices.\n    answer_choices = {\n        'A': \"Arm placement during allongé\",\n        'B': \"Placement of hip\",\n        'C': \"Speed\",\n        'D': \"Degree of backbend\",\n        'E': \"Placement of head\"\n    }\n\n    # Print the analysis.\n    print(\"Analyzing the Cambré Derrière:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Vaganova Method Principle: {vaganova_principle}\")\n    print(f\"Balanchine Method Principle: {balanchine_principle}\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The fundamental difference between the two styles for this step is how the hips are used.\")\n    print(\"This directly corresponds to the answer choice regarding the 'Placement of hip'.\")\n\n    # State the final answer clearly.\n    final_answer_key = 'B'\n    final_answer_text = answer_choices[final_answer_key]\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct option is B: {final_answer_text}\")\n\n# Run the explanation function.\nexplain_ballet_difference()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
