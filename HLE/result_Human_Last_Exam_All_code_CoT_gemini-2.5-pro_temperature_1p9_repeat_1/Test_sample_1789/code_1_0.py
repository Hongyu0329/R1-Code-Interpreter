# Plan:
# 1. Calculate the total number of divisors of N = 823564528378596.
#    N = 2^2 * (product of 21 distinct odd primes).
#    The number of divisors d(N) is (2+1) * 2^21.
# 2. Identify the 4 smallest layers in the divisor poset D(N), graded by Omega(d).
#    These are the layers S_0, S_1, S_22, and S_23.
# 3. Calculate the size of these 4 layers.
#    |S_0|: {1}, size = 1.
#    |S_1|: The 22 prime divisors of N, size = 22.
#    |S_23|: {N}, size = 1.
#    |S_22|: The divisors of form N/p, where p is a prime factor of N. There are 22 such divisors. size = 22.
# 4. Subtract the sum of the sizes of the 4 smallest layers from the total number of divisors.

# Total number of prime factors: 2 (from 2^2) + 21 (from the 21 distinct odd primes) = 23.
# This means the ranks Omega(d) go from 0 to 23. There are 24 layers.
# We need to sum the sizes of the 20 largest layers, which means removing the 4 smallest.

# Number of divisors calculation
# exponents of prime factors of N are 2, and 1 (21 times)
total_divisors = (2 + 1) * (2**21)

# Sizes of the 4 smallest layers
s0 = 1
s1 = 22
s22 = 22
s23 = 1
sum_of_smallest_4_layers = s0 + s1 + s22 + s23

# The size of the largest union of 20 antichains is the total number of divisors
# minus the sum of the sizes of the 4 smallest layers.
result = total_divisors - sum_of_smallest_4_layers
