    This script analyzes a poem to find the significance of the word 'opals'.

    # Step 1: Analyze the poem's core contrast.
    print("Step 1: Analyzing the poem's central themes.")
    print("The poem establishes a strong contrast between the woman's past and present life.")
    print("  - Past: Depicted as vibrant, performative, and risky ('theatricals', 'winning streak', 'fixing cards').")
    print("  - Present: Characterized by stillness, age, and fear ('bedbound years', 'nightly fears', 'always cold').")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 2: Deconstruct the specific metaphor of the opals.
    print("Step 2: Deconstructing the line: 'Her keepsake eyes are opals'.")
    print("  - 'Keepsake eyes': This phrase explicitly connects her eyes to her memories, which are the 'keepsakes' of her life.")
    print("  - 'Opals': Opals are unique gemstones known for their 'play-of-color'. They contain shifting, kaleidoscopic flashes of light and color that change with the angle of view. They have depth and a 'fire' within them.")
    print("  - The metaphor equates the rich, multifaceted, and shimmering quality of her inner world of memory with the physical appearance of an opal.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis.
    print("Step 3: Evaluating the provided choices.")
    print("  - A, B, F: These are too narrow. The metaphor is richer than just 'Decay', 'Transformation', or 'Bad luck'.")
    print("  - C, D, G: These are plausible but less precise. 'Complexity', 'Complex emotions', and 'Secrecy' are all components, but they don't fully capture the 'shifting' and 'memory-focused' aspects.")
    print("  - E. The shifting depth of memories: This is the most accurate and comprehensive choice.")
    print("    - 'Shifting': Perfectly matches the opal's play-of-color and how memories can seem to change, flicker, and resurface ('flew like moths').")
    print("    - 'Depth': Captures the idea of a rich inner life hidden beneath a cold exterior, like the fire inside a stone.")
    print("    - 'Memories': This is the explicit subject of the poem's second half ('long-lost secrets', 'tales... returned').")
    print("-" * 30)
    
    # Step 4: Provide the final answer.
    print("The final conclusion is that the opals symbolize the dynamic and deep nature of her memories.")
    sys.stdout.flush() # Ensure the above text prints before the final answer format.
    print("<<<E>>>")
