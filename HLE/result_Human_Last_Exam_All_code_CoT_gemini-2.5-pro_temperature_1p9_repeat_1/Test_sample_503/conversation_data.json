    "An internal adjunction in a locally posetal 2-category like $\\Delta$ is a pair of morphisms (order-preserving maps) $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ that form a Galois connection. This means that for any element $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, the following equivalence must hold:\n$L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$.\n\nA pair of maps $(L, R)$ forms an adjunction if and only if $L$ is a left adjoint and $R$ is a right adjoint. In the context of posets that are complete lattices (which our finite total orders $[k]$ are), a map is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins), and a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\n\nFor an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ on a total order, preservation of finite non-empty joins is automatic. However, for $L$ to be a left adjoint, it must also preserve the empty join, which is the bottom element of the poset.\n*   The bottom element of $[m]$ is $0$.\n*   The bottom element of $[n]$ is $0$.\n*   Therefore, a left-adjoint map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ must satisfy $L(0) = 0$.\n\nSimilarly, for $R: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a right adjoint, it must preserve the empty meet, which is the top element of the poset.\n*   The top element of $[n]$ is $n$.\n*   The top element of $[m]$ is $m$.\n*   Therefore, a right-adjoint map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ must satisfy $R(n) = m$.\n\nIt can be shown that any order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ with $L(0)=0$ has a unique right adjoint $R$, and conversely, any order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ with $R(n)=m$ has a unique left adjoint $L$.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\nLet $m=23$ and $n=37$. An order-preserving map is defined by the sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(m)$ such that $0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(m) \\le n$.\nWith the constraint $L(0)=0$, we need to find the number of non-decreasing sequences $L(1), \\dots, L(m)$ of length $m$, where each value is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. The number of such sequences is given by the multiset coefficient $\\binom{s+k-1}{k}$, where $k$ is the length of the sequence and $s$ is the number of elements to choose from.\n*   $k = m = 23$ (for the values $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$).\n*   $s = n+1 = 37+1=38$ (the size of the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$).\n\nThe number of such maps is $\\binom{(n+1)+m-1}{m} = \\binom{n+m}{m}$.\nFor our specific case, with $m=23$ and $n=37$, the number is $\\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_adjunction_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of internal adjunctions from [m] to [n]\n    in the simplex category Delta.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the problem\n    m = 23\n    n = 37\n\n    # The number of adjunctions from [m] to [n] is given by the\n    # binomial coefficient C(n+m, m).\n    \n    # Calculate the result\n    result = math.comb(n + m, m)\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the final equation\n    print(f\"The number of internal adjunctions from [{m}] to [{n}] is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, m).\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to counting the number of order-preserving maps L: [m] -> [n] with L(0)=0.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"C({n} + {m}, {m}) = C({n+m}, {m})\")\n    \n    # Print the final numerical answer\n    print(f\"The number of adjunctions is: {result}\")\n    \n    # The final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{result}>>>\")\n\nsolve_adjunction_problem()\n\n```"
