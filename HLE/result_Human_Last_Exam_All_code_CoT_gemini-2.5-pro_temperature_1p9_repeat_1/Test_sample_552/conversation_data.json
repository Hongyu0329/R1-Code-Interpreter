    "I will identify the scientist whose lectures and foundational work Albert Einstein referenced in his groundbreaking 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The key figure in this context is the physicist who developed the statistical mechanics framework that underpins the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, which was essential for Einstein's analysis. I will write a Python script that assigns this scientist's name to a variable and then prints a sentence that answers the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_scientist():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the scientist whose work and lectures\n    were cited by Albert Einstein in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ludwig Boltzmann's work on statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases\n    # was the primary foundation for Einstein's analysis.
