    "The user wants me to solve the initial value problem $x'(t)=(t-1)\\cdot x^2(t)$ with the condition $x(0)=-8$, and find the value of $x(1)$. I will do this by first solving the differential equation analytically and then using a Python script to compute the final value.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Solve the differential equation:** The given equation is a separable differential equation. I will separate the variables ($x$ and $t$) and integrate both sides.\n2.  **Apply the initial condition:** I will use the condition $x(0)=-8$ to find the value of the integration constant, which will give the particular solution for $x(t)$.\n3.  **Find x(1):** I will substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find $x(1)$.\n4.  **Write Python code:** The code will perform the final calculation based on the derived formula for $x(1)$, printing out the numerical equation and the final result as requested.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\nThe differential equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\n\n**1. Separate the variables:**\n$$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt $$\n\n**2. Integrate both sides:**\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nThe integration results in:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the integration constant.\n\n**3. Apply the initial condition $x(0)=-8$:**\nSubstitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\nSo, the particular solution for the initial value problem is:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\nTo make it easier to solve for $x(t)$, let's get a common denominator on the right side:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{4t^2 - 8t + 1}{8} $$\nNow, solving for $x(t)$:\n$$ x(t) = -\\frac{8}{4t^2 - 8t + 1} $$\n\n**4. Find x(1):**\nSubstitute $t=1$ into the solution for $x(t)$:\n$$ x(1) = -\\frac{8}{4(1)^2 - 8(1) + 1} $$\n$$ x(1) = -\\frac{8}{4 - 8 + 1} = -\\frac{8}{-3} = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nNow, here is the Python code to perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The explicit solution to the initial value problem is x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1).\n# We need to find the value of x(1).\n\n# Set the value of t\nt = 1\n\n# Define the terms in the formula\nnumerator = -8\n# We will calculate the denominator: 4*t^2 - 8*t + 1\nterm1 = 4 * (t**2)\nterm2 = -8 * t\nterm3 = 1\ndenominator = term1 + term2 + term3\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in\nprint(\"The solution formula is x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1)\")\nprint(\"Substituting t=1:\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / (4 * ({t})^2 - 8 * ({t}) + 1)\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({term1} {term2} + {term3})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
