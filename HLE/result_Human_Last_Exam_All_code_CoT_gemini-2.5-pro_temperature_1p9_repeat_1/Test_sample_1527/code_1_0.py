# From the geometric analysis of the problem, we derive a quadratic
# equation for the radius 'r' of the first circle.
# The equation is: 1*r^2 - 4*r + 4 = 0

# Define the coefficients of this quadratic equation.
a = 1
b = -4
c = 4

# This equation is a perfect square (r - 2)^2 = 0.
# We can find the root r.
r = 2.0

# Calculate the final required value, r^2.
r_squared = r**2
