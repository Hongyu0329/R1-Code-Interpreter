#
# Let's determine the minimum number of moves for the hyperdimensional knight.
#
# 1. Define problem parameters.
D = 7  # Dimension of the hypercube
N = 3  # Side length, coordinates are in {0, 1, 2}

# 2. Analyze the change required for each coordinate.
# Each coordinate must go from 0 to 2. Modulo 3, this is a net change of -1.
# Let p_i and m_i be the number of +1 and -1 changes on coordinate i.
# We need p_i - m_i = 2 (mod 3).
# The total changes for coordinate i is t_i = p_i + m_i.
# We want to find the minimum value for t_i.
# - If t_i=1: (p_i=0, m_i=1) gives 0 - 1 = -1 = 2 (mod 3). This is the minimum possible.
# - If t_i=2: (p_i=2, m_i=0) gives 2 - 0 = 2 (mod 3). This is the second minimum.

# 3. Calculate the total number of individual changes (T).
# The total number of moves M = T / 2, so T must be even.
# To minimize moves, we try to use the most efficient change (t_i=1) for all D=7 coordinates.
min_T_if_odd_allowed = D * 1

# This sum is 7, which is odd. This is impossible since T must be 2 * M.
# We must find the smallest *even* sum of changes possible.
# We can do this by increasing the sum minimally. We replace one of the t_i=1 values
# with the next smallest possible value, t_j=2.
t_values = [2] + [1] * (D - 1)
min_even_T = sum(t_values)

# 4. Calculate the minimum number of moves from the total changes.
min_moves = min_even_T // 2

# 5. Output the reasoning and the calculation.
print("To solve this, we find the minimum number of total individual +1 or -1 changes required.")
print("Each of the 7 coordinates must change from 0 to 2. The most efficient way for a single coordinate is one '-1' change (since 0-1 = -1, which is 2 mod 3).")
print(f"If all 7 coordinates used this optimal change, the total number of changes would be {D} * 1 = {min_T_if_odd_allowed}.")
print(f"However, the total number of changes must be even, because each move performs exactly two changes. {min_T_if_odd_allowed} is odd.")
print("So, we find the next smallest possible total. We can change one coordinate's path to require 2 changes (two '+1's) instead of 1.")
print(f"The minimum possible set of changes for the 7 coordinates is therefore one coordinate with 2 changes and six coordinates with 1 change each.")

equation_parts = " + ".join(map(str, t_values))
print(f"Minimal even total of changes = {equation_parts} = {min_even_T}")
print(f"Minimum number of moves = Total Changes / 2 = {min_even_T} / 2 = {min_moves}")
print("\nThis is achievable. For instance:")
print("Let c1 be the coordinate with 2 changes (+1, +1), and c2-c7 be the coordinates with 1 change (-1).")
print("Move 1: Apply (+1) to c1 and (-1) to c2.")
print("Move 2: Apply (+1) to c1 and (-1) to c3.")
print("Move 3: Apply (-1) to c4 and (-1) to c5.")
print("Move 4: Apply (-1) to c6 and (-1) to c7.")
print("After these 4 moves, the knight is at (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2).")
