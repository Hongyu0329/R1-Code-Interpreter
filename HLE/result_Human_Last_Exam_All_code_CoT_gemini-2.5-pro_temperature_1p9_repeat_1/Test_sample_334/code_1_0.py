def solve_biometric_challenge():
  """
  Analyzes the cybersecurity requirements for enhancing biometric authentication
  and determines the most suitable solution from the given choices.

  The core problem is that biometrics are unique but not secret. The solution must address:
  1. Prevention of spoofing and replay attacks.
  2. A mechanism for an unwilling (coerced) user to not authenticate.
  3. Resilience against the theft or exposure of the biometric data itself.
  4. Applicability to a wide range of biometric modalities.

  Strong Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), combining a biometric (something you are)
  with a secret PIN (something you know) and a hardware token (something you have),
  is the only solution that robustly addresses all four requirements.

  - Spoofing is mitigated because the other factors are still needed.
  - Coercion is mitigated as the user can withhold the PIN or token, or use a duress code.
  - Data exposure is mitigated because the stolen biometric data is useless without the other factors.
  - It is inherently modality-agnostic.
