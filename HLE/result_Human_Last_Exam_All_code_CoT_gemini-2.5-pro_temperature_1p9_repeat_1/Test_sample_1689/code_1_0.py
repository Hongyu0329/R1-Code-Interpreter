    print("B. KOH preparation: This test is used to diagnose fungal infections. The clinical picture is less consistent with a fungal cause and more with an allergic reaction.")
    print("C. Topical steroid: This is a treatment to manage symptoms, not a diagnostic test to identify the cause.")
    print("D. Patch test: This is the definitive gold-standard test to identify the specific substance (allergen) causing allergic contact dermatitis. Given the suspicion of a reaction to clothing dyes or resins, this is the most logical next step to confirm the diagnosis.")
