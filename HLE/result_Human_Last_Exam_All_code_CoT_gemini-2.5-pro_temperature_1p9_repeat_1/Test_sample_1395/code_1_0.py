# Plan:
# 1. Establish the chromatic number of the Asian graph before and after the Soviet dissolution.
# 2. Calculate the difference, delta_soviet.
# 3. Determine if the graph's planarity changed to set the value of beta.
# 4. Compute the final product of beta and delta_soviet.

# The chromatic number of the complex Asian map before the dissolution is taken as 4, per the Four Color Theorem for complex maps.
chromatic_number_before = 4
print(f"Chromatic number of the Asian graph before dissolution = {chromatic_number_before}")

# After the dissolution, the creation of Central Asian states like Uzbekistan (bordered by a 5-cycle of nations) creates a structure that provably requires 4 colors.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"Chromatic number of the Asian graph after dissolution = {chromatic_number_after}")

# delta_soviet is the change in the chromatic number.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The change in chromatic number, delta_soviet = {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}")

# A graph based on a geographical map is planar. The dissolution changed the map, but it remained a map, so its graph remained planar. Therefore, planarity did not change.
# If planarity did not change, beta = 1.
beta = 1
print(f"Planarity of the graph did not change, hence beta = {beta}")

# The final answer is the product of beta and delta_soviet.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final result is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")
