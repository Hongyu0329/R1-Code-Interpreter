    # Rationale based on clinical evidence:
    # 1. Modality: Arterial duplex ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for
    #    surveillance after lower extremity endovascular intervention. It is more sensitive
    #    than Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) for detecting in-stent restenosis, which is
    #    the primary concern during follow-up.
    # 2. Timing: The risk of restenosis is highest within the first year. Therefore,
    #    surveillance should be performed at regular intervals during this period. A common
    #    and effective schedule includes follow-ups at 3, 6, and 12 months.
    
    # Analysis of the Options:
    # A & C: Incorrect. They rely on ABI, which is not the primary tool for stent surveillance.
    # B: Incorrect. While it uses duplex, it omits the crucial 6-month follow-up.
    # E: Incorrect. Annual follow-up is not frequent enough during the first high-risk year.
    # D: Correct. This option uses the appropriate modality (arterial duplex) and a standard,
    #    effective follow-up schedule (3, 6, 12 months, and then long-term).
