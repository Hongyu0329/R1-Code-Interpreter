        The probability distribution is given by:
        p(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) = A * x1^(x2*x3) * sin(x3*x4) * e^(x2+x3+x4) * (x2+x1)^(x5+x3)

        We identify the interactions (cliques) by looking at which variables are grouped together in the terms:
        - The term x1^(x2*x3) creates a 3-way interaction between {x1, x2, x3}.
        - The term sin(x3*x4) creates an interaction between {x3, x4}.
        - The term (x2+x1)^(x5+x3) creates interactions between {x1, x2, x5} and {x1, x2, x3}.
        - The e^(x2+x3+x4) term corresponds to individual node potentials and doesn't add new interactions beyond those already found.

        The maximal cliques are {x1, x2, x3}, {x3, x4}, and {x1, x2, x5}.
        Based on these cliques, an edge exists between any two variables appearing in the same set.
        The full set of edges is: (x1,x2), (x1,x3), (x2,x3), (x3,x4), (x1,x5), (x2,x5).
