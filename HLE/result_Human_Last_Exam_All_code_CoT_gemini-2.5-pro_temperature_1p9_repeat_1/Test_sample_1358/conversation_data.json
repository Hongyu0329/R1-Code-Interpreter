    "To determine which variable, when conditioned on, turns the distribution into a Markov chain, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Model the distribution as a graph:** The given probability distribution can be represented as an undirected graphical model, also known as a Markov Random Field (MRF). In an MRF, the joint probability distribution factorizes into a product of functions (potentials) defined over cliques in the graph. An edge exists between any two variables that appear together in a factor.\n2.  **Identify the graph's structure:** We will analyze the terms in the given probability formula to identify the cliques (sets of fully interconnected variables) and thus determine the edges of the graph.\n3.  **Analyze the effect of conditioning:** A Markov chain is a special case of an MRF where the graph structure is a simple, unbranched path. Conditioning on a variable is equivalent to removing that variable's node and all its connected edges from the graph. We must check if the remaining graph forms a connected path. The condition that \"none of the variables [are left] completely independent\" means the resulting path graph must be connected (i.e., not have isolated nodes or separate chains).\n4.  **Test each candidate:** We will systematically test conditioning on the variables listed in the options ($x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, etc.) to see which one(s) satisfy the condition.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan by printing out each step of the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Plan:\")\n    print(\"1.
