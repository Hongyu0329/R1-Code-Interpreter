    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we need to find the dimensions of its cohomology groups, $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$. The Poincaré polynomial is then given by $P(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$.\n\nThe cohomology is computed using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. Let $\\{e^1, \\ldots, e^6\\}$ be the basis of the dual space $\\mathfrak{g}^*$, dual to the basis $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ of $\\mathfrak{g}$. The differential $d$ acting on the exterior algebra $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{g}^*)$ is determined by its action on the basis 1-forms. For a 1-form $\\alpha$, the differential is given by $(d\\alpha)(X, Y) = -\\alpha([X, Y])$.\n\nThe non-zero commutation relations are $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, and $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\nLet's compute the differentials of the basis 1-forms $e^i$:\n-   $de^1$: $(de^1)(e_i, e_j) = -e^1([e_i, e_j]) = 0$ for all $i,j$ since $e_1$ is not in the derived algebra. Thus, $de^1 = 0$.\n-   $de^2$: Similarly, $de^2 = 0$.\n-   $de^3$: The only non-zero value is $(de^3)(e_1, e_2) = -e^3([e_1, e_2]) = -e^3(e_3) = -1$. This corresponds to the 2-form $-e^1 \\wedge e^2$. So, $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$.\n-   $de^4$: $(de^4)(e_1, e_3) = -e^4([e_1, e_3]) = -e^4(e_4) = -1$. So, $de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$.\n-   $de^5$: Similarly, $de^5 = 0$.\n-   $de^6$: $(de^6)(e_1, e_5) = -e^6([e_1, e_5]) = -e^6(e_6) = -1$. So, $de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$.\n\nThe differential $d_k: \\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{g}^*) \\to \\Lambda^{k+1}(\\mathfrak{g}^*)$ is a linear map. We can represent it as a matrix and compute the dimensions of its kernel ($Z^k = \\ker d_k$) and image ($B^{k+1} = \\text{im } d_k$). The Betti numbers are then given by $b_k = \\dim H^k = \\dim Z^k - \\dim B^k$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this procedure to calculate the Betti numbers and construct the Poincaré polynomial.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom math import comb\n\ndef get_basis_map(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Creates a mapping from a tuple of indices to a column index.\"\"\"\n    basis = list(combinations(range(n), k))\n    basis_map = {b: i for i, b in enumerate(basis)}\n    return basis, basis_map\n\ndef get_differential_matrix(n, k, lie_brackets):\n    \"\"\"Computes the matrix of the differential d_k.\"\"\"\n    # Basis for domain Lambda^k and codomain Lambda^{k+1}\n    k_basis, k_basis_map = get_basis_map(n, k)\n    k1_basis, k1_basis_map = get_basis_map(n, k + 1)\n    \n    # Dimensions of spaces\n    dim_k = comb(n, k)\n    dim_k1 = comb(n, k + 1)\n    \n    if dim_k == 0 or dim_k1 == 0:\n        return np.zeros((dim_k1, dim_k)), k_basis_map, k1_basis_map\n    \n    # Matrix representation of d_k\n    matrix = np.zeros((dim_k1, dim_k))\n    \n    # Dual of the Lie bracket action on basis\n    de = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    for (i, j), v in lie_brackets.items():\n        # de^v = -e^i wedge e^j\n        de[v].append((-(1.0), i, j))\n        \n    for idx_col, basis_vec in enumerate(k_basis):\n        # Apply d to basis_vec = e^{i_1} wedge ... wedge e^{i_k}\n        # d(w1 wedge w2) = dw1 wedge w2 + (-1)^deg(w1) w1 wedge dw2\n        # Apply this rule iteratively\n        \n        current_form = {} # Represents the resulting (k+1)-form\n        \n        for p, i in enumerate(basis_vec):\n            sign = (-1)**p\n            for term_val, term_i, term_j in de[i]:\n                # term is term_val * (e^term_i wedge e^term_j)\n                # We wedge with the rest of the original basis_vec\n                \n                wedge_product = [b for q, b in enumerate(basis_vec) if q != p]\n                wedge_product.insert(0, term_j)\n                wedge_product.insert(0, term_i)\n                \n                # Canonical ordering and sign calculation\n                wedge_product.sort()\n                \n                # Calculate permutation sign\n                perm_sign = 1\n                temp_list = list(basis_vec)\n                temp_list.pop(p)\n                test_prod = [term_i, term_j] + temp_list\n                for x_idx in range(len(test_prod)):\n                    for y_idx in range(x_idx + 1, len(test_prod)):\n                        if test_prod[x_idx] > test_prod[y_idx]:\n                            perm_sign *= -1\n\n                # If contains duplicates, it's zero\n                if len(set(wedge_product)) != len(wedge_product):\n                    continue\n                \n                final_sign = sign * perm_sign\n                \n                new_key = tuple(wedge_product)\n                current_form[new_key] = current_form.get(new_key, 0) + term_val * final_sign\n\n        for form_basis, form_coeff in current_form.items():\n            if form_basis in k1_basis_map:\n                idx_row = k1_basis_map[form_basis]\n                matrix[idx_row, idx_col] = form_coeff\n\n    return matrix\n\n# Lie algebra definition for g\nn_dim = 6\n# Brackets are [e_i, e_j] = e_k.
