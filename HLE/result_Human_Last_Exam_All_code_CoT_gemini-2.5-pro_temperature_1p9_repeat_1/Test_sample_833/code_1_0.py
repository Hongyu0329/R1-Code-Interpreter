# The lower bound 'a' is a constant derived from the analysis of the PDE.
# The analysis shows that the expression is bounded below by -max(u(1-u))/2.
# We need to find the maximum value of the function f(u) = u*(1-u) for u in [0, 1].
u = sp.Symbol('u')
f = u * (1 - u)

# Find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to 0.
f_prime = sp.diff(f, u)
critical_points = sp.solve(f_prime, u)

# The critical point within the interval [0, 1] is u = 1/2.
# We check the value of f(u) at the critical point and at the boundaries of the interval [0, 1].
u_crit = critical_points[0]
max_f = f.subs(u, u_crit)

# The lower bound 'a' is -max(f)/2.
a = -max_f / 2

# Print the equation representing the final answer
