    "Of course, I can help with that. The task is to evaluate a complex SKI combinator expression that represents a Church integer `n`, and then find the base-2 logarithm of that integer, `log_2(n)`.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Expression:** I'll start by breaking down the SKI expression into smaller, recognizable components. The expression contains several well-known combinators that represent numbers and operations.\n2.  **Identify Church Numerals:** I'll identify the parts of the expression that correspond to Church numerals, which are functional representations of integers. Specifically:\n    *   `I` (Identity) represents the number 1 (`c_1`).\n    *   `S(I)(I)` reduces to the number 2 (`c_2`).\n    *   `S(S(K(S))(K))` is a standard, albeit complex, representation for the number 2 (`c_2`).\n3.  **Apply Evaluation Rules:** The expression involves applying these Church numerals to one another. I'll use the fundamental rule of Church numeral application, which corresponds to multiplication: applying numeral `c_m` to numeral `c_n` yields a new numeral `c_{m*n}`. The entire expression will be evaluated by repeatedly applying the SKI reduction rules and this multiplication rule.\n4.  **Calculate n:** By evaluating the expression from the inside out, I will determine the final integer value `n`. I will show the arithmetic operations that the combinators represent.\n5.  **Calculate log_2(n):** Once `n` is known, I will compute its base-2 logarithm.\n6.  **Code the Solution:** Finally, I'll write a Python script to perform and display these calculations, making sure to show how each number in the final equation for `n` is derived.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_church_numeral_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for log_2(n) where n is a Church integer represented by\n    S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the values of the base Church numerals in the expression.\")\n    \n    # The combinator `S(S(K(S))(K))` represents the Church numeral c_2.\n    c2_operator_val = 2\n    \n    # The combinator `S(I)(I)` also represents the Church numeral c_2.\n    c2_operand_val = 2\n\n    # The combinator `I` represents the Church numeral c_1.\n    c1_val = 1\n    \n    print(f\"c_1 (from I) = {c1_val}\")\n    print(f\"c_2 (from S(S(K(S))(K))) = {c2_operator_val}\")\n    print(f\"c_2 (from S(I)(I)) = {c2_operand_val}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluate the components of the main expression.\")\n    print(\"The key evaluation rule is that applying one Church numeral c_m to another c_n, as in c_m(c_n), corresponds to multiplication: m * n.\")\n\n    # The component `C` in the expression is S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)), which is c_2(c_2).\n    c_val = c2_operator_val * c2_operand_val\n    print(f\"Component C = c_2(c_2) => {c2_operator_val} * {c2_operand_val} = {c_val}.
