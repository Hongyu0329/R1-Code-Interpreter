    This function calculates the limit of the probability P[V_n > 2/3].
    
    The logic is based on the properties of the conditioned Brownian motion X_t.
    
    1.  The process X_t is a standard 2D Brownian motion conditioned to avoid the
        unit disk D_0. The conditioning, via a Doob's h-transform with h(z)=ln|z|,
        introduces an outward drift term to the process.

    2.  This outward drift, though weak at large distances, is sufficient to make
        the process transient. A transient process X_t has the property that
        |X_t| -> infinity as t -> infinity. It does not return to any finite
        region infinitely often.

    3.  V_n is the relative area of the disk B_n covered by the sausage
        S = X_{[0,infinity)} + D_0. Due to the transience of the process, the path
        becomes sparse at large distances. One can expect the variable V_n to
        converge in probability to the asymptotic density of the sausage, rho.
        rho = lim_{|z|->inf} P(z is covered by S).

    4.  The event "z is covered by S" is equivalent to the path X_t coming within
        a distance of 1 from the point z. For a transient process starting at a
        fixed point (or in a finite region), the probability of hitting a
        fixed-size target (like the disk D(z, 1)) must go to 0 as the distance |z|
        of the target goes to infinity.
    
    5.  Therefore, the asymptotic density of the sausage is zero.
        rho = 0.

    6.  Since V_n converges in probability to 0, for any positive constant c,
        the probability P(V_n > c) must approach 0 as n -> infinity. In this
        problem, c = 2/3.
