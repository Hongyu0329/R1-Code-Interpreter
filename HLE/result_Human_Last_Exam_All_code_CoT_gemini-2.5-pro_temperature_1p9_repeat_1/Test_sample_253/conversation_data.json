    "Of course. I can help with that. Here is a Python script to simulate the Rule 110 cellular automaton.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define Rule 110**: I will create a mapping (a dictionary in Python) that holds the output for each of the 8 possible three-cell neighborhoods, according to Rule 110. The binary representation of 110 is `01101110`, which dictates the rules.\n2.  **Initialize the Grid**: I will set up a one-dimensional grid (a list in Python) of cells. The grid needs to be wide enough to allow the pattern to evolve for 20 steps without hitting the boundaries. I'll start with a grid of all zeros and place a single `1` in the exact center.\n3.  **Simulate Generations**: I will loop 20 times, representing the 20 applications of the rule. In each step, I will calculate the next state of the grid by applying the Rule 110 mapping to every cell's neighborhood.\n4.  **Generate Final Output**: After 20 generations, the simulation is complete. I will then find the start and end of the resulting pattern to trim away the excess leading and trailing zeros. Finally, I will print each number of the final binary pattern, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the Rule 110 cellular automaton starting from a single\n    cell and prints the resulting pattern after 20 generations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
