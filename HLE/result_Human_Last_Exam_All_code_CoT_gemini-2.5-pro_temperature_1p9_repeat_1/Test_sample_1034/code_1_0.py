# Step 1: Define the value for S from the placeholder SNYWR.
# This is a placeholder, a value like 40 is a reasonable assumption for this type of problem.
S = 40

# Step 2: Set up the geometric condition.
# For there to be two possible values for side AB, the length of side AC
# must be greater than the altitude from C but less than the length of side BC.
# The altitude h = BC * sin(B) = S * sin(30) = S / 2.
# So, the inequality for AC is: S/2 < AC < S.

# Step 3: Calculate the bounds for the integer values of AC.
lower_bound = S / 2
upper_bound = S

# We need to find the number of integers between lower_bound and upper_bound.
# The smallest integer greater than lower_bound is math.floor(lower_bound) + 1.
# The largest integer less than upper_bound is upper_bound - 1.
first_integer_ac = math.floor(lower_bound) + 1
last_integer_ac = upper_bound - 1

# Step 4: Calculate the total number of possible integer values for AC.
# The count of integers in the range [start, end] is (end - start + 1).
# Another way to calculate this is (upper_bound - 1) - math.floor(lower_bound).
count = last_integer_ac - first_integer_ac + 1

# Step 5: Print the explanation and the final equation.
