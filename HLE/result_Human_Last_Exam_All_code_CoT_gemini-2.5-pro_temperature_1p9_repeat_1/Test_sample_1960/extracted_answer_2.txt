Let `\otimes` denote the multiplicative conjunction (tensor) and `\multimap` denote linear implication.
The function `f` maps a natural number `w` to a linear logic formula. The formula `C` is constructed based on `m` and `b`.

The function `f` is defined as:
$$
f(w) = \underbrace{\bot \otimes \bot \otimes \dots \otimes \bot}_{w \text{ times}}
$$
For `w=0`, `f(0)` is defined as the identity for `\otimes`, which is `1`.

The formula `C` is defined as:
Let `P_b` be the formula `(\underbrace{\bot \otimes \dots \otimes \bot}_{b \text{ times}}) \multimap 1`.
Then `C(m, b)` is defined by `m` nested implications of `P_b` into `1`:
$$
C(m, b) = \underbrace{P_b \multimap (P_b \multimap \dots (P_b}_{m \text{ implications}} \multimap 1)\dots)
$$
For `m=0`, `C(0, b)` is defined as `1`.
