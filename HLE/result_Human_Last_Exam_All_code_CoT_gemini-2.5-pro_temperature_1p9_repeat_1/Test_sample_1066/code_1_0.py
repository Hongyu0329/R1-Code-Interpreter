# To get the required format we extract the structure of the formula.
# In the problem we want a lower bound on E[S] involving alpha and pi.
# The formula is n * (1 + alpha - 1/2*ln(2*pi)). Since we're asked for a symbolic bound,
# we cannot simply output the numerical value. The format 'n * (1 + alpha - 0.5 * ln(2*pi))' is
# the symbolic answer. We are also asked to return a final answer in the <<<...>>> format.
# A reasonable interpretation would be to express the constant part of the per-token bound
constant_part = 1 - 0.5 * math.log(2 * math.pi)
# This results in approx 0.081. But the problem might be asking for the structure
# alpha + constant
# I will output the final expression in a simplified symbolic form

# The problem is a bit ambiguous as to what exact expression it wants.
# 'a lower bound on E[S] involving alpha and the constant pi'.
# 'n * (1 + alpha - 0.5*ln(2*pi))' is such a bound.
# The example "9.8" or "C" suggests a single value. This could be the constant part
# for n=1 alpha=0: 1-0.5*ln(2pi) = 0.081... which is not clean.
# 'n*(alpha+C)' suggests returning C. '1-ln(sqrt(2*pi))'. Still not a simple letter.
# Maybe I should just format the final formula.
