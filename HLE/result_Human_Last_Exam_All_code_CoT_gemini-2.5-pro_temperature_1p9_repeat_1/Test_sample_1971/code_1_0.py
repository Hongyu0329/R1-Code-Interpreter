    # L_bose = -1/(2*kappa^2) * R - 1/3 * S^2 + alpha * S
    # From this, we can define the scalar potential V for S.

    # === Part 2: Finding the numerical value for beta ===
    # We require the S-independent terms in the variation of L_cos to vanish.
    # delta(L_cos) = alpha*e*[delta(S) + kappa*beta*delta(bar(psi)*gamma*psi)]
    # S-independent part of delta(S) is proportional to epsilon*gamma*R_mu,
    # which can be shown to be proportional to epsilon*gamma*D*psi.
    # S-independent part of delta(bar(psi)*...*psi) is proportional to bar(psi)*gamma*D*epsilon.
    # After integration by parts, the second term also becomes proportional to epsilon*gamma*D*psi.
