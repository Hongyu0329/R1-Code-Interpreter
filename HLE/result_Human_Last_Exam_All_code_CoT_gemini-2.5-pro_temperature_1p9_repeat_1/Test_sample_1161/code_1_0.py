def solve_fortress_problem_for_sphere():
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of guards for the fortress problem on a 3D unit ball.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Each guard placed on the surface of the sphere can see the half-space
       outside the tangent plane at its location.
    2. The collective unobserved region is the intersection of the complementary
       half-spaces. This intersection forms a convex polytope whose faces are
       tangent to the sphere.
    3. Such a polytope always contains the sphere, meaning some exterior points
       (the 'corners' of the polytope) are always unobserved for any finite number of guards.
       This implies that strictly, an infinite number of guards are needed.
    4. However, we can ask for the minimum number of guards required to make the
       unobserved region *bounded*. This ensures all points sufficiently far from the
       sphere are seen.
    5. In 3D space, the minimum number of half-spaces needed to form a bounded
       region (a simple polytope like a tetrahedron) is 4. With 3 or fewer guards, the
       unobserved region is unbounded.
