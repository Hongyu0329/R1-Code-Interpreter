# Plan:
# 1. Address question (a) by explaining the relationship between piecewise polynomial functions and continuity.
# 2. Address question (b) by using the established formula for the degree of the volume polynomial Z_g,n.
# 3. The formula for the degree is 2 * (3g - 3 + n).
# 4. For the specific case g=0, n_+=3, n_-=1, we have g=0 and n = n_+ + n_- = 4.
# 5. Substitute these values into the formula and calculate the degree, outputting each number in the final equation.
# 6. Format and print the reasoning and the final answers.

print("(a) Analysis of Continuity:")
print("The property that a function is piecewise polynomial does not, in general, imply that the function is continuous. A function is piecewise polynomial if its domain can be partitioned into a finite number of regions, on each of which the function is a polynomial.")
print("At the boundaries between these regions, the polynomial pieces are not required to have the same value. A common counterexample is a step function, which is piecewise constant (a polynomial of degree 0), but it is discontinuous at the points where it 'jumps'.")
print("Although the volume Z_{g, n_+, n_-} is in fact a continuous function, this is a separate property derived from its geometric definition, not a direct consequence of its piecewise polynomial nature. Therefore, the statement of implication is false.")
