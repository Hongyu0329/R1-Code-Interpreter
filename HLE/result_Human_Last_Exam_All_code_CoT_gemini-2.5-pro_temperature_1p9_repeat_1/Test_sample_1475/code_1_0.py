    This function explains and provides the answer to the topological problem.
    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of a countable intersection
    of open dense subsets of the space P(X).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The space P(X) can be shown to be a Polish space (a completely metrizable
       separable space). This makes it a Baire space.
    2. P(X) can also be shown to be a perfect space (it has no isolated points).
    3. By the Baire Category Theorem, a countable intersection of open dense
       subsets of a Baire space is a dense G_δ set (also called a residual set).
    4. A key result in descriptive set theory states that any dense G_δ subset
       of a non-empty, perfect Polish space has the cardinality of the continuum.

    The cardinality of the continuum is denoted by 2^aleph_0. There is no equation with numbers
    to compute here, the answer is this transfinite number.
    """
    # There are no calculations to perform. The answer is derived from theorems in topology.
    # The cardinality is 2^{\aleph_0}.
    # We will print the answer as a descriptive string.
    cardinality_symbol = "2^aleph_0"
    
    print("The smallest possible cardinality of the intersection is the cardinality of the continuum.")
    print(f"This value is {cardinality_symbol}.")
