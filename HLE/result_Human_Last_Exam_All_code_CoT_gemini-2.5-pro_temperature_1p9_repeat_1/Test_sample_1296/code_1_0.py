  Solves the theoretical questions about dessin d'enfants and their automorphism groups.

  # Part (a): If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
  # Reasoning: The quasiprimitive action of G on the face set F implies that its socle N
  # is transitive on F. The faces of the quotient dessin D_N are the orbits of N on F.
  # Since N is transitive, there's only one orbit, so D_N is unicellular. The condition
  # on G/N is not required for this conclusion.
  answer_a = "Yes"

  # Part (b): Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group.
  # Reasoning: This refers to the classification of quasiprimitive groups that can act
  # as automorphism groups of dessins under these conditions. Research has shown that
  # groups of all three types (HA, TW, AS) can occur.
  answer_b = "HA, TW, AS"

  # Part (c): True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth covering of D_N.
  # Reasoning: This statement must be true for all l <= 5. However, classification theorems
  # provide counterexamples. Specifically, for l = 5 (e.g., with T = A_5), such groups
  # and dessins do exist. Since the statement fails for l = 5, it is false.
  answer_c = "False"

  # Format the final answer string as requested.
