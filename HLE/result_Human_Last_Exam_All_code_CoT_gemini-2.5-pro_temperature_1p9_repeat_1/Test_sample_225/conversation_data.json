    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve:** The given curve is a Lissajous curve. Lissajous curves are described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A*sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = B*sin(bt)`. Our curve has `A=1`, `B=1`, `a=9`, `b=5`, and the `cos` function for x corresponds to a phase shift `δ` of `π/2`.\n\n2.  **Identify parameters:** The parameters for our curve are `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n\n3.  **Check properties of parameters:**\n    *   The ratio `a/b = 9/5` is rational, which means the curve is closed and retraces itself.\n    *   The greatest common divisor, `gcd(9, 5)`, is 1. The parameters are coprime.\n    *   Both `a=9` and `b=5` are odd integers greater than 1.\n\n4.  **Use the appropriate formula:** For Lissajous curves of the form `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)` where `a` and `b` are coprime odd integers greater than 1, there is a known formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points. The formula is:\n    `Number of self-intersections = (a - 1) * (b - 1)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the result:** Plugging our values `a=9` and `b=5` into the formula:\n    `Number of self-intersections = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) = 8 * 4 = 32`\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value and prints the result along with the formula used.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters 'a' and 'b' from the curve equations x=cos(at) and y=sin(bt)\na = 9\nb = 5\n\n# For a Lissajous curve of the form x=cos(at), y=sin(bt) where a and b are\n# coprime odd integers, the number of self-intersection points is given by\n# the formula (a-1)*(b-1).\nnum_intersections = (a - 1) * (b - 1)\n\n# Print the calculation and the final result.\n# The request is to output each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"The curve is defined by (cos({a}t), sin({b}t)).\")\nprint(\"This is a Lissajous curve with parameters a and b being coprime odd integers.\")\nprint(\"The formula for the number of self-intersections in this case is (a-1) * (b-1).\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: ({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) = {a-1} * {b-1} = {num_intersections}\")\nprint(f\"The number of self-intersection points is: {num_intersections}\")\n\n```\n<<<32>>>"
