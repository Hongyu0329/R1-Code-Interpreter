        'C': "Standard late fee and payment terms for a paid service. The parenthetical number '10.5%' is likely a typo for 1.5% per month (18%/yr), but the clause defers to the legal maximum, which is standard.",

A user would not reasonably expect the prohibition found in item (vi), which forbids research on individuals in a single specific state (Illinois). This is likely an attempt to avoid liability under a specific state law (like BIPA) and is a material, unexpected limitation on the service.",

        'G': "The fundamental model for most free social media services (like Facebook/Instagram). This describes how they use data for ads, and it is a widely understood and expected practice."
