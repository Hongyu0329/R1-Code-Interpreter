    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the final Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Mathematical Question:** The user is asking for the number of types of stable reductions of a genus 4 curve `C` under the condition that its Jacobian variety `J(C)` has good reduction.\n2.  **Apply Algebraic Geometry Theory:** According to the theory of reduction of algebraic curves (notably the work of Deligne and Mumford), if the Jacobian `J(C)` has good reduction, the special fiber of the stable model of `C` is a \"stable curve of compact type\".\n3.  **Properties of Compact Type Curves:** A key property of a stable curve of compact type is that its dual graph is a tree. For such a curve, the genus of the original curve `g` is simply the sum of the genera of the irreducible components of its special fiber: `g = g_1 + g_2 + ... + g_r`.\n4.  **Relate to a Combinatorial Problem:** In our case, the genus `g = 4`. The \"types of stable reduction\" correspond to the different ways we can choose the genera of the components `{g_1, g_2, ...}` such that their sum is 4. This is precisely the problem of finding the number of partitions of the integer 4.\n    *   For example, the partition `4 = 3 + 1` corresponds to a stable reduction where the special fiber has two components, one of genus 3 and one of genus 1, connected at a single point (node).\n    *   The partition `4 = 2 + 2` corresponds to two genus 2 components connected at a node.\n    *   The partition `4` itself corresponds to the case where the curve `C` already had good reduction, and its special fiber is a single irreducible curve of genus 4.\n5.  **Develop the Code:** The plan is to write a Python script that programmatically finds all partitions of the integer 4. The script will:\n    *   Implement a function to generate these partitions.\n    *   Call this function for the genus `g=4`.\n    *   Print each unique partition, which represents a type of reduction.\n    *   Count the number of partitions found.\n    *   Display the final count as a sum, as requested.\n\nThe script below will execute this plan.\n\n```python\ndef find_integer_partitions(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all unique partitions of an integer n.\n    Each partition is a list of integers that sum to n.\n    The function uses a recursive helper to find the partitions.\n    \"\"\"\n    partitions_list = []\n    \n    # A recursive helper function to find partitions\n    # target: the remaining sum we need to achieve\n    # max_val: the maximum value a part can have (to ensure non-increasing order)\n    # current_partition: the list of parts found so far\n    def generate(target, max_val, current_partition):\n        if target == 0:\n            # When the target is 0, a valid partition has been found\n            partitions_list.append(list(current_partition))\n            return\n\n        # Iterate from min(target, max_val) down to 1\n        # This ensures parts are in non-increasing order, avoiding duplicates like [3,1] and [1,3]\n        for i in range(min(target, max_val), 0, -1):\n            current_partition.append(i)\n            generate(target - i, i, current_partition)\n            # Backtrack to explore other possibilities\n            current_partition.pop()\n\n    generate(n, n, [])\n    return partitions_list\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    genus = 4\n    \n    print(f\"The number of types of stable reductions of a genus {genus} curve\")\n    print(\"with good reduction Jacobian corresponds to the number of integer partitions of the genus.\\n\")\n    \n    partitions = find_integer_partitions(genus)\n    \n    print(f\"The {len(partitions)} distinct partitions of {genus} are:\")\n    for p in partitions:\n        print(\" -> \" + \" + \".join(map(str, p)))\n\n    count = len(partitions)\n    \n    # Build and print the final equation as requested\n    equation_parts = ['1'] * count\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nEach partition represents one type.
