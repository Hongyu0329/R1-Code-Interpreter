def solve_homeomorphism_classes():
    """
    This function calculates the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for the space X.
    
    The space X is a compact topological space with two properties:
    1. It contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.
    
    These two properties are the defining characteristics of the Stone-Čech compactification
    of the long ray, denoted βR. The Stone-Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space (like R)
    is unique up to homeomorphism.
    
    Therefore, any space X satisfying these conditions must be homeomorphic to βR. This implies
    that all such spaces X belong to the same homeomorphism class.
    
    The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.
