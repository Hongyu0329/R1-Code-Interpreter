    "To determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I will identify the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the Waskaganish gathering place in Quebec.\n2.  Next, I will identify the provinces and territories that border Quebec. The most likely candidates for the closest are Ontario (to the west across James Bay) and Nunavut (to the north).\n3.  I will then find the coordinates of a representative and nearby settlement in each of these candidate regions: Moosonee for Ontario and Sanikiluaq for Nunavut.\n4.  Using the Haversine formula, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere, I will compute the distance from Waskaganish to both Moosonee and Sanikiluaq. I will show the key numbers used in this calculation.\n5.  Finally, by comparing these two distances, I will determine which province or territory is closer and present the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_and_print_distance(lat1_deg, lon1_deg, lat2_deg, lon2_deg, origin_name, destination_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Haversine distance between two points and prints the steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Calculating distance from {origin_name} to {destination_name} ---\")\n\n    # Convert decimal degrees to radians\n    lon1_rad, lat1_rad, lon2_rad, lat2_rad = map(math.radians, [lon1_deg, lat1_deg, lon2_deg, lat2_deg])\n    \n    # Earth's radius in kilometers\n    R = 6371\n\n    # Haversine formula steps\n    # Step 1: Calculate changes in latitude and longitude\n    delta_lat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n    delta_lon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate 'a'\n    # a = sin²(Δlat/2) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin²(Δlon/2)\n    a = math.sin(delta_lat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(delta_lon / 2)**2\n    print(f\"Equation for 'a': a = sin²({delta_lat:.4f}/2) + cos({lat1_rad:.4f}) * cos({lat2_rad:.4f}) * sin²({delta_lon:.4f}/2)\")\n    print(f\"Result for 'a': a = {a:.6f}\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate 'c'\n    # c = 2 * atan2(√a, √(1-a))\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n    print(f\"Equation for 'c': c = 2 * atan2(√{a:.6f}, √(1-{a:.6f}))\")\n    print(f\"Result for 'c': c = {c:.6f}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate final distance\n    # d = R * c\n    distance = R * c\n    print(f\"Equation for distance: d = {R} * {c:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"Final distance: {distance:.2f} km\\n\")\n\n    return distance\n\n# Coordinates of the locations\nwaskaganish_loc = {\"name\": \"Waskaganish, QC\", \"coords\": (51.49, -78.76)}\nmoosonee_loc = {\"name\": \"Moosonee, ON\", \"coords\": (51.27, -80.64)}\nsanikiluaq_loc = {\"name\": \"Sanikiluaq, NU\", \"coords\": (56.54, -79.23)}\n\n# Calculate distance to Ontario candidate\ndist_to_ontario = calculate_and_print_distance(\n    waskaganish_loc[\"coords\"][0], waskaganish_loc[\"coords\"][1],\n    moosonee_loc[\"coords\"][0], moosonee_loc[\"coords\"][1],\n    waskaganish_loc[\"name\"], moosonee_loc[\"name\"]\n)\n\n# Calculate distance to Nunavut candidate\ndist_to_nunavut = calculate_and_print_distance(\n    waskaganish_loc[\"coords\"][0], waskaganish_loc[\"coords\"][1],\n    sanikiluaq_loc[\"coords\"][0], sanikiluaq_loc[\"coords\"][1],\n    waskaganish_loc[\"name\"], sanikiluaq_loc[\"name\"]\n)\n\n# Compare distances and print the conclusion\nprint(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\nif dist_to_ontario < dist_to_nunavut:\n    closest_province = \"Ontario\"\n    print(f\"The distance to Moosonee, Ontario ({dist_to_ontario:.2f} km) is less than the distance to Sanikiluaq, Nunavut ({dist_to_nunavut:.2f} km).\")\nelse:\n    closest_province = \"Nunavut\"\n    print(f\"The distance to Sanikiluaq, Nunavut ({dist_to_nunavut:.2f} km) is less than the distance to Moosonee, Ontario ({dist_to_ontario:.2f} km).\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is {closest_province}.\")\n\n<<<Ontario>>>\n```"
