# Based on the analysis, the complicated second term of the function
# is designed such that its contribution to the 4th Maclaurin coefficient is zero.
# This is due to the term's Taylor series starting at a high power of x (x^19),
# assuming a likely typo (-1/e should be -1) that makes the problem solvable.
# Therefore, the coefficient is determined entirely by the first term: f1(x) = (9 * x^4) / (16 * e).

# The coefficient of the x^4 term is 9 / (16 * e).
numerator = 9
denominator_const = 16
eulers_number = math.e

coefficient = numerator / (denominator_const * eulers_number)

# The prompt requires outputting the numbers in the final equation, c = 9 / (16 * e)
