# Step 1-4: Derivation leads to the trajectory equation y(x) = -x^2/4 - x - 1.
# Step 5: We need to find the position x0 where the particle reaches y(x0) = -3.
# This gives the equation: -3 = -x0^2/4 - x0 - 1.
# Rearranging and multiplying by -4, we get a standard quadratic equation:
# x0^2 + 4*x0 - 8 = 0.

# Step 6: We solve this quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
# The coefficients are:
a = 1
b = 4
c = -8

# In the final code, we output each number in the final equation.
print(f"The problem reduces to solving the following quadratic equation for x0:")
print(f"({a})*x0^2 + ({b})*x0 + ({c}) = 0")

# Solve using the quadratic formula: x = [-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

# Calculate the two possible roots for x0
x0_root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
x0_root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)

# Step 7: Select the correct root.
# From the initial conditions, we find dy/dx at x=0 is -1.
# This means the particle starts at (0, -1) and moves towards increasing x and decreasing y.
# To reach y = -3 from y = -1, the particle must have traveled to a positive x-coordinate.
# Therefore, we choose the positive root.
x0 = x0_root1

print(f"\nThe two solutions are x0 = {x0_root1:.5f} and x0 = {x0_root2:.5f}.")
print(f"Based on the particle's initial motion, the correct position is the positive value.")
print(f"\nThe position x0 along the trajectory is: {x0}")
