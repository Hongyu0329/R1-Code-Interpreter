# Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement
p = 43
n = 18
e = 3

# The residue field degree f is calculated from n = e*f
f = n // e

# The size of the residue field, q, is p^f
q = p**f

# Step 2 & 3: Analyze the sets and the equivalence relation
# The set B(1,0) is O_K_star x O_K.
# On this set, the distance is d((z0,z), (w0,w)) = sup(|z0-w0|_p, |z-w|_p)^2.
# The new equivalence relation is d < threshold.

# Step 4: Interpret the Threshold
# The given threshold "pi^-6 where pi = 1/p^3 is a uniformizer" is contradictory.
# We assume the intended threshold, delta, is p^-6.
# delta = p**-6
# The condition becomes sup{|z0-w0|_p, |z-w|_p}^2 < p^-6
# This means sup{|z0-w0|_p, |z-w|_p} < p^-3.
# Let I be the ideal {x in O_K | |x|_p < p^-3}.

# Step 5: Determine the ideal I
# The condition |x|_p < p^-3 translates to a condition on the valuation v_K(x).
# p^(-v_K(x)) < p^-3  => -v_K(x) < -3 => v_K(x) > 3.
# The valuation v_K(x) takes values in (1/e)Z = (1/3)Z.
# Let v_K(x) = m/3 for an integer m.
# m/3 > 3 => m > 9.
# The smallest integer m satisfying this is m = 10.
# So, the ideal I corresponds to elements with valuation >= 10/3.
# This is the ideal M^10, where M is the maximal ideal of O_K.
k = 10

# Step 6: Count the classes
# Number of classes for the z component (in O_K) is |O_K / M^k| = q^k.
num_classes_z = q**k

# Number of classes for the z0 component (in O_K_star) is |(O_K / M^k)*| = q^k - q^(k-1).
num_classes_z0 = (q**k) - (q**(k-1))

# Total number of classes is the product.
total_classes = num_classes_z0 * num_classes_z

# Simplify the formula: (q^k - q^(k-1)) * q^k = q^(k-1)(q-1) * q^k = q^(2k-1)(q-1)

# Step 7: Final Calculation
