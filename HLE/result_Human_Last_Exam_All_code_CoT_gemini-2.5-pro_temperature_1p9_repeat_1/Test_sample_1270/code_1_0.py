# The fictitious molecule "mercedesbenzene" combines the concepts of a 
# Mercedes logo (a 3-pointed star) and a benzene molecule (a 6-carbon ring).

# A benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms.
benzene_carbons = 6

# The Mercedes logo is a 3-pointed star. We can represent this by
# adding 3 single-carbon groups to the benzene ring.
star_carbons = 3

# Calculate the total number of carbons.
total_carbons = benzene_carbons + star_carbons

# Print the final equation with each number.
