    # C represents the number of disjoint, contiguous, unimodal classes.
    # The problem asks for the minimum number of prototypes to guarantee correct
    # classification of all C class centroids. Let's call this number M.

    # Part 1: Establishing a Lower Bound (M >= C)
    # We argue that we need at least one "champion" prototype for each class.
    # Consider the case where M < C. For example, if C=2 and we only use M=1 prototype 'p'.
    # The soft label of 'p' is fixed and based on its proximity to the two centroids, C1 and C2.
    # - If 'p' is closer to C1, its label will favor class 1. This would work for classifying C1.
    #   However, when classifying C2, the classifier would use 'p' and likely misclassify C2 as class 1.
    # - If 'p' is closer to C2, the reverse happens, and C1 gets misclassified.
    # - If 'p' is equidistant, its label is ambiguous and fails to classify either centroid reliably.
    # This logic extends to the general case: with fewer prototypes than classes, there will always be
    # a class centroid that lacks a dedicated nearby prototype, which allows for a geometric
    # arrangement of centroids that leads to its misclassification.
    # Therefore, the number of prototypes M must be at least C.

    # Part 2: Demonstrating Sufficiency (M = C is enough)
    # We propose a strategy using exactly C prototypes.

    # exactly at the location of the class centroid C_c.

    # When the kNN classifier is asked to classify the point C_k, it considers its neighbors from the prototype set.
    # The distance from C_k to its corresponding prototype p_k is 0.
    # The distance from C_k to any other prototype p_j (where j != k) is non-zero, as classes are disjoint.
    
    # The weight of a prototype in the kNN decision is typically 1/distance.
    # - The weight of prototype p_k is w_k = 1/0, which is infinite.
    # - The weight of any other prototype p_j is w_j = 1/distance(C_k, C_j), which is finite.
    
    # The soft label for p_k, based on proximity, will overwhelmingly favor class k. Let's assume it's [0, ..., 1, ..., 0].
    
    # The final classification score for any class is the weighted sum of soft-label probabilities from the k-nearest neighbors.
    # Due to the infinite weight of p_k, its contribution dominates the calculation.
    # - Score for class k will be infinite.
    # - Score for any other class j != k will be finite.
    
    # Thus, the predicted class for C_k is k, which is correct. This holds for any centroid.
    print("Analysis: When classifying centroid C_k, the co-located prototype p_k has a distance of 0, resulting in an infinite weight.")
