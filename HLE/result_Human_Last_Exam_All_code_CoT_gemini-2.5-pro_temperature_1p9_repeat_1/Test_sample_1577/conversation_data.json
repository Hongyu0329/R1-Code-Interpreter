    "The problem asks for the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code model on a surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. This is a problem in topological quantum computation. The GSD of the toric code depends on the topology of the surface on which it is defined.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the topological properties:** The surface is a sphere (genus `g=0`) with `n` boundaries of one type (smooth, or electric) and `m` boundaries of another type (rough, or magnetic).\n2.  **Relate topology to GSD:** The GSD is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of independent logical qubits the system can encode. The number of logical qubits `k` is determined by the number of non-trivial logical operators, which in turn depends on the genus and the number and types of boundaries.\n3.  **Find the formula for k:** For a surface with genus `g`, `n` smooth boundaries, and `m` rough boundaries, the number of logical qubits `k` can be calculated. We assume the simplest topology, a sphere, so the genus `g=0`.\n4.  **Handle different cases:** The formula for `k` can be piecewise depending on whether `n` or `m` are zero.\n    *   If `m=0` (only `n` smooth boundaries), `k = n-1`.\n    *   If `n=0` (only `m` rough boundaries), `k = m-1`.\n    *   If `n > 0` and `m > 0` (a mix of both types), the logical operators associated with smooth boundaries are independent and commute with those associated with the rough boundaries. The total number of qubits is the sum of qubits from each subsystem, `k = (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2`.\n5.  **Synthesize the result:** The problem is phrased in a way that implies `n` and `m` are generic positive integers, as it mentions the presence of both \"n smooth holes and m rough holes\". In this common case (`n>0, m>0`), the number of logical qubits is `k = n+m-2`. This corresponds to the formula in answer choice B.\n6.  **Create a script:** I will write a Python script that calculates the GSD using this formula for example values of `n` and `m`, and clearly displays the calculation steps as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code\n    on a sphere with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    The calculation is based on the formula for the case where both\n    n > 0 and m > 0.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing the number of logical qubits and the GSD,\n        or an error message string if n or m are not positive.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0 or m <= 0:\n        return (None, \"This formula assumes n > 0 and m > 0.
