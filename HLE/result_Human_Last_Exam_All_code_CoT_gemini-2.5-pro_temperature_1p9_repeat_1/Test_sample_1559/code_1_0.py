# The problem's logic dictates that the input to the final Gate C is a classical bit '1'.
# According to quantum formalism, a classical bit '1' is equivalent to the quantum state |1>.
# This state can be written in the form α|0> + β|1>, where the amplitude α is 0 and β is 1.

# Assign the amplitudes for the state |1>
amplitude_of_0 = 0
amplitude_of_1 = 1

# Rule (R3) provides the translation formula: |amplitude of |0>|² × 0 + |amplitude of |1>|² × 1
# Let's calculate the final output bit using this formula.
output_bit = (amplitude_of_0**2) * 0 + (amplitude_of_1**2) * 1

# As requested, we print the final equation showing each number.
