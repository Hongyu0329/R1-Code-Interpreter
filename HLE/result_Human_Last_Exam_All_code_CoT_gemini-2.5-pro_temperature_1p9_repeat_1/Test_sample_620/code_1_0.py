    print("\nWhen the assay starts (at a warmer temperature), the inactive monomers must re-associate to form active dimers. This process takes time and causes an initial 'lag phase' where the reaction is slow. The rate then increases as more active dimers are formed. This lag phase results in the observed non-linear curve.")

    # Option A: Increase temperature

    # Option B: Decrease temperature
    print("\n[B] Decrease Temperature:")
    print("   - Effect: Lower temperatures would favor the dissociated, inactive state, making the problem worse.")

    # Option C: Increase Enzyme Concentration
    print("\n[C] Increase Enzyme Concentration:")
    print("   - Effect: The equilibrium between monomers (M) and dimers (D) is described as 2M <=> D.")
    print("   - According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the total concentration of the enzyme will push this equilibrium to the right, favoring the formation of the active dimer.")
    print("   - This is a highly effective way to overcome dissociation and reduce the lag time. It's a standard method to test for and fix this specific issue.")

    # Option D: Decrease Enzyme Concentration
    print("\n[D] Decrease Enzyme Concentration:")
    print("   - Effect: Lowering the concentration would shift the equilibrium to the left, favoring the inactive monomers and making the problem worse.")

    # --- Step 4: Conclusion ---
    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion")
    print("Both (A) and (C) are plausible. However, increasing the enzyme concentration (C) is the most direct and robust method to troubleshoot a problem suspected to be caused by subunit dissociation.")
    print("It directly addresses the concentration-dependent equilibrium at the core of the issue.")
    print("\nFinal Recommendation: The best troubleshooting step is to increase the enzyme concentration.")
