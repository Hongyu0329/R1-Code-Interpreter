# The user wants me to identify the incorrect statement based on the provided text.
# The text describes two aphid biotypes, CA and MA, and their adaptation to different sugar diets (raffinose and sucrose).
# CA is adapted to watermelon, which seems rich in raffinose. MA is adapted to cotton, which seems rich in sucrose.
# Galactosidase is the enzyme for metabolizing raffinose.

# Let's analyze each statement:
# A. CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs (like raffinose) than MA biotypes.
# - This is consistent with CA doing well on a raffinose-rich diet and MA doing well on a sucrose-only diet. So, A is likely TRUE.

# B. CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.
# - The text says each "did well" on these diets, which implies preference/adaptation. So, B is likely TRUE.

# C. Upon host transfer, CA biotypes (moved to cotton) showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.
# - Cotton is the host for MA, which prefers sucrose. So, cotton is likely low in raffinose.
# - Less raffinose (the substrate for galactosidase) would lead to lower enzyme activity. This is a sound biological principle. So, C is likely TRUE.

# D. Upon host transfer, CA biotypes (moved to cotton) showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.
# - The first part (decreased galactosidase activity) is likely correct.
# - The reasoning is "owing to higher glucose levels in cotton." The text mentions sucrose and raffinose, but not glucose. Attributing the cause to glucose levels is an assumption not supported by the provided text. The direct cause is the lack of substrate (raffinose) as stated in C. Therefore, this statement presents an unsubstantiated reason. It is the most likely incorrect statement. So, D is likely NOT TRUE.

# E. Upon host transfer, MA biotypes (moved to watermelon) showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.
# - Watermelon is the host for CA, which prefers raffinose. So, watermelon is likely high in raffinose.
# - More raffinose substrate would induce higher galactosidase activity. So, E is likely TRUE.

# Conclusion: Statement D provides a cause that is not supported by the information in the text.

final_answer = 'D'
print(f"The statement that is not true is D.")
print(f"Reasoning: The text provides no information about glucose levels in cotton. The decrease in galactosidase activity in CA biotypes when transferred to cotton is directly attributable to the lower raffinose levels in cotton (as correctly stated in C), not to hypothetical glucose levels.")
print(f"Therefore, the reasoning in statement D is unsubstantiated and makes the entire statement 'not true' in the context of the information given.")
