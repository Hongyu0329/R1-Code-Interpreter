    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  I will represent the two given equations for the plane quadrics using Python's symbolic mathematics library, `sympy`.\n2.  I will then use `sympy`'s `solve` function to find all intersection points of the two curves. This function can find both real and complex solutions.\n3.  After obtaining the list of solutions, I will iterate through them and check for each solution `(x, y)` if both `x` and `y` are real numbers.\n4.  I will count the number of such real solutions.\n5.  Finally, I will print the original equations and the total count of real intersection points.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_quadric_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the number of real intersection points for two given quadric equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the variables\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n\n    # Define the coefficients and constants for the first equation\n    c1_x2, c1_xy, c1_y2, c1_x, c1_c = 164, -216, 72, -16, 31\n    # Define the first quadric equation\n    eq1 = c1_x2*x**2 + c1_xy*x*y + c1_y2*y**2 + c1_x*x + c1_c\n    \n    # Define the coefficients and constants for the second equation\n    c2_x2, c2_xy, c2_y2, c2_x, c2_y, c2_c = 864, -1056, 324, -560, 324, 149\n    # Define the second quadric equation\n    eq2 = c2_x2*x**2 + c2_xy*x*y + c2_y2*y**2 + c2_x*x + c2_y*y + c2_c\n\n    # Print the equations with their numbers\n    print(f\"The first quadric is given by the equation: {c1_x2}*x^2 + ({c1_xy})*x*y + {c1_y2}*y^2 + ({c1_x})*x + {c1_c} = 0\")\n    print(f\"The second quadric is given by the equation: {c2_x2}*x^2 + ({c2_xy})*x*y + {c2_y2}*y^2 + ({c2_x})*x + {c2_y}*y + {c2_c} = 0\")\n\n    # Solve the system of equations\n    try:\n        solutions = sympy.solve([eq1, eq2], [x, y], dict=False)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred during solving: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Count the number of real solutions\n    real_solutions_count = 0\n    if solutions:\n        for sol in solutions:\n            # Check if both components of the solution are real numbers.\n            # is_real is a property of sympy expressions\n            if sol[0].is_real and sol[1].is_real:\n                real_solutions_count += 1\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe number of real intersection points is: {real_solutions_count}\")\n\nsolve_quadric_intersections()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
