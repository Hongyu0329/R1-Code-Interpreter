    print("  - LC Requirement: 'Invoice'")
    print("  - Presented Document: 'One original unsigned Invoice'")
    print("  - Ruling (UCP 600 Art. 18.a.i): An invoice does not need to be signed unless the LC explicitly requires it.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This is NOT a discrepancy. Statement A is False.\n")

    # --- Discrepancy B Analysis: B/L Full Set ---
    print("Analysis of Statement B: 'Bill of lading is not presented in full set'")
    print("  - Presented Document Info: B/L states 'No of original Bill of lading: 3', but only one original was presented.")
    print("  - Ruling (UCP 600 Art. 20.a.iv): A Bill of Lading must be presented in a full set of originals as issued.")
    print("  - Conclusion: Presenting only 1 of 3 originals is a failure to present a full set. This IS a discrepancy. Statement B is True.\n")

    # --- Discrepancy C Analysis: B/L Consignee ---
    print("Analysis of Statement C: 'Bill of lading is not made out as per LC's term'")
    print("  - LC Requirement: 'Bill of lading make out to order of issuing bank'")

    # --- Discrepancy D Analysis: Packing List Format ---
    print("Analysis of Statement D: 'Packing list is presented in original instead of photocopy'")

    # --- Discrepancy E Analysis: Packing List Signatory ---
    print("Analysis of Statement E: 'Packing list is not signed by Beneficiary'")
    print("  - LC Requirement: 'One photocopy of Packing list' (no specific issuer or signatory mentioned)")
    print("  - Presented Document: 'signed by ABC Company' (the Shipper)")
    print("  - Ruling: The LC does not specify who must sign the packing list. A signature from the shipper is acceptable.")
