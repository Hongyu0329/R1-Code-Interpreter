    Solves for the smallest possible size of the limit lim_{J^op} F.

    The problem asks for the minimum possible size of the inverse limit of a diagram F
    from a directed poset J^op to the category of Sets, under the conditions that:
    1. J is a directed poset.
    2. Each set F(j) is non-empty.
    3. Each connecting map F(j -> i) for i <= j is surjective.

    A key theorem in category theory states that under these exact conditions,
    the inverse limit is guaranteed to be non-empty.
    This means the size of the limit set is at least 1.

    To find the *smallest possible* size, we can construct a minimal example.
    Let's consider the case where every set F(j) is a singleton set,
    for instance, F(j) = {'*'}.

    - Is F(j) non-empty? Yes, it contains one element.
    - Are the maps surjective? For any i <= j, the only possible map from {'*'} to {'*'}
      sends '*' to '*'. This map is surjective.

    The limit consists of all "coherent families" (x_j) where x_j is in F(j) and
    for all i <= j, the map from F(j) to F(i) takes x_j to x_i.

    In our minimal example:
    - Each x_j must be '*'. So there is only one possible family: (*, *, *, ...).
    - The coherence condition holds because the map always sends '*' to '*'.

    Thus, the limit set contains exactly one element (the single coherent family).
    Since the size must be at least 1, and we have found a case where it is
    exactly 1, the smallest possible size is 1.

    The final equation is essentially:
    Minimum Cardinality = 1
