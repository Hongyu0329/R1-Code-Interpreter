    This function determines the critical amount of correlation between two input
    populations (v and s) that balances potentiation and depression in a
    feedforward network.

    The derivation shows that the critical covariance (C) required to balance
    the system is equal to the variance (Var) of the input signals.

    To find a numerical value, we use the information given about the input signals.
    They are described as Poisson processes with an inter-event interval of 150s.
    
    1. Calculate the mean firing rate (mu) from the inter-event interval.
    2. Assume the variance of the rate (Var) is equal to its mean rate (mu),
       a standard assumption for Poisson-like processes in theoretical models.
    3. The critical correlation C_crit is then equal to this value.
