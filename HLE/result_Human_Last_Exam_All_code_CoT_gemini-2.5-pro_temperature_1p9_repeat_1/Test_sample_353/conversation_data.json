    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the $A(\\alpha)$-stability of the BDF4 method, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Stability Polynomial:** The stability of a linear multistep method applied to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$ is determined by its characteristic polynomial $\\pi(\\zeta, q) = \\rho(\\zeta) - q\\sigma(\\zeta) = 0$, where $q = h\\lambda$. For the BDF4 method, the first and second characteristic polynomials, $\\rho(\\zeta)$ and $\\sigma(\\zeta)$, can be derived. The stability region's boundary is the set of points $q$ in the complex plane for which $\\pi(\\zeta, q)$ has a root on the unit circle, i.e., $|\\zeta|=1$.\n\n2.  **Boundary of Stability Region:** By setting $\\zeta = e^{i\\theta}$, we can trace the boundary of the stability region with the function:\n    $q(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})} = \\frac{25}{12} - 4e^{-i\\theta} + 3e^{-i2\\theta} - \\frac{4}{3}e^{-i3\\theta} + \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i4\\theta}$.\n    Let $q(\\theta) = X(\\theta) + iY(\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **$A(\\alpha)$-stability Angle:** The angle $\\alpha$ for $A(\\alpha)$-stability is determined by the point on the stability boundary where the tangent to the curve passes through the origin. This occurs when the argument of $q(\\theta)$ is at an extremum. The condition for this extremum is found to be a surprisingly simple equation in terms of $c = \\cos(\\theta)$:\n    $2\\cos(2\\theta) - 4\\cos(\\theta) + 1 = 0$\n    which simplifies to a quadratic equation in $c$:\n    $4c^2 - 4c - 1 = 0$\n\n4.  **Solving for $\\theta$:** Solving the quadratic equation for $c$ yields two roots: $\\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Since $\\cos(\\theta)$ must be within $[-1, 1]$, we choose the valid root:\n    $\\cos(\\theta_0) = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n\n5.  **Calculating $\\tan(\\alpha)$:** The stability angle $\\alpha$ is given by $\\alpha = \\pi - |\\phi_0|$, where $\\phi_0 = \\arg(q(e^{i\\theta_0}))$.\n    For an angle $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, $\\tan(\\alpha)$ is positive. From the definition, we find that $\\tan(\\alpha) = \\tan(\\pi - \\phi_0) = -\\tan(\\phi_0) = -\\frac{Y(\\theta_0)}{X(\\theta_0)}$.\n    We can express $X(\\theta_0)$ and $Y(\\theta_0)$ in terms of $\\cos(\\theta_0)$ and $\\sin(\\theta_0)$ and then substitute the exact value of $\\cos(\\theta_0)$ to find the exact value of this ratio.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic calculations and derive the exact expression for $\\tan(\\alpha)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the exact value for the tangent of the A(alpha)-stability \n    angle for the BDF4 method using symbolic mathematics.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
