    Solves the problem by analyzing the connectivity of the described planar set.

    The planar set S is the union of:
    - C1: The unit circle (x^2 + y^2 = 1)
    - L1: The line segment {0} x [1/2, 3/2]
    - L2: The line segment [1/2, 3/2] x {0}
    - L3: The line segment [-3/2, -1/2] x {0}
    - L4: The line segment {0} x [-3/2, -1/2]
    - L5: The line segment [-1/2, 1/2] x {1}
    - C_3/2: The bottom-right quarter circle of radius 3/2 (x^2+y^2=(3/2)^2, x>=0, y<=0)

    are 'dead-end' branches (connected to the rest of the set only at p).
