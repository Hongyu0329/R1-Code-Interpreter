    "My plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n1.  **Identify the curve's properties:** The given equation is a hyperelliptic curve. I will first determine its genus.\n2.  **Understand Stable Reduction:** The stable reduction of a curve is its simplest form over the 2-adic integers. The number of double points corresponds to the number of nodes in the geometric fiber of the stable model.\n3.  **Analyze Branch Points:** The topology of the stable reduction is determined by the 2-adic clustering of the branch points of the map from the curve to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$. For a curve $y^2 = f(x)$, these are the roots of $f(x)$ and, if the degree of $f(x)$ is odd, the point at infinity.\n4.  **Find Valuations:** I will find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. This can be done by factoring out $x$ and then using the Newton polygon method for the remaining quartic factor.\n5.  **Partition Branch Points:** Based on their valuations, I'll partition the branch points into clusters. These clusters correspond to the components of the stable reduction.\n6.  **Calculate Component Genera:** For each cluster of $n_i$ branch points, the corresponding component of the stable reduction has a genus $g_i = \\lfloor(n_i-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n7.  **Calculate Double Points:** Finally, I'll use the formula for the genus of a reducible curve: $g = \\sum g_i + N_{int} - N_{comp} + 1$. Here, $g$ is the genus of the original curve, $N_{comp}$ is the number of components (clusters), and $N_{int}$ is the number of intersection points (the double points we want to find).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the number of double points.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve\n    y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5 above 2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The curve is given by y^2 = f(x), where f(x) = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + x^2 + 8*x.\")\n    print(\"We need to find the number of double points in its stable reduction over the 2-adic numbers.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 1: Find the genus of the curve.\n    # The degree of the polynomial f(x) is d=5.\n    d = 5\n    # The genus of a hyperelliptic curve y^2=f(x) is g = floor((d-1)/2).\n    g = math.floor((d - 1) / 2)\n    print(f\"Step 1: The degree of f(x) is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The genus of the curve is g = floor(({d}-1)/2) = {g}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the branch points and their 2-adic valuations.\n    # The branch points are the roots of f(x) and infinity, as the degree is odd.\n    # f(x) = x * (8*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^2 + x + 8).\n    # One root is r_0 = 0.
