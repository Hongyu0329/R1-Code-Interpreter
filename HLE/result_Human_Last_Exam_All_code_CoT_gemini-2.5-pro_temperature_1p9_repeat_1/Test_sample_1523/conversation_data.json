    "Of course. Here is my plan to derive the expression and generate the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Theoretical Framework:** I will start with the partition function `Z` for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` in finite-temperature field theory. This is given by a functional integral over all field configurations, weighted by `exp(-S[ϕ])`, where `S[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action.\n2.  **Define the Action:** The standard Euclidean action `S[ϕ]` for a free, massive scalar field involves a kinetic term `(∂_μ ϕ)²` and a mass term `m² ϕ²`.\n3.  **Identify the Operator D:** I will rewrite the action using integration by parts. This process isolates a differential operator, which we'll call `D`. The action will take the form `S[ϕ] ∝ (ϕ, D_ϕ)`.\n4.  **Define the Inner Product:** The notation `(f, g)` implies an inner product. In this context, it is the integral over Euclidean spacetime of the product of the two functions, i.e., `∫ d⁴x f(x)g(x)`.\n5.  **Construct the Final Expression:** By combining the results from the previous steps, I will determine the precise mathematical expression for `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`.\n6.  **Develop the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that uses `print()` to display a detailed explanation of the derivation and the final, formatted mathematical expression for `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`. The code will explicitly point out the numbers that appear in the equation's components (like the '4' in `d⁴x` and the '2' in `m²`) to fulfill the user's request.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan.\n\n```python\ndef display_inner_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the formula for the inner product (ϕ,D_ϕ)\n    in the context of finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Symbolic Representation of Equation Components ---\n    # The inner product is defined by an integral over Euclidean spacetime.\n    integral_symbol = \"∫\"\n    spacetime_differential = \"d⁴x\"\n\n    # The fields and operators involved.\n    field = \"ϕ(x)\"\n    operator_D_kinetic_part = \"(-∂_μ∂^μ)\"\n    operator_D_mass_part = \"m²\"\n\n    # --- Assembling the final equation string ---\n    # The full operator D is the sum of the kinetic and mass parts.\n    full_operator_D = f\"[{operator_D_kinetic_part} + {operator_D_mass_part}]\"\n\n    # The inner product is (ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ d⁴x ϕ(x) * D * ϕ(x)\n    equation = f\"{integral_symbol} {spacetime_differential} {field} * {full_operator_D} * {field}\"\n\n    # --- Explanation of the physical context and derivation ---\n    explanation = (\n        \"In finite-temperature quantum field theory, the partition function (Z) for a free, \"\n        \"massive, neutral scalar field (ϕ) is given by a functional integral:\\n\"\n        \"Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S[ϕ])\\n\\n\"\n        \"The Euclidean action, S[ϕ], for this field is:\\n\"\n        \"S[ϕ] = ∫ d⁴x * [ (1/2)(∂_μ ϕ)(∂^μ ϕ) + (1/2)m² ϕ² ]\\n\\n\"\n        \"Using integration by parts on the kinetic term and assuming the boundary terms at infinity \"\n        \"vanish, the action can be rewritten in a quadratic form:\\n\"\n        \"S[ϕ] = (1/2) * ∫ d⁴x ϕ(x) * [ -∂_μ∂^μ + m² ] * ϕ(x)\\n\\n\"\n        \"This form is often expressed as S[ϕ] = (1/2) * (ϕ, D_ϕ), where D is the differential operator\\n\"\n        \"D = [ -∂_μ∂^μ + m² ], and the inner product (f, g) is defined as ∫ d⁴x f(x)g(x).\\n\\n\"\n        \"Therefore, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is:\"\n    )\n\n    # --- Print the full result to the user ---\n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*60)\n    print(f\" (ϕ, D_ϕ) = {equation}\")\n    print(\"=\"*60 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # --- Detailed breakdown of symbols containing numbers, as requested ---\n    print(\"Where the components of the equation are:\")\n    print(f\"  -  {integral_symbol} {spacetime_differential}: This represents the integral over 4-dimensional Euclidean spacetime.\")\n    print(\"     The number '4' indicates the dimension of the spacetime (1 Euclidean time + 3 space).\")\n    print(f\"  -  {field}: The neutral scalar field as a function of spacetime position x.\")\n    print(f\"  -  {operator_D_kinetic_part}: The negative of the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator (Laplacian in 4D).\")\n    print(f\"  -  {operator_D_mass_part}: The square of the field's mass, m.\")\n    print(\"     The number '2' is the exponent in the mass term.\")\n\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\ndisplay_inner_product_formula()\n```\n<<<(∫ d⁴x ϕ(x) * [-∂_μ∂^μ + m²] * ϕ(x))>>>"
