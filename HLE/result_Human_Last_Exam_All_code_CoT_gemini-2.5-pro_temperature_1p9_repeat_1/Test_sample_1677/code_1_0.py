    - Option A is incorrect because the decline of the 18-year-old population was as sharp as, or even sharper than, predicted. Demographic predictions were accurate.
    - Option D is inappropriate because it mischaracterizes the role of specialized training colleges. They primarily offer vocational training as an alternative to universities, not as preparatory schools for them.

    Therefore, the incorrect or inappropriate options are A and D.
