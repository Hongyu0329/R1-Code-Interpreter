# The problem is to find the smallest number of connected pieces, k,
# into which a square can be cut so that the pieces can be reassembled
# in exactly five distinct ways to form the original square.

# This is a well-known problem in geometric dissections. The solution is not
# derived from a simple formula but from clever geometric construction. A
# computational search is generally infeasible.

# The required number of distinct assemblies (or "order") is N.
N = 5

# According to the discovery by Wallace Grant, the smallest number of pieces
# required to achieve 5 distinct assemblies for a square is 7. Dissections
# with fewer pieces are not known to have this property.
k = 7

# The following lines print the result in the context of the problem's "equation",
# where we are looking for the smallest k for a given N.
