    "To answer this question, we first need to define the chemical structure of a \"nanocar\". Since \"nanocar\" is a general term for a class of molecules, I will use a common, representative structure for the chassis of a nanocar: **1,2,4,5-tetra(phenylethynyl)benzene**.\n\nThis molecule has:\n1.  A central benzene ring.\n2.  Four \"arms\" attached to it, where each arm consists of a carbon-carbon triple bond (an ethynyl group) and a terminal phenyl group.\n\nNext, we apply the term \"perfluoro-\", which in chemistry means that every hydrogen atom (H) in the original molecule has been replaced by a fluorine atom (F).\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Count the number of hydrogen atoms on the central benzene ring.\n2.  Count the number of hydrogen atoms on the four terminal phenyl groups.\n3.  Sum these counts to find the total number of hydrogens in the model nanocar.\n4.  This total will be equal to the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out each step.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \n    This is based on a model nanocar chassis: 1,2,4,5-tetra(phenylethynyl)benzene.\n    The prefix \"perfluoro-\" means all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Count hydrogens on the central benzene ring.\n    # A standard benzene ring has 6 carbons and 6 hydrogens.\n    # Our central ring is 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted, meaning 4 of its hydrogens\n    # are replaced by the 'arms'. So, 6 - 4 = 2 hydrogens remain.\n    hydrogens_on_central_ring = 2\n    \n    # Step 2: Count hydrogens on the four arms.\n    # Each arm has a terminal phenyl group (C6H5).\n    # A standard phenyl group attached at one point has 5 hydrogens.\n    num_arms = 4\n    hydrogens_per_arm_phenyl_group = 5\n    \n    # Calculate the total hydrogens on the arms.\n    hydrogens_on_arms = num_arms * hydrogens_per_arm_phenyl_group\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms.\n    total_hydrogens = hydrogens_on_central_ring + hydrogens_on_arms\n    \n    # The number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version is equal to the\n    # number of hydrogen atoms.\n    num_fluorine_atoms = total_hydrogens\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical 'perfluoronanocar'...\")\n    print(\"Model Molecule: 1,2,4,5-tetra(phenylethynyl)benzene\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Number of hydrogen atoms on the central ring: {hydrogens_on_central_ring}\")\n    print(f\"Number of hydrogen atoms on the 4 arms: {num_arms} arms * {hydrogens_per_arm_phenyl_group} H/arm = {hydrogens_on_arms}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is the sum of these parts:\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {hydrogens_on_central_ring} + {hydrogens_on_arms} = {total_hydrogens}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"In a 'perfluorinated' molecule, all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms is {num_fluorine_atoms}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms()\n<<<22>>>"
