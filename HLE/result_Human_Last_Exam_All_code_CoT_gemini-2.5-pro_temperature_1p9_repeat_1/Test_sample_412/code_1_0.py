**1. Step-by-step derivation:**

The question asks for the nonstandard analysis equivalent of a map $f: X \to Y$ being continuous.

First, let's recall the standard definition of continuity. A function $f$ is continuous at a standard point $x_0 \in X$ if for every open neighborhood $V$ of $f(x_0)$ in $Y$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ in $X$ such that the image of every point in $U$ is inside $V$ (i.e., $f(U) \subseteq V$). A function is continuous on the space $X$ if it is continuous at every standard point $x_0 \in X$.

In nonstandard analysis, this condition can be elegantly rephrased:
- A point $x_1$ from the nonstandard extension $X^*$ is said to be infinitesimally close to a standard point $x_0 \in X$, denoted $x_1 \sim x_0$, if $x_1$ is in the *monad* of $x_0$. The monad of $x_0$ is the set of points that belong to every standard neighborhood of $x_0$.
- The nonstandard criterion for continuity at a standard point $x_0$ states that $f$ preserves infinitesimal closeness at that point. In other words, $f$ maps points that are infinitesimally close to $x_0$ to points that are infinitesimally close to $f(x_0)$.
- So, $f$ is continuous at a standard point $x_0$ if and only if: for all $x_1 \in X^*$, if $x_1 \sim x_0$, then $f(x_1) \sim f(x_0)$.
- Since continuity of the map $f$ on the entire space $X$ means continuity at *every* standard point $x_0 \in X$, we must generalize this condition to hold for all $x_0 \in X$. This gives us the final statement:
  For all $x_0 \in X$ and for all $x_1 \in X^*$, if $x_0 \sim x_1$, then $f(x_0) \sim f(x_1)$.

**2. Analysis of the given options:**

*   **A. $\forall x_0, x_1 \in X: x_0 \sim x_1 \implies f(x_0) \sim f(x_1)$**
    This restricts both points to be standard. In a Hausdorff space (like the real line), two standard points are infinitesimally close if and only if they are the same point. So this statement is trivially true for any function and carries no information about continuity.

*   **B. $\forall x_0 \in X, \forall x_1 \in X^*: x_0 \sim x_1 \implies f(x_0) \sim f(x_1)$**
    This statement perfectly matches the derivation above. It checks that for every standard point $x_0$, points infinitesimally close to it are mapped to points infinitesimally close to its image. This is the correct nonstandard definition of continuity.

*   **C. $\forall x_0, x_1 \in X*: x_0 \sim x_1 \implies f(x_0) \sim f(x_1)$**
    This is a stronger condition, requiring that *any* pair of infinitesimally close points in $X^*$ (even if both are nonstandard) have images that are infinitesimally close. This is the nonstandard definition of **uniform continuity**. Since not all continuous functions are uniformly continuous, this is incorrect.

*   **D. $\forall x_0, x_1 \in X: f(x_0) \sim f(x_1) \implies x_0 \sim x_1$**
    This only involves standard points. In a Hausdorff space, it states that if $f(x_0) = f(x_1)$, then $x_0=x_1$. This is the definition of an **injective** function, not a continuous one.

*   **E. $\forall x_0 \in X, \forall x_1 \in X^*: f(x_0) \sim f(x_1) \implies x_0 \sim x_1$**
    This is the converse of option B. It is not equivalent to continuity. For example, the constant function $f(x)=0$ is continuous, but this property fails. For this function, $f(x_0) \sim f(x_1)$ for any pair $(x_0, x_1)$, but we can choose $x_0$ and $x_1$ such that $x_0 \not\sim x_1$.

*   **F. $\forall x_0, x_1 \in X*: f(x_0) \sim f(x_1) \implies x_0 \sim x_1$**
    This is the converse of option C (uniform continuity). The same counterexample of a constant function shows it is not equivalent to continuity.

**3. Conclusion:**
The property that is equivalent to continuity is B.
