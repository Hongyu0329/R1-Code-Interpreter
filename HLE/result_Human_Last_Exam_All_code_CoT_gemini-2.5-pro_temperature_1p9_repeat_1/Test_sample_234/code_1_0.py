# A list of boolean values indicating whether each property must always be true for the set S.
# Based on mathematical analysis:
# - Open: True
# - Closed: False
# - Connected: False
# - Compact: False
# - Dense: True
# - Connected complement: False
# - Trivial first singular homology group: True
properties_status = [True, False, False, False, True, False, True]

# Counting the number of properties that are always true.
number_of_true_properties = sum(properties_status)

# The problem states: "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# There is no complex equation here, so we will construct a simple sum representation.
