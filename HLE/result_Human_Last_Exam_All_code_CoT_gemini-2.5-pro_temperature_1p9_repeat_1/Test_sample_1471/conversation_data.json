    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this equation.\n\nFirst, I will decipher the Roman numerals in your equation.\nThe equation is: `Ⅳ/ⅭⅭ-ⅭⅭⅠⅠⅠⅠ=?`\n*   `Ⅳ` is the Roman numeral for 4.\n*   `ⅭⅭ` is the Roman numeral for 200 (100 + 100).\n*   `ⅭⅭⅠⅠⅠⅠ` is a non-standard but understandable Roman numeral for 204 (100 + 100 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1).\n\nSo the equation in modern numbers is `4 / 200 - 204`.\n\nNext, I will write a Python script to calculate the result of this arithmetic operation and print the full equation with the solution.\n\n```python\n# The equation is Ⅳ/ⅭⅭ-ⅭⅭⅠⅠⅠⅠ=?\n# First, let's convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers.\n# Ⅳ = 4\n# ⅭⅭ = 200\n# ⅭⅭⅠⅠⅠⅠ = 204\n\n# Now let's define these numbers as variables in Python.\nnum1 = 4\nnum2 = 200\nnum3 = 204\n\n# Next, we will perform the calculation as per the order of operations (division first, then subtraction).\n# Calculation: 4 / 200 - 204\nresult = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Finally, we will print the equation with the result.\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-203.98>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
