    # The key to this question is the description of the repair: "build-up of layers of filler material".
    # This implies restoring material that has been lost from a surface, rather than fixing a crack or a deformation.

    # Let's analyze the options:
    # A, E (Cracking): TIG welding can repair cracks, but this involves filling a linear void, not necessarily a "build-up of layers".
    # D (Creep Deformation): This is the slow stretching of the blade due to heat and stress. It is a bulk material property change and cannot be fixed by adding layers to the surface. Blades with excessive creep are typically scrapped.
    # B, F (FOD, Oxidation): These can cause localized material loss that might be weld-repaired, but they are not the most common reason for a routine "build-up" procedure.
    # C (Blade Tip Rub and Wear): This is a common service-induced damage where the rotating blade tips make contact with the stationary shroud, grinding material away from the tip. To restore the engine's efficiency, the blade's length and tip profile must be precisely rebuilt. Manual TIG welding is the standard method for this, building up layers of material onto the tip, which is then machined back to its original dimensions.

    explanation = (
        f"The repair method described, 'build-up of layers of filler material', "
        f"is most directly associated with restoring blade dimensions after material has been worn away.\n\n"
        f"The primary cause for this type of wear is '{options[correct_answer_key]}'. This occurs when blade tips rub against the engine casing, "
        f"leading to a loss of material. The manual TIG welding process is ideal for carefully adding new material layer by layer onto the blade tip to restore its original length and profile, which is critical for maintaining engine efficiency.\n\n"
        f"Therefore, this is the main source of damage addressed by this specific repair technique."
