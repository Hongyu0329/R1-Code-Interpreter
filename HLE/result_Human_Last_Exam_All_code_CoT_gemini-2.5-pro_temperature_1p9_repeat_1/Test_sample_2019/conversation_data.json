    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Define the Board and Attacks**: The problem specifies a 5x5 toroidal board. This means the board wraps around edges when checking for attacks. A queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks a queen at `(r2, c2)` if they are in the same row, same column, or on a wrapped diagonal. The condition for a diagonal attack can be elegantly expressed by checking if the shortest wrap-around row distance equals the shortest wrap-around column distance. For a board of size `N`, the distance between rows `r1` and `r2` is `min(|r1 - r2|, N - |r1 - r2|)`.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Algorithm**: We need to find the number of ways to place 4 indistinguishable queens on the board such that no two attack each other. This is a classic combinatorial search problem. A backtracking algorithm is the most straightforward approach to explore all possible valid placements without enumerating every single combination of 4 squares.\n\n3.  **Implement a Backtracking Search**: I will write a recursive function that tries to place one queen at a time on a valid square.\n    *   To avoid counting the same placement multiple times (e.g., placing queens at `(a,b)` then `(c,d)` vs. `(c,d)` then `(a,b)`), the search for the next queen will always start from the square immediately following the previously placed queen. This ensures we only generate unique combinations of queen positions.\n    *   The function will take the number of queens left to place and a list of already placed queens as input.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when all 4 queens have been successfully placed. This counts as one valid way.\n    *   The recursive step involves iterating through all possible squares for the next queen, checking if the placement is safe with respect to the queens already on the board. If it is safe, we recurse to place the next queen.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: The initial call to the recursive function will start with placing 4 queens and an empty board. The function will return the total count of valid placements. The final Python code will execute this search and print the total number.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_n_queens_toroidal():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place Q non-attacking queens on an N x N toroidal board.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5  # Size of the chessboard (5x5)\n    Q = 4  # Number of queens to place\n\n    def check_attack(q1, q2):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if two queens q1=(r1,c1) and q2=(r2,c2) attack each other\n        on an N x N toroidal board.\n        \"\"\"\n        r1, c1 = q1\n        r2, c2 = q2\n\n        # Check for same row or column\n        if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2:\n            return True\n\n        # Check for toroidal diagonals.\n        # Two queens are on a diagonal if their shortest wrap-around distances\n        # in rows and columns are equal.\n        dr = abs(r1 - r2)\n        dc = abs(c1 - c2)\n        if min(dr, N - dr) == min(dc, N - dc):\n            return True\n\n        return False\n\n    def count_placements(queens_to_place, start_index, placed_queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively finds the number of valid queen placements using backtracking.\n        \n        - queens_to_place: The number of queens we still need to place.\n        - start_index: The linear cell index to start searching from.
