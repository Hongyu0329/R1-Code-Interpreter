    "To determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$, we can use the established theory of algebraic groups over finite fields. Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Relate Tori to the Weyl Group**: The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$, up to conjugacy by elements of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, are in one-to-one correspondence with the Frobenius-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\n2.  **Specialize to Type $E_8$**: For a group $G$ of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. A key theorem in the theory of algebraic groups states that this implies any such group $G$ is of \"inner type\" and is \"split\" over any field, including the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Correspondence**: For a split group, the action of the Frobenius endomorphism on the Weyl group is trivial. This means that Frobenius-conjugacy in $W$ is identical to ordinary conjugacy. Therefore, the number of classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is simply the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$. This number is a constant, independent of the field size $q$.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Conjugacy Classes**: The number of conjugacy classes for each of the exceptional Weyl groups is a known result in mathematics. For $W(E_8)$, this number is 112.\n\n5.  **Provide a Computational Demonstration**: To satisfy the request for a code-based solution, the Python script will not only state the final answer but also perform a related calculation. A fundamental property of a Weyl group is its order, which can be computed from the degrees of its fundamental invariants. The script will calculate the order of $W(E_8)$ from its degrees {2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30} and present this calculation clearly.\n\nThe following Python code encapsulates this reasoning and provides the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_e8_tori_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of F_q-rational maximal tori\n    in a reductive group of type E_8.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The degrees of the fundamental invariants for a group of type E_8.\n    # These are well-known constants in Lie theory.\n    degrees_e8 = [2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30]\n\n    # The number of conjugacy classes in W(E_8) is a known constant.\n    # This is the answer to the user's question.\n    num_conjugacy_classes = 112\n\n    print(\"This program determines the number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a group of type E_8.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Theoretical Background\\n\")\n    print(\"The number of G(F_q)-conjugacy classes of F_q-rational maximal tori in a reductive group G\")\n    print(\"over a finite field F_q is given by the number of Frobenius-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group W.\")\n    print(\"\\nFor a group G of type E_8, the group is always 'split' over any field F_q.
