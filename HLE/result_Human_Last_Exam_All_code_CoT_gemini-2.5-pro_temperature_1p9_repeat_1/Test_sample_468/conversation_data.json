    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the specific genus in question, which is \"Perdita\".\n2.  Next, I will research the currently accepted common name for this genus of bees, focusing on sources relevant to its native range in North America.\n3.  Then, I will investigate the origin of this common name by searching for the earliest citable publication, such as a field guide or scientific book, where the name was used or popularized.\n4.  Finally, I will create a Python script that stores these two pieces of information (the name and the year) in variables and prints them in the specified format: `<name>, <year>`.\n\n```python\ndef find_bee_common_name_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the common name and year it was coined for the bee genus Perdita.\n    The information is based on research of entomological literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita\" is \"Fairy Bees\".\n    common_name = \"Fairy Bees\"\n\n    # While the term may have been used colloquially earlier, a prominent, citable\n    # use that helped popularize the name is in the 2014 book \"The Bee: A Natural History\".\n    year_coined = 2014\n\n    # The final output needs to be in the format \"<name>, <year>\".\n    # The f-string below constructs this output.\n    final_answer = f\"{common_name}, {year_coined}\"\n    \n    print(final_answer)\n\nfind_bee_common_name_info()\n```\n<<<Fairy Bees, 2014>>>"
