    Calculates and prints the maximum possible cardinality for the set S.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The set of all Diophantine equations is countably infinite (denoted ℵ₀).
       Any subset, such as S, must therefore have a cardinality less than or
       equal to ℵ₀.

    2. To show that ℵ₀ is achievable, we need to construct a countably infinite
       set of Diophantine equations that fits the criteria. This can be done
       using iterated consistency statements (Con(ZFC), Con(ZFC+Con(ZFC)), etc.),
       which are known to be true but unprovable Π₁ sentences.

    3. We then need a statement ψ, independent of ZFC, that can prove all these
       statements. A large cardinal axiom, such as "there exists an inaccessible
       cardinal," serves this purpose. The theory ZFC + "∃ an inaccessible"
       can prove the entire hierarchy of consistency statements.

    4. This construction shows that a set S of size ℵ₀ is possible.
       Therefore, the maximum possible cardinality is ℵ₀.
