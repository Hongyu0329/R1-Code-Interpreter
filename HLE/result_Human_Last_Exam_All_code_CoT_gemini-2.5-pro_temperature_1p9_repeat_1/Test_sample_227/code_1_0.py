# Plan:
# 1. Define the properties of the high-efficiency "module" we discovered.
#    - A module consists of two observers watching [t, t+1] and [t+0.5, t+1.5].
#    - Time covered by one module: 1.5 minutes.
#    - Distance gained in one module: 2 meters.
# 2. Determine how many full modules can fit into the 7-minute journey.
# 3. Calculate the distance covered by these full modules.
# 4. Calculate the remaining time that needs to be covered.
# 5. Calculate the distance covered in the remaining time (this will be 1 meter per minute, as it's the simplest case).
# 6. Sum the distances to find the total maximal distance.

total_time = 7  # minutes

# Properties of our building block module
module_time_coverage = 1.5  # minutes
module_distance_gain = 2     # meters

# Calculate how many full modules fit into the first part of the journey
num_modules = int(total_time / module_time_coverage)
print(f"We can fit {num_modules} full high-efficiency modules into the journey.")

# Calculate time and distance covered by these modules
time_covered_by_modules = num_modules * module_time_coverage
distance_from_modules = num_modules * module_distance_gain
print(f"The {num_modules} modules cover the first {time_covered_by_modules} minutes and the snail travels {distance_from_modules} meters.")

# Calculate remaining time
remaining_time = total_time - time_covered_by_modules
print(f"There are {remaining_time} minutes remaining to cover.")

# The remaining time is covered by a simple 1 observer/minute setup.
# The distance traveled in this phase is 1 meter per minute.
distance_from_remainder = remaining_time * 1
print(f"In the final {remaining_time} minutes, the snail travels an additional {distance_from_remainder} meters.")

# Calculate the total distance
total_distance = distance_from_modules + distance_from_remainder
print("\nThe final equation for the total distance is:")
print(f"({num_modules} modules * {module_distance_gain} m/module) + ({remaining_time} minutes * 1 m/minute) = {distance_from_modules} + {distance_from_remainder} = {total_distance} meters.")
