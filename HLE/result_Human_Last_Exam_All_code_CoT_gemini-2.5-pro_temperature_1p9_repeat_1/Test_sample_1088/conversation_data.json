    "To determine the number of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs) in a 6-311G** basis set, we need to apply it to a specific atom or molecule. A basis set is a set of rules, and the total number of functions depends on the atoms present.\n\nI will calculate this for a common example molecule: **Methane (CH4)**.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G**):**\n    *   **For Heavy Atoms (like Carbon):**\n        *   `6-`: The core orbitals (1s) are represented by 1 contracted Gaussian function (CGF) built from **6** PGFs.\n        *   `-311`: The valence orbitals (2s, 2p) are \"triple-split\". They are represented by three CGFs. The first is built from **3** PGFs, the second from **1** PGF, and the third from **1** PGF.\n        *   `*` (first asterisk): Adds one set of d-type polarization functions. A set of Cartesian d-functions has **6** components (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz), each being a single PGF.\n    *   **For Hydrogen Atoms:**\n        *   `311`: All orbitals (just 1s for H) are represented by three CGFs, built from **3**, **1**, and **1** PGFs respectively.\n        *   `*` (second asterisk): Adds one set of p-type polarization functions. This set has **3** components (p_x, p_y, p_z), each being a single PGF.\n\n2.  **Calculate PGFs per Atom:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):**\n        *   1s orbital: 6 PGFs\n        *   2s orbital: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs\n        *   2p orbitals (px, py, pz): 3 * (3 + 1 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15 PGFs\n        *   Polarization (d-functions): 6 PGFs\n        *   *Total for C = 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = 32 PGFs*\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):**\n        *   1s orbital: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs\n        *   Polarization (p-functions): 3 PGFs\n        *   *Total for H = 5 + 3 = 8 PGFs*\n\n3.  **Calculate Total for Methane (CH4):**\n    *   Methane has 1 Carbon atom and 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total PGFs = (1 * PGFs for C) + (4 * PGFs for H)\n\n4.  **Python Code:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to perform this calculation, print the breakdown, show the final equation, and output the answer.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_methane_pgfs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total number of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs)\n    for Methane (CH4) using the 6-311G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the number of atoms in Methane (CH4)\n    num_carbon_atoms = 1\n    num_hydrogen_atoms = 4\n\n    # PGFs for Carbon in 6-311G**\n    # Core (1s): 6\n    # Valence s (2s): 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\n    # Valence p (2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z): 3 * (3 + 1 + 1) = 15\n    # Polarization d-functions: 6\n    pgf_per_carbon = 6 + 5 + 15 + 6\n    \n    # PGFs for Hydrogen in 6-311G**\n    # Valence s (1s): 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\n    # Polarization p-functions: 3\n    pgf_per_hydrogen = 5 + 3\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of PGFs\n    total_pgfs = (num_carbon_atoms * pgf_per_carbon) + (num_hydrogen_atoms * pgf_per_hydrogen)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation\n    print(\"Calculation for Methane (CH4) with 6-311G** basis set:\")\n    print(f\"PGFs per Carbon atom = {pgf_per_carbon}\")\n    print(f\"PGFs per Hydrogen atom = {pgf_per_hydrogen}\")\n    print(\"\\nTotal PGFs = (Number of C atoms * PGFs/C) + (Number of H atoms * PGFs/H)\")\n    print(f\"Total PGFs = ({num_carbon_atoms} * {pgf_per_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} * {pgf_per_hydrogen}) = {total_pgfs}\")\n\n    # Return the final number for the answer format\n    return total_pgfs\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    final_answer = calculate_methane_pgfs()\n    print(f\"\\n<<<For methane (CH4), the 6-311G** basis set has {final_answer} primitive Gaussians.>>>\")\n\n<<<64>>>\n```"
