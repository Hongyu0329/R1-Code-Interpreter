    "My plan is to solve this topological problem by breaking it down into established theorems.\n\n1.  **Identify the object of interest:** The problem asks for the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum. Let's call this remainder $\\beta X^*$.\n2.  **Determine the topological nature of $\\beta X^*$**: I will use a known theorem from topology which states that for any metric continuum $X$ (a category that includes hereditary indecomposable continua), the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum.\n3.  **Count the composants:** I will then apply another classical theorem, by Mazurkiewicz, which describes the number of composants in any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum. This theorem states that such a space has $c$ (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n4.  **Synthesize the result:** Since the number of composants is always $c$ under these conditions, the maximum possible number is also $c$.\n5.  **Present the answer in code:** As required, I will write a Python script that formalizes this reasoning and prints the conclusion. The prompt's unusual requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\" will be handled by presenting the answer as the symbolic equation $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ and printing its numerical components, 2 and 0.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder\n    of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum X with one point x removed.\n\n    The solution is based on established theorems in topology.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Characterize the Stone-Cech remainder.\n    # Let R = beta(X \\ {x}) \\ (X \\ {x}) be the remainder.\n    # For any metric continuum X, the remainder R is a non-degenerate, indecomposable continuum.\n    # The property that X is hereditary indecomposable is a specific case of a continuum.\n    remainder_properties = {\n        \"is_continuum\": True,\n        \"is_indecomposable\": True,\n        \"is_non_degenerate\": True, # It's not a single point\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: State the number of composants for such a space.\n    # A classical theorem by Mazurkiewicz states that any non-degenerate indecomposable\n    # metric continuum has 'c' (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n    if remainder_properties[\"is_non_degenerate\"] and remainder_properties[\"is_indecomposable\"]:\n        # The number of composants is 'c'.\n        num_composants_symbol = \"c\"\n        num_composants_expression = \"2^aleph_0\"\n\n        # Step 3: Print the final answer and its components as requested.\n        # The question asks for the maximum possible number.
