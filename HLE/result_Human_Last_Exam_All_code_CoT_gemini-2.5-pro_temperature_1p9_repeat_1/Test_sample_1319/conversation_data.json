    "Here is the plan to identify the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, other than Mount Olympus:\n\n1.  First, I will compile a list of notable mountains that are explicitly mentioned in the text of the Iliad. I will exclude Mount Olympus as per the user's request.\n2.  Next, I will identify the modern-day geographical locations and names of these ancient mountains.\n3.  I will then find the official elevation (height) for each of these mountains.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores these mountains and their elevations, compares them, and prints the name and elevation of the tallest one. The script will also display the elevations of the other mountains for comparison, as if showing the \"equation\" of the comparison.\n\n```python\nimport operator\n\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, besides Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1, 2, 3: A dictionary of mountains from the Iliad (excluding Olympus)\n    # and their corresponding real-world elevations in meters.\n    # Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı) in Turkey, from where the gods watched the Trojan War.\n    # Mount Athos in Greece, which Hera flew past.\n    # Mount Samothrace (Fengari), where Poseidon sat to watch the war.\n    # Mount Pelion in Greece, from where the wood for Achilles' spear came.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ida\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611\n    }\n\n    # Step 4: Compare the elevations to find the tallest mountain.\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))[0]\n    tallest_mountain_height = mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    print(\"Comparing the elevations of historical mountains from the Iliad (other than Olympus):\")\n    # \"output each number in the final equation!\"\n    # The \"equation\" here is the comparison of the heights.\n    for name, height in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {height} meters\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe tallest among these is {tallest_mountain_name} with an elevation of {tallest_mountain_height} meters.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
