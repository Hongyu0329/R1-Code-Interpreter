# The problem asks for the order type of X, the set of possible cofinalities of 2^omega.
#
# Mathematical Derivation:
# 1. Let kappa = 2^omega and lambda = cf(kappa).
# 2. We are given that kappa is singular, so lambda < kappa.
# 3. By KÃ¶nig's theorem, lambda is an uncountable regular cardinal.
# 4. We are given kappa < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}, so lambda < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
# 5. The set X of *possible* cofinalities consists of all uncountable regular
#    cardinals below the given bound. This relies on consistency results in set theory
#    which show that cf(2^omega) can be any such cardinal.
# 6. Let Gamma = omega_{omega+5}. X is the set of all uncountable regular cardinals
#    less than aleph_Gamma.
# 7. The order type of X is the order type of the set of indices of these cardinals.
#    Let I = {alpha | 1 <= alpha < Gamma and aleph_alpha is regular}.
# 8. This set of indices I has order type Gamma, because it contains the set of all
#    successor ordinals less than Gamma (which has order type Gamma) and is also
#    a subset of all ordinals less than Gamma (which has order type Gamma).
# 9. So, the order type of X is Gamma = omega_{omega+5}.

# The integer N from the expression omega_{omega+N} in the problem is:
N = 5

# Using Unicode for the omega symbol for clear representation.
omega = u'\u03C9'

# Now we print the final answer, which is the symbolic representation of the ordinal.
# The expression explicitly includes the number from the problem statement.
print("The order type of X is given by the ordinal:")
print(f"{omega}_({omega} + {N})")
