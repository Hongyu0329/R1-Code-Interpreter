    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the simplicial volume of a surface.** The simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface of genus $g$, denoted $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$, depends on its genus. For surfaces with genus $g \\geq 2$, they admit a hyperbolic structure. Their simplicial volume is directly related to their Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$. The formula is:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$ for $g \\geq 2$.\n    For $g=0$ (sphere) or $g=1$ (torus), the simplicial volume is 0.\n\n2.  **Calculate the simplicial volume for each surface.**\n    *   For the first surface, $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1 = 31$. Since $31 \\ge 2$, its simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n    *   For the second surface, $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g_2 = 17$. Since $17 \\ge 2$, its simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\n3.  **Use the product formula for simplicial volume.** For two closed, orientable manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$ with positive simplicial volumes, the simplicial volume of their product is given by Gromov's product formula:\n    $\\|M_1 \\times M_2\\| = \\binom{\\dim M_1 + \\dim M_2}{\\dim M_1} \\|M_1\\| \\|M_2\\|$\n    Here, both $M_1 = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $M_2 = \\Sigma_{17}$ are 2-dimensional surfaces, so $\\dim M_1 = 2$ and $\\dim M_2 = 2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the binomial coefficient.**\n    The coefficient is $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2! (4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = 6$.\n\n5.  **Compute the final result.** We multiply the binomial coefficient by the individual simplicial volumes:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64 = 46080$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints out each step as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_simplicial_volume():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces Σ_g1 and Σ_g2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the genera of the two surfaces\n    g1 = 31\n    g2 = 17\n\n    # The dimension of a surface is 2\n    n1 = 2\n    n2 = 2\n\n    # For a surface Σ_g, the simplicial volume is non-zero only if g >= 2.\n    # If either g < 2, the simplicial volume of the product is 0.\n    if g1 < 2 or g2 < 2:\n        print(\"One of the surfaces has genus less than 2, so its simplicial volume is 0.\")\n        print(\"Therefore, the simplicial volume of the product is 0.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the simplicial volume of each surface using the formula ||Σ_g|| = 4 * (g - 1)\n    sv1 = 4 * (g1 - 1)\n    sv2 = 4 * (g2 - 1)\n\n    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n1+n2, n1) for the product formula\n    n_sum = n1 + n2\n    try:\n        # math.comb is available in Python 3.8+\n        C = math.comb(n_sum, n1)\n    except AttributeError:\n        # Fallback for older Python versions\n        C = math.factorial(n_sum) // (math.factorial(n1) * math.factorial(n2))\n\n    # Calculate the total simplicial volume of the product\n    total_sv = C * sv1 * sv2\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"The simplicial volume of the product of surfaces Σ_g1 x Σ_g2 is computed as follows:\")\n    print(\"Formula: ||Σ_g1 x Σ_g2|| = C(n1+n2, n1) * ||Σ_g1|| * ||Σ_g2||, where n1=dim(Σ_g1), n2=dim(Σ_g2)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Compute the simplicial volume of each surface.\")\n    print(f\"||Σ_{g1}|| = 4 * ({g1} - 1) = {sv1}\")\n    print(f\"||Σ_{g2}|| = 4 * ({g2} - 1) = {sv2}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Compute the binomial coefficient.\")\n    print(f\"C({n1}+{n2}, {n1}) = C({n_sum}, {n1}) = {C}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Compute the final simplicial volume of the product.\")\n    print(f\"||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = {C} * {sv1} * {sv2} = {total_sv}\")\n\nsolve_simplicial_volume()\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
