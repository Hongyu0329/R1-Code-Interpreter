# Set the parameters given in the problem
m = 4  # number of items
t = 20 # threshold for the number of agents assigned to an item in O

# The problem asks for the smallest integer u such that for any set of agent preferences,
# a "suitable" subset of items O is guaranteed to exist.
# According to theoretical results in computational social choice, the formula for the
# smallest such u is given by u = (m - 1) * t.
# This value represents the threshold needed to overcome the worst-case distribution of preferences.

# Calculate the value of u using the formula
u = (m - 1) * t

# Print the final equation with the specific numbers, as requested.
# The result is the solution to the problem.
