def solve_go_puzzle():
    """
    This function encapsulates the reasoning to solve the Go puzzle.

    Board State:
    - Black (X): A2, B3, B4, C1, C2
    - White (O): B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5

    Analysis:
    The black stones form a large, weak formation composed of three subgroups:
    - G1: {A2}
    - G2: {B3, B4}
    - G3: {C1, C2}

    The key to killing this formation is to attack the points that connect these subgroups.
    The vital points are A3 and B2.

    Candidate Moves Analysis:
    - W @ A3: This move puts group G2 in atari.
        - If Black tries to save G2 (with B@A4), the new group is also in atari. White captures it and proceeds to kill the rest.
        - If Black sacrifices G2 to connect the other groups (with B@B2), White captures G2 and then methodically captures the remaining connected group.
        - Conclusion: W @ A3 is a successful killing move.

    - W @ B2, W @ A4, W @ B1, W @ A1: These moves also attack liberties. However, they allow Black to sacrifice one subgroup to create a living group with the remaining stones. For example, after W@B2, Black can play B@A3, giving up G3 but creating a new group {A2,A3,B3,B4} which will live. Therefore, these are not killing moves.

    The only move that initiates a kill sequence is A3.
