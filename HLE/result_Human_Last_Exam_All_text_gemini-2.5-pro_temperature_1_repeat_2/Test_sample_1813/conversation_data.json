    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the relationship between rational numbers and generalized Markov numbers' continued fractions.\n\nThe theory of Markov numbers, and its generalization to any rational number \\( p/q \\), establishes a connection between the rational number and a specific quadratic irrationality. The continued fraction of this quadratic irrationality is what is referred to as the \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\)\".\n\nThe construction rule is as follows:\n1.  Find the simple continued fraction of the rational number \\( p/q \\). Let's assume \\( 0 < p/q < 1 \\), so its continued fraction is of the form \\( [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n] \\).\n2.  The sequence of partial quotients is \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\).\n3.  A palindromic sequence \\( W \\) is constructed by concatenating this sequence with its reverse. That is, \\( W = (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_2, a_1) \\).\n4.  The associated continued fraction is the purely periodic continued fraction \\( [0; \\overline{W}] \\).\n\n### Step 2: Compute the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\).\n\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\).\n\n1.  Start with the fraction \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\).\n    \\[ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} \\]\n2.  Now, find the integer part of \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n    \\[ \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n    The first partial quotient is \\( a_1 = 1 \\).\n3.  Take the reciprocal of the fractional part \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n    \\[ \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n4.  Find the integer part of \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n    \\[ \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n    The second partial quotient is \\( a_2 = 1 \\).\n5.  Take the reciprocal of the fractional part \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n    \\[ \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 3 \\]\n    The third partial quotient is \\( a_3 = 3 \\). Since this is an integer, the algorithm terminates.\n\nSo, the continued fraction for \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n\n**Careful point:** We use the standard form of the continued fraction, which is unique and does not end with 1 (unless the fraction itself is 1). The Euclidean algorithm provides this standard form.\n\n### Step 3: Construct the palindromic period.\n\nThe sequence of partial quotients for \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n\n1.  The sequence is \\( A = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n2.  The reverse of this sequence is \\( A^R = (3, 1, 1) \\).\n3.  The palindromic period \\( W \\) is the concatenation of \\( A \\) and \\( A^R \\).\n    \\[ W = (A, A^R) = (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\]\n\n**Careful point:** The construction of the palindrome is crucial. The correct method is to append the reverse of the sequence of partial quotients to the original sequence.\n\n### Step 4: Write the final continued fraction.\n\nThe continued fraction associated with \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the purely periodic continued fraction with the period \\( W \\) we just found.\n\nTherefore, the continued fraction is \\( [0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}] \\).\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n-   The rational number is \\( 4/7 \\).\n-   Its continued fraction is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n-   The sequence of partial quotients is \\( (1, 1, 3) \\).\n-   The palindromic period is constructed as \\( (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\).\n-   The associated continued fraction is \\( [0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}] \\).\n\n<<<[0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]>>>"
