    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to analyze the given nucleotide sequence, find the correct reading frame, and translate it into a protein sequence using the one-letter amino acid codes. A crucial piece of information is that the sequence is from the **middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)**. An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain a stop codon. This implies that the correct reading frame will be the one that is \"open,\" i.e., lacks any internal stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).\n\n2.  **The Nucleotide Sequence:**\n    `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n    The total length of this sequence is 99 nucleotides.\n\n3.  **Examine the Three Forward Reading Frames:** A DNA sequence can be read in three different frames on the forward strand. We will translate the sequence in each frame and look for stop codons.\n\n    *   **Frame +1 (starting from the 1st nucleotide):**\n        *   Codons: `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ...`\n        *   Translation: `G H C C STOP R R ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** The fifth codon, `tag`, is a stop codon. Since the sequence is from the middle of an ORF, this frame is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Frame +2 (starting from the 2nd nucleotide):**\n        *   We ignore the first nucleotide (`g`). The sequence to translate starts with `gac...` and is 98 nucleotides long.\n        *   Codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ... gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c`\n        *   Translation: `D I V V S E D ... A E R L E K W`\n        *   **Analysis:** A full scan of the codons in this frame (`gac`, `att`, `gtt`, `gtt`, `agc`, `gaa`, `gac`, `ttg`, `aat`, `gga`, `acg`, `gtg`, `aag`, `ttt`, `tca`, `agc`, `tct`, `tta`, `ccc`, `tac`, `ccc`, `aat`, `aat`, `ctt`, `aac`, `agt`, `gtc`, `ctg`, `gct`, `gag`, `cga`, `ctg`, `gag`, `aag`, `tgg`) reveals no stop codons. This is a valid open reading frame.\n\n    *   **Frame +3 (starting from the 3rd nucleotide):**\n        *   We ignore the first two nucleotides (`gg`). The sequence to translate starts with `aca...` and is 97 nucleotides long.\n        *   Codons: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg ...`\n        *   Translation: `T L L L A K T STOP M ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** The eighth codon, `tga`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this frame is also incorrect.\n\n4.  **Identify the Correct Frame and Translate:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, **Frame +2 is the correct reading frame** because it is the only one without stop codons.\n    *   The sequence in Frame +2 is 98 nucleotides long. This means it can encode `floor(98 / 3) = 32` complete codons, with a remainder of 2 nucleotides (`gc`) at the end. The resulting protein will be 32 amino acids long.\n    *   We will translate the first 32 codons (96 nucleotides) of the Frame +2 sequence.\n    *   The nucleotide sequence to be translated is:\n        `gacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactg`\n    *   Translating codon by codon:\n        *   `gac` -> D (Asp)\n        *   `att` -> I (Ile)\n        *   `gtt` -> V (Val)\n        *   `gtt` -> V (Val)\n        *   `agc` -> S (Ser)\n        *   `gaa` -> E (Glu)\n        *   `gac` -> D (Asp)\n        *   `ttg` -> L (Leu)\n        *   `aat` -> N (Asn)\n        *   `gga` -> G (Gly)\n        *   `acg` -> T (Thr)\n        *   `gtg` -> V (Val)\n        *   `aag` -> K (Lys)\n        *   `ttt` -> F (Phe)\n        *   `tca` -> S (Ser)\n        *   `agc` -> S (Ser)\n        *   `tct` -> S (Ser)\n        *   `tta` -> L (Leu)\n        *   `ccc` -> P (Pro)\n        *   `tac` -> Y (Tyr)\n        *   `ccc` -> P (Pro)\n        *   `aat` -> N (Asn)\n        *   `aat` -> N (Asn)\n        *   `ctt` -> L (Leu)\n        *   `aac` -> N (Asn)\n        *   `agt` -> S (Ser)\n        *   `gtc` -> V (Val)\n        *   `ctg` -> L (Leu)\n        *   `gct` -> A (Ala)\n        *   `gag` -> E (Glu)\n        *   `cga` -> R (Arg)\n        *   `ctg` -> L (Leu)\n\n5.  **Final Protein Sequence:**\n    Combining the one-letter codes gives the final 32-amino acid protein sequence.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe correct reading frame is **Frame +2**.\nThe translated protein sequence is:\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERL>>>"
