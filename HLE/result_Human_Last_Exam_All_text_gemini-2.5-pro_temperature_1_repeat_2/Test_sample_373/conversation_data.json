    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph with 10 nodes under randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Graph Structure: The Barbell Graph**\n\n*   A **barbell graph** with $N$ nodes, where $N$ is even, is typically constructed by taking two identical complete graphs ($K_{N/2}$) and connecting them with a single edge.\n*   In this problem, we have $N=10$ nodes. This means the graph consists of two complete graphs on $N/2 = 5$ nodes, i.e., two $K_5$ cliques.\n*   Let's call these cliques $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n*   The **bottleneck edge** is the single edge that connects a node from $C_1$ to a node from $C_2$.\n\n**2. Understand the Process: Randomized Uniform Gossiping**\n\n*   **Randomized uniform gossiping** is a process where each node that holds a piece of information (a \"rumor\") selects one of its neighbors uniformly at random to pass the information to.\n*   This process is mathematically equivalent to a **random walk** on the graph. A walker at a node $u$ moves to one of its neighbors, say $v$, with a probability of $1/d(u)$, where $d(u)$ is the degree (number of neighbors) of node $u$.\n*   The question asks for \"the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge\". Without any specified starting conditions (e.g., which node starts the gossip), this question typically refers to the long-term, average probability. This corresponds to the probability of traversing the edge when the random walk has reached its **stationary distribution**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Number of Edges ($|E|$).**\n\n*   The number of edges in a complete graph $K_n$ is given by the formula $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n*   For each $K_5$ clique, the number of internal edges is $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n*   Since there are two such cliques, they contribute $2 \\times 10 = 20$ edges.\n*   There is one additional edge, the bottleneck edge, connecting the two cliques.\n*   Therefore, the total number of edges in the graph is $|E| = 20 + 1 = 21$.\n\n**4. Determine the Probability in the Stationary Distribution**\n\n*   For any connected, non-bipartite, undirected graph, a random walk has a unique stationary distribution. In this distribution, the probability of being at any specific node $u$ is proportional to its degree: $\\pi(u) = \\frac{d(u)}{2|E|}$.\n*   The probability of traversing a directed edge from node $u$ to node $v$ in one step of the random walk, while in the stationary state, is given by:\n    $P(u \\to v) = \\pi(u) \\times (\\text{Prob of choosing } v \\text{ from } u) = \\frac{d(u)}{2|E|} \\times \\frac{1}{d(u)} = \\frac{1}{2|E|}$.\n*   This result is remarkable: in the stationary state, every possible directed traversal of an edge has the same probability, $1/(2|E|)$.\n*   We are interested in \"sampling the bottleneck edge\". Let the bottleneck edge be $e_b = (u,v)$, where $u$ is in $C_1$ and $v$ is in $C_2$. This edge can be sampled (or traversed) in two directions: from $u$ to $v$, or from $v$ to $u$.\n*   The total probability of sampling the edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events:\n    $P(\\text{sampling } e_b) = P(u \\to v) + P(v \\to u)$\n*   Using the formula from the previous point:\n    $P(\\text{sampling } e_b) = \\frac{1}{2|E|} + \\frac{1}{2|E|} = \\frac{2}{2|E|} = \\frac{1}{|E|}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   From Step 3, we found the total number of edges $|E| = 21$.\n*   From Step 4, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is $1/|E|$.\n*   Therefore, the probability is $1/21$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Graph Definition:** The interpretation of \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" is crucial. The chosen structure (two $K_5$s connected by one edge) is the most standard and common one. Other interpretations are possible but less likely to be the intended meaning.\n2.  **Process Definition:** Understanding that \"randomized uniform gossiping\" corresponds to a random walk and that \"the probability\" implies a stationary state analysis is key. An alternative interpretation (e.g., starting from a uniformly random node) would yield a different result ($1/25$), but the stationary state analysis is more standard for evaluating the intrinsic properties of a graph process.\n3.  **Calculation:** The number of edges in the complete subgraphs and the total number of edges must be calculated correctly. A miscalculation here would directly lead to a wrong final answer. The formula is $|E| = 2 \\times \\binom{N/2}{2} + 1$.\n\nThe final result is the reciprocal of the total number of edges in the graph.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
