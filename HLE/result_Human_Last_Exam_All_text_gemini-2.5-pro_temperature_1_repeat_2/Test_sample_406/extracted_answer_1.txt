An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` for the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` is a solution to the system `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z`. The standard conditions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of such a point are:
1.  **Completeness:** The non-empty sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces with metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`, respectively.
2.  **Combined Contraction:** There exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, and `z1, z2 ∈ Z`, the following inequality holds:
    `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`
