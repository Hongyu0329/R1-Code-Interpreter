    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a solution for a system of three equations involving three functions F, G, and H. To determine the conditions for the existence of such a point, we analyze the problem within the framework of metric fixed-point theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**\n\nFirst, we must clarify the functions and the definition of the fixed point. The question specifies `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. There appears to be a typo in the third function; based on the \"FGH-tripled\" terminology, we assume the third function is `H: Z*Y*X→Z`.\n\nGiven the functions:\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet of elements `(x, y, z)`, with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z`, that is a simultaneous solution to the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Step 2: Reframe as a Single Fixed-Point Problem**\n\nThe most effective way to find conditions for a solution to this system is to reformulate it as a single fixed-point problem. We can combine the three sets into a single product space and the three functions into a single operator.\n\n*   Define the product space `W = X × Y × Z`.\n*   Define a single operator `T: W → W` as follows:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n*   An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` is now equivalent to a standard fixed point of the operator `T`, i.e., a point `w ∈ W` such that `T(w) = w`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem provides powerful sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point. The theorem requires two main conditions:\n1.  The space must be a **complete metric space**.\n2.  The operator must be a **contraction mapping**.\n\nThis leads to the conditions for the existence of our FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n**Step 4: State the Conditions Explicitly**\n\nApplying the requirements of the Banach theorem to our operator `T` on the space `W` gives us the following specific conditions.\n\n*   **Condition 1: Complete Metric Spaces**\n    The sets X, Y, and Z must be **complete metric spaces**. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`. If X, Y, and Z are complete, then their product space `W = X × Y × Z` is also a complete metric space under a standard product metric (e.g., the sum metric or max metric).\n\n*   **Condition 2: Combined Contraction Mapping**\n    The combined operator `T` must be a contraction mapping on `W`. To express this, we can use the sum metric on `W`: `d_W((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`.\n    The operator `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k` such that `0 ≤ k < 1` and for all pairs of points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n    \n    `d_W(T(x1, y1, z1), T(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ k * d_W((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2))`\n\n    Substituting the definitions of `T` and `d_W`, this translates to the central condition on F, G, and H:\n    \n    `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Typo Assumption:** The analysis relies on the assumption that the third function is `H: Z × Y × X → Z` and not a second function `G`.\n2.  **Completeness is Crucial:** The metric spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be complete. This ensures that the Cauchy sequences generated by iterating the operator `T` converge to a point within the space.\n3.  **Non-Empty Sets:** The sets X, Y, and Z must be non-empty.\n4.  **Sufficient Conditions:** These conditions are sufficient to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the FGH-tripled fixed point. They are not always necessary; other theorems might apply under different assumptions (e.g., in spaces without a metric).\n5.  **Contraction is Key:** The combined contractive inequality is the most important condition. It ensures that iterations of the functions bring points closer together, ultimately leading to convergence to a single fixed point.\n\n---\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` is a solution to the system:\n*   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n*   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n*   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nThe conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are given by an application of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem:\n\n**1. Structural Condition:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **complete metric spaces** with respective metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n\n**2. Contraction Condition:** There must exist a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, and `z1, z2 ∈ Z`, the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` collectively satisfy the following inequality:\n`d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`\n\nIf these two conditions are met, there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` for the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` is a solution to the system `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z`. The standard conditions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of such a point are:\n1.  **Completeness:** The non-empty sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces with metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`, respectively.\n2.  **Combined Contraction:** There exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, and `z1, z2 ∈ Z`, the following inequality holds:\n    `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`>>>"
