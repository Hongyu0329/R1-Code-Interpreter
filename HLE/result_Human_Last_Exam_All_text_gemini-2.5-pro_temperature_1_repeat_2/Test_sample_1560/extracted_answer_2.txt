The final state of the system is a probabilistic mixture of five possible outcomes. Measuring ququint A after the gate Q is applied results in one of the following final states for the total system, with the specified probability:
1.  **State:** $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$, with **Probability:** 1/5
2.  **State:** $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$, with **Probability:** 1/5
3.  **State:** $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$, with **Probability:** 3/10
4.  **State:** $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$, with **Probability:** 1/5
5.  **State:** $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$, with **Probability:** 1/10
