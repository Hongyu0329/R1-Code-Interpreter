    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Simplicial Volume and Key Formulas**\n\nThe simplicial volume of a closed, oriented n-manifold $M$, denoted by $\\|M\\|$, is a topological invariant that measures the \"minimal volume\" of the manifold in a certain homological sense. We will use two key results established by Gromov.\n\n1.  **Simplicial Volume of a Surface:** For a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$, its simplicial volume is given by:\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 0$ if $g=0$ or $g=1$.\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2(2g-2) = 4g-4$ if $g \\ge 2$.\n    Here, $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface. The condition $g \\ge 2$ is crucial, as these are the surfaces that admit a hyperbolic metric, and their fundamental groups are non-amenable.\n\n2.  **Product Formula for Simplicial Volume:** For two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ of dimension $m$ and $N$ of dimension $n$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n    $$ \\|M \\times N\\| = C_{m+n}^{m} \\|M\\| \\|N\\| $$\n    where $C_{k}^{j} = \\frac{k!}{j!(k-j)!}$ is the binomial coefficient. This formula applies as long as the product of the fundamental classes is non-zero, which is the case for products of closed oriented manifolds.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Simplicial Volume of Each Factor Surface**\n\nWe are given the product of two surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n*   **For the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$:**\n    *   The genus is $g_1 = 31$.\n    *   Since $31 \\ge 2$, we can use the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g-4$.\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n\n*   **For the surface $\\Sigma_{17}$:**\n    *   The genus is $g_2 = 17$.\n    *   Since $17 \\ge 2$, we again use the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g-4$.\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is essential to check that the genera of both surfaces are greater than or equal to 2. If one of them were 0 or 1, its simplicial volume would be 0, making the final answer 0. In this case, both $31 \\ge 2$ and $17 \\ge 2$, so both factors have non-zero simplicial volume.\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Product Formula**\n\nNow we apply the product formula to find the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n*   Let $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$.\n*   The dimension of $M$ is $m=2$.\n*   The dimension of $N$ is $n=2$.\n*   The total dimension of the product manifold is $m+n = 4$.\n\nThe formula is $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = C_{2+2}^{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the binomial coefficient:\n$$ C_{4}^{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 $$\n\n**Careful Point:** Be careful to use the correct dimensions ($m=2, n=2$) for the binomial coefficient calculation. A common mistake is to forget this coefficient or use the wrong values.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nNow we substitute all the calculated values back into the product formula:\n\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = C_{4}^{2} \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64$\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 720 \\times 64$\n\nLet's perform the final multiplication:\n$720 \\times 64 = 46080$\n\nThus, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 46080.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{46080}$.\n<<<46080>>>"
