The optimal combination is a **Zirconium (Zr)** metal center coordinated to a **Constrained-Geometry Ligand (CGL)** of the bridged cyclopentadienyl-amido type, which is chemically grafted onto a **mesoporous silica (e.g., SBA-15)** support. This system can be switched between its two functions by changing the reaction conditions: it performs efficient olefin polymerization in the presence of monomer and a co-catalyst (like MAO) and effectively degrades polyolefins via hydrogenolysis into short alkanes at high temperature and high hydrogen pressure.
