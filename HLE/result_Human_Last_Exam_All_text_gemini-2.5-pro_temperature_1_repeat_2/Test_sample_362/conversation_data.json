    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Their Structures**\n\n*   **Carbonyl Compound:** The first reactant is pivalaldehyde.\n    *   The \"pival\" prefix refers to the pivaloyl group, which contains a tert-butyl group ((CH₃)₃C-) attached to a carbonyl.\n    *   Since it's an aldehyde, the carbonyl carbon is also bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n    *   The structure of pivalaldehyde is (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent (Ylide):** The second reactant is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane.\n    *   \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" indicates the Ph₃P= group (where Ph is a phenyl group, C₆H₅). This is a phosphorus ylide.\n    *   \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)\" describes the organic group attached to the phosphorus.\n        *   \"ethylidene\" is a two-carbon group attached by a double bond: =CH-CH₃.\n        *   \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" means a 2-chlorophenyl group (a benzene ring with a chlorine atom at the ortho position) is attached to the second carbon of the ethylidene group.\n    *   Combining these parts, the structure of the ylide is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Wittig Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a method for synthesizing alkenes. The core of the reaction is the replacement of the carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) of an aldehyde or ketone with the carbon-phosphorus double bond (C=P) of a phosphorus ylide.\n\n*   The ylide carbon (nucleophilic) attacks the carbonyl carbon (electrophilic).\n*   This forms a four-membered ring intermediate (an oxaphosphetane).\n*   This intermediate collapses to form two new double bonds: a carbon-carbon double bond (the alkene product) and a phosphorus-oxygen double bond (triphenylphosphine oxide, Ph₃P=O, as a byproduct).\n\n**Step 3: Predict the Structure of the Alkene Product**\n\nTo find the structure of the product, we essentially \"swap\" the =O of the aldehyde with the =C part of the ylide.\n\n*   From pivalaldehyde: (CH₃)₃C-CH=\n*   From the ylide: =CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\nCombining these two fragments at the double bond gives the alkene product:\n(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry (E/Z Isomerism) of the Product**\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the ylide.\n\n*   **Stabilized ylides** have an electron-withdrawing group (like -C=O, -CN) on the ylide carbon. They are more stable and typically yield the (E)-alkene (trans) as the major product.\n*   **Non-stabilized ylides** have alkyl or hydrogen groups on the ylide carbon. They are more reactive and typically yield the (Z)-alkene (cis) as the major product under standard conditions.\n\nLet's classify our ylide, Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl). The group attached to the ylide carbon (=CH-) is a 2-chlorobenzyl group (-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)). This is an alkyl-type group, not an electron-withdrawing group that can provide resonance stabilization. Therefore, this is a **non-stabilized ylide**.\n\nSince we are reacting a non-stabilized ylide with an aldehyde, the reaction is expected to be selective for the **(Z)-isomer**.\n\n*   To assign the Z configuration, we look at the priority of the groups on each carbon of the double bond (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules).\n    *   On one carbon: A tert-butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃) and a hydrogen atom (H). The tert-butyl group has higher priority.\n    *   On the other carbon: A 2-chlorobenzyl group (-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)) and a hydrogen atom (H). The 2-chlorobenzyl group has higher priority.\n*   In the (Z)-isomer, the two higher-priority groups (tert-butyl and 2-chlorobenzyl) are on the **same side** of the double bond.\n\n**Step 5: Name the Final Product**\n\nNow we determine the systematic IUPAC name for the major product, (Z)-(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\n1.  **Find the parent chain:** The longest carbon chain that includes the double bond is a five-carbon chain (pentene).\n    (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-¹CH₂-²CH=³CH-⁴C(CH₃)₃\n2.  **Number the chain:** We number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number. Numbering from the end with the phenyl ring places the double bond at C-2. Numbering from the tert-butyl end would place it at C-3. So, we number from the phenyl-ring end.\n3.  **Identify and name substituents:**\n    *   At C-1, there is a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n    *   At C-4, there are two methyl groups (4,4-dimethyl).\n4.  **Assemble the name:** The base name is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n5.  **Add the stereochemical prefix:** Since the major product is the (Z)-isomer, the full name is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n\n*   **Reactant Identification:** Correctly interpreted the IUPAC names of both pivalaldehyde and the phosphonium ylide.\n*   **Ylide Classification:** Correctly identified the ylide as non-stabilized, which is the key to predicting stereochemistry.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** Correctly predicted the formation of an alkene by combining the appropriate fragments of the reactants.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Correctly applied the rule that non-stabilized ylides give (Z)-alkenes as the major product.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** Correctly numbered the parent chain, identified all substituents, and included the (Z) stereodescriptor.\n\nThe final product of the reaction is the major stereoisomer formed.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene >>>"
