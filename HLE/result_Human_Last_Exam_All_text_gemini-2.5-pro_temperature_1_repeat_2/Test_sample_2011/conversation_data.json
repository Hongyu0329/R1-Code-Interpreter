    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that a single graph on `n = 128` vertices can contain. These cliques must appear as **induced subgraphs**.\n\n*   **Graph:** A graph `G` with a set of vertices `V` where `|V| = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique of size `s`, denoted `K_s`, is a set of `s` vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `V' ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[V']` contains the vertices `V'` and *all* the edges from `G` that have both endpoints in `V'`.\n*   **The Question:** We want to find a single graph `G` on 128 vertices that maximizes the number of distinct integers `s` for which there exists a subset of vertices `V'` such that `|V'| = s` and the induced subgraph `G[V']` is a clique `K_s`.\n\n**2. Identifying Careful Points and Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Induced vs. Non-Induced:** The term \"induced\" is critical. A `K_s` as an induced subgraph is a stronger condition than just having a `K_s` as a subgraph. For a subgraph to be an induced `K_s`, the `s` vertices must be fully connected to each other in the original graph, and there can be no \"missing\" edges between them.\n*   **Implication of a Large Induced Clique:** If a graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `m` (let's say on vertex set `V_m`), then it automatically contains induced cliques of all smaller sizes from 1 to `m`. This is because any subset of `k` vertices (`1 ≤ k ≤ m`) chosen from `V_m` will also be fully connected amongst themselves, forming an induced `K_k`.\n*   **The Set of Possible Sizes:** The size `s` of a clique must be a positive integer. Furthermore, a clique cannot have more vertices than the graph itself. So, for a graph on `n=128` vertices, any possible clique size `s` must be in the range `1 ≤ s ≤ 128`.\n\n**3. Establishing an Upper Bound**\n\nBased on the points above, the set of all possible integer values for clique sizes in a graph with 128 vertices is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`. There are exactly 128 distinct values in this set. Therefore, no graph on 128 vertices can have more than 128 different clique sizes. The maximum possible number is at most 128.\n\n**4. Constructing a Graph to Achieve the Upper Bound**\n\nNow we must show that this upper bound of 128 is achievable. To do this, we need to find a specific graph on 128 vertices that contains induced cliques of all possible sizes from 1 to 128.\n\n*   **Proposed Graph:** Consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_{128}`. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Proposed Graph:**\n    *   Let's check if `K_{128}` contains induced cliques of all required sizes.\n    *   Choose any integer `s` such that `1 ≤ s ≤ 128`.\n    *   We need to find a set of `s` vertices in `K_{128}` whose induced subgraph is a `K_s`.\n    *   Let's select any arbitrary subset of `s` vertices from the 128 vertices of the graph.\n    *   By the definition of `K_{128}`, every vertex in this subset is connected to every other vertex in the subset.\n    *   Therefore, the subgraph induced by these `s` vertices is a complete graph on `s` vertices, i.e., a `K_s`.\n    *   Since we can do this for any `s` from 1 to 128, the graph `K_{128}` contains induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 128.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe graph `K_{128}` has exactly 128 different induced clique sizes: {1, 2, ..., 128}. We have established that 128 is the theoretical maximum possible number of different sizes. Since we have constructed a graph that achieves this maximum, the answer is 128. Any other graph structure, such as a disjoint union of smaller cliques (e.g., two `K_{64}`s), would result in fewer distinct clique sizes (in that example, the sizes would be {1, 2, ..., 64}, for a total of 64 distinct sizes).\n\nThe final answer is the maximum number of different clique sizes possible.\n\n<<<128>>>"
