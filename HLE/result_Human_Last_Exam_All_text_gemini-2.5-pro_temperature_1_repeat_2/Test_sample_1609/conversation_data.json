    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n=4 variables.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Boolean Function:** A function with n binary inputs and one binary output. For n=4, the inputs are typically represented by variables like w, x, y, z.\n*   **Minterm:** A product term that includes all n variables, each either complemented or uncomplemented. For n=4, there are $2^4 = 16$ minterms (from w'x'y'z' to wxyz).\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant (a product term that implies the function is true) that is minimal. This means if you remove any literal from the term, it is no longer an implicant of the function. On a Karnaugh map (K-map), a prime implicant corresponds to a rectangular grouping of 1s that is as large as possible.\n*   **a(n):** The maximal number of prime implicants that any Boolean function of n variables can have. We need to find the specific function of 4 variables that yields this maximum number and determine what that number is.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Candidate Functions for Maximizing Prime Implicants\n\nThe number of prime implicants depends on the specific arrangement of 1s (minterms) in the function's K-map. Functions with highly non-adjacent 1s or specific regular patterns tend to have many prime implicants. Research and combinatorial analysis have shown that the functions that maximize the number of PIs fall into a few specific categories.\n\n1.  **The \"Checkerboard\" Function:** This function consists of all minterms with the same parity (either all minterms with an even number of uncomplemented variables or all with an odd number).\n2.  **The \"Middle Layer\" Function ($S_k^n$):** This function consists of all minterms with a specific weight `k` (where weight is the number of uncomplemented variables).\n3.  **The \"Two Middle Layers\" Function ($R_k^n$):** This function consists of all minterms with weight `k` or `k+1`.\n\nWe will calculate the number of prime implicants for each of these function types for n=4 and find the maximum.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of PIs for Each Candidate Function with n=4\n\n#### Candidate 1: The Checkerboard Function\nFor n variables, the number of minterms with even parity equals the number of minterms with odd parity, and this number is $2^{n-1}$. In such a function, no two minterms are adjacent, so they cannot be combined. Thus, every minterm is a prime implicant.\n*   Number of PIs = $2^{n-1}$\n*   For n=4, Number of PIs = $2^{4-1} = 2^3 = 8$.\n\n#### Candidate 2: The \"Middle Layer\" Function ($S_k^4$)\nThis function is the sum of all minterms of weight k. The number of such minterms is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k). For these functions, it can also be shown that no two minterms are adjacent, so each minterm is a prime implicant.\n*   Number of PIs = C(n, k) = C(4, k).\n*   We need to find the maximum value of C(4, k) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n    *   k=0: C(4, 0) = 1\n    *   k=1: C(4, 1) = 4\n    *   k=2: C(4, 2) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6\n    *   k=3: C(4, 3) = 4\n    *   k=4: C(4, 4) = 1\n*   The maximum number of PIs for this type of function is 6.\n\n#### Candidate 3: The \"Two Middle Layers\" Function ($R_k^4$)\nThis function is the sum of all minterms of weight k and k+1. A prime implicant is formed by every adjacent pair of minterms, where one has weight k and the other has weight k+1. The number of such PIs can be calculated as $(k+1) \\times C(n, k+1)$ or equivalently $(n-k) \\times C(n, k)$.\n*   Number of PIs = $(k+1) \\times C(4, k+1)$.\n*   We need to find the maximum value for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    *   k=0 (weights 0 and 1): PIs = (0+1) * C(4, 1) = 1 * 4 = 4.\n    *   k=1 (weights 1 and 2): PIs = (1+1) * C(4, 2) = 2 * 6 = 12.\n    *   k=2 (weights 2 and 3): PIs = (2+1) * C(4, 3) = 3 * 4 = 12.\n    *   k=3 (weights 3 and 4): PIs = (3+1) * C(4, 4) = 4 * 1 = 4.\n*   The maximum number of PIs for this type of function is 12.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Results and Determine the Final Answer\n\nNow we compare the maximum number of prime implicants found from each candidate type:\n*   Maximum from Checkerboard function: 8\n*   Maximum from \"Middle Layer\" functions: 6\n*   Maximum from \"Two Middle Layers\" functions: 12\n\nThe overall maximum is 12.\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables, a(4), is 12. This is achieved by a function composed of all minterms of weight 1 and 2, or one composed of all minterms of weight 2 and 3.\n\n<<<12>>>"
