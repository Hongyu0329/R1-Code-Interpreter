    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(3).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the terminology in the question.**\n*   **Feynman diagrams in quantum electrodynamics (QED):** These are graphical representations of the mathematical expressions describing the interactions of electrons, positrons, and photons.\n*   **Electron or photon propagators:** These refer to the 2-point Green's functions, which describe the propagation of an electron or a photon. The diagrams for these are also known as self-energy diagrams (for the electron) and vacuum polarization diagrams (for the photon). They have two external lines.\n*   **Order 2n:** In perturbation theory, the \"order\" refers to the power of the coupling constant. In QED, the fundamental interaction vertex involves one photon and two electron lines, and its strength is proportional to the elementary charge 'e'. A diagram's order is the power of 'e' in its corresponding mathematical expression. Since each vertex contributes one factor of 'e', and corrections to propagators only occur at even powers of 'e', an order of 2n corresponds to a diagram with 2n vertices.\n*   **Non-vanishing Feynman diagrams:** In the context of counting diagrams, this is standardly interpreted as counting the number of topologically distinct, connected, and one-particle-irreducible (1PI) diagrams. A diagram is 1PI if it cannot be cut into two separate pieces by severing a single internal line.\n*   **a(n):** This is the function we need to evaluate. a(n) gives the number of diagrams of order 2n.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the specific problem.**\nThe question asks for the value of a(3). According to the definition given, a(3) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2*3 = 6 for the electron or photon propagator. This means we need to find the number of connected, 1PI QED diagrams with 6 vertices and 2 external lines.\n\n**Step 3: Consult known results from physics literature.**\nThe number of Feynman diagrams for various processes in QED is a well-studied problem in mathematical physics. The results are tabulated in many textbooks and research articles on quantum field theory. For the self-energy/vacuum polarization, the number of diagrams at a given order is the same for both the electron and the photon.\n\nLet's denote the number of diagrams of order 2n (i.e., with 2n vertices) as N(2n). The sequence of these numbers is known:\n*   **Order 2 (2n=2, so n=1):** There is N(2) = 1 diagram. This is the familiar one-loop correction.\n*   **Order 4 (2n=4, so n=2):** There are N(4) = 2 distinct 1PI diagrams.\n*   **Order 6 (2n=6, so n=3):** There are N(6) = 10 distinct 1PI diagrams.\n*   **Order 8 (2n=8, so n=4):** There are N(8) = 74 distinct 1PI diagrams.\n\nThis sequence (1, 2, 10, 74, ...) is a standard result in QED.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the known results to the question.**\nThe function a(n) is defined as the number of diagrams of order 2n. Therefore:\n*   a(1) = N(2*1) = N(2) = 1\n*   a(2) = N(2*2) = N(4) = 2\n*   a(3) = N(2*3) = N(6) = 10\n*   a(4) = N(2*4) = N(8) = 74\n\nThe question specifically asks for a(3).\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer.**\nBased on the analysis, a(3) corresponds to the number of 6th-order diagrams. From the established results, this number is 10.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correctly interpreting \"order 2n\":** It is crucial to associate this with 2n vertices, which is the standard convention.\n2.  **Correctly interpreting \"non-vanishing\":** This implies counting connected, 1PI diagrams, which is the standard for fundamental enumeration. Reducible diagrams are combinations of these irreducible building blocks.\n3.  **Electron \"or\" Photon:** Recognizing that the number of diagrams is the same for both cases simplifies the problem and confirms the question is well-posed.\n4.  **Reliability of the Source:** This is a knowledge-based question. The answer relies on widely accepted and published results from the field of theoretical physics, rather than a derivation from first principles, which would be extremely complex. The sequence 1, 2, 10, 74... is confirmed across multiple sources (e.g., papers by Cvitanovic, Lautrup, Broadhurst, Kreimer; OEIS A000698).\n\nThe value of a(3) is the third term in this sequence (when indexed by n=1, 2, 3...), which corresponds to diagrams with 2*3=6 vertices. The value is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
