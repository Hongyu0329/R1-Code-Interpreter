    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the key figures:** The question mentions Fernand Braudel, a renowned French historian, and Paul Morand, a French author whom Braudel quoted. The core idea belongs to Morand but was adopted and popularized by Braudel.\n2.  **Identify the core metaphor:** The central idea is that a certain \"conceptual entity\" should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n3.  **Interpret the metaphor:**\n    *   A \"sphere\" in this context is a metaphor for the globe or the entire world.\n    *   To be \"inscribed within\" it means to be placed, understood, and analyzed within a global context, not in isolation.\n4.  **Identify the provided example:** The question states that this entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This means a nation's story or development is a prime example of something that must be understood within this global sphere.\n5.  **Connect to Braudel's work:** Fernand Braudel is the main figure in the Annales School of history, famous for his emphasis on long-term historical structures (*longue durée*) and a global, or \"world-systems,\" perspective. He argued against studying history as a series of isolated national events, advocating instead for understanding how civilizations, economies, and nations are interconnected on a worldwide scale. This aligns perfectly with the metaphor.\n6.  **Synthesize the information:** The question asks for the \"conceptual entity\" itself, not the example (the nation). Braudel used Morand's quote to argue that his own subject matter—the study of the past—must be approached from a global viewpoint. Therefore, the entity that needs to be inscribed within the sphere of the world is History itself.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The entity vs. the example:** It is crucial not to mistake the example (\"a nation\") for the entity being described. The nation is a subject of historical study, but the quote refers to the practice of that study itself.\n*   **Source of the quote:** The quote appears in Braudel's writings, notably in the preface to *A History of Civilizations* and in *The Perspective of the World*. In the preface, he states, \"Paul Morand, whom I am fond of quoting, once wrote that 'any great history should be inscribed within a sphere'. By this he meant that it should be conceived and constructed in relation to the global space of the entire world.\"\n*   **Conceptual nature:** The question refers to a \"conceptual entity.\" This points away from a physical object and towards an idea, a discipline, or a field of study, which reinforces the conclusion that the entity is \"History.\"\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  The question describes an idea championed by Fernand Braudel, a historian focused on global interconnectedness.\n2.  The idea is that a conceptual entity must be understood globally (\"inscribed within a sphere\").\n3.  An example of a subject that requires this approach is a nation. The history of a nation, according to Braudel, makes no sense without understanding its place in the world.\n4.  By looking at the direct quote from Braudel's work, we find he explicitly applies Morand's idea to the discipline of history. He says, \"any great history should be inscribed within a sphere.\"\n5.  Therefore, the conceptual entity that Braudel believes should always be framed by a global perspective is **History**.\n\n<<<History>>>"
