    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Goal:** Construct a \"full spectral volume\". This means for every point in a 2D spatial scene (x, y), we want to know its full spectrum of light (λ). This creates a 3D data cube of (x, y, λ).\n    *   **Method:** \"Computed tomography\" (CT).\n    *   **Constraint:** From a \"single image\".\n    *   **Key Component:** \"Diffraction gratings\".\n    *   **Question:** What is the *minimum number* of these gratings required?\n\n2.  **Understand the Technology: Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS)**\n    *   Standard CT (like in medicine) reconstructs a 3D spatial volume (x, y, z) by taking many 2D projection images from different angles around the object.\n    *   The technique described in the question is a specific type of hyperspectral imaging called Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). It aims to capture the 3D spatiospectral data cube (x, y, λ) in a single snapshot onto a 2D detector (a single image).\n    *   In CTIS, the concept of \"projections from different angles\" is adapted. Instead of physically rotating a camera, a special optical element is used to create multiple, differently altered views of the scene and project them all onto the detector at the same time. The \"computed tomography\" part refers to the mathematical algorithm used to unscramble this multiplexed single image back into the full (x, y, λ) data cube.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Role of the Diffraction Grating**\n    *   A diffraction grating is an optical element that splits light into its constituent wavelengths. When an image of a scene passes through a grating, each point of light is dispersed into a line of colors (a spectrum).\n    *   **Case 1: Using One Diffraction Grating.** If we place a single 1D diffraction grating in the optical path, it will disperse light along one axis (e.g., horizontally). The 2D detector will capture a central, undispersed image (the 0th diffraction order) and, to its sides, spectrally dispersed versions of the image (the +1, -1, etc., orders). This provides a set of \"projections,\" but they are all along a single axis. This is analogous to a standard CT scanner only being able to take pictures from the front and back of a patient, but not from the sides. The resulting reconstruction would be highly incomplete and suffer from severe artifacts. This is known as the \"missing cone\" problem in Fourier optics, where a large volume of information required for reconstruction is simply not captured.\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Requirement for Robust Reconstruction**\n    *   To overcome the limitations of a single grating, we need more \"projections\" from different \"angles.\" In the context of CTIS, this means we need to disperse the light in more than one direction.\n    *   **Case 2: Using Two Diffraction Gratings.** The solution is to use a 2D disperser. The most fundamental way to create a 2D disperser is to use **two** 1D diffraction gratings oriented perpendicularly to each other (e.g., one with vertical lines and one with horizontal lines, placed one after the other).\n    *   This \"crossed-grating\" setup disperses the light in two dimensions (horizontally and vertically). On the detector, this creates a 2D grid of images. There is a central, undispersed 0th order image, and surrounding it is a matrix of spectrally dispersed images (e.g., orders (+1,0), (-1,0), (0,+1), (0,-1), (+1,+1), etc.).\n    *   This 2D array of projections provides a much richer dataset, sampling the spatiospectral information from multiple different \"angles.\" This is sufficient information for the computed tomography algorithm to robustly reconstruct the full (x, y, λ) data cube.\n    *   Note: This 2D disperser might be manufactured as a single optical element (often called a 2D grating or a computer-generated hologram), but it fundamentally performs the function of two crossed gratings.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   One grating is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction due to the \"missing cone\" problem.\n    *   Two gratings (or their functional equivalent in a single component) provide the necessary 2D dispersion to create multiple projections for a robust reconstruction.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum number of gratings necessary to provide the required information is two.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<B>>>"
