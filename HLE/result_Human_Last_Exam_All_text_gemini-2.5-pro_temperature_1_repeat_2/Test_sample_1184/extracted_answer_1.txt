**1) Hotspots for Interaction with alpha-1 subunit:**
The key residues are located in the hydrophobic alpha-binding pocket (ABP) within the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain of the human beta-1 subunit (numbering for canonical isoform P54289-1). These residues are essential for the physical binding to the alpha-1 subunit's Alpha Interaction Domain (AID).

*   **L423 (Leucine at position 423)**

**2) Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties:**
The key residue for modulating the voltage-dependence of activation is located in the variable N-terminus of a specific isoform, human beta-1b (P54289-2). This residue fine-tunes the channel's sensitivity to voltage changes without affecting the primary binding interaction.
