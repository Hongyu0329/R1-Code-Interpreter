    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The primary goal is to determine the \"rule activation level\" (also known as the firing strength or firing level) of a fuzzy rule.\n\n2.  **Understand the Components of a Fuzzy Rule:** A fuzzy rule generally has two parts:\n    *   **Antecedent (the \"IF\" part):** This part evaluates the input variables. For a rule `k`, given an input vector `x'`, the antecedent's satisfaction degree is calculated.\n    *   **Consequent (the \"THEN\" part):** This part defines the output fuzzy set that is produced if the rule is activated.\n\n3.  **Define \"Rule Activation Level\":** The rule activation level is the degree to which the antecedent part of the rule is satisfied by the current inputs. This value is a scalar (in type-1 and some simplified type-n systems) or a fuzzy set (in type-2 and type-3 systems) that determines the weight or influence of that specific rule on the final output. It is calculated *before* considering the consequent part.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`**: In the context of fuzzy logic systems, especially type-2 and type-3, the symbol `Φ_k(x')` (or `Phi_k(x')`, `f^k(x')`, `w^k`) is the standard notation for the firing strength or activation level of the *k*-th rule for a given input `x'`. This value is the result of evaluating the antecedent part of the rule. Therefore, the problem directly states that the rule activation level is 0.7.\n    *   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`**: This notation represents the membership grade of a value `y_j` in the fuzzy set `G_k_j`. The set `G_k_j` belongs to the *consequent* (the \"THEN\" part) of the rule. This information is used *after* the activation level has been calculated, typically to determine the shape of the rule's output fuzzy set (a process called implication). It is not needed to find the activation level itself.\n    *   **\"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\"**: This provides the context for the system. In a true Interval Type-3 Fuzzy System (IT3FS), the activation level `Phi_k(x')` would be a Type-2 fuzzy set, not a single number. However, the problem simplifies this by providing a single crisp value (0.7). We must interpret this as the specific, representative value of the activation level required for the calculation. The fundamental definition of the activation level (that it comes from the antecedent) does not change.\n    *   **\"using a t-norm operation\"**: A t-norm (like MIN or PRODUCT) is the operation used to combine the membership values of multiple conditions in the antecedent (e.g., `IF x1 is A1 AND x2 is A2`). The value `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` is the *result* of applying this t-norm to the antecedent's membership functions. Since the result is already provided, we do not need to perform a t-norm calculation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Distinguishing Antecedent from Consequent:** The most critical point is to recognize that the activation level depends only on the \"IF\" part (antecedent) of the rule. The information about the \"THEN\" part (consequent), `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`, is extraneous to this specific question.\n2.  **Understanding the Notation:** The question's answer is embedded in the notation. Recognizing that `Phi_k(x')` *is* the rule activation level is key to solving the problem directly.\n3.  **Context vs. Calculation:** The mention of \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\" and \"t-norm\" provides context about the system's nature but does not require a complex calculation, as the final value of the antecedent evaluation is already given.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThe rule activation level is the firing strength of the rule's antecedent. The problem provides this value directly using the standard notation `Phi_k(x′)`. The other pieces of information are relevant to different stages of the fuzzy inference process but not to the calculation of the activation level itself.\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
