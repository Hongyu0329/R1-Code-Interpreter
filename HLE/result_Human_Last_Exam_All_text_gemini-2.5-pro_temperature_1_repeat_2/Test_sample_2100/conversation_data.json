    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1: A man called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by Andrei Voznesensky.**\n    *   This tells us the person is a male historical figure, likely an explorer or navigator (\"sailor\").\n    *   The description \"joy-discovering\" is poetic and suggests his discoveries brought something positive or were significant.\n    *   The reference to Andrei Voznesensky, a famous Soviet/Russian poet, firmly places the context within Russian culture and history.\n\n*   **Clue 2: Voznesensky wondered, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"**\n    *   This is a critical piece of information. It means the man's burial place was unknown or lost for a very long time.\n    *   The question's poetic nature implies that the man was famous enough for his lost grave to be a subject of lament.\n\n*   **Clue 3: The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.**\n    *   This is the most specific and helpful clue. It pinpoints a historical or archaeological discovery that happened around the late 1980s (or very early 1990s, as this timeframe is often used loosely for the Perestroika era).\n    *   This discovery must have definitively located the previously lost grave of the man in question.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesize the Clues and Identify Candidates**\n\nWe are looking for a famous explorer associated with Russia whose lost grave was discovered in the late 1980s/early 1990s.\n\n*   A prominent candidate is **Vitus Bering**, a Danish explorer who served in the Russian navy.\n*   Let's check him against the clues:\n    *   **\"Sailor\":** Yes, he was a famous captain-commander and explorer who led two Kamchatka expeditions and discovered the strait between Asia and America.\n    *   **\"Lost Grave\":** Bering died of scurvy in 1741 on an uninhabited island after his ship was wrecked. The island was later named Bering Island. He was buried there, but the exact location of his grave was lost to time. This fits \"Where is your grave?\" perfectly.\n    *   **Grave Discovered in the Late 1980s:** A joint Russian-Danish expedition traveled to Bering Island in **1991**. In August of that year, they successfully located and excavated the graves of Bering and five of his crewmen. His identity was confirmed through forensic analysis. This event directly corresponds to the clue, providing a definitive \"answer\" to the long-standing question of his grave's location. The timing, late 1980s/early 1990s, is a perfect match.\n    *   **Voznesensky Connection:** Voznesensky did write about famous historical explorers, and the theme of Bering's fate fits his poetic interests.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminate Other Possibilities**\n\n*   Another figure often associated with Voznesensky is Nikolai Rezanov, the hero of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (libretto by Voznesensky). Rezanov's grave monument in Krasnoyarsk was destroyed, and its exact spot was lost for a time. However, there was no major discovery of his remains in the late 1980s comparable to the finding of Bering's skeleton. The discovery of Bering's actual physical remains is a much more literal and dramatic \"answer\" to the question \"Where is your grave?\"\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of being a famous \"sailor\" for Russia, having a famously lost grave, and that grave being definitively discovered and identified in the late Soviet period (1991) points uniquely to Vitus Bering. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Bering>>>"
