    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the properties of Dirichlet characters.\n\n**Step 1: Factorize the conductor N**\nThe conductor is given as $N = 36036$. We need to find its prime factorization.\n$N = 36 \\times 1001$\n$N = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\nSo, the prime factorization of N is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet Character**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is called *primitive* if it is not induced by a character with a smaller conductor. A character $\\chi$ modulo $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product of primitive characters modulo each prime power factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$\nwhere:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2 = 4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2 = 9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Order of the Character**\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_2), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_3), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_5))$\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6. This imposes two conditions:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders must contain a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3 to ensure their lcm is 6.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of valid primitive components for each factor**\nWe need to count how many choices we have for each $\\chi_i$ such that it is primitive and its order divides 6. The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ (where $d|n$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(d)$.\n\n*   **For conductor 4 ($=2^2$):**\n    The group of characters mod 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. It has $\\phi(4)=2$ characters. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(4) - \\phi(2) = 2 - 1 = 1$. This unique primitive character has order 2. Since $2|6$, this is a valid choice.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_1$: **1**. Let's note that its order is always 2.\n\n*   **For conductor 9 ($=3^2$):**\n    The group of characters mod 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$. The orders of these primitive characters are 3 and 6.\n    - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both orders (3 and 6) divide 6. So, any of the 4 primitive characters are valid choices.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_2$: $2+2 = \\textbf{4}$. Note that the order is always a multiple of 3.\n\n*   **For conductor 7:**\n    The group of characters mod 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character is primitive if it is not the principal character (whose conductor is 1). The orders of primitive characters are the divisors of 6 other than 1, which are 2, 3, and 6. All these orders divide 6.\n    - Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Total valid choices: $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n*   **For conductor 11:**\n    The group of characters mod 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. A primitive character's order must divide 10. Our condition requires the order to also divide 6. Thus, the order must divide $\\gcd(10, 6) = 2$. As the character must be primitive, its order cannot be 1. So, the only possible order is 2.\n    Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: **1**.\n\n*   **For conductor 13:**\n    The group of characters mod 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. A primitive character's order must divide 12. We also need the order to divide 6. So, the order must divide $\\gcd(12, 6) = 6$. The possible orders (other than 1) are 2, 3, and 6.\n    - Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Total valid choices: $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of characters**\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ whose order divides 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal choices = (choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_5$)\nTotal choices = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow, we must confirm that the order is *exactly* 6 for all these 100 combinations.\nLet the orders of the chosen components be $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5)$.\n- The choice for $\\chi_1$ forces $o_1 = 2$.\n- The choices for $\\chi_2$ force $o_2$ to be 3 or 6, so $o_2$ is always a multiple of 3.\n\nThe overall order is $L = \\operatorname{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5)$.\nSince $o_1=2$, $L$ must be a multiple of 2.\nSince $o_2$ is a multiple of 3, $L$ must be a multiple of 3.\nBecause $L$ is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of $\\operatorname{lcm}(2,3) = 6$.\nAlso, since every component's order $o_i$ divides 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\nThe only integer that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 is 6 itself. Thus, the order of every single one of the 100 characters is exactly 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$ is 100."
