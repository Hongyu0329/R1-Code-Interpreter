    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Terms**\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 possible two-dimensional plane crystallographic groups that describe all the ways a pattern can be repeated in a plane using symmetries.\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, its point group is the set of symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point in the plane fixed. The translational components of the wallpaper group's symmetries (like pure translations and the translational part of glide reflections) are ignored when determining the point group.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The number of distinct elements (or symmetry operations) in the group.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find how many of the 17 wallpaper groups have a point group with exactly two symmetry operations.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Point Groups of Order 2**\n\nAccording to the crystallographic restriction theorem, in two dimensions, the only possible rotational symmetries in a repeating pattern are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6-fold. The possible point groups are either cyclic ($C_n$) or dihedral ($D_n$).\n\nWe are looking for point groups with an order of 2. This means the group contains two elements: the identity operation (which is always present) and one other symmetry operation.\n\n1.  **Rotational Symmetry:** A 2-fold rotation (180° rotation) is a possible crystallographic symmetry. The group consisting of the identity and a 180° rotation is the cyclic group $C_2$. In international (Hermann-Mauguin) notation, this point group is simply denoted as **2**.\n2.  **Reflectional Symmetry:** A single reflection is also a possible crystallographic symmetry. The group consisting of the identity and a reflection is the dihedral group $D_1$. In international notation, this point group is denoted as **m**.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for wallpaper groups whose point group is either **2** ($C_2$) or **m** ($D_1$).\n\n**Step 3: Examine the 17 Wallpaper Groups**\n\nWe will now list the 17 wallpaper groups and identify their corresponding point groups. A key point to remember is that a glide reflection (denoted 'g') in a wallpaper group corresponds to a simple reflection ('m') in its point group.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified into five lattice systems.\n\n1.  **Oblique System (Point groups 1, 2)**\n    *   **p1:** Has only translations. Point group is **1** ($C_1$), order 1.\n    *   **p2:** Has translations and 2-fold rotation centers. The point group is **2** ($C_2$), order 2.  **(This is our first group)**\n\n2.  **Rectangular System (Point groups m, 2mm)**\n    *   **pm:** Has reflection lines. The point group is **m** ($D_1$), order 2. **(This is our second group)**\n    *   **pg:** Has glide reflection lines. The point group operation for a glide reflection is a reflection. The point group is **m** ($D_1$), order 2. **(This is our third group)**\n    *   **cm:** Has a centered lattice with reflection and glide reflection lines. The point group is **m** ($D_1$), order 2. **(This is our fourth group)**\n    *   **p2mm, p2mg, p2gg, c2mm:** All these have a point group of **2mm** ($D_2$), which has order 4.\n\n3.  **Square System (Point groups 4, 4mm)**\n    *   **p4, p4mm, p4gm:** These have point groups **4** ($C_4$, order 4) or **4mm** ($D_4$, order 8).\n\n4.  **Hexagonal System (Point groups 3, 3m, 6, 6mm)**\n    *   **p3, p3m1, p31m, p6, p6mm:** These have point groups **3** ($C_3$, order 3), **3m** ($D_3$, order 6), **6** ($C_6$, order 6), or **6mm** ($D_6$, order 12).\n\n**Step 4: Count the Results**\n\nFrom the analysis in Step 3, we have identified the following wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2:\n\n1.  **p2** (Point group **2**)\n2.  **pm** (Point group **m**)\n3.  **pg** (Point group **m**)\n4.  **cm** (Point group **m**)\n\nThere are a total of 4 such groups.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   Distinguish between a wallpaper group and its point group. The wallpaper group includes translations, while the point group does not.\n*   Recognize that a glide reflection ('g') in the wallpaper group notation contributes a reflection ('m') to the point group.\n*   Know the international symbols for the two point groups of order 2: '2' for 2-fold rotation and 'm' for reflection.\n*   Systematically check all 17 wallpaper groups to ensure none are missed or misidentified.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there are 4 wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
