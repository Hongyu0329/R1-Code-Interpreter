    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the observer gain matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal: Deadbeat Observer**\n\nThe objective is to design an observer for the given discrete-time system such that the observation error converges to zero in the shortest possible time. This is known as a deadbeat observer.\n\nThe system is:\n`x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nThe observer is given by:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - y_hat(k))`\nwhere `x_hat` is the state estimate and `y_hat(k) = Cx_hat(k)`.\n\nThe observation error is `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)`. The error dynamics are described by:\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nFor the error to become zero in a finite number of steps, `p`, for any initial error `e(0)`, the matrix `(A - LC)` must be nilpotent, meaning `(A - LC)^p = 0` for some integer `p`. This implies that all eigenvalues of the matrix `(A - LC)` must be zero. The shortest possible time corresponds to placing all `n` eigenvalues at the origin, where `n` is the dimension of the state vector.\n\n**2. Check System Observability**\n\nA deadbeat observer can be designed if and only if the system is completely observable. The system's state dimension is `n=4`. We check observability by computing the rank of the observability matrix `O = [C^T; (CA)^T; (CA^2)^T; (CA^3)^T]^T`. The system is observable if `rank(O) = n = 4`.\n\nThe given matrices are:\n`A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`\n`C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\nFirst, we compute the products `CA` and `CA^2`:\n`CA = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\n`A^2 = A * A = [0 0 1 -2; -3 0 2 -1; 2 -1 0 3; 2 1 0 -1]`\n`CA^2 = C * A^2 = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * [0 0 1 -2; -3 0 2 -1; 2 -1 0 3; 2 1 0 -1] = [0 0 1 -2; 2 1 1 -3]`\n\nNow, we form the observability matrix by stacking rows from `C`, `CA`, and `CA^2` and check for `n=4` linearly independent rows.\nRows from `C`: `c1=[1 0 0 0]`, `c2=[1 0 0 1]`\nRows from `CA`: `c3=[-1 0 0 1]`, `c4=[-2 0 1 0]`\nRows from `CA^2`: `c5=[0 0 1 -2]`, `c6=[2 1 1 -3]`\n\nLet's form a 4x4 matrix using four of these row vectors, for example `c1`, `c2`, `c4`, and `c6`:\n`M = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0; 2 1 1 -3]`\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n`det(M) = 1 * det([0 0 1; 0 1 0; 1 1 -3]) = 1 * (1 * det([0 1; 1 1])) = 1 * (-1) = -1`\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the rank of `M` is 4. Therefore, the system is observable.\n\n**3. Pole Placement using Duality**\n\nThe problem of finding the observer gain `L` to place the eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` is the dual of finding a state-feedback gain `K` to place the eigenvalues of `(A^T - C^T K)`. The desired observer gain is then `L = K^T`. We want to place all eigenvalues at 0.\n\nLet `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`. The dual control problem is to find `K` for the system `x_d(k+1) = A_d x_d(k) + B_d u_d(k)`.\n`A_d = A^T = [-1 1 0 -1; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1]`\n`B_d = C^T = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1]`\n\n**4. Convert to a Single-Input Problem**\n\nThe dual system is multi-input (`B_d` has two columns). We can use Ackermann's formula if we convert it to a single-input system by selecting an input vector `g`. Let the new input be `u_d = g*v`, so the new input matrix is `b_prime = B_d * g`. We must choose `g` such that the pair `(A_d, b_prime)` is controllable.\n\nLet's choose `g = [1; 0]`.\n`b_prime = B_d * g = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1] * [1; 0] = [1; 0; 0; 0]`\n\nNow check the controllability of `(A_d, b_prime)` by computing the controllability matrix `Co = [b_prime, A_d*b_prime, A_d^2*b_prime, A_d^3*b_prime]`. We found the system to be observable, so its dual is controllable. The calculation yields a matrix with `rank(Co)=4`.\n\n**5. Apply Ackermann's Formula**\n\nFor the single-input system `(A_d, b_prime)`, we find the feedback gain vector `k_prime` that places the eigenvalues at `0, 0, 0, 0`. The desired characteristic polynomial is `alpha_d(z) = z^4`.\n\nAckermann's formula for pole placement is:\n`k_prime = [0 0 0 1] * Co^-1 * alpha_d(A_d)`\n\nwhere `alpha_d(A_d) = A_d^4`.\nThe term `[0 0 0 1] * Co^-1` extracts the last row of the inverse of the controllability matrix. Let this row be `w`. Then `k_prime = w * A_d^4`.\n\nThrough detailed calculation (as performed in the thought process), the last row of `Co^-1` is found to be `w = [0 1 0 0]`.\nSo, `k_prime = [0 1 0 0] * A_d^4`. This means `k_prime` is simply the second row of the matrix `A_d^4`.\n\nLet's compute `A_d^4`:\n`A_d^2 = [0 -3 2 2; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1; 0 -1 3 -2]`\n`A_d^3 = [2 4 -5 0; 1 2 -1 -1; 0 -1 3 -2; -2 -4 1 5]`\n`A_d^4 = A_d^3 * A_d`. We only need the second row.\nRow 2 of `A_d^4` = (Row 2 of `A_d^3`) * `A_d`\nRow 2 of `A_d^4` = `[1 2 -1 -1] * [-1 1 0 -1; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1] = [-2, -1, 3, -1]`\n\nSo, the single-input feedback gain is `k_prime = [-2 -1 3 -1]`.\n\n**6. Determine the Observer Gain Matrix L**\n\nNow we convert `k_prime` back to the multi-input gain `K` and then to the observer gain `L`.\nThe relationship is `K = g * k_prime`.\n`K = [1; 0] * [-2 -1 3 -1] = [-2 -1 3 -1; 0 0 0 0]`\n\nThe observer gain is the transpose of `K`:\n`L = K^T = [-2 0; -1 0; 3 0; -1 0]`\n\n**7. Final Verification**\n\nTo verify, one can compute the eigenvalues of `(A - LC)`.\n`LC = [-2 0; -1 0; 3 0; -1 0] * [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] = [-2 0 0 0; -1 0 0 0; 3 0 0 0; -1 0 0 0]`\n`A - LC = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] - [-2 0 0 0; -1 0 0 0; 3 0 0 0; -1 0 0 0]`\n`A - LC = [1 0 0 1; 2 0 0 2; -3 1 0 -1; 0 0 1 -1]`\nThe characteristic polynomial of this matrix is `det(zI - (A-LC)) = z^4`. This confirms that all eigenvalues are at zero, as required for a deadbeat observer.\n\nThe resulting observer gain matrix is:\n`L = [[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]`\n\n<<<[[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]>>>"
