    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The problem describes a quantum mechanical particle confined to a one-dimensional (1D) box.\n2.  **Define the Box:** The box has a length `a` and extends from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n3.  **Specify the State:** The particle is in the second energy level, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n4.  **Identify the Goal:** We need to calculate the probability of finding this particle within a specific, small interval.\n5.  **Define the Interval:** The interval is from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Wavefunction:** The correct normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box must be used. For a given quantum number `n`, the wavefunction is `ψₙ(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`.\n2.  **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is not given by the wavefunction `ψ(x)` itself, but by its squared magnitude, `|ψ(x)|²`. This is known as the probability density.\n3.  **Probability in an Interval:** The probability of finding the particle in a finite interval `[x₁, x₂]` is found by integrating the probability density over that interval: `P = ∫|ψ(x)|² dx` from `x₁` to `x₂`.\n4.  **Small Interval Approximation:** The given interval `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a` is very small compared to the box length `a`. This suggests that an approximation might be possible.\n5.  **Location of the Interval:** The interval is centered at `x = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a`. For the `n=2` state, the center of the box (`x = a/2`) is a node, meaning the wavefunction and the probability density are exactly zero at this point.\n6.  **Insufficiency of Simple Approximation:** A simple approximation `P ≈ |ψ(x_center)|² * Δx` would yield a probability of 0, because `|ψ₂(0.5a)|² = 0`. This is incorrect because the probability density is non-zero at other points within the interval. Therefore, a more careful method, such as integration or a Taylor series approximation of the function, is required.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step\n\n**Step 1: Write down the probability density for n=2.**\nThe wavefunction for `n=2` is `ψ₂(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)`.\nThe probability density `P(x)` is:\n`P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)`\n\n**Step 2: Set up the probability integral.**\nThe probability `Prob` of finding the particle between `x₁ = 0.495a` and `x₂ = 0.505a` is:\n`Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n\n**Step 3: Apply an approximation for the small interval.**\nSince the interval is small and centered at `x = 0.5a`, we can analyze the behavior of the `sin²` term near this point. Let's define a new variable `u = x - 0.5a`. Then `x = u + 0.5a`. The integration limits for `u` become `0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a` and `0.505a - 0.5a = +0.005a`.\n\nSubstitute `x = u + 0.5a` into the `sin²` term:\n`sin(2πx/a) = sin(2π(u + 0.5a)/a) = sin(2πu/a + π)`\nUsing the identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, we get:\n`sin(2πu/a + π) = -sin(2πu/a)`\n\nNow, the probability density in terms of `u` is:\n`P(u) = (2/a) * [-sin(2πu/a)]² = (2/a) * sin²(2πu/a)`\n\nIn our interval, `u` is small. The argument of the sine function, `θ = 2πu/a`, is also small. We can use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n`sin(2πu/a) ≈ 2πu/a`\n\nSo, the approximate probability density is:\n`P(u) ≈ (2/a) * (2πu/a)² = (2/a) * (4π²u²/a²) = (8π²/a³) * u²`\n\n**Step 4: Integrate the approximated function.**\nNow we can integrate this simpler polynomial function over the interval for `u`:\n`Prob ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (8π²/a³) * u² du`\n`Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) * [u³/3]` (evaluated from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`)\n`Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) * [ (0.005a)³/3 - (-0.005a)³/3 ]`\n`Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) * [ 2 * (0.005a)³/3 ]`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final numerical value.**\n`Prob ≈ (16π² / (3a³)) * (0.005)³ * a³`\nThe `a³` terms cancel out:\n`Prob ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³`\nUsing `π ≈ 3.14159`, so `π² ≈ 9.8696`:\n`Prob ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (0.000000125)`\n`Prob ≈ (52.638) * (1.25 * 10⁻⁷)`\n`Prob ≈ 65.7975 * 10⁻⁷`\n`Prob ≈ 6.58 * 10⁻⁶`\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
