    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the pattern in the sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the sequence and calculate the differences between consecutive terms.**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nLet's find the difference between each term and the one before it (this is called the first-order difference).\n*   Difference 1: 11 - 2 = 9\n*   Difference 2: 23 - 11 = 12\n*   Difference 3: 51 - 23 = 28\n*   Difference 4: 119 - 51 = 68\nThe sequence of differences is: 9, 12, 28, 68.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of differences to find its pattern.**\nThe new sequence of differences (9, 12, 28, 68) does not seem to be a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence. Let's look for a more complex relationship between its terms.\n*   Let's see how we can get from 12 to 28: 28 = 12 * 2 + 4\n*   Let's see how we can get from 28 to 68: 68 = 28 * 2 + 12\n\n**Step 3: Identify the underlying pattern.**\nWe see a recursive pattern in the difference sequence: `Next Difference = (Previous Difference) * 2 + (a new number)`.\nThe \"new numbers\" we added were 4 and 12.\nThe sequence of these added numbers is 4, 12, ... This is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 to get the next (4 * 3 = 12).\n\n**Step 4: Use the pattern to predict the next terms.**\n1.  First, predict the next number in the added sequence (4, 12, ...). The next term will be 12 * 3 = 36.\n2.  Now, use this to find the next term in the difference sequence (9, 12, 28, 68, ...).\n    *   Next Difference = (Last Difference) * 2 + (Next added number)\n    *   Next Difference = 68 * 2 + 36 = 136 + 36 = 172.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final missing number in the original sequence.**\nThe next number in the original sequence is the last number (119) plus the next difference we just calculated (172).\n*   Missing Number = 119 + 172 = 291.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Initial Check:** Always check for simple arithmetic or geometric progressions first. They were not present here.\n*   **Multi-level Patterns:** The pattern was not in the original sequence but in the sequence of its differences. This is a common technique for number series problems.\n*   **Recursive Definitions:** The pattern found was recursive, meaning each term depends on the previous ones.\n*   **Verification:** The discovered pattern `D(n+1) = 2 * D(n) + C(n)` where `C(n)` is `4, 12, 36...` consistently explains the given differences.\n*   **Alternative Method (Verification):** Another valid pattern is `a(n+1) = 3 * a(n) - d(n)`, where `d(n)` is the sequence `(10, 18, 34, ...)`. The differences in this `d(n)` sequence are `8, 16, ...`, which doubles each time. This method also leads to the answer 291, increasing confidence in the result.\n\nThe missing number in the sequence is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
