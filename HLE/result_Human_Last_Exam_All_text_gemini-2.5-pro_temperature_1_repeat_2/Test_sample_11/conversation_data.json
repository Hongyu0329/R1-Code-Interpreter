    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Terms**\n*   **\"First statute\":** We are looking for the earliest law chronologically.\n*   **\"Modern State of Israel\":** This refers to laws passed by the Knesset after Israel's independence in 1948. This distinguishes it from law inherited from the British Mandate or the Ottoman Empire.\n*   **\"Explicitly introduce\":** The statute must use the specific Hebrew term for \"good faith,\" which is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*), or its direct grammatical variations like \"בתום לב\" (*be-tom lev* - \"in good faith\"). A law that merely implies a principle of fairness without using the specific term does not qualify.\n*   **\"Concept of 'good faith'\":** This is a legal principle that imposes a duty of honesty, fairness, and reasonableness in dealings.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidate Statutes**\nThe introduction of \"good faith\" was a major feature of Israel's civil law codification project, which took place primarily from the 1960s to the 1980s. The most likely candidates are the foundational laws of private law enacted during this period.\n\n*   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973:** This is the most famous statute concerning good faith. Its Section 12 establishes a duty to act in good faith during negotiations, and Section 39 establishes a duty to perform contractual obligations in good faith. These sections made \"good faith\" a cornerstone of Israeli contract law.\n*   **Land Law, 1969:** This law predates the Contracts Law. We need to check if it contains the term \"good faith\". Section 9 of the Land Law deals with conflicting transactions over the same piece of land. It gives priority to the first transaction unless the second party completed their transaction *be-tom lev* (in good faith), for consideration, and had it registered. This is an explicit use of the term.\n*   **Movable Property Law, 1971:** This law also predates the Contracts Law. Section 5 establishes the \"market overt\" rule (*takanat ha-shuk*), which states that a person who acquires property from a seller who deals in such property in the ordinary course of business acquires clean title, provided the acquisition was made *be-tom lev* (in good faith). This is another explicit use of the term.\n*   **Agency Law, 1965:** This is one of the earliest statutes in the new civil code. Section 8 outlines the agent's duty to the principal. However, the term used is \"נאמנות\" (*ne'emanut*), which translates to \"loyalty\" or \"fidelity.\" While this is a related concept, it is not the explicit term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Dates and Content**\nWe are looking for the *first* statute with an *explicit* mention.\n\n1.  **Agency Law (1965):** Uses \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*), not \"good faith\" (*tom lev*). So, it is not the answer.\n2.  **Land Law (1969):** Explicitly uses the term \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*) in Section 9.\n3.  **Movable Property Law (1971):** Explicitly uses the term \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*) in Section 5, but it was enacted after the Land Law.\n4.  **Contracts (General Part) Law (1973):** Famously uses \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) as a broad, general principle, but it was enacted after both the Land Law and the Movable Property Law.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the chronological order, the Land Law of 1969 is the first original statute of the modern State of Israel's new civil code to explicitly use the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) as an operative legal standard. While the Contracts Law of 1973 is better known for elevating it to a general, overarching principle, the Land Law introduced the term into the statutory books four years earlier.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between a statute that *implies* fairness and one that *explicitly uses the term* \"good faith.\"\n*   It is important to differentiate between original Israeli legislation and laws that were inherited from the British Mandate (even if they were later re-enacted in a \"New Version\"). The question refers to statutes of the \"modern State of Israel,\" implying original legislative acts.\n*   The chronology is key. The Land Law (1969) predates the other significant statutes that use the term, like the Movable Property Law (1971) and the Contracts (General Part) Law (1973).\n\n<<<Land Law>>>"
