    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Understand the core question:** The question asks to identify a ballet step from the given choices where the final position of the legs is exactly the same as the starting position. This specifically refers to which foot is in front in a closed position like fifth position. If you start with the right foot in front, you must end with the right foot in front.\n\n2.  **Analyze each option:**\n\n    *   **A. Entrechat six:**\n        *   **Start:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n        *   **Action:** An *entrechat* is a jump where the legs beat in the air. The number 'six' indicates six movements (three full beats or changes). An even-numbered entrechat lands on two feet. Since there are an odd number of beats (three), the feet will have switched from their original orientation.\n        *   **End:** Lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n    *   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n        *   **Start:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n        *   **Action:** *Échappé* is a jump from a closed position to an open one (fifth to second). *Battu* means the legs beat as they return to the closed position. The word *changé* explicitly means \"changed\".\n        *   **End:** The step ends in fifth position with the feet having changed places (e.g., left foot front).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The name itself tells us the position changes. The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n    *   **C. Assemblé:**\n        *   **Start:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n        *   **Action:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble\". The working leg brushes out, the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and both legs \"assemble\" in the air to land together in fifth position. There are many types of *assemblé*.\n            *   Some types, like *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under), do change which foot is in front.\n            *   However, other standard variations do not. For example, in an *assemblé en avant*, the front foot can brush forward and land back in front. Similarly, in an *assemblé derrière*, the back foot can brush backward and land back in its original position.\n        *   **End:** Depending on the type of *assemblé* performed, the ending position can be the same as the starting position.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is the only step on the list that has common variations which do not change the feet.\n\n    *   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n        *   **Start:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n        *   **Action:** *Glissade* is a gliding step. For *glissade derrière*, starting with the right foot front, the back (left) foot glides out. The right foot then closes *derrière* (behind) the left foot.\n        *   **End:** The final position is fifth with the left foot in front.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n    *   **E. Gargouillade:**\n        *   **Start:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n        *   **Action:** This is a complex, decorative step similar to a *pas de chat*, but with a *rond de jambe* (circular movement) of each leg. A *pas de chat* inherently changes the feet. The dancer jumps from one foot, bringing the other leg up and over, landing with the feet switched.\n        *   **End:** The step ends in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nComparing all the options, *Entrechat six*, *Échappé battu changé*, *Glissade derrière*, and *Gargouillade* are all steps that, in their standard execution, result in a different ending leg position from the start. *Assemblé* is the only step in the list that includes standard variations where the starting and ending leg positions can be identical.\n\n<<<C>>>"
