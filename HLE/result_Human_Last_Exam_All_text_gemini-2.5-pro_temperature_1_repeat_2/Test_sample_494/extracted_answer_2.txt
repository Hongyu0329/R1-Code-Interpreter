Yes, the exotic ammonia molecule would still exhibit tunneling. The tunneling phenomenon is a consequence of the molecule's double-well potential energy surface, which is determined by the masses of the nuclei and the electromagnetic forces between the electrons and nuclei. These properties are unchanged in the exotic molecule. The nuclear spin only affects the symmetry requirements of the total wavefunction, which determines which rotational states are allowed, but it does not eliminate the underlying tunneling mechanism itself.
