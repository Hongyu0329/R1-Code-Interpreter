    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify the person whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his specific 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The key elements are \"Albert Einstein,\" \"1905 paper on Brownian motion,\" \"cited,\" and \"lectures.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific scientific paper.**\nThe paper in question is one of Einstein's four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the citation practices in Einstein's 1905 papers.**\nA well-documented and crucial point about Einstein's groundbreaking papers from 1905 is their remarkable lack of citations. He famously developed his theories from fundamental principles, often without referencing the contemporary body of work on the subjects. He built his arguments logically from the ground up.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the text of the Brownian motion paper for citations.**\nA careful review of the 1905 paper on Brownian motion reveals that it contains no bibliography and no footnotes citing the work of other scientists. More specifically, it does not contain any reference to lectures he may have attended at the ETH Zurich or the University of Zurich. The paper is entirely self-contained in its argumentation.\n\n**Step 5: Address the specific mention of \"lectures\".**\nThe question's focus on \"lectures\" is very specific. However, there is no historical or textual evidence that Einstein cited any lecture course or professor in this paper. While he was certainly influenced by the ideas of physicists like Ludwig Boltzmann on the kinetic theory of heat, this influence is not acknowledged via a formal citation of lectures (or even publications) within the 1905 Brownian motion paper itself.\n\n**Step 6: Formulate the conclusion based on the evidence.**\nThe premise of the question is incorrect. Albert Einstein did not cite anyone's lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The paper is characterized by its profound originality and absence of references to other sources.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the question contains a false premise. Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion is renowned for its lack of citations to other works, and it does not reference any lectures. Therefore, the answer is that he did not cite anyone's lectures.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein did not cite anyone's lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The paper is famous for being almost entirely self-contained and lacking citations to previous work.>>>"
