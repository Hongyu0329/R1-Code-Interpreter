    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the components of the question**\n\n*   **\"squarefree natural numbers (N)\"**: This specifies the context. A squarefree integer $N$ is one which is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1. These numbers are used to construct quadratic number fields, denoted as $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$. The degree of such a field is $n=2$.\n\n*   **\"covolume (V)\"**: This is a standard term in the geometry of numbers. For a number field $K$, its ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ can be embedded into a real vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (where $n$ is the degree of the field). In this space, the image of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ forms a lattice. The covolume $V$ is the volume of the fundamental domain of this lattice. It is given by the formula $V = 2^{-r_2} \\sqrt{|D_K|}$, where $D_K$ is the discriminant of the field and $r_2$ is the number of pairs of complex conjugate embeddings. For quadratic fields ($n=2$):\n    *   If $N>0$ (real quadratic field), $r_1=2, r_2=0$, so $V = \\sqrt{D_K}$.\n    *   If $N<0$ (imaginary quadratic field), $r_1=0, r_2=1$, so $V = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{|D_K|}$.\n\n*   **\"maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)\"**: This notation is not standard, so it requires careful interpretation.\n    *   The subscript 'k' likely refers to the number field $K$.\n    *   The subscript '$\\infty$' refers to the Archimedean places (or infinite primes), which correspond to the embeddings of $K$ into the real or complex numbers.\n    *   \"Maximum norm\" likely refers to the $L_\\infty$-norm (or sup-norm) of the embedding of an element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. For an element $\\alpha$, its canonical embedding is the vector $(\\sigma_1(\\alpha), \\sigma_2(\\alpha), \\dots, \\sigma_n(\\alpha))$. The maximum norm would be $\\max_i |\\sigma_i(\\alpha)|$.\n    *   The question asks for an \"upper bound\" for this quantity. This doesn't make sense for an arbitrary integer $\\alpha$, as its norm can be arbitrarily large. The question must refer to a canonical value. The most natural interpretation is that it asks for an upper bound on the *smallest possible* maximum norm for a non-zero integer. This quantity is precisely the **first successive minimum** of the lattice $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with respect to the $L_\\infty$-norm, denoted $\\lambda_1$. So, we interpret $k_{k,\\infty}$ as $\\lambda_1 = \\min \\{ \\max_i |\\sigma_i(\\alpha)| \\mid \\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K, \\alpha \\neq 0 \\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the relevant mathematical theorem**\n\nThe question asks for a relationship between the size of the smallest non-zero element in a lattice (measured by $\\lambda_1$) and the volume of the lattice's fundamental cell ($V$). This is the central topic of **Minkowski's Theorem on Geometry of Numbers**. We can use Minkowski's first theorem on convex bodies.\n\n**Step 3: Applying Minkowski's Theorem**\n\n*   **Minkowski's First Theorem:** For a lattice $\\Lambda$ of rank $n$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with covolume $V$, and a centrally symmetric, convex set $C \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, if $\\text{vol}(C) \\ge 2^n V$, then $C$ contains at least one non-zero point from the lattice $\\Lambda$.\n\n*   **Applying to our problem:**\n    *   Our lattice is $\\Lambda = \\sigma(\\mathcal{O}_K)$, the embedding of the ring of integers of $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$. The dimension is $n=2$. The covolume is $V$.\n    *   We are interested in the maximum norm, $\\max_i |\\sigma_i(\\alpha)|$. The geometric shape where this quantity is bounded by a constant $r$ is a hypercube. Let's define the convex body $C_r = \\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid \\max_i |x_i| \\le r \\}$. This is the $n$-dimensional cube $[-r, r]^n$.\n    *   The volume of this cube is $\\text{vol}(C_r) = (2r)^n$.\n\n**Step 4: Deriving the upper bound**\n\n*   According to Minkowski's theorem, we can guarantee the existence of a non-zero lattice point in $C_r$ if we choose $r$ such that $\\text{vol}(C_r) \\ge 2^n V$.\n*   Let's find the smallest such $r$. We set the volume equal to the bound:\n    $(2r)^n = 2^n V$\n*   Solving for $r$:\n    $2^n r^n = 2^n V$\n    $r^n = V$\n    $r = V^{1/n}$\n*   This means there must exist a non-zero integer $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that its embedding $\\sigma(\\alpha)$ lies within the cube $C_{V^{1/n}}$. For this $\\alpha$, we have $\\max_i |\\sigma_i(\\alpha)| \\le V^{1/n}$.\n*   Since the quantity we are looking for, $k_{k,\\infty} \\equiv \\lambda_1$, is the minimum possible value of this maximum norm, it must be less than or equal to this bound.\n    $k_{k,\\infty} \\le V^{1/n}$\n\n**Step 5: Specializing to the case of squarefree N**\n\n*   The problem is set in the context of fields $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$, which are quadratic fields.\n*   For a quadratic field, the degree is $n=2$.\n*   Substituting $n=2$ into our general inequality gives:\n    $k_{k,\\infty} \\le V^{1/2}$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe upper bound for the maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$), interpreted as the first successive minimum of the lattice $\\mathcal{O}_K$ for the sup-norm, in relation to the covolume ($V$) is $V^{1/2}$."
