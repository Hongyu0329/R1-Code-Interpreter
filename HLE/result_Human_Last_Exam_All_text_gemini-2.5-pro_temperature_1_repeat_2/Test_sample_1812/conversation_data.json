    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for the determinant of the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". It also explicitly provides a matrix:\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}.\n    \\]\n    We need to determine what matrix to use and calculate its determinant.\n\n2.  **Identify the Matrix for Calculation:**\n    *   The term \"adjacency matrix\" in the context of quiver theory can sometimes be ambiguous. The literal adjacency matrix of the standard Markov quiver (a 3-cycle) is a permutation matrix with determinant 1.\n    *   However, the problem explicitly provides matrix A. This matrix is a well-known matrix in this context: it is the **Cartan matrix** of the affine Lie algebra of type \\( \\tilde{A}_2 \\), which corresponds to the Markov quiver.\n    *   Given that matrix A is explicitly stated, it is the intended subject of the calculation. The descriptive part of the question (\"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver...\") serves to provide the mathematical context from which matrix A arises.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Parameter \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\):**\n    *   The Markov numbers are integer solutions to the Markov equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\). The number 13 is a Markov number, part of the triple (1, 5, 13).\n    *   The structure of the Markov quiver and its associated Cartan matrix (the given matrix A) is fundamental and does not depend on the specific values of the Markov triple.\n    *   Therefore, the information \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) is contextual and does not affect the entries of matrix A or the final calculation. It's extraneous information for the computation itself.\n\n4.  **Compute the Determinant of Matrix A:**\n    The task simplifies to finding the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix A.\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}.\n    \\]\n    We can use several methods:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Cofactor Expansion**\n        We expand along the first row:\n        \\[\n        \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n        \\]\n        \\[\n        \\det(A) = 2(2 \\cdot 2 - (-1) \\cdot (-1)) + 1((-1) \\cdot 2 - (-1) \\cdot (-1)) - 1((-1) \\cdot (-1) - 2 \\cdot (-1))\n        \\]\n        \\[\n        \\det(A) = 2(4 - 1) + 1(-2 - 1) - 1(1 + 2)\n        \\]\n        \\[\n        \\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3)\n        \\]\n        \\[\n        \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0\n        \\]\n\n    *   **Method 2: Row Operations / Linear Dependence**\n        A more direct method is to check for linear dependence among the rows or columns. Let R1, R2, and R3 be the rows of the matrix. Let's sum the three rows:\n        \\[\n        R1 + R2 + R3 = [2 + (-1) + (-1), \\quad -1 + 2 + (-1), \\quad -1 + (-1) + 2]\n        \\]\n        \\[\n        R1 + R2 + R3 = [0, \\quad 0, \\quad 0]\n        \\]\n        Since the sum of the row vectors is the zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent. A fundamental property of determinants states that if the rows (or columns) of a matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Interpreting the Question:** The main challenge is correctly interpreting the question. Realize that the explicitly given matrix A is the one whose determinant needs to be calculated, despite the potentially confusing terminology (\"adjacency matrix\").\n2.  **Extraneous Information:** Be aware that the parameter \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) is extra information designed to place the problem in a specific context but is not needed for the actual calculation. Do not try to incorporate the number 13 into the matrix.\n3.  **Accuracy in Calculation:** When calculating the determinant, be careful with signs, especially in the cofactor expansion method.\n4.  **Recognizing Properties:** The quickest way to solve the problem is by recognizing the linear dependence of the rows/columns, which immediately implies the determinant is 0. This is a common property of Cartan matrices of affine (but not finite) type.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the determinant of the given matrix A is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
