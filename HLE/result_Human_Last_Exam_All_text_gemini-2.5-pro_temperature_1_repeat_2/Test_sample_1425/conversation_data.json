    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function Z for the given system using path integrals.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Ensemble**\n\n*   **System Hamiltonian:** The problem provides the Hamiltonian of the system as $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. Here, $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator, and $\\mu$ is a constant parameter with units of energy.\n*   **Ensemble:** The system is in the grand canonical ensemble. This means it is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a large reservoir at a fixed temperature $T$ and chemical potential. The question uses the symbol $\\mu$ in the Hamiltonian, which is also the standard symbol for the chemical potential of the reservoir. This creates ambiguity. Let's analyze the most likely interpretations:\n    *   **Interpretation 1:** The given $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$ is the full operator in the exponent of the density matrix, i.e., the \"grand canonical Hamiltonian\" $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu_{res} \\hat{N}$ is given as $-\\mu \\hat{N}$. This is a common abuse of notation.\n    *   **Interpretation 2:** The system's intrinsic Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H}_{sys} = -\\mu_{H} \\hat{N}$ and it is in contact with a reservoir of chemical potential $\\mu_{res}$. The question uses the same symbol for both: $\\mu_H = \\mu_{res} = \\mu$. In this case, the grand canonical Hamiltonian is $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu_{res} \\hat{N} = -\\mu\\hat{N} - \\mu\\hat{N} = -2\\mu\\hat{N}$.\n\n    Interpretation 1 is simpler and a very common setup for textbook problems. It implies that the system has zero intrinsic energy ($\\hat{H}_{sys}=0$) and is in a reservoir with chemical potential $\\mu$. Let's proceed with this interpretation as it is the most standard reading of such a question.\n\n*   **Grand Canonical Partition Function (Definition):** The partition function is defined as $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta \\hat{K}}]$, where $\\hat{K}$ is the grand canonical Hamiltonian and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n*   **Our Operator:** Based on Interpretation 1, $\\hat{K} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. Therefore, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(-\\mu \\hat{N})}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{\\beta \\mu \\hat{N}}]$\n\n**2. Formulating the Path Integral**\n\nThe grand canonical partition function can be expressed as a functional integral over coherent state fields (Grassmann fields for fermions, complex scalar fields for bosons).\n\n*   **Path Integral Formula:** The partition function $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta \\hat{K}}]$ can be written as a path integral:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, e^{-S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\n*   **Euclidean Action:** The Euclidean action $S_E$ is derived from the grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K}$. For a general $\\hat{K} = \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{x}) K_{op} \\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x})$, the action is:\n    $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + K_{op}) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n*   **Determining the Action for Our System:** In our case, $\\hat{K} = -\\mu \\hat{N} = -\\mu \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{x}) \\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x})$. By comparing this with the general form, we see that the single-particle operator is just a constant, $K_{op} = -\\mu$.\n    Therefore, the action for our system is:\n    $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n\n**3. Evaluating the Path Integral**\n\nThe action is quadratic in the fields, so the path integral is Gaussian.\n\n*   **Formal Evaluation:** A Gaussian path integral of the form $\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, e^{-\\int \\psi^* M \\psi}$ is given by the determinant of the operator $M$.\n    $Z = [\\det(M)]^{-\\zeta}$\n    where $\\zeta = +1$ for bosons and $\\zeta = -1$ for fermions. In our case, the operator is $M = \\partial_\\tau - \\mu$.\n    $Z = [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{-\\zeta}$\n*   **Logarithm of Z:** It is often easier to work with the logarithm:\n    $\\ln Z = -\\zeta \\ln[\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)] = -\\zeta \\text{Tr}[\\ln(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]$\n    The trace (Tr) implies a sum over all single-particle states. We can represent these states by their momentum wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$ and their Matsubara frequency $\\omega_n$. The eigenvalues of the operator $\\partial_\\tau - \\mu$ in this basis are $(i\\omega_n - \\mu)$.\n    $\\ln Z = -\\zeta \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\sum_{n} \\ln(i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\n\n**4. Performing the Matsubara Summation**\n\nThe sum over Matsubara frequencies is a standard procedure in many-body physics.\n\n*   **Standard Result:** There is a standard formula for the free energy of an ideal gas, which results from this type of summation. For particles with a dispersion relation $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$ in a reservoir with chemical potential $\\mu_{res}$, the logarithm of the partition function is:\n    $\\ln Z = -\\zeta \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\ln(1 - \\zeta e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\mu_{res})})$\n*   **Applying to Our System:** We can map our problem to this standard formula. Our action $S_E = \\int \\psi^* (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi$ corresponds to a system with zero single-particle energy ($\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}=0$) and a reservoir chemical potential that is effectively equal to $\\mu$ (i.e., $\\mu_{res} = \\mu$).\n*   **Substitution:** Substituting $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} = 0$ and $\\mu_{res} = \\mu$ into the standard formula gives:\n    $\\ln Z = -\\zeta \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\ln(1 - \\zeta e^{-\\beta(0 - \\mu)})$\n    $\\ln Z = -\\zeta \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\ln(1 - \\zeta e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n\n**5. Final Expression for the Partition Function Z**\n\nThe sum $\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}$ runs over all possible single-particle momentum states. If the system is in a finite volume V, these states are discrete. Let $M$ be the total number of such single-particle states (which may include spin degeneracy). Since the term inside the sum does not depend on $\\mathbf{k}$, the sum simply becomes a multiplication by $M$.\n\n*   **Logarithm of Z:**\n    $\\ln Z = -\\zeta M \\ln(1 - \\zeta e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n*   **Partition Function Z:**\n    $Z = \\exp[-\\zeta M \\ln(1 - \\zeta e^{\\beta\\mu})] = [ (1 - \\zeta e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-\\zeta} ]^M$\n\nWe can write the specific results for bosons and fermions:\n\n*   **For Bosons ($\\zeta = 1$):**\n    $\\ln Z_B = -M \\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n    $Z_B = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\n    (This is valid for $\\mu < 0$ to ensure convergence).\n*   **For Fermions ($\\zeta = -1$):**\n    $\\ln Z_F = M \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n    $Z_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^{M}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Ambiguity in the Question:** The primary difficulty is the ambiguous notation \"Hamiltonian $H = -\\mu N$ in the grand canonical ensemble\". The interpretation chosen here is that the operator for the statistical weight is specified directly, which is the most common scenario for such problems.\n2.  **Bosons vs. Fermions:** The final result depends on the quantum statistics of the particles. The parameter $\\zeta$ ($\\zeta=1$ for bosons, $\\zeta=-1$ for fermions) is used to provide a general answer.\n3.  **Path Integral Formalism:** The core of the method involves expressing Z as a determinant, taking its logarithm to get a trace-log, and then evaluating the trace as a sum over momentum states and Matsubara frequencies.\n4.  **Matsubara Summation:** Direct evaluation of the Matsubara sum can be tedious. Recognizing the mapping to the well-known formula for the ideal gas partition function is a key shortcut. The effective single-particle energy in this problem is zero ($\\epsilon_k=0$), and the chemical potential is $\\mu$.\n\nThe final answer, expressed in a general form that is valid for both bosons and fermions, is presented below.\n\n***\n\nThe partition function $Z$ for a system of $M$ single-particle states, described by the grand canonical operator $\\hat{K} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$, depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions. The general expression can be written using the statistical parameter $\\zeta$, where $\\zeta=1$ for bosons and $\\zeta=-1$ for fermions.\n\nFor Bosons ($\\zeta=1$):\n$Z = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\n\nFor Fermions ($\\zeta=-1$):\n$Z = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^{M}$\n\nThese can be combined into a single expression:\n$Z = [(1 - \\zeta e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-\\zeta}]^M$"
