    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\n\nThe problem provides a system of four linear ordinary differential equations, known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, which describe the probabilities $P_i(t)$ of a system being in one of four states (0, 1, 2, 3) at time $t$. We are also given a normalization condition that the sum of probabilities is always 1.\n\nThe system is:\n1.  $P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)$\n2.  $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n3.  $P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)$\n4.  $P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n5.  $P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$\n\nThe transition rates are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\nWe are asked to find $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$. This corresponds to the steady-state probabilities of the system. In the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities become constant, so their time derivatives are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$. Let's denote the steady-state probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nSetting the derivatives to zero, the system becomes a set of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 p_{0} + 0.65 p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = -0.019 p_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4)p_{1} + 0.392 p_{2} + 0.008 p_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 p_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008)p_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 p_{2} - 0.008 p_{3}$\n5.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the System for Consistency**\n\nA crucial point in systems modeling physical probabilities (like Markov chains) is that the sum of probabilities must be conserved. Let's check the derivative of the sum of probabilities using the given differential equations:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}(P_0+P_1+P_2+P_3) = P_0' + P_1' + P_2' + P_3'$\nSumming the right-hand sides of the equations:\n$= (-0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1) + (-0.019 P_0 - 1.05 P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3) + (0.4 P_1 - 0.4 P_2) + (0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3)$\n$= (-0.019 - 0.019) P_0 + (0.65 - 1.05 + 0.4) P_1 + (0.392 - 0.4 + 0.008) P_2 + (0.008 - 0.008) P_3$\n$= -0.038 P_0 + 0 \\cdot P_1 + 0 \\cdot P_2 + 0 \\cdot P_3 = -0.038 P_0(t)$\n\nWe are given that $P_0+P_1+P_2+P_3 = 1$. The derivative of a constant is zero, so we must have:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}(1) = 0 = -0.038 P_0(t)$.\nThis implies that $P_0(t) = 0$ for all time $t$.\n\nIf $P_0(t) = 0$, the first equation gives $0 = 0 + 0.65 P_1(t)$, which means $P_1(t) = 0$.\nIf $P_0(t)=0$ and $P_1(t)=0$, the second equation becomes $0 = 0 - 0 + 0.392 P_2(t) + 0.008 P_3(t)$.\nThe third equation gives $P_2'(t) = -0.4 P_2(t)$.\nThe fourth equation gives $P_3'(t) = 0.008 P_2(t) - 0.008 P_3(t)$.\n\nFrom $0 = 0.392 P_2(t) + 0.008 P_3(t)$, and knowing probabilities must be non-negative ($P_i \\ge 0$), the only solution is $P_2(t)=0$ and $P_3(t)=0$.\nThis leads to $P_0=P_1=P_2=P_3=0$, which contradicts the normalization condition $P_0+P_1+P_2+P_3=1$.\n\nThe system as written is inconsistent. This points to a typo in the problem statement. In a standard Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the term for flow from state $j$ into state $i$ is positive. The term $-\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$ in the equation for $P_{1}'(t)$ should be $+\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$, representing flow from state 0 to state 1.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the Corrected System**\n\nWe assume the typo is corrected, and the second equation is:\n$P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\nNow, the steady-state system is:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 p_{0} + 0.65 p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = +0.019 p_{0} - 1.05 p_{1} + 0.392 p_{2} + 0.008 p_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 p_{1} - 0.4 p_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 p_{2} - 0.008 p_{3}$\n5.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\nThis is a consistent system for a Markov chain. We can solve it by expressing $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_2 = p_3$.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 p_1 = 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_1 = p_2$.\nTherefore, $p_1 = p_2 = p_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1 \\implies p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Normalization Condition to Find the Probabilities**\n\nSubstitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1) + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) p_1 = 1$\n\nTo avoid rounding errors, let's use fractions:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} = \\frac{650}{19}$\nSo, $(\\frac{650}{19} + 3) p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + \\frac{57}{19}) p_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} p_1 = 1 \\implies p_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\nNow we can find $p_0$:\n$p_0 = \\frac{650}{19} p_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\left(\\frac{19}{707}\\right) = \\frac{650}{707}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, which is $p_0 + p_1$.\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of digits, we get 0.94625.\n\nFinal Answer is the calculated sum.\n$p_0 + p_1 = 669/707 \\approx 0.94625$\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
