    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Title as the Question**\nThe prompt states, \"The title is a question\". The title is \"The Bays\". This is a homophone, a play on words that sounds like \"The B's\". This is the central clue that the answer will be a series of words that start with the letter 'B'. The haiku that follows provides the clues for these 'B' words.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Line of the Haiku**\n*   **The line:** \"An August tempest\"\n*   **The clue:** A \"tempest\" is a violent storm. The intensity of such storms and winds is measured on a scale.\n*   **The careful point:** The specific scale for wind force is the Beaufort scale, named after its creator, Sir Francis Beaufort.\n*   **The 'B' word:** **Beaufort**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Line of the Haiku**\n*   **The line:** \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"\n*   **The clue:** \"Twice fifteen\" is a simple calculation: 2 x 15 = 30. We need to find the significance of the number 30.\n*   **The careful point:** The phrase \"winds of change\" and the connection to the \"divine\" in the next line point towards a biblical reference. The number 30 alludes to the \"30 pieces of silver\" paid to Judas Iscariot for his betrayal of Jesus Christ.\n*   **The 'B' word:** **Betrayal**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Third Line of the Haiku**\n*   **The line:** \"A divine one yields\"\n*   **The clue:** \"A divine one\" refers to a god or deity. \"Yields\" means to produce, provide, or give.\n*   **The careful point:** A common concept across many religions is that a divine being gives or bestows a gift upon mortals.\n*   **The 'B' word:** **Blessing**.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble and Order the Final Answer**\n*   **The words:** We have found three 'B' words from the haiku: Beaufort, Betrayal, and Blessing.\n*   **The instruction:** The prompt asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order\".\n*   **Alphabetical Ordering:**\n    1.  **Beaufort** (Be**a**... comes before Be**t**...)\n    2.  **Betrayal** (The two \"Be-\" words come before the \"Bl-\" word)\n    3.  **Blessing**\n*   The final, ordered answer is the list of these three words.\n\n<<<Beaufort, Betrayal, Blessing>>>"
