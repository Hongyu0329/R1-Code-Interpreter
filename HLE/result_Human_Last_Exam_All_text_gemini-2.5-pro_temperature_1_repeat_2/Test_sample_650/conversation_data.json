    "An analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the input parameters:** The algorithm takes two integers, `n` and `c`, as input. The time complexity will be measured as a function of the input value `n`, assuming `c` is a constant base.\n\n2.  **Analyze the operations outside the loop (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0;` (1 assignment)\n    *   `x := n;` (1 assignment)\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` (1 division)\n    *   `a_{0} := x — qc;` (1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment)\n    *   These are a fixed number of elementary operations. In the standard RAM model of computation, each of these operations is considered to take constant time, O(1).\n    *   Therefore, the total time for Step 1 is constant, O(1).\n\n3.  **Analyze the `while` loop (Step 2):** The loop is the core of the algorithm. To find its complexity, we need to determine two things:\n    a. The cost of a single iteration of the loop.\n    b. The total number of times the loop will execute.\n\n4.  **Cost of a single loop iteration (Step 2.1):**\n    *   `i := i + 1;` (1 increment/assignment)\n    *   `x := q;` (1 assignment)\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` (1 division)\n    *   `a_{i} := x — qc;` (1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment)\n    *   Similar to Step 1, the body of the loop consists of a fixed number of elementary operations. Thus, the cost of each iteration is constant, O(1).\n\n5.  **Number of loop iterations:**\n    *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's track how the value of `q` changes.\n    *   Before the first iteration, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   At the end of the first iteration, `x` has the value `⌊n/c⌋`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is equal to `⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   At the end of the second iteration, `q` becomes `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    *   In general, at the end of the `k`-th iteration, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` is no longer greater than 0, i.e., when `q ≤ 0`. This happens when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`.\n    *   The condition `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0` is true if and only if `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, which can be rewritten as `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    *   Taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides gives `log_c(n) < k+1`.\n    *   The number of iterations is the final value of `i`, which corresponds to the number of times the loop body has been executed. This value is `k`. The loop runs for `k` iterations where `k` is approximately `log_c(n)`. More precisely, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the total time complexity:**\n    *   Total Time = (Time for Step 1) + (Number of Iterations) × (Time per Iteration)\n    *   T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) × O(1)\n    *   T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n))\n    *   For large values of `n`, the `O(log_c(n))` term dominates the `O(1)` term.\n    *   So, the final time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Model of Computation:** The analysis assumes the RAM (Random Access Machine) model, where basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on integers that fit in a machine word take constant time, O(1).\n2.  **Complexity Variable:** The complexity is expressed as a function of the magnitude of the input number `n`, not the number of bits in its representation.\n3.  **Logarithm Base:** The complexity is `O(log_c(n))`. According to the change of base formula for logarithms (`log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`), changing the base of the logarithm only introduces a constant factor (`1/log_b(c)`). In Big-O notation, constant factors are omitted. Thus, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)` for any constant base. However, `O(log_c(n))` is a more direct and precise representation based on the algorithm's structure.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of times the `while` loop executes. In each iteration, the value of the number being processed is divided by the base `c`. This repeated division by a constant factor leads to a logarithmic number of iterations. Since the work done in each iteration is constant, the total time complexity is proportional to the number of iterations.\n\nThe number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n<<<O(log_c n)>>>"
