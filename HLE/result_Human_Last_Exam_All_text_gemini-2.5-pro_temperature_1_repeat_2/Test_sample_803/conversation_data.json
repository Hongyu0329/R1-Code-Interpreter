    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set**: A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This implies `S ∩ S·S = ∅`. A key consequence is that the identity element `e` can never be in a product-free set, as `e·e = e`.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set**: A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Fills G**: A subset `S` of `G` fills `G` if the subgroup generated by `S`, denoted `<S>`, is equal to `G`.\n*   **Filled Group**: A finite group `G` is called filled if *every* maximal product-free set `S` in `G` fills `G`. This is a strong condition, as it must hold for all such sets.\n*   **The Groups in Question**: We are looking for groups `G` that are nonabelian and have order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number (`m ≥ 1`).\n\n### Step 2: Finding a Usable Criterion for Filled Groups\n\nDetermining all maximal product-free sets for a given group and checking the generation property is generally intractable. We need a more structural group-theoretic criterion.\n\n*   The groups in question, having order `2q^m`, are soluble by Burnside's `p^a q^b` Theorem.\n*   For finite soluble groups, there is a powerful characterization of filled groups established by V.D. Mazurov.\n    *   **Mazurov's Criterion**: A finite soluble group `G` is filled if and only if for every normal subgroup `N` of `G`, the Fitting subgroup of the quotient group `G/N`, denoted `Fit(G/N)`, is cyclic.\n*   The **Fitting subgroup**, `Fit(H)`, of a group `H` is its largest normal nilpotent subgroup.\n\nWe will use this criterion to identify the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of Groups of Order `2q^m`\n\nLet `G` be a nonabelian group of order `2q^m`.\n*   By Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups, `n_q`, must divide 2 and satisfy `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)`. Since `q` is an odd prime, `n_q=2` would imply `2 ≡ 1 (mod q)`, which is impossible. Thus, `n_q = 1`.\n*   This means the Sylow `q`-subgroup, let's call it `Q`, is unique and therefore normal in `G`. `|Q| = q^m`.\n*   The Sylow 2-subgroup, `P`, has order 2, so `P ≅ C_2`.\n*   `G` can be expressed as a semidirect product `G = Q ⋊ P ≅ Q ⋊ C_2`.\n*   Since `G` is nonabelian, the homomorphism `φ: C_2 → Aut(Q)` defining the semidirect product must be non-trivial. This means the generator of `C_2` acts as a non-trivial automorphism of `Q` of order 2.\n\n### Step 4: Applying Mazurov's Criterion (Part 1: The Base Case `N={e}`)\n\nLet's apply the criterion for the trivial normal subgroup `N = {e}`. This requires `Fit(G)` to be cyclic.\n*   We need to determine `Fit(G) = Fit(Q ⋊ C_2)`.\n*   `Q` is a normal `q`-subgroup, and `q`-groups are nilpotent. Therefore, `Q` is a normal nilpotent subgroup of `G`, so `Q ⊆ Fit(G)`.\n*   `Fit(G)` is itself nilpotent, so it is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Let `Fit(G) = F_q × F_2`, where `F_q` is the Sylow `q`-subgroup and `F_2` is the Sylow 2-subgroup of `Fit(G)`.\n*   `F_q` is a normal `q`-subgroup of `G`. Since `Q` is the maximal normal `q`-subgroup of `G` (as it's a Sylow subgroup), we must have `F_q ≤ Q`.\n*   `F_2` is a normal 2-subgroup of `G`. Since the Sylow 2-subgroups of `G` have order 2, `|F_2|` can only be 1 or 2.\n    *   If `|F_2|=2`, then `G` has a normal subgroup of order 2. This would imply `n_2=1`, making the Sylow 2-subgroup normal. If `P` is normal, the semidirect product becomes a direct product `G = Q × P`. For `G` to be nonabelian, `Q` must be a nonabelian `q`-group. In this case, `G` is nilpotent, so `Fit(G)=G = Q × C_2`. This cannot be cyclic because its subgroup `Q` is not cyclic. So this case is not filled.\n    *   Therefore, `F_2` must be trivial.\n*   This means `Fit(G) = F_q`. Since we have `Q ⊆ Fit(G) = F_q ≤ Q`, we conclude that `Fit(G) = Q`.\n*   For `G` to be filled, `Fit(G)` must be cyclic. This forces `Q` to be a cyclic group: `Q ≅ C_{q^m}`.\n\n### Step 5: Identifying the Candidate Groups\n\nWe have narrowed down the possibilities for filled groups to those where the Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` is cyclic.\n*   So, `G` must be of the form `C_{q^m} ⋊ C_2`, with a non-trivial action.\n*   The automorphism group `Aut(C_{q^m})` is isomorphic to the group of units `(Z/q^m Z)^*`. Since `q` is an odd prime, this is a cyclic group of order `φ(q^m) = q^{m-1}(q-1)`.\n*   A non-trivial action corresponds to mapping the generator of `C_2` to an element of order 2 in `Aut(C_{q^m})`.\n*   A cyclic group has a unique element of any given order. The unique element of order 2 in `(Z/q^m Z)^*` is `-1`.\n*   Thus, the only non-trivial action (up to isomorphism) is the inversion automorphism: `y ↦ y⁻¹` for `y ∈ C_{q^m}`.\n*   The group defined by this structure is `<x, y | y^{q^m}=1, x^2=1, xyx⁻¹=y⁻¹>`. This is the definition of the **dihedral group `D_{2q^m}`**.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Candidate `D_{2q^m}`\n\nNow we must verify that `G = D_{2q^m}` satisfies the full criterion: `Fit(G/N)` must be cyclic for *all* normal subgroups `N` of `G`.\n*   **Normal Subgroups of `D_{2q^m}`**: Since `q^m` is odd, the normal subgroups of `D_{2q^m}` are precisely the subgroups of its cyclic subgroup `Q = <y> ≅ C_{q^m}`. These are the groups `N_k = <y^{q^k}>` for `k = 0, 1, ..., m`.\n*   **Checking the Criterion for each `N_k`**:\n    1.  **`N = N_m = {e}`**: `G/N ≅ G = D_{2q^m}`. As we showed in Step 4, `Fit(D_{2q^m}) = Q = C_{q^m}`, which is cyclic.\n    2.  **`N = N_k` for `0 < k < m`**: The quotient `G/N_k = D_{2q^m} / <y^{q^k}>` is isomorphic to `D_{2q^k}`. The Fitting subgroup `Fit(D_{2q^k})` is its Sylow `q`-subgroup, which is isomorphic to `C_{q^k}`. This is cyclic.\n    3.  **`N = N_0 = Q`**: The quotient `G/N = D_{2q^m} / Q` is isomorphic to `C_2`. The Fitting subgroup `Fit(C_2) = C_2`, which is cyclic.\n*   Since the condition holds for all normal subgroups, the dihedral group `D_{2q^m}` is indeed a filled group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that for a nonabelian group `G` of order `2q^m` to be filled, its Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` must be cyclic. This requirement uniquely identifies the group as the dihedral group `D_{2q^m}`. The subsequent verification confirms that all these dihedral groups are indeed filled.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the dihedral groups `D_{2q^m}`.\n\n<<<The dihedral groups D_{2q^m}>>>"
