Compound 4 is 3,3-bis(2-carboxyphenyl)-3H-isobenzofuran-1-one. This is a lactone molecule containing a central carbon atom that is part of a six-membered ester ring fused to a benzene ring (a phthalide system). This central carbon is also bonded to two separate phenyl rings, each of which bears a carboxylic acid group at the ortho position.
