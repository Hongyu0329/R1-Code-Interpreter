    "This problem asks for the total number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a specific configuration of surface codes. We need to analyze the encoding capacity of each component and then combine them.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the System:** The system is described as \"two patches of surface code with two holes\". This means we have two identical, independent physical systems.\n    *   System 1: One patch of surface code with two holes.\n    *   System 2: One patch of surface code with two holes.\n    The total number of logical qubits will be the sum of the logical qubits that can be encoded in each patch.\n\n2.  **Analyze a Single Patch of Surface Code:** We need to determine how many logical qubits can be encoded in a single patch of surface code with two holes.\n    *   **Topological Qubits:** In topological error-correcting codes like the surface code, the number of logical qubits depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined.\n    *   **The Formula:** The number of logical qubits, $k$, that can be encoded on a 2D surface is given by the formula:\n        $k = 2g + b - 1$\n        where:\n        *   $g$ is the genus of the surface (the number of \"handles\" or \"donuts\"). For a simple flat plane or a sphere, $g=0$. For a torus, $g=1$.\n        *   $b$ is the number of boundaries or holes on the surface.\n\n3.  **Determine the Topology of a Single Patch:**\n    *   **Genus ($g$):** A \"patch\" of surface code implies a flat, planar layout. It is not wrapped around into a torus. Therefore, the genus $g = 0$.\n    *   **Boundaries ($b$):** We need to count all the boundaries.\n        *   A patch has an outer edge, which constitutes one boundary.\n        *   The problem states the patch has \"two holes\". Each hole punched into the surface creates an additional, separate boundary.\n        *   So, the total number of boundaries is $b = 1$ (outer edge) + $2$ (holes) = $3$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Logical Qubits per Patch:** Now we apply the formula $k = 2g + b - 1$ to a single patch.\n    *   $g = 0$\n    *   $b = 3$\n    *   $k_{patch} = 2(0) + 3 - 1 = 0 + 2 = 2$\n    *   Therefore, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode **2 logical qubits**.\n\n    *   **Intuitive Explanation:** With three boundaries (let's call them B1, B2, B3), you can create two independent logical qubits. For example, one qubit can be defined by logical operators connecting B1 and B2, and the second qubit can be defined by logical operators connecting B2 and B3. The operators connecting B1 and B3 would not be independent, as they can be formed by a combination of the first two.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Logical Qubits:** Since the system consists of two independent and identical patches, we simply add the number of logical qubits from each.\n    *   Total logical qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)\n    *   Total logical qubits = $2 + 2 = 4$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **\"Patch\" vs. \"Torus\":** It is crucial to distinguish a planar patch ($g=0$) from a toric code ($g=1$, no boundaries). The formula gives different results for each. A patch has physical edges.\n*   **Counting Boundaries:** Remember to count the outer edge of the patch as one boundary in addition to the specified holes.\n*   **Independence:** The two patches are separate systems, so their logical qubit capacities are additive. If they were connected, the topology of the combined surface would need to be analyzed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nEach of the two patches of surface code with two holes can encode 2 logical qubits. Since there are two such patches, the total number of logical qubits that can be encoded at most is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
