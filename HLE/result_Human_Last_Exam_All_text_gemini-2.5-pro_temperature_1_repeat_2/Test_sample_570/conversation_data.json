    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects a specific family of lines.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem and the Family of Lines\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum area of a convex domain `D` in the plane that has a non-empty intersection with every line given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\nLet `P` be the set of all pairs of coprime integers `(p, q)`. The pair `(0,0)` is excluded since `0x + 0y = 1` has no solution. For `(p,q)` to be coprime, they cannot both be zero. The set `P` consists of all primitive integer vectors in `Z^2`.\n\nExamples of lines in this family include:\n*   `p=1, q=0`: `x = 1`\n*   `p=-1, q=0`: `-x = 1` or `x = -1`\n*   `p=0, q=1`: `y = 1`\n*   `p=0, q=-1`: `-y = 1` or `y = -1`\n*   `p=1, q=1`: `x + y = 1`\n*   `p=1, q=-1`: `x - y = 1`\n*   `p=2, q=3`: `2x + 3y = 1`\n\nThe domain `D` must intersect all these lines.\n\n### Step 2: Translating the Intersection Condition using Support Functions\n\nLet `D` be a convex domain. The support function of `D`, denoted `h_D(u)`, is defined for a vector `u = (p,q)` as:\n`h_D(p,q) = sup {px + qy | (x,y) ∈ D}`\n\nA line `px + qy = 1` intersects the convex domain `D` if and only if `D` is not entirely contained in one of the open half-planes `px + qy > 1` or `px + qy < 1`. This means:\n`inf {px + qy | (x,y) ∈ D} ≤ 1` and `sup {px + qy | (x,y) ∈ D} ≥ 1`.\n\nUsing the support function, this translates to:\n1.  `h_D(p,q) ≥ 1`\n2.  `inf {px + qy} = -sup{-px - qy} = -h_D(-p,-q) ≤ 1`, which means `h_D(-p,-q) ≥ -1`.\n\nThe set of primitive integer vectors `P` is centrally symmetric. If `(p,q) ∈ P`, then `(-p,-q) ∈ P`.\nSo, for any `u = (p,q) ∈ P`, we must satisfy `h_D(u) ≥ 1`. If we apply this condition to `-u = (-p,-q)`, we get `h_D(-u) ≥ 1`. This automatically satisfies the second condition `h_D(-u) ≥ -1`.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the convex domain `D` of minimal area such that its support function satisfies `h_D(p,q) ≥ 1` for all coprime integer pairs `(p,q)`.\n\n### Step 3: Argument for Central Symmetry\n\nLet `D` be a convex domain that is a solution. Consider its central symmetrization `D_s = (D + (-D))/2`, where `-D = {-x | x ∈ D}`. `D_s` is a centrally symmetric convex set.\nThe support function of `D_s` is `h_{D_s}(u) = (h_D(u) + h_D(-u))/2`.\nSince `D` is a solution, for any `u = (p,q) ∈ P`, we have `h_D(u) ≥ 1` and `h_D(-u) ≥ 1`.\nTherefore, `h_{D_s}(u) ≥ (1+1)/2 = 1`. This means `D_s` is also a valid solution.\n\nBy the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, `Area(D_s) ≥ Area(D)`.\nThis implies that the minimal area will be achieved by a centrally symmetric body. Furthermore, a detailed argument shows that the center of symmetry must be the origin to minimize the area. So, we can restrict our search to origin-symmetric convex domains.\n\n### Step 4: Using Duality and Geometry of Numbers\n\nFor an origin-symmetric convex domain `D`, we can use the concept of the polar dual body. The polar dual `D*` is defined as:\n`D* = {u | u·x ≤ 1 for all x ∈ D}`.\nEquivalently, `D* = {u | h_D(u) ≤ 1}`.\n\nThe condition `h_D(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ P` means that no point `u ∈ P` can be in the interior of `D*` (where `h_D(u) < 1`).\nSo, `int(D*) ∩ P = ∅`.\n\nWe want to find `D` with minimal area. There are two key inequalities relating the areas of `D` and `D*` for origin-symmetric convex bodies in the plane:\n1.  **Minkowski's First Theorem**: If `K` is an origin-symmetric convex body with `Area(K) > 4`, then `int(K)` contains a non-zero integer lattice point.\n2.  **Mahler's Inequality (a reverse Blaschke-Santaló inequality)**: `Area(D) * Area(D*) ≥ 8`. The equality holds if and only if `D` (and `D*`) is a parallelogram.\n\nFrom our condition on `D*`, its interior cannot contain any primitive integer points `P`. If `int(D*)` contained any non-zero integer point `g`, it would also contain the primitive point `g/gcd(g)`, which is in `P`. Therefore, `int(D*)` contains no non-zero integer points.\n\nBy Minkowski's theorem, this implies that `Area(D*)` cannot be greater than 4. So, `Area(D*) ≤ 4`.\n\nNow, using Mahler's inequality:\n`Area(D) = Area(D) * Area(D*) / Area(D*) ≥ 8 / Area(D*)`\nSince `Area(D*) ≤ 4`, we get:\n`Area(D) ≥ 8 / 4 = 2`.\n\nThis proves that the minimal area of any such centrally symmetric convex domain must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing a Domain with the Minimal Area\n\nWe need to show that this lower bound of 2 can be achieved. Let's find a convex domain `D` with area 2 that satisfies the condition.\nConsider the square `S` with vertices at `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, and `(0,-1)`.\n*   `S` is a convex domain.\n*   `S` is centrally symmetric about the origin.\n*   The area of `S` is `(√2)² = 2`, where `√2` is the side length.\n\nNow, we must check if `S` satisfies the condition `h_S(p,q) ≥ 1` for all coprime `(p,q)`.\nThe support function `h_S(p,q)` is the maximum value of `px+qy` for `(x,y)` in `S`. Since `S` is a polygon, the maximum is achieved at one of its vertices.\n*   At `(1,0)`: `p(1) + q(0) = p`\n*   At `(0,1)`: `p(0) + q(1) = q`\n*   At `(-1,0)`: `p(-1) + q(0) = -p`\n*   At `(0,-1)`: `p(0) + q(-1) = -q`\n\nSo, `h_S(p,q) = max(p, q, -p, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\n\nFor any pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`, `p` and `q` are not both zero. This means at least one of them must be a non-zero integer. Therefore, `|p| ≥ 1` or `|q| ≥ 1`.\nThis implies that `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\nSo, `h_S(p,q) ≥ 1` for all `(p,q) ∈ P`. The square `S` is a valid domain.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have established that the minimal area must be at least 2, and we have found a specific convex domain that satisfies all the conditions and has an area of exactly 2. Therefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\nThe polar dual of our solution `S` is `S*`.\n`S* = {u | max(|u_1|, |u_2|) ≤ 1}` which is the square `[-1,1] x [-1,1]`.\n`Area(S) = 2` and `Area(S*) = 4`.\n`Area(S) * Area(S*) = 2 * 4 = 8`, which confirms that `S` is a parallelogram for which the equality in Mahler's inequality holds.\n\n<<<2>>>"
