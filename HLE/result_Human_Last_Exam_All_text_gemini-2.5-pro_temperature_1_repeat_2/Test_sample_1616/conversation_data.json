    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing (or Trisyllabic Shortening) is a historical sound change in English. It has two main conditions:\n1.  **The word must have at least three syllables.**\n2.  The rule shortens a **long vowel** when it appears in the **antepenultimate syllable** (the third syllable from the end of the word).\n\nFor example, the word `sane` has a long vowel /eɪ/. When we add a suffix to make it a three-syllable word, `sanity` (`sa-ni-ty`), the vowel in the first syllable (which is now the antepenultimate syllable) shortens to /æ/.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Word\n\nWe will examine each word from the list to see if it fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **southern**\n    *   **Syllables:** `south-ern` (2 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word has only two syllables. Therefore, it cannot undergo *trisyllabic* laxing, as the rule requires a minimum of three syllables.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While the vowel in `southern` (/ʌ/) is short compared to the diphthong in its root `south` (/aʊ/, from Old English long vowel /uː/), this shortening is due to a different process, not trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has NOT undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**\n    *   **Syllables:** `de-riv-a-tive` (4 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word has more than three syllables. The root is related to the verb `derive` (/dɪˈraɪv/), which has a long vowel/diphthong /aɪ/. In `derivative`, this vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable (`-riv-`) and has been shortened to /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a classic example of a word that HAS undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    *   **Syllables:** `se-ren-i-ty` (4 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word has more than three syllables. The root is related to the adjective `serene` (/səˈriːn/), which has a long vowel /iː/. In `serenity`, this vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable (`-ren-`) and has been shortened to /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is another classic example of a word that HAS undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    *   **Syllables:** `pleas-ant` (2 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word has only two syllables and does not meet the condition for trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The vowel in `pleasant` (/ɛ/) is short compared to the long vowel in its root `please` (/iː/). This shortening is an example of pre-cluster shortening (occurring before the `-nt` consonant cluster), not trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has NOT undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    *   **Syllables:** `grat-i-tude` (3 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word has exactly three syllables. It derives from the Latin root `grātus`, which had a long vowel `ā`. In `gratitude`, this vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable (`grat-`) and is shortened to /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word HAS undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**\n    *   **Syllables:** `shad-ow` (2 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word has only two syllables, so it cannot undergo trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This word comes from the Old English `sceadu`, where the first vowel was already short. There was no long vowel in its history that needed shortening. Therefore, the process of vowel shortening is completely irrelevant to this word.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has NOT undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 3: Select the Final Answer\n\nWe have identified three words that have not undergone trisyllabic laxing: `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`. Since the question asks for a single answer, we must find the most definitive case.\n\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` did not undergo TSL because they are only two syllables long. However, they are both related to roots (`south`, `please`) with long vowels, and their vowels were shortened by other rules.\n*   `shadow` is the strongest answer because it fails to meet the conditions for TSL in two fundamental ways:\n    1.  It is only two syllables long.\n    2.  Its root vowel in Old English was already short, so there was never a long vowel to be laxed (shortened) in the first place.\n\nTherefore, `shadow` is the word for which trisyllabic laxing is most unequivocally irrelevant.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
