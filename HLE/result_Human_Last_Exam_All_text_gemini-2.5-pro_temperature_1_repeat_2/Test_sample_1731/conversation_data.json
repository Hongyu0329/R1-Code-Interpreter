    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using the principles of Large Deviation Theory (LDT), embodied by the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Conceptual Framework: Large Deviations and Statistical Equilibrium**\n\n*   **Large Deviation Theory (LDT):** LDT provides a mathematical framework for understanding rare events. It states that the probability of a system's empirical properties deviating from their expected values decreases exponentially with the size of the system. The rate of this decay is given by a \"rate function,\" $I$.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** In statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state. In the language of LDT, this corresponds to the state where the rate function is minimized (i.e., the \"deviation\" is zero). Any other state is a \"large deviation\" and is exponentially less likely to be observed.\n*   **Theorems' Role:**\n    *   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem relates the probability of observing an empirical distribution to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from a true underlying distribution. In statistical mechanics, this theorem justifies the principle of maximum entropy. The rate function is shown to be equivalent to the negative of the system's entropy per particle. Therefore, minimizing the rate function is equivalent to maximizing the entropy.\n    *   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem deals with large deviations of the sample mean (e.g., mean energy). It establishes a Legendre transform relationship between the rate function (for energy) and the cumulant generating function (related to the free energy/log-partition function). This reinforces the connection between probabilistic LDT concepts and thermodynamic potentials.\n\n**2. Applying the Maximum Entropy Principle (Justified by LDT)**\n\nBased on the LDT framework, the path to finding the equilibrium values is to maximize the system's entropy subject to its physical constraints.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The System and its Statistics.** We are dealing with light quanta (photons), which are bosons.\n    *   They are indistinguishable.\n    *   Any number of photons can occupy the same quantum state.\n    *   The total number of photons is not conserved, which means their chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Correct Entropy Formula.** For distinguishable particles, one would maximize the Shannon entropy. However, for indistinguishable bosons, we must use the entropy derived from Bose-Einstein statistics. The number of microstates ($W$) for a given distribution of $n_j$ particles into $g_j$ degenerate states at energy level $\\epsilon_j$ is:\n    $W = \\prod_j W_j = \\prod_j \\frac{(n_j + g_j - 1)!}{n_j! (g_j - 1)!}$\n    The entropy is given by Boltzmann's principle, $S = k_B \\ln W$. Using Stirling's approximation ($\\ln x! \\approx x \\ln x - x$), this becomes:\n    $S/k_B = \\sum_j [ (n_j+g_j)\\ln(n_j+g_j) - n_j\\ln n_j - g_j\\ln g_j ]$\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Physical Constraint.** For a photon gas in thermal equilibrium (like in a blackbody cavity), the only macroscopic constraint is the total average energy, $E$.\n    Constraint: $\\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j = E$\n\n**3. Deriving the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nWe maximize the entropy $S$ subject to the energy constraint using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian is:\n$\\mathcal{L} = S/k_B - \\beta (\\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j - E)$\n\nSetting the derivative with respect to $n_j$ to zero ($\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_j} = 0$):\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_j} [(n_j+g_j)\\ln(n_j+g_j) - n_j\\ln n_j] - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n$\\ln(n_j+g_j) - \\ln(n_j) - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_j+g_j}{n_j}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_j \\implies 1 + \\frac{g_j}{n_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$\n\nSolving for the equilibrium occupation number $\\langle n_j \\rangle$:\n$\\langle n_j \\rangle = \\frac{g_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\nThis is the celebrated Planck distribution for the average number of photons in states at energy $\\epsilon_j$. The Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nTo find the total mean energy $E$, we must sum over all possible energies. For photons in a 3D box of volume $V$, the energy levels are quasi-continuous.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Density of States.** We must replace the sum with an integral and use the appropriate density of states, $g(\\epsilon)$, which counts the number of available quantum states per unit energy interval. For photons (with two polarization states), it is:\n    $g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n\nThe total mean energy is:\n$E = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n$E = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n\nTo solve the integral, we substitute $x = \\beta \\epsilon$:\n$E = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} (k_B T)^4 \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function, equal to $\\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 6 \\cdot (\\pi^4/90) = \\pi^4/15$.\n\nSubstituting this value gives the equilibrium mean energy:\n$E(T, V) = \\frac{8\\pi V (k_B T)^4}{(hc)^3} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$\n\n**5. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nThe entropy can be found using the thermodynamic relationship for a grand canonical ensemble where $\\mu=0$. The grand potential $\\Omega$ is related to the grand partition function $\\mathcal{Z}$ by $\\Omega = -k_B T \\ln \\mathcal{Z}$. The entropy is $S = (E - \\Omega)/T$.\n\nFirst, we find $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}$:\n$\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = -\\sum_j g_j \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) = -\\int_0^\\infty g(\\epsilon) \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) d\\epsilon$\n$\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = -\\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^2 \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) d\\epsilon$\nIntegrating by parts reveals a direct relationship between $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}$ and the energy $E$:\n$\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = \\frac{E}{3k_B T}$\n\nNow, we calculate the entropy:\n$S = \\frac{E - \\Omega}{T} = \\frac{E - (-k_B T \\ln \\mathcal{Z})}{T} = \\frac{E + k_B T (\\frac{E}{3k_B T})}{T} = \\frac{E + E/3}{T} = \\frac{4E}{3T}$\n\nSubstituting our result for $E$:\n$S(T, V) = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3} \\right) = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values are the expressions for mean energy and entropy as functions of temperature ($T$) and volume ($V$).\n\n<<<Equilibrium Mean Energy: $E(T, V) = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S(T, V) = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3}$>>>"
