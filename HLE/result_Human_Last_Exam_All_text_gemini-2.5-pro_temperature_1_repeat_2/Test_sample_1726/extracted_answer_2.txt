1. Yes. The time in one frame depends on both the time and space coordinates of another frame, so events simultaneous in one frame are generally not simultaneous in another.
2. Yes. The measured length of an object is relative to its motion. However, the effect is length expansion ($L = L_0 \sqrt{1+v^2/c^2}$), the opposite of length contraction in Special Relativity.
3. Yes. The duration of a time interval is relative to the observer's motion. However, the effect is time contraction ($\Delta t' = \Delta t_0 / \sqrt{1+v^2/c^2}$), the opposite of time dilation in Special Relativity.
4. No. The speed of light is not invariant. According to the velocity addition formula, an object moving at speed $c$ in one frame would be measured to have a speed of $\frac{c-v}{1+v/c}$ in a frame moving at velocity $v$.
5. Yes. Velocities add according to the non-Newtonian formula $u' = \frac{u-v}{1+uv/c^2}$.
6. The formula for the relativity of lengths (length expansion) is $L = L_0 \sqrt{1+v^2/c^2}$, where $L_0$ is the proper length, $L$ is the measured length, and $v$ is the relative velocity.
7. The formula for the relativity of time (time contraction) is $\Delta t' = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1+v^2/c^2}}$, where $\Delta t_0$ is the proper time interval and $\Delta t'$ is the measured time interval.
8. The formula for the non-Newtonian addition of speeds is $u' = \frac{u-v}{1+uv/c^2}$, where $u$ is the velocity of an object in frame S, $v$ is the velocity of frame S' relative to S, and $u'$ is the velocity of the object in frame S'.
