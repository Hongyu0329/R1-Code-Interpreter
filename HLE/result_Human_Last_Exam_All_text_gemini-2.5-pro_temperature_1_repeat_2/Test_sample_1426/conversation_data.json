    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Work:** The piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\". We need to look at the very end of the final (4th) movement, which is marked *Finale: Allegro con fuoco*.\n\n2.  **Locate the Specific Part:** The question asks for the part played by the \"first violin\" (Violino I in the score).\n\n3.  **Examine the Score at the Very End:** Accessing the musical score, we look at the last few measures for the first violin part. The end of the symphony is in the key of B Major.\n    *   The final measure consists of a single, long-held whole note. This note is **B5** (the B located in the space above the first ledger line above the staff).\n    *   The measure *before* the final one (the penultimate measure) contains a rapid, rising run of four sixteenth notes. These notes are **F#5 - G#5 - A#5 - B5**.\n\n4.  **Interpret the \"Three Notes\" Premise:** The question states that the part \"ends on three notes\". This is a slight simplification, as the score shows a four-note run followed by a single sustained note. We must interpret what \"the last three notes\" most logically refers to.\n    *   It does not refer to a chord, as the violins play a single melodic line here.\n    *   The most musically coherent interpretation is to look at the final melodic gesture that pushes towards the final, sustained note. This gesture is the end of the fast, rising run.\n\n5.  **Identify the Three Notes:** The final melodic push leading to and including the resolution consists of the last three distinct pitches played. The sequence of notes at the very end is F#5, G#5, A#5, and finally B5. The final three notes that form this concluding musical idea are:\n    *   **G#5** (the G-sharp in the space above the top line of the staff)\n    *   **A#5** (the A-sharp on the first ledger line above the staff)\n    *   **B5** (the B in the space above the first ledger line, which is the last note of the run and the final note of the symphony)\n\n6.  **Determine the Lowest Note:** Now we compare these three notes: G#5, A#5, and B5. In any musical scale, G# is lower than A#, which is lower than B.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The lowest of the final three notes in the concluding passage is **G#**.\n\n<<<G#>>>"
