    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Equations:**\n    The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. For a fluid with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ and pressure field $p(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ in three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$) and time $t$, the equations are:\n    *   **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n    *   **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n    Here, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity, and we have normalized the constant density $\\rho$ to 1.\n\n2.  **Define Symmetries and their Lie Group:**\n    A symmetry of a system of differential equations is a transformation of its independent and dependent variables that maps any solution to another solution. The set of all such continuous symmetries forms a Lie group. The dimension of this group is equal to the dimension of its corresponding Lie algebra, which is spanned by the infinitesimal generators of the symmetry transformations.\n\n3.  **Identify the Infinitesimal Generators:**\n    We seek the infinitesimal generators of the Lie group of point symmetries. These generators correspond to fundamental physical principles and scaling properties of the equations.\n\n    *   **Time Translation (1 generator):** The equations do not explicitly depend on time (they are autonomous). This implies invariance under time shifts $t \\to t + \\epsilon$. The corresponding generator is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$.\n\n    *   **Space Translations (3 generators):** The equations do not depend on the specific location in space (space is homogeneous). This implies invariance under spatial translations $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$. This yields three independent generators, one for each spatial direction: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_3}$.\n\n    *   **Spatial Rotations (3 generators):** The equations are isotropic, meaning they are invariant under rotations of the coordinate system. For a 3D space, there are three independent rotations (e.g., about the x, y, and z axes). The generators have the form $x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} - x_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + u_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_j} - u_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$. This gives 3 generators.\n\n    *   **Galilean Boosts (3 generators):** The equations are invariant under a change of inertial reference frame (Galilean relativity). A transformation to a frame moving with a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is given by $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t, \\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$. This gives three generators, one for each direction of the boost: $t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$.\n\n    *   **Scaling Transformation (1 generator):** There is a unique scaling transformation that leaves the Navier-Stokes equations invariant. This transformation scales time, space, velocity, and pressure in a coordinated way:\n        $t \\to a^2 t, \\quad \\mathbf{x} \\to a \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u} \\to a^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p \\to a^{-2} p$\n        This one-parameter scaling group corresponds to a single infinitesimal generator: $2t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} - 2p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\n\n4.  **Address the Infinite-Dimensional Symmetry:**\n    It is a crucial point that the pressure $p$ only appears in the momentum equation through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This means that if we replace $p$ with $p + g(t)$, where $g(t)$ is any arbitrary function of time, the term $\\nabla(p+g(t)) = \\nabla p$ remains unchanged. The incompressibility condition does not involve $p$. Therefore, the transformation $p \\to p + g(t)$ is a symmetry for any $g(t)$. This implies that the full symmetry group is infinite-dimensional.\n\n5.  **Interpret the Question and Final Count:**\n    In the context of such questions, it is standard practice to ask for the dimension of the *maximal finite-dimensional* part of the Lie group of symmetries. The infinite-dimensional part is considered a \"trivial\" or \"gauge\" symmetry and is usually excluded from the count.\n\n    Summing the dimensions from the finite-dimensional generators identified in Step 3:\n    *   Time Translation: 1\n    *   Space Translations: 3\n    *   Spatial Rotations: 3\n    *   Galilean Boosts: 3\n    *   Scaling: 1\n\n    The total dimension is the sum of these: $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
