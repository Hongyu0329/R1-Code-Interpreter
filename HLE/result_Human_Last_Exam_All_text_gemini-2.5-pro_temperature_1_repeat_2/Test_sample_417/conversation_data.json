    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the overall structure and symmetry of the molecule.**\n\nThe molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Central Core:** The core is a hexasubstituted benzene ring. It has methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6. It has three identical, large substituent groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C3 rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to its plane. This symmetry element makes the three methyl groups on the benzene ring (at C2, C4, C6) chemically equivalent. It also makes the three large substituents at C1, C3, and C5 chemically equivalent.\n*   **Strategy:** Due to this C3 symmetry, we only need to count the number of unique proton signals in one of the repeating units and add them up. A repeating unit consists of one methyl group on the central ring and one of the large substituent arms. Since all three methyl groups are equivalent, they will contribute only one signal. We then need to analyze one full substituent arm: `[((4S,7R)-...-yl)methyl]`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the protons of the central methyl groups.**\n\n*   The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 of the central benzene ring are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n*   These 9 protons will give rise to a single peak in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Signal Count = 1**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the protons of the linker group.**\n\n*   The substituent arm is connected to the benzene ring via a methyl group, which acts as a linker: `-Ar-CH2-N-`.\n*   The three `CH2` linker groups are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. We only need to analyze one.\n*   The `CH2` group is attached to a nitrogen atom that is part of a chiral ligand (the name specifies stereocenters (4S, 7R)).\n*   Protons in a `CH2` group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic. This means they are in chemically non-equivalent environments and will have different chemical shifts.\n*   Therefore, the two protons of each `CH2` linker are non-equivalent. They will typically appear as an AB quartet (two doublets).\n*   **Signal Count = 2**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the protons of the ligand itself.**\n\nThe ligand is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. Let's break down its structure and count the unique proton environments.\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a complex heterocyclic system. It consists of a pyrazole ring fused to a substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (norbornane-like) framework. The name specifies the IUPAC numbering and stereochemistry.\n*   **Chirality:** The ligand is chiral, as indicated by `(4S, 7R)`. It lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n*   **Counting Signals:** In a chiral molecule with no internal symmetry, every proton that is constitutionally unique (i.e., at a different position in the connectivity) will be chemically non-equivalent and produce a distinct signal. We must count every unique proton position.\n\nLet's list the protons based on the IUPAC name:\n1.  **Pyrazole Ring Proton (H at C3):** A stable N-substituted pyrazole ring has one C-H proton. This will produce one signal. **(1 signal)**\n2.  **Norbornane Framework Protons:**\n    *   **H at C4:** This is a bridgehead proton. It is unique. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **CH2 at C5:** The two protons of this methylene group are diastereotopic because they are in a rigid, chiral environment. They are non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **CH2 at C6:** Similarly, the two protons of this methylene group are diastereotopic and non-equivalent. They are also constitutionally different from the C5 protons. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Protons at fusion carbons (C3a and C7a):** In the saturated framework, C3a and C7a are methine (`CH`) carbons. They are in different environments within the chiral molecule. **(2 signals)**\n3.  **Methyl Group Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl at C7:** This is a methyl group on a bridgehead carbon. Its three protons are equivalent to each other due to free rotation. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **Methyls at C8:** C8 is the `methano` bridge. It carries two methyl groups (gem-dimethyl). Because these methyl groups are on a prochiral carbon within a chiral molecule, they are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n\n**Summary of signals from the ligand:**\n*   H at C3: 1 signal\n*   H at C4: 1 signal\n*   H₂ at C5: 2 signals\n*   H₂ at C6: 2 signals\n*   H at C3a: 1 signal\n*   H at C7a: 1 signal\n*   Methyl at C7: 1 signal\n*   Two Methyls at C8: 2 signals\n*   Total signals from one ligand = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **11 signals**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of expected peaks.**\n\nNow, we sum the signals from all the non-equivalent parts of the molecule.\n*   From the three central methyl groups: 1 signal\n*   From the three linker `CH2` groups: 2 signals\n*   From the three equivalent ligands (we count the signals for one): 11 signals\n\nTotal expected peaks = 1 (Ar-Me) + 2 (linker CH₂) + 11 (ligand) = **14**\n\nFinal verification: This result is robust as it does not depend on the subtle differences between the structure strictly interpreted from the IUPAC name versus the common camphor-derived analogue, as both lead to 11 signals for the ligand portion.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{14}$."
