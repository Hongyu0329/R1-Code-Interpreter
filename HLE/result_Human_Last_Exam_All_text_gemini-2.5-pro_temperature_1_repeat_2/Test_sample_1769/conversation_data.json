    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the origin of the current word \"sister\".**\nThe modern English word \"sister\" is not a direct descendant of the original Old English word. It is a loanword from Old Norse, the language of the Viking invaders. The Old Norse word was *systir*. This word was introduced into the English language during the period of Viking settlement in England (roughly 8th to 11th centuries) and gradually replaced the native Anglo-Saxon term.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the native Old English word for \"sister\".**\nBefore the influence of Old Norse, the Anglo-Saxons had their own word for a female sibling. This word was **sweostor**. This is the word that would have evolved into a modern form if the linguistic exchange with the Norse had never happened. *Sweostor* is a cognate of the Old Norse *systir*, as both descend from the same Proto-Germanic root (*swestēr*), but they followed different evolutionary paths in their respective languages.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the hypothetical linguistic evolution of *sweostor*.**\nTo determine what *sweostor* would have become, we must look at common sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English.\n\n*   **Old English to Middle English:** During this period, unstressed vowels were often reduced or dropped. The second syllable of *sweostor* was unstressed. The `eo` diphthong in the first syllable also tended to simplify, often to /e/. This would lead *sweostor* to become **swester** in Middle English. This form is actually found in historical texts, where it competed with the Norse-derived *sister* before eventually falling out of use.\n*   **Middle English to Modern English:** Starting with the Middle English form *swester*, we can project its path forward. The spelling and pronunciation of words with this structure are quite stable. The initial `sw-` cluster would remain (like in *swim*, *swan*). The vowel sound /e/ (as in \"west\") would also likely be preserved. The `-er` ending is also stable. Therefore, the Middle English *swester* would have evolved directly into the Modern English word **swester**.\n\n**Step 4: Look for corroborating evidence in related languages.**\nWe can check other West Germanic languages that, like English, descend from a common ancestor but were not subject to the same Old Norse influence on this particular word.\n\n*   **German:** The word is *Schwester*.\n*   **Dutch:** The word is *zuster*.\n\nBoth of these words are direct descendants of the same Proto-Germanic root as the Old English *sweostor*. Their modern forms are very similar to the hypothetically evolved English word \"swester,\" which strongly supports this conclusion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Language is not perfectly predictable:** This is an educated linguistic projection. While based on established patterns of sound change, other unpredictable social or dialectal factors could have altered the word's path.\n2.  **Coexistence of words:** The Norse *systir* did not immediately replace the Old English *sweostor*. The two forms coexisted for centuries, and the ultimate victory of \"sister\" was due to the significant cultural and linguistic impact of the Norse in the Danelaw region of England.\n3.  **Pronunciation:** The hypothetical word \"swester\" would likely be pronounced /ˈswɛstər/, rhyming with \"tester\" or \"jester\".\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence from linguistic evolution and comparative analysis with related languages, if the Norse had not introduced their word *systir*, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have evolved through the Middle English form *swester* to become the modern word **swester**.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
