    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n**Symbols:** `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`\n**Length:** Exactly 5\n**Precedence:** `!` > `&` > `|`\n\nWe can classify all possible valid expressions of length 5 by their structure. An expression can be built from smaller valid sub-expressions. The fundamental building blocks are the constants `T` (True) and `F` (False).\n\nLet's define the length of an expression `len(E)`:\n*   `len(T) = 1`, `len(F) = 1`\n*   `len(!E) = 1 + len(E)`\n*   `len((E)) = 2 + len(E)`\n*   `len(E1 op E2) = len(E1) + 1 + len(E2)`\n\nWe will count the number of true expressions for each possible structure of length 5.\n\n### Category 1: Expressions with One Operand\n\nThese expressions are built using one constant (`T` or `F`) and four symbols from `!`, `(`, `)`. The parentheses must be balanced.\n\n1.  **`!!!!A`**: `len=4+len(A)`. For len 5, `A` must be a constant (`T` or `F`).\n    *   `!!!!T` -> `!!!F` -> `!!T` -> `!F` -> `T`. (1 true expression)\n    *   `!!!!F` -> `F`.\n\n2.  **`((A))`**: `len=4+len(A)`. For len 5, `A` is `T` or `F`.\n    *   `((T))` -> `(T)` -> `T`. (1 true expression)\n    *   `((F))` -> `F`.\n\n3.  **`!!(A)`**: `len=2+len((A)) = 2+(2+len(A)) = 4+len(A)`. For len 5, `A` is `T` or `F`.\n    *   `!!(T)` -> `!(F)` -> `T`. (1 true expression)\n    *   `!!(F)` -> `F`.\n\n4.  **`(!!A)`**: `len=2+len(!!A) = 2+(2+len(A)) = 4+len(A)`. For len 5, `A` is `T` or `F`.\n    *   `(!!T)` -> `(T)` -> `T`. (1 true expression)\n    *   `(!!F)` -> `F`.\n\n5.  **`(!(!A))`**: `len=2+len(!(!A)) = 2+(1+len(!A)) = 3+(1+len(A)) = 4+len(A)`. For len 5, `A` is `T` or `F`.\n    *   `(!(!T))` -> `(!F)` -> `T`. (1 true expression)\n    *   `(!(!F))` -> `(!T)` -> `F`.\n\n**Total for Category 1: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**\n\n### Category 2: Expressions with Three Operands\n\nThe only way to have three operands and two operators in 5 symbols is `A op1 B op2 C`, where `A`, `B`, `C` are single symbols `T` or `F`. Due to operator precedence, parentheses are not needed. There are `2^3 = 8` combinations for the operands `A, B, C`.\n\n1.  **`A | B | C`**: This is true unless `A`, `B`, and `C` are all `F`. So, it's true for 7 out of 8 combinations. (7 true expressions)\n2.  **`A & B & C`**: This is true only if `A`, `B`, and `C` are all `T`. (1 true expression)\n3.  **`A & B | C`**: Parsed as `(A & B) | C`. This is true if `C=T` (4 cases) or if `C=F` and `A&B=T` (1 case: `T&T|F`). (5 true expressions)\n4.  **`A | B & C`**: Parsed as `A | (B & C)`. This is true if `A=T` (4 cases) or if `A=F` and `B&C=T` (1 case: `F|T&T`). (5 true expressions)\n\n**Total for Category 2: 7 + 1 + 5 + 5 = 18**\n\n### Category 3: Expressions with Two Operands\n\nThese expressions have one binary operator.\n\n1.  **`(A op B)`**: `len=3+len(A)+len(B)`. For len 5, `len(A)+len(B)=2`. So `A` and `B` must be `T` or `F`.\n    *   `(T | T)`, `(T | F)`, `(F | T)` are true. (3)\n    *   `(T & T)` is true. (1)\n    *   Total: **4** true expressions.\n\n2.  **`A op B` (no outer parentheses)**: `len=1+len(A)+len(B)`. For len 5, `len(A)+len(B)=4`.\n    *   **Case 2a: `len(A)=2`, `len(B)=2`**. `A` and `B` must be of the form `!X`.\n        *   `!T` is False, `!F` is True.\n        *   True expressions: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` (3), and `!F&!F` (1).\n        *   Total: **4** true expressions.\n    *   **Case 2b: `len(A)=1`, `len(B)=3`**. `A` is `T/F`. `B` is a length-3 expression that doesn't contain a binary operator (to avoid ambiguity with Category 2). `B` can be `!!X` or `(X)`.\n        *   Length 3 sub-expressions `B` (and their values): `!!T`(T), `!!F`(F), `(T)`(T), `(F)`(F).\n        *   For `A | B` to be true: `T | any B` (4) or `F | (B=T)` (2). Total: 6.\n        *   For `A & B` to be true: `T & (B=T)` (2). Total: 2.\n        *   Total: 6 + 2 = **8** true expressions.\n    *   **Case 2c: `len(A)=3`, `len(B)=1`**. Symmetric to 2b. Total: **8** true expressions.\n\n3.  **`!(A)`**: `len=1+len(A)`. The expression `A` must not need parentheses when negated. For example, `!(!T)` is `len=1+2=3`. However, if `A` itself contains operators, it must be parenthesized.\n    *   The form `! (A)` where `len(A)=2` gives `len=3+len(A)=5`. We need `A` to be a false expression of length 2. The only one is `!T`.\n    *   This gives `!(!T)`, which evaluates to `T`. (`!, (, !, T, )`).\n    *   Total: **1** true expression.\n\n**Total for Category 3:**\n*   From `(A op B)`: 4\n*   From `A op B` (no parens): 4 (2,2) + 8 (1,3) + 8 (3,1) = 20\n*   From `!(A)`: 1\n*   Sum = 4 + 20 + 1 = 25.\n\nLet's recheck the total. Category 3 is all 2-operand expressions. My sub-categories are disjoint.\n- `(A op B)`: Starts with `(`.\n- `!(A)`: Starts with `!`.\n- `A op B`: Starts with an operand (`T` or `F` or `!X`).\nThis seems correct. Sum is 25.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\n*   Category 1 (1 operand): 5\n*   Category 2 (3 operands): 18\n*   Category 3 (2 operands): 25\n\nTotal True Expressions = 5 + 18 + 25 = 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
