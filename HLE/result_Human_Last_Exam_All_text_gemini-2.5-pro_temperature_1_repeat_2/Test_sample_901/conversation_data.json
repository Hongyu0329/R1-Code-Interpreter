    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The conditions (secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base) strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Substrate:**\n    *   The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. In a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, an (S,R) or (R,S) configuration indicates that the two substituents are **cis** to each other. (An (S,S) or (R,R) configuration would be trans).\n    *   So, we are starting with the cis isomer of 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction:**\n    *   The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed (a beta-proton) must be in an **anti-periplanar** arrangement.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement. Both the leaving group and the beta-proton must be in axial positions, one pointing up and the other pointing down.\n\n4.  **Draw the Chair Conformations of the Substrate:**\n    *   Since the substrate is cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, it exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations.\n        *   **Conformer A:** Bromine (Br) is axial, and the methyl group (CH₃) is equatorial.\n        *   **Conformer B:** Bromine (Br) is equatorial, and the methyl group (CH₃) is axial.\n    *   The E2 reaction can **only** proceed from the conformer where the leaving group (Br) is in an **axial** position. Therefore, the reaction must proceed through **Conformer A (Br-axial, CH₃-equatorial)**. This conformer is also the more stable of the two, as the bulky methyl group prefers the equatorial position.\n\n5.  **Identify Available Beta-Protons for Elimination:**\n    *   We need to look for beta-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbon with the Br) that are axial and anti to the axial Br. The beta-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   Let's analyze the reactive conformer (Br-axial, CH₃-equatorial). Assume the axial Br is pointing \"down\". We need to find axial protons pointing \"up\" on C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is in the equatorial position. This means the hydrogen on C2 is in the **axial** position. This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination is possible here. Removing this H would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene** (the Zaitsev product, as it's the more substituted alkene).\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is equatorial, and one is **axial**. This axial hydrogen is also anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination is possible here. Removing this H would form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene** (the Hofmann product, as it's the less substituted alkene).\n\n6.  **Determine the Major Product (Regioselectivity):**\n    *   We have established that both the Zaitsev and Hofmann elimination pathways are stereochemically possible.\n    *   The choice of product is now determined by the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is a **large, bulky base**.\n    *   Due to its size, a bulky base has difficulty accessing sterically hindered protons.\n    *   The axial proton at C2 is sterically hindered by the adjacent equatorial methyl group.\n    *   The axial proton at C6 is much more sterically accessible.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky tert-butoxide base will preferentially abstract the more accessible proton from C6.\n    *   This leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene, the **Hofmann product**, as the major product.\n\n7.  **Identify the Name of the Major Product:**\n    *   The major product is formed by creating a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group remains on C2 (relative to the original numbering). When renaming the product according to IUPAC rules, the double bond gets numbering priority (C1=C6 becomes C1=C2). The methyl group is then on the third carbon of the ring.\n    *   The name of the major product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
