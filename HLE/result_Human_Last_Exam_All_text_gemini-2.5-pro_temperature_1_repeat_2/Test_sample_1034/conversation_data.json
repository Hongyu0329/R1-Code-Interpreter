    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem's Conditions**\n\nWe are given a triangle $A B C$ with the following properties:\n*   The length of side $B C$ is $S$. The variable $S$ is given as $S N Y W R$. In the context of the competition where this problem likely originated, this is a placeholder for a specific number. A common value for this placeholder is the year, so we will assume $S = 2021$.\n*   The measure of angle $B$ is $30^{\\circ}$.\n*   We are told that there are two possible values for the length of side $A B$.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of possible integer values for the length of side $A C$.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Geometric Configuration (The Ambiguous Case)**\n\nThis problem describes the \"Ambiguous Case\" of the Law of Sines (the Side-Side-Angle or SSA case). We are given two sides and a non-included angle ($BC$, $AC$, and $\\angle B$). The number of possible triangles depends on the length of the side opposite the given angle ($AC$) compared to the length of the other given side ($BC$) and the altitude from vertex $C$.\n\nLet's denote the side lengths as follows:\n*   $a = BC = S = 2021$\n*   $b = AC$\n*   $c = AB$\nWe are given $a$, $\\angle B$, and we are looking for the condition on $b$ that yields two possible values for $c$.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Conditions for Two Possible Triangles**\n\nLet's visualize the triangle. We can draw side $BC$ and the ray starting from $B$ that forms a $30^{\\circ}$ angle with $BC$. Vertex $A$ must lie on this ray. Vertex $A$ must also be at a distance of $b = AC$ from vertex $C$. This means $A$ is an intersection point of the ray from $B$ and a circle centered at $C$ with radius $b$.\n\nFor there to be two possible locations for vertex $A$ (and thus two possible lengths for side $AB$), the circle must intersect the ray at two distinct points.\n\nLet's find the altitude $h$ from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $A B$. In the right triangle formed by $B$, $C$, and the foot of the altitude, we have:\n$h = BC \\cdot \\sin(\\angle B) = a \\cdot \\sin(30^{\\circ})$\n\nThe conditions for the number of possible triangles are:\n*   **No triangle:** If $AC < h$. The circle is too small to reach the ray.\n*   **One triangle (a right triangle):** If $AC = h$. The circle is tangent to the ray.\n*   **Two triangles:** If $h < AC < BC$. The circle intersects the ray at two distinct points. This is the case we are interested in.\n*   **One triangle:** If $AC \\ge BC$. The circle intersects the ray at only one point in a way that forms a triangle with an interior angle of $30^{\\circ}$ at $B$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The crucial condition for having two possible values for side length $AB$ is that the length of side $AC$ must be strictly greater than the altitude $h$ and strictly less than the length of the adjacent side $BC$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Range for the Length of AC**\n\nUsing the values from our problem:\n*   $a = BC = 2021$\n*   $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$, so $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nFirst, calculate the altitude $h$:\n$h = a \\cdot \\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 2021 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1010.5$\n\nNow, apply the condition for two triangles:\n$h < AC < BC$\n$1010.5 < AC < 2021$\n\n**Step 5: Count the Number of Integer Values for AC**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer* values of $AC$ that satisfy this inequality.\nWe need to count the integers $n$ such that $1010.5 < n < 2021$.\n\n*   The smallest integer greater than $1010.5$ is $1011$.\n*   The largest integer less than $2021$ is $2020$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of integers in the range from $1011$ to $2020$, inclusive.\n\nThe number of integers in an inclusive range from 'First' to 'Last' is given by the formula:\nNumber of Integers = Last - First + 1\n\nNumber of values for $AC = 2020 - 1011 + 1$\nNumber of values for $AC = 1009 + 1$\nNumber of values for $AC = 1010$\n\nThus, there are 1010 possible integer values for the side length $AC$.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n1.  **Identify Key Information:** $BC = 2021$, $\\angle B = 30^\\circ$. Find the number of integer values for $AC$ that result in two possible lengths for $AB$.\n2.  **Apply Ambiguous Case Rule:** Two triangles exist if $h < AC < BC$, where $h$ is the altitude from $C$.\n3.  **Calculate Altitude:** $h = BC \\sin(B) = 2021 \\cdot \\sin(30^\\circ) = 1010.5$.\n4.  **Determine Range for AC:** $1010.5 < AC < 2021$.\n5.  **Count Integers:** The integers in this range are $1011, 1012, \\ldots, 2020$. The total count is $2020 - 1011 + 1 = 1010$.\n\n<<<1010>>>"
