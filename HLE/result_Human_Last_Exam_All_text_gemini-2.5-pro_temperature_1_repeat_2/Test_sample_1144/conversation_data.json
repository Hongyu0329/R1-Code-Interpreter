    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum ($\\Delta p$) to its actual momentum ($p$) while it is in the first Bohr orbit. This can be written as the expression $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n\n**2. List the Given Information and Necessary Constants**\n*   The electron is in the **first Bohr orbit**, which means the principal quantum number $n=1$.\n*   The uncertainty in its position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n*   We will need the following physical constants and principles:\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and momentum ($\\Delta p$). The mathematical relationship is $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar = h/2\\pi$). For calculation purposes, we find the minimum uncertainty by using the equality: $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n    *   **Bohr Model Quantization:** For an electron in the nth orbit, the angular momentum ($L$) is quantized: $L = n\\hbar$. For the first orbit ($n=1$), this simplifies to $L = \\hbar$.\n    *   **Definition of Angular Momentum:** Angular momentum is also defined as $L = mvr = pr$, where $p$ is the linear momentum and $r$ is the orbital radius.\n    *   **Radius of the First Bohr Orbit ($r_1$):** This is a known constant, also called the Bohr radius ($a_0$). $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 52.9 \\text{ pm}$.\n\n**3. Careful Points and Unit Consistency**\n*   The uncertainty in position is given in picometers (pm), and the Bohr radius is also conveniently expressed in picometers. It's important to use consistent units. Since we are calculating a ratio, the units will cancel out, so we can work directly in picometers.\n*   $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$\n*   $r_1 = 52.9 \\text{ pm}$\n*   The use of $\\hbar/2$ in the uncertainty principle is the more precise form. Some approximations use $\\hbar$, but $\\hbar/2$ is standard for finding the minimum uncertainty. We will proceed with this more accurate form.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step A: Determine the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$)**\nUsing Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, we can express the minimum uncertainty in momentum as:\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step B: Determine the momentum of the electron ($p$)**\nAccording to the Bohr model, for the first orbit ($n=1$), the angular momentum is:\n$L = 1 \\cdot \\hbar = \\hbar$\nWe also know that angular momentum is $L = p \\cdot r_1$.\nBy equating these two expressions for angular momentum, we get:\n$p \\cdot r_1 = \\hbar$\nSolving for the linear momentum $p$:\n$p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$**\nNow we can substitute the expressions for $\\Delta p$ and $p$ into the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}}$\n\nWe can simplify this complex fraction by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\cdot \\frac{r_1}{\\hbar}$\n\nThe reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ cancels out, leaving a very simple expression:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step D: Substitute the known values and calculate the final result**\nNow, we plug in the given values for $r_1$ and $\\Delta x$:\n*   $r_1 = 52.9 \\text{ pm}$\n*   $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{52.9 \\text{ pm}}{2 \\times 10 \\text{ pm}} = \\frac{52.9}{20}$\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
