No, it is not true. The statement that the 2nd postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the first is a common oversimplification. While combining the Principle of Relativity (Postulate 1) with Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism does imply a constant speed of light, this would make the theory of relativity dependent on the theory of electromagnetism. Einstein's formulation is more profound because he established the two postulates as independent principles. The second postulate is an essential, separate assertion about the fundamental nature of spacetime, required to reject Galilean relativity and derive the Lorentz transformations. Therefore, the second postulate is not superfluous.
