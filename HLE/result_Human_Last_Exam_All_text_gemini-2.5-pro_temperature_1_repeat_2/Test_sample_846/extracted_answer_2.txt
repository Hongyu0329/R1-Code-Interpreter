To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its physical shape. When the sun rises, the table must bend from a straight, elongated form (representing the stable trans-isomer) into a bent V-shape (representing the cis-isomer formed under UV light). When the sun sets and it becomes dark, the table must relax back to its original straight, elongated form (representing the thermal relaxation from the cis- to the trans-isomer).
