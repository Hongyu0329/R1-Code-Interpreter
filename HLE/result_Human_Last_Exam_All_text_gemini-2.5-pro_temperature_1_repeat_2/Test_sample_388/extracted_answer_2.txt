The most important counseling recommendation the pharmacist could make is to inform Allison that new, severe, or persistent headaches can be a rare but serious side effect of her birth control, Junel Fe. This type of headache can be a warning sign of a blood clot. The pharmacist should advise her to contact her doctor to discuss this new symptom, especially since it is a change for her. Additionally, the pharmacist could mention that taking Excedrin (which contains aspirin) with Fluoxetine can increase the risk of bleeding.
