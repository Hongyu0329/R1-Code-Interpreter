    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object and the question**\n*   $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   The ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex manifold of dimension 3 (real dimension 6).\n*   $X$ is a complex submanifold of dimension 2 (a complex surface), and thus a real manifold of dimension 4.\n*   We need to find the rank of the abelian group $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring it with the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. It corresponds to the number of $\\mathbb{Z}$ summands in its free part.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Long Exact Sequence of Homotopy Groups**\nThe most effective tool is the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair $(Y, A)$, where $Y = \\mathbb{CP}^3$ and $A = X$. The inclusion map is $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$.\nThe sequence is:\n$$ \\cdots \\to \\pi_{k+1}(Y, A) \\to \\pi_k(A) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_k(Y) \\to \\pi_k(Y, A) \\to \\cdots $$\nWe are interested in $\\pi_3(X)$, so we look at the relevant part of the sequence:\n$$ \\cdots \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\cdots $$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Homotopy Groups of the Ambient Space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$**\nThe homotopy groups of complex projective spaces can be determined from the Hopf fibration. For $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, this is the fibration $S^1 \\hookrightarrow S^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$. The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for this fibration is:\n$$ \\cdots \\to \\pi_k(S^1) \\to \\pi_k(S^7) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_{k-1}(S^1) \\to \\cdots $$\nWe know that $\\pi_k(S^1) = 0$ for $k > 1$.\n*   For $k=3$: The sequence gives $\\pi_3(S^7) \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_2(S^1)$. Since $\\pi_3(S^7) = 0$ (as $3<7$) and $\\pi_2(S^1) = 0$, we get $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n*   For $k=4$: The sequence gives $\\pi_4(S^7) \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_3(S^1)$. Since $\\pi_4(S^7) = 0$ (as $4<7$) and $\\pi_3(S^1) = 0$, we get $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the Long Exact Sequence for the Pair**\nSubstituting $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$ and $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$ into the sequence from Step 2, we get:\n$$ \\cdots \\to 0 \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 \\to \\cdots $$\nExactness at $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ and $\\pi_3(X)$ implies that the map $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X)$ is an isomorphism.\n$$ \\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) $$\n\n**Step 5: Use the Relative Hurewicz Theorem**\nThe problem is now to compute the relative homotopy group $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$. The Hurewicz theorem connects homotopy groups to homology groups.\nFirst, we need the connectivity of the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n*   The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem states that for a smooth complex hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ of complex dimension $n-1$, the inclusion $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $k < n-1$.\n*   Here, $X$ has complex dimension 2. So the theorem applies for $k < 2$.\n    *   $\\pi_0(X) \\cong \\pi_0(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ (both are connected).\n    *   $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. So $X$ is simply connected.\n*   The long exact sequence for the pair shows that $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) = 0$ for $k \\le 2$. The pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is 2-connected.\n*   The Relative Hurewicz Theorem states that if a pair $(Y, A)$ is $(n-1)$-connected (for $n \\ge 2$), then the Hurewicz map $h: \\pi_n(Y,A) \\to H_n(Y,A)$ is an isomorphism. Furthermore, if $\\pi_1(A)=0$, the map $h: \\pi_{n+1}(Y,A) \\to H_{n+1}(Y,A)$ is also an isomorphism.\n*   In our case, the pair is 2-connected, so we set $n=3$. We have $\\pi_1(X)=0$. Therefore, the Hurewicz map is an isomorphism for dimensions 3 and 4:\n    $$ \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) $$\nCombining with the result from Step 4, we have $\\pi_3(X) \\cong H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the Relative Homology Group $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$**\nWe use the long exact sequence of singular homology for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$:\n$$ \\cdots \\to H_4(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to H_3(X) \\to \\cdots $$\n*   **$H_3(X)$**: Since $X$ is a compact, oriented 4-manifold, by PoincarÃ© Duality, $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. By the Universal Coefficient Theorem, $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $H_1(X) = 0$ (from $\\pi_1(X)=0$ and Hurewicz), we have $H_3(X) = 0$.\n*   The sequence thus becomes: $H_4(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to 0$.\n*   This implies that $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is the cokernel of the map $i_*: H_4(X) \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n*   **The map $i_*$**:\n    *   $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the class of a hyperplane (a projective plane $\\mathbb{CP}^2$).\n    *   $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the fundamental class of $X$, denoted $[X]$.\n    *   The map $i_*$ sends $[X]$ to the class of the cycle $X$ in the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. As $X$ is a hypersurface of degree 5, its homology class is 5 times the generator of $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. So, $i_*([X]) = 5[\\mathbb{CP}^2]$.\n*   The map $i_*$ is therefore equivalent to the map $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ given by multiplication by 5.\n*   The cokernel of this map is $\\mathbb{Z} / 5\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   Therefore, $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5$.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\nFrom the previous steps, we have the chain of isomorphisms:\n$$ \\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5 $$\nSo, the third homotopy group of $X$ is the cyclic group of order 5. The question asks for the **rank** of this group. The rank of a finite group is 0.\n\nThe rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0."
