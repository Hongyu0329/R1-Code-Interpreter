Yes, changing the linker to incorporate a longer poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain is a very promising strategy that will likely solve the precipitation problem. PEGylation is a standard method to increase the aqueous solubility and reduce the aggregation of hydrophobic molecules by increasing overall hydrophilicity and providing steric hindrance. However, the potential impact on the probe's biological activity should be considered, and simpler solutions like lowering the probe's concentration should be tried first.
