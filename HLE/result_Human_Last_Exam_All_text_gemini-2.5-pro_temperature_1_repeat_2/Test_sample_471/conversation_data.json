    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Preliminaries**\n\n*   **Torus ($T^2$):** The 2-torus is a compact, connected, orientable surface without boundary. It can be visualized as the surface of a donut.\n*   **Smooth Function:** A function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is infinitely differentiable.\n*   **Critical Point:** A point $p \\in T^2$ where the derivative of $f$ vanishes. In local coordinates $(x,y)$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(p) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(p) = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Basic Existence of Critical Points**\n\n1.  The torus $T^2$ is a compact space.\n2.  Any continuous (and therefore smooth) real-valued function on a compact space must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n3.  Let $p_{max}$ be a point where $f$ attains its maximum value, and $p_{min}$ be a point where $f$ attains its minimum.\n4.  At a local maximum or minimum, the derivative of the function must be zero. Thus, $p_{max}$ and $p_{min}$ are critical points.\n5.  If the function is not constant, $p_{max} \\neq p_{min}$. Therefore, any non-constant smooth function on the torus must have at least **two** critical points.\n\n**Step 3: Applying Morse Theory for a Lower Bound**\n\nMorse theory provides a powerful connection between the number of critical points of a function and the topology of the manifold.\n\n1.  **Morse Function:** A smooth function is a Morse function if all its critical points are non-degenerate (meaning the Hessian matrix at each critical point is non-singular). Any smooth function can be slightly perturbed to become a Morse function without increasing the number of critical points. Therefore, the minimum number of critical points for any smooth function is achieved by a Morse function.\n2.  **Morse Inequalities:** For a Morse function $f$ on a compact manifold $M$, let $c_k$ be the number of critical points of index $k$ (the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian). The Morse inequalities state that $c_k \\ge b_k(M)$, where $b_k(M)$ is the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold $M$.\n3.  **Betti Numbers of the Torus ($T^2$):** The Betti numbers describe the topology of the torus.\n    *   $b_0(T^2) = 1$ (one connected component).\n    *   $b_1(T^2) = 2$ (two independent non-bounding loops or \"holes\").\n    *   $b_2(T^2) = 1$ (one \"void\" or enclosed volume).\n4.  **Applying the Inequalities to $T^2$:** For any Morse function on the torus, we must have:\n    *   $c_0 \\ge b_0(T^2) = 1$ (at least one minimum).\n    *   $c_1 \\ge b_1(T^2) = 2$ (at least two saddle points).\n    *   $c_2 \\ge b_2(T^2) = 1$ (at least one maximum).\n5.  **Calculating the Minimum Total:** The total number of critical points is $N = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. Based on the inequalities, the minimum possible number of critical points is $N \\ge 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\n**Step 4: The Poincar√©-Hopf Theorem as a Check**\n\nThis theorem relates the critical points to the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$ of the manifold. For a Morse function, the formula is $\\chi(M) = c_0 - c_1 + c_2$.\n\n1.  **Euler Characteristic of the Torus:** $\\chi(T^2) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n2.  **Checking our Minimal Numbers:** Let's see if the minimal values from the Morse inequalities ($c_0=1, c_1=2, c_2=1$) are consistent with the Euler characteristic.\n    $c_0 - c_1 + c_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n    This matches $\\chi(T^2)$. So, it is theoretically possible to have a function with one minimum, two saddles, and one maximum.\n\n**Step 5: Construct an Explicit Example**\n\nWe have established a lower bound of 4. To show that this is the minimum, we must demonstrate that there exists a function that achieves this bound.\n\n1.  **Represent the Torus:** We can represent the torus as the product of two circles, $T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$. Let the coordinates be two angles, $(\\theta, \\phi)$, with $\\theta, \\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n2.  **Define a Function:** Consider the function $f(\\theta, \\phi) = A \\cos(\\theta) + B \\cos(\\phi)$. For simplicity, let $A=B=1$, so $f(\\theta, \\phi) = \\cos(\\theta) + \\cos(\\phi)$.\n3.  **Find Critical Points:** We set the partial derivatives to zero:\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = -\\sin(\\theta) = 0 \\implies \\theta = 0$ or $\\pi$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi} = -\\sin(\\phi) = 0 \\implies \\phi = 0$ or $\\pi$.\n4.  **List the Critical Points:** This gives us four critical points on the torus:\n    *   $(\\theta, \\phi) = (0, 0)$\n    *   $(\\theta, \\phi) = (0, \\pi)$\n    *   $(\\theta, \\phi) = (\\pi, 0)$\n    *   $(\\theta, \\phi) = (\\pi, \\pi)$\n5.  **Classify the Critical Points:** We use the Hessian matrix of second derivatives:\n    *   $H = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial \\theta^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial \\theta \\partial \\phi} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial \\phi \\partial \\theta} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial \\phi^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cos(\\theta) & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos(\\phi) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   **At $(\\pi, \\pi)$:** $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Both eigenvalues are positive. This is a **minimum** (index 0). $f(\\pi, \\pi) = -2$.\n    *   **At $(0, \\pi)$:** $H = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are -1 and 1. This is a **saddle point** (index 1). $f(0, \\pi) = 0$.\n    *   **At $(\\pi, 0)$:** $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are 1 and -1. This is a **saddle point** (index 1). $f(\\pi, 0) = 0$.\n    *   **At $(0, 0)$:** $H = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Both eigenvalues are negative. This is a **maximum** (index 2). $f(0, 0) = 2$.\n\nThis function has exactly 4 critical points: one minimum, two saddles, and one maximum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis using Morse theory shows that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points. The construction of the function $f(\\theta, \\phi) = \\cos(\\theta) + \\cos(\\phi)$ demonstrates that this lower bound of 4 is achievable. Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   A simple argument based on the existence of a max and a min only gives a lower bound of 2. This is not sharp because it ignores the overall topology of the torus (its \"hole\").\n*   Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory provides a lower bound of $\\text{cat}(T^2) = 3$, which is better but still not sharp.\n*   The sharpest lower bound comes from the Morse inequalities, which require the number of critical points of each index to be at least the corresponding Betti number. The sum of the Betti numbers, $\\sum b_k = 1+2+1=4$, provides the correct lower bound.\n*   It is crucial to show that the lower bound is achievable by constructing an explicit example function.\n\n<<<4>>>"
