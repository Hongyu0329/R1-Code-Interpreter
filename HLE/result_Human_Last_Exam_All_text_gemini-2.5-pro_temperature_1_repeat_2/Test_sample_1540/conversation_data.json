    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most memory-efficient C program for the described problem and calculate the memory usage.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:**\n    The task is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length.\n    *   **Input:** Two strings, each on a new line.\n    *   **Length:** 1 to 100 characters each.\n    *   **Content:** Uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n    *   **Comparison:** Lexicographical, but case-insensitive ('a' == 'A').\n    *   **Output:**\n        *   -1 if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n        *   1 if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n        *   0 if they are equal.\n    *   **Constraint:** The solution must be the *most memory-efficient* in C. We need to find the total memory `m` in bytes used for the variables.\n\n2.  **Developing a Memory-Efficient Strategy:**\n    *   A standard approach would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays (e.g., `char str1[101], str2[101];`). This would use `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the string buffers.\n    *   To be more memory-efficient, we must minimize the amount of data we store. The input is read sequentially from `stdin`. This means we will read the first string entirely before we can read the second string.\n    *   Therefore, we *must* store the first string in memory to have it available for comparison. However, we do *not* need to store the entire second string.\n    *   The optimal strategy is:\n        1.  Read the first string into a character array (a buffer).\n        2.  Read the second string one character at a time.\n        3.  As each character of the second string is read, immediately compare it with the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n        4.  The comparison stops as soon as the first differing pair of characters is found.\n\n3.  **Identifying Necessary Variables and Their Minimal Types:**\n    Based on the memory-efficient strategy, let's identify the variables we need to declare and choose the smallest possible data types for them.\n\n    *   **Buffer for the first string:** The maximum string length is 100. In C, a string requires a null terminator (`\\0`). So, the buffer must be at least 101 characters long.\n        *   Variable: `char string1[101];`\n        *   Memory: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n    *   **Iterator/Index:** We need a variable to loop through the `string1` buffer. The index will go from 0 up to a maximum of 99. The standard `int` type (usually 4 bytes) is overkill. The smallest integer type in C is `char`, which can store values from -128 to 127 (if signed) or 0 to 255 (if unsigned). A `char` is perfectly sufficient to serve as an index up to 100.\n        *   Variable: `char i;`\n        *   Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n    *   **Buffer for the second string's character:** As we read the second string character by character using a function like `getchar()`, we need a place to store the character that was just read so we can compare it.\n        *   Variable: `char char2;`\n        *   Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n    *   **Result Variable:** We could use a variable like `int result = 0;` to store the outcome. However, a more efficient approach in terms of program flow (and to potentially save a variable) is to print the result and exit the program immediately upon finding the first difference. If the loop completes without finding any differences, we then print `0`. This way, no explicit result variable is needed.\n\n4.  **Final Variable List for the Most Memory-Efficient Solution:**\n    1.  `char string1[101];`\n    2.  `char i;`\n    3.  `char char2;`\n\n5.  **Calculating Total Memory Usage (m):**\n    We sum the memory used by each of the necessary variables.\n    *   Memory for `string1`: 101 bytes\n    *   Memory for `i`: 1 byte\n    *   Memory for `char2`: 1 byte\n    *   **Total Memory (m)** = 101 + 1 + 1 = **103 bytes**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis concludes that the most memory-efficient C program requires a buffer for the first string, a single-byte index for iteration, and a single-byte variable to hold the current character from the second string. The total memory used by these variables is calculated as follows:\n\n*   Buffer for the first string (100 chars + 1 null terminator): 101 bytes\n*   Index variable (of type `char`): 1 byte\n*   Variable for the character from the second string (of type `char`): 1 byte\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
