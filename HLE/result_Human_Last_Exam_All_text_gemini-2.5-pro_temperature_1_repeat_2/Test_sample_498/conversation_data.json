    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sequence to determine the next letter.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial sequence**\nThe given sequence of letters is: Z, X, X, C, V, Y, B, N, _\n\n**Step 2: Look for a primary pattern**\nObserving the letters, most of them seem to come from a standard QWERTY keyboard layout.\nLet's look at the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard:\n**Z, X, C, V, B, N, M**\nThe letters Z, X, C, V, B, and N appear in the sequence, in the correct order. This suggests the bottom row of the keyboard is the primary or base sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the letters that do not fit the primary pattern**\nIf we take the letters from the bottom row of the keyboard as our base sequence (Z, X, C, V, B, N, ...), the given sequence `ZXXCVYBN` has two extra letters: the second `X` and the `Y`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the rule for how the sequences are combined**\nLet's view the sequence as the primary keyboard sequence with some letters inserted into it.\n*   Primary Sequence: `Z, X, C, V, B, N, ...`\n*   Given Sequence:   `Z, X, [X], C, V, [Y], B, N, ...`\n\nWe can see a pattern here: an extra letter is inserted after every two letters of the primary sequence.\n*   After `Z, X`, the letter `X` is inserted.\n*   After `C, V`, the letter `Y` is inserted.\n*   Following this pattern, an insertion should occur after `B, N`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the pattern of the inserted letters**\nThe letters being inserted form their own sequence: `X, Y, _`\nThe most logical pattern for this sequence is simple alphabetical order.\n*   The first inserted letter is X.\n*   The second inserted letter is Y.\n*   Therefore, the third inserted letter should be **Z**.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the patterns to find the next letter in the main sequence**\nThe main sequence is constructed as follows:\n1.  Take the first two letters from the keyboard row: `Z, X`\n2.  Insert the first letter from the insertion sequence: `X`\n3.  Sequence so far: `Z, X, X`\n4.  Take the next two letters from the keyboard row: `C, V`\n5.  Insert the second letter from the insertion sequence: `Y`\n6.  Sequence so far: `Z, X, X, C, V, Y`\n7.  Take the next two letters from the keyboard row: `B, N`\n8.  The next step is to insert the third letter from the insertion sequence. As determined in Step 5, this letter is `Z`.\n\nSo, the letter that should appear next after `N` is `Z`.\n\n<<<Z>>>"
