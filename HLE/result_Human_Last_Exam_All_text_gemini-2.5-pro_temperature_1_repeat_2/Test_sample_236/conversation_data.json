    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Question:** How many elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings?\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question\n\n1.  **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_3^H$):** This is a group where elements are oriented homology 3-spheres. Two such spheres, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, are equivalent if there exists a 4-manifold (a homology cobordism) whose boundary is $Y_1 \\cup -Y_2$ and which is a homology product. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$. The inverse of an element represented by $Y$ is the element represented by its orientation-reversed version, $-Y$.\n\n2.  **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** This is a procedure that creates a 3-manifold from a knot $K$ in $S^3$. An integral surgery is specified by an integer framing, $n$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S_n^3(K)$.\n\n3.  **Representing Elements:** For the resulting manifold $S_n^3(K)$ to be a homology 3-sphere (and thus a potential representative of an element in $\\Theta_3^H$), its first homology group must be trivial. The first homology group of $S_n^3(K)$ is $H_1(S_n^3(K);\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$. This group is trivial if and only if $|n|=1$. Therefore, we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries.\n\n4.  **Knots with at most four crossings:** We must list all knots with a crossing number of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n    *   **0 crossings:** The unknot (0_1).\n    *   **1, 2 crossings:** No knots exist.\n    *   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot (3_1). This knot is chiral, meaning it is different from its mirror image. We must consider both the right-handed trefoil (3_1) and the left-handed trefoil ($\\overline{3_1}$).\n    *   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot (4_1). This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n### Step 2: List and analyze the surgeries for each knot\n\nWe will generate homology spheres by performing $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries on each of these knots. We use the crucial identity relating surgery on a knot and its mirror: **$S_n^3(\\overline{K}) \\cong -S_{-n}^3(K)$**.\n\n**A. The Unknot (0_1)**\n*   $+1$ surgery: $S_{+1}^3(0_1) \\cong S^3$.\n*   $-1$ surgery: $S_{-1}^3(0_1) \\cong S^3$.\n*   Both surgeries yield the standard 3-sphere, which represents the trivial element (the identity) in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_3^H$.\n*   **Contribution:** 1 element (the trivial one).\n\n**B. The Trefoil Knot (3_1 and $\\overline{3_1}$)**\n*   **Right-handed trefoil (3_1):**\n    *   $Y_1 = S_{+1}^3(3_1)$: This is the famous Poincaré homology sphere.\n    *   $Y_2 = S_{-1}^3(3_1)$.\n*   **Left-handed trefoil ($\\overline{3_1}$):**\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(\\overline{3_1}) \\cong -S_{-1}^3(3_1) = -Y_2$.\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(\\overline{3_1}) \\cong -S_{+1}^3(3_1) = -Y_1$.\n*   So, we have potentially four distinct elements represented by $Y_1, -Y_1, Y_2, -Y_2$. We must check if they are trivial or equal to each other in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\n**C. The Figure-Eight Knot (4_1)**\n*   This knot is amphichiral, so $4_1 \\cong \\overline{4_1}$.\n*   $Y_3 = S_{+1}^3(4_1)$.\n*   $S_{-1}^3(4_1)$. Using the identities: $S_{-1}^3(4_1) \\cong S_{-1}^3(\\overline{4_1}) \\cong -S_{+1}^3(4_1) = -Y_3$.\n*   So, we have potentially two distinct elements represented by $Y_3$ and $-Y_3$.\n\n### Step 3: Use invariants to distinguish the elements\n\nTo determine how many distinct elements we have, we use invariants of homology cobordism.\n\n1.  **Rokhlin Invariant ($\\mu$):** This is a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. For a homology sphere from surgery, $\\mu(S_{\\pm 1}^3(K)) = \\text{Arf}(K) \\pmod 2$, where Arf(K) is the Arf invariant of the knot.\n    *   $\\text{Arf}(3_1) = 1$. So, $\\mu(Y_1)=1$ and $\\mu(Y_2)=1$. This means $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ represent non-trivial elements.\n    *   $\\text{Arf}(4_1) = 0$. So, $\\mu(Y_3)=0$. This invariant alone cannot tell us if $Y_3$ is trivial.\n\n2.  **Casson Invariant ($\\lambda$):** This is an integer invariant for homology spheres with a Rokhlin invariant of 0. For $Y_3 = S_{+1}^3(4_1)$, we have $\\mu(Y_3)=0$. Its Casson invariant is $\\lambda(Y_3) = \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{4_1}''(1)$, where $\\Delta_{4_1}(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial.\n    *   For the figure-eight knot, $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = t^{-1} - 3 + t$. Its second derivative at $t=1$ is $\\Delta_{4_1}''(1) = 2$.\n    *   $\\lambda(Y_3) = 2/2 = 1$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda(Y_3) \\neq 0$, $Y_3$ is not homology cobordant to $S^3$ (which has $\\lambda=0$). So, $Y_3$ represents a non-trivial element.\n\n3.  **Heegaard Floer d-invariant:** This invariant helps distinguish $Y_1$ from $Y_2$.\n    *   $d(Y_1) = d(S_{+1}^3(3_1)) = -2$.\n    *   $d(Y_2) = d(S_{-1}^3(3_1)) = 0$.\n    *   Since $d(Y_1) \\neq d(Y_2)$, the elements represented by $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are distinct.\n\n4.  **Order of Elements:** We must check if any element is its own inverse (i.e., has order 2).\n    *   An element represented by $Y$ has order 2 if $Y$ is homology cobordant to $-Y$, but not to $S^3$.\n    *   For $Y_1$, $d(Y_1)=-2$ and $d(-Y_1) = -d(Y_1) = 2$. Since $d(Y_1) \\neq d(-Y_1)$, it is not of order 2.\n    *   The trefoil knot is fibered and has a non-zero signature ($\\sigma(3_1) = -2$), which implies that both $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ generate infinite-order summands in $\\Theta_3^H$. Thus they are not of order 2.\n    *   For $Y_3$, $\\lambda(Y_3)=1$. The connected sum $Y_3 \\# Y_3$ would have $\\lambda(Y_3 \\# Y_3) = \\lambda(Y_3) + \\lambda(Y_3) = 2 \\neq 0$. This means $Y_3 \\# Y_3$ is not trivial, so $Y_3$ is not of order 2.\n    *   Therefore, for any non-trivial element $Y$ we found, $Y$ and $-Y$ represent distinct elements in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\n### Step 4: Tally the final count\n\nLet's list the distinct elements we have found:\n\n1.  **From the Unknot:** The trivial element, [S³]. (1 element)\n2.  **From the Trefoils:**\n    *   $[Y_1] = [S_{+1}^3(3_1)]$\n    *   $[-Y_1] = [S_{-1}^3(\\overline{3_1})]$\n    *   $[Y_2] = [S_{-1}^3(3_1)]$\n    *   $[-Y_2] = [S_{+1}^3(\\overline{3_1})]$\n    *   These four are all distinct and non-trivial. (4 elements)\n3.  **From the Figure-Eight Knot:**\n    *   $[Y_3] = [S_{+1}^3(4_1)]$\n    *   $[-Y_3] = [S_{-1}^3(4_1)]$\n    *   These two are distinct and non-trivial. (2 elements)\n\nFinally, we must check if there is any overlap between the sets. The elements from the trefoil have Rokhlin invariant 1, while the elements from the figure-eight knot have Rokhlin invariant 0. Since the Rokhlin invariant is a group homomorphism, an element with $\\mu=1$ cannot be equal to an element with $\\mu=0$. Therefore, the sets are disjoint.\n\nTotal number of distinct elements = 1 (trivial) + 4 (from trefoils) + 2 (from figure-eight) = 7."
