    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Starting Molecule**\nThe molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means that in the 6-carbon glucose chain, the carbon atoms at position 1 (the aldehyde/anomeric carbon) and position 4 are the heavy isotope ¹³C. All other carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) are the standard ¹²C.\n\n*   **C1:** ¹³C\n*   **C2:** ¹²C\n*   **C3:** ¹²C\n*   **C4:** ¹³C\n*   **C5:** ¹²C\n*   **C6:** ¹²C\n\n**Step 2: Define the Metabolic Pathway**\nThe question specifies that the glucose molecule goes through **glycolysis**. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate. It is a sequence of 10 enzyme-catalyzed reactions.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Fate of Carbon Atoms during Glycolysis**\nThe core of the question is to determine if any carbon atoms are lost as CO₂ during the glycolytic pathway. Let's trace the carbons.\n\n1.  **Investment Phase (Steps 1-5):**\n    *   Glucose (6 carbons) is phosphorylated and isomerized to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (6 carbons). The carbon skeleton remains intact.\n    *   The crucial step is the cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the enzyme aldolase. It is split into two 3-carbon molecules:\n        *   Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which contains carbons C1, C2, and C3 of the original glucose.\n        *   Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which contains carbons C4, C5, and C6 of the original glucose.\n    *   The DHAP is then isomerized to another molecule of G3P.\n\n2.  **Tracing the ¹³C Labels:**\n    *   The first G3P molecule comes from C4, C5, and C6 of glucose. Its carbons are: C1 of G3P (from glucose C4, which is **¹³C**), C2 of G3P (from glucose C5), and C3 of G3P (from glucose C6).\n    *   The DHAP molecule contains C1, C2, and C3 of glucose. Its carbons are: C1 of DHAP (from glucose C1, which is **¹³C**), C2 of DHAP (from glucose C2), and C3 of DHAP (from glucose C3). When this DHAP is converted to the second G3P molecule, the ¹³C label is at the C1 position of this G3P.\n\n3.  **Payoff Phase (Steps 6-10):**\n    *   Both molecules of G3P are converted to pyruvate (a 3-carbon molecule).\n    *   During these steps (oxidation, ATP generation, and rearrangements), no carbon atoms are lost. Each 3-carbon G3P molecule becomes a 3-carbon pyruvate molecule.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the Overall Reaction and Conclusion**\nThe overall chemical equation for glycolysis is:\nGlucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) + 2 NAD⁺ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 Pyruvate (C₃H₃O₃⁻) + 2 NADH + 2 H⁺ + 2 ATP + 2 H₂O\n\n*   **Careful Point:** As the balanced equation shows, one 6-carbon glucose molecule is converted into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. There is no net loss of carbon atoms.\n*   **Careful Point:** The process of releasing CO₂ is called decarboxylation. A review of the 10 enzymatic steps of glycolysis confirms that **no decarboxylation reaction occurs**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since no CO₂ of any kind is released during glycolysis, the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released is zero.\n\n*(Note: CO₂ is released in subsequent pathways, such as the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction (link reaction) or alcoholic fermentation, but these are not part of glycolysis itself.)*\n\n<<<0>>>"
