    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring ones on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n(Oganesson is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally, so it is not considered).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas as a \"percentage of all terrestrial matter\". This includes the Earth's atmosphere, crust, mantle, and core. The vast majority of these gases are found in the atmosphere, so their atmospheric concentration is the primary indicator of their overall abundance on Earth. The specified year, 2002, is not significant, as the concentrations of these gases are stable over geological time and do not change meaningfully year to year.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas**\nLet's compare the typical atmospheric concentrations of the noble gases, which is the standard measure of their abundance.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** It is the most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.934% (or 9,340 parts per million, ppm) of the Earth's atmosphere.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** Its atmospheric concentration is about 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** Its atmospheric concentration is about 5.2 ppm. Although it is the second most abundant element in the universe, much of Earth's primordial helium has escaped into space due to its low mass.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Its atmospheric concentration is about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** It is the rarest of the stable noble gases, with an atmospheric concentration of about 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Special Case of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is different from the other noble gases because it is radioactive. It is not a primordial gas but is continuously formed by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Short Half-Life:** Radon's most stable isotope, radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Extremely Low Concentration:** Because it decays so quickly, radon cannot accumulate in the atmosphere or anywhere else. Its concentration is highly variable but always extremely low. On average, its atmospheric abundance is estimated to be around 1 part in 10^21 (one part per sextillion), which is many orders of magnitude lower than xenon.\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Conclude**\nLet's list the gases in order of abundance in the atmosphere, from most to least common:\n1.  Argon (Ar)\n2.  Neon (Ne)\n3.  Helium (He)\n4.  Krypton (Kr)\n5.  Xenon (Xe)\n6.  Radon (Rn)\n\nWhile Xenon is the rarest *stable* noble gas, Radon is a noble gas, and its steady-state concentration in all of Earth's matter (atmosphere and crust combined) is vastly lower than any other. Therefore, it is the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The question asks for the rarest noble gas, not the rarest *stable* noble gas. This makes Radon a valid candidate.\n*   The term \"all terrestrial matter\" solidifies the choice of Radon, as its total mass at any instant on the entire planet is minuscule due to its rapid decay.\n*   The year 2002 is irrelevant as these fundamental properties and abundances do not change on human timescales.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
