    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given a parametric curve, specifically a Lissajous curve, with equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\nA self-intersection point is a point (x, y) on the curve that is reached at two or more different parameter values (times) t.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Parameter Range**\nFirst, we determine the fundamental period of the curve, which is the time it takes to trace the entire figure before repeating.\nThe period of x(t) = cos(9t) is T_x = 2π/9.\nThe period of y(t) = sin(5t) is T_y = 2π/5.\nThe period of the entire curve is the least common multiple (LCM) of T_x and T_y.\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1 / GCD(9, 5)) = 2π * (1/1) = 2π.\nSo, we need to find all self-intersections for t in the interval [0, 2π).\n\n**Step 3: Set up the Equations for Self-Intersection**\nA self-intersection occurs when there exist two distinct values t1 and t2 in [0, 2π) such that:\n1.  x(t1) = x(t2)  =>  cos(9t1) = cos(9t2)\n2.  y(t1) = y(t2)  =>  sin(5t1) = sin(5t2)\n\n**Step 4: Solve the System of Equations**\nFrom equation (1), cos(A) = cos(B) implies A = 2kπ ± B for some integer k.\nSo, 9t1 = 2kπ ± 9t2.\n\nFrom equation (2), sin(A) = sin(B) implies A = mπ + (-1)^m * B for some integer m.\nSo, 5t1 = mπ + (-1)^m * 5t2.\n\nWe analyze the possible combinations of these conditions.\n\n*   **Case 1:** 9(t1 - t2) = 2kπ and 5(t1 - t2) = 2mπ (when m is even).\n    This implies k/9 = m/5. Since 5 and 9 are coprime, k must be a multiple of 9. For the smallest non-zero k=9, we get t1 - t2 = 2π. This corresponds to the curve closing on itself, not a self-intersection within the open interval (0, 2π).\n\n*   **Case 2:** 9(t1 + t2) = 2kπ and 5(t1 + t2) = (2m + 1)π (when m is odd).\n    This would require 2kπ/9 = (2m+1)π/5, which simplifies to 10k = 9(2m+1). The left side is even, while the right side is a product of two odd numbers, which is odd. This is a contradiction, so this case is impossible.\n\n*   **Case 3:** 9(t1 - t2) = 2kπ and 5(t1 + t2) = (2m + 1)π (m is odd).\n    These are pairs of times that generate intersection points.\n\n*   **Case 4:** 9(t1 + t2) = 2kπ and 5(t1 - t2) = 2mπ (m is even).\n    These are another set of pairs of times that generate intersection points.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Number of Unique Intersection Points**\nSolving for all valid pairs (t1, t2) in the interval [0, 2π) for Case 3 and Case 4 gives the total number of intersection \"events\". Then, one would need to calculate the coordinates (x(t1), y(t1)) for each event and count the number of unique coordinates. This process is lengthy and prone to error.\n\nA more direct method is to use a known formula for the number of self-intersections of Lissajous curves.\n\n**Step 6: Apply the Formula for Lissajous Curves**\nFor a Lissajous curve given by x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), there is a specific formula for the number of self-intersection points, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nThe formula is:\nNumber of intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nThe conditions for this formula to apply are:\n1.  `a` and `b` are integers greater than 1.\n2.  `a` and `b` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n3.  `a` and `b` are both odd.\n\nLet's check these conditions for our curve, where a = 9 and b = 5.\n1.  Are `a=9` and `b=5` integers greater than 1? Yes.\n2.  Are `a=9` and `b=5` coprime? GCD(9, 5) = 1. Yes.\n3.  Are `a=9` and `b=5` both odd? Yes.\n\nSince all the conditions are satisfied, we can confidently apply the formula.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Final Answer**\nNumber of self-intersection points = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nThe curve has 16 distinct self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
