    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe core of the question is to identify the mechanism that is \"most likely\" to cause two specific outcomes after a gene duplication event:\n1.  **Retention:** The duplicated genes are kept in the genome as functional genes, rather than being lost or silenced.\n2.  **Divergence:** The sequences of the two gene copies become different from each other over time.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Initial State and Common Fate of Duplicated Genes\nImmediately after duplication, the genome has two identical copies of a gene. This creates redundancy. Since one copy is usually sufficient to perform the original function, the second copy is often free from selective pressure. The most common outcome (fate) for this redundant copy is that it will accumulate random, disabling mutations and become a non-functional **pseudogene**. The question asks for a mechanism that allows the genes to avoid this fate and be kept.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Answer Choice\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a non-reciprocal process where one gene copy's sequence is \"copied over\" to the other, making them more similar or identical. This process actively works **against** divergence and promotes homogenization of gene families. Therefore, it is not the correct mechanism.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one copy becomes non-functional. While this is the most common **fate** of a duplicate gene and involves sequence divergence, it is a mechanism of functional **loss**, not **retention** of two functional genes. The question asks for a mechanism that retains both copies.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that one copy of the gene maintains the original function, while the other copy acquires mutations that give it a novel, beneficial function. This successfully explains both **retention** (as both the original and new functions are now favored by natural selection) and **divergence** (as the sequences change to suit their different roles). This is a plausible and important mechanism.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also called the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or was expressed in multiple places/times (subfunctions). After duplication, each copy loses a different subset of these original subfunctions through mutation. Consequently, both copies are now required to collectively perform the full range of the original gene's functions. This also explains both **retention** (both copies are now necessary) and **divergence** (as each copy specializes and its sequence optimizes for its remaining subfunction).\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary process where a single lineage diversifies into many different species that occupy distinct ecological niches. Gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels this process, but adaptive radiation itself is not the molecular mechanism within a genome that governs the fate of individual duplicate genes. It operates at the level of species and populations, not genes.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Plausible Mechanisms (C and D)\nWe are left with two valid mechanisms: neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization. The question asks for the **\"most likely\"** one. To decide, we must consider the probability of the events required by each model.\n\n*   For **neofunctionalization** to occur, the redundant gene copy must acquire a rare, beneficial, gain-of-function mutation before it is inevitably hit by more common, disabling mutations that would lead to pseudogenization.\n*   For **subfunctionalization** to occur, it only requires relatively common, random, loss-of-function mutations to occur in *different* parts of the two gene copies (e.g., in different regulatory elements or functional domains). This process can quickly make both copies essential, thus protecting them from being lost.\n\nBecause subfunctionalization relies on more common mutational events (loss of function) to ensure the retention of both copies, many evolutionary biologists consider it a more probable, and therefore **more likely**, initial pathway for preserving duplicated genes. It provides a stable state where both copies are maintained, giving them the evolutionary time needed to diverge further, perhaps even allowing one copy to eventually neofunctionalize.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nWhile both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization lead to the retention and divergence of duplicate genes, subfunctionalization provides a more likely route to escape the initial, high probability of gene loss, as it relies on more frequent mutational events.\n\n<<<D>>>"
