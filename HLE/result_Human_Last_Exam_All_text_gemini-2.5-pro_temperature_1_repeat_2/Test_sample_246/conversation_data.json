    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the components of the problem**\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot ($K$):** The simplest non-trivial knot, denoted $3_1$. Its knot group, $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$, is a well-understood group. A standard presentation for this group is $\\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy \\rangle$. This group is isomorphic to the braid group on 3 strands, $B_3$. The generators $x$ and $y$ can be chosen to correspond to meridional loops of the knot.\n*   **The 5-Twist-Spun Knot ($K_5$):** This is a knotted 2-sphere in $S^4$ created from the trefoil knot $K$ using the 5-twist-spinning construction, introduced by Zeeman. We denote it by $K_5 = TS_5(K)$.\n*   **The Double Branched Cover ($M$):** This is a 4-manifold, constructed as the 2-fold branched cover of the 4-sphere $S^4$ with the branch locus being the knotted 2-sphere $K_5$.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of this 4-manifold, $\\pi_1(M)$. This number is also known as the rank of the group, denoted $d(\\pi_1(M))$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil**\n\nAccording to a theorem by E.C. Zeeman, the fundamental group of the complement of an $n$-twist-spun knot, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_n)$, can be presented based on the group of the original knot.\nIf the knot group of $K$ has a presentation $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K) = \\langle x_1, \\dots, x_m \\mid r_1, \\dots, r_k \\rangle$, then the group of the complement of the $n$-twist-spun knot $K_n=TS_n(K)$ has the presentation:\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_n) = \\langle x_1, \\dots, x_m, t \\mid r_1, \\dots, r_k, [x_i, t^n]=1 \\text{ for } i=1,\\dots,m \\rangle$.\nHere, $t$ is a generator representing a meridian of the knotted sphere $K_n$. The relators $[x_i, t^n]=1$ mean $x_i t^n = t^n x_i$.\n\nFor the 5-twist-spun trefoil ($K=3_1$, $n=5$), the fundamental group of its complement, let's call it $\\Pi$, is:\n$\\Pi = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_5) = \\langle x, y, t \\mid xyx = yxy, [x, t^5]=1, [y, t^5]=1 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the fundamental group of the double branched cover**\n\nThe fundamental group of the double branched cover $M$ of $S^4$ over a knotted 2-sphere $S$ is obtained by taking the group of the complement, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S)$, and adding the relation that the square of a meridian of $S$ is the identity element.\nIn our case, the meridian is represented by the generator $t$. So, we add the relation $t^2=1$ to the presentation of $\\Pi$.\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\Pi / \\langle t^2=1 \\rangle^N = \\langle x, y, t \\mid xyx = yxy, [x, t^5]=1, [y, t^5]=1, t^2=1 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the presentation of the fundamental group**\n\nThe relation $t^2=1$ has a significant consequence. It implies $t^{-1}=t$. We can use this to simplify the relation $t^5=1$.\n$t^5 = t \\cdot t^4 = t \\cdot (t^2)^2 = t \\cdot 1^2 = t$.\nSubstituting $t^5=t$ into the commuting relations gives:\n$[x, t] = 1 \\implies xt = tx$\n$[y, t] = 1 \\implies yt = ty$\nThis means the generator $t$ commutes with the generators $x$ and $y$. Since $x$ and $y$ generate the trefoil group part, $t$ commutes with every element of that subgroup.\nThe presentation for $\\pi_1(M)$ simplifies to:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\langle x, y, t \\mid xyx = yxy, xt=tx, yt=ty, t^2=1 \\rangle$.\nThis is the standard presentation for the direct product of the trefoil group $B_3 = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx=yxy \\rangle$ and the cyclic group of order 2, $\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\langle t \\mid t^2=1 \\rangle$.\nSo, $\\pi_1(M) \\cong B_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the minimal number of generators for $B_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$**\n\nLet $d(G)$ be the minimal number of generators for a group $G$. We want to find $d(B_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2)$.\n\n1.  **Lower Bound:** A group that can be generated by a single element must be cyclic, and therefore abelian. The group $B_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is not abelian because its factor $B_3$ is not abelian (e.g., $xy \\neq yx$). Thus, $B_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ cannot be generated by one element. So, $d(B_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\ge 2$.\n\n2.  **Upper Bound:** We can try to construct a generating set with 2 elements. Let $x, y$ be the generators for $B_3$ and $t$ be the generator for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Consider the following two elements in $B_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$:\n    $a = (x, t)$\n    $b = (y, 1)$\n    We want to show that the set $\\{a, b\\}$ generates the entire group $B_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. To do this, we need to show that we can generate the elements $(x, 1)$, $(y, 1)$, and $(1, t)$, since these are known to generate the group.\n    We already have $b = (y, 1)$. If we can generate $(1, t)$, we can also generate $(x, 1)$ by computing $a \\cdot (1,t)^{-1} = (x,t)(1,t) = (x, 1)$.\n    To generate $(1, t)$, we need to find a word $W(a, b)$ that equals $(1, t)$. Let $W(a,b) = a^{i_1}b^{j_1}a^{i_2}b^{j_2}\\dots$. This element is equal to $(W'(x,y), t^{\\sum i_k})$, where $W'(x,y)$ is the corresponding word in $B_3$ and $\\sum i_k$ is the sum of the exponents of $a$. This sum is also the sum of the exponents of $x$ in $W'(x,y)$, which we denote $e_x(W')$.\n    So, we need to find a word $W'(x,y)$ such that $W'(x,y)=1$ in $B_3$ (i.e., a relator) and its exponent sum of $x$, $e_x(W')$, is odd.\n    The defining relation for $B_3$ is $xyx=yxy$. This can be written as a relator $R(x,y) = xyx(yxy)^{-1} = xyxy^{-1}x^{-1}y^{-1} = 1$.\n    Let's compute the exponent sum of $x$ in this relator $R = x^1 y^1 x^1 y^{-1} x^{-1} y^{-1}$:\n    $e_x(R) = 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1$.\n    Since $e_x(R)=1$ is odd, we have found such a relator.\n    Now, let's construct the corresponding word with our generators $a$ and $b$:\n    $W(a,b) = aba b^{-1} a^{-1} b^{-1}$.\n    The first component is $xyxy^{-1}x^{-1}y^{-1} = R(x,y) = 1$.\n    The second component is $t^{e_x(R)} = t^1 = t$.\n    So, $W(a,b) = (1, t)$.\n    Since we can generate $(1,t)$ and we have $(y,1)$, we can generate the whole group. Thus, the set $\\{(x,t), (y,1)\\}$ is a generating set of size 2.\n    This shows that $d(B_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\le 2$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFrom the lower bound ($d(B_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\ge 2$) and the upper bound ($d(B_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\le 2$), we conclude that the minimal number of generators is exactly 2.\n\nThe number of twists being 5 (an odd number) was crucial. If it had been an even number, say $n=4$, the relation $t^4=(t^2)^2=1$ would be trivial, and the fundamental group would have been the free product $B_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_2$, which requires $d(B_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_2) = d(B_3) + d(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = 2+1=3$ generators."
