    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function `f`\n\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We are looking for continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of `f`**:\n    Suppose $f(a) = f(b)$ for some $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(a)) = f(f(b))$.\n    Using the given equation, this means $\\exp(a) = \\exp(b)$.\n    Since the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, it is injective. Therefore, $a = b$.\n    This shows that $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of `f`**:\n    The problem states that $f$ is continuous. A continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. That is, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n### Step 2: Case 1 - `f` is strictly decreasing\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function.\n\n1.  **Existence of a fixed point**: Consider the function $g(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f(x)$ is continuous, $g(x)$ is also continuous. As $f$ is strictly decreasing, there exists some $M$ such that $f'(x) \\le M < 0$ is not necessarily true, but we know that for any $x_1 < x_2$, $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$.\n    Let's analyze the limits of $g(x)$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $x$ goes to $\\infty$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$ is either a finite value $L$ or $-\\infty$. In either case, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} (f(x) - x) = -\\infty$.\n    Similarly, as $x \\to -\\infty$, $x$ goes to $-\\infty$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ is either a finite value $M$ or $+\\infty$. In either case, $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} (f(x) - x) = +\\infty$.\n    Since $g(x)$ is a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ that goes from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist at least one point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(x_0) = 0$. This means $f(x_0) = x_0$. So, $f$ must have a fixed point.\n\n2.  **Contradiction**: If $f$ has a fixed point $x_0$, then $f(x_0) = x_0$. Applying $f$ again, we get $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    From the given equation, this implies $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$.\n    However, the equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions. This can be seen by noting that $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. (The minimum of $h(x) = e^x - x$ occurs at $x=0$, where $h(0) = 1 > 0$).\n    This is a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that $f$ is strictly decreasing must be false.\n\n### Step 3: Case 2 - `f` is strictly increasing\n\nNow, let's assume $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function.\n\n1.  **Properties of increasing `f`**:\n    *   If $f$ is increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also increasing. This is consistent with $\\exp(x)$ being an increasing function.\n    *   **$f(x) > x$ for all $x$**: Suppose for some $x_0$, we have $f(x_0) \\le x_0$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, we can apply it to the inequality: $f(f(x_0)) \\le f(x_0)$. Combining these, we get $f(f(x_0)) \\le x_0$. But the given equation says $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$, so we would have $\\exp(x_0) \\le x_0$. This contradicts the known fact that $\\exp(x) > x$ for all real $x$. Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   **Commutation with exp**: We have $f(f(f(x))) = f(\\exp(x))$ and also $f(f(f(x))) = \\exp(f(x))$. Thus, $f$ must satisfy the commutation relation: $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$.\n    *   **Range of `f`**: The range of $f \\circ f$ is the range of $\\exp(x)$, which is $(0, \\infty)$. Let the range of $f$ be $Im(f)$. Then $f(Im(f)) = (0, \\infty)$. Since $f$ is a continuous increasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range $Im(f)$ must be an open interval $(c, d)$, where $c = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ and $d = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$. So $f((c,d)) = (0, \\infty)$. Since $f$ is increasing, this implies $\\lim_{y\\to c^+} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y\\to d^-} f(y) = \\infty$. The second limit implies $d=\\infty$. For the first limit, if $c$ were $-\\infty$, then $\\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} f(y) = 0$. But this contradicts $f(y)>y$, which implies $\\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} f(y) = -\\infty$. Thus, $c$ must be a finite real number. By continuity of $f$, we must have $f(c)=0$. From $f(x)>x$, we have $f(c)>c$, which means $0>c$. So, $c$ is a negative number.\n\n2.  **Construction of Solutions**:\n    A strictly increasing solution $f$ is characterized by a real number $c<0$ such that:\n    *   The range of $f$ is $(c, \\infty)$.\n    *   $f(c) = 0$.\n    *   From $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)$, we have $f(f(c)) = \\exp(c) \\implies f(0) = \\exp(c)$.\n\n    The function $f$ is uniquely determined if we define it on the interval $[c, 0]$.\n    Let $\\phi(x) = f(x)$ for $x \\in [c, 0]$. Then $\\phi$ must be a continuous, strictly increasing function that maps the interval $[c, 0]$ to $[f(c), f(0)] = [0, \\exp(c)]$.\n    Furthermore, from $f(x)>x$, we must have $\\phi(x)>x$ for all $x \\in [c,0]$. We can also show that $f(x) < \\exp(x)$ must hold, which means $\\phi(x) < \\exp(x)$.\n    So, any such solution $f$ is generated by:\n    a.  Choosing a real number $c < 0$.\n    b.  Choosing a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi: [c, 0] \\to [0, \\exp(c)]$ such that for all $x \\in (c, 0)$, we have $x < \\phi(x) < \\exp(x)$.\n\n    Once $\\phi$ is chosen, $f$ is uniquely determined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For example, if $x \\in (0, \\exp(c)]$, then $x=\\phi(y)$ for a unique $y \\in (c, 0]$, and we define $f(x) = f(\\phi(y)) = f(f(y)) = \\exp(y)$. This process can be extended to define $f$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n3.  **Counting the Solutions**:\n    The set of solutions is the union of sets of solutions $S_c$ for each possible value of $c$.\n    *   **Number of choices for `c`**: The constant `c` can be any number in the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$. The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum, $|(-\\infty, 0)| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Different values of `c` produce different functions since their ranges are different.\n    *   **Number of choices for `\\phi` for a fixed `c`**: For any given $c<0$, we need to count the number of valid \"seed\" functions $\\phi$. The set of valid functions $\\phi$ is a subset of the space of all continuous functions from $[c, 0]$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, $C([c,0])$. This space has cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$. The conditions on $\\phi$ (monotonicity and $x < \\phi(x) < \\exp(x)$) define a non-empty subset. For any $x_0 \\in (c, 0)$, the value $\\phi(x_0)$ can be chosen from a non-degenerate interval of real numbers. This freedom of choice implies that there are at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$ such functions $\\phi$. Since this is also the maximum possible number, the cardinality of the set of valid functions $\\phi$ is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n4.  **Total Cardinality**:\n    The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for $c$ and the number of choices for $\\phi$ for each $c$.\n    Total Cardinality = $|(-\\infty, 0)| \\times |\\{\\phi\\}| = 2^{\\aleph_0} \\times 2^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere are no strictly decreasing solutions. There is a family of strictly increasing solutions, parameterized by a real number $c<0$ and a \"seed\" function $\\phi$ on $[c,0]$. The total number of such functions is the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<2^{\\aleph_0}>>>"
