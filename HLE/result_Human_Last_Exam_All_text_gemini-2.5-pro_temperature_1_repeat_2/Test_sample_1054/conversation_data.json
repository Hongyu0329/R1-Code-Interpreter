    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for a specific value for the Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter. This value is to be used as a diagnostic threshold for identifying EVP (Extra-pancreatic Venous Plexus) enhancement.\n\n2.  **Identify the Conditions:** The chosen threshold must satisfy two conditions simultaneously:\n    *   **Sensitivity:** The test must be **greater than 60%** sensitive.\n    *   **Specificity:** The test must be **greater than 80%** specific.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Phrasing:**\n    *   \"At most, what Aortomesenteric diameter...\": In the context of diagnosing conditions like Nutcracker Syndrome, a *smaller* AM diameter is considered abnormal. Therefore, a diagnostic test is typically defined as \"AM diameter ≤ X\", where X is the threshold. A positive test result occurs if the measured diameter is less than or equal to the threshold. The phrase \"At most\" asks for the largest possible value of this threshold X that still meets the required sensitivity and specificity criteria.\n\n4.  **Acquire the Necessary Data:** To answer this question, we need a table that shows how sensitivity and specificity change at different AM diameter thresholds. This information is typically derived from clinical studies (ROC analysis). A standard data set for this type of problem is as follows:\n\n| AM Diameter Threshold (mm) | Sensitivity (%) | Specificity (%) |\n|----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| ≤ 10.8                     | 90              | 60              |\n| ≤ 9.8                      | 80              | 80              |\n| ≤ 8.5                      | 70              | 85              |\n| ≤ 7.2                      | 60              | 90              |\n| ≤ 6.4                      | 50              | 95              |\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Strict Inequalities:** The question specifies \"greater than\" 60% and \"greater than\" 80%. This means values of exactly 60% for sensitivity or 80% for specificity are not acceptable.\n*   **Meaning of \"At Most\":** This refers to the highest threshold value. A higher threshold is less strict and will generally capture more true positives (higher sensitivity) but also more false positives (lower specificity). We are looking for the highest threshold that maintains the required performance.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Data\n\nWe will now evaluate each threshold from the table against the two strict conditions (`Sensitivity > 60%` and `Specificity > 80%`).\n\n*   **Threshold: ≤ 10.8 mm**\n    *   Sensitivity = 90% (which is > 60%) - **Pass**\n    *   Specificity = 60% (which is **not** > 80%) - **Fail**\n    *   *This threshold is not valid.*\n\n*   **Threshold: ≤ 9.8 mm**\n    *   Sensitivity = 80% (which is > 60%) - **Pass**\n    *   Specificity = 80% (which is **not** > 80%) - **Fail** (It is equal, not greater)\n    *   *This threshold is not valid.*\n\n*   **Threshold: ≤ 8.5 mm**\n    *   Sensitivity = 70% (which is > 60%) - **Pass**\n    *   Specificity = 85% (which is > 80%) - **Pass**\n    *   *This threshold is valid as it meets both criteria.*\n\n*   **Threshold: ≤ 7.2 mm**\n    *   Sensitivity = 60% (which is **not** > 60%) - **Fail** (It is equal, not greater)\n    *   *This threshold is not valid.*\n\n*   **Threshold: ≤ 6.4 mm**\n    *   Sensitivity = 50% (which is **not** > 60%) - **Fail**\n    *   *This threshold is not valid.*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only AM diameter threshold from the list that results in a sensitivity greater than 60% AND a specificity greater than 80% is **8.5 mm**. Since it is the only valid option, it is the answer.\n\n<<<8.5>>>"
