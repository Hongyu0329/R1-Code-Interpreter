The appropriate management for this patient must be phased, prioritizing her systemic health.

**Phase 1: Immediate/Emergency Management**
1.  **Urgent Medical Referral:** The patient must be immediately referred to a physician to begin treatment for her uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c of 7.5%). No definitive dental work should proceed until her condition is stabilized.
2.  **Dental Trauma Management:**
    *   **Wound Care:** The avulsed tooth sockets must be gently debrided and irrigated with a sterile or antimicrobial solution.
    *   **Radiographic Assessment:** A panoramic radiograph and periapical x-rays are necessary to rule out alveolar bone fractures and damage to adjacent teeth.
    *   **Infection Control:** A course of broad-spectrum antibiotics is mandatory due to the patient's compromised immune status, the nature of the trauma, and the 28-hour delay.
    *   **Pain Control:** Prescription of appropriate analgesics.
    *   **Interim Prosthesis:** An interim removable partial denture (an "acrylic flipper") should be fabricated for aesthetics and space maintenance during the healing period.

**Cells of Interest**
The key cells of interest are those critical to wound healing and immune defense, whose function is compromised by hyperglycemia:
*   **Neutrophils and Macrophages:** Their reduced ability to fight bacteria significantly increases the risk of infection in the wound site.
*   **Fibroblasts:** Impaired function leads to delayed and poor-quality healing of the gum tissue and sockets.
*   **Osteoblasts:** Reduced activity can result in slower and less complete bone healing within the sockets.

**Phase 2: Definitive Prosthetic Replacement (after medical stabilization)**

Given the patient's complex medical history, the Class III skeletal pattern, and the long edentulous span, the most appropriate definitive replacement is a removable partial denture.

*   **Kind of Denture:** A **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**. This design provides superior strength, stability, and hygiene compared to an all-acrylic denture.
*   **Material:**
    *   **Framework:** **Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy**.
    *   **Denture Base and Teeth:** **Acrylic Resin**.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
    *   **Primary Abutments:** The teeth adjacent to the space, the **left second premolar** and the **left central incisor**, will be used for direct support and retention via rests and clasps.
    *   **Secondary Abutments:** To ensure stability and prevent rotational forces, **cross-arch stabilization** is essential. Rests and clasps will also be placed on teeth on the contralateral (right) side, such as the **right canine and right first premolar**. This design distributes biting forces across the entire arch, protecting the abutment teeth and providing a stable, functional prosthesis.
