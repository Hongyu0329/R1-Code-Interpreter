    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Structure of the Flag of Tonga**\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of two main parts:\n*   A red field, which forms the main background of the flag.\n*   A white canton (a rectangle in the top-left corner, also known as the upper hoist).\nInside the white canton, there is a red \"couped cross\". A couped cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the canton it is in.\n\n**2. Model the Flag as a Matrix**\n\nLet's represent the flag as a matrix `M`. According to the problem, every red pixel has a value of `a`, and every white pixel has a value of `b`.\n\nWe can visualize the matrix `M` as a block matrix. Let's assume the image has a resolution of `m` pixels high and `n` pixels wide.\n\nThe flag can be partitioned into four main rectangular regions:\n1.  The top-left canton.\n2.  The red area to the right of the canton.\n3.  The red area below the canton.\n4.  The red area below and to the right of the canton.\n\nThe canton itself has a specific structure: a white background with a red cross. The cross consists of a central vertical bar and a central horizontal bar. This divides the canton into a 3x3 grid of regions.\n\nLet's represent the values in these regions:\n*   In the canton:\n    *   The four corner regions are white (`b`).\n    *   The central vertical and horizontal bars (the cross) are red (`a`).\n    *   The center square of this 3x3 grid is also red (`a`).\n*   Everywhere outside the canton, the flag is red (`a`).\n\n**3. Identify the Unique Row Vectors in the Matrix**\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's examine the structure of the rows of matrix `M`.\n\n*   **Type 1 Row:** Any row that passes through the main red field (below the canton) or through the horizontal bar of the red cross in the canton will consist *entirely* of the value `a`.\n    *   Let's call this row vector `v_R = (a, a, a, ..., a)`. All rows of this type are identical.\n\n*   **Type 2 Row:** Any row that passes through the upper or lower parts of the canton (i.e., the white areas above and below the horizontal bar of the cross) will have a different structure. Such a row will pass through:\n    1.  A white section of the canton (`b`).\n    2.  The vertical red bar of the cross (`a`).\n    3.  Another white section of the canton (`b`).\n    4.  The main red field to the right of the canton (`a`).\n    *   Let's call this row vector `v_W = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`. All rows of this type are identical to each other.\n\nSince every single row in the matrix `M` must be of either `Type 1` or `Type 2`, the entire row space of the matrix `M` is spanned by these two vectors, `v_R` and `v_W`.\n\n**4. Determine the Rank**\n\nThe rank of `M` is the dimension of the vector space spanned by `{v_R, v_W}`. The dimension of this space can be at most 2.\n\nThe rank will be less than 2 if and only if the two vectors are linearly dependent. This occurs if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other, or if one (or both) of them is the zero vector.\n\n*   **Case A: The vectors are linearly dependent.**\n    *   If `v_R` and `v_W` are linearly dependent, one must be a multiple of the other. Let's assume `v_W = k * v_R` for some scalar `k`.\n    *   `v_R` is a constant vector: `(a, a, ..., a)`.\n    *   `v_W = k * (a, a, ..., a) = (ka, ka, ..., ka)`.\n    *   This implies that all entries in `v_W` must be identical. However, `v_W` contains both `a`'s and `b`'s. For its entries to be identical, we must have `a = b`. If `a=b`, then `v_W` becomes `(a, a, ..., a)`, which is identical to `v_R`. In this scenario, the two vectors are the same, and the rank of the matrix is 1 (assuming `a=b≠0`).\n    *   Another possibility for linear dependence is if one vector is the zero vector. If `a = 0`, then `v_R = (0, 0, ..., 0)` is the zero vector. In this case, `v_W` will consist of `b`'s and `0`'s. As long as `b ≠ 0`, `v_W` is not the zero vector. The set `{v_W, 0}` is linearly dependent, and the rank is 1.\n\n*   **Case B: The vectors are linearly independent.**\n    *   `v_R` and `v_W` will be linearly independent if they are not linearly dependent. From the analysis above, this happens if `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`.\n\n**5. Find the Maximal Possible Rank**\n\nThe question asks for the *maximal possible* rank. We are free to choose the values of `a` and `b` to maximize the rank.\n\nTo achieve the maximum rank, we need `v_R` and `v_W` to be linearly independent. This requires `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`.\n\nLet's pick values that satisfy these conditions, for example, `a = 1` and `b = 0`.\n*   `v_R = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`\n*   `v_W = (0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)`\n\nThese two vectors are clearly linearly independent. `v_R` has no zero elements, while `v_W` does, so neither can be a non-zero scalar multiple of the other. Thus, the dimension of the space they span is 2. The rank of the matrix `M` is 2.\n\nSince we have shown that the rank can be 2, and that the rank cannot exceed 2 (as the row space is spanned by only two vectors), the maximal possible rank is 2.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Flag Geometry:** The analysis relies on a correct interpretation of the flag's design. The \"couped cross\" is key, as it ensures the existence of the white corner regions within the canton, leading to the `v_W` vector having distinct `a` and `b` values.\n*   **Non-degenerate Dimensions:** We assume the image resolution is large enough for all distinct regions of the flag to exist (i.e., have at least one pixel). For example, the horizontal and vertical bars of the cross must have a non-zero thickness. This is a reasonable assumption for \"an image of the flag\".\n*   **Choice of `a` and `b`:** The problem asks for the maximal rank, implying we can choose `a` and `b`. The rank depends on the relationship between `a` and `b`. To maximize it, we choose values that ensure linear independence.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe matrix representing the flag of Tonga has rows of only two distinct types. Therefore, its row space is at most two-dimensional. By choosing `a` and `b` appropriately (e.g., `a=1, b=0`, which corresponds to `a≠b` and `a≠0`), we can ensure these two types of rows are linearly independent. This results in a rank of 2. Therefore, the maximal possible rank is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
