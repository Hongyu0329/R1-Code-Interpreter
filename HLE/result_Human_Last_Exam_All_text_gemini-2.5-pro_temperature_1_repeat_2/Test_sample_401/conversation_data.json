    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** The question specifies a \"not necessarily metric\" continuum. In general topology, a continuum is defined as a **compact, connected, Hausdorff space**. If it is also metric, it's called a metric continuum.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. That is, if $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are both subcontinua of $X$, then it must be that either $A = X$ or $B = X$. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to the whole space.\n*   **Composant:** For a given point $p$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $p$, denoted $C(p)$, is the set of all points $q$ in $X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ that contains both $p$ and $q$.\n\n**2. Establish a Lower Bound on the Number of Composants**\n\n*   **Property 1: Composants partition the space.** The relation \"being in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation on an indecomposable continuum $X$.\n    *   *Reflexivity*: Any point $p$ is in its own composant $C(p)$ (since $\\{p\\}$ is a proper subcontinuum, assuming $X$ is not a single point).\n    *   *Symmetry*: If $q \\in C(p)$, there is a proper subcontinuum $K$ containing $p$ and $q$. This same $K$ shows that $p \\in C(q)$.\n    *   *Transitivity*: If $q \\in C(p)$ and $r \\in C(q)$, there are proper subcontinua $K_1$ (containing $p, q$) and $K_2$ (containing $q, r$). The union $K_1 \\cup K_2$ is a continuum containing $p$ and $r$. Because $X$ is indecomposable and $K_1, K_2$ are proper, their union $K_1 \\cup K_2$ must also be a proper subcontinuum of $X$. Thus, $r \\in C(p)$.\n    *   This means the set of all composants forms a partition of $X$. Therefore, there is at least one composant.\n\n*   **Property 2: An indecomposable continuum has at least two composants.**\n    *   A fundamental theorem of continuum theory states that a continuum $X$ is indecomposable if and only if there exist two points, say $a$ and $b$, in $X$ such that $X$ is *irreducible* between $a$ and $b$.\n    *   \"Irreducible between $a$ and $b$\" means that no proper subcontinuum of $X$ contains both $a$ and $b$.\n    *   Looking at the definition of a composant, this is precisely the statement that the point $b$ is *not* in the composant of point $a$. That is, $b \\notin C(a)$.\n    *   Since $b$ must belong to some composant (namely $C(b)$) and the composants partition $X$, it follows that $C(a)$ and $C(b)$ are distinct and disjoint.\n    *   Therefore, any indecomposable continuum must have at least two composants. The number of composants is strictly greater than 1.\n\n**3. Determine the Smallest Possible Number of Composants**\n\nWe have established a lower bound of 2. The question now is whether 2 is achievable.\n\n*   **A Potential Pitfall: The Metric Case.** If we were restricted to *metric* continua, there is a famous result based on the Baire Category Theorem. In short:\n    1.  Every metric continuum is a Baire space (it's not \"meager\" or \"of the first category\").\n    2.  In an indecomposable metric continuum, every composant can be shown to be a \"meager\" set (a countable union of nowhere-dense sets).\n    3.  If there were only a countable number of composants, the entire space would be a countable union of meager sets, which is itself meager.\n    4.  This would contradict the fact that the space is a Baire space.\n    5.  Therefore, any indecomposable *metric* continuum must have an *uncountable* number of composants.\n\n*   **The Crucial \"Not Necessarily Metric\" Clause.** The Baire category argument fails for general non-metric continua. The proof that a composant is meager relies on the space being separable (having a countable dense subset), which is true for metric spaces but not for all compact Hausdorff spaces. The \"not necessarily metric\" part of the question is key; it allows us to sidestep the conclusion that the number must be uncountable.\n\n*   **The Existence Theorem.** The final step is to determine if a continuum with exactly 2 composants can exist. The answer is yes. A major result in the field, by J. Krasinkiewicz and P. Minc (1977), demonstrates this.\n    *   **Theorem (Krasinkiewicz-Minc):** For any integer $n \\geq 2$, there exists an indecomposable continuum in the plane (which is a metric space) that has exactly $n$ composants.\n\n*   **Conclusion.** Since the number of composants must be an integer greater than 1, and the Krasinkiewicz-Minc theorem shows that a continuum with 2 composants exists, the smallest possible number is 2. The example provided by the theorem is metric, but it is still a valid example in the more general \"not necessarily metric\" context.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The number of composants in an indecomposable continuum must be greater than 1. So the minimum is at least 2.\n2.  The existence of an indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants has been proven.\n3.  Therefore, the smallest possible number of composants is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
