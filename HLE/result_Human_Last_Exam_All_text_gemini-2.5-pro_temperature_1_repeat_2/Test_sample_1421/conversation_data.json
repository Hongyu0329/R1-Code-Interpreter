    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Starting Point: The Definition of the Partition Function**\n    In quantum statistical mechanics, the canonical partition function (Z) is the trace of the statistical operator, $e^{-\\beta H}$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature and $H$ is the Hamiltonian of the system.\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H})$\n\n2.  **Introducing Imaginary Time and the Path Integral**\n    The path integral formalism is a way to calculate quantum mechanical amplitudes. To apply it to statistical mechanics, we perform a Wick rotation, replacing real time $t$ with imaginary time $\\tau = it$. This transforms the quantum time evolution operator $e^{-iHt/\\hbar}$ into the statistical operator $e^{-\\beta H}$ by setting $\\beta = \\tau/\\hbar$ (we often set $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity). The idea is to break the imaginary time interval $[0, \\beta]$ into N infinitesimally small slices, each of duration $\\epsilon = \\beta/N$. We then insert a complete set of states between each slice and take the limit as $N \\to \\infty$.\n\n3.  **The Challenge with Fermions: Anticommutation**\n    Fermions are particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Their creation ($c^\\dagger$) and annihilation ($c$) operators satisfy anticommutation relations:\n    $\\{c_i, c_j\\} = c_i c_j + c_j c_i = 0$\n    $\\{c_i^\\dagger, c_j^\\dagger\\} = c_i^\\dagger c_j^\\dagger + c_j^\\dagger c_i^\\dagger = 0$\n    $\\{c_i, c_j^\\dagger\\} = c_i c_j^\\dagger + c_j^\\dagger c_i = \\delta_{ij}$\n    Because of this, we cannot represent the fermionic fields with ordinary commuting numbers (c-numbers) as we do for bosons.\n\n4.  **Solution: Grassmann Numbers**\n    To correctly handle the anticommuting nature of fermions, the path integral is formulated using **Grassmann numbers** (also called anticommuting numbers). These are mathematical objects, let's call them $\\psi$ and $\\psi^*$, that satisfy:\n    $\\psi_i \\psi_j = -\\psi_j \\psi_i$\n    This property naturally encodes the Pauli principle (e.g., $(\\psi_i)^2 = 0$). The path integral becomes a functional integral over fields whose values are Grassmann numbers.\n\n5.  **Constructing the Action**\n    The path integral is expressed as an integral over all possible field configurations, weighted by the exponential of a quantity called the Euclidean action, $S$.\n    $Z = \\int D[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\n    The action $S$ is obtained by integrating the Euclidean Lagrangian, $L_E$, over the imaginary time interval:\n    $S[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, L_E$\n    The Euclidean Lagrangian for a fermionic system is derived from the Hamiltonian and has a generic form:\n    $L_E = \\psi^*(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi(\\tau) + H(\\psi^*(\\tau), \\psi(\\tau))$\n    Here, $H(\\psi^*, \\psi)$ is the original Hamiltonian of the system, but with the creation operators ($c^\\dagger$) replaced by the Grassmann field $\\psi^*$ and the annihilation operators ($c$) replaced by the Grassmann field $\\psi$. The term $\\psi^* \\partial_\\tau \\psi$ arises from the time-slicing procedure.\n\n6.  **The Crucial Boundary Condition**\n    The trace operation, $\\text{Tr}(\\cdot) = \\sum_n \\langle n | \\cdot | n \\rangle$, imposes a specific boundary condition on the fields in the imaginary time direction. For fermions, due to their anticommuting nature, this results in **anti-periodic boundary conditions**.\n    $\\psi(\\tau = \\beta) = -\\psi(\\tau = 0)$\n    $\\psi^*(\\tau = \\beta) = -\\psi^*(\\tau = 0)$\n    This is a fundamental difference from the bosonic case, where the boundary conditions are periodic.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Grassmann Fields:** The core of the formalism is the use of anticommuting Grassmann numbers ($\\psi, \\psi^*$) to represent the fermionic fields. These are not classical, real, or complex number fields.\n2.  **Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions:** The trace in the partition function requires that the fermionic fields are anti-periodic over the imaginary time interval $[0, \\beta]$. This is a direct consequence of Fermi-Dirac statistics.\n3.  **Functional Integral:** The integral symbol $\\int D[\\psi^*, \\psi]$ represents a functional integral (or path integral), which is a sum over all possible functions (paths) $\\psi(\\tau)$ that satisfy the anti-periodic boundary conditions.\n4.  **Euclidean Action:** The exponent contains the negative of the Euclidean action $S$, not the classical action. The action includes both the Hamiltonian term $H(\\psi^*, \\psi)$ and a kinetic term involving the imaginary time derivative, $\\psi^* \\partial_\\tau \\psi$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields, $\\psi(\\tau)$ and $\\psi^*(\\tau)$.\n\nThe formula is:\n$Z = \\int D[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\exp\\left( -S[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\right)$\n\nwhere the Euclidean action $S[\\psi^*, \\psi]$ is:\n$S[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\psi^*(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi(\\tau) + H(\\psi^*(\\tau), \\psi(\\tau)) \\right]$\n\nThis integral is performed over all field configurations that satisfy the **anti-periodic boundary conditions**:\n$\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)$\n$\\psi^*(\\beta) = -\\psi^*(0)$\n\nIn this formula:\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.\n*   $\\psi(\\tau)$ and $\\psi^*(\\tau)$ are Grassmann-valued fields.\n*   $D[\\psi^*, \\psi]$ is the functional integration measure.\n*   $H(\\psi^*, \\psi)$ is the system's Hamiltonian with annihilation/creation operators replaced by the corresponding Grassmann fields.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is $Z = \\int D[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\exp\\left( -\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\psi^*(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi(\\tau) + H(\\psi^*(\\tau), \\psi(\\tau)) \\right] \\right)$, subject to the anti-periodic boundary conditions $\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)$ and $\\psi^*(\\beta) = -\\psi^*(0)$.>>>"
