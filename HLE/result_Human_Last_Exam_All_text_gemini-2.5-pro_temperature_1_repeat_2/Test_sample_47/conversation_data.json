    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (random letters drawn) until a specific sequence appears. This is a classic problem in applied probability that can be solved elegantly using the concept of overlapping substrings within the target sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core principle**\n\nLet `E` be the expected number of letters we need to draw to see the target sequence `S`. A powerful formula for this type of problem is:\n\n`E = Sum over all k from 1 to L of (A^k)`\n\nwhere the sum is only taken for values of `k` that satisfy a specific overlap condition.\n*   `L` is the length of the target sequence `S`.\n*   `A` is the size of the alphabet (the number of possible outcomes for each draw).\n*   The **overlap condition** is that the prefix of `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\nThe intuition behind this formula comes from a thought experiment involving gamblers. For every successful overlap, it's as if the process \"rewards\" itself, increasing the total expected waiting time. If there are no overlaps (except for the full sequence itself), the expected time is simply `A^L`.\n\n**Step 2: Define the parameters for our problem**\n\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** `TENETENET`\n*   **Length of Sequence (L):** 9\n*   **Alphabet Size (A):** 26 (since we are drawing from the English alphabet)\n\nOur goal is to find all values of `k` (from 1 to 9) where the prefix of `TENETENET` of length `k` matches the suffix of `TENETENET` of length `k`.\n\n**Step 3: List all careful points by identifying the overlaps**\n\nWe will systematically check the prefix and suffix for each possible length `k` from 1 to 9.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix(1): `T`\n    *   Suffix(1): `T`\n    *   Result: **Match**\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix(2): `TE`\n    *   Suffix(2): `ET`\n    *   Result: No Match\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix(3): `TEN`\n    *   Suffix(3): `NET`\n    *   Result: No Match\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix(4): `TENE`\n    *   Suffix(4): `ENET`\n    *   Result: No Match\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix(5): `TENET`\n    *   Suffix(5): `TENET`\n    *   Result: **Match**\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix(6): `TENETE`\n    *   Suffix(6): `ETENET`\n    *   Result: No Match\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix(7): `TENETEN`\n    *   Suffix(7): `NETENET`\n    *   Result: No Match\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix(8): `TENETENE`\n    *   Suffix(8): `TENETENE`\n    *   Result: **Match**\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix(9): `TENETENET`\n    *   Suffix(9): `TENETENET`\n    *   Result: **Match** (The full sequence always matches itself).\n\nSo, the values of `k` that satisfy the overlap condition are 1, 5, 8, and 9.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the expected time (E)**\n\nNow we apply the formula by summing `26^k` for `k = 1, 5, 8, 9`.\n\n`E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^8 + 26^9`\n\nLet's compute each term:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^8 = 208,827,064,576`\n*   `26^9 = 26^8 * 26 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nNow, we sum these values:\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 208,827,064,576 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n\n   `5,429,503,678,976`\n`+  208,827,064,576`\n`+           11,881,376`\n`+                   26`\n`-------------------------`\n   `5,638,342,624,954`\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,638,342,624,954 draws.\n\n<<<5638342624954>>>"
