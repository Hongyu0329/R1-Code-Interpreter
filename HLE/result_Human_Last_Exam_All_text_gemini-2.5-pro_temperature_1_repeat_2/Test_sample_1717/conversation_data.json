    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Base Health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode\nFirst, we need to find the starting health value for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player, before any multiplayer scaling is applied. According to the game's data, this base health is **3,640 HP**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Health Scaling Mechanism in Expert Mode\nIn Terraria, boss health increases in multiplayer to provide a challenge for multiple players. The scaling formula is different for each difficulty mode. For Expert Mode, the health is increased by a specific percentage for each additional player.\n\nThe formula as derived from the source code is:\n`Total Health = Base Health × (1 + 0.35 × (Number of Players - 1))`\n\nLet's break down this formula:\n*   **Base Health**: 3,640 HP, as determined in Step 1.\n*   **Number of Players (N)**: The total number of players in the world.\n*   **(Number of Players - 1)**: The scaling is applied for each player *after the first*.\n*   **0.35**: This represents a **35%** increase in base health for each additional player.\n\nSo, the health of the Eye of Cthulhu for `N` players is `3640 × (1 + 0.35 × (N - 1))`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the \"Infinite Number of Players\" Condition\nThe question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. We must analyze what happens to the formula as the `Number of Players (N)` approaches infinity (`N → ∞`).\n\nLet's look at the health formula again:\n`Total Health = 3640 × (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)`\n`Total Health = 3640 × (0.65 + 0.35N)`\n\nAs `N` becomes infinitely large, the term `0.35N` also becomes infinitely large. This means the `Total Health` calculated by this formula would also approach infinity.\n\n### Step 4: Consider the Limitations of the Game's Source Code\nThis is the most critical point. The question specifies \"According to the source code\". This implies we must consider the technical limitations of the game engine, not just the abstract mathematical formula.\n\nIn the source code of Terraria (which is written in C#), the health of an NPC (Non-Player Character), including bosses, is stored in a variable named `lifeMax`. This variable is a **32-bit signed integer** (commonly known as an `int`).\n\nA 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value. Any attempt to store a number larger than this value will result in an overflow or be clamped to this maximum limit. This hard limit imposed by the data type represents the true \"theoretical maximum\" health an entity can have within the game's engine.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Final Maximum Health Value\nThe maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is **2,147,483,647**.\n\nSince the health scaling formula increases without bound as the number of players increases, with an infinite number of players, the calculated health would far exceed this limit. Therefore, the health of the Eye of Cthulhu would be capped at the maximum value that the `int` data type can hold.\n\n### Conclusion\n1.  **Base Health**: 3,640 (Expert Mode)\n2.  **Scaling**: +35% of base health for each player after the first.\n3.  **Formula**: `Health = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N-1))`\n4.  **Infinite Players**: As N → ∞, the formula's result → ∞.\n5.  **Source Code Limitation**: The `lifeMax` variable is a 32-bit signed integer, which has a maximum value.\n6.  **Final Answer**: The maximum health is capped at `int.MaxValue`.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
