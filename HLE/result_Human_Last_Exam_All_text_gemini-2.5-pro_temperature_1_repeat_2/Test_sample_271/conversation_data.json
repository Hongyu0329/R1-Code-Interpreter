    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze and factor the polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We look for common factors among groups of terms.\nNotice that we can group terms as follows:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\nFactor out common terms from each group:\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nNow, we can factor out the common binomial $(x^2 - 2)$:\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the smallest field containing all roots of both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of each factor over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\n*   **For $g(x) = x^2 - 2$**:\n    The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g / \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n*   **For $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$**:\n    1.  **Irreducibility**: We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3. All other coefficients (0 for $x^4$, 0 for $x^2$, -9 for $x$, 3 for the constant) are divisible by 3. The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$. Thus, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    2.  **Number of real roots**: We analyze the derivative $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are at $x^4 = 9/5$, which gives two real roots $x = \\pm (9/5)^{1/4}$.\n        *   Local maximum at $x = -(9/5)^{1/4}$: $h(-(9/5)^{1/4}) > 0$.\n        *   Local minimum at $x = (9/5)^{1/4}$: $h((9/5)^{1/4}) < 0$.\n        Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $h(x)$ must have exactly three real roots. The other two roots are a complex conjugate pair.\n    3.  **Galois Group**: An irreducible quintic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly three real roots has the symmetric group $S_5$ as its Galois group. Let $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$. Then $\\text{Gal}(K_h / \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the splitting field $K$**\n\nThe splitting field of $f(x)$ is the compositum $K = K_g K_h$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the direct product $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$. The group $G$ is isomorphic to the direct product if the intersection of the fields is trivial, i.e., $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe field $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a quadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. The field $K_h$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, where $\\Delta$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\nThe formula for the discriminant of $x^n + ax + b$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} (n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1} a^n)$.\nFor $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$\\Delta = (-1)^{10} (5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 1 \\cdot (3125 \\cdot 81 + 256 \\cdot (-59049)) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14,863,419$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. This is an imaginary quadratic field, since $\\Delta < 0$.\nThe field $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field.\nSince one field is real and the other is imaginary, they cannot be equal. Thus, their intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis means the Galois group of the composite field $K$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of $G$ is $|G| = |C_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the degrees of normal intermediate extensions**\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, a normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ corresponds to a normal subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\\{e\\} \\neq H \\neq G$.\nThe degree of the extension is given by $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$ and their indices.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$ (the alternating group), and $S_5$.\n\n1.  **Subgroups of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$**: Where $N_1 \\triangleleft C_2$ and $N_2 \\triangleleft S_5$.\n    *   $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_1|=2$. Index $[G:H_1] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|H_2|=60$. Index $[G:H_2] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_3 = C_2 \\times A_5$: $|H_3|=2 \\cdot 60 = 120$. Index $[G:H_3] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_4 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|H_4|=120$. Index $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **\"Skew\" normal subgroups**: These can exist when the two groups in the direct product have a common non-trivial quotient group. Here, $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$ and $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. They share the common quotient $C_2$.\n    This gives rise to another normal subgroup. Consider the homomorphism $\\phi: C_2 \\times S_5 \\to C_2$ defined by $\\phi(c, \\sigma) = c \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$, where we identify $C_2$ with the multiplicative group $\\{1, -1\\}$ and $\\text{sgn}$ is the sign homomorphism.\n    The kernel of $\\phi$, let's call it $H_5$, is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n    $H_5 = \\{(c, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid c \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = 1\\}$. This means either $c=1$ and $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)=1$ (i.e., $\\sigma \\in A_5$), or $c=-1$ and $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)=-1$ (i.e., $\\sigma \\notin A_5$).\n    $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    The index of this subgroup is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe indices of all proper non-trivial normal subgroups are {120, 4, 2}. These are the possible degrees for the normal intermediate field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe list of possible degrees is therefore 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
