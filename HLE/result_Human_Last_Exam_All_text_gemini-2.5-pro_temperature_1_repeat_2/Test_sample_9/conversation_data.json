    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the topological space X**\n\nThe space $X$ is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n*   A **lattice** $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis of two linearly independent vectors, $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, so that $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$.\n*   Such a basis can be represented by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M = [v_1 | v_2]$, where $v_1, v_2$ are column vectors. The condition that they are linearly independent means $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   The **area** of the lattice (more precisely, the area of its fundamental parallelogram) is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The condition of **unit area** means $|\\det(M)|=1$. Let $Y = \\{M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(M)| = 1\\}$. This space $Y$ is the disjoint union of two components: $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (where $\\det(M)=1$) and the set of matrices with determinant -1.\n*   The **moduli space** aspect means we identify lattices that are identical as subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Two bases, represented by matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$, generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by a change of basis matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $M_2 = M_1 A$.\n*   Therefore, the space $X$ is the quotient space of bases with unit area by this equivalence relation:\n    $X = Y / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\{M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(M)|=1\\} / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Find a more familiar description of X**\n\nWe can simplify the description of this quotient space.\n\n*   Consider the map $\\phi: SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to X$ given by taking the equivalence class of a matrix in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$: $\\phi(M) = [M]_{GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})}$.\n*   **Surjectivity of $\\phi$**: Let $[N] \\in X$ be an orbit represented by a matrix $N \\in Y$. If $\\det(N)=1$, then $N \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and $[N]$ is in the image of $\\phi$. If $\\det(N)=-1$, we can choose a matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ with $\\det(A)=-1$ (for example, $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$). Then the matrix $N' = NA$ represents the same lattice, so $[N']=[N]$. But $\\det(N') = \\det(N)\\det(A) = (-1)(-1) = 1$, so $N' \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Thus, every orbit has a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, and the map $\\phi$ is surjective.\n*   **Fibers of $\\phi$**: Let's determine when two matrices $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ map to the same point in $X$. This occurs if $[M_1]_{GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})} = [M_2]_{GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})}$, which means there exists an $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ such that $M_2 = M_1 A$. Taking the determinant of both sides, we get $\\det(M_2) = \\det(M_1)\\det(A)$. Since $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, this becomes $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(A)$, which implies $\\det(A)=1$. So, the change-of-basis matrix $A$ must be in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   This means that two elements in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ map to the same point in $X$ if and only if they are in the same coset of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   Therefore, we have a homeomorphism: $X \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the first homology group, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$**\n\nThe first homology group with integer coefficients is the abelianization of the fundamental group: $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(X)_{ab}$. We need to find $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\n*   The projection $p: SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to X = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a fibration with fiber $\\Gamma = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   We use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for this fibration:\n    $\\dots \\to \\pi_1(\\Gamma) \\to \\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_0(\\Gamma) \\to \\pi_0(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\to \\dots$\n*   Let's identify the terms in this sequence:\n    *   $\\Gamma = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a discrete group, so its fundamental group (based at the identity) is trivial: $\\pi_1(\\Gamma) = \\{e\\}$.\n    *   $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is homeomorphic to $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$, so its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_0(\\Gamma)$ is the set of path components of $\\Gamma$, which is just $\\Gamma$ itself (as a set). The sequence is one of groups, so this term is the group $\\Gamma = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is path-connected, so $\\pi_0(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) = \\{e\\}$.\n*   Substituting these into the long exact sequence, we get:\n    $\\dots \\to \\{e\\} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\{e\\} \\to \\dots$\n*   This gives a short exact sequence of groups:\n    $1 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$.\n    This means $\\pi_1(X)$ is a central extension of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   Now we compute the abelianization, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(X)_{ab}$. For a group extension as above, there is a corresponding five-term exact sequence in group homology:\n    $H_2(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(\\pi_1(X), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_0(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    This simplifies to:\n    $H_2(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(X) \\to H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})) \\to 0$.\n*   It is a known result from the theory of group cohomology that $H_2(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n*   We need to compute $H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$, which is the abelianization of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The group $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ with relations $S^4=I$ and $(ST)^3=S^2(=-I)$. In the abelianization, the generators commute, so the relation $(ST)^3=S^2$ becomes $S^3T^3=S^2$, which simplifies to $ST^3=I$. From this, $S=T^{-3}$. Substituting into $S^4=I$, we get $(T^{-3})^4=I$, which is $T^{-12}=I$, or $T^{12}=I$. The abelianization is generated by the image of $T$ and is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 12. So, $H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n*   The exact sequence becomes:\n    $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$**\n\nWe have a short exact sequence of abelian groups: $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to A \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to 0$, where $A = H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n*   The group $\\pi_1(X)$ is an extension of a finitely generated group ($SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$) by a finitely generated group ($\\mathbb{Z}$), so it is finitely generated. Its abelianization, $A = H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is also a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   By the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, $A$ can be written as $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T$, where $r$ is its rank (the number of $\\mathbb{Z}$ factors) and $T$ is its torsion subgroup.\n*   We can determine the rank by tensoring the short exact sequence with $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n    $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to 0$.\n    Since $\\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = 0$, this gives $\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    $\\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\mathbb{Q}^r$. Thus, the rank is $r=1$.\n*   We can determine the torsion subgroup $T$ by considering the long exact sequence for the `Tor` functor, or more simply: The torsion subgroup of $A$, let's call it $T(A)$, must map into the torsion subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ itself. Any torsion element of $A$ has to map to a torsion element. Conversely, let $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. Since the map $p: A \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ is surjective, there exists $x \\in A$ with $p(x)=y$. Then $p(12x) = 12y=0$, so $12x \\in \\ker(p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is torsion-free, if $12x \\ne 0$, $x$ cannot be a torsion element. However, the short exact sequence $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to A \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to 0$ splits for the torsion parts, giving $T(A) \\cong T(\\mathbb{Z}_{12}) = \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n*   Combining the results, the finitely generated abelian group $A$ has rank 1 and torsion subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. Therefore, its structure is $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n\nFinal answer is the first homology group of X with integer coefficients.\n\n>>> $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$"
