    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject and Anatomical Feature:**\n    *   **Subject:** The dinosaur species *Irritator challengeri*. This is a spinosaurid theropod known primarily from a well-preserved skull (holotype specimen SMNS 58022).\n    *   **Anatomical Feature:** The \"lacrimal recess\". The lacrimal is a skull bone situated in front of the eye socket (orbit). A recess is a depression or hollow area on a bone. In dinosaurs, the lacrimal often bears a depression that is part of a larger opening in front of the eye called the antorbital fenestra. The depression on the lacrimal bone itself is referred to as the lacrimal recess or the lacrimal fossa.\n\n2.  **Consult Primary Scientific Sources:**\n    *   To answer such a specific anatomical question, we must refer to the primary scientific literature that describes the skull of *Irritator challengeri*.\n    *   The most comprehensive and authoritative source is the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, titled \"The skull of the spinosaurid dinosaur *Irritator challengeri* (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\" This paper provides a detailed re-description of the holotype skull.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Description:**\n    *   Within the Sues et al. (2002) paper, we need to find the section describing the lacrimal bone.\n    *   In their description of the lacrimal, the authors detail the features on its external (lateral) surface. They describe a large fossa (a synonym for recess or depression) that is part of the larger antorbital fossa.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Recess:**\n    *   The paper states the following about this feature: \"The lateral surface of the ventral process of the lacrimal is deeply excavated by the antorbital fossa. This fossa is, in turn, subdivided by a thin, diagonally oriented ridge into a smaller, anterodorsal and a larger, posteroventral recess.\"\n\n5.  **Interpret the Findings and Count the Depressions:**\n    *   The description is very clear. The main depression, referred to as the fossa, is not a single, simple hollow.\n    *   It is \"subdivided\" by a ridge.\n    *   It is subdivided into two distinct parts:\n        1.  A smaller, anterodorsal recess (located towards the front and top).\n        2.  A larger, posteroventral recess (located towards the back and bottom).\n    *   Therefore, the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains a total of two depressions.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Terminology:** The terms \"recess,\" \"fossa,\" and \"depression\" are often used interchangeably in paleontological descriptions. The key is to understand that the question refers to the distinct hollows on the lacrimal bone.\n*   **Source Reliability:** Relying on the primary scientific description of the specific fossil is crucial for accuracy. General dinosaur books or websites may not have this level of anatomical detail.\n*   **Interpretation:** The question \"how many depressions does the lacrimal recess... contain?\" implies looking for subdivisions within the main feature, rather than counting the main feature as one. The Sues et al. (2002) description directly addresses this by noting the subdivision into two recesses.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the primary scientific literature, the final answer can be determined.\n\n<<<2>>>"
