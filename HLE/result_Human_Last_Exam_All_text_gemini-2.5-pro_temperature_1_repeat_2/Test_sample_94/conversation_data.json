    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe question asks for the identity of a specific physicist. We can break down the query into several key pieces of information that act as clues:\n1.  **Profession:** The person is a physicist.\n2.  **Primary Field:** They are \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\"\n3.  **Discovery:** They discovered an \"optical effect in real imagery.\"\n4.  **Origin of Discovery:** The effect was first \"accidentally observed by a custodial worker.\"\n5.  **Context of Observation:** The observation happened while the worker was \"cleaning concave mirrors.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   The person must be a physicist, not just an inventor or naturalist.\n*   Their main contribution or fame should be related to microscopes. This could include optical, electron, or X-ray microscopy.\n*   The story of the accidental discovery by a custodian is a very specific and crucial detail that significantly narrows down the possibilities.\n*   The terms \"optical effect\" and \"real imagery\" place the discovery firmly in the field of optics. Concave mirrors are known for their ability to form real images (where light rays actually converge).\n\n### Step-by-Step Path to the Final Answer\n1.  **Initial Brainstorming & Keyword Search:** The most unique clue is the \"custodial worker\" and the \"concave mirror.\" Searching for anecdotes in the history of physics involving a janitor's discovery related to mirrors or optics is the most direct approach.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Anecdote:** This search leads to a well-known (though sometimes debated) story in the field of X-ray optics. The story involves a physicist at Stanford University in the 1940s.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Physicist:** The physicist in the story is **Paul Kirkpatrick**. He was working on a way to build an X-ray microscope. A major challenge was finding a way to focus X-rays, which pass through conventional lenses.\n\n4.  **Connecting the Clues:**\n    *   **Physicist & Microscopy:** Paul Kirkpatrick was a physicist trying to build an X-ray microscope. With his student Albert Baez, he developed the Kirkpatrick-Baez (K-B) mirror system, a foundational technology for modern X-ray microscopy and telescopes. This fits the \"physicist better known for work in the microscopy field\" clue.\n    *   **The Custodian's Observation:** As the story goes, Kirkpatrick was struggling with the problem of astigmatism from a single curved mirror. A janitor cleaning a large, cylindrically-curved decorative mirror (or a surplus searchlight mirror) noticed his reflection was strangely distortedâ€”stretched in one direction and squashed in the other. He mentioned this odd reflection to Kirkpatrick.\n    *   **The Optical Effect:** This observation of astigmatism gave Kirkpatrick the key insight. He realized that while a single cylindrical mirror focuses light to a line, not a point, he could use *two* cylindrical mirrors oriented at right angles (perpendicularly) to each other. The first mirror would focus the X-rays into a vertical line, and the second mirror would then focus that line into a single point, creating a clear, two-dimensional real image. This innovative use of grazing-incidence reflection from two crossed mirrors is the \"optical effect\" he discovered or, more accurately, ingeniously applied.\n    *   **Concave Mirrors & Real Imagery:** The entire system is based on focusing X-rays with concave mirrors to form a real image at a focal point.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Paul Kirkpatrick is the physicist who perfectly fits all the criteria laid out in the question. His work on the K-B microscope was directly inspired by an accidental observation of an optical effect by a custodian cleaning a concave mirror.\n\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"
