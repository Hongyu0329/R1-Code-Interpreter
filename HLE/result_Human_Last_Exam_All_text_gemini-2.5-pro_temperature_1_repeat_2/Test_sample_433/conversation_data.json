    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct Beyond-Use Date (BUD).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Container Type:** Single-dose container ampule.\n    *   **Action:** Punctured (more accurately, broken open).\n    *   **Environment:** A sterile environment, which implies an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC) like a laminar airflow workbench.\n    *   **Information Requested:** The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) from the time of opening.\n\n2.  **Understand the Key Terms:**\n    *   **Ampule:** An ampule is a hermetically sealed glass container. To access the contents, the neck of the ampule must be broken. Once broken, it becomes an open container and cannot be resealed to maintain sterility.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container (SDC):** A container intended for a single use for one patient. SDCs typically lack antimicrobial preservatives.\n    *   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** The date and time after which a preparation shall not be used. For an opened container, it's the time limit for using the contents before they must be discarded.\n    *   **Governing Standard:** The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations\" provides the standards for this scenario.\n\n3.  **Apply USP <797> Guidelines:**\n    *   USP <797> has very specific rules for handling single-dose containers to prevent microbial contamination.\n    *   The chapter makes a critical distinction between different types of single-dose containers, primarily ampules and vials.\n    *   When an ampule is broken open, its contents are directly exposed to the surrounding environment. Even inside an ultra-clean ISO Class 5 environment, this open system is at high risk for contamination.\n    *   Because it cannot be resealed, USP <797> states that an opened ampule **must be used immediately**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The nature of an ampule as an unsealable, open container is the deciding factor.\n    *   The rule is designed to prevent patient harm from potential microbial contamination or from particulate matter (tiny glass shards) that can be introduced when the ampule is broken.\n    *   Therefore, no storage time is permitted for an opened ampule, regardless of the environment's cleanliness. The contents must be withdrawn into a syringe (using a filter needle) and used at once. Any unused portion must be discarded immediately.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ampule vs. Single-Dose Vial:** This is the most common point of confusion. A **single-dose vial** has a rubber stopper that can be punctured. If entered in an ISO Class 5 environment, a single-dose vial can be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial puncture. This rule **does not** apply to ampules.\n2.  **The Role of the Sterile Environment:** The sterile environment (ISO Class 5) is required for the *act* of aseptically opening the ampule and withdrawing its contents. However, it does not extend the usable life of the contents once the ampule is open.\n3.  **Definition of \"Immediate Use\":** This term means that the task must be performed without any delay or interruption. In this context, it means the drug is withdrawn and administered or added to a compound right away. There is no permissible storage period.\n4.  **No Exceptions:** The rule for ampules is absolute. They are for immediate use only, and any remaining contents must be discarded.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the strict guidelines in USP <797> regarding the high contamination risk associated with opened ampules, the Beyond-Use Date is designated as \"Immediate Use.\" Storage is not permitted.\n\n<<<Immediate use. The ampule and any remaining contents must be discarded immediately after opening and withdrawing a dose. No storage period is permitted.>>>"
