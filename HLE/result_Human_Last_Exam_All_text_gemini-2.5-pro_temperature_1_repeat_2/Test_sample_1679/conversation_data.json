    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Objects:** The question asks about the \"Luxor Obelisk\". It's crucial to know that there are two famous Luxor Obelisks originating from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n    *   One obelisk remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n    *   The other obelisk stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France, where it was erected in 1836.\n    A film depicting either of these locations would satisfy the condition.\n\n2.  **Identify the Film Criteria:** The film must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture. We need to find the *first* one in chronological order that meets this condition.\n\n3.  **Chronological Search Strategy:** The most effective method is to go through the list of Best Picture winners, starting from the first award (for films of 1927/1928), and analyze the setting and prominent scenes of each film.\n\n4.  **Review of Early Best Picture Winners:**\n    *   **1920s-1930s:** Winners like *Wings* (1927/28), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1929/30), and *Cavalcade* (1932/33) are set in Europe, but their focus on war or domestic drama makes a clear depiction of the Place de la Concorde or Luxor Temple highly unlikely. *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is set in Paris, but its story focuses on courtrooms and interiors, without a famous scene at the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   **1940s:** This decade's winners, such as *Rebecca* (1940), *Casablanca* (1942), and *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946), are not set in locations that would feature either obelisk.\n\n5.  **Identifying a Strong Candidate:**\n    *   **_An American in Paris_ (Winner for 1951):** This film is a musical romance explicitly set in and celebrating the city of Paris. Its famous, climactic 17-minute ballet sequence features Gene Kelly dancing through a series of stylized, expressionistic sets based on famous Parisian landmarks and paintings. One of these elaborate sets is a recreation of the Place de la Concorde, which prominently features its central monument, the Luxor Obelisk.\n\n6.  **Verifying its \"First\" Status:** Having found a definite depiction in the 1951 winner, we must check if any earlier winner also qualifies. As noted in step 4, none of the winners from 1927 to 1950 have a setting or famous scene that includes either obelisk. Therefore, *An American in Paris* appears to be the first.\n\n7.  **Considering Later Winners for Context:** Other Best Picture winners also feature the Parisian obelisk. For example, **_Gigi_ (Winner for 1958)**, another musical set in Paris, includes on-location shots of the city, including the Place de la Concorde. However, since this film won seven years after *An American in Paris*, it is not the *first*. No Best Picture winners from this era prominently feature the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on a chronological review of Best Picture winners and their settings, the first film to win the award that depicts a Luxor Obelisk (specifically, the one in the Place de la Concorde in Paris) is *An American in Paris*. The depiction occurs during the film's celebrated final ballet sequence.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
