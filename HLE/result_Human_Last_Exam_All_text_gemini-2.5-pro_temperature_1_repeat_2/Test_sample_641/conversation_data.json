    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We are looking for the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group `PSU(4, 997)`.\n\nLet `G = SU(4, 997)` and `Z = Z(G)` be the center of `G`. Then `PSU(4, 997) = G/Z`.\nAn element `gZ` of `G/Z` is an involution if `(gZ)^2 = 1_{G/Z}` and `gZ \\neq 1_{G/Z}`.\nThis means `g^2 Z = Z`, which implies `g^2 \\in Z`, and `g \\notin Z`.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n1.  Determine the structure of the center `Z`.\n2.  Characterize the set `S = {g \\in G | g^2 \\in Z}`.\n3.  Calculate the number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)`.\n\n**Step 1: The center Z(SU(4, 997))**\nThe center of `SU(n, q)` consists of scalar matrices `λI` such that `λ^n = 1` and `λ^{q+1} = 1`. This is equivalent to `λ^{gcd(n, q+1)} = 1`.\nHere, `n = 4` and `q = 997`.\nWe need to find `d = gcd(4, q+1) = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\nSince `998 = 2 * 499`, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nSo, `Z` consists of matrices `λI` where `λ^2 = 1`. The solutions are `λ = 1` and `λ = -1`.\nThus, `Z = {I, -I}` and `|Z| = 2`.\n\n**Step 2: The set S = {g ∈ G | g² ∈ Z}**\nThis means we are looking for elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\nSo, `S = {g \\in G | g^2 = I} \\cup {g \\in G | g^2 = -I}`.\n\nLet's analyze the set `{g \\in G | g^2 = -I}`.\nAn element `g \\in U(n, q)` must have eigenvalues `λ` that satisfy `λ \\bar{λ} = λ^{q+1} = 1`.\nIf `g^2 = -I`, the eigenvalues of `g` must be square roots of -1, which are `i` and `-i`.\nFor such a `g` to be in `U(4, 997)`, its eigenvalues must satisfy `i^{q+1} = 1`.\nHere `q = 997`, so `q+1 = 998`.\nWe check the condition: `i^{998} = (i^4)^{249} \\cdot i^2 = 1^{249} \\cdot (-1) = -1`.\nSince `i^{998} = -1 \\neq 1`, the eigenvalues `i` and `-i` do not satisfy the condition for unitary matrices.\nTherefore, there are no elements `g` in `U(4, 997)` (and thus no elements in `SU(4, 997)`) such that `g^2 = -I`.\nThis means the set `{g \\in G | g^2 = -I}` is empty.\n\nSo, `S` is simply the set of elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = I`. This is the set of elements of order 1 or 2 in `SU(4, 997)`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the number of involutions**\nThe total number of elements `g` with `g^2 \\in Z` is `|S|`.\nThe number of elements of order 1 or 2 in `SU(n, q)` for `n` even (`n=2m`) and `q` odd is given by the well-established formula:\n`|S| = i(SU(n,q)) = |SU(n, q)| / |Sp(n, q)|`\nwhere `i(SU(n,q))` includes the identity element.\n\nFor `n=4`, we have:\n`|SU(4, q)| = q^6 (q+1) (q^2-1) (q^3+1) (q^4-1)`\n`|Sp(4, q)| = q^4 (q^2-1) (q^4-1)`\n\nSo, `|S| = |SU(4, q)| / |Sp(4, q)| = (q^6 (q+1) (q^2-1) (q^3+1) (q^4-1)) / (q^4 (q^2-1) (q^4-1))`\n`|S| = q^2 (q+1) (q^3+1)`\nUsing the sum of cubes factorization `a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)`, we get:\n`|S| = q^2 (q+1) (q+1)(q^2-q+1) = q^2 (q+1)^2 (q^2-q+1)`.\n\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is the number of elements of order 2. This is the total number of elements of order 1 or 2, which is `|S|/|Z|`, minus the identity element.\nNumber of involutions = `(|S| / |Z|) - 1`.\nWith `|S| = q^2 (q+1)^2 (q^2-q+1)` and `|Z|=2`, we get:\nNumber of involutions = `(q^2 (q+1)^2 (q^2-q+1)) / 2 - 1`.\n\nNow we substitute `q = 997`:\n`q^2 = 997^2 = 994009`\n`q+1 = 998`\n`(q+1)^2 = 998^2 = 996004`\n`q^2 - q + 1 = 997^2 - 997 + 1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013`\n\n`|S| = 994009 \\times 996004 \\times 993013`\n\nNumber of involutions = `(994009 \\times 996004 \\times 993013) / 2 - 1`\n`= 994009 \\times (996004 / 2) \\times 993013 - 1`\n`= 994009 \\times 498002 \\times 993013 - 1`\n\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n`994009 \\times 498002 = 495022282818`\n`495022282818 \\times 993013 = 491566341398864174`\n\nNumber of involutions = `491566341398864174 - 1 = 491566341398864173`."
