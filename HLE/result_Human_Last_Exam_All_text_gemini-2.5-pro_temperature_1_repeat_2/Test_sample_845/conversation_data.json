    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the name of the specific value measured between individual heartbeats, which is then used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\n2.  **Understand the Concepts:**\n    *   **Heart Rate (HR):** This is the number of times the heart beats per minute (BPM). It's an average over a period of time.\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** This is not the heart rate itself, but the measure of the *variation in time* between each heartbeat. A healthy heart does not beat with perfect regularity; the intervals between beats are constantly changing. HRV quantifies this variation.\n    *   **Beat-to-beat interval:** This is the literal time elapsed between two consecutive heartbeats. This is the raw data from which both HR and HRV are calculated.\n\n3.  **Identify the Measurement Source:**\n    *   The prompt mentions PPG (Photoplethysmography), the technology used in smartwatches and fitness trackers. It measures changes in blood volume to detect a pulse.\n    *   The gold standard for measuring heart electrical activity is the ECG (Electrocardiogram). An ECG trace has distinct waves labeled P, Q, R, S, and T. The most prominent and easily detectable peak corresponding to the main contraction of the heart's ventricles is the \"R-wave\".\n\n4.  **Connect the Concepts to Terminology:**\n    *   Since the R-wave is the clearest marker of a heartbeat on an ECG, the time interval between two consecutive R-waves is the standard measurement.\n    *   This measurement is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   Even though PPG detects a pulse wave peak and not an electrical R-wave, the term \"R-R interval\" is widely adopted and used in the field as the standard term for the beat-to-beat interval, regardless of whether it's measured by ECG or PPG.\n    *   Other related terms include **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**, which is a more general term, and **Normal-to-Normal (N-N) Interval**, which specifically refers to R-R intervals where abnormal beats (like premature ventricular contractions) have been filtered out. For calculating HRV, one almost always uses N-N intervals, but the fundamental unit they are derived from is the R-R interval.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **HRV vs. R-R Interval:** It is crucial not to confuse the two. The R-R interval is the specific measurement of time (in milliseconds) between two beats. HRV is a statistical calculation *based on a series* of these R-R intervals (e.g., the standard deviation of R-R intervals, known as SDNN).\n*   **Technology (PPG vs. ECG):** While the term \"R-R interval\" originates from ECG, it is the standard term used in HRV literature even when the data is collected via PPG.\n*   **The question asks for the *value*, not the *calculation*.** The value is the interval itself. The calculation is what you do with a collection of those values to get an HRV metric.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the value computed between heartbeats to track HRV is the time duration between those beats. The standard and most common term for this value in physiology and medicine is the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
