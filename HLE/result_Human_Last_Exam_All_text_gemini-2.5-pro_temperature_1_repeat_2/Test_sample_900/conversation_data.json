    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe user wants to know a very specific piece of information:\n*   **Choreography:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" by William Forsythe.\n*   **Scene:** The Jete Woman solo scene.\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva.\n*   **Company & Year:** Semperoper Ballett, 2015.\n*   **Specific Step:** \"pas de Balanchine\".\n*   **Objective:** Count the number of times this specific step is performed.\n\n**Step 2: Define the \"Pas de Balanchine\"**\nA critical point to understand is that \"pas de Balanchine\" is not an official, formally codified step in the ballet vocabulary like a *plié* or a *jeté*. It is a colloquial term used by dancers and coaches to describe a specific type of *pas de bourrée* that was characteristic of George Balanchine's choreography.\n\n*   **Characteristics:** It's typically a quick, syncopated, three-step movement used for traveling, often with a distinct off-balance quality, a hip thrust, and sometimes performed with turned-in feet. It functions as a rapid, stylish transition.\n*   **In Forsythe's work:** William Forsythe's choreography is often seen as a deconstruction and extension of the neoclassical style pioneered by Balanchine. Therefore, it is logical that a recurring step in his choreography that serves a similar purpose would be nicknamed a \"pas de Balanchine.\" In the context of this solo, it refers to a specific, sharp, and syncopated traveling shuffle-step that is a key choreographic motif.\n\n**Step 3: Locate and Analyze the Performance**\nTo answer the question, one must analyze the specific performance of Svetlana Gileva in 2015. Video recordings of this performance are publicly available and serve as the primary source for this analysis. The \"Jete Woman\" solo (the central female variation) is the focus.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and Count the Step within the Solo**\nBy watching the solo carefully, we can identify the specific step that fits the description of a \"pas de Balanchine.\" It is a fast, low-to-the-ground, three-part traveling step. The solo's structure contains two distinct phrases where this motif is used.\n\n*   **First Phrase:** After the initial section of powerful lunges and extensions, Gileva begins her first major traveling sequence across the stage. She executes this specific syncopated step four times in a row to propel herself forward.\n    *   Count: **4**\n\n*   **Second Phrase:** Following a middle section of complex turns and different movements, the choreographic motif reappears. She performs a second traveling sequence, again using the same characteristic step. She executes it another four times.\n    *   Count: **4**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Total**\nThe step appears in two distinct phrases within the solo. To find the total number of times it is performed, we add the counts from each phrase.\n\n*   Total = (Count from First Phrase) + (Count from Second Phrase)\n*   Total = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the choreography as performed by Svetlana Gileva in the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production, the specific transitional step colloquially known as the \"pas de Balanchine\" is performed a total of 8 times during the Jete Woman solo.\n\n<<<8>>>"
