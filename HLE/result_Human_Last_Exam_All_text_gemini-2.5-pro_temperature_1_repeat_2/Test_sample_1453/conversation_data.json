    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Pattern**\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by Î±-helices that have a characteristic repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat. This pattern is denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The stability and structure of the coiled-coil are primarily determined by the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions, which form the hydrophobic core where the helices pack together. The `e` and `g` positions are typically charged or polar and form electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Correct Register of the Heptad Repeat**\n\nWe need to align the given sequence, `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, to the `abcdefg` pattern. The most stable and likely register will place hydrophobic residues (like L, I, A, W, V) at the `a` and `d` positions. Let's ignore the flanking Glycine (G) residues, which often act as flexible caps, and focus on the core 28-residue sequence: `EIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLK`. This core consists of exactly four 7-residue repeats.\n\nWe will test different starting positions (registers) for the `a` position.\n\n*   **Register 1: `a` = E.** (`a` positions: E,E,E,E; `d` positions: Q,K,W,Q). This is unlikely, as E and Q/K are polar/charged, not ideal for a hydrophobic core.\n*   **Register 2: `a` = I.** (`a` positions: I,I,I,I; `d` positions: S,S,S,S). This is unlikely, as Serine (S) is polar.\n*   **Register 3: `a` = A.** (`a` positions: A,A,A,A; `d` positions: L,L,L,L). This looks plausible, as both Alanine (A) and Leucine (L) are hydrophobic.\n*   **Register 4: `a` = L.** Let's try starting the heptad at the first L. The heptad would be `LKEIAQS`.\n    *   Sequence: `...QS [L K E I A Q S] [L K E I A K S] [L K E I A W S] [L K...]`\n    *   Let's check the positions within this proposed heptad (`LKEIAQS`):\n        *   `a`=`L` (hydrophobic)\n        *   `d`=`I` (hydrophobic)\n    *   This register is also highly plausible.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Choosing the correct register is critical. We must look at more than just the `a` and `d` positions.**\n\nLet's compare the two plausible registers by also examining the `e` and `g` positions.\n\n*   **Analysis of Register 3 (`a=A, d=L`):**\n    *   Heptad: `AQSLKEI`\n    *   `a` positions: A, A, A, A (hydrophobic)\n    *   `d` positions: L, L, L, L (hydrophobic)\n    *   `e` positions: K, K, K, K (charged, good)\n    *   `g` positions: I, I, I, I (hydrophobic). This is highly unusual and energetically unfavorable. The `g` position is typically solvent-exposed or forms polar interactions. A bulky hydrophobic Isoleucine here is a strong indicator that this register is incorrect.\n\n*   **Analysis of Register based on `LKEIAQS` heptad:**\n    *   Let's map this register to the full sequence:\n        `pos:      c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g`\n        `Sequence: E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K`\n    *   `a` positions: `L`, `L`, `L`, `L` (Leucine, hydrophobic)\n    *   `d` positions: `I`, `I`, `W`, `I` (Isoleucine/Tryptophan, all strongly hydrophobic)\n    *   `e` positions: `K`, `K`, `K`, `K` (Lysine, charged)\n    *   `g` positions: `S`, `S`, `S`, `S` (Serine, polar)\n    *   This register is chemically perfect. It places large hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` core positions and complementary polar (S) and charged (K) residues at the `g` and `e` positions, which can form stabilizing hydrogen bonds or salt bridges (`g-e'` interactions). This is almost certainly the correct register.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Core Residue Identity to Oligomeric State**\n\nNow that we have confidently identified the core residues, we can predict the oligomeric state.\n\n*   **`a` positions:** All are Leucine (L).\n*   **`d` positions:** Mostly Isoleucine (I), with one Tryptophan (W).\n\nThe \"knobs-into-holes\" packing model and empirical studies (notably by Harbury et al.) have established rules based on the identity of residues at `a` and `d`:\n\n*   **Dimer (2-helix):** Typically has `I` at `a` and `L` at `d`.\n*   **Trimer (3-helix):** Typically has `I` at `a` and `I` at `d`, or `L` at `a` and `L` at `d`.\n*   **Tetramer (4-helix):** Typically has `L` at `a` and `I` at `d`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The specific type of hydrophobic residue matters.** The different shapes and sizes of `L` (non-beta-branched) and `I` (beta-branched) cause them to pack differently.\n\nOur sequence has `L` at the `a` positions and `I` (or the very large `W`) at the `d` positions. This matches the canonical pattern for a **tetramer**.\n\n**Step 4: Justify the Prediction with Packing Principles**\n\nIn a four-helix bundle (tetramer), the `d` residues point directly into the center of the bundle, forming a hydrophobic spine. Large residues like `I` and `W` are ideal for filling this central space efficiently. The `a` residues pack against the surface of the adjacent helix. The non-beta-branched side chain of Leucine (L) fits well into this groove without the steric strain that a beta-branched residue like Isoleucine (I) would cause. Therefore, the `a=L, d=I/W` pattern is sterically and energetically optimal for a tetrameric structure.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the identification of the correct heptad repeat and the specific amino acids (`L` at `a`, `I`/`W` at `d`) in the hydrophobic core, the sequence is predicted to form a tetramer.\n\nThe oligomeric state would be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
