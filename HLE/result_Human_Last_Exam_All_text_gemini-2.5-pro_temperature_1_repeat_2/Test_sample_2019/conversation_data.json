    "This problem asks for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Constraints\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid. The coordinates `(r, c)` can be represented by integers from 0 to 4.\n*   **Toroidal:** The board wraps around. This means all arithmetic on coordinates (rows and columns) is done modulo 5. For example, the square to the right of `(r, 4)` is `(r, 0)`, and the square below `(4, c)` is `(0, c)`.\n*   **4 Non-attacking Queens:** We need to place 4 queens such that no two queens can attack each other. A queen at `(r, c)` attacks any square `(r', c')` if:\n    1.  `r' = r` (same row)\n    2.  `c' = c` (same column)\n    3.  `r' - c' ≡ r - c (mod 5)` (same main diagonal)\n    4.  `r' + c' ≡ r + c (mod 5)` (same anti-diagonal)\n\nTherefore, a valid placement of 4 queens at positions `(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)` must satisfy the following conditions:\n*   The rows `r1, r2, r3, r4` must all be distinct.\n*   The columns `c1, c2, c3, c4` must all be distinct.\n*   The main diagonal indices `r1-c1, r2-c2, r3-c3, r4-c4` must all be distinct (modulo 5).\n*   The anti-diagonal indices `r1+c1, r2+c2, r3+c3, r4+c4` must all be distinct (modulo 5).\n\n### Step 2: Strategy - Relating 4-Queens to 5-Queens\n\nDirectly counting the arrangements for 4 queens is complex. A more elegant approach is to relate this problem to the simpler 5-queens problem on the same 5x5 toroidal board. Let `f(n, k)` denote the number of ways to place `k` non-attacking queens on an `n x n` toroidal board. We are looking for `f(5, 4)`.\n\nThere is a theorem for odd `n` that states:\n`f(n, n-1) = n * f(n, n)`\n\n**Justification of the theorem for n=5:**\n1.  **From a 5-queen solution to 4-queen solutions:** A valid 5-queen solution has one queen in each row, column, and diagonal. If we remove any one of the 5 queens, the remaining 4 queens will still be non-attacking. Therefore, every 5-queen solution generates 5 distinct 4-queen solutions.\n2.  **From a 4-queen solution to a 5-queen solution:** A valid 4-queen solution occupies 4 rows, 4 columns, 4 main diagonals, and 4 anti-diagonals. This leaves exactly one empty row `r_e`, one empty column `c_e`, one empty main diagonal `d_e`, and one empty anti-diagonal `s_e`. For a 5-queen solution to be formed, we must be able to place a 5th queen at `(r_e, c_e)`. This requires `(r_e, c_e)` to lie on the empty diagonals, i.e., `r_e - c_e ≡ d_e (mod 5)` and `r_e + c_e ≡ s_e (mod 5)`. For an odd-sized board (`n=5`), it can be proven that this condition always holds. Thus, every 4-queen solution can be uniquely extended to a 5-queen solution.\n\nThis establishes that the total number of 4-queen solutions is exactly 5 times the number of 5-queen solutions. So, our task reduces to finding `f(5, 5)`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Number of 5-Queen Solutions `f(5, 5)`\n\nThe solutions to the `n`-queens problem on an `n x n` toroidal board, when `n` is a prime number (like 5), are known to be \"linear\". This means they are of the form:\n`{(k, a + bk) mod 5 | k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`\n\nWhere:\n*   `k` iterates through the rows {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n*   `a` represents a vertical shift of the entire solution. It can be any value from 0 to 4 (5 choices).\n*   `b` represents the \"slope\" of the line of queens. For the queens to be non-attacking, `b` must satisfy the conditions that `b`, `b-1`, and `b+1` are all non-zero modulo 5.\n    *   `b ≠ 0 (mod 5)` (to avoid multiple queens in the same column)\n    *   `b ≠ 1 (mod 5)` (to avoid main diagonal attacks)\n    *   `b ≠ -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)` (to avoid anti-diagonal attacks)\n\nFor `n=5`, the possible values for `b` are `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. The forbidden values are 0, 1, and 4. This leaves `b=2` and `b=3` as the only valid choices (2 choices).\n\nSo, the total number of 5-queen solutions is:\n`f(5, 5) = (Number of choices for a) × (Number of choices for b)`\n`f(5, 5) = 5 × 2 = 10`\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nNow we can use the theorem from Step 2 to find the number of 4-queen solutions:\n`f(5, 4) = 5 * f(5, 5)`\n`f(5, 4) = 5 * 10 = 50`\n\nThere are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
