    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene, CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂). This is a conjugated diene, a molecule with two double bonds separated by a single bond. It can act as the 4π-electron component in a cycloaddition reaction. For the reaction to occur, it must adopt the s-cis conformation.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂). This is an alkene, which can act as the 2π-electron component (a dienophile).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a classic example of a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a type of [4+2] cycloaddition, meaning a 4π-electron system (the diene) reacts with a 2π-electron system (the dienophile) to form a six-membered ring in a concerted process.\n\n**Step 2: Assess the Reactivity of the Dienophile**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction is generally favored when the dienophile is \"electron-poor,\" meaning it has electron-withdrawing groups attached to the double bond.\n*   In CCl₂=CF₂, both chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F) atoms are highly electronegative and act as strong electron-withdrawing groups via the inductive effect. This makes the double bond electron-deficient and renders 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene a highly reactive dienophile.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring containing one new double bond.\n*   The atoms C1, C2, C3, and C4 of butadiene, along with the two carbons of the dienophile, form the new ring.\n*   The π bonds from C1=C2 and C3=C4 of the diene, and the π bond of the dienophile, are broken.\n*   Two new sigma (σ) bonds are formed: one between C1 of the diene and one carbon of the dienophile, and another between C4 of the diene and the other carbon of the dienophile.\n*   One new pi (π) bond is formed between C2 and C3 of the original diene.\n*   The resulting core structure is a **cyclohexene** ring.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Regiochemistry of the Reaction**\n*   **Regiochemistry** refers to the orientation of the reactants when they combine. Since the diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical but the dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂) is unsymmetrical, two different regioisomers could potentially be formed.\n*   The outcome is governed by electronic interactions, specifically the alignment of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile.\n*   The reaction proceeds through a transition state where the atoms with the largest orbital coefficients in the HOMO and LUMO align.\n    *   **Diene HOMO:** The largest orbital coefficients are on the terminal carbons (C1 and C4).\n    *   **Dienophile LUMO:** The largest orbital coefficient will be on the more electron-deficient carbon atom.\n*   We compare the electron-withdrawing ability of the CF₂ and CCl₂ groups. Fluorine (electronegativity ≈ 3.98) is significantly more electronegative than chlorine (electronegativity ≈ 3.16). Therefore, the carbon atom of the CF₂ group is more electron-poor (more δ+) and has the larger LUMO coefficient.\n*   For the most stable transition state, the C1 of butadiene (large HOMO coefficient) will bond to the carbon of the CF₂ group (large LUMO coefficient). Consequently, C4 of butadiene will bond to the carbon of the CCl₂ group.\n\n**Step 5: Draw and Name the Major Product**\n*   Based on the regiochemical analysis, the major product is the one formed from the C1(diene)–C(F₂) and C4(diene)–C(Cl₂) bond formations.\n*   The resulting structure is a cyclohexene ring with a CCl₂ group and a CF₂ group on adjacent carbon atoms.\n\n    Let's draw the final product and name it according to IUPAC rules:\n    1.  The structure is:\n        ```\n                  CH=CH\n                 /     \\\n              H₂C       CH₂\n               \\       /\n                C(F₂) - C(Cl₂)\n        ```\n    2.  **IUPAC Naming:**\n        *   The parent ring is **cyclohexene**.\n        *   Number the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (C1 and C2).\n        *   Then, number in the direction that gives the substituents the lowest possible locants (positions on the ring).\n        *   We must choose between two numbering schemes that both place the double bond at C1-C2. We then check the substituent numbers.\n        *   Scheme A: Numbering gives 4,4-dichloro and 5,5-difluoro.\n        *   Scheme B: Numbering gives 5,5-dichloro and 4,4-difluoro.\n        *   According to IUPAC rules, when there is a choice, we cite the substituents alphabetically (Chloro before Fluoro) and give the alphabetically first substituent the lower number.\n        *   Therefore, the CCl₂ group should have the lower locant set. Scheme A assigns the \"dichloro\" group to position 4, while Scheme B assigns it to position 5. We choose Scheme A.\n\n*   **Final Product Name:** **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Reaction Identification:** Correctly identifying the reaction as a Diels-Alder cycloaddition is the crucial first step.\n*   **Conformation:** Remember that butadiene must be in the s-cis conformation.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** This is the most complex point. The unsymmetrical nature of the dienophile requires an analysis of electronic effects (FMO theory) to predict the major product. The difference in electronegativity between F and Cl is key.\n*   **IUPAC Nomenclature:** Careful application of naming rules for substituted cycloalkenes is needed to arrive at the correct name, including numbering the double bond, assigning lowest locants to substituents, and using alphabetical order as a tie-breaker.\n\nThe product of the reaction is the regioisomer where the carbon of the CF₂ group has bonded to a terminal carbon of the butadiene, and the carbon of the CCl₂ group has bonded to the other terminal carbon.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
