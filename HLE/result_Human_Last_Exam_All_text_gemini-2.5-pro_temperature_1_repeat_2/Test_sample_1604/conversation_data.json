    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe goal is to identify which battle, among all the battles painted by the artist Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler, occurred at the latest point in history. This requires us to look at the date of the event depicted, not the date the painting was created.\n\n**Step 2: List Notable Paintings by Lady Butler and the Historical Events They Depict**\nWe need to compile a list of Lady Butler's military paintings and find the date of the battle or military action shown in each one.\n\n*   ***Scotland Forever!*** (painted in 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the **Battle of Waterloo** on June 18, **1815**.\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted in 1875): Depicts the **Battle of Quatre Bras**, which took place on June 16, **1815**, two days before Waterloo.\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (painted in 1879): Depicts Dr. William Brydon arriving at Jalalabad in January **1842**, as the supposed sole survivor of the retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted in 1874): Depicts a scene from the Crimean War, after the **Battle of Inkerman** on November 5, **1854**.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (painted in 1876): Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade during the **Battle of Balaclava** on October 25, **1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted in 1880): Depicts the **Battle of Rorke's Drift**, which occurred on January 22-23, **1879**, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted in 1882): Depicts the death of Lieutenant Robert Elwes at the **Battle of Laing's Nek** on January 28, **1881**, during the First Boer War.\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** (painted c. 1915): Depicts the **Great Retreat from Mons** in August **1914**, during the early stages of World War I.\n*   ***The Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February 1916***: Depicts a specific cavalry charge during the **Battle of Agagia** in Egypt on February 26, **1916**, as part of the Senussi Campaign of World War I.\n\n**Step 3: Create a Chronological Timeline of the Battles**\nNow, let's arrange the battles in historical order based on their dates.\n\n1.  **1815**: Battle of Waterloo / Quatre Bras\n2.  **1842**: Retreat from Kabul\n3.  **1854**: Battles of Inkerman and Balaclava (Crimean War)\n4.  **1879**: Battle of Rorke's Drift\n5.  **1881**: Battle of Laing's Nek\n6.  **1914**: Retreat from Mons (World War I)\n7.  **1916**: Battle of Agagia (World War I)\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Latest Battle**\nBy comparing the dates on the timeline, the latest historical event is the Battle of Agagia, which took place in **1916**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Event Date vs. Painting Date:** It is crucial to distinguish between the date the battle happened and the date Lady Butler created the painting. For example, *Scotland Forever!* was painted in 1881, but the battle it shows was in 1815.\n*   **Include All Works:** The answer depends on considering Lady Butler's entire body of work, including her later paintings of World War I, which are less famous than her Victorian-era masterpieces.\n*   **Specificity of the \"Battle\":** The question asks for a \"battle.\" All the events listed are specific military engagements or campaigns that fit this description.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Battle of Agagia.\n\n<<<The Battle of Agagia>>>"
