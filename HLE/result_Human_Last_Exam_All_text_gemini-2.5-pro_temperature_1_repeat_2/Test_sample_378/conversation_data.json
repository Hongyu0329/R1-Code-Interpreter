    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to find a specific year when an individual, named \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" publicly took on the name \"Azikiwe.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Individuals:**\n    *   **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan:** He was the President of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015. His full, officially recognized name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n    *   **Nnamdi Azikiwe:** He was the first President of Nigeria, serving from 1963 to 1966. He was a prominent nationalist figure and is often referred to as \"Zik.\" His surname is Azikiwe.\n\n3.  **Verify the Name in the Question:** The question uses the name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\" This combines the names of two different, prominent Nigerian leaders. Goodluck Jonathan's middle name is Ebele, not Azikiwe.\n\n4.  **Investigate for a Name Change or Public Identification:** The next step is to search for any credible records, news reports, official statements, or public declarations where Goodluck Ebele Jonathan might have adopted, used, or identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe.\"\n\n5.  **Analyze the Findings:**\n    *   There are no official records, government documents, or reputable news sources that indicate Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever changed his name to include \"Azikiwe.\"\n    *   There are no records of any public speeches or statements where he identified himself as \"Azikiwe.\" He has, like many Nigerian politicians, referenced the legacy of Nnamdi Azikiwe, but he has never claimed the name as his own.\n    *   The premise of the question is based on a factual inaccuracy. Goodluck Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe are two distinct historical figures, and the former never adopted the latter's name.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinct Identities:** It is crucial to distinguish between Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe. They are from different generations and held the presidency at different times in Nigeria's history.\n*   **Official vs. Informal Names:** One must check if \"Azikiwe\" was perhaps a nickname. There is no evidence of this; his common nickname is \"GEJ.\"\n*   **The source of the error:** The question likely arises from a confusion or a merging of the names of two famous Nigerian presidents.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** The conclusion is based on the absence of any evidence for the event. In historical and factual inquiries, a lack of credible evidence for a claim is sufficient to conclude that the event did not happen.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the event described in the question—Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe—never occurred. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a year for an event that did not take place.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, and he is a different person from Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president. The event described in the question did not happen.>>>"
