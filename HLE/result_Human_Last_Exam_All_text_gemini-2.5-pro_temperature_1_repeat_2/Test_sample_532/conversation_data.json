    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A non-empty subset `S` of `G` is called product-free if for all elements `x, y` in `S` (including the case `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S \\cdot S \\cap S = \\emptyset`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The identity element `e` can never be in a product-free set, because if `e \\in S`, then `e \\cdot e = e`, which is in `S`.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (Maximal Product-Free Set):** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means for any element `g \\in G \\setminus S`, the set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is not product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is filled if the collection of all its maximal product-free sets \"fills\" `G`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since no product-free set contains the identity `e`, the union of all maximal product-free sets cannot contain `e`. Therefore, the phrase \"fills G\" must be interpreted as covering all non-identity elements. A group `G` is filled if every non-identity element `g \\in G \\setminus \\{e\\}` belongs to at least one maximal product-free set.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Core Problem\n\nThe question asks to identify all finite nilpotent groups `G` such that for every element `g \\in G \\setminus \\{e\\}`, there exists a maximal product-free set `S` with `g \\in S`.\n\n### Step 3: Using a Key Theorem from Group Theory\n\nSolving this problem from first principles for all nilpotent groups is complex. A crucial theorem, established by Cherlin, Belyaev, and Taytslin, provides a structural characterization of filled groups.\n\n**Theorem:** A finite group `G` is a filled group if and only if it has no quotient group isomorphic to `C_p \\times C_p` for any prime `p`.\n(Here `C_p` is the cyclic group of order `p`.)\n\nWe will use this powerful theorem to solve the problem. The task now is to find which finite nilpotent groups satisfy this condition.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Theorem to Nilpotent Groups\n\nLet `G` be a finite nilpotent group. By the structure theorem for finite nilpotent groups, `G` is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups:\n`G = P_1 \\times P_2 \\times \\dots \\times P_k`\nwhere `P_i` is the Sylow `p_i`-subgroup of `G` for distinct primes `p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k`.\n\nNow, we apply the condition from the theorem: `G` must not have a quotient isomorphic to `C_p \\times C_p`.\n\n*   A quotient of `G` is a group `G/N` for some normal subgroup `N`.\n*   If `G` has a quotient `H \\cong C_p \\times C_p`, then `H` is a p-group. This implies that the corresponding Sylow `p`-subgroup of `G` (let's call it `P`) must have a quotient isomorphic to `C_p \\times C_p`.\n*   Conversely, if a Sylow `p`-subgroup `P` has a quotient `P/N_p \\cong C_p \\times C_p`, then `G` will have a quotient `G/(N_p \\times \\prod_{i \\neq p} P_i) \\cong P/N_p \\cong C_p \\times C_p`.\n\nTherefore, the condition that `G` is filled is equivalent to the condition that **for every Sylow p-subgroup `P` of `G`, `P` does not have a quotient isomorphic to `C_p \\times C_p`**.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing the Condition on Sylow Subgroups\n\nLet `P` be a finite p-group. We need to determine when `P` has no quotient isomorphic to `C_p \\times C_p`.\n\n*   Every p-group `P` has a characteristic subgroup called the Frattini subgroup, `\\Phi(P)`. The quotient `P/\\Phi(P)` is the largest elementary abelian p-quotient of `P`.\n*   `P/\\Phi(P)` is isomorphic to a direct product of copies of `C_p`, i.e., `P/\\Phi(P) \\cong (C_p)^d` for some integer `d`. This `d` is the minimum number of generators for the group `P`.\n*   Any elementary abelian p-quotient of `P` (like `C_p \\times C_p`) must be a quotient of `P/\\Phi(P)`.\n*   So, `P` has a quotient isomorphic to `C_p \\times C_p = (C_p)^2` if and only if `d \\ge 2`.\n\nFor `P` to have *no* quotient isomorphic to `C_p \\times C_p`, its minimum number of generators `d` must be less than 2.\n*   If `d=0`, `P` is the trivial group.\n*   If `d=1`, `P` can be generated by a single element. A p-group generated by one element is a cyclic group.\n\nSo, for `G` to be filled, each of its Sylow `p_i`-subgroups `P_i` must be a cyclic group (or trivial).\n\n### Step 6: Determining the Final Structure of the Group\n\nWe have concluded that a finite nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if all of its Sylow subgroups are cyclic.\n\nLet `G = P_1 \\times P_2 \\times \\dots \\times P_k`, where each `P_i` is a cyclic `p_i`-group for distinct primes `p_i`.\n`P_i \\cong C_{p_i^{a_i}}` for some exponents `a_i \\ge 0`.\n\nA fundamental theorem of group theory states that the direct product of finite cyclic groups is cyclic if and only if their orders are pairwise coprime. The orders of the Sylow `p_i`-subgroups (`p_i^{a_i}`) are pairwise coprime by definition.\n\nTherefore, `G \\cong C_{p_1^{a_1}} \\times C_{p_2^{a_2}} \\times \\dots \\times C_{p_k^{a_k}} \\cong C_{p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_k^{a_k}}`.\n\nThis means that `G` must be a cyclic group.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe finite filled nilpotent groups are precisely the finite cyclic groups.\n\n<<<The finite cyclic groups>>>"
