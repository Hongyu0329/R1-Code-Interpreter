    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the line:\n\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThe meter is an **iambic senarius**, which consists of six iambic feet (S L). In the comic verse of Plautus, this basic pattern allows for many variations (substitutions and resolutions).\n\n**Step 1: Syllabification and Initial Quantity Analysis**\n\nFirst, we determine the natural quantity of each syllable (S for short, L for long). A syllable is long if it contains a long vowel or diphthong (long by nature), or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (long by position). Otherwise, it is short.\n\n*   **et**: The vowel `e` is followed by 't'. The next word, `tibi`, starts with 't'. The two consonants make the syllable long by position. **L**\n*   **ti-bi**: The `i` in both syllables is naturally short. **S S**\n*   **be-ne**: Both `e`'s are naturally short. **S S**\n*   **es-se**: `es-` is long by position (due to `ss`). `-se` is short. **L S**\n*   **so-li**: The dative of `solus` is `sōlī`. Both vowels are long by nature. **L L**\n*   **quom**: The vowel `o` is followed by `m` and the `s` of `sibi`. It is long by position. **L**\n*   **si-bi**: Both `i`'s are naturally short. **S S**\n*   **sit**: The `i` is followed by `t` and the `m` of `male`. It is long by position. **L**\n*   **ma-le**: Both `a` and `e` are naturally short. **S S**\n\n**Step 2: Applying Rules of Elision and Comic Meter**\n\nWe must group these syllables into six feet, applying rules specific to Plautine meter.\n\n*   **Elision**: The word `bene` ends in a vowel and `esse` begins with one. The final `-e` of `bene` is elided.\n*   **Syncopation**: In Plautus, `esse` after a word like `bene` is often syncopated (shortened) to be scanned as a single long syllable, `ess'`. This is a common feature.\n    *   Therefore, `bene esse` becomes `ben' ess'`. The syllables are `be-`, `-ne`, and `ess'`. Their quantities are `S S L`.\n\n**Step 3: Foot-by-Foot Scansion**\n\nNow we can divide the line into six metrical feet.\n\n*   **Foot 1: `et tibi`**\n    *   Quantities: `L S S`\n    *   This forms a **Dactyl**. A dactyl is a valid resolution of a spondee, which can substitute for an iamb in the first foot.\n\n*   **Foot 2: `ben' ess(e)`**\n    *   Quantities: `S S L`\n    *   This forms an **Anapest**. An anapest is a valid resolution of an iamb.\n\n*   **Foot 3: `soli`**\n    *   Quantities: `L L`\n    *   This forms a **Spondee**. A spondee is a valid substitution for an iamb in an odd-numbered (1st, 3rd, 5th) foot.\n\n*   **Feet 4-6: `quom sibi sit male`**\n    *   This part of the line is a known metrical crux. The sequence of quantities is `L S S L S S`.\n    *   There is no way to divide this sequence into three regular iambic feet or their standard resolutions.\n    *   The most accepted scansion requires a Plautine license: allowing an \"irrational\" long syllable in the short position of an iamb, effectively creating a trochee (`L S`).\n    *   **Foot 4: `quom si-`**: Quantities `L S`. This is a **Trochee**, an irregular but necessary substitution here.\n    *   **Foot 5: `-bi sit`**: Quantities `S L`. This is a perfect **Iamb**.\n    *   **Foot 6: `male`**: Quantities `S S`. This is a **Pyrrhic**. The final syllable of the line is *anceps* (can be long or short), so a pyrrhic is a valid final foot.\n\n**Summary of the scansion:**\n\n| Foot 1    | Foot 2      | Foot 3 | Foot 4    | Foot 5   | Foot 6 |\n|-----------|-------------|--------|-----------|----------|--------|\n| `et tibi` | `ben' ess'` | `soli` | `quom si-`| `-bi sit`| `male` |\n| L S S     | S S L       | L L    | L S       | S L      | S S    |\n| (Dactyl)  | (Anapest)   | (Spondee)| (Trochee) | (Iamb)   | (Pyrrhic)|\n\nPutting it all together, the scansion is:\n\nL S S S S L L L L S S L S S\n\n<<<L S S S S L L L L S S L S S>>>"
