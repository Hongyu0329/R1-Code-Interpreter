    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ in the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Feynman Path Integral:** This formalism calculates quantum mechanical amplitudes by summing over all possible \"histories\" or \"paths\" a system can take between initial and final states. Each path is weighted by a phase factor $e^{iS/\\hbar}$, where $S$ is the classical action of that path. Correlation functions, like the Green's function, are calculated as expectation values within this framework.\n*   **Bare Green's Function ($G_0$):** This function, also known as the free propagator, describes the propagation of a *non-interacting* particle. The \"bare\" or \"free\" nature means we consider a system governed only by the free Hamiltonian ($H_0$), which contains the kinetic energy and any single-particle potential, but no particle-particle interactions.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$):** These are the energy levels of the non-interacting system. They are the eigenvalues of the free Hamiltonian, $H_0$, corresponding to eigenstates $|k\\rangle$. The index '$k$' represents the set of quantum numbers (e.g., momentum) that specifies the state. So, $H_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Problem in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nIn the path integral formalism, the Green's function is derived from the generating functional $Z[J]$, which is an integral over all field configurations $\\psi(x,t)$. For the *bare* Green's function, we only need the *free* action, $S_0$.\n\nThe two-point Green's function is formally given by:\n$G_0(x_1, t_1; x_2, t_2) = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x_1, t_1) \\psi^\\dagger(x_2, t_2) \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi]}}$\n\nA key insight is that the Green's function is the inverse of the operator that appears in the quadratic free action.\n\n**Step 3: Express the Free Action in the Energy Eigenbasis**\n\nThe analysis is simplest not in real space $(x, t)$ but in the basis of energy eigenstates $(k, \\omega)$. We transform the fields from the position basis to the energy eigenbasis: $\\psi(x,t) = \\sum_k \\phi_k(x) \\psi_k(t)$, where $\\phi_k(x) = \\langle x | k \\rangle$ is the single-particle wavefunction.\n\nThe free action $S_0 = \\int dt \\, L_0$ for a non-interacting system is described by the free Lagrangian $L_0$. In the energy eigenbasis, the Lagrangian for a non-relativistic system (like electrons in a solid) takes a very simple, diagonal form:\n$L_0 = \\sum_k \\psi_k^\\dagger(t) (i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(t)$\n\nThus, the free action is:\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\sum_k \\psi_k^\\dagger(t) (i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(t)$\nHere, $\\psi_k$ and $\\psi_k^\\dagger$ are the field operators (or Grassmann numbers inside the path integral) for the state with quantum number $k$. The operator acting on the fields is $(i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Green's Function by Inverting the Operator**\n\nThe Green's function $G_0(k; t_1-t_2)$ is the inverse of the operator in the action for a specific mode $k$. Therefore, it must satisfy the defining differential equation (setting $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity):\n$(i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t_1} - \\epsilon_k) G_0(k; t_1-t_2) = i \\delta(t_1-t_2)$\nThe $i\\delta(t)$ on the right-hand side is a convention that arises from the definition of the Gaussian integral for fermionic fields.\n\n**Step 5: Fourier Transform to Frequency Space**\n\nThis differential equation is easily solved by Fourier transforming from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$). The Fourier transform pair is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dt \\, e^{i\\omega t} G_0(k; t)$\nThe derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ becomes a multiplication by $-i\\omega$. Applying this to the differential equation, we get:\n$(i(-i\\omega) - \\epsilon_k) G_0(k, \\omega) = i$\n$(\\omega - \\epsilon_k) G_0(k, \\omega) = i$\n\nSolving for $G_0(k, \\omega)$ gives:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{i}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 6: Incorporate Causality (The $i\\eta$ Prescription)**\n\nThe expression above has a pole on the real axis at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. To perform the inverse Fourier transform correctly and recover the time-ordered (causal) Green's function, we must specify how to handle this pole. The boundary conditions inherent in the Feynman path integral automatically provide this prescription by shifting the pole slightly off the real axis. This leads to the famous $i\\eta$ (or $i\\delta$) term, where $\\eta$ is an infinitesimal positive number.\n\nThe final, correct form for the bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the chemical potential (or Fermi energy). The term $\\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)$ ensures that poles for particle-like excitations ($\\epsilon_k > \\mu$) are in the lower half-plane, and poles for hole-like excitations ($\\epsilon_k < \\mu$) are in the upper half-plane.\n\nFor many applications in vacuum quantum field theory, $\\mu=0$ and all energies are positive, so the expression simplifies to:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n*(Note: Some conventions have an overall factor of $i$, e.g., for relativistic scalar fields, but the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ in the denominator remains the same).*\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full:** This analysis is strictly for the *bare* Green's function ($G_0$), which ignores interactions. The full Green's function ($G$) has a more complex structure where the pole is shifted and broadened by the self-energy.\n2.  **Choice of Basis:** The functional dependence is most transparent in the energy-frequency basis $(k, \\omega)$, where the operator in the action is algebraic.\n3.  **Causality:** The $i\\eta$ prescription is not an ad-hoc addition but a crucial consequence of the boundary conditions in the path integral required to produce the causal, time-ordered propagator.\n4.  **Context:** The linear dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ in the denominator, $G_0 \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$, is characteristic of non-relativistic systems. For relativistic systems, the dependence is quadratic, $G_0 \\propto (\\omega^2 - \\epsilon_k^2)^{-1}$, reflecting the existence of both particles and antiparticles. The notation $\\epsilon_k$ strongly implies the non-relativistic case.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis shows that the bare Green's function $G_0$, when expressed in the basis of energy eigenstates $(k)$ and Fourier-transformed to frequency space $(\\omega)$, has a simple algebraic form. The single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ appears directly in the denominator of this expression. Specifically, $G_0(k, \\omega)$ has a simple pole, and the real part of the pole's location is precisely at the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe functional dependence is that of an inverse linear relationship:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n<<<The bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is a rational function whose denominator is linear in the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, the functional dependence is of the form $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k-\\mu)}$, where $\\epsilon_k$ determines the position of the pole on the real frequency axis.>>>"
