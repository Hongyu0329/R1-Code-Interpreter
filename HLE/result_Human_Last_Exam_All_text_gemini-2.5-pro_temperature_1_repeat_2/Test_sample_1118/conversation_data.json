    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Context:** Painted after escaping from the Gestapo (or more accurately, the SA, who made the initial arrests in early 1933).\n*   **Question:** What object does he hold in his hand as a symbol of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork.**\n*   A search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933\" leads to the painting titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\" (Self-Portrait with Pipe).\n*   The painting is housed in the Albertinum, part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the historical context.**\n*   Curt Querner was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and an opponent of the Nazi regime.\n*   In 1933, he was arrested by the SA, imprisoned, and tortured in the Hohnstein Castle concentration camp.\n*   He escaped and went into hiding, during which time he painted this self-portrait.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the visual details of the painting and their symbolism.**\n*   The portrait shows Querner's face in close-up, with a grim, intense, and defiant expression. He stares directly at the viewer.\n*   In his hand, he is clearly holding a smoking pipe.\n*   The pipe is not an aggressive or overt symbol like a weapon or a flag. It is an everyday, personal object.\n*   **Careful Point:** The symbolism lies in the context. After being subjected to dehumanizing brutality intended to break his spirit, painting himself with this simple object is an act of reclaiming his identity and inner freedom. The pipe symbolizes a return to normalcy, contemplation, and personal dignity. It represents a quiet, stubborn resilience and an unbroken will in the face of totalitarian oppression. It is a profound statement of self-assertion.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings to answer the question.**\n*   The artist is Curt Querner.\n*   The painting is his 1933 \"Self-Portrait with Pipe\".\n*   The context is his recent escape from Nazi imprisonment.\n*   The object he holds is a pipe.\n*   The pipe symbolizes his resilient spirit, reclaimed identity, and quiet defiance.\n\nTherefore, the object he holds in his hand as a symbol of resistance is a pipe.\n\n<<<A pipe>>>"
