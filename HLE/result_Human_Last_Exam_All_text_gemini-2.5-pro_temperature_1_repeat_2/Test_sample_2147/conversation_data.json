    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure:** The question centers on **Pavel Milyukov** (1859-1943). He was a prominent Russian historian and a leading liberal politician. He was the founder and leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (known as the Kadets). As a \"Westernizer,\" he advocated for Russia to adopt a Western-style constitutional government. However, he was also a rationalist and a positivist, which shaped his views on culture.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Quote and Placeholder:**\n    *   **The Quote:** \"stagnant swamp\" (in Russian: \"стоячее болото\", stoyacheye boloto). This is a powerful metaphor used to describe something that is decaying, unproductive, lacking vitality, and corrupt.\n    *   **The Accusation:** Milyukov \"frequently accused\" and \"denounced\" a specific aspect of culture. This implies a public and forceful criticism.\n    *   **The Placeholder:** \"X-Y\". This format suggests a two-part term, likely hyphenated, that describes the target of his criticism.\n\n3.  **Investigate Milyukov's Criticisms:**\n    *   Milyukov's most famous and fierce cultural polemic was directed against a 1909 collection of essays titled ***Vekhi*** **(Вехи), or *Landmarks*.**\n    *   The *Vekhi* authors (including prominent thinkers like Nikolai Berdyaev and Sergei Bulgakov) criticized the Russian radical intelligentsia for its atheism, utilitarianism, and revolutionary fanaticism. They called for a turn inward, toward spiritual, religious, and personal development, rather than focusing solely on political revolution.\n    *   As the leader of the liberal Kadet party, Milyukov saw this as a profound betrayal. He believed the intelligentsia's duty was to lead the political struggle for freedom against the Tsarist autocracy. He viewed the *Vekhi* authors' retreat into mysticism and philosophy as politically irresponsible and dangerous, essentially abandoning the fight. It was in this context that he and his allies organized public debates to condemn *Vekhi* and used harsh language to describe its ideas.\n\n4.  **Connect the Quote to the Target:**\n    *   Historical accounts of the \"Vekhi affair\" confirm that Milyukov and his supporters used metaphors like \"stagnant swamp\" to characterize the movement. They saw the *Vekhi* philosophy as a form of decay and a retreat from the vital struggle for Russia's political future.\n\n5.  **Identify the Term for \"X-Y\":**\n    *   The direct target was the *Vekhi* movement. However, \"Vekhi authors\" or \"Vekhi contributors\" does not fit the \"X-Y\" format.\n    *   We must consider the broader cultural context that *Vekhi* was part of. The turn-of-the-century period was characterized by a move away from 19th-century realism and positivism toward Symbolism, Decadence, and mysticism. This entire cultural era is known by a specific two-part, hyphenated French term: **fin-de-siècle** (end of the century).\n    *   Milyukov, the rationalist politician, was hostile to the entire **fin-de-siècle** cultural mood, which he saw as pessimistic, apolitical, and morbid. The *Vekhi* symposium was, in his eyes, a prime example of the intellectual \"swamp\" produced by the fin-de-siècle spirit.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Milyukov's Complexity:** It is important to note that Milyukov was a \"Westernizer,\" but he was critical of specific trends within Western and Russian culture that he felt were unproductive for Russia's political development.\n*   **Specificity of the Attack:** While the term \"fin-de-siècle\" represents the broader cultural movement, the most famous specific target of Milyukov's \"stagnant swamp\" accusation was the *Vekhi* symposium. The question uses the general term to represent the entire cultural phenomenon Milyukov opposed.\n*   **Format as a Clue:** The \"X-Y\" format is a crucial clue that points directly to \"fin-de-siècle\" as the intended answer, as it perfectly matches the structure and the historical context of Milyukov's criticisms.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nPavel Milyukov denounced the cultural trends of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which he saw as decadent, mystical, and politically passive. This cultural period is known as the **fin-de-siècle**. His famous attack on the *Vekhi* symposium as a \"stagnant swamp\" was a specific manifestation of his broader opposition to the fin-de-siècle spirit. Therefore, X-Y is \"fin-de-siècle\".\n\n<<<fin-de-siècle>>>"
