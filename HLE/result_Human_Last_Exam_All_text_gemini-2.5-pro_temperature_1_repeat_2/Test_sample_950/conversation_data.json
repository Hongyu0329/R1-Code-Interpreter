    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the space and the object of study\nThe space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G(3, 5)$. The object of study is the torsion subgroup of its integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe integral cohomology ring, viewed as an additive group, can be written as a direct sum over degrees $i$:\n$R = H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^{\\infty} H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nEach cohomology group $H^i$ is a finitely generated abelian group, which can be decomposed into a free part and a torsion part: $H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_i} \\oplus T_i$, where $b_i$ is the $i$-th Betti number and $T_i$ is the torsion subgroup of $H^i$.\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire ring $R$ is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each cohomology group:\n$T(R) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^{\\infty} T_i$.\nWe need to find the \"rank\" of this group $T(R)$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the structure of the torsion subgroup\nTo find the structure of $T(R)$, we need to determine each $T_i$. We can do this using the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology. For any space $X$, there is a short exact sequence:\n$0 \\to H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to \\text{Tor}(H^{i+1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to 0$.\n\nFor real Grassmannians, it is a known fact that the torsion in integral cohomology is entirely 2-torsion. This means each $T_i$ is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let $k_i$ be the number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands in $T_i$, so $T_i \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{k_i}$.\nWith this, the terms in the UCT sequence simplify:\n*   $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}^{b_i} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{k_i}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{b_i} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{k_i}$. Its dimension over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is $b_i+k_i$.\n*   $\\text{Tor}(H^{i+1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\text{Tor}(\\mathbb{Z}^{b_{i+1}} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{k_{i+1}}, \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{k_{i+1}}$. Its dimension is $k_{i+1}$.\n\nLet $d_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$. The exact sequence implies that the dimension of the middle term is the sum of the dimensions of the outer terms:\n$d_i = (b_i + k_i) + k_{i+1}$.\n\nTo find the values of $k_i$, we need to compute the Betti numbers $b_i$ and the mod 2 cohomology dimensions $d_i$. The dimension of $G(3,5)$ is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$, so we only need to consider $i=0, \\dots, 6$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Betti numbers ($b_i$)\nThe Betti numbers are the ranks of the free parts of the integral cohomology, which are equal to the dimensions of the rational cohomology groups: $b_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe rational cohomology of a real Grassmannian $G(k, n)$ is generated by the Pontryagin classes of the tautological bundle $\\gamma^k$ and its orthogonal complement $\\gamma^{\\perp, n-k}$.\nFor $G(3, 5)$, we have $k=3, n-k=2$. The rational cohomology ring is:\n$H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}[p_1, \\bar{p}_1] / I$, where $p_1=p_1(\\gamma^3) \\in H^4$ and $\\bar{p}_1=p_1(\\gamma^{\\perp, 2}) \\in H^4$.\nThe relation comes from $p(\\gamma^3) p(\\gamma^{\\perp, 2}) = 1$, which is $(1+p_1)(1+\\bar{p}_1)=1$. This implies $p_1 + \\bar{p}_1 + p_1\\bar{p}_1 = 0$.\nThe degree 4 part of this relation gives $p_1 + \\bar{p}_1 = 0$, so $\\bar{p}_1 = -p_1$.\nThe degree 8 part gives $p_1\\bar{p}_1 = 0$. Substituting $\\bar{p}_1 = -p_1$ gives $-p_1^2=0$, so $p_1^2=0$.\nThus, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}[p_1]/(p_1^2)$.\nSince $p_1$ is in degree 4, the non-zero rational cohomology groups are:\n*   $H^0(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}$, so $b_0=1$.\n*   $H^4(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q} \\cdot p_1$, so $b_4=1$.\n*   All other $b_i=0$.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the mod 2 cohomology dimensions ($d_i$)\nThe additive structure of $H^*(G(k, n); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is determined by the Schubert cells. The number of cells of dimension $i$, which equals $d_i$, is given by the number of partitions $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ such that $n-k \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k \\ge 0$ and the sum of the parts $|\\lambda| = \\sum \\lambda_j = i$.\nFor $G(3, 5)$, we have $k=3$ and $n-k=2$. We need partitions $\\lambda=(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ with $2 \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3 \\ge 0$.\n*   $i=0$: (0,0,0) -> 1 partition ($d_0=1$).\n*   $i=1$: (1,0,0) -> 1 partition ($d_1=1$).\n*   $i=2$: (2,0,0), (1,1,0) -> 2 partitions ($d_2=2$).\n*   $i=3$: (2,1,0), (1,1,1) -> 2 partitions ($d_3=2$).\n*   $i=4$: (2,2,0), (2,1,1) -> 2 partitions ($d_4=2$).\n*   $i=5$: (2,2,1) -> 1 partition ($d_5=1$).\n*   $i=6$: (2,2,2) -> 1 partition ($d_6=1$).\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the torsion ranks ($k_i$)\nNow we solve the system of equations $d_i = b_i + k_i + k_{i+1}$ for $i=0, \\dots, 6$. We know $k_i=0$ for $i<0$ and $i>6$. We also know $H^0(G(3,5);\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, so $k_0=0$.\n*   $i=0: d_0=1, b_0=1 \\implies 1 = 1 + k_0 + k_1 \\implies 1 = 1 + 0 + k_1 \\implies k_1=0$.\n*   $i=1: d_1=1, b_1=0 \\implies 1 = 0 + k_1 + k_2 \\implies 1 = 0 + 0 + k_2 \\implies k_2=1$.\n*   $i=2: d_2=2, b_2=0 \\implies 2 = 0 + k_2 + k_3 \\implies 2 = 0 + 1 + k_3 \\implies k_3=1$.\n*   $i=3: d_3=2, b_3=0 \\implies 2 = 0 + k_3 + k_4 \\implies 2 = 0 + 1 + k_4 \\implies k_4=1$.\n*   $i=4: d_4=2, b_4=1 \\implies 2 = 1 + k_4 + k_5 \\implies 2 = 1 + 1 + k_5 \\implies k_5=0$.\n*   $i=5: d_5=1, b_5=0 \\implies 1 = 0 + k_5 + k_6 \\implies 1 = 0 + 0 + k_6 \\implies k_6=1$.\n*   $i=6: d_6=1, b_6=0 \\implies 1 = 0 + k_6 + k_7 \\implies 1 = 0 + 1 + 0$. This is consistent.\n\nSo, the torsion subgroups are:\n$T_0=0, T_1=0, T_2=\\mathbb{Z}_2, T_3=\\mathbb{Z}_2, T_4=\\mathbb{Z}_2, T_5=0, T_6=\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n### Step 6: Find the rank of the total torsion subgroup\nThe total torsion subgroup is the direct sum of these individual torsion groups:\n$T(R) = T_0 \\oplus T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3 \\oplus T_4 \\oplus T_5 \\oplus T_6 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\n\nThe final point is to interpret the phrase \"rank of the torsion subgroup\".\n*   In the strict definition from the theory of abelian groups, the rank of a group is the rank of its free part. For any finite (torsion) group, this rank is 0.\n*   However, in many contexts, especially in group theory and topology, the \"rank\" of a finite group refers to the minimal number of generators. For a finite abelian $p$-group like $(\\mathbb{Z}_p)^k$, this is $k$. This is also called the $p$-rank of the group.\n\nGiven the substantial calculation required to find the structure of the torsion subgroup, it is highly probable that the question is asking for this latter notion of rank. For the group $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$, the minimal number of generators is 4. This corresponds to the total number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands, which is $\\sum k_i$.\n$\\sum_{i=0}^6 k_i = 0+0+1+1+1+0+1 = 4$."
