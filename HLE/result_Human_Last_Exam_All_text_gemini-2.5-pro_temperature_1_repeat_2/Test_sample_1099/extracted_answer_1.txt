The minimal average resources required are either **1 bit of classical communication** or, alternatively, **$\sqrt{2} - 1$ (approximately 0.414) non-signaling PR-boxes**. These are two distinct, fundamental costs for simulating the quantum correlations of a singlet state within a local hidden variable model.
