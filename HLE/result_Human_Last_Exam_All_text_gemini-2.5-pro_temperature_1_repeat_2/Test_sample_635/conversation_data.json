    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ is a non-singular polynomial matrix (i.e., $\\det(D(s))$ is not identically zero).\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means that the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the equation**\nThe equation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ is equivalent to $D(s) H(s) = N(s)$. Let's write this out with the given $H(s)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ to be polynomial matrices, every element on the right-hand side must be a polynomial.\n\nPerforming the matrix multiplication gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nd_{11}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\\nd_{21}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe denominator of the term $\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$ is $(s-1)(s+1)$. Let's rewrite the first term with the same denominator: $\\frac{s-1}{s+1} = \\frac{(s-1)^2}{s^2-1}$.\nSo the equations are:\n1.  $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$\n2.  $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$\n3.  $n_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$\n4.  $n_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$\n\n**Step 3: Find conditions for polynomial entries**\nFor $n_{11}(s)$ and $n_{21}(s)$ to be polynomials, their numerators must be divisible by the denominator $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$. This means the numerators must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\nLet's analyze the numerator of $n_{11}(s)$: $P_1(s) = d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$.\n-   At $s=1$: $P_1(1) = d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 2d_{12}(1) = 0$. This implies $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n-   At $s=-1$: $P_1(-1) = d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0$, which simplifies to $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n\nSimilarly, for the numerator of $n_{21}(s)$: $P_2(s) = d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$.\n-   At $s=1$: $P_2(1) = 2d_{22}(1) = 0$. This implies $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n-   At $s=-1$: $P_2(-1) = 4d_{21}(-1) + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0$, which simplifies to $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Construct a simple solution for D(s) and N(s)**\nWe need to find simple polynomials for the entries of $D(s)$ that satisfy these conditions and result in a non-singular $D(s)$. Let's try to make $D(s)$ upper triangular by setting $d_{21}(s) = 0$.\n\n-   **Second row of D(s):** With $d_{21}(s) = 0$, the conditions for the second row become:\n    -   $d_{22}(s)$ has a factor $(s-1)$.\n    -   $2(0) + d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(-1) = 0$. So $d_{22}(s)$ must also have a factor $(s+1)$.\n    -   Thus, $d_{22}(s)$ must be a multiple of $(s-1)(s+1) = s^2-1$. The simplest non-zero choice is $d_{22}(s) = s^2-1$.\n    -   This gives the second row of $D(s)$ as $[0 \\quad s^2-1]$.\n\n-   **First row of D(s):** Let's try the simplest possible choice for $d_{11}(s)$, which is $d_{11}(s) = 1$. The conditions for the first row become:\n    -   $d_{12}(s)$ has a factor $(s-1)$. So, $d_{12}(s) = (s-1)\\tilde{d}_{12}(s)$ for some polynomial $\\tilde{d}_{12}(s)$.\n    -   $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2(1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(-1) = -2$.\n    -   Substituting $d_{12}(s) = (s-1)\\tilde{d}_{12}(s)$, we get $(-1-1)\\tilde{d}_{12}(-1) = -2\\tilde{d}_{12}(-1) = -2$, which means $\\tilde{d}_{12}(-1) = 1$. The simplest polynomial for $\\tilde{d}_{12}(s)$ is the constant $\\tilde{d}_{12}(s)=1$.\n    -   This gives $d_{12}(s) = (s-1) \\cdot 1 = s-1$.\n    -   This gives the first row of $D(s)$ as $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\n\nSo, our candidate for $D(s)$ is:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant is $\\det(D(s)) = 1 \\cdot (s^2-1) - 0 = s^2-1$, which is not identically zero, so $D(s)$ is non-singular.\n\nNow we calculate the corresponding $N(s)$:\n-   $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = 1$\n-   $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = 0$\n-   $n_{11}(s) = \\frac{1 \\cdot (s-1)^2 + 2(s-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s-1+2)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = 1$\n-   $n_{21}(s) = \\frac{0 \\cdot (s-1)^2 + 2(s^2-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{2(s^2-1)}{s^2-1} = 2$\n\nSo, our candidate for $N(s)$ is:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Verify left coprimeness**\nWe need to check that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has rank 2 for all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis matrix is in row echelon form. The rows are linearly independent for all $s$ if there is no non-zero linear combination of the rows that results in a zero vector. Let's check this:\n$c_1 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1.  $c_1 = 0$\n2.  $c_1(s-1) + c_2(s^2-1) = 0$\n3.  $c_1 + 2c_2 = 0$\n4.  $c_1 = 0$\n\nFrom (1), we have $c_1=0$. Substituting this into (3) gives $2c_2=0$, so $c_2=0$.\nSince the only solution is $c_1=c_2=0$ for any value of $s$, the rows are always linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 for all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\nThis confirms that $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n>>>"
