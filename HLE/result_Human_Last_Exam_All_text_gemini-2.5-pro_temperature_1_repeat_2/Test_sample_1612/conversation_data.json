    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Triple Crown\nFirst, it's crucial to understand what a \"Triple Crown\" is in Major League Baseball. There are two distinct types of Triple Crowns: one for batters (hitters) and one for pitchers.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A batter wins the Triple Crown by leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three specific offensive categories in the same season:\n    1.  Batting Average (AVG)\n    2.  Home Runs (HR)\n    3.  Runs Batted In (RBI)\n\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher wins the Triple Crown by leading their respective league in three specific pitching categories in the same season:\n    1.  Wins (W)\n    2.  Strikeouts (K)\n    3.  Earned Run Average (ERA)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Batting Triple Crown Winners\nWe need to list all the unique players who have won the Batting Triple Crown. Some players have accomplished this feat more than once, but the question asks for the number of *winners* (i.e., the number of unique players).\n\nThe unique winners of the Batting Triple Crown are:\n1.  Paul Hines (1878)\n2.  Tip O'Neill (1887)\n3.  Hugh Duffy (1894)\n4.  Nap Lajoie (1901)\n5.  Ty Cobb (1909)\n6.  Heinie Zimmerman (1912)\n7.  Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925)\n8.  Chuck Klein (1933)\n9.  Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n10. Lou Gehrig (1934)\n11. Joe Medwick (1937)\n12. Ted Williams (1942, 1947)\n13. Mickey Mantle (1956)\n14. Frank Robinson (1966)\n15. Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n16. Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n\nCounting these unique players, we find there have been **16** Batting Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Pitching Triple Crown Winners\nSimilarly, we need to list all the unique players who have won the Pitching Triple Crown.\n\nThe unique winners of the Pitching Triple Crown are:\n1.  Tommy Bond (1877)\n2.  Old Hoss Radbourn (1884)\n3.  Tim Keefe (1888)\n4.  John Clarkson (1889)\n5.  Amos Rusie (1894)\n6.  Cy Young (1901)\n7.  Rube Waddell (1905)\n8.  Christy Mathewson (1905, 1908)\n9.  Walter Johnson (1913, 1918, 1924)\n10. Pete Alexander (1915, 1916, 1920)\n11. Dazzy Vance (1924)\n12. Lefty Grove (1930, 1931)\n13. Lefty Gomez (1934, 1937)\n14. Bucky Walters (1939)\n15. Bob Feller (1940)\n16. Hal Newhouser (1945)\n17. Sandy Koufax (1963, 1965, 1966)\n18. Steve Carlton (1972)\n19. Roger Clemens (1997, 1998)\n20. Pedro Mart√≠nez (1999)\n21. Randy Johnson (2002)\n22. Johan Santana (2006)\n23. Clayton Kershaw (2011)\n24. Justin Verlander (2011)\n25. Shane Bieber (2020)\n\nCounting these unique players, we find there have been **25** Pitching Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Winners\nThe question \"How many triple crowns winners are there\" is best interpreted as the total number of unique individuals who have won either a Batting or a Pitching Triple Crown. Since no player in MLB history has won both a Batting and a Pitching Triple Crown, we can simply add the number of unique winners from each category.\n\nTotal Winners = (Unique Batting Winners) + (Unique Pitching Winners)\nTotal Winners = 16 + 25 = 41\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Wins vs. Winners:** The question asks for the number of winners (unique players), not the total number of times the Triple Crown has been won. For example, Rogers Hornsby won it twice but is counted as one winner.\n*   **Two Types of Triple Crowns:** A complete answer must account for both the batting and pitching versions of the award.\n*   **Major League Recognition:** The list includes players from leagues that MLB officially recognizes as \"major leagues,\" such as the American Association (where Tip O'Neill won).\n*   **No Overlap:** No player appears on both the batting and pitching lists, so the two groups are mutually exclusive, and their totals can be directly summed.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nBy following the steps above, we have identified 16 unique Batting Triple Crown winners and 25 unique Pitching Triple Crown winners. Summing these two figures gives the total number of unique MLB players who have won a Triple Crown.\n\n16 (Batting) + 25 (Pitching) = 41\n\n<<<41>>>"
