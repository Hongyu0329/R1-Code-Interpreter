    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n### Step 1: Define the basic structure\nLet the two objects be `A` and `B`. A category must have an identity morphism for each object.\n*   `id_A` in `Hom(A, A)`\n*   `id_B` in `Hom(B, B)`\n\nThis accounts for 2 of the 4 total morphisms. The remaining 2 non-identity morphisms must be distributed among the four Hom-sets: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)`.\n\nLet `n_AA`, `n_AB`, `n_BA`, `n_BB` be the number of morphisms in `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)` respectively.\nWe have:\n*   `n_AA ≥ 1` and `n_BB ≥ 1`\n*   `n_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB = 4`\n\nThis means we need to distribute the 2 non-identity morphisms. Let's denote these distributions by the tuple `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)`.\n\n### Step 2: Enumerate the possible distributions of morphisms\nWe list all possible non-negative integer solutions for `(n_AA-1) + n_AB + n_BA + (n_BB-1) = 2`. We then group these distributions by isomorphism. Two distributions `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)` and `(n'_AA, n'_AB, n'_BA, n'_BB)` are considered equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by swapping the objects A and B (i.e., `n'_AA = n_BB`, `n'_BB = n_AA`, `n'_AB = n_BA`, `n'_BA = n_AB`).\n\nThis gives us 6 distinct cases to analyze:\n\n1.  **(3, 0, 0, 1):** Both non-identity morphisms are in `Hom(A, A)`. (This case is equivalent to `(1, 0, 0, 3)`).\n2.  **(1, 2, 0, 1):** Both non-identity morphisms are in `Hom(A, B)`. (This case is equivalent to `(1, 0, 2, 1)`).\n3.  **(2, 0, 0, 2):** One non-identity morphism is in `Hom(A, A)` and the other in `Hom(B, B)`. (This case is symmetric).\n4.  **(2, 1, 0, 1):** One non-identity morphism is in `Hom(A, A)` and the other in `Hom(A, B)`. (This case is equivalent to `(1, 1, 0, 2)`).\n5.  **(2, 0, 1, 1):** One non-identity morphism is in `Hom(A, A)` and the other in `Hom(B, A)`. (This case is equivalent to `(1, 0, 1, 2)`).\n6.  **(1, 1, 1, 1):** One non-identity morphism is in `Hom(A, B)` and the other in `Hom(B, A)`. (This case is symmetric).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each case for valid category structures\nFor each distribution, we must define the composition of morphisms in a way that satisfies the associativity axiom: `(h ∘ g) ∘ f = h ∘ (g ∘ f)`.\n\n*   **Case 1: (3, 0, 0, 1)**\n    *   `Hom(A, A)` has 3 morphisms, `Hom(B, B)` has 1 (`id_B`), and other Hom-sets are empty.\n    *   The structure is a disjoint union of two one-object categories. `Hom(A, A)` must form a monoid of order 3.\n    *   There are **5** non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Each defines a valid category.\n\n*   **Case 2: (1, 2, 0, 1)**\n    *   `Hom(A, B)` has 2 morphisms (`f`, `g`), while `Hom(A,A)` and `Hom(B,B)` only contain identities. `Hom(B, A)` is empty.\n    *   There are no non-trivial compositions possible (e.g., `f ∘ g` is not defined). The identity and associativity axioms are trivially satisfied. The choice of `f` and `g` is symmetric.\n    *   There is **1** unique category structure.\n\n*   **Case 3: (2, 0, 0, 2)**\n    *   `Hom(A, A)` has 2 morphisms, and `Hom(B, B)` has 2 morphisms. Other Hom-sets are empty.\n    *   This is a disjoint union of two one-object categories, each with 2 morphisms. `Hom(A, A)` and `Hom(B, B)` must be monoids of order 2.\n    *   There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2: the group `C₂` (where the non-identity element `h` satisfies `h²=id`) and the semigroup `S₂` (where `h²=h`).\n    *   We can pair these for `Hom(A,A)` and `Hom(B,B)`: `(C₂, C₂)` , `(S₂, S₂)` , `(C₂, S₂)`. The pair `(S₂, C₂)` is isomorphic to `(C₂, S₂)` by swapping objects.\n    *   There are **3** unique category structures.\n\n*   **Case 4: (2, 1, 0, 1)**\n    *   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, h}`, `Hom(A, B) = {f}`.\n    *   `Hom(A, A)` must be a monoid of order 2 (`h²=h` or `h²=id_A`).\n    *   The composition `f ∘ h` must be a morphism in `Hom(A, B)`, so `f ∘ h = f`.\n    *   For both choices of the monoid structure on `Hom(A, A)`, the associativity axiom holds.\n    *   There are **2** unique category structures.\n\n*   **Case 5: (2, 0, 1, 1)**\n    *   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, h}`, `Hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n    *   `Hom(A, A)` must be a monoid of order 2.\n    *   The composition `h ∘ g` (`h` after `g`) is a morphism from B to A, so `h ∘ g = g`. (Note: composition is defined `Hom(A,C) x Hom(B,A)` is not, it's `Hom(C,D) x Hom(B,C)`). The composition is `h: A \\to A` after `g: B \\to A`, which is `h \\circ g`. This is a morphism from `B \\to A`.\n    *   This composition rule is associative with both monoid structures for `Hom(A,A)`.\n    *   These 2 structures are not isomorphic to those in Case 4 because the pattern of non-empty Hom-sets is different.\n    *   There are **2** unique category structures.\n\n*   **Case 6: (1, 1, 1, 1)**\n    *   `Hom(A, B) = {f}`, `Hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n    *   To satisfy the axioms, compositions must be `g ∘ f = id_A` and `f ∘ g = id_B`.\n    *   This defines the category where `A` and `B` are isomorphic objects. The structure is uniquely determined.\n    *   There is **1** unique category structure.\n\n### Step 4: Sum the results\nTotal number of non-isomorphic categories is the sum of the counts from each distinct case:\n5 (from Case 1) + 1 (from Case 2) + 3 (from Case 3) + 2 (from Case 4) + 2 (from Case 5) + 1 (from Case 6) = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
