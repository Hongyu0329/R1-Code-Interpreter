    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Phenotype:** A measurable characteristic of an individual, such as height, blood pressure, or risk for a disease.\n*   **SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism):** The most common type of genetic variation among people. Each SNP represents a difference in a single DNA building block, called a nucleotide.\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population-level parameter. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype that can be explained by the additive effects of all the SNPs being considered (often all common SNPs across the genome). It is the *theoretical maximum* amount of variance that could be explained by a perfect linear predictor using these SNPs. It answers the question: \"How much of the trait's variance is correlated with these genetic markers?\" It is often estimated using methods like GCTA-GREML, which use genetic similarity between all pairs of individuals.\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a predictive tool for an individual. It is a score calculated for a person by summing up the effects of many SNPs. The \"effect\" of each SNP (its weight in the sum) is estimated from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The PGS is then used to predict an individual's phenotype.\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS (R²):** This measures how well the PGS actually works. It is calculated in a new, independent set of individuals (a \"test set\") by measuring the correlation between their PGS and their actual measured phenotype. The squared correlation (R²) gives the proportion of variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS in that specific sample.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Relationship Between SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability\n\nThe core of the question is the relationship between a theoretical maximum (SNP heritability) and the performance of a practical tool (PGS).\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability is the Ceiling:** SNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the \"gold standard\" or the ceiling for prediction using a linear combination of the given SNPs. It's the amount of variance you could explain if you knew the *true* causal effect of every single SNP perfectly.\n2.  **PGS is an Imperfect Implementation:** A PGS is a practical attempt to reach that ceiling. However, it is built on several imperfect inputs and assumptions:\n    *   **Estimated vs. True Effects:** A PGS uses effect sizes *estimated* from a GWAS. A GWAS has a finite sample size, which means these estimates are not perfectly accurate; they contain statistical noise. Larger GWASs produce better estimates, but they are never perfect.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** Genes that are physically close on a chromosome tend to be inherited together. This correlation (LD) makes it difficult to pinpoint the true causal SNP and its exact effect. Methods to build a PGS try to account for LD, but they are not perfect, leading to a loss of predictive power.\n    *   **Population Specificity:** The effect sizes and LD patterns can differ between populations (e.g., European vs. Asian ancestry). If a PGS is built from a GWAS in one population and applied to another, its accuracy usually drops.\n    *   **\"Winner's Curse\":** In the discovery GWAS, the effect sizes of the SNPs that are selected for the PGS may be overestimated due to random chance, which reduces their predictive performance in a new sample.\n\n### Step 3: Draw a Conclusion\n\nBecause the PGS is built using *estimated*, noisy, and imperfect information, its predictive power (R²) will necessarily be less than the theoretical maximum potential represented by the SNP heritability (h²_SNP). The gap between the PGS R² and the h²_SNP reflects the limitations of our current methods and data (e.g., GWAS sample size, handling of LD). As GWAS sample sizes grow infinitely large, the PGS R² will approach the h²_SNP, but it cannot logically exceed it.\n\nTherefore, the statement is correct. The predictive ability of a polygenic score is a measure of our current practical success, which is fundamentally limited by the theoretical maximum variance that is explainable in the first place (the SNP heritability).\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   [x] Differentiate between a population parameter (h²_SNP) and a predictor's performance (PGS R²).\n*   [x] Identify h²_SNP as the theoretical upper bound.\n*   [x] List the reasons why a practical PGS falls short of this theoretical bound (estimation error, LD, etc.).\n*   [x] Conclude that the PGS R² must be lower than or, at best, equal to h²_SNP.\n\nFinal Answer: The statement is **True**.\n\n<<<True>>>"
