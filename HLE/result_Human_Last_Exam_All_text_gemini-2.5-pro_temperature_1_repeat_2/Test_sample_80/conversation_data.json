    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Total Number of Edge Squares:**\n    *   A standard 8x8 chessboard has four edges.\n    *   The top and bottom rows (ranks 1 and 8) each have 8 squares.\n    *   The left and right columns (files 'a' and 'h') each have 8 squares.\n    *   To find the total number of unique edge squares, we can add the squares on all four sides and subtract the 4 corner squares that are counted twice: (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28.\n    *   Alternatively, we can count the squares on the top and bottom rows (8 + 8 = 16) and add the non-corner squares on the side columns (6 + 6 = 12). 16 + 12 = 28.\n    *   So, there are **28 edge squares** in total.\n\n2.  **Understand the Bishop's Movement and Constraints:**\n    *   A bishop attacks any number of squares diagonally.\n    *   A crucial point is that a bishop placed on a white square can only attack other squares of the same color (white). Similarly, a bishop on a black square only attacks other black squares.\n    *   This means we can analyze the placement of bishops on white squares and black squares completely independently.\n\n3.  **Analyze the White Edge Squares:**\n    *   The 28 edge squares are divided equally by color. There are **14 white edge squares** and 14 black edge squares.\n    *   Our goal is to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on these 14 white squares.\n    *   A simple and effective strategy is to place the bishops along the 'a' and 'h' files.\n    *   The white edge squares on the 'a' file are: `a2, a4, a6, a8`.\n    *   The white edge squares on the 'h' file are: `h1, h3, h5, h7`.\n    *   This gives us 8 potential locations. Let's check for conflicts. Bishops on the same file do not attack each other. We only need to check for diagonal attacks between a bishop on the 'a' file and one on the 'h' file.\n    *   The only such attack is along the main diagonal from `a8` to `h1`. A bishop on `a8` attacks `h1`, and vice-versa.\n    *   To place the maximum number of bishops from this set of 8 squares, we must choose only one from the conflicting pair (`a8`, `h1`).\n    *   This means we can place a maximum of 8 - 1 = **7 white bishops**. For example, we could place them on `a2, a4, a6, a8, h3, h5, h7`.\n    *   Placing these 7 bishops covers (by occupation or attack) all 14 white edge squares. For instance, placing bishops on `a2, a4, a6` attacks the white edge squares `b1, d1, f1` and `g8, e8, c8`. Placing a bishop on `a8` attacks `h1`. Thus, no more white bishops can be placed on the edge.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Black Edge Squares:**\n    *   The situation for the 14 black edge squares is perfectly symmetrical to the white squares.\n    *   The black edge squares on the 'a' file are: `a1, a3, a5, a7`.\n    *   The black edge squares on the 'h' file are: `h2, h4, h6, h8`.\n    *   Again, this gives us 8 potential locations.\n    *   The only conflict is along the other main diagonal between `a1` and `h8`.\n    *   Therefore, we can place a maximum of 8 - 1 = **7 black bishops**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Bishops Placed:**\n    *   Since the placements on white and black squares are independent, we can simply add the maximums.\n    *   Total Maximum Bishops = (Max White Bishops) + (Max Black Bishops) = 7 + 7 = **14 bishops**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Number of Empty Edge Squares:**\n    *   The question asks how many edge squares would *lack* bishops.\n    *   Total Edge Squares = 28\n    *   Bishops Placed = 14\n    *   Edge Squares Lacking Bishops = Total Edge Squares - Bishops Placed\n    *   Edge Squares Lacking Bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   The total number of edge squares is 28, not 32. The corners are part of both a rank and a file.\n*   The problem can be split into two independent sub-problems: one for white squares and one for black squares.\n*   The most efficient placement strategy involves using the long side files ('a' and 'h').\n*   The only conflicts in this strategy occur on the two main diagonals connecting the corners (`a1-h8` and `a8-h1`).\n*   The final question is not for the number of bishops, but for the number of *empty* edge squares.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is 14. Since there are 28 total edge squares, the number of squares lacking bishops is 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
