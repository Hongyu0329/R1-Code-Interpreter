    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is a pair of 1-cells and 2-cells satisfying certain conditions. Let's analyze this for the specific case of the simplex category $\\Delta$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-category.**\n*   **0-cells (Objects):** The objects are the finite ordinals, denoted as $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for any integer $n \\ge 0$. These are totally ordered sets under the standard ordering '$\\le$'.\n*   **1-cells (Morphisms):** A morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, i.e., for any $i, j \\in [m]$, if $i \\le j$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$.\n*   **2-cells (Transformations):** For any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-cell from $f$ to $g$, denoted $f \\Rightarrow g$, if and only if $f \\le g$ in the pointwise order. That is, $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. Since there is at most one 2-cell between any two 1-cells, this makes $\\Delta$ a posetal 2-category (or more precisely, a (2,1)-category).\n\n**Step 2: Define an internal adjunction in this context.**\nAn internal adjunction from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ consists of:\n1.  A pair of morphisms (1-cells): $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$.\n2.  A pair of 2-cells: a unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and a counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$.\n\nThe existence of the 2-cells translates to the following inequalities based on the pointwise order:\n*   The unit $\\eta$ exists iff $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$. This means for every $i \\in [m]$, $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$, which simplifies to $i \\le R(L(i))$.\n*   The counit $\\epsilon$ exists iff $L \\circ R \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$. This means for every $j \\in [n]$, $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}(j)$, which simplifies to $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n\nThese two conditions define what is known as a Galois connection or an adjunction between the posets $([m], \\le)$ and $([n], \\le)$. The morphism $L$ is the left adjoint and $R$ is the right adjoint.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps.**\nThe problem is now to count the number of pairs of order-preserving maps $(L, R)$ satisfying these two inequalities. A key property of adjoints between posets is that one map uniquely determines the other. We can establish a one-to-one correspondence between such adjunctions and a specific subset of order-preserving maps.\n\nA map between posets is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). Dually, a map is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\n\n*   **Characterizing the left adjoint L:**\n    The poset $[m]$ is a finite total order, so all suprema exist. For any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [m]$, its supremum is its maximum element, $\\sup(S) = \\max(S)$. Any order-preserving map between total orders preserves maxima. The crucial case is the empty set, $\\emptyset$. The supremum of the empty set is the bottom element of the poset.\n    *   In $[m]$, $\\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$.\n    *   In $[n]$, $\\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$.\n    *   For $L$ to preserve suprema, we must have $L(\\sup(\\emptyset)_{\\text{in }[m]}) = \\sup(L(\\emptyset))_{\\text{in }[n]}$.\n    *   This translates to $L(0) = \\sup(\\emptyset)_{\\text{in }[n]} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $L(0) = 0$.\n\n*   **Characterizing the right adjoint R:**\n    Similarly, for $R: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a right adjoint, it must preserve all infima. The infimum of the empty set is the top element of the poset.\n    *   In $[n]$, $\\inf(\\emptyset) = n$.\n    *   In $[m]$, $\\inf(\\emptyset) = m$.\n    *   For $R$ to preserve infima, we must have $R(\\inf(\\emptyset)_{\\text{in }[n]}) = \\inf(R(\\emptyset))_{\\text{in }[m]}$.\n    *   This translates to $R(n) = \\inf(\\emptyset)_{\\text{in }[m]} = m$.\n    *   Therefore, an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if $R(n) = m$.\n\nThis means there is a bijection between the set of adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ and the set of order-preserving maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ with $L(0)=0$. There is also a bijection with the set of order-preserving maps $R: [n] \\to [m]$ with $R(n)=m$. We can count either of these sets.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of such maps.**\nThe question asks for the number of adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. Here, $m=23$ and $n=37$. Let's count the number of possible right adjoints $R$.\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $R(37) = 23$.\nAn order-preserving map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ is a sequence of values $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(37)$ such that:\n$0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le R(37) \\le 23$.\nThe condition $R(37) = 23$ fixes the last value. So we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(36)$ of length 37, where each element is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic stars-and-bars problem. We are choosing 37 numbers (for $R(0)$ through $R(36)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has $23+1=24$ possible values, with replacement, and the order is fixed (non-decreasing). This is equivalent to finding the number of multisets of size $k=37$ from a set of size $c=24$.\n\nThe formula for the number of multisets of size $k$ from a set of size $c$ is:\n$\\binom{k+c-1}{k} = \\binom{37+24-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nAs a check, we can count the number of left adjoints $L: [23] \\to [37]$ with $L(0)=0$.\nThis is a non-decreasing sequence $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ of length 23, where each element is chosen from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (a set of size 38).\nThis is a multiset of size $k=23$ from a set of size $c=38$.\nThe number is $\\binom{k+c-1}{k} = \\binom{23+38-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nSince $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$, both methods yield the same result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of internal adjunctions is the value of this binomial coefficient.\n\n<<<C(60, 23)>>>"
