    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine Andre Vernault's true profession.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks for the true profession of Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in WWII Britain.\n2.  **Identify the key facts provided:**\n    *   He was a Belgian refugee in the UK during WWII.\n    *   He was suspected of being a German spy by UK counterintelligence (MI5).\n    *   The reason for the suspicion was that he concealed his true profession from his interrogators.\n3.  **Break down the problem:** To find the answer, we need to research the historical case of Andre Vernault and MI5. The key is to find out what profession he was hiding that was so unusual or embarrassing that he would risk being mistaken for a spy rather than reveal it.\n4.  **Research the historical account:** Historical records, particularly those declassified from MI5 and detailed in books like Ben Macintyre's \"Agent Zigzag\" and \"A Spy Among Friends,\" describe this specific case.\n5.  **Synthesize the findings:**\n    *   Andre Vernault arrived in Britain in 1940 after fleeing the German invasion of Belgium.\n    *   When interrogated by MI5 officer Dick White, Vernault was evasive and gave a false profession, claiming to be a commercial artist.\n    *   His evasiveness and the implausibility of his cover story led MI5 to believe he was a trained German agent undergoing a test of his nerve.\n    *   After prolonged interrogation and investigation, the truth was discovered. Vernault was not a spy. He was deeply embarrassed by his actual profession, which he felt was undignified and frivolous, especially in the context of a grave war. He feared ridicule and that he would not be taken seriously in his desire to help the war effort.\n6.  **State the true profession:** The profession he was hiding was that of a **lion-tamer**. He had worked in a circus before the war. This unusual and slightly bizarre profession, when revealed, explained his strange behavior and cleared him of suspicion.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **The context is crucial:** The atmosphere of paranoia in 1940 Britain, with the threat of invasion looming, meant that any unusual behavior could be interpreted as espionage.\n*   **Human psychology:** Vernault's motivation was not malice but embarrassment and a misguided sense of dignity. He preferred the serious risk of being shot as a spy over what he perceived as the certainty of being ridiculed as a circus performer.\n*   **The false profession:** It's important to note the profession he *claimed* to have (commercial artist) to understand the deception that led to the suspicion.\n*   **Verification:** The story is a well-documented and often-cited case in the history of MI5, used to illustrate the challenges interrogators faced in distinguishing genuine refugees from actual spies.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the historical case, Andre Vernault's true profession, which he concealed from his interrogators, was a lion-tamer.\n\n<<<Lion-tamer>>>"
