    "### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific Christian theologian who was the *first* to create *specialized terminology* to explain how the \"laws of nature\" could be altered. This terminology needed to be versatile enough to apply to two distinct events:\n    *   A singular, specific miracle: the virgin birth of Jesus.\n    *   A systemic, ongoing change: the alteration of the natural world after the Fall of Man.\n\n2.  **Initial Theological Candidates:** We must consider major figures in Christian history who dealt with the relationship between God, creation, and miracles.\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas:** He distinguished between God's ordinary power (*potentia ordinata*), by which He upholds the natural laws He established, and His absolute power (*potentia absoluta*), by which He can do anything that is not logically contradictory. While this is a powerful framework, it describes God's power *in relation to* the laws, rather than providing terminology for the change *within* nature itself.\n    *   **C.S. Lewis:** A modern theologian who, in his book *Miracles*, argued that miracles are not violations of natural law but are the introduction of a supernatural element into the natural system by its Creator. This is an analogy, not a specific, technical terminology developed in early theology.\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD):** As one of the most influential Church Fathers, Augustine wrote extensively on creation, providence, and miracles. He faced the challenge of explaining how an omnipotent and unchanging God could act in new and miraculous ways within a created order that has its own regularities.\n\n3.  **Focus on Augustine and his Terminology:**\n    *   Augustine developed a specific and highly influential doctrine to address this problem. He borrowed and adapted a concept from Stoic philosophy, Christianizing it for his own theological system.\n    *   The specialized terminology is ***rationes seminales***, which translates to **\"seminal reasons\"** or \"causal seeds/principles.\"\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Application of the Terminology:**\n\n    *   **Point 1: Defining \"Laws of Nature\".** In Augustine's view, the \"laws of nature\" are the normal, predictable unfolding of the *rationes seminales* that God embedded in creation from the very beginning. God created all things in potentiality, as \"seeds\" that would sprout and grow over time according to their pre-programmed nature.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Application to the Virgin Birth.** A miracle like the virgin birth is not, for Augustine, a violation of nature (*contra naturam*). Instead, it is the activation by God of a special \"seminal reason\" that was placed in creation from the beginning but kept latent. This potentiality—for a human to be conceived without a human father—was always part of God's created order, but it was outside the *usual* course of nature. God's miraculous act was to bring this hidden potential to fruition at the right moment. Thus, the miracle is *praeter naturam* (beyond the usual course of nature) but not against God's fundamental creative design.\n\n    *   **Point 3: Application to the Fall.** Augustine's framework is also uniquely applicable to explaining how the laws of nature could have been altered at the Fall. The pre-Fall world (Eden) operated according to one expression of the *rationes seminales*, characterized by harmony. After human sin entered the world, a different set of latent potentialities was triggered—those for decay, death, suffering, and conflict (\"thorns and thistles\"). This represents a systemic shift in how nature operates. The \"laws\" changed because the conditions changed, causing a different set of God's pre-existing \"causal seeds\" to activate. This explains a fundamental change in the natural order without suggesting God had to re-create the world or violate His original plan.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Augustine of Hippo is the theologian who first developed the specialized terminology of *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons) to provide a single, coherent framework for understanding both specific miracles like the virgin birth and systemic changes to natural law like those resulting from the Fall.\n\n***\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
