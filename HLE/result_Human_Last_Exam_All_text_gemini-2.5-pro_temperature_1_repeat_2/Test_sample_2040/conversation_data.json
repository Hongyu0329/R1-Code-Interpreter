    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC).**\nSPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In this process, a high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons) inside a nonlinear optical medium. For this to happen, two fundamental conservation laws must be met:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The energy of the pump photon must equal the sum of the energies of the signal and idler photons ($ħω_p = ħω_s + ħω_i$).\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The momentum of the pump photon must equal the sum of the momenta of the signal and idler photons ($ħ\\vec{k}_p = ħ\\vec{k}_s + ħ\\vec{k}_i$). This is also known as the phase-matching condition.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the material property required for SPDC.**\nSPDC is a *second-order nonlinear optical effect*. The efficiency of such processes is governed by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾ (chi-two). If a material has a χ⁽²⁾ value of zero, it cannot support second-order processes like SPDC or its counterpart, second-harmonic generation (SHG).\n\n**Step 3: Relate the required material property (non-zero χ⁽²⁾) to crystal symmetry.**\nThis is the most critical point. A material can only have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) if its crystal structure lacks **inversion symmetry**.\n*   A crystal structure with **inversion symmetry** is called **centrosymmetric**. In such a material, for every atom at a position (x, y, z) relative to a central point, there is an identical atom at (-x, -y, -z). In centrosymmetric materials, χ⁽²⁾ is strictly zero due to this symmetry.\n*   A crystal structure that lacks inversion symmetry is called **non-centrosymmetric**. Only these materials can have an intrinsic, non-zero χ⁽²⁾ and are thus candidates for exhibiting SPDC.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the crystal structure of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene).**\n\"Borophene\" is not a single, unique structure but rather a class of two-dimensional allotropes of boron. Several different atomic arrangements, or polymorphs, have been predicted theoretically and some have been synthesized on substrates. We need to examine the symmetry of the most common and stable of these polymorphs.\n*   **Common Polymorphs:** The most widely studied borophene structures are the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, which have been successfully grown on silver (Ag) substrates.\n*   **Symmetry of β₁₂ borophene:** This structure consists of a triangular lattice with a regular pattern of hexagonal vacancies. Its space group is *P6/mmm*. This group is centrosymmetric.\n*   **Symmetry of χ₃ borophene:** This structure has a rectangular lattice with a different arrangement of atoms and vacancies. Its space group is *Pmmn*. This group is also centrosymmetric.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the information to answer the question.**\nSince the most common and stable predicted forms of free-standing boron nanosheets (like β₁₂ and χ₃) possess inversion symmetry, they are centrosymmetric. According to the fundamental principles of nonlinear optics, centrosymmetric materials have a second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) of zero. Therefore, ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets of these common phases would not be expected to exhibit intrinsic spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real Nanosheets:** The conclusion above applies to a perfect, flat, and unstrained nanosheet. In reality, factors can break the inversion symmetry and potentially induce a weak second-order response. These factors include:\n    *   **Strain:** Applying non-uniform strain can break the crystal's inversion symmetry.\n    *   **Defects:** Point defects or line defects in the crystal lattice can locally break the symmetry.\n    *   **Electric Fields:** Applying a strong, static DC electric field perpendicular to the nanosheet can artificially break the inversion symmetry and induce a non-zero χ⁽²⁾. This is a well-known effect (Electric-Field-Induced Second-Harmonic generation, or EFISH).\n    *   **Substrate Interaction:** While the question specifies \"free-standing,\" borophene grown on a substrate can have its symmetry broken by the interaction with the underlying atoms. This is not relevant to the specific question but is an important practical point.\n\n2.  **Other Polymorphs:** While the common phases are centrosymmetric, it is theoretically possible that other, less stable borophene polymorphs could be non-centrosymmetric. If such a polymorph were to be isolated, it could potentially exhibit SPDC.\n\n3.  **Comparison to Other 2D Materials:**\n    *   **Graphene:** Like borophene, it is a single-element 2D material. Its honeycomb lattice is centrosymmetric, so pristine graphene does not exhibit SPDC.\n    *   **Monolayer MoS₂ (and other TMDs):** This material is composed of two different elements (Mo and S) and its common 2H phase lacks inversion symmetry in the monolayer form. Consequently, it has a strong χ⁽²⁾ and is well-known for second-harmonic generation and is a candidate for SPDC.\n    *   **Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN):** Similar to MoS₂, the two different atoms (B and N) break the inversion symmetry, giving it a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the crystal symmetry of the most stable and common forms of borophene, they would not be expected to exhibit intrinsic spontaneous parametric downconversion. The phenomenon requires a non-centrosymmetric material, and these borophene structures are centrosymmetric. An SPDC signal could only be expected if the inversion symmetry were broken by external means like strain, defects, or an applied electric field.\n\n<<<No>>>"
