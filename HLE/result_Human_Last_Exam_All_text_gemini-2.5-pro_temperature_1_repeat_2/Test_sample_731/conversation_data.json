    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Group Structure**\n\nThe group in question is the semidihedral group of size 512. This group is denoted as $SD_{512}$ or, more generally, $SD_{2^n}$ where $2^n = 512$, so $n=9$.\n\nThe presentation of the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ is:\n$G = SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$\n\nFor our specific case, $n=9$:\n$G = SD_{2^9} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^8} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^7-1} \\rangle$\nThis simplifies to:\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$\n\nThe elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$, and $r^i s$ for $0 \\le i < 256$. The order of the group is $2 \\times 256 = 512$.\n\n**Step 2: Define Power Subgroup**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a **power subgroup** if it is the image of some power map on $G$. That is, there exists an integer $k$ such that $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Exponent of the Group**\n\nThe number of distinct power subgroups is determined by the divisors of the exponent of the group, $\\exp(G)$. The exponent is the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $g^m = 1$ for all $g \\in G$. The set of power subgroups is $\\{ G^d \\mid d \\text{ is a positive divisor of } \\exp(G) \\}$.\n\nLet's find the orders of the elements in $G = SD_{2^9}$:\n*   **Elements of the form $r^i$**: The order of $r$ is 256. The order of $r^i$ is $o(r^i) = \\frac{256}{\\gcd(i, 256)}$. These orders can be any power of 2 up to 256 (i.e., $2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^8$).\n*   **Elements of the form $r^i s$**: Let's find the order of $g = r^i s$. We first compute $g^2$:\n    $g^2 = (r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s$. From the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we can derive $sr^i = r^{127i}s$.\n    So, $g^2 = r^i (sr^i) s = r^i (r^{127i}s) s = r^i r^{127i} s^2 = r^{128i}$.\n    *   If $i$ is even ($i=2m$), then $g^2 = r^{128(2m)} = r^{256m} = (r^{256})^m = 1^m = 1$. The order of $g$ is 2.\n    *   If $i$ is odd ($i=2m+1$), then $g^2 = r^{128(2m+1)} = r^{256m}r^{128} = r^{128}$. Since $o(r^{128}) = \\frac{256}{\\gcd(128, 256)} = \\frac{256}{128} = 2$, we have $(g^2)^2 = (r^{128})^2 = 1$. Thus, $g^4=1$. The order of $g$ is 4.\n\nThe possible orders of elements in $G$ are powers of 2, from $2^0=1$ up to $2^8=256$.\nThe exponent of the group is the least common multiple of all element orders:\n$\\exp(G) = \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 256) = 256 = 2^8$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nWe need to compute $G^k$ for all positive divisors $k$ of $\\exp(G) = 256$. The divisors are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$. These are of the form $2^j$ for $j=0, 1, ..., 8$.\n\nLet's compute $G^{2^j}$ for $j=0, ..., 8$:\n$G^{2^j} = \\{ g^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G \\} = \\{ (r^i)^{2^j} \\mid 0 \\le i < 256 \\} \\cup \\{ (r^i s)^{2^j} \\mid 0 \\le i < 256 \\}$\n\n*   **For $j=0$ (k=1):**\n    $G^1 = G = SD_{2^9}$. This is a non-cyclic group of order 512.\n\n*   **For $j=1$ (k=2):**\n    $G^2 = \\{ (r^i)^2 \\} \\cup \\{ (r^i s)^2 \\}$.\n    The set $\\{ (r^i)^2 \\mid 0 \\le i < 256 \\} = \\{ r^{2i} \\}$ forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$ of order 128.\n    The set $\\{ (r^i s)^2 \\}$ consists of $\\{1\\}$ (for even $i$) and $\\{r^{128}\\}$ (for odd $i$). So this set is $\\{1, r^{128}\\}$.\n    Since $r^{128} = (r^2)^{64}$, the element $r^{128}$ is already in $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    Therefore, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 128.\n\n*   **For $j \\ge 2$ (k=$2^j \\ge 4$):**\n    $G^{2^j} = \\{ (r^i)^{2^j} \\} \\cup \\{ (r^i s)^{2^j} \\}$.\n    The set $\\{ (r^i)^{2^j} \\}$ forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$. Its order is $256 / 2^j = 2^{8-j}$.\n    For the elements $(r^i s)$, their order is either 2 or 4. Since $k=2^j$ with $j \\ge 2$ is a multiple of 4, $(r^i s)^k = 1$ for all $i$.\n    So, the set $\\{ (r^i s)^{2^j} \\}$ is just the trivial element $\\{1\\}$.\n    Therefore, for $j \\ge 2$, $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle \\cup \\{1\\} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: List and Count the Distinct Subgroups**\n\nLet's list the power subgroups we have found:\n1.  $G^1 = G = SD_{2^9}$ (non-cyclic, order 512)\n2.  $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 128)\n3.  $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 64)\n4.  $G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 32)\n5.  $G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 16)\n6.  $G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 8)\n7.  $G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 4)\n8.  $G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 2)\n9.  $G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\nThese 9 subgroups are all distinct. We can verify this by checking their orders: 512, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. Since all the orders are different, the subgroups must be distinct.\n\nThus, there are 9 distinct power subgroups."
