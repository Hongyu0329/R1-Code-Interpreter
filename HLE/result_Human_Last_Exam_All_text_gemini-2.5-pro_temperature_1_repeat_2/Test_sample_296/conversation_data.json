    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the structure of the Grigorchuk group, particularly its quotients and normal subgroups.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the task:** We need to find the total number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, denoted by $\\Gamma$.\n\n2.  **Relating subgroups to group actions and quotients:** A subgroup $K$ of index 4 in a group $\\Gamma$ gives rise to a transitive action of $\\Gamma$ on the set of 4 left cosets $\\Gamma/K$. This action is described by a homomorphism $\\rho: \\Gamma \\to S_4$, where $S_4$ is the symmetric group on 4 elements. The image of this homomorphism, $Im(\\rho)$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The kernel of the homomorphism is the core of $K$, defined as $\\text{Core}_\\Gamma(K) = \\cap_{g \\in \\Gamma} gKg^{-1}$. The core is the largest normal subgroup of $\\Gamma$ contained in $K$. By the first isomorphism theorem, we have $\\Gamma/\\text{Core}_\\Gamma(K) \\cong Im(\\rho)$.\n\n3.  **Identifying possible quotient groups:** A key property of the Grigorchuk group is that all its finite quotients are finite 2-groups (i.e., their order is a power of 2). The transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $C_4$ (order 4), $V_4$ (the Klein four-group, order 4), $D_4$ (the dihedral group of order 8), $A_4$ (order 12), and $S_4$ (order 24). Since the quotient must be a 2-group, the only possibilities for $\\Gamma/\\text{Core}_\\Gamma(K)$ are $C_4$, $V_4$, and $D_4$.\n\n4.  **Eliminating the $C_4$ case:** The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is known to be $\\Gamma_{ab} = \\Gamma/[\\Gamma, \\Gamma] \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$. Any abelian quotient of $\\Gamma$ must be a quotient of $\\Gamma_{ab}$. Since every non-identity element in $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ has order 2, it cannot have the cyclic group $C_4$ as a quotient. Therefore, $\\Gamma/\\text{Core}_\\Gamma(K)$ cannot be $C_4$.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the remaining cases:** We are left with two possibilities for the quotient group $\\Gamma/\\text{Core}_\\Gamma(K)$.\n\n    *   **Case 1: $\\Gamma/\\text{Core}_\\Gamma(K) \\cong V_4$.**\n        In this case, the core $N = \\text{Core}_\\Gamma(K)$ has index 4 in $\\Gamma$. Since $N$ is a subgroup of $K$ and they have the same index, we must have $K=N$. This means that $K$ is a normal subgroup of index 4. The number of such subgroups is the number of distinct kernels of surjective homomorphisms from $\\Gamma$ to $V_4$.\n        This can be calculated using the abelianization:\n        *   The number of homomorphisms Hom($\\Gamma, V_4$) is equal to Hom($\\Gamma_{ab}, V_4$) = Hom($(C_2)^3, (C_2)^2$). This is the number of $2 \\times 3$ matrices over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$, which is $2^{2 \\times 3} = 64$.\n        *   We are interested in surjective homomorphisms (epimorphisms). The number of non-surjective maps is the sum of maps whose image is the trivial group (1 map) and maps whose image is a subgroup of order 2 (a line). There are 3 subgroups of order 2 in $V_4$. For each, there are $2^3-1=7$ non-trivial maps from $(C_2)^3$ to it. So, non-surjective maps = $1 + 3 \\times 7 = 22$.\n        *   Number of epimorphisms = $64 - 22 = 42$.\n        *   Two epimorphisms have the same kernel if they differ by an automorphism of the target group $V_4$. The group Aut($V_4$) has order 6.\n        *   The number of distinct kernels, and thus the number of normal subgroups of index 4, is $42 / 6 = 7$.\n        So, there are **7** normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n    *   **Case 2: $\\Gamma/\\text{Core}_\\Gamma(K) \\cong D_4$.**\n        In this case, the core $N = \\text{Core}_\\Gamma(K)$ has index 8 in $\\Gamma$. The subgroup $K$ contains $N$, and by the correspondence theorem, $K/N$ is a subgroup of $\\Gamma/N \\cong D_4$. The index of $K/N$ in $\\Gamma/N$ is $[\\Gamma/N : K/N] = [\\Gamma : K] = 4$. Since $|\\Gamma/N|=8$, the order of the subgroup $K/N$ must be $|D_4|/4 = 8/4=2$.\n        So, we need to count subgroups of order 2 in $D_4$. The group $D_4$ has 5 elements of order 2, which generate 5 distinct subgroups of order 2.\n        *   One of these subgroups is the center of $D_4$, $Z(D_4) \\cong C_2$. This subgroup is normal in $D_4$. The corresponding subgroup $K_0$ in $\\Gamma$ (containing $N$) is normal in $\\Gamma$. The quotient $\\Gamma/K_0$ is isomorphic to $D_4/Z(D_4) \\cong V_4$. Thus, $K_0$ is a normal subgroup of index 4 and has already been counted in our set of 7.\n        *   The other 4 subgroups of order 2 in $D_4$ are not normal. The corresponding subgroups $K_1, K_2, K_3, K_4$ in $\\Gamma$ are not normal. Their core is $N$, which has index 8, so they are distinct from the 7 normal subgroups.\n\n6.  **Counting the $D_4$ quotients:** The analysis above shows that for each normal subgroup $N$ of $\\Gamma$ with quotient $\\Gamma/N \\cong D_4$, we obtain 4 non-normal subgroups of index 4. A standard result in the theory of the Grigorchuk group is that there is exactly one normal subgroup of $\\Gamma$ that has $D_4$ as its quotient. This is the stabilizer of the second level of the binary tree, denoted $Stab_\\Gamma(2)$.\n    Therefore, there is only one such $N$, which gives rise to **4** non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the numbers from the disjoint cases:\n    *   Number of normal subgroups of index 4 = 7.\n    *   Number of non-normal subgroups of index 4 = 4.\n    *   Total number of subgroups = 7 + 4 = 11.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   The fact that any finite quotient of $\\Gamma$ is a 2-group is a critical, non-trivial property.\n*   The abelianization of $\\Gamma$ being $(C_2)^3$ is essential for counting the abelian quotients.\n*   The argument hinges on the fact that there is a unique normal subgroup $N$ for which $\\Gamma/N \\cong D_4$. This is a known structural result about the Grigorchuk group.\n*   We must distinguish between counting all subgroups and counting conjugacy classes of subgroups. The question asks for the former.\n*   The subgroups found in Case 1 (normal) are distinct from the non-normal subgroups found in Case 2 because a subgroup is normal if and only if it equals its core. For the non-normal subgroups, the core has index 8 while the subgroup has index 4.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nNumber of normal subgroups of index 4: 7\nNumber of non-normal subgroups of index 4: 4\nTotal = 7 + 4 = 11\n\n<<<11>>>"
