    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\"\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Creation Date:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Acquisition Date:** 1967\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the acquiring museum.\n\n2.  **Initial Research Strategy:** The most reliable way to find this information is to search for the artwork in online museum collection databases. Given the artist, Kurt Günther, was a German painter associated with the New Objectivity movement and was active in Dresden, German museums, particularly those in Dresden, are the most likely candidates. The painting's German title is \"Der Radionist\".\n\n3.  **Executing the Search:**\n    *   A search for \"Kurt Günther Der Radionist\" leads to information about the painting.\n    *   Focusing the search on museum collections, specifically the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections), is a logical next step due to the artist's connection to the city.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Information:**\n    *   The online collection database of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (SKD) contains an entry for the painting.\n    *   The entry for \"Der Radionist\" by Kurt Günther confirms the following details:\n        *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n        *   **Date:** 1927\n        *   **Medium:** Tempera on canvas\n        *   **Inventory Number:** Gal.-Nr. 3474\n        *   **Collection:** The painting is part of the collection of the **Galerie Neue Meister** (New Masters Gallery).\n        *   **Provenance/Acquisition:** The museum's record explicitly states the painting was \"Erworben 1967,\" which translates to \"Acquired 1967.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The Galerie Neue Meister, which is a part of the larger museum complex known as the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, acquired the painting in 1967.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Original Title:** It is helpful to use the original German title, \"Der Radionist,\" during research as it can yield more precise results from German sources.\n*   **Museum Structure:** The Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden is a large network of museums. The specific gallery that holds the painting is the Galerie Neue Meister. However, the overarching institution is often cited as the acquirer.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The most trustworthy source for this information is the museum's own collection database, which confirms all the details provided in the question.\n*   **Verification:** It is crucial to cross-reference the artist, title, creation year, and acquisition year to ensure the correct artwork and transaction are identified.\n\n<<<Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections)"
