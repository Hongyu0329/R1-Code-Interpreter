    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:**\n    The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula expresses Z = log(e^X * e^Y) as a series of nested commutators of X and Y.\n    Z = Z₁(X,Y) + Z₂(X,Y) + ... + Zₙ(X,Y) + ...\n    Each term Zₙ(X,Y) is a homogeneous Lie polynomial of degree n. The \"order\" of a term corresponds to its degree n. We are interested in the terms of order n=10, i.e., Z₁₀(X,Y).\n\n2.  **Nature of the Coefficients:**\n    Z₁₀(X,Y) is an element of the 10th graded component of the free Lie algebra generated by X and Y, which we denote as L₁₀(X,Y). This space is a vector space, and Z₁₀ can be written as a linear combination of basis vectors.\n    Z₁₀(X,Y) = c₁B₁ + c₂B₂ + ... + cₖBₖ\n    where {Bᵢ} is a basis for the relevant vector space and {cᵢ} are the coefficients. The \"number of nonzero coefficients\" is the number of basis vectors needed to express Z₁₀. It is a known property of the BCH formula that for a basis adapted to the symmetries of the problem, all coefficients are non-zero. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the dimension of the vector space to which Z₁₀(X,Y) belongs.\n\n3.  **Symmetry of the BCH Terms:**\n    The BCH formula has a fundamental symmetry property: Z(X,Y) = -Z(-Y,-X). Let's see how this affects the homogeneous component Zₙ(X,Y):\n    Zₙ(X,Y) = -Zₙ(-Y,-X)\n    Since Zₙ is homogeneous of degree n, Zₙ(αY, αX) = αⁿZₙ(Y,X). Setting α=-1:\n    Zₙ(-Y,-X) = (-1)ⁿZₙ(Y,X)\n    Substituting this back into the symmetry equation:\n    Zₙ(X,Y) = -((-1)ⁿ Zₙ(Y,X)) = (-1)ⁿ⁺¹ Zₙ(Y,X)\n    For order n=10 (which is even), this becomes:\n    Z₁₀(X,Y) = (-1)¹⁰⁺¹ Z₁₀(Y,X) = -Z₁₀(Y,X)\n    This means that Z₁₀(X,Y) is an *anti-symmetric* Lie polynomial under the exchange of X and Y. It must lie in the anti-symmetric subspace of L₁₀(X,Y), which we denote L₁₀⁻. Our goal is to find the dimension of this subspace, dim(L₁₀⁻).\n\n4.  **Calculating the Dimension of the Total Space L₁₀(X,Y):**\n    The dimension of the n-th component of the free Lie algebra on k generators is given by Witt's formula:\n    dim(Lₙ(k)) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)\n    Here, n=10 and we have k=2 generators (X and Y).\n    *   The divisors of 10 are d = {1, 2, 5, 10}.\n    *   The values of the Möbius function μ(d) are: μ(1)=1, μ(2)=-1, μ(5)=-1, μ(10)=μ(2*5)=μ(2)μ(5)=(-1)(-1)=1.\n    *   Plugging these into Witt's formula:\n        dim(L₁₀(2)) = (1/10) * [μ(1)2¹⁰/¹ + μ(2)2¹⁰/² + μ(5)2¹⁰/⁵ + μ(10)2¹⁰/¹⁰]\n        dim(L₁₀(2)) = (1/10) * [1 * 2¹⁰ + (-1) * 2⁵ + (-1) * 2² + 1 * 2¹]\n        dim(L₁₀(2)) = (1/10) * [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]\n        dim(L₁₀(2)) = (1/10) * [990] = 99.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Dimension of the Anti-symmetric Subspace L₁₀⁻:**\n    The free Lie algebra L₁₀ decomposes into a direct sum of its symmetric (L₁₀⁺) and anti-symmetric (L₁₀⁻) subspaces. The dimensions are given by:\n    dim(Lₙ⁻) = (1/2) * [dim(Lₙ) - χₙ(σ)]\n    where χₙ(σ) is the trace (character) of the swapping operator σ (which maps X to Y and Y to X) on the space Lₙ.\n    The formula for the character is:\n    χₙ(g) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * (Tr_V(gᵈ))^(n/d)\n    where V is the space of generators span{X,Y}.\n    *   We need the trace of powers of σ on V.\n        *   σ(X)=Y, σ(Y)=X. The matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Tr_V(σ) = 0.\n        *   σ² is the identity operator. Tr_V(σ²) = Tr(I₂) = 2.\n        *   For any d, Tr_V(σᵈ) = 0 if d is odd, and Tr_V(σᵈ) = 2 if d is even.\n    *   Now we calculate χ₁₀(σ) for n=10:\n        χ₁₀(σ) = (1/10) * [μ(1)(Tr_V(σ))¹⁰ + μ(2)(Tr_V(σ²))⁵ + μ(5)(Tr_V(σ⁵))² + μ(10)(Tr_V(σ¹⁰))¹]\n        χ₁₀(σ) = (1/10) * [1 * (0)¹⁰ + (-1) * (2)⁵ + (-1) * (0)² + 1 * (2)¹]\n        χ₁₀(σ) = (1/10) * [0 - 32 + 0 + 2]\n        χ₁₀(σ) = (1/10) * [-30] = -3.\n    *   Finally, we find the dimension of the anti-symmetric subspace:\n        dim(L₁₀⁻) = (1/2) * [dim(L₁₀(2)) - χ₁₀(σ)]\n        dim(L₁₀⁻) = (1/2) * [99 - (-3)]\n        dim(L₁₀⁻) = (1/2) * [102] = 51.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrase \"number of nonzero coefficients\" is key. It implies counting the number of basis vectors with non-zero weights, which is equivalent to the dimension of the subspace containing the result, assuming a well-behaved basis.\n*   **Symmetry is Crucial:** The symmetry property Zₙ(X,Y) = (-1)ⁿ⁺¹ Zₙ(Y,X) is the central point that restricts the solution to a smaller subspace. Forgetting this would lead to the incorrect answer of 99.\n*   **Correct Formulas:** Using the correct Witt's formula for the dimension and the correct character formula for the subspace dimension is essential. Errors in these formulas (e.g., in the Möbius function or traces) would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The arithmetic must be performed carefully, especially with powers and negative signs.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the anti-symmetric subspace of the free Lie algebra of degree 10 on two generators, which is 51.\n\n<<<51>>>"
