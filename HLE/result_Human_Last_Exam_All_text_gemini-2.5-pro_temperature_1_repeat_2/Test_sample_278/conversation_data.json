    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve in the first interval, $t \\in [0, \\pi]$.**\nIn this interval, the parameter $b=1$. The equations for the curve are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\sin t$\nThis is the standard parameterization for a circle. Squaring and adding the equations gives $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\nAs $t$ varies from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n*   $x = \\cos t$ varies from $\\cos(0) = 1$ to $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n*   $y = \\sin t$ varies from $\\sin(0) = 0$ to $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ and back to $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$. Since $\\sin t \\ge 0$ in this interval, this part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of radius 1, centered at the origin.\n*   For this part of the figure, the range of x-coordinates is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y-coordinates is $[0, 1]$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the parametric curve in the second interval, $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$.**\nIn this interval, the parameter $b=5$. The equations for the curve are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5\\sin t$\nThis is the parameterization for an ellipse. We can write $\\frac{y}{5} = \\sin t$. Squaring and adding with $x = \\cos t$ gives $x^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, or $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$.\nAs $t$ varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$:\n*   $x = \\cos t$ varies from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$.\n*   $y = 5\\sin t$ varies from $5\\sin(\\pi) = 0$ to $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ and back to $5\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$. Since $\\sin t \\le 0$ in this interval, this part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5, centered at the origin.\n*   For this part of the figure, the range of x-coordinates is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y-coordinates is $[-5, 0]$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the overall dimensions (bounding box) of the complete figure.**\nTo find the smallest square that outcircles the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum x and y values for the entire curve.\n*   **x-dimension:** Combining the ranges from both parts, the minimum x-value is $x_{min} = -1$ and the maximum x-value is $x_{max} = 1$. The total width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **y-dimension:** Combining the ranges from both parts, the minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$ (from the ellipse part) and the maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$ (from the circle part). The total height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the side length of the smallest circumscribing square.**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. The smallest square that can contain this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n*   Side length of the square, $S = \\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the area of the square.**\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\n*   Area = $S^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to correctly identify that the parameter `b` creates a piecewise-defined curve, consisting of two different shapes (a semi-circle and a semi-ellipse).\n*   The bounding box of the figure is determined by the absolute maximum and minimum coordinates over the entire domain of $t$.\n*   The \"smallest square that outcircles the figure\" is the smallest square that completely contains the figure. Its side length is determined by the larger dimension of the figure's bounding box.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe figure extends from $x=-1$ to $x=1$, so its width is 2.\nThe figure extends from $y=-5$ to $y=1$, so its height is 6.\nThe side of the smallest circumscribing square must be $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\nThe area is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
