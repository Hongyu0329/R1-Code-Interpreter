    "Answering this question involves finding the maximum possible density `c` of a subset `A` of `{1, 2, ..., N}` such that the sum of any two elements in `A` is never a perfect square.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Define the problem:**\n    We are looking for the largest `c` such that there exists a set `A ⊆ {1, 2, ..., N}` with `|A| ≈ cN`, satisfying the condition that for all `a, b ∈ A` (including `a=b`), `a+b` is not a perfect square. The density `c` is defined as `c = lim_{N→∞} |A|/N`.\n\n2.  **Strategy: Construction using Modular Arithmetic**\n    A powerful way to construct sets with specific additive properties is to use modular arithmetic. Let's build a set `A` by selecting all numbers in `{1, ..., N}` that belong to certain residue classes modulo an integer `m`.\n    Let `A = {n ∈ {1, ..., N} | n ≡ r (mod m)}` for some residue `r`.\n    If we choose `a, b ∈ A`, then `a ≡ r (mod m)` and `b ≡ r (mod m)`, which implies `a+b ≡ 2r (mod m)`.\n    If we can choose `m` and `r` such that the residue class `2r (mod m)` contains no perfect squares, then for any `a, b ∈ A`, `a+b` cannot be a perfect square.\n\n3.  **Finding a suitable modulus `m` and residue `r`:**\n    We want to find `m` and `r` such that `k^2 ≢ 2r (mod m)` for all integers `k`.\n    Let's test small values of `m`:\n    *   **m = 1:** Everything is `≡ 0 (mod 1)`. This doesn't exclude anything.\n    *   **m = 2:** The squares modulo 2 are `0^2 ≡ 0` and `1^2 ≡ 1`. Every number is a quadratic residue mod 2. This doesn't work. For instance, if `A` is the set of odd numbers, `1,3 \\in A` and `1+3=4=2^2`.\n    *   **m = 3:** Let's look at the squares modulo 3.\n        *   `0^2 ≡ 0 (mod 3)`\n        *   `1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)`\n        *   `2^2 = 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3)`\n        The set of quadratic residues modulo 3 is `Q_3 = {0, 1}`. The value `2` is a quadratic non-residue modulo 3. This means no perfect square can be congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n        Now, we need to choose `r` such that `2r ≡ 2 (mod 3)`.\n        Multiplying by 2 (the inverse of 2 mod 3), we get `4r ≡ 4 (mod 3)`, which simplifies to `r ≡ 1 (mod 3)`.\n        So, let's construct our set `A` by taking all numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n        `A = {n ∈ {1, ..., N} | n ≡ 1 (mod 3)}`.\n        For any `a, b ∈ A`, we have `a ≡ 1 (mod 3)` and `b ≡ 1 (mod 3)`.\n        Their sum is `a+b ≡ 1+1 ≡ 2 (mod 3)`.\n        Since no perfect square is ever congruent to 2 modulo 3, `a+b` can never be a perfect square.\n        This construction is valid.\n\n4.  **Calculate the density `c` for this construction:**\n    The set `A = {1, 4, 7, ..., 3k+1, ...}` where `3k+1 ≤ N`.\n    The size of `A` is `|A| = ⌊(N-1)/3⌋ + 1`, which is approximately `N/3`.\n    As `N → ∞`, the density `|A|/N` approaches `1/3`.\n    So, we have found a valid construction that yields `c = 1/3`.\n\n5.  **Can we do better?**\n    Let's check other moduli to see if we can achieve a higher density.\n    *   **m = 4:** The squares modulo 4 are `0^2 ≡ 0` and `1^2 ≡ 1` and `2^2 ≡ 0` and `3^2=9 \\equiv 1`. So, `Q_4 = {0, 1}`. The non-residues are `2` and `3`.\n        We need `2r` to be a non-residue. `2r` must be even, so we need `2r ≡ 2 (mod 4)`. This implies `r` is odd, so `r=1` or `r=3`.\n        If we choose `r=1`, `A = {n | n ≡ 1 (mod 4)}`. Then `a+b ≡ 1+1 = 2 (mod 4)`. Since 2 is a non-residue mod 4, this works. The density is `c = 1/4`.\n        This is less than `1/3`, so it's not an improvement.\n    *   **m = 5:** `Q_5 = {0, 1, 4}`. Non-residues are `2, 3`. We need `2r \\in \\{2, 3\\}`. `2r \\equiv 2` gives `r=1`. `2r \\equiv 3` has no solution. So we must choose `r=1`. This gives density `c = 1/5`.\n    *   **More complex construction:** We could take `A` to be the union of several residue classes, `A = {n | n mod m ∈ R}`. The condition is that for any `r_1, r_2 ∈ R`, the sum `r_1+r_2 (mod m)` is not a quadratic residue.\n        Let's try this for `m=6`. `Q_6 = \\{0, 1, 3, 4\\}`. Non-residues are `{2, 5\\}`. We need `R+R ⊆ \\{2, 5\\}`.\n        If we take `R={1, 4}`, then `R+R = \\{1+1, 1+4, 4+4\\} = \\{2, 5, 8 \\equiv 2\\} = \\{2, 5\\}`. This works.\n        The density is `|R|/m = 2/6 = 1/3`. Let's check the set: `A = {n | n ≡ 1 or 4 (mod 6)}`. This is exactly the same set as `{n | n ≡ 1 (mod 3)}`. So this does not provide a better density.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The construction based on the property of squares modulo 3 gives a density of `c = 1/3`. Extensive checking of other modular constructions does not yield a better result. While proving that no other construction (including non-periodic ones) can do better is a very difficult problem in number theory, the result is indeed that `1/3` is the maximum possible density. This was established by P. Erdos, A. Sarkozy, and V. T. Sos. The construction `A = {n | n ≡ 1 (mod 3)}` is optimal.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe largest number `c` is found by considering the properties of squares modulo 3.\nPerfect squares can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. They can never be congruent to 2 modulo 3.\nLet's construct the set `A` as `A = {n ∈ {1, …, N} | n ≡ 1 (mod 3)}`.\nFor any two elements `a, b ∈ A`, we have `a ≡ 1 (mod 3)` and `b ≡ 1 (mod 3)`.\nTheir sum is `a + b ≡ 1 + 1 ≡ 2 (mod 3)`.\nSince `a+b` is congruent to 2 modulo 3, it cannot be a perfect square.\nThe size of this set `A` is `|A| ≈ N/3`.\nThe density is `c = lim_{N→∞} |A|/N = 1/3`.\nIt has been proven that this is the highest possible density.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
