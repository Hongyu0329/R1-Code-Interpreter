    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the core requirements of the question.\nThe question asks for a specific piece of information based on several criteria:\n1.  **The source text:** Homer's *Iliad*.\n2.  **The object:** A \"historical mountain,\" meaning a real, physical mountain that exists today.\n3.  **The ranking:** The \"tallest\" among the candidates.\n4.  **The exclusion:** Mount Olympus must not be the answer.\n\n### Step 2: List the mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*.\nWe must search the text of the *Iliad* for explicit mentions of mountains. The primary candidates are:\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, mentioned frequently throughout the epic. It serves as the benchmark but must be excluded from the final answer. (Location: Greece; Height: 2,918 m / 9,573 ft).\n*   **Mount Ida:** Located near Troy, this is a very important mountain in the epic. Zeus often sits on its highest peak, Gargarus, to watch the battle between the Achaeans and Trojans. (Location: Turkey; Modern Name: Kaz Dağı; Height: 1,774 m / 5,820 ft).\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Peak: Saos/Fengari):** In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits atop this island mountain to watch the battle, as it offers a clear view of Troy and the sea. (Location: Greece, Island of Samothrace; Height: 1,611 m / 5,285 ft).\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly is mentioned as the source of the ash-wood for Achilles' mighty spear, which was a gift from the centaur Chiron. (Location: Greece; Height: 1,624 m / 5,328 ft).\n*   **Mount Athos:** This mountain on the Chalkidiki peninsula is mentioned by name in Book 14 as a landmark that the goddess Hera flies over on her journey to Mount Ida. (Location: Greece; Height: 2,033 m / 6,670 ft).\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** This mountain in Lydia (modern-day Turkey) is mentioned in a geographical simile in Book 2. The text describes the mustering of troops as being like flocks of birds in the \"Asian meadow, about the streams of the Caystrius,\" a region historically defined by Mount Tmolus. (Location: Turkey; Modern Name: Bozdağ; Height: 2,157 m / 7,077 ft).\n\n### Step 3: Compare the elevations of the candidate mountains (excluding Mount Olympus).\nNow we list the identified mountains and their respective heights to find the tallest.\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,157 m (7,077 ft)\n2.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m (6,670 ft)\n3.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m (5,820 ft)\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m (5,328 ft)\n5.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m (5,285 ft)\n\n### Step 4: Final determination.\nBy comparing the elevations, we can see that Mount Tmolus is the tallest among the mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Defining \"Mentioned\":** It is important to consider any reference, whether it's a key location for the plot (like Ida), a landmark on a journey (like Athos), or a geographical marker in a simile (like Tmolus). All constitute a \"mention\" in the text.\n*   **Historical vs. Mythological:** All the mountains listed are real, physical locations, satisfying the \"historical mountain\" criterion.\n*   **Accuracy of Heights:** The elevations are based on modern geological surveys. While minor variations exist between sources, the relative order of the mountains' heights is well-established.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* besides Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
