    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the atomic composition of the molecule.**\n*   The molecule is toluene.\n*   The chemical formula is C₇H₈.\n*   This means the molecule consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. A \"contracted Gaussian function\" (CGF) is another term for a basis function. We need to count the number of basis functions for each atom.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a Carbon (C) atom.**\nCarbon is a \"heavy atom\" (non-hydrogen). Its electronic structure is 1s²2s²2p².\n*   **Core orbital (1s):** The `6` in 6-31G specifies that the core 1s orbital is described by a single CGF. This gives **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence orbitals (2s and 2p):** The `31` indicates that the valence shell is split into two parts (a \"double-zeta\" valence description).\n    *   **Inner Valence Part (`3`):** This is described by one set of CGFs. It includes one s-type CGF (for the 2s orbital) and one set of p-type CGFs (for the 2p orbitals). A p-type set consists of three functions: pₓ, pᵧ, and p₂. So, this part contributes 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer Valence Part (`1`):** This is described by a second, more diffuse set of CGFs. It also includes one s-type CGF and one set of p-type CGFs. This part contributes 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a Hydrogen (H) atom.**\nHydrogen has no core electrons, only a 1s valence electron. The 6-31G basis set for hydrogen is also split-valence.\n*   **Valence orbital (1s):** The `31` notation applies here.\n    *   **Inner Valence Part (`3`):** This is described by one s-type CGF. This gives **1 CGF**.\n    *   **Outer Valence Part (`1`):** This is described by a second s-type CGF. This gives **1 CGF**.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the toluene molecule (C₇H₈).**\n*   Total CGFs = (Number of C atoms × CGFs per C) + (Number of H atoms × CGFs per H)\n*   Total CGFs = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n*   Total CGFs = 63 + 16\n*   Total CGFs = 79\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Atom Count:** Correctly identify the number of atoms of each element in the molecule (7 C, 8 H).\n*   **Basis Set Interpretation:** Understand that 6-31G splits the valence shell into two parts for all atoms.\n*   **p-Orbitals:** A critical point is to remember that each p-shell in the basis set (e.g., the inner valence p-functions) contributes three individual CGFs (pₓ, pᵧ, p₂).\n*   **Hydrogen Exception:** Remember that hydrogen has no core orbitals, so the `6` does not apply to it. Its basis set is determined only by the split-valence `31` part.\n*   **Terminology:** A \"contracted Gaussian function\" is the same as a \"basis function\" in this context.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as follows:\n*   Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms: 7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs\n*   Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs\n*   Total: 63 + 16 = 79 CGFs\n\n<<<79>>>"
