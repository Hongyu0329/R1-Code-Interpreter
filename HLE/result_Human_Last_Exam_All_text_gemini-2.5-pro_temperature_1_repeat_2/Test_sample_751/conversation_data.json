    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form for the given discrete-time system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nThe given discrete-time system is:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nWith matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0],\n     [2, 1, 1],\n     [0, 2, 0]]\n\nC = [[0, 1, 0],\n     [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe goal is to find the matrix C_o in the observer canonical form (A_o, C_o) which is related to the original system by a similarity transformation x = T^{-1}x_o. The new system matrices are A_o = T A T^{-1} and C_o = C T^{-1}.\n\nThe problem suggests using duality. The principle of duality states that the observability of a system (A, C) is equivalent to the controllability of its dual system (A^T, C^T). The observer canonical form of (A, C) is the transpose of the controllable canonical form of (A^T, C^T).\n\n**2. Analyze the Observability of the System**\n\nFirst, we must check if the system is observable. A system is observable if its observability matrix Q_o has full rank (rank n, where n is the dimension of the state vector x). Here, n=3.\n\nThe observability matrix is given by:\nQ_o = [C; C*A; C*A^2; ...; C*A^(n-1)]\n\nLet's denote the rows of C as c1^T and c2^T:\nc1^T = [0, 1, 0]\nc2^T = [1, 1, 0]\n\nNow, we compute the necessary components:\n*   C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n*   C*A = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [[2, 1, 1], [3, 2, 1]]\n\nThe full observability matrix Q_o would be a 6x3 matrix. We only need to find n=3 linearly independent rows from it. Let's form a matrix from the first three distinct row vectors we can generate: c1^T, c2^T, and c1^T*A.\nM = [c1^T; c2^T; c1^T*A] = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]]\n\nLet's calculate the determinant of M:\ndet(M) = 0 * (1*1 - 0*1) - 1 * (1*1 - 0*2) + 0 * (1*1 - 1*2) = -1 * (1) = -1\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the matrix M has rank 3. This means the system is observable.\n\n**3. Determine the Observability Indices**\n\nThe structure of the observer canonical form depends on the observability indices (nu_1, nu_2, ...). To find them, we check for linear independence by adding rows from Q_o one by one in a specific order: c1^T, c2^T, c1^T*A, c2^T*A, ...\n\n1.  Select c1^T = [0, 1, 0]. This is one linearly independent (LI) vector.\n2.  Add c2^T = [1, 1, 0]. The set {[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]} is LI. We now have 2 LI vectors.\n3.  Add c1^T*A = [2, 1, 1]. As shown in step 2, the set {[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]} is LI. We now have 3 LI vectors, which is equal to n.\n\nWe stop here. Now we count how many vectors were derived from each original row of C:\n*   From c1^T: We used c1^T and c1^T*A. That's 2 vectors. So, nu_1 = 2.\n*   From c2^T: We used c2^T. That's 1 vector. So, nu_2 = 1.\n\nThe observability indices are (2, 1). The sum of the indices is 2 + 1 = 3, which equals n, as required.\n\n**4. Determine the Observer Canonical Form using Duality**\n\nThe structure of the C_o matrix in the observer canonical form is directly determined by the observability indices. The duality principle helps us understand this structure.\n\nThe controllable canonical form for a dual system with controllability indices (mu_1, mu_2) = (2, 1) would have a B_c matrix of the form:\nB_c = [e_{mu_1}, e_{mu_1+mu_2}] = [e_2, e_3] = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\nBy duality, C_o = B_c^T.\nTherefore,\nC_o = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]^T = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n\nAlternatively, we can construct C_o directly from the observability indices {nu_1, nu_2}.\nLet sigma_1 = nu_1 = 2.\nLet sigma_2 = nu_1 + nu_2 = 3.\nThe rows of C_o are the standard basis vectors corresponding to these sigma values.\n*   Row 1 of C_o = e_{sigma_1}^T = e_2^T = [0, 1, 0]\n*   Row 2 of C_o = e_{sigma_2}^T = e_3^T = [0, 0, 1]\n\nThis gives the same result for the new matrix C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe value of the new matrix C in the observer canonical form is:\nC_o = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n\n<<<[[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
