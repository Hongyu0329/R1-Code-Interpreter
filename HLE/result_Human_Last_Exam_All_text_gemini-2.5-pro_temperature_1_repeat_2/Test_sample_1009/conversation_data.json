    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the properties of the group G\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  **Compact**: Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n2.  **First-countable**: Every point in $G$ has a countable local base. For a topological group, this is equivalent to the identity element $e$ having a countable local base. Let's denote the character of $G$ as $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n3.  **Cardinality**: The number of elements in $G$ is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n4.  **Not necessarily Hausdorff**: $G$ might not be a $T_2$ space. This is a critical piece of information.\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum possible value for the weight of $G$, denoted $w(G)$. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group\nFor any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup of $G$. The group $G$ is Hausdorff if and only if $N = \\{e\\}$. Since $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff, $N$ can be a non-trivial subgroup.\n\nThe quotient group $H = G/N$, equipped with the quotient topology, has some important properties. The quotient projection map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is a continuous, open, surjective group homomorphism. Let's see how the properties of $G$ transfer to $H$:\n*   **Hausdorff**: The quotient of a topological group by the closure of its identity is always a Hausdorff topological group. So, $H$ is Hausdorff.\n*   **Compact**: Since $\\pi$ is continuous and surjective, and $G$ is compact, $H = \\pi(G)$ is also compact.\n*   **First-countable**: Since $\\pi$ is an open map, the character of $H$ is at most the character of $G$. Thus, $\\chi(H) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. Since $H$ is a non-trivial Hausdorff group, it must be infinite, so its character cannot be smaller than $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$, which means $H$ is first-countable.\n\nSo, $H = G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the weight of G to the weight of H\nThe open sets in a non-Hausdorff group $G$ are \"unions of cosets\" of $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$. More formally, an open set in $G$ is precisely the preimage $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ of an open set $U$ in $H$. This means there is a one-to-one correspondence between the open sets of $G$ and the open sets of $H$. This correspondence extends to bases for the topology. If $\\mathcal{B}_H$ is a base for the topology of $H$, then $\\{\\pi^{-1}(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_H\\}$ is a base for the topology of $G$. Since $\\pi$ is surjective, this mapping is a bijection. Therefore, the minimum cardinalities of such bases must be equal.\nThis gives us a crucial equality:\n$w(G) = w(H)$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible weight of $H$, a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### Step 4: Find an upper bound for the weight of H\nHere we use a celebrated theorem from general topology.\n*   **Arhangel'skii's Theorem (1969)**: The cardinality of any first-countable, compact, Hausdorff space $X$ is at most the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., $|X| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\nApplying this theorem to our group $H$, we get:\n$|H| \\le \\frak c$.\n\nNow, we relate the weight of a space to its cardinality. For any Hausdorff ($T_2$) space $X$, we have the inequality $w(X) \\le 2^{|X|}$. A better bound exists for first-countable spaces: $w(X) \\le |X|^{\\chi(X)}$.\nFor our group $H$:\n$w(H) \\le |H|^{\\chi(H)} = |H|^{\\aleph_0}$.\nSince $|H| \\le \\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$, we have:\n$w(H) \\le (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\nSo, we have found an upper bound for the weight of $H$, and thus for the weight of $G$:\n$w(G) = w(H) \\le \\frak c$.\n\n### Step 5: Show that this upper bound is attainable\nTo prove that $\\frak c$ is the largest *possible* weight, we must construct an example of a group $G$ that satisfies all the given conditions and has a weight of $\\frak c$.\n\n1.  **Construct the Hausdorff part, H**: We need a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group $H$ with $w(H) = \\frak c$. The existence of such groups is a known result in the theory of topological groups. For any infinite cardinal $\\kappa$, one can construct a compact, first-countable, abelian group with weight $\\kappa$. We choose $\\kappa = \\frak c$. For such a group $H$, we have $w(H) = \\frak c$. By Arhangel'skii's theorem, $|H| \\le \\frak c$. Also, for any Hausdorff space, $w(H) \\le |H|$, so we must have $|H| = \\frak c$.\n\n2.  **Construct the non-Hausdorff part, N**: We use the given cardinality of $G$. We have the relation $|G| = |H| \\cdot |N|$.\n    $2^{2^\\frak c} = \\frak c \\cdot |N|$.\n    This implies $|N| = \\frac{2^{2^\\frak c}}{\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. So we need to find a group $N$ of this cardinality. We can simply take $N$ to be any abstract group of this size (e.g., a free group, or a product of cyclic groups).\n\n3.  **Construct G**: Let $G = H \\times N$ be the direct product group. We define a special topology on $G$. Let the topology on $H$ be $\\tau_H$. We define the topology on $G$ to be $\\tau_G = \\{U \\times N \\mid U \\in \\tau_H\\}$.\n\n4.  **Verify the properties of the constructed G**:\n    *   **Topological Group**: With this topology, the group operations (product and inversion) on $G = H \\times N$ are continuous.\n    *   **Compact**: An open cover of $G$ is of the form $\\{U_i \\times N\\}_{i \\in I}$, which corresponds to an open cover $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ of $H$. Since $H$ is compact, a finite subcover $\\{U_{i_k}\\}$ exists, which gives a finite subcover $\\{U_{i_k} \\times N\\}$ for $G$. Thus, $G$ is compact.\n    *   **First-countable**: Since $H$ is first-countable, any point $h \\in H$ has a countable local base $\\{V_k\\}_{k \\in \\omega}$. Then for any point $(h, n) \\in G$, the collection $\\{V_k \\times N\\}_{k \\in \\omega}$ forms a countable local base. Thus, $G$ is first-countable.\n    *   **Cardinality**: $|G| = |H| \\cdot |N| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. This matches the given condition.\n    *   **Not Hausdorff**: Let $h \\in H$ and $n_1 \\neq n_2$ in $N$. The points $(h, n_1)$ and $(h, n_2)$ are distinct. Any open set containing $(h, n_1)$ is of the form $U \\times N$ where $U$ is an open neighborhood of $h$. This set also contains $(h, n_2)$. Thus, the points cannot be separated by disjoint open sets. $G$ is not Hausdorff.\n    *   **Weight**: A base for $\\tau_G$ is given by $\\{B \\times N \\mid B \\text{ is a base element for } \\tau_H\\}$. The cardinality of this base is the same as the cardinality of the base for $H$. Therefore, $w(G) = w(H) = \\frak c$.\n\nSince we have established that the weight of any such group cannot exceed $\\frak c$, and we have constructed an example that achieves this weight, we conclude that the largest possible weight is $\\frak c$."
