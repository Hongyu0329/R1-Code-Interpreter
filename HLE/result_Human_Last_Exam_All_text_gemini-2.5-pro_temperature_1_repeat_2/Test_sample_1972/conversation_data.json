    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question and Identify Key Clues**\n\nThe question asks for the title of a novel based on two specific descriptions provided by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges.\n*   **Clue 1 (The Novel's Qualities):** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n*   **Clue 2 (The Author's Style):** The author is described as \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**2. Analyze Clue 2: \"A continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\"**\n\n*   **\"Continuator of Faulkner\":** This points to an author who was deeply influenced by the American novelist William Faulkner. Faulkner was renowned for his complex narrative structures, multiple points of view, non-linear timelines, and the creation of a mythical setting (Yoknapatawpha County). Many Latin American \"Boom\" writers, including Gabriel García Márquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Juan Rulfo, explicitly cited Faulkner as a major influence.\n*   **\"(and simplifier)\":** This is a critical distinction. It suggests that the author in question adopted Faulkner's structural ambitions but not his famously long, convoluted, and baroque prose style. Instead, this author's style would be more direct, concise, or economical. This specific description is famously used by Borges to characterize the Mexican author **Juan Rulfo**, whose prose is celebrated for its spareness and precision.\n\n**3. Analyze Clue 1: \"The intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"**\n\n*   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This metaphor suggests a work of raw, visceral power. It implies themes of violence, passion, and primal force, all delivered with a ferocious impact.\n*   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This metaphor speaks to the novel's structure. A chess game has a limited number of pieces and a defined board, but the combinations and strategic possibilities are nearly infinite. This suggests the novel is built from a limited set of elements (characters, voices, fragments of memory) that are arranged with extreme precision and complexity to create a profound and multifaceted whole.\n\n**4. Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Novel**\n\n*   The author identified in Step 2 is Juan Rulfo. Rulfo wrote only one novel, **Pedro Páramo**.\n*   We must now confirm if *Pedro Páramo* fits the description in Clue 1.\n*   **Structure (\"chess duel\"):** *Pedro Páramo* is famous for its revolutionary structure. It is a short novel composed of fragmented scenes that shift between different time periods and the voices of the living and the dead. The reader must piece together the story like a puzzle, revealing the history of the town of Comala and its tyrannical ruler. This intricate, masterful construction perfectly aligns with the chess metaphor.\n*   **Content (\"intensity of a tiger\"):** The novel is relentlessly intense. It is a ghost story filled with haunting memories of violence, betrayal, and desolation. The central character, Pedro Páramo, is a figure of brutal, almost elemental power. The novel's atmosphere is oppressive and its emotional impact is profound, matching the \"intensity of a tiger.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe two clues provided by Borges point directly and uniquely to one work. The author, a \"simplifier\" of Faulkner, is Juan Rulfo. The novel, with its combination of structural complexity and raw intensity, is his masterpiece, *Pedro Páramo*.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
