    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the precise verses in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Poem's Structure**\n'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi is a foundational didactic poem on Islamic creed (`aqidah`). It is structured thematically, beginning with the pillars of faith (`Iman`) in their established order: belief in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and Divine Decree. The section listing the prophets' names falls under the fourth pillar: belief in His Messengers (`ar-Rusul`).\n\n**Step 2: Locating the Section on Messengers (Prophets)**\nBefore listing the names, the poem first establishes the general beliefs about the prophets. This section begins around *bayt* 29, discussing the obligatory attributes of the prophets, such as trustworthiness (`al-Amanah`), truthfulness (`as-Sidq`), and intelligence (`al-Fatanah`).\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Introduction to the List of Names**\nAfter discussing the attributes of the prophets, the poem explicitly prepares the reader for the list of names. This is done in *bayt* 34, which states:\n*   `وَتَفْصِيْلُهُمْ خَمْسَةٌ وَعِشْرُوْنَ لَزِمْ ... كُلُّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ`\n*   Translation: \"And their details are twenty-five, which are necessary... for every responsible person, so verify and take this opportunity.\"\n**Careful Point:** This verse is a crucial introduction that states the *number* of prophets to be listed (the 25 mentioned by name in the Qur'an), but it does not contain any of their names itself. Therefore, it is the verse *before* the list begins.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpointing the Starting Verse of the List**\nThe actual enumeration of the prophets' names begins immediately after the introductory verse. The first verse of the list is **bayt 35**:\n*   `هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ ... صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ`\n*   Translation: \"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with... Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.\"\nThis verse clearly begins the list with the name of Prophet Adam (peace be upon him).\n\n**Step 5: Tracing the List to its Conclusion**\nThe list continues over the next few verses:\n*   **Bayt 36:** Lists Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n*   **Bayt 37:** Lists Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\nThe list of the 25 prophets concludes in the very next verse.\n\n**Step 6: Identifying the Final Verse of the List**\nThe final verse containing the last names of the prophets from the list of 25 is **bayt 38**:\n*   `إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ... عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا`\n*   Translation: \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya... 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad), the seal, leave misguidance.\"\n**Careful Point:** This verse concludes the list with Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), referred to here as 'Taha' and 'the seal' (`khaatim`). The verses that follow (*bayt* 39 onwards) contain supplications for the prophets and their families (`عليهم الصلاة والسلام`), but they do not continue the list of names.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThe names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an are enumerated in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' over a span of four verses. The list begins at *bayt* 35 and concludes at *bayt* 38.\n\n***\n\n<<<From bayt 35 to bayt 38.>>>"
