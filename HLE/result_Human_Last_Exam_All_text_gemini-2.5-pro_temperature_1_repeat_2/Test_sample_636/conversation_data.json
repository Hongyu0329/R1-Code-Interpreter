    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given a linear time-invariant system with matrices:\nA = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]\nB = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]\n\nThe control law is given by `u = Fx`, which leads to a closed-loop system dynamics:\n`dx/dt = (A + BF)x`\n\nThe objective is to find the state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF` are located at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Controllability**\n\nBefore attempting to place the eigenvalues, we must ensure the system is controllable. A system is controllable if its controllability matrix `C = [B, AB]` has full rank. The rank must be equal to the dimension of the state vector, which is 2.\n\nFirst, calculate the product `AB`:\n`AB = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] * [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n`AB = [[(-1*1 + 1*1), (-1*2 + 1*0)], [(1*1 + 0*1), (1*2 + 0*0)]]`\n`AB = [[0, -2], [1, 2]]`\n\nNow, form the controllability matrix `C`:\n`C = [B, AB] = [[1, 2, 0, -2], [1, 0, 1, 2]]`\n\nThe rank of `C` is the number of linearly independent columns or rows. Since `B` itself is a 2x2 submatrix of `C`, we can check the rank of `B`.\n`det(B) = (1)(0) - (2)(1) = -2`\n\nSince `det(B)` is not zero, `B` is invertible and has rank 2. Therefore, the controllability matrix `C` has rank 2. The system is controllable, which means we can place the closed-loop poles arbitrarily.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`. The desired characteristic polynomial `p_desired(s)` is formed from these roots:\n`p_desired(s) = (s - λ₁)(s - λ₂)`\n`p_desired(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p_desired(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\n`p_desired(s) = (s + 1)² - j²`\n`p_desired(s) = s² + 2s + 1 + 1`\n`p_desired(s) = s² + 2s + 2`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Actual Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nLet the feedback gain matrix `F` be a 2x2 matrix:\n`F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`\n\nFirst, calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`\n`BF = [[(f₁ + 2f₃), (f₂ + 2f₄)], [f₁, f₂]]`\n\nNext, form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\nNow, find the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl`, which is `det(sI - A_cl)`:\n`sI - A_cl = [[s - (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃), -(1 + f₂ + 2f₄)], [-(1 + f₁), s - f₂]]`\n`sI - A_cl = [[s + 1 - f₁ - 2f₃, -1 - f₂ - 2f₄], [-1 - f₁, s - f₂]]`\n\n`det(sI - A_cl) = (s + 1 - f₁ - 2f₃)(s - f₂) - (-1 - f₂ - 2f₄)(-1 - f₁)`\nThis expression involves four unknowns (`f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄`) and will lead to two equations (by comparing coefficients), meaning there are infinite solutions.\n\n**Step 5: Simplify and Solve for F**\n\nSince the system is a multi-input system, we have degrees of freedom in choosing `F`. A common approach is to simplify the problem by using only one of the inputs. This can be achieved by setting one of the rows of `F` to zero. Let's set the second row of `F` to zero, i.e., `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`.\n\n`F = [[f₁, f₂], [0, 0]]`\n\nNow, re-calculate `A_cl` with this simplified `F`:\n`BF = [[f₁, f₂], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f₁, 1 + f₂], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial `det(sI - A_cl)` is:\n`det(sI - A_cl) = det([[s + 1 - f₁, -(1 + f₂)], [-(1 + f₁), s - f₂]])`\n`= (s + 1 - f₁)(s - f₂) - (-(1 + f₂))(-(1 + f₁))`\n`= s² - sf₂ + s(1 - f₁) - f₂(1 - f₁) - (1 + f₁)(1 + f₂)`\n`= s² + s(1 - f₁ - f₂) - f₂ + f₁f₂ - (1 + f₂ + f₁ + f₁f₂)`\n`= s² + s(1 - f₁ - f₂) - f₂ + f₁f₂ - 1 - f₂ - f₁ - f₁f₂`\n`= s² + s(1 - f₁ - f₂) + (-1 - f₁ - 2f₂)`\n\n**Step 6: Equate Coefficients and Find F**\n\nNow, we equate the coefficients of this polynomial with the desired polynomial `s² + 2s + 2`.\n\n1.  Comparing the coefficients of `s`:\n    `1 - f₁ - f₂ = 2`\n    `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n\n2.  Comparing the constant terms:\n    `-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ = 2`\n    `f₁ + 2f₂ = -3`\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, `f₁` and `f₂`:\n(1) `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n(2) `f₁ + 2f₂ = -3`\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n`(f₁ + 2f₂) - (f₁ + f₂) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f₂ = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f₂ = -2` back into equation (1):\n`f₁ + (-2) = -1`\n`f₁ = 1`\n\nWe found `f₁ = 1` and `f₂ = -2`. With `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`, the feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\nThis is one possible solution for F. Other solutions exist by making different choices for the free parameters.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
