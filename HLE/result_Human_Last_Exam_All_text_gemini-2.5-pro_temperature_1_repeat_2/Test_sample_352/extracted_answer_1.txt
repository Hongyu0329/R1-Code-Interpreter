The best replacement would be to mutate all four amino acids in the 47-50 patch (S-E-E-D) to Alanine (A). This would result in a new sequence of A-A-A-A at positions 47-50. This S47A/E48A/E49A/D50A quadruple mutant effectively eliminates the negative charge by replacing the acidic residues (E, D) and preventing the phosphorylation of the serine residue (S).
