The product is a tetracyclic ketone with the molecular formula C₂₀H₃₄O₄Si. It is formed through an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement, where the C1-C2 bond of the starting material's norbornene core is broken and a new C-C bond is formed between the norbornene's C5 atom and the cyclopentenyl ring's C1' atom. The original alcohol at C2 is oxidized to a ketone in the process (via an enolate intermediate and tautomerization). The C7-dimethoxy ketal and the TBS-ether group remain intact.
