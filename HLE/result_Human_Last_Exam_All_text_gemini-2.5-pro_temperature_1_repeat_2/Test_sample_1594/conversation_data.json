    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks about the shape formed by two specific high schools in Pisa, Italy, when viewed from above. The schools are the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini.\n\n2.  **Locate the Schools:** The first step is to find the exact geographical location of these two schools. Using a mapping service like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, we search for \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti, Pisa\" and \"Istituto Ulisse Dini, Pisa\". We can confirm that they are indeed located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce.\n\n3.  **Examine from an Aerial Perspective:** The question specifies the view \"from above\". This requires using the satellite or aerial imagery feature of the mapping service to see the layout of the buildings' rooftops and footprints.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Individual Building Shapes:**\n    *   **Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti:** This building is a long, straight structure that runs north-south. This forms a distinct vertical line.\n    *   **Istituto Ulisse Dini:** This building is immediately to the east of the Galilei-Pacinotti building. It is composed of several wings that extend eastward, perpendicular to the long building of Galilei-Pacinotti.\n\n5.  **Combine the Shapes:** The crucial part of the analysis is to view the two adjacent buildings as a single, composite shape.\n    *   The long building of the Galilei-Pacinotti forms the vertical backbone or spine.\n    *   The wings of the Ulisse Dini building form three distinct horizontal bars extending from this spine.\n\n6.  **Identify the Letter:** When you combine the vertical spine (from Galilei-Pacinotti) and the three horizontal bars (from Ulisse Dini), the resulting shape is unmistakably a capital letter 'E'.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Identification:** It is essential to correctly identify both schools to ensure you are looking at the right buildings. Their full names are Istituto Tecnico Industriale (ITI) \"Galileo Galilei\" - Istituto Professionale (IPSIA) \"Antonio Pacinotti\" and Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\".\n*   **The \"From Above\" Perspective:** The shape is only apparent from a satellite or aerial view. From the ground, it would be impossible to discern.\n*   **Combined Figure:** The letter is not formed by one school alone, but by the architectural combination of the two adjacent institutions.\n*   **Orientation:** On a standard map with North pointing up, the shape appears as a correctly oriented capital letter 'E'.\n\nBy following these steps and paying attention to these points, we can confidently determine the letter formed by the buildings.\n\n<<<E>>>"
