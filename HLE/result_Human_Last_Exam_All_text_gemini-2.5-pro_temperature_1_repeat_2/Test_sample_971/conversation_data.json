    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Year:** 2008 (era)\n    *   **Ballet:** *Don Quixote*\n    *   **Act/Variation:** Act I, Kitri's solo variation (often performed with a tambourine).\n    *   **Specific Step:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors starting from the fifth position.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Choreography of Kitri's Act I Variation:**\n    The solo for Kitri in Act I is one of the most famous and technically demanding in the classical repertoire. It is choreographed by Marius Petipa and revised by Alexander Gorsky. To answer the question, we must analyze the specific steps within this variation as performed by Natalia Osipova during her time at the Bolshoi.\n\n3.  **Identify the Turning Sequences in the Variation:**\n    Kitri's Act I variation contains several turning sequences, but we must identify the exact type of turn.\n    *   The most famous turning sequence in this variation is a diagonal of **piqué turns**. A piqué turn is distinct from a pirouette from the fifth position. In a piqué turn, the dancer steps directly onto a straight leg on pointe (or demi-pointe), whereas a pirouette from the fifth position begins with both feet on the floor in fifth position, involves a *plié* (bending of the knees), and then a push up to *relevé* to execute the turn.\n    *   The variation may also include other pirouettes, typically doubles or triples, used as transitions or to finish a phrase, but not a repeating sequence of *single* turns from the fifth position.\n\n4.  **Careful Point: Differentiating the Steps:**\n    *   **Pirouette en dehors from fifth:** Starts with feet in fifth position -> plié -> relevé onto one leg in passé -> one outward rotation -> lands, usually in fifth position.\n    *   **Piqué Turn:** Dancer is travelling -> steps onto one leg on pointe -> the other leg comes to a passé position as the turn is executed -> repeat.\n    The question specifically asks for the first type of turn, the pirouette from the fifth position.\n\n5.  **Review Natalia Osipova's Performance:**\n    Reviewing recordings of Natalia Osipova's performance of the Act I Kitri variation with the Bolshoi Ballet (such as the well-documented 2011 HD broadcast, which is representative of her interpretation from that period), we can confirm the choreography. Her performance includes the famous diagonal of sharp, fast piqué turns. It does not, however, feature a sequence of single-turn pirouettes en dehors initiated from the fifth position. This is consistent with the standard and traditional choreography for this variation.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the established Petipa/Gorsky choreography for the *Don Quixote* Act I Kitri variation, which Natalia Osipova performed, the specific step described in the question (a single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position) is not a part of the solo. The prominent turns are piqué turns. Therefore, the number of times she performed this specific step is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
