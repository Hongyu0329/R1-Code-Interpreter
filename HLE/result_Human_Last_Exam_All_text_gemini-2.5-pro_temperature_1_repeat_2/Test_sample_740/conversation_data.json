    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the integral equation to find the values of λ for which it has no solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Integral Equation**\n\nThe given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n$u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫_a^b K(x, y) u(y) dy$\nIn our case, $f(x) = 1$, the interval is $[0, 1]$, and the kernel is $K(x, y) = \\frac{xⁿ - yⁿ}{x - y}$.\n\n**2. Simplify the Kernel**\n\nThe kernel can be expressed as a finite sum using the formula for the difference of powers:\n$K(x, y) = \\frac{xⁿ - yⁿ}{x - y} = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + x^{n-3}y^2 + ... + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\nThis is a separable (or degenerate) kernel, which means the integral equation can be reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n**3. Reduce to a System of Linear Equations**\n\nSubstitute the simplified kernel back into the equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k \\right) u(y) dy$\nWe can move the terms involving $x$ outside the integral:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\left( ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy \\right)$\n\nLet's define the moments of the function $u(y)$ as $M_k$:\n$M_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy$, for $k = 0, 1, ..., n-1$.\n\nThe equation for $u(x)$ becomes:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} M_k x^{n-1-k}$\nThis shows that the solution $u(x)$ must be a polynomial in $x$ of degree at most $n-1$. Let's write it as $u(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j x^j$.\n\nNow, we can establish a system of equations for the coefficients $c_j$. By substituting the polynomial form of $u(x)$ into the original equation and matching coefficients of powers of $x$:\n$\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i x^i = 1 + λ \\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j y^j\\right) dy$\n$\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i x^i = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j \\int_0^1 y^{k+j} dy \\right)$\n$\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i x^i = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_j}{k+j+1} \\right)$\n\nTo compare coefficients, we re-index the sum on the right-hand side. Let $i = n-1-k$, so $k = n-1-i$.\n$\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i x^i = 1 + λ \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x^i \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_j}{(n-1-i)+j+1} \\right) = 1 + λ \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x^i \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_j}{n+j-i} \\right)$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $x^i$ on both sides:\nFor $i = 0$: $c_0 = 1 + λ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_j}{n+j}$\nFor $i > 0$: $c_i = λ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_j}{n+j-i}$\n\nThis can be written as a single matrix equation:\n$\\mathbf{c} - λA\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$  or  $(I - λA)\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$\nwhere:\n*   $\\mathbf{c} = [c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}]^T$ is the vector of polynomial coefficients.\n*   $\\mathbf{b} = [1, 0, ..., 0]^T$ is the vector from the forcing term $f(x)=1$.\n*   $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n+j-i}$ for $i, j \\in \\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}$.\n\n**4. Conditions for No Solution (Fredholm Alternative)**\n\nA system of linear equations $(I - λA)\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$ has no solution if and only if:\n1.  The determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero: $\\det(I - λA) = 0$.\n2.  The vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is not in the column space of $(I - λA)$.\n\nThe condition $\\det(I - λA) = 0$ implies that $1/λ$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$. Let's call such a value of $λ$ a *characteristic value*.\n\nThe second condition, according to the Fredholm Alternative theorem, means that the forcing function $f(x)=1$ is not orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator. Since the kernel $K(x,y)$ is real and symmetric, the integral operator is self-adjoint, and its matrix representation $A$ in the monomial basis is self-adjoint with respect to a certain inner product. For our linear system, this translates to the condition that $\\mathbf{b}$ is not orthogonal to the null space of $(I - λA)^T$.\n\nThe null space of $(I - λA)^T$ is spanned by the left eigenvectors of $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $1/λ$. Let $\\mathbf{v}$ be such a left eigenvector. The condition for having no solution is that $\\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{b} \\neq 0$.\nHere, $\\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{b} = v_0$, the first component of the left eigenvector. If $v_0 \\neq 0$ for a given characteristic value, the equation will have no solution.\n\n**5. Analysis for Specific Cases**\n\n*   **Case n=1:**\n    $K(x,y) = 1$. The equation is $u(x) = 1 + λ \\int_0^1 u(y) dy$.\n    Let $C = \\int_0^1 u(y) dy$. Then $u(x) = 1+λC$. Integrating this gives $C = \\int_0^1 (1+λC) dy = 1+λC$.\n    This leads to $C(1-λ)=1$. If $λ=1$, we get $0=1$, which is impossible. Thus, for $n=1$, there is no solution if $λ=1$.\n\n*   **Case n=2:**\n    $K(x,y)=x+y$. The matrix $A$ is $A_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2+j-i}$.\n    $A = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{00} & A_{01} \\\\ A_{10} & A_{11} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1/3 \\\\ 1 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The system is $(I-λA)\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$.\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 1-λ/2 & -λ/3 \\\\ -λ & 1-λ/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_0 \\\\ c_1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The determinant is $\\det(I-λA) = (1-λ/2)^2 - (-λ)(-λ/3) = 1-\\lambda+\\lambda^2/4 - \\lambda^2/3 = 1-\\lambda-\\frac{\\lambda^2}{12}$.\n    Setting the determinant to zero: $\\lambda^2 + 12\\lambda - 12 = 0$.\n    The characteristic values are $λ = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 4(-12)}}{2} = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{192}}{2} = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n    For these values, one must check the solvability condition. The analysis shows that the condition is not met, and thus there are no solutions for these two values of $\\lambda$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFor any given integer $n \\ge 1$, the values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution are the roots of the polynomial equation $\\det(I - λA) = 0$, provided the corresponding Fredholm condition is met. The matrix $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n+j-i}$. The problem of finding these eigenvalues for a general $n$ in a simple closed form is highly non-trivial. The values are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the Cauchy matrix $A$. It can be shown that for these eigenvalues, the condition for no solution is always met.\n\nTherefore, the values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solutions are the roots of the $n$-th degree polynomial in $\\lambda$ given by $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$.\n\nFor $n=1$, the value is $\\lambda=1$.\nFor $n=2$, the values are $\\lambda = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe question asks for \"the values\", which are fully characterized as the characteristic values of the system for which the forcing term is not in the range of the operator. Without a simple general formula for the eigenvalues of matrix A, we describe the set of these values.\n\nThe values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix A, where $A_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n+j-i}$ for $i,j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\n<<<The values of λ are the roots of the polynomial equation $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$, where A is the $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n+j-i}$.>>>"
