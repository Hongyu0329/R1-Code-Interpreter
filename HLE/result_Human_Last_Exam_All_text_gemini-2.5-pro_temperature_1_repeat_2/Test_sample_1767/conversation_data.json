    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Components:**\n    *   We start with two separate systems: Chern Insulator 1 and Chern Insulator 2.\n    *   A Chern insulator is a two-dimensional topological insulator characterized by an integer topological invariant called the Chern number ($C$).\n    *   For both insulators, the Chern number is given as $C=1$.\n\n2.  **Physical Meaning of the Chern Number:**\n    *   **Quantized Hall Conductance:** The Chern number is directly related to the Hall conductance ($\\sigma_{xy}$) of the material through the relation $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant. So, each insulator has a Hall conductance of $1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n    *   **Chiral Edge States (Bulk-Boundary Correspondence):** A system with a non-zero Chern number $C$ must host $|C|$ conducting edge states that are \"chiral\" (i.e., they propagate in only one direction along a given edge). The sign of $C$ determines the direction of propagation (e.g., clockwise or counter-clockwise around the sample). For $C=1$, there is one such chiral edge state.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Junction:**\n    *   **\"Connects laterally\":** This means the two 2D insulators are placed side-by-side, forming a new, larger 2D system.\n    *   **\"Negligible tunneling barrier\":** This is a crucial point. It means that the boundary between the two insulators is not a hard wall. Electrons can move freely across this interface. The two systems are strongly coupled and effectively merge into a single electronic system. The interface is no longer an \"edge\" in the sense of a boundary with the vacuum.\n\n4.  **Combining the Systems (Two Perspectives):**\n\n    *   **Perspective 1: Additivity of the Chern Number**\n        *   The Chern number is a robust topological invariant. When two gapped topological systems are combined into a single larger system (and the combined system remains gapped in the bulk), their Chern numbers add up.\n        *   Let $C_1$ be the Chern number of the first insulator and $C_2$ be the Chern number of the second.\n        *   The Chern number of the combined system, $C_{total}$, is given by the sum:\n        *   $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2$\n        *   Given $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$, the calculation is straightforward:\n        *   $C_{total} = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\n    *   **Perspective 2: Analyzing the Edge States**\n        *   Let's visualize the two insulators before they are joined. Assume for a $C=1$ system, the edge state circulates clockwise.\n        *   **Insulator 1:** Has one clockwise edge state. On its bottom edge, this state propagates to the right.\n        *   **Insulator 2:** Also has one clockwise edge state. On its top edge, this state propagates to the left.\n        *   Now, we join the bottom edge of Insulator 1 to the top edge of Insulator 2.\n        *   At this new interface, we now have two edge states: one from Insulator 1 moving to the right, and one from Insulator 2 moving to the left.\n        *   These are **counter-propagating** states. Because there is a \"negligible tunneling barrier,\" these two states can interact, hybridize, and open an energy gap. This process effectively \"annihilates\" or \"gaps out\" the edge states at the interface.\n        *   What remains are the edge states on the *outer* boundary of the combined system. On the right side of the combined system, the edge state from Insulator 1 and the edge state from Insulator 2 are both moving in the same direction (e.g., downwards). They are **co-propagating**. They do not annihilate; they simply exist as two parallel conducting channels.\n        *   The total number of chiral edge states on the outer boundary of the combined system is now two.\n        *   According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with two chiral edge states must have a Chern number of $C=2$. This confirms the result from the additivity rule.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The role of the barrier:** If the tunneling barrier were large (infinite), we would simply have two separate insulators. The concept of a single Chern number for the \"junction\" would not apply. The \"negligible barrier\" is what allows the systems to merge and their topological properties to add.\n*   **Gap closing:** The additivity rule assumes that the bulk energy gap does not close when the systems are combined. For joining two insulators with the same sign of the Chern number, this is generally a safe assumption.\n*   **Sign of the Chern Number:** If one insulator had $C=1$ and the other had $C=-1$, the total Chern number would be $C_{total} = 1 + (-1) = 0$. In this case, even the outer edge states would be counter-propagating and could gap out, resulting in a topologically trivial system. The question specifies both have $C=1$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Identify the Chern number of each individual system: $C_1 = 1$, $C_2 = 1$.\n2.  Recognize that combining these systems laterally with negligible tunneling results in a new system whose topological invariant is the sum of the individual invariants.\n3.  Calculate the total Chern number: $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
