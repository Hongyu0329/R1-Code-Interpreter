    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**The Line:**\nverum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\n\n**Analysis Step-by-Step:**\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Vowel Lengths:** First, we identify the natural length of each vowel and divide the words into syllables. A vowel is long by nature (marked with a macron, e.g., ā) or short by nature (marked with a breve, e.g., ă). A syllable is also considered long \"by position\" if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants.\n    *   `vĕrŭm ŭbĭ ĕquī ătquĕ hŏmĭnĭs cāsū cŏnvēnit ĭmāgō.`\n    *   **Key long vowels by nature:**\n        *   `equī`: The `-ī` is the long vowel of the genitive singular.\n        *   `cāsū`: The `-ā-` and `-ū` are long in this ablative form.\n        *   `convēnit`: The `-ē-` is long, indicating the perfect tense (`he/she/it came together`), which fits the context.\n        *   `imāgō`: The `-ā-` and final `-ō` are long.\n\n2.  **Elision:** Next, we look for elisions. Elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel, a diphthong, or `-m` is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or `h-`. The first word's ending is dropped or \"elided\" in pronunciation.\n    *   `verum ubi`: The `-um` of `verum` elides before the `u-` of `ubi`. The line is scanned as `ver(um) ubi`.\n    *   `equi atque`: The `-i` of `equi` elides before the `a-` of `atque`. The line is scanned as `equ(i) atque`.\n    *   `atque hominis`: The `-e` of `atque` elides before the `ho-` of `hominis` (h is not treated as a consonant for elision). The line is scanned as `atqu(e) hominis`.\n\n3.  **Scanning the Feet (from right to left is often easier):**\n    *   **Foot 6 (Spondee):** The last foot of a hexameter is a spondee (long-long). The word is `imāgō`. The last two syllables, `-mā-gō`, are both long.\n        *   Foot 6: `-māgō` -> **S**\n    *   **Foot 5 (Dactyl):** The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl (long-short-short). The words are `convēnit imāgō`. We use the syllables `vē-`, `-nit` (which is short), and the first syllable of `imāgō`, `i-` (which is short).\n        *   Foot 5: `vēnit i-` -> **D**\n    *   **Foot 4 (Spondee):** Before foot 5, we have the word `cāsū` and the syllable `con-` from `convēnit`. The two syllables of `cāsū` are both long.\n        *   Foot 4: `cāsū` -> **S**\n    *   **Foot 3 (Spondee):** This is where the line becomes difficult. We are left with `hominis` and `atque`. Let's account for the elision `atqu(e) hominis`. The last syllable of `hominis`, `-nis`, is long by position because it's followed by the two consonants `s` and `c` (`...nis cāsu...`). The syllable before it, `-mi-`, is short. For this foot to be a spondee, the syllable before `-nis`, which is `-mi-`, would have to be long. This is a known difficulty in this line, and it is resolved by scanning the foot as a spondee through poetic license, where the metrical stress (ictus) on the syllable makes it long.\n        *   Foot 3: `hominis` is scanned `ho-mī-nis`. The foot is formed by `mīnis`. `mī` is treated as long, and `nis` is long by position. -> **S**\n    *   **Foot 2 (Spondee):** Now we have `equi atque ho-`. We apply the elision `equ(i) atque`. We are left with `equatque`. The first syllable `e-` is naturally short. Again, for the line to scan, this syllable must be treated as long by the ictus. The syllable `quat-` is long by position (followed by `qu` or `kw`).\n        *   Foot 2: `ēqu' at-` -> **S**\n    *   **Foot 1 (Dactyl):** This leaves `ver(um) ubi`. The word is `verum`, syllabified as `ver-um`. The syllable `ver-` is closed and thus long by position. The two syllables of `ubi` (`u-` and `bi-`) are both short.\n        *   Foot 1: `ver ubi` -> **D**\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Elision:** This line features multiple elisions (`verum ubi`, `equi atque`, `atque hominis`), which must be correctly identified to determine the sequence of syllables.\n*   **Vowel Quantities:** Correctly identifying long-by-nature vowels (like in `cāsū`, `convēnit`, `imāgō`) and long-by-position syllables (like `ver-` and `-nis`) is crucial.\n*   **Metrical Lengthening (Ictus):** This specific line is famous for its difficulty and requires the scansion to assume the lengthening of naturally short syllables (`e-` in `equi` and `-mi-` in `hominis`) due to the metrical stress or beat (ictus) of the line, a form of poetic license. Without this, the line does not fit the hexameter pattern.\n\n**Final Scansion:**\n\n*   Foot 1: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 2: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 3: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 4: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 5: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 6: Spondee (S)\n\nThe complete pattern is D-S-S-S-D-S.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
