    "To find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, we perform a step-by-step analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the curve and find a suitable model.**\nThe curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\nThe base field is $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ with the valuation $v=v_2$ normalized by $v(2)=1$.\nWe first determine the valuations of the roots of the polynomial $F(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\nWe use the Newton polygon method for $F(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The vertices of the Newton polygon are determined by the points $(i, v(c_i))$, where $c_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.\nThe coefficients are $c_5=2, c_3=2, c_0=1$. The other coefficients are 0.\nThe points are $(5, v(2)=1)$, $(3, v(2)=1)$, and $(0, v(1)=0)$.\nThe lower convex hull of these points is the line segment connecting $(0,0)$ and $(5,1)$. The point $(3,1)$ lies above this segment (since for the line $Y=X/5$, at $X=3$, we have $Y=3/5 < 1$).\nThe Newton polygon consists of a single segment from $(0,0)$ to $(5,1)$. The slope of this segment is $(1-0)/(5-0) = 1/5$.\nThe valuations of the roots are the negative of the slopes of the Newton polygon. Thus, all 5 roots $\\alpha_i$ of $F(x)=0$ have valuation $v(\\alpha_i) = -1/5$.\n\n**Step 2: Base change to simplify the model.**\nSince the valuations of the roots are not integers, we need to perform a base change. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\pi)$ where $\\pi^5 = 2$. This is a totally ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ of degree 5. The valuation on $K$, let's call it $v_K$, is normalized so that $v_K(\\pi)=1$. Then $v_K(2)=5$, and for any $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2$, $v_K(a) = 5v_2(a)$.\nWe change variables to make the roots have valuation 0. Let $x = y/\\pi$.\nSubstituting this into the curve equation:\n$z^2 = 2(y/\\pi)^5 + 2(y/\\pi)^3 + 1$\n$z^2 = \\frac{2y^5}{\\pi^5} + \\frac{2y^3}{\\pi^3} + 1$\nSince $\\pi^5=2$, this simplifies to:\n$z^2 = y^5 + \\frac{\\pi^5 y^3}{\\pi^3} + 1 = y^5 + \\pi^2 y^3 + 1$.\nThis gives a new model for the curve, $\\mathcal{C}_K$, over the ring of integers $O_K = \\mathbb{Z}_2[\\pi]$ of the field $K$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the special fiber of the new model.**\nThe special fiber is obtained by reducing the equation modulo the maximal ideal generated by $\\pi$.\nThe equation of the special fiber $\\bar{\\mathcal{C}}_K$ over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is:\n$\\bar{\\mathcal{C}}_K: z^2 = y^5 + 1$.\nWe need to find the singularities of this curve. A point $(y_0, z_0)$ is singular if the partial derivatives of $g(y,z) = z^2 - y^5 - 1$ vanish at that point, in characteristic 2.\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} = 2z = 0$ (which is always true in characteristic 2).\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -5y^4 = -y^4 = 0$, which implies $y_0=0$.\nIf $y_0=0$, we find $z_0$ from the curve equation: $z_0^2 = 0^5+1=1$, so $z_0=1$.\nThus, the special fiber has a unique singular point at $(y,z)=(0,1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the singularity.**\nTo analyze the type of singularity, we shift the coordinates to move the singular point to the origin. Let $Y=y$ and $Z=z-1$.\nThe equation $z^2=y^5+1$ becomes $(Z+1)^2=Y^5+1$, which simplifies to $Z^2+2Z+1=Y^5+1$, and in characteristic 2, this is $Z^2=Y^5$.\nThis is a higher-order cusp, which is not an ordinary double point. Thus, the model is not stable. The stable reduction is obtained by resolving this singularity.\n\n**Step 5: Resolve the singularity and find the thickness.**\nThe stable reduction is found by constructing the minimal regular model and then contracting components to obtain a stable curve. A double point in the stable model arises from contracting a chain of rational curves in the minimal regular model. The thickness of the double point is the number of rational curves in this chain.\nThe minimal resolution of a cusp of type $Z^m=Y^n$ (with $\\gcd(m,n)=1$) is a chain of rational curves whose structure is given by the continued fraction expansion of $n/m$.\nHere we have the singularity $Z^2=Y^5$. We compute the continued fraction of $5/2$:\n$5/2 = 2 + 1/2 = [2; 2]$.\nThe resolution is a chain of two rational curves, say $E_1$ and $E_2$. From the theory of resolution of surface singularities, these curves have self-intersection $-2$.\nSo the resolution of the cusp $Z^2=Y^5$ on the special fiber produces a chain of two $\\mathbb{P}^1$'s.\nLet's see how this chain is attached to the strict transform of the curve. The original special fiber $C_{sp}: z^2=y^5+1$ is an irreducible rational curve (its normalization is $\\mathbb{P}^1$). After resolving the singularity, the strict transform $C'_{sp}$ is the smooth normalization, so it is a $\\mathbb{P}^1$. The resolution replaces the singular point with a chain of two rational curves $E_1, E_2$, say with dual graph $C'_{sp} - E_2 - E_1$.\nThe components $E_1, E_2$ are $(-2)$-curves.\nThe stable model is obtained by contracting any chains of $(-2)$-curves that would not disconnect the graph or lower the genus. In this configuration, the chain $E_1-E_2$ is what will be contracted to form the double point in the stable reduction.\nThe number of curves in the chain that is contracted to form a single node determines the thickness of that node. Here, the chain consists of two curves, $E_1$ and $E_2$.\nTherefore, the thickness of the double point is 2.\nThis reasoning holds when we consider the full model over $O_K$ as well. The process of blowing up the singular point of the special fiber of the model $z^2 = y^5 + \\pi^2 y^3 + 1$ corresponds to the resolution described above, and the resulting structure of the minimal regular model's special fiber confirms this result. The final stable model will have a double point whose thickness is determined by the length of the contracted chain of rational curves.\n\nThe final answer is 2.\n\n>>>2"
