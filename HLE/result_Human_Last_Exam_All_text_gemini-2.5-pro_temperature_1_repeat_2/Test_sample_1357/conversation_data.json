    "This problem asks for the number of different types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve whose Jacobian has good reduction. Let $C$ be such a curve defined over a valuation field $K$. Let $R$ be the valuation ring and $k$ be the residue field.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the conditions**\n\n1.  **Stable Reduction:** A stable reduction of $C$ is a stable curve $\\mathcal{C}_k$ over the residue field $k$, which is the special fiber of a stable model $\\mathcal{C}$ of $C$ over $R$. A stable curve is a connected, reduced projective curve with only ordinary double points (nodes) as singularities, and a finite automorphism group. For genus $g \\geq 2$, this latter condition means every rational component (a component isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$) must have at least 3 special points (i.e., nodes). The arithmetic genus of $\\mathcal{C}_k$ is $p_a(\\mathcal{C}_k) = g = 4$.\n\n2.  **Jacobian has good reduction:** The Jacobian variety $J = \\text{Jac}(C)$ is an abelian variety of dimension $g=4$. The condition that $J$ has good reduction means that the special fiber of its NÃ©ron model, $\\mathcal{J}_k$, is an abelian variety of dimension 4. A key result by Raynaud states that the toric rank of the reduction of the Jacobian is equal to the first Betti number of the dual graph of the special fiber of the curve's stable model. Good reduction implies this toric rank is 0.\n\n**Step 2: Translate conditions into combinatorial properties**\n\nThe condition that the Jacobian has good reduction implies that the dual graph of the components of the special fiber $\\mathcal{C}_k$ must be a tree. Let $\\mathcal{C}_k$ be composed of $n$ irreducible components $C_1, \\ldots, C_n$. The dual graph $\\Gamma$ has $n$ vertices, and since it is a tree, it has $n-1$ edges. An edge connects two vertices if the corresponding components intersect.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of a nodal curve is given by the formula:\n$p_a(\\mathcal{C}_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_a(C_i) + \\delta - n + 1$, where $\\delta$ is the total number of nodes.\nLet $g_i$ be the geometric genus of the normalization of $C_i$, and $\\delta_{ii}$ be the number of nodes on $C_i$ itself (self-intersections). Then $p_a(C_i) = g_i + \\delta_{ii}$.\nThe total number of nodes is $\\delta = \\sum_{i<j} |\\text{Nodes}(C_i, C_j)| + \\sum_i \\delta_{ii}$. The number of edges in the dual graph is $e = \\sum_{i<j} |\\text{Nodes}(C_i, C_j)|$. Since $\\Gamma$ is a tree, $e = n-1$.\nSubstituting into the genus formula for $p_a(\\mathcal{C}_k) = 4$:\n$4 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (g_i + \\delta_{ii}) + (n-1) - n + 1$\n$4 = \\sum_{i=1}^n g_i + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_{ii}$\n\nSo, we need to find the number of stable curves $\\mathcal{C}_k$ of arithmetic genus 4 such that:\n1.  The dual graph of components is a tree.\n2.  $\\sum_{i=1}^n g_i + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_{ii} = 4$, where $g_i$ is the genus of component $C_i$ and $\\delta_{ii}$ is its number of self-nodes.\n3.  (Stability) Any component $C_i$ with $g_i=0$ must have at least 3 nodes on it. The number of nodes on $C_i$ is $d_i + 2\\delta_{ii}$, where $d_i$ is the degree of the corresponding vertex in the dual graph. So for $g_i=0$, we need $d_i + 2\\delta_{ii} \\ge 3$.\n\n**Step 3: Enumerate the possibilities by the number of components, $n$**\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum possible value for $n$. For any component $C_i$ with $g_i=0$ (a rational component), the stability condition $d_i+2\\delta_{ii}\\ge 3$ implies $\\delta_{ii}\\ge 1$ (since $d_i\\ge 1$ for a tree).\nLet $r$ be the number of rational components. Then $\\sum \\delta_{ii} \\ge r$. Also, $\\sum g_i \\ge n-r$.\nSo, $4 = \\sum g_i + \\sum \\delta_{ii} \\ge (n-r) + r = n$.\nThus, the number of components $n$ can be at most 4.\n\nWe classify the reduction types based on the number of components $n$. A \"type\" is determined by the dual graph and the list of pairs $(g_i, \\delta_{ii})$ for each component.\n\n**Case n=1 (Irreducible curve):**\nThe dual graph is a single vertex. $\\sum g_i + \\sum \\delta_{ii} = g_1 + \\delta_{11} = 4$.\nStability: if $g_1=0$, we need $d_1+2\\delta_{11} = 0+2\\delta_{11} \\ge 3 \\implies \\delta_{11} \\ge 2$.\n1.  $(g_1, \\delta_{11}) = (4,0)$: A smooth genus 4 curve.\n2.  $(g_1, \\delta_{11}) = (3,1)$: An irreducible genus 3 curve with 1 node.\n3.  $(g_1, \\delta_{11}) = (2,2)$: An irreducible genus 2 curve with 2 nodes.\n4.  $(g_1, \\delta_{11}) = (1,3)$: An irreducible genus 1 curve with 3 nodes.\n5.  $(g_1, \\delta_{11}) = (0,4)$: A rational curve with 4 nodes. Stability is satisfied ($2\\cdot 4 = 8 \\ge 3$).\nTotal for n=1: **5 types**.\n\n**Case n=2:**\nThe dual graph is an edge connecting two vertices, $C_1, C_2$. So $d_1=d_2=1$.\n$\\sum g_i + \\sum \\delta_{ii} = g_1+g_2+\\delta_{11}+\\delta_{22}=4$.\nStability: if $g_i=0$, $1+2\\delta_{ii} \\ge 3 \\implies \\delta_{ii} \\ge 1$.\n1.  Both components have $g_i \\ge 1$: 5 types corresponding to partitions of 4 into $(g_1+\\delta_{11})+(g_2+\\delta_{22})$. E.g., $(g_1,g_2)=(3,1), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,1)$. Combinations are $(3,0;1,0), (2,0;2,0), (2,1;1,0), (1,2;1,0), (1,1;1,1)$. (5 types).\n2.  One component is rational (say $g_2=0$, so $\\delta_{22}\\ge 1$): 6 types. E.g., $(g_1, \\delta_{11}; g_2, \\delta_{22})$ can be $(3,0;0,1), (2,1;0,1), (2,0;0,2), (1,2;0,1), (1,1;0,2), (1,0;0,3)$.\n3.  Both components are rational ($g_1=g_2=0$, so $\\delta_{11}\\ge 1, \\delta_{22}\\ge 1$): $\\delta_{11}+\\delta_{22}=4$. Pairs are $(3,1)$ and $(2,2)$. (2 types).\nTotal for n=2: 5 + 6 + 2 = **13 types**.\n\n**Case n=3:**\nThe dual graph is a path $C_1-C_2-C_3$. Degrees are $d_1=1, d_2=2, d_3=1$.\n$\\sum g_i + \\sum \\delta_{ii} = g_1+g_2+g_3+\\delta_{11}+\\delta_{22}+\\delta_{33}=4$.\nStability: $g_1=0 \\implies \\delta_{11}\\ge 1$, $g_2=0 \\implies \\delta_{22}\\ge 1$, $g_3=0 \\implies \\delta_{33}\\ge 1$.\nA systematic enumeration based on partitioning 4 into $v_1+v_2+v_3$ where $v_i = g_i+\\delta_{ii}$, and then partitioning each $v_i$ into $g_i+\\delta_{ii}$ while respecting the stability conditions, gives:\n-   No rational components ($g_i \\ge 1$ for all $i$): 4 types.\n-   One rational component: 8 types.\n-   Two rational components: 7 types.\n-   Three rational components: 2 types.\nTotal for n=3: 4 + 8 + 7 + 2 = **21 types**.\n\n**Case n=4:**\nThe number of components is $n=4$. The argument $n \\le \\sum g_i + \\sum \\delta_{ii}$ implies that here we must have equality. This forces each component $C_i$ to be of one of two kinds:\n-   Type A: $(g_i, \\delta_{ii}) = (1,0)$.\n-   Type B: $(g_i, \\delta_{ii}) = (0,1)$.\nThe stability condition for a type B component $C_i$ is $d_i+2(1)\\ge 3 \\implies d_i \\ge 1$, which is always true in a tree.\nThe dual graph is a tree with 4 vertices. There are two such trees: the path graph $P_4$ and the star graph $K_{1,3}$. We need to count the number of ways to label the vertices with A or B, up to graph isomorphism.\n1.  Graph $P_4$ ($C_1-C_2-C_3-C_4$): The automorphism group is $\\mathbb{Z}/2$. We count the orbits of labelings.\n    -   4 A's: 1 type (AAAA).\n    -   3 A's, 1 B: 2 types (BAAA, ABAA).\n    -   2 A's, 2 B's: 4 types (BBAA, BABA, BAAB, ABBA).\n    -   1 A, 3 B's: 2 types (symmetrical to 3 A's).\n    -   4 B's: 1 type.\n    Total for $P_4$: 1+2+4+2+1 = **10 types**.\n2.  Graph $K_{1,3}$ (one central vertex $C_0$, three leaves $C_1,C_2,C_3$): The automorphism group is $S_3$ on the leaves.\n    -   Center A: The 3 leaves can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 B's. This gives 4 types.\n    -   Center B: The 3 leaves can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 B's. This gives 4 types.\n    Total for $K_{1,3}$: 4 + 4 = **8 types**.\nTotal for n=4: 10 + 8 = **18 types**.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nSumming up the number of types for each possible number of components:\nTotal = (types for n=1) + (types for n=2) + (types for n=3) + (types for n=4)\nTotal = 5 + 13 + 21 + 18 = 57.\n\nThere are 57 types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves defined over a valuation field under the assumption that the Jacobian has good reduction."
