    "The question asks for the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set. The number of primitives depends on the specific atom being considered. Therefore, we must analyze the basis set notation and then apply it to different types of atoms (e.g., hydrogen, a second-row atom like carbon, and a third-row atom like sulfur).\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Basis Set Notation `6-311G**`\n\nPople-style basis set notation provides a recipe for how many functions are used and how they are constructed.\n\n*   **The part before the hyphen (`6-`): Core Orbitals**\n    *   This describes the basis functions for the core atomic orbitals (e.g., 1s for Carbon; 1s, 2s, 2p for Sulfur).\n    *   Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian-type orbital (CGTO).\n    *   This single CGTO is constructed from a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian-type orbitals (PGTOs).\n\n*   **The part after the hyphen (`-311`): Valence Orbitals**\n    *   This describes the basis functions for the valence atomic orbitals (e.g., 2s and 2p for Carbon; 3s and 3p for Sulfur).\n    *   This is a \"triple-split valence\" basis set, meaning each valence orbital is described by three separate CGTOs to provide more flexibility.\n    *   The first CGTO (the \"inner\" part of the valence shell) is a contraction of **3** PGTOs.\n    *   The second CGTO (the first \"outer\" part) is composed of **1** PGTO.\n    *   The third CGTO (the second \"outer\" part) is composed of **1** PGTO.\n    *   So, for each valence orbital, there are a total of 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n\n*   **The `G`**\n    *   This simply confirms that Gaussian-type orbitals are used.\n\n*   **The asterisks (`**`)**: **Polarization Functions**\n    *   Polarization functions are functions with higher angular momentum than what is required for the ground state of the atom. They are crucial for accurately describing the anisotropy of chemical bonds.\n    *   The **first asterisk (`*`)** applies to \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. It adds a single set of uncontracted d-type polarization functions. A standard set includes 6 Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz), each being a single primitive Gaussian. This adds **6** PGTOs.\n    *   The **second asterisk (`*`)** applies to hydrogen atoms. It adds a single set of uncontracted p-type polarization functions (p_x, p_y, p_z), each being a single primitive Gaussian. This adds **3** PGTOs.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Number of Primitives for Specific Atoms\n\nNow we apply this recipe to calculate the total number of primitive Gaussians for different atoms.\n\n#### **Case 1: Hydrogen (H)**\n*   Hydrogen (1s¹) has no core electrons; its 1s orbital is a valence orbital.\n*   **Valence (1s orbital):** Described by the `-311` rule.\n    *   Number of primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** s-type primitives.\n*   **Polarization (`**`):** The second asterisk applies, adding p-functions.\n    *   Number of primitives = 1 (for p_x) + 1 (for p_y) + 1 (for p_z) = **3** p-type primitives.\n*   **Total for Hydrogen:** 5 + 3 = **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n#### **Case 2: Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon, C)**\n*   Carbon (1s², 2s², 2p²) has a 1s core and 2s, 2p valence orbitals.\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** Described by the `6-` rule.\n    *   Number of primitives = **6** s-type primitives.\n*   **Valence (2s orbital):** Described by the `-311` rule.\n    *   Number of primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** s-type primitives.\n*   **Valence (2p orbitals):** There are three 2p orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z). The `-311` rule applies to each one.\n    *   Number of primitives = 3 × (3 + 1 + 1) = 3 × 5 = **15** p-type primitives.\n*   **Polarization (`**`):** The first asterisk applies, adding d-functions.\n    *   Number of primitives = **6** d-type primitives.\n*   **Total for Carbon:** 6 (from 1s) + 5 (from 2s) + 15 (from 2p) + 6 (from d-pol) = **32 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n#### **Case 3: Third-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Sulfur, S)**\n*   Sulfur (1s², 2s², 2p⁶, 3s², 3p⁴) has 1s, 2s, 2p core orbitals and 3s, 3p valence orbitals.\n*   **Core (1s, 2s, 2p orbitals):** The `6-` rule applies to each core orbital.\n    *   1s orbital: **6** s-type primitives.\n    *   2s orbital: **6** s-type primitives.\n    *   2p orbitals (x3): 3 × 6 = **18** p-type primitives.\n*   **Valence (3s orbital):** Described by the `-311` rule.\n    *   Number of primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** s-type primitives.\n*   **Valence (3p orbitals):** The `-311` rule applies to each of the three 3p orbitals.\n    *   Number of primitives = 3 × (3 + 1 + 1) = 3 × 5 = **15** p-type primitives.\n*   **Polarization (`**`):** The first asterisk applies, adding d-functions.\n    *   Number of primitives = **6** d-type primitives.\n*   **Total for Sulfur:** 6 (1s) + 6 (2s) + 18 (2p) + 5 (3s) + 15 (3p) + 6 (d-pol) = **56 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom. Here is the summary:\n*   **For a Hydrogen atom:** 8\n*   **For a second-row heavy atom (Li-Ne):** 32\n*   **For a third-row heavy atom (Na-Ar):** 56\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians depends on the atom: 8 for Hydrogen, 32 for a second-row heavy atom (e.g., C, N, O), and 56 for a third-row heavy atom (e.g., Si, P, S).>>>"
