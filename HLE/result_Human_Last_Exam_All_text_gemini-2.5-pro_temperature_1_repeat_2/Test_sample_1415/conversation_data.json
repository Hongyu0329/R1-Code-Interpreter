    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions**\n\nFirst, let's write out the explicit form of each function by substituting the previous one.\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integral**\n\nThe integral we need to evaluate is:\n∫ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\nThis integral is in a special form: ∫ (f'(x) / f(x)) dx.\nTo solve this, we can use a u-substitution. Let `u = f(x)`. Then, `du = f'(x) dx`.\nSubstituting these into the integral gives:\n∫ (1/u) du = ln|u| + C\n\nIn our specific problem, `f(x) = F₃(x)`. So, the indefinite integral is:\n∫ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx = ln|F₃(x)| + C\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the definite integral**\n\nNow we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus using the limits of integration from 0 to 1.\n∫ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\n= ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n= ln(|F₃(1) / F₃(0)|)\n\n**Step 4: Check the sign of F₃(x) in the interval [0, 1]**\n\nWe need to determine if the absolute value signs are necessary. Let's analyze the behavior of F₃(x) for x in the interval [0, 1] (in radians).\n*   For `x` in [0, 1], `sin(x)` is in the range [sin(0), sin(1)] which is approximately [0, 0.841]. So, `sin(x) ≥ 0`.\n*   Since `sin(x) ≥ 0`, `e^(sin(x))` will be greater than or equal to `e⁰ = 1`.\n*   Therefore, `1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   Finally, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` will be greater than or equal to `ln(2)`.\n*   Since `ln(2)` is positive (approx 0.693), `F₃(x)` is always positive on the interval [0, 1].\n*   Thus, we can drop the absolute value signs: `|F₃(x)| = F₃(x)`.\n\nThe value of the integral `V` is:\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))`\n    `sin(0) = 0`\n    `e⁰ = 1`\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    Here, '1' is in radians.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final value V**\n\nSubstitute the expressions for F₃(1) and F₃(0) into the formula for V.\nV = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) )\nV = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n*   `sin(1)` ≈ 0.84147098\n*   `e^(sin(1))` ≈ `e^0.84147098` ≈ 2.319771\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1))` ≈ 3.319771\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(3.319771)` ≈ 1.20000\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2)` ≈ 0.693147\n*   `V = ln(1.20000 / 0.693147)`\n*   `V = ln(1.731234)`\n*   `V ≈ 0.548834`\n\n**Step 7: Report the final answer**\n\nThe question asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n*   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548834 = 5488.34`\n*   The closest integer to 5488.34 is 5488.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
