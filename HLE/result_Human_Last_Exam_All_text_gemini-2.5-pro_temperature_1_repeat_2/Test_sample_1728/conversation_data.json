    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph Definition:**\n    The problem defines a graph \\( G \\) as the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\". Let the three cycles be \\( C_{n,1} \\), \\( C_{n,2} \\), and \\( C_{n,3} \\).\n\n2.  **Interpret the \"Sum\" Operation:**\n    In graph theory, the term \"sum of graphs\" (often denoted by the '+' symbol) standardly refers to the **graph join** operation. Let's assume this is the intended meaning. The join of two vertex-disjoint graphs, \\( G_1=(V_1, E_1) \\) and \\( G_2=(V_2, E_2) \\), is a new graph \\( G_1 + G_2 \\) with vertex set \\( V_1 \\cup V_2 \\) and edge set \\( E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup \\{uv \\mid u \\in V_1, v \\in V_2\\} \\). This means we take the union of the two graphs and add every possible edge between the vertices of \\( G_1 \\) and the vertices of \\( G_2 \\). The graph join operation is associative.\n    Therefore, \\( G = C_{n,1} + C_{n,2} + C_{n,3} \\), where the three cycles are vertex-disjoint.\n\n3.  **Chromatic Number of a Graph Join:**\n    A fundamental property of the graph join operation relates to the chromatic number. For any two vertex-disjoint graphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), the chromatic number of their join is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers:\n    \\[ \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\]\n    This rule extends to the sum of multiple graphs. For our graph \\( G \\), this means:\n    \\[ \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_{n,1}) + \\chi(C_{n,2}) + \\chi(C_{n,3}) \\]\n    Since all three cycles have the same length \\( n \\), their chromatic numbers are equal:\n    \\[ \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\]\n\n4.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( C_n \\)):**\n    The chromatic number of a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) (for \\( n \\ge 3 \\)) depends on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd:\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **even**, the cycle is a bipartite graph, and it can be colored with two colors. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **odd**, the cycle is not bipartite and requires three colors for a proper coloring. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n5.  **Determine the Maximal Chromatic Number:**\n    The question asks for the **maximal** chromatic number of \\( G \\). This means we need to choose the parameter \\( n \\) in a way that maximizes \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n    From the formula \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\), we can see that \\( \\chi(G) \\) is maximized when \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is maximized.\n    *   Case 1: \\( n \\) is even. \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\). Then \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\).\n    *   Case 2: \\( n \\) is odd. \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\). Then \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n\n    The maximum of these two values is 9. This maximum value is achieved by choosing \\( n \\) to be any odd integer greater than or equal to 3.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Sum\":** The most critical point is the interpretation of the \"sum of graphs\". The standard definition is the graph join. An alternative interpretation, such as the union of three cycles on the same vertex set, would lead to a different answer (the maximum would be 7, achieved when \\( n=7 \\) and the union forms a \\( K_7 \\)). However, the term \"sum\" and the associated '+' notation strongly suggest the join operation.\n*   **Vertex Disjointness:** The definition of the graph join \\( G_1 + G_2 \\) assumes that the vertex sets of \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\) are disjoint. So, we must assume that the three cycles are defined on three distinct sets of \\( n \\) vertices each.\n*   **Meaning of \"Maximal\":** The word \"maximal\" instructs us to find the highest possible chromatic number by making an appropriate choice for the free parameter, which in this case is the length \\( n \\) of the cycles. We are not given a fixed \\( n \\), but rather we can choose its properties (parity) to maximize the chromatic number.\n*   **Knowledge of Basic Graph Properties:** The solution relies on knowing the definition of the graph join and the standard results for the chromatic number of a join and the chromatic number of a cycle.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Let \\( G \\) be the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), which is interpreted as the graph join \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\).\n2.  The chromatic number of a join is the sum of the chromatic numbers of its components: \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\).\n3.  The chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) is 2 if \\( n \\) is even and 3 if \\( n \\) is odd.\n4.  To maximize \\( \\chi(G) \\), we must maximize \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). The maximum value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3 (for odd \\( n \\)).\n5.  Therefore, the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\) is \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n\n<<<9>>>"
