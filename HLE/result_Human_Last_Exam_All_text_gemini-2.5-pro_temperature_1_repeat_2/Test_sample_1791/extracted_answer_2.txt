The effective electron-electron interaction for a given momentum transfer $\mathbf{q}$ is a non-local interaction in time, characterized in frequency space by the potential $V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\nu_n)$. The interaction term added to the Hamiltonian for this momentum transfer is $H_{eff}(\mathbf{q}) = \frac{1}{\beta} \sum_{\nu_n} V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\nu_n) n_{\mathbf{q}}(i\nu_n) n_{-\mathbf{q}}(-i\nu_n)$, with the potential given by:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\nu_n) = -\sum_{j} \frac{g^2 q_j^2}{m(w_q^2 + \nu_n^2)}$
where $\nu_n$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies.
