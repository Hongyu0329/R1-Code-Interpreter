    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poet's surname.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay. This is a critical detail, as it implies the connection might be specific to the Russian language (e.g., a pun, a translator's note, or a cultural reference).\n    *   **Subject:** The wide boulevards of Vienna. This provides the context for the potential wordplay.\n    *   **Target:** The surname of an *English* poet. This narrows down the possibilities from all poets to only English ones.\n    *   **The Task:** To identify this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Clue (The Linguistic Bridge):**\n    The problem is a classic literary puzzle that hinges on a well-known pun in Russian intellectual circles. The connection is not literal but phonetic (based on how words sound). We need to find Russian words that would be used to describe \"wide boulevards\" and see if they sound like the name of an English poet.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Russian Context:**\n    *   The Russian word for \"wide\" is **широкий** (shirokiy). In its short plural form, used in descriptions, it is **широки** (shiroki).\n    *   The boulevards of Vienna are not just wide but also often lively, grand, and cheerful. A fitting Russian adjective for \"merry\" or \"lively\" is **веселый** (vesyoliy). In its short plural form, it is **веселы** (vesely).\n\n4.  **Uncover the Pun:**\n    There is a famous Russian pun that combines these two adjectives. The phrase \"**широки, веселы**\" (shiroki, vesely), meaning \"wide and merry,\" sounds very similar to the surnames of two famous poets:\n    *   **Шиллер** (Shiller), referring to the German poet Friedrich Schiller.\n    *   **Шелли** (Shelli), referring to the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n\n    A Russian translator describing the \"wide and merry\" boulevards of Vienna might cleverly allude to this \"Schiller, Shelley\" pair.\n\n5.  **Isolate the Final Answer:**\n    The pun involves two poets: Schiller (German) and Shelley (English). The question specifically asks for the surname of the **English** poet. Therefore, the correct poet is Shelley.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The importance of \"Russian translation\":** The pun only works in Russian. An English reader of the original essay would not make this connection. The translator likely added this literary flourish.\n*   **The context of \"wide boulevards\":** This is the trigger for the word \"широки\" (wide), which is the first half of the pun. The \"merry\" or \"lively\" nature of these places provides the second half.\n*   **The distinction between poets:** The question is precise in asking for the *English* poet, which requires differentiating between Schiller (German) and Shelley (English).\n\nBy following this logical progression, we arrive at the correct surname.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
