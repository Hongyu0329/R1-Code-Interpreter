    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Famous Landmark:** The Pantheon.\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action & Time:** Removed in 1950.\n    *   **Agent:** The city administration.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Candidates:**\n    The Piazza della Rotonda has several key features: the Pantheon itself, the Fontana del Pantheon (fountain) with its obelisk, and the surrounding buildings. We need to consider what might have been added and later removed.\n    *   **Features on the Pantheon:** The most famous removed features were the two bell towers added by Bernini, often mockingly called \"the ass's ears\" (le orecchie d'asino).\n    *   **Features in the Square:** The square has hosted various things over the centuries, including a bustling market and transportation infrastructure.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Candidates Against the 1950 Timeline:**\n    *   **The Bell Towers:** This is a very common answer but is incorrect for the date provided. The bell towers were a prominent architectural feature, but they were removed much earlier, between 1883 and 1892. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n    *   **The Market:** The historic fish and vegetable market that occupied the piazza was considered unseemly for the location and was cleared out in the mid-19th century (around 1847). This also does not match the 1950 date.\n    *   **Transportation Infrastructure:** In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Rome, like many European cities, developed a network of tramways. A tram line ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda. Uniquely, the tracks formed a loop that circled the central fountain. This was a very distinct feature of the square's landscape during that era.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Removal:**\n    After World War II, Rome's city administration began a process of modernizing and reorganizing the city. This included a significant reduction of the tram network within the historic center, which was seen as noisy, visually intrusive, and an impediment to the growing automobile traffic. The tram lines and their tracks were replaced by bus routes. The removal of the tram loop from the Piazza della Rotonda was part of this major post-war project, with the work taking place around the late 1940s and concluding around 1950.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **The Date is Crucial:** The year 1950 is the key to differentiating the correct answer from other historical changes in the piazza.\n*   **\"Architectural Feature\" Interpretation:** While not a building, the tramway loop was a significant, man-made structural element that defined the visual character and function of the square for decades. It fits the description of a \"unique architectural feature\" in the context of urban design.\n*   **Common Misconceptions:** It is important to rule out the more famous but chronologically incorrect removal of Bernini's bell towers.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, the unique feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950 was the tramway line. The tracks specifically formed a circle around the central fountain, making it a very particular feature of the square before its removal in the post-war modernization effort.\n\n<<<The tramway line that circled the central fountain>>>"
