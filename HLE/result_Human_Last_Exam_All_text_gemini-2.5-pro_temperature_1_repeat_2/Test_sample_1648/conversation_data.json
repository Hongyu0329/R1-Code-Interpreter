    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero.\n\n**Step 1: Decompose the K-group**\nThe ring in question is $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}/3^3\\mathbb{Z}$. For a finite ring like this, any of its K-groups $K_i(R)$ is a finite abelian group. A finite abelian group can be decomposed into its $p$-primary components. So, we can write:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(3)} \\oplus \\bigoplus_{l \\neq 3, l \\text{ prime}} K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(l)}$\nwhere $G_{(p)}$ denotes the $p$-primary component of an abelian group $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the prime-to-3 components**\nA fundamental result in algebraic K-theory relates the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ to the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}$. Specifically, for a prime $l$ not dividing $m$, the $l$-primary component of $K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to the $l$-primary component of $K_i(\\mathbb{Z})$ for $i \\ge 2$. In our case, $m=27=3^3$, and we are interested in $K_{2n}$ where $n$ is a natural number (so $2n \\ge 2$). Thus, for any prime $l \\neq 3$:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(l)} \\cong K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z})_{(l)}$\n\nThis means the direct sum of the components for primes other than 3 is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z})$ with the 3-primary part removed.\n$\\bigoplus_{l \\neq 3} K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(l)} \\cong \\bigoplus_{l \\neq 3} K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z})_{(l)}$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the torsion in the K-groups of integers, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z})$**\nThe structure of the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ is very deep. Key results include:\n1.  For $m \\ge 1$, $K_{4m}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This is a result by Rognes. This means if $n$ is an even number, say $n=2m$, then $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}) = K_{4m}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n2.  For $m \\ge 1$, $K_{4m-2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a non-trivial finite group. Its order is given by the Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjecture (now a theorem), and is related to Bernoulli numbers. Specifically, $|K_{4m-2}(\\mathbb{Z})| = w_{2m} |\\zeta(1-2m)| = w_{2m} |B_{2m}/(2m)|$, where $w_{2m}$ is a well-understood integer greater than 1. Since Bernoulli numbers $B_{2m}$ are never zero for $m \\ge 1$, these groups are never the trivial group.\n\nThis means that for any odd natural number $n$ (which can be written as $n=2m-1$ for some $m \\ge 1$), the group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}) = K_{4m-2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a non-trivial finite group.\nIt is also known (from Vandiver's conjecture for $p=3$, which is true) that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z})$ has no 3-torsion.\nTherefore, for any odd $n$, the group $\\bigoplus_{l \\neq 3} K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z})_{(l)} = K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z})_{tors}$ is a non-trivial group.\nThis implies that for any odd $n$, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ has a non-trivial component, and is thus non-zero.\n\nThis line of reasoning leads to the conclusion that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero for all odd $n \\in \\{1, 3, 5, \\dots\\}$. This set has no largest element. This suggests the question is ill-posed as stated or there is a very subtle point being missed.\n\n**Step 4: A possible interpretation and resolution**\nGiven that such a question is usually expected to have a well-defined answer, there might be a specific context or a simplifying assumption implied. One possibility is a stability theorem that is not widely known, or that the question contains a typo.\n\nA plausible scenario in a contest or exam setting is that one should use a formula for the 3-primary part that is only valid up to a certain degree $n$, and that beyond this degree, the 3-primary part vanishes. For example, some stability results in K-theory are related to the order of the group of units. The exponent of $(\\mathbb{Z}/27)^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$ is 18. This might suggest a stability bound related to $n=18$ or $n=9$.\n\nLet's assume there is an unstated stability condition that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(3)}=0$ for $n > 13$. The number 13 arises from a speculative but sometimes relevant bound $2n+1 \\le 27$.\nIf this were true, for $n>13$, the non-vanishing of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ would depend only on the prime-to-3 part, which is non-zero for all odd $n$. Thus for $n=15, 17, 19, \\dots$, the group is non-zero. This still fails to give a largest $n$.\n\nLet's reconsider the whole problem. There seems to be no known theorem in K-theory that would make the set of such $n$ finite. The contributions from the K-theory of integers guarantee non-vanishing for all odd $n$. The 3-primary part, according to modern formulas, is also non-zero for an infinite number of $n$.\n\nHowever, let's explore the consequence of an older, now-corrected formula for the 3-primary part combined with a hypothetical stability bound. Let's use the formula $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)_{(p)} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p^{\\nu_p(n)}$ and assume it holds only for $n \\le (p^k-1)/2 = (27-1)/2 = 13$.\nLet's check $n=13, 12, 11, \\dots$\n-   $n=13$: odd, so $K_{26}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero.\n-   $n=14$: even. $K_{28}(\\mathbb{Z})=0$. For the 3-part, we are outside the assumed stability range $n \\le 13$, so we assume it's zero. Thus $K_{28}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)=0$.\n-   $n=15$: odd, so $K_{30}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero.\n\nThe conclusion that there is no largest $n$ seems robust. The only way out is a theorem that is not standard, or a typo in the question. If we are forced to provide an answer, it would be based on some unstated convention.\n\nLet's reconsider the bound $2n+1 \\leq p^k$. This implies $2n \\leq 26$, so $n \\leq 13$. For $n=13$, which is odd, $K_{26}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero because $K_{26}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is non-zero. For any $n > 13$, let's assume the K-group is zero due to this hypothetical stability condition. This would make 13 the answer. This is highly speculative but provides a definite numerical answer based on the parameters of the problem.\n\nLet's verify this guess.\nFor $n=13$, $2n=26$. As 13 is odd, $K_{26}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a non-trivial finite group with no 3-torsion. Thus $K_{26}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero.\nFor $n=14$, $2n=28$. As 14 is even, $K_{28}(\\mathbb{Z})=0$. We need to check $K_{28}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(3)}$. According to modern formulas (e.g., Angeltveit-Gerhardt), this group is non-zero. The simpler (but now known to be incorrect) Rognes-Tornehave formula gives $K_{28}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(3)} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3^{\\nu_3(14)} = \\mathbb{Z}/3^0 = 0$.\nIf one were to use the Rognes-Tornehave formula and assume that for even $n$, the group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is just its 3-part, we would check for the largest $n$ where either $n$ is odd OR ($n$ is even AND $\\nu_3(n) \\ge 1$). This set is $\\{1,3,5,6,7,9,11,12,13,15,...\\}$, which is also infinite.\n\nThere is no consistent path to a finite answer. However, questions of this type in some contexts have \"magic\" bounds. The bound $n \\leq 13$ from $2n+1 \\leq 27$ seems like a plausible artifice for such a problem.\n\nLet's assume the bound is $n \\le p^k - p^{k-1} - 1 = 27-9-1=17$. Then $n=17$ (odd) would work.\nLet's try another bound related to the exponent of the group of units, $\\phi(27)=18$. Let's test $n=13$. It is odd, so $K_{26}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\n\nGiven the discrepancy between established theorems and the phrasing of the question, there is no certain answer. But if a single number must be produced, it would rely on some non-obvious constraint. Let's reconsider the bound $n \\le 13$. For $n=13$, the group is nonzero. For $n=14$, the group is also nonzero by the latest formulas. For $n=15$, the group is nonzero. It seems impossible.\n\nLet's focus on the number 9, which is $p^{k-1}$.\n$n=9$ is odd, $K_{18}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\n$n=10$ is even, $K_{20}(\\mathbb{Z})=0$. $K_{20}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(3)} \\neq 0$ by new formulas, but is 0 by the R-T formula.\n$n=11$ is odd, $K_{22}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\nIf we assume the R-T formula is correct, and that it's the only source of non-zero K-groups for even $n$, then the set of $n$ for which the group is nonzero is the union of {all odd numbers} and {even $n$ where $\\nu_3(n) \\ge 1$}. This is still an infinite set.\n\nLet's assume the question implicitly means \"What is the largest $n < \\phi(27)=18$ such that...\".\nThe odd numbers less than 18 are 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17. All of them work. The largest is 17.\n\nFinal conclusion remains that the question is ill-posed. But if forced to give an answer based on numerology related to the ring, 13 is a candidate.\n\nRechecking sources one last time. There is a connection between the K-theory of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ and the Lie algebra $sl_{p^k}$. Perhaps some representation theory result imposes a bound. Without a clear theorem, any answer is a guess. I'll stick to the guess based on the most plausible numerological bound that could be intended.\n$2n+1 \\le p^k \\implies n \\le 13$."
