awk 'BEGIN{FS="\t"} NR>1 && $3 > 5 && $7 < 0.05 {print $1}' differential_expression_results.tsv > contaminant_genes_to_remove.txt'
This command line strategy filters a standard differential expression results file (`differential_expression_results.tsv`) to identify contaminating genes. It assumes the file is tab-separated (`FS="\t"`), skips the header (`NR>1`), and selects genes where the log2 fold change (in column 3) is greater than 5 and the adjusted p-value (in column 7) is less than 0.05. The names of these identified contaminant genes are then saved to a new file named `contaminant_genes_to_remove.txt`. You must adjust the column numbers ($3, $7) to match the exact structure of your results file.
