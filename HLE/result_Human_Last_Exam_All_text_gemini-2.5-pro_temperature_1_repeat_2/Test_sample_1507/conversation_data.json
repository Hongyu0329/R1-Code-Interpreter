    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometric Object**\nThe object in question is the **great icosahedron**. This is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. A key feature of the great icosahedron is that its 20 triangular faces intersect each other. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the \"Outer-Hull\"**\nThe question asks about the \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron. This term refers to the **convex hull** of the shape. The convex hull is the smallest convex polyhedron that can enclose the entire object. Imagine stretching a rubber sheet over the points of the great icosahedron; the resulting shape is its convex hull.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Outer-Hull**\nThe 12 vertices of the great icosahedron are arranged in the same way as the vertices of a **regular icosahedron**. Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. The question is essentially asking about the surface of this resulting regular icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Understand the Task - \"Minimal Triangulation\"**\nThe task is to find the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating\" the outer-hull. A triangulation of a surface is a division of that surface into a set of triangles. The term \"minimal\" implies we should use the fewest possible triangles to cover the entire surface.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Surface of the Regular Icosahedron**\nThe outer-hull is a regular icosahedron. By its definition, a regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid constructed from 20 identical equilateral triangular faces.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Concepts**\nThe surface of the regular icosahedron (the outer-hull) is already perfectly partitioned into 20 triangles. This existing structure *is* a triangulation of the surface. Since we are looking for the *minimal* number of triangles, and the surface is already naturally composed of these 20 triangles, this is the minimal triangulation. It is impossible to form the closed surface of an icosahedron with fewer than 20 triangles. The number of visible triangles from the outside is simply the number of faces of its convex hull.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Do not confuse the great icosahedron with the regular icosahedron.** The question is not about the 20 self-intersecting faces of the great icosahedron itself, but about the visible surface that encloses it.\n*   **Correctly identify the outer-hull.** The outer-hull (convex hull) of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n*   **Recognize that the standard faces of the icosahedron form a minimal triangulation.** There is no need for a more complex triangulation algorithm; the fundamental definition of the shape provides the answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is composed of 20 triangular faces. This is the minimal number of triangles required to form its surface.\n\n<<<20>>>"
