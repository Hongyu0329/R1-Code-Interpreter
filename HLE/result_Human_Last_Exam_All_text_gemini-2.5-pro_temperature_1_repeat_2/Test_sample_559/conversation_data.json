    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the system.\n\n**1. Identify the System and Find Equilibrium Points**\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (5u^2(t) - 3u(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1 - u(t))$$\n$$u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u^2(t)$$\nWe are considering the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\nEquilibrium points are found by setting $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$. So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n**2. Classify the Equilibrium Points (Linearization)**\n\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u,d)$ of the system:\n$$ J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u - 3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n*   At $(1,0)$: $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Both are positive, so $(1,0)$ is an unstable node.\n*   At $(1,-1)$: $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. They have opposite signs, so $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point.\n*   At $(0,0)$: $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a non-hyperbolic point, and linearization is inconclusive.\n\n**3. Identify the Separatrices**\n\nSeparatrices are special trajectories that separate regions of different qualitative behavior. They are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. Here, the saddle point is $(1,-1)$. We need to find its stable and unstable manifolds.\n\n**4. Search for Invariant Algebraic Curves**\n\nA powerful method for finding separatrices is to look for invariant algebraic curves, i.e., solutions of the form $d=f(u)$ or more generally $F(u,d)=0$. Let's try to find an invariant curve of the form $d = au^2 + bu + c$.\nWe need to satisfy the equation $\\frac{d(d)}{dt} = \\frac{d(au^2+bu+c)}{du} \\frac{du}{dt}$.\nThis leads to the identity:\n$$(2au+b)(u^3-u^2) = 2(au^2+bu+c)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(au^2+bu+c) - u^3(1-u)$$\nExpanding both sides and equating the coefficients of powers of $u$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $u^0: 0 = 2c^2 \\implies c=0$\n    \\item $u^1: 0 = 4bc - 3c = c(4b-3)$. This is satisfied since $c=0$.\n    \\item $u^2: -b = 2b^2 + 4ac + 5c - 3b$. With $c=0$, this becomes $-b = 2b^2 - 3b \\implies 2b^2 - 2b = 0 \\implies 2b(b-1)=0$. So $b=0$ or $b=1$.\n    \\item $u^4: 2a = 2a^2 + 5a + 1 \\implies 2a^2 + 3a + 1 = 0 \\implies (2a+1)(a+1)=0$. So $a=-1$ or $a=-1/2$.\n    \\item $u^3: b-2a = 4ab + 5b - 3a - 1 \\implies 4ab + 4b - a - 1 = 0$.\n\\end{itemize}\nWe check the combinations of $a$ and $b$ in the last equation:\n*   Case 1: $b=0$. The equation becomes $-a-1=0 \\implies a=-1$. This is a valid pair. So $(a,b,c)=(-1,0,0)$ gives an invariant curve $d = -u^2$.\n*   Case 2: $b=1$. The equation becomes $4a(1)+4(1)-a-1=0 \\implies 3a+3=0 \\implies a=-1$. This is a valid pair. So $(a,b,c)=(-1,1,0)$ gives an invariant curve $d = -u^2+u = u(1-u)$.\n\nWe have found two non-trivial invariant curves: $d=-u^2$ and $d=u(1-u)$.\n\n**5. Match Invariant Curves to Saddle Manifolds**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(1,-1)$. We check which of our found curves pass through this point.\n*   For $d=-u^2$: If $u=1$, $d=-(1)^2=-1$. This curve passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n*   For $d=u(1-u)$: If $u=1$, $d=1(1-1)=0$. This curve passes through the unstable node $(1,0)$.\n\nTherefore, the curve $d=-u^2$ is a manifold of the saddle point. To determine if it's the stable or unstable manifold, we check its tangent at $(1,-1)$. The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2$.\nThe eigenvectors of the Jacobian at $(1,-1)$, $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$, are:\n*   For $\\lambda_1=1$ (unstable): $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is proportional to $(1, -2)$, with slope $-2$.\n*   For $\\lambda_2=-2$ (stable): $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies v_u = 0$. The eigenvector is proportional to $(0, 1)$, which corresponds to a vertical tangent.\n\nSince the slope of $d=-u^2$ at $(1,-1)$ matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector, $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\nThe stable manifold corresponds to the vertical direction, so it must be the line $u=1$ (one can verify that $u=1$ is an invariant line since $u'=0$ when $u=1$).\n\nBoth the stable manifold ($u=1$) and the unstable manifold ($d=-u^2$) of the saddle point are separatrices. The line $u=1$ separates the phase plane into regions where $u(t) \\to 0$ (for $u<1$) and $u(t) \\to \\infty$ (for $u>1$). The curve $d=-u^2$ is a heteroclinic orbit connecting the saddle point $(1,-1)$ to the degenerate equilibrium $(0,0)$. In the context of such problems, the non-trivial invariant curve that corresponds to a manifold of a saddle is often the intended answer for \"the separatrix\".\n\nThe separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n>>> $d = -u^2$"
