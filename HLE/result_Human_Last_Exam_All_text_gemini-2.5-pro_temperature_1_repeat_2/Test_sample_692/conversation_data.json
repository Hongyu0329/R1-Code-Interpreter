    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe key components of the question are:\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This refers to a specific point in time (e.g., a specific day, month, and year), not just the earliest evidence of a calendrical system in general.\n*   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed or written down.\n*   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must have existed in the Americas before 1492.\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The script used must be native to the Americas.\n\nThis means we are looking for the oldest surviving artifact with a specific, translatable date written in a native script.\n\n**2. Identify Candidate Civilizations and Systems**\nThe most advanced calendrical and writing systems in the pre-Columbian Americas were found in Mesoamerica. The system best suited for recording specific, absolute dates is the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. This system counts the number of days that have passed since a mythological starting point. The primary civilizations that used early forms of this system were the Olmec (and their successors, the Epi-Olmec), the Zapotec, and the Maya.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Evidence**\n\n*   **Zapotec Evidence (San José Mogote):**\n    *   **Artifact**: Monument 3 from the site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico.\n    *   **Date of Artifact**: Archaeologically dated to approximately 600 BCE.\n    *   **Recorded Information**: The monument includes a glyph interpreted as \"1 Earthquake,\" a day name from the 260-day ritual calendar.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This is indeed very early evidence of calendrical writing. However, a day name like \"1 Earthquake\" is cyclical; it recurs every 260 days. It does not pinpoint a unique historical date in the way a year, month, and day would. It is like recording \"a Tuesday\" without specifying which one.\n\n*   **Maya Evidence (Tikal):**\n    *   **Artifact**: Stela 29 from the Maya city of Tikal in Guatemala.\n    *   **Date of Artifact**: The date recorded is contemporary with the carving of the stela.\n    *   **Recorded Information**: The stela is inscribed with the Long Count date 8.12.14.8.15.\n    *   **Translation**: This date corresponds to **July 6, 292 CE**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: While this is a very early, specific Long Count date, other non-Maya examples are known to be much older.\n\n*   **Epi-Olmec Evidence (Tres Zapotes):**\n    *   **Artifact**: Stela C from the site of Tres Zapotes in Veracruz, Mexico. This artifact is associated with the Epi-Olmec culture, which succeeded the Olmec.\n    *   **Recorded Information**: One side of the stela is carved with a date in the Long Count system. The number sequence is **7.16.6.16.18**.\n    *   **Translation**: The Mesoamerican Long Count starts from a fixed point equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE in the Gregorian calendar (using the standard GMT correlation). The date 7.16.6.16.18 on Stela C calculates to a specific day.\n        *   7 baktuns (7 x 144,000 days)\n        *   16 katuns (16 x 7,200 days)\n        *   6 tuns (6 x 360 days)\n        *   16 uinals (16 x 20 days)\n        *   18 kins (18 x 1 day)\n    This corresponds to the Gregorian date of **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This is a complete, absolute date that specifies a single day in a great cycle of over 5,000 years. It is both specific and historically very early.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the candidates, the date recorded on **Stela C from Tres Zapotes** is the earliest known *specific, absolute date* recorded in an aboriginal American writing system. While the Zapotec monument from San José Mogote is an older artifact with a calendrical sign, the date it records is cyclical and not historically specific. The Epi-Olmec date from Stela C, **32 BCE**, predates the earliest known Maya Long Count date (292 CE) by over 300 years.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas is **September 3, 32 BCE**. This date was inscribed in the Long Count calendar format on Stela C from Tres Zapotes, an Epi-Olmec site in Veracruz, Mexico.\n\n<<<September 3, 32 BCE>>>"
