    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack you should open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Conditions:**\n    *   **Game:** No-Limit Hold'em Cash Game.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the last position to act post-flop, giving you a significant informational advantage. This allows for the widest and most profitable opening range of any position.\n    *   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x. This is a standard raise size, and we are considering what hands are profitable to \"Raise First In\" (RFI).\n    *   **Stack Size:** 100 Big Blinds (BB). This is the standard stack depth for cash games, and most GTO (Game Theory Optimal) charts are based on this depth.\n    *   **Rake:** Rake-free. This is a critical point. Rake is the fee taken by the house from a pot. In games with rake, very marginal hands can become unprofitable because the small edge they have is eaten by the rake. In a rake-free environment, any hand with a positive Expected Value (EV), no matter how small, is a profitable open. This encourages opening a wider range of hands.\n    *   **Hand Type:** \"Suited Jack\". This refers to any hand containing a Jack and another card of the same suit. The possible hands are JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n\n2.  **Define \"Worst Suited Jack You Should Open\":**\n    *   This phrase is asking for the hand at the absolute bottom of the opening range within the \"suited jack\" category. It's not the worst suited jack in existence (which is clearly J2s), but the worst one that is *still a standard, profitable open* under these specific conditions. We are looking for the cutoff point.\n\n3.  **Ranking the Suited Jacks:**\n    *   The strength of a suited jack is determined by its kicker. A higher kicker provides better high-card value, less chance of being dominated, and better straight potential.\n    *   The ranking from best to worst is: JAs > JKs > JQs > JTs > J9s > J8s > J7s > J6s > J5s > J4s > J3s > J2s.\n\n4.  **Applying GTO Principles for the Button:**\n    *   The button's opening range is extremely wide due to its positional advantage. A typical GTO button opening range at 100BB is around 45-50% of all possible hands.\n    *   Hands are chosen for this range based on a combination of raw equity (high cards), connectivity (potential to make straights), and suitedness (potential to make flushes).\n    *   Suitedness is particularly valuable from the button because you are more likely to see a flop and have the positional advantage to realize your flush draw equity (by betting, checking, or calling appropriately).\n\n5.  **Determining the Cutoff Point:**\n    *   Due to the power of position and the added incentive of a rake-free game, a standard GTO button opening strategy includes *all* suited jacks.\n    *   **JTs, J9s, J8s:** These are very strong opens with excellent straight and flush potential.\n    *   **J7s, J6s, J5s:** These are still clear opens. They have good flush potential and some gapped straight potential.\n    *   **J4s, J3s, J2s:** These are the most marginal candidates. Their main value comes from their ability to make a flush. While their straight potential is very weak and they are susceptible to kicker problems if you only hit a Jack, their playability from the button is high enough. In a rake-free game, their slight positive EV makes them a mandatory open-raise.\n    *   Since a standard GTO range for these conditions includes opening all suited hands from a Jack-high down to a Jack-low, the range is J2s+ (meaning J2s and everything better).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have established the ranking of suited jacks from best to worst.\n    *   We have determined that a GTO opening range from the button in a 100BB rake-free game includes all of these hands.\n    *   Therefore, the \"worst\" hand in this category that you *should* open is the one at the very bottom of the ranking: **J2s**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Position is Paramount:** This answer is only correct for the button. From an earlier position like Under The Gun (UTG), the answer would be drastically different (likely JTs or J9s).\n*   **Rake Matters:** If the game had a high rake, J2s (and potentially J3s, J4s) might become a \"mixed strategy\" (open sometimes, fold other times) or a pure fold, as the rake would erase its profitability. The \"rake-free\" detail is what makes it a clear open.\n*   **Abbreviation:** The required format is the abbreviated hand name, e.g., \"JTs\".\n\nThe final answer is the lowest-ranked suited jack that is still considered a standard open-raise in this scenario.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
