    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Object of Study\nThe question asks about the category $C$ of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let's denote this algebra by $U_q$.\n\n*   **The Algebra $U_q = u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$:** This algebra is generated by elements $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ subject to certain relations.\n*   **Condition $q$ is a primitive third root of unity:** This means $q^3=1$ and $q \\neq 1$. Let $\\ell=3$ be the order of $q$. This condition is crucial because the representation theory of $U_q$ at a root of unity is fundamentally different from the generic case (where $q$ is not a root of unity). Specifically, the algebra is not semisimple.\n*   **Irreducible vs. Indecomposable:**\n    *   An **irreducible** (or simple) representation is a non-zero representation with no proper non-trivial subrepresentations.\n    *   An **indecomposable** representation is a non-zero representation that cannot be written as a direct sum of two non-trivial subrepresentations.\n    *   Every irreducible representation is indecomposable. Because the algebra is not semisimple, the converse is not true; there exist indecomposable representations that are not irreducible.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the ratio of the number of irreducible objects to the number of indecomposable objects in $C$, expressed as a percentage. This requires us to count the isomorphism classes of both types of objects.\n\n### Careful Point 1: The Center of $U_q$ and Block Decomposition\nWhen $q$ is a root of unity of order $\\ell=3$, the elements $E^3, F^3,$ and $K^3$ are in the center of $U_q$. By Schur's Lemma, on any finite-dimensional indecomposable representation, these central elements must act as scalar multiples of the identity. This allows the category of finite-dimensional representations to be decomposed into a direct sum of subcategories (blocks), indexed by the eigenvalues of the central elements.\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Irreducible Representations\nThe irreducible representations are classified.\n1.  **Representations where $E^3$ and $F^3$ act as zero:** These are the representations of the so-called \"small quantum group\" $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. Their structure is analogous to the representations of the classical $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ in characteristic 3. The irreducible representations in this family are the modules $V_n$ for $1 \\le n < \\ell$. For $\\ell=3$, these are $V_1$ (the trivial 1-dimensional module) and $V_2$ (the 2-dimensional module). So there are $\\ell-1=2$ such irreducible representations.\n2.  **Representations where $E^3$ or $F^3$ act non-trivially:** These representations are all of dimension $\\ell=3$. They are parametrized by continuous parameters from $\\mathbb{C}$. For example, for any pair of non-zero complex numbers $(a,b)$ and a highest weight $\\lambda$, there is an irreducible 3-dimensional representation where $E^3$ acts as scalar $a$ and $F^3$ acts as scalar $b$.\n\nSince there are continuous families of irreducible representations, the total number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations is **infinite**.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Indecomposable Representations\nSince every irreducible representation is indecomposable, and we have already established that there are infinitely many irreducible representations, the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations is also **infinite**.\n\n### Careful Point 2: The Ambiguity of \"Percentage\"\nThe question asks for a percentage, which is a ratio of counts. However, both the set of irreducible objects and the set of indecomposable objects are infinite. Calculating a ratio of infinities is not well-defined without further specification (e.g., a measure on the parameter space of modules).\n\nThis ambiguity strongly suggests that the question is likely intended to be interpreted in a more specific context where counting is possible. The standard simplification in this area is to restrict the problem to the **principal block**, which is the category of representations where all central elements act as they do on the trivial representation. This means we consider representations where $E^3=0, F^3=0,$ and $K^3=1$. This is precisely the category of representations of the **small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$**. This category is the most studied and structurally rich part of the theory.\n\nLet's proceed under the standard assumption that $C$ refers to the category of indecomposable modules for the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of the Small Quantum Group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $\\ell=3$\n\n*   **Irreducible representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$:** As identified in Step 2, these are the modules $L_n$ (previously called $V_n$) for $1 \\le n \\le \\ell-1$. For $\\ell=3$, these are $L_1$ and $L_2$. So, there are exactly **2** irreducible representations.\n\n*   **Indecomposable representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$:** The classification of indecomposable modules depends on the **representation type** of the algebra. For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, the representation type depends on $\\ell$:\n    *   $\\ell=2$: Finite representation type (finitely many indecomposables).\n    *   $\\ell=3$: **Tame representation type**.\n    *   $\\ell \\ge 4$: Wild representation type.\n\nThe question specifies $\\ell=3$, so the algebra is of tame representation type. By definition, an algebra of tame type has **infinitely many** non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. These representations are highly structured; they fall into a finite number of discrete series and a finite number of one-parameter families. For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at $\\ell=3$, the indecomposables include the 2 simple modules, their (non-simple) projective covers, and an infinite \"tube\" family of modules, among others. The key fact is that the total number is infinite.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Final Percentage\nUnder the standard interpretation that the question concerns the principal block (i.e., modules over the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$):\n\n*   Number of non-isomorphic irreducible objects = 2.\n*   Number of non-isomorphic indecomposable objects = $\\infty$.\n\nThe percentage of objects that are irreducible is:\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Irreducibles}}{\\text{Number of Indecomposables}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{2}{\\infty} \\times 100\\% $$\nThis ratio is 0. The set of irreducible representations is a finite subset of the infinite set of all indecomposable representations.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe key to this problem is identifying the representation type of the algebra in question. For $q$ being a primitive third root of unity, the relevant algebra (the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$) is of tame representation type, meaning it has infinitely many distinct indecomposable representations. In contrast, it only has two irreducible representations. Therefore, the irreducible representations make up a zero percentage of the total.\n\n<<<0>>>"
