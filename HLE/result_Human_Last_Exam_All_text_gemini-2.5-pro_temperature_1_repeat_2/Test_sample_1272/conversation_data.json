    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the period of the Ming Dynasty's rule over Vietnam, known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination (1407-1427), and the subsequent Lam Sơn Uprising led by Lê Lợi, which sought to regain Vietnamese independence.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Figure:** The focus is on Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟). He was a veteran commander who, along with Zhang Fu, had successfully led the initial invasion and conquest of Vietnam in 1406-1407. This initial campaign was a victory for him, not a defeat.\n\n3.  **Search for Mu Sheng's Defeat:** We need to look for a major defeat *after* the initial conquest. The critical period is the Lam Sơn Uprising. The turning point of this war occurred in 1426-1427 when the Vietnamese forces gained the upper hand.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Campaign of 1427:** In response to major setbacks in 1426 (like the Battle of Tốt Động-Chúc Động, which was a defeat for Ming General Wang Tong, not Mu Sheng), the Ming Emperor sent a massive two-pronged relief expedition in 1427 to save the besieged Ming forces in the capital, Đông Quan (modern Hanoi).\n    *   One army, led by General Liu Sheng (柳升), advanced from Guangxi (in the east).\n    *   The other army, led by General **Mu Sheng**, advanced from Yunnan (in the west/northwest).\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Decisive Events:** The Vietnamese strategy, devised by Nguyễn Chích, was to concentrate their forces to destroy one Ming army before the other could arrive.\n    *   They first targeted Liu Sheng's army, ambushing and annihilating it at the Battle of Chi Lăng (in modern Lạng Sơn Province). Liu Sheng was killed, and his army was shattered. This was a catastrophic defeat for the Ming, but it was Liu Sheng's defeat.\n    *   At this time, Mu Sheng's army was advancing along the Red River. According to Vietnamese historical records like the *Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư* and the *Khâm định Việt sử Thông giám cương mục*, Mu Sheng had advanced to and built a fortified camp at **Tụy Động** (Tụ Động). This location is historically identified as the area at the confluence of the Red River (Sông Hồng) and the Clear River (Sông Lô).\n\n6.  **Identify Mu Sheng's \"Defeat\":** Upon receiving the news of Liu Sheng's complete destruction, Mu Sheng's army was struck with panic and lost all morale. Fearing a similar fate and realizing his campaign was now hopeless, Mu Sheng abandoned his position and ordered a hasty retreat back to Yunnan without engaging in a major pitched battle. The Vietnamese forces pursued his retreating army, inflicting casualties. This complete failure of his military objective and his forced, panicked retreat constituted his first major defeat as a campaign commander in Vietnam.\n\n7.  **Locate the Site on a Modern Map:** The location where Mu Sheng's campaign failed—the camp at Tụy Động at the confluence of the Red River and the Clear River—corresponds directly to the modern city of **Việt Trì**. Việt Trì is the provincial capital of **Phú Thọ Province**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing between generals:** It's important not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with the earlier, more famous defeats of other Ming generals like Wang Tong (at Tốt Động-Chúc Động) or Liu Sheng (at Chi Lăng).\n*   **Defining \"defeat\":** Mu Sheng's defeat was not a dramatic loss in a single pitched battle but a strategic failure—the complete collapse of his campaign's objective and a panicked retreat under pressure. This is universally regarded as a major defeat.\n*   **Geographical accuracy:** Correctly identifying the historical location of Tụy Động at the confluence of the Red and Clear rivers is key to finding the modern province.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nMing General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred during the 1427 campaign when his relief army, having advanced to the confluence of the Red and Clear Rivers, lost its nerve upon hearing of the other Ming army's destruction and fled back to Yunnan. This location is now the city of Việt Trì, the capital of Phú Thọ Province.\n\n<<<Phú Thọ Province>>>"
