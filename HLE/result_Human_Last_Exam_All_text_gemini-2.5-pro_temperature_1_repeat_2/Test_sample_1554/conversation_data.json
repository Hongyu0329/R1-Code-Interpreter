    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific philosopher who belongs to a particular philosophical school and is known for a specific conceptual analysis.\n*   **Philosophical School:** The Lviv-Warsaw School.\n*   **Conceptual Analysis:** Decomposing the notion of a \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Lviv-Warsaw School**\n*   **Who:** The Lviv-Warsaw School was a highly influential group of Polish logicians and analytic philosophers active in the period between the World Wars (approx. 1918-1939).\n*   **Founder:** Its founder and central figure was Kazimierz Twardowski.\n*   **Key Members:** Other major figures include Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n*   **Core Tenets:** The school was known for its commitment to clarity, rigor, logical analysis, anti-irrationalism, and a scientific approach to philosophical problems.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Philosophical Distinction**\nThe question centers on the breakdown of the concept of a \"hallmark\" (in Polish, *oznaka*, which can also be translated as \"sign\" or \"mark\"). This is a semiotic or epistemological distinction concerning how one thing can indicate another.\n*   **Symptom (*symptom*):** This refers to a *natural* sign. The connection between the symptom and what it signifies is based on a natural or causal law, independent of human convention.\n    *   *Careful Point/Example:* Smoke is a symptom of fire. The relationship is causal. A high fever is a symptom of an illness. The relationship is biological. No one had to agree to this; it's an observable fact of nature.\n*   **Signal (*sygnał*):** This refers to a *conventional* or *artificial* sign. The connection between the signal and what it signifies is established by a rule, agreement, or human convention for the purpose of communication or regulation.\n    *   *Careful Point/Example:* A red traffic light is a signal to stop. This meaning is based entirely on traffic laws and social agreement, not a natural law. The word \"cat\" is a signal for the animal, based on the conventions of the English language.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Distinction to a Philosopher**\nNow, we must identify which member of the Lviv-Warsaw School is known for this specific analysis. We can evaluate the most likely candidates based on their primary areas of work.\n*   Twardowski was the founder, focused on the theory of objects and presentations.\n*   Łukasiewicz and Leśniewski were primarily logicians.\n*   Tarski was a logician and mathematician, famous for his theory of truth.\n*   Kotarbiński was known for his ontology (reism) and praxiology.\n*   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** was a prominent figure whose work spanned epistemology, semantics, and the philosophy of language and science. He was deeply interested in the analysis of meaning, inference, and scientific language.\n\nThis specific distinction between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) is a well-known part of **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz's** work on semiotics and epistemology. He used this analysis to clarify the nature of evidence and inference.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude**\nThe philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who analyzed the general notion of a hallmark (*oznaka*) and decomposed it into symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. This distinction was fundamental to his analysis of language and knowledge.\n\n***\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
