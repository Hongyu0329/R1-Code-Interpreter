    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n**Step 1: Define the objects and the problem**\n\n*   `C`: A complex algebraic curve (Riemann surface) of genus `g = 3`.\n*   `X = C^(15)`: The 15th symmetric power of `C`. This is the variety parametrizing effective divisors of degree 15 on `C`.\n*   `NS(X)`: The Neron-Severi group of `X`, which is the group of divisor classes on `X` modulo algebraic equivalence.\n*   `ρ(X) = rank(NS(X))`: The rank of the Neron-Severi group, also known as the Picard number of `X`.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum and maximum possible values of `ρ(X)` as `C` varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Picard number to Hodge theory**\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group, `ρ(X)`, is the dimension of the space of divisor classes on `X` modulo homological equivalence. By the Lefschetz (1,1)-theorem, this is a subspace of the second cohomology group `H^2(X, Q)`. Specifically, it is the dimension of the space of rational Hodge classes of type (1,1):\n`ρ(X) = dim_Q (H^(1,1)(X, C) ∩ H^2(X, Q))`\nwhere `H^(1,1)(X, C)` is the (1,1)-part of the Hodge decomposition of the complex cohomology `H^2(X, C)`.\n\nA crucial point is that `ρ(X)` is bounded by the Hodge number `h^(1,1)(X) = dim_C H^(1,1)(X, C)`. The equality `ρ(X) = dim_Q (H^(1,1)(X, C) ∩ H^2(X, Q))` holds if the Hodge conjecture is true for divisors on `X`. For symmetric powers `C^(d)` of a curve `C` of genus `g`, this is known to be true when `d ≥ g`. In our case, `d = 15` and `g = 3`, so the condition is satisfied.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the cohomology of the symmetric power `X = C^(15)`**\n\nThe cohomology of a symmetric power `C^(d)` is related to the cohomology of the curve `C` itself by a famous formula of Macdonald. For the second cohomology group, this formula gives an isomorphism:\n`H^2(C^(d), Q) ≅ H^2(C, Q) ⊕ Sym^2(H^1(C, Q))`\nThis isomorphism respects the Hodge structures. We are interested in `d=15` and `g=3`.\n\nLet's analyze the Hodge classes in each part of this direct sum:\n1.  **`H^2(C, Q)`**: This space is 1-dimensional, spanned by the fundamental class of the curve. This class is always of type (1,1). Therefore, this summand always contributes 1 to the rank `ρ(X)`. This class corresponds geometrically to the divisor `Θ_{p} = \\{D \\in C^(15) | p \\in \\text{supp}(D)\\}` for a fixed point `p \\in C`.\n\n2.  **`Sym^2(H^1(C, Q))`**: This is the space of symmetric tensors on the first cohomology group of `C`. We need to find the dimension of the subspace of Hodge classes within this space. A class in `Sym^2(H^1(C, Q))` is a Hodge class if, when viewed in `Sym^2(H^1(C, C))`, it lies in the `(1,1)`-part, which is `H^(1,0)(C) ⊗ H^(0,1)(C)`.\n\n**Step 4: Relate Hodge classes to the Jacobian of C**\n\nThe first cohomology group `H^1(C, Q)` is intimately related to the Jacobian variety `J(C) = Pic^0(C)` of the curve `C`. `J(C)` is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension `g=3`. The space `H^1(C, Q)` is the underlying rational vector space for the Tate module of `J(C)`.\n\nThe space of Hodge classes in `H^1(C, Q) ⊗ H^1(C, Q)` is known to be isomorphic to the algebra of endomorphisms of the Jacobian, `End(J(C)) ⊗ Q`. The subspace of symmetric Hodge classes, which lies in `Sym^2(H^1(C, Q))`, corresponds to the endomorphisms that are symmetric with respect to the Rosati involution (induced by the principal polarization on `J(C)`).\n\nThe dimension of this space of symmetric endomorphisms is precisely the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian, `ρ(J(C))`.\nTherefore, the contribution to `ρ(X)` from the `Sym^2(H^1(C, Q))` part is `ρ(J(C))`.\n\nCombining the two parts, we get a fundamental formula:\n`ρ(X) = ρ(C^(15)) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`\n\n**Step 5: Find the range of possible values for `ρ(J(C))`**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of `ρ(J(C))` for a genus 3 curve `C`.\n`J(C)` is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. For any abelian variety `A` of dimension `g`, its Picard number `ρ(A)` is bounded by `1 ≤ ρ(A) ≤ g^2`.\nFor `J(C)`, we have `g=3`, so `1 ≤ ρ(J(C)) ≤ 3^2 = 9`.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank:** The smallest rank `ρ(J(C)) = 1` occurs for a \"generic\" curve `C`. In this case, the only endomorphisms of `J(C)` are the trivial ones (multiplication by integers), so `End(J(C)) = Z`. The Neron-Severi group `NS(J(C))` is then generated solely by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), so its rank is 1. Since the locus of curves with more endomorphisms is a proper subvariety of the moduli space `M_3`, this case is generic.\n\n*   **Largest possible rank:** The largest rank `ρ(J(C)) = g^2 = 9` is achieved when `J(C)` has complex multiplication (CM). This occurs for very special curves. For a Jacobian `J(C)` to have `ρ(J(C)) = g^2`, it must be isogenous to a product of `g` identical CM elliptic curves. For `g=3`, there exist curves `C` whose Jacobians have this property. A prominent example is the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation `x^4 + y^4 = z^4`, which has genus 3. Its Jacobian is isogenous to the product `E × E × E`, where `E` is an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by `Z[i]`. For such a variety, the Picard number is `3^2 = 9`.\n\nTherefore, the rank `ρ(J(C))` for a genus 3 curve `C` can range from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 9.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the smallest and largest ranks for `ρ(X)`**\n\nUsing the formula `ρ(X) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`, we can find the range for `ρ(X)`.\n\n*   **Smallest rank of NS(X):**\n    `ρ(X)_min = 1 + ρ(J(C))_min = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Largest rank of NS(X):**\n    `ρ(X)_max = 1 + ρ(J(C))_max = 1 + 9 = 10`.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
