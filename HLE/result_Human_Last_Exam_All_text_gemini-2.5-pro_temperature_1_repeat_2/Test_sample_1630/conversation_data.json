    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the mathematical setup**\n\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\nThe problem states that their first derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$.\nWe need to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $H(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $H(x) = x$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the properties of f(x) and g(x)**\n\n*   **Degree 3 polynomials:**\n    *   $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n    *   $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$ with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n\n*   **Positive derivative condition:**\n    *   The derivative of a degree 3 polynomial is a degree 2 polynomial (a quadratic).\n    *   $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$. For $f'(x)$ to be positive for all $x$, its graph (a parabola) must open upwards and never touch or cross the x-axis.\n        1.  The leading coefficient must be positive: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$.\n        2.  The discriminant must be negative: $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\n    *   Similarly, for $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1 > 0$, we must have $b_3 > 0$ and $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n\n*   **Monotonicity:**\n    *   A function with a positive derivative is strictly increasing. Therefore, both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions over the entire real line.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the equation for fixed points**\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n*   **Degree of the composite function:**\n    The degree of $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n    Degree($f(g(x))$) = Degree($f$) $\\times$ Degree($g$) = $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n*   **The equation to solve:**\n    The equation $f(g(x)) = x$ can be rewritten as $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n    This is a polynomial equation. Since the leading term of $f(g(x))$ is $a_3(b_3x^3)^3 = a_3b_3^3x^9$, the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ has degree 9.\n\n*   **Maximum number of roots:**\n    By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Our goal is to determine if it's possible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $f(g(x))=x$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n\n**Step 4: Geometric Interpretation**\n\nThe equation $f(g(x)) = x$ can be analyzed as the intersection of two curves in the xy-plane.\nLet $y = g(x)$. Then the equation $f(y) = x$.\nSo, the number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is equal to the number of intersection points of the two curves:\n1.  $C_1: y = g(x)$\n2.  $C_2: x = f(y)$\n\n*   **Nature of the curves:**\n    *   $C_1$ is the graph of a strictly increasing cubic polynomial.\n    *   $C_2$ is also the graph of a strictly increasing cubic polynomial, but with the roles of $x$ and $y$ interchanged.\n    *   Both equations, $y - g(x) = 0$ and $x - f(y) = 0$, define cubic curves in the plane.\n\n*   **Intersection of two cubic curves:**\n    According to Bezout's theorem, the maximum number of intersection points for two distinct plane curves of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$ is $d_1 \\times d_2$, provided they don't share a common component.\n    In our case, the degrees are $d_1=3$ and $d_2=3$, so the maximum number of intersection points is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n**Step 5: Verifying the possibility of 9 real intersections**\n\nWe need to ensure that the constraints ($f'>0$ and $g'>0$) do not prevent the maximum of 9 intersections from being achieved.\n1.  **Non-singular curves:** A curve $F(x,y)=0$ is non-singular if the partial derivatives $\\partial F/\\partial x$ and $\\partial F/\\partial y$ are not simultaneously zero at any point on the curve.\n    *   For $C_1: y-g(x)=0$, the partial derivatives are $-g'(x)$ and $1$. Since the partial derivative with respect to $y$ is always 1, the curve is non-singular.\n    *   For $C_2: x-f(y)=0$, the partial derivatives are $1$ and $-f'(y)$. Since the partial derivative with respect to $x$ is always 1, this curve is also non-singular.\n    The condition that the derivatives are positive ensures the curves are non-singular.\n\n2.  **Achievability:** It is a known result in algebraic geometry (from the work of Gudkov and others on Hilbert's 16th problem) that the maximum number of intersections predicted by Bezout's theorem can be achieved by real, non-singular curves. While constructing a specific example is complicated, we can reason that it is possible.\n    *   If we choose symmetric functions like $f(x) = g(x) = x^3 + \\epsilon x$ (with $\\epsilon > 0$), we only get 3 fixed points.\n    *   To get more intersections, we need to break the symmetry. This can be done by choosing cubics whose inflection points are located at different positions and by adjusting their \"wiggles\".\n    *   For example, we can choose a cubic $g(x)$ that is very \"flat\" (i.e., has a small slope) near its inflection point, and a similar cubic $f(y)$. By shifting the inflection point of $f(y)$ relative to $g(x)$, we can make the two snake-like curves weave around each other, creating multiple intersection points. It is possible to adjust the parameters of the polynomials to create 9 distinct real intersection points.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of intersection points of two specific types of cubic curves. The degree of the resulting polynomial equation for the fixed points is 9, so the number of fixed points cannot exceed 9. Bezout's theorem also gives a maximum of 9 intersections. The conditions on the derivatives ensure the functions are strictly increasing and the corresponding curves are non-singular, which does not preclude the possibility of achieving this maximum. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n>>> 9"
