The edges are progressively smoothed, with sharp corners rounding off and small features being eliminated. Over time, this process causes enclosed regions of one color to shrink and eventually disappear. As $t \rightarrow \infty$, all edges are eliminated, and the image converges to a constant state, being either entirely black or entirely white.
