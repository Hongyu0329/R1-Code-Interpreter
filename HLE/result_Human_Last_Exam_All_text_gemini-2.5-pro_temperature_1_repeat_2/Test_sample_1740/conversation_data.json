    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans to date. This requires consulting authoritative and current biological databases.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"let-7 Family Member\"**\nThe let-7 family is a group of miRNAs that are highly conserved across species and share a common \"seed sequence,\" which determines their target genes. When counting \"members,\" there are two common interpretations:\n1.  **Unique mature miRNA sequences:** The final, functional small RNA molecules (e.g., let-7a, let-7b).\n2.  **Distinct precursor genes:** The specific locations in the genome that encode these miRNAs. A single type of mature miRNA can be encoded by multiple genes at different locations.\n\nIn genomics and molecular biology, the number of \"members\" of a gene family typically refers to the count of distinct gene loci. This is the most comprehensive and accurate way to represent the genetic composition of the family. We will proceed with this definition.\n\n**Step 3: Consult the Authoritative Source (miRBase)**\nmiRBase is the primary public repository for all published miRNA sequences and annotation. To answer the question accurately, we need to list all the human (*Homo sapiens*, abbreviated 'hsa') precursor miRNAs that belong to the let-7 family.\n\n**Step 4: List the Human let-7 Family Genes**\nBy querying miRBase and reviewing established scientific literature, we can identify all the recognized human let-7 family gene loci. They are as follows:\n\n*   **let-7a**: This mature miRNA is encoded by three different genes (paralogs):\n    1.  `hsa-let-7a-1`\n    2.  `hsa-let-7a-2`\n    3.  `hsa-let-7a-3`\n*   **let-7f**: This mature miRNA is encoded by two different genes:\n    4.  `hsa-let-7f-1`\n    5.  `hsa-let-7f-2`\n*   **Other core members**: The following members are each encoded by a single gene:\n    6.  `hsa-let-7b`\n    7.  `hsa-let-7c`\n    8.  `hsa-let-7d`\n    9.  `hsa-let-7e`\n    10. `hsa-let-7g`\n    11. `hsa-let-7i`\n*   **Related member**: `miR-98` is universally considered a member of the let-7 family due to its high sequence and functional similarity. It is encoded by a single gene:\n    12. `hsa-mir-98`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number**\nTo find the total number of let-7 family members, we sum the distinct gene loci identified in the previous step:\n*   3 genes for let-7a\n*   2 genes for let-7f\n*   6 genes for let-7b, c, d, e, g, and i (1 each)\n*   1 gene for miR-98\n\nTotal = 3 + 2 + 6 + 1 = 12\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Gene vs. Mature miRNA:** It is crucial to distinguish between the 12 gene loci and the 9 distinct mature miRNA sequences they produce (let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98). The question about family \"members\" is best answered by the gene count.\n*   **Consensus:** The number 12 is well-established in the scientific community and has been stable for many years.\n*   **Excluded miRNAs:** Some miRNAs like miR-4500 were once considered potential members but have since been reclassified or withdrawn from miRBase, so they are not included in the final count.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the comprehensive list of distinct gene loci that encode for let-7 family miRNAs in the human genome, the total number of members is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
