    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gieti*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** *seh₂gieti*\n*   **Root:** *seh₂g-*\n*   **Suffix:** *-ie/o-*, a present tense verbal suffix.\n*   **Ending:** *-ti*, the 3rd person singular active indicative ending.\n*   **Meaning:** The cognates provided (Hittite *sākizzi* 'gives a sign, omen'; Latin *sāgīre* 'to perceive keenly, be keen-nosed') suggest a meaning related to tracking, perceiving, or finding a sign. This is the ultimate origin of the English word \"seek\".\n*   **Careful Point:** The laryngeal *h₂* has the effect of coloring an adjacent *e*-vowel to an *a*-vowel.\n\n**2. From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n*   **Phonological Changes:** We must apply the sound changes that occurred between PIE and Proto-Germanic.\n    *   **Grimm's Law:** This is the most significant set of changes. For our root *seh₂g-*:\n        *   The initial *s-* remains *s-*.\n        *   The voiced velar stop *g* becomes a voiceless velar stop *k*.\n        *   So, the consonantal frame *s-g* becomes *s-k*.\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The PIE root *seh₂g-* contains the vowel *e* followed by the laryngeal *h₂*. In pre-Germanic, *eh₂* becomes a long *ā*. Thus, the root becomes *sāk-*.\n    *   **The Problem of the Vowel (*ā* vs. *ō*):** A direct phonological development of *seh₂g-* leads to a PGmc root **\\*sāk-**. However, the attested forms in all the daughter languages (Old Norse, Old English, Old High German) point unambiguously to a PGmc root vowel of **\\*ō**. The reconstructed verb is **\\*sōkijaną**. The reason for this vowel shift from the expected *ā* to *ō* is debated among linguists, with theories suggesting influence from the perfect tense or other analogical changes. For the purpose of tracing the known word, we must proceed with the established PGmc reconstruction.\n    *   **Verb Class:** The PIE *-ie/o-* suffix corresponds to the Proto-Germanic Class 1 weak verbs, which are formed with the suffix *-ja-*.\n*   **Proto-Germanic Reconstruction:** Combining the root **\\*sōk-** with the Class 1 weak verb suffix gives the infinitive **\\*sōkijaną**.\n\n**3. From Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages**\n\nNow we trace the PGmc form **\\*sōkijaną** into Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n**A. Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc **\\*sōkijaną**\n*   **I-Umlaut:** The *j* in the suffix *-ija-* causes the preceding root vowel *ō* to be fronted. In Old Norse, the i-umlaut of *ō* is **œ**.\n*   **Consonants:** The cluster *kj* is retained in Old Norse.\n*   **Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending *-aną* becomes **-a** in Old Norse.\n*   **Result:** Combining these changes: *s-* + **œ** + *kj* + *-a* gives **sœkja**.\n\n**B. Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc **\\*sōkijaną**\n*   **West Germanic Gemination:** In West Germanic (the parent of OE and OHG), a single consonant followed by *j* was doubled (geminated). Thus, *k* becomes *kk*. The form becomes *\\*sōkkijaną*.\n*   **Palatalization:** The geminated velar stop *kk* was then palatalized by the following *j* to become the affricate /tʃtʃ/, written as **ċċ**. The *j* was then absorbed.\n*   **I-Umlaut:** The *j* (before it was absorbed) also caused i-umlaut of the root vowel. In Old English, the i-umlaut of *ō* is **ē**.\n*   **Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending *-aną* becomes **-an** in Old English.\n*   **Result:** Combining these changes: *s-* + **ē** + *ċċ* + *-an* gives *sēċċan*, which is commonly normalized in dictionaries and texts as **sēcan**.\n\n**C. Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc **\\*sōkijaną**\n*   **Loss of Medial *j*:** In Old High German, for Class 1 weak verbs with a long root syllable (like **\\*sōk-**), the medial *-j-* was lost early, *before* it could cause i-umlaut. This is a crucial difference from Old English and Old Norse.\n*   **Vowel Change:** Since there is no i-umlaut, the PGmc vowel *ō* undergoes its normal development into OHG, which is the diphthong **uo**.\n*   **High German Consonant Shift:** The PGmc voiceless stop *k* in a post-vocalic position shifts to a voiceless fricative /xx/, written as **hh**.\n*   **Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending *-aną* becomes **-an** in Old High German.\n*   **Result:** Combining these changes: *s-* + **uo** + *hh* + *-an* gives **suohhan**. This is often normalized as **suochen**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *\\*sōkijaną*\n*   **Old Norse:** *sœkja*\n*   **Old English:** *sēcan*\n*   **Old High German:** *suohhan* (or *suochen*)\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *\\*sōkijaną*; Old Norse: *sœkja*; Old English: *sēcan*; Old High German: *suohhan*>>>"
