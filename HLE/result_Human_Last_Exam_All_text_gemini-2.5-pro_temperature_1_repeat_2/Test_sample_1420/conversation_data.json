    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Critical Exponents:** These exponents describe the singular behavior of various physical quantities near a continuous phase transition. The specific heat, $C_V$, is expected to behave as $C_V \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\alpha}$, where $T_c$ is the critical temperature and $\\alpha$ is the specific heat exponent.\n*   **Renormalization Group (RG) Theory:** This is a theoretical framework for understanding critical phenomena. It involves analyzing how a system's properties change under a change of length scale.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** For a given model of a phase transition, this is the spatial dimension above which the critical exponents take on their simple \"mean-field\" values. For the class of models we are considering (O(n) models, which include the Ising model), the upper critical dimension is $d_c=4$.\n*   **Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion:** This is a key calculational technique within RG theory. It treats the deviation from the upper critical dimension, $\\epsilon = d_c - d$, as a small parameter and calculates critical exponents as a power series in $\\epsilon$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Problem using the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\n\n*   We are interested in a system with spatial dimension $d=3$.\n*   The relevant upper critical dimension is $d_c=4$.\n*   Therefore, the expansion parameter is $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n*   Our goal is to find the expression for the exponent $\\alpha$ as a series in $\\epsilon$ and then evaluate it for $\\epsilon=1$.\n\n**3. Use Hyperscaling Relations**\n\nCritical exponents are not all independent. They are connected by so-called \"hyperscaling relations\". The relation relevant for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ is Josephson's relation:\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the critical exponent for the correlation length, $\\xi \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\nu}$, and $d$ is the spatial dimension. This relation is a direct consequence of RG theory and is valid for $d < d_c$.\n\n**4. Find the Expression for $\\nu$ from the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\n\nThe $\\epsilon$-expansion is first used to calculate the fundamental exponents, such as $\\nu$ and $\\eta$ (the anomalous dimension). For the general O(n) model (where n is the number of components of the order parameter, e.g., n=1 for the Ising model), the result for $\\nu$ to the first order in $\\epsilon$ is:\n\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**5. Calculate $\\alpha$ to First Order in $\\epsilon$**\n\nNow we substitute the expression for $\\nu$ and $d=4-\\epsilon$ into the hyperscaling relation:\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right)$\n\nWe expand this expression and keep only the terms up to the first power of $\\epsilon$:\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ (4)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (4)\\left(\\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon\\right) - (\\epsilon)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nTo simplify the term in the parenthesis:\n\n$\\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2(n+2) - 1(n+8)}{2(n+8)} = \\frac{2n+4-n-8}{2(n+8)} = \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**6. Evaluate for the Specific Case ($d=3$ and Ising Model)**\n\n*   The problem does not specify the symmetry of the system. The most common and fundamental case studied is the **Ising model**, which corresponds to a scalar order parameter, so we set **n=1**.\n*   For the Ising model (n=1), the expression for $\\alpha$ becomes:\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) = \\frac{3}{18}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n*   For the spatial dimension $d=3$, we have **$\\epsilon = 1$**.\n*   Substituting $\\epsilon=1$ into our first-order result gives the estimate for the exponent:\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Approximation:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative series. Setting $\\epsilon=1$ is a significant extrapolation, as the expansion is formally derived for small $\\epsilon$. Therefore, the result from the first-order term is an approximation. Higher-order terms would be needed for greater accuracy.\n2.  **Model Dependence:** The final numerical value depends on 'n', the number of components of the order parameter. We have used n=1 (Ising model), which is the standard assumption if not otherwise specified.\n3.  **Validity of Hyperscaling:** The relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$ is central to this derivation and is a cornerstone of RG theory below the upper critical dimension.\n4.  **Universality:** The result depends only on the dimension $d$ and the symmetry of the order parameter (via 'n'), not on the microscopic details of the Hamiltonian. This is the principle of universality.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe exponent $\\alpha$ is found using the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$. Using the $\\epsilon$-expansion with $\\epsilon = 4-d$, the correlation length exponent for the O(n) model is $\\nu \\approx \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon$. Substituting these into the hyperscaling relation gives $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$. For the Ising model (n=1) at dimension $d=3$ ($\\epsilon=1$), this yields $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}(1) = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
