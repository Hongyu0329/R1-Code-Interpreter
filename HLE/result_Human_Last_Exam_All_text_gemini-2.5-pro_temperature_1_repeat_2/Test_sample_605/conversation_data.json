    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Input and Definitions\n\n*   **Hypersurface Equation:** We are given a polynomial $f$ in 5 variables:\n    $f = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3 = 0$.\n*   **Ambient Space:** The polynomial defines a hypersurface in a weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$.\n*   **Weights:** The weights are given as $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n*   **Crawley-Nordström Invariant:** For an isolated hypersurface singularity defined by a polynomial $f$, the Crawley-Nordström invariant is given by `cn(f) = μ(f) - τ(f)`, where `μ(f)` is the Milnor number and `τ(f)` is the Tjurina number of the singularity.\n\n### Step 2: Check if the Polynomial is Quasi-Homogeneous\n\nA polynomial is quasi-homogeneous of weighted degree $d$ if every monomial term has that same weighted degree. Let's calculate the weighted degree of each monomial in $f$.\n*   $deg(z_1^8z_3) = 8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8(22) + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n*   $deg(z_1^4z_2^3z_3) = 4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4(22) + 3(29) + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n*   $deg(z_1z_2^7) = 1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 22 + 7(29) = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n*   $deg(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5) = w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5 = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$.\n*   $deg(z_2z_3^4) = 1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 29 + 4(49) = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n*   $deg(z_4^3z_5) = 3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3(50) + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n*   $deg(z_5^3) = 3 \\cdot w_5 = 3(75) = 225$.\n\nThe polynomial is **not** quasi-homogeneous because one term has degree 224 while the others have degree 225.\n\n### Step 3: Decompose the Polynomial and Apply Relevant Theory\n\nWe can decompose the polynomial $f$ into a quasi-homogeneous part, $f_0$, and a lower-degree perturbation, $g$.\n*   The sum of the weights is $d = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$. The term \"Calabi-Yau Link\" implies the principal part of the polynomial should have this degree.\n*   The principal quasi-homogeneous part, $f_0$, consists of all terms of degree 225:\n    $f_0 = z_1^8z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$.\n*   The perturbation term, $g$, is the term of degree 224:\n    $g = z_1^4z_2^3z_3$.\n*   So, we have $f = f_0 + g$.\n\nFor such a deformation of a quasi-homogeneous polynomial by a lower-degree term, the following theoretical results hold:\n1.  The Milnor number is invariant under this type of deformation: `μ(f) = μ(f_0)`.\n2.  For a quasi-homogeneous polynomial with an isolated singularity (which is standard for Calabi-Yau links), the Milnor and Tjurina numbers are equal: `μ(f_0) = τ(f_0)`.\n3.  Combining these, the Crawley-Nordström invariant for $f$ becomes `cn(f) = μ(f) - τ(f) = μ(f_0) - τ(f) = τ(f_0) - τ(f)`.\n4.  This difference in Tjurina numbers, `τ(f_0) - τ(f)`, counts the number of \"essential\" lower-degree deformation terms. An essential term is one that is not in the Jacobian ideal of the principal part, $J(f_0)$.\n5.  In our case, we have only one perturbation term, $g$. Therefore, the invariant `cn(f)` will be 1 if $g \\notin J(f_0)$, and 0 if $g \\in J(f_0)$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if $g$ is in the Jacobian Ideal $J(f_0)$\n\nThe problem now is to solve the ideal membership problem: Is $g \\in J(f_0)$?\n*   The Jacobian ideal is generated by the partial derivatives of $f_0$:\n    $J(f_0) = (\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial z_1}, \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial z_2}, \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial z_3}, \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial z_4}, \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial z_5})$.\n*   Instead of a full computation, we can use a simplification. If $g \\in J(f_0)$, then its image must be zero in any quotient of the polynomial ring by a larger ideal. Let's consider the quotient where we set $z_4=0$ and $z_5=0$.\n*   If $g \\in J(f_0)$, then $g = \\sum_{i=1}^5 H_i \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial z_i}$ for some polynomials $H_i$.\n*   Setting $z_4=0, z_5=0$:\n    *   The term $g = z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ remains unchanged.\n    *   The specialized ideal $J(f_0)|_{z_4=z_5=0}$ is generated by:\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial z_1}|_{z_4,z_5=0} = 8z_1^7z_3 + z_2^7$\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial z_2}|_{z_4,z_5=0} = 7z_1z_2^6 + z_3^4$\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial z_3}|_{z_4,z_5=0} = z_1^8 + 4z_2z_3^3$\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial z_4}|_{z_4,z_5=0} = 0$\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial z_5}|_{z_4,z_5=0} = 0$\n*   The specialized problem is: Is $g = z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ in the ideal $I' = (8z_1^7z_3 + z_2^7, 7z_1z_2^6 + z_3^4, z_1^8 + 4z_2z_3^3)$ in the ring $\\mathbb{C}[z_1, z_2, z_3]$ with weights $(22, 29, 49)$?\n*   Let the generators of $I'$ be $G_1, G_2, G_3$. If $g \\in I'$, then $g = h_1 G_1 + h_2 G_2 + h_3 G_3$ for some polynomials $h_1, h_2, h_3$. Since the ideal is graded, we can assume the $h_i$ are quasi-homogeneous.\n*   Let's check the degrees:\n    *   $deg(g) = 224$.\n    *   $deg(G_1) = deg(8z_1^7z_3 + z_2^7) = 225 - w_1 = 203$.\n    *   $deg(G_2) = deg(7z_1z_2^6 + z_3^4) = 225 - w_2 = 196$.\n    *   $deg(G_3) = deg(z_1^8 + 4z_2z_3^3) = 225 - w_3 = 176$.\n*   For the degrees to match in $g = \\sum h_i G_i$, we must have:\n    *   $deg(h_1) = deg(g) - deg(G_1) = 224 - 203 = 21$.\n    *   $deg(h_2) = deg(g) - deg(G_2) = 224 - 196 = 28$.\n    *   $deg(h_3) = deg(g) - deg(G_3) = 224 - 176 = 48$.\n*   Now we must check if there exist any non-zero monomials (or polynomials) with these required weighted degrees in variables $z_1, z_2, z_3$ with weights $(22, 29, 49)$.\n    *   Degree 21: A monomial $z_1^a z_2^b z_3^c$ would have degree $22a + 29b + 49c$. For this to be 21, $a,b,c$ must all be zero. No such monomial exists. So, $h_1=0$.\n    *   Degree 28: For $22a + 29b + 49c = 28$, again $a,b,c$ must be zero. No such monomial exists. So, $h_2=0$.\n    *   Degree 48: For $22a + 29b + 49c = 48$, we can have $a=1 \\implies 22+29b+49c=48 \\implies 29b+49c=26$, which requires $b=c=0$. Or $a=2 \\implies 44+29b+49c=48 \\implies 29b+49c=4$, requires $b=c=0$. No combination of non-negative integers $a,b,c$ works. No such monomial exists. So, $h_3=0$.\n*   Since $h_1=h_2=h_3=0$, the only way for the equation to hold is if $g=0$, which is false.\n*   Therefore, $g$ is not in the specialized ideal $I'$, which implies that $g$ cannot be in the original Jacobian ideal $J(f_0)$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nSince the perturbation term $g$ is not in the Jacobian ideal of the principal part $f_0$, it represents an essential deformation. According to the theory, this means the Crawley-Nordström invariant is 1."
