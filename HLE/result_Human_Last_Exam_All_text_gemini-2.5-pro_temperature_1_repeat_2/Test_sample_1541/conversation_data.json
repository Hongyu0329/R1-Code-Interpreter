    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory usage of its variables.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary task is to read a string representing a sum of numbers (only 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s), and then print the same sum with the numbers sorted in non-decreasing order.\n2.  **Input Format:** The input is a single string like \"3+2+1+4+2\". It contains only digits '1', '2', '3', '4' and the '+' symbol. The string length is at most 1000 characters.\n3.  **Output Format:** The output should be the rearranged sum, like \"1+2+2+3+4\".\n4.  **Core Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". This means we should minimize the total memory allocated for variables on the stack or heap.\n5.  **Final Task:** Calculate `m`, the total memory in bytes used for the variables in this optimal program.\n\n### Careful Points and Strategy\n\n1.  **Avoiding Large Buffers:** A naive approach would be to read the entire string into a character array. Since the maximum length is 1000, this would require `char s[1001];`, consuming 1001 bytes just for the input buffer. This is not memory-efficient.\n    *   **Optimal Strategy:** Process the input character by character using a function like `getchar()`. This avoids storing the entire string in memory at once.\n\n2.  **Storing the Numbers:** After parsing, we need to store the numbers to sort them. Storing them in an integer array is also inefficient. The maximum number of summands is `(1000 + 1) / 2 = 501`. An array `int numbers[501];` would take `501 * 4 = 2004` bytes.\n    *   **Optimal Strategy:** Since the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, and 4, we don't need to store each number. We only need to count the *occurrences* of each number. This is the core idea of the Counting Sort algorithm. We can use a small, fixed-size array of 4 elements to store the counts of '1's, '2's, '3's, and '4's.\n\n3.  **Choosing Data Types:** To be maximally memory-efficient, we must choose the smallest possible C data type for each variable that can safely hold its range of values.\n    *   The maximum count for any single number is 501 (e.g., in a string of 501 '1's). An `unsigned char` (range 0-255) is too small. An `unsigned short` (range 0-65535, typically 2 bytes) is sufficient.\n    *   The variable for `getchar()` must be an `int` because the function can return `EOF` (End-Of-File), which is a negative value that doesn't fit in a `char`.\n    *   Loop counters and flags should also use the smallest appropriate types.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Memory Calculation\n\nLet's design the most memory-efficient C program mentally and list all the variables it needs.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize an array `counts` of size 4 to all zeros. This will store the frequencies of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n2.  Loop, reading one character at a time using `getchar()`, until a newline or `EOF` is found.\n3.  Inside the loop, if the character is a digit '1' through '4', increment the corresponding element in the `counts` array. Ignore '+' characters.\n4.  After the loop, construct the output string. Use a flag to handle printing the '+' separator correctly (i.e., not before the first number).\n5.  Iterate from `i = 0` to `3`. For each `i`, loop `counts[i]` times to print the digit `'1' + i`. After printing a digit, if it's not the last number overall, print a '+'.\n\n**Variable Analysis and Sizing:**\n\n1.  **`counts` array:** Stores the frequency of each number.\n    *   Purpose: Count occurrences of '1', '2', '3', '4'.\n    *   Max Value: 501.\n    *   Smallest Type: `unsigned short` (2 bytes).\n    *   Declaration: `unsigned short counts[4];`\n    *   Memory: `4 * sizeof(unsigned short) = 4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n\n2.  **Input character variable:** Holds the return value of `getchar()`.\n    *   Purpose: Read one character from input.\n    *   Max Value: Needs to hold any character and `EOF`.\n    *   Smallest Type: `int`.\n    *   Declaration: `int ch;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\n3.  **Printing flag:** A boolean flag to manage when to print '+'.\n    *   Purpose: Track if the number being printed is the first term.\n    *   Max Value: 0 or 1.\n    *   Smallest Type: `char`.\n    *   Declaration: `char first_term;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n4.  **Outer loop counter:** Iterates through the `counts` array (from 0 to 3).\n    *   Purpose: Loop index for numbers 1 through 4.\n    *   Max Value: 3.\n    *   Smallest Type: `unsigned char`.\n    *   Declaration: `unsigned char i;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(unsigned char) = 1` byte.\n\n5.  **Inner loop counter:** Iterates to print each number multiple times.\n    *   Purpose: Loop index for printing a number `counts[i]` times.\n    *   Max Value: 501 (the max value in `counts`).\n    *   Smallest Type: `unsigned short`.\n    *   Declaration: `unsigned short j;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(unsigned short) = 2` bytes.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation (m):**\nSumming the memory usage of all declared variables:\nm = (memory for `counts`) + (memory for `ch`) + (memory for `first_term`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `j`)\nm = 8 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2\nm = 16 bytes\n\nThis represents the total memory allocated on the stack for the variables required to solve the problem in the most memory-efficient manner.\n\n<<<16>>>"
