The post-reset covariance Σ' is computed from the pre-reset covariance Σ and the mean deviation δ used for the reset by the expression: Σ' = J * Σ * J^T, where J is the Jacobian of the reset transformation. For the specified left-multiplication reset, the exact Jacobian is J = exp(\hat{δ}) * J_l(δ) * exp(-\hat{δ}), where exp(\hat{δ}) is the rotation matrix corresponding to the vector δ and J_l(δ) is the left Jacobian of the SO(3) group. The full expression is: Σ' = (exp(\hat{δ}) * J_l(δ) * exp(-\hat{δ})) * Σ * (exp(\hat{δ}) * J_l(δ) * exp(-\hat{δ}))^T.
