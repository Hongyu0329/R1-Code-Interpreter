    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"Second Great War\"**\nThe conflict referred to as the Second Great War in StarCraft lore is the primary narrative arc of the *StarCraft II* trilogy. This war involves the renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, the rise of the hybrid, and the ultimate battle against the dark god Amon and his forces. It encompasses the events of the three main campaigns: *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*, including its epilogue.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Point of the War**\nThe war officially begins with the start of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign. This is marked by the Zerg Swarm, once again led by the Queen of Blades, launching a full-scale invasion of Terran Dominion space. According to the official StarCraft timeline, this event occurs in the year **2504**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Ending Point of the War**\nThe war concludes with the final and permanent defeat of Amon. This happens during the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue campaign, \"Into the Void.\" In this final chapter, the united forces of the Terran, Zerg, and Protoss launch an assault on Amon within the Void itself, ultimately destroying him. The timeline places this climactic event in the year **2506**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Duration**\nThe war starts in 2504 and ends in 2506. This means the conflict spans across three calendar years:\n*   **2504:** *Wings of Liberty* campaign and the beginning of the *Heart of the Swarm* campaign.\n*   **2505:** Conclusion of *Heart of the Swarm* and a period where the factions regroup. Kerrigan consolidates her control over the Zerg Swarm, and Artanis prepares the Golden Armada.\n*   **2506:** The *Legacy of the Void* campaign, including the reclamation of Aiur and the final battle against Amon in the epilogue.\n\nWhile the exact start and end months are not specified, the events within the campaigns themselves take a considerable amount of time. The period between the campaigns also represents elapsed time. Therefore, the total duration is not a simple subtraction (2506 - 2504 = 2). The war began sometime *in* 2504 and ended sometime *in* 2506. This means the duration is certainly more than one year and very likely more than two full years. For example, if the war started in March 2504 and ended in July 2506, the duration would be 2 years and 4 months.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the \"Rounded Up\" Rule**\nThe question requires the answer to be in years and \"rounded up\".\n*   We've established the duration is greater than 2 years.\n*   Let's assume a conservative duration, for example, 2 years and 1 day.\n*   When we round a number greater than 2 up to the nearest whole year, the result is 3.\n\nTherefore, by calculating the time elapsed from the start year (2504) to the end year (2506) and applying the \"rounded up\" instruction, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **War Name:** It is important to distinguish the \"Second Great War\" (StarCraft II) from the \"Great War\" (original StarCraft) and the \"Brood War\" (StarCraft: Brood War).\n2.  **Timeline Specificity:** StarCraft lore provides years for major events but rarely gives exact dates. The calculation must rely on the established years of 2504 and 2506.\n3.  **The \"Rounded Up\" Instruction:** This is the most critical part of the question. A simple calculation of `2506 - 2504 = 2` would be incorrect because it ignores both the time elapsed within the years and the specific rounding instruction. The war spans across three calendar years, and its actual duration is over two years, which necessitates rounding up to three.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   Start Year: 2504\n*   End Year: 2506\n*   Elapsed Time: Spans across 3 calendar years (2504, 2505, 2506), making the duration greater than 2 years.\n*   Rounding: A duration of (2.x) years, when rounded up, becomes 3 years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
