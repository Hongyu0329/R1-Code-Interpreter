No, this approach is not valid for determining functional mimicry syndromes. The ecological function of mimicry is defined by the perception and learning of natural predators (like birds), not humans. There are several critical flaws in using human assessment as a proxy:

1.  **Different Visual Systems:** The primary predators of bees, birds, have tetrachromatic vision and can see ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Two bee species that look identical to the human eye may have different UV patterns and thus be easily distinguishable to a bird. The use of standard photographs further exacerbates this issue as they do not capture UV information.
2.  **Static vs. Dynamic Signals:** Predators observe bees in motion. Static images fail to capture dynamic cues such as flight patterns, posture, and behavior, which can be integral parts of the overall warning signal.
3.  **Lack of Ecological Context:** The undergraduate's task is a simple visual matching exercise. In contrast, a predator's perception is shaped by a powerful learning experience: associating a visual pattern with a painful sting. The features that a predator learns to recognize as a warning may be different from the features a human uses to judge general similarity.

Because the method fails to account for the sensory capabilities of the relevant predator, the full range of visual signals, and the learning mechanism that gives mimicry its function, the resulting clusters would represent human-perceived similarity, not ecologically functional mimicry syndromes.
