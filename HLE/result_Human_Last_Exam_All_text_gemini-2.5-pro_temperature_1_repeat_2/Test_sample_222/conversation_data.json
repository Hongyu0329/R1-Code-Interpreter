    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nWe need to find the DFT of a new 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\n### Step 2: Address the Question's Ambiguity\nThe question asks for the \"4-point DFT\" of the 8-point sequence `y(n)`. This is a crucial point. Finding an N-point DFT of an M-point sequence where N < M is typically interpreted in signal processing as performing time-domain aliasing on the sequence before taking the DFT.\n\n1.  **Form the 8-point sequence `y(n)`:**\n    `y(n) = {y(0), y(1), y(2), y(3), y(4), y(5), y(6), y(7)}`\n    `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n2.  **Perform Time-Aliasing:** To get a 4-point sequence, we \"wrap\" the 8-point sequence around a length of 4 and sum the values. Let the aliased sequence be `y_a(n)`.\n    `y_a(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n3.  **Relate DFTs (Decimation-in-Frequency):** A key property of the DFT states that the DFT of this aliased sequence `y_a(n)` is equivalent to taking the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`.\n    Let `Y_8(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`.\n    Let `Y_4(k)` be the 4-point DFT of `y_a(n)`.\n    Then, `Y_4(k) = Y_8(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nOur goal is now to find `Y_8(0)`, `Y_8(2)`, `Y_8(4)`, and `Y_8(6)`.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Formula for the 8-point DFT, `Y_8(k)`\nThe 8-point DFT of `y(n)` is defined as:\n`Y_8(k) = Σ_{n=0 to 7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)`, where `W_N = e^(-j*2π/N)`.\n\nWe can split this sum into even and odd indices of `n`. Let `n=2m` for even indices and `n=2m+1` for odd indices.\n`Y_8(k) = Σ_{m=0 to 3} y(2m) * W_8^(2mk) + Σ_{m=0 to 3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nSubstitute `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)`:\n`Y_8(k) = Σ_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + Σ_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * W_8^k * W_8^(2mk)`\n\nUsing the twiddle factor property `W_N^(ab) = W_(N/a)^b`, we have `W_8^2 = W_4`.\n`Y_8(k) = Σ_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) + W_8^k * Σ_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * W_4^(mk)`\n\nThe sums are the 4-point DFTs of `x(m)` and `h(m)`. However, since `k` in `Y_8(k)` goes up to 7, we must consider the 4-point periodicity of `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\nThe final formula is:\n`Y_8(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required Values of `Y_8(k)`\nWe need to calculate `Y_8(0)`, `Y_8(2)`, `Y_8(4)`, and `Y_8(6)`.\n\nWe need the given DFT values:\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nAnd the necessary twiddle factors:\n*   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*2π*2/8) = e^(-jπ/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^4 = e^(-j*2π*4/8) = e^(-jπ) = -1`\n*   `W_8^6 = e^(-j*2π*6/8) = e^(-j3π/2) = j`\n\nNow, we perform the calculations:\n\n*   **For k=0:** `Y_4(0) = Y_8(0)`\n    `Y_8(0) = X(0 mod 4) + W_8^0 * H(0 mod 4)`\n    `Y_8(0) = X(0) + (1) * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k=1:** `Y_4(1) = Y_8(2)`\n    `Y_8(2) = X(2 mod 4) + W_8^2 * H(2 mod 4)`\n    `Y_8(2) = X(2) + (-j) * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n*   **For k=2:** `Y_4(2) = Y_8(4)`\n    `Y_8(4) = X(4 mod 4) + W_8^4 * H(4 mod 4)`\n    `Y_8(4) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0) = 1 + (-1) * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k=3:** `Y_4(3) = Y_8(6)`\n    `Y_8(6) = X(6 mod 4) + W_8^6 * H(6 mod 4)`\n    `Y_8(6) = X(2) + (j) * H(2) = -1 + (j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nThe resulting 4-point DFT, `Y_4(k)`, is the collection of these calculated values for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n`Y_4(k) = {Y_8(0), Y_8(2), Y_8(4), Y_8(6)}`\n`Y_4(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
