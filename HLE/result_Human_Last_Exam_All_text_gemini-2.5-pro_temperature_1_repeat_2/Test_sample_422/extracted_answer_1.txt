The two problems for the JTB theory under the specified constraints are:

1.  **The Problem of the Belief Condition:** The JTB definition asserts that knowledge is a type of belief (if you know P, you must believe P). However, the constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the only two available epistemic states implies they are mutually exclusive (if you are in the state of knowing P, you are not in the state of believing P). This creates a direct logical contradiction, making the JTB definition internally incoherent under the constraint.

2.  **The Problem of Conflating Justified and Unjustified Beliefs:** The JTB framework acknowledges the existence of "Justified False Beliefs" (beliefs that are rational and well-supported but happen to be untrue). Since these are not knowledge (because they are false), the constraint forces them into the single category of "Belief." This category must also contain unjustified beliefs (i.e., mere guesses or opinions). By lumping rationally supported beliefs and irrational beliefs together, the framework loses the crucial epistemic distinction between being rational-but-wrong and simply being irrational, thus undermining the significance of the justification condition for any state that isn't knowledge.
