    "An elegant step-by-step derivation of the final answer is provided.\n\n**1. Analyze the Lie Algebra Structure**\n\nThe 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3, [e_1, e_3] = e_4, [e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\nAll other brackets of basis vectors are zero.\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent. We can see this by computing the lower central series:\n$\\mathfrak{g}^2 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$\n$\\mathfrak{g}^3 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^2] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1, e_3]\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}$\n$\\mathfrak{g}^4 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^3] = \\{0\\}$\n\nWe can decompose $\\mathfrak{g}$ into a structure that is more amenable to calculation. Let's define two subalgebras:\n1.  Let $\\mathfrak{g}_A = \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$. The commutation relations within this set are $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$ and $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$. This is the 4-dimensional filiform nilpotent Lie algebra, which we denote by $\\mathfrak{f}_4$.\n2.  Let $\\mathfrak{g}_B = \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_5, e_6\\}$. The commutation relation is $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. This is the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra, denoted by $\\mathfrak{h}_3$.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the amalgamated sum (or pushout) of $\\mathfrak{g}_A$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_B$ along their common subalgebra $\\mathbb{R}e_1$. We write this as $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{g}_A \\oplus_{\\mathbb{R}e_1} \\mathfrak{g}_B$.\n\n**2. The Poincaré Polynomial and the Chevalley-Eilenberg Complex**\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers. These are the dimensions of the homology (or cohomology) groups of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex.\n\nFor an amalgamated sum of Lie algebras like this, there is a powerful result that relates the cohomology of the combined algebra to the cohomologies of its components. The Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the tensor product of the complexes of $\\mathfrak{g}_A$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_B$ over the complex of their common subalgebra.\n$(\\Lambda \\mathfrak{g}^*, d) \\cong (\\Lambda \\mathfrak{g}_A^*, d_A) \\otimes_{\\Lambda(\\mathbb{R}e_1)^*} (\\Lambda \\mathfrak{g}_B^*, d_B)$.\n\nThis structure leads to a spectral sequence (the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for Lie algebra cohomology) whose $E_2$ page is given by $\\text{Tor}_{H^\\bullet(\\mathbb{R}e_1)}(H^\\bullet(\\mathfrak{g}_A), H^\\bullet(\\mathfrak{g}_B))$. For many \"formal\" Lie algebras, including nilpotent ones of this type, this spectral sequence collapses at the $E_2$ page. This implies that the Poincaré series of the Tor groups is the Poincaré polynomial of the total algebra. For a simple tensor product over a polynomial ring, the Hilbert series (our Poincaré polynomial) satisfies:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{P_{\\mathfrak{g}_A}(x) P_{\\mathfrak{g}_B}(x)}{P_{\\mathbb{R}e_1}(x)}$.\n\n**3. Compute Poincaré Polynomials of the Components**\n\n*   **For $\\mathbb{R}e_1$:** This is a 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra. Its Chevalley-Eilenberg complex is $(\\Lambda(e^1), d=0)$. The cohomology is just the algebra itself.\n    $P_{\\mathbb{R}e_1}(x) = 1+x$.\n\n*   **For $\\mathfrak{g}_A = \\mathfrak{f}_4$:** The dual complex has differentials $de^1=0, de^2=0, de^3=-e^1\\wedge e^2, de^4=-e^1\\wedge e^3$.\n    $b_0 = 1$.\n    $H^1$: Cocycles are $e^1, e^2$. $b_1=2$.\n    $H^2$: $\\ker d_2 / \\text{im} d_1$. $\\text{im} d_1 = \\text{span}\\{e^1\\wedge e^2, e^1\\wedge e^3\\}$. One can compute $\\dim\\ker d_2 = 4$, so $b_2 = 4-2=2$.\n    $H^3$: One can compute $b_3=2$.\n    $H^4$: One can compute $b_4=1$.\n    So, $P_{\\mathfrak{f}_4}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4$. This is a known result for $\\mathfrak{f}_4$.\n\n*   **For $\\mathfrak{g}_B = \\mathfrak{h}_3$:** The dual complex has differentials $de^1=0, de^5=0, de^6=-e^1\\wedge e^5$.\n    $b_0=1$.\n    $H^1$: Cocycles are $e^1, e^5$. $b_1=2$.\n    $H^2$: $\\dim\\ker d_2=3$, $\\dim\\text{im}d_1=1$. $b_2=3-1=2$.\n    $H^3$: $b_3=1$.\n    So, $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3$.\n    We can factor this as $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = (1+x)(1+x+x^2)$.\n\n**4. Compute the Final Poincaré Polynomial**\n\nNow, we substitute these polynomials into the formula:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3)}{1+x}$\n\nUsing the factorization $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = (1+x)(1+x+x^2)$, we can simplify the expression:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)(1+x)(1+x+x^2)}{1+x}$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)(1+x+x^2)$\n\nNow, we perform the polynomial multiplication:\n$= (1 \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)) + (x \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)) + (x^2 \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4))$\n$= (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) + (x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5) + (x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6)$\n\nCombine terms by degree:\n$x^0: 1$\n$x^1: 2x + x = 3x$\n$x^2: 2x^2 + 2x^2 + x^2 = 5x^2$\n$x^3: 2x^3 + 2x^3 + 2x^3 = 6x^3$\n$x^4: x^4 + 2x^4 + 2x^4 = 5x^4$\n$x^5: x^5 + 2x^5 = 3x^5$\n$x^6: x^6$\n\nSo the final Poincaré polynomial is:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nFinal check of the Betti numbers: $b_0=1, b_1=3, b_2=5, b_3=6, b_4=5, b_5=3, b_6=1$. The Lie algebra is unimodular, so Poincaré duality $b_k = b_{6-k}$ must hold, and it does for this result."
