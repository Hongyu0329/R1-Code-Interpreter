    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** An infamous commercial.\n    *   **Company:** Enron.\n    *   **Year:** 2000.\n    *   **Tagline:** \"Ask Why\".\n    *   **Key Participants:** Two Nobel laureates.\n\n2.  **Identify the Advertising Campaign:** The question points to a specific, high-profile ad campaign run by Enron in 2000. The tagline \"Ask Why\" was the central theme. The campaign's goal was to rebrand Enron from a simple energy-trading company to an innovative, idea-driven powerhouse. The commercials were known for their intellectual tone, often featuring academics and thinkers.\n\n3.  **Search for the Participants:** We need to identify the specific individuals featured in these commercials who are also Nobel laureates. Researching the \"Enron 'Ask Why' commercial\" reveals the names of several participants. Among them, two prominent economists are consistently mentioned.\n\n4.  **Identify the Two Individuals:** The two economists featured in one of the most noted commercials of this campaign were **Merton Miller** and **Paul Krugman**.\n\n5.  **Verify their Nobel Laureate Status (A Careful Point):**\n    *   **Merton Miller:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1990**, along with Harry Markowitz and William F. Sharpe, for their pioneering work in the theory of financial economics. Therefore, at the time of the commercial in 2000, he was already a Nobel laureate.\n    *   **Paul Krugman:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008** for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity. This means that at the time the commercial aired in 2000, he was a prominent and respected economist but was *not yet* a Nobel laureate. However, the question asks for \"two Nobel laureates,\" and since he did eventually win the prize, he fits the description.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The two individuals who fit the criteria of being featured in the 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial and being Nobel laureates are Merton Miller and Paul Krugman. The commercial became infamous following Enron's collapse in 2001, making the \"Ask Why\" tagline deeply ironic in retrospect.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
