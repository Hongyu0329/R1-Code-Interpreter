    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n**Question:** \"What achiral and non polar crystal classes have the correct symmetry for optical activity?\"\n\nTo answer this, we must first define the key terms from crystallography and optics and then check which crystal classes, if any, satisfy all conditions.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Optical Activity:** This is a physical phenomenon where the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light rotates as it propagates through a material. For a material to exhibit natural optical activity, it must be **chiral**.\n\n2.  **Chirality:** An object or crystal structure is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Symmetry Requirement for Chirality:** A crystal class is chiral if and only if its point group symmetry does not contain any rotoinversion axes (`bar{1}`, `bar{2}`, `bar{3}`, `bar{4}`, `bar{6}`). The most common symmetry elements that destroy chirality are an **inversion center** (`i`, which is `bar{1}`) and a **mirror plane** (`m`, which is `bar{2}`).\n    *   There are 11 chiral crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432.\n\n3.  **Achiral Crystal Class:** A crystal class that is not chiral. Its point group contains at least one rotoinversion axis. An achiral crystal is superimposable on its mirror image. There are 21 achiral crystal classes.\n\n4.  **Polar Crystal Class:** A crystal class is polar if it possesses a unique direction (a polar axis) such that the two ends of the axis are not equivalent by any symmetry operation of the crystal. All pyroelectric crystals are polar. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\n5.  **Non-polar Crystal Class:** A crystal class that is not polar. Such classes have symmetry elements (like an inversion center, or a rotation axis with a perpendicular 2-fold axis or mirror plane) that make opposite directions equivalent. There are 22 non-polar crystal classes.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Conditions of the Question\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  The class must be **achiral**.\n2.  The class must be **non-polar**.\n3.  The class must \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\".\n\n### Step 3: Interpret and Synthesize the Conditions\n\n*   The third condition, \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity,\" is the most critical. As established in Step 1, the necessary and sufficient symmetry condition for a crystal to exhibit optical activity is that it must be **chiral**.\n*   Therefore, the question can be rephrased as: \"Which crystal classes are simultaneously **achiral**, **non-polar**, and **chiral**?\"\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Logical Contradiction\n\nThere is a fundamental and direct contradiction in the requirements:\n*   Condition 1 requires the crystal class to be **achiral**.\n*   Condition 3 requires the crystal class to be **chiral**.\n\nBy definition, a crystal class is either chiral or achiral; it cannot be both. These two categories are mutually exclusive.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nSince no crystal class can be both achiral and chiral at the same time, it is impossible for any crystal class to satisfy all the conditions laid out in the question. The set of crystal classes that meet these criteria is empty.\n\n**Careful Points Considered:**\n*   The possibility of the question referring to externally induced phenomena (like the Faraday effect) or other optical effects has been ruled out, as the phrase \"have the correct symmetry\" points to the intrinsic properties of the crystal class itself.\n*   The question is most likely a conceptual or \"trick\" question designed to test the fundamental understanding that optical activity is a unique property of chiral structures.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis logically concludes that there are no such crystal classes.\n\n<<<There are no crystal classes that satisfy these conditions."
