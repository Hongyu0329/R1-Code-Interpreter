    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters based on the prime factorization of the modulus $d$.\nFirst, we factorize the conductor $d$:\n$d = 53599$\n$d = 7 \\times 7657$\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 589$\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$\nSo, the prime factorization of $d$ is $7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 31$. Since $d$ is square-free (a product of distinct primes), any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p$ for each prime $p$ in the factorization.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the condition of being primitive\nFor a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$, a character $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\chi_{p_2} \\dots \\chi_{p_k}$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p_i}$ is non-principal. The principal character is the character of order 1.\nSo, for our character $\\chi$ to be primitive, each of the component characters $\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31}$ must not be the principal character. This means the order of each $\\chi_p$ must be greater than 1.\nLet $k_p = \\text{order}(\\chi_p)$. The condition for primitivity is $k_p > 1$ for all $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the condition on the order\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31})$\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n$\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$.\n\nThis lcm condition implies two things:\n1.  The order of each component character, $k_p$, must be a divisor of 6. So, $k_p \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n2.  Combining with the primitivity condition ($k_p > 1$), we must have $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ for each $p$.\n3.  For the lcm to be exactly 6, at least one $k_p$ must be a multiple of 2 (i.e., order 2 or 6), and at least one $k_p$ must be a multiple of 3 (i.e., order 3 or 6).\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of possible component characters\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ in this group is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's check the orders of the character groups for our primes:\n- For $p=7$, group order is $\\phi(7) = 6$.\n- For $p=13$, group order is $\\phi(13) = 12$.\n- For $p=19$, group order is $\\phi(19) = 18$.\n- For $p=31$, group order is $\\phi(31) = 30$.\n\nFor each of these primes, the divisors of the group order include 2, 3, and 6. So, characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 exist for each component. Let's count them:\n- Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n- Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n- Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nFor each prime factor $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, we have:\n- 1 choice for $\\chi_p$ to have order 2.\n- 2 choices for $\\chi_p$ to have order 3.\n- 2 choices for $\\chi_p$ to have order 6.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the counts using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion\nWe need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that each $k_p = \\text{order}(\\chi_p)$ is in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ and their lcm is 6.\n\nLet's use a counting strategy. Let $S$ be the set of all primitive characters where the order of each component divides 6. This means for each $p$, $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nFor each component $\\chi_p$, the number of choices is the sum of the numbers of characters of orders 2, 3, and 6:\nNumber of choices for each $\\chi_p = \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nSince there are 4 prime components, the total number of characters in $S$ is:\n$|S| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we must subtract from $|S|$ the cases where the lcm is not 6. Since all orders $k_p$ divide 6, the lcm must also divide 6. The lcm fails to be 6 if it is a proper divisor of 6, i.e., 1, 2, or 3.\n- The lcm cannot be 1, because all orders are greater than 1.\n- Let $A$ be the subset of $S$ where the lcm is a divisor of 2. This happens if and only if all component orders $k_p$ are divisors of 2. As $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$, this forces $k_p = 2$ for all $p$.\n    - The number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    - The total number of such characters is $|A| = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n- Let $B$ be the subset of $S$ where the lcm is a divisor of 3. This happens if and only if all component orders $k_p$ are divisors of 3. As $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$, this forces $k_p = 3$ for all $p$.\n    - The number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ is $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    - The total number of such characters is $|B| = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe characters we want to count are those in $S$ that are not in $A$ and not in $B$. The sets $A$ and $B$ are disjoint (a character cannot have all its components of order 2 and simultaneously all of order 3).\nTherefore, the number of primitive characters of order 6 is:\nNumber = $|S| - |A| - |B| = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n- Total combinations where component orders are in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$: $(\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6))^4 = (1+2+2)^4 = 5^4 = 625$.\n- Subtract combinations where all component orders are in $\\{2\\}$ (lcm divides 2): $(\\phi(2))^4 = 1^4 = 1$.\n- Subtract combinations where all component orders are in $\\{3\\}$ (lcm divides 3): $(\\phi(3))^4 = 2^4 = 16$.\n- Final count: $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
