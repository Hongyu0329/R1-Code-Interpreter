    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Multi-valued Nature of Complex Exponentiation**\n\nThe term $i^z$ is a multi-valued function in the complex plane. We define it as $i^z = e^{z \\log(i)}$.\nThe complex logarithm, $\\log(i)$, is also multi-valued.\n$\\log(i) = \\ln|i| + i \\cdot \\text{arg}(i)$, where $\\text{arg}(i)$ represents all possible arguments of $i$.\n*   $|i| = 1$, so $\\ln|i| = \\ln(1) = 0$.\n*   The principal argument of $i$ is $\\text{Arg}(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The general argument is $\\text{arg}(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThus, $\\log(i) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nLet's define $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe original equation becomes a family of equations, one for each integer $k$:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot i C_k}$\n\n**2. Solve the Equation Formally**\n\nTo solve for $z$, we can introduce a substitution. Let $w = z \\cdot i$. The equation transforms into:\n$w = e^{w C_k}$\nThis is a transcendental equation of a form that can be solved using the Lambert W function. The Lambert W function, $W(x)$, is defined as the function that satisfies $W(x)e^{W(x)} = x$.\nTo get our equation into this form, we rearrange it:\n$1 = \\frac{e^{w C_k}}{w}$\n$w e^{-w C_k} = 1$\nMultiply by $-C_k$:\n$(-w C_k) e^{-w C_k} = -C_k$\nLet $X = -w C_k$. The equation is now in the canonical form $X e^X = -C_k$.\nThe solution for $X$ is given by the Lambert W function:\n$X = W_n(-C_k)$\nwhere $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the different branches of the Lambert W function.\n\nNow, we substitute back to find $z$:\n$X = -w C_k \\implies w = -\\frac{X}{C_k} = -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$\nAnd since $w = zi$, we have $z = \\frac{w}{i} = -iw$:\n$z = -i \\left( -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k} \\right) = i \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$\n\nThe complete set of solutions for $z$ is given by:\n$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for all integers $k$ and $n$.\n\n**3. Characterize the Solutions**\n\nWe can find specific types of solutions by analyzing the properties of the Lambert W function for a real argument $a = -C_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\n\n**A. Real Solutions (z = x, where y=0)**\nLet's test for simple real solutions first.\n*   **Test z = 1:**\n    LHS: $1 \\cdot i = i$\n    RHS: $i^1 = i$\n    LHS = RHS, so $z=1$ is a solution. This solution holds for any branch $k$ of the logarithm because $i^1 = e^{1 \\cdot \\log(i)} = e^{i(\\pi/2+2k\\pi)} = \\cos(\\pi/2+2k\\pi) + i\\sin(\\pi/2+2k\\pi) = 0 + i(1) = i$.\n*   **Test z = -1:**\n    LHS: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$\n    RHS: $i^{-1} = \\frac{1}{i} = -i$\n    LHS = RHS, so $z=-1$ is a solution. This also holds for any branch $k$.\n\nOur formal analysis using the Lambert W function must also yield these solutions. A solution $z$ is real if its imaginary part is zero. Let $z = x+iy$ and $W_n(-C_k) = U+iV$. Then $x = -V/C_k$ and $y=U/C_k$. For $z$ to be real, $y=0 \\implies U=0$. We found in our thought process that this condition leads precisely to $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n**B. Purely Imaginary Solutions (z = iy, where x=0)**\nFor a solution to be purely imaginary, its real part must be zero.\n$x = 0 \\implies -V/C_k = 0 \\implies V=0$.\nThis means $W_n(-C_k)$ must be a real number. The Lambert W function $W(a)$ produces real values for a real argument $a$ only if $a \\ge -1/e$.\nThe argument is $a = -C_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nThe condition is $-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) \\ge -1/e$.\n$\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi \\le 1/e \\approx 0.3678$\n$\\pi(1/2 + 2k) \\le 1/e$\n$1/2 + 2k \\le \\frac{1}{\\pi e} \\approx 0.117$\n$2k \\le 0.117 - 0.5 = -0.383$\n$k \\le -0.1915$\nSince $k$ must be an integer, this condition holds for all $k \\le -1$.\n\nFor $k \\le -1$, $-C_k > 0$. For a positive argument, only the principal branch $n=0$ gives a real value for $W(a)$.\nThus, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is exactly one purely imaginary solution given by the branch $n=0$:\n$z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\n\n**C. Other Complex Solutions ($x \\ne 0$ and $y \\ne 0$)**\nAll other combinations of $k$ and $n$ yield complex solutions where neither the real nor imaginary part is zero.\n1.  For $k \\le -1$, the branches $n \\ne 0$ of $W_n(-C_k)$ are complex.\n2.  For $k \\ge 0$, the argument $-C_k$ is less than $-1/e$, so all branches $W_n(-C_k)$ are complex.\n\nThese cases generate an infinite number of complex solutions, which include the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$ as specific instances.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ has an infinite number of solutions in the complex plane. The solutions can be categorized as follows:\n\n1.  **Real solutions:**\n    There are two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n2.  **Purely imaginary solutions:**\n    There is an infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions, one for each integer $k \\le -1$, given by:\n    $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\n    where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function. For example, for $k=-1$, the solution is $z_{-1} = i \\frac{W_0(3\\pi/2)}{-3\\pi/2} = -i \\frac{W_0(3\\pi/2)}{3\\pi/2}$.\n\n3.  **Other complex solutions:**\n    There exists a doubly infinite set of complex solutions of the form $z=x+iy$ with $x \\ne 0$ and $y \\ne 0$. These are given by the general formula\n    $z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\n    for all integer pairs $(k,n)$ that do not result in the real or purely imaginary solutions described above.\n\n<<<The solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ are given by the set $z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for all integers $k, n$. This set includes:\n1. Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2. An infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for each integer $k \\le -1$.\n3.
