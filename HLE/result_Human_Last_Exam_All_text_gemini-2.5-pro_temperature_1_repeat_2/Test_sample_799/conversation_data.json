    "Answering this question requires combining concepts from additive combinatorics (Sidon sets) and fractal geometry (Hausdorff dimension). Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set of real numbers, $A$, is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums are unique up to the order of summands. Formally, if $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \\in A$ satisfy the equation $a_1 + a_2 = a_3 + a_4$, then it must be that the multisets $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$ and $\\{a_3, a_4\\}$ are the same. This means that either ($a_1=a_3$ and $a_2=a_4$) or ($a_1=a_4$ and $a_2=a_3$). The essential property is that there are no non-trivial solutions to $a_1+a_2 = a_3+a_4$.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(E)$, is a way to measure the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of a set $E$, particularly for sets that are fractals. It generalizes the standard notion of dimension (0 for points, 1 for lines, 2 for areas, etc.) to non-integer values. For any set $E \\subset [0, 1]$, its Hausdorff dimension is a number between 0 and 1.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound\n\nThe first part of the analysis is to determine if there is a limit to how \"large\" (in the sense of Hausdorff dimension) a Sidon set can be.\n\n*   **Intuition:** The Sidon property imposes a strong structural constraint on the set. It forces the elements to be \"spread out\" in a way that avoids arithmetic coincidences. This suggests that a Sidon set must be sparse and cannot be too large. For instance, it is a known result that any Sidon set must have Lebesgue measure zero, which means its Hausdorff dimension is at most 1.\n\n*   **A Key Theorem:** A fundamental result, proven independently by J. D. Stafney (1969) and Jean-Pierre Kahane (1971), provides a much stronger upper bound. They showed that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ must be less than or equal to $1/2$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The proof of this theorem is highly non-trivial. It uses Fourier analysis on measures supported by the set. The argument, in essence, shows that if a set had a dimension greater than $1/2$, it would support a measure whose Fourier transform has certain \"nice\" properties. These properties, when combined with the Sidon condition, lead to a mathematical contradiction.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Step 2:** From this theorem, we know that the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is no more than $1/2$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound (Constructing \"Large\" Sidon Sets)\n\nThe second part of the analysis is to determine if the upper bound of $1/2$ can be reached or, at least, approached arbitrarily closely. This requires showing the existence of Sidon sets with high Hausdorff dimension.\n\n*   **Simple Constructions:** One might try to construct a Sidon set using a Cantor-like method. For example, consider the set of numbers whose base-3 expansion contains only the digits 0 and 1 (the standard Cantor set). This set has dimension $\\log(2)/\\log(3) \\approx 0.63 > 1/2$, so it cannot be a Sidon set. Indeed, it is easy to find counterexamples. More complex constructions based on very sparse digit positions can yield Sidon sets, but typically their dimension is difficult to calculate and does not obviously reach $1/2$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is surprisingly difficult to construct an explicit set that is provably a Sidon set and has a large Hausdorff dimension. Many simple-looking Cantor-type constructions fail to be Sidon sets for subtle reasons related to arithmetic in different bases and the interaction between digit positions.\n\n*   **Probabilistic Constructions:** The existence of Sidon sets with dimensions approaching $1/2$ was first established by Jean-Pierre Kahane using probabilistic methods. He proved that for any number $\\alpha < 1/2$, there exists a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension equal to $\\alpha$.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Step 3:** Kahane's result shows that the supremum of the Hausdorff dimensions of all Sidon sets is at least $1/2$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the results from the previous steps:\n1.  The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set is $\\le 1/2$.\n2.  For any $\\alpha < 1/2$, there exists a Sidon set with dimension $\\alpha$.\n\nThis means the supremum of the possible dimensions is exactly $1/2$. The question asks for the *maximum* dimension. This requires knowing if the value $1/2$ is attainable.\n\n*   **Attainability of the Maximum:** For some time, it was an open question whether a Sidon set could have a dimension of exactly $1/2$. This question was answered affirmatively by the mathematician Jean Bourgain in the late 1980s. He constructed a Sidon set (again, via a sophisticated probabilistic argument) whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly $1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the supremum is achieved and is a maximum.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is $1/2$.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
