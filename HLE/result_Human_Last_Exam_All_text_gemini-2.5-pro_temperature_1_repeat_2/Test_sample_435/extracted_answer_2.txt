Given that interleukin-15 promotes the development of a long-lived, highly proliferative memory T cell phenotype, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit a more robust and sustained release of cytokines upon antigen encounter compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. This is because the IL-15-conditioned cells persist longer and expand to a greater number in vivo, leading to a larger population of effector cells that collectively produce more cytokines over time.
