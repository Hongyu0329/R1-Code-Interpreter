    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of the given logical fragment.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Language and the Problem\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of four unary predicates, which we can denote as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A model for this schema will have a domain of elements, and for each predicate $P_i$, an interpretation which is a subset of the domain.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic built using the predicates from $S$. The allowed logical constructs are:\n    *   $\\exists$: The existential quantifier.\n    *   $\\land$: Conjunction (AND).\n    *   $\\top, \\bot$: The constants for True and False.\n    *   Atomic formulas are of the form $P_i(v)$, where $v$ is a variable.\n*   **VC Dimension**: We are looking for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the *concept class* defined by this logic. A concept is a set of domain elements that satisfy a given property. In our case, the concepts are defined by formulas with exactly one free variable, let's call it $x$. For a given formula $\\phi(x)$, the corresponding concept is the set of all elements `a` in the domain such that $\\phi(a)$ is true. The VC dimension is the size of the largest set of points that can be \"shattered\" by this concept class.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the Formulas (Classifiers)\n\nLet's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(x)$ in this language with one free variable $x$.\nA formula is built from atomic formulas like $P_i(y)$ (where $y$ can be $x$ or another variable) using only $\\land$ and $\\exists$.\n\nConsider a general formula $\\phi(x)$. By using the distributive law of $\\exists$ over $\\land$ (i.e., $\\exists y(\\alpha(x) \\land \\beta(y))$ is equivalent to $\\alpha(x) \\land \\exists y \\beta(y)$ when $y$ is not free in $\\alpha(x)$), we can rewrite any formula $\\phi(x)$ into an equivalent form:\n$$ \\phi(x) \\equiv C(x) \\land S $$\nwhere:\n*   $C(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas where the only variable is $x$. For example, $C(x)$ could be $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$. This is a **monomial** in the predicates applied to $x$. The empty conjunction is $\\top$.\n*   $S$ is a **sentence**, which is a formula with no free variables. For example, $S$ could be $\\exists y (P_2(y) \\land P_4(y))$.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize the Concept Class\n\nFor a given model (which specifies the domain and the interpretation of the predicates $P_i$), the sentence $S$ is either globally true or globally false for that entire model.\n\nThis means that for any given model, a formula $\\phi(x) \\equiv C(x) \\land S$ defines one of two sets:\n1.  If the sentence $S$ is false in the model, then $\\phi(x)$ is false for every element $x$. The defined concept is the **empty set** ($\\emptyset$).\n2.  If the sentence $S$ is true in the model, then $\\phi(x)$ is true if and only if $C(x)$ is true. The defined concept is the set of elements satisfying the monomial $C(x)$.\n\nTherefore, for any model, the collection of all definable sets (the concept class) is a subset of the collection of sets definable by all possible monomials on the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$, plus the empty set.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{mono}}$ be the class of concepts defined by monomials over the four predicates. The concept class for our logic, $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{FO}}$, satisfies $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{FO}} \\subseteq \\mathcal{H}_{\\text{mono}} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$ for any model.\n\n### Step 4: Establish an Upper Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a class of concepts is at most the VC dimension of any of its superclasses. It is a known result from learning theory that the VC dimension of the class of monomials on $k$ boolean attributes is exactly $k$.\n\nIn our case, we have 4 unary predicates, which act as 4 boolean attributes for each element in the domain. Thus, the VC dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{mono}}$ is 4.\nAdding the empty set to a concept class does not increase its VC dimension.\nSo, $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{FO}}) \\le \\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{mono}} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}) = \\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{mono}}) = 4$.\nThis gives us an **upper bound of 4**.\n\n### Step 5: Establish a Lower Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that there exists some model and a set of 4 points in its domain that can be shattered by formulas from our logic. Shattering a set means being able to generate every possible subset of it as a concept.\n\nLet's construct such a model:\n*   **Domain**: Let the domain be a set of 4 points, $D = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$.\n*   **Predicates**: We define the interpretation of the four predicates on this domain. For $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, let the interpretation of $P_i$ be the set of all points in $D$ except $c_i$:\n    *   $P_1 = \\{c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$\n    *   $P_2 = \\{c_1, c_3, c_4\\}$\n    *   $P_3 = \\{c_1, c_2, c_4\\}$\n    *   $P_4 = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3\\}$\n\nNow, we must show that any subset of $D$ can be realized by a formula $\\phi(x)$ from our logic. Let $A$ be an arbitrary subset of $D$. We need to find a formula $\\phi_A(x)$ that is true for all $x \\in A$ and false for all $x \\in D \\setminus A$.\n\nLet's define an index set $I_A = \\{i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\mid c_i \\notin A\\}$.\nConsider the formula $\\phi_A(x) := \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_A} P_i(x)$. This is a simple monomial, which is a valid formula in our logic (it's of the form $C(x) \\land \\top$).\n\nLet's evaluate this formula for an arbitrary point $c_j \\in D$:\n*   $\\phi_A(c_j)$ is true if and only if $c_j \\in P_i$ for all $i \\in I_A$.\n*   By our construction of the predicates, $c_j \\in P_i$ if and only if $j \\neq i$.\n*   So, $\\phi_A(c_j)$ is true if and only if $j \\neq i$ for all $i \\in I_A$.\n*   This is equivalent to saying that $j$ is not in the set $I_A$.\n*   By definition of $I_A$, $j \\notin I_A$ if and only if $c_j \\in A$.\n\nSo, the formula $\\phi_A(x)$ defines exactly the set $A$. Since we can do this for any subset $A \\subseteq D$, we have successfully shattered the set $D$, which has size 4.\n\nThis proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that the VC dimension is at most 4 and at least 4. Therefore, the VC dimension must be exactly 4.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$.\n<<<4>>>"
