    "An analysis of the question is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\nWe are given a first-order autonomous ordinary differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, where $m$ is the number of stable equilibrium points of this system.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the constant solutions to the differential equation. They are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$.\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$$\n-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n$$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$\n-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$\n-x(x-1)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this equation are the equilibrium points:\n$x = 0$\nand\n$(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x-1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$.\nSo, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ for an autonomous system $x' = f(x)$ can be determined by the sign of the derivative $f'(x^*)$.\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable (asymptotically stable).\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we need to examine the sign of $f(x)$ around the equilibrium point.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1\n$$\nNow we test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    Substitute $x=0$ into $f'(x)$:\n    $$\n    f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1\n    $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    Substitute $x=1$ into $f'(x)$:\n    $$\n    f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0\n    $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, we must use another method to determine the stability. We will analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the vicinity of $x=1$.\n\n**Step 4: Further analysis for the equilibrium point $x=1$**\nWe examine the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of $x=1$.\n*   **For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$):**\n    $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$ for $x<1$ and close to 1, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from $x=1$.\n*   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$):**\n    $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -1.1(0.01) = -0.011$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$ for $x>1$ and close to 1, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards $x=1$.\n\nOn a phase line, the direction of flow is towards $x=1$ from the right, but away from $x=1$ on the left (`<-- 1 <--`). An equilibrium point with this behavior is called **semistable**. A semistable equilibrium is not considered stable because trajectories starting on one side (in this case, the left side) do not stay near or approach the point.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the value of m**\nThe variable $m$ represents the number of stable equilibrium points.\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium.\n*   $x=1$ is a semistable equilibrium.\nBased on the standard definitions, only $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium. Therefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final result**\nWe need to calculate the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression, we get:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1-2^4048>>>"
