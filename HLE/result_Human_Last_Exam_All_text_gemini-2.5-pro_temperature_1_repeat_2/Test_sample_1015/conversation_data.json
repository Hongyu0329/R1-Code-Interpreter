    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods, leading to the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Movement - Cambré Derrière**\nA \"cambré\" is an arched movement of the upper body, bending from the waist. \"Derrière\" means \"to the back.\" So, a cambré derrière is a bend of the upper body backward. This movement requires flexibility in the spine, core strength to control the movement, and stability in the lower body.\n\n**Step-2: Analyze the Vaganova Method Approach**\nThe Vaganova method, developed in Russia by Agrippina Vaganova, emphasizes strength, purity of line, and precise, codified technique.\n*   **Initiation:** The bend starts from the upper back (the thoracic spine), lifting the chest towards the ceiling.\n*   **Hips:** This is a crucial point. In the Vaganova technique, the hips must remain perfectly square and stacked directly over the supporting legs/feet. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault as it breaks the clean, vertical line of support and is seen as compensating for a lack of back flexibility. The goal is to create a long, even arch in the spine without displacing the pelvis.\n*   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back without dropping heavily. The arms, often in 5th position en haut, open slightly to frame the face and shoulders, maintaining a classical and controlled aesthetic.\n*   **Overall Aesthetic:** Controlled, elegant, and demonstrating core strength and spinal flexibility without compromising lower body alignment.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method Approach**\nThe Balanchine method, developed by George Balanchine, is known for its speed, dynamism, musicality, and exaggerated, \"neoclassical\" lines. It often pushes the boundaries of classical technique for aesthetic effect.\n*   **Initiation:** The bend is often more dramatic and can be executed more quickly.\n*   **Hips:** This is the primary point of difference. The Balanchine style not only allows but often *encourages* the dancer to press the hips forward as the upper body bends back. This forward displacement of the pelvis acts as a counterbalance, allowing for a much deeper and more extreme backbend.\n*   **Head and Arms:** The head may be more released, dropping further back to enhance the dramatic line. The arms might move with more speed and less formal rigidity.\n*   **Overall Aesthetic:** Dynamic, athletic, and visually spectacular. The \"broken\" line created by the forward-pressed hips is a hallmark of the Balanchine aesthetic, prioritizing a deep C-curve over the strict vertical alignment of the Vaganova method.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on the Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there can be subtle stylistic differences in the *port de bras* (carriage of the arms), the fundamental positions are similar. This is not the most significant or defining difference.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most fundamental and widely recognized difference. Vaganova insists on keeping the hips stable and aligned over the feet. Balanchine uses a forward press of the hips to achieve a deeper bend. This is a core technical distinction between the two styles for this step.\n*   **C. Speed:** Balanchine choreography is generally faster, but speed is a performance quality, not a foundational technique difference. A cambré can be done slowly or quickly in either method depending on the exercise or choreography. The *way* it is formed (hip placement) is more fundamental than the speed.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The deeper backbend in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the hip placement. Allowing the hips to move forward enables a greater degree of bend. Therefore, the hip placement is the cause, and the degree of the bend is the effect. The hip placement is the more precise and primary technical difference.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** The head placement is a stylistic nuance that follows from the overall shape of the bend. While the Balanchine head may be more released, the Vaganova head also follows the line of the back. This is a less critical distinction than the action of the hips.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most critical and defining technical difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière is the placement of the hips. The Vaganova method emphasizes stability and alignment by keeping the hips over the feet, while the Balanchine method uses a forward press of the hips to create a more dynamic and deeper curve.\n\n<<<B>>>"
