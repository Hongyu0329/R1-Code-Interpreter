    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Interpreter and Her Field:** The question names \"Veronika Campan\" as the interpreter. A search for this name reveals she is a scholar known for her work in psychoanalysis and its intersection with theology and religious texts, particularly the Hebrew Bible. Her analysis often focuses on the Ten Commandments (the Decalogue).\n\n2.  **Identify \"HIS work\":** Given Veronika Campan's area of study and the clues provided, \"HIS work\" refers to the Ten Commandments, a foundational text of law and ethics in Judaism and Christianity.\n\n3.  **Identify \"HE\":** The question asks for the full name of \"HE,\" the person associated with this work. In the biblical narrative (specifically in the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy), the prophet who receives the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai and delivers them to the people is Moses. He is the central human figure and lawgiver associated with the Decalogue.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Clues about the Work's Content:**\n    *   **\"at the end of HIS work\":** This points to the conclusion of the list of the Ten Commandments.\n    *   **\"HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\":** This is a direct reference to the Tenth Commandment, which states, \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This commandment is unique in that it deals with desire and thought, not just outward actions.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Core Interpretation:** The most crucial clue is that HE \"did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"\n    *   The **\"prohibition against representation\"** is the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself a carved imageâ€”any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.\" This commandment forbids the creation of physical idols or images.\n    *   Veronika Campan's psychoanalytic interpretation, as described in the prompt, posits that the Tenth Commandment (against coveting) forces the individual to do something the Second Commandment prohibits, albeit in a different domain. To obey the command \"do not covet your neighbor's ox,\" one must first create a *mental representation* or image of the ox. This act of internal imagination is necessary to understand what one is forbidden from desiring.\n    *   Therefore, the lawgiver (Moses), at the very end of the Decalogue, introduces a command that relies on internal, mental representation, thus \"naturally ignoring\" the spirit of the earlier prohibition against external, physical representation.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the work is the Ten Commandments, and the interpreter is analyzing the relationship between the Second and Tenth commandments. The human author and lawgiver of this work is Moses.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Identifying the specific interpretation:** The key to solving the puzzle is understanding the sophisticated link Veronika Campan makes between the prohibition of images (Second Commandment) and the prohibition of coveting (Tenth Commandment).\n*   **Distinguishing the Law's Source:** While in the biblical narrative God is the ultimate author of the commandments, Moses is the human prophet, leader, and lawgiver who mediates them. The question's phrasing \"HIS work\" and asking for a \"full name\" points to this central human figure.\n*   **Understanding \"Naturally Ignoring\":** This phrase means the bypassing of the rule is not a direct contradiction but an unavoidable consequence of the logic of the final commandment. To regulate desire, one must first engage with the mental image of the object of desire.\n*   **The Full Name:** The individual is universally known by a single name, which serves as his full name in historical and religious contexts.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Subject:** A person (\"HE\").\n2.  **Work:** The Ten Commandments (The Decalogue).\n3.  **Interpreter:** Veronika Campan.\n4.  **Analysis:** Campan interprets the Tenth Commandment (on not coveting possessions) as requiring an internal, mental *representation* of the coveted object. This implicitly bypasses the Second Commandment's prohibition on *making* physical representations.\n5.  **Identity of \"HE\":** The lawgiver who delivered the Ten Commandments to the people. This figure is Moses.\n\nTherefore, the full name of the person in question is Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
