    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Question and Definitions\n\nFirst, let's define the key mathematical terms used in the question.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval [a, b], a circle, a sphere, or a square.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. This excludes a single point from being considered.\n*   **Product of two continua:** If X and Y are continua, their Cartesian product X × Y, equipped with the product topology, is also a continuum. This is because the product of two compact spaces is compact, the product of two connected spaces is connected, and the product of two metric spaces is metrizable.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. A **proper subcontinuum** is a subcontinuum that is a proper subset of the whole space.\n*   **Composant:** The composant of a point `p` in a continuum X is the set of all points `x` in X such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both `p` and `x`. The collection of all distinct composants of a continuum forms a partition of the space.\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum that can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. For example, the interval [0, 1] is decomposable because [0, 1] = [0, 2/3] ∪ [1/3, 1].\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable. Famous examples include the bucket handle (or Knaster continuum) and the pseudo-arc.\n\nThe question asks for the **largest possible number** of composants for a product space X × Y, where X and Y are any two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step 2: The Number of Composants of a Continuum\n\nA fundamental theorem in continuum theory relates the number of composants to the decomposability of the space.\n\n*   **Theorem:** A metric continuum has **exactly one** composant if and only if it is **decomposable**.\n    *   *Intuition:* If a continuum X is decomposable (X = A ∪ B), one can show that any two points can be \"connected\" via a chain of proper subcontinua, implying they all belong to the same composant.\n*   **Theorem:** A metric continuum has **`c`** (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., the uncountable cardinality of the real numbers) composants if and only if it is **indecomposable**.\n    *   *Intuition:* In an indecomposable continuum, \"most\" pairs of points cannot be contained in a single proper subcontinuum. This leads to a fragmentation of the space into a large number of disjoint, dense composants.\n\nTherefore, the number of composants of any continuum (including a product continuum X × Y) can only be one of two values: 1 or `c`.\n\n### Step 3: Framing the Problem\n\nGiven the dichotomy from Step 2, the question \"What is the largest possible number of composants of X × Y?\" simplifies to:\n\n\"Can the product of two nondegenerate continua, X × Y, be indecomposable?\"\n\n*   If the product X × Y must always be decomposable, then the number of composants is always 1, making 1 the largest possible number.\n*   If the product X × Y can be indecomposable for some choice of X and Y, then the number of composants can be `c`. Since `c` > 1, `c` would be the largest possible number.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Decomposability of the Product X × Y\n\nWe need to investigate whether X × Y is always decomposable or not. Let's consider the properties of X and Y.\n\n*   **Case 1: At least one of X or Y is decomposable.**\n    Suppose X is decomposable. By definition, X = A ∪ B, where A and B are proper subcontinua of X. Then the product space can be written as:\n    X × Y = (A ∪ B) × Y = (A × Y) ∪ (B × Y)\n    The sets A × Y and B × Y are continua (as products of continua). They are also *proper* subcontinua of X × Y because A and B are proper subsets of X. Therefore, X × Y is the union of two proper subcontinua, which means **X × Y is decomposable**.\n    In this case, the number of composants is **1**.\n\n*   **Case 2: Both X and Y are indecomposable.**\n    This is the critical case. If the product of two indecomposable continua is always decomposable, then combined with Case 1, the answer to the question would be 1. If the product can be indecomposable, the answer is `c`. This was a famous and difficult problem in topology for many years.\n\n### Step 5: Citing Key Results from Continuum Theory\n\nThe history of this problem reveals the answer.\n\n1.  **R. H. Bing (1951):** Bing proved that the product of two pseudo-arcs is hereditarily decomposable. The pseudo-arc is a classic example of an indecomposable continuum. This result showed that the product of two indecomposable continua can be decomposable.\n\n2.  **J. M. Lysko (1975):** Based on results like Bing's, it was conjectured that the product of any two indecomposable continua is decomposable. Lysko published a paper claiming to have proven this conjecture. If his proof were correct, the answer to our question would be 1.\n\n3.  **Wayne Lewis (1983):** Lysko's proof was later found to contain a flaw. In 1983, Wayne Lewis provided a definitive answer by constructing an example of two indecomposable continua in ℝ³ whose product is **indecomposable**.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nLewis's result demonstrates that it is possible to find two nondegenerate (and indecomposable) continua X and Y such that their product X × Y is indecomposable.\n\n*   From Step 2, if a continuum is indecomposable, it has `c` composants.\n*   Therefore, it is possible for the product of two nondegenerate continua to have `c` composants.\n*   The possible values for the number of composants are 1 (if the product is decomposable) and `c` (if the product is indecomposable).\n\nThe largest possible number of these two options is `c`.\n\n`c` (also written as $2^{\\aleph_0}$) is the cardinality of the set of real numbers and represents an uncountably infinite number.\n\n<<<c>>>"
