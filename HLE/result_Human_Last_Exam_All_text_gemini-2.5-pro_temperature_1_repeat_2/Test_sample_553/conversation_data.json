    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Musical Theory in the Question**\n\n*   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It is built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major.\n*   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is the key part of the question. In a major key, the chord built on the fifth note is naturally a major chord (called the dominant or V chord). For instance, in C major, the fifth chord is G major. A \"minor fifth chord\" means this chord has been changed to minor (G minor in this case). This is a less common but very effective harmonic device, often borrowed from the parallel minor key (in our example, C minor). The progression would be written as I → v.\n*   **Chord Jump:** This simply means a direct change from one chord to another.\n*   **Starts with:** The progression must occur at the beginning of the song.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the Question into a Concrete Chord Progression**\n\nWe are looking for a Beatles song that starts by moving from its tonic major chord to its minor fifth chord. Using the key of C major as an example, this would be a progression from a **C major** chord to a **G minor** chord.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs**\n\nLet's examine the intros of several Beatles songs to see if they match this pattern.\n\n*   **\"Let It Be\":** Starts with C → G → Am → F. This is I → V → vi → IV in the key of C. The fifth chord (G) is major, not minor.\n*   **\"Hey Jude\":** Starts with F → C → C7 → F. This is I → V → V7 → I in the key of F. The fifth chord (C) is major, not minor.\n*   **\"A Day in the Life\":** The acoustic guitar section starts in G major. The progression is G → Bm → C. This is I → iii → IV. The jump is to the minor third chord, not the minor fifth.\n*   **\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\":** Starts in A minor. The intro progression is Am → G → C → E. The fifth chord here is E, and it's played as a major chord (E major), which is standard for a minor key to create a strong pull back to the tonic. This doesn't fit the question.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Correct Song**\n\nLet's analyze the song **\"I'll Follow the Sun\"** from the album *Beatles for Sale*.\n\n*   **Key:** The song is in the key of C major. The tonic (I) chord is **C major**.\n*   **Opening Chords:** The song begins immediately with the vocals and guitar.\n    *   The first line, \"One day, you'll look...\", is played over a **C major** chord (the tonic).\n    *   The second line, \"...to see I've gone\", immediately jumps to a **G minor 7th** chord (Gm7).\n*   **Analysis:** A G minor 7th chord is a G minor triad with a seventh added. Its core is G minor. G is the fifth note of the C major scale. Therefore, this progression is a jump from the tonic (C) to the minor fifth chord (Gm). This perfectly matches the criteria of the question.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"I'll Follow the Sun\". The progression is C major to G minor (specifically, Gm7), which is a classic I → v move.\n\n<<<I'll Follow the Sun>>>"
