    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Problem and Defining Terms\n\nFirst, let's understand the components of the question.\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum is *indecomposable* if it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. It is *hereditarily indecomposable* if every subcontinuum is also indecomposable. This is a very strong condition. The pseudo-arc is a classic example.\n*   **$X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:** We start with a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and remove a single point $x$. The resulting space, let's call it $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, is a locally compact, non-compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification ($\\beta Y$):** This is the largest possible compactification of a Tychonoff space $Y$. For any continuous map from $Y$ to a compact Hausdorff space $K$, there is a unique continuous extension from $\\beta Y$ to $K$.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder ($Y^*$):** The remainder is the set of points added to $Y$ to form its Stone-Cech compactification, i.e., $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$. In our case, since $X$ is a compactification of $Y$, there is a continuous map $\\pi: \\beta Y \\to X$ which is the identity on $Y$. The remainder $Y^*$ is precisely the preimage of the point $x$ under this map, so $Y^* = \\pi^{-1}(\\{x\\})$. It is a known result that for a locally compact connected space like $Y$, the remainder $Y^*$ is a continuum (compact and connected).\n*   **Composant of a Continuum:** For a point $p$ in a continuum $K$, its composant is the union of all proper subcontinua of $K$ that contain $p$. The relation \"being in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation, and the composants are the equivalence classes.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the maximum possible number of composants of the continuum $Y^*$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Properties of $X$\n\nThe condition that $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum has a crucial consequence: **$X$ must be atriodic.**\n*   A **triod** is a continuum that is the union of three subcontinua $A_1, A_2, A_3$ such that their common intersection is a single point (called the *core* of the triod) and this is the only point of intersection between any pair of them. A simple example is the letter 'T' or 'Y'.\n*   A triod is inherently **decomposable**. For example, it can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua $(A_1 \\cup A_2)$ and $A_3$.\n*   A space is **atriodic** if it does not contain any subcontinuum that is homeomorphic to a triod.\n*   **Proof that $X$ is atriodic:** Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $X$ contains a subcontinuum $T$ which is a triod. Since $X$ is hereditary indecomposable, every subcontinuum of $X$ must be indecomposable. This means $T$ must be indecomposable. But as we just noted, any triod is decomposable. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $X$ cannot contain any triods, meaning $X$ is atriodic.\n\n### Step 3: Applying a Key Theorem from Continuum Theory\n\nNow that we have established that $X$ is an atriodic hereditary indecomposable metric continuum, we can apply a deep and relevant theorem from the field. A result by W.T. Ingram (1977) states:\n\n> **Theorem (Ingram):** If $X$ is an atriodic and hereditary indecomposable metric continuum, then for each point $x \\in X$, the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ has exactly two composants.\n\nSince every continuum $X$ that satisfies the premise of our question also satisfies the conditions of Ingram's theorem, this theorem applies directly.\n\n### Step 4: Resolving a Potential Contradiction\n\nOne might recall two facts about a continuum $K$:\n1.  If $K$ is decomposable, it has exactly one composant.\n2.  If $K$ is an *indecomposable metric* continuum, it has uncountably many ($2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants.\n\nIngram's theorem states the remainder $Y^*$ has two composants.\n*   From fact (1), having two composants means $Y^*$ must be **indecomposable**.\n*   This seems to contradict fact (2), which says an indecomposable metric continuum should have uncountably many composants.\n\nThe resolution lies in the fact that the Stone-Cech remainder $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is **not metrizable**. The theorem that indecomposable metric continua have uncountably many composants does not apply to non-metric continua. The remainder $Y^*$ is an example of an indecomposable continuum (which is not metric) that has a finite number of composants.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nAccording to Ingram's theorem, for *any* hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and *any* point $x \\in X$, the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder is exactly 2.\n\nThe question asks for the *maximum possible* number. Since the number is always 2, the maximum possible number is also 2."
