    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Parameters of the Question**\n*   **Vessel Nationality:** French.\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** Attacked and sunk by a German U-boat.\n*   **Timeframe:** During World War II, but specifically before the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This period runs from September 3, 1939, to June 22, 1940.\n*   **Metric for \"Largest\":** Displacement, which is the measure of the ship's weight.\n\n**Step 2: Investigate Major French Warship Losses**\nFirst, we must check if any major warships of the French Navy (Marine Nationale) fit the criteria, as they would have the largest displacements.\n*   **Battleships:** The battleship *Bretagne* (22,189 tons displacement) was sunk on July 3, 1940, which is *after* the armistice date, and it was sunk by the British Royal Navy at Mers-el-Kébir, not a U-boat. No other French battleships were sunk by U-boats in this period.\n*   **Cruisers and Aircraft Carriers:** No French aircraft carriers, heavy cruisers, or light cruisers were sunk by U-boats before the June 1940 armistice.\nThis analysis indicates that the largest vessel will likely be a merchant ship or a naval auxiliary rather than a major combatant.\n\n**Step 3: Research French Merchant and Auxiliary Ships Sunk by U-boats**\nWe now need to compile a list of French merchant ships sunk by U-boats between September 1939 and June 22, 1940, and compare their sizes. For merchant ships, size is often given in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a measure of volume, but this can be used to estimate displacement.\n\n*   **SS *Champollion*:** A passenger liner of 12,263 GRT, sunk by *U-45* on October 3, 1939. Its displacement would have been approximately 17,000 tons.\n*   **SS *Brazza*:** A passenger liner of 10,387 GRT, sunk by *U-37* on May 28, 1940. Its displacement would have been around 15,000 tons.\n*   **SS *Bretagne* (Liner):** A passenger liner of 10,108 GRT, sunk by *U-45* on October 14, 1939. Its displacement was also around 15,000 tons.\n*   **SS *Shéhérazade*:** A large oil tanker of 13,467 GRT, sunk by *U-41* on November 12, 1939.\n\n**Step 4: Compare Candidates and Determine the Largest by Displacement**\nWhile the passenger liner *Champollion* had a high GRT, oil tankers have a very high displacement relative to their GRT when fully loaded.\n*   The **SS *Shéhérazade*** was a very large tanker for its time.\n*   Its Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) was 13,467 tons.\n*   Its Deadweight Tonnage (a measure of how much weight it can carry) was 20,400 tons.\n*   Its full load displacement (the weight of the ship plus its crew, stores, fuel, and cargo) is calculated to be approximately **27,150 tons**.\n\nThis displacement of over 27,000 tons is significantly greater than that of any other French ship, military or civilian, sunk by a U-boat before the armistice.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the Armistice of 22 June 1940 was the oil tanker **SS *Shéhérazade***.\n\n<<<SS Shéhérazade>>>"
