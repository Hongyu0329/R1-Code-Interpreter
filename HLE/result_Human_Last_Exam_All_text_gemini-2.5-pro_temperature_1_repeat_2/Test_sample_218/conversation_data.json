    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Irreps of $S_n$ to Partitions\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$ and $\\sum \\lambda_i = n$.\nThe problem is thus equivalent to finding the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep, denoted $f^\\lambda$, is less than 500,000.\n\n### Step 2: The Hook-Length Formula\nThe dimension $f^\\lambda$ of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is given by the hook-length formula:\n$$ f^\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{i,j}} $$\nwhere the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{i,j}$ is the hook length of the box at position $(i,j)$ (row $i$, column $j$). The hook length $h_{i,j}$ is the number of boxes to the right of $(i,j)$ in the same row, plus the number of boxes below $(i,j)$ in the same column, plus 1 (for the box itself).\n\nA key property is that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ (obtained by reflecting the Young diagram across its main diagonal) correspond to irreps of the same dimension, i.e., $f^\\lambda = f^{\\lambda'}$. If $\\lambda \\ne \\lambda'$, this pair contributes two irreps of the same dimension. If $\\lambda = \\lambda'$ (a self-conjugate partition), it contributes only one irrep. For $n=25$, self-conjugate partitions exist, but we will see that their dimensions are very large.\n\n### Step 3: Strategy for Finding Partitions\nThe dimension $f^\\lambda$ is small when the product of hook lengths, $H_\\lambda = \\prod h_{i,j}$, is large. This generally occurs for partitions whose Young diagrams are \"long and thin\" or \"tall and narrow\". These correspond to partitions with very large or very small first parts, i.e., partitions \"far from the center\". We will systematically search for such partitions.\n\nWe can simplify the search by considering only partitions $\\lambda=(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ where $\\lambda_1 \\ge n/2 = 12.5$. For such a partition, its conjugate $\\lambda'$ will have a first part $\\lambda'_1 \\le n/2$. This ensures we do not double-count any pair $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$. We will sum up the number of such partitions found and multiply by 2 (since for $n=25$, $\\lambda \\ne \\lambda'$ if $\\lambda_1 \\ne \\lambda'_1$).\n\n### Step 4: Calculation of Dimensions\n\nWe list partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 with $\\lambda_1 \\ge 13$ and calculate their dimensions.\n\n1.  **Partitions with 1 part:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(25)$: $f^{(25)} = 1$. (1 partition)\n\n2.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 24$:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(24,1)$: $f^{(24,1)} = n-1 = 24$. (1 partition)\n\n3.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 23$:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,2)$: $f^{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,1,1)$: $f^{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. (2 partitions)\n\n4.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 22$:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,3)$: $f^{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,1^3)$: $f^{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$: $f^{(22,2,1)} = 4025$. (3 partitions)\n\n5.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 21$:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,4)$: $f^{(21,4)} = 10350$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,1^4)$: $f^{(21,1^4)} = 10626$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,3,1)$: $f^{(21,3,1)} = 19950$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,1^2)$: $f^{(21,2,1^2)} = 31625$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,2)$: $f^{(21,2,2)} = 42000$. (5 partitions)\n\n6.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 20$:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,5)$: $f^{(20,5)} = 40480$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,1^5)$: $f^{(20,1^5)} = 42504$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,4,1)$: $f^{(20,4,1)} = 164220$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,2,1^3)$: $f^{(20,2,1^3)} = 166705$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,2,2,1)$: $f^{(20,2,2,1)} = 199500$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,3,2)$: $f^{(20,3,2)} = 207000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,3,1^2)$: $f^{(20,3,1^2)} = 249480$. (7 partitions)\n\n7.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 19$:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,6)$: $f^{(19,6)} = 123970$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,1^6)$: $f^{(19,1^6)} = 134596$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,3,3)$: $f^{(19,3,3)} = 322275$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,4,2)$: $f^{(19,4,2)} = 384560$.\n    *   Calculations for other partitions like $(19,5,1)$ yield dimensions greater than 500,000. (4 partitions)\n\n8.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 18$:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,7)$: $f^{(18,7)} = 303600$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,1^7)$: $f^{(18,1^7)} = 346104$.\n    *   Calculations for other partitions like $(18,6,1)$ or $(18,5,2)$ yield dimensions greater than 500,000. (2 partitions)\n\n9.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 \\le 17$:**\n    *   For $\\lambda=(17,8)$, $f^{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1081575 - 480700 = 600875 > 500,000$.\n    *   For $\\lambda=(17,1^8)$, $f^{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735471 > 500,000$.\n    *   Partitions that are \"more central\" (with $\\lambda_1$ closer to $n/2$) will have even larger dimensions. Thus, there are no more partitions with $\\lambda_1 \\ge 13$ that satisfy the condition.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\nWe sum the number of partitions found with $\\lambda_1 \\ge 13$:\n$1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 4 + 2 = 25$.\n\nEach of these 25 partitions has a conjugate partition, which is distinct from the original partition (since $\\lambda_1 > 12.5$ implies $\\lambda'_1 \\le 12$). Each pair $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$ corresponds to two irreps (one for $\\lambda$ and one for $\\lambda'$) with the same dimension, which is less than 500,000.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such irreducible representations is $25 \\times 2 = 50$."
