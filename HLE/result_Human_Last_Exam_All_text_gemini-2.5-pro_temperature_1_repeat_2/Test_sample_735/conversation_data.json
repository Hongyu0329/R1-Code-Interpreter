    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question: \"How many finite groups contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3?\"\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, inverses for all elements, and a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-free set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all elements `x` and `y` in `S` (including the case `x=y`), their product `x*y` is not in `S`. In other words, the set of products `S*S = {x*y | x, y ∈ S}` is disjoint from `S` (`S*S ∩ S = ∅`).\n*   **Maximal by inclusion product-free set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g` in `G \\ S`, the set `S U {g}` is *not* product-free.\n*   **Size 3:** The set `S` must have exactly three elements, i.e., `|S| = 3`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Conditions\n\nLet `S = {a, b, c}` be a subset of a finite group `G`.\n\n**Condition 1: S is product-free.**\nThis means that none of the following 9 products can be in `S`:\n`a*a, a*b, a*c, b*a, b*b, b*c, c*a, c*b, c*c`.\nA crucial observation: the identity element `e` can never be in a product-free set `S`. If `e ∈ S`, then for any `s ∈ S`, `e*s = s`, which is in `S`. This violates the product-free condition. So, `e ∉ S`.\n\n**Condition 2: S is maximal.**\nFor any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S U {g}` is not product-free.\nSince `S` is product-free, any product `x*y` in `S'` that demonstrates this must involve `g`. This leads to four possibilities for any `g ∈ G \\ S`:\n1.  `g*g ∈ S U {g}`\n2.  `g*s ∈ S U {g}` for some `s ∈ S`\n3.  `s*g ∈ S U {g}` for some `s ∈ S`\n4.  `s1*s2 = g` for some `s1, s2 ∈ S`\n\nExpanding these, for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, at least one of the following must hold for some `s, t, s1, s2 ∈ S`:\n*   `g = s1 * s2` (g is in `S*S`)\n*   `g*s = t` (which implies `g = t * s⁻¹`, so `g` is in `S*S⁻¹`)\n*   `s*g = t` (which implies `g = s⁻¹ * t`, so `g` is in `S⁻¹*S`)\n*   `g*g = s`\n*   The special case `g=e`. The set `S U {e}` is never product-free (since `e*s = s` for `s ∈ S`). The condition is always satisfied for `g=e`.\n\nSo, the maximality condition implies that the entire group `G` must be \"covered\" by `S` and sets derived from `S`. Specifically, `G = S U S*S U S*S⁻¹ U S⁻¹*S U {g ∈ G | g² ∈ S} U {e}`.\n\n### Step 3: Finding Candidate Groups\n\nThis problem is a classification problem in group theory. Solving it from first principles is complex. The standard approach is to consult the mathematical literature.\n\n*   A paper by G.L. Walls (2011) claimed the groups are Z₉, Z₃ × Z₃, D₁₀, and A₅.\n*   A more recent paper by M. Giudici, S. Hart, and M. R. Serpi (Journal of Algebra, 2016) provides a complete classification and explicitly states that the earlier list by Walls is incomplete. For example, the group Z₆ contains the set S = {1, 3, 5} (the odd numbers under addition mod 6), which is a maximal product-free set of size 3. Thus, we should rely on the more recent, comprehensive result.\n\nThe 2016 paper provides the following complete list of finite groups that contain a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n\n1.  **Z₆** (cyclic group of order 6)\n2.  **Z₈** (cyclic group of order 8)\n3.  **Z₉** (cyclic group of order 9)\n4.  **Z₁₀** (cyclic group of order 10)\n5.  **Z₁₂** (cyclic group of order 12)\n6.  **Z₁₄** (cyclic group of order 14)\n7.  **D₈** (dihedral group of order 8, symmetries of a square)\n8.  **D₁₀** (dihedral group of order 10, symmetries of a pentagon)\n9.  **Z₂ × Z₆** (direct product of cyclic groups of order 2 and 6)\n10. **Z₃ ⋊ Z₄** (a semidirect product of Z₃ by Z₄, where the generator of Z₄ acts on Z₃ by inversion)\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Non-isomorphic Groups\n\nThe final step is to count how many distinct (non-isomorphic) groups are on this list.\n\n*   The cyclic groups Zₙ are non-isomorphic for different `n`. This gives **6 groups**: Z₆, Z₈, Z₉, Z₁₀, Z₁₂, Z₁₄.\n*   At order 8, we have Z₈ (abelian) and D₈ (non-abelian). They are not isomorphic. This adds **1 new group** (D₈).\n*   At order 10, we have Z₁₀ (abelian) and D₁₀ (non-abelian). They are not isomorphic. This adds **1 new group** (D₁₀).\n*   At order 12, we have three groups on the list:\n    *   Z₁₂ (abelian, cyclic, has an element of order 12).\n    *   Z₂ × Z₆ (abelian, not cyclic, max element order is lcm(2,6)=6).\n    *   Z₃ ⋊ Z₄ (non-abelian).\n    These three groups are non-isomorphic. This adds **2 new groups** (Z₂ × Z₆ and Z₃ ⋊ Z₄).\n\nCounting them all:\n1.  Z₆\n2.  Z₈\n3.  Z₉\n4.  Z₁₀\n5.  Z₁₂\n6.  Z₁₄\n7.  D₈\n8.  D₁₀\n9.  Z₂ × Z₆\n10. Z₃ ⋊ Z₄\n\nAll 10 groups in the list are non-isomorphic. Therefore, there are 10 such finite groups.\n\n<<<10>>>"
