    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* who vocalizes a particular sentiment: being ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth. This requires knowledge of the film's characters and key dialogue.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the characters involved.**\nLet's review the characters listed in the answer choices and their roles/personalities in the film.\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist, a psychologist sent to the Solaris station. His journey is central, and he is deeply tied to his memories of Earth, especially his country home (dacha) and his late wife, Hari. The film opens and closes with scenes of him in a lush, natural setting on Earth.\n*   **B. Hari:** Not a human from Earth, but a \"visitor\" or \"guest\" created by the Solaris ocean from Kris's memories. She has no independent memory of Earth to miss; her entire existence is confined to the station and Kris's psyche.\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** A cyberneticist who has been on the station for a long time. He appears cynical and world-weary but engages in deep, philosophical conversations with Kris about the nature of humanity, consciousness, and their purpose in space.\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** An astrobiologist who is rigid, cold, and strictly scientific. He is emotionally detached and views the \"visitors\" as a phenomenon to be studied and eliminated, not as a reflection of their own humanity. He shows little to no sentimentality.\n*   **E. Dr. Gibarian:** A physiologist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. We see him only in a prerecorded video message, where he is clearly in distress and warns Kris about the station.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the sentiment in the context of the characters.**\nThe statement \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth\" is a poignant expression of homesickness and a loss of connection with one's own humanity and home planet.\n*   Sartorius is the least likely character to say this, as it contradicts his cold, scientific nature.\n*   Hari cannot say this, as she has never been on Earth.\n*   Gibarian's message is one of immediate horror and warning, not nostalgic reflection.\n*   Kris is a strong candidate because the entire film revolves around his connection to Earth and his past. However, he is often the one listening and processing the situation rather than articulating such philosophical summations.\n*   Snaut, despite his cynicism, is the one who most often engages in philosophical dialogue that encapsulates the crew's existential predicament. He has had years to reflect on their isolation.\n\n**Step 4: Recall or verify the specific dialogue.**\nIn a key conversation with Kris, Dr. Snaut reflects on the futility and hubris of humanity's quest to conquer the cosmos. He muses that humanity doesn't really want other worlds; it wants a mirror. In this context, he confesses his own deep-seated longing for the simple, human experiences of Earth. He is the one who says he is ashamed to miss something as simple as the sound of rustling leaves, highlighting how their grand scientific endeavor has stripped them of their fundamental connection to their home.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nThe dialogue in question is spoken by Dr. Snaut. It serves to articulate a central theme of the film: the conflict between humanity's cosmic ambition and its fundamental need for human connection and the earthly home it came from.\n\n<<<C>>>"
