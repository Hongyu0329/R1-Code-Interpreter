    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the US city where Tommaso moves in the movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (Hard Boiled Egg)\n*   **Year:** 1997\n*   **Character:** Tommaso\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n*   **Action:** Moves to the United States\n*   **Question:** Which specific US city does he move to?\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the plot of *Ovosodo*.**\nThe film, directed by Paolo Virzì, follows the life of the protagonist, Piero Mansani, growing up in Livorno, Italy. A central figure in Piero's life is his best friend, Tommaso.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the character arc of Tommaso.**\nTommaso is depicted as coming from a wealthy, intellectual, but dysfunctional family. He is a close friend to Piero, introducing him to high culture. As the story progresses, Tommaso faces personal struggles, including coming to terms with his own identity and sexuality.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the specific plot point of Tommaso leaving.**\nTowards the end of the film, after a series of difficult personal events and feeling alienated from his surroundings in Livorno, Tommaso decides to leave Italy to start a new life. He chooses to move to the United States.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the destination city.**\nDetailed plot summaries and analyses of the film confirm that after Tommaso comes out as gay to Piero, he decides to move. The specific city he relocates to is explicitly mentioned as a place where he hopes to find more freedom and acceptance. This city is New York City.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Character vs. Actor:** The question is about the character Tommaso, not the actor Marco Cocci.\n*   **Plot Detail:** This is a specific plot detail, so relying on memory can be tricky. It's best to confirm with a reliable source like a detailed synopsis or film review.\n*   **Confirmation:** Cross-referencing sources (e.g., Italian and English Wikipedia entries for the film, IMDb plot summary) confirms that Tommaso's destination is indeed New York City. This represents his escape from the provincial confines of his hometown to a large, cosmopolitan metropolis.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the analysis of the film's plot, Tommaso moves to New York City.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
