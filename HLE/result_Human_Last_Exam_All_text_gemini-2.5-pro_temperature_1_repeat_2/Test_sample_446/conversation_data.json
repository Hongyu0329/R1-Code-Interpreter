    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Motif:** All five peptide options (A, B, C, D, E) share a common three-amino-acid sequence: **RGD** (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid).\n\n2.  **Understand the Significance of the RGD Motif:** The RGD sequence is a well-established and highly conserved cell adhesion motif. It serves as the primary recognition site for a large family of cell surface receptors called **integrins**. Integrins are found on the surface of most animal cells and mediate adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Many ECM proteins, such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin, contain the RGD sequence, which their cognate integrin receptors bind to.\n\n3.  **Consider the Role of Flanking Residues:** Since all options contain the essential RGD core, the difference in their ability to bind an integrin must lie in the amino acids that flank this core sequence (the residues that come after RGD). These flanking residues are not merely spacers; they play a crucial role in:\n    *   **Conformation:** They help to present the RGD motif in the correct three-dimensional shape (conformation) for optimal binding to the pocket on the integrin receptor.\n    *   **Specificity and Affinity:** They provide additional contact points with the integrin, which influences the binding strength (affinity) and determines which specific type of integrin (e.g., α5β1, αvβ3, etc.) the peptide will bind to.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Peptide Option based on Known Integrin Ligands:** We need to compare the given sequences to known RGD-containing sequences from natural integrin ligands or well-studied synthetic peptides.\n    *   The most famous and historically significant RGD-containing sequence is derived from **fibronectin**, a major ECM protein. The cell-binding domain of fibronectin contains the sequence **GRGDSP** (Glycine-Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Serine-Proline). Synthetic peptides containing this RGDSP sequence are widely used in biological research as a classic tool to study integrin function and to competitively inhibit cell adhesion to fibronectin-coated surfaces.\n    *   Let's examine the answer choices in light of this canonical sequence:\n        *   A. RGDMAA\n        *   B. RGDSPSS\n        *   C. RGDLTTP\n        *   D. RGDQVSK\n        *   E. RGDARGG\n\n5.  **Identify the Best Match:**\n    *   Peptide **B (RGDSPSS)** contains the core **RGDSP** sequence from fibronectin. The presence of this well-documented, high-affinity binding motif makes it extremely likely that this peptide will bind to integrins (particularly α5β1, the primary fibronectin receptor, but also others). The two additional serine residues (SS) at the C-terminus are unlikely to disrupt the binding of the RGDSP core and may serve to modulate its properties.\n    *   The other peptides have different flanking sequences. While it is theoretically possible that some of them might bind to a specific integrin subtype, they do not contain the classic, universally recognized fibronectin-derived binding sequence. Without further specific information about the target integrin, the peptide containing the canonical RGDSP motif is by far the most certain and well-documented binder.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe peptide RGDSPSS contains the RGDSP sequence, which is the well-known integrin-binding motif from fibronectin. Therefore, it is the peptide that has been extensively found to bind, and is most highly likely to bind, an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay.\n\n<<<B>>>"
