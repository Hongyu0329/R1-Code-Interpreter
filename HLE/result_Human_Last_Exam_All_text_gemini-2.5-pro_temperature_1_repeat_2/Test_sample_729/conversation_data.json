    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Group and the Question\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group (Q_4n):** The generalized quaternion group of order 4n is given by the presentation:\n    `Q_4n = < x, y | x^(2n) = 1, x^n = y^2, y^(-1)xy = x^(-1) >`\n    The question asks about the group of size 128. So, 4n = 128, which means n = 32.\n    Let G = Q_128. Its presentation is:\n    `G = < x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, y^(-1)xy = x^(-1) >`\n    *   The group G has 128 elements.\n    *   The elements are of the form `x^i` for `0 <= i < 64` and `x^i * y` for `0 <= i < 64`.\n    *   The element `x` generates a cyclic subgroup `<x>` of order 64.\n    *   The element `y` has order 4, since `y^2 = x^32` and `y^4 = (x^32)^2 = x^64 = 1`.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup (G^k):** For a group G and a positive integer k, the k-th power subgroup, denoted G^k, is the subgroup generated by the set of all k-th powers of elements in G.\n    `G^k = < g^k | g in G >`\n    The question is to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the k-th Powers of Elements in G\n\nWe need to compute `g^k` for every `g` in G. There are two forms of elements.\n\n1.  **Powers of `x^i`:**\n    `(x^i)^k = x^(ik)`\n\n2.  **Powers of `x^i * y`:**\n    Let's first compute `(x^i * y)^2`:\n    `(x^i * y)^2 = (x^i * y) * (x^i * y) = x^i * (y * x^i * y^(-1)) * y^2`.\n    From the relation `y^(-1)xy = x^(-1)`, we can derive `yxy^(-1) = x^(-1)`. Raising this to the power `i` gives `yx^iy^(-1) = (x^(-1))^i = x^(-i)`.\n    So, `(x^i * y)^2 = x^i * (x^(-i)) * y^2 = 1 * y^2 = x^32`.\n    This result is independent of `i`.\n\n    Now we can find `(x^i * y)^k`:\n    *   If `k` is even (let `k = 2m`), then `(x^i * y)^k = ((x^i * y)^2)^m = (x^32)^m = x^(32m)`.\n    *   If `k` is odd (let `k = 2m + 1`), then `(x^i * y)^k = (x^i * y)^(2m) * (x^i * y) = x^(32m) * x^i * y`.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Power Subgroups G^k\n\nWe analyze the structure of `G^k` based on the parity of `k`.\n\n**Case 1: `k` is odd**\n\n*   `G^k = < { (x^i)^k }, { (x^i*y)^k } | 0 <= i < 64 >`\n*   The set of powers `{(x^i)^k}` generates the subgroup `<x^k>`. Since `k` is odd, `gcd(k, 64) = 1`. Therefore, `<x^k> = <x>`.\n*   The set of powers `{(x^i*y)^k}` includes `(x^0*y)^k = y^k`. Since k is odd, `y^k` is either `y` or `y^3`. Both are elements of the form `something * y`, which are not in the cyclic subgroup `<x>`.\n*   Since `G^k` contains the entire subgroup `<x>` and at least one element not in `<x>` (e.g., `y^k`), `G^k` must be the entire group `G`.\n*   Thus, for any odd `k`, `G^k = G`. This gives us **one** distinct power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: `k` is even**\n\n*   Let `k = 2m` for some positive integer `m`.\n*   `G^k = G^(2m) = < { (x^i)^(2m) }, { (x^i*y)^(2m) } | 0 <= i < 64 >`\n*   As calculated before, `(x^i)^(2m) = x^(2mi)` and `(x^i*y)^(2m) = x^(32m)`.\n*   So, `G^(2m) = < { x^(2mi) }, x^(32m) >`.\n*   The set `{ x^(2mi) }` generates the subgroup `<x^gcd(2m, 64)>`.\n*   Therefore, `G^(2m) = < x^gcd(2m, 64), x^(32m) >`.\n*   This is a subgroup of `<x>`, so it is cyclic and can be written as `<x^d>` where `d = gcd(gcd(2m, 64), 32m) = gcd(2m, 64, 32m)`.\n\n### Step 4: Find all Distinct Subgroups for Even `k`\n\nWe need to find all possible values for `d = gcd(2m, 64, 32m)` as `m` ranges over all positive integers. Let's analyze the power of 2 in `d`. Let `v2(n)` be the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of `n`.\n`v2(d) = min( v2(2m), v2(64), v2(32m) )`\n`v2(d) = min( v2(m) + 1, 6, v2(m) + 5 )`\nSince `v2(m) + 1 <= v2(m) + 5`, this simplifies to:\n`v2(d) = min( v2(m) + 1, 6 )`\n\nThe odd part of `d` is `gcd(m_odd, 1, m_odd) = 1`, so `d` must be a power of 2.\nLet `j = v2(m)`. `j` can be any non-negative integer `0, 1, 2, ...`.\n\n*   If `j = 0` (m is odd), `v2(d) = min(1, 6) = 1`. So `d = 2^1 = 2`. The subgroup is `<x^2>`.\n*   If `j = 1`, `v2(d) = min(2, 6) = 2`. So `d = 2^2 = 4`. The subgroup is `<x^4>`.\n*   If `j = 2`, `v2(d) = min(3, 6) = 3`. So `d = 2^3 = 8`. The subgroup is `<x^8>`.\n*   If `j = 3`, `v2(d) = min(4, 6) = 4`. So `d = 2^4 = 16`. The subgroup is `<x^16>`.\n*   If `j = 4`, `v2(d) = min(5, 6) = 5`. So `d = 2^5 = 32`. The subgroup is `<x^32>`.\n*   If `j >= 5`, `v2(d) = min(j+1, 6) = 6`. So `d = 2^6 = 64`. The subgroup is `<x^64> = {1}` (the trivial subgroup).\n\nThe set of distinct subgroups generated for even values of `k` is:\n`{ <x^2>, <x^4>, <x^8>, <x^16>, <x^32>, {1} }`\nThis gives us **six** more distinct power subgroups.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nWe combine the results from both cases:\n1.  From odd `k`: `G` (the group itself).\n2.  From even `k`: The six cyclic subgroups `{ <x^2>, <x^4>, <x^8>, <x^16>, <x^32>, {1} }`.\n\nAll these subgroups are distinct. `G` is non-cyclic, while the others are cyclic subgroups of `<x>` with different orders (32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 respectively).\n\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is 1 (from odd k) + 6 (from even k) = 7.\n\nThe set of all power subgroups of Q_128 is:\n`{ Q_128, <x^2>, <x^4>, <x^8>, <x^16>, <x^32>, {1} }`\n\nThere are 7 such subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
