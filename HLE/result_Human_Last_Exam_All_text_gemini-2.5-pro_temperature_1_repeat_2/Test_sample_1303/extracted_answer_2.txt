The target identified by ChEMBL ID CHEMBL4803817 is the **SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro)**, a critical enzyme for viral replication. Small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with this target are typically inhibitors that bind to its active site. A list of notable small molecules with experimentally verified interactions includes:
*   **Nirmatrelvir (CHEMBL4523588):** The active ingredient in the antiviral drug Paxlovid.
*   **Ensitrelvir (CHEMBL5079007):** An antiviral drug approved in Japan (trade name Xocova).
*   **GC-376 (CHEMBL4297689):** A potent research compound and prodrug inhibitor, originally developed for a feline coronavirus.
*   **Boceprevir (CHEMBL431859):** A repurposed drug, originally approved for Hepatitis C, that also inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
*   **Ebselen (CHEMBL5983):** An organoselenium compound identified as an Mpro inhibitor in early screening studies.
*   **Lopinavir (CHEMBL1086):** An HIV protease inhibitor that was investigated for COVID-19 and shows in vitro activity against Mpro.
