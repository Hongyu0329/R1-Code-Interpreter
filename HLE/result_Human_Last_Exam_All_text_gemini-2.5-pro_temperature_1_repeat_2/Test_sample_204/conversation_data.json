    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Vector Field\n\nThe vector field $\\vec{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is defined as:\n$n_x = \\sin(G) \\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G) \\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nThis is a unit vector field, as $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. It represents a map from the 3D space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to the surface of a unit sphere, $S^2$. The mapping is defined by two angle functions, $G$ and $f$, which correspond to the polar angle ($\\theta$) and azimuthal angle ($\\phi$) on the sphere $S^2$, respectively.\n\n*   **Azimuthal angle:** $\\phi = f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)$. In cylindrical coordinates $(\\rho, \\varphi, z)$, where $x = \\rho \\cos\\varphi$ and $y = \\rho \\sin\\varphi$, this is simply $\\varphi$.\n*   **Polar angle:** $\\theta = G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$, where $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2+z^2}$. In cylindrical coordinates, this is $G(\\rho, z) = \\pi \\exp(-10 \\sqrt{(\\rho^2-0.5)^2+z^2})$.\n\nThe map can be written as $\\vec{n}: (\\rho, \\varphi, z) \\mapsto (G(\\rho,z), \\varphi)$.\n\n### 2. The Hopf Charge\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological integer that characterizes how the preimages of points on the sphere $S^2$ are linked in the domain space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. For fields with axial symmetry like this one, the Hopf charge $Q_H$ can be calculated as the product of two integer winding numbers:\n\n$Q_H = k \\cdot p$\n\n*   $k$ is the **toroidal winding number**, associated with the azimuthal angle $\\varphi$.\n*   $p$ is the **poloidal winding number**, associated with the profile function for the polar angle, $G(\\rho, z)$.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Toroidal Winding Number (k)\n\nThe azimuthal part of the map is $\\varphi \\mapsto f = \\varphi$. As one goes around the $z$-axis once in the domain space (from $\\varphi=0$ to $\\varphi=2\\pi$), the azimuthal angle $f$ on the target sphere also goes around once. The winding number is the number of times the image wraps around the equator for each wrap in the domain.\nHere, the mapping is identity, so the winding number is $k=1$.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Poloidal Winding Number (p)\n\nThe poloidal winding number $p$ is the degree of the map defined by the function $\\theta = G(\\rho, z)$. This function maps the 2D half-plane $(\\rho, z)$ (where $\\rho \\ge 0$) to the range of the polar angle $[0, \\pi]$.\n\nTo calculate this degree, we can compactify the domain and the target space.\n*   The domain is the half-plane $(\\rho, z)$, with $\\rho \\ge 0$. Its one-point compactification is topologically a 2-sphere, $S^2$.\n*   The target for $\\theta$ is the interval $[0, \\pi]$. We can think of this as defining a point on a sphere via the polar angle.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of $G(\\rho, z)$:\n*   **At infinity:** As $\\rho \\to \\infty$ or $|z| \\to \\infty$, $r_2 \\to \\infty$. This makes $G = \\pi \\exp(-\\infty) \\to 0$. So, the entire boundary at infinity of the $(\\rho,z)$ half-plane is mapped to $\\theta=0$ (the North Pole of the target sphere).\n*   **At the center of the structure:** The function $G$ reaches its maximum value when $r_2$ is minimum. The minimum of $r_2 = \\sqrt{(\\rho^2-0.5)^2+z^2}$ is $r_2=0$, which occurs at $z=0$ and $\\rho^2=0.5$ (i.e., $\\rho = 1/\\sqrt{2}$). At this point, $G = \\pi \\exp(0) = \\pi$. This point is mapped to $\\theta=\\pi$ (the South Pole of the target sphere).\n\nThe map from the $(\\rho, z)$ plane to the target sphere can be characterized by a new set of coordinates for the plane. Let $u = \\rho^2-0.5$ and $v=z$. The domain is now the $(u,v)$ plane (with the constraint that $u \\ge -0.5$).\n*   The point $(u,v)=(0,0)$ corresponds to the center of the structure, where $G=\\pi$.\n*   Points at infinity in the $(u,v)$ plane correspond to $G=0$.\n\nWe have a map from a plane (topologically $S^2$) to a sphere $S^2$, where the origin of the plane maps to the South Pole and the point at infinity maps to the North Pole. The degree of such a map, $p$, is given by the integral of its Jacobian, normalized by the area of the sphere.\n\n$p = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} d(\\cos G) \\wedge d\\alpha$\n\nwhere $\\alpha = \\operatorname{atan2}(v, u)$ is the polar angle in the $(u,v)$ plane. A detailed calculation of this integral shows:\n\nLet $R = \\sqrt{u^2+v^2}$. The integrand (the Jacobian determinant) is:\n$J \\, du \\wedge dv = -10\\pi e^{-10R}\\sin(\\pi e^{-10R}) \\frac{1}{R} \\, du \\wedge dv$\n\nIntegrating over the plane in polar coordinates $(R, \\alpha)$:\n$p = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\alpha \\int_0^\\infty \\left( -10\\pi e^{-10R}\\sin(\\pi e^{-10R}) \\frac{1}{R} \\right) R \\, dR$\n$p = \\frac{2\\pi}{4\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty -10\\pi e^{-10R}\\sin(\\pi e^{-10R}) \\, dR$\n\nLet $s = \\pi e^{-10R}$. Then $ds = -10\\pi e^{-10R} dR$. The integration limits change: $R=0 \\implies s=\\pi$, and $R=\\infty \\implies s=0$.\n$p = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_\\pi^0 \\sin(s) \\, ds = \\frac{1}{2} [-\\cos(s)]_\\pi^0 = \\frac{1}{2} (-\\cos(0) - (-\\cos(\\pi))) = \\frac{1}{2} (-1 - (-(-1))) = \\frac{1}{2} (-1-1) = -1$.\n\nWait, let's re-do the integral evaluation:\n$p = \\frac{1}{2} [-\\cos(s)]_\\pi^0 = -\\frac{1}{2} [\\cos(s)]_\\pi^0 = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\cos(0) - \\cos(\\pi)) = -\\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = -\\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$.\n\nLet's re-check the Jacobian calculation.\n$d(\\cos G) = \\frac{d(\\cos G)}{dR} dR = -\\sin G \\frac{dG}{dR} dR = -\\sin G (\\pi e^{-10R}(-10)) dR = 10\\pi e^{-10R}\\sin(G) dR$.\n$d(\\cos G) \\wedge d\\alpha = (10\\pi e^{-10R}\\sin(G) dR) \\wedge d\\alpha$.\nUsing $dR \\wedge d\\alpha = \\frac{1}{R} du \\wedge dv$:\nThe integrand is $10\\pi e^{-10R}\\sin(G) \\frac{1}{R}$.\nThe sign was positive. Let's re-evaluate the integral with the positive sign.\n\n$p = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\pi \\sin(s) \\, (- \\frac{ds}{\\pi}) \\frac{1}{\\pi} = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_\\pi^0 \\sin(s) ds = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\sin(s) ds = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} [-\\cos s]_0^\\pi = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}(-\\cos\\pi - (-\\cos 0)) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}(1+1) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}$. This is not an integer.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the integral substitution.\n$p = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\infty 10\\pi e^{-10R}\\sin(\\pi e^{-10R}) dR$\nLet $s = \\pi e^{-10R}$. $ds = -10\\pi e^{-10R} dR$.\n$p = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_\\pi^0 \\sin(s) (-ds) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\pi \\sin(s) ds = \\frac{1}{2}[-\\cos(s)]_0^\\pi = \\frac{1}{2}[-(\\cos(\\pi)) - (-\\cos(0))] = \\frac{1}{2}[-(-1) - (-1)] = \\frac{1}{2}[1+1] = 1$.\n\nSo the poloidal winding number is $p=1$.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\n\nThe Hopf charge is the product of the winding numbers.\n$Q_H = k \\cdot p = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nThis can also be confirmed by calculating the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points on the sphere. For example, the preimage of the South Pole ($\\theta=\\pi$) is the circle $\\rho=1/\\sqrt{2}, z=0$. The preimage of a point on the equator is a closed loop in a plane of constant $\\varphi$ that encircles the South Pole's preimage circle. These two curves form a single link, so their linking number is 1 (or -1, depending on orientation conventions). Our detailed calculation gives a positive sign.\n\nFinal calculation: $Q_H = k \\cdot p = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\n<<<1>>>"
