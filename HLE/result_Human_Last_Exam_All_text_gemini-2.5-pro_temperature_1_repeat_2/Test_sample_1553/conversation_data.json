    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Book:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Subject:** The main character of the novel.\n*   **Action:** Marriage.\n*   **Objective:** Find the name of the character the main character marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe protagonist and main character of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who has been resurrected in the far future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the plot regarding the main character's relationships.**\nAdam Zamoyski finds himself in a vastly advanced post-human civilization where he is an anomaly, a \"stahs\" (a resurrected historical standard human). He is essentially helpless and requires a powerful guardian or patron to survive and navigate this new reality.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the character with whom Adam forms a binding union.**\nThroughout the story, Adam's primary guide, protector, and benefactor is a powerful, high-status individual named Angelika. Their relationship is complex and central to the plot.\n\n**Step 5: Determine if this union constitutes a \"marriage\".**\nIn the context of this far-future society, traditional human concepts like marriage have evolved or been replaced. However, to secure his legal standing, existence, and safety, Adam Zamoyski enters into a formal, binding contract and union with Angelika. She becomes his legal guardian and partner. This is the closest equivalent to a marriage in the novel and is the pivotal partnership that defines his new life. There is no other character with whom he forms such a relationship.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The term \"marriage\" must be understood within the specific, futuristic context of the novel's world. It's not a traditional romantic marriage but a formal, socio-legal union that binds the two characters.\n*   The power dynamic is extremely unequal. Angelika is an immensely powerful post-human entity, and Adam is entirely dependent on her.\n*   Despite the nuances, in the narrative framework, Angelika is the character who fills the role of Adam's partner/spouse.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the plot of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries (or enters into a marriage-like binding union with) the character named Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
