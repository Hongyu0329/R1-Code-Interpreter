    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Object and its Orientation**\nThe object is a regular icosahedron, which is a Platonic solid with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 identical edges, and 12 vertices.\nThe tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of its 20 triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base. A key property of the icosahedron is that it has a center of symmetry. For every face, there is an opposite, parallel face. Therefore, if the icosahedron stands on a face, its top face is also a horizontal triangle, parallel to the base.\n\n**Step 2: Determining the Water Level**\nThe tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron. The surface of a static liquid under gravity is always a horizontal plane.\nBecause the icosahedron has a center of symmetry, any plane passing through its center divides the solid into two parts of equal volume.\nThe horizontal plane that lies exactly halfway between the top and bottom faces passes through the icosahedron's center. Therefore, this specific horizontal plane must be the surface of the water.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Cross-Section**\nThe question asks for the shape of the water surface. This is equivalent to asking for the shape of the cross-section created by slicing the icosahedron with the horizontal mid-plane described in Step 2.\n\n**Step 4: Visualizing the Icosahedron's Structure in this Orientation**\nWhen an icosahedron is oriented on a face, its 12 vertices are arranged in four distinct horizontal layers:\n1.  **Bottom Layer:** 3 vertices forming the triangular base.\n2.  **Lower-Middle Layer:** 3 vertices forming a larger triangle, slightly above the base.\n3.  **Upper-Middle Layer:** 3 vertices forming another large triangle, which is rotated by 60 degrees relative to the lower-middle triangle.\n4.  **Top Layer:** 3 vertices forming the top triangular face.\n\nThe horizontal mid-plane (the water surface) lies exactly between the lower-middle and upper-middle layers of vertices.\n\n**Step 5: Identifying the Intersected Edges**\nSince the mid-plane lies between the two middle layers of vertices, it does not pass through any vertex. Instead, it must cut through the edges that connect the vertices of the lower-middle layer to the vertices of the upper-middle layer.\nThere are exactly six such edges connecting these two layers.\n\n**Step 6: Determining the Shape of the Cross-Section**\nThe water surface is a polygon whose vertices are the points where the mid-plane intersects these six edges.\n*   Because the plane is exactly halfway between the two layers of vertices it connects, it cuts each of the six edges precisely at its midpoint.\n*   The icosahedron, even in this orientation, possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a 3-fold rotational symmetry axis passing vertically through the centers of the top and bottom faces. It also has a center of inversion.\n*   This symmetry dictates that the six edges being cut are all identical in length and have the same inclination with respect to the horizontal plane.\n*   Consequently, the six intersection points (the vertices of the water surface polygon) are all equidistant from the central vertical axis and are spaced equally around it.\n*   A six-sided polygon whose vertices are arranged in this symmetric fashion is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen an icosahedron standing on a face is half-filled with water, the water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron. This plane intersects six of the icosahedron's edges, forming a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
