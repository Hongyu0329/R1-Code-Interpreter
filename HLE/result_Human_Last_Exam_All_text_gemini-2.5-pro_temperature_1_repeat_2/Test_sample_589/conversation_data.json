    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe query asks for a specific Hollywood feature film with the following key elements:\n1.  **Production:** A Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio.\n2.  **Character:** A teenager.\n3.  **Object:** A pink bike.\n4.  **Action:** The teenager rides the pink bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Elements**\n*   **\"Teenager on a pink bike\":** This is a very specific visual. The pink color is a significant detail that narrows down the possibilities. This combination often suggests a quirky, independent, or somewhat awkward female character, common in coming-of-age or comedy films.\n*   **\"Pedals directly toward an oncoming car\":** This describes a specific moment of confrontation or a near-accident. It's not a chase scene, but a direct, head-on approach. This could be interpreted as a game of \"chicken,\" obliviousness, or defiance.\n*   **\"Hollywood feature film\" and \"major film studio\":** This eliminates obscure independent films or foreign films. The movie should have had a relatively wide release and backing from a well-known production or distribution company (e.g., Fox Searchlight, Paramount, Universal, etc.).\n\n**Step 3: Brainstorm and Identify Potential Films**\nBased on the combination of a quirky teenager, a distinctive bike, and a memorable scene involving a vehicle, the film that immediately comes to mind is *Napoleon Dynamite*.\n\n**Step 4: Verify if *Napoleon Dynamite* Fits All the Criteria**\n1.  **Production:** Was *Napoleon Dynamite* (2004) a Hollywood feature film from a major studio?\n    *   Yes. While it has an independent film aesthetic, it was produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures (a subsidiary of 20th Century Fox at the time), MTV Films, and Paramount Pictures. These are all major entities in Hollywood. The film received a wide theatrical release and was a commercial success.\n2.  **Character:** Is there a teenager who fits the description?\n    *   Yes. The character is **Deb Bradshaw**, a classmate of Napoleon's. She is portrayed as a high school student, making her a teenager.\n3.  **Object:** Does she ride a pink bike?\n    *   Yes. Deb is famously seen riding a pink Huffy bicycle.\n4.  **Action:** Is there a scene where she pedals toward an oncoming car?\n    *   Yes. There is a specific scene where Napoleon is riding in his brother Kip's orange van. As they drive down a road, they see Deb approaching from the opposite direction on her pink bike. She pedals straight toward them without wavering, forcing Kip to swerve the van off the road at the last second to avoid a collision. This perfectly matches the description.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nAll elements of the question—a teenager (Deb), a pink bike, the action of riding directly at an oncoming vehicle (Kip's van), and the film's status as a major studio-backed Hollywood feature—are met by the movie *Napoleon Dynamite*. The scene is iconic and one of the most memorable introductions for the character of Deb.\n\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
