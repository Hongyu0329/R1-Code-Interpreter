The local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered to be radial. Its direction is described by the Parker spiral, typically at a ~45-degree angle to the radial direction. Using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction is a justified approximation because the super-Alfv√©nic solar wind flows nearly radially, making the radial direction the dominant direction of transport past the spacecraft (Taylor's hypothesis). Since the true propagation direction of the field-aligned AIC wave has a significant projection onto the radial direction, the sign of the calculated helicity (which defines the polarization) is preserved, even if its magnitude is reduced.
