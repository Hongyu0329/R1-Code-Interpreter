    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to find the most \"economical\" representation of this number. The value of a Hackenbush game is a surreal number, and for finite games, these are dyadic rationals (numbers of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$).\n\nA number's representation is built from the games for simpler numbers, specifically integers and unit fractions of the form $\\pm \\frac{1}{2^k}$. The total number of pieces is the sum of pieces of these component games.\n\n**Step 1: Define the building blocks and their cost (number of pieces)**\n\nThe standard, most economical game constructions for the basic values are:\n*   **Integer n > 0:** A single stalk of $n$ red edges. Number of pieces = $n$.\n*   **Integer n < 0:** A single stalk of $|n|$ blue edges. Number of pieces = $|n|$.\n*   **Fraction $\\frac{1}{2^k}$ (for k > 0):** A \"flower\" consisting of one red stalk and $k$ blue \"petals\" branching from its top. The value of this game is $\\{0 | \\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}\\} = \\frac{1}{2^k}$. The number of pieces is $1 (\\text{red}) + k (\\text{blue}) = k+1$.\n*   **Fraction $-\\frac{1}{2^k}$ (for k > 0):** The opposite game, with colors reversed. One blue stalk and $k$ red petals. The number of pieces is $1 (\\text{blue}) + k (\\text{red}) = k+1$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the standard representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$**\n\nFirst, we write $\\frac{13}{16}$ using its binary expansion.\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8 + 4 + 1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} $$\nIn binary, this is $0.1101_2$. The game for $\\frac{13}{16}$ can be constructed as a disjoint sum of the games for $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nLet's calculate the number of pieces for this representation:\n*   Game for $\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2^1}$: Here $k=1$. Cost = $k+1 = 1+1 = 2$ pieces.\n*   Game for $\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2^2}$: Here $k=2$. Cost = $k+1 = 2+1 = 3$ pieces.\n*   Game for $\\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2^4}$: Here $k=4$. Cost = $k+1 = 4+1 = 5$ pieces.\n\nThe total number of pieces for this representation is the sum of the costs:\nTotal pieces = $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$.\n\n**Step 3: Search for a more economical representation**\n\nRepresentations involving subtraction can sometimes be more economical. This corresponds to using a signed-digit binary representation, specifically the Non-Adjacent Form (NAF), which is known to be optimal in minimizing the number of non-zero digits. The key idea is that a run of `1`s in binary, such as $2^{-m} + 2^{-(m+1)} + ... + 2^{-(m+k-1)}$, can be replaced by $2^{-(m-1)} - 2^{-(m+k-1)}$. This often reduces the \"cost\".\n\nThe binary representation of our number is $0.1101_2$. It contains a run of two `1`s at the beginning: $0.11_2$.\nThe block $0.11_2 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nUsing the subtraction principle, we can write $\\frac{3}{4} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe cost for $\\frac{3}{4}$ as $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}$ is $2+3=5$ pieces.\nThe cost for $\\frac{3}{4}$ as $1-\\frac{1}{4}$ is Cost(1) + Cost($-\\frac{1}{4}$).\n*   Cost(1): 1 piece (a single red edge).\n*   Cost($-\\frac{1}{4}$): $k=2$. Cost = $2+1 = 3$ pieces.\nTotal cost for $1-\\frac{1}{4}$ is $1+3=4$ pieces. This is more economical.\n\nNow, we apply this to the full number $\\frac{13}{16}$:\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = ( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} ) + \\frac{1}{16} $$\nReplace the part in the parenthesis with its more economical form:\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = ( 1 - \\frac{1}{4} ) + \\frac{1}{16} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} $$\nThis representation corresponds to a disjoint union of the games for $1$, $-\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces for the optimal representation**\n\n*   Game for $1$: 1 piece (1 red edge).\n*   Game for $-\\frac{1}{4} = -\\frac{1}{2^2}$: Here $k=2$. Cost = $k+1 = 2+1=3$ pieces (1 blue, 2 red).\n*   Game for $\\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2^4}$: Here $k=4$. Cost = $k+1 = 4+1=5$ pieces (1 red, 4 blue).\n\nThe total number of pieces for this optimal representation is:\nTotal pieces = $1 + 3 + 5 = 9$.\n\nThis representation uses fewer pieces than the standard binary expansion (9 vs 10), and is the most economical one."
