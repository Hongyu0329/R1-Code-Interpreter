The ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio depends on the application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal ratio is around 0.2 for low-temperature conditions and can be higher (up to ~0.7) for high-temperature conditions. For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS), a lower ratio in the range of 0.1 to 0.18 is ideal.
