No, it is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and Gödel's ontological proof operate in entirely separate and incompatible domains. The mathematics of quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces, operators, etc.) is designed to model the physical universe and has no tools or concepts to address the metaphysical axioms of Gödel's proof, such as "positive properties" or "necessary existence."
