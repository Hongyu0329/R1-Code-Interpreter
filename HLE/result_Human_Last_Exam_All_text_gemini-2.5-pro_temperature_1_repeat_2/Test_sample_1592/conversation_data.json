    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the location of Waskaganish.**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec, Canada. It is situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate geographic coordinates are 51.5째 N latitude and 78.8째 W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the surrounding provinces and territories.**\nWaskaganish is in Quebec. We need to consider its neighbors:\n*   **Ontario:** Lies to the west and south of Waskaganish. The border is partially a land border running south from the bottom of James Bay and partially a water border across James Bay itself.\n*   **Nunavut:** Lies to the north. Critically, the territory of Nunavut includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** Lies far to the east.\n*   **New Brunswick:** Lies far to the south-southeast.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminate distant candidates.**\nBased on a map of Canada, the borders with Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick are hundreds of kilometers away from Waskaganish. The primary candidates for the closest jurisdiction are Ontario and Nunavut.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the proximity to Ontario.**\nThe border between Quebec and Ontario runs along a meridian (a line of longitude) extending directly south from the southernmost point of James Bay. This border is approximately at longitude 79째31' W. Waskaganish is located at longitude 78째45' W. This means Waskaganish is a short distance directly east of the land border with Ontario. The shortest distance is a straight line, which is roughly 50-60 kilometers to the west/southwest.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the proximity to Nunavut.**\nThe closest parts of Nunavut to Waskaganish are the islands within James Bay. The most prominent nearby islands belonging to Nunavut are Akimiski Island, the Twin Islands (North and South), and Charlton Island.\n*   The closest of these islands is likely South Twin Island.\n*   The distance from Waskaganish across the water to the nearest point on any of these islands is significantly greater than the distance to the Ontario land border. For example, the distance to the Twin Islands is approximately 200 kilometers.\n\n**Step 6: Compare the distances and conclude.**\n*   The distance from Waskaganish to the land border of Ontario is approximately 50-60 km.\n*   The distance from Waskaganish to the nearest part of Nunavut (an island in James Bay) is approximately 200 km.\n\nTherefore, the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
