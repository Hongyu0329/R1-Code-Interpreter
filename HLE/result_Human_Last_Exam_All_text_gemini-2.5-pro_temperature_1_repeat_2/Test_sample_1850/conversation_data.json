    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the terms of the question**\nFirst, we must clarify what \"historical saints mentioned by name\" means in the context of the poem.\n*   **\"Historical\"**: This refers to figures from the Bible or early church history who are believed to have lived, as opposed to angels (Michael, Raphael), devils (Satan, Beelzebub), or figures from classical mythology.\n*   **\"Saints\"**: This refers to individuals venerated for their holiness, primarily from the Judeo-Christian tradition. This will include Old Testament patriarchs and prophets as well as New Testament figures.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: The specific name of the individual must appear in the text. Allusions to figures without naming them (e.g., \"the Virgin\" for Mary, or \"that leader\" for Joshua) do not count.\n\nIt's also important to distinguish between main protagonists and figures who are \"mentioned\". While Adam and Eve are repentant and considered saints in some traditions, they are the central subjects of the epic, not merely \"mentioned\" in a historical survey. Therefore, they are typically excluded from this type of count.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the relevant sections of the poem**\nMost of the historical figures are mentioned in Books XI and XII. In these books, the Archangel Michael reveals the future of mankind to Adam, narrating biblical history from Cain and Abel to the establishment of the early Church. We must also search the rest of the poem for other potential mentions.\n\n**Step 3: Systematically identify and list the Old Testament saints**\nBy examining the text, primarily in Books XI and XII, we can find the following Old Testament figures named:\n\n1.  **Abel**: In Book XI, Michael shows Adam the first murder, naming Abel as the victim. As the first martyr, he is considered a saint.\n2.  **Enoch**: In Book XI, after describing the wickedness of mankind, Michael speaks of \"one man\" who \"walked with God\" and was taken to Heaven without dying. This figure is explicitly named Enoch.\n3.  **Noah**: Also in Book XI, Michael narrates the story of the Great Flood and names Noah as the righteous man chosen by God to build the ark and survive.\n4.  **Abraham**: In Book XII, Michael continues the history, telling of God's covenant with a man from Ur. He is explicitly named Abraham.\n5.  **Sarah**: In the same passage in Book XII that discusses Abraham, his wife is mentioned by name as \"Sara\".\n6.  **Moses**: In Book XII, Michael recounts the story of the Exodus from Egypt, led by the great prophet who received the Law on Mount Sinai. He is named Moses.\n7.  **David**: In Book XII, Michael prophesies the line of kings that will lead to the Messiah, specifically mentioning the \"royal stock of David's line.\"\n\n**Step 4: Systematically identify and list the New Testament saints**\nWe must search the entire poem, especially the prophetic parts of Book XII and a key section in Book III, for New Testament figures.\n\n8.  **Jesus Christ (as Immanuel)**: The Messiah is a central part of Michael's prophecy in Book XII. While he is most often called \"the Son\" or \"Saviour,\" he is given the specific name **Immanuel**. As a historical figure and the ultimate \"holy one,\" he fits the criteria.\n9.  **Peter**: The apostle is explicitly named in Book III. In a satirical passage describing the Limbo of Vanity, Milton describes misguided souls who think they are heading to Heaven where \"Saint Peter at Heaven's wicket seems / To wait them with his keys...\"\n\n**Step 5: Tally the final count and note careful points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Exclusions.** Figures like Joshua and the Virgin Mary are alluded to by their roles (\"a better leader,\" \"a virgin is his mother\") but are not mentioned by their proper names. Therefore, they are not included in the count.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Adam and Eve.** As discussed in Step 1, Adam and Eve are the protagonists of the poem, not historical figures \"mentioned\" in passing. They are not included in the count.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Specific Names.** The count relies on the explicit use of a name. For Jesus, the name used is \"Immanuel.\" For Sarah, the name used is \"Sara.\" For Peter, the name used is \"Saint Peter.\"\n*   **Careful Point 4: Context.** The context of the mention does not disqualify it. Peter is mentioned in a satirical context, but he is still named.\n\nCounting the confirmed list gives us a final number.\n\n1.  Abel\n2.  Enoch\n3.  Noah\n4.  Abraham\n5.  Sarah (Sara)\n6.  Moses\n7.  David\n8.  Immanuel (Jesus)\n9.  Peter\n\nThe total number of historical saints mentioned by name is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
