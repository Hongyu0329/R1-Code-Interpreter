    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the First Cube and the Coordinate System**\nLet's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. For simplicity, we'll align its edges with the axes and place one of its vertices at the origin (0, 0, 0). Since the side length is 1, Cube A occupies the space defined by the following inequalities:\n*   $0 \\le x \\le 1$\n*   $0 \\le y \\le 1$\n*   $0 \\le z \\le 1$\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Shift and Define the Second Cube**\nThe problem states that the second cube, Cube B, is shifted relative to Cube A by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\n*   **Main Diagonal:** The main diagonal of Cube A connects opposite vertices. We can choose the diagonal connecting the origin (0, 0, 0) to the vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is $\\vec{d} = (1, 1, 1)$.\n*   **The Shift:** A \"shift by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is best interpreted as a translation by a vector where each component corresponds to the shift along that axis. This means the shift vector is $\\vec{s} = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$.\n*   **Position of Cube B:** To find the region occupied by Cube B, we translate Cube A by the vector $\\vec{s}$. A point $(x, y, z)$ is in Cube B if the point $(x - 1/2, y - 1/2, z - 1/2)$ is in Cube A. This gives us the inequalities for Cube B:\n    *   $0 \\le x - 1/2 \\le 1 \\implies 1/2 \\le x \\le 3/2$\n    *   $0 \\le y - 1/2 \\le 1 \\implies 1/2 \\le y \\le 3/2$\n    *   $0 \\le z - 1/2 \\le 1 \\implies 1/2 \\le z \\le 3/2$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Region of Intersection**\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where a point $(x, y, z)$ satisfies the inequalities for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We need to find the overlapping range for each coordinate.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:**\n    *   From Cube A: $0 \\le x \\le 1$\n    *   From Cube B: $1/2 \\le x \\le 3/2$\n    *   The intersection of these two ranges is $1/2 \\le x \\le 1$.\n\n*   **For the y-coordinate:**\n    *   From Cube A: $0 \\le y \\le 1$\n    *   From Cube B: $1/2 \\le y \\le 3/2$\n    *   The intersection is $1/2 \\le y \\le 1$.\n\n*   **For the z-coordinate:**\n    *   From Cube A: $0 \\le z \\le 1$\n    *   From Cube B: $1/2 \\le z \\le 3/2$\n    *   The intersection is $1/2 \\le z \\le 1$.\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is a shape defined by these new combined inequalities. This shape is a smaller cube.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\nThe region of intersection is defined by:\n*   $1/2 \\le x \\le 1$\n*   $1/2 \\le y \\le 1$\n*   $1/2 \\le z \\le 1$\n\nThis is a cube with a side length calculated as the difference between the upper and lower bounds for each coordinate.\n*   Side length = $1 - 1/2 = 1/2$.\n\nThe volume of a cube is given by the formula $V = (\\text{side length})^3$.\n*   Volume of intersection = $(1/2)^3 = 1/2 \\times 1/2 \\times 1/2 = 1/8$.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Interpretation of the \"Shift\"**: The most critical step is correctly interpreting \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". The standard interpretation in such problems is a translation by the vector $(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$, not a shift of distance 1/2. The latter would result in a more complex translation vector $(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}})$ and a much more complicated answer. The simpler interpretation is almost always the intended one.\n2.  **Coordinate System Setup**: Choosing a convenient coordinate system (e.g., placing the first cube at the origin) greatly simplifies the problem without changing the final result, which is a relative property.\n3.  **Intersection Logic**: The intersection of two cuboids aligned with the axes is another cuboid. Its dimensions are found by taking the intersection of the corresponding intervals for each axis.\n4.  **Final Volume Calculation**: Once the dimensions of the intersection shape are found, the volume calculation is straightforward. In this case, the intersection is a cube with side length 1/2.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe intersection is a cube with side length 1/2.\nVolume = $(1/2) \\times (1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/8$.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
