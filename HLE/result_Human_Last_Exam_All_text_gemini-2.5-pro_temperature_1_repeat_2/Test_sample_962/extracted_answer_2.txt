A two-round, tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme can be designed based on the Schnorr signature scheme, incorporating modern techniques found in protocols like FROST. The design consists of three main phases:
1.  **Distributed Key Generation (DKG):** A one-time setup using a robust protocol like Pedersen's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) to establish a single group public key `PK` and provide each of the `n` participants with a secret share `sk_i` of the master secret key. The VSS polynomial must be of degree `t-1`.
2.  **Two-Round Signing Protocol:**
    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** Each of the `t` signing participants `P_i` generates two secret random nonces and broadcasts their public commitments `(D_i, E_i)`.
    *   **Round 2 (Signature Share):** Each participant `P_i` computes a binding factor `ρ_i` (a hash of their identity, the message, and all commitments from Round 1), the group nonce `R`, and the challenge `c`. They then compute and broadcast their signature share `z_i`, which combines their nonces and their secret key share `sk_i`, bound by the challenge and binding factor.
3.  **Signature Aggregation:** An aggregator collects `t` shares `z_i`, sums them to create the final value `s`, and forms the complete signature `σ = (R, s)`, which is a standard Schnorr signature verifiable by anyone with the group's public key `PK`.
The use of two nonces and a binding factor in the two-round structure is the key innovation that prevents sophisticated attacks and allows for a tight security reduction to the Discrete Logarithm Problem.
