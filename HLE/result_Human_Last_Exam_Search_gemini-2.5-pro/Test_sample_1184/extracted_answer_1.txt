The human voltage-gated calcium channel beta-1 subunit interacts with the alpha-1 subunit primarily through a region known as the Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) located within its Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain. Key hotspot residues for this interaction include Leucine 294, Methionine 318, Arginine 307, Tyrosine 358, Valine 411, and Leucine 415. The residues critical for fine-tuning the gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit include those same interaction hotspots within the GK domain, as the binding event itself is the main modulator. Additionally, specific residues in the HOOK domain, namely Serine 193 and Threonine 205, are key sites for phosphorylation-dependent gating modulation.
