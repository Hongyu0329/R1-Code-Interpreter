    "The probability of finding a particle in a specific region of a one-dimensional box is determined by its wavefunction. For a particle in a 1D box of length 'a', the normalized wavefunction for the n=2 energy state is given by:\n\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density, P(x), is the square of the wavefunction's magnitude, |ψ₂(x)|².\n\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nTo find the probability of the particle being in the interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a, we must integrate the probability density over this interval.\n\nP = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nThe interval is very small (Δx = 0.01a) and is centered at x = 0.5a. For the n=2 state, x = a/2 is a node, a point where the wavefunction and the probability density are zero. This means the probability of finding the particle exactly at the center is zero. Since we are considering a small interval around this node, the probability is expected to be very small.\n\nGiven the small size of the interval, we can use an approximation. Let's define a new variable δx = x - a/2. The integration is then performed from -0.005a to +0.005a. The term sin(2πx/a) becomes sin(π + 2πδx/a), which simplifies to -sin(2πδx/a). Squaring this gives sin²(2πδx/a).\n\nFor a very small argument θ, sin(θ) ≈ θ. Therefore, we can approximate sin²(2πδx/a) ≈ (2πδx/a)².\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nP ≈ ∫ [from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * (2πδx/a)² d(δx)\n\nP ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫ [from -0.005a to +0.005a] (δx)² d(δx)\n\nSolving this integral gives:\n\nP ≈ (8π²/a³) * [(δx)³/3] evaluated from -0.005a to 0.005a\n\nP ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]\n\nP ≈ (16π²/3a³) * (0.005a)³\n\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\n\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\nP ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
