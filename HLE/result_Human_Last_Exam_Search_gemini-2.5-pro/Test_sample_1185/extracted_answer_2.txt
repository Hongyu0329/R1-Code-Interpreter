There is no single number of stable reduction types for genus 2 curves; it depends on the classification scheme. There are 7 coarse geometric types, over 100 types in the detailed Namikawa-Ueno classification for unmarked curves, and 54 types for the stable marked reduction in residue characteristic 2.
