    "Based on the principles of knobs-into-holes interactions and packing efficiency, the given protein coiled-coil sequence is most likely to form a trimer.\n\n### Analysis of the Protein Sequence\n\nThe provided sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\n\nTo determine the oligomeric state, we first need to identify the heptad repeat, a characteristic seven-amino-acid pattern `(abcdefg)n` found in coiled-coils. In this repeat, the `a` and `d` positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues that form the core of the structure, while positions `e` and `g` are often charged residues that can form stabilizing salt bridges.\n\nThe hydrophobic residues in the sequence are Isoleucine (I), Alanine (A), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W). By aligning the sequence, we can identify a repeating pattern. The most plausible heptad register is:\n\n`g a b c d e f`\n`G E **I** A Q S **L**`\n`K E **I** A K S **L**`\n`K E **I** A W S **L**`\n`K E **I** A Q S **L**`\n\nThis alignment reveals four consecutive heptad repeats with the following residues at the core `a` and `d` positions:\n\n*   **Heptad 1:** a = I, d = L\n*   **Heptad 2:** a = I, d = L\n*   **Heptad 3:** a = I, d = L\n*   **Heptad 4:** a = I, d = L\n\nThis results in a consistent `(a=I, d=L)` pattern throughout the core of the coiled-coil. The bulky hydrophobic Tryptophan (W) residue is located at a `c` position, which is solvent-exposed and thus not part of the hydrophobic core that dictates the oligomeric state.\n\n### Knobs-into-Holes Packing and Oligomeric State\n\nThe specific amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions are strong determinants of the oligomeric state due to the precise packing requirements of their side chains (the \"knobs\") into the spaces created by surrounding residues on the adjacent helices (the \"holes\").\n\n*   **Dimers:** Typically form when Leucine (L) is at the `d` position and Isoleucine (I) is at the `a` position (`a=I, d=L`). This arrangement allows for optimal packing in a two-stranded structure.\n*   **Trimers:** Are favored when Isoleucine (I) is present at both the `a` and `d` positions (`a=I, d=I`). The beta-branched side chain of Isoleucine at the `d` position creates steric hindrance in a dimer, making the trimeric arrangement more favorable. A more even distribution of Isoleucine at both core positions also promotes trimer formation.\n*   **Tetramers:** Are often formed with Leucine (L) at the `a` position and Isoleucine (I) at the `d` position (`a=L, d=I`).\n\n### Conclusion for the Given Sequence\n\nThe sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` has a consistent pattern of **Isoleucine (I) at the `a` position and Leucine (L) at the `d` position**. Based on established rules derived from experimental studies, this specific arrangement strongly favors the formation of a **dimeric coiled-coil**. The Î²-branched nature of isoleucine fits well at the `a` position, while the flexible side chain of leucine packs efficiently at the `d` position within a dimeric structure.\n\nHowever, the question implies a single correct answer among the choices, and there might be subtle influences. The presence of a K at position 'a' in the second heptad (`EIAKSLK`) is unusual as K is charged. While typically disruptive, context can alter outcomes.\n\nDespite this, the overwhelming signal from the three canonical `(a=I, d=L)` heptads points towards a dimer. Let's re-evaluate the premise. Is there any reason this might not be a dimer? The presence of 'W' at a solvent-exposed position ('c') is noted but shouldn't dictate the core packing. The 'K' at an 'a' position is more problematic. If that position is considered non-canonical, it might disrupt a uniform dimeric structure.\n\nLet's reconsider the established rules.\n*   **Dimer**: I at `a`, L at `d`.\n*   **Trimer**: I at `a`, I at `d`.\n*   **Tetramer**: L at `a`, I at `d`.\n\nThe sequence has `I` at `a` and `L` at `d` for three out of four repeats. The GCN4 leucine zipper, a classic dimer, has this `I` at `a` and `L` at `d` pattern. While some studies suggest `I` at `a` can favor trimers, this is typically when `d` is also `I` or another residue that fits better in a trimeric core. With `L` consistently at `d`, the dimeric state is the most stable and well-documented conformation.\n\nTherefore, based on the dominant `(a=I, d=L)` pattern and the principles of knobs-into-holes packing, the protein is expected to form a dimer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
