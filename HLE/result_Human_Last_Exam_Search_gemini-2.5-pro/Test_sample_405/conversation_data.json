    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors: white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid. It can appear yellowish when impure, which is why it is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus; however, this is not a distinct allotrope.\n\nRed phosphorus is another well-known allotrope and, as its name suggests, is red. A variation known as violet phosphorus, or Hittorf's phosphorus, is a distinct crystalline form with a purple or violet hue.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most thermodynamically stable form and has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite.\n\nMore recently, a two-dimensional allotrope called blue phosphorus was synthesized. As the name implies, this allotrope is blue.\n\nTherefore, the pure allotropes of phosphorus exhibit a palette of five different colors.\n\n<<<5>>>"
