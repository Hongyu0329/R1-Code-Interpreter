    "The two plane quadrics given by the equations `164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0` and `864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0` have four real intersection points.\n\nThe type of conic section represented by an equation of the form `Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0` can be determined by the sign of the discriminant, `B^2 - 4AC`.\n\nFor the first equation:\n`A = 164`, `B = -216`, `C = 72`\n`B^2 - 4AC = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576`\nSince the discriminant is negative, the first quadric is an ellipse.\n\nFor the second equation:\n`A = 864`, `B = -1056`, `C = 324`\n`B^2 - 4AC = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608`\nSince the discriminant is again negative, the second quadric is also an ellipse.\n\nTwo distinct ellipses can intersect at a maximum of four points. To find the exact number of intersection points for these specific ellipses, one can solve the system of two equations. This process typically involves eliminating one variable to obtain a single quartic equation in the other variable. A quartic equation can have up to four real roots, corresponding to the intersection points.\n\nBy using a graphical calculator to plot both equations, the two ellipses are shown to intersect at four distinct points.\n\n<<<4>>>"
