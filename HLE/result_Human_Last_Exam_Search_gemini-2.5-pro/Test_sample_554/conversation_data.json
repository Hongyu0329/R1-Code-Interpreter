    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms. This is based on a known nanocar structure with the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. In a perfluorinated version of this molecule, all 34 hydrogen atoms would be replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nNanother cars are molecules designed to resemble macroscopic cars, typically featuring a chassis and four wheels. The wheels are often fullerene (C₆₀) molecules. Different designs of nanocars exist with varying chemical formulas. For example, another reported nanocar has the formula C₄₃₀H₂₇₄O. If this specific nanocar were to be perfluorinated, it would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe term \"perfluoro\" indicates that all hydrogens on the carbon skeleton of the molecule have been replaced with fluorine. Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar is determined by the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar structure.\n\n<<<34>>>"
