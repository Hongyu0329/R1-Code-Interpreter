    "The fundamental difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the **placement of the hip**.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso. This means that during a cambré derrière, the hips should remain aligned and level, with the backbend originating from the upper and middle spine. The goal is to create a graceful and controlled arch without displacing the hips. This technique prioritizes a clean and precise line, with the power and flexibility coming from the back itself, while the pelvis provides a stable base.\n\nThe Balanchine method, in contrast, often encourages a more dynamic and less rigid use of the torso and hips to create dramatic lines and facilitate speed. A well-known characteristic of the Balanchine style is the \"open hip\" in arabesques, where the hip of the working leg is lifted to achieve a higher extension. This principle of using the hip to accentuate the line is also applied to the cambré derrière. In the Balanchine style, a dancer might push the hips forward to achieve a deeper and more expansive backbend. This approach aligns with the method's overall aesthetic of speed, athleticism, and exaggerated, fluid movements.\n\nTherefore, while other elements like arm and head placement might show subtle variations, the most significant and defining technical difference in the execution of a cambré derrière between the two methods is the intentional use and placement of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
