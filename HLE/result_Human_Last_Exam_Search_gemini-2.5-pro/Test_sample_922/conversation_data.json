    "The integer that completes the sequence is **427575**.\n\nThis sequence consists of the number of projectively unique polyhedra in R^3, ordered by the number of vertices. The six known values correspond to polyhedra with 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 vertices. As of August 2022, the only other known value was for polyhedra with 10 vertices.\n\nThe known sequence is:\n*   4 vertices: 24,663\n*   5 vertices: 35,005\n*   6 vertices: 119,261\n*   7 vertices: 196,219\n*   8 vertices: 211,770\n*   9 vertices: 227,296\n*   10 vertices: 427,575\n\n<<<427575>>>"
