    "The number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)` is 32.\n\nThis curve is a type of Lissajous curve. For a Lissajous curve given by the equations `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`, where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, the number of self-intersection points can be determined by a specific formula. The form of this curve, with a cosine function for the x-component and a sine function for the y-component, corresponds to a generic Lissajous curve, which has a phase difference of Ï€/2 between the two oscillations.\n\nThe applicable formula for the number of self-intersections in this case is `(a - 1)(b - 1)`.\n\nGiven the curve `(cos(9t), sin(5t))`, we have:\n*   a = 9\n*   b = 5\n\nThe numbers 9 and 5 are coprime. Applying the formula, we calculate the number of self-intersection points:\n(9 - 1) * (5 - 1) = 8 * 4 = 32.\n\nTherefore, the curve has 32 points where it intersects itself.\n\n<<<32>>>"
