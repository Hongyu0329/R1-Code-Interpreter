    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's fate is sealed in connection with a bus is the 2006 drama *Babel*.\n\nDirected by Alejandro González Iñárritu, *Babel* was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film weaves together multiple storylines that are connected by a single tragic event.\n\nIn one of the central narratives, an American couple, Richard (played by Brad Pitt) and Susan (played by Cate Blanchett), are traveling on a tourist bus in a remote part of Morocco. Their journey takes a devastating turn when Susan is struck by a bullet fired from a rifle by two young Moroccan boys who are carelessly testing its range. This event sets off a chain reaction of consequences that affects all the characters in the film's interconnected stories.\n\nWhile a character's fate is tragically altered on the bus, the premise that a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding does not occur in the film's script. The shooting is depicted as a random and unforeseen act of recklessness, and the characters' presence on the bus is not determined by a specific polite phrase.\n\n<<<Babel>>>"
