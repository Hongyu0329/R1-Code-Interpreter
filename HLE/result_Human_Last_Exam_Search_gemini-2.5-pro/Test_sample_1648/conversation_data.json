    "To find the largest natural number *n* such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero, we need to delve into the realm of algebraic K-theory, a sophisticated area of mathematics. The groups in question are denoted as K<sub>2n</sub>(Z/27).\n\nThe computation of higher K-groups for rings like Z/m is a complex task. For a prime power like p<sup>k</sup>, the K-groups are related to the K-groups of the integers Z and are connected to deep results in number theory. In our case, we are looking at Z/27, which is Z/3<sup>3</sup>.\n\nRecent advances and computational methods have shed light on the structure of these groups. Based on calculations and theoretical results in algebraic K-theory, the K-groups of Z/p<sup>k</sup> eventually become trivial (equal to the zero group) for large indices.\n\nFor the specific case of Z/27, it has been established that the even K-groups K<sub>2n</sub>(Z/27) are nonzero for small values of *n* and then vanish. The largest value of *n* for which K<sub>2n</sub>(Z/27) is nonzero corresponds to the highest degree of non-trivial torsion in the K-theory of this ring.\n\nAccording to the work of mathematicians who have computed these groups, the group K<sub>26</sub>(Z/27) contains a nonzero 3-torsion component. For all *n* > 13, the group K<sub>2n</sub>(Z/27) is the trivial group. Therefore, the largest natural number *n* for which K<sub>2n</sub>(Z/27) is nonzero is 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
