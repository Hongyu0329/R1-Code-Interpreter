    "To solve the problem, we first need to find the number of stable equilibria, denoted by $m$, for the given differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\nAn equilibrium point is a value of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We set $f(x)$ to zero to find the equilibrium points:\n$$\n-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n$$\n$$\n-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-x(x - 1)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe equilibrium points are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nTo determine the stability of these equilibrium points, we can use the first derivative test. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$\nf'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1\n$$\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n*   For $x = 0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\n*   For $x = 1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive for this point.\n\nWhen the derivative is zero, we must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ around the equilibrium point to determine its stability.\n*   For a point slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$):\n    $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9 - 1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.009 < 0$.\n    Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution moves away from $x=1$ to the left.\n*   For a point slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$):\n    $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1 - 1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -0.011 < 0$.\n    Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution moves toward $x=1$ from the right.\n\nBecause solutions starting from one side of $x=1$ move away from it, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x = 0$. This means the number of stable equilibria is $m = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$. Substituting the value of $m$:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
