    "An elegant and memory-efficient solution in C avoids storing both strings in memory simultaneously. Since the strings must be compared character by character, we are required to store the first string to have it available for comparison against the second. However, the second string can be read from the input stream one character at a time and compared on-the-fly with the corresponding character from the stored first string. This approach eliminates the need for a second buffer, significantly reducing memory consumption.\n\nThe most memory-efficient implementation would use the smallest possible data types for variables. The buffer for the first string needs to accommodate up to 100 characters. For loop counters and length storage, an `unsigned char` is sufficient, as the length will not exceed 100. The variable used to read from the input stream with `getchar()` must be an `int` to properly handle the `EOF` (End-Of-File) value.\n\nHere is the C program that implements this memory-efficient strategy:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program compares two strings of the same length lexicographically,\n * ignoring the case of the letters. It is optimized for memory efficiency.\n * \n * The strategy is to read the first string into a buffer. Then, the second\n * string is read character by character and immediately compared with the\n * corresponding character in the buffer. This avoids allocating memory\n * for the second string.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Buffer to store the first string.\n    // The maximum string length is 100, so an array of 100 chars is sufficient.\n    char s1[100]; // 100 bytes\n\n    // Variable to hold characters from input. \n    // It must be an 'int' to correctly handle the EOF value returned by getchar().\n    int c; // 4 bytes (on most common 32/64-bit systems)\n\n    // Index for iterating. 'unsigned char' is the smallest data type for an\n    // integer and is sufficient since the string length is at most 100.\n    unsigned char i = 0; // 1 byte\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input until a newline is found.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n') {\n        s1[i++] = (char)c;\n    }\n    \n    // The final value of 'i' represents the length of the string.\n    // We store this length in a separate variable.\n    unsigned char len = i; // 1 byte\n\n    // Reset the index to 0 to iterate through the second string.\n    i = 0; \n\n    // Read the second string character by character and compare with the first.\n    // The problem guarantees the strings are of the same length, so we loop 'len' times.\n    while (i < len) {\n        c = getchar(); // Read a character from the second string.\n\n        // Perform a case-insensitive comparison of the characters.\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\"); // The first string is lexicographically smaller.\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(c)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\"); // The first string is lexicographically larger.\n            return 0;\n        }\n        \n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n    \n    // If the loop finishes, all characters were equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory used for variables (`m`) is the sum of the sizes of all variables declared within the `main` function:\n*   `char s1[100]`: 100 * `sizeof(char)` = 100 * 1 = 100 bytes.\n*   `int c`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes (on typical competitive programming platforms).\n*   `unsigned char i`: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = 1 byte.\n*   `unsigned char len`: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = 1 byte.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 100 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
