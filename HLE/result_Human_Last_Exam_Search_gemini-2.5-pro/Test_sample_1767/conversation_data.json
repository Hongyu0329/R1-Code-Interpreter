    "When two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the concept of a single Chern number for the entire junction is not the most physically relevant description. Instead, the topological properties of the junction are determined by the difference in the Chern numbers of the two insulators.\n\nAccording to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the number of chiral edge states at the interface between two topologically distinct regions is given by the difference in their Chern numbers. In this case, both Chern insulators have a Chern number of C=1.\n\nTherefore, the number of chiral edge states at the junction is |1 - 1| = 0.\n\nThis means that for a junction between two Chern insulators with the same Chern number, there are no topologically protected chiral edge states at the interface. The system as a whole, being comprised of two regions with Chern number 1, will still exhibit chiral edge states on its outer boundaries, but not at the junction between them.\n\nIn essence, because the two materials are topologically equivalent in terms of their Chern number, their junction does not represent a boundary between topologically distinct phases, and thus no new edge states are formed at the interface.\n\n<<<0>>>"
