    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology applicable to describing changes in the laws of nature, including the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nThe specific terminology he developed is the doctrine of **\"seminal reasons\"** (in Latin, *rationes seminales*).\n\n### Explanation of Seminal Reasons\n\nAugustine, influenced by earlier philosophical thought, integrated the concept of seminal reasons into Christian theology to explain how new things or miraculous events could occur after God's initial six-day creation. He posited that God, at the beginning of creation, embedded invisible, potential \"seeds\" or \"principles\" into the fabric of the natural world. These seminal reasons contain the latent potential for all future development, which unfolds over time under the right conditions and through divine providence.\n\n### Application to Miracles and the Virgin Birth\n\nThis framework allowed Augustine to argue that miracles are not violations of the natural order, but rather the actualization of these hidden potentialities that are beyond our ordinary understanding of nature. An event appears miraculous to us only because we are not aware of the seminal reason that God has willed to activate at a particular moment.\n\nRegarding the virgin birth, Augustine saw it as a unique miracle signifying a spiritual truth about the Church. While he affirmed Mary's perpetual virginity, his theory of seminal reasons provided a metaphysical framework to understand how Christ's human body could be formed in a way that was unique, without a human father, yet still part of the created order as willed by God. The virgin birth was not \"contrary to nature,\" but \"contrary to what we know as nature.\"\n\n### Application to the Fall\n\nAugustine also applied a related concept of \"seminal identity\" to explain the consequences of the Fall. He argued that all of humanity was \"seminally present in the loins of Adam.\" Therefore, when Adam sinned, the entire \"seminal nature\" of humanity was corrupted. This provides a mechanism for understanding how the \"laws\" governing human nature were fundamentally alteredâ€”from a state of innocence and harmony to a state of inherited original sin and concupiscence, a change transmitted through procreation.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
