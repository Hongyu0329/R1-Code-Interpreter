    "In an interval type-3 fuzzy set, the rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent part, `Phi_k(x′)`, and the membership degree of the consequent part, `μG_k_j(y_j)`. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy logic.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\nThe calculation of the rule activation level depends on the specific t-norm used. Here are the results for the three most common t-norms:\n\n*   **Minimum t-norm:** This is one of the most frequently used t-norms and is defined as the minimum of the two values.\n    *   `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n    *   Activation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n*   **Product t-norm:** This t-norm calculates the product of the two values.\n    *   `T(a, b) = a * b`\n    *   Activation Level = `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\n*   **Łukasiewicz t-norm:** This t-norm is defined as the maximum of 0 and the sum of the values minus 1.\n    *   `T(a, b) = max(0, a + b - 1)`\n    *   Activation Level = `max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6`\n\n<<<The rule activation level is 0.7 when using the minimum t-norm, 0.63 for the product t-norm, and 0.6 for the Łukasiewicz t-norm.>>>"
