  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is a problem of information theory. To find the maximum length of the secret message, we need to compare the total information capacity of the \"Ching\" with the information required to encode each character of the message from the \"Shu\".\n\n1.  **Calculate the information capacity of the Ching:**\n    *   The Ching has 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each symbol has two \"yinyang\" states (yin, yang) and five \"wuxing\" states (water, fire, wood, metal, earth).\n    *   The total number of states for each symbol is 2 * 5 = 10 states.\n    *   The total information capacity of the Ching in bits is calculated as:\n        *   Capacity = Number of symbols * log₂(Number of states per symbol)\n        *   Capacity = 9999 * log₂(10) bits\n\n2.  **Calculate the information required for each character of the message:**\n    *   The message is written using a set of 120 characters from the Shu. This is our alphabet.\n    *   The number of bits required to represent one character from an alphabet of 120 is:\n        *   Bits per character = ⌈log₂(120)⌉ (We use the ceiling function because you need a whole number of bits).\n        *   Since 2⁶ = 64 and 2⁷ = 128, we need 7 bits to uniquely represent any of the 120 characters.\n\n3.  **Calculate the maximum length of the message:**\n    *   The maximum length is the total information capacity of the Ching divided by the bits required per character. We must take the floor of the result since we can't have a fraction of a character.\n    *   Max Length = floor( (9999 * log₂(10)) / 7 )\n    *   Using the value log₂(10) ≈ 3.321928:\n    *   Max Length = floor( (9999 * 3.321928) / 7 )\n    *   Max Length = floor( 33215.958 / 7 )\n    *   Max Length = floor( 4745.136 )\n    *   Max Length = 4745\n\nThe information about the 3000 characters in the Shu and the computation/recognition times are not relevant to the calculation of the maximum possible message length.\n\n<<<4745>>>"
