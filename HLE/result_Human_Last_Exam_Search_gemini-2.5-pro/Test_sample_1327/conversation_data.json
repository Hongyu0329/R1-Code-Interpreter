    "The pattern in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119 can be determined by examining the relationship between consecutive terms.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence by observing how each number can be generated from the previous one. The pattern involves multiplying the previous number by 2 and then adding a number from a secondary sequence.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the pattern:\n*   The first term is 2.\n*   The second term is 11, which is `(2 * 2) + 7`.\n*   The third term is 23, which is `(2 * 11) + 1`.\n*   The fourth term is 51, which is `(2 * 23) + 5`.\n*   The fifth term is 119, which is `(2 * 51) + 17`.\n\nThis reveals a primary operation of `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + a_n`. To find the next term in the main sequence, we must first determine the next term in the secondary sequence `a_n = {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}`.\n\nLet's find the pattern within the sequence `a_n`:\n*   `a_2 = 1`\n*   `a_3 = 5 = 1 + 4`\n*   `a_4 = 17 = 5 + 12`\n\nThe differences between the terms of `a_n` are 4 and 12. This suggests a pattern where the difference is multiplied by 3 each time (4, 4*3=12, 12*3=36, ...).\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\nTherefore, the next term in the `a_n` sequence, `a_5`, is `17 + 36 = 53`.\n\nNow we can calculate the next term in the main sequence:\n*   Next term = `(2 * 119) + 53` = `238 + 53` = 291.\n\nThus, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
