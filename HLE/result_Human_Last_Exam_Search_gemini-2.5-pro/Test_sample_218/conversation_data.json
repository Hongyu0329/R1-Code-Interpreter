    "There are 52 irreducible representations of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, that have a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. For $S_{25}$, we consider the partitions of 25. The dimension of the irreducible representation corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is denoted by $d_\\lambda$. An irreducible representation and its conjugate have the same dimension. A partition is self-conjugate if it is its own conjugate.\n\nThe partitions of 25 that give a dimension strictly less than 500,000 are listed below, along with their dimensions. None of these partitions are self-conjugate, so each partition and its conjugate contribute to the total count.\n\n1.  **Partition**: The dimension is 1. Its conjugate is [1$^{25}$], which also has dimension 1. This gives 2 irreps.\n2.  **Partitions with two parts, [25-k, k] for k > 0**:\n    *  : Dimension is 24.

This and its conjugate [2$^7$, 1$^{11}$] give 2 irreps.\n    (For, the dimension is 600,875, which is too large).
