    "Answering this question requires analyzing the homotopy groups of the involved spaces and the map itself. The map in question is `h: Σ ( ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`. To determine its connectivity, we need to find the largest integer `k` such that the homotopy groups of its fiber, `πᵢ(F)`, are trivial for all `i ≤ k`.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Spaces and their Connectivity\n\n*   **Domain:** The domain is `X = Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)`. Let `K = ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶`. The connectivity of `X` is `1 + conn(K)`.\n*   **Codomain:** The codomain is `Y = Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶) = ΩS¹⁰`. The `n`-sphere `Sⁿ` is `(n-1)`-connected. Therefore, `S¹⁰` is 9-connected. The loop space `ΩZ` has connectivity `conn(Z) - 1`. Thus, `Y = ΩS¹⁰` is `9 - 1 = 8`-connected.\n\n### 2. Connectivity of the Domain `X`\n\nTo find the connectivity of `X`, we first need the connectivity of `K = ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶`. This depends on the connectivity of `ΩS⁴` and `ΩS⁶`.\n\n*   `S⁴` is 3-connected, so `ΩS⁴` is `3 - 1 = 2`-connected.\n*   `S⁶` is 5-connected, so `ΩS⁶` is `5 - 1 = 4`-connected.\n\nThe connectivity of a smash product `A ∧ B` is given by `conn(A) + conn(B) + 1`. However, to find the precise connectivity, we must examine the first non-vanishing homology group.\n\nThe integral homology of a loop space on an even sphere `ΩS²ⁿ` is a polynomial algebra `H_*(ΩS²ⁿ; ℤ) ≅ ℤ[x₂ₙ₋₁]`, where `x₂ₙ₋₁` is a generator in degree `2n-1`.\n*   For `ΩS⁴`, `H_*(ΩS⁴; ℤ) ≅ ℤ[x₃]`, with generators in dimensions 3, 6, 9, ...\n*   For `ΩS⁶`, `H_*(ΩS⁶; ℤ) ≅ ℤ[x₅]`, with generators in dimensions 5, 10, 15, ...\n\nUsing the Künneth formula for the reduced homology of a smash product, `\\tilde{H}_k(A ∧ B) ≅ \\bigoplus_{i+j=k} \\tilde{H}_i(A) ⊗ \\tilde{H}_j(B)`.\nLet's find the lowest `k` for which `\\tilde{H}_k(K)` is non-zero:\n*   `k < 6`: All combinations of `i+j=k` result in a zero group.\n*   `k = 6`: `\\tilde{H}_6(K) = \\tilde{H}_6(ΩS⁴) ⊗ \\tilde{H}_0(ΩS⁶) ⊕ ... = ℤ ⊗ ℤ = ℤ`. The term `\\tilde{H}_6(ΩS⁴)` is non-zero, corresponding to `x₃²`.\n*   `k = 7`: `\\tilde{H}_7(K) = 0`.\n*   `k = 8`: `\\tilde{H}_8(K) = \\tilde{H}_3(ΩS⁴) ⊗ \\tilde{H}_5(ΩS⁶) = ℤ ⊗ ℤ = ℤ`.\n\nSince the first non-trivial homology group of `K` is `H₆(K) = ℤ`, by the Hurewicz theorem, `K` is 5-connected.\nConsequently, the connectivity of the domain `X = ΣK` is `conn(K) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6`.\n\n### 3. The Homotopy Fiber and Connectivity of the Map\n\nA key result by F. Cohen (1979, \"Splitting certain suspensions\") establishes a fibration sequence involving the map `h`:\n`Σ(ΩS³ ∧ ΩS⁵) → Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`\n\nThe homotopy fiber `F` of the map `h` is therefore `F ≃ Σ(ΩS³ ∧ ΩS⁵)`. We can calculate its connectivity:\n*   `S³` is 2-connected, so `ΩS³` is 1-connected.\n*   `S⁵` is 4-connected, so `ΩS⁵` is 3-connected.\n*   The connectivity of `ΩS³ ∧ ΩS⁵` is `conn(ΩS³) + conn(ΩS⁵) + 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5`.\n*   The connectivity of the fiber `F = Σ(ΩS³ ∧ ΩS⁵)` is `5 + 1 = 6`.\n\nThe connectivity of a map is equal to the connectivity of its homotopy fiber. Since the fiber `F` is 6-connected, the map `h` is 6-connected. This means that the induced map on homotopy groups, `h_* : πᵢ(X) → πᵢ(Y)`, is an isomorphism for `i < 6` and a surjection for `i = 6`. This is consistent with our findings that `conn(X)=6` and `conn(Y)=8`, as for `i < 6`, both `πᵢ(X)` and `πᵢ(Y)` are trivial.\n\n<<<6>>>"
