    "I am unable to provide a definitive count of the *sissonne fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich.\n\nMy search for a publicly accessible video of this specific performance has been unsuccessful. While I can confirm that Svetlana Zakharova did perform this role in the specified production, the available online resources are limited to reviews, which do not detail specific choreographic counts, and links to subscription-based streaming services or unavailable videos. A complete and close analysis of the performance is necessary to accurately count the number of times a specific ballet step is executed.\n\nWithout a viewable recording of the variation, I cannot fulfill your request."
