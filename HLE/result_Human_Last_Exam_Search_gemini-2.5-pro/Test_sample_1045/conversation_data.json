    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we first need to understand how the basis set is defined for each type of atom in the molecule.\n\n### Breakdown of the 6-31G Basis Set:\n\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented by basis functions, which are themselves combinations of primitive Gaussian functions.\n\n*   **For heavy atoms (like Carbon):**\n    *   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The '6' indicates that each core atomic orbital (in this case, the 1s orbital) is represented by a single contracted function composed of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The '31' signifies a \"split-valence\" basis set, meaning the valence orbitals are represented by two functions instead of one.\n        *   An \"inner\" part, which is a contracted function made from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   An \"outer\" part, which is a single uncontracted function made from 1 primitive Gaussian.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   Hydrogen only has a 1s valence orbital. The basis set is also split.\n    *   One contracted function is formed from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   A second function is formed from 1 primitive Gaussian.\n\n### Counting the Contracted Functions per Atom:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** A carbon atom has a 1s core orbital and 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz valence orbitals.\n    *   **1s (core):** 1 contracted function.\n    *   **2s (valence):** 2 contracted functions (one from 3 primitives, one from 1 primitive).\n    *   **2p (valence):** For each of the three p-orbitals (px, py, pz), there are 2 contracted functions. This gives a total of 3 \\* 2 = 6 contracted functions for the p-shell.\n    *   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** A hydrogen atom has only a 1s valence orbital.\n    *   **1s (valence):** 2 contracted functions (one from 3 primitives, one from 1 primitive).\n    *   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** **2 contracted functions**.\n\n### Calculating the Total for Toluene (C7H8):\n\nToluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it contains:\n*   7 Carbon atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen atoms\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions:\n*   **From Carbon:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **From Hydrogen:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\n<<<79>>>"
