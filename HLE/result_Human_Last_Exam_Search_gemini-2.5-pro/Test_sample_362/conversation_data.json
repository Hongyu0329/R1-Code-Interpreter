    "The reaction between an aldehyde or ketone and a phosphorus ylide to form an alkene is known as the Wittig reaction. The ylide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon. This process leads to the formation of a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane, which then decomposes to yield the final alkene product and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nThe reactants in this specific case are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde** (2,2-dimethylpropanal), which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**, which is a phosphorus ylide with the structure Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄).\n\nIn the reaction, the double bond of the alkene is formed between the carbonyl carbon of the pivalaldehyde and the carbon atom double-bonded to the phosphorus in the ylide.\n\nThe resulting product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe Wittig reaction's stereochemistry depends on the stability of the ylide. The ylide used here, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, is considered unstabilized because the negatively charged carbon is not adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group that would stabilize it through resonance. Reactions with unstabilized ylides typically favor the formation of the (Z)-alkene. However, the steric bulk of the pivalaldehyde might influence the stereochemical outcome. Therefore, a mixture of (E) and (Z) isomers would be expected, with the (Z)-isomer likely being the major product.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
