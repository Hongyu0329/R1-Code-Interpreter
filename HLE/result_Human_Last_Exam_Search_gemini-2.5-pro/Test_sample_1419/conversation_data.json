    "In the context of the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is derived from the renormalization group (RG) beta function for the coupling constant u. This analysis is performed in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, where ϵ is a small positive parameter.\n\nThe RG beta function describes how the coupling constant u changes with the energy scale. To the leading order in both u and ϵ, the beta function for a single-component scalar field (N=1) with a Lagrangian density containing an interaction term of the form (u/4!)ϕ⁴ is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (3u²)/(16π²) + O(u³)\n\nA fixed point of the renormalization group flow is a value of the coupling u* where the beta function vanishes, i.e., β(u*) = 0. This indicates that the coupling constant no longer changes with the energy scale, leading to scale invariance, a key feature of critical phenomena.\n\nSetting the beta function to zero to find the non-trivial fixed point (u* ≠ 0), we have:\n\n-ϵu* + (3(u*)²)/(16π²) = 0\n\nDividing by u* (since we are interested in the non-zero solution), we get:\n\n-ϵ + (3u*)/(16π²) = 0\n\nSolving for u*, we obtain the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of ϵ:\n\nu* = (16π²ϵ)/3\n\nThis non-trivial fixed point is known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. It plays a crucial role in understanding the universal critical behavior of systems in the same universality class as the ϕ⁴ theory, such as the Ising model near its critical temperature. The existence of this fixed point for small ϵ allows for perturbative calculations of critical exponents as an expansion in ϵ.\n\n<<<u* = (16π²ϵ)/3>>>"
