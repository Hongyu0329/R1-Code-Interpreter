Here is a breakdown of how much more you can legally contribute to your various accounts for the 2024 tax year:

*   **401(k):** You have already met your maximum employee contribution limit of $23,000. However, the overall limit for total 401(k) contributions (including employer match) is $69,000. Your employer contributed $11,500 (50% of your $23,000). This leaves a potential of **$34,500** that you could contribute as after-tax contributions, provided your plan allows for it.
*   **HSA:** You have already contributed the maximum of $4,150 for an individual, so you have **$0** remaining.
*   **FSA:** You have already contributed the maximum of $3,200, so you have **$0** remaining.
*   **Backdoor Roth IRA:** The limit for 2024 is $7,000. Since you have contributed $5,000, you have **$2,000** remaining to contribute.

Therefore, the total additional amount you can legally contribute to your retirement accounts for the 2024 tax year is **$36,500** (the $34,500 for the 401k and $2,000 for the IRA).
