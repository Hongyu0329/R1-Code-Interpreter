    "To evaluate the definite integral `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1, we first need to define the function `F₃(x)`.\n\nThe functions are defined as follows:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\nThe integral we need to evaluate is `V = ∫[from 0 to 1] (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx`.\n\nThis integral is of the form `∫ g'(x)/g(x) dx`, where `g(x) = F₃(x)`. The antiderivative of an expression of this form is `ln|g(x)|`. Therefore, the integral of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate the definite integral by finding the difference of the antiderivative at the upper and lower limits of integration.\n\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\nNow, we need to calculate `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`:\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\nFor the interval `x` in `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is between `0` and `sin(1)`. Since `e` to any power is positive, `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than 1. Consequently, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always positive on this interval, so we can remove the absolute value signs.\n\nSubstituting the values of `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` into the equation for V:\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nThis can be simplified using the properties of logarithms:\nV = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) )\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of V:\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.84147098) ≈ 2.31977488\n*   1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.31977488\n*   F₃(1) = ln(3.31977488) ≈ 1.20000451\n*   F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718\n*   V = ln(1.20000451) - ln(0.69314718) ≈ 0.1823253 - (-0.3665129)\n*   V ≈ 0.5488382\n\nThe final step is to find the closest integer to `10000 * V`:\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.5488382 = 5488.382\n\nThe closest integer to 5488.382 is 5488.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
