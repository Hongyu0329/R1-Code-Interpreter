    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1,1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixel coordinates that form the line.\n\nBresenham's algorithm is an efficient method for drawing lines on a grid of pixels. It works by making incremental calculations at each step to determine the next pixel to plot.\n\nHere are the steps and the resulting pixels for the line from (1,1) to (11,5):\n\n1.  **Calculate the change in x and y:**\n    *   Δx = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   Δy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial decision parameter:**\n    *   p = 2 * Δy - Δx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\n3.  **Iterate and find each pixel:**\n    Starting with the first point (1,1), the algorithm decides whether to increment the y-coordinate based on the sign of the decision parameter. This process is repeated until the endpoint is reached.\n\nThe sequence of pixels generated by the algorithm is:\n*   (1, 1)\n*   (2, 1)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (4, 2)\n*   (5, 3)\n*   **(6, 3)**\n*   (7, 3)\n*   (8, 4)\n*   (9, 4)\n*   (10, 5)\n*   (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels on this line. The central pixel is the 6th one in the sequence.\n\nThe coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
