The assertion that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first is a nuanced issue with valid arguments on both sides. The mainstream scientific consensus is that the second postulate is not strictly derivable from the first in a purely logical sense without making additional, significant assumptions.

The argument for the second postulate's redundancy is primarily based on considering Maxwell's equations as a fundamental law of physics. The first postulate states that all laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Since Maxwell's equations predict a constant speed of light, if these equations are a fundamental law of physics, then the speed of light must be constant in all inertial frames.

However, one can also approach the problem by considering only the principle of relativity and fundamental properties of spacetime (homogeneity and isotropy). From these assumptions, one can derive that the transformation between inertial frames must be of a certain form (a Lorentz-like transformation) which contains an undetermined invariant speed. This invariant speed could be infinite, which would correspond to Galilean relativity, or a finite value. To establish that this finite speed is indeed the speed of light, one must turn to experimental evidence, such as the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment.

Thus, the second postulate can be seen as either a consequence of accepting Maxwell's theory as universally valid or as a necessary piece of empirical data required to complete the theory derived from the first postulate and general spacetime symmetries. Einstein's decision to state it as a separate postulate provided a more robust foundation for special relativity, independent of the ultimate correctness of Maxwell's equations. Some physicists maintain that without the second postulate, the theory remains an incomplete structure. Therefore, it is not entirely accurate to say the second postulate is superfluous.
