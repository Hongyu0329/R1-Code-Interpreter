The ideal Ni/Ce ratio depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a molar ratio of approximately 0.07 to around 0.285 (or 5-12.5 wt% Ni) is often optimal. For water splitting, the ideal ratio can be higher, with a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5 showing promise for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and ratios of 1 to 3 being effective for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER).
