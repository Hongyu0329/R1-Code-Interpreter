    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the stereochemistry of the starting material. The (1S,2R) designation indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring, meaning it is a *cis* isomer.\n\nFor an E2 elimination to occur, the leaving group (bromine) and a beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in an anti-periplanar, or trans-diaxial, conformation. Let's examine the two chair conformations of cis-(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n\n1.  **Conformation A:** The bromine atom is in an axial position, and the methyl group is in an equatorial position. In this conformation, the axial bromine has two adjacent axial hydrogens that are anti-periplanar to it: one on carbon 2 and one on carbon 6.\n2.  **Conformation B:** The bromine atom is in an equatorial position, and the methyl group is in an axial position. An E2 reaction cannot proceed from this conformation because the leaving group is not axial.\n\nTherefore, the reaction must proceed through Conformation A. Since there are anti-periplanar hydrogens on both C2 and C6, two different products can be formed:\n\n*   **Zaitsev Product:** Elimination of the hydrogen from C2 would form **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted and generally more stable alkene.\n*   **Hofmann Product:** Elimination of the hydrogen from C6 would form **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene.\n\nThe choice of base is crucial in determining the major product. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, but sterically bulky, base. Due to its large size, it preferentially attacks the less sterically hindered proton. The beta-hydrogen on C6 is more accessible than the beta-hydrogen on C2, which is shielded by the adjacent methyl group.\n\nConsequently, the reaction favors the removal of the proton from C6, leading to the formation of the Hofmann product as the major product.\n\nThe name of the major product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
