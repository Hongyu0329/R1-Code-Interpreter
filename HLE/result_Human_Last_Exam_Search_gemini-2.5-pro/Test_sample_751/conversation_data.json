    "To reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Dual System**: The principle of duality states that the observer canonical form of a system `(A, C)` is related to the controller canonical form of its dual system. The dual system is defined by `(A_d, B_d)`, where `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`.\n    *   Original matrices:\n        `A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n        `C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n    *   Dual matrices:\n        `A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n        `B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n2.  **Find the Transformation Matrix for the Dual System**: We need to find the transformation matrix `P` that converts the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` into controller canonical form. This involves analyzing the controllability of the dual system.\n    *   The columns of `B_d` are `b_d1 = [0, 1, 0]^T` and `b_d2 = [1, 1, 0]^T`.\n    *   We form the controllability matrix `W_c = [b_d1, A_d*b_d1, A_d^2*b_d1, ..., b_d2, ...]` and select `n=3` linearly independent vectors.\n    *   `A_d*b_d1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T`.\n    *   We can choose the linearly independent set `{b_d1, A_d*b_d1, b_d2}`. This choice sets the controllability indices to `mu_1 = 2` and `mu_2 = 1`.\n    *   We form the selection matrix `M = [b_d1, A_d*b_d1, b_d2] = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`.\n    *   The inverse of `M` is calculated as `M^-1 = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`.\n    *   From `M^-1`, we select rows to build the transformation matrix `P`. Let `q_1` be the 2nd row (`mu_1`-th row) of `M^-1` and `q_2` be the 3rd row (`mu_1 + mu_2`-th row).\n        *   `q_1 = [0, 0, 1]`\n        *   `q_2 = [1, 0, -2]`\n    *   The rows of the transformation matrix `P` are constructed as `t_1 = q_1*A_d`, `t_2 = q_1`, and `t_3 = q_2`.\n        *   `t_1 = [0, 0, 1] * A_d = [0, 1, 0]`\n        *   `t_2 = [0, 0, 1]`\n        *   `t_3 = [1, 0, -2]`\n    *   This gives the transformation matrix `P = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`.\n\n3.  **Determine the New C Matrix**: The new output matrix for the observer canonical form, `C_o`, is the transpose of the new input matrix for the controller canonical form of the dual system, `B_c`.\n    *   `B_c = P * B_d`\n    *   `B_c = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]] = [[1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n    *   Therefore, the new matrix `C` for the observer canonical form is `C_o = B_c^T`.\n\n`C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]`\n\nThis can be verified by calculating the transformation matrix for the original system, `T = (P^{-1})^T`, and then computing `C_o = C * T^{-1} = C * P^T`.\n\n*   `P^T = [[0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, -2]]`\n*   `C * P^T = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, -2]] = [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]`\n\nThe results from both methods match.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
