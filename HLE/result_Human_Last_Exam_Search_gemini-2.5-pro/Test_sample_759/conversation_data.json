    "To determine the smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph `γ` with an automorphism group of order 3, we need to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\n### Properties of the graph\n1.  **Simple and Connected:** The graph has no loops or multiple edges, and there is a path between any two vertices.\n2.  **Automorphism Group of Order 3:** `|Aut(γ)| = 3`. Since 3 is a prime number, this group must be the cyclic group of order 3, denoted `Z₃`. This means there is a non-trivial automorphism `φ` such that `φ³` is the identity, and the only automorphisms are `id`, `φ`, and `φ²`.\n\n### Analyzing the Graph Structure\nThe automorphism `φ` permutes the vertices of the graph. The set of vertices `V` can be partitioned into orbits under the action of `φ`. The size of any orbit must divide the order of the group, which is 3. Thus, orbits can have a size of 1 (fixed points) or 3. Since `φ` is not the identity, there must be at least one orbit of size 3.\n\nLet's try to construct such a graph with the minimum number of vertices and edges.\n\nA known result from graph theory, for instance by Babai, states that the minimum number of vertices `n` for a graph with `|Aut(γ)| = Z₃` is `n=9`.\n\nA connected graph with `n=9` vertices must have at least `n-1 = 8` edges. A graph with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges is a tree. However, it can be shown that no tree has an automorphism group of order 3. Any tree with an automorphism of order 3 acting on its vertices would also possess reflectional symmetries, leading to an automorphism group of order at least 6 (isomorphic to `S₃`). Therefore, the graph cannot be a tree, which means its number of edges `e` must be at least `n`.\n\nSo, for `n=9`, the minimum possible number of edges is `e=9`.\n\n### Constructing a Candidate Graph with n=9 and e=9\nLet's try to build a graph `γ` with 9 vertices and 9 edges that satisfies the conditions. The 9 vertices must be partitioned into orbits of size 3 by the automorphism `φ`. Let's define three orbits:\n*   `A = {a₁, a₂, a₃}`\n*   `B = {b₁, b₂, b₃}`\n*   `C = {c₁, c₂, c₃}`\n\nThe automorphism `φ` acts as a cycle on each orbit: `φ(aᵢ) = aᵢ₊₁`, `φ(bᵢ) = bᵢ₊₁`, `φ(cᵢ) = cᵢ₊₁` (indices are taken modulo 3, starting from 1).\n\nNow we must add edges in a way that is preserved by `φ` and does not introduce any other symmetries (like reflections). Edges must be added in sets of 3. For example, if `(a₁, b₁)` is an edge, then `(a₂, b₂)` and `(a₃, b₃)` must also be edges to preserve `φ`.\n\nLet's define the edge set `E` with three such triplets of edges, for a total of `e=9`. Consider the following set of edges:\n1.  **Edges connecting A and B:** `{(a₁, b₁), (a₂, b₂), (a₃, b₃)}`.\n2.  **Edges connecting A and C:** `{(a₁, c₁), (a₂, c₂), (a₃, c₃)}`.\n3.  **\"Twisted\" edges connecting C and A:** `{(c₁, a₂), (c₂, a₃), (c₃, a₁)}`.\n\nLet's analyze the resulting graph `γ`:\n*   **Vertices `V`:** `A ∪ B ∪ C`, so `n=9`.\n*   **Edges `E`:** `{(aᵢ, bᵢ)} ∪ {(aᵢ, cᵢ)} ∪ {(cᵢ, aᵢ₊₁)}`, so `e=9`.\n\n**Is it connected?**\nThe vertex `a₁` is connected to `b₁` and `c₁`. `a₁` is also connected to `c₃`. `c₃` is connected to `a₃`. `a₃` is connected to `b₃` and `c₃`. `c₃` is connected to `a₁`. `a₁` is connected to `c₁` which is connected to `a₂`. All `aᵢ` and `cᵢ` vertices are in a single component. Since each `bᵢ` is connected to an `aᵢ`, the entire graph is connected.\n\n**What is its automorphism group?**\nLet's examine the degrees of the vertices:\n*   `deg(bᵢ)`: Each `bᵢ` is only connected to `aᵢ`. So, `deg(bᵢ) = 1` for `i=1,2,3`.\n*   `deg(cᵢ)`: Each `cᵢ` is connected to `aᵢ` and `aᵢ₊₁`. So, `deg(cᵢ) = 2` for `i=1,2,3`.\n*   `deg(aᵢ)`: Each `aᵢ` is connected to `bᵢ`, `cᵢ`, and `cᵢ₋₁`. So, `deg(aᵢ) = 3` for `i=1,2,3`.\n\nSince the degrees within each orbit (`A`, `B`, `C`) are constant, but different between orbits, any automorphism `ψ` must map the orbits to themselves. That is, `ψ(A)=A`, `ψ(B)=B`, `ψ(C)=C`.\n\nLet `ψ` be an automorphism. `ψ` must map leaves (`B`) to leaves. Let `ψ(bᵢ) = bⱼ`. This implies `ψ(N(bᵢ)) = N(bⱼ)`, so `ψ(aᵢ) = aⱼ`.\nThis means the permutation on `A` dictates the permutation on `B`.\nThe edges `{(aᵢ, cᵢ)}` and `{(cᵢ, aᵢ₊₁)}` create a rigid structure. A permutation `(a₁ a₂)` for instance, would require `(c₁ c₂)` to preserve `(aᵢ,cᵢ)` edges, but would fail to preserve the `(cᵢ,aᵢ₊₁)` edges: `ψ(c₁,a₂) = (c₂,a₁)` which is not an edge.\nThe only permutations of `A` that can be extended to an automorphism of the whole graph are the cyclic shifts `aᵢ → aᵢ₊k`.\nLet's test `ψₖ` where `ψₖ(aᵢ)=aᵢ₊ₖ`, `ψₖ(bᵢ)=bᵢ₊ₖ`, `ψₖ(cᵢ)=cᵢ₊ₖ`.\n*   `ψₖ(aᵢ, bᵢ) = (aᵢ₊ₖ, bᵢ₊ₖ)`, which is an edge.\n*   `ψₖ(aᵢ, cᵢ) = (aᵢ₊ₖ, cᵢ₊ₖ)`, which is an edge.\n*   `ψₖ(cᵢ, aᵢ₊₁) = (cᵢ₊ₖ, aᵢ₊₁₊ₖ)`, which is an edge.\n\nSo, for each `k` in `{0, 1, 2}`, `ψₖ` is an automorphism. These three automorphisms correspond to `id`, `φ`, and `φ²`. Thus, the automorphism group is `Z₃`, which has order 3.\n\nWe have found a simple, connected graph with `n=9` vertices and `e=9` edges, and `|Aut(γ)|=3`. Since the minimum number of vertices is 9, and the graph cannot be a tree (`e>8`), the minimum number of edges is 9.\n\n"
