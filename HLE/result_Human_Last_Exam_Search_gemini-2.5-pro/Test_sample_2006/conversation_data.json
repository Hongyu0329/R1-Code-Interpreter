The storm brought catastrophic \"winds of change\" to this city and the surrounding regions.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"** is a clue pointing to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The \"divine\" reference is to the \"Saint\" in its name.

The haiku guides us to the specific event and highlights one significant bay. The full answer is a list of the prominent bays affected by Hurricane Katrina. In alphabetical order, the most significantly impacted bays were:\n\n*   Bay St. Louis\n*   Biloxi Bay\n*   Mobile Bay\n*   Perdido Bay\n\n<<<Bay St. Louis, Biloxi Bay, Mobile Bay, Perdido Bay>>>"
