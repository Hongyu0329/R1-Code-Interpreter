    "According to Veronika Campan's interpretation of the *Paragone* in Italian Renaissance painting, the artist who, at the end of his work, separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation is Girolamo Mazzola Bedoli.\n\nVeronika Campan's doctoral dissertation, \"Der Paragone in der italienischen Malerei des Cinquecento,\" delves into the debate between painting and sculpture, known as the Paragone. A significant portion of her research is dedicated to analyzing the works of Girolamo Mazzola Bedoli (c. 1500–1569), a Mannerist painter from Parma.\n\nThe \"prohibition against representation\" can be understood as the inherent limitations of sculpture compared to painting. The Paragone debate often highlighted painting's ability to depict a wide array of subjects, textures, and illusions—such as \"another's material possessions\"—which were considered beyond the scope of sculpture. Campan's analysis of Bedoli's work focuses on the \"Paragonemittel,\" the artistic means through which painters engaged in this debate. This included the practice of painting simulated statues, a direct commentary on painting's capacity to absorb and surpass the qualities of sculpture.\n\nBedoli's paintings, such as the *Allegory of the Immaculate Conception*, are noted for their complex iconography and inclusion of numerous figures and objects, showcasing the expansive representative power of painting. His work is characterized by a refined and polished style that, while influenced by his contemporary Parmigianino, demonstrated a distinct approach to composition and subject matter. It is within this context of the Paragone and Bedoli's specific artistic choices that Veronika Campan's interpretation is situated.\n\n<<<Girolamo Mazzola Bedoli>>>"
