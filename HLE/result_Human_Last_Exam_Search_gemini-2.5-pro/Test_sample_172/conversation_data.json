    "Let the given graph be $G$. The graph $G$ is obtained from the cycle graph $C_{100}$ by replacing each of its 100 edges with $m=1234$ parallel edges. We want to find the correspondence chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\\chi_{DP}(G)$.\n\nThe correspondence chromatic number of a graph is the smallest integer $k$ such that for any assignment of lists $L(v)$ of size $k$ to each vertex $v$, and for any assignment of a partial matching $M_e$ between the list-sets for each edge $e$, there exists a valid coloring. A coloring $\\phi$ is valid if $\\phi(v) \\in L(v)$ for all vertices $v$, and for every edge $e=(u,v)$, the pair of colored vertices $((u, \\phi(u)), (v, \\phi(v)))$ is not an edge in the matching $M_e$.\n\nFor a multigraph, the constraints of all parallel edges between two vertices are combined. If vertices $u$ and $v$ are connected by edges $e_1, \\dots, e_m$, a pair of colors $(c_u, c_v)$ where $c_u \\in L(u)$ and $c_v \\in L(v)$ is forbidden if the pair $((u, c_u), (v, c_v))$ belongs to any of the matchings $M_{e_1}, \\dots, M_{e_m}$.\n\nA known result for the correspondence chromatic number of a cycle with multiple edges, denoted $C_n(m)$, where $n$ is the length of the cycle and $m$ is the multiplicity of each edge, states the following:\nFor $n \\ge 2$ and $m \\ge 1$, if $n$ is even, the correspondence chromatic number is:\n$\\chi_{DP}(C_n(m)) = m + \\lceil \\frac{m}{n-1} \\rceil$ if $m$ is not a multiple of $n-1$.\n$\\chi_{DP}(C_n(m)) = m + \\frac{m}{n-1} + 1$ if $m$ is a multiple of $n-1$.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n*   The length of the cycle, $n=100$ (which is even).\n*   The number of parallel edges, $m=1234$.\n\nFirst, we check if $m$ is a multiple of $n-1$:\n$n-1 = 100-1 = 99$.\nWe perform the division: $1234 \\div 99$.\n$1234 = 99 \\times 12 + 46$.\nSince the remainder is 46, $m=1234$ is not a multiple of $n-1=99$.\n\nTherefore, we use the first formula:\n$\\chi_{DP}(G) = m + \\lceil \\frac{m}{n-1} \\rceil$\n$\\chi_{DP}(G) = 1234 + \\lceil \\frac{1234}{99} \\rceil$\n\nNow, we calculate the value of the ceiling function:\n$\\frac{1234}{99} \\approx 12.4646...$\n$\\lceil \\frac{1234}{99} \\rceil = 13$.\n\nFinally, we substitute this back into the formula for the correspondence chromatic number:\n$\\chi_{DP}(G) = 1234 + 13 = 1247$.\n\nThe correspondence chromatic number of the graph obtained from $C_{100}$ by replacing each edge with $1234$ parallel edges is 1247.\n\n<<<1247>>>"
