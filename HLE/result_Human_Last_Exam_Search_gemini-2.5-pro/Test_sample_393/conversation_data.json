    "The question asks for the number of Tverberg partitions of a specially constructed set of points. The problem statement guarantees the existence of a set of `n` points, `X`, in `ℝ^d` for any given partition `n = a₁ + a₂ + ... + aᵣ` (with `1 ≤ aᵢ ≤ d+1`). This set `X` has the unique property that *all* of its Tverberg partitions consist of `r` subsets with sizes `a₁, a₂, ..., aᵣ`.\n\nA Tverberg partition is a collection of subsets `{X₁, X₂, ..., Xᵣ}` whose convex hulls have a non-empty intersection. Since the collection of subsets is a set, the order of the subsets does not matter, meaning we are counting unlabeled partitions.\n\nThe problem is therefore reduced to a combinatorial counting problem: finding the number of ways to partition a set of `n` distinct elements into `r` unlabeled subsets of specified sizes `a₁, a₂, ..., aᵣ`.\n\nThe formula for this is derived in two steps:\n1.  **Count the number of labeled partitions**: First, we count the number of ways to partition the `n` points into `r` distinct (labeled) groups `X₁, ..., Xᵣ` with respective sizes `a₁, ..., aᵣ`. This is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n    `n! / (a₁! a₂! ... aᵣ!)`\n\n2.  **Adjust for unlabeled partitions**: Since the Tverberg partition is a set of subsets, the ordering of the subsets does not matter. The multinomial coefficient above assumes the groups are distinguishable. If some groups have the same size, we have overcounted. We must divide by the number of ways to permute the subsets that have the same size.\n\nLet `{s₁, s₂, ..., sₖ}` be the set of distinct sizes in the partition `{a₁, a₂, ..., aᵣ}`, and let `mⱼ` be the multiplicity of the size `sⱼ` (i.e., the number of parts `aᵢ` that are equal to `sⱼ`). The total number of permutations of same-sized subsets is `m₁! m₂! ... mₖ!`.\n\nTherefore, the final number of distinct, unlabeled Tverberg partitions is given by the formula:\n\n<<<Number of partitions = [ (n! / (a₁! a₂! ... aᵣ!)) ] / (m₁! m₂! ... mₖ!)>>>"
