    "The most commonly used name for the genus *Perdita* in their native range of North America is \"fairy bee\". This name is often used in recent scientific and public literature to refer to these very small bees. Another common name associated with this genus, due to their ground-nesting behavior, is \"miner bee\", a term also used more broadly for other bees in the family Andrenidae.\n\nThe exact year the name \"fairy bee\" was coined is not definitively established in available resources. There is an unconfirmed rumor that the name may have originated on social media in recent years. The scientific name for the genus, *Perdita*, which is Latin for \"lost one,\" was established by Frederick Smith in 1853.\n\n<<<fairy bee, not definitively known>>>"
