    "I have been unable to identify the specific individual who held the position of judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461.\n\nHistorical records indicate that during the 15th century, Bártfa, as a free royal town, was governed by a town council, which included a judge (in Hungarian, \"bíró\"; in Latin, \"judex\") and jurors. The primary source that would likely contain this information is the archival collection compiled by Béla Iványi titled *Bártfa szabad királyi város levéltára 1319–1526* (The Archives of the Free Royal Town of Bártfa 1319–1526). While this extensive work has been digitized and is a important resource for the history of Bardejov, searches for the year 1461 and the terms for \"judge\" within this collection did not yield the name of a specific person.\n\nFurther research into scholarly articles and historical publications that cite Iványi's work also did not reveal the name of the judge for that particular year. These documents confirm the administrative structure of the town and mention town officials from other years, but a specific reference for 1461 is not readily available in the searched materials. For example, a Juraj Stenczel is mentioned as a long-serving member of the town council in the 15th century, but his specific role in 1461 is not defined.\n\nTherefore, while the identity of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 is likely recorded within the town's extensive archives, this information is not accessible through the conducted research.\n\n<<<I was unable to find the answer to your question.>>>"
