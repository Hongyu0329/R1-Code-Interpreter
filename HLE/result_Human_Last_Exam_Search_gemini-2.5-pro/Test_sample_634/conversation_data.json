    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nand\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1],\n\nwe can use a method based on row-reducing a composite matrix formed by stacking P1 and P2. The procedure is analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two polynomials.\n\nFirst, we form the composite matrix M by stacking P1 on top of P2:\nM =\n[s^2 + s, -s]\n[-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n[s, 0]\n[-s - 1, 1]\n\nLet the rows of M be R1, R2, R3, and R4. We will perform polynomial elementary row operations to reduce this matrix to a simpler form. The goal is to obtain a row-echelon form. The non-zero rows of the resulting matrix will form a GCRD.\n\nThe elementary row operations are:\n1. Swapping two rows.\n2. Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\nLet's proceed with the row reduction:\n\nInitial Matrix:\nR1: [s^2 + s, -s]\nR2: [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\nR3: [s, 0]\nR4: [-s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 1:** To simplify the matrix, we use the rows with lower-degree polynomials to eliminate terms in rows with higher-degree polynomials. Let's swap R1 and R3.\n[s, 0]\n[-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n[s^2 + s, -s]\n[-s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 2:** Use the new R1 = [s, 0] to eliminate the s^2 and s terms in the first column of other rows.\n*   Replace R2 with R2 + s*R1: [-s^2 - 1 + s(s), s^2 + s(0)] = [-1, s^2]\n*   Replace R3 with R3 - (s+1)*R1: [s^2 + s - (s+1)s, -s - (s+1)0] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s] = [0, -s]\n*   Replace R4 with R4 + R1: [-s - 1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n[s, 0]\n[-1, s^2]\n[0, -s]\n[-1, 1]\n\n**Step 3:** The matrix is getting simpler. Let's continue to eliminate terms.\n*   Replace R1 with R1 + s*R4: [s + s(-1), 0 + s(1)] = [0, s]\n*   Replace R2 with R2 - R4: [-1 - (-1), s^2 - 1] = [0, s^2 - 1]\n\nThe matrix is now:\n[0, s]\n[0, s^2 - 1]\n[0, -s]\n[-1, 1]\n\n**Step 4:** The first and third rows are linearly dependent.\n*   Replace R1 with R1 + R3: [0 + 0, s + (-s)] =\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n\n[0, s^2 - 1]\n[0, -s]\n[-1, 1]\n\n**Step 5:** Use the third row to simplify the second row.\n*   Replace R2 with R2 + s*R3: [0 + s(0), s^2 - 1 + s(-s)] = [0, s^2 - 1 - s^2] = [0, -1]\n\nThe matrix is now:\n\n[0, -1]\n[0, -s]\n[-1, 1]\n\n**Step 6:** Use the new second row to simplify the third and fourth rows.\n*   Replace R3 with R3 - s*R2: [0 - s(0), -s - s(-1)] = [0, -s + s] =\n*   Replace R4 with R4 + R2: [-1 + 0, 1 + (-1)] = [-1, 0]\n\nThe matrix is finally reduced to:\n\n[0, -1]\n\n[-1, 0]\n\nThe non-zero rows are [0, -1] and [-1, 0]. A greatest common right divisor is the matrix formed by these non-zero rows. Let's call it G'.\nG' = [0, -1; -1, 0]\n\nWe can further simplify this by elementary row operations to get it into a canonical form (row-echelon form):\n1.  Swap the two rows: [-1, 0; 0, -1]\n2.  Multiply each row by -1: [1, 0; 0, 1]\n\nThis final matrix is the identity matrix, I. Since these operations are unimodular, the resulting matrix is also a GCRD.\n\nLet G = [1, 0; 0, 1].\nWe can verify that G is a common right divisor:\nP1 = Q1 * G  => Q1 = P1, which is a polynomial matrix.\nP2 = Q2 * G  => Q2 = P2, which is a polynomial matrix.\n\nSo, G = I is a common right divisor.\n\nA GCRD is a common right divisor D such that any other common right divisor D' is a left multiple of D (i.e., D' = U*D for some polynomial matrix U). If we take the identity matrix I as our GCRD, then for any other common right divisor D', we have D' = D'*I. This holds, and D' is a polynomial matrix. Therefore, the identity matrix is a greatest common right divisor.\n\nA matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant is called a unimodular matrix. The GCRD we found is the identity matrix, which is unimodular. When the GCRD of two polynomial matrices is unimodular, the matrices are said to be right co-prime.\n\n<<<[1, 0;\n0, 1]>>>"
