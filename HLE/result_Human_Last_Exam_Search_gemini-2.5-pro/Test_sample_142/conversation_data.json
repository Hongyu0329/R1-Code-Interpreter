    "To find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using the 6-31G** basis set, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Electrons\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of electrons in the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 electrons\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 1 electron × 3 atoms = 3 electrons\n*   **Silicon (Si):** 14 electrons\n*   **Fluorine (F):** 9 electrons\n\nThe total number of electrons (Nₑ) is 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32.\n\nFor a singlet ground state (total spin S=0), the number of alpha-spin electrons (nₐ) is equal to the number of beta-spin electrons (nᵦ).\n*   **K = nₐ = nᵦ = 32 / 2 = 16**\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Total Number of Basis Functions\n\nNext, we determine the number of basis functions (atomic orbitals) for each atom using the 6-31G** basis set. The `**` notation is equivalent to `(d,p)`, meaning d-type polarization functions are added to heavy atoms and p-type polarization functions are added to hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The 6-31G part provides a split-valence s-shell (1s, 1s'), and the `**` adds a set of three p-functions. This gives 2s + 3p = **5 basis functions** per H atom.\n*   **Carbon (C):** As a second-row atom, the 6-31G part accounts for 9 functions. The `*` adds a set of six d-type polarization functions. This gives 9 + 6d = **15 basis functions**.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** Like carbon, fluorine is a second-row atom and will have the same number of basis functions: **15 basis functions**.\n*   **Silicon (Si):** As a third-row atom, the 6-31G basis provides 13 functions. The `*` adds a set of six d-type polarization functions. This gives 13 + 6d = **19 basis functions**.\n\nThe total number of basis functions (N), which corresponds to the number of spatial orbitals, is the sum for all atoms in the molecule ($\\mathrm{C} + 3\\mathrm{H} + \\mathrm{Si} + \\mathrm{F}$):\n*   **N = 15 (C) + 3×5 (H) + 19 (Si) + 15 (F) = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64**\n\nSo, we have a problem of distributing 32 electrons among 64 spatial orbitals.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Singlet CSFs\n\nA Full CI calculation includes all possible ways of distributing the electrons among the available orbitals. For a singlet state (S=0), the number of CSFs is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula.\nThe formula is:\nNumber of CSFs = $\\binom{N}{K}^2 - \\binom{N}{K-1} \\binom{N}{K+1}$\n\nWhere:\n*   N = Total number of spatial orbitals = 64\n*   K = Number of alpha (or beta) electrons = 16\n\nWe need to calculate the following binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16! \\cdot (64-16)!} = 492,492,033,266,496$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15! \\cdot (64-15)!} = 160,813,275,791,360$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17! \\cdot (64-17)!} = 1,389,859,881,924,480$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the formula:\nNumber of CSFs = $(492,492,033,266,496)^2 - (160,813,275,791,360 \\times 1,389,859,881,924,480)$\nNumber of CSFs = $242,548,450,125,633,830,283,282,432 - 223,512,163,934,331,135,004,160,000$\nNumber of CSFs = $19,036,286,191,302,695,279,122,432$\n\nThis number is approximately 1.9036 x 10²⁶.\n\n<<<19036286191302695279122432>>>"
