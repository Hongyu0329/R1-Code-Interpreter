    "The SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` describes a large, planar molecule with a high degree of symmetry. This molecule is a type of triangular nanographene that is functionalized with ethynyl groups at its three corners.\n\nTo determine the symmetry group, we analyze the symmetry elements of the molecule:\n*   **Principal Axis of Rotation (C₃):** The molecule has a threefold rotational axis perpendicular to its plane and passing through its center. Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) results in an identical representation.\n*   **Perpendicular C₂ Axes:** There are three twofold rotational axes (C₂) that lie in the plane of the molecule. Each of these axes passes through the center and one of the corners of the triangular structure.\n*   **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σₙ):** A horizontal mirror plane lies in the plane of the molecule itself. Since the molecule is planar, reflecting it through this plane leaves it unchanged.\n*   **Vertical Mirror Planes (σᵥ):** There are three vertical mirror planes, each containing the principal C₃ axis and one of the C₂ axes.\n*   **Improper Rotation Axis (S₃):** The molecule also possesses a threefold improper rotation axis.\n\nA molecule that has a C₃ principal axis, three perpendicular C₂ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane belongs to the **D₃ₙ point group**. This is a common point group for trigonal planar molecules like boron trifluoride (BF₃).\n\n<<<D₃ₕ>>>"
