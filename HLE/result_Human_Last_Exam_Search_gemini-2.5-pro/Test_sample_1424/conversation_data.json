    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, for a non-interacting system exhibits a direct and fundamental functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This relationship can be explicitly derived by evaluating the path integral for a free theory. The result is typically expressed in frequency-momentum space.\n\nFor a system of non-interacting fermions, the action, S, in the path integral is quadratic in the fermion fields. This allows the path integral to be calculated exactly. The bare Green's function, which is the two-point correlation function for these non-interacting particles, can be obtained by taking functional derivatives of the generating functional or by direct evaluation.\n\nThe resulting functional form of the bare Green's function (G_0) in frequency (ω) and momentum (k) space is:\n\n**G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)**\n\nHere:\n*   **G_0(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function.\n*   **ω** represents the frequency.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum k.\n*   **iδ** is an infinitesimal imaginary term that ensures the correct causal structure of the propagator, with δ being a small positive number. For retarded Green's functions, it dictates that the poles of G_0 are slightly shifted into the lower half of the complex frequency plane.\n\nThis expression reveals that the bare Green's function has poles in the complex frequency plane at the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. The physical interpretation is that the system can readily absorb or emit energy corresponding to the energies of its single-particle states.\n\nIn the imaginary-time (Matsubara) formalism, which is often used in statistical mechanics, the bare Green's function for fermions takes a similar form:\n\n**G_0(k, iω_n) = 1 / (iω_n - ϵ_k)**\n\nIn this case:\n*   **iω_n** are the fermionic Matsubara frequencies, given by iω_n = i(2n + 1)πT, where n is an integer and T is the temperature.\n*   The relationship shows that the bare Green's function is a simple rational function of the single-particle energy ϵ_k and the Matsubara frequency.\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is an inverse relationship, where G_0 is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (real or imaginary) and the energy eigenvalue.\n\n<<<**G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)** or **G_0(k, iω_n) = 1 / (iω_n - ϵ_k)**>>>"
