    "The reaction between butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a type of pericyclic reaction called a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. In this reaction, the conjugated diene (butadiene) reacts with the alkene, which is referred to as the dienophile, to form a six-membered ring.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in a single, concerted step where two new carbon-carbon single bonds are formed simultaneously. The four pi electrons from the diene and the two pi electrons from the dienophile rearrange to create a more stable cyclohexene derivative.\n\nThe product of this specific reaction is **4,4-dichloro-3,3-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the bond changes:\n*   The C1 and C4 carbons of 1,3-butadiene each form a new single bond with the two carbons of the 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene double bond.\n*   The double bond that was between C1-C2 and C3-C4 in butadiene is eliminated.\n*   A new double bond forms between the C2 and C3 carbons of the original butadiene molecule.\n*   The double bond in 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene becomes a single bond.\n*   The two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms remain attached to their original carbon atoms in the newly formed ring.\n\nWhile the Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition is the expected outcome, it's worth noting that under certain conditions, particularly with highly fluorinated or chlorinated ethenes, [2+2] cycloadditions can sometimes compete or become the dominant pathway, potentially forming a cyclobutane derivative. However, the Diels-Alder reaction is a very common and reliable method for forming six-membered rings.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-3,3-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
