    "An American in Paris, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, was the first film to hold that honor to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The film features an extended ballet sequence set in a stylized version of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, the location of one of the two Luxor Obelisks.\n\nThe elaborate, seventeen-minute ballet finale of the musical showcases sets designed in the styles of various French painters. This sequence opens in a representation of the Place de la Concorde inspired by the work of artist Raoul Dufy. Descriptions of the scene highlight the fountain of the Place de la Concorde as a central element of the dance floor. The Luxor Obelisk is the monumental centerpiece of this famous Parisian square.\n\nWhile earlier Best Picture winners, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), were set in Paris, there is no evidence that they featured the Place de la Concorde. Other winners that did depict the location, such as *Gigi* (1958), were released after *An American in Paris*. Therefore, *An American in Paris* is the first Best Picture winner to feature a depiction of the iconic landmark.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
