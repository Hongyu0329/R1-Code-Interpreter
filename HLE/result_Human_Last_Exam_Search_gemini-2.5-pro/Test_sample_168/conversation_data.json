    "To determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches, one must first understand the nature of the sound produced by muscle contractions and then compare it to the hearing ranges of the animals listed.\n\nSustained human muscle contractions produce low-frequency audible vibrations. Studies show this sound is periodic with a frequency of around 25 +/- 2.5 Hz. Some research indicates that fast-twitch muscle fibers can produce sounds from 30 to 70 Hz, while slow-twitch fibers generate sounds between 10 and 30 Hz. Therefore, the animal in question would need to have exceptional low-frequency hearing.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the hearing capabilities of the animals in the answer choices:\n*   **Human:** The commonly accepted range for human hearing is 20 to 20,000 Hz. While the 25 Hz frequency of muscle twitches is technically within the lower limit of human hearing, the sound is generally too faint for humans to perceive without amplification, such as with an electronic stethoscope.\n*   **Dog:** A dog's hearing range is typically between 67 Hz and 45,000 Hz. Other sources suggest a range of 40 Hz to 60,000 Hz. In either case, the lower limit of a dog's hearing is generally above the primary frequency of muscle twitches, making it an unlikely candidate.\n*   **Bat:** Bats are known for their exceptional high-frequency hearing, which they use for echolocation. Their hearing can extend up to 200,000 Hz. However, they are not known for sensitive low-frequency hearing; some species cannot hear well below 10,000 Hz, and even the common vampire bat, which has the best low-frequency hearing among bats, can only hear down to about 716 Hz.\n*   **Whale:** Marine mammals have a vast range of hearing. Baleen whales, in particular, are low-frequency specialists, with some species like blue whales hearing sounds as low as 7 Hz. North Atlantic right whales are estimated to hear from 10 Hz to 22 kHz. Given their proven ability to hear well within the infrasound range, it is plausible that a whale could detect the low-frequency sounds of muscle contractions.\n*   **Herring:** This fish family possesses a specialized hearing system that connects their swim bladder to their inner ear, significantly enhancing their hearing capabilities. This allows them to detect a wide range of frequencies. Studies have shown that herring can respond to infrasonic sounds down to 5 Hz and have a low hearing threshold for frequencies between 30 and 1,200 Hz. This sensitivity to very low-frequency sounds makes the herring a strong candidate for being able to detect the faint sounds of muscle twitches.\n\nComparing the options, both whales and herring have hearing ranges that cover the low frequencies produced by muscle twitches. However, the herring family is noted for being \"hearing specialists\" with particular sensitivity in the low-frequency range where these sounds occur.\n\n<<<C>>>"
