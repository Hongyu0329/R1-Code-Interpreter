To determine the density profile of the interacting gas mixture, we must account for the combined effects of the gravitational potential and the intermolecular forces described by the van der Waals model. The equilibrium density distribution is governed by the principles of statistical mechanics, specifically the Boltzmann distribution, applied in a self-consistent manner.

### Theoretical Framework

The density profile of each gas component at a constant temperature `T` is determined by the Boltzmann distribution, which states that the number density `n_i(z)` of species `i` (where `i` can be Gas A or Gas B) at a height `z` is proportional to the exponent of the negative potential energy `U_i(z)` of a single particle at that height, divided by the thermal energy `k_B T`.

`n_i(z) = n_i(0) \exp\left(-\frac{U_i(z)}{k_B T}\right)`

Here, `n_i(0)` is the number density at the reference height `z=0`, and `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.

The total potential energy `U_i(z)` for a single particle has two main contributions:

1.  **Gravitational Potential Energy (`U_g`):** This is the energy a particle has due to its position in the uniform gravitational field.
    `U_{g,i}(z) = m_i g z`
    where `m_i` is the mass of one particle of species `i` (`m_i = M_i / N_{Av}`, with `N_{Av}` being Avogadro's number) and `g` is the gravitational acceleration.

2.  **Mean-Field Interaction Potential (`U_{int}`):** The van der Waals `a` parameter accounts for the attractive forces between particles. In a mean-field approximation, the potential energy of a single particle `i` at height `z` due to its attractive interactions with all surrounding particles is proportional to the local number densities of the gas components.
    `U_{\text{int},i}(z) = -2 \sum_{j=A,B} a'_{ij} n_j(z)`
    where `a'_{ij}` are the van der Waals interaction parameters converted to a per-particle basis (`a'_{ij} = a_{ij} / N_{Av}^2`). This term represents the average potential well a particle "feels" from its neighbors.

The van der Waals `b` parameter, which accounts for the finite volume of particles, is an entropic effect and is not included in this potential energy formulation.

### Self-Consistent Equations for Density Profile

Combining the potential energy terms, the total potential for a particle of species `i` is:
`U_i(z) = m_i g z - 2 \left( a'_{iA} n_A(z) + a'_{iB} n_B(z) \right)`

Substituting this into the Boltzmann distribution gives a system of coupled, self-consistent equations for the number density profiles of Gas A and Gas B:

1.  `n_A(z) = n_A(0) \exp\left( -\frac{m_A g z - 2 \left( a'_{AA} n_A(z) + a'_{AB} n_B(z) \right)}{k_B T} \right)`
2.  `n_B(z) = n_B(0) \exp\left( -\frac{m_B g z - 2 \left( a'_{AB} n_A(z) + a'_{BB} n_B(z) \right)}{k_B T} \right)`

These equations are "self-consistent" because the density `n_i(z)` on the left-hand side appears implicitly within the potential term on the right-hand side.

### Normalization Condition

The reference densities `n_A(0)` and `n_B(0)` are not free parameters. They are determined by the constraint that the total number of particles of each species in the container is fixed:

*   `\int_0^H A \cdot n_A(z) \,dz = N_A`
*   `\int_0^H A \cdot n_B(z) \,dz = N_B`

where `H` is the height of the cylinder and `A` is its cross-sectional area. This system of coupled, transcendental integral equations must be solved numerically to find the explicit functions `n_A(z)` and `n_B(z)`.

### The Final Density Profile `ρ(z)`

Once the number density profiles `n_A(z)` and `n_B(z)` are determined by solving the system of equations above, the total mass density profile `ρ(z)` of the gas mixture is found by summing the mass contributions from each component:

`\rho(z) = m_A n_A(z) + m_B n_B(z)`

This `ρ(z)` is the final expression for the density profile of the mixture as a function of height, incorporating gravity and the non-ideal interactions between the gas particles. Due to the complexity of the governing equations, an analytical, closed-form solution is not feasible. The determination of the profile consists of this set of defining equations.
