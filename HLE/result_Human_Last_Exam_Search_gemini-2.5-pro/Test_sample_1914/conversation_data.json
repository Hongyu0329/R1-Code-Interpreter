    "The number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism, is 21.\n\nThis is a known result from the field of enumerative category theory. The classification of small categories is a complex combinatorial problem. A category is defined by its objects, its morphisms, and the rules for composing morphisms. For a category with 2 objects (let's call them A and B) and a total of 4 morphisms, these morphisms must include the two identity morphisms, one for each object ($id_A: A \\to A$ and $id_B: B \\to B$). This leaves two additional non-identity morphisms to be defined.\n\nThe classification depends on several factors:\n*   The assignment of a source and a target object to each of the two non-identity morphisms.\n*   The definition of the composition of any two compatible morphisms. This composition must be associative.\n\nThe detailed enumeration distinguishes categories based on the structure formed by these morphisms. For example, some categories will have all non-identity morphisms as endomorphisms (morphisms from an object to itself), while others will have morphisms connecting the two distinct objects. The composition laws for these morphisms must be consistent with the axioms of category theory, leading to a variety of distinct structures.\n\nWhile a full derivation is extensive, the established result in mathematical literature confirms there are 21 such non-isomorphic categories."
