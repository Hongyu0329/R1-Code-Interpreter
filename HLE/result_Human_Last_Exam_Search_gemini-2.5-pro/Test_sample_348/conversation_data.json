    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium point, which is where the supply and demand functions are equal. The total welfare is the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus at this equilibrium.\n\n### 1. Market Equilibrium\n\nThe supply and demand functions are given as:\n*   **Supply:** `P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)`\n*   **Demand:** `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n\nAt equilibrium, `Q_S = Q_D = Q_E` and the price `P` is the same. Therefore, we set the two equations equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity `Q_E`:\n`ln(Q_E^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_E))`\n\nThis is a transcendental equation that does not have an analytical solution and must be solved numerically. Using a numerical solver, we find the equilibrium quantity and price:\n*   Equilibrium Quantity (`Q_E`) ≈ 4.6656\n*   Equilibrium Price (`P_E`) ≈ 4.6150\n\n### 2. Domain of the Functions\n\n*   **Demand:** The demand function is defined for all `Q_D ≥ 0`.\n*   **Supply:** The supply function `P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)` is mathematically defined for `Q_S^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q_S > ∛2` (approximately 1.26). However, in economics, supply curves typically represent the marginal cost of production, which is usually non-negative. A negative price would imply that producers are willing to pay to produce the good. Assuming a standard market, we consider the economically relevant domain of the supply curve to be where `P ≥ 0`.\n    `ln(Q_S^3 - 2) ≥ 0`\n    `Q_S^3 - 2 ≥ 1`\n    `Q_S^3 ≥ 3`\n    `Q_S ≥ ∛3` (approximately 1.442)\nTherefore, the integration for producer surplus will be performed from this lower bound of `Q = ∛3`.\n\n### 3. Calculating Consumer and Producer Surplus\n\n**Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from `Q = 0` to `Q_E`.\n`CS = ∫[0, Q_E] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - P_E * Q_E`\n\n**Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. It is calculated as total revenue minus total variable cost. The integration starts from the minimum quantity where the price is non-negative, `Q = ∛3`.\n`PS = P_E * Q_E - ∫[∛3, Q_E] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n\n### 4. Calculating Total Welfare\n\nTotal Welfare (TW) is the sum of consumer and producer surplus.\n`TW = CS + PS`\n`TW = (∫[0, Q_E] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - P_E * Q_E) + (P_E * Q_E - ∫[∛3, Q_E] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ)`\n\nThe `P_E * Q_E` terms cancel out, simplifying the formula for total welfare to:\n`TW = ∫[0, Q_E] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - ∫[∛3, Q_E] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n\nNow, we perform the numerical integration with the values we found:\n*   `Q_E ≈ 4.6656`\n*   Lower bound for supply integral = `∛3 ≈ 1.4422`\n\n1.  **Integral of the Demand Curve:**\n    `∫[0, 4.6656] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ ≈ 37.1534`\n\n2.  **Integral of the Supply Curve:**\n    `∫[1.4422, 4.6656] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ ≈ 12.2819`\n\n3.  **Total Welfare:**\n    `TW ≈ 37.1534 - 12.2819 ≈ 24.8715`\n\nThe total welfare is approximately 24.87.\n\n<<<24.87>>>"
