    "For the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, the underlying quiver is a Dynkin quiver of type $A_3$. For such hereditary algebras, the concepts of $\\tau$-tilting modules and tilting modules coincide. A tilting module is a module $T$ with three (since there are three simple modules) non-isomorphic indecomposable summands, such that $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T) = 0$.\n\nA slice module is a specific type of tilting module. For a hereditary algebra, a tilting module $T$ is a slice module if and only if its endomorphism algebra $\\text{End}_A(T)$ is also hereditary. A path algebra is hereditary if and only if its quiver contains no oriented cycles.\n\nThe indecomposable modules over $A$ can be denoted by $[i,j]$ representing the module with socle being the simple module $S_j$ and top being the simple module $S_i$, where $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$.\nThe six indecomposable modules are:\n*   $S_1 = I_1 =$ (simple and injective at vertex 1)\n*   $S_2 =$ (simple at vertex 2)\n*   $S_3 = P_3 =$ (simple and projective at vertex 3)\n*   $I_2 =$ (injective at vertex 2)\n*   $P_2 =$ (projective at vertex 2)\n*   $P_1 = I_3 =$ (projective and injective, corresponding to vertex 1 and 3 respectively)\n\nThe algebra $A$ has five tilting modules. Four of these are slice modules, arising from iterated APR-tilts. These are:\n1.  $P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3 = \\oplus \\oplus$ (the projective generator)\n2.  $I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3 = \\oplus \\oplus$ (the injective cogenerator)\n3.  $P_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus P_3 = \\oplus \\oplus$\n4.  $I_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus I_3 = \\oplus \\oplus$ (This module is the answer)\nWait, let me list the tilting modules correctly. The APR tilting modules are known to be slice modules because their endomorphism rings are path algebras of other $A_3$ quivers, which are hereditary. There is one tilting module which is not an APR-tilt.\n\nThis unique non-slice tilting module is $T = S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus P_1$.\nIn the notation used above, this is $T = \\oplus \\oplus$.\n\nLet's verify this:\n1.  **It is a tilting module**: It has 3 summands and all indecomposable $A_3$-modules have projective dimension at most 1. A detailed calculation shows that $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T)=0$.\n2.  **It is not a slice module**: To see this, we can compute its endomorphism algebra, $B = \\text{End}_A(T)$. The quiver of $B$ has vertices corresponding to the summands of $T$, which we can label 1, 2, 3 for $$, $$, and $$ respectively. The arrows are given by irreducible maps:\n    *   $\\text{Hom}_A(,) \\neq 0$ (an arrow $3 \\to 1$)\n    *   $\\text{Hom}_A(,) \\neq 0$ (an arrow $3 \\to 2$)\n    *   $\\text{Hom}_A(,) \\neq 0$ (an arrow $1 \\to 3$)\n    All other $\\text{Hom}$-spaces between non-identical summands are zero. The quiver for $B$ therefore contains a 2-cycle ($1 \\to 3 \\to 1$). An algebra whose quiver contains an oriented cycle is not hereditary. Thus, $B$ is not a hereditary algebra, which implies that $T$ is not a slice module.\n\nSince all other tilting modules for $A_3$ are APR-tilts and thus are slice modules, this one is unique.\n\n<<<The direct sum of the simple module at vertex 1, the simple module at vertex 2, and the projective module at vertex 1, which can be written as $S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus P_1$ or, in another common notation, $ \\oplus \\oplus$.>>>"
