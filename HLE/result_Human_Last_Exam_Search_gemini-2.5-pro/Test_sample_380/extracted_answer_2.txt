The local magnetic field is not considered radial at the L1 point. The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction to calculate normalized magnetic helicity is a consequence of applying Taylor's hypothesis to single-spacecraft data, where the measurement direction is assumed to be along the nearly-radial solar wind flow. The discrepancy is resolved in detailed analysis by considering the angle between the solar wind velocity and the local magnetic field or by transforming the data into a field-aligned coordinate system to properly isolate the wave's perpendicular components.
