    "After a thorough search, there is no widely documented scene in a major Hollywood feature film that precisely matches the description of a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car.\n\nWhile numerous films feature teenagers, bicycles, and cars, and some even include scenes of playing \"chicken,\" the specific combination of a teenager on a *pink bike* in a direct standoff with an approaching vehicle in a film produced by a major studio could not be definitively identified through the search.\n\nOnline forums and movie databases contain discussions of similar scenarios, but none point to a specific, verifiable scene in a major Hollywood production. It is possible that the scene in question is from a lesser-known independent film, a made-for-television movie, a foreign film, or that the details of the scene as remembered are a composite from different sources.\n\nFor instance, a photoshoot for the upcoming reboot of \"The Naked Gun\" featured actor Liam Neeson on a pink bicycle, but this is not a scene from a released film. Similarly, discussions on forums bring up various movies where characters are hit by cars while on bikes, but the specific details of a teenager on a pink bike in a direct confrontation are absent.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, a specific major Hollywood feature film with this exact scene cannot be named.\n\n<<<I am unable to definitively identify a Hollywood feature film from a major studio with the scene described.>>>"
