    "Of the words provided, Geoffrey Chaucer does not make a rhyme with \"countour\" in *The Book of the Duchess*.\n\nA textual search of various scholarly editions of *The Book of the Duchess* shows that the word \"countour\" (an archaic term for an accountant or auditor) does not appear in the poem. Therefore, it cannot be rhymed within the work. The word does appear in some manuscripts and online transcriptions, often around lines 434-435, but this is a known error, confusing the text with Chaucer's translation of *The Romance of the Rose* where \"countour\" is used.\n\nThe other words listed can be found in rhyming positions within the poem:\n*   **Wente** is rhymed with words like \"stente\" (stopped).\n*   **Here** is a common word used in rhymes, often paired with words like \"dere\" (dear) or \"chere\" (face, expression).\n*   **Fool** and **Hool** (whole) are used as a rhyming pair in the poem.\n\nSince \"countour\" is not present in the authentic text of *The Book of the Duchess*, it is the word that Chaucer does not rhyme in the poem.\n\n<<<E>>>"
