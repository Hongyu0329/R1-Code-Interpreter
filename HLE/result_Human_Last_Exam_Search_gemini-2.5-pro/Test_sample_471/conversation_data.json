    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is determined by the topology of the torus itself. The answer can be found using principles from Morse theory and Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory.\n\n### Key Theoretical Results\n\n1.  **Morse Theory**: For a special class of smooth functions called Morse functions (whose critical points are all non-degenerate), the number of critical points is related to the Betti numbers of the manifold. The strong Morse inequalities state that for a Morse function on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must be greater than or equal to the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k(M)$.\n    *   For the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, and $b_2=1$.\n    *   This implies that any Morse function on the torus must have at least one minimum ($c_0 \\ge 1$), at least two saddle points ($c_1 \\ge 2$), and at least one maximum ($c_2 \\ge 1$).\n    *   The total number of critical points must therefore be at least $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\n2.  **Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Theory**: This theory provides a lower bound for the number of critical points for any continuous function on a compact manifold, not just Morse functions. It states that the number of critical points is at least the *Lusternik-Schnirelmann category* of the manifold plus one.\n    *   The LS category of the n-torus, $T^n$, is $n+1$.\n    *   For the 2-torus, $T^2$, the LS category is $2+1=3$.\n    *   Therefore, according to the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem, any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least $3+1 = 4$ critical points.\n\n### Construction of a Function with the Minimal Number of Points\n\nIt is possible to construct a smooth function on the 2-torus that has exactly four critical points. A common example is the \"height function\" on a torus embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ in a tilted position. If the torus is perfectly horizontal, the critical points form degenerate circles. However, a slight tilt breaks this degeneracy and results in four isolated, non-degenerate critical points: a minimum, a maximum, and two saddle points. This confirms that the lower bound of 4 is achievable.\n\n### Functions with Fewer Critical Points\n\nWhile a *Morse function* on a torus must have at least four critical points, it is possible to construct a smooth function with only three critical points if one of them is degenerate. An example is the function $f(x,y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$ on the torus defined as $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2$. This function has a minimum, a maximum, and a single degenerate saddle point. However, the question of the minimal number of critical points for a *general* smooth function is typically answered by the Lusternik-Schnirelmann bound, which holds for all smooth functions and gives a minimum of 4. Some sources assert the minimum is 3, achieved with a degenerate critical point, while others state it is 4 based on LS-category. The discrepancy often depends on whether degenerate points are considered in the minimal counting. In the context of generic functions (which can be approximated by Morse functions), the stable number is 4.\n\nBased on the robust results from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, which applies to all smooth functions, the minimal number is established as 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
