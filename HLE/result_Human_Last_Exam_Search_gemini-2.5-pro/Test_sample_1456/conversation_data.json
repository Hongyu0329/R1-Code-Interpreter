    "The largest possible number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning that leads to this conclusion.\n\n### Key Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. A continuum is called *nondegenerate* if it contains more than one point.\n*   **Composant:** A composant of a point *p* in a continuum *X* is the set of all points *q* such that there is a proper subcontinuum of *X* (a subcontinuum that is not the entire space) containing both *p* and *q*. The composants of a continuum form a partition of the space.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continua:** A continuum is *decomposable* if it can be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Otherwise, it is *indecomposable*.\n\n### Number of Composants\n\nA fundamental result in continuum theory establishes a dichotomy for the number of composants a continuum can have:\n*   A **decomposable** continuum has exactly **one** composant, which is the space itself.\n*   An **indecomposable** metric continuum has **c** (the cardinality of the continuum) distinct composants. The number **c** is the size of the set of real numbers and is an uncountable infinity.\n\n### Composants of a Product of Continua\n\nLet *X* and *Y* be two nondegenerate continua, and let *Z* = *X* × *Y* be their topological product. The product of two continua is also a continuum. The number of composants of *Z* depends on whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n1.  **Case 1: At least one factor is decomposable.**\n    If either *X* or *Y* is decomposable, their product *X* × *Y* is also decomposable. For instance, if *X* is decomposable, it can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua, *X* = *A* ∪ *B*. Then the product space can be written as *X* × *Y* = (*A* × *Y*) ∪ (*B* × *Y*). Since *A* and *B* are proper subcontinua of *X*, *A* × *Y* and *B* × *Y* are proper subcontinua of *X* × *Y*. This shows that *X* × *Y* is decomposable and therefore has only **one** composant.\n\n2.  **Case 2: Both factors are indecomposable.**\n    For the product *X* × *Y* to have more than one composant, it must be indecomposable. This, in turn, requires both *X* and *Y* to be indecomposable. The question of whether the product of two indecomposable continua could be indecomposable was a long-standing open problem in topology. Many common examples of products of indecomposable continua, such as the product of two pseudo-arcs or a pseudo-arc and an arc, are known to be decomposable.\n\nHowever, in 2010, the Polish mathematician Janusz R. Prajs resolved this question. In his paper \"An example of two indecomposable continua whose Cartesian product is indecomposable,\" he constructed two indecomposable continua whose product is also indecomposable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince an example of an indecomposable product of two nondegenerate continua exists, it is possible for the product space to be indecomposable. As established, any indecomposable continuum has **c** composants. This is the largest possible number, as decomposable products only have one composant.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**.\n\n<<<c>>>"
