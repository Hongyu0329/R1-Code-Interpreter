    "The analysis I performed seems to be correct and is confirmed by the search results.\n\n1.  **Existence and Monotonicity**: A continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ must be injective because $\\exp(x)$ is injective. A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic.\n\n2.  **Decreasing Case**: If $f$ were strictly decreasing, it would have to have a fixed point. However, if $f(x_0) = x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = x_0$, which means $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. The equation $\\exp(x) = x$ has no real solutions. This is a contradiction, so no decreasing continuous solutions exist.\n\n3.  **Increasing Case**: If $f$ is strictly increasing, solutions exist. One can construct these solutions. A key observation is that $f$ cannot have any fixed points, and it can be shown that $f(x) > x$ for all $x$. The construction of a solution involves choosing an initial function segment and then extending it over the entire real line using the functional equation.\n\n4.  **Construction and Cardinality**: The construction of a strictly increasing solution can be outlined as follows:\n    *   Choose a value for $a = f(0)$. It can be shown that $a$ must be in the interval $(0, 1)$.\n    *   Choose a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi$ that maps the interval $[0, a]$ to $[a, 1]$, such that $\\phi(0) = a$ and $\\phi(a) = 1$.\n    *   This initial choice of $\\phi$ on $[0, a]$ uniquely determines the function $f$ over all of $\\mathbb{R}$ by using the relation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ to extend the definition to adjacent intervals.\n\n5.  **Counting the Solutions**: The number of solutions corresponds to the number of possible choices in the construction.\n    *   The number of choices for $a \\in (0, 1)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $c = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n    *   For each fixed $a$, the number of possible choices for the function $\\phi$ is also $c$. We can see this by, for example, choosing an arbitrary value $y \\in (a, 1)$ for $\\phi(a/2)$, and for each such choice, a continuous strictly increasing function can be constructed (e.g., by connecting points with straight lines). Since there are $c$ choices for $y$, there are at least $c$ such functions $\\phi$.\n    *   The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for $a$ and the number of choices for $\\phi$. This gives $c \\times c = c$ solutions.\n\n6.  **Upper Bound**: The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $c$. This is because a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on the dense set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, the cardinality of the set of continuous functions is $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = c^{\\aleph_0} = c$. The set of solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions, so its cardinality is at most $c$.\n\nSince we have constructed $c$ solutions and the total number of continuous functions is $c$, the cardinality of the set of solutions must be $c$.\n\nFinal answer is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $c$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\n<<<c>>>"
