    "The number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is 119.\n\nThis result is derived from a recursive formula for the number of subgroups of index 2<sup>n</sup> in the Grigorchuk group, as established by Andrei Jaikin-Zapirain in his paper \"On the subgroup growth of the Grigorchuk group\". The number of subgroups of a given index *m* in a group G is denoted by *s<sub>m</sub>*(G). For the Grigorchuk group, *s<sub>m</sub>*(G) is zero if *m* is not a power of 2.\n\nLet *a<sub>n</sub>* = *s<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub>*(G). The recursive formula is given by:\n*a<sub>n</sub>* = (2<sup>n</sup> - 1)*a<sub>n-1</sub>* + 2<sup>n-1</sup>*a<sub>n-1</sub>*<sup>2</sup>\n\nFor *n*=1, the number of subgroups of index 2 (*a*<sub>1</sub>) is 7. This is because the abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is the elementary abelian group of order 8, (C<sub>2</sub>)<sup>3</sup>, which has 7 subgroups of index 2.\n\nTo find the number of subgroups of index 4, we calculate *a*<sub>2</sub>:\n*a*<sub>2</sub> = (2<sup>2</sup> - 1) * *a*<sub>1</sub> + 2<sup>2-1</sup> * *a*<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>\n*a*<sub>2</sub> = (3) * (7) + 2 * (7)<sup>2</sup>\n*a*<sub>2</sub> = 21 + 2 * 49\n*a*<sub>2</sub> = 21 + 98\n*a*<sub>2</sub> = 119\n\nTherefore, the Grigorchuk group has 119 subgroups of index 4.\n\n<<<119>>>"
