    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide results in the formation of 2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile.\n\nThis reaction is a type of Pummerer rearrangement. The process begins with the activation of the sulfoxide by the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This creates a potent sulfonium intermediate. Subsequently, the highly acidic proton on the methyl group adjacent to the sulfur is removed, leading to the formation of a thionium ion. This electrophilic species is then attacked by the cyanide nucleophile, which is delivered from trimethylsilyl cyanide, to yield the final Î±-cyano sulfide product.\n\nThe IUPAC name for the resulting product, which has the chemical structure Ph-S-CH2-CN, is 2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile. This name is derived by identifying acetonitrile as the parent structure and naming the Ph-S- group as a (phenylthio) substituent on the second carbon.\n\n<<<2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile>>>"
