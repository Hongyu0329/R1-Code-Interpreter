    "Here is a systematic breakdown of all possible true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ).\n\nThe evaluation of expressions follows the standard operator precedence: `!` > `&` > `|`. Expressions are evaluated as true if they result in `T`.\n\nWe can categorize the expressions based on their structure.\n\n### Category 1: Expressions without Parentheses (or where parentheses are implied by operator precedence)\n\nThese expressions are formed by combining values (T, F) and operators.\n\n1.  **`v op v op v`** (3 values, 2 operators; e.g., `T & F | T`) - Total length is 5.\n    *   `A & B & C`: This is true only if A, B, and C are all True. This gives one expression: `T & T & T`.\n    *   `A & B | C`: Parsed as `(A & B) | C`. This is true if C is true (4 combinations for A, B) or if C is false and `A & B` is true (1 combination: T & T). This gives 5 true expressions.\n    *   `A | B & C`: Parsed as `A | (B & C)`. This is true if A is true (4 combinations for B, C) or if A is false and `B & C` is true (1 combination: T & T). This gives 5 true expressions.\n    *   `A | B | C`: This is true unless A, B, and C are all False. Out of 8 possible combinations, 7 are true.\n    *   *Total for this form: 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = **18***\n\n2.  **`!v op !v`** (2 negated values, 1 operator; e.g., `!T | !F`) - Total length is 5 (`!`, v, op, `!`, v).\n    *   `!F & !F` → `T & T` → `T`\n    *   `!T | !F` → `F | T` → `T`\n    *   `!F | !T` → `T | F` → `T`\n    *   `!F | !F` → `T | T` → `T`\n    *   *Total for this form: **4***\n\n3.  **`!!v op v`** (double-negated value, 1 operator, 1 value; e.g., `!!T & F`) - Total length is 5 (`!`, `!`, v, op, v). `!!T` is equivalent to `T`, and `!!F` is equivalent to `F`.\n    *   `!!T & T` → `T & T` → `T`\n    *   `!!T | T` → `T | T` → `T`\n    *   `!!T | F` → `T | F` → `T`\n    *   `!!F | T` → `F | T` → `T`\n    *   *Total for this form: **4***\n\n4.  **`v op !!v`** (1 value, 1 operator, double-negated value; e.g., `T | !!F`) - Total length is 5. This is symmetric to the previous form.\n    *   `T & !!T` → `T & T` → `T`\n    *   `T | !!T` → `T | T` → `T`\n    *   `T | !!F` → `T | F` → `T`\n    *   `F | !!T` → `F | T` → `T`\n    *   *Total for this form: **4***\n\n### Category 2: Expressions Relying on Parentheses for their Structure\n\nThese expressions use parentheses to group sub-expressions, making up the total length of 5.\n\n5.  **`(v op v)`** (parenthesized expression of length 3; e.g., `(T | F)`) - Total length is 5.\n    *   `(T & T)` → `T`\n    *   `(T | T)` → `T`\n    *   `(T | F)` → `T`\n    *   `(F | T)` → `T`\n    *   *Total for this form: **4***\n\n6.  **`(v) op v`** (parenthesized value, 1 operator, 1 value; e.g., `(T) & T`) - Total length is 5.\n    *   `(T) & T` → `T & T` → `T`\n    *   `(T) | T` → `T | T` → `T`\n    *   `(T) | F` → `T | F` → `T`\n    *   `(F) | T` → `F | T` → `T`\n    *   *Total for this form: **4***\n\n7.  **`v op (v)`** (1 value, 1 operator, parenthesized value; e.g., `T | (F)`) - Total length is 5.\n    *   `T & (T)` → `T & T` → `T`\n    *   `T | (T)` → `T | T` → `T`\n    *   `T | (F)` → `T | F` → `T`\n    *   `F | (T)` → `F | T` → `T`\n    *   *Total for this form: **4***\n\n8.  **`!(!v)`** (e.g., `!(!T)`) - Total length is 5 (`!`, `(`, `!`, v, `)`).\n    *   `!(!T)` → `!(F)` → `T`\n    *   *Total for this form: **1***\n\n9.  **`!!(v)`** (e.g., `!!(T)`) - Total length is 5 (`!`, `!`, `(`, v, `)`).\n    *   `!!(T)` → `!(!T)` → `!F` → `T`\n    *   *Total for this form: **1***\n\n10. **`((v))`** (doubly-parenthesized value; e.g., `((T))`) - Total length is 5.\n    *   `((T))` → `(T)` → `T`\n    *   *Total for this form: **1***\n\n11. **`(!!v)`** (parenthesized double-negated value; e.g., `(!!T)`) - Total length is 5.\n    *   `(!!T)` → `(T)` → `T`\n    *   *Total for this form: **1***\n\n### Final Count\n\nSumming the counts from all the distinct valid forms:\n18 (v o v o v) + 4 (!v o !v) + 4 (!!v o v) + 4 (v o !!v) + 4 ((v o v)) + 4 ((v) o v) + 4 (v o (v)) + 1 (!(!v)) + 1 (!!(v)) + 1 (((v))) + 1 ((!!v)) = 46\n\nTherefore, there are 46 such true boolean expressions.\n\n<<<46>>>"
