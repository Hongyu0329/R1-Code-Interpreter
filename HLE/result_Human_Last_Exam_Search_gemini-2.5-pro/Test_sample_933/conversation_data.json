    "The most frequently cited method for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gases. This process is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, in a 1:5 molar ratio, within a sealed nickel vessel. The nickel container is used because it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride, preventing corrosion from the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nMultiple sources state that the optimal temperature for this reaction is 400°C. A patent for this process also specifies a temperature range of 350°C to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature for a quantitative reaction. While other methods and temperatures exist, they can lead to significant contamination with other xenon fluorides like Xenon difluoride (XeF₂). For instance, flow methods can be used at temperatures between 300-500°C, but result in XeF₂ impurities. Therefore, for efficient and relatively pure production of XeF4, 400°C is the well-established temperature.\n\n<<<B>>>"
