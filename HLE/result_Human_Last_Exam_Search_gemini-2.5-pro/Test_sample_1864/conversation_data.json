    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, several types of controls are essential to ensure data accuracy, proper compensation for spectral overlap, and correct gating. Here is a breakdown of the necessary controls for your experiment using Streptavidin beads with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 detection channels.\n\nA minimum of 7 essential controls should be prepared, with a more rigorous experiment including up to 12.\n\n### **Essential Controls (Minimum 7)**\n\n1.  **Unstained Beads (1 control):** This control consists of only the streptavidin beads without any fluorophores. It is crucial for determining the baseline autofluorescence of the beads in all five channels.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 controls):** These are required to correct for the spectral overlap between the fluorochromes. You will need one single-stain control for each of the five fluorochromes in your panel. These are typically prepared using compensation beads, which can bind the fluorescently labeled antibodies. Since your experiment already uses beads, you can use a separate aliquot of beads for each stain:\n    *   Beads + AF350\n    *   Beads + GFP\n    *   Beads + PE\n    *   Beads + AF647\n    *   Beads + AF750\n3.  **Negative/Isotype Control (1 control):** This control helps determine non-specific binding from your staining reagents. In a streptavidin bead-based assay, an ideal negative control would be streptavidin beads incubated with your sample and fluorescent reagents but using an irrelevant biotinylated molecule (isotype control) instead of your specific \"bait\" molecule.\n\n### **Highly Recommended Controls (Additional 5)**\n\n4.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (Up to 5 controls):** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially for sorting and when identifying dim or rare populations. An FMO control includes all the stains in your panel except for one. While you can have an FMO for each channel, they are most crucial for channels where the distinction between positive and negative is ambiguous. For a robust sorting experiment, preparing all five is recommended:\n    *   FMO for AF350 (stained with all except AF350)\n    *   FMO for GFP (stained with all except GFP)\n    *   FMO for PE (stained with all except PE)\n    *   FMO for AF647 (stained with all except AF647)\n    *   FMO for AF750 (stained with all except AF750)\n\nIn summary, you should prepare **7 essential controls**. For the highest level of accuracy and confidence in your sorting, preparing an additional **5 FMO controls** is strongly advised, bringing the total to **12**.\n\n<<<12>>>"
