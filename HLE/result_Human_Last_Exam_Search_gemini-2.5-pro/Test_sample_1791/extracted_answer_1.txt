The effective electron-electron interaction, for a given momentum transfer **q** and Matsubara frequency $i\omega_n$, obtained by integrating out the phonon fields is:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\omega_n) = - \frac{g^2 |\mathbf{q}|^2}{m(\omega_n^2 + w_q^2)}$
where:
*   `g` is the electron-phonon coupling constant.
*   `m` is the mass parameter from the coupling term.
*   `|\mathbf{q}|^2` is the squared magnitude of the momentum transfer vector.
*   `w_q` is the phonon frequency.
*   $\omega_n = 2\pi n / \beta$ is the bosonic Matsubara frequency.

This interaction is attractive.
