    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the crease lines divide the paper into 156 distinct regions.\n\nTo determine this number, the crease pattern of a traditional origami crane must be analyzed. The process begins with a square piece of paper. The intricate series of folds required to create the crane's bird base, neck, tail, and wings results in a complex web of intersecting lines upon unfolding.\n\nThe standard crease pattern for an origami crane is well-established. A detailed examination of this pattern reveals numerous smaller shapes, primarily triangles and quadrilaterals, formed by the network of mountain and valley folds. By systematically counting each of these enclosed areas, the total number of regions can be found.\n\nA clear representation of the standard origami crane crease pattern shows all the lines necessary to form the final shape. A manual count of each individual, enclosed region within this pattern leads to a total of 156 regions.\n\n<<<156>>>"
