    "The problem asks for the number of proper subgroups, up to isomorphism, of the Schur multiplier of a given permutation group $G$. The group $G$ is generated by three permutations, $a$, $b$, and $c$, acting on a set of 12 elements.\n\nFirst, we identify the group $G$. The generators are:\n*   $a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$, an 11-cycle.\n*   $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$, a product of two 4-cycles.\n*   $c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$, a product of six 2-cycles.\n\nThe group $G$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{12}$. The presence of an 11-cycle and its action on 12 elements strongly suggests a connection to the Mathieu groups. The Mathieu group $M_{12}$ is a sporadic simple group of order 95,040, which acts 5-transitively on 12 points. While the provided generators do not immediately match standard representations found in the literature, the structure of their orders (11, 4, and 2) is consistent with elements within $M_{12}$. Given the context of such problems, it is reasonable to assume that $G$ is indeed the Mathieu group $M_{12}$.\n\nThe next step is to determine the Schur multiplier of $G = M_{12}$. The Schur multiplier, denoted as $A$ in the question, is the second homology group $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$. For the Mathieu group $M_{12}$, the Schur multiplier is a cyclic group of order 2. This result was established by Burgoyne and Fong in 1968, correcting an earlier erroneous claim that it was trivial.\n\nSo, the abelian group $A$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, denoted as $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $C_2$.\n\nThe final step is to count the number of proper subgroups of $A \\cong C_2$, up to isomorphism. A proper subgroup of a group is any subgroup other than the group itself. The subgroups of $C_2$ are:\n1.  The trivial subgroup, containing only the identity element. Its order is 1.\n2.  The group $C_2$ itself. Its order is 2.\n\nThe proper subgroups of $C_2$ consist of all subgroups except for $C_2$ itself. In this case, the only proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup.\n\nTherefore, there is only one proper subgroup of the Schur multiplier of $G$. Since we are counting up to isomorphism, and there is only one group of order 1 (the trivial group), there is only one proper subgroup up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<1>>>"
