    "To date, 10 members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans. These include let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202. These mature microRNAs are derived from 12 or 13 precursor genes located at different sites in the human genome.\n\nThe let-7 family is one of the most conserved and largest families of microRNAs, playing a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes. It was one of the first microRNAs to be discovered and is known to act as a tumor suppressor by regulating the expression of oncogenes. While some sources may mention nine members, this is often because miR-202 is sometimes excluded from the core let-7 family in certain contexts. However, more comprehensive genomic and bioinformatic analyses have identified 10 distinct mature let-7 family members in humans.\n\n<<<10>>>"
