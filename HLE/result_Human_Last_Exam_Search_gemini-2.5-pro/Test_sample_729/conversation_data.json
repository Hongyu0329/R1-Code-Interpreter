    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, has a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be formed by taking all elements of G to a certain integer power k (i.e., H = G^k = {g^k | g ∈ G}). To find the number of these subgroups for Q_128, we analyze the structure of the group and the results of raising its elements to various powers.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q_128 has the presentation <x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹>. Its elements consist of two types: those in the cyclic subgroup generated by x, and those outside of it.\n\nThe power subgroups of Q_128 are determined as follows:\n*   **When the power k is an odd integer:** The set of all k-th powers of the elements of Q_128 results in the group Q_128 itself. This gives one power subgroup.\n*   **When the power k is an even integer:** The resulting power subgroup is always a subgroup of the cyclic subgroup <x>. Specifically, for an even power k, the subgroup G^k is of the form <x^d>, where d is an even divisor of 64. The even divisors of 64 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. This gives rise to 6 distinct subgroups: <x²>, <x⁴>, <x⁸>, <x¹⁶>, <x³²>, and the trivial subgroup {1} (which is <x⁶⁴>).\n\nCombining these two cases, we have one subgroup from the odd powers (Q_128 itself) and six subgroups from the even powers. Therefore, the total number of distinct power subgroups is 1 + 6 = 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
