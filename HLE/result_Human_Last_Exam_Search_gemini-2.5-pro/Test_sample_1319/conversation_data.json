    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Parnassus**, with an elevation of 2,457 meters (8,061 feet).\n\nSeveral mountains are referenced in the epic poem, either as settings for divine intervention or as geographical landmarks. Here is a comparison of their heights:\n\n*   **Mount Parnassus:** Located in central Greece, it is the highest among the mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* besides Mount Olympus, standing at 2,457 meters.\n*   **Mount Ida (Crete):** This mountain, the highest on the island of Crete, has an elevation of 2,456 meters. In mythology, it is known as the birthplace of Zeus.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Situated on the Chalkidiki peninsula, this mountain reaches a height of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet).
