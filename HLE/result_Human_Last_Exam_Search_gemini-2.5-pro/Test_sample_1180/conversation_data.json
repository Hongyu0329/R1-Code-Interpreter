    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$ above 2, we must analyze the curve's structure over the 2-adic numbers. The valuation $v$ is the standard 2-adic valuation, normalized so that $v(2)=1$.\n\nFirst, we need to find a suitable model of the curve to study its reduction. The given equation defines a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. To analyze its behavior, including the point at infinity, we can perform a change of variables. Let $x = 1/t$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$z^2 = \\frac{2}{t^5} + \\frac{2}{t^3} + 1 = \\frac{2+2t^2+t^5}{t^5}$\n\nTo obtain a polynomial equation, we introduce a new variable $y = z \\cdot t^3$. This yields:\n$(\\frac{y}{t^3})^2 = \\frac{t^5+2t^2+2}{t^5}$\n$y^2 = t(t^5+2t^2+2)$\n\nThis equation is a standard model for a hyperelliptic curve, and its branch points are the roots of the polynomial $f(t) = t(t^5+2t^2+2)$. The stable reduction of the curve is determined by the 2-adic distances between these branch points. The branch points are $t_0=0$ and the five roots of the quintic polynomial $Q(t) = t^5+2t^2+2=0$.\n\nWe need to find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $Q(t)$. Let $\\beta$ be a root of $Q(t)=0$. By analyzing the 2-adic valuations of the terms of the polynomial, we can deduce the valuation of its roots. The valuations of the terms are $v(t^5) = 5v(t)$, $v(2t^2) = 1+2v(t)$, and $v(2)=1$. For the sum of these terms to be zero, the minimum valuation must be shared by at least two terms, or a cancellation must occur. A careful analysis shows that all five roots $\\beta_i$ of $Q(t)$ must have a 2-adic valuation of $v(\\beta_i) = 1/5$.\n\nNow we can analyze the clustering of the branch points $\\{\\beta_0=0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_5\\}$.\nThe \"distance\" between two branch points $\\beta_i$ and $\\beta_j$ is given by $v(\\beta_i - \\beta_j)$.\n*   For the roots of $Q(t)$, since they all have valuation $1/5$ and their reductions modulo the prime ideal in the corresponding extension field are distinct (they correspond to the distinct fifth roots of unity), the valuation of their differences is also $1/5$. Thus, $v(\\beta_i - \\beta_j) = 1/5$ for $i,j \\in \\{1, \\dots, 5\\}, i \\neq j$.\n*   The distance between the root $\\beta_0=0$ and any of the other roots $\\beta_i$ is $v(\\beta_i - 0) = v(\\beta_i) = 1/5$.\n\nThis means all the branch points form a single \"cluster\" where the pairwise distances are all equal to $1/5$. However, the singularity structure is better understood by considering the squared distances, $v((\\beta_i - \\beta_j)^2)$.\n*   $v((\\beta_i - \\beta_j)^2) = 2v(\\beta_i - \\beta_j) = 2/5$ for $i,j \\in \\{1, \\dots, 5\\}, i \\neq j$.\n*   $v((\\beta_i - 0)^2) = 2v(\\beta_i) = 2/5$.\n\nThe stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve with such a uniform cluster of branch points (where all pairwise squared distances are equal) results in a central rational curve to which components corresponding to each branch point are attached. Each attachment point is a double point, and its thickness is given by this uniform distance value.\n\nThe thickness of the double point in the stable reduction is therefore $2/5$.\n\n<<<2/5>>>"
