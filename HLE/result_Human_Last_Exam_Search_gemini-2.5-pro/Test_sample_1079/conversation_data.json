    "The reflection group of type H3 is the symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron and has an order of 120. Its Coxeter number is 10. The question asks for the number of elements in this group that possess a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue has an order of 10.\n\nAn eigenvector is considered \"regular\" if it does not lie on any of the group's reflection hyperplanes. A key theorem by T. A. Springer establishes that for a regular element—an element possessing a regular eigenvector—the order of the element is the same as the order of the corresponding eigenvalue. Consequently, the question is equivalent to finding the number of elements of order 10 in H3 that have a regular eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue that is a primitive 10th root of unity. Such elements are termed \"10-regular\".\n\nThe group H3 has 24 elements of order 10. These are structured as rotoreflections and are partitioned into two distinct conjugacy classes, each containing 12 elements.\n\nFor well-generated complex reflection groups like H3, a theorem states that for any \"regular number\" `d`, there exists a unique conjugacy class of `d`-regular elements. A number is regular if it is a divisor of one of the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the group. For H3, the degrees are 2, 6, and 10. Since 10 is a divisor of 10, it is a regular number.\n\nThis implies that only one of the two conjugacy classes of elements of order 10 consists of 10-regular elements. This specific class is the conjugacy class of the Coxeter elements. The other class of elements of order 10, while still being regular elements (because their axis of rotation is a regular eigenvector), do not have regular eigenvectors for their order-10 eigenvalues.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements satisfying the condition is the size of a single conjugacy class of elements of order 10.\n\n<<<12>>>"
