    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number 13/16 in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we use the canonical construction defined by John Conway. This method builds a game whose value is a specific dyadic rational number (a fraction with a denominator that is a power of 2).\n\nThe construction is recursive, based on the principle that for a dyadic rational `x = (2m+1)/2^n`, the corresponding game `G(x)` has the form `{G(m/2^(n-1)) | G((m+1)/2^(n-1))}`. This means the game for `x` consists of a new starting point from which a red piece leads to the game for the \"left\" option and a blue piece leads to the game for the \"right\" option.\n\nLet's break down the number 13/16:\n*   **G(13/16):** Here, `13 = 2*6 + 1` and `16 = 2^4`. So, `m=6` and `n=4`. The game is `G(13/16) = {G(6/8) | G(7/8)}`, which simplifies to `{G(3/4) | G(7/8)}`. This adds one red and one blue piece to the pieces required for G(3/4) and G(7/8).\n\nWe continue this decomposition until we reach integers:\n*   **G(7/8):** Here, `7 = 2*3 + 1` and `8 = 2^3`. The game is `G(7/8) = {G(3/4) | G(4/4)}`, which simplifies to `{G(3/4) | G(1)}`. This adds one red and one blue piece.\n*   **G(3/4):** Here, `3 = 2*1 + 1` and `4 = 2^2`. The game is `G(3/4) = {G(1/2) | G(2/2)}`, which simplifies to `{G(1/2) | G(1)}`. This adds one red and one blue piece.\n*   **G(1/2):** Here, `1 = 2*0 + 1` and `2 = 2^1`. The game is `G(1/2) = {G(0/1) | G(1/1)}`, which simplifies to `{G(0) | G(1)}`. This adds one red and one blue piece.\n*   **G(1):** The game for the integer 1 is `{G(0)|}`, which is a single red piece connected to the ground.\n*   **G(0):** The game for 0 is the empty game, requiring no pieces.\n\nTo find the total number of pieces, we can assemble the complete game graph, counting each unique piece once. The graph consists of nodes for each value (`v_0, v_1, v_1/2, v_3/4, v_7/8, v_13/16`) and the edges that connect them.\n\nThe unique pieces are:\n1.  **For G(1):** One red piece connecting `v_1` to ground `v_0`.\n2.  **For G(1/2):** One red piece from `v_1/2` to `v_0` and one blue piece from `v_1/2` to `v_1`. (2 pieces)\n3.  **For G(3/4):** One red piece from `v_3/4` to `v_1/2` and one blue piece from `v_3/4` to `v_1`. (2 pieces)\n4.  **For G(7/8):** One red piece from `v_7/8` to `v_3/4` and one blue piece from `v_7/8` to `v_1`. (2 pieces)\n5.  **For G(13/16):** One red piece from `v_13/16` to `v_3/4` and one blue piece from `v_13/16` to `v_7/8`. (2 pieces)\n\nSumming these pieces gives the total number required for the complete representation of G(13/16). All the sub-games are distinct parts of the final graph, so we add the pieces from each step:\n\nTotal pieces = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9.\n\nThis consists of 5 red pieces and 4 blue pieces.\n\n<<<9>>>"
