    "### VC Dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with 4 Unary Predicates is 4\n\nThe Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the specified first-order logic fragment is 4. This is determined by analyzing the expressive power of the formulas and relating it to the combinatorial concept of shattering sets.\n\nThe VC dimension measures the complexity of a collection of classifiers. In this context, the classifiers are the formulas in the logical fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with one free variable. A formula defines a concept, which is the set of all elements in a given universe that satisfy the formula. The VC dimension is the size of the largest set of points that can be \"shattered\" by these formulas. A set is shattered if for every one of its subsets, there exists a formula that classifies the points in that subset as true and all other points in the set as false.\n\nThe schema $S$ contains four unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. The logical fragment is restricted to using only existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n\n**Analysis of the Definable Concepts**\n\nA careful look at the structure of formulas in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ reveals that any formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ is equivalent to a simpler form. Because the predicates are unary, any existentially quantified variable is independent of the free variable $x$. This means that any formula $\\phi(x)$ simplifies to a conjunction of atomic predicates on $x$ (e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$), possibly gated by a sentence (a formula with no free variables). For any given structure, this sentence is either true or false.\n\nConsequently, for any structure, a formula $\\phi(x)$ defines either the empty set (if the gating sentence is false) or a set defined by a pure conjunction of the base predicates. These correspond to intersections of the sets defined by the individual predicates. For the four predicates $P_1, \\dots, P_4$, the definable sets are therefore intersections of the form $P_{i_1} \\cap P_{i_2} \\cap \\dots \\cap P_{i_k}$, where $\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThis forms a concept class consisting of all possible intersections of the four base sets. Including the case of an empty intersection (which corresponds to the entire universe, defined by $\\top$), there are $2^4 = 16$ such intersectional concepts.\n\n**Proving the VC Dimension**\n\nTo establish the VC dimension, we must show two things:\n1.  There exists a set of size 4 that can be shattered.\n2.  No set of size 5 can be shattered.\n\n**Lower Bound (VC-dim ≥ 4):**\nIt is possible to construct a scenario where a set of four points, let's call them $\\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$, is shattered. We can define the interpretation of the predicates $P_i$ specifically for this purpose. Let the universe be these four points, and define the extension of each predicate $P_i$ to be the set of all points except $a_i$. For example, the set for $P_1$ is $\\{a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$.\n\nWith this setup, for any desired subset of the four points, a corresponding intersection of the predicate sets can be found to isolate it. For example, to isolate the subset $\\{a_1, a_4\\}$, we would use the formula $P_2(x) \\land P_3(x)$. An element $a_j$ satisfies this formula if and only if it is in the set for $P_2$ and the set for $P_3$, which means $j \\neq 2$ and $j \\neq 3$. This leaves exactly $\\{a_1, a_4\\}$. This construction can be generalized for any of the $2^4=16$ subsets, proving that a set of size 4 can be shattered.\n\n**Upper Bound (VC-dim ≤ 4):**\nTo shatter a set of 5 points, one would need to be able to form all $2^5 = 32$ of its subsets. However, as established, the logic can only define at most 16 distinct concepts for any given structure (the intersections of the four predicate sets). Since 16 is less than 32, it's impossible to generate all the necessary subsets to shatter 5 points. Therefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered.\n\nSince a set of size 4 can be shattered, but no set of size 5 can, the VC dimension is exactly 4. This result is a specific instance of a more general theorem stating that the VC dimension of a concept class formed by the intersections of $k$ base sets is $k$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
