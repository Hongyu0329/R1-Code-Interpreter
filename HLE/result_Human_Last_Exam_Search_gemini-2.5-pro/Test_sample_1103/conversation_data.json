    "There are 206 negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48. This result is a part of the complete classification of imaginary quadratic fields with class numbers up to 100, a significant achievement in number theory stemming from the Gauss class number problem.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in its essence, seeks to list all imaginary quadratic fields for any given class number *n*. While the problem was posed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1801, it remained a major open question for centuries. Significant progress was made over the years, with the problem being solved for small class numbers. For instance, the case for class number 1 was famously settled by Heegner, Baker, and Stark.\n\nThe complete classification for class numbers up to 100 was accomplished by Mark Watkins in his 2004 paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\". This work provides a table of the number of negative fundamental discriminants for each class number from 1 to 100. According to this comprehensive work, the number of such discriminants for class number 48 is 206.\n\n<<<206>>>"
