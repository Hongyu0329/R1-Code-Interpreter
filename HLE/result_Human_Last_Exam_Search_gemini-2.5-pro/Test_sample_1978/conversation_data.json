    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, we follow a systematic approach by first clarifying the problem's components and then applying the appropriate mathematical definition.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Problem Statement\n\nThe boundary-value problem is defined by a system of differential equations and a set of boundary conditions.\n\n*   **Differential Equation:**\n    The system is given by `x'(t) = Ax(t) + I(t)`.\n    There is a dimensional mismatch in the problem description:\n    *   The state vector `x(t)` is explicitly defined as `(x_1(t), x_2(t), ..., x_2024(t))`, which implies the system has a dimension of **n = 2024**.\n    *   The matrix `A` and the vector `I(t)` are described with dimensions of 202000.\n    For the matrix-vector multiplication `Ax(t)` to be mathematically valid, the dimensions must be consistent. The most reasonable interpretation is that the dimension of the system is `n = 2024`, as specified by the vector `x(t)` and reinforced by the boundary condition on the component `x_2024(t)`. The mention of 202000 is likely a typographical error.\n\n*   **Boundary Conditions:**\n    The given boundary conditions are:\n    1.  `x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0`\n    2.  `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`\n    3.  `5x_2(T) - 5x_2(0) = 0`\n    4.  `100x_2(T) - 100x_2(0) = 0`\n    5.  `1000x_2(0) - 1000x_2(T) = 0`\n    6.  `100x_2024(T) - 100x_2024(0) = 0`\n\n### 2. Determining the Number of Linearly Independent Boundary Conditions\n\nWe must identify how many of these conditions are unique and not redundant.\n*   Condition (1) is independent.\n*   Condition (2) is `x_2(T) = x_2(0)`.\n*   Condition (3) is `5(x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0`, which is a scalar multiple of condition (2) and thus linearly dependent.\n*   Condition (4) is `100(x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0`, also a scalar multiple of condition (2).\n*   Condition (5) is `-1000(x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0`, another scalar multiple of condition (2).\n*   Condition (6) is `100(x_2024(T) - x_2024(0)) = 0`, which is equivalent to `x_2024(T) - x_2024(0) = 0`. This condition is independent of the others as it involves a different component of `x(t)`.\n\nBy analyzing the set of equations, we find there are only three linearly independent boundary conditions. Let's denote the number of independent boundary conditions as **m = 3**.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Index of the Problem\n\nFor a linear boundary-value problem described by a system of `n` first-order ordinary differential equations with `m` linearly independent boundary conditions, the problem can be analyzed using Fredholm theory. The operator associated with such a problem is a Fredholm operator, and its index is defined as the difference between the dimension of the system and the number of independent boundary conditions.\n\nThe formula for the index is:\n`Index = n - m`\n\nSubstituting the values we determined:\n*   `n = 2024` (the dimension of the system of differential equations)\n*   `m = 3` (the number of linearly independent boundary conditions)\n\n`Index = 2024 - 3 = 2021`\n\n<<<2021>>>"
