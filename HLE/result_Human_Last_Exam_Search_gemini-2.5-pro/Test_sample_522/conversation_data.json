    "The puzzle can be solved by understanding the transformation rules applied to the grid of numbers. Let's analyze the provided examples to deduce these rules.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rules\n\nWe can represent the input and output strings as grids of numbers. The transformation from input to output appears to follow a set of rules based on the values in the cells, particularly the digit '2'. Let's think of '2' as a \"ball\", '0' as \"empty space\", and '1' as a \"wall\".\n\n1.  **Rule Identification from Input_A:**\n    *   **Input:**\n        ```\n        0 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 2 1 1 1 1\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   **Output:**\n        ```\n        2 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   The '2' at position (row 1, col 1) is blocked by a '1' below it. It disappears (becomes '0') and a new '2' appears at (row 0, col 0), which was originally a '0'. This suggests a \"bounce\" effect. The bounce direction is diagonally up and to the left.\n\n2.  **Rule Identification from Input_B:**\n    *   **Input:**\n        ```\n        ... 0 0 ...\n        ... 0 0 ...  (row 2)\n        ... 0 2 1 ...  (row 3)\n        ... 1 1 1 ...  (row 4)\n        ```\n    *   **Output:**\n        ```\n        ... 0 0 ...\n        ... 0 2 1 ...  (row 2)\n        ... 0 0 1 ...  (row 3)\n        ... 1 1 1 ...  (row 4)\n        ```\n    *   The '2' at (row 3, col 6) is also blocked by a '1' below it. It disappears (becomes '0') and a new '2' appears at (row 2, col 7). This is a bounce diagonally up and to the right.\n\n### The \"Bouncing Ball\" Logic\n\nFrom these examples, we can establish a consistent rule for what happens when a '2' is blocked:\n\n*   A '2' at position `(r, c)` is considered \"blocked\" if the cell below it at `(r+1, c)` contains a '1' (a wall).\n*   When a '2' is blocked, it is removed (the cell at `(r, c)` becomes '0').\n*   A new '2' is created by \"bouncing\" to a new empty cell ('0'). The bounce location is determined by a prioritized search:\n    1.  First, check the diagonally up-right position `(r-1, c+1)`. If that cell is a '0' in the input grid, the new '2' appears there.\n    2.  If the up-right position is not available (i.e., not a '0'), check the diagonally up-left position `(r-1, c-1)`. If that cell is a '0', the new '2' appears there.\n\nLet's verify this logic:\n*   In **Example A**, the '2' is at `(1, 1)`. The up-right position `(0, 2)` is a '1'. The up-left position `(0, 0)` is a '0', so the ball bounces there. This matches the output.\n*   In **Example B**, the '2' is at `(3, 6)`. The up-right position `(2, 7)` is a '0'. The rule gives this top priority, so the ball bounces there. This also matches the output.\n\n### Solving for Input_C\n\nNow we apply this logic to `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n*   **Grid representation:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0  (row 0)\n    0 1 1 1 2 0  (row 1)\n    1 1 1 1 1 1  (row 2)\n    ```\n1.  Identify the '2'. It is at position `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n2.  Check the cell below it, `(2, 4)`. It contains a '1', so the '2' is blocked.\n3.  The '2' at `(1, 4)` will be removed and become '0'.\n4.  Determine the bounce location:\n    *   Check the up-right position: `(r-1, c+1)` = `(0, 5)`.\n    *   The cell at `(0, 5)` in the input grid is '0'.\n    *   Since the first priority location is available, the new '2' will be placed at `(0, 5)`.\n\n### Constructing the Output\n\nBased on these changes:\n*   The original grid is `000000,011120,111111`.\n*   The '2' at row 1, index 4, becomes a '0'. Row 1 changes from `011120` to `011100`.\n*   The '0' at row 0, index 5, becomes a '2'. Row 0 changes from `000000` to `000002`.\n*   Row 2 remains unchanged: `111111`.\n\nCombining the new rows gives the final output string.\n\n**MISSING** = `000002,011100,111111`\n\n<<<'000002,011100,111111'>>>"
