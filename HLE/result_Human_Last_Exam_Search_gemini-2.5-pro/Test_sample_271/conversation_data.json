    "Let $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. The first step is to find the Galois group of this polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe polynomial $p(x)$ can be factored as:\n$p(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\n\nLet $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The splitting field $K$ of $p(x)$ is the composite of the splitting fields of $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$.\n\n1.  **Analysis of $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$**:\n    The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n2.  **Analysis of $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$**:\n    *   **Irreducibility**: Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$, we see that 3 divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient (1), and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3. Thus, $f_2(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Galois Group**: Since $f_2(x)$ is an irreducible quintic polynomial, its Galois group $G_2 = \\text{Gal}(f_2/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of $S_5$. The order of $G_2$ is divisible by 5, so it contains a 5-cycle.\n    *   To determine the number of real roots, we examine the derivative: $f_2'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are at $x = \\pm\\sqrt{9/5}$.\n        *   $f_2(-\\sqrt{9/5}) = 3 + \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt{9/5} > 0$ (a local maximum).\n        *   $f_2(\\sqrt{9/5}) = 3 - \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt{9/5} < 0$ (a local minimum).\n    Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $f_2(x)$ has exactly three real roots and therefore two complex conjugate roots. The complex conjugation acts as a transposition on the roots. A subgroup of $S_5$ that contains a 5-cycle and a transposition must be the entire group $S_5$. Thus, $G_2 \\cong S_5$. The splitting field of $f_2(x)$ is $K_2$.\n\n3.  **The Galois Group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$**:\n    The splitting field of $p(x)$ is $K = K_1 K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) K_2$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$ if $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field. The only quadratic subfield of $K_2$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $f_2(x)$.\n    $D = 4^4(-9)^5 + 5^5(3)^4 = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -14863419$.\n    Since $D < 0$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is an imaginary quadratic field. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, which implies $K_1 \\not\\subset K_2$. As $[K_1:\\mathbb{Q}]=2$, we must have $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Thus, $G \\cong G_1 \\times G_2 \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$. The order of $G$ is $2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n4.  **Normal Subfields and their Degrees**:\n    According to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G=C_2 \\times S_5$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G:H|$, where $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is the corresponding normal subgroup.\n\n    The normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$ are:\n    *   The trivial subgroup $\\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$. This corresponds to $L=K$.\n    *   The whole group $C_2 \\times S_5$. This corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_1|=2$. The index is $[G:H_1] = 240/2 = 120$. This corresponds to the field $K_2$, which is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 120.\n    *   $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$. Since $A_5$ is normal in $S_5$, this is a normal subgroup. $|H_2|=60$. The index is $[G:H_2] = 240/60 = 4$. This corresponds to the field $K_1(\\sqrt{D}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-14863419})$, a normal extension of degree 4.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$. $|H_3|=120$. The index is $[G:H_3] = 240/120 = 2$. This corresponds to the field $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, a normal extension of degree 2.\n    *   $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$. $|H_4|=120$. The index is $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$. This corresponds to the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, a normal extension of degree 2.\n    *   $H_5 = \\{(e, \\sigma) \\mid \\sigma \\in A_5\\} \\cup \\{(c, \\tau) \\mid \\tau \\in S_5 \\setminus A_5\\}$, where $c$ is the non-trivial element of $C_2$. This \"skew\" subgroup is also normal. $|H_5|=60+60=120$. The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$. This corresponds to a third quadratic subfield, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2D'})$ where $D'$ is the square-free part of $D$. This is a normal extension of degree 2.\n\nThe possible degrees for proper normal subfields are the indices of these subgroups, which are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nThe possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
