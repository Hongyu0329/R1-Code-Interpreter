    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptztz) reacts with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), or `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, a substitution reaction occurs. The two chloride ligands are replaced by the single, bidentate dptztz ligand.\n\nThe resulting product is the octahedral complex `[Ru(bpy)2(dptztz)]^2+`. This is a tris-chelate complex, meaning the central ruthenium ion is coordinated to three bidentate ligands (two bpy ligands and one dptztz ligand).\n\nFor an octahedral complex with a general formula of `[M(AA)2(BB)]n+`, where AA and BB are two different symmetrical bidentate ligands, there is only one possible geometric isomer. However, this structure is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This gives rise to optical isomerism.\n\nThese non-superimposable mirror images are a pair of enantiomers. In coordination chemistry, these are often designated by the stereochemical descriptors Δ (delta) for the right-handed propeller-like twist of the ligands and Λ (lambda) for the left-handed twist. The synthesis of similar ruthenium complexes typically results in a racemic mixture containing both the Δ and Λ enantiomers.\n\nTherefore, the reaction forms two isomers, which are a pair of enantiomers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
