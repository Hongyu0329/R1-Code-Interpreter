    "In disordered electronic systems, the field theory used to describe their low-energy properties is a non-linear sigma model. The specific characteristics of this model depend on the fundamental symmetries of the system, which are categorized into ten classes by the Altland-Zirnbauer classification.\n\nFor systems in symmetry class D, which are characterized by broken time-reversal and spin-rotational symmetries, the target space of the bosonic non-linear sigma model in the replica formalism (with *n* replicas) is the symmetric space O(2*n*)/O(*n*) x O(*n*). The number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables needed for parametrization corresponds to the dimension of this manifold.\n\nThe dimension of a symmetric space G/H is calculated as the difference between the dimension of the group G and the dimension of its subgroup H. The dimension of an orthogonal group O(k) is given by the formula k(k-1)/2.\n\nFor the case of two replicas (*n*=2), the relevant manifold is O(4)/(O(2) x O(2)). The dimensions are calculated as follows:\n*   **Dimension of O(4):** 4 * (4-1) / 2 = 6\n*   **Dimension of O(2):** 2 * (2-1) / 2 = 1\n*   **Dimension of the subgroup O(2) x O(2):** dim(O(2)) + dim(O(2)) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nTherefore, the number of variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector is:\ndim(O(4)) - dim(O(2) x O(2)) = 6 - 2 = 4.\n\nThe user's query mentions a \"supersymmetric sigma-model,\" and it is worth noting that the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma model for class D corresponds to the same symmetric space as in the replica formalism.\n\n<<<4>>>"
