    "The island town that sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera sharing the town's name, and is more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island, is **Raoul Island**.\n\nRaoul Island is the largest of the Kermadec Islands, located approximately 1,100 kilometers northeast of New Zealand and over 900 kilometers from 'Ata Island in Tonga, making it exceptionally remote. The island is volcanic and features two calderas.\n\nThe western caldera is named the Denham Caldera and forms a large bay known as Denham Bay. This bay was the site of past settlement attempts. While there is no permanent town today, only a Department of Conservation field station located elsewhere on the island, the historical settlement in Denham Bay makes it the only location that closely matches all the specific criteria of the question.\n\n<<<Raoul Island>>>"
