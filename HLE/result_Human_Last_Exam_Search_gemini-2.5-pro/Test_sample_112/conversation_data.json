    "Sir Launfal is preserved in the British Library manuscript MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, which is considered a \"household book\" from the late medieval period. This manuscript contains a collection of texts intended to instruct on proper conduct and social mores.\n\nWhile there isn't a single \"book of manners\" with a formal title, the manuscript as a whole, and particularly a collection of short \"courtesy\" poems by John Lydgate, served this purpose. A doctoral dissertation on the manuscript is even titled \"'Nurtur and good maners make√æ man': The Burgeis in Late-Medieval Household Miscellany BL MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, part 1,\" which translates to \"'Nurture and good manners make a man'\". This indicates that the entire collection of works, including *Sir Launfal*, was compiled to impart lessons on social, courtly, and chivalric obedience and behavior. Therefore, *Sir Launfal* was preserved alongside a collection of poems and romances that collectively functioned as a guide to manners and proper conduct.\n\n<<<The book of manners that Sir Launfal was preserved alongside is not a single, formally titled volume, but rather the entire manuscript collection of British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, which functioned as a \"household book\" of courtesy and instruction on proper conduct, including short poems on manners by John Lydgate.>>>"
