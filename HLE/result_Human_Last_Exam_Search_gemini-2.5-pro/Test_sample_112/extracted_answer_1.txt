The book of manners that Sir Launfal was preserved alongside is not a single, formally titled volume, but rather the entire manuscript collection of British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, which functioned as a "household book" of courtesy and instruction on proper conduct, including short poems on manners by John Lydgate.
