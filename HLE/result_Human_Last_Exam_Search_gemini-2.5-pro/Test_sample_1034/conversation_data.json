    "To determine the number of integer values for side length AC for which there are two possible values for side length AB, we must analyze the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines.\n\nIn triangle ABC, we are given:\n*   `BC = S`. The term `SNYWR` is often used in math competitions to denote the \"Sum of the New Year We Remain,\" which corresponds to the current year. Therefore, `S = 2025`.\n*   `m∠B = 30°`\n*   Let `AC = b` and `BC = a`.\n\nFor there to be two possible triangles, and thus two possible lengths for side AB, the given side opposite the angle (`AC`) must be longer than the altitude from vertex C to side AB, but shorter than the other given side (`BC`).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the length of the altitude `h` from vertex C to the line containing side AB.\n`h = BC * sin(B)`\n`h = 2025 * sin(30°)`\n`h = 2025 * (1/2)`\n`h = 1012.5`\n\nThe condition for the existence of two possible triangles is `h < AC < BC`.\n\nSubstituting the known values into this inequality, we get:\n`1012.5 < AC < 2025`\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer* values of AC that satisfy this condition. The possible integer values for AC are 1013, 1014, 1015, ..., 2024.\n\nTo find the number of integers in this range, we can use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of integer values = `2024 - 1013 + 1`\nNumber of integer values = `1011 + 1`\nNumber of integer values = `1012`\n\nThus, there are 1012 integer values for the length of AC for which two possible triangles can be formed.\n\n<<<1012>>>"
