    "Following the rules of the cellular automaton Rule 110, starting from a single cell in state 1 and applying the rule 20 times results in the following binary pattern:\n\nRule 110 dictates the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the state of its two immediate neighbors. The rule can be summarized by the following transitions, where the triplet represents the left neighbor, the cell itself, and the right neighbor, and the result is the cell's next state.\n\n*   111 → 0\n*   110 → 1\n*   101 → 1\n*   100 → 0\n*   011 → 1\n*   010 → 1\n*   001 → 1\n*   000 → 0\n\nApplying this rule for 20 successive generations starting with a single '1' cell (surrounded by '0's) produces a complex pattern. The evolution of this pattern is neither completely random nor perfectly repetitive, a characteristic of what is known as Class 4 behavior in cellular automata.\n\nThe simulation of these 20 steps yields the final binary pattern.\n\n<<<11111010111>>>"
