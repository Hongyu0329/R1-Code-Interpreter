    "Given the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge and a world restricted to the epistemic states of only Knowledge and Belief, two significant problems arise, distinct from Gettier-style cases.\n\nThe two problems are:\n\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The \"Justified\" component of the JTB definition posits that for a belief to be knowledge, it must be supported by good reasons. However, these reasons, to be considered valid, must themselves be justified beliefs or knowledge. This creates a logical puzzle: each justification requires a further justification, leading to an infinite backward chain. For instance, if you claim to know P because of Q, you must also be justified in believing Q. That justification, R, must also be justified, and so on. In a system limited to only \"Belief\" and \"Knowledge,\" where knowledge requires a complete justification, this infinite regress means that no belief can ever be fully justified. If a final, foundational justification cannot be reached, then according to the JTB definition, the state of \"Knowledge\" is unattainable. Every belief would be perpetually in the state of \"Belief,\" awaiting a justification that can never logically conclude.\n\n2.  **The Inaccessibility of Truth:** The \"True\" component of the JTB definition requires that a belief must correspond to objective reality to qualify as knowledge. The problem is that as subjective observers, we lack a direct, independent way to verify this correspondence. We perceive the world through our senses and intellect, which are inherently fallible and can be deceived. I may have a belief that is, in fact, true, but I can never step outside of my own perspective to confirm with absolute certainty that it is true, as opposed to merely appearing to be true. Because we cannot definitively confirm the \"Truth\" condition from our own epistemic position, we can never be certain that we have met all the criteria for knowledge. In an epistemic framework strictly divided between \"Belief\" and \"Knowledge,\" this limitation means that we can never confidently transition from \"Belief\" to \"Knowledge.\" The requirement for truth becomes an insurmountable barrier, making knowledge, by this definition, an aspiration rather than an attainable state.\n\n<<<The two problems are the Infinite Regress of Justification and the Inaccessibility of Truth.>>>"
