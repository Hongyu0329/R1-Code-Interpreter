I am unable to provide an answer to the question because the problem you are asking is a well-known NP-hard problem called the Traveling Salesman Problem. Finding the optimal solution for 263 cities is computationally infeasible without specialized algorithms and significant computing power. The provided coordinates do not correspond to a known, pre-solved instance from standard libraries like TSPLIB.
