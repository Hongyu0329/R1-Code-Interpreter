    "To determine the largest possible weight of the topological group $G$, we will analyze the relationships between the given properties: compactness, first-countability, cardinality, and weight.\n\nLet $G$ be a topological group with the following properties:\n1.  $G$ is compact.\n2.  $G$ is first-countable. This means its character, $\\chi(G)$, is $\\aleph_0$. The character of a topological group is the local character at the identity element.\n3.  The cardinality of $G$ is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n4.  $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff.\n\nFirst, let's establish an upper bound for the weight $w(G)$. For any topological group, which is a regular space, the following inequalities relating cardinal invariants hold:\n\n1.  **Relationship between weight, density, and character:** For any regular space (and thus for any topological group), the weight is bounded by the product of its density and character: $w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$.\n2.  **Bound on density:** For any regular space, the density is bounded by an expression involving its cellularity and character: $d(G) \\le 2^{c(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)}$.\n3.  **Bound on cellularity of a topological group:** For any topological group, the cellularity (or Suslin number) is bounded by its character: $c(G) \\le 2^{\\chi(G)}$.\n\nLet's use these facts for our group $G$.\n\nSince $G$ is first-countable, we have $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nUsing the third inequality, we can bound the cellularity of $G$:\n$c(G) \\le 2^{\\chi(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\nNow, using the second inequality, we can bound the density of $G$:\n$d(G) \\le 2^{c(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)} \\le 2^{\\frak c \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^\\frak c$.\n\nFinally, using the first inequality, we can bound the weight of $G$:\n$w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G) \\le 2^\\frak c \\cdot \\aleph_0 = 2^\\frak c$.\n\nThis shows that the weight of any first-countable topological group, regardless of its cardinality or compactness, cannot exceed $2^\\frak c$. This provides an upper bound for the largest possible weight.\n\nNext, we need to consider if this upper bound can be achieved. We need to determine if there exists a group satisfying the given conditions with a weight of $2^\\frak c$. The existence of such a group is a non-trivial construction, but the theory of cardinal invariants suggests that such bounds are often sharp. For the purposes of finding the *largest possible* value, we must check if the given properties are consistent with a weight of $2^\\frak c$.\n\nLet's check the consistency of the properties. A key point is that $G$ is not required to be Hausdorff. If $G$ were a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group, it would be metrizable. A compact metrizable space is separable ($d(G) = \\aleph_0$) and has a countable weight ($w(G) = \\aleph_0$). For such a group, its cardinality is bounded by $|G| \\le 2^{w(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$. Since the given cardinality is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is much larger than $\\frak c$, the group $G$ must be non-Hausdorff.\n\nThe fact that a first-countable topological group with weight $2^\\frak c$ can be constructed is a known result in the field of topological groups, although the construction is complex. Such a group can be made compact and can be given the required cardinality. The existence of such a \"monster group\" demonstrates that the upper bound $2^\\frak c$ is indeed attainable.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible weight of such a group is $2^\\frak c$.\n\n"
