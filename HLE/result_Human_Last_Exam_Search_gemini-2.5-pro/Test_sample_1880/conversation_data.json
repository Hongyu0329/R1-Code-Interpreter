    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nThe polynomial is checked for irreducibility over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, we see that 2 divides all coefficients (0, 0, 8, 14) except for the leading coefficient (1), and $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14. Thus, the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible orders of the group are 24 ($S_4$), 12 ($A_4$), 8 ($D_4$), or 4 ($C_4$ or $V_4$).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ for a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$. For this polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. Since $\\sqrt{591872} \\approx 769.33$, the discriminant is not a perfect square. Therefore, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4) as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$, or the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a depressed quartic $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by $y^3 - 4ry + q^2 = 0$.\nSubstituting $q=8$ and $r=14$, we get:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y + 8^2 = 0$\n$y^3 - 56y + 64 = 0$\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$ if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (i.e., has a rational root). By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Testing these divisors, we find:\n$(-8)^3 - 56(-8) + 64 = -512 + 448 + 64 = 0$\nSince $y=-8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible. This means the Galois group is not $S_4$. The possibilities are now narrowed down to $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we check if the original polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\theta})$, where $\\theta$ is a rational root of the resolvent cubic. In our case, $\\theta = -8$. So we test for reducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-8}) = \\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe polynomial is reducible over this field if and only if a related cubic equation, derived from the factorization attempt, has a solution that is the square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt{2})$. This related cubic is $Y^3 - 56Y - 64 = 0$. This cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ as it has no rational roots.\n\nA detailed analysis shows that for a root of this cubic to be a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt{2})$, the degree of the field extension generated by the root would have to be divisible by the degree of $\\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt{2})$, which is 2. However, the roots of this irreducible cubic generate extensions of degree 3. Since 2 does not divide 3, this is impossible. Therefore, $x^4+8x+14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-8})$.\n\nSince the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-8})$, the Galois group is the dihedral group $D_4$. The order of $D_4$ is 8. A table of known Galois groups also lists the group for $x^4 + 8x + 14$ as a transitive group of order 8 (denoted 4T1), which corresponds to $D_4$.\n\n<<<8>>>"
