    "Based on the theory of conceptual metaphor developed by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, the phrase \"my love for humanity\" is an example of a structural metaphor, as it frames an abstract concept in terms of a more concrete one.\n\nAccording to Lakoff and Johnson's work, primarily in their book *Metaphors We Live By*, there are three main types of conceptual metaphors: orientational, ontological, and structural.\n\n1.  **Orientational Metaphors** organize concepts spatially, such as up-down or in-out (e.g., \"I'm feeling up today\" for happiness).\n2.  **Ontological Metaphors** involve viewing abstract things like events, emotions, and ideas as concrete entities or substances. Treating \"love\" as a \"thing\" that can be possessed (\"*my* love\") is a classic example of an ontological metaphor.\n3.  **Structural Metaphors** are those in which one concept is metaphorically structured in terms of another. For instance, the metaphor TIME IS MONEY structures our understanding of time as a limited resource that can be spent, saved, or wasted.\n\nWhile the phrase \"my love for humanity\" most precisely fits the definition of an ontological metaphor by treating love as a substance, this is not one of the answer choices provided. However, ontological and structural metaphors are related. An ontological metaphor can be seen as a prerequisite for, or a basic type of, a structural metaphor; giving an abstract concept the property of being an object is a way of imposing a structure upon it.\n\nBy framing love as a possessable object directed at a recipient, the phrase imposes a [POSSESSOR]-[OBJECT]-[RECIPIENT] structure onto the abstract emotion. Therefore, among the given choices, it best fits the definition of a structural metaphor, where an abstract concept (love) is presented in terms of a more concrete or structured concept (a possessable object).\n\n<<<D>>>"
