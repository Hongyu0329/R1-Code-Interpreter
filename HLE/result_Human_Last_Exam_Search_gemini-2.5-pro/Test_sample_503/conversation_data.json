    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, corresponds to a Galois connection between finite total orders. Let the two objects in $\\Delta$ be $[m]$ and $[n]$, which are the posets $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$ and $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ with their usual orderings.\n\nAn adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint), satisfying the condition:\n$L(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le R(y)$ for all $x \\in [m]$ and $y \\in [n]$.\n\nThis is equivalent to two other conditions:\n1.  For all $x \\in [m]$, $x \\le R(L(x))$.\n2.  For all $y \\in [n]$, $L(R(y)) \\le y$.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint $L$ or the right adjoint $R$. A key theorem in order theory states that a monotone map between posets is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins), and a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\n\nThe posets $[m]$ and $[n]$ are finite lattices, where the supremum of a subset is its maximum and the infimum is its minimum. For an order-preserving map $f$, preservation of suprema/infima of non-empty subsets is automatic. The crucial part comes from preserving the supremum/infimum of the empty set.\n*   The supremum of the empty set is the bottom element, 0. A left adjoint $L: [m] \\to [n]$ must preserve it, meaning $L(0) = 0$.\n*   The infimum of the empty set is the top element. A right adjoint $R: [n] \\to [m]$ must preserve it, meaning $R(n) = m$.\n\nIf $L(0) = 0$ and $L$ is order-preserving, a right adjoint $R$ can be constructed. Similarly, if $R(n) = m$ and $R$ is order-preserving, a left adjoint $L$ can be constructed. Therefore, counting the number of adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\n\nLet's count the number of such maps from $[m] =$ to $[n] =$.\nAn order-preserving map $L: \\to$ is a sequence of integers $(L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23))$ such that $L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$, where each $L(i) \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first element. So we need to count sequences $0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$ where $L(i) \\in \\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic stars and bars problem. Let $y_i = L(i)$ for $i=1, \\dots, 23$. We are looking for the number of sequences $0 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le \\dots \\le y_{23} \\le 37$.\nLet $x_i$ be the difference between consecutive elements in a new sequence derived from $y_i$:\n$x_1 = y_1$\n$x_2 = y_2 - y_1$\n...\n$x_{23} = y_{23} - y_{22}$\n$x_{24} = 37 - y_{23}$\n\nEach $x_i \\ge 0$, and their sum is:\n$x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_{23} + x_{24} = y_1 + (y_2 - y_1) + \\dots + (y_{23} - y_{22}) + (37 - y_{23}) = 37$.\n\nSo we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x_1 + \\dots + x_{24} = 37$.\nUsing the stars and bars formula, the number of solutions is $\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$, where $n=37$ (stars) and $k=24$ (variables/bins).\nThe number of solutions is:\n$\\binom{37 + 24 - 1}{24 - 1} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$\n$\\binom{60}{23} = 43,391,373,684,374,100$\n\nThus, there are $\\binom{60}{23}$ such maps $L$, and therefore that many internal adjunctions.\n\n<<<43391373684374100>>>"
