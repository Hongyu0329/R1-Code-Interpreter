    "To determine the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`, we analyze the operations performed.\n\nThe algorithm's core is a `while` loop that executes as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):** This step involves a fixed number of basic arithmetic operations (assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). Assuming these operations take constant time, this step's complexity is O(1).\n\n2.  **While Loop (Step 2):** The key to finding the complexity is to determine how many times this loop runs.\n    *   In each iteration, the value of `x` is updated to the previous quotient `q`, and a new quotient is calculated by dividing `x` by the base `c`.\n    *   Essentially, the value of `n` is effectively divided by `c` in each iteration.\n    *   The loop continues until the quotient `q` (which is `⌊n / c^k⌋` after `k` iterations) becomes 0.\n    *   This will happen when `c^k > n`. Taking the logarithm to the base `c` of both sides gives `k > log_c(n)`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n3.  **Operations inside the loop:** Each iteration of the loop consists of a constant number of basic operations (increment, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). Under the common assumption that these arithmetic operations on integers of a size that fits within a machine's word take constant time (O(1)), the work done inside the loop is constant.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe total time complexity is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the complexity of the work done in each iteration.\n\nTotal Complexity = (Number of iterations) × (Complexity per iteration)\nTotal Complexity = O(log<sub>c</sub>n) × O(1)\nTotal Complexity = O(log<sub>c</sub>n)\n\nAccording to the change of base rule for logarithms, `log_c(n)` is proportional to `log(n)` for any other base, so the complexity can be expressed as O(log n). This analysis is supported by multiple sources which state the complexity for this method of base conversion is O(log<sub>base</sub>n).\n\nIt is important to note that if `n` were an arbitrarily large number requiring a number of bits that exceeds the processor's word size, the cost of the arithmetic operations themselves would not be O(1) and would depend on the number of bits in `n`. However, for standard integer sizes, the O(log n) complexity is the conventional and correct answer.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
