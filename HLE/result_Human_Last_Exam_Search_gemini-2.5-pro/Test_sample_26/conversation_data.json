    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$, of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we first analyze the topological properties of $X$.\n\n1.  **Topological Nature of X**: A hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex surface, which corresponds to a real 4-dimensional manifold. All smooth hypersurfaces of the same degree in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ are diffeomorphic, meaning they have the same topological structure.\n\n2.  **Connectivity and Betti Numbers**: According to the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the inclusion map from $X$ into $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < 2$. Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is trivial, $\\pi_1(X)$ is also trivial, meaning $X$ is simply connected. The Betti numbers, which are the ranks of the homology groups, are as follows: $b_0(X) = 1$, $b_1(X) = 0$, $b_3(X) = 0$, and $b_4(X) = 1$.\n\n3.  **Euler Characteristic and the Second Betti Number**: The Euler characteristic, $\\chi(X)$, for a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is given by the formula $\\chi(X) = d^3 - 4d^2 + 6d$. For a quintic hypersurface, $d=5$, so:\n    $\\chi(X) = 5^3 - 4(5^2) + 6(5) = 125 - 100 + 30 = 55$.\n\n    The Euler characteristic is also the alternating sum of the Betti numbers: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$. Plugging in the known values:\n    $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    This gives $b_2(X) = 53$. Therefore, the second homology group $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is a free abelian group of rank 53, i.e., $\\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n\n4.  **Hurewicz and Whitehead Theorems**: Since $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X) = 0$), the Hurewicz theorem states that the second homotopy group $\\pi_2(X)$ is isomorphic to the second homology group $H_2(X)$. Thus, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n\n    For a simply connected space like $X$, the third homotopy group can be related to the second homotopy group by a result of J. H. C. Whitehead. The theorem states that for a simply connected CW complex, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X)) \\oplus H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. Here, $\\Gamma$ is Whitehead's universal quadratic functor.\n\n5.  **Rank Calculation**: We know $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ has rank $b_3 = 0$, so it is the trivial group. This simplifies the relation to $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))$. Since $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$, we need to compute the rank of $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$. For a free abelian group of rank $n$, $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^n)$ is also a free abelian group, and its rank is given by the formula:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^n)) = n + \\binom{n}{2} = n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n\n    Substituting $n=53$:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 53 + \\frac{53(53-1)}{2} = 53 + \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 53 + (53 \\times 26) = 53 + 1378 = 1431$.\n\nThe rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is a free abelian group of rank 1431.\n\n<<<1431>>>"
