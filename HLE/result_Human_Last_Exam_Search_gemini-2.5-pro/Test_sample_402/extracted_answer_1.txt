A filtering strategy based on log fold base 2 change to eliminate contaminating cancer genes in the CAR T samples not expressing IL15 can be implemented by first creating a "contamination signature" which is a list of genes highly expressed in the cancer cell line but not in T cells. This can be achieved by analyzing a public RNA-seq dataset of the cancer cell line or by sequencing a pure cancer cell line sample. Once the list of contaminating genes is generated and saved, for instance, as `cancer_contamination_signature.txt`, you can use the command line to filter your differential expression results. For example, using the `grep` command with the `-v` (invert match) and `-f` (file) options, you can remove the contaminating genes from your results file: `grep -v -w -f cancer_contamination_signature.txt CAR_vs_CAR-IL15_diff_expr.csv > filtered_diff_expr_results.csv`. The output file `filtered_diff_expr_results.csv` will then contain the differential expression results without the contaminating cancer genes, allowing for a more accurate comparison between the CAR T cells and the CAR T cells co-expressing IL15. This filtered file can then be used for downstream analyses such as pathway analysis or generating heatmaps. This approach provides an unbiased way to clean up the data and enhance the confidence in the final results of the experiment.
