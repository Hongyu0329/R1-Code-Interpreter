    "The Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gieti, meaning \"'(s)he's giving a sign',\" develops into the following forms in Proto-Germanic and its daughter languages. The PIE root is *seh₂g-, which means \"to seek out\" or \"to track.\"\n\nHere is the lineage of the word:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sōkijaną. The PIE form *seh₂gieti became the Class 1 weak verb *sōkijaną in Proto-Germanic. The key phonological changes are the PIE *eh₂ becoming a long *ō in Proto-Germanic and the PIE *g becoming *k as part of the sound change known as Grimm's Law.\n\n*   **Old Norse:** *sœkja. In the transition from Proto-Germanic to Proto-Norse and then Old Norse, the long vowel *ō underwent i-umlaut because of the following *j. This process changed the *ō sound to *œ.\n\n*   **Old English:** *sēcan*. The Proto-Germanic *sōkijaną evolved into *sēcan* in Old English. Similar to Old Norse, the *ō* was affected by i-umlaut, changing to *ē*. Additionally, the consonant *k* was palatalized to /tʃ/ (spelled as *ċ*) before the front vowel that caused the umlaut.\n\n*   **Old High German:** *suohhen*. The Proto-Germanic *sōkijaną* became *suohhen* in Old High German. In Old High German, the Proto-Germanic *k* shifted to a fricative /x/ (spelled *hh*) between vowels. Unlike in Old English and Old Norse, the long *ō* did not undergo i-umlaut; instead, it was diphthongized to *uo*. This is because the *j* that would have caused the umlaut was lost before the sound change occurred in this particular class of verbs.\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną\nOld Norse: sœkja\nOld English: sēcan\nOld High German: suohhen>>>"
