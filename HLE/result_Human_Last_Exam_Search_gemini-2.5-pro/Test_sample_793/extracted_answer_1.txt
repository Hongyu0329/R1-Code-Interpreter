The highest concentration of an individual chemical reaching the spring is PFOS at 7.37 x 10⁻⁵ μg/L. The effect of the mixture at this concentration is additive, but with a total Toxic Unit value of approximately 1.53 x 10⁻⁷, the combined effect is negligible and no adverse impact on the protected algal community is expected.
