    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Nationalgalerie, part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, in 1967. The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (The Radio Addict / Petit Bourgeois by the Radio), is a notable work of the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement. It depicts a man, identified as a certain Herr Schreck, who was a paraplegic and lived in the same house as the artist. The work is seen as a commentary on the burgeoning radio culture of the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe painting is listed with the inventory number A IV 134 and is part of the collection of the Neue Nationalgalerie.\n\n<<<Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
