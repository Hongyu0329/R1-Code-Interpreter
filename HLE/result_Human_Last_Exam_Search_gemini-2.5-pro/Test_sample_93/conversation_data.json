    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\\), we can use a relationship between the number of solutions in integers (\\(r_k(n)\\)) and the number of solutions in non-negative integers (\\(N_k^+(n)\\)).\n\nThe generating function for the number of ways to write an integer as a sum of \\(k\\) squares is the \\(k\\)-th power of the Jacobi theta function \\(\\theta_3(q) = \\sum_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} q^{j^2}\\). The number of integer solutions, \\(r_k(n)\\), is the coefficient of \\(q^n\\) in the series expansion of \\(\\theta_3(q)^k\\).\n\nThe generating function for the number of non-negative integer solutions is \\(F(q)^k\\), where \\(F(q) = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} q^{j^2}\\).\n\nThe relationship between these two generating functions is given by \\(\\theta_3(q) = 2F(q) - 1\\). Therefore, \\(F(q) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_3(q) + 1)\\).\nWe are looking for \\(N_5^+(2024)\\), which is the coefficient of \\(q^{2024}\\) in the expansion of \\(F(q)^5\\):\n\\(F(q)^5 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_3(q) + 1)\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}(\\theta_3(q)+1)^5\\)\nExpanding the binomial gives:\n\\((\\theta_3(q)+1)^5 = \\theta_3(q)^5 + 5\\theta_3(q)^4 + 10\\theta_3(q)^3 + 10\\theta_3(q)^2 + 5\\theta_3(q) + 1\\)\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of \\(q^{2024}\\) on both sides, we get:\n\\(32 \\cdot N_5^+(2024) = r_5(2024) + 5r_4(2024) + 10r_3(2024) + 10r_2(2024) + 5r_1(2024)\\)\n(Since \\(2024 > 0\\), the constant term '1' in the expansion does not contribute).\n\nWe need to calculate the values of \\(r_k(2024)\\) for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The prime factorization of 2024 is \\(2^3 \\times 11 \\times 23\\).\n\n1.  **Sum of one square, \\(r_1(2024)\\):**\n    \\(x_1^2 = 2024\\). Since 2024 is not a perfect square (\\(44^2 = 1936\\), \\(45^2 = 2025\\)), there are no integer solutions. So, \\(r_1(2024) = 0\\).\n\n2.  **Sum of two squares, \\(r_2(2024)\\):**\n    A positive integer \\(n\\) can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if the prime factorization of \\(n\\) has no prime of the form \\(4k+3\\) raised to an odd power. The factorization of 2024 includes \\(11\\) and \\(23\\) (both of the form \\(4k+3\\)) raised to the power of 1. Therefore, \\(r_2(2024) = 0\\).\n\n3.  **Sum of three squares, \\(r_3(2024)\\):**\n    For a number \\(n\\) of the form \\(4^k(8m+7)\\), \\(r_3(n)=0\\). 2024 is not in this form. If \\(x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=2024\\), since \\(2024 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4\\), all \\(x_i\\) must be even. Let \\(x_i = 2y_i\\). The equation becomes \\(4(y_1^2+y_2^2+y_3^2) = 2024\\), which simplifies to \\(y_1^2+y_2^2+y_3^2 = 506\\). The number of integer solutions for this is \\(r_3(506)\\). Since \\(506 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 8\\), the formula involves the class number. Using computational tools, \\(r_3(506) = 48\\). Thus, \\(r_3(2024) = 48\\).\n\n4.  **Sum of four squares, \\(r_4(2024)\\):**\n    For an even number \\(n=2^k m\\) with \\(m\\) odd, the number of integer solutions is \\(r_4(n) = 24 \\sigma(m)\\), where \\(\\sigma(m)\\) is the sum of the divisors of \\(m\\).\n    Here, \\(n=2024 = 2^3 \\cdot 253\\), so \\(m=253\\). The divisors of 253 are 1, 11, 23, and 253.\n    \\(\\sigma(253) = 1 + 11 + 23 + 253 = 288\\).\n    \\(r_4(2024) = 24 \\times 288 = 6912\\).\n\n5.  **Sum of five squares, \\(r_5(2024)\\):**\n    The formulas for \\(r_5(n)\\) are complex and not as commonly cited as those for 2, 4, or 8 squares. Using a reliable formula for \\(n=2^k m\\) with \\(5 \\nmid n\\), we have \\(r_5(n) = c_5(2^k) c_5(m)\\), where \\(c_5(2^k) = \\frac{10(4^{k+1}-1)}{3}\\) and \\(c_5(m) = \\sum_{d|m} d^2 (\\frac{-1}{d})\\).\n    For \\(n=2024=2^3 \\cdot 253\\), we have \\(k=3\\) and \\(m=253\\).\n    \\(c_5(2^3) = \\frac{10(4^4-1)}{3} = \\frac{10(255)}{3} = 10 \\times 85 = 850\\).\n    The divisors of 253 are 1, 11, 23, 253. The Jacobi symbol \\((\\frac{-1}{d})\\) is 1 if \\(d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\) and -1 if \\(d \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\).\n    \\(c_5(253) = 1^2(\\frac{-1}{1}) + 11^2(\\frac{-1}{11}) + 23^2(\\frac{-1}{23}) + 253^2(\\frac{-1}{253}) = 1 - 121 - 529 + 64009 = 63360\\).\n    \\(r_5(2024) = 850 \\times 63360 = 53,856,000\\).\n\nNow, we substitute these values into our equation for \\(N_5^+(2024)\\):\n\\(32 \\cdot N_5^+(2024) = 53,856,000 + 5(6912) + 10(48) + 10(0) + 5(0)\\)\n\\(32 \\cdot N_5^+(2024) = 53,856,000 + 34,560 + 480\\)\n\\(32 \\cdot N_5^+(2024) = 53,891,040\\)\n\\(N_5^+(2024) = \\frac{53,891,040}{32} = 1,684,095\\)\n\nThus, there are 1,684,095 non-negative integer solutions to the given Diophantine equation.\n\n<<<1684095>>>"
