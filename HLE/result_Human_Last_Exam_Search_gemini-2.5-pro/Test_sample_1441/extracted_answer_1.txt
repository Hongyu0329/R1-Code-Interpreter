In scalar field theoretical frameworks, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, scales with the spatial dimensionality, d, below the upper critical dimension of four (d < 4) according to the epsilon expansion. To the first order in ε = 4 - d, the relationship is given by:

α ≈ (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) * ε

For a single-component scalar field (n=1), this simplifies to:

α ≈ (3 / 22) * (4 - d)

Thus, α scales linearly with the deviation of the dimensionality from four.
