**Homology groups of X:**
*   $H_{n-1}(X)$ (as it determines the key global obstruction component, since $H_n(\Sigma X) \cong H_{n-1}(X)$)

**Homotopy groups of SO(2k):**
*   $\pi_1(SO(2k))$ (This group classifies the "local" or "pointwise" obstruction.)
*   $\pi_{n+1}(SO(2k))$ (This group, combined with $H_{n-1}(X)$, classifies the primary "global" or "twisting" obstruction.)
