    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue—which is green—and blue itself corresponds to the musical note G.\n\nNewton famously connected the visible spectrum of light to the musical scale. In his color circle, he divided the spectrum into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. He associated these colors with the notes of a musical scale, specifically the Dorian mode starting on the note D.\n\nIn this system, the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue are linked to specific notes. Following the scale, the color produced by mixing yellow and blue, which is green, is assigned a particular note. The color green corresponds to the musical note G, while the subsequent color, blue, is associated with the note A. Therefore, the musical note that represents the range beginning with green and extending towards blue is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
