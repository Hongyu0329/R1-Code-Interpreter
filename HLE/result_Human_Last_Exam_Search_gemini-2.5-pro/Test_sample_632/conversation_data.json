    "Until the early 20th century, a unique architectural feature of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" was the presence of tram tracks, which were part of Rome's public transportation system. While the tram service through the piazza was discontinued earlier, the final removal of the tracks and the subsequent repaving of the square occurred in the post-war period, with significant changes to the piazza's appearance solidifying by the 1950s.\n\nHistorical photographs and records indicate that a tram line passed through the piazza, a feature that would have significantly shaped its character and use. By 1955, images of the square show it as a pedestrian-friendly space, with various shops and cafes, but without the tram infrastructure. The removal of the tram tracks represents a significant architectural change, transforming the piazza from a transit corridor into the open, pedestrian-oriented space it is today, fully centered on the grandeur of the Pantheon.\n\n<<<The tram tracks.>>>"
