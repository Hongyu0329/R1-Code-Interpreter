    "The number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, denoted as a(10), is 44,100.\n\nA self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The Manhattan lattice is another term for the square lattice. The number of these walks for a given number of steps, n, is a well-studied mathematical sequence.\n\nThe sequence for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice begins as follows, with a(0) = 1 (a walk of zero steps is a single point):\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\nThere is no known simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n. The values are typically determined through computational enumeration.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
