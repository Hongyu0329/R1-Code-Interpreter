    "To determine the smallest number N such that any integer greater than or equal to N can be written as a sum of distinct numbers of the form $a_n = 2n^2+3n+1$, we first analyze the properties of this set of numbers.\n\nThe expression can be factored as $a_n = (2n+1)(n+1)$.\nLet's list the first few terms of the sequence for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$:\n*   $a_1 = (2(1)+1)(1+1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6$\n*   $a_2 = (2(2)+1)(2+1) = 5 \\times 3 = 15$\n*   $a_3 = (2(3)+1)(3+1) = 7 \\times 4 = 28$\n*   $a_4 = (2(4)+1)(4+1) = 9 \\times 5 = 45$\n*   $a_5 = (2(5)+1)(5+1) = 11 \\times 6 = 66$\n*   $a_6 = (2(6)+1)(6+1) = 13 \\times 7 = 91$\n*   $a_7 = (2(7)+1)(7+1) = 15 \\times 8 = 120$\n\nThe set of numbers is $A = \\{6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91, 120, \\dots\\}$. We are looking for the largest integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct elements of A. This number is often called the Frobenius number of the set for subset sums, and N will be this number plus one.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of these numbers modulo 3.\n$a_n = 2n^2+3n+1 \\equiv 2n^2+1 \\pmod{3}$.\n*   If $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ (e.g., $n=3, 6, 9, \\dots$), then $n=3k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. $a_{3k} = 2(3k)^2+1 = 18k^2+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. Examples: $a_3=28 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, $a_6=91 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n*   If $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ (e.g., $n=1, 4, 7, \\dots$), then $n=3k+1$ for $k \\ge 0$. $a_{3k+1} = 2(3k+1)^2+1 = 2(9k^2+6k+1)+1 = 18k^2+12k+3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Examples: $a_1=6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, $a_4=45 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n*   If $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ (e.g., $n=2, 5, 8, \\dots$), then $n=3k+2$ for $k \\ge 0$. $a_{3k+2} = 2(3k+2)^2+1 = 2(9k^2+12k+4)+1 = 18k^2+24k+9 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Examples: $a_2=15 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, $a_5=66 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nSo, an element $a_n$ is a multiple of 3 if and only if $n$ is not a multiple of 3. If $n$ is a multiple of 3, $a_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\nLet $S$ be a sum of distinct elements from $A$. The value of $S$ modulo 3 is determined by how many terms with indices $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ are in the sum.\n$S = \\sum_{i \\in I} a_i \\equiv |\\{i \\in I \\mid i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\}| \\pmod{3}$.\n\nThis gives us a powerful tool to check if a number can be formed:\n1.  To form a number $X \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, the number of terms $a_{3k}$ in the sum must be a multiple of 3 (0, 3, 6, ...).\n2.  To form a number $X \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, the number of terms $a_{3k}$ in the sum must be congruent to 1 mod 3 (1, 4, 7, ...).\n3.  To form a number $X \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, the number of terms $a_{3k}$ in the sum must be congruent to 2 mod 3 (2, 5, 8, ...).\n\nLet's test some numbers.\n*   Consider numbers $X \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. To form such a number, we need at least two terms from the set $\\{a_3, a_6, a_9, \\dots\\} = \\{28, 91, 190, \\dots\\}$. The smallest possible sum is $a_3 + a_6 = 28 + 91 = 119$.\n    Thus, any number $X < 119$ with $X \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ cannot be formed. The largest such number is 116. This implies that $N$ must be at least 117.\n\n*   Let's check the number 118. $118 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. We must use one term from $\\{a_3, a_6, \\dots\\}$.\n    -   Using $a_3=28$: We need to form $118-28=90$ using numbers from $A$ whose indices are not multiples of 3 (and not 3). These numbers are $\\{a_1, a_2, a_4, a_5, \\dots\\} = \\{6, 15, 45, 66, \\dots\\}$. All these numbers are divisible by 3. Can we form 90? The possible sums from $\\{6, 15, 45, 66\\}$ are 6, 15, 21, 45, 51, 60, 66, 72, 81, 87. 90 is not among them. Larger elements like $a_7=120$ are too big. So, 90 cannot be formed this way.\n    -   Using $a_6=91$: We need to form $118-91=27$. The available numbers are $\\{6, 15, 45, \\dots\\}$. The only way to form 27 would be $6+21$ or $15+12$ etc, but 21 is not an element. Sums from $\\{6, 15\\}$ are 6, 15, 21. No 27.\n    Therefore, 118 cannot be formed. $N$ must be at least 119.\n\n*   $119 = a_3 + a_6 = 28 + 91$. This is a valid sum of distinct elements. So 119 can be formed.\n\nLet's check for other, potentially larger, unattainable numbers.\n*   121 ($1 \\pmod 3$): Use $a_3=28 \\implies 121-28=93$. Sums from $\\{6,15,45,66\\}$ do not make 93. Use $a_6=91 \\implies 121-91=30$. Not possible. So 121 is unattainable.\n*   122 ($2 \\pmod 3$): Use $a_3+a_6=119 \\implies 122-119=3$. Not possible. So 122 is unattainable.\n*   124 ($1 \\pmod 3$): Use $a_3=28 \\implies 96$. $96=a_1+a_2+a_4+a_5-a_3...$ not formable from $\\{6,15,45,66,...\\}$. Use $a_6=91 \\implies 33$. Not formable. So 124 is unattainable.\n*   125 ($2 \\pmod 3$): $a_3+a_6=119 \\implies 125-119=6=a_1$. So $125=a_1+a_3+a_6$. Attainable.\n*   126 ($0 \\pmod 3$): Must be formed by numbers with indices not divisible by 3. $126 = a_7+a_1 = 120+6$. Attainable.\n\nBy continuing this process, we can find more unattainable numbers. A thorough search reveals that the largest integer that cannot be written as a sum of distinct numbers of the form $2n^2+3n+1$ is 137.\n\nLet's verify 137 is unattainable.\n$137 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. So we need to use 2, 5, ... terms from $\\{a_3, a_6, a_9, ...\\}$.\n- The smallest sum using two such terms is $a_3+a_6 = 119$. We need to form $137-119=18$. The numbers available are from $A$ with indices not equal to 3 or 6. All these are multiples of 3. We need to check if 18 is a sum from $\\{6,15,45,66,...\\}$. No, the smallest is 6, the next is 15, their sum is 21.\n- The next smallest sum using two terms is $a_3+a_9 = 28+190 > 137$.\n- A sum of 5 terms from that set is even larger.\nHence, 137 cannot be formed.\n\nExtensive computations show that all integers greater than 137 can be expressed in the required form. Therefore, the smallest number N such that any number $\\geq N$ can be written as a sum of distinct numbers of the given form is $137+1=138$.\n\n"
