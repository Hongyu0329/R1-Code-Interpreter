    "To find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the 8-point sequence `{x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}`, we must first understand the operations involved.\n\nThe given sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, is an 8-point sequence formed by interleaving the 4-point sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\nComputing an N-point DFT for a sequence of length M, where M > N, involves time-domain aliasing. To find the 4-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(n)`, we first create a 4-point sequence, `z(n)`, by circularly folding `y(n)` onto itself:\n`z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nLet's determine the elements of `z(n)`:\n*   `z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = x(0) + x(2)`\n*   `z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = h(0) + h(2)`\n*   `z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = x(1) + x(3)`\n*   `z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = h(1) + h(3)`\n\nThe sequence `z(n)` can be viewed as an interleaving of two 2-point sequences:\n*   `x_p(n) = {x(0)+x(2), x(1)+x(3)}`\n*   `h_p(n) = {h(0)+h(2), h(1)+h(3)}`\n\nThe 4-point DFT of `z(n)`, which we denote as `Z(k)`, can be found using the decimation-in-time (DIT) property. This relates `Z(k)` to the 2-point DFTs of `x_p(n)` and `h_p(n)`, which we will call `X_p(k)` and `H_p(k)`.\nThe DIT butterfly formulas are:\n*   `Z(k) = X_p(k) + W_4^k * H_p(k)` for k = 0, 1\n*   `Z(k+2) = X_p(k) - W_4^k * H_p(k)` for k = 0, 1\nwhere `W_4^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / 4)` are the DFT twiddle factors.\n\nNext, we find `X_p(k)` and `H_p(k)`. The sequence `x_p(n)` is the 2-point time-aliased version of the 4-point sequence `x(n)`. A property of the DFT states that the DFT of a time-aliased sequence is a sampled version of the original sequence's DFT. Therefore:\n*   `X_p(k) = X(2k)` for k = 0, 1\n*   `H_p(k) = H(2k)` for k = 0, 1\n\nUsing the given DFTs:\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nWe can find `X_p(k)` and `H_p(k)`:\n*   `X_p(0) = X(0) = 1`\n*   `X_p(1) = X(2) = -1`\nSo, `X_p(k) = [1, -1]`.\n\n*   `H_p(0) = H(0) = 0`\n*   `H_p(1) = H(2) = 1`\nSo, `H_p(k) = [0, 1]`.\n\nFinally, we calculate `Z(k)` using the butterfly formulas with `W_4^0 = 1` and `W_4^1 = -j`:\n*   For k=0:\n    *   `Z(0) = X_p(0) + W_4^0 * H_p(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n    *   `Z(2) = X_p(0) - W_4^0 * H_p(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n*   For k=1:\n    *   `Z(1) = X_p(1) + W_4^1 * H_p(1) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n    *   `Z(3) = X_p(1) - W_4^1 * H_p(1) = -1 - (-j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\nCombining these results, the 4-point DFT is:\n`Z(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
