    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$, up to conjugacy by elements of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, can be determined by examining the structure of the Weyl group and the action of the Frobenius endomorphism.\n\nA reductive group over a finite field is quasi-split. For a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be split.\n\nFor a split reductive group over a finite field, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. The set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted as $W(E_8)$. The order of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is $696,729,600$. The number of its conjugacy classes is a known result in the theory of reflection groups.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
