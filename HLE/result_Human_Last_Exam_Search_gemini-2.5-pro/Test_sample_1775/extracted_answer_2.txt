The displacement field $\vec{D}$ through the transistor is the vector sum of the displacement fields generated by the top and bottom gates. Assuming the z-axis is perpendicular to the gates and points upwards, the displacement field from the top gate is $\vec{D}_{tg} = -C_{tg}V_{tg}\hat{z}$ and from the bottom gate is $\vec{D}_{bg} = C_{bg}V_{bg}\hat{z}$.

The total displacement field is therefore:
$\vec{D} = (C_{bg}V_{bg} - C_{tg}V_{tg})\hat{z}$

The magnitude of the displacement field is $|C_{bg}V_{bg} - C_{tg}V_{tg}|$. The dielectric constant of the transistor material, $\epsilon_s$, is not needed for this calculation under the assumption that the grounded channel acts as a perfect conducting plane, which decouples the top and bottom gate capacitors.
