    "The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping is 1/25, or 0.04. This is determined by the structure of the graph and the mechanics of the gossiping process.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Barbell Graph Structure\nA barbell graph is constructed by connecting two complete graphs (cliques) with a bridge. For a 10-node barbell graph, the most common configuration consists of two 5-node complete graphs (K5), connected by a single edge.\n\n*   **Cliques:** Two K5 graphs, let's call them Clique A and Clique B.\n*   **Total Nodes (N):** 10 (5 in each clique).\n*   **Bottleneck Edge:** The single edge that connects a node from Clique A to a node from Clique B. This is the bottleneck of the graph.\n\n### 2. Defining Randomized Uniform Gossiping\nRandomized uniform gossiping is a process where at each step, one node is selected uniformly at random from the entire network, and this node then chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to interact with. The \"sampled edge\" is the one used for this interaction.\n\n### 3. Calculating Node Degrees\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. The probability of an edge being chosen depends on the degrees of the two nodes it connects.\n\n*   **Bridgehead Nodes:** These are the two nodes (one in each clique) connected by the bottleneck edge. The degree of a bridgehead node is the sum of its connections within its own clique (4) and the one connection via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Degree of a bridgehead node = (5 - 1) + 1 = 5.\n*   **Internal Nodes:** These are the other 8 nodes (4 in each clique) that are not connected to the bottleneck edge. Their connections are all within their own K5 clique.\n    *   Degree of an internal node = 5 - 1 = 4.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Sampling Probability\nThe bottleneck edge is sampled if one of the two bridgehead nodes is selected and chooses to gossip across the bottleneck edge. Let's call the bridgehead nodes `u` and `v`.\n\nThe probability of sampling the edge `(u,v)` is the sum of two scenarios:\n1.  Node `u` is chosen and it selects node `v`.\n2.  Node `v` is chosen and it selects node `u`.\n\nThe calculations are as follows:\n*   The probability of selecting any specific node from the 10 total nodes is 1/10.\n*   The probability of a chosen node `u` selecting its neighbor `v` is 1 / degree(`u`).\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** Node `u` (a bridgehead with degree 5) is chosen and it gossips with `v`.\n    *   Probability = P(choose `u`) × P(`u` chooses `v`) = (1/10) × (1/5) = 1/50.\n\n*   **Scenario 2:** Node `v` (the other bridgehead, also with degree 5) is chosen and it gossips with `u`.\n    *   Probability = P(choose `v`) × P(`v` chooses `u`) = (1/10) × (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events:\n\n**Total Probability** = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = **1/25**.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
