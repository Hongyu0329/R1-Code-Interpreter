    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 96.\n\nThe BCH formula, which expresses the solution Z for e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup> = e<sup>Z</sup> in terms of iterated commutators of X and Y, has a specific number of non-vanishing terms at each order. For any given order *n*, not all possible commutators (basis elements of the free Lie algebra on two generators) have a non-zero coefficient.\n\nThe sequence enumerating the number of these nonzero coefficients is cataloged in The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005489. For order *n*=10, the value listed in this sequence is 96. The sequence begins: 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, ... corresponding to orders *n* = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ... respectively.\n\nResearch papers on the computation of the BCH series confirm that the number of non-zero coefficients is a well-defined and computable value for each order, distinct from the total number of basis elements in the corresponding free Lie algebra.\n\n<<<96>>>"
