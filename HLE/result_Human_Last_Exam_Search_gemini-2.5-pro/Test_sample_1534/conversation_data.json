    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily other lobes within the posterior subesophageal mass. This part of the brain controls motor functions in the rear part of the animal's body.\n\nThe key adjacent posterior regions include:\n*   **Posterior Chromatophore Lobes:** These lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores (color-and-pattern-changing skin cells) on the mantle, fin, and back of the head.\n*   **Fin Lobes:** These paired lobes control the movement of the cuttlefish's fins.\n*   **Magnocellular Lobe:** This lobe contains giant cells that are part of the giant-fiber system used for powerful jet-propulsion escape behaviors.\n*   **Vasomotor Lobes:** These lobes are also part of the palliovisceral ganglion.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe itself is part of a larger \"palliovisceral lobe complex,\" which, in addition to the palliovisceral lobe proper, includes the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes. Together, these structures make up a significant portion of the posterior region of the subesophageal mass, which is encased by cartilage at the back of the head. The pallial nerves, which carry motor signals to the mantle, exit from this posterior side of the brain."
