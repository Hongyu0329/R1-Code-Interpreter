    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **suster**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is a hybrid, resulting from the influence of the Old Norse word *systir* on the native Old English word. The original Old English term had two primary forms: *sweostor* and *swuster*. The \"i\" vowel in today's \"sister\" is a direct result of the Scandinavian linguistic influence.\n\nWithout this Norse interaction, the word would have followed a purely English evolution. The Old English variant *swuster* commonly simplified to *suster* in Middle English, becoming a dominant form. This transformation is evident in compound words like the Old English *sweostorsunu* (\"sister's son\"), which became *sustersone* in Middle English before the first part was later amended to \"sister\" under Norse influence.\n\nThe typical evolution of the short \"u\" sound from Middle English, as seen in words like *sunu* (son) and *cuman* (come), would have resulted in a word pronounced with a short \"u\" sound like in \"cup.\" Therefore, the spelling would likely have remained *suster*, rhyming with \"buster\" or \"duster\". An alternative, though slightly less probable, evolution could have resulted in \"soster,\" rhyming with \"foster,\" due to a Middle English scribal practice of replacing \"u\" with \"o\" for clarity in handwriting.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
