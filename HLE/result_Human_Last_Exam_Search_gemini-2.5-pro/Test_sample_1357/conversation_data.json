    "Under the assumption that the Jacobian of a genus 4 curve defined over a valuation field has good reduction, there are 11 types of stable reductions for the curve.\n\nThe condition that the Jacobian variety J(C) of a curve C has good reduction means that its Néron model over the valuation ring is an abelian scheme. This has a crucial consequence for the structure of the stable reduction of the curve C. The toric rank of the identity component of the special fiber of the Néron model of J(C) is determined by the first Betti number of the dual graph of the stable reduction of C. For the Jacobian to have good reduction, this toric rank must be zero, which implies that the dual graph of the stable reduction must be a tree.\n\nFurthermore, the arithmetic genus of the stable reduction, which is 4, is given by the formula `p_a = Σg_i + δ - v + 1`, where `g_i` are the genera of the irreducible components, `δ` is the number of nodes, and `v` is the number of components. For a tree, the number of nodes (edges) is `δ = v - 1`. Substituting this into the formula gives `4 = Σg_i`.\n\nThus, the problem is transformed into a combinatorial one: to find the number of distinct stable dual graphs of genus 4 that are trees and whose vertices (representing irreducible components) are weighted by their geometric genera, with the sum of these genera being 4. A stable graph also requires that any component of genus 0 (a rational curve) must connect to the other components at a minimum of three points, meaning the corresponding vertex in the dual graph must have a degree of at least 3.\n\nThe 11 types of stable reductions correspond to the following configurations, classified by their dual graphs:\n\n### A. Reductions with no rational components (Σgᵢ = 4, gᵢ > 0)\n1.  **One component:**\n    *   A single smooth curve of genus 4. This is the case where the curve itself has good reduction. (1 type)\n2.  **Two components:** The dual graph is two vertices connected by an edge. The partitions of 4 into two positive integers are 3+1 and 2+2.\n    *   A genus 3 curve attached to an elliptic curve. (1 type)\n    *   Two genus 2 curves attached to each other. (1 type)\n3.  **Three components:** The only possible tree is a path graph (a chain). The only partition of 4 into three positive integers is 2+1+1.\n    *   A central genus 2 curve with an elliptic curve attached to it on two different points. (1 type)\n    *   A central elliptic curve with a genus 2 curve and another elliptic curve attached at distinct points. (1 type)\n4.  **Four components:** The only partition of 4 into four positive integers is 1+1+1+1. There are two possible tree structures for four vertices.\n    *   Four elliptic curves arranged in a chain. (1 type)\n    *   A central elliptic curve with three other elliptic curves attached at distinct points (a star graph). (1 type)\n\n### B. Reductions with rational components (gᵢ=0, degree ≥ 3)\n5.  **One rational component:**\n    *   **Four total components:** The partition must be 2+1+1+0. For the rational component to have a degree of at least 3, the graph must be a star with the rational curve at the center. The leaves are the genus 2 and two genus 1 components. (1 type)\n    *   **Five total components:** The partition must be 1+1+1+1+0.\n        *   The graph is a star with the rational curve at the center (degree 4), and four elliptic curves as leaves. (1 type)\n        *   The graph is a \"fork\" (one vertex of degree 3). The rational curve is the degree-3 vertex, connected to three genus 1 components, one of which is not a leaf. (1 type)\n6.  **Two rational components:**\n    *   **Six total components:** The partition must be 1+1+1+1+0+0. For two rational components to both have a degree of at least 3, the tree must have at least `(3+3+1+1+1+1) / 2 = 5` edges, meaning at least 6 vertices. A possible graph is two central rational curves connected to each other, with each also connected to two elliptic curves (leaves). This structure satisfies all conditions. (1 type)\n\nIn total, this gives 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11 types of stable reductions.\n\n<<<11>>>"
