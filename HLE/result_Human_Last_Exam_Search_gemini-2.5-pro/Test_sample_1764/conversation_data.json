    "An isometric embedding is a function $f$ from a metric space $(X, d_X)$ to another metric space $(Y, d_Y)$ that preserves distances, i.e., for any two points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the equality $d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) = d_X(x_1, x_2)$ holds. In this problem, the domain is a finite ultrametric space $X$ and the codomain is a Banach space $B$, whose metric is induced by its norm, $d_B(b_1, b_2) = \\|b_1 - b_2\\|$.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of such isometric embeddings. This number depends on the specific choice of the space $X$ and the Banach space $B$. To find the smallest possible number, we are free to choose $X$ and $B$ to minimize this count.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1.  **Can the number of embeddings be greater than 1?**\n    Yes. For instance, consider the ultrametric space $X = \\{p_1, p_2\\}$ with distance $d(p_1, p_2) = 1$. Let the Banach space be the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard absolute value norm. An isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must satisfy $|f(p_1) - f(p_2)| = 1$.\n    One such embedding is $f(p_1) = 0, f(p_2) = 1$.\n    However, for any real number $c$, the translated function $g(x) = f(x) + c$ is also an isometric embedding, since $|(f(p_1)+c) - (f(p_2)+c)| = |f(p_1)-f(p_2)| = 1$. Since there are infinitely many choices for $c$, there are infinitely many embeddings in this case.\n\n2.  **Can the number of embeddings be exactly 1?**\n    Yes. Consider the simplest finite ultrametric space: a single-point space $X = \\{p\\}$. The only distance is $d(p,p) = 0$.\n    Now, consider the simplest Banach space: the trivial space $B = \\{0\\}$, which consists of only the zero vector. Its norm is $\\|0\\| = 0$ and its cardinality is $K=1$.\n    An isometric embedding is a function $f: \\{p\\} \\to \\{0\\}$ such that $\\|f(p) - f(p)\\| = d(p,p)$.\n    There is only one possible function, which maps $p$ to $0$. For this function, we check the condition: $\\|0-0\\| = 0$, which is equal to $d(p,p)=0$. The condition is satisfied.\n    Thus, for this choice of $X$ and $B$, there is exactly one isometric embedding.\n\n3.  **Can the number of embeddings be 0?**\n    For the number of embeddings to be 0, we need to find a pair $(X, B)$ for which no isometric embedding exists.\n    Let's choose a finite ultrametric space $X$ that has at least two distinct points, for instance, $X = \\{p_1, p_2\\}$ with the distance $d(p_1, p_2) = 1$ (and $d(p_1, p_1) = d(p_2, p_2) = 0$). This is a valid ultrametric space.\n    Let's choose the trivial Banach space $B = \\{0\\}$, which has cardinality $K=1$.\n    An isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ would have to satisfy the condition $\\|f(p_1) - f(p_2)\\| = d(p_1, p_2) = 1$.\n    However, since the only point in the codomain $B$ is the zero vector, any function $f$ must map both $p_1$ and $p_2$ to $0$.\n    So, $f(p_1)=0$ and $f(p_2)=0$.\n    The norm of their difference is $\\|f(p_1) - f(p_2)\\| = \\|0 - 0\\| = 0$.\n    For an isometric embedding to exist, we would need to satisfy the condition $0 = 1$, which is a contradiction.\n    Therefore, no isometric embedding exists for this choice of $X$ and $B$. The number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\nSince the number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer, and we have found a valid case where the number is 0, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
