    "During the process of glycolysis, a six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. This metabolic pathway itself does not involve any steps where carbon dioxide is released. The conservation of carbons is maintained, as the six carbons from glucose are all accounted for in the two pyruvate molecules produced.\n\nThe release of carbon dioxide occurs in the subsequent stages of cellular respiration. Specifically, CO2 is produced during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (a process called pyruvate decarboxylation or the transition reaction) and within the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle).\n\nTherefore, if considering only the pathway of glycolysis, no ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules will be released.\n\n<<<0>>>"
