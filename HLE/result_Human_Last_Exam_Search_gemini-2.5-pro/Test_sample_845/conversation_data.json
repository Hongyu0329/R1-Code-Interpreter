    "The value computed between heartbeats, which is used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV), is called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nWhen using photoplethysmography (PPG), this interval is more specifically referred to as the **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI)**. This is because PPG measures the time between consecutive pulse waves in the blood vessels, rather than the electrical R-peaks of an ECG.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n*   **Interbeat Interval (IBI):** This is the general term for the time between consecutive heartbeats. It's the primary input for calculating HRV.\n*   **R-R Interval (RRI):** This is the specific term used when measuring the interval between the \"R\" peaks of an electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform. ECG is considered the gold standard for HRV measurement.\n*   **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI):** This is the term for the IBI measured by PPG. It is widely considered a reliable alternative to the R-R interval for HRV analysis, especially during periods of rest.\n\nIn summary, while different names exist depending on the measurement technology (ECG vs. PPG), the fundamental value representing the time between successive heartbeats is the Interbeat Interval (IBI). HRV metrics, such as RMSSD and SDNN, are then mathematically derived from a series of these IBIs.\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI)"
