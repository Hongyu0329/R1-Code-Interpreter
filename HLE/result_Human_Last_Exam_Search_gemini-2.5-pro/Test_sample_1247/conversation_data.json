    "The value \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\) denotes the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) that avoid the pattern \\(\\sigma\\) and have exactly \\(k\\) inversions. You are asked to determine \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which is the number of permutations of length 333 that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly 3 inversions.\n\nFor a permutation to have a very small number of inversions compared to its length, it must be \"close\" to the identity permutation (1, 2, 3, ..., n). The inversions are created by a small number of elements being out of their sorted order. For \\(k=3\\), the number of elements that are not fixed points (i.e., \\(p_i \\neq i\\)) is either 3 or 4.\n\nA detailed combinatorial analysis reveals the specific structures of permutations with 3 inversions that avoid the 1324 pattern. A permutation \\(\\pi\\) contains the pattern 1324 if there exist indices \\(i<j<k<l\\) such that \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\). The permutations with 3 inversions that avoid this pattern are found to be limited to a few specific structural forms.\n\nThese avoiding permutations are constructed by taking the identity permutation and displacing a small block of consecutive integers either at the beginning or at the end. For \\(n=333\\) and \\(k=3\\), the specific permutations are:\n\n1.  **Type 1: Based on the `321` pattern.**\n    *   The permutation `3, 2, 1, 4, 5, ..., 333`. This permutation has inversions (3,2), (3,1), and (2,1). It can be shown to avoid the 1324 pattern.\n    *   The permutation `1, 2, ..., 330, 333, 332, 331`. This is the reverse of the first type and also avoids 1324.\n\n2.  **Type 2: Based on the `4123` pattern.**\n    *   The permutation `4, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..., 333`. This has inversions (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3). This permutation avoids the 1324 pattern.\n    *   The permutation `1, 2, ..., 329, 333, 330, 331, 332`. This is the reverse of the previous type and avoids 1324.\n\n3.  **Type 3: Based on the `2341` pattern.**\n    *   The permutation `2, 3, 4, 1, 5, ..., 333`. This has inversions (2,1), (3,1), and (4,1). This avoids the 1324 pattern.\n    *   The permutation `1, 2, ..., 329, 331, 332, 333, 330`. This is the reverse of the previous type and also avoids 1324.\n\nOther possible structures for permutations with 3 inversions, such as those based on the patterns `2413` and `3142`, can be shown to contain the 1324 pattern for lengths greater than or equal to 5.\n\nThus, for \\(n=333\\), there are a total of 6 such permutations. The number of these permutations does not depend on the length \\(n\\) as long as \\(n\\) is sufficiently large (n \\(\\ge\\) 5).\n\nTherefore, there are 6 permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\n<<<6>>>"
