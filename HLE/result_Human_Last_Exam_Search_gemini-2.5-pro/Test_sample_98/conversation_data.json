    "When an icosahedron tank is standing on one of its faces, it rests on a horizontal equilateral triangle. Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, there is an identical, parallel triangular face at the top. An icosahedron has a point of symmetry at its geometric center. This means that any plane passing through the center that is parallel to the base will divide the icosahedron into two equal volumes.\n\nIn a gravitational field, the surface of a liquid at rest is always a horizontal plane. When the tank is half-filled, the water will occupy half of the total volume of the icosahedron. Because of the icosahedron's symmetry, the water level will be exactly at the horizontal plane that passes through the center of the shape.\n\nThe shape of the water's surface is therefore the shape of the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at its center. When an icosahedron is oriented on one of its faces, the cross-section at its mid-height is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<Hexagon>>>"
