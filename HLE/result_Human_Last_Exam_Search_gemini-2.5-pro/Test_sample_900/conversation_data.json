    "It is not possible to provide a definitive number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the \"Jete Woman\" solo from the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\"\n\nThere are several reasons for this:\n\n*   **Ambiguity of the Term:** The term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a standard, universally defined step in the ballet lexicon in the same way as a *grand jeté* or *plié*. While George Balanchine is a renowned choreographer with a distinct and influential style characterized by speed, dynamism, and athleticism, there is not a specific, singular step that is officially named the \"pas de Balanchine\". Online tutorials show a step referred to as \"pas de Balanchine\" that involves a jump and two steps, but this is not a universally recognized term. It is possible the user is referring to a recurring step within the choreography that is reminiscent of Balanchine's style.\n*   **Choreographic Nuance:** William Forsythe's choreography is known for its deconstruction and evolution of the classical ballet vocabulary. His work is influenced by Balanchine, and some of his choreography has been compared to Balanchine's work, such as *Agon*. It is more likely that the solo contains steps that are *in the style of* Balanchine rather than a repeated, formally named \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n*   **Lack of Available Footage:** While it is confirmed that Svetlana Gileva, a principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett, performed this role in 2015, the specific video of her \"Jete Woman\" solo from that year is not publicly available online. Without a visual record of the performance, it is impossible to count any specific recurring movements.\n\nReviews and articles about the performance praise the Semperoper Ballett's interpretation of Forsythe's work but do not break down the choreography to the level of counting individual steps. Therefore, a precise count cannot be furnished.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a numerical answer to your question as the term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a standard ballet step and video of the specific performance is not available for analysis.>>>"
