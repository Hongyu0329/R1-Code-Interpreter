    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different behaviors, and these are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nWe are considering the system in the upper half-plane, where \\(u \\geq 0\\).\n\n### **1. Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) occur where the derivatives are zero.\n\nFrom \\(u'(t) = 0\\), we have \\(u^2(u-1) = 0\\), which gives \\(u = 0\\) or \\(u = 1\\).\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting into the equation for \\(d'(t)\\):\n    \\(2d^2 + 0 - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0\\).\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting into the equation for \\(d'(t)\\):\n    \\(2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0\\).\n    This gives \\(d = 0\\) or \\(d = -1\\).\n    Thus, we have two more equilibrium points: **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n### **2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the stability of these points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluate its eigenvalues at each point.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$$ J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $$ J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The eigenvalues are \\(\\lambda_1 = 2\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = 1\\). Since both are positive, **(0, 1) is an unstable node (a source)**.\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $$ J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The eigenvalues are \\(\\lambda_1 = -2\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = 1\\). Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so linearization fails. This is a degenerate critical point.\n\n### **3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point at (-1, 1). We look for a special trajectory that corresponds to one of these manifolds.\n\nBy testing a particular form of solution, we can verify that the curve defined by the equation **\\(d = -u^2\\)** is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\nLet's check this. If \\(d = -u^2\\), then \\(d'(t) = -2u(t) \\cdot u'(t)\\).\nSubstituting \\(u'(t) = u^3 - u^2\\), we get:\n$$d'(t) = -2u(u^3 - u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$$\n\nNow, we substitute \\(d = -u^2\\) into the original equation for \\(d'(t)\\):\n$$d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$$\n$$d'(t) = 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4$$\n$$d'(t) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$$\n\nSince both expressions for \\(d'(t)\\) are identical, the curve \\(d = -u^2\\) is indeed a solution trajectory.\n\nThis curve passes through two of the equilibrium points:\n*   When \\(u=1\\), \\(d = -(1)^2 = -1\\), which is the saddle point **(-1, 1)**.\n*   When \\(u=0\\), \\(d = -(0)^2 = 0\\), which is the degenerate point **(0, 0)**.\n\nA trajectory that passes through a saddle point must be part of its stable or unstable manifold. In the region \\(0 < u < 1\\), the flow is from \\(u=1\\) towards \\(u=0\\) (since \\(u' = u^2(u-1) < 0\\)). This means the trajectory along \\(d = -u^2\\) moves away from the saddle point (-1, 1) and towards the origin (0, 0). Therefore, this curve is part of the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nAs an unstable manifold of a saddle point, the curve \\(d = -u^2\\) is a separatrix of the system.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve given by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
