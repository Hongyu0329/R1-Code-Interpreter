    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we must first determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. The given set of equations is a Kolmogorov-Chapman system, which models a continuous-time Markov process. The steady-state probabilities, denoted as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, are found by setting the time derivatives to zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\nThe provided system of equations is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\nThere appears to be a typographical error in the second equation. The term for the probability flow from state 0 to state 1, $\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$, should be positive, representing an inflow to state 1. The standard form of the Kolmogorov forward equations confirms this. Using a negative sign leads to a trivial solution where all probabilities are zero, which is inconsistent with the normalization condition. Therefore, we proceed with the corrected equation for $P_1'(t)$:\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = \\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\nSetting the derivatives to zero for the steady state, we obtain the following system of linear equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\nThe given rate constants are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019\\pi_{0} + 0.65\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = 0.019\\pi_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4)\\pi_{1} + 0.392\\pi_{2} + 0.008\\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4\\pi_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008)\\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008\\pi_{2} - 0.008\\pi_{3}$\n\nFrom equation (4), we find:\n$0.008\\pi_{2} = 0.008\\pi_{3} \\implies \\pi_{2} = \\pi_{3}$\n\nFrom equation (3), we find:\n$0.4\\pi_{1} = (0.4)\\pi_{2} \\implies \\pi_{1} = \\pi_{2}$\nTherefore, we have the relationship $\\pi_{1} = \\pi_{2} = \\pi_{3}$.\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express $\\pi_{0}$ in terms of $\\pi_{1}$:\n$0.019\\pi_{0} = 0.65\\pi_{1} \\implies \\pi_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_{1}$\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition (equation 5):\n$\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\nSubstituting the relationships we found:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3)\\pi_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019})\\pi_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019})\\pi_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.707}{0.019})\\pi_{1} = 1 \\implies \\pi_{1} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nNow we can calculate $\\pi_{0}$:\n$\\pi_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\pi_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nThe problem asks for the sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = \\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1}$:\n$\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768$\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
