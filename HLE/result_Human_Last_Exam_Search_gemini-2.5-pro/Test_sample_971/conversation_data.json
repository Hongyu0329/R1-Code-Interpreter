    "It is not documented in readily available sources how many single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008.\n\nWhile there are video recordings of her performance from that year and numerous reviews praising her technical abilities, a precise count of this specific ballet step is not mentioned in written analyses or commentaries. The choreography for Kitri's variation in Act I is known for its demanding and energetic turns and jumps. A production guide for *Don Quixote* notes that the music for this variation accelerates as Kitri performs a series of pirouettes near the end.\n\nReviews from the period and later analyses highlight Osipova's exceptional talent for turning. However, to determine the exact number of pirouettes would require a visual analysis of the recorded performance, as this detailed choreographic information is not available in the public record.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number based on the available information.>>>"
