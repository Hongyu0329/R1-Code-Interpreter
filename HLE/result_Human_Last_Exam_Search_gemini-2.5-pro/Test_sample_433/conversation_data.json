    "According to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards, a single-dose ampule must be used immediately after it is opened in a sterile environment. Opened ampules cannot be stored for any amount of time and must be discarded after use. This is because once an ampule is broken, it becomes an open system that cannot be resealed, which increases the risk of contamination.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between a single-dose ampule and a single-dose vial. While a single-dose vial may have a Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of up to 12 hours after being punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, this does not apply to ampules.\n\n<<<immediate use>>>"
