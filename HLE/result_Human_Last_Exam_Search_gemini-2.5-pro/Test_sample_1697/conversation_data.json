    "The performed search confirms the initial analysis. Here is a breakdown of the key findings:\n\n*   **Directed *ortho*-Metalation (DoM):** This reaction involves the deprotonation of an aromatic ring at the position *ortho* to a Directing Metalation Group (DMG) by a strong base like an organolithium reagent. The DMG coordinates to the lithium, directing the deprotonation to the adjacent position.\n*   **Reagents:** *sec*-Butyllithium (sec-BuLi) is a very strong base, stronger and more sterically hindered than *n*-butyllithium, often used for deprotonating weak carbon acids. TMEDA is an additive that complexes with the lithium ion, deaggregating the organolithium reagent and increasing its reactivity. THF is a common ether solvent for these reactions.\n*   **Directing Group Ability:** The N,N-diethylamido group (-CONEt2) is a very powerful Directing Metalation Group. Competition experiments have established that the tertiary amide group is more effective at directing *ortho*-lithiation than many other groups, including the dimethylamino group (-NMe2).\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. It has two directing groups: the -CONEt2 group at position 1 and the -NMe2 group at position 3.\n    2.  The -CONEt2 group directs lithiation to the *ortho* positions (2 and 6). The -NMe2 group directs to its *ortho* positions (2 and 4).\n    3.  Both groups direct the lithiation to the C-2 position. Furthermore, the amide group is a stronger directing group than the amino group. Therefore, the highly basic sec-BuLi/TMEDA complex will selectively deprotonate the C-2 position of the benzene ring, forming an aryllithium intermediate.\n    4.  This nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate will then react with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH3I).\n    5.  The carbanion at C-2 will attack the methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\nFinal Answer: N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\nThe reaction is a directed *ortho*-metalation. The N,N-diethylamide group is a powerful directing group, stronger than the dimethylamino group. It directs the deprotonation by sec-BuLi/TMEDA to the *ortho* position (C-2). The resulting aryllithium species is then alkylated by methyl iodide.\n<<<The compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This reaction proceeds via a directed *ortho*-metalation mechanism. The N,N-diethylamido group (-CONEt2) on the benzamide is a potent directing group for lithiation. In the presence of the strong base *sec*-butyllithium (*sec*-BuLi) and the chelating agent TMEDA, a proton is selectively removed from the aromatic ring at the position *ortho* to the amide, which is the C-2 position. The dimethylamino group at the C-3 position also directs to the C-2 position, reinforcing this regioselectivity. The resulting aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile and reacts with the subsequently added electrophile, methyl iodide, to afford the methylated product, N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide."
