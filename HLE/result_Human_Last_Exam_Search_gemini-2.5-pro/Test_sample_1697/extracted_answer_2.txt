The compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This reaction proceeds via a directed *ortho*-metalation mechanism. The N,N-diethylamido group (-CONEt2) on the benzamide is a potent directing group for lithiation. In the presence of the strong base *sec*-butyllithium (*sec*-BuLi) and the chelating agent TMEDA, a proton is selectively removed from the aromatic ring at the position *ortho* to the amide, which is the C-2 position. The dimethylamino group at the C-3 position also directs to the C-2 position, reinforcing this regioselectivity. The resulting aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile and reacts with the subsequently added electrophile, methyl iodide, to afford the methylated product, N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.
