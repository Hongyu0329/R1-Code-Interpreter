    "The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The degeneracy is given by the formula GSD = 2^k, where *k* is the number of logical qubits the code can store.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the degeneracy is determined for a surface with holes:\n\n1.  **Base Surface:** For a simple surface without holes or handles (topologically equivalent to a sphere), the ground state is unique, meaning the degeneracy is 1. This corresponds to k=0 logical qubits.\n\n2.  **Holes and Boundaries:** Introducing a \"hole\" or a \"puncture\" into the surface creates a new boundary. In the context of the toric code, these boundaries can be of two types: \"smooth\" (also called closed or Z-type) or \"rough\" (also called open or X-type).\n    *   At a smooth boundary, electric charges ('e' anyons) can terminate, but magnetic fluxes ('m' anyons) cannot.\n    *   At a rough boundary, magnetic fluxes can terminate, but electric charges cannot.\n\n3.  **Contribution of Holes to Degeneracy:** Each hole, regardless of its type (smooth or rough), adds one logical qubit to the system. This means each hole doubles the ground state degeneracy.\n    *   A reference from a course by Michele Burrello explicitly states, \"The degeneracy of the ground state doubles for each hole\".\n    *   Another paper studying generalized surface codes provides a clear example: for a planar lattice with *b* closed (smooth) holes, the code encodes *k* = *b* qubits.\n    *   Therefore, *n* smooth holes contribute *n* logical qubits.\n    *   Similarly, *m* rough holes contribute *m* logical qubits.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the contributions from each hole.\n    *   Total logical qubits, *k* = *n* (from smooth holes) + *m* (from rough holes).\n    *   The ground space degeneracy is therefore 2^k = 2^(n+m).\n\nComparing this result to the given answer choices, it directly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
