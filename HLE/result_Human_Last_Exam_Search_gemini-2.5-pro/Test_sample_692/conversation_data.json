    "### The Earliest Recorded Date in the Americas: A Complex Picture\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is a subject of ongoing archaeological discovery and interpretation. While the Olmec civilization is credited with the earliest form of writing in the Americas, the most definitive early recorded date comes from the Epi-Olmec culture.\n\nThe oldest monument in the Americas with a date inscribed in its own writing system is the Chiapa de Corzo stela, which bears a Long Count date corresponding to **36 BCE**. This stela was found in Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico, and its script is known as Isthmian or Epi-Olmec.\n\nHowever, there is earlier, albeit less complete, evidence of dated writing. The Zapotec civilization, which flourished in the Valley of Oaxaca, developed one of the earliest writing systems in Mesoamerica. An artifact known as Monument 3 from San José Mogote, Oaxaca, features a relief of a slain captive with a glyph between his legs representing his name, \"1 Earthquake.\" This monument was initially dated to 500-600 BCE, which for a time was considered the earliest writing in Mesoamerica.\n\nEven earlier evidence of writing and calendrical signs comes from the Olmec civilization. Artifacts found at San Andrés, near the major Olmec center of La Venta in Tabasco, have been dated to around 650 BCE. These finds include a ceramic cylinder seal and greenstone plaque fragments with glyphs that have been interpreted as representing a form of writing. One of the glyphs has been identified as \"3 Ajaw,\" the name of a day in the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar, suggesting the use of calendrical dates at this early time.\n\nThe oldest known writing in the Americas is believed to be on the Cascajal Block, an Olmec artifact dated to approximately 900 BCE. Discovered in Veracruz, Mexico, this serpentine slab is incised with 62 distinct characters. While this is considered the earliest evidence of a writing system in the New World, the script remains undeciphered, and the block itself does not contain a recorded date.\n\nIn summary, while the practice of writing dates back to around 900 BCE with the Olmecs, and calendrical glyphs appeared as early as 650 BCE, the earliest known monument with a full, inscribed date is the Chiapa de Corzo stela from 36 BCE.\n\n<<<36 BCE>>>"
