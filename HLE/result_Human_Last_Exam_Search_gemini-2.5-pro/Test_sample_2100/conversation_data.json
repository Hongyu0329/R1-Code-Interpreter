    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was Nikolai Rezanov. The question in Voznesensky's poem about the location of his grave was a reference to a long-unanswered historical question.\n\nNikolai Rezanov was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer who undertook a mission to establish relations with Japan and inspect the Russian-American Company's colonies in Alaska. In 1806, he sailed to Spanish California to secure provisions for the starving Russian colonies. There, he became engaged to Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the Presidio's commandant.\n\nOn his return journey across Siberia to seek the Tsar's permission to marry, Rezanov fell ill and died in Krasnoyarsk in March 1807. His grave, marked only by a stone altar without an inscription, was eventually lost. The mystery of its location was solved in the late 1980s when it was rediscovered. The story of Rezanov and Argüello became the basis for Voznesensky's famous rock opera, \"Juno and Avos\".\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
