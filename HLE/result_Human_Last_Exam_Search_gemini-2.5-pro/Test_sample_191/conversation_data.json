    "When the **Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)** is broken down, it produces amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides that can then be engulfed by macrophages.\n\nThe process begins with the sequential proteolytic cleavage of APP by two enzymes, β-secretase and γ-secretase. This breakdown releases Aβ peptides of varying lengths. These peptides, particularly the more aggregation-prone forms like Aβ42, can accumulate and form the amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThese Aβ aggregates are then recognized and targeted by macrophages and microglia (the resident immune cells of the brain) for engulfment through a process called phagocytosis. The Aβ peptides themselves can act as a signal that activates macrophages. Several receptors on the surface of macrophages, such as scavenger receptors and Toll-like receptors, are involved in binding and internalizing the amyloid-β aggregates. Additionally, other proteins can coat, or opsonize, the Aβ aggregates, which further enhances their uptake by macrophages.\n\nWhile macrophages are capable of clearing Aβ, in Alzheimer's disease, this clearance mechanism appears to be impaired, leading to the accumulation of amyloid plaques.\n\n<<<Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)>>>"
