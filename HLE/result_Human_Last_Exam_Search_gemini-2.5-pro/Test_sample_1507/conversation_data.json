    "The minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\nThe great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, with 20 intersecting triangular faces. Its \"outer-hull,\" or the surface visible from the outside, is its convex hull. The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has the same vertices as a great icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 triangular faces. Since the faces of the outer-hull are already triangles, no further triangulation is required. Therefore, the number of visible triangles from the outside is the number of faces of the regular icosahedron, which is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
