    "Milton's *Paradise Lost* mentions eight historical figures by name who are considered saints in various Christian traditions. These figures span from the Old Testament to the New Testament and include the first humans, archangels, and prophets.\n\nThe historical saints mentioned by name are:\n\n*   **Adam and Eve:** The first man and woman are central characters in the epic poem. Both are venerated as saints in some Christian traditions, with a feast day on December 24th in many European nations.\n\n*   **Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael:** These three archangels play significant roles in the narrative. Michael leads God's army against Satan, Gabriel is a divine messenger, and Raphael is sent to warn Adam and Eve. All three are considered saints in the Catholic tradition.\n\n*   **Enoch and Elijah:** Milton alludes to these two Old Testament prophets as \"translated saints,\" referring to the biblical accounts of their ascensions into heaven without dying. Both Enoch and Elijah are venerated as saints in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.\n\n*   **Saint Peter:** The apostle is mentioned in Book III of *Paradise Lost*.\n\nWhile the archangel Uriel is also a character in the poem, he is not one of the three archangels officially recognized as saints by the Catholic Church. Similarly, although the theological influence of figures like Saint Augustine on Milton's work is a subject of scholarly discussion, they are not explicitly named in the poem itself.\n\n<<<8>>>"
