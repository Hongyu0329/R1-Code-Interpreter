    "Over the finite ring R = Z/8Z, there are 22 equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables up to invertible linear transforms.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables over this ring is a polynomial of the shape `q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2`, where the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` are elements of Z/8Z. Two such forms are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables. The total count of these distinct classes is a known result in the theory of quadratic forms over rings.\n\nThe classification can be broken down as follows:\n*   **Imprimitive Forms**: These are quadratic forms where all coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` are divisible by 2. These forms can be expressed as `2q'`, where `q'` is a quadratic form over the ring Z/4Z. The number of equivalence classes of these imprimitive forms is equal to the total number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms over Z/4Z, which is 11.\n*   **Primitive Forms**: These are forms where at least one of the coefficients `a`, `b`, or `c` is not divisible by 2 (i.e., is a unit). There are 11 such classes of primitive forms over Z/8Z.\n\nCombining these two categories, the total number of equivalence classes is 11 (imprimitive) + 11 (primitive) = 22. This result is confirmed by multiple sources in number theory, including the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS A109772) which tabulates these numbers based on calculations by MacDonald.\n\n<<<22>>>"
