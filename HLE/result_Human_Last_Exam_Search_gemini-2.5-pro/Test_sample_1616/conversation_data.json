    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (third from the end) of a word. This often occurs when a suffix is added.\n\nAn analysis of the words reveals the following:\n*   **Derivative**: This word shows trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /aɪ/ in the base word *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative* (de-**riv**-a-tive).\n*   **Serenity**: This is another clear example of the rule. The tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity* (se-**ren**-i-ty).\n*   **Gratitude**: This word also follows the pattern. The tense vowel /eɪ/ in the related word *grateful* corresponds to the lax vowel /æ/ in *gratitude* (**grat**-i-tude), which is in the third-to-last syllable.\n*   **Pleasant**: This word has only two syllables, so it cannot undergo trisyllabic laxing. However, it does show a different kind of vowel shortening, known as disyllabic laxing, where the tense vowel /iː/ in *please* becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *pleasant*.\n*   **Southern**: While this word is now disyllabic, it is considered a classic, albeit complex, example of historical trisyllabic laxing. In Middle English, it was pronounced with three syllables (*sou-ther-ne*) which caused the long vowel of *south* to shorten. Subsequent sound changes reduced the word to two syllables.\n*   **Shadow**: This word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing as it only has two syllables. It derives from the Old English *sceadwe*, which already had a short vowel. Unlike the other words on the list, there is no related base word with a tense vowel that was shortened to form *shadow*. While a separate process of disyllabic laxing exists for pairs like *shade* -> *shadow*, the vowel in *shadow* itself originates from an already short Old English vowel.\n\nBased on this, *derivative*, *serenity*, and *gratitude* are clear examples of trisyllabic laxing. *Southern* is a historical case of the same rule. *Pleasant* exhibits a different type of laxing. *Shadow*, however, comes from a root that already had a short vowel and does not have a tense-vowel counterpart in the same way, making it the word that has not undergone this type of vowel-shortening development.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
