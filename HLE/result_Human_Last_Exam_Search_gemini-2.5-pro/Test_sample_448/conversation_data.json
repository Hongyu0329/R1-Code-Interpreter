    "**Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.**\n\nOf the naturally occurring noble gases—helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon—radon is by far the least abundant. Its extreme rarity is a consequence of its radioactive nature; it has no stable isotopes, and its most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.823 days.\n\nWhile other noble gases have significant reservoirs in the Earth's atmosphere and interior, radon exists only in trace amounts. It is continuously generated from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. However, due to its short half-life, its overall equilibrium concentration in the entirety of Earth's matter—encompassing the crust, mantle, core, and atmosphere—is exceptionally low. For instance, the concentration of radon in the Earth's crust is estimated to be on the order of 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram. In the atmosphere, its concentration is even more minuscule, at about 1 part in 10¹⁵ by volume.\n\nIn contrast, argon is the most abundant noble gas in the Earth's atmosphere and crust. The other non-radioactive noble gases like neon, helium, krypton, and xenon are all present in far greater quantities than radon. The synthetic noble gas oganesson does not occur naturally and is therefore not considered in this context.\n\nAlthough precise figures for the abundance of all noble gases throughout the entire terrestrial matter are subject to some scientific uncertainty, particularly regarding the mantle and core, the vast difference in the stability and resulting concentration of radon makes it unequivocally the rarest noble gas on Earth. This conclusion would have been the same in 2002.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
