The set M required to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution using the Banach fixed-point theorem is a closed subset of the Banach space of continuous functions on the interval that satisfy the boundary conditions.

Specifically, the space is X = {u ∈ C | u(0) = u(1) = 0}, equipped with the supremum norm ||u||_∞ = max_{x∈} |u(x)|. This is a complete metric space.

The set M is a closed ball within this space defined as:
**M = { u ∈ C | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and ||u||_∞ ≤ R }**

Here, R is a positive constant that must be chosen to ensure that the operator T is a contraction mapping that maps M into itself (T(M) ⊆ M). This leads to the following conditions on R:
1.  **Contraction:** The operator T must be a contraction on M. The Lipschitz constant for T is found to be q = exp(R)/8. For T to be a contraction, we need q < 1, which implies **exp(R) < 8**, or **R < ln(8)**.
2.  **Invariance:** The operator T must map the set M to itself. This means for any function u in M, its image Tu must also be in M. This condition is satisfied if **exp(R)/8 ≤ R**.

Therefore, the set M is the closed ball of radius R in the space of continuous functions on vanishing at the boundary, where R is any constant that satisfies **exp(R)/8 ≤ R** and **R < ln(8)**. For instance, choosing R=1 satisfies both conditions (e/8 ≤ 1 and 1 < ln(8) ≈ 2.079), making M = { u ∈ C | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and ||u||_∞ ≤ 1 } a valid set for the proof.
