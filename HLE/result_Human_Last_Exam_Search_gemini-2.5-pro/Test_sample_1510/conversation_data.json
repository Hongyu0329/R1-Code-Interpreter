    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe crystallographic point groups describe the rotational and reflectional symmetries of a pattern. In two dimensions, there are two possible point groups of order 2 (meaning they have two symmetry operations, one of which is the identity):\n\n*   **C₂ (also denoted as '2'):** This group contains the identity and a 180° rotation.\n*   **D₁ (also denoted as 'm'):** This group contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\nThe wallpaper groups are then classified based on which of these point groups they possess, along with their translational symmetries.\n\nThe wallpaper groups corresponding to these point groups are:\n\n1.  **p2:** This group has a point group of C₂. It features 180° rotation centers but lacks any reflections or glide reflections.\n2.  **pm:** This group has a point group of D₁. It is characterized by parallel reflection axes and no rotations.\n3.  **pg:** This group also has a point group of D₁. It does not contain reflections but instead has glide reflections, whose axes are all parallel.\n4.  **cm:** This group also corresponds to the D₁ point group. It contains parallel reflection axes and glide reflections midway between them.\n\nIn summary, one wallpaper group (`p2`) has point group C₂, and three wallpaper groups (`pm`, `pg`, `cm`) have point group D₁, for a total of four groups.\n\n<<<4>>>"
