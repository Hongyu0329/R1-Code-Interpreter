The probability of drawing a link \(y_{ij}\) between vertices i and j, given a specific graphon W drawn from the random measure F, is the integral of the graphon over the unit square: \( \int_0^1 \int_0^1 W(u, v) \,du \,dv \). The overall probability is the expectation of this integral over the distribution F: \( E_F \left[ \int_0^1 \int_0^1 W(u, v) \,du \,dv \right] \).
