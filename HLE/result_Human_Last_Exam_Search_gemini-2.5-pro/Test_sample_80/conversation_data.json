    "To solve this chess puzzle, we must first determine the total number of edge squares on a standard 8x8 chessboard and then find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on them.\n\n### Step 1: Counting the Edge Squares\n\nAn 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total. The edge squares consist of all squares on the first and eighth ranks, and the 'a' and 'h' files.\n\n*   **Squares on all four sides:** An 8x8 board has 8 squares per side.\n*   **Total edge squares:** There are 8 squares on each of the four sides. If we simply multiply 8 by 4, we double-count the 4 corner squares. Therefore, the correct calculation is (8 x 4) - 4, which equals 28. Alternatively, one can count the 4 corners plus the 24 non-corner edge squares.\n\nThe 28 edge squares are evenly divided by color: 14 are white and 14 are black.\n\n### Step 2: Placing the Maximum Number of Bishops\n\nThe goal is to place as many bishops as possible on these 28 squares so that no bishop attacks another. A key rule of chess is that bishops only move on diagonals, meaning they can only attack pieces on squares of the same color. This allows us to solve the problem by considering the white and black squares independently. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an entire 8x8 board is 14.\n\n**Bishops on White Edge Squares:**\nThere are 14 white squares on the perimeter. These squares form seven pairs where the two squares in each pair attack each other. These pairs are:\n*   a2 and b1\n*   a4 and d1\n*   a6 and f1\n*   a8 and h1\n*   c8 and h2\n*   e8 and h4\n*   g8 and h6\n\nSince you can only place one bishop in each of these seven pairs, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops you can place on the white edge squares is 7.\n\n**Bishops on Black Edge Squares:**\nSimilarly, there are 14 black squares on the perimeter which also form seven attacking pairs:\n*   a1 and h8\n*   a3 and c1\n*   a5 and e1\n*   a7 and g1\n*   b8 and h3\n*   d8 and h5\n*   f8 and h7\n\nFrom each pair, only one square can be occupied by a bishop. This means a maximum of 7 bishops can be placed on the black edge squares.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Empty Edge Squares\n\nBy combining the placements on both colors, the total number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is 7 (on white) + 7 (on black) = 14 bishops.\n\nTo find the number of edge squares without bishops, we subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares:\n\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (placed bishops) = 14\n\nTherefore, 14 edge squares would lack bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
