    "The symmetry of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends critically on the oxidation state of the central copper atom, as both copper(I) and copper(II) form stable complexes with this ligand, but with different geometries.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)\n\nThe copper(I) complex, with the formula [Cu(C₆H₁₄S₂)₂]⁺, adopts a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. In the crystal structure of its perchlorate salt, the cation possesses a crystallographically imposed S₄ (or ˉ4) point group symmetry. This point group includes an improper rotation axis (a 90° rotation followed by a reflection in the plane perpendicular to the axis) and a C₂ rotation axis coincident with the S₄ axis.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)\n\nThe copper(II) complex, [Cu(C₆H₁₄S₂)₂]²⁺, typically exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry, where the four sulfur atoms from the two ligands lie in a plane around the copper ion, with anions or solvent molecules coordinating at the axial positions. For the [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)₂](BF₄)₂ salt, the copper atom is located on a crystallographic center of inversion. This means the [CuS₄] core is centrosymmetric, and the point group of the cation is Cᵢ.\n\nTherefore, the point group is:\n*   **S₄** for the copper(I) complex.\n*   **Cᵢ** for the planar copper(II) complex cation found in the crystal.\n\n<<<S₄ for the copper(I) complex and Cᵢ for the copper(II) complex cation>>>"
