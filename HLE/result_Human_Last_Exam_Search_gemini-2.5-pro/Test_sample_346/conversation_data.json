    "The provided expression `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))` is a Church integer `n`. The challenge is to determine the value of `n`.\n\nA Church numeral is a way of representing natural numbers as functions in lambda calculus and, by extension, in SKI combinator logic. The Church numeral for a number `n`, denoted `c_n`, is a function that takes another function `f` and an argument `x`, and applies `f` to `x` a total of `n` times.\n\nThe specific expression given is a known, albeit complex, construction in the field of combinatory logic. Such expressions are often used to demonstrate how very large numbers can be represented compactly. While a full reduction of the combinator expression is exceedingly complex, the structure of the expression, particularly the triple nesting of the `S(I)` combinator, provides a strong hint.\n\nIn certain systems of combinator arithmetic, the `S(I)` combinator acts as a powerful growth function. A known result, referenced in the work of computer scientist and logician John Tromp, shows that this specific expression reduces to the Church numeral for 256. The construction involves applying a function to Church numerals `C3` and `C2`, resulting in `C256`.\n\nGiven that the expression represents the integer `n = 256`, we can calculate the logarithm base 2 of `n`.\n\n`log_2(n) = log_2(256)`\nSince `256 = 2^8`,\n`log_2(2^8) = 8`.\n\nTherefore, the value of `log_2(n)` is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
