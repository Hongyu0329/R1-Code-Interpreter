    "The Néron-Severi group of a variety, denoted NS(X), is the group of divisors modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank is called the Picard number, ρ(X). This problem concerns the smallest and largest possible values for the Picard number of X = Sym^15(C), the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C.\n\nLet C be a smooth projective curve of genus g, and let X = Sym^d(C) be its d-th symmetric power. For d ≥ 2g - 1, the Albanese map from X to the Jacobian of C, Jac(C), is a projective bundle. In this case, with g=3 and d=15, we have d = 15 ≥ 2*3 - 1 = 5. Thus, X is a projective bundle over its Albanese variety, which is the Jacobian of C, denoted J = Jac(C). The fiber of this bundle is the projective space P^(d-g) = P^(15-3) = P^12.\n\nFor a projective bundle over an abelian variety, the rank of the Néron-Severi group has a simple relationship with the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the base. Specifically, if X is a P^n-bundle over an abelian variety A, then the Picard number of X is given by ρ(X) = ρ(A) + 1. In our case, this means that the Picard number of X is ρ(X) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1.\n\nTherefore, finding the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is equivalent to finding the minimum and maximum possible Picard number for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**Smallest Rank:**\nFor a \"general\" or \"generic\" curve C of genus g, its Jacobian J = Jac(C) has a Néron-Severi group of rank 1. This means that the only algebraic cycles, up to homological equivalence, are integer multiples of the polarization class. This is a well-established result in the theory of abelian varieties.\n*   **Smallest ρ(Jac(C)) = 1**\nThis leads to the smallest possible rank for NS(X):\n*   Smallest ρ(X) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n**Largest Rank:**\nThe Picard number of an abelian variety A of dimension g is bounded by h^(1,1)(A), which is g^2. For a Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, the dimension is g=3, so the maximum possible Picard number is 3^2 = 9. This maximum is achieved if the Jacobian has complex multiplication by a sufficiently large order.\n\nAn example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian attains this maximum Picard number is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0. The Jacobian of the Fermat quartic is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers Z[i]. For such an abelian variety, the rank of the Néron-Severi group is indeed 9.\n*   **Largest ρ(Jac(C)) = 9**\nThis gives the largest possible rank for NS(X):\n*   Largest ρ(X) = 9 + 1 = 10\n\nIn conclusion, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface can range from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 10.\n\nThe smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2.\nThe largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 10.\n<<<Smallest rank: 2, Largest rank: 10>>>"
