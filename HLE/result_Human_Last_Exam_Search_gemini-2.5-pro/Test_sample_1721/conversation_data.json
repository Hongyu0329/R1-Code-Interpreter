    "The largest number $c$ such that there exists a subset $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ and $A+A$ containing no square numbers is $1/3$.\n\nThis can be established through a two-part argument:\n\n### Lower Bound: $c \\ge 1/3$\n\nA simple construction provides a lower bound for $c$. Consider the set $A$ consisting of all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\}$\nThe size of this set is $|A| = \\lfloor \\frac{N-1}{3} \\rfloor + 1$, which is approximately $N/3$.\n\nThe sum of any two elements $a_1, a_2$ from this set $A$ will be:\n$a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\nA number that is congruent to 2 modulo 3 can never be a perfect square. Perfect squares, when divided by 3, can only have a remainder of 0 or 1 ($0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, $1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$).\n\nThus, the sumset $A+A$ contains no squares. This construction demonstrates that a set $A$ with density $1/3$ exists, proving that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n### Upper Bound: $c \\le 1/3$\n\nProving that no denser set can be constructed is more complex. The problem was a known conjecture by the mathematician Imre Ruzsa, who speculated that the maximum size of such a set is $\\lfloor N/3 \\rfloor + O(1)$.\n\nThis conjecture was proven to be true by Péter Csikvári in 2014. In his paper \"On the largest subset of {1,...,n} with square-free sumset\", he established that for any set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ where $A+A$ contains no squares, the size of the set is bounded by:\n$|A| \\le \\lfloor N/3 \\rfloor + 1$\n\nThis upper bound on the size of $A$ directly impacts the constant $c$. The density $|A|/N$ is bounded by:\n$\\frac{|A|}{N} \\le \\frac{\\lfloor N/3 \\rfloor + 1}{N} = \\frac{N/3 + O(1)}{N} = \\frac{1}{3} + O(1/N)$\n\nAs $N$ approaches infinity, the term $O(1/N)$ vanishes, which implies that $c \\le 1/3$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince it has been established that $c \\ge 1/3$ and $c \\le 1/3$, the largest possible value for $c$ must be exactly $1/3$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
