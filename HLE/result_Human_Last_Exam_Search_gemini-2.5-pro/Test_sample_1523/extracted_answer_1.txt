In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field, the inner product of (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is the Euclidean action for the free scalar field, given by:

S_E[ϕ] = ½ ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d-1</sup>x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>) ϕ(τ, **x**)

where ϕ(τ, **x**) is the scalar field, τ is the imaginary time (from 0 to β = 1/T), **x** are the spatial coordinates, m is the mass of the field, and D_ϕ is the differential operator D_ϕ = -½ (∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> + ∇<sup>2</sup> - m<sup>2</sup>).
