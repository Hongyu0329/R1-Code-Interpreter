    "In the framework of finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field, denoted by ϕ, is expressed through a functional integral. This integral takes the form:\n\nZ = ∫ Dϕ *e*<sup>-*S*<sub>E</sub>[ϕ]</sup>\n\nHere, the integration is performed over all possible configurations of the field ϕ that are periodic in imaginary time with a period of β = 1/T, where T is the temperature. The term *S*<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] represents the Euclidean action of the scalar field.\n\nThe inner product (ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>) mentioned in your question corresponds to this Euclidean action for a free scalar field. The action is quadratic in the field, and can be written in the form:\n\n*S*<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = ½ ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d-1</sup>x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + *m*<sup>2</sup>) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nIn this expression:\n\n*   τ represents the imaginary time, which is integrated from 0 to β.\n*   **x** denotes the spatial coordinates in d-1 dimensions.\n*   *m* is the mass of the scalar field.\n*   ∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> is the second partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.\n*   ∇<sup>2</sup> is the Laplacian operator with respect to the spatial coordinates.\n\nFrom this form of the Euclidean action, we can identify the operator D<sub>ϕ</sub> as:\n\nD<sub>ϕ</sub> = -½ (∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> + ∇<sup>2</sup> - *m*<sup>2</sup>)\n\nTherefore, the inner product (ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>) is explicitly given by the integral of ϕ multiplied by the action of this second-order differential operator on ϕ, integrated over the Euclidean spacetime (the volume defined by the spatial dimensions and the imaginary time interval [0, β]). This inner product is a crucial component of the Gaussian functional integral that defines the partition function for a free neutral scalar field at finite temperature.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field, the inner product of (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is the Euclidean action for the free scalar field, given by:\n\nS_E[ϕ] = ½ ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d-1</sup>x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nwhere ϕ(τ, **x**) is the scalar field, τ is the imaginary time (from 0 to β = 1/T), **x** are the spatial coordinates, m is the mass of the field, and D_ϕ is the differential operator D_ϕ = -½ (∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> + ∇<sup>2</sup> - m<sup>2</sup>).>>>"
