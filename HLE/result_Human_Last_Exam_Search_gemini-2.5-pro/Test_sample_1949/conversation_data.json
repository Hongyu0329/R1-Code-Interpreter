    "Of the many rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the *Aeneid*, the three longest are a combination of real-world rivers and a significant mythological one, whose immense scale within the narrative rivals the geographic lengths of the others. These rivers are the Aras (historically known as the Araxes), the Styx, and the Tiber.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Aras River**, which flows for 1,072 kilometers (666 miles). In the *Aeneid*, it is referred to by its ancient name, Araxes. Virgil mentions it in the context of the vast and distant lands that are part of the Roman world, a symbol of the far-reaching power and destiny of Rome.\n\nThe second longest, and the most significant mythological river in the epic, is the **Styx**. While it does not have a literal, measurable length, its portrayal in Book 6 of the *Aeneid* suggests a vast and formidable scale. The Styx is described as the primary river of the underworld, encircling it, in some accounts, nine times. It forms the unbreachable boundary between the world of the living and the dead, a barrier so potent that even the gods fear to swear a false oath by its waters. The journey across the Styx is a pivotal moment in Aeneas's descent into the underworld, emphasizing its symbolic and narrative \"length\" as a great and perilous obstacle.\n\nThe third longest river mentioned is the **Tiber**, which runs for 406 kilometers (252 miles) through Italy. The Tiber is central to the latter half of the *Aeneid*, as it is on its banks that Aeneas and the Trojans finally arrive to establish their new home, the future site of Rome. Virgil refers to it as \"Father Tiber,\" personifying it as a divine and prophetic guide for Aeneas.\n\nOther notable rivers in the *Aeneid* include the remaining four rivers of the underworld: the Acheron (the river of woe), the Phlegethon (the river of fire), the Cocytus (the river of wailing), and the Lethe (the river of forgetfulness). While all play crucial roles in Aeneas's journey through the afterlife, the Styx is consistently depicted as the most significant and extensive of these mythological waterways.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Aras (Araxes), the Styx, and the Tiber.>>>"
