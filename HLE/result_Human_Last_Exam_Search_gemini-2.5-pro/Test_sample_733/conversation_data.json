    "There are exactly seven finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set (often called a locally maximal product-free set) of size 2 was completed by M. Giudici and S. Hart. Their research identifies the specific structures these groups must have. A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all `a, b` in `S`, the product `ab` is not in `S`. It is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\n\nThe seven finite groups are:\n*   **Five cyclic groups:** C₅, C₆, C₈, C₁₀, and C₁₂.\n*   **The Klein four-group:** C₂ × C₂.\n*   **The dihedral group of order 6:** D₆.\n\nIn their 2009 paper, Giudici and Hart determined all groups with a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size at most 2. For sets of size 2, the subgroup generated by the set itself must be one of the groups listed above.\n\n<<<7>>>"
