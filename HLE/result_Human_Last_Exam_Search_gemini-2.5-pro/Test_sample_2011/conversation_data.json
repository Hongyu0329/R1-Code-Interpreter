    "The initial reasoning seems to be correct, but the search results bring up an important distinction. The term \"clique\" is sometimes used to mean \"maximal clique\". A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by adding another vertex.\n\nIf the question is about the number of different sizes of *maximal* cliques, the problem becomes much more complex. Let's analyze this possibility.\n\nIf G has an induced clique K_k, and this K_k is also a *maximal* clique, it's not necessarily true that G has a *maximal* clique of size k-1.\nFor example, consider the complete graph K_n. The only maximal clique is K_n itself. So there is only 1 size of maximal clique.\nConsider a graph of n isolated vertices. The maximal cliques are the individual vertices. So there are n maximal cliques, but they are all of size 1. The number of sizes is 1.\n\nSo if the question implicitly means \"maximal cliques\", the answer is not 128.\nLet's re-read the question carefully: \"Determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single such graph.\"\nThe standard definition of a clique in graph theory is a subset of vertices that induces a complete subgraph. \"Maximal clique\" is a more specific term. \"Induced subgraph\" is the key here.\nAn induced subgraph that is a complete graph is the definition of a clique.\n\nIf a graph G has an induced subgraph H isomorphic to K_k, does it have an induced subgraph H' isomorphic to K_{k-1}?\nYes. Let V(H) be the vertex set of the induced K_k. Any subset V(H') of V(H) with k-1 vertices will induce a K_{k-1}. An induced subgraph of an induced subgraph is an induced subgraph of the original graph.\nSo, if a graph G has an induced clique of size k, it necessarily has induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to k.\nThe set of possible clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs is therefore always of the form {1, 2, ..., k_max}, where k_max is the size of the largest induced clique in the graph. This value k_max is known as the clique number of the graph, denoted by ω(G).\nThe problem is then to determine the maximum possible value of ω(G) for a graph with n=128 vertices.\n\nThe clique number of any graph on n vertices is at most n.\nThis maximum is achieved for the complete graph K_n.\nFor n=128, the complete graph K_128 has a clique number of 128.\nIn K_128, any subset of k vertices forms an induced clique of size k.\nTherefore, K_128 has induced subgraphs that are cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\nThe number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\nThe search results in,, and discuss a related but different problem: the maximum number of different sizes of *maximal* cliques. This is denoted by g(n). Moon and Moser showed that g(n) is bounded by n - [log n]. This shows that the distinction is important. If the question intended to ask about maximal cliques, it would be a much harder problem with a different answer. However, the phrasing \"clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs\" points directly to the standard definition of a clique as an induced complete subgraph, not necessarily a maximal one. The set of sizes of induced complete subgraphs is determined by the size of the largest one.\n\nLet's confirm the interpretation.\nA clique is an induced complete subgraph.\nLet S be the set of integers k such that there exists an induced subgraph isomorphic to K_k.\nWe want to maximize |S|.\nLet ω(G) be the clique number of G, which is the size of the largest clique in G.\nIf k is in S, it means there is an induced clique of size k. Let this clique be C.\nAny subset of k-1 vertices from C will form an induced clique of size k-1.\nSo, if k is in S and k > 1, then k-1 is also in S.\nThis implies that if ω(G) = k_max, then S = {1, 2, ..., k_max}.\nTherefore, |S| = k_max = ω(G).\nThe problem is to find max_G ω(G) for a graph G on n=128 vertices.\nThe maximum value of ω(G) for a graph on n vertices is n.\nThis is achieved by the complete graph K_n.\nFor n=128, the graph K_128 has ω(K_128) = 128.\nThis graph K_128 contains induced subgraphs of all sizes k for 1 <= k <= 128.\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\nThe alternative interpretation about maximal cliques is a well-known research problem, as seen in the search results. If the question intended this, it would likely have been phrased \"maximal clique sizes\". The use of \"induced subgraphs\" that are cliques solidifies the simpler interpretation.\n\nFinal conclusion remains the same. The maximum number of different clique sizes is the maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices, which is 128.\n\nFinal check:\nGraph G has n=128 vertices.\nA clique of size k is an induced subgraph K_k.\nLet S be the set of possible values of k. We want to maximize |S|.\nLet k_max = max(S). So there is an induced K_{k_max}.\nThis induced K_{k_max} contains induced subgraphs K_j for all j in {1, ..., k_max}.\nSo {1, ..., k_max} is a subset of S.\nSince k_max is the maximum element, S = {1, ..., k_max}.\nSo |S| = k_max = ω(G).\nWe need to find the maximum possible value of ω(G) for a graph with 128 vertices.\nThe graph K_128 has n=128 vertices and its clique number is ω(K_128)=128.\nIn K_128, for any k from 1 to 128, we can select any k vertices, and they form an induced clique of size k.\nSo for G = K_128, the set of clique sizes is {1, 2, ..., 128}.\nThe number of different sizes is 128.\nNo graph on 128 vertices can have a clique number greater than 128.\nSo no graph can have more than 128 different clique sizes.\nThe maximum is 128.\nThe reasoning is sound.\n\n<<<128>>>"
