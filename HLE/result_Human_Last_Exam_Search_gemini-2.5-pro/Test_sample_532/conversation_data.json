    "### A finite group G is a filled group if all its maximal by inclusion product-free sets fill G. The finite filled nilpotent groups are precisely the following:\n\nA finite group *G* is termed a **filled group** if every maximal by inclusion product-free set *S* in *G* has the property that *G* = *S* ∪ *S*S, where *S*S = {*s*₁*s*₂ | *s*₁, *s*₂ ∈ *S*}. This property is also referred to as the set *S* filling *G*.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups has been established. A key result in this area shows that any finite filled nilpotent group must be either a *p*-group or of order divisible by at most two distinct primes. More specifically, a finite nilpotent group *G* is a filled group if and only if it is one of the following:\n\n*   **Cyclic groups of order 3 or 5:** C₃ or C₅.\n*   **A specific class of 2-groups:**\n    *   Elementary abelian 2-groups.\n    *   The dihedral group of order 8, D₈.\n    *   The direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2, D₈ × C₂.\n    *   The central product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the quaternion group of order 8, D₈ ∗ Q₈.\n    *   The direct product of the central product D₈ ∗ Q₈ and a cyclic group of order 2, (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.\n\nThis classification is a result of the work of C. S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S. B. Hart. They first established that any filled nilpotent group must be a 2-group, or the cyclic group C₃ or C₅. Their subsequent classification of filled 2-groups completed the characterization for all finite nilpotent groups.\n\nIt's noteworthy that the filled abelian groups are a subset of this classification. A finite abelian group is filled if and only if it is an elementary abelian 2-group, C₃, or C₅. Furthermore, it has been shown that the only filled groups of odd order are C₃ and C₅. The generalized quaternion groups of order 4*n* for *n* ≥ 2 are not filled.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group G is filled if and only if it is one of the following: an elementary abelian 2-group, C₃, C₅, D₈, D₈ × C₂, D₈ ∗ Q₈, or (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.>>>"
