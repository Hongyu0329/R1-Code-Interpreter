    "Six distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\nThe knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot ($0_1$), the trefoil knot ($3_1$), and the figure-eight knot ($4_1$). Integral surgery refers to performing a +1 or -1 surgery on these knots. Each resulting 3-manifold represents an element in the homology cobordism group, $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$. By analyzing these surgeries and the properties of the resulting manifolds, we can identify the distinct elements.\n\nThe six distinct elements are:\n1.  **The Identity Element ($S^3$)**: This is produced by both +1 and -1 surgery on the unknot. It is the identity element of the group.\n2.  **The Poincaré Homology Sphere ($P$)**: This manifold results from a +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot. It is a non-trivial element of order 2 in the group, meaning it is its own inverse.\n3.  **The manifold from -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil**: Let's call this element $Q$. It is a non-trivial element of infinite order.\n4.  **The inverse of $Q$ (denoted $-Q$)**: This element is generated by +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil (the mirror image of the right-handed one). It is distinct from $Q$ and has infinite order. It is also distinct from the Poincaré sphere, despite sharing the same primary invariants, because it has a different order in the group.\n5.  **The manifold from +1 surgery on the figure-eight knot**: Let's call this element $F$. Since the figure-eight knot's Arf invariant is 0, this element has a Rokhlin invariant of 0, distinguishing it from the elements derived from the trefoil. Its non-zero Casson invariant confirms it is non-trivial and of infinite order.\n6.  **The inverse of $F$ (denoted $-F$)**: This is generated by -1 surgery on the figure-eight knot. Since the figure-eight knot is amphichiral (equivalent to its mirror image), this element is the inverse of $F$ and is distinct from it.\n\nThese six manifolds are all distinct from one another within the homology cobordism group, as distinguished by their Rokhlin and Casson invariants, and their order within the group.\n\n<<<6>>>"
