    "There are no Cysteine residues located in the TM3-TM4 linker domains of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThe human GABAAρ1 receptor, also known as GABRR1, has its protein sequence and structural information available in the UniProt database under the accession number P24046. The third transmembrane domain (TM3) of this receptor spans amino acid positions 303-324, and the fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) is located at positions 452-472.\n\nThe linker region between these two domains, known as the TM3-TM4 intracellular linker, corresponds to the amino acid sequence from position 325 to 451. Analysis of this specific sequence reveals that it does not contain any Cysteine (C) residues.\n\n<<<0>>>"
