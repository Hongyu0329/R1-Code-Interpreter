    "A comprehensive study by Chimere S. Anabanti and Sarah B. Hart has completely classified the finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3. Their research demonstrates that any such group must have an order of 24 or less.\n\nThe term \"maximal by inclusion product-free set\" is often referred to as a \"locally maximal product-free set\" in the relevant literature to distinguish it from a product-free set of maximum possible size in a group. A set `S` within a group `G` is product-free if for any elements `a, b, c` in `S` (which are not necessarily distinct), the relation `ab = c` does not hold. The set `S` is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\n\nThe classification provided by Anabanti and Hart identifies all non-isomorphic finite groups featuring such sets. The complete list consists of 22 distinct groups:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** C₆, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂, C₁₄, C₁₅, C₂₀\n*   **Dihedral Groups:** S₃ (isomorphic to D₆), D₈, D₁₂, D₁₄, D₁₆\n*   **Abelian (non-cyclic):** C₂ × C₄, (C₂)² × C₄\n*   **Quaternion and Dicyclic Groups:** Q₈ (Quaternion), Q₁₂ (Dicyclic), SL(2,3) (isomorphic to the binary tetrahedral group, which is Q₂₄), and a group of order 24 described as C₃ ⋊ Q₈ (isomorphic to the dicyclic group Q₂₄). In the context of the paper, SL(2,3) and C₃ ⋊ Q₈ are listed as distinct groups that contain these sets.\n*   **Other non-Abelian Groups:** A₄ (Alternating group), QD₁₆ (Quasidihedral), A₄ × C₂\n\nCounting these distinct non-isomorphic groups reveals there are exactly 22.\n\n<<<22>>>"
