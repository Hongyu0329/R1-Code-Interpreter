    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, the prime power factors of $N$ are $2^2=4$, $3^2=9$, $7^1=7$, $11^1=11$, and $13^1=13$.\n\n### 2. Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ of conductor $N$ is called *primitive* if it is not induced by a character of a smaller conductor. A character modulo $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters modulo each prime power factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$,\nwhere each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character of conductor $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nIn our case, a primitive character $\\chi$ of conductor $36036$ must be of the form:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$,\nwhere $\\chi_m$ is a primitive character of conductor $m$.\n\n### 3. Order of a Decomposed Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe require the order of $\\chi$ to be $6$. This imposes two conditions:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_m)$, must be a divisor of $6$.\n2.  The lcm of the orders must be exactly $6$. This means that there must be at least one component whose order is a multiple of $2$, and at least one component whose order is a multiple of $3$.\n\n### 4. Counting Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor whose order divides $6$.\n\n*   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one non-trivial character of order 2, which is primitive. So, there is **1** primitive character, and its order is 2. Since $2|6$, this character is a valid component.\n\n*   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if and only if its order is divisible by 3. The possible orders of characters are the divisors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Orders 3 and 6 are divisible by 3.\n    *   The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group $C_n$ (for $d|n$) is $\\phi(d)$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both orders (3 and 6) divide 6. Thus, there are $2+2 = \\textbf{4}$ choices for $\\chi_9$.\n\n*   **Conductor 7**: The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. We need to count the primitive characters whose order divides 6.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$ character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$ characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$ characters.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n*   **Conductor 11**: The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. We need to find the number of such characters whose order divides 6. The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. The only non-trivial order that also divides 6 is 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = \\textbf{1}$.\n\n*   **Conductor 13**: The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. We need to count those whose order divides 6. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The non-trivial orders that also divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$ character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$ characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$ characters.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n### 5. Combining the Results\nTo find the total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6, we multiply the number of choices for each component character, provided the lcm of the orders is guaranteed to be 6.\n\nThe number of available component characters is:\n*   For $\\chi_4$: 1 choice (order 2).\n*   For $\\chi_9$: 4 choices (orders 3 or 6).\n*   For $\\chi_7$: 5 choices (orders 2, 3, or 6).\n*   For $\\chi_{11}$: 1 choice (order 2).\n*   For $\\chi_{13}$: 5 choices (orders 2, 3, or 6).\n\nThe total number of combinations of these component characters is $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow, we must confirm that for every such combination, the order is exactly 6.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$ be one of these 100 characters.\n*   The order of $\\chi_4$ is always 2. This ensures that the lcm of the orders is a multiple of 2.\n*   The order of $\\chi_9$ is always 3 or 6. This ensures that the lcm of the orders is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the order of $\\chi$ is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2,3) = 6$.\nBy construction, the order of each component divides 6, so their lcm must also divide 6.\nIf the order of $\\chi$ is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6, it must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, all 100 characters constructed have an order of exactly 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $36036$ and order $6$ is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
