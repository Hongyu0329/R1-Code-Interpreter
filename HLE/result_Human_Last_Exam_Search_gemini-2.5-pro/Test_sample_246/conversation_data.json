    "To determine the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, we first need to identify the fundamental group in question.\n\n### 1. The Fundamental Group of the Knot Complement\n\nLet $K$ be the trefoil knot in $S^3$. Its fundamental group, the trefoil group, has a standard presentation $G = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3 \\rangle$. A meridian for this knot corresponds to the generator $x$.\n\nThe 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, which we denote as $K_5$, is a 2-sphere embedded in the 4-sphere, $S^4$. The fundamental group of its complement, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_5)$, can be constructed from the trefoil group $G$. According to the theory developed by Zeeman and others, this group is given by adding a new generator, say $h$, which represents the \"time\" loop in the spinning construction, and relating it to the original generators by an automorphism that represents the twisting.\n\nFor an $m$-twist spin, the relation is $h g h^{-1} = \\mu^{-m} g \\mu^m$ for all $g \\in G$, where $\\mu$ is a meridian. For our case, $m=5$ and $\\mu=x$. Thus, the fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil is:\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_5) = \\langle x, y, h \\mid x^2=y^3, hxh^{-1} = x^{-5}xx^5, hyh^{-1}=x^{-5}yx^5 \\rangle$.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_5) = \\langle x, y, h \\mid x^2=y^3, hx=xh, hyh^{-1}=x^{-5}yx^5 \\rangle$.\n\n### 2. The Fundamental Group of the Double Branched Cover\n\nThe fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over a 2-knot is obtained by taking the fundamental group of the knot complement and adding the relation that the square of a meridian is the identity element. In our case, the meridian is $x$, so we add the relation $x^2=1$.\n\nLet $\\pi$ be the fundamental group of the double branched cover.\n$\\pi = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K_5) / \\langle\\langle x^2=1 \\rangle\\rangle$.\n\nThe presentation for $\\pi$ becomes:\n$\\pi = \\langle x, y, h \\mid x^2=y^3, hx=xh, hyh^{-1}=x^{-5}yx^5, x^2=1 \\rangle$.\n\nWe can simplify this presentation using the new relation $x^2=1$:\n1.  From $x^2=y^3$ and $x^2=1$, we get $y^3=1$.\n2.  The relation $x^2=1$ implies $x^{-1}=x$. Therefore, $x^5 = (x^2)^2 x = x$, and $x^{-5} = x$.\n3.  The relation $hyh^{-1}=x^{-5}yx^5$ becomes $hyh^{-1}=xyx$.\n\nSo, the fundamental group is:\n$\\pi = \\langle x, y, h \\mid x^2=1, y^3=1, hx=xh, hyh^{-1}=xyx \\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Minimal Number of Generators\n\nThe minimal number of generators of a group $G$, denoted $d(G)$, is greater than or equal to the minimal number of generators of its abelianization, $G_{ab} = G/[G,G]$.\n\nLet's compute the abelianization of $\\pi$. We treat the generators as elements of a free abelian group and the relations become linear equations:\n*   $x^2=1 \\implies 2x=0$.\n*   $y^3=1 \\implies 3y=0$.\n*   $hx=xh \\implies h+x = x+h$, which is always true in an abelian group.\n*   $hyh^{-1}=xyx \\implies h+y-h = x+y+x \\implies y = 2x+y \\implies 2x=0$.\n\nThe relations on the abelian group generated by $x, y, h$ are $2x=0$ and $3y=0$. There are no relations involving $h$. Therefore, the abelianization is:\n$\\pi_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe minimal number of generators for this abelian group is 3 (one for each direct summand). Thus, we have the lower bound:\n$d(\\pi) \\ge d(\\pi_{ab}) = 3$.\n\nThe group $\\pi$ has a presentation with three generators: $x, y, h$. This means the group can be generated by at most three elements:\n$d(\\pi) \\le 3$.\n\nCombining these two inequalities, we find that the minimal number of generators is exactly 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
