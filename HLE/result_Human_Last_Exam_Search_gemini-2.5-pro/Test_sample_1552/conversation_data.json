    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is denoted as `a_2`. The spectral action is given by the trace of a function of the Laplacian of the Dirac operator, `S = Tr(f(D^2/\\Lambda^2))`. The asymptotic expansion of this action in terms of the cutoff scale `\\Lambda` is given by the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients.\n\nThe Dirac operator `D` for a massless spinor field coupled to a gauge field `A_\\mu` on a curved 4-dimensional manifold is given by:\n`D = \\gamma^\\mu(\\partial_\\mu + \\omega_\\mu + iA_\\mu)`\nwhere `\\gamma^\\mu` are the gamma matrices, `\\partial_\\mu` is the partial derivative, `\\omega_\\mu` is the spin connection, and `A_\\mu` is the gauge field potential.\n\nThe heat kernel expansion is an expansion of the trace of the heat operator `Tr(e^{-t D^2})` for small `t`:\n`Tr(e^{-t D^2}) \\sim \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} t^{n-2} \\int d^4x \\sqrt{g} a_{2n}(x)`\n\nThe second coefficient in this expansion is `a_2`. To find its value, one can use the general formula for the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients for a second-order differential operator of the Laplace type, `P = -(\\nabla^2 + E)`. The square of the gauged Dirac operator, `D^2`, is such an operator.\n\nThe general expression for the trace of the second coefficient, `tr(a_2)`, which is a matrix in the spinor space, is given by:\n`tr(a_2) = \\frac{1}{6} tr(R \\cdot I + 6E)`\nwhere `R` is the scalar curvature, `I` is the identity matrix in the spinor space, and `E` is the endomorphism part of the operator `D^2`.\n\nFor the squared gauged Dirac operator, the endomorphism `E` is given by:\n`E = -\\frac{R}{4}I - \\frac{ig}{2}F_{\\mu\\nu}\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu`\nwhere `g` is the gauge coupling constant and `F_{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial_\\mu A_\\nu - \\partial_\\nu A_\\mu` is the field strength tensor of the gauge field.\n\nSubstituting this expression for `E` into the formula for `tr(a_2)`:\n`tr(a_2) = \\frac{1}{6} tr(R \\cdot I + 6(-\\frac{R}{4}I - \\frac{ig}{2}F_{\\mu\\nu}\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu))`\n`tr(a_2) = \\frac{1}{6} tr(R \\cdot I - \\frac{3}{2}R \\cdot I - 3igF_{\\mu\\nu}\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu)`\n`tr(a_2) = \\frac{1}{6} tr(-\\frac{1}{2}R \\cdot I - 3igF_{\\mu\\nu}\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu)`\n\nThe trace is taken over the spinor indices. In 4 dimensions, the dimension of the spinor space is 4, so `tr(I) = 4`. The trace of the product of the field strength tensor and the gamma matrices is:\n`tr(F_{\\mu\\nu}\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu) = F_{\\mu\\nu}tr(\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu) = F_{\\mu\\nu}(4g^{\\mu\\nu}) = 4F_{\\mu\\nu}g^{\\mu\\nu}`\nSince `F_{\\mu\\nu}` is antisymmetric and `g^{\\mu\\nu}` is symmetric, their contraction `F_{\\mu\\nu}g^{\\mu\\nu}` is zero. Therefore, the term involving the gauge field vanishes from the trace.\n\nThis leaves:\n`tr(a_2) = \\frac{1}{6} tr(-\\frac{1}{2}R \\cdot I) = \\frac{1}{6} (-\\frac{R}{2} \\cdot 4) = -\\frac{R}{3}`\n\nThus, the second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion, when traced over the spinor indices, is proportional to the scalar curvature and does not depend on the gauge field.\n\n<<<$-R/3$>>>"
