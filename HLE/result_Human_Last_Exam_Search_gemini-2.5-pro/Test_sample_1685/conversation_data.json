    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for large values of $x$, we first analyze the behavior of each term in the equation as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe ODE is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nFor large $x$, we make the following observations:\n1.  The term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ becomes negligible, provided that $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$. We will assume this is the case and verify it later.\n2.  The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ is a rapidly oscillating forcing term. It does not decay as $x \\to \\infty$. Such terms often mean that the solution $y(x)$ will have an oscillatory component. However, finding a full analytical solution under these conditions is generally intractable. A common approach in such cases is to analyze the behavior of the system by either averaging the oscillatory term or, in some contexts, neglecting it to find the leading-order behavior of the solution.\n\nLet's try to find the leading-order asymptotic solution by neglecting the oscillatory term. This is based on the assumption that the dominant behavior of the solution is determined by the other terms, especially if the solution itself decays. The simplified ODE for large $x$ is:\n$y''' \\approx y^{4} + y'^{4}$\n\nWe look for a solution of the form $y(x) = ax^b$, which is a common ansatz for asymptotic analysis.\nThe derivatives are:\n$y'(x) = abx^{b-1}$\n$y''(x) = ab(b-1)x^{b-2}$\n$y'''(x) = ab(b-1)(b-2)x^{b-3}$\n\nSubstituting these into the simplified ODE gives:\n$ab(b-1)(b-2)x^{b-3} \\approx (ax^b)^4 + (abx^{b-1})^4 = a^4x^{4b} + a^4b^4x^{4b-4}$\n\nTo find the dominant balance for large $x$, we must equate the exponents of the most significant terms. Let's compare the powers on the right-hand side, $4b$ and $4b-4$.\n*   If $b > 0$, the term $a^4x^{4b}$ dominates.\n*   If $b < 0$, the term $a^4x^{4b}$ also dominates since $4b > 4b-4$.\n\nSo, the dominant balance is between $y'''$ and $y^4$.\n$y''' \\approx y^4$\nEquating the powers of $x$:\n$b-3 = 4b \\implies 3b = -3 \\implies b = -1$\n\nThis indicates a decaying solution, which is consistent with the assumption that the term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2} \\to 0$. With $b=-1$, we have $y \\sim x^{-1}$, $y' \\sim x^{-2}$, $y'' \\sim x^{-3}$, so $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2} \\sim \\frac{x^{-3}}{x^2} = x^{-5}$, which is indeed negligible compared to the balanced terms which will be of order $x^{-4}$.\n\nNow we equate the coefficients:\n$a(b)(b-1)(b-2) = a^4$\nSubstitute $b=-1$:\n$a(-1)(-1-1)(-1-2) = a^4$\n$a(-1)(-2)(-3) = a^4$\n$-6a = a^4$\n\nThis equation has solutions $a=0$ (the trivial solution) or $a^3 = -6$. Since we are looking for a non-trivial solution, we take $a^3 = -6$.\n$a = \\sqrt{-6} \\approx -1.81712$\n\nSo, the approximate solution is $y(x) \\approx \\sqrt{-6} x^{-1}$.\n\nLet's check the consistency of neglecting the $y'^4$ term in our balance $y''' \\approx y^4$.\n$y''' \\sim x^{b-3} = x^{-4}$\n$y^4 \\sim x^{4b} = x^{-4}$\n$y'^4 \\sim x^{4b-4} = x^{-8}$\nFor large $x$, the $x^{-8}$ term is indeed much smaller than the $x^{-4}$ terms, so the approximation is consistent.\n\nThe presence of the non-decaying oscillatory term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ in the original equation means that the true solution will likely have persistent oscillations. However, the expression $y(x) \\approx \\sqrt{-6} x^{-1}$ represents the leading-order behavior of the decaying component of the solution. Without further information or context suggesting a different interpretation, this is the most plausible analytical approximation for the underlying behavior in the large $x$ regime.\n\nRounding the coefficient to two decimal places, we get $a \\approx -1.82$.\n\nThus, the analytical expression that approximates the solution is:\n$y(x) \\approx -1.82 x^{-1}$\n\n<<<y(x) = -1.82 / x>>>"
