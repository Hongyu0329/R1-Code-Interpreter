    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing THF, followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the formation of 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the chemical transformation:\n\n*   **Reactants**: The starting material is 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene, and the reagent is an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide (PhMgBr), a Grignard reagent.\n*   **Reactivity of Halogens**: In cross-coupling reactions with Grignard reagents, the reactivity of aryl halides follows the order I > Br > Cl. This is because the carbon-iodine bond is the weakest and therefore the most susceptible to reaction.\n*   **Step-wise Substitution**:\n    1.  The Grignard reagent will first react at the most reactive site, which is the carbon atom bonded to the iodine. This replaces the iodine at position 2 with a phenyl group.\n    2.  Since an excess of the Grignard reagent is used and the reaction is heated (refluxed), the conditions are harsh enough to also substitute the two less reactive bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 with phenyl groups. While reactions with aryl bromides are slower, the excess reagent and heat drive the reaction to completion.\n*   **Aqueous Work-up**: The final step involves an aqueous work-up, which quenches any unreacted Grignard reagent and ensures the final product is the neutral aromatic compound.\n*   **Final Product**: The sequential substitution of all three halogen atoms (one iodine and two bromines) with phenyl groups on the benzene ring yields a molecule with a central benzene ring attached to three phenyl groups at the 1, 2, and 3 positions.\n*   **IUPAC Nomenclature**: According to IUPAC rules for naming polysubstituted benzene rings, the substituents are identified and their positions are numbered to give the lowest possible locants. In this case, the parent compound is benzene, and it has three phenyl substituents. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name for the product is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
