    "After a gene duplication event, there are several possible fates for the new gene copy. Understanding these fates is key to identifying the mechanism most likely responsible for both the retention and divergence of these duplicate genes.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the potential outcomes for a duplicated gene:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, causing the sequences of the two genes to become more similar. This process, known as homogenization, counteracts divergence and therefore does not explain the divergence of duplicate genes. In some cases, it can create new gene variants, but its primary role in duplicated genes is homogenization.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene. One copy of the gene accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional, turning into a pseudogene. Since this process involves the loss of a functional gene, it does not represent a mechanism for the *retention* of a functional duplicate pair.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this process, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations and acquires a completely new, beneficial function. This mechanism explains both the retention of the two genes (as they serve different purposes) and their divergence, as the new function requires changes in the gene sequence. Studies in Drosophila have shown neofunctionalization to be a primary process for maintaining young duplicate genes.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This mechanism involves the division of the original ancestral functions between the two duplicate copies. Each gene copy loses some of its original functions through mutation, such that both genes are now required to perform all the functions of the single ancestral gene. This partitioning of roles ensures that both copies are retained and also allows them to diverge as they specialize. Some models suggest that subfunctionalization can be a transitional state that allows for the long-term preservation of a duplicate, which may later lead to neofunctionalization.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This term describes the rapid diversification of a group of organisms into various forms that fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism for the retention and divergence of individual genes.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are widely accepted mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. They both provide a selective advantage for keeping both copies. Subfunctionalization involves the partitioning of ancestral functions, while neofunctionalization involves the evolution of a novel function. Both are considered key drivers of functional innovation in genomes.\n\nGiven the options, both C and D are strong candidates. However, the question asks for the mechanism *most likely* responsible. Both are significant processes. Subfunctionalization is often considered a pervasive, neutral process that can preserve duplicates, creating an opportunity for one copy to later evolve a new function (neofunctionalization). Neofunctionalization represents the adaptive process of gaining a novel function. Both are crucial for retaining and diverging duplicate genes. Without further context to distinguish between them, both are considered major, likely mechanisms. However, many discussions frame subfunctionalization as a key step that facilitates long-term retention, which can then lead to neofunctionalization.\n\nBoth C and D are valid and important mechanisms. In many theoretical models and empirical observations, subfunctionalization is seen as a common pathway for preserving duplicates, which can then set the stage for neofunctionalization. This makes both crucial. Often, subfunctionalization is seen as a more common initial fate that ensures retention.\n\nConsidering the choices, neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are the core mechanisms. Let's re-evaluate. The question is about retention AND divergence.\n- Subfunctionalization: Retains both copies by making them both necessary. They diverge as they specialize in their partitioned roles.\n- Neofunctionalization: Retains both copies because one has the old essential function and the other has a new beneficial one. They diverge as one copy evolves the new function.\n\nBoth fit perfectly. However, the models often propose that the initial redundancy after duplication allows for the accumulation of degenerative mutations that lead to subfunctionalization, a process that doesn't require positive selection. This may be a more common initial path to retention than the rarer event of a mutation creating a brand-new, advantageous function (neofunctionalization).\n\n<<<D>>>"
