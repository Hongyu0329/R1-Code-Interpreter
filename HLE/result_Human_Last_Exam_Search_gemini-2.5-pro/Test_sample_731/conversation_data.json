    "The performed search results did not directly answer the question about the number of power subgroups in a semidihedral group. However, they provided general information about semidihedral groups, their structure, and related concepts like power graphs, which are built upon the idea of one element being a power of another. The initial reasoning, based on the definition of power subgroups and the structure of the semidihedral group, seems to be the most direct path to the solution. The crucial steps were identifying the exponent of the group and then analyzing the structure of G^k for divisors k of the exponent. The calculations for G^(2^j) appear correct and lead to a clear chain of subgroups. I am confident in the result derived from this reasoning.\n\nThe semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_512, has the following presentation:\nG = <a, x | a^256 = x^2 = 1, xax = a^(127)>\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be expressed as H = G^k = {g^k | g ∈ G} for some integer k. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of this form.\n\nThe set of power subgroups of a finite group G is determined by the divisors of its exponent. The exponent of SD_512 is 256. Any power subgroup G^k is equal to G^d, where d = gcd(k, 256). Therefore, we only need to consider the power subgroups for k that are divisors of 256. The divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of these power subgroups:\n\n*   **G^1**: This is the group G itself, SD_512, with an order of 512.\n*   **G^2**: The elements of G are of the form a^i or a^i*x. Their squares are (a^i)^2 = a^(2i) and (a^i*x)^2 = a^(128i). Both of these sets of elements are contained within the cyclic subgroup <a^2>. Thus, G^2 = <a^2>, which is a cyclic group of order 128.\n*   **G^4**: The fourth powers of elements are (a^i)^4 = a^(4i) and (a^i*x)^4 = ((a^i*x)^2)^2 = (a^(128i))^2 = a^(256i) = 1. Therefore, G^4 is generated by a^4, so G^4 = <a^4>, a cyclic group of order 64.\n*   **G^(2^j) for j ≥ 2**: For any j from 2 to 8, the subgroup G^(2^j) will be equal to <a^(2^j)>. The order of this subgroup is 256 / (2^j) = 2^(8-j).\n\nThis gives us the following distinct power subgroups:\n\n1.  G^1 = SD_512 (Order 512)\n2.  G^2 = <a^2> (Order 128)\n3.  G^4 = <a^4> (Order 64)\n4.  G^8 = <a^8> (Order 32)\n5.  G^16 = <a^16> (Order 16)\n6.  G^32 = <a^32> (Order 8)\n7.  G^64 = <a^64> (Order 4)\n8.  G^128 = <a^128> (Order 2)\n9.  G^256 = <a^256> = {1} (The trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\nThese nine subgroups are all distinct as their orders are different.\n\n<<<9>>>"
