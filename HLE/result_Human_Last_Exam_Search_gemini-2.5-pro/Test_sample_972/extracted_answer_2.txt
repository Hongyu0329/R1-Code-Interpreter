The amplitude of the electric field at the rightmost boundary is given by the function $A_{out}(L) = A e^{-\frac{\alpha L}{2c}}$, where $A$ is the amplitude of the incident wave, $\alpha$ is the rate of change parameter of the medium, $L$ is the length of the slab, and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.
