    "**No character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that alludes to Romulus and Remus.**\n\nA thorough review of the novel's plot summaries, character analyses, and the full text of the work reveals no such scene or character. The narrative of *The House of the Wolfings* focuses on the Germanic Gothic tribe, the Wolfings, and their conflict with the invading Roman legions. The story is set in the forests of Mirkwood, the homeland of the Wolfings, and details their societal structure, customs, and their heroic defense against the Romans.\n\nThe central conflict of the novel is the military clash between the Goths and the Romans. The Romans are depicted as the antagonists, a \"rapacious city-dwelling\" people, but there are no passages where a character from the House of the Wolfings travels to a Roman city and observes their religious life. The religious practices detailed in the book are those of the Wolfings, who worship their own gods, such as Odin and Tyr.\n\nThe premise of the question, that a character within the novel describes a Roman religious practice recognizable as the story of Romulus and Remus, is not supported by the text of *The House of the Wolfings*.\n\n<<<No such character or event occurs in the novel.>>>"
