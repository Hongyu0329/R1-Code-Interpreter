    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its columns or rows. For a flag, the \"matrix\" is a grid of colors. To maximize the rank, we can represent each of the *C* distinct colors in the flag as a linearly independent vector in a C-dimensional space. Under this assumption, the maximal rank of a flag is equal to the number of distinct colors it contains.\n\nThe flag of Denmark, known as the Dannebrog, consists of a red field with a white Scandinavian cross. This means the flag has two colors: red and white. Therefore, its maximal linear algebraic rank is 2.\n\nThe task is to find which African nations have flags with exactly two colors, as they will have a maximal rank of 2. An analysis of the flags of the 54 sovereign states in Africa reveals the following nations have flags composed of precisely two colors:\n\n*   **Botswana:** The flag features a light blue field divided by a central black horizontal stripe, which has a white border. The colors are light blue, black, and white, making a total of three colors. Therefore, it does not have a rank of 2.\n*   **Burundi:** The flag has a white saltire (diagonal cross) that divides the field into four areas. The upper and lower areas are red, and the left and right areas are green. In the center, there is a white circle with three red six-pointed stars outlined in green. This flag contains three colors: white, red, and green.\n*   **Libya:** The current flag of Libya, readopted in 2011, consists of a horizontal triband of red, black, and green, with a white star and crescent in the center. This makes for a total of four colors. The previous flag, from 1977 to 2011, was plain green, giving it a rank of 1.\n*   **Nigeria:** The Nigerian flag is a vertical triband of green, white, and green. The two colors are green and white, so its rank is 2.\n*   **Somalia:** The flag of Somalia is light blue with a single white five-pointed star in the center. The two colors are light blue and white, resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   **Tunisia:** The flag of Tunisia is red with a central white disk containing a red star and crescent. The two colors are red and white, giving it a rank of 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, the African nations whose flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark are Nigeria, Somalia, and Tunisia.\n\n<<<Nigeria, Somalia, and Tunisia>>>"
