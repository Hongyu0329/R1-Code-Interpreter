    "The first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nHere is a summary of the derivation:\n1.  **The Moduli Space:** The space $X$ in question is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area. A lattice is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. The \"unit area\" condition means the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice has an area of 1. \"Nondegenerate\" implies the lattice spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is inherent to the definition. The term \"moduli space\" implies that we identify lattices that are related by isometries (rotations and reflections) of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n2.  **Mathematical Formulation:** This moduli space $X$ can be identified with the quotient space $O(2) \\backslash SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This double coset space can be shown to be equivalent to the quotient of the space of positive definite symmetric $2 \\times 2$ matrices with determinant 1, denoted $\\mathcal{P}$, by an action of the general linear group over the integers, $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Connection to the Upper Half-Plane:** The space $\\mathcal{P}$ is isometric to the hyperbolic upper half-plane, $\\mathbb{H}$. The action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $\\mathcal{P}$ translates to an action of a group of isometries on $\\mathbb{H}$. This group, sometimes denoted $PGL^*(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, is generated by the modular group $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ acting via fractional linear transformations, and the reflection $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$.\n\n4.  **Topological Structure:** The moduli space $X$ is thus the quotient orbifold $X = \\mathbb{H} / PGL^*(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$ is simply connected, the (orbifold) fundamental group of $X$ is isomorphic to the group of isometries, $\\pi_1^{\\text{orb}}(X) \\cong PGL^*(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n5.  **Homology Calculation:** According to the Hurewicz theorem, the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group. We need to compute the abelianization of $G^* = PGL^*(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   The group $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ has a presentation $\\langle S, T \\mid S^2 = (ST)^3 = 1 \\rangle$.\n    *   The full group $G^*$ is generated by $S$, $T$, and the reflection $\\tau(z)=-\\bar{z}$, with additional relations $\\tau^2=1$, $\\tau S \\tau^{-1} = S$, and $\\tau T \\tau^{-1} = T^{-1}$.\n    *   To find the abelianization, we add relations making the generators commute. The relation $\\tau T = T^{-1} \\tau$ implies $T^2=1$ in the abelian group. The relation $(ST)^3=1$ combined with $S^2=1$ and $T^2=1$ leads to $ST=1$, which means $S=T$.\n    *   The resulting abelian group is generated by the images of $S$ and $\\tau$, with the relations $S^2=1$ and $\\tau^2=1$.\n\n6.  **Final Result:** The abelianization is therefore isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2. This result is confirmed by mathematical literature, for instance, in papers studying the topology of the moduli space of real elliptic curves.\n\nThus, the first homology group is $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n<<<$\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$>>>"
