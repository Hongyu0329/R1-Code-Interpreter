    "Based on Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, the ratio of the \\(\\textit{cis}\\)-isomer \\(A\\) to the \\(\\textit{trans}\\)-isomer \\(B\\) is predicted to be greater than 1, meaning the \\(\\textit{cis}\\)-isomer \\(A\\) is the major product. Here is a detailed explanation of the prediction.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Reaction and Governing Rule\nThe reaction is the ring-closure of a conjugated polyene, (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, under thermal conditions. This is an electrocyclic reaction. The π-system involved has 8 electrons (from four double bonds).\n\nAccording to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which are derived from FMO theory, the stereochemical outcome of an electrocyclic reaction depends on the number of π-electrons and the reaction conditions (thermal or photochemical).\n*   The system has 8 π-electrons, which is a **4n** system (where n=2).\n*   The reaction occurs under **thermal** conditions.\n\nFor a 4n π-electron system undergoing a thermal electrocyclization, FMO theory dictates that the reaction must proceed through a **conrotatory** motion. This is because the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the ground state (ψ₄ for an octatetraene) has terminal p-orbitals with lobes of opposite phase on the same side of the molecule. A conrotatory twist is required to bring lobes of the same phase together to form the new σ-bond.\n\n### 2. Predicting the Product from the Starting Isomer\nTo predict the stereochemistry of the product, we must analyze the spatial arrangement of the substituents on the terminal carbons of the conjugated system (C2 and C9) in the reactive \"U-shaped\" conformation.\n*   **Starting Material:** (2Z,4Z,6Z,8**E**)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n*   **Substituents:** A methyl group (Me) and a hydrogen atom (H) on C2, and a Me and H on C9.\n\nA systematic analysis of the geometry shows that in the reactive conformation, the substituents are arranged as follows:\n*   At C2: The methyl group is pointing **out** of the curve of the \"U\", and the hydrogen is pointing **in**.\n*   At C9: Due to the E-geometry of the C8=C9 double bond, the methyl group is also pointing **out**, and the hydrogen is **in**.\n\nWhen the required **conrotatory** ring closure occurs, the two \"out\" groups (both methyl groups) rotate to the same face of the newly forming ring. Likewise, the two \"in\" groups (both hydrogens) rotate to the same face. This stereospecific process leads exclusively to the formation of **\\(\\textit{cis}\\)-7,8-dimethyl-1,3,5-cyclooctatriene (Isomer A)**. The transition state for this pathway, **TS-A**, involves a steric interaction between the two inward-rotating hydrogen atoms.\n\n### 3. Explaining the Formation of the \\(\\textit{trans}\\)-Isomer B\nThe question states that a \\(\\textit{trans}\\)-isomer (B) is also formed. Based on the stereospecificity of the conrotatory closure, this isomer cannot form directly from the (...,8E)-tetraene. It must arise from the cyclization of a different stereoisomer of the starting material. This implies that under the thermal conditions, the starting (...,8E)-tetraene can first isomerize to the (2Z,4Z,6Z,8**Z**)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n\n*   **Intermediate Isomer:** (2Z,4Z,6Z,8**Z**)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n*   **Substituent Arrangement:** In this \"all-Z\" isomer, the substituents are arranged with Me(out)/H(in) at C2, but **Me(in)/H(out)** at C9.\n*   **Conrotatory Closure:** Applying the conrotatory motion to this isomer causes the \"out\" group at C2 (Me) and the \"out\" group at C9 (H) to rotate to the same face, while the \"in\" group at C2 (H) and the \"in\" group at C9 (Me) rotate to the other face. This results in the methyl groups being on opposite faces of the ring, yielding **\\(\\textit{trans}\\)-7,8-dimethyl-1,3,5-cyclooctatriene (Isomer B)**.\n\nThe transition state for this second pathway, **TS-B**, involves a steric interaction between an inward-rotating hydrogen atom (from C2) and an inward-rotating methyl group (from C9).\n\n### 4. Predicting the Ratio by Comparing Transition State Energies\nThe ratio of products A and B is determined by the relative rates of the two competing pathways, which in turn depends on the activation energies of their respective rate-determining steps. We compare the energies of the two cyclization transition states:\n*   **TS-A (leading to \\(\\textit{cis}\\)-isomer A):** Involves a relatively small **H-H** steric clash.\n*   **TS-B (leading to \\(\\textit{trans}\\)-isomer B):** Involves a much more significant **H-Me** steric clash.\n\nSince a methyl group is substantially larger than a hydrogen atom, the steric hindrance in TS-B is much greater than in TS-A. Consequently, the activation energy for the formation of the \\(\\textit{trans}\\)-isomer B is significantly higher than that for the \\(\\textit{cis}\\)-isomer A.\n\nBecause the reaction pathway leading to the \\(\\textit{cis}\\)-isomer A has a lower energy barrier, it will be kinetically favored and proceed at a faster rate. Therefore, isomer A will be the major product, and isomer B will be the minor product.\n\n<<<The ratio of A:B is greater than 1.>>>"
