    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are primarily predators. Their diet consists mainly of small, soft-bodied insects like aphids.\n\nIn addition to preying on other insects, some adult snakeflies have also been recorded feeding on pollen and nectar. Gut analysis of some specimens has revealed the presence of pollen, although it is not definitively known if this is a required food source or simply a favored one. Some non-predatory species are known to feed on nectar, pollen, or honeydew. They have also been observed feeding on other sugary substances.\n\nBased on the provided options:\n*   **A. Nectar:** This has been recorded as part of the diet for some species.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While they do eat pollen, there is no specific record of them eating pollen from this New Zealand native plant.\n*   **C. Fungus:** This is not a recorded food source.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Snakeflies are not recorded as feeding on leaf tissue.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Aphids are a primary food source for adult snakeflies.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is the one that includes both their predatory and supplemental feeding habits.\n\n<<<F>>>"
