The approach is not ecologically valid. The ecological function of *Bombus* mimicry is to signal unpalatability to predators, primarily birds and other insects. These predators have fundamentally different visual systems than humans. Most birds are tetrachromatic, meaning they see four primary colors including ultraviolet (UV) light, which is invisible to the trichromatic (red, green, blue) vision of humans. Many predatory insects are also sensitive to UV light. Therefore, color patterns that appear identical to a human may be distinct to a bird or insect predator, and vice-versa. Using human visual estimation ignores the UV spectrum and other differences in color perception, which are crucial for how the mimicry signal actually functions in nature. This methodological flaw means the resulting clusters may not accurately represent the functional mimicry syndromes from an evolutionary and ecological perspective.
