    "### The Number of Composants in the Stone-Čech Remainder\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Čech remainder of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ with one point $x$ removed, denoted as $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. This remainder is a compact, connected Hausdorff space, and thus a continuum.\n\nThe structure and properties of such remainders are highly dependent on set-theoretic axioms beyond the standard Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC). Specifically, the number of composants can vary based on whether one assumes axioms like the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) or other principles.\n\nLet $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. The Stone-Čech remainder is $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$. For $Y$ to be connected, which it is, its Stone-Čech remainder $Y^*$ is also connected. It is known that for many spaces, this remainder is an indecomposable continuum. For instance, the remainder of the half-line $[0, \\infty)$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n\nThe number of composants of an indecomposable continuum is a central topic in continuum theory. A metrizable indecomposable continuum has uncountably many ($\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum) composants. However, for non-metrizable continua like Stone-Čech remainders, the situation is more complex.\n\nResearch in topology has shown that the number of composants can be as low as one. For example, it is consistent with ZFC that the Stone-Čech remainder of the half-line, $\\beta[0, \\infty) \\setminus [0, \\infty)$, has only one composant. This consistency is related to a set-theoretic principle called the Near Coherence of Filters (NCF), which is independent of ZFC.\n\nConversely, under the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), it is known that certain Stone-Čech remainders have many composants. While the direct result for a general hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$ is not readily found, analysis of similar spaces provides strong indicators. For example, under CH, certain standard subcontinua of the remainder of the half-line are all homeomorphic, which suggests a rich and complex structure. In many contexts where indecomposable continua arise, the number of composants is often the maximum possible, which is $2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$.\n\nGiven the nature of Stone-Čech remainders and the influence of set-theoretic assumptions, the maximum possible number of composants is likely to be the largest cardinality it can be, which for continua is typically $2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$. The precise number of composants often depends on the specific model of set theory. Without a specific set-theoretic assumption, the question of the \"maximum possible\" number implies exploring what different axioms might allow. Under some axioms, this number can be very large.\n\nWhile a definitive single number applicable under ZFC alone cannot be provided due to the independence results, the maximum possible number of a composants is generally considered to be $2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$.\n\n<<<2^c>>>### The Number of Composants in the Stone-Čech Remainder\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Čech remainder of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ with one point $x$ removed, denoted as $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.
