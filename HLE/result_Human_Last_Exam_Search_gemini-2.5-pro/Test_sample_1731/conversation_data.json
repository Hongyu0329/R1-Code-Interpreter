    "Using the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems, we can determine the equilibrium properties of a gas of light quanta (photons), which are bosons. The equilibrium state of a statistical mechanical system is the most probable macroscopic state, which corresponds to the configuration that maximizes entropy under given constraints.\n\n### 1. Framework of Large Deviation Theory in Statistical Mechanics\n\nIn statistical mechanics, we consider a system of many particles distributed over various energy levels. The macroscopic state of the system is defined by the number of particles at each energy level, while a microscopic state is the specific configuration of which particle is in which state.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem provides a way to calculate the probability of observing a particular empirical distribution of particles over energy levels. For a large number of particles *N*, the probability of observing an empirical distribution {*n<sub>i</sub>*} (where *n<sub>i</sub>* is the fraction of particles in the *i*-th energy state) that is different from the true underlying distribution {*p<sub>i</sub>*} is exponentially small. The rate of this exponential decay is given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence). In the context of statistical mechanics, the entropy of a macrostate is proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates corresponding to it. Sanov's theorem provides a rigorous foundation for Boltzmann's formula for entropy.\n\n*   **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem deals with the probability of large deviations of the average of a set of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables from its expected value. When applied to the energy of a system, it helps in understanding the fluctuations of the total energy and its concentration around the mean energy in the thermodynamic limit. The equilibrium state is the one that minimizes the large deviation rate function, which is equivalent to maximizing the entropy.\n\n### 2. Application to a Photon Gas (Bose Case)\n\nFor a gas of photons, we need to consider two key properties:\n1.  **Indistinguishability**: Photons are identical and cannot be distinguished from one another.\n2.  **Bosons**: Any number of photons can occupy the same quantum state.\n3.  **Non-conserved Particle Number**: The number of photons in a cavity is not fixed; they can be created and absorbed by the walls. This implies that the chemical potential (μ) for a photon gas is zero.\n\nLet's consider a system of photons with discrete energy levels ε<sub>i</sub>, each with a degeneracy *g<sub>i</sub>* (number of states with the same energy). We want to find the equilibrium distribution of the number of photons, *N<sub>i</sub>*, in the energy level ε<sub>i</sub>.\n\nThe number of ways to distribute *N<sub>i</sub>* indistinguishable photons among the *g<sub>i</sub>* states at energy level ε<sub>i</sub> is given by the combination with repetition formula:\nW<sub>i</sub> = (N<sub>i</sub> + g<sub>i</sub> - 1)! / (N<sub>i</sub>! * (g<sub>i</sub> - 1)!)\n\nThe total number of microstates for a given distribution {*N<sub>i</sub>*} over all energy levels is the product of these individual terms:\nW = Π<sub>i</sub> W<sub>i</sub>\n\nThe entropy of the system is given by Boltzmann's formula, S = k ln(W), where k is the Boltzmann constant. Using Stirling's approximation (ln(n!) ≈ n ln(n) - n) for large *N<sub>i</sub>* and *g<sub>i</sub>*, the entropy for the Bose case becomes:\nS = k * Σ<sub>i</sub> [ (N<sub>i</sub> + g<sub>i</sub>) ln(N<sub>i</sub> + g<sub>i</sub>) - N<sub>i</sub> ln(N<sub>i</sub>) - g<sub>i</sub> ln(g<sub>i</sub>) ]\n\n### 3. Maximizing Entropy to Find Equilibrium\n\nTo find the equilibrium distribution, we need to maximize this entropy under the constraint of a fixed total energy, U = Σ<sub>i</sub> N<sub>i</sub>ε<sub>i</sub>. Since the photon number is not conserved, there is no constraint on the total number of photons (or equivalently, the chemical potential is zero).\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize S subject to the energy constraint. The function to maximize is:\nL = S/k - β(Σ<sub>i</sub> N<sub>i</sub>ε<sub>i</sub> - U)\nwhere β is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint (and is related to temperature by β = 1/(kT)).\n\nSetting the derivative of L with respect to *N<sub>i</sub>* to zero (∂L/∂N<sub>i</sub> = 0) yields the most probable distribution, which is the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons:\n⟨N<sub>i</sub>⟩ = g<sub>i</sub> / (e<sup>βε<sub>i</sub></sup> - 1)\n\nThis gives the average number of photons in the energy level ε<sub>i</sub> at equilibrium.\n\n### 4. Equilibrium Values of Mean Energy and Entropy\n\nWith the equilibrium distribution, we can now find the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy.\n\n**Mean Energy (U)**:\nThe mean energy of the photon gas is obtained by summing the energies of all photons, using the derived Bose-Einstein distribution. For a continuous spectrum of energies in a cavity of volume V, the density of states *g(ε)dε* is given by (Vε<sup>2</sup>)/(π<sup>2</sup>ħ<sup>3</sup>c<sup>3</sup>). The mean energy is then:\nU = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>∞</sup> ε * ⟨N(ε)⟩ * g(ε) dε = (V / (π<sup>2</sup>ħ<sup>3</sup>c<sup>3</sup>)) * ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>∞</sup> ε<sup>3</sup> / (e<sup>βε</sup> - 1) dε\n\nThis integral evaluates to:\nU = (π<sup>2</sup>k<sup>4</sup> / (15ħ<sup>3</sup>c<sup>3</sup>)) * V * T<sup>4</sup>\nThis is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation, where the energy is proportional to T<sup>4</sup>.\n\n**Entropy (S)**:\nThe entropy at equilibrium can be calculated by substituting the Bose-Einstein distribution back into the entropy formula. The result is:\nS = (4/3) * (U/T) = (4π<sup>2</sup>k<sup>4</sup> / (45ħ<sup>3</sup>c<sup>3</sup>)) * V * T<sup>3</sup>\n\nIn summary, the large deviation theorems provide the theoretical framework to understand why maximizing entropy leads to the equilibrium state. By applying this principle to the specific combinatorics of indistinguishable bosons (photons) with non-conserved particle number, we derive the Bose-Einstein distribution. This distribution, in turn, determines the equilibrium mean energy (proportional to T<sup>4</sup>) and entropy (proportional to T<sup>3</sup>) for a gas of light quanta.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values for a photon gas, derived using large deviation principles, are given by the Bose-Einstein statistics for a system with zero chemical potential.\n\nThe **mean energy (U)** of the photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is:\nU = (π<sup>2</sup>k<sup>4</sup> / (15ħ<sup>3</sup>c<sup>3</sup>)) * V * T<sup>4</sup>\n\nThe **entropy (S)** of the photon gas is:\nS = (4π<sup>2</sup>k<sup>4</sup> / (45ħ<sup>3</sup>c<sup>3</sup>)) * V * T<sup>3</sup>\n\nwhere:\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant\n*   c is the speed of light>>>"
