The equilibrium values for a photon gas, derived using large deviation principles, are given by the Bose-Einstein statistics for a system with zero chemical potential.

The **mean energy (U)** of the photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is:
U = (π<sup>2</sup>k<sup>4</sup> / (15ħ<sup>3</sup>c<sup>3</sup>)) * V * T<sup>4</sup>

The **entropy (S)** of the photon gas is:
S = (4π<sup>2</sup>k<sup>4</sup> / (45ħ<sup>3</sup>c<sup>3</sup>)) * V * T<sup>3</sup>

where:
*   k is the Boltzmann constant
*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant
*   c is the speed of light
