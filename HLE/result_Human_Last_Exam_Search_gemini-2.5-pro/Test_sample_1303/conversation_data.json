    "While the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 does not have a clearly defined protein target in major public databases, the context of its associated bioactivity data strongly points to **Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)** as the protein of interest. The direct target listed in the ChEMBL database for this specific compound is N-acetylmuramic acid, which is a component of bacterial cell walls, not a human protein. However, ACE2 is a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system and the functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, making it a significant target for small molecule interactions.\n\nNumerous small molecules have been identified that form protein-ligand interactions with ACE2, acting as either activators or inhibitors of the enzyme or its interaction with other proteins like the viral spike protein.\n\n### Small Molecule Activators of ACE2\n\nThese molecules enhance the enzymatic activity of ACE2. This can have beneficial effects, such as lowering blood pressure.\n\n*   **Xanthenone (XNT)**: Identified through virtual screening, XNT has been shown to enhance ACE2 activity, lower blood pressure, and reverse cardiac and renal fibrosis in hypertensive models.\n*   **Resorcinolnaphthalein**: Discovered alongside XNT, this compound also activates ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner.\n*   **Diminazene aceturate (DIZE)**: An FDA-approved veterinary drug that has been identified as an ACE2 activator.\n*   **Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) derivatives**: Compounds such as **BAR107** and **BAR708** have been identified as potent ACE2 activators through virtual screening and experimental validation.\n*   **Other activators**: Additional small molecules reported to activate ACE2 include **all-trans retinoic acid (atRA)**, **hydroxyzine**, and **minithixen**.\n\n### Small Molecule Inhibitors of ACE2 and the ACE2-Spike Protein Interaction\n\nThese small molecules either directly inhibit the catalytic activity of ACE2 or block the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between ACE2 and the spike protein of coronaviruses, thereby preventing viral entry into cells.\n\n*   **MLN-4760**: A known inhibitor of the catalytic activity of ACE2.\n*   **Compounds targeting the ACE2-Spike PPI**: A significant research effort has focused on finding small molecules to block the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2. Identified inhibitors from various screening efforts include:\n    *   **Dyes**: Congo red, direct violet 1, and Evans blue.\n    *   **Novel Drug-like Compounds**: **DRI-C23041** has shown promising inhibition of the ACE2-spike protein interaction.\n    *   **Natural Products and Repurposed Drugs**: Molecules such as **verteporfin**, **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)**, **calcitriol**, **nilotinib**, **quercetin**, and cannabinoid acids (cannabigerolic and cannabidiolic acids) have been identified as inhibitors.\n*   **Peptide-derived molecules**: While not traditional small molecules, bioactive peptides like **IRW** and its synthetic analogs **A9** and **A14** have been shown to modulate ACE2 and interfere with the spike protein interaction.\n\nIt is important to note that while ACE and ACE2 are related, they are distinct enzymes, and common ACE inhibitors like lisinopril and captopril do not inhibit ACE2. The discovery of small molecules that can modulate ACE2 activity or its interactions represents a promising area for the development of therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases and viral infections.\n\n<<<The chemical with ChEMBL ID CHEMBL4803817 is linked to the protein Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Small molecules that interact with ACE2 can be broadly categorized as activators and inhibitors. Notable activators include Xanthenone (XNT), Resorcinolnaphthalein, and Diminazene aceturate (DIZE). Inhibitors, particularly those that block the interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, include MLN-4760, Congo red, DRI-C23041, and verteporfin.>>>"
