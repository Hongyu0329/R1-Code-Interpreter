The chemical with ChEMBL ID CHEMBL4803817 is linked to the protein Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Small molecules that interact with ACE2 can be broadly categorized as activators and inhibitors. Notable activators include Xanthenone (XNT), Resorcinolnaphthalein, and Diminazene aceturate (DIZE). Inhibitors, particularly those that block the interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, include MLN-4760, Congo red, DRI-C23041, and verteporfin.
