    "The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Contracts (General Part) Law, 5733â€”1973. This law marked a significant shift in Israeli contract law, which had previously been based on the English common law tradition that did not have a general principle of good faith.\n\nThe introduction of the \"good faith\" principle was a major innovation, influenced by continental European legal systems, particularly German law. The statute incorporates this concept in two key sections:\n*   **Section 12** mandates that parties act \"in an acceptable manner and in good faith\" during the negotiations leading up to a contract.\n*   **Section 39** requires that any right or obligation arising from a contract be exercised and fulfilled in good faith.\n\nThe law further extends the duty of good faith to other legal acts and to obligations that do not arise from a contract. Courts in Israel have since made extensive use of the good faith principle, applying it as a foundational tenet of Israeli private law.\n\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
