    "The volume of the intersection of two cubes, each with a side length of 1, that are shifted relative to each other by 1/2 along the main diagonal is calculated as follows:\n\nLet the first cube (C1) be represented by the set of points (x, y, z) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1.\n\nThe main diagonal of this cube connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex (1, 1, 1). A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most commonly interpreted as a displacement by the vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\nTherefore, the second cube (C2) is shifted by this vector. Its coordinates are defined by:\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\nTo find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes, we must find the region where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the conditions for both C1 and C2. This is achieved by finding the intersection of the coordinate intervals for each axis.\n\n*   **x-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   **y-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   **z-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe resulting intersection is a smaller cube with side lengths of 1/2. The volume is the product of these lengths:\n\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
