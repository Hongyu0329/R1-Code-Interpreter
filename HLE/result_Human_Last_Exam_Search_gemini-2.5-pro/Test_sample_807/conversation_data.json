    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride, more commonly known as Rhodamine B, is likely a fluorescent pink shade. While Crayola does not publicly disclose the specific chemical pigments used in their crayons, the properties of Rhodamine B strongly suggest its presence in one of their neon colors.\n\nRhodamine B is a synthetic dye with a vibrant, fluorescent pinkish-red color. Crayola produces a range of \"Neon\" crayons that are designed to fluoresce under black light. Among the fluorescent colors, \"Shocking Pink\" is consistently mentioned as a color that glows under black light.\n\nGiven that Rhodamine B is a well-known fluorescent pigment, it is highly probable that it is the colorant used in Crayola's \"Shocking Pink\" crayon to achieve its bright, fluorescent quality.\n\n<<<Shocking Pink>>>"
