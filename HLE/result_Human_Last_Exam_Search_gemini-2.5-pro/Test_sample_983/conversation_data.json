    "The next number in the sequence is 2358.\n\nThe provided sequence is: 1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352.\n\nUpon analysis, it is evident that every number in this sequence is a multiple of 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it is an even number and the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. All numbers in the sequence are even, and the sum of the digits for each number is a multiple of 3. For instance, for the first number, 1014, the sum of the digits is 1+0+1+4=6, which is divisible by 3. For the last number, 2352, the sum of the digits is 2+3+5+2=12, which is also divisible by 3.\n\nWhile the differences between the numbers in the sequence do not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric pattern, the most fundamental property they all share is being a multiple of 6. Lists of four-digit multiples of 6 confirm that all the numbers in the sequence belong to this set.\n\nThe sequence appears to be a specific selection of these multiples, likely designed to be misleading. Without a clear rule governing the selection of these specific numbers, the most logical continuation is the next consecutive multiple of 6 after the last term.\n\nThe last term in the sequence is 2352. The next multiple of 6 is found by adding 6 to this number:\n\n2352 + 6 = 2358.\n\nTo verify, 2358 is an even number, and the sum of its digits is 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 18. Since 18 is divisible by 3, 2358 is divisible by 6.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
