    "The question asks for the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\). The term \"sum of graphs\" can have several meanings in graph theory. The most common interpretations that yield an interesting and solvable problem are the **join of graphs** and the **union of graphs on the same vertex set**.\n\n### Interpretation 1: Join of Graphs\n\nThe join of two graphs \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\), denoted \\(G_1 + G_2\\), is formed from their disjoint union by adding all edges between the vertices of \\(G_1\\) and the vertices of \\(G_2\\). A key property of the graph join is that its chromatic number is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs: \\(\\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2)\\). This is a standard definition of a graph \"sum\" in many contexts.\n\nIf we interpret \"the sum of three cycles\" as the join of three cycles, \\(G = (C_n + C_n) + C_n\\), the chromatic number is:\n\\[ \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\]\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\(C_n\\) depends on whether \\(n\\) is even or odd:\n*   If \\(n\\) is even (\\(n \\ge 4\\)), \\(\\chi(C_n) = 2\\).\n*   If \\(n\\) is odd (\\(n \\ge 3\\)), \\(\\chi(C_n) = 3\\).\n\nTo maximize \\(\\chi(G)\\), we must maximize \\(\\chi(C_n)\\), which means choosing \\(n\\) to be any odd integer. In this case, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n### Interpretation 2: Union of Graphs on the Same Vertex Set\n\nAnother interpretation is that \\(G\\) is the union of three cycles on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices, i.e., \\(G = C_n^1 \\cup C_n^2 \\cup C_n^3\\), where the vertex set is the same for all three cycles, but the edge sets can be different.\n\nIn this case, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\), \\(\\Delta(G)\\), is at most \\(2+2+2=6\\), as each cycle contributes at most 2 to the degree of a vertex. By Brooks' Theorem, the chromatic number of a graph is at most its maximum degree, unless the graph is a complete graph or an odd cycle. Thus, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\) for most cases.\n\nHowever, if the union of the three cycles forms a complete graph \\(K_n\\), then the chromatic number is \\(n\\). For \\(G\\) to be \\(K_n\\), the number of edges in \\(K_n\\), which is \\(n(n-1)/2\\), must be at most the number of edges in three \\(n\\)-cycles, which is at most \\(3n\\). This implies \\(n(n-1)/2 \\le 3n\\), which simplifies to \\(n-1 \\le 6\\), or \\(n \\le 7\\).\n\nWe check if \\(K_n\\) can be formed by the union of three \\(n\\)-cycles for \\(n \\le 7\\):\n*   **n = 7:** It is a known result in graph theory that the complete graph \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (cycles of length 7). The number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\(7 \\times 6 / 2 = 21\\), and the number of edges in three disjoint 7-cycles is \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\). Thus, for \\(n=7\\), the graph \\(G\\) can be \\(K_7\\), and its chromatic number is \\(\\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n*   For \\(n > 7\\), \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), while the chromatic number of \\(K_n\\) is \\(n > 7\\). Therefore, \\(G\\) cannot be a complete graph. By Brooks' theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\nUnder this interpretation, the maximum chromatic number is 7.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe phrasing \"sum of three cycles\" is ambiguous. However, the interpretation as a **graph join** is a standard definition for \"sum\" and leads to a higher maximum value. Without further clarification, and seeking the maximal possible value, the join operation provides the answer.\n\nThe maximal chromatic number of a graph that is the sum (join) of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is 9. This is achieved when \\(n\\) is any odd number.\n\n<<<9>>>"
