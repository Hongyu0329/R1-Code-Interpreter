    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactyladiene**.\n\nThis compound gets its name from its structural resemblance to a pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived during the time of the dinosaurs and went extinct around 66 million years ago. The name is noted in collections of unusually named chemical compounds.\n\nPterodactyladiene is a polycyclic hydrocarbon with the systematic name Tetracyclo[4.4.0.0<sup>2,5</sup>.0<sup>7,10</sup>]deca-3,8-diene. Its synthesis has been a subject of interest in organic chemistry. The molecule's unique shape, with a central body and wing-like projections, inspired its uncommon name.\n\n<<<Pterodactyladiene>>>"
