    "The next number in the sequence is 124.\n\nThis sequence is derived from the bus numbers that service the Circle Line MRT stations in Singapore, in order of the stations. The Circle Line has a circular main line and a branch line. The sequence of numbers corresponds to the bus services that call at the bus stops nearest to each MRT station, following the station order.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the sequence:\n\n*   **Dhoby Ghaut (CC1):** 111, 142, 111\n*   **Bras Basah (CC2):** 41, 67, 67, 67\n*   **Esplanade (CC3):** 93, 111, 111\n*   **Promenade (CC4):** 62, 62, 111, 111\n*   **Nicoll Highway (CC5):** 36, 36\n*   **Stadium (CC6):** 49, 155, 49\n*   **Mountbatten (CC7):** 62, 49, 49, 62, 62\n*   **Dakota (CC8):** 10, 36, 36, 36\n*   **Paya Lebar (CC9):** 124, 124, 124\n*   **Tai Seng (CC11):** 36\n*   **Bartley (CC12):** 124\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next station on the Circle Line is **Serangoon (CC13)**. One of the bus services for this station is **124**.\n\n<<<124>>>"
