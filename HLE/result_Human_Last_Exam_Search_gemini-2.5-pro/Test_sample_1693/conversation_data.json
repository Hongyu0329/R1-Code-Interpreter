    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the steam merchant **SS Bretagne**. The vessel, with a tonnage of 10,108 tons, was sunk by the German submarine U-45 on October 14, 1939.\n\nThe *Bretagne*, originally the Dutch ship *Flandria*, was owned by the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique and was en route from Cristobal and Kingston to Le Havre with a cargo of general goods. The attack occurred in the morning about 230 miles southwest of Fastnet, Ireland, while the ship was part of the unescorted convoy KJF-3. In the same attack, the U-45 also sank the British ship *Lochavon*. The U-boat itself was sunk later the same day. Survivors from the *Bretagne* were rescued by the British destroyers HMS Imogen and HMS Ilex.\n\nThe only French warship confirmed to have been sunk by a U-boat during this period was the submarine *Doris*. It was sunk by U-9 on May 8, 1940, and had a much smaller displacement of 525 to 765 tons. Other large French vessels, such as the battleship *Bretagne* with a displacement of 23,936 tons, were lost to other causes or after the armistice. The battleship *Bretagne*, for instance, was sunk by British warships at Mers-el-Kébir on July 3, 1940.\n\n<<<Bretagne (10,108 tons)>>>"
