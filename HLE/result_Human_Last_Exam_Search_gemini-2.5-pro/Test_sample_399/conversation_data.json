    "To solve the initial value problem, we first need to find the general solution to the differential equation and then use the initial condition to find the particular solution.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nThis is a separable equation. We can separate the variables by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nPerforming the integration gives:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to find the value of C. Substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = C\n$$\nSubstituting the value of C back into the general solution gives the particular solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nWe want to find the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into this equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, solving for $x(1)$ by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
