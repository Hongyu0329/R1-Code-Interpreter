    "Tadeusz Kotarbiński, a prominent philosopher of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the one who decomposes the notion of a sign into symptoms and signals. This distinction is a key part of his work in praxeology, the theory of efficient action.\n\nWithin Kotarbiński's framework, signs are first divided into these two fundamental categories:\n*   **Symptoms**: These signs are connected to what they indicate through a natural, causal relationship. For instance, smoke is a symptom of fire.\n*   **Signals**: Unlike symptoms, the connection for signals is conventional. Signals are further categorized into asemantic appeals and semantic signals, which include motivated signals (images) and unmotivated, arbitrary signs.\n\nThis classification was part of the Lviv-Warsaw School's broader focus on logical semiotics and the analysis of language. While the term \"hallmark\" itself isn't the standard technical term in this context, the essential decomposition of signs into symptoms and signals based on the nature of their connection to the thing they signify is a clear contribution of Tadeusz Kotarbiński.\n\n<<<Tadeusz Kotarbiński>>>"
