    "To determine the number of distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environments of its protons is required.\n\n### Molecular Structure and Symmetry:\nThe molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) ring. At the 1, 3, and 5 positions, it is substituted with identical large, chiral groups. This 1,3,5-trisubstitution pattern imparts a C3 rotational symmetry to the molecule. Due to this symmetry, the three large substituents are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of non-equivalent protons in one of these substituents and on the central core.\n\n### Analysis of Proton Signals:\n\n1.  **Central Mesitylene Core:**\n    *   **Ar-CH₃ groups:** The three methyl groups attached to the benzene ring at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. These nine protons will produce a single signal. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **Ar-CH₂-N groups:** The three methylene (-CH₂-) groups that link the benzene ring to the indazole substituents are also equivalent by C3 symmetry. However, each methylene group is attached to a chiral center (the entire camphor-derived substituent is chiral). This makes the two protons within each CH₂ group diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and thus resonate at different chemical shifts. All the \"upper\" protons of the three CH₂ groups are equivalent, and all the \"lower\" protons are equivalent. This results in two distinct signals for the methylene protons, which will likely appear as a complex multiplet (an AB quartet). **(2 signals)**\n\n2.  **Camphor-Indazole Substituent:** We only need to analyze one of the three identical arms. The substituent is (4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl. This is a rigid bicyclic system derived from camphor.\n    *   **Indazole H-3:** There is one proton on the indazole ring at the C-3 position. This will give one signal. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **Camphor-derived framework:**\n        *   **Methyl Groups:** There are three methyl groups. The one at C-7 is in a unique environment. The two at C-8 are diastereotopic (often referred to as syn and anti) due to the rigid, asymmetric structure. This results in three separate signals for the methyl groups. **(3 signals)**\n        *   **Bridgehead Methine H-4:** The proton at the C-4 bridgehead is unique. **(1 signal)**\n        *   **Methylene Protons (H-5 and H-6):** The rigid bicyclic structure makes the protons on the C-5 and C-6 methylenes diastereotopic. That is, the endo and exo protons for each carbon are in different chemical environments. Furthermore, the C-5 and C-6 positions themselves are not equivalent. This means the four methylene protons (H-5 endo, H-5 exo, H-6 endo, H-6 exo) are all chemically distinct. **(4 signals)**\n\n### Tally of Expected Signals:\nSumming the signals from each part of the molecule:\n*   Central Core (Ar-CH₃): 1 signal\n*   Central Core (Ar-CH₂-N): 2 signals\n*   Indazole Substituent (H-3): 1 signal\n*   Indazole Substituent (3 x CH₃): 3 signals\n*   Indazole Substituent (H-4): 1 signal\n*   Indazole Substituent (H-5, H-6): 4 signals\n\n**Total = 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 12 signals**\n\nTherefore, a total of 12 distinct peaks (resonances) are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
