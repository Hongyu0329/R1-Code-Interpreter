    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when using the CFOP method on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, you must see a minimum of **5** non-top-facing stickers.\n\nThe reasoning for this number comes from the need to distinguish between the most visually similar of the 21 PLL cases. The four \"G\" permutations (Ga, Gb, Gc, Gd) are particularly challenging because they share common features.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why five stickers are necessary in the worst-case scenario:\n\n1.  **Shared Features of G-Perms:** All four G-perms feature a 1x2 \"block\" (a correctly placed corner-edge pair) on one face and a pair of \"headlights\" (two corners with the same color on their side) on another face.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Block:** To see the 1x2 block, you need to observe at least two stickers: the side-sticker of the corner and the side-sticker of the adjacent edge, confirming they match the face color. (2 stickers)\n\n3.  **Identifying the Headlights:** You then need to locate the headlights on another face. This requires seeing the two side-stickers of the corner pieces on that face. (2 stickers)\n\n4.  **The Ambiguity:** After identifying a block and a pair of headlights on an adjacent face (a total of 4 stickers), you have narrowed the case down to two possibilitiesâ€”for example, the Gb and Gd permutations. You cannot yet distinguish between them.\n\n5.  **The Deciding Sticker:** The final piece of information needed is the permutation direction of the remaining pieces. This can be determined by observing a fifth sticker: the other side-sticker of one of the un-blocked, non-headlight corners. This sticker's color reveals its identity and thus the specific permutation required, resolving the ambiguity. (1 sticker)\n\nTherefore, while many PLL cases can be identified with fewer than five stickers (for instance, a U-perm can be recognized with four), the requirement to distinguish all 21 cases from each other necessitates being able to see at least five stickers in the most complex scenarios.\n\n<<<5>>>"
