    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.\n\nWhile several mushroom species are blue in color, their spore prints are of different colors. For instance, the vibrant blue *Entoloma hochstetteri* has a reddish-pink spore print. Other blue-hued mushrooms like *Stropharia caerulea* (Blue Roundhead) and *Lactarius indigo* (Indigo Milk Cap) have purple-brown and yellowish-cream spore prints, respectively. The name \"Blue Oyster Mushroom\" (*Pleurotus columbinus*) refers to the color of the cap, not the spores.\n\nSpore prints are a crucial characteristic for mushroom identification and typically come in shades of white, cream, pink, purple, brown, and black. While green spore prints are rare, belonging to mushrooms like the poisonous *Chlorophyllum molybdites*, a blue spore print has not been documented in any known mushroom genus.\n\n<<<There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
