It is possible that a functional MRI coil will not show resonance when tested with a magnetic loop antenna and a vector network analyzer due to several factors inherent in its design. These include active detuning circuits that shift the resonant frequency when not in the scanner, the state of transmit/receive switches that may disconnect the resonant element, and the presence of integrated low-impedance preamplifiers that alter the expected impedance profile. Additionally, in phased-array coils, decoupling networks designed to isolate individual elements can mask the resonance of a single element. Finally, RF shielding on the coil can prevent effective coupling with the external test loop.
