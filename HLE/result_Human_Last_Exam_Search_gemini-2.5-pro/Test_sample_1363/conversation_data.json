    "The fundamental technique of the European Tango makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the core principles of the dance.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n*   **Swing Dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, etc.):** In the four other dances listed (Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep), the technique involves continuous, flowing movement, body sway, and Contrary Body Movement (CBM). This \"swing\" allows for the blending and extension of rotation. While overturning a turn in these dances is a technical error, it is physically possible to generate more rotation by exaggerating the sway or CBM without completely abandoning the dance's foundational technique. In fact, some figures are specifically described as \"overturned.\"\n\n*   **European Tango:** Tango is distinct from the swing dances. Its technique is characterized by staccato action, a lack of body sway, and very specific foot placements and walks. Turns are constructed with sharp, precise movements and swivels rather than continuous, flowing rotation. The Open Reverse Turn in Tango, for example, has a defined amount of turn (typically 3/4 over six steps) that is achieved through specific actions like the man's shoulders stopping their rotation to allow the hips to catch up. Trying to add more rotation than is prescribed would require introducing sway (which is incorrect in Tango), breaking the staccato timing, and fundamentally altering the footwork to a point where it is no longer recognizable as Tango technique. One video demonstration even highlights that overturning the body on the second step will land the couple in a completely different position known as a Fallaway.\n\nTherefore, due to its lack of sway and its staccato, placement-oriented technique, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn in the European Tango without fundamentally violating its technical principles.\n\n<<<C>>>"
