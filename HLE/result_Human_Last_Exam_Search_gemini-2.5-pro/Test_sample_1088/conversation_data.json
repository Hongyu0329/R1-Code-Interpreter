    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single, fixed value; it depends on the specific atoms that make up a molecule. To determine the total count, one must first calculate the number of primitive Gaussians for each individual atom and then sum them up.\n\nThe notation \"6-311G**\" provides the recipe for constructing the basis set for each atom:\n\n*   **For \"heavy\" atoms (i.e., any atom other than hydrogen, such as Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen):**\n    *   **6-**: The core orbitals (e.g., the 1s orbital for Carbon) are described by a single contracted function composed of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **-311**: The valence orbitals (e.g., the 2s and 2p orbitals for Carbon) are represented by three separate contracted functions (this is known as a \"triple-split valence\" basis set). In Pople-style basis sets like this one, the s and p valence orbitals share the same primitive exponents to improve computational efficiency.\n        *   The first contracted function (inner valence) is a combination of **3** primitive Gaussians.\n        *   The second (middle valence) is a single primitive Gaussian.\n        *   The third (outer valence) is also a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of primitive Gaussians for the s and p orbitals is 6 (core) + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11 primitives.\n    *   **G**: This simply stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n    *   The first **`*`**: This indicates the addition of a set of polarization functions to these heavy atoms. For second-row atoms, this is a set of d-type functions. In most computational chemistry programs, this corresponds to **6** primitive Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n\n    Adding these up, a single heavy atom in a 6-311G** basis set is described by:\n    11 (for s and p orbitals) + 6 (for d polarization functions) = **17 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n*   **For hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core orbitals, so the \"6-\" part of the notation does not apply. Its single 1s electron is treated as a valence electron.\n    *   **-311**: The 1s orbital is split into three parts:\n        *   A contracted function of **3** primitive Gaussians.\n        *   A single primitive Gaussian.\n        *   A single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   This gives a total of 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive Gaussians for the s-orbital.\n    *   The second **`*`**: This adds a set of polarization functions to the hydrogen atoms. This is a set of p-type functions (p_x, p_y, p_z), which consists of **3** primitive Gaussians.\n\n    Therefore, a single hydrogen atom in a 6-311G** basis set is described by:\n    5 (for the s orbital) + 3 (for p polarization functions) = **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n**Example Calculation: Methane (CH₄)**\n\nTo find the total number of primitive Gaussians for methane:\n*   **Carbon:** 1 atom × 17 primitives/atom = 17 primitives\n*   **Hydrogen:** 4 atoms × 8 primitives/atom = 32 primitives\n*   **Total for CH₄:** 17 + 32 = 49 primitive Gaussians\n\n<<<The total number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is determined by summing the primitives for each atom in the molecule. For heavy atoms (e.g., C, N, O), there are 17 primitive Gaussians per atom. For hydrogen atoms, there are 8 primitive Gaussians per atom.>>>"
