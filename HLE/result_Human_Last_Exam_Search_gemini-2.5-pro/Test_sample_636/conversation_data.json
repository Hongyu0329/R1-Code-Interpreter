    "To calculate the state feedback gain matrix F such that the closed-loop system A + BF has the desired eigenvalues, we will follow the pole placement method.\n\n**1. Define the System and Desired Eigenvalues**\n\nThe given system matrices are:\nA = [[-1, 1],]\nB = [,]\n\nThe desired eigenvalues for the closed-loop system are -1 ± j.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired characteristic polynomial is formed from the desired eigenvalues:\np(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))\np(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)\np(s) = (s + 1)² - (j)²\np(s) = s² + 2s + 1 - (-1)\np(s) = s² + 2s + 2\n\n**3. Formulate the Closed-Loop System**\n\nThe state feedback law is given by u = Fx, where F is a 2x2 matrix since the system has two states and two inputs. Let F be:\nF = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]\n\nThe closed-loop system matrix is A_cl = A + BF.\nBF = [,] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]\nA_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]\nA_cl = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]\n\n**4. Derive the Characteristic Equation of the Closed-Loop System**\n\nThe characteristic equation of the closed-loop system is det(sI - A_cl) = 0.\nsI - A_cl = [[s - (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃), -(1 + f₂ + 2f₄)], [-(1 + f₁), s - f₂]]\nsI - A_cl = [[s + 1 - f₁ - 2f₃, -1 - f₂ - 2f₄], [-1 - f₁, s - f₂]]\n\ndet(sI - A_cl) = (s + 1 - f₁ - 2f₃)(s - f₂) - (-1 - f₂ - 2f₄)(-1 - f₁)\n= s² - sf₂ + s(1 - f₁ - 2f₃) - f₂(1 - f₁ - 2f₃) - (1 + f₁)(1 + f₂ + 2f₄)\n= s² + s(1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃) - f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄ + f₁ + f₁f₂ + 2f₁f₄)\n= s² + s(1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃) - 1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - f₁f₂ - 2f₁f₄\n= s² + s(1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃) + (-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄)\n\n**5. Solve for the Feedback Gain Matrix F**\n\nBy equating the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of A_cl with the desired characteristic polynomial (s² + 2s + 2), we get two equations. However, we have four unknowns (f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄). This indicates that the system is a multi-input system and has more than one possible solution for the feedback matrix F. We can find a solution by simplifying the structure of F.\n\nLet's assume a simpler form for F by setting the second row to zero: f₃ = 0 and f₄ = 0.\nF = [[f₁, f₂],]\n\nThe characteristic equation simplifies to:\ndet(sI - A_cl) = s² + s(1 - f₁) - f₂ - (1 + f₁)(-1 - f₂) = s² + s(1 - f₁ - f₂) + (-1 - f₁ - 2f₂)\n\nNow, we equate the coefficients with s² + 2s + 2:\n1.  Coefficient of s: 1 - f₁ - f₂ = 2  =>  f₁ + f₂ = -1\n2.  Constant term: -1 - f₁ - 2f₂ = 2  =>  f₁ + 2f₂ = -3\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n1) f₁ + f₂ = -1\n2) f₁ + 2f₂ = -3\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n(f₁ + 2f₂) - (f₁ + f₂) = -3 - (-1)\nf₂ = -2\n\nSubstituting f₂ = -2 into the first equation:\nf₁ + (-2) = -1\nf₁ = 1\n\nThus, a valid state feedback gain matrix is:\nF = [[1, -2],]\n\n**6. Verification**\n\nLet's verify this solution. The closed-loop matrix is:\nA_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [,] * [[1, -2],]\nA_cl = [[-1, 1],] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]\nA_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\ndet(sI - A_cl) = det([[s, 1], [-2, s+2]]) = s(s+2) - (1)(-2) = s² + 2s + 2.\nThe roots of this polynomial are s = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8))/2 = -1 ± j. This matches the desired eigenvalues.\n\n<<<[[1, -2],]>>>"
