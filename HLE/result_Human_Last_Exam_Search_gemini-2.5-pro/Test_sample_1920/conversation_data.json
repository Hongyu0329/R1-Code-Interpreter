    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow a structured approach.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n$d = 13 \\times 41 \\times 101$\nAll prime factors appear with an exponent of 1.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ is a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime factor $p_i$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a *primitive* character with conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character modulo its respective prime $p_i$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is not the trivial character (the character that is always 1).\n\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of the component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$\n\nWe need this order to be 6.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Characters of a Specific Order Modulo a Prime\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of integers modulo $p$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. This group is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n\nIn a cyclic group of order $N$, the number of elements of order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $N$. If $k$ does not divide $N$, the number of such elements is 0.\n\nLet $n_p(k)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p$ of order $k$.\n$n_p(k) = \\begin{cases} \\phi(k) & \\text{if } k > 1 \\text{ and } k \\mid (p-1) \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$\nThe condition $k>1$ ensures the character is not the trivial one, and thus is primitive.\n\nWe calculate $p-1$ for each prime factor of $d=53599$:\n*   For $p_1 = 13$: $p_1 - 1 = 12$. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n*   For $p_2 = 41$: $p_2 - 1 = 40$. The divisors of 40 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n*   For $p_3 = 101$: $p_3 - 1 = 100$. The divisors of 100 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.\n\nThe order of our desired character is 6. We check if 6 divides $p-1$ for each prime:\n*   $6 \\mid 12$ (for $p=13$).\n*   $6 \\nmid 40$ (for $p=41$).\n*   $6 \\nmid 100$ (for $p=101$).\n\n### Step 4: Combining the Characters\nLet our character be $\\chi = \\chi_{13}\\chi_{41}\\chi_{101}$. The orders of these component characters, let's call them $o_{13}, o_{41}, o_{101}$, must be divisors of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 6), and their LCM must be 6. This means that at least one component character must have an order that is a multiple of 2, and at least one must have an order that is a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's calculate the number of primitive characters of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6 for each prime factor:\nWe use the formula $n_p(k) = \\phi(k)$ for $k>1$.\n*   $\\phi(1) = 1$ (but not primitive, so count is 0 for primitive)\n*   $\\phi(2) = 1$\n*   $\\phi(3) = 2$\n*   $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$\n\n**For p = 13 ($p-1=12$):**\n*   $n_{13}(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$ (since $2|12$)\n*   $n_{13}(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$ (since $3|12$)\n*   $n_{13}(6) = \\phi(6) = 2$ (since $6|12$)\n\n**For p = 41 ($p-1=40$):**\n*   $n_{41}(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$ (since $2|40$)\n*   $n_{41}(3) = 0$ (since $3 \\nmid 40$)\n*   $n_{41}(6) = 0$ (since $6 \\nmid 40$)\n\n**For p = 101 ($p-1=100$):**\n*   $n_{101}(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$ (since $2|100$)\n*   $n_{101}(3) = 0$ (since $3 \\nmid 100$)\n*   $n_{101}(6) = 0$ (since $6 \\nmid 100$)\n\nWe need to find combinations of orders $(o_{13}, o_{41}, o_{101})$ such that $\\text{lcm}(o_{13}, o_{41}, o_{101}) = 6$. The possible orders for the characters are {1, 2, 3, 6} for $\\chi_{13}$, and {1, 2} for $\\chi_{41}$ and $\\chi_{101}$ (since orders 3 and 6 are not possible for them). Note that order 1 corresponds to the trivial character, which is not primitive.\n\nFor the LCM to be 6, the set of orders must contain a factor of 3 and a factor of 2.\n*   The factor of 3 must come from $o_{13}$, so $o_{13}$ must be 3 or 6.\n*   The factor of 2 can come from any of the orders.\n\nLet's enumerate the valid tuples of orders $(o_{13}, o_{41}, o_{101})$, remembering that orders must be greater than 1 for the characters to be primitive.\nThe possible orders are: $o_{13} \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$, $o_{41} \\in \\{2\\}$, $o_{101} \\in \\{2\\}$.\n\n1.  $o_{13} = 3$:\n    *   To get an LCM of 6, we need a factor of 2. This can come from $o_{41}$ or $o_{101}$ or both.\n        *   $(3, 2, \\text{any > 1})$: Not possible since $o_{101}$ must be 2. Let's consider the primitive characters.\n        *   $o_{41}=2$: Gives $\\text{lcm}(3, 2) = 6$. $o_{101}$ can be the trivial character (order 1) lifted to be primitive w.r.t the product, but our definition of primitivity of $\\chi$ requires each component to be primitive. So $o_{101}$ cannot be 1. But a character of order 1 is never primitive.\n        Let's reconsider. The character $\\chi=\\chi_1\\chi_2\\chi_3$ is primitive if and only if each $\\chi_i$ is primitive. A character $\\chi_i$ mod $p_i$ is primitive if it's not the trivial character. So $o_i > 1$.\n        *   $(o_{13}, o_{41}, o_{101})$ where $o_i>1$.\n        *   Possible orders: $o_{13} \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$, $o_{41}=2$, $o_{101}=2$.\n        *   Case 1: $o_{13}=3$. To get LCM=6, at least one of $o_{41}$ or $o_{101}$ must have order divisible by 2. Both are of order 2. So the combination is $(3,2,2)$. Number of characters: $n_{13}(3) \\times n_{41}(2) \\times n_{101}(2) = 2 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 2$.\n        *   Case 2: $o_{13}=6$. The LCM will be 6 regardless of $o_{41}$ and $o_{101}$ (as long as they are divisors of 6). So we can have $(6,2,2)$. Number of characters: $n_{13}(6) \\times n_{41}(2) \\times n_{101}(2) = 2 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 2$.\n        Wait, I need to be more systematic.\n\nLet $S_{13} = \\{o | n_{13}(o)>0\\} = \\{2,3,4,6,12\\}$.\nLet $S_{41} = \\{o | n_{41}(o)>0\\} = \\{2,4,5,8,10,20,40\\}$.\nLet $S_{101} = \\{o | n_{101}(o)>0\\} = \\{2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100\\}$.\n\nWe need to choose $(o_{13}, o_{41}, o_{101}) \\in S_{13} \\times S_{41} \\times S_{101}$ such that $\\text{lcm}(o_{13}, o_{41}, o_{101}) = 6$.\nThis requires:\n*   $o_{13}, o_{41}, o_{101}$ must all be divisors of 6.\n*   At least one order must be divisible by 3.\n*   At least one order must be divisible by 2.\n\nLet's check the possible orders again:\n*   $o_{13} \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$ (divisors of 6 from $S_{13}$)\n*   $o_{41} \\in \\{2\\}$ (divisors of 6 from $S_{41}$)\n*   $o_{101} \\in \\{2\\}$ (divisors of 6 from $S_{101}$)\n\nSo we choose $o_{13} \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$, $o_{41}=2$, and $o_{101}=2$.\nThe condition is $\\text{lcm}(o_{13}, 2, 2) = 6$.\nThis simplifies to $\\text{lcm}(o_{13}, 2) = 6$.\nFor this to hold, $o_{13}$ must be a multiple of 3. So $o_{13}$ can be 3 or 6.\n\n*   **Case 1: $o_{13}=3$**\n    The tuple of orders is $(3, 2, 2)$.\n    $\\text{lcm}(3, 2, 2) = 6$. This is a valid combination.\n    Number of characters: $n_{13}(3) \\times n_{41}(2) \\times n_{101}(2) = 2 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $o_{13}=6$**\n    The tuple of orders is $(6, 2, 2)$.\n    $\\text{lcm}(6, 2, 2) = 6$. This is also a valid combination.\n    Number of characters: $n_{13}(6) \\times n_{41}(2) \\times n_{101}(2) = 2 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the sum of the counts from all valid combinations.\nTotal = 2 (from Case 1) + 2 (from Case 2) = 4.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1.  Factor d: Correct.\n2.  Condition for primitive character of product conductor: Correct, each component must be primitive (i.e., non-trivial for prime conductor).\n3.  Condition on order: LCM of component orders. Correct.\n4.  Number of primitive characters of order k mod p: $\\phi(k)$ if $k>1$ and $k|(p-1)$. Correct.\n5.  Calculations for each prime:\n    *   $p=13, p-1=12$: $n_{13}(2)=1, n_{13}(3)=2, n_{13}(6)=2$.\n    *   $p=41, p-1=40$: $n_{41}(2)=1, n_{41}(3)=0, n_{41}(6)=0$.\n    *   $p=101, p-1=100$: $n_{101}(2)=1, n_{101}(3)=0, n_{101}(6)=0$.\n    All correct.\n6.  Systematic enumeration of order combinations for LCM=6:\n    *   Let the orders be $(o_1, o_2, o_3)$. All $o_i$ must be $>1$.\n    *   $o_1 \\in \\{2,3,4,6,12\\}$, $o_2 \\in \\{2,4,5,...\\}$, $o_3 \\in \\{2,4,5,...\\}$.\n    *   For $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3) = 6$, all orders must divide 6.\n    *   So, $o_1 \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$, $o_2 \\in \\{2\\}$, $o_3 \\in \\{2\\}$.\n    *   To get LCM=6, we need a '3' and a '2'.\n    *   The '3' must come from $o_1$. So $o_1$ is 3 or 6.\n    *   The '2' is guaranteed as $o_2=2, o_3=2$.\n    *   If $o_1 = 3$, orders are (3,2,2). lcm(3,2,2)=6. Count: $n_{13}(3) \\times n_{41}(2) \\times n_{101}(2) = 2 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 2$.\n    *   If $o_1 = 6$, orders are (6,2,2). lcm(6,2,2)=6. Count: $n_{13}(6) \\times n_{41}(2) \\times n_{101}(2) = 2 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 2$.\n    *   Total is $2+2=4$. The logic holds.\n\nFinal answer seems to be 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
