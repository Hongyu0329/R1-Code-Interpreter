    "To determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit density matrix, we first need to define these terms.\n\n**Qudit:** A qudit is a quantum system with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. A density matrix $\\rho$ for such a system is a $d \\times d$ positive semi-definite matrix with $\\text{Tr}(\\rho)=1$.\n\n**Pauli Channel:** For a $d$-dimensional system, there are $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$. These operators are unitary and form an orthogonal basis for the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices, $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, i.e., $\\text{Tr}(U_i^\\dagger U_j) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ij}$. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel defined by its action on a density matrix $\\rho$ as:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\nwhere the coefficients $p_k$ are probabilities, so $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_k p_k = 1$. The operators $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$ are the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\n**Complementary Channel and its Rank:** Every quantum channel $\\Lambda$ from a system $S$ to a system $B$ has a Stinespring dilation, which represents the channel as a unitary interaction with an environment $E$, followed by tracing out the environment. The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ describes the information flow from the system $S$ to the environment $E$.\n\nIf the Kraus operators of $\\Lambda$ are $\\{A_k\\}$, the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ maps a density matrix $\\rho$ on the input space to a density matrix on the environment space. The action of the complementary channel is given by:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j} \\text{Tr}(A_i \\rho A_j^\\dagger) |i\\rangle\\langle j| $$\nwhere the states $|i\\rangle$ form an orthonormal basis for the environment Hilbert space, whose dimension is equal to the number of non-zero Kraus operators.\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski matrix. The rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is therefore the rank of its Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$. A key result in quantum information theory states that the Choi rank of a complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is equal to the dimension of the linear span of the operators $\\{A_i^\\dagger A_j\\}_{i,j}$.\n\n**Finding the Maximal Rank:**\nTo find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel, we need to choose the probabilities $p_k$ to maximize this rank. The rank is maximized when the set of operators $\\{A_i^\\dagger A_j\\}$ spans the largest possible space.\n\nThe operators are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. Thus, we are interested in the dimension of the linear span of the set of operators:\n$$ S = \\{ A_i^\\dagger A_j = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} U_i^\\dagger U_j \\}_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1} $$\n\nTo maximize the dimension of this span, we should include as many different Pauli operators as possible. This is achieved by choosing $p_k > 0$ for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1\\}$. A simple choice is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k$.\n\nWith this choice, the set of operators whose span we consider is $\\{ \\frac{1}{d^2} U_i^\\dagger U_j \\}_{i,j}$. Since the generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$ form a group up to a phase factor, the product of any two Pauli operators, $U_i^\\dagger U_j$, is another Pauli operator (multiplied by a phase). As we vary $i$ and $j$ over all $d^2$ possibilities, the set of resulting operators $\\{U_i^\\dagger U_j\\}$ will contain every Pauli operator $U_k$ (multiplied by various phases).\n\nTherefore, the linear span of the set $S$ is the same as the linear span of the set of all generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$. Since the $d^2$ Pauli operators form a basis for the entire space of $d \\times d$ matrices $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, the dimension of this span is $d^2$.\n\nThus, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel on a $d$-dimensional qudit is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
