    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 0.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of this result:\n\n1.  **The Space:** The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G(3, 5)$. This is a compact manifold of dimension $3 \\times (5-3) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Integral Cohomology Ring:** The integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the integral cohomology groups, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{k=0}^{6} H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Finitely Generated Cohomology Groups:** For a compact manifold like the Grassmannian, each cohomology group $H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\n4.  **Torsion Subgroup:** The torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group. Let $T_k = \\text{Tors}(H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$. The torsion subgroup of the ring is $T = \\bigoplus_{k=0}^{6} T_k$.\n\n5.  **Structure of Torsion Subgroups:** For any finitely generated abelian group, its torsion subgroup is a finite group. Therefore, each $T_k$ is a finite group. The direct sum of a finite number of finite groups is also a finite group. Thus, $T$ is a finite abelian group. It is known that the torsion in the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is entirely 2-torsion, meaning every torsion element has an order that is a power of 2.\n\n6.  **Rank of an Abelian Group:** The rank of a finitely generated abelian group is the number of copies of the infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$ in its decomposition into a direct sum of cyclic groups. This is equivalent to the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring the group with the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n7.  **Rank of a Torsion Group:** A torsion group, by definition, consists of elements of finite order. A finite group has no copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in its decomposition. Consequently, the rank of any finite abelian group is 0. Since the torsion subgroup $T$ is a finite group, its rank is 0.\n\nThis conclusion relies only on general principles of algebraic topology and group theory and does not require the explicit calculation of the individual cohomology groups, for which there are some conflicting accounts in the literature.\n\n<<<0>>>"
