As t -> âˆž, the edges of the image will first smooth out, rounding sharp corners. Then, any closed shapes defined by the edges will shrink and eventually disappear. This process minimizes the total edge length, ultimately causing the entire image to converge to a single color, either completely black or completely white, depending on the initial geometry of the black and white regions.
