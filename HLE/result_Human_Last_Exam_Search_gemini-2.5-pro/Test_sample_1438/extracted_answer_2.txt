The measure for a Grassmann variable integral in the path integral formalism for fermionic systems does not have a numerical value. Instead, it is defined by the rules of Berezin integration, where ∫ dθ = 0 and ∫ dθ θ = 1. These rules are a direct consequence of the anticommuting nature of Grassmann variables (θ² = 0), which is the mathematical embodiment of the Pauli exclusion principle.
