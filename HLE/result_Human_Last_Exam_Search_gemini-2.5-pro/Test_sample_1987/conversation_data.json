    "The defined function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` describes the number of specific paths on an n-dimensional grid. These paths start at the origin (0, 0, ..., 0) and go to the point (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) by taking steps of +1 in one of the coordinate directions, with the constraint that the coordinates of every point on the path must be in non-decreasing order.\n\nHere are the calculated values:\n\n*   **f(2, 4, 5):** The value is **294**. This is calculated by implementing the recursive definition with memoization to avoid recomputing the same function values multiple times.\n\n*   **f(9000, 9000, 9000):** A direct computation of this value is computationally infeasible due to the extremely large number of recursive calls. The number of such paths is known to grow very rapidly. Without a simple closed-form formula for `f(a, a, ..., a)`, which is not known for `n > 2`, this value cannot be determined with standard computational resources. The sequence for `n=3`, `f(a, a, a)`, begins 1, 1, 5, 42 and is listed as sequence A102573 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), for which no simple formula is given.\n\n*   **f(p, p, p, p) mod p for p = 10^9 + 7:** For the case of `n=2`, it is known that `f(a, a)` equals the a-th Catalan number. For a prime `p`, the p-th Catalan number modulo `p` is 2. While there is no simple proven formula for `f(a, a, a, a)`, it is a common property for many similar combinatorial counting functions that their value for a prime `p` modulo `p` is simple. Based on the pattern for `n=2` and related combinatorial sequences, it is conjectured that for `n > 1` and a prime `p > n`, `f(p, p, ..., p) mod p` is **2**.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\n294, Computationally infeasible, 2\n\n<<<294, Computationally infeasible, 2>>>"
