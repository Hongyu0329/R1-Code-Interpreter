Yes, replacing the amide group with a PEG group is a very effective and commonly used strategy to increase the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic probes and would likely solve the precipitation problem. The original probe has significant hydrophobic character due to the large, planar thioxanthenone core and the long chloro-hexyl alkyl chain, leading to its poor solubility in the aqueous cell culture medium at 100 ÂµM. PEG (Polyethylene Glycol) is a highly hydrophilic, non-toxic polymer. Attaching a PEG chain (PEGylation) to the probe would increase its overall hydrophilicity, improve its stability, and reduce aggregation, thereby preventing it from precipitating out of the solution. This technique is widely used in drug discovery and for improving the properties of fluorescent probes for biological applications.
