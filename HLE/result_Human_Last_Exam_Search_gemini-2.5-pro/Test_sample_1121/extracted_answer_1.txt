Based on this analysis, the questions as posed do not have straightforward numerical answers.

For the first scenario, the absolute minimum number of non-Clifford gates required to achieve universality is **one (1)** T gate, but this is a theoretical minimum for the gate set and does not represent a useful computation. A distance-3 code is suitable only for demonstrating the basic principles of such an operation, not for fault-tolerant execution of a complex algorithm.

For the second scenario, it is not meaningful to ask about the number of non-Clifford gates. An implementation of a universal quantum computer is not feasible on a distance-5 surface code with a 1% physical error rate, as this error rate is at the fault-tolerance threshold, rendering the error correction ineffective.
