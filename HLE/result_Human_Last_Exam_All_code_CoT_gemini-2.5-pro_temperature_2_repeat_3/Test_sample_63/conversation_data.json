    "My plan is to solve this two-part riddle. First, I will identify the man Kurt Vonnegut mentioned. The quote \"looks like a porcupine in all the pictures\" is from Vonnegut's novel *Hocus Pocus* and refers to the composer Johannes Brahms. However, his name does not meet the second condition of the riddle.\n\nThe second part requires naming a man with a two-word name where both words start with the same letter, who also fits the \"porcupine\" description. There is a famous American singer and actor known for his unique, tall, spiky hair that could be described as porcupine-like. His name fits the alliterative requirement. I will therefore provide the name of this man, as he fits both the visual and naming conventions of the riddle, treating the Vonnegut quote as a contextual clue for the \"porcupine\" look.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the man who fits the description.\n    - He is known for a \"porcupine-like\" hairstyle.\n    - His name consists of two words starting with the same letter.\n    \"\"\"\n    first_name = \"Lyle\"\n    last_name = \"Lovett\"\n    print(f\"{first_name} {last_name}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Lyle Lovett>>>"
