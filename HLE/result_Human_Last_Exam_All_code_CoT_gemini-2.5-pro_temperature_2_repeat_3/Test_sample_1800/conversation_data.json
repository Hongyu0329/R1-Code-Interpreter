    "Of course. The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic performance is not a single, universally fixed value. It is determined through experimental research and can vary based on the specific synthesis method, reaction conditions (like temperature), and the exact performance metric being measured (e.g., conversion efficiency, stability, selectivity).\n\nHowever, I can provide a summary of the most commonly cited optimal ranges found in scientific literature. The goal is typically to achieve a high dispersion of small Ni nanoparticles on the ceria support, which maximizes the active sites and the crucial interface between the nickel and ceria.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Briefly explain the role of Ni and Ceria in these reactions.\n2.  Summarize the findings for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction.\n3.  Summarize the findings for Water Splitting (WS).\n4.  Use a Python script to present these findings in a clear, structured format, explicitly printing the numbers that make up the ideal ratios as requested.\n\nThe Python code below will print a summary based on a review of experimental data from catalysis studies.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ni_ceria_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and presents the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic reactions\n    based on findings from scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analysis of Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio in Ni-Ceria Catalysts\")\n    print(\"-\" * 55)\n\n    print(\"\\n[Background]\")\n    print(\"The goal is to maximize the synergy between Nickel (the active catalyst) and Ceria (the support).\")\n    print(\"Too little Ni leads to insufficient active sites.\")\n    print(\"Too much Ni can lead to particle agglomeration (sintering), reducing efficiency and stability.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n[1.
