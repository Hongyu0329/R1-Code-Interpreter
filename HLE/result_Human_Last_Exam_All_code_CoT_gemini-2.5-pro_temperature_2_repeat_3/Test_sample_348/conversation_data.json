    "Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Functions**: First, we will define the given supply and demand functions in Python.\n    *   Supply: `P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)`\n    *   Demand: `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium**: Market equilibrium occurs where supply equals demand (`P_S = P_D` and `Q_S = Q_D`). We'll set the two equations equal to each other: `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`. Since this equation is complex to solve analytically, we will use a numerical solver, specifically `scipy.optimize.fsolve`, to find the equilibrium quantity (`Q_e`). Once `Q_e` is found, we can calculate the equilibrium price (`P_e`) by substituting `Q_e` into either function.\n3.  **Formulate Total Welfare**: Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.\n    *   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve from `Q=0` to `Q_e`, minus the revenue rectangle (`P_e * Q_e`).\n        `CS = ∫[0 to Q_e] D(Q) dQ - P_e * Q_e`\n    *   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the revenue rectangle (`P_e * Q_e`) minus the area under the supply curve. Note that the supply function is only defined for `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. Therefore, the integral starts from this minimum quantity.\n        `PS = P_e * Q_e - ∫[2^(1/3) to Q_e] S(Q) dQ`\n    *   **Total Welfare (TW)** is `CS + PS`. The `P_e * Q_e` terms cancel out, leaving:\n        `TW = ∫[0 to Q_e] D(Q) dQ - ∫[2^(1/3) to Q_e] S(Q) dQ`\n4.  **Calculate and Display**: We will use `scipy.integrate.quad` to compute the definite integrals for the areas under the demand and supply curves. Finally, we'll calculate the total welfare and print the step-by-step calculation, including the numerical values for the integrals.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
