After finding the information, I will write a simple Python script that stores the name of the city in a variable and then prints it to the console, fulfilling the request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_in_ovosodo():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the name of the US city\n    the character Tommaso moves to in the 1997 film 'Ovosodo'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character Tommaso, the protagonist's best friend, moves to the United States.\n    us_city = \"New York\"\n    \n    # Print the answer for the user.\n    print(f\"In the movie Ovosodo, Tommaso moves to the US city of {us_city}.\")\n\nfind_city_in_ovosodo()\n```\n<<<New York>>>"
