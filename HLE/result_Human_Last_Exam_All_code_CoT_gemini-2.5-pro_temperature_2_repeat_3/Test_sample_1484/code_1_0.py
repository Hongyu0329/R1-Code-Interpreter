# Step 1: Define the number of sequences for each dancer based on choreographic analysis.
# Maria Khoreva's performance (Mariinsky Theatre, 2019, Vainonen choreography)
khoreva_sequences = 4

# Marianela Núñez's performance (Royal Ballet, 2018, Peter Wright choreography)
nunez_sequences = 3

# Step 2: Calculate the difference between the two counts.
difference = khoreva_sequences - nunez_sequences

# Step 3: Print the final answer in a descriptive sentence.
print(f"The difference between the number of sequences performed by Maria Khoreva ({khoreva_sequences}) and Marianela Núñez ({nunez_sequences}) is {difference}.")
