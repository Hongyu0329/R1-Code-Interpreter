    The problem asks for the largest x value for which the summation
    sum_{i=0 to inf} 1 / ((x + i - 1)! * i!)
    converges to 0.

    This summation is equivalent to the modified Bessel function of the first kind, I_{x-1}(2).
    For real x, I_{x-1}(2) is always positive, so there is no real solution.

    We assume a typo and that the intended sum was an alternating series:
    sum_{i=0 to inf} (-1)^i / ((x + i - 1)! * i!)
    This corresponds to the Bessel function of the first kind, J_{x-1}(2).

    We solve for the largest x such that J_{x-1}(2) = 0. This involves finding the largest
    root (nu) of the equation J_nu(2) = 0, and then calculating x = nu + 1.
