    This function identifies the key lab parameter.
    
    The patient's history of facial rash, joint pain, and hematuria points to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
    The rapid deterioration into end-stage kidney disease suggests a severe flare of lupus nephritis.
    
    The most specific lab marker for an active lupus nephritis flare is the anti-dsDNA antibody titer.
    - Anti-dsDNA antibodies are pathogenic, directly causing kidney damage.
    - Titers of these antibodies correlate strongly with SLE disease activity, especially nephritis.
    
    Therefore, a significant increase in anti-dsDNA antibodies would best indicate the cause of the renal decline.
