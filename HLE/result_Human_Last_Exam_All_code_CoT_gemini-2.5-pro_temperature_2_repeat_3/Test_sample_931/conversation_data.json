    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) feed on, I will follow these steps:\n1.  Research the diet of adult Raphidioptera using established ecological and entomological knowledge.\n2.  Analyze each answer choice to see if it aligns with the known feeding habits.\n3.  Note that Raphidioptera are primarily found in the Northern Hemisphere, while several options refer to species native to New Zealand. I will consider the food *type* rather than the specific species mentioned in these cases.\n4.  Synthesize the findings to select the most comprehensive and accurate answer from the choices provided.\n5.  Present this reasoning and the final conclusion in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Research the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies).\")\n    predatory_diet = \"small, soft-bodied insects like aphids and mites\"\n    supplemental_diet = \"nectar and pollen\"\n    print(f\"Finding: Adult snakeflies are primarily predators of {predatory_diet}.\")\n    print(f\"Finding: They also supplement their diet with {supplemental_diet}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluate the given answer choices based on this information.\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    # Choice A: Nectar\n    print(\"A.

Snakeflies are not found there. -> Incorrect (specifics are wrong)\")\n\n    # Choice C: Fungus\n    print(\"C. Fungus: Snakeflies are not known to be fungivores. -> Incorrect\")\n\n    # Choice D: Karamū leaf tissue\n    print(\"D. Karamū leaf tissue: Snakeflies are predators, not herbivores. -> Incorrect\")\n\n    # Choice E: Totara Aphids\n    print(\"E. Totara Aphids: While Totara is a New Zealand native, 'Aphids' are a primary food source for snakeflies.
