    "In the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, the Nash Equilibrium is for both players to defect, leading to a suboptimal outcome of (1, 1) for each. However, when the game is played in a quantum setting using an appropriate framework, this dilemma can be resolved, leading to a new, superior equilibrium.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Set up the Quantum Game:** We will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, a common framework for quantum games.\n    *   **Initial State:** The two players' qubits start in a maximally entangled state, `|ψ_initial⟩ = J|00⟩`. The entangling operator `J` is crucial. We choose `J = exp(i * π/4 * σ_y ⊗ σ_y)`, where `σ_y` is the Pauli-Y matrix. This represents maximal entanglement.\n    *   **Player Strategies:** Each player's strategy is a unitary operator applied to their own qubit. The classical \"Cooperate\" (C) strategy corresponds to the identity matrix `I`. We introduce a specific quantum strategy, `Q = i * σ_z` (where `σ_z` is the Pauli-Z matrix), which acts as a new type of \"Defection\".\n    *   **Final State & Measurement:** After players apply their strategies (`U_A` and `U_B`), a disentangling operator `J†` (the conjugate transpose of J) is applied. The final state is `|ψ_final⟩ = J† (U_A ⊗ U_B) J |00⟩`. Payoffs are then calculated based on the probabilities of measuring the four classical outcomes (`|00⟩`, `|01⟩`, `|10⟩`, `|11⟩`).\n\n2.  **Find the Equilibrium:** We will analyze the game with the strategy set `{C, Q}`. We will show that the strategy pair `(Q, Q)` forms a Nash Equilibrium where both players receive the optimal payoff for mutual cooperation.\n\n3.  **Demonstrate with Code:** The python code will calculate the final probabilities and payoffs for the equilibrium case `(Q, Q)`, confirming that it results in the optimal outcome of (5, 5).\n\nThe crucial insight is that with this specific `J` operator, the strategy `Q = i*σ_z` for both players commutes with the entanglement operation. This leads to the final state `|ψ_final⟩ = -|00⟩`, meaning the probability of mutual cooperation `P_CC` is 1. This makes `(Q, Q)` a stable equilibrium, as any unilateral deviation results in a lower or equal payoff. The equilibrium point yields a payoff of (5, 5) for the players.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import expm\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Prisoner's Dilemma in a quantum setting using the EWL protocol.\n    \n    This function calculates the payoffs for the Nash Equilibrium that resolves\n    the classical dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Payoff matrix values\n    # R: Reward (C,C), S: Sucker (C,D), T: Temptation (D,C), P: Punishment (D,D)\n    R = 5\n    S = 0\n    T = 7\n    P = 1\n    \n    payoffs = {'R': R, 'S': S, 'T': T, 'P': P}\n\n    # Define Pauli matrices and Identity\n    I = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]], dtype=complex)\n    sigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]], dtype=complex)\n    sigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]], dtype=complex)\n\n    # 1.
