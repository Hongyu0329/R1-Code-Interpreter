    "Of course. Here is my plan to derive the expression for the fixed point coupling in `ϕ⁴` theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce the Beta Function:** The starting point for finding a fixed point in a quantum field theory is the beta function, `β(u)`. This function describes how the coupling constant `u` changes as the energy scale (or, equivalently, length scale) changes. For the `ϕ⁴` theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the beta function to the lowest order (one-loop) in the coupling `u` is given by a known formula.\n2.  **State the Fixed Point Condition:** A \"fixed point\" `u*` represents a special value of the coupling where the theory becomes scale-invariant. At this point, the coupling no longer changes with the energy scale, which mathematically means the beta function is zero: `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **Solve for the Fixed Point:** By setting the beta function equation to zero, we can solve for `u*`. This equation will have a trivial solution (`u* = 0`, the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial one, which is the Wilson-Fisher fixed point we are looking for.\n4.  **Construct the Python Script:** I will write a Python script that programmatically lays out these steps. The script will use `print` statements to explain the derivation and present the final expression for `u*` in terms of `ϵ`, clearly showing all the numerical factors involved.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script derives and prints the leading order expression for the \n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* in ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the beta function for ϕ⁴ theory\n    print(\"Step 1: The Beta Function\")\n    print(\"In ϕ⁴ theory near d=4 dimensions, the renormalization group flow of the coupling 'u' is governed by the beta function.\")\n    print(\"To one-loop order, the beta function is:\")\n    print(\"β(u) = -ϵu + B * u²\")\n    print(\"Here, ϵ = 4 - d is a small parameter, and B is a constant determined by the theory.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: State the value of the constant B\n    print(\"Step 2: The Coefficient B\")\n    B_numerator = 3\n    B_denominator_str = \"16π²\"\n    print(f\"For the single-component ϕ⁴ theory, the one-loop coefficient B = {B_numerator}/{B_denominator_str}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Set up the fixed point condition\n    print(\"Step 3: The Fixed Point Condition\")\n    print(\"A fixed point, u*, is a value of the coupling where the theory is scale-invariant.
