    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the song and generate the code.\n\n1.  First, I will analyze the user's request. The user is asking for a Beatles song that begins with a specific chord progression: a \"jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\"\n2.  The term \"minor fifth chord\" is non-standard in music theory. A standard progression might be tonic to dominant (I -> V). A \"minor fifth chord\" could be interpreted as a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale (a 'vm' chord).\n3.  However, a more famous and audibly distinct \"jump\" in the Beatles' catalog is the move from a major tonic chord to its parallel minor (I -> i). This creates a very noticeable shift in mood from major (happy) to minor (sad) on the same root note.\n4.  Considering famous Beatles intros, the song \"Michelle\" is the most prominent example of this I -> i shift. The song's intro is in the key of F Major. The introductory guitar riff immediately moves from an F Major chord to an F Minor chord. This distinctive opening is almost certainly what the user is referring to, even if the terminology is imprecise.\n5.  Therefore, I will write a Python script that identifies \"Michelle\" as the answer and clarifies that the progression is from a tonic major to a tonic minor chord (F Major -> F Minor). The code will print out each component of this progression as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Beatles song based on a description of its opening chord progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    \n    # The song starts on the tonic chord in the key of F.\n    tonic_chord = \"F Major\"\n    \n    # It then \"jumps\" to the tonic minor chord. This I -> i (major to minor tonic)\n    # change is very distinctive and likely what is being described.\n    next_chord = \"F Minor\"\n    \n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that famously starts with a chord 'jump' from the tonic major to the tonic minor is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis chord change (from I to i) is likely what the user means by 'jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord'.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe specific chord change at the beginning of the song is:\")\n    \n    # As requested, printing each part of the final progression \"equation\".\n    print(tonic_chord)\n    print(\"->\")\n    print(next_chord)\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
