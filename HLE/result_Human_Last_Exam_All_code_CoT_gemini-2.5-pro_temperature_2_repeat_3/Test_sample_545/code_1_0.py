    This function solves the chemistry problem by providing the IUPAC name of the major product.

    The reaction is a sulfoxide pyrolysis.
    1.  Starting Material: The name ((2-((2-methylbut-3-en-2-yl)oxy)ethyl)sulfinyl)benzene corresponds to the structure Ph-S(=O)-CH2-CH2-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, where Ph is a phenyl group.

    2.  Reaction: This compound is a sulfoxide with β-hydrogens (on the CH2 group adjacent to the oxygen). When heated, it undergoes a syn-elimination reaction. The oxygen atom of the sulfoxide abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a C=C double bond and breaking the C-S bond.

    3.  Products: The elimination yields two molecules:
        - Phenylsulfenic acid (Ph-SOH), which is neutralized by the sodium bicarbonate.
        - The major organic product: CH2=CH-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

    4.  IUPAC Nomenclature of the Product:
        - The structure is CH2=CH-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. This is an ether.
        - The more complex substituent is chosen as the parent. The `-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2` group is more complex than the `-CH=CH2` (vinyl) group.
        - The parent chain is derived from `-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2`. The longest chain containing the double bond is a butene chain. Numbering from the end closest to the double bond gives `...-C3(CH3)2-C2H=C1H2`, which makes it a derivative of `but-1-ene`.
        - The substituents are on carbon 3: a `-CH3` (methyl) group and a `CH2=CH-O-` (ethenyloxy) group.
        - Alphabetizing the substituents (ethenyloxy before methyl), the name is constructed.

    The final IUPAC name is 3-(ethenyloxy)-3-methylbut-1-ene.
