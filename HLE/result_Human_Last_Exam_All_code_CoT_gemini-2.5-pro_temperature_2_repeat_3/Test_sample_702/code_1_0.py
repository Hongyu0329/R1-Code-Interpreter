# Parameters from the problem statement
# The map is from Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n) to Omega(S^m wedge S^n)
# where m=4 and n=6.

m = 4
n = 6

# Step 1: We interpret the map as a composition of the Whitehead product map W and the suspension map E.
# W: Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n) -> S^(m+n-1)
# E: S^(m+n-1) -> Omega(S^(m+n)) which is Omega(S^m wedge S^n)

# Step 2: Calculate the connectivity of the Whitehead product map W.
# The connectivity of the generalized Whitehead product map is a classical result.
# conn(W) = m + n - 1
conn_W = m + n - 1
print(f"The map W is from Sigma(Omega S^{m} wedge Omega S^{n}) to S^({m}+{n}-1).")
print(f"m = {m}, n = {n}")
print(f"The connectivity of the Whitehead product map W is {m} + {n} - 1 = {conn_W}.")


# Step 3: Calculate the connectivity of the suspension map E.
# The map is E: S^k -> Omega S^(k+1) where k = m + n - 1.
# By the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, this map is (2k-1)-connected.
k = m + n - 1
# Connectivity of S^k is k-1. Per the theorem (for an (l-1)-connected space), conn(E) is 2l-1.
# Here, S^k is (k-1)-connected, so l=k. Thus, conn(E) is 2k-1.
conn_E = 2 * k - 1
print(f"The map E is from S^{k} to Omega S^({k}+1), with k = {k}.")
print(f"The connectivity of the suspension map E is 2 * {k} - 1 = {conn_E}.")


# Step 4: The connectivity of the composite map is the minimum of the individual connectivities.
final_connectivity = min(conn_W, conn_E)
print(f"The connectivity of the composite map is the minimum of the connectivities of W and E.")
print(f"Connectivity = min({conn_W}, {conn_E}) = {final_connectivity}.")

print(f"\nFinal calculation in one line:")
print(f"Connectivity = min({m} + {n} - 1, 2*({m}+{n}-1) - 1) = {final_connectivity}")
