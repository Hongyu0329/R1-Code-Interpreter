# The poem uses personification and metaphor to describe a natural phenomenon.
# The subject, "she," is described as "cold."
# She creates intricate things like a "veil," "lace," and a "comb" on plants ("grass and meadowsweet").
# The materials and appearance are described as "lace and glass," "feather stitch," and "jewelled."
# This language powerfully evokes the delicate, crystalline, and lace-like patterns of frost.
# The setting is Autumn, and the frost is temporary, waiting to be destroyed ("fray") by the wind and weather ("pelted Autumn and his echoed roar").
# Choice A perfectly encapsulates all these elements.
