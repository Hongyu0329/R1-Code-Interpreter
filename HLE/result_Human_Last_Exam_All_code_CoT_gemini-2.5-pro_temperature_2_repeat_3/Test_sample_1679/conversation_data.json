    "To answer your question, I will identify the first film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture and visually features one of the two Luxor Obelisks.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Identify Obelisk Locations:** The two Luxor Obelisks are located in Luxor, Egypt, and in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **Create a Chronological List:** I will go through the list of Academy Award Best Picture winners starting from the first award.\n3.  **Research Film Settings:** For each film, I will identify its setting. I will pay special attention to any films set in Paris or Egypt.\n4.  **Confirm Visual Depiction:** For any film set in a relevant location, I will research whether the Luxor Obelisk is actually shown on-screen.\n5.  **Identify the First Match:** The first film chronologically that meets all the criteria is the answer.\n\nThe following Python script automates the final step of this process by searching through a researched list of early winners to find the first one confirmed to show the obelisk.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_movie_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Best Picture winner known to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \n    This function searches a pre-compiled list representing historical film data.\n    The two Luxor Obelisks are in Luxor, Egypt, and Paris, France.
