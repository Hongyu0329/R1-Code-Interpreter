    The logic is based on current medical guidelines for adolescent nicotine cessation:
    1.  The primary goal is complete cessation of all nicotine and tobacco products.
    2.  Adolescents should be educated about the specific risks of vaping, including effects on brain development and addiction.
    3.  Evidence-based cessation aids, such as Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) and certain prescription medications, should be offered as part of a comprehensive plan.
