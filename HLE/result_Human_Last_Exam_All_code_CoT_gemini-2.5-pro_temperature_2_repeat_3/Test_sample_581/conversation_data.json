    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe problem asks for the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in the 8-dimensional affine space over the field with 3 elements, denoted as `cap(8)`. A cap set is a collection of points where no three points lie on a line.\n\nFinding the maximum size of cap sets is a major open problem in combinatorics and number theory. Lower bounds are established by finding explicit constructions of large cap sets. While a simple construction gives a lower bound of `2^n` (which would be `2^8 = 256` for dimension 8), more advanced constructions and computer searches have found larger sets.\n\nThe best-known lower bound for `cap(8)` comes from such a constructive result found through computer search. The code below will state this established value.\n\n```python\n# The dimension of the vector space over F_3\nn = 8\n\n# The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.\n# This value is a result of extensive mathematical research and computer searches,\n# rather than a simple formula.\nbest_known_lower_bound = 496\n\n# The final equation shows the relationship between the maximum cap set size\n# in dimension 8, cap(8), and its known lower bound.\n# Here we print each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"cap({n}) >= {best_known_lower_bound}\")\n```\n<<<F>>>"
