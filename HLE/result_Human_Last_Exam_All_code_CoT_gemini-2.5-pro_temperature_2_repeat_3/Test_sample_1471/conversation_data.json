    "Of course, I can help you solve this equation.\n\nFirst, I will convert the Roman numerals into modern numbers:\n*   `VI` = 6\n*   `CCC` = 300\n*   `CCCIX` = 309\n\nThe equation can then be rewritten as:\n6 / 300 - 309\n\nI will now calculate the result. According to the order of operations, division comes before subtraction.\n1.  6 / 300 = 0.02\n2.  0.02 - 309 = -308.98\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\n# The equation is VI / CCC - CCCIX = ?\n\n# Convert Roman numerals to modern numbers\nnum1 = 6  # VI\nnum2 = 300 # CCC\nnum3 = 309 # CCCIX\n\n# Calculate the result following the order of operations\nresult = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# Print the full equation in modern numbers along with the solution\nprint(f\"The equation in modern numbers is:\")\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-308.98>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
