    "To determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph with 10 nodes during randomized uniform gossiping, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: A standard, symmetric barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each (`K₅`), connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n\n2.  **Model the Gossiping Process**: Randomized uniform gossiping works in two steps:\n    *   First, a node is selected uniformly at random from all 10 nodes.\n    *   Second, this selected node chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to interact with.\n\n3.  **Calculate Node Degrees**: We need the degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge. Let's call them `u` and `v`.\n    *   Any node in a `K₅` clique is connected to the other 4 nodes within that clique.\n    *   The node `u` (and `v`) is connected to 4 nodes in its own clique and also to the other bottleneck node across the bridge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of both bottleneck nodes is `d(u) = d(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability**: The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n    *   **Event 1**: Node `u` is chosen, and it then chooses node `v`.\n        *   Probability of choosing node `u` is `1/10`.\n        *   Probability of `u` choosing `v` from its 5 neighbors is `1/5`.\n        *   Probability of Event 1 = `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n    *   **Event 2**: Node `v` is chosen, and it then chooses node `u`.\n        *   Probability of choosing node `v` is `1/10`.\n        *   Probability of `v` choosing `u` from its 5 neighbors is `1/5`.\n        *   Probability of Event 2 = `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n5.  **Sum the Probabilities**: The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n    *   Total Probability = `1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a symmetric\n    10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # For a symmetric barbell graph, the nodes are split into two equal-sized cliques.\n    nodes_per_clique = int(total_nodes / 2)\n\n    # The two cliques are connected by a single bottleneck edge.\n    # Let's find the degree of a node connected to this edge.\n    # It is connected to all other nodes in its clique (nodes_per_clique - 1)\n    # plus the one node across the bottleneck.\n    degree_of_bottleneck_node = (nodes_per_clique - 1) + 1\n\n    # The probability of selecting any specific node in the graph is 1 / total_nodes.\n    prob_select_node = 1 / total_nodes\n\n    # The probability of a selected bottleneck node choosing its partner across the bridge\n    # is 1 / its degree.\n    prob_select_neighbor = 1 / degree_of_bottleneck_node\n\n    # The sampling of the bottleneck edge can happen in two ways:\n    # 1. Node u is picked, and it picks neighbor v.\n    prob_case1 = prob_select_node * prob_select_neighbor\n    # 2. Node v is picked, and it picks neighbor u.\n    prob_case2 = prob_select_node * prob_select_neighbor\n\n    # The total probability is the sum of these two mutually exclusive cases.\n    total_probability = prob_case1 + prob_case2\n\n    # The final equation is P(total) = P(u->v) + P(v->u)\n    # P(u->v) = P(u is picked) * P(v is picked | u was picked)\n    # P(v->u) = P(v is picked) * P(u is picked | v was picked)\n    # The numbers are: 1/total_nodes, 1/degree_of_bottleneck_node for each case.\n\n    # Redirecting print to sys.stdout as per platform convention.\n    original_stdout = sys.stdout\n    try:\n        # Final outputting of the equation with each number.\n        print(\"The final probability is calculated from the sum of two scenarios:\")\n        print(\"1.
