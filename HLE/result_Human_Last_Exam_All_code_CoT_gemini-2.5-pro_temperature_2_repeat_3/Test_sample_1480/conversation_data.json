    "To calculate the rule activation level for a fuzzy rule, we combine the membership degrees of its components using a t-norm operation. A t-norm generalizes the logical 'AND' operation. The most commonly used t-norm is the minimum function, `t(a, b) = min(a, b)`.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define two variables for the given values: `Phi_k(x′)=0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values to find the rule activation level.\n3.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Given Values ---\n# Phi_k(x′) represents the firing level of the antecedent part of the rule.\nphi = 0.7\n# muG_k_j(y_j) represents a membership value from the consequent part of the rule.\nmu_G = 0.9\n\n# --- T-norm Operation ---\n# A t-norm is a function that models the logical AND operation in fuzzy logic.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum function, t(a, b) = min(a, b).\n# We calculate the rule activation level by applying this t-norm to the given values.\nactivation_level = min(phi, mu_G)\n\n# --- Output the Result ---\nprint(\"Calculating the rule activation level using the minimum t-norm.\")\nprint(f\"The given values are Phi_k(x') = {phi} and mu_G_k_j(y_j) = {mu_G}.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is: min({phi}, {mu_G})\")\nprint(f\"The resulting rule activation level is: {activation_level}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
