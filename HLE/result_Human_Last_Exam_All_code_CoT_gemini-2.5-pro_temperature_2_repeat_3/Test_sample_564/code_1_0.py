Step 1: Identify the key phrase and the word in question.
The phrase is 'lentaque miserrima tabe'. The word in question is 'miserrima'.

Step 2: Analyze the potential forms of 'miserrima'.
The form 'miserrima' is a superlative adjective. Grammatically, it could be:
- Nominative Singular Feminine ('the most miserable woman...')
- Ablative Singular Feminine ('with/by/from the most miserable...')

Step 3: Analyze the surrounding words.
- 'tabe': This is from the noun 'tabes, tabis, f.', meaning 'wasting away' or 'decay'. The form 'tabe' is Ablative Singular Feminine.
- 'lentaque': This is the adjective 'lenta' (slow) with '-que' (and) attached. For it to modify 'tabe', it must also be in the Ablative Singular Feminine form.

Step 4: Analyze the syntactic structure (word order).
The phrase is structured as 'lentaque miserrima tabe'. This is a common Latin construction where a noun ('tabe') is enclosed by its modifying adjectives ('lenta' and 'miserrima'). This word order creates a strong expectation that all three words form a single noun phrase.

Step 5: Apply the rule of agreement.
For adjectives to modify a noun, they must agree in Case, Number, and Gender.
- Noun: 'tabe' (Ablative, Singular, Feminine)
- Adjectives: 'lenta' and 'miserrima' must therefore also be Ablative, Singular, Feminine.

Step 6: Draw the conclusion.
The case of 'miserrima' is guaranteed to be Ablative because its position between 'lenta' and 'tabe' shows it modifies 'tabe'. This grammatical requirement of agreement forces its case.

Step 7: Evaluate the other options.
- B (dolore): 'dolore' is masculine; 'miserrima' is feminine. No agreement is possible.
- C (nocte) & E (luce): These nouns are in a different clause. 'miserrima' describes the 'tabe' (wasting), not the 'nocte' (night) or 'luce' (daylight).
- D (the meter): The grammatical structure is the primary determinant. Syntax clarifies meter more often than meter clarifies syntax in cases like this.

Final Conclusion: The word position is the key factor that determines the grammatical relationship, which in turn guarantees the case.

# The final answer is A because the word position between 'lenta' and 'tabe' guarantees that 'miserrima' modifies 'tabe', and thus must be in the same case (Ablative).
