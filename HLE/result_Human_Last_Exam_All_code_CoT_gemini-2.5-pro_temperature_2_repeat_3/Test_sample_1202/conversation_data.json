    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a conceptual question from evolutionary biology. While I can't run a simulation to find the answer, I can use a Python script to structure the analysis of the options, explain the underlying concepts, and logically arrive at the correct answer.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  I will define the biological question and the provided answer choices.\n2.  I will analyze each choice to determine its role in the evolution of duplicated genes.\n3.  I will specifically compare the two most plausible mechanisms: Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization.\n4.  The analysis will conclude which mechanism is considered the most common, and therefore the \"most likely,\" pathway for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n5.  The final script will print this structured analysis and state the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_fates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains the mechanisms responsible for the retention and\n    divergence of duplicate genes to determine the most likely option.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': {\n            \"name\": \"Gene conversion\",\n            \"explanation\": \"This process makes homologous DNA sequences identical.
