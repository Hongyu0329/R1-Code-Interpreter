    # Initial state and naive assumption
    print("1. The setup has two compartments with a one-way door.")
    print("   Naive assumption: Molecules randomly pass to one side and get trapped, violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics.\n")

    # The role of temperature and thermal equilibrium
    print("2. The Second Law of Thermodynamics cannot be violated by a simple mechanical device.")
    print("   Physicist Richard Feynman analyzed this system, known as a 'Brownian Ratchet'.\n")

    # Condition 1: Uniform Temperature (Equilibrium)
    print("3. Case 1: The entire system (gas and door) is at a single, uniform temperature.")
    print("   - The door itself has thermal energy and is subject to Brownian motion.")
    print("   - It will jiggle and flap randomly.")
    print("   - This random flapping negates the one-way function, allowing gas to leak back.")
    print("   Result: The gas remains distributed across both compartments. The demon fails.\n")

    # Condition 2: Temperature Difference (Non-Equilibrium)
    print("4. Case 2: There is a temperature difference (e.g., the door is colder than the gas).")
    print("   - A colder door does not flap as much from its own thermal energy.")
    print("   - It can successfully rectify the motion of the hotter gas molecules, acting as a true one-way gate.")
    print("   Result: Gas is systematically transferred to one compartment. The demon succeeds.\n")

    # Conclusion
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("A temperature difference is the required experimental parameter to drive the system away from equilibrium and trap the gas on one side.")
    print("Without a temperature gradient, the system obeys the Second Law, and no sorting occurs.")
