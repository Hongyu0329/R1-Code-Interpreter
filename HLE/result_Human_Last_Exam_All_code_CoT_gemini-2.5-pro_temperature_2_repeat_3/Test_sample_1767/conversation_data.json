    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant, and for weakly interacting systems that are combined, the total Chern number of the resulting system is simply the sum of the individual Chern numbers. In this case, we are connecting two Chern insulators.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define two variables, `C1` and `C2`, to represent the Chern numbers of the two insulators.\n2.  Set both `C1` and `C2` to 1, as given in the problem.\n3.  Calculate the total Chern number, `C_total`, by summing `C1` and `C2`.\n4.  Print the result in a clear format that shows the full addition equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers for the two individual insulators\nC1 = 1\nC2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\n# Print the final equation showing the calculation\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2 = {C1} + {C2} = {C_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
