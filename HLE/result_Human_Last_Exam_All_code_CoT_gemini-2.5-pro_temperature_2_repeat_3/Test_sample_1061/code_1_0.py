    print(f"\nAnalyzing E: '{options['E']}'")
    print("The SE Asia monsoon is the dominant climate system controlling water availability in the study region.")
    print("Effect of Monsoon Strength: A stronger monsoon means more rainfall and higher humidity.")
    print("This reduces water stress, allowing trees to keep stomata open and strongly discriminate against 13C.")
    print("Result: A strengthening monsoon trend would cause a DECREASE in the 13C ratio, matching the observation.")
    print("Conclusion: Among the choices provided, this is the most powerful and direct environmental factor that could cause the observed trend.")
