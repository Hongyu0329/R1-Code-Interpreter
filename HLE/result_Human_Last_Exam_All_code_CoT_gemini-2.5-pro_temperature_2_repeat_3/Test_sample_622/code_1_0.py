    Binding Theory in linguistics governs how different types of noun phrases can refer to each other. The core principles are:
    - Principle A: An anaphor (e.g., 'himself', 'herself') must be 'bound' (have a co-referent antecedent) within its own clause.
    - Principle B: A pronoun (e.g., 'he', 'she') must be 'free' (cannot have a co-referent antecedent) within its own clause.
    - Principle C: An R-expression (a referring expression, like a name 'Mary' or 'John') must be 'free' everywhere. It cannot be c-commanded by a co-referent expression.

    - 'Mary' is an R-expression. The subscript '_i' indicates it refers to the same entity as 'She_i'.
    - 'She' is a pronoun that is the subject of the sentence. It c-commands the object 'Mary'.
    - Because the R-expression 'Mary_i' is c-commanded by the co-referent pronoun 'She_i', it is not 'free'.
    - This is a clear violation of Binding Principle C. Therefore, this sentence is ungrammatical due to a binding principle.

    - This sentence is ungrammatical, but not because of a binding violation.
    - The error is a violation of a movement constraint known as the 'Left Branch Condition'. The possessor 'Whose' cannot be extracted from the noun phrase 'Whose glasses' on its own. The entire phrase ('Whose glasses') must be moved to the front of the sentence, as in 'Whose glasses does John like?'.
    - There is no anaphor, pronoun, or R-expression in an illegal binding relationship.
