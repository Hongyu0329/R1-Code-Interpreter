    # The user's question asks to identify two key historical influences on Wolfhart Pannenberg's later theology,
    # specifically his concepts of "cosmic history" and "contingent time".

    reasoning = """
    1.  The concept of a universal or 'cosmic' history, where God's revelation unfolds, is central to Pannenberg's theology. This is a direct and critical engagement with Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's philosophy of history, which posits history as the self-realization of the Absolute Spirit. Pannenberg reinterprets Hegel's framework for his own theological ends, making Hegel a primary intellectual source.

    2.  The concept of 'contingency'—that the universe and time are open-ended and not predetermined—is crucial for Pannenberg's dialogue with modern physics and for his eschatology (theology of the end times). For this, he draws significantly from Friedrich Schelling. Schelling's philosophy of nature (Naturphilosophie) and his later works on freedom and contingency provided a philosophical framework for seeing the natural world as a dynamic, evolving process, which is a necessary foundation for a theology built on a contingent, open future.

    3.  Therefore, the two key historic thinkers that Pannenberg primarily draws upon for his model of cosmic history built on a contingent concept of time are Georg Hegel and Friedrich Schelling. This corresponds to option E.
