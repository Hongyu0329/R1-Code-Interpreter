    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we will use the topological rules that govern these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Formulas:** The structure of any connected Feynman diagram is described by two fundamental relationships:\n    *   The **vertex rule**, which relates the number of vertices (`V`), the type of interaction (`n`-point), the number of internal lines (`I`), and the number of external lines (`E`):\n        `n * V = 2 * I + E`\n    *   The **loop rule**, which connects the number of loops (`L`), internal lines (`I`), and vertices (`V`):\n        `L = I - V + 1`\n\n2.  **Set the Knowns:** We are given that the diagram must have two loops, so `L=2`. An \"interacting\" theory requires that the number of lines at a vertex, `n`, must be 3 or greater. The number of vertices `V` must be at least 1, and the number of external lines `E` can be 0 or more.\n\n3.  **Systematic Search:** We are looking for the minimum possible value of `V`. We will write a Python script to perform a search:\n    *   The script will start by checking if a valid diagram exists for `V=1`. If not, it will check for `V=2`, and so on.\n    *   For each `V`, it will loop through possible interaction types (`n=3, 4, ...`) and numbers of external lines (`E=0, 1, 2, ...`).\n    *   For each combination (`V`, `n`, `E`), it will first calculate the necessary number of internal lines, `I`, using the vertex rule. For `I` to be a valid, physical number, `(n * V - E)` must be a non-negative even integer.\n    *   If `I` is valid, the script will then check if this set of parameters satisfies the loop rule for `L=2`.\n    *   The first valid set of parameters found will give us the minimum number of vertices. The script will then print the full details of this minimal diagram, including the equations it satisfies.\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function searches for the minimum number of vertices (V) required\n    to form a two-loop (L=2) Feynman diagram in an interacting scalar field theory.\n    It iterates through possible values for V, interaction type (n), and\n    external lines (E) to find the first combination that satisfies the\n    topological rules of Feynman diagrams.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    loops = 2\n\n    # We want to find the minimum V, so we start the search with V=1.\n    for v in range(1, 10):  # Test for V = 1, 2, 3...\n        \n        # An interaction requires at least 3 lines meeting at a vertex.\n        for n in range(3, 10): # Test interaction type n=3 (phi^3), n=4 (phi^4)...\n            \n            # Diagrams can have 0 or more external lines (E=0 is a vacuum bubble).\n            for e in range(0, 10): # Test E = 0, 1, 2...\n                \n                # From the vertex rule: n * V = 2 * I + E\n                # Therefore, 2 * I = n * V - E\n                # The term (n * V - E) must be a non-negative, even integer\n                # for I (number of internal lines) to be a valid non-negative integer.\n                \n                term = n * v - e\n                if term >= 0 and term % 2 == 0:\n                    i = term // 2\n                    \n                    # Now check the topological loop rule: L = I - V + 1\n                    if loops == i - v + 1:\n                        # We have found a valid set of parameters.
