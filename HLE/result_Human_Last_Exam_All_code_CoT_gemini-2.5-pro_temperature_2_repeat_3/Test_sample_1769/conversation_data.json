    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the hypothetical modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source Word:** The modern English word \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse \"systir,\" which replaced the native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word. The first step is to identify that original Old English word. This word was \"sweoster.\"\n2.  **Trace Linguistic Evolution:** I will trace the likely path of \"sweoster\" through history, applying known English sound changes that occurred between the Old English period and today.\n    *   **Diphthong Simplification:** The Old English diphthong 'eo' was often simplified. In a word like \"sweoster,\" it would have likely simplified to 'o', similar to how \"sweord\" (sword) evolved. This gives us a hypothetical Middle English form: \"swoster.\"\n    *   **Consonant Cluster Simplification:** The initial \"sw-\" sound in some words was simplified to just \"s-\". For example, the Old English word \"swā\" became \"so.\" Applying this rule gives us the form \"soster.\"\n3.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that simulates this linguistic transformation. The script will:\n    *   Start with the Old English word \"sweoster.\"\n    *   Apply transformation steps to arrive at the hypothetical modern word \"soster.\"\n    *   To fulfill the request for an equation, I will assign numerical IDs to each transformation rule and calculate a final \"Word ID\" to represent this linguistic journey. The final printout will display the equation and the resulting word.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Start with the original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for sister, which is 'sweoster'.\n#    The modern 'sister' is from Old Norse 'systir', so we must revert to the Anglo-Saxon root.\n# 2. Simulate the natural linguistic evolution this word would have undergone.\n#    - Rule 1: The Old English diphthong 'eo' simplifies to 'o'. ('sweoster' -> 'swoster')\n#    - Rule 2: The 'sw' consonant cluster simplifies to 's' at the beginning of a word. ('swoster' -> 'soster')\n# 3. Create a representative \"linguistic derivation equation\" to show the transformation steps numerically.\n\n# --- Linguistic Analysis ---\n\n# Define the base word and its arbitrary numerical ID.\nold_english_word = \"sweoster\"\nbase_word_id = 1480\n\n# Define the linguistic transformation rules and their arbitrary numerical IDs.\n# Rule 1: 'eo' vowel simplification to 'o'.\nrule_1_id = 70\nintermediate_word = \"swoster\"\n\n# Rule 2: 'sw' consonant cluster simplification to 's'.\nrule_2_id = 20\nfinal_word = \"soster\"\n\n# Calculate the final word's ID.\nfinal_word_id = base_word_id - rule_1_id - rule_2_id\n\n# --- Output the result ---\nprint(\"If the Norse had never influenced the English language, the word for 'sister' would have evolved from its original Old English form.\")\nprint(f\"The Old English word was: '{old_english_word}'\")\nprint(\"\\nApplying historical sound changes:\")\nprint(f\"1.
