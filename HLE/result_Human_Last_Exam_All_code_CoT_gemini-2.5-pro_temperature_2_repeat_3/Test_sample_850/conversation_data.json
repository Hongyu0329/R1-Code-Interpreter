    "This is an interesting question that delves into the specific symmetry requirements for different crystal properties. Let's break down the logic to find the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define Optical Activity:** First, I'll establish the fundamental symmetry requirement for a crystal to be optically active. Optical activity is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property can only exist in materials that are **chiral**.\n2.  **Define Chirality:** A crystal structure (and its corresponding point group) is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. From a symmetry perspective, this means the point group must not contain any **improper rotation axes**. Improper rotation axes are symmetry operations that change the \"handedness\" of an object. They include:\n    *   Inversion center (`ī` or `-1`)\n    *   Mirror planes (`m`)\n    *   Rotoinversion axes (`-3`, `-4`, `-6`)\n3.  **Analyze the User's Request:** The request asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n    *   **Achiral:** The opposite of chiral. This means the crystal class *must* contain at least one improper rotation axis (inversion, mirror, or rotoinversion).\n    *   **Non-polar:** This is a separate condition relating to the absence of a unique polar direction.\n    *   **Optically Active:** This requires the crystal class to be **chiral**.\n4.  **Identify the Contradiction:** There is a direct logical contradiction in the request. A material cannot be both **chiral** (a requirement for optical activity) and **achiral** at the same time. These two categories are mutually exclusive.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Because optical activity requires chirality, and the question asks for achiral classes, no such crystal classes can exist. The set of \"achiral\" and the set of \"optically active\" crystal classes are disjoint. Therefore, their intersection is the empty set.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic step-by-step and prints the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_optical_activity_requirements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the symmetry requirements for optical activity in crystals\n    and addresses the user's specific query.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Helper function for printing formatted text\n    def print_wrapped(text):\n        print(textwrap.fill(text, width=80))\n        print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the requirements for optical activity in crystal classes...\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define Optical Activity\n    print(\"Step 1: What is the symmetry requirement for Optical Activity?\")\n    print_wrapped(\n        \"A crystal can exhibit optical activity (rotate the plane of polarized light) \"\n        \"only if its structure is chiral.
