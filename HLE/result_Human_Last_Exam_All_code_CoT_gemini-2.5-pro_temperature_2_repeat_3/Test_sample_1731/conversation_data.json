    "Of course. I will help you with this task. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The goal is to determine the equilibrium expressions for mean energy `<E>` and entropy `S` for a gas of light quanta (photons). The method should be based on the principles of statistical mechanics, whose justification lies in large deviation theorems like Boltzmann-Sanov, as mentioned by the user.\n\n2.  **Connecting Large Deviation Theory to the Method:**\n    *   The user's reference to large deviation theorems points to the fundamental justification for using the principle of maximum entropy in statistical mechanics. Boltzmann's formula, `S = k * ln(W)`, defines entropy in terms of the number of microstates (multiplicity `W`) corresponding to a given macrostate.\n    *   Large deviation theory confirms that the macrostate with the maximum entropy is exponentially more probable than any other. Therefore, the equilibrium state of an isolated system is the one that maximizes its entropy.\n\n3.  **Derivation Outline:**\n    *   **State Definition:** The macroscopic state is defined by the number of photons, `n_j`, in each energy level `ε_j`.\n    *   **Entropy Maximization:** The equilibrium distribution is found by maximizing the Bose-Einstein entropy `S` under the constraint of a fixed mean total energy `<E>`. For photons, particle number is not conserved, so the chemical potential is zero.\n    *   **Equilibrium Distribution:** This optimization problem yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for the mean occupation of an energy level: `<n(ε)> = 1 / (exp(ε / kT) - 1)`.\n    *   **Mean Energy `<E>`:** We find the total mean energy by integrating the energy `ε` weighted by this distribution over the density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a volume `V`. The result is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy: `<E> = a * V * T⁴`.\n    *   **Entropy `S`:** Using the fundamental thermodynamic relation `S = (<E> - Φ)/T`, where `Φ` is the grand potential, we find a simple relationship for the photon gas: `S = (4/3) * <E> / T`.\n\n4.  **Python Implementation:**\n    The Python script will not perform the symbolic derivation but will calculate the physical constants in the final equations and present the results clearly.\n    *   Define fundamental physical constants (`k`, `h`, `c`).\n    *   Compute the coefficient `a` for the energy equation.\n    *   Compute the coefficient `b` for the entropy equation.\n    *   Print an explanation of the steps, followed by the final equations for `<E>` and `S` with their numerical coefficients explicitly shown, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and presents the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy\n    of a photon gas based on statistical mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical constants in SI units\n    k = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    h = 6.62607015e-34 # Planck constant in J*s\n    c = 2.99792458e8   # Speed of light in m/s\n\n    # The user mentioned Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems.\n    # These theorems provide a rigorous foundation for the principle of maximum\n    # entropy used in statistical mechanics.
