    # entropy used in statistical mechanics. The core idea is that the
    # equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the most probable macroscopic
    # configuration, which is the one with the maximum entropy (S).

    # The derivation proceeds by maximizing the Bose-Einstein entropy for a photon gas
    # subject to a fixed mean energy <E>. This leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution
    # and the following expressions for <E> and S.
