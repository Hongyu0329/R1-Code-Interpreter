    "This is a historical trivia question, not a coding task. However, as instructed, I will provide the answer within a Python code block that prints the information. My plan is to find the correct historical answer and then display it using a simple `print` statement in Python.\n\n```python\n# The user has asked for the true profession of Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee\n# investigated by British counterintelligence during World War II.\n# The answer is a known fact from historical records.\n\n# Define the profession\ntrue_profession = \"a pimp\"\n\n# Print the answer to the user's question\nprint(f\"Andre Vernault concealed his true profession from interrogators because he was {true_profession}.\")\nprint(\"He was reportedly ashamed and feared it would cause him trouble, but his evasiveness made MI5 suspect he was a German spy.\")\n\n```\n<<<A pimp>>>"
