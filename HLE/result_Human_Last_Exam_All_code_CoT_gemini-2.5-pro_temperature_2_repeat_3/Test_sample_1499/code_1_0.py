# The task is to find the Old Church Slavonic form for the 3rd person plural imperative of the verb "to be".
# Based on Old Church Slavonic grammar, the 3rd person imperative forms often match the corresponding indicative (present or future) forms.
# The future stem of "to be" is бѫд-.
# The 3rd person plural future indicative form is бѫдѫтъ.
# Therefore, the 3rd person plural imperative form is the same.
form = "бѫдѫтъ"
