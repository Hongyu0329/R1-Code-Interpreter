    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request**: The goal is to identify the coldest temperature from a given list at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be synthesized efficiently. This is a chemistry knowledge question.\n2.  **Recall Chemical Knowledge**: The standard, most common, and efficient laboratory synthesis of XeF4 involves the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2) gases. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is `Xe + 2F2 -> XeF4`.\n3.  **Identify Reaction Conditions**: This reaction requires heating the mixture in a nickel container to a temperature of approximately 400 °C at several atmospheres of pressure. While reactions might occur at other temperatures, 400 °C is the widely cited condition for an efficient process.\n4.  **Create a Python Script**: The script will encode this scientific fact. It will:\n    *   Store the known efficient synthesis temperature (400 °C).\n    *   Store the multiple-choice answers provided.\n    *   Programmatically find which choice matches the known temperature.\n    *   Print a clear explanation, including the balanced chemical equation with its coefficients and the resulting temperature, to satisfy the user's prompt.\n\nHere is the Python code to determine the answer:\n\n```python\ndef find_xef4_synthesis_temp():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the most common and efficient synthesis temperature for\n    Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) from a set of options.\n    \n    This is a knowledge-based problem.
