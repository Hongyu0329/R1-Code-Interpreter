    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, and more generally in many-body physics, the bare Green's function $G_0$ for a non-interacting particle describes its propagation. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is fundamental to the theory.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify the quantity of interest:** We are interested in the bare Green's function, $G_0$. The term \"bare\" signifies that we are considering a non-interacting system.\n2.  **Identify the relevant variables:** The key variables are the energy (or frequency) of the particle, which we'll denote by $\\omega$, and its intrinsic, single-particle energy, which is the eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ for a state with momentum $k$.\n3.  **Recall the definition:** The Green's function is the inverse of the operator $(\\omega - H_0)$, where $H_0$ is the non-interacting Hamiltonian. In the basis of eigenstates of $H_0$, the operator becomes diagonal with entries $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n4.  **Formulate the mathematical relationship:** Inverting this operator in the frequency-momentum domain gives the expression for the Green's function. The standard form for the real-frequency retarded Green's function is:\n    $G_0(\\omega, k) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n5.  **Interpret the formula:**\n    *   This formula shows that $G_0$ is **inversely proportional** to the difference $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n    *   There is a resonance (the value of $G_0$ becomes very large) when the probing energy $\\omega$ is equal to the particle's intrinsic energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n    *   The term $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimally small positive imaginary number. It is a mathematical device to handle the pole at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$ correctly, ensuring causality (the effect does not precede the cause). Physically, it can be interpreted as giving the non-interacting particle an infinitely long lifetime.\n6.  **Plan the code:** I will write a Python script that calculates $G_0$ for given values of $\\omega$, $\\epsilon_k$, and $\\delta$. The script will first define these parameters, then apply the formula, and finally print the full equation with the numerical values plugged in, along with the final result. This will concretely demonstrate the functional relationship.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0 for a given single-particle\n    energy eigenvalue (epsilon_k) and frequency (omega).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # epsilon_k: The single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum k.\n    # This is the \"natural\" energy of the non-interacting particle.\n    # Let's choose a value in some arbitrary energy units (e.g., eV).\n    epsilon_k = 2.5\n\n    # omega: The frequency variable, which corresponds to the energy of a probe\n    # or the energy at which we are observing the system.\n    omega = 2.4\n\n    # delta: A small positive infinitesimal used to enforce causality.\n    # It shifts the pole slightly off the real axis.\n    delta = 0.1\n\n    # --- The Functional Form ---\n    # The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the\n    # single-particle energy epsilon_k is given by the formula:\n    # G_0(omega, k) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*delta)\n    # This shows G_0 is inversely proportional to (omega - epsilon_k).\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    # Python's `complex` type (or `1j`) is used to represent the imaginary unit i.\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * delta\n    G_0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0(ω, k)\")\n    print(\"is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and the\")\n    print(\"single-particle energy eigenvalue ɛ_k.\\n\")\n    print(\"The formula for the retarded Green's function is:\")\n    print(\"  G_0(ω, k) = 1 / (ω - ɛ_k + iδ)\\n\")\n    print(\"Calculating for the specific values:\")\n    print(f\"  Frequency (ω)      = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"  Energy Eigenvalue (ɛ_k) = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"  Infinitesimal (δ)     = {delta}\\n\")\n    \n    # The user request is to show the full final equation.\n    print(\"The final equation with these values is:\")\n    # We print the numbers that go into the equation\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + {delta}i)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe result of the calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = {G_0}\")\n\n\ncalculate_bare_greens_function()\n```\n<<<The functional dependence is inverse proportionality, as described by the formula $G_0(\\omega, k) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$.
