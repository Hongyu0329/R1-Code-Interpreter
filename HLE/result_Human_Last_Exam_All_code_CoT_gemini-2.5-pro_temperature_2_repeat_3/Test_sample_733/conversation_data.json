    "To solve this problem, I will first clarify the mathematical definitions involved. Then, I will outline a plan to computationally check small finite groups to find how many of them satisfy the given condition. Finally, I will provide a Python script that implements this plan and determines the answer.\n\n### Definitions\n1.  **Product-Free Set**: A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x` and `y` in `S` (including the case where `x` and `y` are the same element), their product `xy` is not an element of `S`. In set notation, this is `(S \\cdot S) \\cap S = \\emptyset`.\n\n2.  **Maximal by Inclusion**: A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion (or just \"maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g` in `G` that is not in `S`, the new set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is *not* product-free.\n\n### Plan\nThe goal is to find the number of non-isomorphic finite groups that contain at least one maximal product-free set of size 2. Since we cannot check all possible finite groups, I will write a script to check a representative sample of all non-isomorphic groups up to a certain small order.\n\nThe script will perform the following steps:\n1.  Define a set of common finite groups to be tested (e.g., Cyclic groups `C_n`, the Klein four-group `V_4`, the symmetric group `S_3`).\n2.  For each group `G` in our list:\n    a. Iterate through all possible subsets `S` of `G` with size 2. For `S = \\{x, y\\}`, `x` and `y` must not be the identity element, otherwise, the set cannot be product-free (e.g., if `x` is the identity `e`, then `y \\cdot x = y \\in S`).\n    b. For each subset `S`, check if it's product-free.\n    c. If `S` is product-free, check if it's maximal.\n    d. If a group is found to have at least one such set, we add it to our count and move to the next group.\n3.  The final result will be the total count of groups that satisfy the condition.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan. It defines the structure of groups using multiplication tables and systematically checks for the property.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_product_free(s, group_elements, mul_table):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a set s is product-free.\"\"\"\n    s_indices = {group_elements.index(e) for e in s}\n    for e1 in s:\n        for e2 in s:\n            idx1 = group_elements.index(e1)\n            idx2 = group_elements.index(e2)\n            product_idx = mul_table[idx1][idx2]\n            if product_idx in s_indices:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef is_maximal(s, group_elements, mul_table):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a product-free set s is maximal.\"\"\"\n    s_with_g = set(s)\n    other_elements = [e for e in group_elements if e not in s]\n    for g in other_elements:\n        s_with_g.add(g)\n        # Check if S u {g} is product-free.
