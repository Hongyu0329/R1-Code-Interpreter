# --- Problem Definition ---
# We want to find an upper bound for the braid index of the three-twist knot (6_1)
# using Vogel's algorithm. This algorithm's output depends on the initial knot
# diagram. We will use the standard minimal crossing diagram.

# --- Step 1: State the properties of the three-twist knot (6_1) ---
# The knot is represented by its minimal crossing diagram.
c = 6  # Minimal crossing number
g = 1  # Knot genus

# --- Step 2: Explain the method ---
# Vogel's algorithm produces a braid whose number of strands is equal to the
# number of Seifert circles (s) of the input diagram. This number provides an
# upper bound for the braid index.
# The number of Seifert circles (s) for a diagram realizing the knot genus (g)
# can be calculated with the formula: s = c + 1 - 2*g

print("Applying Vogel's algorithm to this diagram yields a braid with this many strands.")
