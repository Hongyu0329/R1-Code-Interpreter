    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link, we first need to understand the formula and the components involved.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a quasi-homogeneous polynomial `W` is defined by the formula:\n    `inv(W) = (sum of weights) - 2 * (degree of the polynomial)`\n\n2.  **Extract the Weights:** The weights `w_i` for the variables `(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)` are given as (22, 29, 49, 50, 75).\n\n3.  **Determine the Degree (d):** For a polynomial to be quasi-homogeneous, every term must have the same weighted degree. We will calculate the degree of each term in the polynomial `W = z_1^8z_3 + z_1^4z_2^3z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3`:\n    *   `deg(z_1^8z_3) = 8*22 + 1*49 = 176 + 49 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_1^4z_2^3z_3) = 4*22 + 3*29 + 1*49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224`\n    *   `deg(z_1z_2^7) = 1*22 + 7*29 = 22 + 203 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5) = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_2z_3^4) = 1*29 + 4*49 = 29 + 196 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_4^3z_5) = 3*50 + 1*75 = 150 + 75 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_5^3) = 3*75 = 225`\n\n    We notice an inconsistency: one term has a degree of 224, while all others have a degree of 225. The Calabi-Yau condition for a hypersurface is that the degree `d` must equal the sum of the weights. Let's calculate the sum of the weights:\n    `sum(w_i) = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`\n    Since the sum of the weights is 225 and nearly all terms have this degree, we will proceed assuming `d=225`, attributing the discrepancy to a likely typo in the polynomial.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant:** We will now substitute the sum of the weights and the degree `d` into the formula and solve.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these calculations and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a given Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights for the variables (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)\n    weights = np.array([22, 29, 49, 50, 75])\n    \n    # Exponents for each term in the polynomial W.\n    # W = z_1^8z_3 + z_1^4z_2^3z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3\n    # Note: As discussed, there is likely a typo in the second term.\n    # We will assume the degree d is determined by the Calabi-Yau condition (d = sum of weights).\n    \n    # 1. Calculate the sum of the weights\n    sum_of_weights = np.sum(weights)\n    \n    # 2. Determine the degree d of the polynomial\n    # For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the degree 'd' equals the sum of the weights.\n    d = sum_of_weights\n    \n    # 3. Calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant\n    # Formula: inv(W) = sum(w_i) - 2 * d\n    invariant = sum_of_weights - 2 * d\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the final equation\n    print(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"Invariant = (sum of weights) - 2 * (degree d)\")\n    print(\"\\nGiven values:\")\n    print(f\"Weights = {list(weights)}\")\n    print(f\"Sum of weights = {sum_of_weights}\")\n    print(f\"Degree (d) = {d}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    # The user requested to see each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"{sum_of_weights} - 2 * {d} = {invariant}\")\n\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n```\n<<<-225>>>"
