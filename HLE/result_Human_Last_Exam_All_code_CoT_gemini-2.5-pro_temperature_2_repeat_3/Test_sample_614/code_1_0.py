# Based on the riddle's clues, we determine the final order of the five numbers.
# The step-by-step logic leads to the following sequence:
final_sequence = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]

# The prompt asks to output each number in the final "equation" or sequence.
# We will print the numbers in their correct order.
print("The numbers in the correct order are:")
for number in final_sequence:
    print(number, end=' ')
print()
