        'C. Transposable elements': "These can create variation but are often considered a negative consequence of inefficient selection in low-recombination genomes.",
        'D. Multigene families': "These provide redundancy for specific sets of genes, which is a good compensatory mechanism. This is a strong candidate.",
        'E. Polyploidy': "This is the duplication of the entire genome. It provides immediate, widespread redundancy for all genes, directly masking the effect of deleterious mutations. This is a powerful, architectural solution and is strongly associated with the long-term success of asexual lineages."
