# The task is to define a safe goal for a model M when predictive success is unprovable due to uncomputability.
# The model M must be able to formulate this goal itself.
# The answer should fit the template: {_______ learning} from {_______}.

# Step 1: Define the type of learning.
# Given that predictive success cannot be proven, the model's goal should shift
# to a learning process whose safety properties *can* be proven.
# This reflects a cautious, formally-grounded approach in the face of uncertainty.
# A hyphenated term is allowed. "provably-safe learning" fits this description.
first_part = "provably-safe learning"

# Step 2: Define the source of information for learning.
# With potential distribution shifts, the most reliable source of information is the
# immediate data provided by the user.
# "user data" is a two-word term that accurately describes this source.
second_part = "user data"

# Step 3: Combine the parts to form the completed template.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" seems to be a template artifact,
# as there are no numbers or equations here.
# I will interpret it as a requirement to construct the final output programmatically
# and print the result.
safe_goal = f"{first_part} from {second_part}"
