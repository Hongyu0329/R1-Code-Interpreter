    print("   Analysis: This is logically impossible. An insect must start an interaction (3) before or at the same time it starts feeding (5). Therefore, the number of feeding events cannot be greater than the number of interaction events.")

    # Option E

    print("   Analysis: This describes an inefficient or 'hesitant' pollinator. The insect investigates many flowers but only makes contact with a few. This is not beneficial for the plant, which needs contact for pollination.")
