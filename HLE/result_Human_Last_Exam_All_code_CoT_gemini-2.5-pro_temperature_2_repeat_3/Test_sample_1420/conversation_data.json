    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Theory:** The problem asks for the specific heat scaling exponent, α, within the framework of the renormalization group, using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. This is a standard technique in the study of critical phenomena.\n\n**2. Identify Key Parameters:**\n*   **Spatial Dimension (d):** The user specifies `d = 3`.\n*   **Universality Class (n):** The properties at a critical point often depend on the symmetry of the order parameter, specified by its number of components, `n`. Since this is not specified, I will use the most common case, the Ising model, where `n = 1`.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** For this class of models (the n-vector models), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. Above this dimension, mean-field theory exponents are exact.\n*   **Epsilon (ϵ):** The epsilon expansion works with `ϵ = d_c - d` as a small parameter.\n\n**3. State the Formula:** The first-order epsilon expansion for the exponent α is given by the formula:\n`α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n\n**4. Execute the Calculation:**\n*   Calculate `ϵ = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n*   Substitute `n=1` and `ϵ=1` into the formula.\n*   The Python code will perform this substitution and print the final equation with all the numbers and the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent α using the first-order epsilon expansion.\n\n    This calculation is based on renormalization group theory for a system in a specified\n    spatial dimension near the upper critical dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Spatial dimension provided by the user\n    d = 3\n\n    # The upper critical dimension for the n-vector model (Ising, XY, Heisenberg)\n    d_c = 4\n\n    # The number of components of the order parameter.\n    # We assume the Ising universality class, where n=1.\n    n = 1\n\n    # Calculate epsilon, the small parameter in the expansion\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # Calculate the scaling exponent alpha using the first-order formula\n    alpha = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * epsilon\n\n    # Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation\n    print(f\"To find the scaling exponent α for the specific heat, we use the epsilon expansion.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is for a system with spatial dimension d={d} in the Ising universality class (n={n}).\")\n    print(f\"The upper critical dimension is d_c={d_c}, so ε = d_c - d = {epsilon}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe formula to the first order in ε is: α ≈ (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\")\n\n    # Using 'sys.stdout.write' to build the equation part-by-part on one line.\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"α ≈ ({4} - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + 8)) * {epsilon} = \")\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"{(4-n)} / (2 * {(n+8)}) * {epsilon} = \")\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"{(4-n)} / {(2*(n+8))} * {epsilon} = \")\n    print(f\"{alpha}\")\n\n\ncalculate_alpha_exponent()\n\n# The final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<0.16666666666666666>>>\")\n```"
