    "To find the radical (bushu) of the Japanese character 謄, we need to break it down into its components.\n\n1.  **Identify the character:** The character is 謄.\n2.  **Deconstruct the character:** This character is composed of two parts: 言 on the left and 滕 on the right.\n3.  **Identify the radical:** The left part, 言, serves as the semantic radical, indicating that the character's meaning is related to \"speech,\" \"words,\" or \"saying.\"\n4.  **Identify the name of the radical based on its position:** When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is known as \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n5.  **Transcribe to Hepburn:** The Hepburn transcription of ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the Hepburn transcription of the radical\n    for the Japanese character 謄.\n    \"\"\"\n    character = \"謄\"\n    radical_kanji = \"言\"\n    radical_name_japanese = \"ごんべん\"\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n\n    print(f\"The character is: {character}\")\n    print(f\"The radical is '{radical_kanji}', which is called '{radical_name_japanese}' when it appears on the left side of a character.\")\n    print(f\"The Hepburn transcription for the radical is: {radical_name_hepburn}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_radical_name()\n\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
