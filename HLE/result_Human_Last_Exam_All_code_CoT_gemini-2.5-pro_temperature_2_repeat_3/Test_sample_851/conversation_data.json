    "To solve this problem, we must carefully analyze the crystallographic conditions for optical activity, chirality, and polarity.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Key Terms**: First, I will clarify the definitions of optical activity, chirality, and polarity in the context of crystal symmetry.\n2.  **Resolve the Paradox**: The question asks for classes that are both **achiral** and **optically active**, which seems contradictory. I will explain the special case where this is possible. For a crystal to show optical activity, its gyration tensor must be non-zero. While this is always true for chiral crystals, it is also true for a select few achiral ones.\n3.  **Identify Candidate Classes**: I will identify the complete set of crystal classes that satisfy the three given conditions:\n    *   Have the correct symmetry for optical activity (non-zero gyration tensor).\n    *   Are achiral (possess a mirror plane or rotoinversion axis).\n    *   Are non-polar (do not belong to the 10 polar/pyroelectric classes).\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**: Finally, I will check each multiple-choice option against the derived list of candidate classes to find the correct answer.\n\nThis step-by-step process will be encapsulated in the Python script below, which will print the reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_symmetry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes crystallographic properties to find the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"### Step-by-Step Analysis ###\")\n\n    print(\"\\n1. Understanding the Properties:\")\n    print(\"   - Optical Activity: A material is optically active if it can rotate the plane of polarized light. This is permitted only in crystal classes that lack a center of symmetry and whose gyration tensor is non-zero.\")\n    print(\"   - Chirality: A crystal is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This means it lacks mirror planes (m) and an inversion center (i). In general, only chiral crystals are optically active.\")\n    print(\"   - Polarity: A polar crystal has a unique direction, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n2.
