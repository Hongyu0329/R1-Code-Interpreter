# Patient's lipid panel values from the serum chemistry report
total_cholesterol = 160  # mg/dL
hdl_cholesterol = 37     # mg/dL
triglycerides = 140      # mg/dL

# The Friedewald equation is used to calculate LDL cholesterol.
# It is valid when triglyceride levels are below 400 mg/dL.
# LDL = Total Cholesterol - HDL - (Triglycerides / 5)
calculated_ldl = total_cholesterol - hdl_cholesterol - (triglycerides / 5)
