The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for odd prime `q` are precisely those groups `G` for which the order of the abelianization `G/[G,G]` is 2. In terms of structure, these are the semidirect products `G = Q \rtimes_\alpha C_2` where `Q` is a group of order `q^m` and `\alpha` is an automorphism of `Q` of order 2 such that its induced action on the abelianization of `Q` ( `Q/[Q,Q]` ) is the inversion map `x \mapsto x^{-1}`.
