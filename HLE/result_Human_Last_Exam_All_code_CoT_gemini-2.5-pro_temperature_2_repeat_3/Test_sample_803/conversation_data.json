    "To find the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, we first need to understand the definition of a filled group in a way that is easy to check.\n\n### Mathematical Plan\n\n1.  **Definition of a Filled Group:** A finite group G is \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G generates G.\n2.  **A Key Theorem:** A well-known theorem in group theory states that a finite group `G` is filled if and only if it has a unique maximal normal subgroup.\n3.  **Analyze Groups of Order `2q^m`:** Let `G` be a group of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number.\n    *   By Sylow's theorems, `G` must have a normal Sylow `q`-subgroup, let's call it `Q`. The order of `Q` is `q^m`.\n    *   The index of `Q` in `G` is `|G|/|Q| = (2q^m)/q^m = 2`.\n    *   Since `Q` is a normal subgroup of index 2, it is a maximal normal subgroup.\n4.  **Condition for Uniqueness:** For `G` to be filled, `Q` must be the *only* maximal normal subgroup. This means `G` cannot have any other maximal normal subgroups. Maximal normal subgroups `M` correspond to simple quotient groups `G/M`. The possible orders of simple quotients must divide `|G|`. The prime divisors of `|G|` are 2 and `q`. So, any simple quotient of `G` must have order 2 or `q`. We already have a quotient of order 2 ( `G/Q` ). For `G` to be filled, there must be no normal subgroup `M` such that `G/M` has order `q`.\n5.  **Connection to Abelianization:** A group `G` has a normal subgroup of index `q` if and only if there is a surjective homomorphism from `G` to the cyclic group `C_q`. This is equivalent to `C_q` being a homomorphic image of the abelianization of `G`, which is `G_{ab} = G/[G,G]`. This means the order of `G_{ab}` must be divisible by `q`.\n6.  **The Final Condition:** Therefore, for `G` to be filled, the order of its abelianization, `|G_{ab}|`, must NOT be divisible by `q`.\n7.  **For Nonabelian Groups:** The problem asks for nonabelian groups. For a nonabelian group `G` of order `2q^m`, `|G_{ab}|` must divide `2q^m`. The condition that `q` does not divide `|G_{ab}|` means that `|G_{ab}|` can only be 1 or 2. Since `G` is nonabelian, `G/[G,G]` cannot be the trivial group, so `|G_{ab}|` must be 2.\n\nThis gives us a clear and computable criterion: A nonabelian group `G` of order `2q^m` is filled if and only if the order of its abelianization `G/[G,G]` is 2.\n\n### Python Implementation\n\nI will now provide a Python script that uses this criterion to find all nonabelian filled groups for given `q` and `m`. The script uses the `libgap` library, which acts as a Python interface to the GAP computer algebra system. You may need to install it first (`pip install libgap`).\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Take `q` and `m` as inputs.\n2.  Iterate through all groups `G` of order `n = 2q^m` available in GAP's `SmallGroups` library.\n3.  For each group, it checks if it is nonabelian.\n4.  It then computes the order of the abelianization `G/[G,G]`.\n5.  If this order is 2, it identifies the group as a filled group and prints its information.\n\n```python\nimport libgap\nimport sys\n\ndef find_filled_groups(q, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints all nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q**m.\n\n    A nonabelian group G of order 2*q**m (q odd prime) is filled if and only if\n    the order of its abelianization G/[G,G] is 2.\n\n    Args:\n        q (int): An odd prime number.\n        m (int): A natural number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not (q > 2 and all(q % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(q**0.5) + 1))):\n        print(f\"Error: q={q} is not an odd prime.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n    if not (m > 0 and isinstance(m, int)):\n        print(f\"Error: m={m} is not a natural number.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n        \n    n = 2 * (q ** m)\n    \n    print(f\"Searching for nonabelian filled groups of order n = 2 * {q}^{m} = {n}\")\n    \n    try:\n        num_groups = libgap.NrSmallGroups(n)\n        if num_groups == 0:\n             print(f\"The SmallGroups library in GAP does not contain groups of order {n}.\")\n             return\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not retrieve groups of order {n}.
