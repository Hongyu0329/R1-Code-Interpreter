    explanation = """
The foundation of modern cryptography, as stated by Kerckhoffs's Principle, is that the security of the system must rely solely on the secrecy of the key. The entire purpose of a key is to be the single piece of secret information that allows for decryption.

If an adversary possesses the encryption key, they have all the necessary components to reverse the encryption and read the message. Therefore, by definition, the system is no longer secure against that adversary.

Let's evaluate the choices:
- (A, D, E) Quantum Methods: These are advanced techniques for generating or securely distributing keys. They do not change the fact that if the final key is known, the system is compromised.
- (B, C) Key Management: Fast Key Rotation and Perfect Forward Secrecy are vital strategies to limit the *damage* and *scope* of a key compromise. They ensure that a compromised key is only useful for a limited time or for a specific session. However, they do not make the communication secure *during the period when the key is known*.

Conclusion: The premise of the question negates the fundamental requirement for security in encryption. It is theoretically impossible to maintain confidentiality if an adversary has complete knowledge of the encryption keys for the data they are targeting.
