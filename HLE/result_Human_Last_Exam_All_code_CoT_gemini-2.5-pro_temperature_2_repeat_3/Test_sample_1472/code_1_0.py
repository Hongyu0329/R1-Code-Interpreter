        "  - Complex: bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper means two ligands are coordinated to Cu.",

        "Step 2: Determine the Most Likely Geometry",
        "  - A 4-coordinate complex can be either tetrahedral or square planar.",
        "  - Cu(I) (d10) strongly favors tetrahedral geometry.",
        "  - The ligand forms a puckered 6-membered chelate ring (Cu-S-C2-S) and has methyl substituents, creating steric hindrance.",
        "  - This steric bulk disfavors a flat square planar geometry.",
        "  - Conclusion: The geometry is tetrahedral or distorted tetrahedral.",

        "Step 3: Identify Symmetry Elements for a Tetrahedral [Cu(L-L)2] Complex",
        "  - E (Identity): Present in all molecules.",
        "  - C2 (Principal Axis): A C2 axis passes through the Cu atom and interchanges the two identical ligands. This element IS present.",
        "  - Other C2 axes: Perpendicular C2 axes, which are required for the D2 point group, are absent because the ligand itself is not symmetric enough to be rotated onto itself by 180 degrees.",
        "  - Mirror Planes (sigma): No mirror planes (sigma_h or sigma_v) are present due to the puckered, asymmetric nature of the chelate rings and the methyl groups.",
        "  - Center of Inversion (i): Absent due to the chiral 'propeller' twist of the two ligands.",
        "  - Improper Rotation (S_n): No S_n axes are present.",
        "\n",

        "Step 4: Final Conclusion",
        "  - The only symmetry elements found are the Identity (E) and a single C2 rotation axis.",
