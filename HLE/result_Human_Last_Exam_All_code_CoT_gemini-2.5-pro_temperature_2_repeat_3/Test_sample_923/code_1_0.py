# The GDScript contains a parsing error that will be caught by the Godot IDE
# before the code is ever run.

# The error is located on this line:
# if "texture" in list(json_data):

# In GDScript for Godot 4, 'list()' is not a valid built-in function to
# convert a Dictionary's keys into an Array. The correct syntax would be to use
# the `.keys()` method, like so: `if "texture" in json_data.keys():`.

# Because 'list' is not a defined function or a declared variable in the script's
# scope, the parser will raise an error indicating it doesn't know what 'list' is.

# The following code prints the exact error message.

error_message = "The identifier \"list\" isn't declared in the current scope."

print(error_message)
