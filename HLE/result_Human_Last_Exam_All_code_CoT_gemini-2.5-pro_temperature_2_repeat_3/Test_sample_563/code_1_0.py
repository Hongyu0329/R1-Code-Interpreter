def solve_automorphism_groups():
    """
    This function provides the number of isomorphism classes of automorphism groups
    for compact, connected Riemann surfaces of genus g = 2, 3, and 4.

    The values are based on established results from the mathematical literature
    on algebraic geometry and group actions on surfaces.

    - For genus g=2, there are 6 possible groups. The trivial group does not occur.
    - For genus g=3, there are 15 non-trivial groups plus the trivial group, making 16.
    - For genus g=4, recent classifications show 22 non-trivial groups plus the trivial group, making 23.
