    Analyzes the provided options to determine the necessary assumption for the expected information gain to converge to zero.

    The key insight is that the total expected information gain is bounded by the entropy of the prior distribution.
    Let I_t be the expected information gain at time t.
    Let H_t be the entropy of the posterior at time t.
    We have I_t = E[H_t - H_{t+1}].
    The total expected information gain is Sum(E[I_t]) for t=0 to infinity.
    This sum is equal to H_0 - E[H_infinity], where H_0 is the prior entropy.
    Since entropy is non-negative, the sum is bounded by H_0.
    For the sum of non-negative terms (the information gains) to be finite, the individual terms must approach zero.
    This entire argument hinges on the sum being finite, which requires the upper bound, H_0, to be finite.
    Therefore, the prior must have finite entropy (a).

    The other options are sufficient under certain conditions but not necessary for the general result:
    - (b), (c): relate to identifying the true model, a stronger condition.
    - (d): i.i.d. assumption is not required for the entropy-based proof.
    - (e): posterior entropy approaching zero is a stronger outcome than required.

    The final answer is 'a'. We format this in Conjunctive Normal Form as required.
    A single proposition 'a' becomes the clause '(a)'.
    The conjunction of a single clause is represented as '[(a)]'.

    # The chosen option is 'a'.
