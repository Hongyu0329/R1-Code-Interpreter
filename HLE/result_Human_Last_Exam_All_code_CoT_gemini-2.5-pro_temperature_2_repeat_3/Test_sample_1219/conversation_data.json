    "To find the first 3 digits after the decimal point of tan(10^100), we need to perform calculations with very high precision. Here is the plan:\n\n1.  **Use High-Precision Arithmetic**: The number `10^100` (a 1 followed by 100 zeros) is too large for standard floating-point data types. We must use a library capable of arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Python's `mpmath` library is well-suited for this kind of scientific computation.\n2.  **Leverage Periodicity**: The tangent function has a period of π, meaning `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. `mpmath` can handle this reduction of the large argument automatically and accurately, provided we set enough precision.\n3.  **Set Sufficient Precision**: To calculate `10^100 mod π`, the precision must be high enough to represent `10^100` without losing the crucial digits of the remainder. `10^100` has 101 digits. To ensure accuracy for the remainder and the subsequent `tan` calculation, we'll set the precision to 115 decimal places, which provides a safe margin.\n4.  **Extract the Digits**: After calculating `tan(10^100)`, the result will be a high-precision number. We can convert this number to a string and then slice the string to extract the first three digits that appear after the decimal point.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\ndef find_tan_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first 3 digits after the decimal point of tan(10^100).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the precision (dps = decimal places) for the calculation.\n    # The argument 10^100 is very large. To compute tan(x) for a large x,\n    # we need to find x mod pi with high accuracy. The number of digits in\n    # 10^100 is 101, so we need a precision greater than that.\n    # We use 115 as a safe value.\n    mpmath.mp.dps = 115\n\n    # Define the number for the tan function argument\n    base = 10\n    exponent = 100\n    argument = mpmath.power(base, exponent)\n\n    # Calculate tan(10^100). The mpmath library handles the large argument\n    # by correctly reducing it modulo pi.\n    result = mpmath.tan(argument)\n\n    # Convert the high-precision result to a string to easily access the digits.\n    # We format it to have a sufficient number of digits shown.\n    result_str = mpmath.nstr(result, 10)\n\n    # The result is approximately -1.376...\n    # We locate the decimal point in the string representation.\n    decimal_point_index = result_str.find('.')\n\n    # We extract the three characters immediately following the decimal point.\n    # This gives us the first three digits after the comma.\n    first_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n\n    # The \"final equation\" is tan(10^100) = -1.376... The required numbers are the\n    # three digits '3', '7', and '6'. We will print them as a single string.\n    print(first_three_digits)\n\nfind_tan_digits()\n\n```\n<<<376>>>"
