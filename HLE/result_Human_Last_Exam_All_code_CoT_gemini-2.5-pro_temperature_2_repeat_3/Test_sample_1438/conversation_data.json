    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the quantum fields are represented by anticommuting numbers known as Grassmann variables. The core property that distinguishes these from ordinary numbers and directly encodes the Pauli exclusion principle is their nilpotency: for any Grassmann variable `η`, its square is identically zero (`η² = 0`). This mathematical rule prevents any state from being doubly occupied.\n\nThe integration over these variables, called Berezin integration, is defined by a measure `dη` whose properties are encapsulated by two fundamental rules:\n\n1.  The integral of a constant is zero: `∫ dη = 0`. This means the \"volume\" of the integration space for an empty state component is zero.\n2.  The normalization of the measure is one: `∫ η dη = 1`. This defines the integral over an occupied state component to be unity.\n\nThese two rules, combined with the nilpotency `η² = 0`, define the integration measure. The crucial value that provides the normalization for a fermion occupying a state is **1**.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates these defining rules. It simulates a Berezin integral to show how these principles are applied. The code will print out the fundamental equations that define the measure.\n\n```python\ndef simulate_berezin_integral(integrand):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the result of a Berezin integral for a single\n    Grassmann variable η, based on its defining rules.\n\n    Args:\n        integrand (str): A string representing the function to be integrated.\n                         Supported values are \"1\", \"η\", and \"η^2\".\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The result of the symbolic integral.\n    \"\"\"\n    if integrand == \"1\":\n        # The integral of a constant over a Grassmann variable is 0.\n        return 0\n    elif integrand == \"η\":\n        # The integral of the variable itself is 1 by definition (normalization).\n        return 1\n    elif integrand == \"η^2\":\n        # This case demonstrates the Pauli exclusion principle.\n        # Since η^2 = 0 for any Grassmann variable, the integrand is 0.\n        return 0\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"This simulation only supports integrands '1', 'η', and 'η^2'.\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the fundamental rules of Grassmann integration, which encode the\n    Pauli exclusion principle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The Berezin integration measure 'dη' for a Grassmann variable 'η' is defined by rules that uphold the Pauli exclusion principle (η^2 = 0).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Rule 1: Integral of a constant (unoccupied state component)\n    integrand_1 = \"1\"\n    result_1 = simulate_berezin_integral(integrand_1)\n    # The equation contains the numbers 1 and 0.\n    print(f\"Rule 1: The integral over a constant term is zero.\")\n    print(f\"   ∫ dη ⋅ {integrand_1} = {result_1}\\n\")\n\n    # Rule 2: Normalization (occupied state component)\n    integrand_2 = \"η\"\n    result_2 = simulate_berezin_integral(integrand_2)\n    # The equation contains the number 1.\n    print(f\"Rule 2: The normalization for the integral is one.\")\n    print(f\"   ∫ dη ⋅ {integrand_2} = {result_2}\\n\")\n\n    # Consequence of the rules and nilpotency (Pauli principle)\n    integrand_3 = \"η^2\"\n    result_3 = simulate_berezin_integral(integrand_3)\n    # The equation contains the numbers 2 and 0.\n    print(\"Demonstration of the Pauli exclusion principle:\")\n    print(f\"   The integral of a doubly-occupied state component (η^2) is zero.\")\n    print(f\"   ∫ dη ⋅ {integrand_3} = {result_3}   (because {integrand_3} itself is {result_3})\\n\")\n    print(f\"The value from Rule 2 ({result_2}) is the essential normalization of the measure for an occupied state.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
