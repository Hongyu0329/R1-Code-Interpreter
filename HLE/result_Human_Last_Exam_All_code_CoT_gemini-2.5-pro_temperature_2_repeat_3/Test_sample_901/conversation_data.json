    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve this organic chemistry problem, followed by the Python code to display the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reactants**:\n    *   **Substrate**: `(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane`. This is a cyclohexane ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2. The (1S, 2R) configuration indicates they are *trans* to each other.\n    *   **Reagent**: `Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK)` in tert-butyl alcohol. This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n\n2.  **Determine Reaction Type**: A secondary alkyl halide reacting with a strong base strongly favors an elimination reaction. Due to the strong base, the mechanism will be E2 (bimolecular elimination).\n\n3.  **Apply E2 Mechanism Rules**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Br) and the beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in an **anti-periplanar** position. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement (both the leaving group and the hydrogen must be in axial positions, pointing in opposite directions).\n\n4.  **Draw and Analyze Chair Conformations**: We need to examine the two possible chair conformations for *trans*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n    *   **Conformation A (more stable)**: The bulky methyl group occupies an equatorial position to minimize steric strain. Since the substituents are trans, the bromine atom must also be in an equatorial position. E2 elimination *cannot* occur from this conformation because the leaving group (Br) is not axial.\n    *   **Conformation B (less stable)**: The ring can flip to this conformation. Here, the methyl group is axial, and the bromine atom is also axial. Although this conformation is less stable, it is the only one from which the E2 reaction can proceed because the bromine is now in the required axial position.\n\n5.  **Identify Beta-Hydrogens for Elimination**: With the bromine atom axial in Conformation B, we look for axial hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **Hydrogen on C2**: The methyl group on C2 is axial. This means the hydrogen on C2 is equatorial. It is *not* anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, a double bond cannot form between C1 and C2 (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   **Hydrogen on C6**: The C6 carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 *is* anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) to the axial bromine on C1.\n\n6.  **Predict the Product**: Elimination must occur by removing the axial hydrogen from C6. This forms a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group remains on its carbon (C2 relative to the original numbering). When naming the resulting alkene, the double bond gets priority (C1 and C2), so the methyl group is on position 3.\n\n7.  **Final Product Name**: The product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. The stereochemistry of the starting material forces the reaction to yield this specific regioisomer, even though it's the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product).\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the product of the given elimination reaction.\n\n# Reactants:\n# Substrate: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n# Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)\n\n# Reaction type: E2 elimination\n\n# Analysis:\n# The E2 mechanism on a cyclohexane ring requires the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton\n# to be in a trans-diaxial (anti-periplanar) orientation.\n\n# 1. The starting molecule is a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane.\n# 2. To have the Br in an axial position (which is necessary for the reaction),\n#    the chair conformation must have both the Br and the methyl group in axial positions.\n# 3. We look for beta-protons that are also axial.\n#    - At C2: The methyl group is axial, so the H is equatorial. No elimination possible here.\n#    - At C6: There is an axial H available.\n# 4. Therefore, elimination must happen between C1 and C6.\n# 5. This forms a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group is at the adjacent\n#    carbon (position 3 of the new alkene).\n\n# Naming the final product:\nproduct_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n\nprint(f\"The name of the product is: {product_name}\")\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
