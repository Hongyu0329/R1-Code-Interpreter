# This script identifies the product of the given elimination reaction.

# Reactants:
# Substrate: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane
# Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)

# Reaction type: E2 elimination

# Analysis:
# The E2 mechanism on a cyclohexane ring requires the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton
# to be in a trans-diaxial (anti-periplanar) orientation.

# 1. The starting molecule is a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane.
# 2. To have the Br in an axial position (which is necessary for the reaction),
#    the chair conformation must have both the Br and the methyl group in axial positions.
# 3. We look for beta-protons that are also axial.
#    - At C2: The methyl group is axial, so the H is equatorial. No elimination possible here.
#    - At C6: There is an axial H available.
# 4. Therefore, elimination must happen between C1 and C6.
# 5. This forms a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group is at the adjacent
#    carbon (position 3 of the new alkene).

# Naming the final product:
product_name = "3-methylcyclohexene"
