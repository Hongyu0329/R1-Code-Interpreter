    "To answer this question, I will need to find the specific anatomical details of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*. My plan is to:\n1.  Consult paleontological research papers and scientific descriptions of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull (specimen SMNS 58022).\n2.  Locate the description of the lacrimal bone, specifically the feature known as the lacrimal recess.\n3.  Identify the number of depressions described for this feature.\n4.  Write a Python script that stores this number in a variable and prints the answer in a clear, descriptive sentence, including the number itself.\n\nBased on the scientific literature, specifically the paper \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Sues et al. (2002), the lacrimal recess is described as a single, large, triangular depression (fossa) on the side of the lacrimal bone. Therefore, there is one such depression.\n\nHere is the Python code to present this answer.\n\n```python\n# Scientific fact: The number of lacrimal recesses in Irritator challengeri.\n# A lacrimal recess is itself a depression or fossa.\n# According to Sues et al. (2002), this is a single, large feature.\n\nnumber_of_lacrimal_recess_depressions = 1\ndinosaur = \"Irritator challengeri\"\n\n# Print the final answer formatted as a sentence.\n# The \"equation\" is the assignment of our finding to the variable.\nprint(f\"Based on the scientific description of {dinosaur}, the number of depressions forming the lacrimal recess is {number_of_lacrimal_recess_depressions}.\")\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
