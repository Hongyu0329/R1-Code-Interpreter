# The group G is of type E8.

# Step 1: Define the properties of the E8 root system.
# The dimension of the group G (or its Lie algebra) is 248.
dim_G = 248
# The rank of the group G is 8.
rank_G = 8

# Step 2: Calculate the total number of roots.
# The number of roots |Î¦| is the dimension of the group minus its rank.
num_roots = dim_G - rank_G

# Step 3: Calculate the number of positive roots (N).
# The number of positive roots is half the total number of roots.
num_positive_roots = num_roots // 2

# Step 4: Calculate the exponent for the final formula.
# The number of rational maximal tori is q^(2N).
exponent = 2 * num_positive_roots

# Step 5: Print the final result and the steps of the calculation.
