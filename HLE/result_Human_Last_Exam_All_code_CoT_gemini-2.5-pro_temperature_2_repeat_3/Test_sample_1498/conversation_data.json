    "To answer this question, I will identify the specific section within the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam that enumerates the names of the prophets.\n\n1.  **Locate the Poem:** First, I will reference the text of 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi.\n2.  **Find the Relevant Section:** I will scan the poem for the section on prophethood. Poems of this nature typically follow a theological order: belief in God, His angels, His books, and His messengers.\n3.  **Identify the Starting Verse:** I will look for the first verse (bayt) that begins listing the names of the prophets. This verse is \"هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسٌ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\" (They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed), which is verse number 34.\n4.  **Identify the Ending Verse:** I will continue reading until the list of twenty-five prophets is complete. The list concludes with the verse \"إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\" (Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, ‘Isa and Taha [a name for Prophet Muhammad], the seal; so leave misguidance), which is verse number 37.\n5.  **Code the Output:** Finally, I will write a Python script that declares these two verse numbers and prints them in a clear, informative sentence.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the range of verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam\n# that list the names of the prophets.\n\n# Verse where the enumeration of prophets begins.\nstart_bayt = 34\n\n# Verse where the enumeration of prophets ends.\nend_bayt = 37\n\n# Print the result in a full sentence, including the start and end numbers.\nprint(f\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets are mentioned from Bayt {start_bayt} to Bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n```\n<<<In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets are mentioned from Bayt 34 to Bayt 37.>>>"
