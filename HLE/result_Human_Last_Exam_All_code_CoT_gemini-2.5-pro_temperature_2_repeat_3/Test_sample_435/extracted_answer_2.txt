Given its role in promoting T cell survival, persistence, and a less exhausted phenotype, interleukin-15 would be predicted to **increase** the magnitude and sustainability of cytokine release (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α) from CAR T cells upon antigen stimulation when compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15.
