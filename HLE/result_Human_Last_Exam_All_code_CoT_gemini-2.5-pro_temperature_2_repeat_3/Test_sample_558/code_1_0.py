    This function solves a multi-part opera history riddle.
    
    1.  The Opera: The clues point to Gaetano Donizetti's "La Favorita".
        -   Marietta Alboni sang the title role, Leonora, at La Scala in 1843.
        -   Enrico Caruso sang the role of Fernando at the Met until 1905.
    
    2.  The Production: We need a NYC production "more than 70 years" after 1905.
        -   Calculation: 1905 + 70 = 1975.
        -   This refers to the Opera Orchestra of New York's concert performance in April 1975.
        
    3.  The Singer: We need the bass singer from that production.
        -   The principal bass role in "La Favorita" is Baldassarre.
        -   In the 1975 performance, this role was sung by James Morris.
