def find_mutualists():
    """
    Identifies the indices of organisms that are mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis.

    Mutualists are organisms that engage in a mutually beneficial relationship.
    In this case, they are pollinators or defenders of the plant.
    - Adult butterflies, bees, and wasps are pollinators (indices 1, 2, 4, 5, 6).
    - Ants can be defenders, feeding on extrafloral nectaries and protecting the plant (index 3).
    - Larvae are either herbivores (antagonists) or do not interact with the plant (not mutualists).
