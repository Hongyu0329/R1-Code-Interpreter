    Analyzes ballet school techniques to answer the multiple-choice question.

    The question asks to identify which pair of ballet institutions uses an

    """

    # Step 1: Define characteristics of the pirouette preparation in question.
    preparation_style = "Arms in an allongé (stretched) position for pirouette prep from fourth."

    # Step 2: Analyze the style of each school.
    school_analysis = {
        "Paris Opera Ballet School (French)": "Emphasizes elegant, elongated lines and dynamic opposition. The preparation involves a stretch through the back and arms that gives it an 'allongé' quality.",
        "The Royal Ballet School (English)": "A hybrid style that often uses more contained and rounded arm positions, influenced by Cecchetti and French schools, but generally less expansive.",
        "School of American Ballet (Balanchine)": "Famous for its open, expansive, and fast technique. The pirouette prep from fourth is distinctly 'allongé,' with arms often stretched wide to the sides.",
        "La Scala (Italian/Cecchetti)": "Follows the codified Cecchetti method, which uses precise and generally rounded arm positions for pirouette preparations.",
        "Vaganova Academy (Russian)": "Uses a highly codified preparation from fourth position with specifically rounded arms (one in front, one to the side) creating a 'gate.' Not 'allongé'."
    }

    # Step 3: Evaluate the pairs based on the analysis.
    # We are looking for a pair where both schools fit the 'allongé' description.

    # The School of American Ballet is a clear fit.
    # Comparing its potential partners:
    # - The Paris Opera Ballet School's emphasis on long, expressive lines also fits the description.
    # - The Royal Ballet School's style is generally more contained and rounded.

    # Therefore, the most accurate pair is the Paris Opera Ballet School and the School of American Ballet.
    correct_choice = "B"
    explanation = f"""
The analysis of ballet techniques reveals the following:

1.  School of American Ballet (SAB): The Balanchine style taught at SAB is renowned for its dynamic and expansive movements. The preparation for a pirouette from the fourth position characteristically involves open, stretched arms to the sides, which perfectly fits the 'allongé' description.

2.  Paris Opera Ballet School (POB): The French school emphasizes elegance and long, expressive lines. While the arms may have some curvature, the preparation for pirouettes involves a strong sense of opposition and an elongated stretch through the upper body and arms, distinguishing it from the more codified rounded positions of the Vaganova or Cecchetti methods. This gives the preparation its 'allongé' quality.

In contrast, the Vaganova, Royal Ballet, and La Scala schools typically utilize more contained and clearly rounded arm positions for their standard pirouette preparations.

Conclusion: The pair that best fits the description is the Paris Opera Ballet School and the School of American Ballet.
