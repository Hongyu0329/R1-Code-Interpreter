    print("A. Al1/Al2 are allosteric modulators. Rga1 is reversible inhibitor. Mg is a cofactor.")

    print("B. CaCl2 and MgCl2 are cofactors, CuCl2 is not a cofactor.")
    print(f"   - Assessment: Incorrect. CaCl2 had no effect (kcat {data['CaCl2']}/s), so it is not a cofactor.\n")

    print("C. Al1 and Al2 are allosteric modulators for Zma1. They bind to the same site. Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor.")
    print(f"   - Assessment: Correct. Al1 activates (kcat {data['Al1']}/s) and Al2 inhibits (kcat {data['Al2']}/s). With both present, the result is inhibition (kcat {data['Al1+Al2']}/s), supporting same-site binding. Rga1's inhibition is not reversed by substrate, consistent with an irreversible inhibitor.\n")

    print(f"   - Assessment: Incorrect. XAG1 inhibition was reversed by substrate (kcat increased from {data['XAG1']} to {data['XAG1_high_substrate']}), so it is a reversible inhibitor.\n")

    print(f"   - Assessment: Incorrect. CaCl2 is not a cofactor and CuCl2 (kcat {data['CuCl2']}/s) is an inhibitor.\n")

    print("G. Al1 and Al2 are allosteric activators and they binds to different sites on Al1.")
