    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the integer `n` and then the Python code to perform the final calculation.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Goal:** Determine the value of `log_2(n)`, where `n` is the integer represented by the given SKI combinator expression.\n\n2.  **Strategy:** The most effective way to solve this is to first understand the structure of the SKI expression by translating it into the more readable lambda calculus, and then determine what function it represents. A Church integer `n` is a function that takes two arguments, `f` and `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times: `n = λf.λx. fⁿ(x)`. Our goal is to reduce the given expression to this form.\n\n3.  **Parsing the SKI Expression:**\n    Let the given expression be `E`. The notation `X(Y)` means function application, so we parse from left to right.\n    `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))(B)))`\n    where `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` and `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`.\n\n    The structure of `E` can be seen as nested applications involving the `S(I)` combinator. Let's analyze the term `S(I)(Y)`. When applied to an argument `f`, it reduces as follows:\n    `(S I Y) f = I f (Y f) = f (Y f)`\n\n    By applying this rule repeatedly to `E`, we can determine how it behaves when it receives its first argument `f`:\n    *   Let `Z = S(I)(K(A))(B)`. The expression for Z is `((S I)(K A)) B`. This reduces: `((S I)(K A)) B = I B ((K A) B) = B(K A B) = B(A)`.\n    *   Let `Y = S(I)(Z)`. When `Y` is applied to `f`, we get: `Y f = f(Z f) = f((B A)f)`.\n    *   Our full expression is `E = S(I)(Y)`. When `E` is applied to `f`, we get: `E f = f(Y f) = f(f((B A)f))`.\n\n4.  **Connecting to Church Numerals:**\n    Since `E` is the Church integer `n`, we know `n f x = (E f) x`. From our parsing:\n    `n f x = (f(f((B A)f))) x`\n    Function application is left-associative, so this becomes:\n    `n f x = f(f( ((B A)f) x ))`\n\n    This means we must now find the function represented by `((B A)f)`.\n\n5.  **Evaluating `A` and `B`:**\n    *   The term `S(S(K S)K)` is the standard combinator for the successor function, `succ`.\n    *   `A = succ(I)`. The `I` combinator is Church numeral 1. Thus, `A = succ(1) = 2`. So, `A` is the Church numeral 2, which is `C₂ = λg.λy. g(g y)`.\n    *   `B = succ(S(I)(I))`. The term `S(I)(I)` is the self-application combinator `ω = λx. x x`. Thus, `B = succ(ω)`. In lambda calculus: `B = λf.λx. f((ω f)x) = λf.λx. f((f f)x)`.\n\n6.  **Evaluating `(B A)`:**\n    Now we evaluate `k = B A`, which means applying `B` to `A`.\n    `k = B A = (λf.λx. f((f f)x)) C₂ = λx. C₂( (C₂ C₂) x )`\n    To find what Church numeral `k` is, we see how `(k f)` acts on `x`.\n    `(k f) = C₂( (C₂ C₂) f ) = C₂(C₂(C₂ f))`. Let's evaluate this:\n    *   The Church numeral `C₂` applied to a function `g` yields the composition `g ∘ g`.\n    *   Let `g₀ = f`.\n    *   `g₁ = C₂(f) = f ∘ f = f²`\n    *   `g₂ = C₂(g₁) = C₂(f²) = f² ∘ f² = f⁴`\n    *   `g₃ = C₂(g₂) = C₂(f⁴) = f⁴ ∘ f⁴ = f⁸`\n    So, `(k f) = g₃ = f⁸`. This means `k = (B A)` is the Church numeral 8 (`C₈`).\n\n7.  **Final Calculation of n:**\n    We substitute our result for `k` back into the expression for `n`:\n    `n f x = f( f( (k f) x ) ) = f( f( (f⁸) x ) )`\n    `n f x = f( f⁹(x) ) = f¹⁰(x)`\n    Therefore, the SKI expression `E` represents the Church numeral `n = 10`.\n\n8.  **Answering the User's Question:**\n    The final step is to calculate `log₂(n)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Based on the step-by-step derivation, the Church integer 'n' represented by the complex\n# SKI combinator expression simplifies to 10.\nn = 10\n\n# The problem asks for the value of log_2(n).\nresult = math.log2(n)\n\n# The final equation is log_2(10).\nprint(\"The integer n is:\", 10)\nprint(\"The final equation is: log_2(10)\")\nprint(\"The result is:\", result)\n\n```\n<<<3.3219280948873626>>>"
