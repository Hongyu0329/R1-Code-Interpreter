    "My analysis of ballet school training methodologies indicates that one particular school is uniquely known for its practice of having dancers train at the barre extensively in pointe shoes. This is a core tenet of the Balanchine method, which aims to integrate pointe work into the dancer's foundational technique from the very beginning to develop the necessary strength, speed, and articulation.
