    The question is: Does there exist a program P that computes def_superfast(10000)?

    The answer is NO. The function def_superfast(n) is a variant of the Busy Beaver function, which is a well-known uncomputable function. Here is a step-by-step explanation of why.

    Step 1: Understanding `def_superfast(10000)`
    -------------------------------------------
    The function definition requires us to perform these steps:
    1. Consider the set of all possible Python programs with source code length less than 10000 symbols.
    2. From this set, identify every program that is guaranteed to halt and return an integer.
    3. Find the single largest integer returned by any of these programs. Let's call it `Huge_int`.
    4. The function must return `Huge_int + 1`.

    Step 2: The Core Problem - The Halting Problem
    ----------------------------------------------
    Step 1.2 above, identifying all programs that halt, requires solving what is known as the Halting Problem. In 1936, Alan Turing proved that it is impossible to create a single, general-purpose program that can analyze any other program and determine with certainty whether it will halt or run forever.

    Since this crucial step of filtering for halting programs is impossible, the entire function `def_superfast` is uncomputable.

    Step 3: A Proof by Contradiction
    --------------------------------
    We can also prove this with a self-referential paradox.

    1. ASSUME for a moment that a program `P` to compute `def_superfast(n)` actually exists.

    2. We could then CONSTRUCT a new program, let's call it `Paradox.py`, based on `P`. `Paradox.py` would do the following:
       a. Determine its own source code length, let's call it `L`.
       b. Use the hypothetical program `P` to compute `def_superfast(L + 1)`.
       c. Print the result.

    3. Let's ANALYZE `Paradox.py`:
       - Its length is `L`.
       - The value it prints is, by the definition of the function, `Huge_int(L + 1) + 1`.
       - This means `Paradox.py` is a program of length `L` that halts and returns an integer.

    4. This leads to a CONTRADICTION:
       - Since `Paradox.py` has a length of `L`, and `L` is less than `L + 1`, `Paradox.py` is one of the programs that must be analyzed when computing `def_superfast(L + 1)`.
       - `Huge_int(L + 1)` is defined as the LARGEST integer returned by any program with length less than `L + 1`.
       - Therefore, the output of `Paradox.py` must, by definition, be less than or equal to `Huge_int(L + 1)`.
       - This gives us the following impossible equation, where we output each number:

         The output of Paradox.py is `Huge_int(L + 1) + 1`.
         This output must be `<=` `Huge_int(L + 1)`.
         So, `Huge_int(L + 1) + 1 <= Huge_int(L + 1)`.

       This equation is a logical contradiction, as a number can never be smaller than itself plus 1.

    Step 4: Conclusion
    ------------------
    The initial assumption that a program `P` could exist to compute `def_superfast(n)` leads directly to a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption must be false. No such program P can exist.
