    This function determines and returns the IUPAC name of the reaction product.

    The reaction is between methyl phenyl sulfoxide, triflic anhydride, and trimethylsilyl cyanide.
    This is a Pummerer reaction.
    1.  Reactants:
        - Methyl phenyl sulfoxide (Ph-S(=O)-Me)
        - Triflic anhydride ((CF3SO2)2O)
        - Trimethylsilyl cyanide (Me3SiCN)
    2.  The sulfoxide is activated by triflic anhydride.
    3.  A thionium ion intermediate [Ph-S=CH2]+ is formed.
    4.  Cyanide from Me3SiCN attacks the electrophilic carbon.
    5.  Product: Ph-S-CH2-CN
    6.  IUPAC Name:
        - Parent: -CH2-CN -> Acetonitrile
        - Substituent: Ph-S- -> Phenylthio
        - Position: The phenylthio group is on carbon 2 (nitrile C is 1).
        - Full Name: 2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile
