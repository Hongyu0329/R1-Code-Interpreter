    "Of course. This is a historical trivia question. My plan is to store the names of the two Nobel laureates in variables within a Python script and then print them out in a formatted string.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify two Nobel laureates featured in a 2000 Enron commercial.\n# The answer can be found through a search of historical advertising campaigns.\n# The two individuals are Paul Krugman and Merton Miller.\n# I will store their names in variables and print them.\n\nlaureate_1 = \"Paul Krugman\"\nlaureate_2 = \"Merton Miller\"\n\nprint(f\"The two Nobel laureates (one future, one current at the time) featured in the 2000 Enron commercial were {laureate_1} and {laureate_2}.\")\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
