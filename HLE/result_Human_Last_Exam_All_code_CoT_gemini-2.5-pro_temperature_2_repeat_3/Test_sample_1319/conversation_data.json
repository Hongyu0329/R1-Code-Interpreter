    "My plan is to identify the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad*, other than Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  **Identify Mountains:** I will compile a list of prominent historical mountains that are explicitly mentioned in the *Iliad*. This list includes Mount Olympus, Mount Ida (near Troy), Mount Athos, Mount Samothrace, Mount Pelion, and Mount Ossa.\n2.  **Find Elevations:** I will look up the current-day summit elevations for each of these mountains.\n3.  **Exclude Olympus:** As per the user's request, Mount Olympus (2918m), the highest, will be excluded from the final comparison.\n4.  **Compare and Code:** I will write a Python script to store the mountains and their elevations. The script will programmatically remove Mount Olympus, identify the highest peak among the remainder, and then print the result. To fulfill the requirement of showing the numbers in an equation, the script will also print a string comparing the heights of all the considered mountains in descending order.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_iliad_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus.\n    It stores the mountains and their elevations, finds the tallest among them (excluding Olympus),\n    and prints the result along with a comparison.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of mountains mentioned in the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Olympus\": 2918,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ossa\": 1978,\n        \"Mount Ida (Turkey)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611,\n    }\n\n    # Remove Mount Olympus for the comparison\n    relevant_mountains = mountains.copy()\n    if \"Mount Olympus\" in relevant_mountains:\n        del relevant_mountains[\"Mount Olympus\"]\n\n    # Find the tallest mountain in the remaining list\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(relevant_mountains, key=relevant_mountains.get)\n    \n    # Sort the mountains by height for the final equation\n    sorted_mountains = sorted(relevant_mountains.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    print(f\"After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is: {tallest_mountain_name}\\n\")\n    print(\"Here is the equation comparing the mountain heights:\")\n\n    # Build and print the comparison string, showing each number\n    equation_parts = []\n    for name, height in sorted_mountains:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{name} ({height}m)\")\n    \n    final_equation = \" > \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(final_equation)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_tallest_iliad_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
