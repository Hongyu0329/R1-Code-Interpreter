# The user is asking for the Chinese character that matches the riddle's description.
# The plan is to map each part of the riddle to a character component and then combine them.

# 1. "A wooden stick" and "a ladder placed in the center" both describe the character '木' (mù),
#    which means wood/tree and is visually similar to a ladder.
central_component_desc = "A wooden stick / a ladder in the center -> 木"

# 2. "hanging a square box" describes the enclosure radical '囗' (wéi).
outer_component_desc = "A square box -> 囗"

# 3. Combining these components by placing '木' inside '囗' creates the character '困'.
final_character = "困"
final_character_meaning = "kùn (meaning: trapped, surrounded, sleepy)"
