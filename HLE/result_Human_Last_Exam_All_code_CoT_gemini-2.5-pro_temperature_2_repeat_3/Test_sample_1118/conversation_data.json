    "My plan is to identify the specific self-portrait Curt Querner painted in 1933 after his brief arrest by the Gestapo. I will then determine the object he is depicted holding and research its symbolic meaning within that historical context. Finally, I will present this information through a simple Python script that prints the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbolic_object():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the object Curt Querner holds\n    in his 1933 self-portrait as a symbol of resistance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The painting is titled \"Self-Portrait with Nettle\" (\"Selbstbildnis mit Distel\").\n    # After his release from Gestapo custody, Querner painted himself holding this object.\n    object_held = \"a nettle plant\"\n\n    # The nettle, a resilient and prickly plant, is interpreted as a symbol of\n    # defiance, fortitude, and resistance against the oppressive Nazi regime.\n    explanation = (\n        \"In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after escaping the Gestapo, \"\n        f\"Curt Querner holds {object_held} as a symbol of resistance.\"\n    )\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_symbolic_object()\n```\n<<<a nettle plant>>>"
