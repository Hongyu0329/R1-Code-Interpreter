    print("The reaction is between an endohedral fullerene, Ce2@C80, and a disilirane.")
    print("This is a known type of reaction called an exohedral functionalization. The disilirane adds to the OUTSIDE of the C80 carbon cage.")
    print("This means the disilirane itself does not directly bond to the cerium atoms inside.")
    print("\nStep 2: Considering the effect on the internal structure.")
    print("The addition of the bulky silyl group to the outside of the cage changes the cage's electronic structure and geometry.")
    print("This creates a new electrostatic potential map on the INNER surface of the fullerene cage.")
    print("\nStep 3: Determining the final position of the Cerium atoms.")
    print("Before the reaction, the two cerium atoms move freely inside the cage.")
    print("After the reaction, the altered internal potential surface is no longer uniform. The cerium atoms, being positively charged, are attracted to specific locations to minimize energy.")
    print("The addition of the group creates a unique axis. The two cerium atoms align themselves along this new axis at opposite ends of the cage.")
    print("These positions are described as the 'poles' of the fullerene, relative to the site of the functionalization.")
    print("\nConclusion: The free motion of the cerium atoms is halted, and they are fixed into a linear arrangement at the poles.")
