    "The theologian who developed a specialized framework and terminology to account for changes in the natural order, applicable to both singular miracles like the virgin birth and systemic shifts like the effects of the Fall, was Augustine of Hippo.\n\nHis key concept was that of **\"seminal reasons\"** (in Latin, *rationes seminales*) or \"latent causes.\" Augustine's plan can be understood in these steps:\n\n1.  **God's Initial Creation:** Augustine argued that at the moment of creation, God embedded the potential for *everything* that would ever exist into the world in a latent state, like seeds planted in the ground. These are the \"seminal reasons.\"\n2.  **Natural Law as Normal Operation:** The regular, predictable functioning of the universe—what we call the laws of nature—is simply the unfolding of these seminal reasons in their ordinary course.\n3.  **Miracles as Activation of Latent Potential:** A miracle, such as the virgin birth, is not a violation of nature. Instead, it is God directly activating a special seminal reason that He had placed in creation from the beginning. The potential for a virgin birth was woven into the fabric of reality, to be brought forth at the appointed time.\n4.  **The Fall as Corruption:** The changes to the natural world after the Fall (e.g., the introduction of death, pain in childbirth, and agricultural toil) can be seen as a corruption of the created order. The original good \"seminal reasons\" were damaged or began to manifest in corrupted ways due to sin's entry into the world.\n\nThis powerful framework allowed Augustine to describe both unique miraculous events and lasting alterations to the natural world without suggesting that God was contradicting Himself or violating a system He could no longer control.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Christian theologian who developed specialized terminology\n    for changes in the laws of nature applicable to the virgin birth and the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    print(theologian)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
