    Analyzes the factors affecting friction in superlubric systems to determine the correct answer.
    """
    # The core principle of structural superlubricity is that friction is heavily
    # dependent on the registry, or alignment, of the contacting atomic surfaces.
    # When the surfaces are incommensurate (their atomic lattices do not align well),
    # the potential energy landscape is very smooth, resulting in ultra-low friction.
    # When the surfaces are commensurate (aligned), the atoms can "lock" into place,
    # leading to high friction. This effect is known as commensurability.
    
    # The normal load, which is the force pressing the two surfaces together, also
    # plays a crucial role. A higher normal load increases the interaction between
    # the surfaces, generally leading to an increase in frictional force, even in
    # a superlubric state.

    # Therefore, the combination of normal load and the alignment of atomic structures
    # are the primary factors that determine and control the frictional response.

    # Let's confirm this by checking the options:
    # A. Incorrect. Friction is largely independent of macroscopic contact area.
    # C. Incorrect. While velocity and temperature are influential, they are not the primary determinants of the superlubric state itself compared to atomic structure.
    # D. Incorrect. The claim that friction decreases with larger contact area is generally false.
    # E. Incorrect. This is an oversimplification; other factors are critical.

    # Option B correctly identifies the two key factors.
