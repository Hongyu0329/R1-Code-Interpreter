    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene molecule (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms in the molecule:** Toluene has 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine the number of basis functions for each type of atom in the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n        *   The core 1s orbital is represented by 1 contracted function.\n        *   The inner valence shell (2s, 2p) is represented by 4 contracted functions (one for 2s, and three for 2p).\n        *   The outer valence shell (2s, 2p) is also represented by 4 contracted functions.\n        *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 functions.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n        *   Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n        *   Its valence 1s orbital is split into an inner and outer part.\n        *   The inner part is 1 contracted function.\n        *   The outer part is 1 contracted function.\n        *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 1 + 1 = 2 functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions:** Sum the functions for all atoms in the molecule.\n    *   Total = (7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/C) + (8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/H)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Toluene molecule is C7H8\n# The basis set is 6-31G\n\n# 1. Define the number of atoms\nnum_C_atoms = 7\nnum_H_atoms = 8\n\n# 2. Define the number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For a Carbon atom (C), it is 9 functions.\n# For a Hydrogen atom (H), it is 2 functions.\nfuncs_per_C = 9\nfuncs_per_H = 2\n\n# 3. Calculate the total number of functions\ntotal_funcs_C = num_C_atoms * funcs_per_C\ntotal_funcs_H = num_H_atoms * funcs_per_H\ntotal_functions = total_funcs_C + total_funcs_H\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers\nprint(f\"The total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"({num_C_atoms} Carbon atoms * {funcs_per_C} functions) + ({num_H_atoms} Hydrogen atoms * {funcs_per_H} functions)\")\nprint(f\"Total = {num_C_atoms} * {funcs_per_C} + {num_H_atoms} * {funcs_per_H} = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene, C7H8, how many contracted Gaussian functions are used\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
