Reasoning:
1. High temperature stress in cyanobacteria like Microcystis aeruginosa leads to an overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), such as the superoxide radical (O2•−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), causing oxidative stress.
2. The cell's first and most immediate line of defense against this rapid increase in ROS is the enzymatic antioxidant system.
3. Key enzymes like Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) are activated first to convert the highly reactive superoxide radical into hydrogen peroxide.
4. Subsequently, other enzymes like Catalase (CAT) and Peroxidases (APX) act to neutralize the hydrogen peroxide.
5. Studies on Microcystis aeruginosa have shown that the activity of these enzymes (SOD, CAT) increases significantly and rapidly upon exposure to heat stress. While other compounds (liposoluble, pigments) do contribute to antioxidant defense, the enzymatic system provides the crucial initial response.
