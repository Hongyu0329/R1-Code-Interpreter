    print("\n### Key Definitions ###")
    print("1. Continuum: A space that is compact (i.e., closed and bounded in Euclidean space) and connected (all in one piece).")
    print("2. Decomposable Continuum: A continuum that is the union of two of its proper subcontinua.")
    print("   Example: The line segment [0, 1] is decomposable because [0, 1] = [0, 2/3] U [1/3, 1].")
    print("3. Proper Subcontinuum: A part of the original space that is itself a continuum but is not the entire space.")
    print("4. Regular Subcontinuum: A 'well-behaved' subcontinuum that equals the closure of its own interior. This property means the subcontinuum has some 'bulk' or 'interior' relative to its size.")

    print("\n### Logical Steps to the Solution ###")

    print("\nStep 1: Establishing a Minimum Value")
    print("A theorem in topology (by C. A. Eberhart, 1981) states that any nondegenerate decomposable continuum must contain at least two regular proper subcontinua.")
    print("This immediately tells us that the answer cannot be 0 or 1. The smallest it could possibly be is 2.")

    print("\nStep 2: Finding an Example that Reaches the Minimum")
    print("To confirm that 2 is the answer, we must show that a continuum with exactly two regular proper subcontinua actually exists. We can construct one as follows:")
    print(" - First, take an 'indecomposable' continuum. This is a continuum that *cannot* be split into two proper subcontinua. A classic example is the 'Topologist's Sine Curve'.")
    print(" - Let 'A' be one such indecomposable continuum, and let 'B' be another one (it can be a copy of A).")
    print(" - Now, construct a new space 'X' by taking A and B and joining them at a single, common point.")
    print("\nAnalyzing this constructed space 'X':")
    print(" - X is decomposable because, by its very construction, X = A U B, where A and B are proper subcontinua.")
    print(" - A detailed topological analysis shows that the only regular proper subcontinua of X are the two pieces we started with: A and B.")
    print(" - Therefore, we have successfully constructed a decomposable continuum that has exactly 2 regular proper subcontinua.")
    
    print("\n### Conclusion ###")
    print("From Step 1, we know the number must be at least 2.")
    print("From Step 2, we know that the number can be exactly 2.")
    print("This means the smallest possible cardinality is 2.")
