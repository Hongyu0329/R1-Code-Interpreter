    "In a Vaganova cambré derrière, the primary principle is to maintain a stable and square pelvis. The bend initiates from the upper back, with the dancer lifting up and out of the waist while keeping both hips firmly facing forward. This creates a clean, controlled line emphasizing spinal flexibility above the hips.\n\nIn contrast, the Balanchine method often encourages a more dynamic and extreme line. For a cambré derrière, the dancer is typically allowed to release the hip of the working leg backward. This \"breaking\" at the hip allows for a much deeper backbend and a more dramatic, angular aesthetic, which is a hallmark of the Balanchine style.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental difference lies in the placement of the hip.\n\n<<<B>>>"
