Yes, it does follow that f = 0. Here is the mathematical proof.

Let f(x) be a function in the Schwartz space S(R). We are given that all its moments are zero. This means for all non-negative integers k = 0, 1, 2, ... we have:
∫ x^k * f(x) dx = 0  (from -∞ to +∞)

Let F(ξ) denote the Fourier transform of f(x), defined as:
F(ξ) = ∫ f(x) * e^(-2*π*i*x*ξ) dx

A core property of the Fourier transform is that it maps the space of Schwartz functions to itself. Thus, F(ξ) is also a Schwartz function, which implies it is infinitely differentiable.

We can compute the derivatives of F(ξ) by differentiating under the integral sign (an operation that is valid for Schwartz functions):
F^(k)(ξ) = d^k/dξ^k [∫ f(x) * e^(-2*π*i*x*ξ) dx]
          = ∫ f(x) * [d^k/dξ^k e^(-2*π*i*x*ξ)] dx
          = ∫ f(x) * (-2*π*i*x)^k * e^(-2*π*i*x*ξ) dx

Now, let's evaluate these derivatives at the origin by setting ξ = 0:
F^(k)(0) = ∫ f(x) * (-2*π*i*x)^k dx
          = (-2*π*i)^k * ∫ x^k * f(x) dx

We are given that the integral ∫ x^k * f(x) dx is 0 for all k. Let's substitute this into the equation.
The numbers involved in this equation are -2, π, and the given moment value, 0.
F^(k)(0) = (-2*π*i)^k * 0
F^(k)(0) = 0

This result shows that the Fourier transform F(ξ) and all of its derivatives are 0 at the point ξ = 0.
Since F(ξ) is a Schwartz function, it is an analytic function. An analytic function whose value and all derivatives at a single point are zero must be identically zero. This is because its Taylor series expansion around that point has all zero coefficients.
Therefore, F(ξ) = 0 for all real numbers ξ.

Finally, we use the fact that the Fourier transform is invertible on the space of Schwartz functions. The inverse Fourier transform is:
f(x) = ∫ F(ξ) * e^(2*π*i*x*ξ) dξ

Since F(ξ) = 0, the integral becomes:
f(x) = ∫ 0 * e^(2*π*i*x*ξ) dξ = 0

Thus, we have shown that f(x) must be the zero function for all x.

The final equation is:
f(x) = 0
The number in this final equation is 0.
