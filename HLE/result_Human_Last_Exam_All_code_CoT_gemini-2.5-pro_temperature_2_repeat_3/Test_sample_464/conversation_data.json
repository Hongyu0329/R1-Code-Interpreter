    "This is a mathematical question that can be answered with a formal proof. I will lay out the step-by-step reasoning for the proof and present it within a Python code block as requested. The proof relies on the properties of the Fourier transform.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Start with the given condition: a Schwartz function $f$ whose moments $\\int x^k f(x) dx$ are all zero.\n2.  Consider the Fourier transform of $f$, which we will call $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$. A key property is that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is also a Schwartz function.\n3.  Show that the derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin, $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)$, are proportional to the moments of the original function $f$.\n4.  Use the given condition to deduce that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ are zero at $\\xi=0$.\n5.  Argue that because $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is a Schwartz function (and thus analytic), having a value and all derivatives equal to zero at a single point implies the function is identically zero everywhere.\n6.  Finally, use the injectivity (invertibility) of the Fourier transform on the space of Schwartz functions to conclude that if $\\hat{f}=0$, then $f$ must also be the zero function.\n\n```python\ndef solve_schwartz_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a detailed mathematical proof for the user's question.\n    The proof shows that if all moments of a Schwartz function are zero, the function itself must be zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    proof = \"\"\"\nYes, it does follow that f = 0. Here is the mathematical proof.\n\nLet f(x) be a function in the Schwartz space S(R). We are given that all its moments are zero. This means for all non-negative integers k = 0, 1, 2, ... we have:\n∫ x^k * f(x) dx = 0  (from -∞ to +∞)\n\nLet F(ξ) denote the Fourier transform of f(x), defined as:\nF(ξ) = ∫ f(x) * e^(-2*π*i*x*ξ) dx\n\nA core property of the Fourier transform is that it maps the space of Schwartz functions to itself. Thus, F(ξ) is also a Schwartz function, which implies it is infinitely differentiable.\n\nWe can compute the derivatives of F(ξ) by differentiating under the integral sign (an operation that is valid for Schwartz functions):\nF^(k)(ξ) = d^k/dξ^k [∫ f(x) * e^(-2*π*i*x*ξ) dx]\n          = ∫ f(x) * [d^k/dξ^k e^(-2*π*i*x*ξ)] dx\n          = ∫ f(x) * (-2*π*i*x)^k * e^(-2*π*i*x*ξ) dx\n\nNow, let's evaluate these derivatives at the origin by setting ξ = 0:\nF^(k)(0) = ∫ f(x) * (-2*π*i*x)^k dx\n          = (-2*π*i)^k * ∫ x^k * f(x) dx\n\nWe are given that the integral ∫ x^k * f(x) dx is 0 for all k. Let's substitute this into the equation.\nThe numbers involved in this equation are -2, π, and the given moment value, 0.\nF^(k)(0) = (-2*π*i)^k * 0\nF^(k)(0) = 0\n\nThis result shows that the Fourier transform F(ξ) and all of its derivatives are 0 at the point ξ = 0.\nSince F(ξ) is a Schwartz function, it is an analytic function. An analytic function whose value and all derivatives at a single point are zero must be identically zero. This is because its Taylor series expansion around that point has all zero coefficients.\nTherefore, F(ξ) = 0 for all real numbers ξ.\n\nFinally, we use the fact that the Fourier transform is invertible on the space of Schwartz functions. The inverse Fourier transform is:\nf(x) = ∫ F(ξ) * e^(2*π*i*x*ξ) dξ\n\nSince F(ξ) = 0, the integral becomes:\nf(x) = ∫ 0 * e^(2*π*i*x*ξ) dξ = 0\n\nThus, we have shown that f(x) must be the zero function for all x.\n\nThe final equation is:\nf(x) = 0\nThe number in this final equation is 0.\n\"\"\"\n    print(proof)\n\nsolve_schwartz_moment_problem()\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
