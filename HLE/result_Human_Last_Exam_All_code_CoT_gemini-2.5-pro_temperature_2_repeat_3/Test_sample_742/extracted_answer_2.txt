No. Gödel's ontological proof is a formal argument in modal logic, dealing with metaphysical concepts like "positive properties" and "necessary existence." The mathematics of quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces, operators, etc.) is a framework for describing and predicting the outcomes of physical measurements in the observable universe. Attempting to use the tools of quantum mechanics to prove Gödel's theorem constitutes a category error, as the mathematical objects of QM do not correspond to the logical and metaphysical concepts in Gödel's proof. The two systems operate in fundamentally different domains.
