    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will use a method called trial division. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Start with the number** `n = 8139881`.\n2.  **Handle the factor 2**: Check if `n` is divisible by 2. If it is, divide `n` by 2 and add 2 to our list of prime factors. Repeat until `n` is odd. (In this case, 8139881 is already odd, so we can skip this).\n3.  **Iterate through odd numbers**: Starting from `i = 3`, check if `n` is divisible by `i`.\n    *   If it is, add `i` to our list of factors and divide `n` by `i`. Repeat this step with the same `i` until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`.\n    *   If it's not, move to the next odd number (`i = i + 2`).\n4.  **Set the limit**: We only need to check for divisors `i` up to the square root of the current `n`. This is because if `n` has a prime factor larger than its square root, it must also have a prime factor smaller than its square root, which we would have already found.\n5.  **Handle the remainder**: After the loop finishes, if the remaining value of `n` is greater than 2, this remaining value is also a prime factor. This handles the case where the largest prime factor is greater than the square root of the original number.\n6.  **Find the largest**: Once all prime factors are found, the largest one is simply the maximum value in our list of factors.\n7.  **Format the output**: The final script will first print the complete prime factorization as an equation (e.g., `8139881 = factor1 * factor2 * ...`) and then print the largest prime divisor found.\n\nFollowing this plan, the Python code below will calculate the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the prime factors of 8139881, prints the factorization\n    equation, and then prints the largest prime divisor.\n    \"\"\"\n    number = 8139881\n    n = number\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor 2 separately. \n    # Not necessary for this specific number, but it's good practice.\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors.
