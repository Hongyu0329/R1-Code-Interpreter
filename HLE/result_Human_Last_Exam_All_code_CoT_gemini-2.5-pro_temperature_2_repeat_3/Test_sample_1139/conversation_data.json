    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating problem from the field of theoretical condensed matter physics. Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical structure:** The question asks for the number of bosonic (non-Grassmann) variables in a supersymmetric sigma-model. This number is determined by the specific mathematical space, a supermanifold, on which the model's fields are defined. The symmetry class \"D\" and the number of replicas \"two\" will specify this supermanifold.\n2.  **Determine the Supermanifold:** For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the corresponding supersymmetric sigma-model with `N` replicas is defined on the coset superspace `G/H = OSp(4N|4N) / (OSp(2N|2N) x OSp(2N|2N))`.\n3.  **Find the Bosonic Dimension:** The number of non-Grassmann variables is the dimension of the bosonic part of this supermanifold. For a coset space `G/H`, this is calculated as the difference between the dimensions of the bosonic subgroups of `G` and `H`, denoted `G₀` and `H₀`. The formula is: `Number of variables = dim(G₀) - dim(H₀)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Dimensions:**\n    *   The bosonic subgroup of the orthogonal symplectic supergroup `OSp(m|2n)` is `O(m) x Sp(2n,R)`.\n    *   The dimension of the orthogonal group `O(k)` is `k(k-1)/2`.\n    *   The dimension of the real symplectic group `Sp(2k,R)` is `k(2k+1)`.\n5.  **Compute the Final Result:** Using these formulas, I will first find a general expression for the number of variables in terms of `N`. Then, I will substitute `N=2` as specified in the problem to get the final numerical answer. The python script will perform this calculation and print out each step.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the plan:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bosonic_variables(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassmann variables for the supersymmetric sigma-model\n    of symmetry class D with N replicas.\n\n    The target space is the supermanifold G/H where:\n    G = OSp(4N|4N)\n    H = OSp(2N|2N) x OSp(2N|2N)\n\n    The number of bosonic variables is dim(G0) - dim(H0), where G0 and H0 are\n    the bosonic subgroups of G and H.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Dimensions for G = OSp(4N|4N) ---\n    # The bosonic subgroup G0 is O(4N) x Sp(4N,R).\n    # dim(O(n)) = n(n-1)/2\n    # dim(Sp(2k,R)) = k(2k+1)\n\n    # For G0, n_ortho = 4N, k_symp = 2N\n    n_ortho_G = 4 * N\n    k_symp_G = 2 * N\n    \n    dim_O_4N = n_ortho_G * (n_ortho_G - 1) / 2\n    dim_Sp_4N = k_symp_G * (2 * k_symp_G + 1)\n    dim_G0 = dim_O_4N + dim_Sp_4N\n\n    # --- Dimensions for H = OSp(2N|2N) x OSp(2N|2N) ---\n    # H0 consists of two identical factors, each being the bosonic subgroup of OSp(2N|2N).\n    # For one factor, the bosonic subgroup is O(2N) x Sp(2N,R).\n    # Here, n_ortho = 2N, k_symp = N\n    n_ortho_H = 2 * N\n    k_symp_H = N\n\n    dim_O_2N = n_ortho_H * (n_ortho_H - 1) / 2\n    dim_Sp_2N = k_symp_H * (2 * k_symp_H + 1)\n    dim_H0_one_factor = dim_O_2N + dim_Sp_2N\n    dim_H0 = 2 * dim_H0_one_factor\n\n    # --- Final Calculation ---\n    num_variables = dim_G0 - dim_H0\n\n    print(\"The number of replicas is N = {}.\".format(N))\n    print(\"The target supermanifold is G/H = OSp(4N|4N) / (OSp(2N|2N) x OSp(2N|2N)).\")\n    print(\"The number of bosonic variables equals the dimension of the bosonic part of G/H.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Calculate the dimension of the bosonic subgroup G0 of G = OSp({}|{}).\".format(4*N, 4*N))\n    print(\"G0 = O({}) x Sp({}),R)\".format(n_ortho_G, n_ortho_G))\n    print(\"dim(G0) = dim(O({})) + dim(Sp({},R))\".format(n_ortho_G, n_ortho_G))\n    print(\"dim(G0) = {} + {} = {}\".format(int(dim_O_4N), int(dim_Sp_4N), int(dim_G0)))\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the dimension of the bosonic subgroup H0 of H = OSp({}|{}) x OSp({}|{}).\".format(2*N, 2*N, 2*N, 2*N))\n    print(\"H0 has two factors.
