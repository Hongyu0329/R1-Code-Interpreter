    Analyzes patient transport options in a trauma scenario.

    The primary principle in traumatic cardiac arrest is minimizing time to
    definitive surgical care. The scoring system reflects this by prioritizing
    higher-level trauma centers and penalizing longer transport times.

    Scoring logic:
    - A 'capability_score' is assigned based on the trauma center level.
      Level 1 and 2 are highly capable for this case. Level 3 is less so,
      and Level 4 is inappropriate for definitive care.
    - The final score is the capability_score divided by the transport time.
    - A higher final score indicates a better choice.
    - The toxicologist is not a factor in the score, as the immediate
      life threat is the trauma, not the overdose.
