    "I will identify the numerical markings on Teva brand 10mg and 20mg fluoxetine capsules. After finding the specific numbers associated with each dosage from a reliable drug identification database, I will create a Python script to print out the findings clearly. The script will display each number and its corresponding capsule strength.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the numerical imprints on Teva brand fluoxetine capsules.\n\n# Define the imprints for each dosage.\nimprint_10mg = \"3105\"\nimprint_20mg = \"3106\"\n\n# Print the result in a clear sentence.\nprint(f\"The number on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is {imprint_10mg}, and the number on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\n```\n<<<The number on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is 3105, and the number on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is 3106.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
