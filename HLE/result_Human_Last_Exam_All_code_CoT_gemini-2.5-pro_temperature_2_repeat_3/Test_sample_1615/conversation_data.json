    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Interpret the question:** The goal is to find the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph. The chromatic number is the minimum number of colors for a proper vertex coloring.\n2.  **Establish an upper bound:** A graph on $n$ vertices can have a chromatic number of at most $n$. The only graph that requires $n$ colors is the complete graph, $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Since the problem states that $G$ is *not* a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. Therefore, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n3.  **Prove the bound is tight:** To show that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, I need to demonstrate that there exists a graph that is not complete and requires exactly $n-1$ colors.\n4.  **Construct an example graph:** Consider a graph created by taking a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and adding a single, separate vertex that is not connected to any other vertices. This graph has $n$ vertices. It is not a complete graph.\n5.  **Analyze the example graph's chromatic number:** The $K_{n-1}$ component of this graph requires $n-1$ distinct colors. Thus, the entire graph needs at least $n-1$ colors. Combined with the upper bound from step 2, the chromatic number of this specific graph is exactly $n-1$.\n6.  **Conclude and calculate:** This proves that the maximum number of colors required for a non-complete graph with $n$ vertices is $n-1$. I will substitute $n=12345$ to get the final result.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value and explains the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors for a non-complete graph with n vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph G.\n    n = 12345\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the general theory.\n    # The chromatic number of any graph with n vertices, chi(G), is at most n.\n    # chi(G) = n if and only if G is a complete graph (K_n), where every vertex\n    # is connected to every other vertex.\n    # The problem states that G is NOT a complete graph.\n\n    # Step 2: Establish the upper bound.\n    # Since G is not a complete graph, there must be at least one pair of vertices\n    # that are not adjacent. These two vertices can be assigned the same color.\n    # This implies that a proper coloring with at most n-1 colors is always possible.\n    # Therefore, the chromatic number must be less than n: chi(G) <= n - 1.\n\n    # Step 3: Show the upper bound is achievable (tight).\n    # To show that n-1 is the maximum, we need to find a non-complete graph on n\n    # vertices that requires exactly n-1 colors.\n    # Consider a graph formed by a complete subgraph on n-1 vertices (a K_{n-1})\n    # and one additional isolated vertex.\n    # This graph has (n-1) + 1 = n vertices. It is not complete because the\n    # isolated vertex is not connected to the others.\n    # The K_{n-1} part, by definition, requires n-1 distinct colors. So, the\n    # chromatic number of the whole graph is at least n-1.\n\n    # Step 4: Conclude the maximum number of colors.\n    # From Step 2 and 3, we know chi(G) <= n-1, and there is a graph for which\n    # chi(G) = n-1. So, the maximum is n-1.\n    max_colors = n - 1\n\n    # Step 5: Output the result and the equation.\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"For any graph G that is not a complete graph, the chromatic number chi(G) is at most n - 1.\")\n    print(\"We can construct a non-complete graph with a chromatic number of n - 1 (e.g., K_{n-1} plus an isolated vertex).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is n - 1.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is: {n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_graph_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
