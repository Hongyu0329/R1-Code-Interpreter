    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points:** These are the points $(u, d)$ where both $u'(t)$ and $d'(t)$ are zero. These points are critical to understanding the long-term behavior of the system.\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points:** By linearizing the system around each equilibrium point (i.e., by analyzing the Jacobian matrix), I can determine their type (e.g., node, spiral, saddle point).\n3.  **Identify the separatrix:** A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that divides trajectories with different fates. Such curves are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points. Once a saddle point is identified, I will search for an analytic curve representing its manifold that connects to another equilibrium point.\n4.  **Verify the solution:** I will propose an equation for the separatrix and then use a Python script with the `sympy` library to symbolically prove that this equation describes a valid trajectory of the system. The script will substitute the proposed solution into the original differential equations and confirm that the equations hold true.\n\nThis process combines analytical reasoning to find a candidate solution and computational power to rigorously verify it.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function verifies the proposed equation for the separatrix of the given system of ODEs.\n    \n    The system is:\n    d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)\n    u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)\n    \n    Through analysis, we find the equilibrium points at (0,0), (1,0), and (1,-1).\n    The point (1,-1) is a saddle point. The separatrix is often the unstable\n    manifold of a saddle point. We propose that the separatrix connecting the\n    saddle point (1,-1) to the critical point (0,0) is given by the equation d = -u^2.\n    \n    This script will verify this claim symbolically.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define symbols and functions for symbolic manipulation\n    t = sp.Symbol('t')\n    u = sp.Function('u')(t)\n    d = sp.Function('d')(t)\n\n    # Define the original system of ODEs\n    d_prime_rhs = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1-u)\n    u_prime = u**3 - u**2\n\n    # Define the proposed separatrix equation: d(t) = -u(t)^2\n    proposed_d_solution = -u**2\n    \n    print(\"Verifying the proposed separatrix equation: d = -u^2\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
