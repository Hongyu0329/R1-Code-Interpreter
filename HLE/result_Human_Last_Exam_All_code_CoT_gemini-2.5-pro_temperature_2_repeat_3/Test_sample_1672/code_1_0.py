Step-by-step reasoning:

1.  The reward function at iteration k is defined as r_k(s) = -log(p_{k-1}(s)), where p_{k-1}(s) is the state distribution induced by the policy from the previous iteration, pi^{k-1}.

2.  This reward structure provides a high reward for visiting states that were previously rare (i.e., had a low probability p_{k-1}(s)).

3.  A reinforcement learning agent, in optimizing for this reward, will learn a new policy pi^k that drives it to visit these previously rare states more frequently.

4.  As a result, the new state distribution p_k(s) will be more spread out, or 'flatter', than the previous distribution p_{k-1}(s).

5.  The entropy of the state distribution, H(s), is maximized when the distribution is uniform (i.e., p(s) is the same for all states). A flatter distribution has a higher entropy. Therefore, the entropy of the state distribution is expected to increase or stay the same with each iteration: H(p_k) >= H(p_{k-1}).

6.  This iterative process will converge to a fixed point where the policy and its induced state distribution no longer change. This equilibrium is reached when the state distribution p*(s) is as uniform as possible given the environment's dynamics.

7.  When p*(s) is uniform, the reward r(s) = -log(p*(s)) becomes constant for all states. With a constant reward, there is no incentive to prefer any state over another, stabilizing the policy.

8.  This maximally-uniform state distribution is achieved in the limit of the iterative process. Thus, the policy that maximizes the state entropy H(s) is the one obtained as k approaches infinity.

Conclusion:
The policy that maximizes the entropy H(s) is the limit of the sequence of policies generated by this process.
