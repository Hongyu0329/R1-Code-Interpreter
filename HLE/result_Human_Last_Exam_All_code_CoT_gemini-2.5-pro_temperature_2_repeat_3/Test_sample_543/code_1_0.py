    Determines the IUPAC name of the product from the reaction of
    1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and excess phenyl magnesium bromide.

    1. The Grignard reagent (phenyl magnesium bromide) is a strong nucleophile.
    2. It reacts with aryl halides in a coupling reaction. The reactivity of halogens
       is I > Br > Cl > F.
    3. The first reaction occurs at the most reactive C-I bond at position 2.
       Product: 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.
    4. Since "excess" reagent and "reflux" conditions are used, the reaction proceeds
       to substitute the less reactive bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3.
    5. Both bromine atoms are replaced by phenyl groups.
    6. The final product has a central benzene ring with three phenyl substituents at
       positions 1, 2, and 3.
    7. The IUPAC name for this molecule is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.
