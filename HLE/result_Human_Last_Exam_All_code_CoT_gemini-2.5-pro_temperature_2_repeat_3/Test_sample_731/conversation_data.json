    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the group and its parameters.** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as `SD_512`. The order of a semidihedral group is a power of 2, written as `2^n`. We'll find `n` for the group of size 512.\n2.  **Define \"power subgroup\".** A power subgroup of a group `G` is a subgroup formed by taking all k-th powers of elements of `G`, for some integer `k`. This subgroup is denoted as `G^k = <g^k | g ∈ G>`. We need to count how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way.\n3.  **Analyze the structure of power subgroups for `SD_{2^n}`.** We will determine the set of all power subgroups `{G^k | k ∈ Z}` for a general semidihedral group `SD_{2^n}`.\n4.  **Calculate the final number.** Using the determined formula, we will calculate the number of power subgroups for `n=9`.\n5.  **Provide a Python script.** The script will automate this calculation and print the result with a step-by-step explanation.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  The group is the semidihedral group `SD_512`. Its size (order) is 512. The general form of a semidihedral group's order is `2^n`. So, we have the equation `2^n = 512`. By taking the logarithm base 2, we find `n = log2(512) = 9`.\n\n2.  For a given integer `k`, the `k`-th power subgroup is `G^k = <g^k | g ∈ G>`. We are looking for the size of the set of all such subgroups, `|{G^k | k ∈ Z}|`.\n\n3.  The semidihedral group `SD_{2^n}` (for `n ≥ 4`) has the presentation `<r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, sr = r^(2^(n-2)-1)s>`. Through group-theoretic analysis, it can be shown that the set of power subgroups `G^k` only depends on the power of 2 that divides `k`. Specifically, if `k = 2^j * m` with `m` being odd, then `G^k = G^(2^j)`. This leads to the following distinct power subgroups:\n    *   `G^1 = G` (The group `SD_{2^n}` itself)\n    *   `G^2 = <r^2>` (A cyclic subgroup of order `2^(n-2)`)\n    *   `G^4 = <r^4>` (A cyclic subgroup of order `2^(n-3)`)\n    *   ...\n    *   `G^(2^(n-2)) = <r^(2^(n-2))>` (A cyclic subgroup of order 2)\n    *   `G^(2^(n-1)) = <r^(2^(n-1))> = {1}` (The trivial subgroup)\n\n4.  Counting these distinct subgroups, we have `G` itself, plus `n-1` distinct cyclic subgroups (`<r^2>`, `<r^4>`, ..., `<r^(2^(n-1))>`). This gives a total of `1 + (n-1) = n` distinct power subgroups.\n\nFor `SD_512`, we have `n=9`. Therefore, there are 9 power subgroups.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the explanation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The size of the semidihedral group\ngroup_size = 512\n\n# Step 1: Identify the parameter n for the semidihedral group SD_{2^n}.\n# We solve the equation 2^n = group_size.\nn = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n# Step 2: Apply the formula for the number of power subgroups.\n# For a semidihedral group G = SD_{2^n} (where n >= 4), the number of\n# distinct power subgroups { G^k | k in Z } is equal to n.\n# Our group is SD_512, so n=9, which satisfies the condition n >= 4.\nnumber_of_power_subgroups = n\n\nprint(\"This script calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"The size of the semidihedral group is {group_size}.\")\nprint(\"The size of a semidihedral group is generally written as 2^n.\")\nprint(\"\\nStep 1: Find the value of n.\")\nprint(f\"We need to solve the equation: 2^n = {group_size}\")\nprint(f\"Taking the logarithm base 2: n = log2({group_size})\")\nprint(f\"This gives: n = {n}\")\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the number of power subgroups.\")\nprint(\"For the semidihedral group SD_{2^n} with n>=4, the number of power subgroups is exactly n.\")\nprint(f\"Since n = {n}, this formula applies.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\nprint(f\"The number of power subgroups = n = {number_of_power_subgroups}\")\n```\n<<<9>>>"
