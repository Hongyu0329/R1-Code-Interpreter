# The size of the semidihedral group
group_size = 512

# Step 1: Identify the parameter n for the semidihedral group SD_{2^n}.
# We solve the equation 2^n = group_size.
n = int(math.log2(group_size))

# Step 2: Apply the formula for the number of power subgroups.
# For a semidihedral group G = SD_{2^n} (where n >= 4), the number of
# distinct power subgroups { G^k | k in Z } is equal to n.
# Our group is SD_512, so n=9, which satisfies the condition n >= 4.
number_of_power_subgroups = n
