# The final expression to be calculated is:
# Expression = (2 * ||alpha||^2) / ((pi^2 / 6) - 1) + 10^15

# Based on the derivation from the problem's conditions:
# 1. The functional z(y) is represented by z(y) = (alpha, y).
# 2. We have an orthogonal system {y_i} with ||y_i||^2 = 2.
# 3. The condition z(y_i) = 1/(i+1) implies (alpha, y_i) = 1/(i+1).
# 4. We construct an orthonormal system {e_i} where e_i = y_i / sqrt(2).
# 5. The Fourier coefficients of alpha in this basis are c_i = (alpha, e_i) = 1 / (sqrt(2) * (i+1)).
# 6. By Parseval's identity, ||alpha||^2 = sum(|c_i|^2) from i=1 to infinity.
#    ||alpha||^2 = sum(1 / (2 * (i+1)^2)) = (1/2) * sum(1 / (j^2)) for j=2 to infinity.
# 7. Using the Basel problem result (sum(1/k^2) from k=1 to inf = pi^2 / 6), the sum from j=2 is (pi^2 / 6) - 1.
# 8. Therefore, ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * ((pi^2 / 6) - 1).

# Now, we substitute this into the expression.
# Expression = (2 * (1/2) * ((pi^2 / 6) - 1)) / ((pi^2 / 6) - 1) + 10^15
# The term ((pi^2 / 6) - 1) cancels out.
# Expression = 1 + 10^15

# Python code to compute the final value based on this simplified equation.

# The value of the fraction after cancellation
fraction_value = 1

# The constant term to be added
constant_term = 10**15

# The final equation to be solved is the sum of these two numbers.
print("The final simplified equation is:")
print(f"{fraction_value} + {constant_term}")

# Calculate the final result
final_result = fraction_value + constant_term

print("\nThe final result is:")
print(int(final_result))
