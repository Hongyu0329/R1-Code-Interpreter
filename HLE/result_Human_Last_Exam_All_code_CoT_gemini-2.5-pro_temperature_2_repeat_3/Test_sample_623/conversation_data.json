    "To determine the number of 13C-labeled CO2 molecules released when 1,4-13C glucose undergoes glycolysis, we need to trace the labeled carbons through the metabolic pathway.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will start with a glucose molecule where carbons at position 1 and position 4 are labeled with the 13C isotope.\n2.  I will follow the fate of these labeled carbons through the key steps of the glycolysis pathway. The most important step for tracking the carbons is the cleavage of the 6-carbon sugar (Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate) into two 3-carbon sugars.\n3.  I will track these labels all the way to the final products of glycolysis, which are two molecules of pyruvate.\n4.  Finally, I will analyze the overall reaction of glycolysis to see if any CO2 is produced during this specific pathway. The code will print out each step of this logical deduction.\n\n```python\ndef trace_glycolysis_carbons():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the labeled carbons of 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis\n    and determines the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    The glycolysis pathway specifically refers to the conversion of glucose to pyruvate.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the initial labeled carbons in the glucose molecule.\n    # We will use a dictionary where the key is the carbon number and the value is 1 for labeled (13C) and 0 for unlabeled (12C).\n    initial_labeled_carbons = [1, 4]\n    \n    print(f\"The starting molecule is glucose with 13C labels at positions {initial_labeled_carbons[0]} and {initial_labeled_carbons[1]}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Cleavage of the 6-carbon sugar.\n    # In glycolysis, Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (derived from glucose) is cleaved by aldolase.\n    # This cleavage yields two 3-carbon molecules:\n    # - Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) from glucose carbons 1, 2, and 3.\n    # - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) from glucose carbons 4, 5, and 6.\n    print(\"Step 1: The 6-carbon sugar is cleaved into two 3-carbon molecules.\")\n    \n    # Let's trace the labels.\n    # The label at Glucose's C1 ends up on DHAP.\n    # The label at Glucose's C4 ends up on GAP.\n    print(f\" - The label from glucose's C{initial_labeled_carbons[0]} goes to DHAP.\")\n    print(f\" - The label from glucose's C{initial_labeled_carbons[1]} goes to GAP.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 2: Isomerization and subsequent reactions.\n    # DHAP is converted to GAP, so both halves of the original glucose molecule proceed down the same path as GAP.\n    # This results in two populations of pyruvate molecules.\n    print(\"Step 2: The DHAP is converted to GAP.
