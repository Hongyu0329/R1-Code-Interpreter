    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Family of Lines\nThe problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain `K` in the plane that intersects every line `L` from the family of lines given by the equation:\n`px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nLet's list a few lines from this family to understand their nature:\n*   If `(p,q) = (1,0)`, the line is `x = 1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (-1,0)`, the line is `-x = 1`, or `x = -1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (0,1)`, the line is `y = 1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (0,-1)`, the line is `-y = 1`, or `y = -1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (1,1)`, the line is `x + y = 1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (-1,-1)`, the line is `-x - y = 1`, or `x + y = -1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (1,-1)`, the line is `x - y = 1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (-1,1)`, the line is `-x + y = 1`.\n\nA key property of these lines is that every line `px + qy = 1` with `gcd(p,q)=1` contains at least one integer point `(x₀, y₀)`. This is a direct consequence of Bézout's identity.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a Candidate Domain and an Upper Bound for the Area\nLet's try to find a convex domain that satisfies the condition. Consider the square `K_C` defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`. This is a square with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\n\n*   **Area of `K_C`**: The side length of this square is `sqrt((1-0)² + (0-1)²) = sqrt(2)`. The area is `(sqrt(2))² = 2`.\n*   **Intersection property of `K_C`**: For a convex domain `K` to intersect a line `px + qy = 1`, the set of values of the function `f(x,y) = px + qy` for `(x,y)` in `K` must contain the value 1. This means `min_K(f) ≤ 1 ≤ max_K(f)`.\n    *   For the square `K_C`, the minimum and maximum values of the linear function `f(x,y) = px + qy` are attained at its vertices: `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\n    *   The values at the vertices are `p`, `q`, `-p`, and `-q`.\n    *   So, `max_{K_C}(px + qy) = max(p, q, -p, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    *   And `min_{K_C}(px + qy) = -max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    *   For `K_C` to intersect the line, we need `-max(|p|,|q|) ≤ 1 ≤ max(|p|,|q|)`. This simplifies to `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\n    *   The condition on `p` and `q` is that they are coprime integers. This implies they cannot both be zero. Therefore, at least one of `|p|` or `|q|` must be at least 1. This means `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1` is always true for coprime integers `p` and `q`.\n*   **Conclusion**: The square `K_C` with area 2 intersects every line in the family. This means the minimal possible area is at most 2.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound for the Area\nNow, we must prove that any convex domain `K` satisfying the condition must have an area of at least 2.\n\n1.  Let `K` be any convex domain that intersects all lines `px+qy=1` with `gcd(p,q)=1`. We can assume `K` is closed and bounded (an unbounded domain would have infinite area, which cannot be minimal).\n2.  Let `sup_K(x)` be the maximum value of `x` for points in `K`, and `inf_K(x)` be the minimum value.\n3.  `K` must intersect the line `x = 1` (`p=1, q=0`). This implies `inf_K(x) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_K(x)`.\n4.  `K` must intersect the line `x = -1` (`p=-1, q=0`). This implies `inf_K(x) ≤ -1 ≤ sup_K(x)`.\n5.  Combining these two conditions, we get `sup_K(x) ≥ 1` and `inf_K(x) ≤ -1`.\n6.  The width of `K` in the x-direction, `W_x`, is `sup_K(x) - inf_K(x)`. From the previous point, `W_x ≥ 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n7.  Similarly, considering the lines `y = 1` (`p=0, q=1`) and `y = -1` (`p=0, q=-1`), we find that the width of `K` in the y-direction, `W_y = sup_K(y) - inf_K(y)`, must be at least 2.\n8.  Now we use a geometrical theorem. For any convex set `K` in the plane, let `W_x` and `W_y` be its widths in two orthogonal directions (like the x and y axes). There exist four points `P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4` in `K` that define these widths (i.e., `x(P_1)=sup_K(x)`, `x(P_2)=inf_K(x)`, etc.). The area of `K` must be at least the area of the convex hull of these four points.\n9.  A known result states that the area of the convex hull of these four extremal points is at least `(W_x * W_y) / 2`.\n10. Therefore, `Area(K) ≥ Area(conv(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4)) ≥ (W_x * W_y) / 2`.\n11. Substituting the lower bounds we found for the widths: `Area(K) ≥ (2 * 2) / 2 = 2`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nFrom Step 2, we found a convex domain with area 2 that satisfies the conditions. Thus, the minimal area is at most 2.\nFrom Step 3, we proved that any convex domain satisfying the conditions must have an area of at least 2.\n\nCombining these two results, the minimal area must be exactly 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
