    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Components:**\n    *   **Chern Insulator:** This is a 2D topological phase of matter characterized by a quantized Hall conductivity. It is an insulator in its bulk but has conducting states along its edges.\n    *   **Chern Number (C):** This is the topological invariant that classifies the Chern insulator. It is an integer. For a system with Chern number `C`, the Hall conductivity is given by `Ïƒ_xy = C * (e^2/h)`, where `e` is the elementary charge and `h` is Planck's constant.\n    *   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** A key principle of topological insulators is that the bulk topological invariant (the Chern number) dictates the properties of the boundary. A system with Chern number `C` will host `|C|` chiral edge states. Chiral means they propagate in only one direction along a given edge. The sign of `C` determines the direction of propagation (chirality).\n    *   **The Setup:** We have two distinct Chern insulators, let's call them CI1 and CI2. Both have a Chern number of `C=1`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Geometry and Interaction:**\n    *   **\"Connects laterally\":** This implies the two insulators are placed side-by-side in the same 2D plane, sharing a common boundary. Imagine two rectangular tiles placed next to each other.\n        ```\n        +-------------------+-------------------+\n        | Chern Insulator 1 | Chern Insulator 2 |\n        |       (C=1)       |       (C=1)       |\n        +-------------------+-------------------+\n                      ^\n                      |\n                   The Junction / Interface\n        ```\n    *   **\"Negligible tunneling barrier\":** This is a crucial physical condition. It means that the edge states that exist at the interface between the two insulators can freely interact, hybridize, and tunnel between the two materials.\n\n3.  **Analyze using the Additivity of the Chern Number:**\n    *   The Chern number is a bulk property. It can be calculated by integrating the Berry curvature over the entire system.\n    *   When two systems are combined into one larger system without closing the energy gap in the bulk, the Chern number of the composite system is simply the sum of the individual Chern numbers. This is a fundamental property of this topological invariant.\n    *   Let `C_total` be the Chern number of the combined system, `C1` be the Chern number of the first insulator, and `C2` be that of the second.\n    *   `C_total = C1 + C2`\n    *   Given `C1 = 1` and `C2 = 1`.\n    *   `C_total = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n4.  **Analyze using Edge States (to verify the result):**\n    *   Let's assume a Chern number of `C=+1` corresponds to counter-clockwise (CCW) propagation of edge states.\n    *   **For CI1 alone:** It has an edge state running CCW along its boundary. So, on its right edge (the future interface), the state propagates upwards. On its top edge, it goes left. On its bottom edge, it goes right.\n    *   **For CI2 alone:** It also has a CCW edge state. On its left edge (the future interface), the state propagates downwards. On its top edge, it goes left. On its bottom edge, it goes right.\n    *   **At the junction:** Now, we join the right edge of CI1 to the left edge of CI2.\n        *   CI1 contributes an upward-propagating state at the interface.\n        *   CI2 contributes a downward-propagating state at the interface.\n    *   **Interaction:** We have two counter-propagating states at the same physical location (the interface). Because there is a \"negligible tunneling barrier\", these two states will hybridize. This hybridization opens an energy gap, and the two states effectively annihilate each other. Thus, there are **no net propagating states** at the junction itself.\n    *   **On the outer boundary:**\n        *   **Top Edge:** The top edge of the composite system consists of the top edge of CI1 and the top edge of CI2. Both contribute a left-propagating state. We therefore have **two** left-propagating states along the top.\n        *   **Bottom Edge:** Similarly, the bottom edge has a right-propagating state from CI1 and a right-propagating state from CI2. This gives **two** right-propagating states along the bottom.\n    *   **Conclusion from Edge States:** The total number of net chiral edge states is 2. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with 2 net chiral edge modes must have a bulk Chern number of 2.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Final Answer:**\n    *   Both the bulk additivity principle and the analysis of the boundary states give a consistent result.\n    *   The term \"Chern number of this junction\" is understood to mean the Chern number of the composite system formed by joining the two insulators.\n\nThe Chern number of the resulting system is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
