    "An analysis of the question is provided below, including step-by-step reasoning and a list of careful points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Objective:** Construct a \"full spectral volume\". A spectral volume, also known as a hyperspectral data cube, is a three-dimensional dataset with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). Essentially, it's an image where each pixel contains a full spectrum of light intensity.\n    *   **Method:** \"Computed Tomography\" (CT). This implies a reconstruction process. In medical CT, a 3D volume (x, y, z) is reconstructed from a series of 2D projection images taken from different angles. Here, the principle is adapted to reconstruct a 3D spectral volume (x, y, λ) from 2D projections.\n    *   **Constraint:** \"From a single image\". This is a critical constraint. All the information required for the 3D reconstruction must be encoded onto and captured by a single 2D sensor frame in one snapshot.\n    *   **Tool:** \"Diffraction gratings\". These are optical components that separate light into its constituent wavelengths (colors).\n\n2.  **Connecting the Concepts (How it works):**\n    *   The technique described is known as **Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS)**.\n    *   The goal is to encode the 3D data cube (x, y, λ) onto a 2D sensor.\n    *   A diffraction grating disperses light. When light from an object passes through a grating, it creates a \"zeroth-order\" image, which is the direct, undiffracted (panchromatic or grayscale) image of the object. It also creates multiple higher-order images (±1st, ±2nd, etc.). In these higher-order images, each point from the original object is spread out into a line of its component colors (a spectrum).\n    *   The CT reconstruction algorithm treats these different diffraction-order images as different \"projections\" of the original spectral data cube. Just as a medical CT scanner needs projections from many angles to reconstruct a volume, CTIS needs multiple, distinct projections to reconstruct the spectral volume.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Number of Gratings:**\n    *   **Case 1: One Diffraction Grating.** A single, one-dimensional (1D) grating disperses light along a single axis. This will produce a central 0th-order image, and a series of spectrally dispersed images (1st order, 2nd order, etc.) lined up along that same axis. All the \"projections\" are collinear. This leads to a severe ambiguity problem. For any two points in the scene that lie on a line perpendicular to the dispersion axis, their spectral information will completely overlap and be inseparable. This is analogous to trying to perform a medical CT scan by taking all X-ray images from a single angle; you cannot reconstruct the internal structure. Therefore, one grating is insufficient.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Two Diffraction Gratings.** To solve the ambiguity, we need \"projections\" that are not all lined up. This can be achieved by using two 1D gratings oriented perpendicularly to each other (or, equivalently, a single component known as a 2D or \"crossed\" grating). This setup disperses light in two dimensions (e.g., horizontally and vertically). For each point in the object, a 2D pattern of diffraction orders is created on the sensor. The result on the sensor is a central 0th-order image surrounded by a 2D array of overlapping, spectrally dispersed images. For instance, there will be orders dispersed horizontally (the (±1, 0) orders), vertically (the (0, ±1) orders), and diagonally (the (±1, ±1) orders). This set of non-collinear \"projections\" provides enough information for a computed tomography algorithm to resolve the overlaps and reconstruct the original (x, y, λ) data cube.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The minimum requirement for tomographic reconstruction is a set of non-collinear projections. A single grating cannot provide this. Two gratings, oriented to disperse light in two independent directions, is the minimum configuration that can.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **\"Computed Tomography\" is the key:** The question explicitly mentions CT. This technique fundamentally relies on acquiring information from multiple, diverse perspectives (or \"projections\") to reconstruct a higher-dimensional object. The different diffraction orders serve as these projections.\n2.  **\"Single Image\" is a hard constraint:** This rules out any technique that involves physically moving parts, like rotating a grating or using a filter wheel, between multiple exposures. The entire set of projections must be captured simultaneously.\n3.  **\"Full Spectral Volume\"**: This clarifies that the goal is not just color imaging but a true 3D (x, y, λ) reconstruction, making the tomographic approach necessary.\n4.  **Minimum vs. Optimal**: The question asks for the *minimum* number. While using more complex gratings might improve image quality or light efficiency, two is the minimum number of independent dispersion axes needed for the basic principle to work.\n5.  **Conceptual vs. Physical Gratings**: A 2D crossed grating is a single physical component, but it functions by providing two independent directions of dispersion, equivalent to two perpendicular 1D gratings. Therefore, the minimum number of fundamental grating *functions* or *axes of dispersion* required is two.\n\nBased on this analysis, the minimum number of diffraction gratings (or grating functions) needed to create the necessary non-collinear projections for tomographic reconstruction is two.\n\n<<<B>>>"
