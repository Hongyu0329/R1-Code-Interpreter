    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe prompt states that the title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" is a question. The most logical interpretation is to read it phonetically as \"The B's?\", asking \"What are the B's?\". This implies that the solution is a list of words that start with the letter 'B'. The haiku itself must contain the clues to find these \"B-words\". Since the haiku has three lines, it is logical to assume we are looking for three words, one from each line.\n\n**Step 2: List the careful points to consider.**\n*   The title \"The Bays\" is the central question: \"What are the B's?\".\n*   The haiku provides the clues, with one B-word hidden in each of its three lines.\n*   The final answer must be a list of these B-words presented in alphabetical order.\n*   Each line needs to be decoded to find the intended B-word.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each line of the haiku.**\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   A \"tempest\" is a violent storm characterized by strong wind.\n    *   A common and fitting term for a powerful gust of wind or a storm is a strong **Blow**.\n    *   This word starts with 'B' and accurately describes a tempest.\n    *   The first B-word is **Blow**.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is a mathematical clue: 2 x 15 = 30.\n    *   The phrase \"brings winds of change\" points towards weather forecasting or a mechanism that indicates a change in weather.\n    *   A **Barometer** measures atmospheric pressure. Standard pressure is approximately 29.92 inches of mercury, which is commonly rounded to 30.\n    *   A changing reading on a barometer, especially from the baseline of 30, \"brings winds of change\" by predicting an approaching storm or shift in weather.\n    *   The number 30 is the key that links \"Twice fifteen\" to the barometer.\n    *   The second B-word is **Barometer**.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   \"A divine one\" refers to a god, deity, or other sacred figure.\n    *   The verb \"yields\" means to provide, produce, or bestow.\n    *   A very common concept is for a divine being to yield or bestow a **Blessing** upon mortals.\n    *   This fits the description perfectly and starts with 'B'.\n    *   The third B-word is **Blessing**.\n\n**Step 4: Consolidate and format the final answer.**\n*   The three \"B's\" we have found are: Blow, Barometer, and Blessing.\n*   The final instruction is to state the answer \"in alphabetical order\".\n*   Arranging these words alphabetically, we get:\n    1.  Barometer\n    2.  Blessing\n    3.  Blow\n\nThe final answer is this alphabetized list.\n\n<<<Barometer, Blessing, Blow>>>"
