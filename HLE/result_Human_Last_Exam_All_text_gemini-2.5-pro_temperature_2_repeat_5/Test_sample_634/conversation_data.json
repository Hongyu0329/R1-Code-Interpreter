    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user wants to find the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two given 2x2 polynomial matrices, P1 and P2.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Definition of Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD)**\n\n*   A polynomial matrix `R(s)` is a **right divisor** of another polynomial matrix `P(s)` if there exists a polynomial matrix `Q(s)` such that `P(s) = Q(s)R(s)`.\n*   A polynomial matrix `R(s)` is a **common right divisor** of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` if it is a right divisor of both `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`.\n*   A common right divisor `G(s)` is a **GCRD** if any other common right divisor `R(s)` is also a right divisor of `G(s)`.\n*   The GCRD is not unique. If `G(s)` is a GCRD, then `U(s)G(s)` is also a GCRD for any unimodular matrix `U(s)` (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant).\n\n**2. Method: Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\n\nA standard method to find the GCRD of `P1` and `P2` is to use elementary row operations on the stacked matrix `M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]`. The goal is to reduce this matrix to a form `[G(s); 0]`, where `G(s)` is a 2x2 matrix and `0` is the 2x2 zero matrix. The resulting matrix `G(s)` is a GCRD of `P1` and `P2`.\n\nThe elementary row operations are:\ni.  Swapping two rows.\nii. Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\niii. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\n**3. Applying the Method**\n\nThe given matrices are:\n`P1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]`\n`P2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]`\n\n**Step 3.1: Form the stacked matrix M(s)**\nLet `R1`, `R2` be the rows of `P1` and `R3`, `R4` be the rows of `P2`.\n\n`M(s) =`\n`[ s^2 + s,  -s   ] (R1)`\n`[ -s^2 - 1, s^2  ] (R2)`\n`[ s,        0    ] (R3)`\n`[ -s - 1,   1    ] (R4)`\n\n**Step 3.2: Perform elementary row operations**\n\nThe '1' in `R4`'s second column is very useful for elimination. We will use `R4` to make the second column entries of `R1` and `R2` zero.\n\n*   **Operation 1:** `R1 -> R1 + s*R4`\n    `[ (s^2 + s) + s(-s - 1),  -s + s(1) ] = [ s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s ] = [0, 0]`\n\n*   **Operation 2:** `R2 -> R2 - s^2*R4`\n    `[ (-s^2 - 1) - s^2(-s - 1),  s^2 - s^2(1) ] = [ -s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, s^2 - s^2 ] = [s^3 - 1, 0]`\n\nAfter these two operations, the matrix `M(s)` becomes:\n`M'(s) =`\n`[ 0,        0   ] `\n`[ s^3 - 1,  0   ] (R2')`\n`[ s,        0   ] (R3)`\n`[ -s - 1,   1   ] (R4)`\n\nWe have one zero row and three non-zero rows. We need to combine the non-zero rows further. Let's focus on the rows with non-zero entries only in the first column: `R2' = [s^3 - 1, 0]` and `R3 = [s, 0]`. We can reduce these using the polynomial Euclidean algorithm.\n\n*   **Operation 3:** `R2' -> R2' - s^2*R3`\n    `[ (s^3 - 1) - s^2(s), 0 - s^2(0) ] = [ s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0 ] = [-1, 0]`\n\nOur set of non-zero rows has now been transformed into:\n`[ -1, 0 ]` (let's call this `R_A`)\n`[ s, 0 ]` (R3)\n`[ -s - 1, 1 ]` (R4)\n\nNow, we use the simple row `R_A = [-1, 0]` to eliminate the other rows.\n\n*   **Operation 4:** `R3 -> R3 + s*R_A`\n    `[ s + s(-1), 0 + s(0) ] = [ s - s, 0 ] = [0, 0]`\n\n*   **Operation 5:** `R4 -> R4 - (s+1)*R_A`\n    `[ (-s - 1) - (s+1)(-1), 1 - (s+1)(0) ] = [ -s - 1 + s + 1, 1 - 0 ] = [0, 1]`\n\nAfter these operations, the original four rows of `M(s)` have been reduced to two zero rows and two non-zero rows: `[-1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`.\n\n**Step 3.3: Construct the GCRD**\n\nThe non-zero rows form a GCRD matrix. We can arrange them as:\n`G(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1]`\n\n**4. Verification**\n\nWe should verify that `G(s)` is indeed a common right divisor.\n\n*   **Check for P1:** Is `P1 = Q1 * G` for a polynomial matrix `Q1`?\n    `[s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2] = Q1 * [-1, 0; 0, 1]`\n    `[s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2] = [q1_11, q1_12; q1_21, q1_22] * [-1, 0; 0, 1] = [-q1_11, q1_12; -q1_21, q1_22]`\n    This gives `q1_11 = -(s^2+s)`, `q1_12 = -s`, `q1_21 = -(-s^2-1) = s^2+1`, `q1_22 = s^2`.\n    So, `Q1 = [-(s^2+s), -s; s^2+1, s^2]` is a valid polynomial matrix.\n\n*   **Check for P2:** Is `P2 = Q2 * G` for a polynomial matrix `Q2`?\n    `[s, 0; -s - 1, 1] = Q2 * [-1, 0; 0, 1]`\n    `[s, 0; -s - 1, 1] = [q2_11, q2_12; q2_21, q2_22] * [-1, 0; 0, 1] = [-q2_11, q2_12; -q2_21, q2_22]`\n    This gives `q2_11 = -s`, `q2_12 = 0`, `q2_21 = -(-s-1) = s+1`, `q2_22 = 1`.\n    So, `Q2 = [-s, 0; s+1, 1]` is a valid polynomial matrix.\n\n`G(s)` is a common right divisor. The procedure of row reduction guarantees it is a greatest common right divisor.\n\n**Careful Points**\n1.  The elementary row operations must involve polynomial multipliers, not rational functions.\n2.  The order of operations can change the intermediate steps, but the final GCRD will be correct (up to pre-multiplication by a unimodular matrix).\n3.  The determinant of our result `G(s)` is `(-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1`, which is a non-zero constant. This means `G(s)` is a unimodular matrix.\n4.  When the GCRD is a unimodular matrix, the original matrices (`P1` and `P2`) are said to be **right coprime**. The identity matrix `I = [1, 0; 0, 1]` is another valid GCRD, as it is related by `I = [-1, 0; 0, 1] * G(s)`. Any unimodular matrix is a valid answer.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nThe row reduction process on the stacked matrix `[P1; P2]` resulted in a basis for the row space given by the rows `[-1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`. These rows form the GCRD matrix.\n\n<<<[[-1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
