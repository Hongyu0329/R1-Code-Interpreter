    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Definition and Key Properties of Simplicial Volume**\n\nThe simplicial volume of a closed, oriented $n$-manifold $M$, denoted by $\\|M\\|$, is a topological invariant. It is defined as the infimum of the $L_1$-norm of real-valued fundamental cycles of $M$. We will use some well-known properties and formulas to compute it.\n\n**Key Properties:**\n\n1.  **Simplicial Volume of a Surface:** For a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$, its simplicial volume is given by:\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 0$ if $g=0$ (sphere) or $g=1$ (torus).\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2(2g-2) = 4g-4$ if $g \\ge 2$.\n    The surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ for $g \\ge 2$ are hyperbolic, which is a key reason for their non-vanishing simplicial volume.\n\n2.  **Product Formula:** For two closed, oriented manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$ of dimensions $n_1$ and $n_2$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product $M_1 \\times M_2$ satisfies the inequality:\n    $$ \\|M_1 \\times M_2\\| \\ge \\binom{n_1+n_2}{n_1} \\|M_1\\| \\|M_2\\| $$\n    This inequality becomes an equality if at least one of the factors (say $M_1$) admits a map of non-zero degree to a closed, oriented hyperbolic manifold of dimension $n_1$.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Factors $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$**\n\n*   The first manifold is $\\Sigma_{31}$, a closed, oriented surface of genus $g_1 = 31$. Its dimension is $n_1 = 2$.\n*   The second manifold is $\\Sigma_{17}$, a closed, oriented surface of genus $g_2 = 17$. Its dimension is $n_2 = 2$.\n\nSince the genus $g_1 = 31 \\ge 2$, the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$ admits a hyperbolic metric (by the Uniformization Theorem). This means $\\Sigma_{31}$ is itself a closed, oriented hyperbolic manifold of dimension 2. Therefore, the identity map id: $\\Sigma_{31} \\to \\Sigma_{31}$ is a map of degree 1 (which is non-zero) to a hyperbolic manifold. This satisfies the condition for the product formula to be an equality.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Simplicial Volume of Each Factor**\n\nWe use the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g - 4$ for $g \\ge 2$.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{31}$:**\n    The genus is $g_1 = 31$.\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{17}$:**\n    The genus is $g_2 = 17$.\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to confirm that the genera are greater than 1. Since $31 \\ge 2$ and $17 \\ge 2$, both surfaces have non-zero simplicial volumes and are hyperbolic, justifying the use of the formulas above.\n\n### **Step 4: Apply the Product Formula to Get the Final Answer**\n\nSince the condition for equality is met, we use the formula:\n$$ \\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\binom{n_1+n_2}{n_1} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| $$\n\n*   The dimensions are $n_1=2$ and $n_2=2$.\n*   The binomial coefficient is $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$.\n*   Substituting the values we calculated:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64$\n\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    $6 \\times 120 = 720$\n    $720 \\times 64 = 46080$\n\nTherefore, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 46080.\n\n<<<46080>>>"
