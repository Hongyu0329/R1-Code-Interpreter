The Lie group of infinitesimal transformations is represented by the four-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by the following generators:
$X_1 = \partial_t$
$X_2 = \partial_x$
$X_3 = e^{k_1 t} \partial_x - \frac{k_1}{2} e^{k_1 t} x u \partial_u$
$X_4 = e^{k_1 t} u \partial_u$

The general representation for the finite transformations on the coordinate `x`, denoted by $\bar{x}$, generated by a linear combination of the above generators (specifically those affecting `t` and `x`) with coefficients $C_1, C_2, C_3$ and group parameter $\epsilon$, is given by the following two forms:

1.  **If there is no time translation component ($C_1 = 0$):**
    $\bar{x} = x + (C_2 + C_3 e^{k_1 t}) \epsilon$

2.  **If there is a time translation component ($C_1 \neq 0$):**
    $\bar{x} = x + C_2 \epsilon + \frac{C_3}{k_1 C_1} e^{k_1 t} (e^{k_1 C_1 \epsilon} - 1)$
