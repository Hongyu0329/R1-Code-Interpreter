    "Answering the question involves a step-by-step analysis using Galois theory.\n\n### Step 1: Factor the polynomial and identify the splitting field\n\nLet the polynomial be $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe look for a factorization of this polynomial. By grouping terms, we can find:\n$P(x) = x^5(x^2-2) - 9x(x^2-2) + 3(x^2-2)$\n$P(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $Q(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $R(x) = x^2 - 2$. The roots of $P(x)$ are the union of the roots of $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$.\nThe splitting field $K$ of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the compositum of the splitting field of $Q(x)$, let's call it $K_Q$, and the splitting field of $R(x)$, let's call it $K_R$. So, $K = K_Q K_R$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Galois group of each factor\n\n1.  **For $R(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_R = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The degree of this extension is $[K_R : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n    The Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K_R/\\mathbb{Q})$, is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$.\n\n2.  **For $Q(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    *   **Irreducibility:** We apply Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The integer coefficients are $1, 0, 0, -9, 3$. The constant term is $3$.\n        -   $3$ divides all coefficients except the leading one (1).\n        -   $3$ does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n        -   $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3.\n        Therefore, $Q(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Galois Group:** Let $G_Q = \\text{Gal}(K_Q/\\mathbb{Q})$. Since $Q(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, $G_Q$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_5$. The degree of the extension $[K_Q:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is divisible by 5, so $G_Q$ contains an element of order 5 (a 5-cycle).\n    *   **Number of real roots:** To find the structure of $G_Q$, we analyze the real roots of $Q(x)$. The derivative is $Q'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $Q'(x)=0$, so $x^4 = 9/5$, which gives two real roots $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n        -   At $x_{max} = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$, the value is $Q(x_{max}) > 0$.\n        -   At $x_{min} = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$, the value is $Q(x_{min}) < 0$.\n        Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $Q(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    *   The complex conjugation is an automorphism of $K_Q$ that swaps the two complex roots and fixes the three real roots. This automorphism corresponds to a transposition in $G_Q$.\n    *   A known result in group theory states that any subgroup of $S_p$ (for $p$ a prime) that contains a $p$-cycle and a transposition must be the full group $S_p$. Here $p=5$.\n    *   Thus, $G_Q = \\text{Gal}(K_Q/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[K_Q:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the full polynomial\n\nThe Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = \\text{Gal}(K_Q K_R / \\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe structure of this group is given by the direct product of the individual Galois groups if the intersection of the fields is the base field, i.e., $K_Q \\cap K_R = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   $K_R = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a quadratic extension.\n*   The field $K_Q$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $Q(x)$. Since $Q(x)$ has 3 real and 2 complex roots, its discriminant $D$ must be negative ($D < 0$). This means $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is an imaginary quadratic field.\n*   Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real field and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is an imaginary field, they cannot be the same. Their intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   Therefore, $K_Q \\cap K_R = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   This implies that $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_Q/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_R/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\n*   The order of the full Galois group is $|G| = |S_5| \\times |C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n### Step 4: Find the possible degrees of normal sub-extensions\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between intermediate fields $L$ (with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq L \\subseteq K$) and subgroups $H$ of $G$. The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if the corresponding subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. The degree of this extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nThe condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ translates to finding the indices of all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of the direct product $S_5 \\times C_2$ are:\n1.  Products of normal subgroups of $S_5$ and $C_2$:\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ (trivial subgroup, order 1, corresponds to $L=K$)\n    *   $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$ (order 60)\n    *   $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$ (order 120)\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$ (order 2)\n    *   $A_5 \\times C_2$ (order 120)\n    *   $S_5 \\times C_2$ (the whole group, order 240, corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}$)\n2.  \"Skew\" subgroups: There is one additional normal subgroup, let's call it $H_{diag}$. It arises from the quotient isomorphism $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. This subgroup is $H_{diag} = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(g) \\mapsto c \\}$, where sgn is the sign homomorphism. Its order is 120.\n\nThe proper, non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ and their orders $|H|$ are:\n*   $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H| = 60$\n*   $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H| = 120$\n*   $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H| = 2$\n*   $A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H| = 120$\n*   $H_{diag}$: $|H| = 120$\n\nNow we calculate the corresponding degrees $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H| = 240/|H|$:\n*   For $H=A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: Degree = $240/60 = 4$.\n*   For $H=S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: Degree = $240/120 = 2$.\n*   For $H=\\{e\\} \\times C_2$: Degree = $240/2 = 120$.\n*   For $H=A_5 \\times C_2$: Degree = $240/120 = 2$.\n*   For $H=H_{diag}$: Degree = $240/120 = 2$.\n\nCollecting the unique values for the degrees, we find that the possible degrees of such normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are 2, 4, and 120."
