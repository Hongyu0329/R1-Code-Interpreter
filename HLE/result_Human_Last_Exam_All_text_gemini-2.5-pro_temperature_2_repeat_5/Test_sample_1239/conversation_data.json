    "An analysis of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations involves finding all transformations of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ that leave the form of the equations unchanged. This is a classic problem in the field of group analysis of differential equations.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:\n\n**1. The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations**\nIn $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the equations are a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) for the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and the pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$:\n*   Momentum equation: $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n*   Incompressibility condition: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity.\n\n**2. The Concept of a Lie Group of Symmetries**\nA Lie group of symmetries of a system of PDEs is a group of continuous transformations acting on the independent and dependent variables that maps solutions to other solutions. The dimension of this group is the dimension of its Lie algebra, which consists of the infinitesimal generators of these transformations. The standard procedure involves finding all linearly independent infinitesimal generators.\n\n**3. The Infinitesimal Generators**\nThe infinitesimal generators of the symmetry group are vector fields on the space of variables $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p)$. A systematic calculation (by applying the Lie algorithm to the system of PDEs) reveals the set of all such generators. While the full calculation is quite lengthy, the result is well-established in the literature.\n\n**4. The Basis of the Lie Algebra (The Symmetries)**\nThe Lie algebra of point symmetries for the Navier-Stokes equations is composed of generators corresponding to the following physical and mathematical invariances:\n\n*   **Time translation (1 generator):** The equations are autonomous (they do not explicitly depend on time $t$). This gives rise to the generator $\\partial_t$.\n    *   Transformation: $t' = t + \\epsilon$\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n*   **Space translations (3 generators):** The equations are homogeneous in space (they do not explicitly depend on $\\mathbf{x}$). This gives rise to three translation generators, one for each spatial direction: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon \\mathbf{c}$\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n*   **Spatial rotations (3 generators):** The equations are isotropic (invariant under rotations of the coordinate system). This gives rise to three rotation generators, one for each plane of rotation (e.g., $x_1-x_2$ plane). The general form is $\\epsilon_{ijk} x_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} + \\epsilon_{ijk} u_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_k}$.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}'=R\\mathbf{u}$ where $R \\in SO(3)$.\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n*   **Galilean boosts (3 generators):** The equations are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame. This is Galilean relativity. There is one such boost for each spatial direction. The generator for a boost in the $x_i$ direction is $t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t, \\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n*   **Scaling (Dilation) (1 generator):** The equations are invariant under a specific scaling of all variables. The viscosity term $\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$ restricts the possible scalings to a single one-parameter group. The corresponding generator is $2t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} - 2p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\n    *   Transformation: $t' = a^2 t, \\mathbf{x}'= a\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}'=a^{-1}\\mathbf{u}, p'=a^{-2}p$.\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n*   **Pressure shift (1 generator):** Only the gradient of the pressure, $\\nabla p$, appears in the momentum equation. Therefore, the equations are invariant to adding an arbitrary constant to the pressure. The generator is $\\partial_p$.\n    *   Transformation: $p' = p + \\epsilon$\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n**5. Summing the Dimensions**\nThe total dimension of this finite-dimensional Lie algebra is the sum of the number of generators from each category:\nDimension = 1 (time transl.) + 3 (space transl.) + 3 (rotations) + 3 (boosts) + 1 (scaling) + 1 (pressure shift) = 12.\n\n**6. A Careful Point: The Infinite-Dimensional Symmetry**\nIt is crucial to note that the full symmetry algebra of the Navier-Stokes equations is actually infinite-dimensional. This is due to a \"gauge-like\" symmetry in the pressure term. The transformation $p \\to p + g(t,\\mathbf{x})$ leaves the momentum equation unchanged if $\\nabla g = 0$, which means $g$ must be a function of time only, $g=g(t)$. Such a transformation, where $g(t)$ is an arbitrary function, constitutes an infinite-dimensional group of symmetries.\n\nHowever, when asked for \"the dimension\", it is standard practice to refer to the dimension of the *principal* (or *core*) Lie algebra, which is the finite-dimensional part described above. The infinite-dimensional part is often considered a \"trivial\" or \"gauge\" symmetry and is quotiented out or eliminated by imposing physical boundary conditions (e.g., that pressure vanishes at infinity).\n\nTherefore, the standard answer for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is 12."
