    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics of Coiled-Coils**\n\nCoiled-coils are protein structures formed by two or more alpha-helices wrapping around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeating pattern known as a **heptad repeat**, denoted by the positions `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`.\n\n*   Positions `a` and `d` are the **core positions**. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic (water-repelling) amino acids. These residues form the hydrophobic core that holds the helices together.\n*   Positions `b`, `c`, `e`, `f`, and `g` are typically hydrophilic (water-loving) and face the outside, exposed to the solvent.\n*   The \"knobs-into-holes\" model describes how the side chains (knobs) from the `a` and `d` positions of one helix pack into the spaces (holes) created by the side chains on the neighboring helix/helices. The size, shape, and identity of the residues at positions `a` and `d` are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) due to packing efficiency.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Given Sequence and Identify the Heptad Repeat**\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to identify the `a` and `d` positions. We can do this by looking for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues separated by 2, 3, or 4 other residues. The pattern in a coiled-coil is `(a)-x-x-(d)-x-x-x-(a)`. This means the spacing between `a` and `d` is 3 residues, and the spacing between `d` and the next `a` is 4 residues.\n\nLet's mark the hydrophobic residues (I, L, A, W) in the sequence:\nG E **I** **A** Q S **L** K E **I** **A** K S **L** K E **I** **A** **W** S **L** K E **I** **A** Q S **L** K G\n\nLet's test the spacing:\n*   From **I** at position 3 to **L** at position 7: 4 residues apart. (e.g., `d` to `a`)\n*   From **L** at position 7 to **I** at position 10: 3 residues apart. (e.g., `a` to `d`)\n*   From **I** at position 10 to **L** at position 14: 4 residues apart. (e.g., `d` to `a`)\n*   From **L** at position 14 to **I** at position 17: 3 residues apart. (e.g., `a` to `d`)\n\nThis consistent `4, 3, 4, 3...` spacing strongly confirms a heptad repeat structure. This phasing allows us to definitively assign the `a` and `d` positions. If the spacing from one hydrophobic position to the next is 4, it's `d` to `a`. If the spacing is 3, it's `a` to `d`.\n\nBased on this, let's assign the core residues:\n*   **`a` positions:** L (pos 7), L (pos 14), L (pos 21), L (pos 28)\n*   **`d` positions:** I (pos 3), I (pos 10), I (pos 17), I (pos 24)\n\nSo, the core of this coiled-coil is consistently made of **Leucine (L) at the `a` position** and **Isoleucine (I) at the `d` position**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Location of the Tryptophan (W)**\n\nThe very bulky Tryptophan (`W`) is at position 19. Let's find its heptad position based on our established phasing.\n*   The `d` position is at I(17).\n*   The position after `d` is `e`. So, `A` at position 18 is `e`.\n*   The position after `e` is `f`. So, **`W` at position 19 is at an `f` position**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The `W` is a large, hydrophobic residue, which might make one think it must be in the core. However, our careful analysis of the heptad repeat shows it is in an outer `f` position. The oligomeric state is determined by the core `a` and `d` positions, not the solvent-exposed positions. The presence of the `W` at an `f` position is likely a distractor in this problem.\n\n**Step 4: Use Packing Rules to Determine the Oligomeric State**\n\nThe combination of amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions dictates the most efficient packing and thus the oligomeric state. Based on extensive experimental studies:\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored by `L` at `a` and a beta-branched residue like `V` (Valine) at `d`. (e.g., GCN4 protein)\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored by `I` (Isoleucine) at `a` and `L` (Leucine) at `d`.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Strongly favored by **`L` at `a` and `I` at `d`**. It is also favored by `I` at `a` and `I` at `d`.\n\nOur sequence has a consistent core of **`L` at the `a` position and `I` at the `d` position**. According to the principles of knobs-into-holes packing efficiency, this combination is optimal for forming a **tetramer**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the heptad repeat identifies the core positions as `a=L` and `d=I`. This specific combination is known to provide the most stable packing arrangement for a four-helix bundle (a tetramer). Therefore, the predicted oligomeric state is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
