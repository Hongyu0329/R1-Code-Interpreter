    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe query asks for an Oscar-nominated film with a very specific scene. The key elements are:\n1.  The film must be Oscar-nominated.\n2.  A character's fate is sealed.\n3.  This happens when they say the words \"Thank you\".\n4.  The action occurs while the character is boarding a bus.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Analysis of Possibilities**\nThis specific combination of events can be difficult to pinpoint, as memory can often conflate scenes from different movies. Let's analyze potential candidates.\n\n*   **Gangster Films:** Movies like *The Untouchables* or *The Godfather* feature characters whose fates are sealed in an instant. In *The Untouchables* (1987), which was Oscar-nominated, characters are killed in elevators and on the street, but the \"Thank you\" on a bus combination doesn't quite fit. In *The Godfather*, Luca Brasi says \"Thank you\" right before being garroted, but this occurs in a bar, not on a bus.\n*   **Action/Thriller Films:** Many characters meet their end in these films, but the specific polite phrase followed by boarding a bus is not a common trope.\n*   **Drama Films:** This genre is more likely to feature a poignant, fate-sealing moment tied to a quiet line of dialogue and a simple action like boarding a bus.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the Key Details and Identifying the Correct Film**\nThe combination of \"Oscar-nominated,\" \"bus,\" and a pivotal farewell strongly points to the film **Forrest Gump (1994)**. Let's verify each point against the film's events.\n\n1.  **Oscar-Nominated Film:** *Forrest Gump* was a massive success at the Academy Awards. It was nominated for 13 Oscars and won 6, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Director. This criterion is met.\n2.  **The Character and Gender:** The question specifies \"his fate,\" but this may be a minor misremembering. The character in question is the female lead, **Jenny Curran** (played by Robin Wright).\n3.  **The Scene:** The scene occurs after the anti-war rally in Washington, D.C. Forrest and Jenny are briefly reunited. After Forrest beats up her abusive boyfriend, Jenny decides she must leave again.\n4.  **The Dialogue \"Thank you\":** Forrest, not knowing what else to do, gives Jenny his Medal of Honor. As she prepares to get on the bus with her activist friends, she is visibly emotional and says, **\"Thank you\"** to Forrest.\n5.  **Boarding a Bus:** She says this line just before or as she is stepping onto the bus that will take her away from Forrest.\n6.  **Seals Her Fate:** This is the crucial point. Her fate is not sealed by immediate death. Instead, this moment represents her definitive choice to reject a life of safety with Forrest and continue down a self-destructive path of drug use and hardship. By getting on that bus, she seals her long-term fate, which ultimately leads to her contracting the fatal virus (implied to be AIDS) that kills her years later. It is the pivotal moment that sets her on her final, tragic trajectory.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll the core elements of the question—an Oscar-winning film, a pivotal character choice, the specific dialogue \"Thank you,\" and the setting of boarding a bus—align perfectly with this iconic scene from *Forrest Gump*.\n\n<<<Forrest Gump>>>"
