    "An analysis of the question requires breaking it down into three distinct crystallographic conditions and identifying the point groups (crystal classes) that simultaneously satisfy all three.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions of the Three Conditions**\n\n*   **Achiral Crystal Class:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal's point group contains at least one improper rotation axis (rotoinversion axis). This includes a center of symmetry ($\\bar{1}$), a mirror plane (m, which is equivalent to $\\bar{2}$), or other rotoinversion axes ($\\bar{3}, \\bar{4}, \\bar{6}$). Out of the 32 crystal classes, 11 are chiral (lacking any improper rotations) and 21 are achiral.\n*   **Non-polar Crystal Class:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not possess any unique polar axes. A polar axis is a direction [uvw] that is not equivalent to its opposite direction [$\\bar{u}\\bar{v}\\bar{w}$] by any symmetry operation of the point group. The presence of a center of symmetry or a twofold rotation axis/mirror plane perpendicular to a direction renders that direction non-polar. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n*   **Correct Symmetry for Optical Activity:** This is the most crucial condition to interpret correctly. Optical activity (the rotation of the plane of polarized light) is a phenomenon described by the gyration tensor ($g_{ij}$), a second-rank axial tensor. A non-zero gyration tensor is only possible if the crystal class lacks a center of symmetry ($\\bar{1}$). Such classes are termed non-centrosymmetric. While it is commonly stated that only chiral crystals are optically active, this is a simplification. The fundamental symmetry requirement for the possibility of optical activity is the absence of a center of inversion. The 11 centrosymmetric classes ($\\bar{1}$, 2/m, mmm, $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{3}$m, 4/m, 4/mmm, 6/m, 6/mmm, m$\\bar{3}$, m$\\bar{3}$m) are strictly forbidden from showing optical activity. All other 21 non-centrosymmetric classes possess the correct symmetry for a non-zero gyration tensor.\n\n**2. Systematically Filter the 32 Crystal Classes**\n\nWe can partition the 32 crystal classes into three groups based on their symmetry:\n*   **Group 1: Chiral Classes (11)**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432. These are all non-centrosymmetric.\n*   **Group 2: Centrosymmetric Classes (11)**: $\\bar{1}$, 2/m, mmm, $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{3}$m, 4/m, 4/mmm, 6/m, 6/mmm, m$\\bar{3}$, m$\\bar{3}$m. These are all achiral and non-polar.\n*   **Group 3: Non-centrosymmetric Achiral Classes (10)**: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}$2m, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}$m2, $\\bar{4}$3m.\n\nNow, we apply the three conditions from the question to these groups.\n\n*   **Condition 1: Achiral**\n    This eliminates Group 1 (the chiral classes). We are left with Group 2 and Group 3, a total of 21 classes.\n\n*   **Condition 2: Non-polar**\n    We now filter the remaining 21 classes.\n    *   All classes in Group 2 are centrosymmetric, and therefore non-polar. All 11 classes are kept.\n    *   In Group 3, we must identify and remove the polar classes. The polar classes are m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n    *   Removing these leaves the following 5 non-polar classes from Group 3: $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}$2m, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}$m2, $\\bar{4}$3m.\n    *   At this stage, the crystal classes that are both **achiral and non-polar** are the 11 from Group 2 and the 5 from Group 3, making a total of 16 classes.\n\n*   **Condition 3: Correct symmetry for optical activity (i.e., non-centrosymmetric)**\n    We apply this final filter to the 16 classes identified in the previous step.\n    *   This condition eliminates all 11 classes from Group 2, as they are all centrosymmetric.\n    *   This condition keeps all 5 remaining classes from Group 3, as they are non-centrosymmetric by definition of the group.\n\n**3. Final Result**\n\nThe intersection of all three conditions leaves only the five non-centrosymmetric, achiral, and non-polar crystal classes.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Optical Activity vs. Chirality:** The main subtlety is that while chirality guarantees observable optical activity, the fundamental symmetry requirement for the *possibility* of optical activity is being non-centrosymmetric. Achiral, non-centrosymmetric crystals can have a non-zero gyration tensor, although the resulting optical rotation is often masked by linear birefringence and is zero along any optic axes.\n2.  **Polar vs. Non-centrosymmetric:** These terms are not interchangeable. All polar classes are non-centrosymmetric, but not all non-centrosymmetric classes are polar (e.g., class 222).\n3.  **Hermann-Mauguin vs. Schoenflies Notation:** Both systems describe the point groups. The analysis remains the same regardless of notation, but Hermann-Mauguin (International) notation is generally preferred in crystallography. The five resulting classes are:\n    *   $\\bar{4}$ (Schoenflies: S₄)\n    *   $\\bar{4}$2m (Schoenflies: D₂d)\n    *   $\\bar{6}$ (Schoenflies: C₃h)\n    *   $\\bar{6}$m2 (Schoenflies: D₃h)\n    *   $\\bar{4}$3m (Schoenflies: Td)\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric) are:\n\n<<<$\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}$2m, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}$m2, $\\bar{4}$3m>>>"
