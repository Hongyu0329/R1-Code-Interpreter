    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure:** The question is about Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943), a prominent Russian historian, liberal politician, and leader of the Constitutional Democratic (Kadet) Party. Understanding his role is crucial. He was a \"Westernizer,\" meaning he believed Russia should follow a Western path of constitutional democracy and rational progress.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Statement:** Milyukov is said to have \"frequently accused the Western culture of his time.\" This is a key point. His criticism wasn't a wholesale rejection of the West, but a critique of specific cultural trends *within* the West that were influencing Russia during his active years (late 19th - early 20th century).\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Quote:** The quote \"stagnant swamp\" is highly descriptive. A swamp is something that is not flowing, that is decaying, murky, and potentially unhealthy or miasmic. This suggests Milyukov was criticizing a movement he saw as being without purpose, directionless, morbid, and detached from the pressing social and political realities of the day.\n\n4.  **Investigate the Cultural Context:** Milyukov's criticism was directed at the dominant avant-garde artistic and literary movement of the turn of the century in Russia, known as the \"Silver Age.\" This period was characterized by a departure from the 19th-century tradition of social realism. The new movement was heavily influenced by French and other European trends.\n\n5.  **Connect Milyukov to the Movement:** The specific movement that Milyukov so vehemently opposed was **Symbolism**, along with its associated aesthetic of **Decadence**.\n    *   **Symbolism** focused on mysticism, individual spiritual journeys, metaphysics, and \"art for art's sake.\"\n    *   **Decadence** embraced themes of decline, ennui, artificiality, and perverse sensuality.\n    *   Milyukov, as a rationalist and a pragmatist politician, saw this entire cultural sphere as self-indulgent, irrational, pessimistic, and socially useless. He believed artists and intellectuals should contribute to public progress, not retreat into what he perceived as a \"stagnant swamp\" of private mysticism and morbidity.\n\n6.  **Identify \"X-Y\":** Milyukov often conflated these two interconnected movements into a single, pejorative term. He denounced them as **Decadent-Symbolists**. This term fits the \"X-Y\" format perfectly.\n    *   X = Decadent\n    *   Y = Symbolists\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nPavel Milyukov, a rationalist and civic-minded politician, viewed the influential artistic movements of his time, which were inspired by Western European trends, as a retreat from social responsibility. He combined the names of these movements, Decadence and Symbolism, into a single dismissive label, \"X-Y,\" and described their cultural output as a \"stagnant swamp\" because he found it to be morbid, self-absorbed, and useless for the cause of social progress in Russia.\n\n<<<Decadent-Symbolists>>>"
