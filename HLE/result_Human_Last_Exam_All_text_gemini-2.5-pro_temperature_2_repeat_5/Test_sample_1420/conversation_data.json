    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat in a $d=3$ dimensional system, calculated using the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion method from renormalization group (RG) theory.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Theoretical Framework:** The problem is set within the context of critical phenomena and the renormalization group. The standard model for simple phase transitions (like the liquid-gas or ferromagnetic transition) is the Ising model, or its continuum field theory equivalent, the $\\phi^4$ theory. We will assume the Ising universality class, which corresponds to a single-component ($n=1$) order parameter.\n\n2.  **Determine the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** For the Ising/$\\phi^4$ universality class, mean-field theory becomes incorrect below the upper critical dimension, $d_c=4$. Fluctuations become dominant for $d < d_c$.\n\n3.  **Define the Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Parameter:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative technique performed around $d_c$. We define the small parameter $\\epsilon$ as the deviation from the upper critical dimension:\n    $\\epsilon = d_c - d$\n    For our case, the physical dimension is $d=3$. Thus,\n    $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$\n\n4.  **Recall the Relevant Hyperscaling Relation:** The critical exponents are not all independent but are related by scaling laws. The hyperscaling relation (or Josephson's law) connects the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$, and the spatial dimension $d$:\n    $2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\n    This relation is crucial because RG calculations typically provide expressions for $\\nu$ and the anomalous dimension $\\eta$, from which other exponents can be derived.\n\n5.  **Find the $\\epsilon$-Expansion for the Exponent $\\nu$:** Using RG methods for the $\\phi^4$ theory (with a single component order parameter, n=1), the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ can be calculated as a power series in $\\epsilon$. To first order, the well-known result is:\n    $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    Here, the leading term $\\nu = 1/2$ is the mean-field value, and the term proportional to $\\epsilon$ is the first-order correction due to fluctuations.\n\n6.  **Derive the $\\epsilon$-Expansion for $\\alpha$:** Now we substitute the expressions for $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ and the expansion for $\\nu$ into the hyperscaling relation. We will only keep terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$, as this is the standard for a first-order calculation.\n    $2 - \\alpha = (4 - \\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right)$\n    \n    Expand the right-hand side:\n    $2 - \\alpha = \\left(4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon\\right) - \\left(\\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon\\right) + \\dots$\n    \n    $2 - \\alpha = 2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    \n    Combine the terms linear in $\\epsilon$:\n    $2 - \\alpha = 2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $2 - \\alpha = 2 + \\left(\\frac{2-3}{6}\\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $2 - \\alpha = 2 - \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    \n    Now, solve for $\\alpha$:\n    $-\\alpha = -\\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value for $d=3$:** To obtain the estimate for the exponent in three dimensions, we substitute the value $\\epsilon = 1$ into our expression for $\\alpha$.\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6}(1) = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Universality Class:** The result is specific to the Ising universality class ($n=1$). Different systems (e.g., XY model, $n=2$) would have different coefficients in the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n*   **Approximation:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative series. For $d=3$, $\\epsilon=1$, which is not an infinitesimally small parameter. Therefore, the first-order result is an approximation. Higher-order corrections would refine the value. (The experimentally and numerically established value for the 3D Ising model is $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$, while our result is $\\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.167$). However, within the specified method of \"the epsilon expansion to first order,\" this is the correct answer.\n*   **Hyperscaling Validity:** The relation $2-\\alpha=d\\nu$ is only valid for dimensions at and below the upper critical dimension ($d \\le d_c$). The use of $d=4-\\epsilon$ is therefore correct and essential to the derivation.\n\nFinal answer is the result of the first order calculation.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
