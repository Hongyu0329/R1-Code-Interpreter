Based on structural and functional studies of the human voltage-gated calcium channel complex, here are the specific hotspot residues in the human beta-1 subunit (CavÎ²1, UniProt: P54283) for interaction and gating modulation of the alpha-1 subunit.

**1) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction (binding) with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located within the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and form the Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) that physically docks the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit.

*   **W238 (Tryptophan-238):** The most critical residue. It forms a deep hydrophobic anchor point for the AID helix. Mutation of this residue is known to abolish the high-affinity binding between the subunits.
*   **E350 (Glutamic acid-350):** Forms a key electrostatic interaction (salt bridge) with a conserved arginine residue on the alpha-1 subunit's AID.
*   **Other key residues lining the hydrophobic pocket:**
    *   **Y307 (Tyrosine-307)**
    *   **V311 (Valine-311)**
    *   **L347 (Leucine-347)**
    *   **I351 (Isoleucine-351)**
    *   **M368 (Methionine-368)**
    *   **L371 (Leucine-371)**

**2) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (gating modulation) of the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located outside the primary binding interface and allosterically control the channel's function. Mutations at these sites can alter the channel's voltage dependence or kinetics without disrupting the physical binding of the subunit.

*   **Residues on the SH3 Domain Surface:** These residues form a specific patch on the SH3 domain that is crucial for modulating channel inactivation.
    *   **F77 (Phenylalanine-77)**
    *   **L79 (Leucine-79)**
    *   **Y125 (Tyrosine-125)**
*   **Residues on the N-Terminus:** These residues are targets of post-translational modification (phosphorylation) that dynamically regulates the modulatory function of the beta-1 subunit.
    *   **S3 (Serine-3)**
    *   **S4 (Serine-4)**
