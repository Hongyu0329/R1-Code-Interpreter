    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the geometry of the variety X**\n\nLet $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$. The variety $X = C^{(d)}$ is the $d$-th symmetric power of $C$. Its points correspond to effective divisors of degree $d$ on $C$.\nIn our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$.\n\nThere is a fundamental map called the Abel-Jacobi map, $u_d: C^{(d)} \\to \\text{Pic}^d(C)$, which sends an effective divisor $D$ of degree $d$ to its corresponding line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D)$. The target space, $\\text{Pic}^d(C)$, is the variety of line bundles of degree $d$ on $C$. It is a torsor for the Jacobian of $C$, $J(C) = \\text{Pic}^0(C)$, and is isomorphic to $J(C)$ as an algebraic variety.\n\nA key result in the theory of algebraic curves (from Riemann-Roch theorem) states that if the degree $d$ is sufficiently large, specifically if $d \\ge 2g-1$, then the Abel-Jacobi map $u_d$ exhibits $C^{(d)}$ as a projective bundle over $\\text{Pic}^d(C)$.\nLet's check this condition:\n*   $g = 3$, so $2g-1 = 2(3) - 1 = 5$.\n*   $d = 15$.\nSince $15 \\ge 5$, the condition is satisfied.\n\nThe fibers of this bundle are the complete linear systems $|D|$, which are projective spaces $\\mathbb{P}(H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)))$. The dimension of these projective spaces is $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) - 1$.\nBy the Riemann-Roch theorem, $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) - h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) = d - g + 1$.\nBy Serre duality, $h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) = h^0(C, K_C - D)$, where $K_C$ is the canonical divisor.\nThe degree of $K_C - D$ is $(2g-2) - d = (2(3)-2) - 15 = 4 - 15 = -11$. Since the degree is negative, $h^0(C, K_C - D) = 0$.\nTherefore, $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) = d - g + 1 = 15 - 3 + 1 = 13$.\nThe dimension of the fibers is constant and equal to $13 - 1 = 12$.\nSo, $X = C^{(15)}$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over the Jacobian $J(C)$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the rank of NS(X) to the rank of NS(J(C))**\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group, $\\rho(V) = \\text{rank}(\\text{NS}(V))$, is also known as the Picard number of a variety $V$.\nFor a projective bundle $\\pi: P \\to B$, where $P$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^k$-bundle over a smooth projective variety $B$, the Picard number of the total space is related to the Picard number of the base by the simple formula:\n$\\rho(P) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\nThis arises because the divisor classes on $P$ are either pullbacks of divisor classes from $B$ or multiples of the class of the tautological line bundle, with no new relations formed.\nIn our case, $X$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over $J(C)$, so we have:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\nThe problem now is to find the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$, as $C$ varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the range of the Picard number of J(C)**\n\nThe Jacobian $J(C)$ of a genus 3 curve is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. For any abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$, its Picard number $\\rho(A)$ is bounded:\n$1 \\le \\rho(A) \\le h^{1,1}(A)$,\nwhere $h^{1,1}(A) = \\dim H^{1,1}(A, \\mathbb{C}) = g^2$.\nFor $J(C)$, this means $1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n\n**Smallest possible rank:**\nThe smallest Picard number is achieved for a \"generic\" or \"general\" curve.\nFor a general curve $C$ of genus 3, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a simple abelian variety whose ring of endomorphisms is as small as possible: $\\text{End}(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the Néron-Severi group $\\text{NS}(J(C))$ is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\nThus, for a generic curve $C$, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\nThis is the minimum possible value.\nSo, the smallest possible rank for $\\text{NS}(X)$ is:\n$\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**Largest possible rank:**\nThe largest Picard number is achieved for very special curves whose Jacobians have a large ring of endomorphisms, a property known as complex multiplication (CM).\nThe maximum theoretical value is $\\rho(J(C)) = g^2 = 9$. This value is attained if $J(C)$ is an abelian variety of CM-type, where all Hodge classes are algebraic.\nThis requires us to check if there exists a genus 3 curve $C$ for which $\\rho(J(C))=9$.\nSuch curves do exist. A prime example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the plane equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$.\n*   It is a smooth plane curve of degree 4, so its genus is $g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3$.\n*   It is known that its Jacobian, $J(C)$, is isogenous to the product of three copies of a specific elliptic curve, $E \\times E \\times E$, where $E$ is the curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$. This elliptic curve has complex multiplication by the ring of Gaussian integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\nAn abelian variety that is isogenous to a product of CM-elliptic curves has the maximum possible Picard number for its dimension.\nTherefore, for the Fermat quartic curve, $\\rho(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9$.\nThis confirms that the maximum value is attainable.\nSo, the largest possible rank for $\\text{NS}(X)$ is:\n$\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the geometry of the symmetric product and the range of Picard numbers for Jacobians of genus 3 curves, we found the minimum and maximum possible values.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, occurring for a generic genus 3 curve.\nThe largest possible rank is 10, occurring for a special genus 3 curve with complex multiplication, such as the Fermat quartic.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
