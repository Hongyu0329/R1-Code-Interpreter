    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph `G` having exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n\n2.  **Understand Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Graph:** A set of vertices `V` and edges `E`. Here, `|V| = 128`.\n    *   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` consists of the vertices `S` and *all* edges from `E` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n    *   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is a complete graph `K_k`.\n    *   **Induced Clique:** An induced subgraph `G[S]` is a clique if every pair of vertices in `S` is connected in `G`. This is equivalent to `S` being a clique in `G`.\n    *   **Different Clique Sizes:** We are looking for a set of distinct integers `{k_1, k_2, ..., k_m}` such that for each `k_i`, there exists an induced clique of size `k_i` in the graph `G`. Our goal is to maximize `m`, the number of such distinct sizes.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Set of Possible Clique Sizes:**\n    Let `C(G)` be the set of all integers `k` for which there exists an induced clique of size `k` in the graph `G`. We want to find the maximum possible value of `|C(G)|` over all graphs `G` with 128 vertices.\n\n    Let's consider a crucial property of this set `C(G)`.\n    *   Suppose `k` is a number in `C(G)`, and `k > 1`.\n    *   By definition, this means there is a set of vertices `S` with `|S| = k` such that the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a complete graph (`K_k`).\n    *   This implies that every pair of distinct vertices in `S` is connected by an edge.\n    *   Now, consider any subset `S'` of `S` such that `|S'| = k-1`.\n    *   Any two vertices in `S'` are also in `S`. Since all pairs of vertices in `S` are connected, all pairs of vertices in `S'` must also be connected.\n    *   Therefore, the subgraph induced by `S'`, `G[S']`, is a complete graph of size `k-1`.\n    *   This means that `k-1` must also be in the set `C(G)`.\n\n4.  **Characterize the Set C(G):**\n    The property shown in the previous step (`k ∈ C(G) ⇒ k-1 ∈ C(G)` for `k>1`) has a strong implication. If we let `k_max` be the largest clique size present in `G`, then it follows by induction that all integers from `1` to `k_max` must also be in `C(G)`.\n    *   The size of the largest clique in a graph `G` is known as the **clique number**, denoted `ω(G)`.\n    *   So, `k_max = ω(G)`.\n    *   Therefore, for any graph `G`, the set of all possible induced clique sizes is always `C(G) = {1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`.\n\n5.  **Reformulate the Problem:**\n    Based on the analysis above, the number of different clique sizes that can appear in any graph `G` is simply its clique number, `ω(G)`. The problem is thus transformed into finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices.\n    *   The question is equivalent to: \"What is the maximum value of `ω(G)` for a graph `G` with `n=128` vertices?\"\n\n6.  **Solve the Simplified Problem:**\n    The clique number `ω(G)` of a graph `G` on `n` vertices represents the size of a subset of vertices. By definition, the size of this subset cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph.\n    *   Therefore, `ω(G) ≤ n`.\n    *   Can we achieve this upper bound? Yes. Consider the **complete graph** `K_n`, where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n    *   For `n = 128`, we can construct the graph `G = K_{128}`.\n    *   In this graph, the set of all 128 vertices forms a clique. Thus, its clique number is `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices is 128. This means the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is also 128. For the graph `G = K_{128}`, we can find induced cliques of size `k` for every `k` from 1 to 128, so the set of clique sizes is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, and the number of these sizes is 128.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Induced vs. Subgraph:** The word \"induced\" is critical, but in the case of cliques, the distinction is subtle. A set of vertices `S` forms a clique if and only if the subgraph induced by `S` is a complete graph.\n*   **\"Simultaneously Appear\":** This phrase means that for a single, fixed graph `G`, we can find representative induced subgraphs for each of the different clique sizes. It doesn't imply any extra conditions like the subgraphs being vertex-disjoint or maximal.\n*   **The Chain of Logic:** The core of the solution is the realization that the set of induced clique sizes in *any* graph is not an arbitrary set of integers but is always an interval of the form `{1, 2, ..., k}`. Maximizing the size of this set is therefore equivalent to maximizing `k`, the clique number.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\nThe problem asks for the maximum value of `|C(G)|`, where `C(G)` is the set of sizes of induced cliques in a graph `G` with 128 vertices. We have shown that `|C(G)| = ω(G)`. The problem is therefore equivalent to finding the maximum `ω(G)`. For any graph with 128 vertices, `ω(G) ≤ 128`. The graph `K_{128}` achieves this bound, with `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n\n<<<128>>>"
