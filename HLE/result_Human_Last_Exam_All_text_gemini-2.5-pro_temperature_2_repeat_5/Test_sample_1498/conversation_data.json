    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Poem and its Subject:** The poem in question is `'Aqeedat al-'Awaam` (The Creed of the Laymen) by the great scholar Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi al-Maliki. Its purpose is to present the essential tenets of Islamic faith (Aqeedah) in a simple, poetic format for easy memorization.\n\n2.  **Locate the Section on Prophets (Rusul):** One of the fundamental pillars of Islamic faith is the belief in the Prophets and Messengers of God. As expected, the poem dedicates a section to this topic. It first discusses the attributes of the prophets (truthfulness, trustworthiness, conveying the message, and intelligence) before listing their names.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Verses Preceding the List:** We need to find the exact starting point. Let's look at the verses leading up to the list of names:\n    *   **Bayt 30 (Verse 30):**\n        تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ ◈ كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n        *Translation:* \"The details of twenty-five (prophets) are binding upon every legally responsible person, so verify and take this opportunity.\"\n        *Analysis:* This verse serves as an introduction. It *states* that 25 prophets will be detailed, but it does not begin listing their names. Therefore, the list starts *after* this verse.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Verses Containing the List of Names:**\n    *   **Bayt 31 (Verse 31):**\n        هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُهُمْ ◈ مَعَ صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n        *Translation:* \"They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim - each is to be followed.\"\n        *Analysis:* This is the first verse that explicitly begins listing the names of the Prophets. Thus, **the section begins at Bayt 31.**\n\n    *   **Bayt 32 (Verse 32):**\n        لُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا ◈ يَعْقُوبُ يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى\n        *Translation:* \"Lut, Isma'il, and Ishaq, likewise, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed in their path.\"\n        *Analysis:* The list continues.\n\n    *   **Bayt 33 (Verse 33):**\n        شُعَيْبُ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ ◈ ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n        *Translation:* \"Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa, and al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.\"\n        *Analysis:* The list continues further.\n\n    *   **Bayt 34 (Verse 34):**\n        إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ◈ عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n        *Translation:* \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the final seal; leave deviation.\"\n        *Analysis:* This verse concludes the list of the 25 prophets. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is referred to by his title 'Taha'. This is the final verse containing the names. Thus, **the section ends at Bayt 34.**\n\n5.  **Analyze the Verse Following the List:**\n    *   **Bayt 35 (Verse 35):**\n        عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ ◈ وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n        *Translation:* \"Upon them be prayers and peace, and upon their families, as long as the days endure.\"\n        *Analysis:* This verse is a supplication (dua) for the prophets just mentioned. The topic has shifted from listing their names to sending blessings upon them, confirming that the list itself ended in the previous verse.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Starting Point:** Be precise about the starting verse. Verse 30 is introductory and states the number of prophets, but the actual enumeration of names begins in verse 31.\n*   **Ending Point:** The list of names clearly concludes in verse 34 with the final prophet, Muhammad (ﷺ), referred to as 'Taha'.\n*   **Verse Numbering:** The verse numbering for `'Aqeedat al-'Awaam` is highly standardized across most editions, so the range of 31-34 is reliable.\n*   **Reference to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ):** The author uses the title 'Taha' (طَهَ) to refer to the final Prophet, a common practice in classical poetry.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the names of the prophets in Islam are mentioned from Bayt 31 to Bayt 34 of the poem.\n\n<<<From Bayt 31 to Bayt 34>>>"
