    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Objects:**\n    *   **Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**: This is the propagator for a single, non-interacting particle. In quantum field theory, it is the two-point correlation function of the field, computed for a non-interacting system.\n    *   **Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$)**: These are the energy levels for a single particle in the system, defined by the eigenvalue equation for the non-interacting Hamiltonian: $\\hat{H}_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$. The label 'k' represents the set of quantum numbers (e.g., momentum) for that state.\n    *   **Feynman Path Integral Formalism**: This is a method for calculating quantum mechanical amplitudes by summing over all possible field histories (configurations). Each history is weighted by a phase factor $e^{iS/\\hbar}$, where $S$ is the action of that history.\n\n2.  **Write the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$):**\n    The starting point for any path integral calculation is the action. For a non-interacting system (which gives the *bare* Green's function), the action is denoted $S_0$. In position and time coordinates $(x,t)$, it has the general form:\n    $S_0 = \\int dt \\, d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x,t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0 \\right) \\psi(x,t)$\n    Here, $\\psi(x,t)$ is the quantum field (e.g., for an electron).\n\n3.  **Transform to the Energy-Momentum Basis:**\n    The dependence on the eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ becomes explicit when we transform the action into a basis where $\\hat{H}_0$ is diagonal. This is the basis of momentum eigenstates $|k\\rangle$. We perform a Fourier transform in both space and time, moving from $(x, t)$ to momentum-frequency coordinates $(k, \\omega)$.\n    *   The time derivative operator $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ becomes a simple multiplication by the energy variable $\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}_0$ becomes a multiplication by its eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n    The action in the $(k, \\omega)$ domain then becomes a simple sum over all modes:\n    $S_0 = \\sum_{k, \\omega} \\psi^*(k,\\omega) (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi(k,\\omega)$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Green's Function via the Path Integral:**\n    The bare Green's function $G_0$ is the two-point correlation function. In the path integral formalism for a system with a quadratic action (like $S_0$), the two-point function is simply the inverse of the operator appearing between the fields $\\psi^*$ and $\\psi$ in the action. This is a standard result for Gaussian integrals.\n    The operator in the $(k, \\omega)$ domain is the scalar expression $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Fundamental Dependence:**\n    Inverting this operator gives the basic form of the Green's function:\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n    This equation clearly shows an inverse relationship. The function has a pole where the energy variable of the propagator, $\\hbar\\omega$, equals the particle's on-shell energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n6.  **Apply the Feynman Prescription ($i\\delta$):**\n    A key feature of the Feynman path integral is that it inherently computes the *time-ordered* propagator. This specific type of propagator requires a rule for how to integrate around the pole on the real axis. This rule is implemented by adding an infinitesimal imaginary part, $i\\delta$ (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$), to the denominator. The sign of this term depends on whether the state with energy $\\epsilon_k$ is occupied or empty relative to the ground state (the Fermi sea at T=0).\n    *   **For Unoccupied States (particles, $\\epsilon_k > E_F$)**: The propagator describes a particle moving forward in time. The pole is shifted into the lower half of the complex $\\omega$-plane: $\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta$.\n    *   **For Occupied States (holes, $\\epsilon_k < E_F$)**: The propagator describes a hole (the absence of a particle) moving backward in time. The pole is shifted into the upper half of the complex $\\omega$-plane: $\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\delta$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Bare vs. Full:** This analysis applies only to the non-interacting, or *bare*, Green's function $G_0$. Interactions introduce a self-energy term $\\Sigma(k, \\omega)$, which modifies the denominator to $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k - \\Sigma(k, \\omega))^{-1}$.\n*   **Representation:** The simple inverse dependence is manifest in the momentum-frequency $(k, \\omega)$ representation. In position-time space, the relationship is more complex, involving a Fourier transform of this expression.\n*   **Role of the Fermi Level:** The analytical structure of $G_0$ (i.e., the location of its poles in the complex plane) depends crucially on the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ relative to the Fermi energy $E_F$. This distinction between particle and hole excitations is fundamental.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nCombining all the steps, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is captured by the following expression in the momentum-frequency domain:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - E_F)}$\n\nHere, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy (or chemical potential $\\mu$), $\\text{sgn}$ is the signum function, and $\\delta$ is a positive infinitesimal. The dependence is an inverse relationship, with the pole located at $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$, and the nature of the pole's treatment depends on whether $\\epsilon_k$ is above or below the Fermi level.\n\n<<<\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - E_F)}$\n\nwhere $\\hbar\\omega$ is the energy variable, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy, and $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that specifies the analytic properties according to the Feynman prescription.\n>>>"
