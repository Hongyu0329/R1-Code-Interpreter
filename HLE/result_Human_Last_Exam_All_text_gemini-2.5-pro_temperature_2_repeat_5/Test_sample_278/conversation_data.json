    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parametric Curve**\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b \\sin t$. The value of $b$ is piecewise:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $b=1$.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $b=5$.\n\nWe need to analyze these two parts of the curve separately to understand the overall shape.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Part of the Curve ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$)**\n\n*   Equations: $x = \\cos t$, $y = \\sin t$.\n*   This is the standard parametric representation of a circle. The relation $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$ confirms it's a unit circle centered at the origin.\n*   Range of $t$: Since $t$ varies from $0$ to $\\pi$, the y-coordinate $y = \\sin t$ will always be non-negative ($y \\ge 0$).\n*   Tracing the path:\n    *   At $t=0$: $(x, y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n    *   At $t=\\pi/2$: $(x, y) = (\\cos(\\pi/2), \\sin(\\pi/2)) = (0, 1)$.\n    *   At $t=\\pi$: $(x, y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n*   Conclusion for Part 1: This part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of a circle with radius 1, centered at the origin.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Part of the Curve ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$)**\n\n*   Equations: $x = \\cos t$, $y = 5 \\sin t$.\n*   This is the parametric representation of an ellipse. We can see this by rewriting the equations as $x/1 = \\cos t$ and $y/5 = \\sin t$. Squaring and adding gives the standard form of an ellipse: $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$, or $x^2 + y^2/25 = 1$. This is an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis.\n*   Range of $t$: Since $t$ varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, the y-coordinate $y = 5\\sin t$ will always be non-positive ($y \\le 0$).\n*   Tracing the path:\n    *   As $t \\to \\pi^+$: $(x, y) \\to (\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$. This point connects to the end of the first part.\n    *   At $t=3\\pi/2$: $(x, y) = (\\cos(3\\pi/2), 5\\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n    *   As $t \\to 2\\pi^-$: $(x, y) \\to (\\cos(2\\pi), 5\\sin(2\\pi)) = (1, 0)$. This point connects back to the start of the first part, closing the figure.\n*   Conclusion for Part 2: This part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse of the ellipse $x^2 + y^2/25 = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Bounding Box of the Entire Figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates. This defines the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that contains the figure.\n\n*   **X-coordinates:** The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$ for the entire range $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The minimum value of $\\cos t$ is -1 (at $t=\\pi$) and the maximum value is 1 (at $t=0$).\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$\n*   **Y-coordinates:**\n    *   For the upper part ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y = \\sin t$. The maximum value is 1 (at $t=\\pi/2$).\n    *   For the lower part ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y = 5\\sin t$. The minimum value is -5 (at $t=3\\pi/2$).\n    *   Combining both parts, the overall minimum and maximum y-values are:\n    *   $y_{min} = -5$\n    *   $y_{max} = 1$\n\n**Step 5: Find the Dimensions of the Smallest Enclosing Square**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle defined by the boundaries:\n*   $x$ from -1 to 1\n*   $y$ from -5 to 1\n\nThe width of this bounding rectangle is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\nThe height of this bounding rectangle is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe smallest square that can contain this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n*   Side length of the square, $S = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Area of the Square**\n\nThe area of a square with side length $S$ is given by $A = S^2$.\n*   $A = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest square that outcircles the figure has a side length of 6. The area of this square is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
