    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the name of a specific type of book—a \"book of manners\"—that was preserved in the same manuscript as the poem \"Sir Launfal.\" To answer this, we need to:\n1.  Identify the poem \"Sir Launfal\" in question.\n2.  Determine the specific historical manuscript where this poem is found.\n3.  Examine the other contents of that same manuscript.\n4.  Identify which of the other works fits the description of a \"book of manners\" or a courtesy book.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Identifying \"Sir Launfal\":** The question most likely refers to the Middle English romance by Thomas Chestre (late 14th century), which is the most famous version of the story in English. It is distinct from the earlier Old French lai \"Lanval\" by Marie de France.\n2.  **Manuscript Provenance:** Literary works from this period often survive in single manuscripts or a small number of them. Finding the correct manuscript is the crucial link. \"Sir Launfal\" by Chestre is preserved in only one known manuscript.\n3.  **Defining \"Book of Manners\":** This refers to a genre of instructional texts from the medieval and early modern periods, also known as courtesy books. These books offered guidance on etiquette, social conduct, and morals, often for young men serving in noble households.\n4.  **Verifying the Contents:** We must confirm that the identified manuscript contains both \"Sir Launfal\" and a text that is verifiably a \"book of manners.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Poem Identification:** The poem is Thomas Chestre's \"Sir Launfal,\" a Middle English Breton lai.\n2.  **Manuscript Identification:** Research shows that \"Sir Launfal\" survives in a single manuscript: **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, which is housed in the British Library. This is a famous manuscript containing a collection of Middle English romances and other texts from the 15th century.\n3.  **Investigating Manuscript Contents:** By examining the contents list for Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, we find several works bound together. Alongside romances like \"Sir Launfal\" and \"Lybeaus Desconus,\" there is another text.\n4.  **Finding the Book of Manners:** One of the texts included in this manuscript is known as ***The Boke of Curtasye*** (The Book of Courtesy). This text is a classic example of a medieval book of manners. It provides detailed instructions on proper conduct, table etiquette, and the duties of a servant in a lord's household. Therefore, this is the book of manners that \"Sir Launfal\" was preserved alongside.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
