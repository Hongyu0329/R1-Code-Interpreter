    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Film Type:** Hollywood feature film.\n    *   **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n    *   **Character:** A teenager.\n    *   **Key Prop:** A pink bike.\n    *   **Key Action:** The teenager pedals the bike *directly toward* an oncoming car.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   The most specific and unusual detail is the **pink bike**. This is the strongest clue to focus on, as it's a less common prop color than red or blue.\n    *   The action of pedaling \"directly toward an oncoming car\" suggests a moment of confrontation, defiance, or a near-accident.\n    *   The character being a \"teenager\" and the film being from a \"major studio\" helps narrow the search to mainstream cinema, likely from the 1980s onward.\n\n3.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:**\n    *   Many teen movies feature bikes (e.g., *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *The Goonies*), but a pink bike is rare.\n    *   Pee-wee Herman's iconic bike from *Pee-wee's Big Adventure* is famously red and white, and he is an adult character. This film is incorrect.\n    *   Andie from *Pretty in Pink* has a pink car, not a bike. This film is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Film:**\n    *   The combination of a teenager and a pink bike strongly points to the character of **Deb Bradshaw** (played by Tina Majorino) in the 2004 film ***Napoleon Dynamite***.\n    *   Let's verify this film against the criteria.\n\n5.  **Verifying the Film against the Clues:**\n    *   **Hollywood feature film?** Yes, *Napoleon Dynamite* is a well-known feature film.\n    *   **Produced by a major film studio?** It was produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures (an indie division of major studio 20th Century Fox) and MTV Films (a division of major studio Paramount Pictures). This fits the criteria.\n    *   **Teenager?** Yes, Deb is a high school student.\n    *   **Pink bike?** Yes, Deb rides a memorable pink Huffy bicycle.\n    *   **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes. There is a specific scene where Napoleon's brother, Kip, pulls his van out into the street. Deb, riding her bike, is on a direct path toward the van. She continues to pedal toward it for a moment before swerving at the last second. This scene matches the description.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll the elements described in the question—a major studio production, a teenager, a pink bike, and the action of pedaling toward an oncoming vehicle—are present in a key scene from the film *Napoleon Dynamite*.\n\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
