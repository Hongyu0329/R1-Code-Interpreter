    "An analysis of the problem to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge\n\nThe vector field is given in 3D space $(x, y, z)$ as $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$. Let's first analyze the components:\n\n1.  **Coordinates and Functions:**\n    *   It is convenient to use cylindrical coordinates $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$, where $x = \\rho \\cos\\phi$ and $y = \\rho \\sin\\phi$.\n    *   $f = \\text{atan2}(y, x)$ is the azimuthal angle $\\phi$.\n    *   $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{(\\rho^2-0.5)^2 + z^2}$. This represents the distance from the circle defined by $\\rho = \\sqrt{0.5}$ and $z=0$.\n    *   $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$. $G$ is a function of $\\rho$ and $z$ only.\n    *   The vector field components are $n_x = \\sin(G) \\cos(f)$, $n_y = \\sin(G) \\sin(f)$, $n_z = \\cos(G)$.\n\n2.  **Field Structure:**\n    *   This is a unit vector field since $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = \\sin^2(G)(\\cos^2(f)+\\sin^2(f)) + \\cos^2(G) = 1$.\n    *   The structure of $\\mathbf{n}$ is that of a spherical coordinate system on the target space (a unit sphere $S^2$), where $G$ acts as the polar angle and $f$ as the azimuthal angle.\n\n3.  **Boundary Conditions:**\n    *   As any of $|x|, |y|, |z| \\to \\infty$, the radial distance $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} \\to \\infty$, which implies $r_2 \\to \\infty$.\n    *   As $r_2 \\to \\infty$, $G = \\pi e^{-10r_2} \\to 0$.\n    *   Thus, $\\mathbf{n} \\to (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)$.\n    *   The field approaches a constant vector at infinity. This means we can consider the domain $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to be compactified to a 3-sphere ($S^3$), and the field $\\mathbf{n}$ defines a map from $S^3$ to $S^2$. The Hopf charge is the winding number of this map, an integer belonging to $\\pi_3(S^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 2: The Whitehead Formula and Its Challenges\n\nThe Whitehead formula for the Hopf charge $Q_H$ is:\n$Q_H = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\, d^3x$\nwhere $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$ is an emergent magnetic field given by its components $B_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\epsilon_{ijk} \\, \\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\partial_j \\mathbf{n} \\times \\partial_k \\mathbf{n})$.\n\n1.  **Calculating the Emergent Field B:**\n    Using the structure $\\mathbf{n}(G(\\rho,z), f(\\phi))$, one can show that $\\mathbf{B} = \\sin(G) (\\nabla G \\times \\nabla f)$.\n\n2.  **Finding a Vector Potential A:**\n    We need to find $\\mathbf{A}$ such that $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{B}$. A valid choice (a \"gauge choice\") is $\\mathbf{A} = -\\cos(G) \\nabla f$. Let's check this:\n    $\\nabla \\times (-\\cos(G)\\nabla f) = -\\nabla(\\cos G) \\times \\nabla f = -(-\\sin G \\nabla G) \\times \\nabla f = \\sin G (\\nabla G \\times \\nabla f) = \\mathbf{B}$.\n    This seems to be a correct potential.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Integrand A ⋅ B:**\n    Let's compute the dot product:\n    $\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = (-\\cos(G)\\nabla f) \\cdot (\\sin(G) (\\nabla G \\times \\nabla f))$\n    $= -\\sin(G)\\cos(G) [\\nabla f \\cdot (\\nabla G \\times \\nabla f)]$\n    The triple product $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v})$ is always zero because the resulting vector is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{v}$. Thus, $\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$.\n\n4.  **Careful Point: Singularities:**\n    The calculation above assumes the fields are well-behaved. However, the potential $\\mathbf{A} = -\\cos(G)\\nabla f$ has a singularity. In cylindrical coordinates, $\\nabla f = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\hat{\\phi}$. So $\\mathbf{A} = -\\frac{\\cos G}{\\rho}\\hat{\\phi}$. This potential is singular along the z-axis ($\\rho=0$), where the coordinate $f=\\phi$ is not defined. The direct calculation of the integral $\\int \\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}\\,d^3x$ is zero everywhere the integrand is defined, but this approach fails to account for the singularity. Such issues are common when using the Whitehead integral with fields possessing axial symmetry.\n\n### Step 3: Topological Interpretation (Linking Number)\n\nA more robust method for this type of problem is to use the topological definition of the Hopf invariant, which is the linking number of the preimages of two regular points in the target space $S^2$.\n\n1.  **Choose two points on the target sphere S²:**\n    *   Let's pick the South Pole, $P_S = (0, 0, -1)$.\n    *   Let's pick an equatorial point, $P_E = (1, 0, 0)$.\n\n2.  **Find the preimage of the South Pole:**\n    The condition $\\mathbf{n} = (0, 0, -1)$ requires:\n    *   $\\cos(G) = -1 \\implies G = \\pi$ (since $0 < G \\le \\pi$).\n    *   $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1 \\implies r_2 = 0$.\n    *   $r_2 = \\sqrt{(\\rho^2-0.5)^2 + z^2} = 0 \\implies z=0$ and $\\rho^2 = 0.5$.\n    *   The preimage of the South Pole is a circle in the $z=0$ plane with radius $\\rho = \\sqrt{0.5}$. Let's call this circle $C_S$.\n\n3.  **Find the preimage of the equatorial point:**\n    The condition $\\mathbf{n} = (1, 0, 0)$ requires:\n    *   $\\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G = \\pi/2$.\n    *   $\\sin(G)\\cos(f)=1 \\implies (1)\\cos(f)=1 \\implies f=0$.\n    *   $\\sin(G)\\sin(f)=0 \\implies (1)\\sin(f)=0 \\implies f=0$.\n    *   The condition $f=0$ corresponds to the half-plane $y=0, x>0$.\n    *   The condition $G=\\pi/2$ means $\\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2 \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2 \\implies r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\n    *   So, we must satisfy $(\\rho^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$ on the half-plane $y=0, x>0$.\n    *   In cartesian coordinates, this is $(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$ for $y=0, x>0$. This equation describes a closed loop in the $xz$-plane. This loop, let's call it $C_E$, is centered around the point $(x=\\sqrt{0.5}, z=0)$ in that plane.\n\n4.  **Determine the Linking Number:**\n    *   We have two curves:\n        *   $C_S$: A circle of radius $\\sqrt{0.5}$ in the $xy$-plane, centered at the origin.\n        *   $C_E$: A loop in the $xz$-plane, surrounding the point $(x=\\sqrt{0.5}, z=0)$.\n    *   The circle $C_S$ lies in the $xy$-plane and passes through the point $(\\sqrt{0.5}, 0, 0)$.\n    *   The loop $C_E$ lies in the perpendicular $xz$-plane and encircles this exact point $(\\sqrt{0.5}, 0, 0)$.\n    *   Therefore, the circle $C_S$ threads through the loop $C_E$ exactly once.\n    *   This means the linking number of the two curves is $\\text{Link}(C_S, C_E) = \\pm 1$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe Hopf charge is an integer. The topological structure of the field corresponds to the fundamental hopfion configuration, which is characterized by a Hopf charge of 1. The signs are a matter of convention, but the magnitude is 1. The specific numerical parameters (0.5 and 10) define the size and localization of the field structure but do not alter its topological nature, so the Hopf charge remains invariant. Therefore, the Hopf charge is 1.\n\nThe answer is 1.\n\n>>>1"
