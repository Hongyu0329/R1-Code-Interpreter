    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understanding the Group and the Question**\n\n*   **The Group:** The group is the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n*   **Group Presentation:** The standard presentation for a generalized quaternion group of order $2^{n+1}$ is $Q_{2^{n+1}} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^n} = 1, x^{2^{n-1}} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    For size 128, we have $2^{n+1} = 128 = 2^7$, which means $n+1=7$ and thus $n=6$.\n    The presentation for $Q_{128}$ is:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **The Question:** The question asks for the number of \"power subgroups\". A power subgroup is another name for a **cyclic subgroup**, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group.\n\n**2. Strategy for Counting Cyclic Subgroups**\n\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be uniquely written as $x^k$ or $x^k y$, where $0 \\le k < 64$. The group consists of two main parts:\n*   The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$, which is a cyclic group of order 64.\n*   The set of the remaining 64 elements, which can be represented by the coset $\\langle x \\rangle y = \\{x^k y \\mid 0 \\le k < 64 \\}$.\n\nWe can find all unique cyclic subgroups by counting the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements from each of these two parts and then summing them up, ensuring there are no overlaps.\n\n**3. Counting Cyclic Subgroups from $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\n*   The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64.\n*   **Careful Point:** A fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that a cyclic group of order $N$ has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $N$. The number of subgroups is thus $d(N)$, the number of divisors of $N$.\n*   For $\\langle x \\rangle$, the order is $N=64$. Since $64 = 2^6$, the number of divisors is $d(64) = 6+1=7$.\n*   These 7 subgroups are all cyclic and are generated by powers of $x$. Specifically, they are $\\langle 1 \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^2 \\rangle$, and $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   So, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**4. Counting Cyclic Subgroups from Elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\n*   These are the elements of the form $g_k = x^k y$, where $0 \\le k < 64$. There are 64 such elements.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must first determine the order of these elements. Let's compute the square of an arbitrary such element:\n    $(x^k y)^2 = (x^k y)(x^k y) = x^k (y x^k y^{-1}) y^2$.\n    Using the relation $y x^k y^{-1} = (yxy^{-1})^k = (x^{-1})^k = x^{-k}$, we get:\n    $(x^k y)^2 = x^k (x^{-k}) y^2 = 1 \\cdot y^2 = x^{32}$.\n*   The element $x^{32}$ is of order 2 (since $(x^{32})^2=x^{64}=1$ and $x^{32} \\ne 1$).\n*   Since $(x^k y)^2 = x^{32} \\ne 1$, the order of $x^k y$ is not 2.\n*   Taking the square again: $(x^k y)^4 = ((x^k y)^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   Therefore, every element of the form $x^k y$ has an order of **4**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Now we need to count how many distinct cyclic subgroups are generated by these 64 elements of order 4. A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators (where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function).\n*   Let's find the other generator of the subgroup $\\langle x^k y \\rangle$. The generators are $g=x^k y$ and $g^3$.\n    $(x^k y)^3 = (x^k y)^2 (x^k y) = x^{32} (x^k y) = x^{k+32} y$.\n*   This means the elements $x^k y$ and $x^{k+32} y$ generate the same cyclic subgroup. The 64 elements form $64/2 = 32$ pairs, with each pair generating a unique cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n*   So, there are **32** distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**5. Combining the Counts and Final Answer**\n\n*   We have found 7 cyclic subgroups that are subsets of $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   We have found 32 cyclic subgroups that are generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must confirm that these two sets of subgroups are disjoint. A subgroup from the first set is entirely contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$. A subgroup from the second set, like $\\langle x^k y \\rangle$, contains elements ($x^k y$ and $x^{k+32}y$) that are not in $\\langle x \\rangle$. Therefore, no subgroup can be in both sets. The two sets are disjoint.\n*   The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both sets.\n*   Total Number = (Subgroups within $\\langle x \\rangle$) + (Subgroups generated by elements outside $\\langle x \\rangle$)\n*   Total Number = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{39}$.\n<<<39>>>"
