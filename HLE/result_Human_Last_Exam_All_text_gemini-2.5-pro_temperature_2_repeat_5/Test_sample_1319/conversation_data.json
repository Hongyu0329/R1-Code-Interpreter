    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for the **tallest historical mountain** that is **mentioned in the Iliad**, with the specific exclusion of **Mount Olympus**.\n\n*   **Mentioned in the Iliad:** The mountain must be explicitly named or clearly referenced within the text of Homer's epic.\n*   **Historical Mountain:** The mountain must be a real, identifiable geographic location, not a purely mythological or unlocatable place.\n*   **After Mount Olympus:** We must first identify Mount Olympus as the tallest and then find the second tallest among the remaining candidates.\n\n### Step 2: List the Historical Mountains Mentioned in the Iliad\n\nA search of the *Iliad* reveals several real-world mountains that are used as settings or reference points:\n\n1.  **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, located in northern Greece. It is the most frequently mentioned mountain and serves as the benchmark for height.\n2.  **Mount Ida:** Located near Troy (in modern-day Turkey, now known as Kaz Dağı). It is a crucial location in the epic, most famously used by Zeus as a vantage point to watch the Trojan War.\n3.  **Mount Athos:** A mountain and peninsula in northeastern Greece. In Book 14, the goddess Hera is described flying over it on her journey from Olympus to Ida.\n4.  **Mount Samothrace (now Mount Fengari or Saos):** The highest peak on the island of Samothrace. In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits on its summit to watch the battle from across the sea.\n5.  **Mount Pelion:** A mountain in Thessaly, Greece, located south of Mount Olympus. It is mentioned in reference to the great ash spear of Achilles, which was cut from its summit.\n6.  **Mount Tmolus (now part of the Bozdağlar range):** A mountain in Lydia (western Turkey). It is mentioned once in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as \"snowy Tmolus,\" describing the homeland of the Maeonian soldiers.\n\n### Step 3: List Careful Points for Consideration\n\n*   **The Two Mount Idas:** It is critical to distinguish between Mount Ida near Troy (mentioned in the *Iliad*) and the taller Mount Ida on Crete (which is central to the mythology of Zeus's birth but is not the setting in the *Iliad*). The question refers specifically to the mountain near Troy.\n*   **Reference vs. Setting:** Some mountains are major settings (Olympus, Ida), while others are mentioned in passing as geographical markers (Athos, Tmolus, Pelion). All mentions, however, qualify them for inclusion in our list.\n*   **Accuracy of Elevation:** Modern established elevations must be used to compare the heights accurately.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Elevations and Determine the Ranking\n\nNow, we list the mountains with their respective elevations to find the correct order.\n\n1.  **Mount Olympus:** **2,918 meters** (9,573 feet) - This is the tallest.\n2.  **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ):** **2,159 meters** (7,083 feet)\n3.  **Mount Athos:** **2,033 meters** (6,670 feet)\n4.  **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** **1,774 meters** (5,820 feet)\n5.  **Mount Pelion:** **1,624 meters** (5,328 feet)\n6.  **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** **1,611 meters** (5,285 feet)\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the ranking, Mount Olympus is confirmed as the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad*. The next tallest on the list is Mount Tmolus. Although it is only mentioned once, it is a clear geographical reference to a historical mountain whose elevation makes it second only to Olympus among the mountains named in the epic.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
