    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity for the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Function\nThe algorithm takes an integer `n` and a base `c` and computes the representation of `n` in base `c`. It does this by repeatedly finding the remainder and the quotient of `n` when divided by `c`.\n\n*   `a_0 = n mod c` is calculated as `n - ⌊n/c⌋ * c`.\n*   Then `n` is replaced by the quotient `q = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n*   This process repeats until the quotient `q` becomes 0.\n*   The sequence of remainders `(a_i, a_{i-1}, ..., a_0)` is the base-c representation of `n`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Cost of a Single Step/Iteration\n\nThe algorithm consists of an initialization part (Step 1) and a `while` loop (Step 2).\n*   **Initialization (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0; x := n;`: Two assignment operations.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: One integer division.\n    *   `a_0 := x — qc;`: One multiplication and one subtraction.\n    All these are considered basic arithmetic operations.\n\n*   **Loop Body (Step 2.1):**\n    *   `i := i + 1;`: One increment.\n    *   `x := q;`: One assignment.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: One integer division.\n    *   `a_i := x — qc;`: One multiplication and one subtraction.\n    All these are also basic arithmetic operations.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The primary assumption for this analysis is that basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on numbers that fit within a computer's word size take constant time, denoted as `O(1)`. This is a standard assumption in algorithm analysis unless dealing with arbitrarily large numbers (bignums).\n\nUnder this assumption, both the initialization step and a single iteration of the `while` loop have a constant time cost, `O(1)`.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Loop Iterations\n\nThe computational time complexity is dominated by the `while` loop. The total time will be the number of loop iterations multiplied by the cost per iteration. Since the cost per iteration is `O(1)`, we need to find the number of times the loop executes.\n\n*   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n*   The value of `q` is calculated as `q := ⌊x/c⌋`.\n*   In each iteration, the value of `x` for the next iteration is the current `q`. So, the effective value being processed is divided by `c` at each step.\n\nLet's trace the value of `x` (which determines `q`):\n*   Initially, `x = n`. The first quotient is `q_0 = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n*   After the 1st iteration, the new `x` becomes `q_0`. The next quotient is `q_1 = ⌊q_0/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c^2⌋`.\n*   After the k-th iteration, the quotient is `q_k = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n\nThe loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊x/c⌋ = 0`, which means `x < c`. The number of times we can divide `n` by `c` until it becomes less than `c` determines the number of iterations.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The number of iterations is related to the number of digits in the base-c representation of `n`. A number `n` has `k+1` digits in base `c` if `c^k ≤ n < c^(k+1)`.\n\nBy taking `log_c` of this inequality, we get: `k ≤ log_c(n) < k+1`.\nThis implies that `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\nThe algorithm computes digits from `a_0` to `a_k`. The loop counter `i` goes from `1` to `k`. Therefore, the `while` loop executes exactly `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n\nThe number of iterations is `Θ(log_c n)`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Time Complexity\n\nThe total time complexity `T(n)` is the sum of the costs of the initialization and the loop.\n\n`T(n) = (Cost of Initialization) + (Number of Iterations) * (Cost per Iteration)`\n`T(n) = O(1) + ⌊log_c(n)⌋ * O(1)`\n`T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c n)`\n`T(n) = O(log_c n)`\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Since the number of iterations is exactly `⌊log_c(n)⌋`, we can use the more precise Big-Theta notation.\nThe time complexity is `Θ(log_c n)`.\n\n**Careful Point 4:** The base of the logarithm does not affect the asymptotic complexity class, because of the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c ≥ 2` is a constant, `1 / log_b(c)` is also a constant factor. Thus, `Θ(log_c n)` is equivalent to `Θ(log n)`. It is conventional to omit the base of the logarithm. However, writing `Θ(log_c n)` is more specific and equally correct.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe algorithm's execution time is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The number of iterations is directly proportional to the number of digits in the base-c representation of `n`, which is logarithmically related to the value of `n`. Therefore, the computational time complexity is `Θ(log_c n)`.\n\n<<<Θ(log_c n)>>>"
