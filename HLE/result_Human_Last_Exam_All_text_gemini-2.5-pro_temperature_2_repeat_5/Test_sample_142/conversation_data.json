    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms and total number of electrons ($N_{elec}$):**\n    *   The molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. It contains one Carbon (C), three Hydrogen (H), one Silicon (Si), and one Fluorine (F) atom.\n    *   We sum the number of electrons for each atom:\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron each, so $3 \\times 1 = 3$ electrons\n        *   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n        *   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n    *   Total number of electrons, $N_{elec} = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of basis functions (spatial orbitals, $N_{orb}$):**\n    *   The basis set is 6-31G**. This is a Pople-style basis set.\n    *   The notation `6-31G` describes the contraction scheme for the core and valence atomic orbitals.\n    *   The `**` (also written as `(d,p)`) indicates the addition of polarization functions:\n        *   The first `*` adds d-type polarization functions to all heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n        *   The second `*` adds p-type polarization functions to all hydrogen atoms.\n    *   For such calculations, it is standard to use 6 Cartesian d-functions and 3 Cartesian p-functions.\n    *   Let's count the number of basis functions for each atom:\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):**\n            *   6-31G: 2 s-type functions.\n            *   `**`: Adds 3 p-type functions (px, py, pz).\n            *   Total per H: $2 + 3 = 5$ functions.\n        *   **Carbon (C, a second-row atom):**\n            *   6-31G: 9 functions (1s, 2s', 2p', 2s'', 2p'').\n            *   `*`: Adds 6 d-type functions.\n            *   Total per C: $9 + 6 = 15$ functions.\n        *   **Fluorine (F, a second-row atom):**\n            *   Same as Carbon. Total per F = $9 + 6 = 15$ functions.\n        *   **Silicon (Si, a third-row atom):**\n            *   6-31G: 13 functions (1s, 2s, 2p, 3s', 3p', 3s'', 3p'').\n            *   `*`: Adds 6 d-type functions.\n            *   Total per Si: $13 + 6 = 19$ functions.\n    *   The total number of basis functions is the sum for all atoms in the molecule:\n        *   $N_{orb}$ = (1 * C) + (3 * H) + (1 * Si) + (1 * F)\n        *   $N_{orb} = 15 + (3 \\times 5) + 19 + 15 = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64$.\n\n3.  **Choose the correct formula for the number of CSFs.**\n    *   A full CI calculation for a closed-shell molecule like $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ typically seeks the singlet ground state ($S=0$).\n    *   The number of singlet CSFs for a system with $N_{elec}$ electrons in $N_{orb}$ spatial orbitals is given by a well-known formula in quantum chemistry.\n    *   Let $K = N_{orb} = 64$ and $m = N_{elec} / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16$.\n    *   The formula is:\n        $N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\binom{K}{m}^2 - \\binom{K}{m-1}\\binom{K}{m+1}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of CSFs.**\n    *   Substitute $K=64$ and $m=16$ into the formula:\n        $N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15}\\binom{64}{17}$\n    *   We need to calculate these binomial coefficients, which requires high-precision arithmetic.\n        *   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16! \\cdot 48!} = 3,613,784,722,295$\n        *   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15! \\cdot 49!} = 1,179,929,701,560$\n        *   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17! \\cdot 47!} = 10,203,627,451,185$\n    *   Now, plug these values into the formula:\n        *   $N_{CSF} = (3,613,784,722,295)^2 - (1,179,929,701,560 \\times 10,203,627,451,185)$\n        *   $N_{CSF} = 13,059,441,113,271,576,483,482,025 - 12,039,775,586,676,834,169,994,600$\n        *   $N_{CSF} = 1,019,665,526,594,742,313,487,425$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of CSFs for the specified calculation is determined by the number of electrons (32) and the number of basis functions (64). Using the formula for singlet CSFs, we arrive at the final number.\n\n<<<1019665526594742313487425>>>"
