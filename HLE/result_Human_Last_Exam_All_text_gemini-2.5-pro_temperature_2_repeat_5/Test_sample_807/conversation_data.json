    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Compound:** The question provides the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) name for a chemical: 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.\n2.  **Find the Common Name:** The first step is to determine the common name for this complex chemical. A search for this specific chemical name reveals that it is **Rhodamine B**.\n3.  **Determine the Properties of the Chemical:** Rhodamine B is a well-known synthetic chemical dye. Its primary characteristic is its color. It is known for producing a brilliant, fluorescent reddish-pink to magenta color, both as a powder and especially when dissolved in a solution. It is also referred to by its Colour Index number, C.I. 45170.\n4.  **Connect the Chemical to Crayola Crayons:** The next step is to find which Crayola crayon color uses or has used Rhodamine B as a pigment.\n    *   Historical research shows that in 1990, Crayola's parent company, Binney & Smith, introduced a new set of fluorescent (or \"Day-Glo\") crayon colors.\n    *   Analysis of these original fluorescent crayons revealed that some of them contained pigments that had not been certified for use in art materials intended for children. Rhodamine B was one of these pigments.\n    *   Due to regulatory concerns from the Art and Creative Materials Institute (ACMI), Crayola voluntarily recalled the crayons containing this pigment.\n    *   The specific crayon color identified as containing Rhodamine B (C.I. 45170) in its original 1990 formulation was **Hot Magenta**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Chemical Nomenclature:** The provided name is a precise chemical descriptor. Correctly identifying it as Rhodamine B is the crucial first step.\n*   **Historical Context:** The use of this chemical in Crayola crayons is a historical fact. Crayola no longer uses unapproved pigments like Rhodamine B. The question asks what color \"contains\" it, which in this case refers to its historical formulation.\n*   **Color of the Pigment:** The color of the pigment (magenta) directly corresponds to the name of the crayon color (Hot Magenta), which adds confidence to the answer.\n*   **Specificity:** While other fluorescent colors were also part of the 1990s recall, \"Hot Magenta\" is the color most specifically and widely documented as having contained Rhodamine B.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is the pigment Rhodamine B. This pigment was used in the original formulation of the Crayola crayon color Hot Magenta, which was introduced and subsequently recalled in the early 1990s.\n\n<<<Hot Magenta>>>"
