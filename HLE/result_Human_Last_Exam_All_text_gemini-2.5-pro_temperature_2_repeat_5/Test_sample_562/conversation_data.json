    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the character 謄.**\nThe character 謄 is a compound kanji, meaning it is made up of multiple simpler components. It follows a common left-right structure.\n*   The left-side component is: 言\n*   The right-side component is: 朕 without the 月 part, a phonetic component.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the radical (部首, bushu).**\nIn kanji with a left-right structure, the left part often serves as the radical, indicating the general semantic category of the character.\n*   The left component, 言, means \"word,\" \"speech,\" or \"say.\"\n*   The meaning of 謄 is \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which is directly related to words and writing.\n*   Therefore, the radical of 謄 is 言.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Japanese name for the radical based on its position.**\nJapanese has specific names for radicals depending on where they appear in a character.\n*   When a radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n*   The radical 言 is read as \"gon\" or \"gen\".\n*   When it is the left-side radical, its specific name is \"gonben\" (ごんべん). The \"ben\" is a sound change from \"hen\". This follows the same pattern as the example provided (媛), where the radical 女 (onna) on the left is called \"Onnahen\".\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Japanese name into Hepburn romanization.**\nThe final step is to write the Japanese name \"ごんべん\" using the Hepburn system of romanization.\n*   ご -> go\n*   ん -> n\n*   べ -> be\n*   ん -> n\n*   Combining these gives \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Decomposition:** Be careful to correctly identify the main components. The character has a clear left-right split. The left part, 言, is a very common radical.\n*   **Radical Naming Convention:** Remember that the name of a radical changes with its position. A radical on the left is a \"hen\", on top is a \"kanmuri\", on the bottom is an \"ashi\", etc.\n*   **Pronunciation and Romanization:** Ensure the Japanese name (Gonben) is correctly identified and transcribed into Hepburn romanization, which is the standard for Japanese. Don't confuse it with other romanization systems.\n\nFollowing these steps, the radical of 謄 is 言, which is called \"Gonben\" when it is on the left side of a character.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
