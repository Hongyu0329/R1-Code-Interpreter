    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary task is to read a string representing a mathematical sum (e.g., \"3+2+1\") and rearrange the numbers in non-decreasing order (e.g., \"1+2+3\").\n2.  **Input Constraints:** The input string `s` contains only digits from '1' to '4' and the '+' symbol. It's a valid sum, meaning numbers and '+' signs alternate. The maximum length of `s` is 1000 characters.\n3.  **Core Logic:** The problem is equivalent to sorting the numbers present in the string. Since the set of possible numbers is very small (only 1, 2, 3, 4), the most efficient way to \"sort\" them is to count the occurrences of each number. This method is known as Counting Sort.\n4.  **Memory Efficiency Goal:** The crucial part of the request is to find the memory usage of the *most memory-efficient* C program. This implies we should avoid storing data unnecessarily.\n5.  **Identifying Memory Optimization:** A standard approach might be to read the entire string into a character array buffer, like `char s[1001];`. This would immediately consume 1001 bytes. However, we can solve the problem without storing the string. We can process the input one character at a time as a stream.\n6.  **Developing the Most Memory-Efficient Algorithm:**\n    *   **Counting:** We will read the input character by character using a function like `getchar()`. We do not need to store the whole string. We only need to count how many '1's, '2's, '3's, and '4's appear. We can use a small integer array, say `counts[4]`, for this purpose. `counts[0]` will store the count of '1's, `counts[1]` for '2's, and so on.\n    *   **Printing:** After counting is complete, we can construct the output string directly by printing. We will first print all the '1's (the number of which is stored in `counts[0]`), then all the '2's, etc., separated by '+' signs.\n    *   **Handling Separators:** A simple way to correctly place the '+' signs is to first calculate the total number of summands. Then, as we print each number, we decrement a counter. We print a '+' only if the counter is not yet zero, ensuring no '+' is printed after the last number.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **String Buffer Avoidance:** The key to minimizing memory is to *not* declare a large character array (e.g., `char s[1001]`) to hold the input. Processing the input as a stream with `getchar()` is the optimal approach.\n2.  **Data Types:** To calculate memory usage, we must consider the size of the variables. On most competitive programming platforms, `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes. The counts of numbers can exceed 255 (e.g., a string of 1000 '1's and '+'s would have 500 '1's), so a `char` is insufficient for the `counts` array; an `int` or `short` is necessary. We will use `int` as is standard practice.\n3.  **`getchar()` Return Type:** The variable that stores the result of `getchar()` must be an `int`, not a `char`, to correctly handle the special `EOF` (End of File) value.\n4.  **Variable Minimization:** The program requires a minimal set of variables: an array for counts, a variable for `getchar()`, a loop counter, and a helper variable for printing '+' correctly.\n\n### Step-by-Step Memory Calculation\n\nLet's devise the C program mentally and count the memory for its variables.\n\n```c\n// Hypothetical memory-efficient C code\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // 1. Array to store counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.\n    // Indexed 0-3 for numbers '1'-'4'. Max count can be 500.\n    // int is 4 bytes. 4 * 4 = 16 bytes.\n    int counts[4] = {0};\n\n    // 2. Variable to read characters from input. Must be int for EOF.\n    // 4 bytes.\n    int c;\n\n    // 3. Variable to hold the total count of numbers for printing logic.\n    // 4 bytes.\n    int total_numbers = 0;\n\n    // Reading and counting phase\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n            total_numbers++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // 4. A loop counter variable.\n    // 4 bytes.\n    int i;\n\n    // Printing phase\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        while (counts[i] > 0) {\n            printf(\"%d\", i + 1);\n            counts[i]--;\n            total_numbers--;\n            if (total_numbers > 0) {\n                printf(\"+\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Total Memory Calculation (`m`):**\n\n*   `int counts[4]`: `4 * sizeof(int)` = 4 * 4 = 16 bytes.\n*   `int c`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   `int total_numbers`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   `int i`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 16 + 4 + 4 + 4 = **28 bytes**.\n\nThis represents the total memory allocated for the variables in the most memory-efficient C implementation of the solution.\n\n<<<28>>>"
