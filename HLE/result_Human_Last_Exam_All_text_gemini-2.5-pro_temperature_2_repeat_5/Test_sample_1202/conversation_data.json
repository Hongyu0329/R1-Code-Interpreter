    "### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the core question:** The question asks for the most probable mechanism that allows duplicate genes to be kept (retained) in the genome and to change over time (diverge) from each other. Gene duplication creates a redundant copy of a gene. Without a selective advantage, this extra copy is likely to accumulate debilitating mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene, or be lost entirely. The question seeks the process that prevents this loss and promotes divergence.\n\n2.  **Analyze Answer Choice A: Gene conversion.** Gene conversion is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. When this happens between two duplicate genes (paralogs), it makes them more similar to each other. This process, therefore, works against divergence and leads to homogenization of the gene pair. Thus, it is not a mechanism for retention *and* divergence.\n\n3.  **Analyze Answer Choice B: Pseudogenization.** This is the process where one of the duplicate gene copies accumulates mutations that render it non-functional. It becomes a \"pseudogene.\" While this represents divergence (the pseudogene's sequence diverges from the functional gene's), it is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not gene *retention* in a functional sense. The question asks for a mechanism that retains the duplicates, implying they both remain important for the organism.\n\n4.  **Analyze Answer Choice C: Neofunctionalization.** This model proposes that after duplication, one copy maintains the original, essential function, while the second, redundant copy is free from selective pressure and can accumulate mutations. By chance, some of these mutations might lead to a completely new, beneficial function. At this point, natural selection will act to preserve this new gene. This model successfully explains both the *retention* of the two copies (as both now have important, distinct functions) and their *divergence* (as the new copy evolves a new sequence for its new role). This is a plausible mechanism.\n\n5.  **Analyze Answer Choice D: Subfunctionalization.** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, this theory posits that the ancestral gene before duplication had multiple functions or was expressed in multiple tissues/times. After duplication, each of the two copies accumulates different degenerative mutations, knocking out *different* subfunctions. For instance, one copy might lose the ability to function in the liver while the other loses the ability to function in the muscle. Consequently, both gene copies are now required to carry out the complete set of functions of the original ancestral gene. This co-dependency ensures that both copies are *retained* by natural selection. As they specialize, their sequences and regulatory regions will *diverge*. This is also a very plausible mechanism.\n\n6.  **Analyze Answer Choice E: Adaptive radiation.** Adaptive radiation is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where an ancestral species rapidly diversifies into many new species, each occupying a different ecological niche. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, adaptive radiation itself is a macroevolutionary outcome, not a molecular mechanism for retaining individual duplicate genes within a genome.\n\n7.  **Compare the most plausible mechanisms (C and D):** Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the *most likely* mechanism.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** requires a relatively rare event: the evolution of a brand-new beneficial function from random mutations before the gene copy degrades into a pseudogene.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization** relies on a more common type of mutation: loss-of-function mutations. It provides a passive route to preservation. If an ancestral gene has two functions, and each duplicate copy loses one of them in a complementary way, selection will immediately act to preserve both. Since loss-of-function mutations are far more common than gain-of-new-function mutations, many scientists argue that subfunctionalization is a more common and immediate mechanism for preserving duplicate genes from being lost after a duplication event. It acts as a \"stepping stone,\" locking in both copies, which can then diverge further, possibly even allowing for neofunctionalization later in their evolutionary history.\n\n### Careful points:\n\n*   **Retention vs. Loss:** The key is to find a mechanism that explains why *both* copies are kept, not why one is lost (pseudogenization).\n*   **Divergence vs. Homogenization:** The mechanism must promote differences, not similarity (as in gene conversion).\n*   **Likelihood:** Subfunctionalization is often considered more likely because it relies on more common degenerative mutations to partition existing functions, whereas neofunctionalization requires a rarer gain-of-function mutation to create a new function.\n*   **Scale:** Adaptive radiation is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level.\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are valid models. However, subfunctionalization provides a more probable and passive pathway for the initial retention of duplicate genes, as it relies on more frequent loss-of-function mutations to make both copies indispensable. Therefore, it is often considered the most likely mechanism responsible for the widespread retention of duplicate genes seen in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
