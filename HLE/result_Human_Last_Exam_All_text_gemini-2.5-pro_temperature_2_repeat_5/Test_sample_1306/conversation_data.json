    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the algebraic structure**: The problem concerns the representation theory of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, also denoted $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (e.g., $q = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$). This is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra over $\\mathbb{C}$. The properties of its representations are determined by the parameter $\\ell$, which is the multiplicative order of $q^2$. Since $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$, we have $q^2 = e^{4\\pi i/3}$. The order of $q^2$ is 3, so $\\ell=3$. The algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is generated by elements $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ subject to the relations:\n    *   $KEK^{-1} = q^2 E$, $KFK^{-1} = q^{-2} F$\n    *   $[E, F] = \\frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}$\n    *   $E^\\ell=0$, $F^\\ell=0$, $K^\\ell=1$ (here $\\ell=3$).\n    This algebra has dimension $\\ell^3 = 3^3 = 27$.\n\n2.  **Identifying the category C**: The category $C$ consists of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. The \"objects\" of $C$ are the isomorphism classes of these representations.\n\n3.  **Counting the irreducible representations**: First, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic irreducible (or simple) representations.\n    *   The simple modules of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ are highest-weight modules. They are classified by their highest weight $\\lambda$, which is an eigenvalue of the group-like element $K$.\n    *   Since $K^3=1$ in the algebra, the eigenvalues of $K$ in any representation must be third roots of unity, i.e., $\\{1, q, q^2\\}$.\n    *   For each possible highest weight $\\lambda$ that satisfies certain conditions, there is a corresponding simple module $L(\\lambda)$.\n    *   It is a standard result in the representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ that there are exactly $\\ell$ simple modules. For our case, $\\ell=3$.\n    *   These simple modules are often denoted $L_k$ or $V_k$ for $k=1, \\dots, \\ell$, where $L_k$ has dimension $k$. Let's check them:\n        1.  $L_1 = L(1)$: a 1-dimensional trivial representation.\n        2.  $L_2 = L(q)$: a 2-dimensional representation.\n        3.  $L_3 = L(q^2)$: a 3-dimensional representation.\n    *   So, there are exactly 3 non-isomorphic irreducible representations. These are three of the objects in the category $C$.\n\n4.  **Counting all indecomposable representations**: Next, we need to find the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. This is determined by the representation type of the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$.\n    *   The representation type of an algebra can be finite, tame, or wild.\n    *   For the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with parameter $\\ell$:\n        *   If $\\ell=1$ or $\\ell=2$, the algebra is of **finite representation type**, meaning there is only a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\n        *   If $\\ell \\ge 3$, the algebra is of **tame representation type**.\n    *   In our case, $\\ell=3$, so $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is of tame representation type.\n\n5.  **Implications of tame representation type**: An algebra being of tame representation type over an algebraically closed field like $\\mathbb{C}$ has a specific meaning for its indecomposable modules. For each dimension $d$, the isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules of dimension $d$ fall into a finite number of discrete modules and a finite number of one-parameter families.\n    *   A \"one-parameter family\" is a set of modules $\\{M_x\\}_{x \\in X}$ where the indexing set $X$ is an infinite set, typically a Zariski-open subset of the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$. This means there are infinitely many non-isomorphic modules within such a family.\n    *   For instance, the regular blocks of the module category of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $\\ell=3$ are known to be equivalent to the module category of the Kronecker quiver algebra. The Kronecker algebra is a classic example of a tame algebra, and it has infinite families of indecomposable modules (the \"regular\" modules).\n    *   The existence of even one such family implies that the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations is **infinite**.\n\n6.  **Calculating the percentage**: The question asks for the percentage of objects in $C$ that are irreducible.\n    *   Number of irreducible objects (isomorphism classes) = 3.\n    *   Total number of indecomposable objects (isomorphism classes) = $\\infty$.\n    *   The percentage is calculated as:\n        $$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Number of irreducible objects}}{\\text{Total number of indecomposable objects}} \\times 100 $$\n        $$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{3}{\\infty} \\times 100 $$\n\n7.  **Final conclusion**: The fraction $3/\\infty$ is 0. Therefore, the percentage of objects in $C$ that are irreducible is 0%.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   Correctly identifying the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and the crucial parameter $\\ell=3$.\n*   Correctly identifying the number of simple (irreducible) modules, which is $\\ell=3$.\n*   Recognizing the representation type (tame) of the algebra for $\\ell=3$. This is the most critical step.\n*   Understanding the implication of tame representation type over $\\mathbb{C}$: it means there is an infinite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n*   Correctly setting up the fraction for the percentage and evaluating it.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer can be determined."
