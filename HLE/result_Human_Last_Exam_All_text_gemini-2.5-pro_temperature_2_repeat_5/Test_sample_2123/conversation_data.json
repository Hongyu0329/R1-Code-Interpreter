    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is a word puzzle based on a homophone or a pun that exists in the Russian language. We are looking for an English poet's surname that sounds like a Russian word used to describe Vienna's wide boulevards.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Clues:**\n    *   **Location:** Vienna.\n    *   **Feature:** Wide boulevards (like the famous Ringstrasse).\n    *   **Context:** A Russian translation. This is crucial because the wordplay must work in Russian.\n    *   **Subject:** The surname of an English poet.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Wide Boulevards\" Clue:** Wide boulevards, especially historic ones in a city like Vienna, are characterized by being lined with trees. A good descriptor for a line or cluster of trees is a \"grove\" or \"copse\".\n\n4.  **Connect to the Russian Language:**\n    *   The Russian word for a \"grove\" or \"copse\" is **\"гай\"** (pronounced \"gai\").\n    *   It is a very poetic and fitting word to describe the lush, tree-lined boulevards of Vienna. A Russian author might write something like, \"The boulevards stretched out like long green groves\" (\"Бульвары тянулись, как длинные зеленые **гаи**\" - \"gai\" in the plural form).\n\n5.  **Find the English Poet:** Now, we need to find an English poet whose surname, when transliterated into Russian, sounds identical to \"гай\" (gai).\n    *   The English poet and dramatist John **Gay** (1685–1732) is a well-known figure in English literature.\n    *   His surname, \"Gay,\" is transliterated into Russian as **\"Гей\"** (pronounced \"gey\" or \"gai,\" identically to \"гай\").\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Solution:** When a Russian text describes the Viennese boulevards as \"groves\" (гаи), it is phonetically introducing the surname of the English poet John Gay (Гей). This creates the clever literary reference the question alludes to.\n\n**Careful points considered:**\n\n*   **The pun must be in Russian:** The entire logic hinges on the Russian words \"гай\" (grove) and \"Гей\" (Gay) being homophones.\n*   **Contextual relevance:** The word \"grove\" is a perfectly logical and descriptive term for a tree-lined boulevard, making the pun natural rather than forced.\n*   **Poet's nationality:** John Gay was indeed an English poet, fitting the requirement.\n*   **Alternative theories:** One might consider Vienna's Ringstrasse (\"Ring Road\"), which in Russian is \"Кольцо\" (\"kol'tso\"). This sounds vaguely like the first part of \"Coleridge,\" but the phonetic match is weak and less direct than the \"Gay\"/\"гай\" connection. The Gay/grove connection is a much more elegant and well-known example of this kind of literary wordplay.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nThe Russian word for grove, \"гай\" (gai), is used to describe the tree-lined boulevards. This word sounds identical to the Russian transliteration of the surname of the English poet John Gay, which is \"Гей\" (Gey/gai). Therefore, the surname is Gay.\n\n<<<Gay>>>"
