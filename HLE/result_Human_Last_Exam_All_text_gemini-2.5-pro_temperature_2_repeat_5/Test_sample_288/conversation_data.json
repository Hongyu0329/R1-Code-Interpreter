    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Components of the Question**\n\n*   **Neuron:** ASJ. This is a bilateral pair of amphid sensory neurons, meaning there is a left neuron (ASJL) and a right neuron (ASJR). We must consider the synaptic outputs from both.\n*   **Source of Synapses:** The axons of the ASJ neurons.\n*   **Criterion:** The main target is determined by the highest number of synapses received from ASJ.\n*   **Organism Context:** The adult hermaphrodite *C. elegans*. The most up-to-date and complete dataset for this is the connectome described by Cook et al. in their 2019 *Nature* paper.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Main Postsynaptic Partners of ASJ**\n\nWe need to consult the connectome data to list the neurons that the ASJ axons make synapses onto (their postsynaptic partners) and count the number of synapses for each connection. The ASJ neurons are presynaptic to several interneurons and motor neurons in the nerve ring.\n\nBased on the connectome data (from Cook et al., 2019), the most significant targets are:\n*   **AIA:** A pair of interneurons (AIAL and AIAR).\n*   **AVG:** A single, unpaired command interneuron.\n*   **AIY:** A pair of interneurons (AIYL and AIYR).\n*   **PVQ:** A pair of interneurons (PVQL and PVQR).\n\n**Step 3: Quantify the Synapses from ASJ to Each Main Target**\n\nWe need to sum the synapses from both ASJL and ASJR to their respective targets.\n\n1.  **Target: AVG (single neuron)**\n    *   Synapses from ASJL to AVG: 10\n    *   Synapses from ASJR to AVG: 14\n    *   **Total synapses to AVG:** 10 + 14 = **24**\n\n2.  **Target: AIA (neuron class, composed of AIAL and AIAR)**\n    *   Synapses from ASJL to AIAL: 10\n    *   Synapses from ASJL to AIAR: 2\n    *   Synapses from ASJR to AIAR: 10\n    *   Synapses from ASJR to AIAL: 2\n    *   **Total synapses to the AIA class:** 10 + 2 + 10 + 2 = **24**\n\n3.  **Target: AIY (neuron class, composed of AIYL and AIYR)**\n    *   Synapses from ASJL to AIYL: 6\n    *   Synapses from ASJL to AIYR: 1\n    *   Synapses from ASJR to AIYR: 6\n    *   Synapses from ASJR to AIYL: 1\n    *   **Total synapses to the AIY class:** 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 = **14**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Results and Determine the Final Answer**\n\n*   Comparing the total synapse counts, we find that the AIA neuron class and the AVG neuron both receive **24 synapses** from the ASJ pair. They are tied for the highest number of synaptic inputs.\n*   However, the question asks for the main target \"cell\".\n*   The 24 synapses to the AIA class are distributed between two individual cells: AIAL receives 12 synapses (10 from ASJL, 2 from ASJR), and AIAR receives 12 synapses (10 from ASJR, 2 from ASJL).\n*   The 24 synapses to AVG are all directed to a single cell, as AVG is an unpaired neuron.\n*   Therefore, the **single cell** that is the largest recipient of ASJ axonal projections is AVG.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Bilateral Neurons:** It's crucial to sum the connections from both the left and right neurons of a pair (ASJL/ASJR) to get the total influence on a target.\n*   **Single vs. Paired Targets:** Distinguishing between a single target cell (like AVG) and a target neuron class composed of a pair (like AIA) is essential for correctly interpreting the \"main target cell\".\n*   **Data Source:** Using the most recent and complete connectome data (Cook et al., 2019) is important for accuracy, as synapse counts can differ from older reconstructions (e.g., White et al., 1986).\n\n<<<AVG>>>"
