    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the question and define the \"generalized Markov number\"\n\nThe term \"generalized Markov number\" \\( m_{p/q} \\) associated with a rational number \\( p/q \\) can have different interpretations in mathematical literature. A common and well-defined interpretation, arising in the study of Diophantine approximation, is the **Markov constant of the rational number p/q**, denoted as \\( C(p/q) \\). We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\nThe Markov constant \\( C(p/q) \\) is defined as follows:\nFirst, find the continued fraction expansion of \\( p/q \\):\n$$ \\frac{p}{q} = [0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n] $$\nThen, the Markov constant is the maximum value of the following expressions for \\( j = 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\):\n$$ C_j = [a_j; a_{j+1}, \\ldots, a_n] + [0; a_{j-1}, \\ldots, a_1] $$\nThe Markov constant is \\( C(p/q) = \\max_{1 \\le j \\le n} C_j \\). We will assume \\( m_{4/7} = C(4/7) \\). The question then asks for the continued fraction of this value.\n\n### Step 2: Find the continued fraction of 4/7\n\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the continued fraction expansion of 4/7.\n$$ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/4} $$\n$$ \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} $$\n$$ \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4/3} $$\n$$ \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nCombining these steps, we get:\n$$ \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] $$\nSo, we have the coefficients \\( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_3 = 3 \\). The length of the continued fraction is \\( n=3 \\).\n\n**Careful point:** The continued fraction of a rational is not unique. For instance, \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] = [0; 1, 1, 2, 1] \\). The definition of the Markov constant is robust and gives the same result regardless of which of the two standard finite continued fraction representations is chosen. We will use the shorter one, \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n\n### Step 3: Compute the candidate values \\( C_j \\)\n\nWe need to compute \\( C_j = [a_j; a_{j+1}, \\ldots, a_n] + [0; a_{j-1}, \\ldots, a_1] \\) for \\( j=1, 2, 3 \\).\n\n*   **For j = 1:**\n    The first part is \\( [a_1; a_2, a_3] = [1; 1, 3] \\).\n    The second part is \\( [0;] \\), which is defined as 0.\n    So, \\( C_1 = [1; 1, 3] + 0 = 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{4/3} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n\n*   **For j = 2:**\n    The first part is \\( [a_2; a_3] = [1; 3] \\).\n    The second part is \\( [0; a_1] = [0; 1] \\).\n    So, \\( C_2 = [1; 3] + [0; 1] = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\frac{1}{1} = \\frac{4}{3} + 1 = \\frac{7}{3} \\).\n\n*   **For j = 3:**\n    The first part is \\( [a_3] = [3] \\).\n    The second part is \\( [0; a_2, a_1] = [0; 1, 1] \\).\n    So, \\( C_3 = [3] + [0; 1, 1] = 3 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1}} = 3 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} \\).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\)\n\nThe generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the maximum of the values we computed:\n$$ m_{4/7} = \\max(C_1, C_2, C_3) = \\max\\left(\\frac{7}{4}, \\frac{7}{3}, \\frac{7}{2}\\right) $$\nTo compare these fractions, we can convert them to decimals or find a common denominator:\n$$ \\frac{7}{4} = 1.75 $$\n$$ \\frac{7}{3} \\approx 2.333... $$\n$$ \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5 $$\nThe maximum value is \\( \\frac{7}{2} \\). Therefore, \\( m_{4/7} = \\frac{7}{2} \\).\n\n### Step 5: Compute the continued fraction associated with \\( m_{4/7} \\)\n\nThe question asks for the continued fraction associated with \\( m_{4/7} \\). This means we need to find the continued fraction of the number \\( \\frac{7}{2} \\).\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm again:\n$$ \\frac{7}{2} = 3 + \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis gives the continued fraction:\n$$ \\frac{7}{2} = [3; 2] $$\n\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is \\( [3; 2] \\)."
