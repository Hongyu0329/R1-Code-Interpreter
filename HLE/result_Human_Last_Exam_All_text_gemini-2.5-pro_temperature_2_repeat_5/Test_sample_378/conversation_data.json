    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to find a specific year when the individual \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\n2.  **Verify the Name:** The first crucial step is to verify the full, official name of the person in question. The former President of Nigeria is globally and officially known as **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n\n3.  **Identify \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" in Nigerian political history most famously refers to **Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria from 1963 to 1966.\n\n4.  **Check for a Name Connection:** The next step is to search for any credible evidence or records showing that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name includes \"Azikiwe\".\n    *   His official name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n    *   His given name is \"Goodluck\".\n    *   His middle name is \"Ebele\".\n    *   His surname is \"Jonathan\".\n    *   There is no official or widely recognized record that \"Azikiwe\" is part of his name.\n\n5.  **Investigate the Premise:** The question operates on the premise that Goodluck Jonathan *did* at some point publicly identify as \"Azikiwe\". We need to investigate if this event ever happened.\n    *   A thorough search of news archives, official government records, and reputable biographical sources yields no information about Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever changing his name, adding \"Azikiwe\" to it, or publicly identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n    *   An event of this significance (a former president adopting the name of another iconic president) would have been major national and international news and would be well-documented.\n\n6.  **Conclusion of Analysis:** The premise of the question is incorrect. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as Azikiwe because \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name. He is a different person from Nnamdi Azikiwe. Therefore, there is no year in which this event occurred.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinction between Individuals:** It is critical to distinguish between two different Nigerian Presidents: Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe. They are not the same person and are not known to be related.\n*   **Verification of Facts:** The question is based on a factual inaccuracy. Always verify the core facts of a question, such as a person's name, before attempting to answer.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** In historical and factual inquiries, the absence of evidence from credible sources is a strong indicator that an event did not happen, especially for highly public figures.\n\nBased on this analysis, the event described in the question never took place.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. His official name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, and he is a distinct individual from Nnamdi Azikiwe, another former Nigerian President. Therefore, such an event has never occurred.>>>"
