    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Movement: Cambré Derrière**\n*   \"Cambré\" means \"arched.\" \"Derrière\" means \"to the back.\"\n*   A cambré derrière is a classical ballet movement where the dancer bends their upper body backward from the waist.\n*   This movement requires flexibility in the spine, strength in the core and back muscles, and proper alignment.\n\n**2. Understand the Ballet Methods: Vaganova vs. Balanchine**\n*   **Vaganova Method:** Developed in Russia by Agrippina Vaganova. It is known for its precision, strength, soulfulness, and methodical training that combines elements of the French and Italian schools. A key principle is stability in the core and hips to allow for freedom and expression in the upper body and limbs.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** Developed by George Balanchine for his New York City Ballet. It is known for its speed, dynamism, musicality, and creating long, extended lines. It often emphasizes an \"off-balance\" aesthetic to create a sense of risk and excitement.\n\n**3. Analyze Cambré Derrière in the Vaganova Method**\n*   **Foundation:** The bend is initiated from the upper back, lifting the sternum towards the ceiling.\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is the most critical point. In the Vaganova method, the hips and pelvis must remain completely stable and square, directly over the supporting legs. The dancer does not push the hips forward. This isolates the bend to the thoracic and upper lumbar spine and ensures the lower back is protected. The focus is on a pure, controlled spinal articulation.\n*   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up towards the ceiling. The arms, typically in fifth position en haut (high fifth), maintain their rounded shape.\n*   **Aesthetic:** The look is one of controlled, graceful strength and elegance.\n\n**4. Analyze Cambré Derrière in the Balanchine Method**\n*   **Foundation:** The bend is often larger, deeper, and more dramatic.\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is the key difference. To achieve a deeper backbend and a more extreme line, the Balanchine technique instructs the dancer to press the hips forward, away from the vertical axis. This creates a large, continuous C-curve from the feet to the head.\n*   **Head and Arms:** The head is often allowed to release completely back. The arms might be held in a less rounded, more open position to extend the line.\n*   **Aesthetic:** The look is one of speed, daring, and extreme flexibility, accentuating long lines and pushing the body's physical limits.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are subtle stylistic differences in arm placement, the most fundamental and defining technical difference lies elsewhere.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the primary point of divergence. Vaganova demands stable hips over the feet, while Balanchine encourages pushing the hips forward. This single difference in technique changes the entire shape, depth, and dynamic of the movement.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is generally faster, a cambré can be performed at any speed in either technique depending on the musicality and choreography. Speed is a quality of performance, not a foundational technical difference in the movement's mechanics.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The deeper backbend in the Balanchine style is a *result* of pushing the hips forward. The hip placement is the *cause* of the difference in degree, making it the more fundamental answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** The difference in head placement is also a *consequence* of the different approaches to the torso and hip alignment. The full release of the Balanchine head is made possible by the deep, hip-driven backbend.\n\n**Conclusion:** The most accurate and fundamental distinction between the Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière is the technique related to the placement of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
