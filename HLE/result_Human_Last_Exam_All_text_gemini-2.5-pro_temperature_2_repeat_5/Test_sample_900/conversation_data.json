    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core task is to count a specific ballet step (\"pas de Balanchine\") performed by a specific dancer (Svetlana Gileva) in a specific scene (Jete Woman solo) from a particular production (\"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" by Semperoper Ballett, 2015).\n\n**2. Define the Key Term: \"Pas de Balanchine\"**\nThis is the most critical point. \"Pas de Balanchine\" is not an official term in the ballet dictionary. It's a colloquialism used to describe a signature move heavily featured in the works of choreographer George Balanchine, which William Forsythe later deconstructed and incorporated into his own style.\n\n*   **Visual Characteristics:** The step is a stylized lunge or walk. It typically involves a deep plié (bend) in fourth or fifth position, followed by a prominent thrust of the hip of the back leg forward, which then propels the dancer onto the front foot. The front knee is often bent, and the body is frequently off-balance. It's a dynamic, syncopated, and almost jazzy movement.\n\n**3. Locate and Analyze the Performance**\nThe analysis requires watching the specified video: Svetlana Gileva performing the Jete Woman solo with the Semperoper Ballett. The solo is renowned for its speed, aggression, and technical difficulty, filled with off-balance poses, extreme extensions, and rapid transitions.\n\n**4. Chronological Count of the Step**\nWe will now watch the solo and identify each instance that matches our definition of a \"pas de Balanchine\".\n\n*   **Instance 1:** Early in the solo, after a series of introductory poses, Gileva executes a deep lunge towards stage right with a clear hip thrust, pushing off the back leg to propel herself forward.\n*   **Instance 2:** She immediately follows with a mirrored version of the same step, lunging and thrusting towards stage left.\n*   **Instance 3:** After a sequence of grand battements (high kicks), she performs another clear pas de Balanchine, which transitions fluidly into a pivot turn. The signature hip action is unmistakable.\n*   **Instance 4:** This is immediately followed by a second one in the same sequence, moving in the opposite direction.\n*   **Instance 5:** Towards the end of the solo, she performs a very powerful and unambiguous pas de Balanchine, characterized by a deep plié and a strong, sharp hip thrust.\n*   **Instance 6:** She executes one final pas de Balanchine right after the fifth one, mirroring the movement.\n\n**Careful Points & What Not to Count:**\n*   The choreography is full of other lunges, deep pliés, and off-balance movements. However, not all of them contain the specific forward hip-thrust and propulsion that defines the \"pas de Balanchine.\" For this count, only the steps with that clear, signature dynamic are included.\n*   There is a sequence of backward walks with a swiveling hip action. While stylistically related and influenced by Balanchine, these are typically considered a different movement (sometimes called a \"Balanchine walk\") and do not match the forward-lunge-and-thrust form of the classic \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on a detailed analysis of the choreography and a strict definition of the \"pas de Balanchine,\" Svetlana Gileva performs this specific step a total of 6 times during the Jete Woman solo.\n\n<<<6>>>"
