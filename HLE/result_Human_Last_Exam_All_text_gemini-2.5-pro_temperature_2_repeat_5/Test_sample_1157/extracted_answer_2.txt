**1. Specific Procedures and Cells of Interest:**

**Procedures:**
The management must be phased, prioritizing the patient's systemic health.
*   **Immediate/Emergency Phase:**
    1.  **Medical Stabilization:** Urgent medical consultation to manage uncontrolled diabetes is the top priority. This includes blood glucose monitoring and starting appropriate medication (e.g., insulin) and rehydration.
    2.  **Wound Management:** Gentle debridement of the tooth sockets, irrigation with saline, and suturing of any soft tissue lacerations.
    3.  **Radiographic Evaluation:** A panoramic and periapical X-rays to rule out fractures of the jawbone or adjacent tooth roots.
    4.  **Infection & Pain Control:** Prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics and analgesics. A tetanus booster should be administered if her immunization is not up to date.
*   **Definitive Phase (after medical stabilization and socket healing):**
    1.  **Prosthetic Rehabilitation:** Fabrication of a removable partial denture (RPD) is the treatment of choice. Invasive options like implants or a fixed bridge are contraindicated at this time due to her poorly controlled diabetes and the long-span nature of the tooth loss, which makes a bridge biomechanically unsound.

**Cells of Interest:**
The patient's uncontrolled diabetes directly impairs the function of cells crucial for wound healing:
*   **Neutrophils and Macrophages:** These immune cells have reduced chemotaxis and phagocytic ability, leading to a prolonged inflammatory state and a very high risk of infection.
*   **Fibroblasts:** Hyperglycemia reduces their ability to proliferate and synthesize collagen, resulting in delayed and weak tissue repair.
*   **Osteoblasts:** Bone-forming cells whose function is impaired by diabetes, leading to poor bone healing in the sockets.

**2. Denture Replacement, Material, and Abutment Teeth:**

*   **Type of Denture:** A **tooth-supported Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**.
*   **Material:** The ideal material is a **cast Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) metal framework**. This provides rigidity, support, and stability while being hygienic and minimally bulky. The artificial teeth would be made of acrylic, and the base that rests on the gum would be pink, heat-cured acrylic resin.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
    *   **Primary Abutments:**
        *   **Left Second Premolar:** As the tooth immediately behind the gap, it will provide the primary support and retention for the back of the denture.
        *   **Left Central Incisor:** As the tooth at the front of the gap, it will provide anterior support and retention. Rest seat preparation on the cingulum is crucial to direct forces down its long axis.
    *   **Stabilizing Abutments (for Cross-Arch Stabilization):**
        *   **Teeth on the Right Side (e.g., Right First Molar and Canine):** These must be included in the denture design with rests and clasps.
        *   **Reason:** To provide stability, prevent the denture from rocking or rotating during function, and offer indirect retention. This distributes forces across the arch rather than overloading the teeth adjacent to the gap.
