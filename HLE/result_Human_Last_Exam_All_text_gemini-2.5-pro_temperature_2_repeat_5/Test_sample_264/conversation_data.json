    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n*   We have two identical cubes.\n*   The side length of each cube is 1.\n*   One cube is shifted relative to the other. The shift is \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n\n**2. Establish a Coordinate System**\nTo analyze the problem geometrically, we'll place the first cube (let's call it Cube A) in a standard 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's align its edges with the axes and place one corner at the origin (0,0,0).\n*   **Cube A** occupies the space defined by the inequalities:\n    *   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n*   The volume of Cube A is 1 × 1 × 1 = 1.\n\n**3. Interpret the Shift \"Along the Main Diagonal\"**\n*   The \"main diagonal\" of Cube A connects opposite vertices. For our setup, a prominent main diagonal connects the origin (0,0,0) to the vertex (1,1,1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is best interpreted as a translation by a vector that is a multiple of the diagonal vector **d**. The most common and straightforward interpretation for problems like this is that the components of the shift are 1/2 along each corresponding axis.\n*   Therefore, the shift vector is **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n**4. Define the Second Cube**\nThe second cube (Cube B) is simply Cube A translated by the vector **v**. To find the boundaries of Cube B, we add the shift vector's components to the boundaries of Cube A.\n*   **Cube B** occupies the space defined by the inequalities:\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  **1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2**\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  **1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2**\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  **1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2**\n\n**5. Find the Region of Intersection**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the inequalities for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We can find this by finding the intersection of the ranges for each coordinate independently.\n*   **For the x-axis:** Cube A is [0, 1]. Cube B is [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection of these two intervals is **[1/2, 1]**. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   **For the y-axis:** Cube A is [0, 1]. Cube B is [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is **[1/2, 1]**. The length is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   **For the z-axis:** Cube A is [0, 1]. Cube B is [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is **[1/2, 1]**. The length is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\n**6. Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\nThe region of intersection is a rectangular prism (specifically, another cube) defined by the new ranges:\n*   1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\nThe side lengths of this intersection cube are the lengths of the coordinate intervals we found in the previous step: 1/2, 1/2, and 1/2.\nThe volume is the product of these side lengths:\n*   Volume = (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = **1/8**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Ambiguity of \"along the main diagonal\":** This is the most critical part of the problem statement. The interpretation chosen (a shift of 1/2 in each coordinate) is the most standard for such problems and leads to a clean, simple answer. An alternative interpretation (a shift distance of 1/2) would involve a shift vector of (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)), leading to a much more complex and \"messy\" irrational answer, which is less likely intended.\n*   **Visualization:** It can be helpful to visualize the situation. Cube A has a corner at (0,0,0). Cube B has its corresponding corner at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). The intersection is the part of Cube A that lies beyond the point (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), which is a smaller cube with corners at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and (1, 1, 1). This matches the calculation.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
