    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date by a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for the **earliest known date** that was **recorded** by a **pre-Columbian civilization** using an **aboriginal writing system**.\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This means the oldest inscription we have found, not a theoretical or mythological date like the start of the Maya calendar. The inscription must have been created at or near the time of the date it records.\n*   **\"Recorded\"**: It must be a physical inscription—carved in stone, painted on a wall, etc.\n*   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: Cultures that existed in the Americas before 1492.\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written in a native script, such as Maya or Zapotec glyphs, not a system introduced later.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Calendar Systems\nThe two most important calendar systems for this question are:\n1.  **The 260-day Sacred Calendar**: The oldest Mesoamerican calendar, used by nearly all civilizations in the region. It combines 20 named days with numbers from 1 to 13. A date might be, for example, \"4 Flower\" or \"1 Death.\"\n2.  **The Long Count**: A more complex system used primarily by the Maya and their predecessors (like the Epi-Olmec). It counts the total number of days elapsed from a mythical starting point (August 11, 3114 BCE). It can pinpoint a date with absolute precision over millennia.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Primary Candidates\nSeveral artifacts are contenders for the title of \"earliest recorded date.\"\n\n*   **Candidate A: Tres Zapotes Stela C (Epi-Olmec Culture)**\n    *   **Description**: A stone monument from the Veracruz region of Mexico.\n    *   **The Record**: It contains a date written in the Long Count system: 7.16.6.16.18.\n    *   **Correlation**: This corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar.\n    *   **Significance**: For a long time, this was widely accepted as the oldest recorded date in the Americas. It is the earliest known use of the *Long Count* calendar.\n\n*   **Candidate B: The San Bartolo Glyphs (Maya Civilization)**\n    *   **Description**: In 2022, archaeologists announced the discovery of painted glyph fragments at the San Bartolo site in Guatemala.\n    *   **The Record**: The fragments clearly show the glyph for a date in the 260-day calendar: **\"7 Deer\"**.\n    *   **Correlation**: The carbon associated with the plaster fragments was radiocarbon dated to between **300 and 200 BCE**.\n    *   **Significance**: This discovery pushed back the evidence for Maya writing and calendrical records by several centuries, making it definitively older than the Tres Zapotes date.\n\n*   **Candidate C: Monument 3 from San José Mogote (Zapotec Culture)**\n    *   **Description**: A carved stone slab (a *danzante*) located in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico, a center of Zapotec civilization. The monument depicts a slain captive.\n    *   **The Record**: Carved between the captive's legs is a glyph that represents a day in the 260-day Zapotec calendar: **\"1 Earthquake\"**. In this context, the date is believed to be the captive's name, as was the custom.\n    *   **Correlation**: The monument itself is dated through archaeological context (ceramics and stratigraphy) to approximately **600 BCE**.\n    *   **Significance**: This is the earliest widely accepted evidence of writing and calendrical notation in Mesoamerica. It predates both the San Bartolo and Tres Zapotes artifacts significantly.\n\n### Step 4: Compare and Conclude\nComparing the candidates reveals a clear timeline:\n1.  **San José Mogote, Monument 3**: A date (\"1 Earthquake\") from the 260-day calendar, recorded around **600 BCE**.\n2.  **San Bartolo Glyphs**: A date (\"7 Deer\") from the 260-day calendar, recorded around **300-200 BCE**.\n3.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C**: A date from the Long Count calendar, recorded on **32 BCE**.\n\nWhile the Tres Zapotes Stela C holds the record for the earliest *Long Count* date, and the San Bartolo glyphs are the earliest known *Maya* date, the artifact from San José Mogote is the oldest overall. It is a specific date (\"1 Earthquake\") from a native calendar system, recorded in a native writing system around 600 BCE.\n\n<<<The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is the day \"1 Earthquake,\" which was inscribed on Monument 3 at the Zapotec site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico. The carving is dated archaeologically to approximately 600 BCE.>>>"
