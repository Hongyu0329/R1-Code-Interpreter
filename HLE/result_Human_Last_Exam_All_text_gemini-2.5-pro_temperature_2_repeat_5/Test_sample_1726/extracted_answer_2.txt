1. True. Events simultaneous in one frame are generally not simultaneous in another.
2. True. The length of a moving object would be measured to be expanded, $L = L_0 \sqrt{1+(v/c)^2}$. Since length depends on the frame of reference, this effect is true.
3. True. A moving clock would be measured to run faster (time contraction), $\Delta t = \Delta t' / \sqrt{1+(v/c)^2}$. Since the flow of time depends on the frame of reference, this effect is true.
4. False. The speed of light would not be invariant. Its measured speed would depend on the observer's motion according to the formula $c' = c \frac{1-v/c}{1+v/c}$.
5. True. The rule for adding velocities would be $u' = \frac{u-v}{1+uv/c^2}$, which is non-Newtonian.
6. The formula for the relativity of lengths is $L = L_0 \sqrt{1+(v/c)^2}$.
7. The formula for the relativity of time is $\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t'}{\sqrt{1+(v/c)^2}}$.
8. The formula for the addition of speeds is $u' = \frac{u-v}{1+uv/c^2}$.
