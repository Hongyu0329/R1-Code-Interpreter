    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the true profession of Andre Vernault.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject and Context:** The question focuses on Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the United Kingdom during World War II. The context is a counterintelligence investigation by the British authorities, who suspected him of being a German spy.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reason for Suspicion:** The key detail provided is that the suspicion arose because Vernault \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\" This implies that his deception and evasiveness fit the profile of a trained spy trying to hide their mission. British intelligence (MI5) was on high alert for enemy agents, and anyone with a story that didn't add up was treated with extreme suspicion.\n\n3.  **Determine the Motive for Concealment:** Vernault's motive for lying was not related to espionage. He was hiding his past for personal reasons. He feared that revealing his true profession would lead to his immediate arrest and imprisonment by the British authorities, as it was illegal and socially shameful. He calculated that being evasive and arousing suspicion of spying was a lesser risk than confessing to his actual career.\n\n4.  **Research and Identify the True Profession:** Historical records, particularly the declassified MI5 files at The National Archives in the UK and accounts by historians such as Ben Macintyre in his book \"Double Cross,\" reveal the truth about Vernault's case. These sources confirm that he was not a spy. His true profession was that of a highly skilled career criminal.\n\n5.  **Specify the Profession:** Andre Vernault was a **master cat burglar and jewel thief**. His skills in stealth, planning, and bypassing security systems, which were essential for his criminal activities, were misinterpreted by MI5 as potential training for espionage.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Mindset of Counterintelligence:** During the war, MI5 operated under the assumption that it was better to be overly cautious. Deception was a major red flag, and Vernault's lies made him a prime suspect. This case highlights how non-espionage-related secrets could easily be mistaken for espionage.\n*   **False Positives:** The Vernault case is a classic example of a \"false positive\" in intelligence work, where an individual's actions mimic those of a spy for entirely different reasons.\n*   **The Dilemma of the Individual:** Vernault was in a difficult position. Telling the truth would likely lead to imprisonment for his past crimes in Belgium. Lying made him look like an enemy agent. He chose the lie, which ultimately led to intense scrutiny.\n*   **Verification through Historical Records:** The answer is not speculative; it is based on documented evidence from official government archives that have since been declassified and made public.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the historical records of the case, it is clear that Andre Vernault was not a German spy. He concealed his profession from interrogators because he was a professional criminal—specifically, a master cat burglar and jewel thief—and he feared prosecution and imprisonment if he revealed his illegal past.\n\n<<<Master cat burglar and jewel thief>>>"
