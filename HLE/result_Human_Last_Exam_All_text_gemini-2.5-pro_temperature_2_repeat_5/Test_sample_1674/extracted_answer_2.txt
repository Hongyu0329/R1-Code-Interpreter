Yes, the theory can not hold when a birefringent medium is added. The failure occurs because the birefringent element couples the spatial and polarization degrees of freedom of the light beam. To invert the entire system and produce a specific desired output, the required input beam must generally have a complex, spatially varying polarization state (i.e., specific and different wavefronts for both the horizontal and vertical polarization components). Standard equipment used to implement such inversion, like a single spatial light modulator (SLM), can typically only control the spatial wavefront of a single polarization. Therefore, it becomes physically impossible to generate the necessary input beam, causing the practical application of the inversion theory to fail.
