    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks to identify two specific people who meet three criteria:\n    *   They are Nobel laureates.\n    *   They were featured in an Enron commercial.\n    *   The commercial was part of the \"Ask Why\" campaign from around the year 2000.\n\n2.  **Recall or Research the \"Ask Why\" Campaign:** This was a high-profile, brand-building advertising campaign launched by Enron in 2000. The goal was to portray Enron not as a mere energy-trading company, but as an innovative, forward-thinking \"big ideas\" company. The irony of the tagline became legendary after Enron's massive corporate fraud was exposed and the company collapsed in 2001.\n\n3.  **Identify the People Featured in the Commercials:** The campaign featured several prominent thinkers and academics. Research is needed to find the cast list for these commercials. The two individuals who fit the \"Nobel laureate\" description are:\n    *   Paul Krugman\n    *   Richard Smalley\n\n4.  **Verify Their Nobel Laureate Status:**\n    *   **Paul Krugman:** He is a prominent economist and columnist. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity.\n    *   **Richard Smalley:** He was a professor of Chemistry, Physics, and Astronomy at Rice University. He was a co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of a new form of carbon, buckminsterfullerene (also known as \"buckyballs\").\n\n5.  **Address the Nuances (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Timing of the Nobel Prize:** This is a key point of detail. Richard Smalley was *already* a Nobel laureate when the commercial aired in 2000 (having won in 1996). However, Paul Krugman was not; he won his Nobel Prize eight years later in 2008. The question asks \"Which two Nobel laureates *were featured*\", which can correctly refer to their status now, not necessarily their status at the exact moment the commercial was filmed. Both men are Nobel laureates and both were featured in the ads.\n    *   **Common Misconception:** Another famous Nobel laureate, John Forbes Nash Jr. (Economics, 1994), is often associated with this story. However, he was only *approached* to be in the commercial. He ultimately declined the offer and was therefore **not featured**. He is a common incorrect answer to this question.\n    *   **Confirmation of Appearance:** Both Krugman and Smalley did appear in separate spots for the \"Ask Why\" campaign. Their appearances are well-documented and the commercials can still be found online, serving as an infamous footnote in their respective careers.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals who are Nobel laureates and were featured in the 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercials are Paul Krugman and Richard Smalley.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Richard Smalley>>>"
