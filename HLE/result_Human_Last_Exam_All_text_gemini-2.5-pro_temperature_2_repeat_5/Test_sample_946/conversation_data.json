    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the name of a specific character from a specific piece of media. Let's break down the key components:\n*   **Media Franchise:** \"Homestar Runner\"\n*   **Specific Series:** \"Teen Girl Squad\" (a series-within-the-series)\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"#15\"\n*   **Event within the Episode:** The Junior Prom\n*   **Subject to Identify:** The name of a fictional singer.\n*   **Form of the Subject:** A cardboard cutout.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points**\n1.  **Episode Specificity:** The answer must come from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" and no other episode. Details from other Teen Girl Squad episodes or other Homestar Runner cartoons are irrelevant.\n2.  **Fictional Character:** The question explicitly asks for a *fictional* singer, meaning a character created for the cartoon, not a real-world musician.\n3.  **Format of the \"Performer\":** It's crucial to remember the performer is not a live character but a cardboard cutout, which is a key part of the joke in the episode.\n4.  **Name Spelling:** The exact spelling of the name is important for accuracy.\n\n**Step 3: Acquire the Final Answer with Analysis**\n1.  First, we must access the events of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". This episode focuses on the four main girls (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) trying to get dates for the \"4-Greg\" Junior Prom.\n2.  The episode culminates at the prom itself. Instead of a live band or a DJ, the musical entertainment is shown to be a cardboard cutout on a stage.\n3.  The cutout depicts a man with an acoustic guitar, in the style of a sensitive singer-songwriter.\n4.  The cartoon clearly labels the cardboard cutout, identifying the fictional performer. The name written on the cutout is **Thompkins**.\n5.  This is presented as a joke, as the girls are nonetheless very excited about the \"performance\" by the cardboard cutout of Thompkins. This fits the absurdist and low-fi humor of both Teen Girl Squad and Homestar Runner as a whole.\n6.  Therefore, by analyzing the specific scene at the Junior Prom in Teen Girl Squad #15, we can confidently identify the fictional singer's name.\n\n<<<Thompkins>>>"
