    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Famous Landmark:** The Pantheon.\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n    *   **Date of Removal:** \"Until 1950\", meaning it was removed around that year.\n\n2.  **Initial Research and Elimination of Possibilities:**\n    *   The most famous features of the Piazza are the Pantheon itself and the fountain in the center, the Fontana del Pantheon, which is topped by the Macuteo Obelisk. Neither of these has been removed.\n    *   Another well-known historical feature associated with the Pantheon were the two bell towers added by Bernini in the 17th century, nicknamed the \"donkey's ears\" (`orecchie d'asino`). However, these were removed much earlier, in 1883, so this does not fit the 1950 timeframe.\n    *   We need to look for something that was present in the first half of the 20th century but is gone now.\n\n3.  **Focus on the Time Period (early 20th Century until 1950):**\n    *   Historical photographs from this era are a key source of information. Looking at photos of the Piazza della Rotonda from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s reveals a feature that is strikingly different from the piazza's current appearance.\n    *   These photos clearly show tracks embedded in the cobblestones of the square.\n\n4.  **Identify the Feature:**\n    *   The feature was a **tram line**. Specifically, it was a circular tram track that ran right through the square, looping around the central fountain.\n    *   This tram line was part of Rome's extensive tram network (`rete tranviaria di Roma`).\n\n5.  **Analyze the \"Unique Architectural Feature\" description:**\n    *   While tram tracks are an element of infrastructure, their presence in such an iconic and ancient space created a unique and jarring visual effect.\n    *   The iron tracks, and often the overhead electrical wires that accompanied them, imposed a modern, industrial character onto a square defined by ancient and Renaissance architecture.\n    *   The sight of a tram rumbling past the columns of the Pantheon and circling the 16th-century fountain was a unique characteristic of the piazza for several decades. In this context, the entire tramway system within the square can be considered a significant and \"unique\" feature of its overall look and function during that period.\n\n6.  **Confirm the Removal and Date:**\n    *   In the post-World War II era, Rome began a process of reorganizing its public transport. Many tram lines in the historic center were seen as noisy, disruptive, and contributing to congestion.\n    *   The tram line passing through the Piazza della Rotonda was decommissioned. The removal of the tracks began in the late 1940s and was completed around 1950, which perfectly matches the timeframe given in the question. This action was part of a broader move to pedestrianize and preserve the character of Rome's most important historical sites.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Precise Dating:** The removal was a process. While the question states \"until 1950,\" the actual decommissioning might have happened in 1948 or 1949, with the final removal of all remnants finishing by 1950. The date is a close approximation.\n*   **\"Architectural\" Terminology:** The term \"architectural feature\" is used somewhat broadly here. The tram line is more accurately an \"infrastructural feature,\" but it had a profound impact on the architecture and visual composition of the square, justifying the description in the context of the puzzle-like question.\n*   **Distinguishing from Other Removals:** It is crucial to differentiate this from earlier, more famous removals, like Bernini's bell towers, which is a common point of confusion in the Pantheon's history.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the feature as the tram line.\n\n<<<A tram line that encircled the central fountain.>>>"
