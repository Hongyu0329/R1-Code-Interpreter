1.  **Permeability:** To prevent distortion in the exterior field, the permeability of the shell material must be the negative of the permeability of free space, `μ = -μ₀`.
2.  **Interior Field:** The magnetic field inside the shell (`ρ < R₁`) is uniform, parallel to the applied field, and has a magnitude given by `H_int = H₀ (R₂/R₁)²`.
