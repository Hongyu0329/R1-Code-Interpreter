    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n**Core Principles for Analysis**\n\nCoiled-coil structures are formed by alpha-helices winding around each other. Their oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core positions of the heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n1.  **Heptad Repeat:** A repeating pattern of seven amino acids.\n2.  **Hydrophobic Core:** Positions `a` and `d` are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues (like I, L, V, A, M). These residues pack together in the core of the structure.\n3.  **Ionic Interactions:** Positions `e` and `g` are often charged or polar residues that can form stabilizing salt bridges or hydrogen bonds between the helices.\n4.  **Oligomer State Rules:** The specific identity and pairing of residues at the `a` and `d` positions are strong determinants of the number of helices that will pack together. Common rules based on extensive experimental studies (e.g., from the labs of Alber, Woolfson, Kim) are:\n    *   **Dimer (2):** Favored by `Isoleucine (I)` at `a` and `Leucine (L)` at `d` (or vice-versa in some systems), or `Leucine (L)` at both `a` and `d`. Pairs with small residues like `Alanine (A)` also often favor dimers (e.g., `L(a)/A(d)`).\n    *   **Trimer (3):** Favored by `Isoleucine (I)` at both `a` and `d` (`I(a)/I(d)`). The bulkiness of `Isoleucine` at both positions is best accommodated in a trimeric interface. Other combinations like `L(a)/I(d)` also favor trimers. A bulky `Tryptophan (W)` at a core `d` position is also a strong trimer determinant.\n    *   **Tetramer (4):** Favored by `Isoleucine (I)` at `a` and a small residue like `Alanine (A)` at `d` (`I(a)/A(d)`). The beta-branched nature of `Isoleucine` paired with the small `Alanine` allows for the tighter packing required for a tetramer. The same is true for `Isoleucine (I)` paired with another beta-branched residue like `Valine (V)` or `Threonine (T)` (`I(a)/V(d)` or `I(a)/T(d)`).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Each Sequence**\n\nFor each sequence, we first need to identify the correct heptad repeat register to locate the `a` and `d` positions. We look for a register that places hydrophobic residues consistently in the core. A frame where the second residue is at the `a` position (`gabcdef`) proves to be the most consistent for the majority of these sequences.\n\n**Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **Heptad Register (`gabcdef`):** The sequence is framed as `E(g)I(a)A(b)Q(c)A(d)L(e)K(f)`.\n*   **Core Residues:**\n    *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n    *   `d` positions: A, A, W, A\n*   **Analysis:** The core is predominantly `I(a)/A(d)`, which is a strong signal for a tetramer. However, the third repeat contains a `Tryptophan (W)` at the `d` position. Tryptophan is very bulky, and its presence in the core, particularly at a `d` position, is a powerful driver for trimer formation. It is reasonable to conclude that the influence of the single `W` residue forces the entire oligomer into a trimeric state.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Trimer (3)**.\n\n**Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Register (`cdefgab`):** For this sequence, a different frame, `E(c)I(d)A(e)A(f)L(g)K(a)Q(b)`, appears to be the most chemically sound.\n*   **Core Residues:**\n    *   `a` positions: K, K, K, K. Wait, this frame is not plausible as `K` is charged. Let's try to find another frame. Let's try the frame `cdefgab` starting with the sequence from `I`: `I(c) A(d) A(e) L(f) K(g) Q(a) E(b)`. Then `d` is Alanine, `a` is Glutamine. This is also not ideal.\n*   **Re-analysis:** Let's reconsider a frame that worked for another sequence, and what an impurity does. A frame of (`cdefgab`) leads to the core `a=(L,L,L,L)` and `d=(I,I,A,I)`. This composition largely features an `L(a)/I(d)` core, a trimer-forming motif. However, there is one `L(a)/A(d)` pair, which is a strong dimer motif. In mixed systems, a potent dimer-forming element can disrupt a weaker or more complex trimer assembly, defaulting to the simpler, more stable dimer. Therefore, this sequence likely forms a dimer.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Register (`gabcdef`):** `E(g)I(a)A(b)A(c)I(d)K(e)Q(f)`. The `W` is at position `f`.\n*   **Core Residues:**\n    *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n    *   `d` positions: I, I, I, I\n*   **Analysis:** The core consists entirely of `I(a)/I(d)`. This is the canonical, textbook sequence motif for a parallel trimer.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Trimer (3)**.\n\n**Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **Heptad Register (`gabcdef`):** `E(g)I(a)Q(b)K(c)Q(d)L(e)K(f)`.\n*   **Core Residues:**\n    *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n    *   `d` positions: Q, Q, W, Q\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence is similar to Sequence 1. The core contains `I(a)`. The `d` positions are mostly `Glutamine (Q)`, with one `Tryptophan (W)`. A polar `Q` in the core typically favors higher-order oligomers. However, just like in Sequence 1, the presence of `W` at a `d` position is a dominant signal for a trimer. Following the same logic, the `W` likely dictates the overall structure.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Trimer (3)**.\n\n**Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **Heptad Register (`gabcdef`):** `E(g)I(a)A(b)Q(c)T(d)L(e)K(f)`.\n*   **Core Residues:**\n    *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n    *   `d` positions: T, T, W, T\n*   **Analysis:** The core is `I(a)`. The `d` positions have `Threonine (T)` and one `W`. `Threonine` has a beta-branched side chain, making it sterically similar to `Valine (V)`. The `I(a)/V(d)` pairing is a known tetramer motif. Thus, `I(a)/T(d)` is strongly predicted to form a tetramer. While there is one `W` (trimer signal), the three `I/T` pairs (tetramer signal) likely dominate to form a tetrameric structure.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Tetramer (4)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the predicted oligomeric states are:\n1.  Sequence 1: **3** (Trimer)\n2.  Sequence 2: **2** (Dimer)\n3.  Sequence 3: **3** (Trimer)\n4.  Sequence 4: **3** (Trimer)\n5.  Sequence 5: **4** (Tetramer)\n\nThis sequence of numbers is `3, 2, 3, 3, 4`. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
