    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poetic device in the line.\n\n**The Question:**\nWhat Latin poetic device, besides apostrophe/personification, any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance), and hyperbaton, can be found in Vergil's line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"?\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Translate and Understand the Line**\n\n*   **Line:** `Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum`\n*   **Word-by-word Breakdown:**\n    *   `Nascere`: \"Arise\" or \"Be born\" (2nd person singular imperative of *nascor*).\n    *   `praeque`: A combination of the preposition `prae` (\"before\") and the enclitic conjunction `-que` (\"and\").\n    *   `diem`: \"day\" (accusative singular).\n    *   `veniens`: \"coming\" (present active participle, modifying `Lucifer`).\n    *   `age`: \"Bring on\" or \"drive\" (2nd person singular imperative of *ago*).\n    *   `Lucifer`: \"Lucifer\" or \"Morning Star\" (vocative case, the one being addressed).\n    *   `almum`: \"nurturing\" or \"kindly\" (accusative singular adjective, modifying `diem`).\n*   **Translation:** \"Arise, and, coming before the day, bring on, O Morning Star, the nurturing day.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Exclude the Devices Listed in the Question**\n\nIt is crucial to first confirm the presence of the poetic devices that the question explicitly excludes from the answer.\n\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses an inanimate object (the Morning Star) as if it were a sentient being (`Lucifer`). This is clearly present.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There are instances of assonance (repetition of 'e' sounds in `pr**ae**que di**e**m veni**e**ns`) and consonance (repetition of 'c/k' sounds in `nas**c**ere`/`Lu**c**ifer`), but these are excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional disruption of normal word order. It is present in the line: the adjective `almum` (\"nurturing\") is placed at the very end of the line, separated from the noun it modifies, `diem` (\"day\"). This creates emphasis and fits the words neatly into the meter.\n\n**Step 3: Search for an Additional Poetic Device**\n\nNow, we must look for a figure of speech that is not on the excluded list. We will examine the meaning and logical structure of the sentence.\n\n*   The line is an instruction to `Lucifer`, the Morning Star.\n*   The phrase `prae diem veniens` means \"coming before the day.\"\n*   By definition, Lucifer *is* the star that \"comes before the day.\" Its name means \"light-bringer,\" and its astronomical function is to appear just before sunrise.\n*   Therefore, describing Lucifer as \"coming before the day\" is to state something that is already inherent in the identity of the subject.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and Define the Remaining Device**\n\nThe use of more words than are necessary to express an idea, especially for emphasis, is a rhetorical device.\n\n*   **Device:** **Pleonasm** (or Tautology).\n*   **Definition:** Pleonasm is the use of redundant words to emphasize a point or add stylistic richness. The information conveyed by the extra words is already implied or obvious from the context.\n*   **Application to the Line:** Vergil's command that Lucifer should come \"before the day\" (`prae diem veniens`) is a pleonasm because that is precisely what Lucifer, the Morning Star, does by its very nature. The phrase doesn't add new information but emphatically describes Lucifer's essential role as the harbinger of dawn.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Exclusions:** The main challenge is to ignore the very obvious devices (apostrophe, hyperbaton) and find another.\n2.  **Focus on Meaning, Not Just Form:** After ruling out devices based on word order (hyperbaton) and sound (alliteration, etc.), the next step is to analyze the semantic content and logical relationship between the words.\n3.  **Distinguishing Devices:** It is important not to misidentify the device. For example, this is not a *hysteron proteron* (reversal of temporal order), because Lucifer does \"arise\" and then \"come.\" It is not *tmesis* (splitting a compound word) because `prae` is a preposition governing `diem`, not part of a split compound verb.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter a full analysis of the line and careful consideration of the excluded devices, the most prominent remaining poetic device is pleonasm, found in the redundant yet emphatic description of Lucifer as \"coming before the day.\"\n\n<<<Pleonasm>>>"
