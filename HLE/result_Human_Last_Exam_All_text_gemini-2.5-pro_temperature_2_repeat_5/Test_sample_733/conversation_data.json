    "This problem asks for the number of finite groups, up to isomorphism, that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2. Let's break down the definitions and then find the groups that satisfy the property.\n\n### Step 1: Definitions\n\n*   **Group G**: A set with a binary operation satisfying the group axioms. We are considering finite groups.\n*   **Product-Free Set S**: A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all elements `x, y` in `S` (including the case `x=y`), their product `x*y` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S*S ∩ S = ∅`, where `S*S = {s1*s2 | s1, s2 ∈ S}`.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set**: A product-free set `S` is maximal (by inclusion) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g` in `G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Conditions for S = {a, b}\n\nLet `S = {a, b}` be a set of size 2 in a finite group `G`, with `a ≠ b`.\n\n1.  **S must be product-free.**\n    This means the set of products `S*S = {a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b}` must be disjoint from `S = {a, b}`.\n    Let `e` be the identity element.\n    *   If `a*a = a`, then `a=e`. If `a*b = a`, then `b=e`. To avoid such products being in `S`, it's clear that neither `a` nor `b` can be the identity element `e`. So, `e ∉ S`.\n    *   The other conditions are: `a^2 ≠ b`, `b^2 ≠ a`, `a*b` is not in `{a, b}` (which is guaranteed if `e ∉ S`), and `b*a` is not in `{a, b}` (also guaranteed if `e ∉ S`).\n    *   So, for `S={a,b}` to be product-free, we require: `a, b ≠ e` and `{a^2, b^2, ab, ba}` must not contain `a` or `b`.\n\n2.  **S must be maximal.**\n    For any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g} = {a, b, g}` must not be product-free.\n    This means there exist `x, y ∈ S'` such that `x*y ∈ S'`.\n    Since `S` is product-free, none of the products from `S*S` are in `S`. The maximality condition implies that for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, at least one of these new products must fall into `S'`:\n    *   A product from `S*S` is equal to `g` (e.g., `a^2=g`).\n    *   A product involving `g` is equal to an element of `S'` (e.g., `a*g=a`, `a*g=b`, `a*g=g`, `g*g=b`, etc.).\n\nThis condition puts a strong constraint on the structure of `G`. The group cannot be too large relative to the elements `a` and `b`, as every other element must be \"related\" to `a` and `b` in one of these ways.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Groups Systematically\n\nWe can test small groups to see if they satisfy the condition.\n\n*   **Groups of order 1, 2, 3**: Cannot contain a product-free set of size 2, as they don't have enough non-identity elements.\n*   **Groups of order 4**:\n    *   `C4 = {e, x, x^2, x^3}`: Let `S = {x, x^3}`. `S*S = {x^2, e}` which is disjoint from `S`. So `S` is product-free. The only other elements are `e` and `x^2`. `S ∪ {e}` is not product-free (`x*e=x`). `S ∪ {x^2}` is not product-free (`x*x=x^2`). So `S` is maximal. Thus, **C4** is a solution.\n    *   `C2 × C2 = {e, a, b, ab}`: Let `S = {a, b}`. `S*S = {e, ab}` which is disjoint from `S`. `S` is product-free. The other elements are `e` and `ab`. `S ∪ {e}` is not product-free. `S ∪ {ab}` is not product-free (`a*b=ab`). So `S` is maximal. Thus, **C2 × C2** is a solution.\n*   **Group of order 5**:\n    *   `C5 = {e, x, x^2, x^3, x^4}`: Let `S = {x, x^4}`. `S*S = {x^2, e, x^3}` is disjoint from `S`. The other elements are `e, x^2, x^3`. `S ∪ {e}` not p.f. `S ∪ {x^2}` not p.f. (`x*x=x^2`). `S ∪ {x^3}` not p.f. (`x^4*x^4 = x^8 = x^3`). So `S` is maximal. Thus, **C5** is a solution.\n*   **Groups of order 6**:\n    *   `C6 = {e, x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5}`: Let `S = {x, x^4}`. `S*S = {x^2, x^5}` is disjoint from `S`. The other elements are `{e, x^2, x^3, x^5}`. `S ∪ {e}` not p.f. `S ∪ {x^2}` not p.f. (`x*x=x^2`). `S ∪ {x^3}` not p.f. (`x*x^3=x^4`). `S ∪ {x^5}` not p.f. (`x*x^4=x^5`). So `S` is maximal. Thus, **C6** is a solution.\n    *   `S3 = {e, (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)}`: Let `S = {(12), (123)}`. `S*S = {e, (23), (13), (132)}` is disjoint from `S`. `S` is p.f. A check shows that for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free. For instance, if `g=(13)`, then `(123)*(12) = (13)`, which is in `S ∪ {g}`. This holds for all other `g`. Thus, **S3** is a solution.\n*   **Group of order 7**:\n    *   `C7 = {e, x, ..., x^6}`: Let `S = {x, x^6}`. `S*S = {x^2, e, x^5}` is disjoint from `S`. The other elements are `{e, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5}`. For each `g`, we can find a product in `S ∪ {g}`. E.g., for `g=x^3`, we have `(x^3)^2 = x^6 ∈ S`. For `g=x^4`, we have `(x^4)^2=x^8=x ∈ S`. This holds for all `g`. Thus, **C7** is a solution.\n\n### Step 4: Further Checks and Conclusion\n\nFurther analysis shows that larger groups like `C8`, `C2 × C4`, `(C2)^3`, `D8`, `Q8`, etc., do not have this property. For any chosen product-free set `S` of size 2, there is always at least one element `g` for which `S ∪ {g}` remains product-free, meaning `S` is not maximal.\n\nThe set of groups possessing a maximal product-free set of size 2 is surprisingly small. The list of isomorphism classes of such groups is:\n1.  `C4` (Cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  `C2 × C2` (Klein four-group)\n3.  `C5` (Cyclic group of order 5)\n4.  `C6` (Cyclic group of order 6)\n5.  `S3` (Symmetric group on 3 elements, which is also the Dihedral group `D6`)\n6.  `C7` (Cyclic group of order 7)\n\nCounting these distinct isomorphism classes, we find there are 6 such groups."
