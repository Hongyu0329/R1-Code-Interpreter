    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of such functions. We want to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of any function $f \\in S$.**\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** Since $f$ is a continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, it must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n    *   **Case 1: $f$ is strictly increasing.** If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f(f(x))$ is also strictly increasing. Since $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, this case is possible.\n    *   **Case 2: $f$ is strictly decreasing.** If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then for $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ again reverses the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means $f(f(x))$ is strictly increasing. Since $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, this case also seems possible at first glance.\n\n3.  **Existence of fixed points:** A fixed point of $f$ is a number $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. If such a point exists, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This would mean $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. However, the function $h(x) = \\exp(x) - x$ has a minimum value of $h(0) = 1$. Thus, $\\exp(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and there is no real number $x_0$ for which $\\exp(x_0)=x_0$. Therefore, $f$ cannot have any fixed points.\n\n4.  **Revisiting Monotonicity:** Let's reconsider the strictly decreasing case. If $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous and strictly decreasing function, then $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = L$ (where $L$ can be $+\\infty$) and $\\lim_{x\\to+\\infty} f(x) = M$ (where $M$ can be $-\\infty$). The function $g(x) = f(x) - x$ is continuous. We have $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}(f(x) - x) = +\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to+\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to+\\infty}(f(x) - x) = -\\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a point $x_0$ where $g(x_0) = 0$, which means $f(x_0)=x_0$. This contradicts our finding that $f$ has no fixed points. Thus, **no such strictly decreasing function $f$ exists.**\n    Therefore, any solution $f$ must be **strictly increasing**.\n\n5.  **Behavior of $f(x)$ vs $x$:** Since $f$ is strictly increasing, if we had $f(x_0) \\le x_0$ for some $x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) \\le f(x_0) \\le x_0$. But $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0) > x_0$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying $f$ (which is increasing) to $f(x) > x$ gives $f(f(x)) > f(x)$, so $\\exp(x) > f(x)$.\n    This gives us the bounds: $x < f(x) < \\exp(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n6.  **Range of $f$:** Let $R_f = f(\\mathbb{R})$ be the range of $f$. Since $f$ is continuous and strictly increasing, $R_f$ is an open interval $(a, b)$, where $a = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ and $b = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$.\n    The range of $f \\circ f$ is $f(R_f) = f((a,b)) = (0, \\infty)$.\n    Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $f((a,b)) = (\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y), \\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y))$.\n    Comparing this with $(0, \\infty)$, we get $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y) = \\infty$.\n    The condition $\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y) = \\infty$ implies that $b$ must be $\\infty$. So the range of $f$ is $(a, \\infty)$.\n    From $f(x)>x$, letting $x \\to a^+$, we get $\\lim_{x\\to a^+} f(x) \\ge a$, so $0 \\ge a$.\n    If $a = -\\infty$, then $f$ would be a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which implies its range must be $\\mathbb{R}$, not $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. A contradiction because the range of $f\\circ f$ requires $f(y)>0$ for $y$ in the range of $f$, meaning the range of $f$ can't be all of $\\mathbb{R}$. So $a$ must be a finite real number.\n    Since $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, we must have $f(a) = \\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)$. From $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y)=0$, we deduce $f(a)=0$.\n    Since $f$ is increasing, $a<0$ (as $f(0)>0$).\n\n**Step 2: Constructing the solutions.**\n\nOur analysis shows that any solution $f$ is characterized by a real number $a<0$ such that $f(a)=0$ and $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)=a$. This provides a basis for construction.\n\n1.  **Choose a parameter `a`:** Pick any real number $a < 0$.\n\n2.  **Choose a \"seed\" function `h`:** Let's define $f$ on the interval $[a, 0]$. Since $f$ must be continuous and strictly increasing, and we know $f(a)=0$ and $f(0) = f(f(a)) = \\exp(a)$, we must define $f$ as a continuous, strictly increasing function $h: [a, 0] \\to [0, \\exp(a)]$. For any chosen $a<0$, there are infinitely many such functions $h$. For instance, for any strictly increasing continuous bijection $\\psi: [0,1] \\to [0,1]$, we can define $h(x) = \\exp(a) \\cdot \\psi(\\frac{x}{a})$. There are continuum many choices for $\\psi$.\n\n3.  **Extend the function `f` to all of $\\mathbb{R}$:**\n    *   **For $x>0$:** The function $f$ can be constructed iteratively. On $[0, \\exp(a)]$, $f(x)$ is determined by its values on $[a,0]$. For any $y \\in [0, \\exp(a)]$, there is a unique $x \\in [a,0]$ such that $y = h(x) = f(x)$. Then we must have $f(y) = f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) = \\exp(h^{-1}(y))$. This defines $f$ on $[0, \\exp(a)]$. This process can be continued to cover all of $[a, \\infty)$.\n    *   **For $x<a$:** For an $x<a$, we must define $f(x)$. Let $y = f(x)$. Since $f$ is increasing and maps $(-\\infty, a)$ to $(a, 0)$, we have $y \\in (a,0)$. On this interval, $f$ is given by $h$. So $f(y) = h(y)$. The governing equation gives $f(y) = f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. Thus $h(y) = \\exp(x)$, which implies $y = h^{-1}(\\exp(x))$. So, for $x < a$, we define $f(x) = h^{-1}(\\exp(x))$.\n\n4.  **Verify the construction:**\n    *   The constructed function is continuous, including at the junction point $x=a$.\n    *   The condition $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = a$ is satisfied because as $x\\to-\\infty$, $\\exp(x)\\to 0^+$, so $f(x) = h^{-1}(\\exp(x)) \\to h^{-1}(0) = a$.\n    *   By construction, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ holds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the cardinality of the set of solutions.**\n\nA unique solution is generated for each pair $(a, h)$ where $a \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ and $h$ is a continuous strictly increasing bijection from $[a, 0]$ to $[0, \\exp(a)]$.\n\n1.  **Cardinality of choices for `a`:** The set of possible values for $a$ is the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$. The cardinality of this set is $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by $c$).\n\n2.  **Cardinality of choices for `h`:** For any fixed $a < 0$, we need to find the number of continuous strictly increasing bijections $h: [a, 0] \\to [0, \\exp(a)]$. This is equivalent to finding the number of continuous strictly increasing bijections from $[0, 1]$ to $[0, 1]$. We can specify that $h(a/2)$ can be any value in $(0, \\exp(a))$ and then construct a valid function, showing there are at least continuum many choices. It can be shown that the cardinality of this set of functions is also $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n3.  **Total Cardinality:** Since each pair $(a, h)$ corresponds to a unique solution, the total number of solutions is the product of the cardinalities of the sets of choices for $a$ and $h$.\n    $|S| = |\\{a\\}| \\times |\\{h\\}| = 2^{\\aleph_0} \\times 2^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of such functions is $2^{\\aleph_0}$, which is the cardinality of the continuum."
