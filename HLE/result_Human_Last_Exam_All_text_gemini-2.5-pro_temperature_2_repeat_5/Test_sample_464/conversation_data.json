    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the definitions and the question.**\n\n*   **Schwartz class function:** A function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is in the Schwartz space, denoted $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, if it is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) and all its derivatives decay faster than any inverse polynomial power. Formally, for all non-negative integers $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, the quantity $\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |x^\\alpha f^{(\\beta)}(x)|$ is finite. An example is the Gaussian function $f(x) = e^{-ax^2}$ for $a>0$.\n\n*   **The condition:** The moments of the function $f$ are all zero. The $k$-th moment of $f$ is defined as $m_k = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx$. We are given that $m_k = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$.\n\n*   **The question:** We need to determine if these conditions necessarily imply that the function $f$ is the zero function, i.e., $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**2. Formulate a strategy using the Fourier Transform.**\n\nThe Fourier transform is a particularly powerful tool for analyzing Schwartz functions because the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is also a Schwartz function. There is a well-known relationship between the moments of a function and the derivatives of its Fourier transform. This suggests that translating the given condition into the Fourier domain might simplify the problem.\n\n**3. Relate the moments of $f$ to its Fourier transform.**\n\nLet $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ denote the Fourier transform of $f(x)$. We will use the convention:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\nA fundamental property of the Fourier transform is that it maps $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ to itself. So, $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function.\n\nWe can compute the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ by differentiating under the integral sign. This operation is valid because $f$ is a Schwartz function, ensuring the necessary convergence.\n$$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(\\xi) = \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\frac{\\partial^k}{\\partial\\xi^k}(e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\nNow, let's evaluate these derivatives at the origin, $\\xi=0$:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{0} dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx $$\n\n**4. Apply the given condition to the Fourier transform.**\n\nWe are given that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Substituting this into the equation from the previous step gives:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, ... $$\nThis means that the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, which is a Schwartz function, has all of its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ equal to zero.\n\n**5. Analyze the implications for $\\hat{f}$.**\n\nNow we have a new problem: If a Schwartz function $g(\\xi) = \\hat{f}(\\xi)$ satisfies $g^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\geq 0$, does it follow that $g=0$?\n\nLet's consider the Taylor series expansion of $g(\\xi)$ around $\\xi=0$:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{g^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k $$\nSince all $g^{(k)}(0)=0$, this Taylor series is identically zero.\n\nFor a general $C^\\infty$ function, this does not imply that the function itself is zero (the classic counterexample is $h(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$ for $x\\neq 0$, $h(0)=0$). However, Schwartz functions are not arbitrary $C^\\infty$ functions; they are much more well-behaved.\n\nIt is a standard (though non-trivial) theorem in analysis that any Schwartz function $g$ satisfying $g^{(k)}(x_0)=0$ for some point $x_0$ and all $k\\geq 0$ must be identically zero. This property is sometimes referred to by saying the space of Schwartz functions is *quasi-analytic*.\n\n*Proof sketch for this property:* One can use Taylor's theorem with an integral remainder:\n$$ g(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{(N-1)!} \\int_0^\\xi (\\xi - t)^{N-1} g^{(N)}(t) dt $$\nBy using the decay properties of Schwartz functions to carefully bound $|g^{(N)}(t)|$, one can show that for any fixed $\\xi$, the remainder term goes to zero as $N \\to \\infty$. This implies $g(\\xi)=0$.\n\nAccepting this property, since $\\hat{f} \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ and all its derivatives vanish at $\\xi=0$, we must have $\\hat{f}(\\xi)=0$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**6. Conclude about the original function $f$.**\n\nWe have established that the Fourier transform of $f$ is the zero function. The Fourier transform on the space of Schwartz functions is an isomorphism, which means it is a one-to-one mapping. Therefore, the only function whose Fourier transform is zero is the zero function itself.\n$$ \\hat{f} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad f = 0 $$\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correctly apply properties of Schwartz functions:** The key is that not only is $f$ in $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, but its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also in $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n2.  **Derivative-Moment relation:** The formula connecting $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)$ and the $k$-th moment of $f$ is central to the argument.\n3.  **The crux of the proof:** The most difficult step is recognizing that a Schwartz function with all derivatives vanishing at a single point must be the zero function. This is a special property not shared by all $C^\\infty$ functions.\n4.  **Injectivity of the Fourier Transform:** The final step relies on the fact that the Fourier transform on $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ is injective (or an isomorphism), so $\\hat{f}=0$ uniquely determines $f=0$.\n\nThe argument holds, and the conclusion is that $f$ must be the zero function.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nYes, it follows that $f = 0$.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
