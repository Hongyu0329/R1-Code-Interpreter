    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio `Δp / p`, where:\n*   `Δp` is the uncertainty in the momentum of the electron.\n*   `p` is the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Given Information and Necessary Constants**\n*   **Given:** The uncertainty in the electron's position, `Δx = 10 pm`.\n*   **Context:** The electron is in the **first Bohr orbit**, which means the principal quantum number `n = 1`.\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Planck's constant, `h ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`.\n    *   Radius of the first Bohr orbit (Bohr radius), `r₁ ≈ 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum (`Δp`)**\nThis calculation is based on Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.\n*   **Formula:** The principle states `Δx * Δp ≥ h / (4π)`. To find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality: `Δp = h / (4π * Δx)`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Momentum (`p`) in the First Bohr Orbit**\nThis calculation is based on Bohr's model of the atom.\n*   **Formula:** Bohr's postulate for the quantization of angular momentum is `L = mvr = n * (h / 2π)`.\n*   Since momentum `p = mv`, we can rewrite the angular momentum as `L = p * r`.\n*   For the first orbit (`n=1`), the formula becomes `p * r₁ = 1 * (h / 2π)`.\n*   Rearranging for momentum `p`, we get: `p = h / (2π * r₁)`.\n\n**Step 5: Form the Ratio `Δp / p` and Simplify**\nNow, we create the ratio using the expressions from Step 3 and Step 4.\n*   Ratio = `Δp / p = [h / (4π * Δx)] / [h / (2π * r₁)]`\n*   To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:\n    Ratio = `(h / (4π * Δx)) * (2π * r₁ / h)`\n*   We can cancel `h` from the numerator and denominator, and simplify the `2π / 4π` term:\n    Ratio = `(2π * r₁) / (4π * Δx)`\n    Ratio = `r₁ / (2 * Δx)`\nThis simplified formula is the most direct way to get the answer.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Unit Consistency:** The given uncertainty in position `Δx` is in picometers (pm). It must be converted to SI units (meters, m) to be consistent with the Bohr radius.\n    *   `1 pm = 10⁻¹² m`\n    *   Therefore, `Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m`.\n2.  **Formulas:** Using the correct formulas for both the uncertainty principle and Bohr's model is crucial. The simplification in Step 5 helps avoid calculation errors by canceling Planck's constant.\n3.  **Physical Models:** This problem uniquely combines two fundamental concepts of early quantum mechanics: Heisenberg's principle (which highlights the inherent uncertainty and wave-particle duality) and the Bohr model (a semi-classical model with quantized orbits).\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nUsing the simplified formula `Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)` and plugging in the values:\n\n*   `r₁ = 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m`\n*   `Δx = 10 x 10⁻¹² m`\n\nRatio = `(5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m) / (2 * 10 x 10⁻¹² m)`\n\nRatio = `(5.29 x 10⁻¹¹) / (20 x 10⁻¹²)`\n\nRatio = `(5.29 x 10⁻¹¹) / (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹)`\n\nRatio = `5.29 / 2.0`\n\nRatio = `2.645`\n\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
