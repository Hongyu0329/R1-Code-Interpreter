    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Second Great War\nThe Second Great War is the name given to the pan-galactic conflict depicted throughout the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*). It is a separate conflict from the original Great War and the Brood War.\n\n### Step 2: Determining the Start Date\nThe Second Great War is canonically considered to have begun in the year **2504**. This is marked by the renewal of large-scale Zerg Swarm attacks on Terran Dominion worlds, which is the inciting incident of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the End Date\nThe war has several major turning points, but the ultimate conflict is against the dark god Amon. This conflict, known as the End War, reaches its climax and conclusion in the epilogue of *Legacy of the Void*, titled \"Into the Void\". According to the official StarCraft lore timeline, these final events take place in the year **2506**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Duration\n*   **Start Year:** 2504\n*   **End Year:** 2506\n\nThe war takes place across parts of three consecutive years:\n1.  **Year 2504:** The events of *Wings of Liberty*.\n2.  **Year 2505:** The events of *Heart of the Swarm*.\n3.  **Year 2506:** The events of *Legacy of the Void* and its epilogue.\n\nThe total elapsed time from a point in 2504 to a point in 2506 is more than two full years, but less than three full years. For example, if it started in March 2504 and ended in September 2506, the duration would be approximately 2.5 years.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Rounding Rule\nThe question explicitly asks for the duration to be **rounded up** to the nearest whole year.\n*   The calculated duration is `2.x` years (some value greater than 2).\n*   Rounding any number greater than 2 up to the next whole number results in 3.\n\nTherefore, the length of the Second Great War, rounded up to the nearest year, is 3 years.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Distinction from other wars:** It's important not to confuse the Second Great War with the original Great War (2499-2500) or the Brood War (2500).\n*   **Defining the scope:** The war encompasses the entire story arc of the *StarCraft II* trilogy, not just one of the campaigns. The end of *Wings of Liberty* or *Heart of the Swarm* are major turning points, but not the end of the entire war.\n*   **Rounding direction:** The instruction to \"round up\" is critical. A standard rounding of a duration like 2.4 years would be 2, but rounding *up* makes it 3. Since the conflict spans across three calendar years, its duration is definitively greater than two full years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
