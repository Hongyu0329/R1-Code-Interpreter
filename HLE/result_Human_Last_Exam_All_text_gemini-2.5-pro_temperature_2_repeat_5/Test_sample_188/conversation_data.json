  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols.

    "This is an information theory problem disguised as a story. Let's break it down to find the maximum possible length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the encoding alphabet and the medium.**\n*   **Message Alphabet (the things we want to encode):** The secret message is written using the \"letters in the Shu\". The problem states that the Shu uses \"only 120 most common Chinese characters\". Therefore, our alphabet has 120 unique characters.\n*   **Encoding Medium (the things we use to encode with):** The message is hidden in the Ching book, which contains 9999 symbols. We need to figure out the information capacity of each symbol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of states for a single symbol in the Ching.**\n*   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n*   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possible states (yin or yang).\n*   \"Wuxing\" (The Five Elements) has 5 possible states (metal, wood, water, fire, or earth).\n*   To find the total number of unique states for one symbol, we multiply the possibilities: 2 (yinyang) * 5 (wuxing) = 10 states.\n*   So, each of the 9999 symbols can be one of 10 different types. This is a base-10 encoding system.\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many symbols are needed to encode one message character.**\n*   We need to represent any of the 120 different message characters using a sequence of these 10-state symbols.\n*   Let `N` be the number of symbols from the Ching required to encode one character of the message.\n*   With `N` symbols, we can represent `10^N` different combinations.\n*   To successfully encode all 120 characters, the number of combinations must be greater than or equal to the size of our alphabet. So, we need to find the smallest integer `N` that satisfies the inequality: `10^N >= 120`.\n*   Let's test values for `N`:\n    *   If `N = 1`: `10^1 = 10`. This is less than 120, so 1 symbol is not enough.\n    *   If `N = 2`: `10^2 = 100`. This is still less than 120, so 2 symbols are not enough.\n    *   If `N = 3`: `10^3 = 1000`. This is greater than 120, so 3 symbols are sufficient to uniquely represent any of the 120 characters.\n*   Therefore, the most efficient encoding scheme (which allows for the longest possible message) uses **3 symbols** from the Ching to represent **1 character** of the message.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the maximum length of the message.**\n*   We have a total of 9999 symbols available in the Ching.\n*   Each character of the secret message costs us 3 of these symbols.\n*   Maximum message length = (Total available symbols) / (Symbols used per character)\n*   Maximum message length = 9999 / 3\n*   Maximum message length = 3333 characters.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Irrelevant Information:** The problem includes several numbers that are red herrings designed to distract. These include:\n    *   The total characters in the Shu (~3000). The important number is the alphabet size, which is 120.\n    *   The computer vision recognition time (12 ms).\n    *   The computation times for integer and float operations (10 ns and 30 ns).\n    These values have no impact on the calculation of the message length.\n\n2.  **Determining States:** The key to finding the base of the encoding system is to correctly combine the possibilities of \"yinyang\" (2) and \"wuxing\" (5) to get 10 states per symbol.\n\n3.  **Inequality:** The core of the problem is setting up and solving the inequality `10^N >= 120` to find the minimum number of symbols (`N`) needed per character. To maximize the message length, one must use the most efficient block size, which is this minimum `N`.\n\n4.  **Integer Division:** The total number of symbols (9999) divides perfectly by the symbols per character (3). If it didn't, we would need to take the floor of the result, as you cannot encode a partial character. For example, if we had 10000 symbols, `10000 / 3 = 3333.33...`, the maximum length would be `floor(3333.33) = 3333` characters, with one symbol left over.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nTotal available symbols = 9999\nSymbols required per character = 3\nMaximum message length = 9999 / 3 = 3333\n\n<<<3333>>>"
