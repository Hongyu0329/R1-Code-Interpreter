    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure and Context:** The question asks about the Ming General Mu Sheng (Vietnamese: Mộc Thạnh). His most significant involvement in Vietnam was during the Ming Dynasty's occupation in the early 15th century, particularly against the Lam Sơn Uprising led by Lê Lợi.\n\n2.  **Define \"First Major Defeat\":** A \"major defeat\" implies a significant battle where the army under Mu Sheng's direct command was decisively beaten, resulting in a strategic failure. While the Ming forces suffered various setbacks during the decade-long war, we need to find the first large-scale battle that was a personal command failure for Mu Sheng.\n\n3.  **Examine the Timeline of the Lam Sơn Uprising:** The war reached its climax in 1427. The Ming Emperor sent a massive two-pronged invasion to crush the Vietnamese rebellion once and for all.\n    *   One army, led by General Liu Sheng (Liễu Thăng), advanced from Guangxi in the north.\n    *   The second army, under the command of Mu Sheng, advanced from Yunnan in the west.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Defeat:** The Vietnamese forces, under the strategic command of Lê Lợi and Nguyễn Trãi, focused on destroying Liu Sheng's army first. They successfully lured it into a series of ambushes, culminating in the decisive Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang, where Liu Sheng was killed and his 100,000-strong army was annihilated.\n\n5.  **Trace Mu Sheng's movements:** While Liu Sheng's army was being destroyed, Mu Sheng's army had advanced into Vietnamese territory. When news of Liu Sheng's catastrophic defeat reached Mu Sheng, his troops were struck with panic and their morale collapsed.\n\n6.  **Locate the Site of the Battle:** Lê Lợi immediately ordered his generals, Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, to intercept Mu Sheng's demoralized forces. They engaged Mu Sheng's army at Lãnh Câu (also referred to as Lãnh Cẩu) and Đan Xá. Here, the Vietnamese forces won a decisive victory. Mu Sheng's army was routed, and he was forced to abandon his supplies and flee in disarray back to Yunnan. This battle was a direct, personal, and major defeat for him as a commander.\n\n7.  **Identify the Modern Location:** Historical records and geographical studies of the Lam Sơn Uprising place the battle sites of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá in the region of the Đáy River. This area corresponds to the modern-day **Ninh Bình Province**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing between different defeats:** It is important not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with the more famous defeat of Liu Sheng at Chi Lăng (which is in modern Lạng Sơn Province). Mu Sheng's defeat happened shortly after, in a different location, and was a direct consequence of Liu Sheng's demise.\n*   **\"First\" major defeat:** While Mu Sheng faced resistance and difficulties earlier in the war, the rout at Lãnh Câu in 1427 was the first time an entire grand army under his personal field command was decisively smashed and forced into a panicked retreat, marking a major strategic failure.\n*   **Historical place names:** Vietnamese historical place names can be transliterated in various ways (e.g., Lãnh Câu, Lãnh Cẩu) and require careful mapping to modern administrative units.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the location.\n\n<<<Ninh Bình Province>>>"
