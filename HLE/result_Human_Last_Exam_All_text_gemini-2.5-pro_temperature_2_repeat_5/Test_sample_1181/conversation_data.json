    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* based on a specific emotional sentiment: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This isn't just about missing Earth, but about the shame associated with having lost that connection.\n\n2.  **Character Evaluation:** We need to analyze the psychological state and role of each character in the film.\n    *   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist who has just arrived from Earth. The film opens with him on Earth, surrounded by nature, including the sounds of water and leaves. He is still deeply connected to Earth and his memories of it. His main conflict is with the reappearance of his dead wife, Hari, not with having forgotten his home.\n    *   **B. Hari:** Hari is a \"Visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memories created by the Solaris ocean. She has no memory of Earth herself, only the memories that Kris has of her. Therefore, she cannot miss something she never experienced.\n    *   **C. Dr. Snaut:** Snaut is one of the two surviving scientists Kris meets on the station. He has been in space for a very long time and has become weary, cynical, and highly philosophical. He often talks about humanity's purpose, its limitations, and the profound alienation of being so far from home. A statement expressing shame over losing a fundamental human sensory memory like the rustling of leaves perfectly fits his introspective and pained character. He has been disconnected from Earth for so long that he feels his own humanity is eroding, which causes him distress and shame.\n    *   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** Sartorius is the other surviving scientist. He is cold, rigid, and focused solely on the scientific aspects of their situation. He views emotions and nostalgia as weaknesses that interfere with his work. It would be highly out of character for him to admit to such a sentimental feeling, let alone express shame over it.\n    *   **E. Gibarian:** Gibarian is the scientist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. Kris watches his final, frantic video message. Gibarian is clearly tormented, but his message is a direct warning about the Visitors and the psychological horror of the station. He does not engage in the kind of poignant, long-term philosophical reflection that the question describes.\n\n3.  **Pinpointing the Dialogue:** In the film, during one of his long, philosophical conversations with Kris, it is Dr. Snaut who reflects on their deep isolation from Earth. He laments how they have lost their connection to their home, to the point of not being able to recall simple sensory details. This feeling of having lost a part of their humanity is a source of shame for him. The specific sentiment about being ashamed to have forgotten such an earthly sound belongs to him.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Source Material:** The question specifically refers to the *1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie*, not the Stanislaw Lem novel or the 2002 Steven Soderbergh film, where characterizations can differ.\n*   **Emotion vs. Action:** The key is the word \"ashamed.\" Many characters might miss Earth, but only one expresses this particular complex emotion about it. Snaut's character is defined by this kind of intellectual and existential pain.\n*   **Character Arcs:** Kris's arc is about confronting his past. Hari's is about becoming human. Sartorius's is about maintaining scientific control. Snaut's is about grappling with the loss of his own humanity in the face of the unknown. The statement in question aligns perfectly with Snaut's arc.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of each character's personality, dialogue, and thematic role in the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. He is the one who articulates the profound psychological cost of long-term isolation from Earth.\n\n<<<C>>>"
