The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is highly dependent on the specific application due to different catalytic mechanisms.
For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, where Ni acts as an active phase supported on ceria, the optimal molar ratio of Ni/Ce is relatively high, typically in the range of **0.25 to 0.40**.
For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS), where Ni functions as a dopant to enhance the redox properties of the ceria lattice, a much lower concentration is ideal. The optimal molar ratio of Ni/Ce is in the range of **0.01 to 0.11**.
