    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy for a system of light quanta (photons) using the framework of large deviation theory (LDT). The two specific theorems mentioned, Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff, provide a formal probabilistic foundation for the standard methods of statistical mechanics.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Characterizing the System and the Role of LDT**\n\n*   **System**: The system consists of light quanta (photons), which are massless bosons. A crucial property of photons in a cavity is that their total number is not conserved, as they can be emitted and absorbed by the walls. In the language of statistical mechanics, this means their chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem connects the probability of an empirical distribution to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. For a physical system, the KL divergence is essentially the negative of the entropy (up to a constant factor and $k_B$). The theorem implies that the probability of observing a macrostate is exponentially related to its entropy: $P(\\text{state}) \\sim e^{S/k_B}$. The equilibrium state, being the most probable state, is therefore the one that maximizes the entropy ($S$) subject to any existing physical constraints.\n*   **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem relates the probability of large deviations of a sample mean to a \"rate function,\" which is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the log-moment-generating function. In statistical mechanics, the logarithm of the partition function ($\\ln Z$) plays the role of the log-moment-generating function (or more accurately, the scaled cumulant generating function). Mean macroscopic quantities, like energy, are found by taking derivatives of $\\ln Z$. This theorem provides the formal justification for this procedure.\n\n**2. Finding the Equilibrium Distribution using Maximum Entropy (Boltzmann-Sanov)**\n\nWe maximize the entropy for a Bose gas subject to the constraint of a fixed average total energy, $U$. Since particle number is not conserved, there is no constraint on the total number of particles.\n\n*   The entropy of a gas of bosons distributed among energy states $\\epsilon_i$ is given by:\n    $S = k_B \\sum_i [ (\\langle n_i \\rangle + 1) \\ln(\\langle n_i \\rangle + 1) - \\langle n_i \\rangle \\ln \\langle n_i \\rangle ]$\n    (assuming degeneracy $g_i=1$ for each quantum state).\n*   The constraint is on the total energy: $U = \\sum_i \\langle n_i \\rangle \\epsilon_i$.\n*   Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we maximize $S/k_B - \\beta(U - \\sum_i \\langle n_i \\rangle \\epsilon_i)$. The parameter $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint, which will be identified with $1/(k_B T)$.\n*   Taking the derivative with respect to the mean occupation number $\\langle n_j \\rangle$ and setting it to zero yields:\n    $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\langle n_j \\rangle} [ (\\langle n_j \\rangle + 1) \\ln(\\langle n_j \\rangle + 1) - \\langle n_j \\rangle \\ln \\langle n_j \\rangle ] - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n    $\\ln(\\frac{\\langle n_j \\rangle + 1}{\\langle n_j \\rangle}) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$\n*   Solving for $\\langle n_j \\rangle$ gives the equilibrium distribution, which is the Planck distribution (or Bose-Einstein distribution with $\\mu=0$):\n    $\\langle n_i \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n\n**3. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**\n\nThe total mean energy is the sum of the energies of all occupied states. We convert the sum to an integral using the density of states for photons in a 3D volume $V$.\n\n*   **Density of states**: For photons (which have two polarization states), the number of quantum states with energy between $\\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon+d\\epsilon$ is:\n    $g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{V \\epsilon^2}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3} d\\epsilon$\n*   **Mean Energy Calculation**:\n    $U = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\left(\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon}-1}\\right) \\frac{V \\epsilon^2}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3} d\\epsilon$\n    $U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon}-1} d\\epsilon$\n*   Let $x = \\beta\\epsilon$. The integral becomes:\n    $U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3} \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\n*   The definite integral is a standard form: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n*   Substituting this back and replacing $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n    $U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3} (k_B T)^4 \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^4$\n\nThis is the famous Stefan-Boltzmann law for the energy of blackbody radiation.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nThe entropy can be calculated using the thermodynamic relationship $S = (U - \\Omega)/T$, where $\\Omega$ is the grand potential. The LDT framework justifies finding thermodynamic potentials from the partition function.\n\n*   **Grand Potential ($\\Omega$)**: $\\Omega = -k_B T \\ln \\mathcal{Z}$, where $\\mathcal{Z}$ is the grand partition function. For non-interacting bosons:\n    $\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = -\\sum_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_i - \\mu)})$. For photons, $\\mu=0$.\n    $\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = -\\sum_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})$\n*   Converting the sum to an integral:\n    $\\Omega = -k_B T \\int_0^\\infty g(\\epsilon) \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}) d\\epsilon = -k_B T \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^2 \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}) d\\epsilon$\n*   Evaluating this integral (via integration by parts) shows that it is related to the energy integral:\n    $\\Omega = -\\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^4 \\right) = -\\frac{U}{3}$\n*   **Entropy Calculation**:\n    $S = \\frac{U - \\Omega}{T} = \\frac{U - (-U/3)}{T} = \\frac{4U}{3T}$\n*   Substituting the expression for $U$:\n    $S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^4\\right) = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^3$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for mean energy ($U$) and entropy ($S$) for the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas) in a volume $V$ at temperature $T$ are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n$U(V, T) = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^4$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n$S(V, T) = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^3$\n\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $U = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^4$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^3$\n>>>"
