    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in two patches of surface code with a total of two holes.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Encoding Capacity of a Single Surface Code Patch\n\nA standard \"patch\" of planar surface code is a finite 2D array of physical qubits designed to encode logical information.\n*   **A patch with no holes:** Due to its external boundaries, a standard planar surface code patch can encode **one** logical qubit. The logical operators are defined as strings of physical operators that span from one boundary to another.\n*   **Adding holes to a patch:** When a hole is created within the patch, it introduces a new internal boundary. This new boundary can be used to define a new, independent pair of logical operators. A logical Z operator can be a loop of physical Z's around the hole, and a corresponding logical X operator can be a string of physical X's from the hole to the outer boundary. Each hole adds the capacity to store one additional logical qubit.\n*   **Formula for a single patch:** Therefore, the number of logical qubits ($k$) that can be encoded on a single patch with $H$ holes is given by the formula:\n    $k = 1 + H$\n\n### Step 2: Define the System Configuration\n\nThe problem specifies a system composed of:\n*   **Two separate patches** of surface code (let's call them Patch 1 and Patch 2). Since they are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits on each patch.\n    $k_{total} = k_{patch1} + k_{patch2}$\n*   **A total of two holes.** These two holes can be distributed between the two patches in different ways.\n\nLet $H_1$ be the number of holes on Patch 1 and $H_2$ be the number of holes on Patch 2. The given constraint is:\n$H_1 + H_2 = 2$\n(where $H_1$ and $H_2$ must be non-negative integers).\n\n### Step 3: Express the Total Number of Logical Qubits\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1, we can express the number of qubits on each patch in terms of the number of holes:\n*   Qubits on Patch 1: $k_{patch1} = 1 + H_1$\n*   Qubits on Patch 2: $k_{patch2} = 1 + H_2$\n\nThe total number of logical qubits in the system is:\n$k_{total} = (1 + H_1) + (1 + H_2)$\n$k_{total} = 2 + H_1 + H_2$\n\nSubstituting the constraint $H_1 + H_2 = 2$:\n$k_{total} = 2 + 2 = 4$\n\nThis shows that the total number of logical qubits is independent of how the holes are distributed.\n\n### Step 4: Verify with All Possible Distributions\n\nTo be certain, we can check all possible ways to distribute the two holes and confirm that the maximum number is indeed 4. The possible distributions for $(H_1, H_2)$ are (2, 0), (1, 1), and (0, 2).\n\n*   **Case A: Holes distributed as (2, 0)**\n    *   Patch 1 has 2 holes: $k_1 = 1 + 2 = 3$ logical qubits.\n    *   Patch 2 has 0 holes: $k_2 = 1 + 0 = 1$ logical qubit.\n    *   Total qubits: $k_{total} = 3 + 1 = 4$.\n\n*   **Case B: Holes distributed as (1, 1)**\n    *   Patch 1 has 1 hole: $k_1 = 1 + 1 = 2$ logical qubits.\n    *   Patch 2 has 1 hole: $k_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$ logical qubits.\n    *   Total qubits: $k_{total} = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Case C: Holes distributed as (0, 2)**\n    *   This is symmetric to Case A.\n    *   Patch 1 has 0 holes: $k_1 = 1 + 0 = 1$ logical qubit.\n    *   Patch 2 has 2 holes: $k_2 = 1 + 2 = 3$ logical qubits.\n    *   Total qubits: $k_{total} = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn all possible configurations, the total number of logical qubits is 4. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
