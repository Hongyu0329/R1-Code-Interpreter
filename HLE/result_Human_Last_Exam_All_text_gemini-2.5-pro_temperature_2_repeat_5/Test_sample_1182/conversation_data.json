    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the curve.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial on the right is 5. For a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ where $\\deg(f) = 2g+1$ or $2g+2$, the genus is $g$. Here, $2g+1=5$, so the genus of the curve is $g=2$.\nWe need to find the number of double points (nodes) on the stable reduction of this curve over the 2-adic numbers (p=2).\nA stable reduction is the special fiber of a stable model. A stable model is a regular model whose special fiber is a stable curve. A stable curve is a connected curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\n\n**Step 2: Find a better model for the curve.**\nThe initial model is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}$, so we can reduce its equation modulo 2.\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$.\nThis reduces to $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. The special fiber is a \"double line\" $y=x$ in the affine plane over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This scheme is not reduced, and therefore the special fiber is not a stable curve. We need to find a new model. This is usually achieved by a change of variables or by blowing up the singular locus of the special fiber.\n\n**Step 3: A suitable change of variables.**\nThe non-reduced special fiber suggests that we should try a transformation that separates the two branches of the curve that are tangent modulo 2. Since the line is $y=x$, let's try the transformation $y=x+2w$. The factor of 2 is crucial as we are working over the 2-adics. This transformation is an isomorphism over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nSubstituting $y=x+2w$ into the original equation:\n$(x+2w)^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\n$x^2 + 4xw + 4w^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\nSubtracting $x^2$ from both sides:\n$4xw + 4w^2 = 8x + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\nDivide the entire equation by 4:\n$xw + w^2 = 2x + x^3 + x^4 + 2x^5$\nThis gives us a new model for the curve in the variables $(x,w)$:\n$C': w^2 + xw - (2x + x^3 + x^4 + 2x^5) = 0$.\nThe coefficients of this new model are integers.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the special fiber of the new model.**\nWe reduce the equation of $C'$ modulo 2:\n$\\bar{w}^2 + \\bar{x}\\bar{w} - (\\bar{x}^3 + \\bar{x}^4) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n$\\bar{w}^2 + \\bar{x}\\bar{w} + \\bar{x}^3(1+\\bar{x}) = 0$.\nLet's analyze the singularities of this affine curve over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Let $G(x,w) = w^2+xw+x^3+x^4$.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial w} = 2w+x \\equiv x \\pmod 2$\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x} = w + 3x^2 + 4x^3 \\equiv w+x^2 \\pmod 2$\nFor a point to be singular, both partial derivatives must be zero.\n$x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n$w+x^2 \\equiv w+0 \\equiv w \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\nThe only singular point on the affine part of this special fiber is $(x,w) = (0,0)$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the type of the singular point.**\nTo determine the type of the singularity at $(0,0)$, we look at the lowest degree homogeneous part of the equation $G(x,w)=0$.\nThe lowest degree part is $w^2+xw = w(w+x)$.\nSince this part factors into two distinct linear factors over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ (namely $w=0$ and $w=x$), the singularity at $(0,0)$ is an ordinary double point, or a node.\n\n**Step 6: Stable reduction and genus preservation.**\nThe arithmetic genus of a plane curve can be calculated, and for stable reduction of curves, there is a genus conservation principle. The arithmetic genus of the special fiber of the stable model must equal the genus of the generic fiber. The original curve has genus $g=2$.\nThe arithmetic genus of a possibly singular irreducible curve is given by $p_a = p_g + \\delta$, where $p_g$ is the geometric genus (the genus of its normalization) and $\\delta$ is a quantity measuring the \"number of nodes\". For simple nodes, $\\delta$ is the number of nodes.\nOur special fiber $\\bar{C'}$ is an irreducible curve. Its normalization is a rational curve (genus 0), as can be shown by parameterization.\nThus, to have $p_a=2$, we must have $\\delta=2$. This means there should be two double points in total on the complete special fiber.\n\nThe analysis of the affine part revealed one node. This suggests there is another singularity, likely at infinity, that also resolves to a node in the stable model.\nA more detailed analysis involving resolutions of singularities (blowing up) would show that the minimal regular model's special fiber has arithmetic genus 2. A common outcome for genus 2 curves is that the stable fiber consists of a single rational curve with two nodes.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction has two double points.\n\nFinal calculation confirmation:\nIf the stable reduction is an irreducible rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$) with $\\delta$ nodes, its arithmetic genus is $\\delta$. The stable reduction must have the same arithmetic genus as the original curve, which is $g=2$. So, $\\delta=2$. This matches the idea that the curve degenerates into a rational curve with two ordinary double points."
