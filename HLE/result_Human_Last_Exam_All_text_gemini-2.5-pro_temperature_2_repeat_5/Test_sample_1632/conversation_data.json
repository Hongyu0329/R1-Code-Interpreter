    "**Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe user is asking for the value of `a(10)`, where `a(n)` is the number of `n`-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice. Let's break down the problem to understand all the components and constraints.\n\n1.  **Manhattan Lattice:** This is the standard 2D square grid, also known as the square lattice. The vertices of the lattice are points with integer coordinates (x, y). A move on this lattice is from a point (x, y) to one of its four nearest neighbors: (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), or (x, y-1).\n\n2.  **n-step Walk:** A walk of `n` steps is a sequence of `n+1` vertices `v0, v1, ..., vn`, where `vi` and `v(i+1)` are neighbors for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. By convention, the walk starts at the origin, so `v0 = (0,0)`.\n\n3.  **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk is self-avoiding if it never visits the same vertex more than once. This means all vertices `v0, v1, ..., vn` in the sequence must be distinct.\n\n4.  **a(n):** This function represents the total count of all possible `n`-step self-avoiding walks starting from the origin.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation for Small n**\n\nTo illustrate the counting process and its increasing complexity, let's calculate the first few values of `a(n)`.\n\n*   **a(0):** There is one walk of 0 steps: staying at the origin. So, `a(0) = 1`.\n\n*   **a(1):** From the origin (0,0), we can take one step to four different neighboring points: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1). All are distinct from the origin.\n    Therefore, `a(1) = 4`.\n\n*   **a(2):** Let's consider any of the 4 one-step walks, for example, to (1,0). From (1,0), the neighbors are (0,0), (2,0), (1,1), and (1,-1). To be self-avoiding, the walk cannot return to (0,0). This leaves 3 possible moves: to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1). Since each of the 4 initial walks has 3 possible extensions, the total number of 2-step SAWs is:\n    `a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12`.\n\n*   **a(3):** From each of the 12 two-step walks, we consider the next step. Let the walk be `v0 -> v1 -> v2`. The next step to `v3` is valid if `v3` is not equal to `v0` or `v1` (it can't be `v2` as that would be backtracking). For any 2-step walk, the endpoint `v2` is not a neighbor of the start point `v0` (the distance is either 2 or sqrt(2)). Therefore, a non-backtracking move from `v2` can't land on `v0`. This means for every 2-step walk, there are 3 valid moves for the third step.\n    `a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36`.\n\n*   **a(4):** Here, the calculation becomes more complex. We start with the 36 three-step walks. From the endpoint `v3`, a move to `v4` is invalid if `v4` is a previously visited point (`v0`, `v1`, or `v2`). A move back to `v2` is always disallowed. So we have at most 3 choices. However, `v4` could be `v0`. This happens if the endpoint `v3` is a neighbor of the origin `v0`.\n    Let's analyze this. A 3-step path like (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1) ends at `v3=(0,1)`, which is a neighbor of `v0=(0,0)`. For such a path, one of the three non-backtracking moves (to (0,0)) is forbidden.\n    *   **How many such paths are there?** These are paths that form three sides of a unit square. Example paths to (0,1) are (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1) and (0,0)->(-1,0)->(-1,1)->(0,1). There are 2 such paths ending at each of the 4 neighbors of the origin. So, there are `2 * 4 = 8` such paths.\n    *   The total number of non-backtracking extensions is `a(3) * 3 = 36 * 3 = 108`.\n    *   We must subtract the 8 forbidden moves that would return to the origin.\n    *   Therefore, `a(4) = 108 - 8 = 100`.\n\n*   **a(5):** We follow the same logic. `a(5)` is derived from `a(4)=100` paths. The total number of non-backtracking extensions is `100 * 3 = 300`. We must subtract the walks where the 5th step lands on `v0`, `v1`, or `v2`.\n    *   A walk of 4 steps `v0->...->v4`. The next step `v5` cannot land on `v0` or `v2`. (A parity argument shows `v4` can't be a neighbor of `v0`, and a distance argument shows `v4` can't be a neighbor of `v2`).\n    *   The only possible conflict is if `v4` is a neighbor of `v1`. We must count the number of 4-step SAWs where the endpoint `v4` is adjacent to `v1`.\n    *   After a detailed case-by-case analysis (counting 3-step SAWs from `v1` that end at a neighbor of `v1`, while avoiding `v0`), it can be found that there are exactly 16 such configurations.\n    *   `a(5) = 300 - 16 = 284`.\n\n**The Problem for n=10**\n\nAs seen above, the calculation for each subsequent term becomes significantly harder. Manually enumerating all the geometric constraints for `a(10)` is practically impossible. This is a famous, unsolved problem in combinatorics in the sense that there is no simple closed-form formula for `a(n)`.\n\nThe values have been computed using powerful computers and sophisticated algorithms. The sequence `a(n)` is well-documented in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. To find `a(10)`, we refer to this established sequence.\n\nThe sequence begins:\n*   `a(1) = 4`\n*   `a(2) = 12`\n*   `a(3) = 36`\n*   `a(4) = 100`\n*   `a(5) = 284`\n*   `a(6) = 780`\n*   `a(7) = 2172`\n*   `a(8) = 5916`\n*   `a(9) = 16268`\n*   `a(10) = 44100`\n\nThus, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
