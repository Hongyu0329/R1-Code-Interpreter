    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the interval [0, 1].\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Sidon Set in the Reals:** A set of real numbers $K$ is called a Sidon set (or sometimes a $B_2$ set) if for any four elements $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\in K$, the equation $x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4$ implies that the multisets $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ and $\\{x_3, x_4\\}$ are the same. This means that either ($x_1 = x_3$ and $x_2 = x_4$) or ($x_1 = x_4$ and $x_2 = x_3$). Essentially, any number has at most one representation as a sum of two elements from the set, up to the order of the summands.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(K)$, is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set $K$. It can be any non-negative real number. For a set $K \\subset [0, 1]$, its Hausdorff dimension is a value between 0 and 1. If $\\dim_H(K) = \\alpha$, the set is, in a sense, \"larger\" than any set with dimension less than $\\alpha$ and \"smaller\" than any set with dimension greater than $\\alpha$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $\\sup\\{\\dim_H(K) : K \\subset [0,1] \\text{ is a Sidon set}\\}$. We will show that this value is $1/2$ by proving two points:\n1.  The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ cannot exceed $1/2$.\n2.  There exist Sidon sets in $[0,1]$ with Hausdorff dimension equal to $1/2$.\n\n### Step 2: Proving the Upper Bound: $\\dim_H(K) \\le 1/2$\n\nThis is a classical result in harmonic analysis and fractal geometry, originally due to R. Salem. A full rigorous proof is quite technical, but we can outline the main idea using a heuristic argument.\n\n**Heuristic Argument:**\nLet $K$ be a set with Hausdorff dimension $\\alpha$. The \"size\" of $K$ at a scale $\\epsilon$ can be thought of as the number of intervals of length $\\epsilon$ needed to cover it, which is approximately $N_\\epsilon(K) \\approx (1/\\epsilon)^\\alpha$.\n\n1.  Consider the set of pairs $(x,y)$ with $x, y \\in K$. If we approximate $K$ by a discrete set of $(1/\\epsilon)^\\alpha$ points, there are about $((1/\\epsilon)^\\alpha)^2 = (1/\\epsilon)^{2\\alpha}$ such pairs.\n2.  Now consider the sumset $K+K = \\{x+y : x,y \\in K\\}$. These sums lie in the interval $[0, 2]$. Let's discretize this interval into bins of size $\\epsilon$. There are about $2/\\epsilon$ such bins.\n3.  We are mapping the set of pairs (of size $(1/\\epsilon)^{2\\alpha}$) into the set of sum-bins (of size $O(1/\\epsilon)$). The Sidon property means that the mapping $(x,y) \\mapsto x+y$ is almost one-to-one (at most two-to-one for $x \\ne y$).\n4.  If the mapping is close to injective, the number of input pairs cannot be much larger than the number of output bins. Thus, we must have:\n    $$(1/\\epsilon)^{2\\alpha} \\lesssim C \\cdot (1/\\epsilon)^1$$\n    for some constant $C$.\n5.  For this to hold as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, we must have the exponent on the left less than or equal to the exponent on the right:\n    $$2\\alpha \\le 1 \\implies \\alpha \\le 1/2$$\n\nThis intuitive argument suggests that if the Hausdorff dimension $\\alpha$ were greater than $1/2$, there would be \"too many\" pairs $(x,y)$ for their sums to be distinct, which would violate the Sidon property.\n\n**Formal Argument (Sketch):**\nA rigorous proof involves using Frostman's Lemma and Fourier analysis. If $\\dim_H(K) = \\alpha > 1/2$, Frostman's Lemma guarantees the existence of a probability measure $\\mu$ supported on $K$ such that its $s$-energy is finite for any $s < \\alpha$. The $s$-energy is $I_s(\\mu) = \\iint |x-y|^{-s} d\\mu(x)d\\mu(y)$. One can show that the Sidon property of the support set $K$ imposes strong constraints on the behavior of the Fourier transform $\\hat{\\mu}(t) = \\int e^{-ixt} d\\mu(x)$, specifically on the integrability of $|\\hat{\\mu}(t)|^4$. These constraints are violated if one assumes the dimension is greater than $1/2$.\n\n### Step 3: Proving the Lower Bound: Construction of a Sidon Set with $\\dim_H(K) = 1/2$\n\nTo show that the maximum dimension is at least $1/2$, we need to demonstrate that Sidon sets with dimensions arbitrarily close to (or equal to) $1/2$ can be constructed.\n\n**Construction Idea:**\nOne way to construct such sets is using a generalized Cantor set construction.\n\n1.  **Integer Sidon Sets:** First, we need dense Sidon sets of integers. A set of integers $D \\subset \\{1, 2, \\dots, M\\}$ is a Sidon set if all pairwise sums are unique. It is known from number theory that one can construct Sidon sets $D$ with size $|D| \\sim \\sqrt{M}$. The constructions by Singer, and by Bose and Chowla, provide such examples.\n\n2.  **Cantor Set Construction:** We can construct a Cantor set $C$ using these integer Sidon sets as digits. Let $M$ be a large integer, and let $D \\subset \\{0, 1, \\dots, M-1\\}$ be a Sidon set of integers with size $|D| \\approx \\sqrt{M}$. We choose a base for our Cantor set, say $N$, which must be large enough to prevent carries when adding numbers. Choosing $N > 2M$ is sufficient. The Cantor set $C_{N,D}$ is the set of all numbers in $[0,1]$ of the form:\n    $$x = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{d_j}{N^j}, \\quad \\text{where } d_j \\in D$$\n    The Hausdorff dimension of this set is given by $\\dim_H(C_{N,D}) = \\frac{\\log|D|}{\\log N}$.\n\n3.  **Achieving Dimension 1/2:** By taking $M$ to be very large, we have:\n    $$\\dim_H(C_{N,D}) = \\frac{\\log|D|}{\\log N} \\approx \\frac{\\log(\\sqrt{M})}{\\log(2M)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\log M}{\\log 2 + \\log M}$$\n    As $M \\to \\infty$, this ratio approaches $1/2$. This shows that we can construct Sidon sets (it can be shown that with some care in construction, these sets are indeed Sidon sets) whose dimension is arbitrarily close to $1/2$.\n\n4.  **Exact Construction:** More sophisticated constructions, like those by Jean-Pierre Kahane (1969) and Stephen Astels (1999), use rapidly growing bases (Moran sets) instead of a fixed base $N$. These methods allow for the construction of a Sidon set whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly $1/2$.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that any Sidon set $K \\subset [0,1]$ must satisfy $\\dim_H(K) \\le 1/2$. From Step 3, we know that for any $\\alpha \\in [0, 1/2]$, there exists a Sidon set $K_\\alpha \\subset [0,1]$ with $\\dim_H(K_\\alpha) = \\alpha$.\n\nTherefore, the set of all possible Hausdorff dimensions for Sidon sets in $[0,1]$ is the interval $[0, 1/2]$. The maximum value in this set is $1/2$.\n\nThe maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1/2.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
