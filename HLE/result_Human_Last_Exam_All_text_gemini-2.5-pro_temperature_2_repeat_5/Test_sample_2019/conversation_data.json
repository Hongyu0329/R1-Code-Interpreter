    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Attacks\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around. A move off the right edge brings you to the left edge of the same row, and a move off the bottom edge brings you to the top edge of the same column. We can represent the squares by coordinates (r, c) where r, c are integers from 0 to 4.\n*   **Queens' Attacks:** A queen at (r, c) attacks any square (r', c') if it's on the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, this translates to:\n    1.  **Row attack:** `r' = r`\n    2.  **Column attack:** `c' = c`\n    3.  **Diagonal attack:** `(r' - c') mod 5 = (r - c) mod 5`\n    4.  **Anti-diagonal attack:** `(r' + c') mod 5 = (r + c) mod 5`\n\nFor a placement of 4 queens at `(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)` to be non-attacking, the following four sets of values must each contain 4 distinct elements:\n*   The set of rows: `{r1, r2, r3, r4}`\n*   The set of columns: `{c1, c2, c3, c4}`\n*   The set of main diagonals (values of `r-c mod 5`): `{(r1-c1) mod 5, (r2-c2) mod 5, (r3-c3) mod 5, (r4-c4) mod 5}`\n*   The set of anti-diagonals (values of `r+c mod 5`): `{(r1+c1) mod 5, (r2+c2) mod 5, (r3+c3) mod 5, (r4+c4) mod 5}`\n\n### Step 2: A Combinatorial Counting Approach (using pairs)\n\nWe can solve this problem by a method of combinatorial double counting. Let `S` be the set of all valid 4-queen solutions, and `|S|` be the number we want to find. Let `P` be the set of all non-attacking pairs of queens on the board.\n\nThe core idea is to count the number of flags `(s, p)` where `s` is a solution in `S` and `p` is a pair of queens from `s`.\n\n1.  Counting from solutions: For any given solution `s` (which consists of 4 queens), the number of ways to choose a pair of queens from it is `C(4, 2) = 6`. So, the total number of such flags is `6 * |S|`.\n\n2.  Counting from pairs: For any given non-attacking pair of queens `p`, let `N(p)` be the number of ways to complete `p` into a full 4-queen solution. The total number of flags is the sum of `N(p)` over all possible non-attacking pairs `p` in `P`.\n\nEquating the two counts gives: `6 * |S| = Σ N(p)` for all `p` in `P`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Pairs\n\n*   **How many non-attacking pairs are there?**\n    *   Let's place the first queen, Q1. There are `5 * 5 = 25` positions.\n    *   Let's place Q1 at (0,0) without loss of generality. A second queen, Q2, at (r, c) cannot be in row 0 (`r≠0`), column 0 (`c≠0`), the main diagonal `r-c=0` (`r≠c`), or the anti-diagonal `r+c=0` (`r≠5-c`).\n    *   The squares attacked by a queen at (0,0) are:\n        *   Row 0: 4 squares (not including (0,0))\n        *   Column 0: 4 squares\n        *   Main diagonal `r=c`: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) (4 squares)\n        *   Anti-diagonal `r+c=5`: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) (4 squares)\n    *   The total number of squares attacked (including the queen's own square) is `1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17`.\n    *   So, the number of safe squares for Q2 is `25 - 17 = 8`.\n    *   The number of ordered non-attacking pairs is `25 * 8 = 200`.\n    *   Since the queens are identical, the number of unordered pairs is `|P| = 200 / 2 = 100`.\n\n*   **Symmetry of Pairs:** All 100 non-attacking pairs are equivalent under the symmetries of the toroidal board (translations, rotations, reflections). This means that `N(p)` is the same for every pair `p`. So, the sum simplifies to `Σ N(p) = |P| * N(p) = 100 * N(p)`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating N(p), the number of completions for a pair\n\nSince all pairs are equivalent, we can choose a specific pair `p` and calculate the number of ways to complete it. Let's choose the pair `p = {(0,0), (1,2)}`.\n\nWe need to find two more queens, Q3 and Q4, at `(r3, c3)` and `(r4, c4)` such that the four queens are non-attacking.\nThe occupied properties from `{(0,0), (1,2)}` are:\n*   Rows: `{0, 1}`\n*   Columns: `{0, 2}`\n*   Main diagonals (`r-c`): `{0-0=0, 1-2=-1=4}`\n*   Anti-diagonals (`r+c`): `{0+0=0, 1+2=3}`\n\nSo for Q3 and Q4, their coordinates `(r,c)` must satisfy:\n*   `r` is in `{2, 3, 4}`\n*   `c` is in `{1, 3, 4}`\n*   `r-c mod 5` is in `{1, 2, 3}`\n*   `r+c mod 5` is in `{1, 2, 4}`\n\nLet's test the `3*3 = 9` possible squares for Q3/Q4 from the available rows and columns:\n1.  `(2,1)`: `r+c=3` (forbidden).\n2.  `(2,3)`: `r-c = -1 = 4` (forbidden).\n3.  `(2,4)`: `r-c=3`, `r+c=1`. **Valid Candidate.**\n4.  `(3,1)`: `r-c=2`, `r+c=4`. **Valid Candidate.**\n5.  `(3,3)`: `r-c=0` (forbidden).\n6.  `(3,4)`: `r-c = -1 = 4` (forbidden).\n7.  `(4,1)`: `r+c=0` (forbidden).\n8.  `(4,3)`: `r-c=1`, `r+c=2`. **Valid Candidate.**\n9.  `(4,4)`: `r-c=0` (forbidden).\n\nThe available pool of squares for Q3 and Q4 is `Cand = {(2,4), (3,1), (4,3)}`. We must choose two non-attacking queens from this set of three. There are `C(3, 2) = 3` pairs to check:\n\n*   **Pair 1: `{(2,4), (3,1)}`**\n    *   Rows `{2,3}`, Cols `{4,1}` - OK.\n    *   Diagonals `r-c`: `2-4=3`, `3-1=2`. Distinct. OK.\n    *   Anti-diagonals `r+c`: `2+4=1`, `3+1=4`. Distinct. OK.\n    *   This pair is non-attacking. It forms a valid completion. **(1 way)**\n\n*   **Pair 2: `{(2,4), (4,3)}`**\n    *   Rows `{2,4}`, Cols `{4,3}` - OK.\n    *   Diagonals `r-c`: `2-4=3`, `4-3=1`. Distinct. OK.\n    *   Anti-diagonals `r+c`: `2+4=1`, `4+3=2`. Distinct. OK.\n    *   This pair is non-attacking. It forms a valid completion. **(2 ways)**\n\n*   **Pair 3: `{(3,1), (4,3)}`**\n    *   Rows `{3,4}`, Cols `{1,3}` - OK.\n    *   Diagonals `r-c`: `3-1=2`, `4-3=1`. Distinct. OK.\n    *   Anti-diagonals `r+c`: `3+1=4`, `4+3=2`. Distinct. OK.\n    *   This pair is non-attacking. It forms a valid completion. **(3 ways)**\n\nSo, there are 3 ways to complete the pair `p = {(0,0), (1,2)}` into a 4-queen solution. Thus, `N(p) = 3`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nUsing the formula from Step 2:\n`6 * |S| = 100 * N(p)`\n`6 * |S| = 100 * 3`\n`6 * |S| = 300`\n`|S| = 300 / 6`\n`|S| = 50`\n\nThere are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard."
