    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the computation of the dimension of the bounded cohomology group $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, where $T$ is Thompson's group and the coefficients $\\mathbb{R}$ form a trivial module.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Künneth Formula**\nFor the bounded cohomology of a direct product of two groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ with trivial real coefficients, there is a Künneth formula. For a degree $n$, the dimension is given by:\n$$ \\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\left( \\dim H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\dim H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\right) $$\nIn our case, $G_1 = G_2 = T$ and the degree is $n=4$. The formula becomes:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\left( \\dim H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\dim H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\right) $$\nExpanding this sum, we get:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T) = (\\dim H_b^0(T))(\\dim H_b^4(T)) + (\\dim H_b^1(T))(\\dim H_b^3(T)) + (\\dim H_b^2(T))(\\dim H_b^2(T)) + (\\dim H_b^3(T))(\\dim H_b^1(T)) + (\\dim H_b^4(T))(\\dim H_b^0(T)) $$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T**\nTo use the formula, we need the dimensions of $H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. These are known results from the literature on bounded cohomology.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Dimension in Degree 0**\n    For any group $G$, the degree 0 bounded cohomology with trivial coefficients, $H_b^0(G; \\mathbb{R})$, consists of the bounded $G$-invariant functions from $G$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. These are precisely the constant functions.\n    Therefore, $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Dimension in Degree 1**\n    The degree 1 bounded cohomology group, $H_b^1(G; \\mathbb{R})$, can be identified with the space of bounded homomorphisms from $G$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. Thompson's group $T$ is known to be a simple group. This means its commutator subgroup $[T,T]$ is $T$ itself, and its abelianization $T/[T,T]$ is the trivial group. Any homomorphism from $T$ to an abelian group (like $\\mathbb{R}$) must be the trivial homomorphism.\n    Therefore, $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Dimension in Degree 2**\n    The dimension of the second bounded cohomology group of $T$ is a non-trivial result. While for the related Thompson group $F$, $\\dim H_b^2(F; \\mathbb{R})$ is infinite, the situation for $T$ is different due to its canonical action on the circle $S^1$. A theorem by S. Matsumoto (2001) shows that for a large class of groups of circle homeomorphisms, including $T$, the second bounded cohomology group is one-dimensional, generated by the bounded Euler class.\n    Therefore, $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Dimension in Higher Degrees (n ≥ 3)**\n    The vanishing of higher-degree bounded cohomology for $T$ is a more recent and profound result in the field. Based on work by F. Fournier-Facio and N. Monod, it is known that the bounded cohomology of $T$ with trivial real coefficients vanishes for all degrees greater than or equal to 3.\n    Therefore, $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 3$. This means, in particular, that $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ and $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the Dimensions and Compute the Final Answer**\nLet's denote $d_k = \\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$. We have gathered:\n*   $d_0 = 1$\n*   $d_1 = 0$\n*   $d_2 = 1$\n*   $d_3 = 0$\n*   $d_4 = 0$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the expanded Künneth formula:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T) = (d_0 \\cdot d_4) + (d_1 \\cdot d_3) + (d_2 \\cdot d_2) + (d_3 \\cdot d_1) + (d_4 \\cdot d_0) $$\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T) = (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 1) $$\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T) = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 $$\n\nThe dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
