    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of Dirichlet characters\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is a homomorphism from the multiplicative group $(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ to $\\mathbb{C}^\\times$. The structure of characters modulo $N$ can be understood by factoring $N$.\n\nFirst, we factorize the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the group of characters modulo $N$ can be decomposed into a product of character groups for each prime power factor:\n$\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\cong \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\times \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\times \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\times \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\times \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$.\n\nThis means any character $\\chi \\pmod N$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where each $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a character modulo $p^k$.\n\n### Step 2: Conditions for Primitivity and Order\n\n1.  **Primitivity**: A character $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_{p^k}$ is primitive modulo $N = \\prod p^k$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ is primitive modulo $p^k$.\n2.  **Order**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its component characters. We need this order to be 6.\n    $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_9), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_7), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\nLet's find the number of available primitive characters for each prime power factor, whose orders are relevant to the LCM being 6. Let $d_{p^k} = \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{p^k})$. The condition $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\dots)=6$ implies that each $d_{p^k}$ must be a divisor of 6 (i.e., $d_{p^k} \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$). Since primitive characters have order greater than 1, we only need to consider orders 2, 3, and 6.\n\n### Step 3: Count Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power Factor\n\nLet $N(p^k, d)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p^k$ of order $d$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**:\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one principal character (order 1, conductor 1) and one non-principal character (order 2). The conductor of this non-principal character is 4, so it is primitive.\n    *   $N(4, 2) = 1$. No other orders are possible for primitive characters.\n    *   **Choice for $\\chi_4$**: Must be the unique primitive character of order 2. Number of choices = 1.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**:\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. Characters modulo 9 are primitive if they are not induced by characters modulo 3. The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(3)=2$, so characters mod 3 have orders 1 or 2.\n    *   The total number of characters mod 9 of order $d$ is $\\phi(d)$ if $d|6$.\n    *   $N(9,d) = (\\text{total chars mod 9 of order d}) - (\\text{chars mod 3 of order d})$.\n    *   $N(9,2) = \\phi(2) - \\phi(2) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n    *   $N(9,3) = \\phi(3) - 0 = 2$.\n    *   $N(9,6) = \\phi(6) - 0 = 2$.\n    *   **Choices for $\\chi_9$**: The order can be 3 or 6. Number of choices = $N(9,3) + N(9,6) = 2+2=4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**:\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. We need characters whose order divides 6.\n    *   $N(7,2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $N(7,3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $N(7,6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   **Choices for $\\chi_7$**: The order can be 2, 3, or 6. Number of choices = $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**:\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. We need primitive characters whose order $d$ divides 6. So $d$ must divide $\\gcd(10, 6) = 2$. Since $d>1$, the only possible order is 2.\n    *   $N(11,2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   **Choice for $\\chi_{11}$**: Must be the unique primitive character of order 2. Number of choices = 1.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**:\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. We need primitive characters whose order $d$ divides 6. So $d$ must divide $\\gcd(12, 6) = 6$. The possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\n    *   $N(13,2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $N(13,3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $N(13,6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   **Choices for $\\chi_{13}$**: The order can be 2, 3, or 6. Number of choices = $1+2+2=5$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results and Verify the LCM condition\n\nWe need to count the number of combinations of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that the LCM of their orders is 6.\nLet the tuple of orders be $(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13})$.\n\nFrom Step 3, we have the following possible orders for the primitive components:\n*   $d_4 = 2$\n*   $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_{11} = 2$\n*   $d_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nLet's check the LCM condition: $\\operatorname{lcm}(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13}) = 6$.\nThis requires three things:\n1.  Every order $d_i$ must divide 6. This is true for all possible orders listed above.\n2.  At least one order must be divisible by 2. This is guaranteed since $d_4=2$ (and $d_{11}=2$).\n3.  At least one order must be divisible by 3. This is guaranteed since $d_9$ is either 3 or 6, both of which are divisible by 3.\n\nSince any valid combination of component orders will be divisible by 2 and 3, their LCM is divisible by 6. As all orders divide 6, their LCM must also divide 6. Therefore, the LCM is exactly 6 for any possible combination of primitive characters.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nThe condition on the order being 6 is automatically satisfied. Thus, we just need to multiply the number of choices for each component character.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: 4\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: 5\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: 5\n\nTotal number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of these numbers:\nTotal = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
