    "This analysis will proceed in several steps. First, we will analyze the problem statement itself to understand the requirements. Second, we will analyze the provided Java code to determine if it correctly solves the problem. Finally, if the code is incorrect, we will design the most efficient C solution and calculate the requested performance metrics.\n\n### Step-by-Step Problem Analysis\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to calculate the final value of a variable `x`.\n2.  **Initial State:** The variable `x` starts with a value of 0.\n3.  **Input:**\n    *   An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 150), representing the number of statements in a program.\n    *   `n` lines follow, each containing one statement.\n4.  **Operations:** There are two operations:\n    *   `++`: Increases `x` by 1.\n    *   `--`: Decreases `x` by 1.\n5.  **Statements:** A statement is a 3-character string. It contains one variable `X` and one operation (`++` or `--`). The order can vary. This gives four possible statement strings:\n    *   `X++` (Increment)\n    *   `++X` (Increment)\n    *   `X--` (Decrement)\n    *   `--X` (Decrement)\n6.  **Program Execution:** The program consists of `n` statements. We must execute all of them in the given order.\n7.  **Output:** Print the final integer value of `x`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **All four statement forms must be handled:** A correct solution cannot ignore any of the four possible inputs (`X++`, `++X`, `X--`, `--X`).\n*   **The operation, not the position, matters:** The core task is to determine if a statement is an increment or a decrement. The presence of `+` implies an increment, and the presence of `-` implies a decrement.\n*   **Efficiency:** For the C implementation, we must consider both time efficiency (minimizing operations, especially comparisons, within the loop) and memory efficiency (minimizing variable storage).\n\n### Analysis of the Submitted Java Program\n\nThe provided Java code is:\n```java\n// ... imports and class definition\npublic static void main(String[] args)\n{\n    Scanner inpt = new Scanner(System.in);\n    int t = inpt.nextInt(); // Reads n\n    int tresult = 0;       // This is our variable x, initialized to 0\n    while (t-- > 0)\n    {\n        String test = inpt.next(); // Reads a statement, e.g., \"X++\"\n        \n        if (test.contains(\"++X\")) // Checks ONLY for \"++X\"\n        {\n            tresult++;\n        }\n        if (test.contains(\"--X\")) // Checks ONLY for \"--X\"\n        {\n            tresult--;\n        }  \n    }\n    System.out.println(tresult);\n    inpt.close();\n}    \n```\n\n1.  **Initialization:** The code correctly initializes the result variable (`tresult`) to 0 and reads the number of statements `n` (into `t`).\n2.  **Looping:** The `while (t-- > 0)` loop correctly iterates `n` times.\n3.  **Logic Flaw:** The core logic lies in the `if` conditions.\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"++X\"))`: This line checks if the input string contains the substring \"++X\". It correctly increments the counter if this is true.\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"--X\"))`: This line checks for the substring \"--X\" and correctly decrements the counter.\n    *   **The critical error is that the code fails to check for the other two valid statement formats: `\"X++\"` and `\"X--\"`**. If the input is `\"X++\"`, neither `if` condition will be met, and the value of `tresult` will not change, which is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided Java program is **incorrect** because it does not handle all possible valid input statements as described in the problem.\n\n### Most Efficient C Implementation and Performance Analysis\n\nSince the program is incorrect, we must design an efficient C solution and calculate `x` (character comparisons for 100 instructions) and `y` (memory in bytes).\n\n**1. Time Efficiency (Minimizing Comparisons)**\n\nTo distinguish between an increment and a decrement operation, we don't need to perform full string comparisons. We only need to find whether the statement contains a `+` or a `-`. Since every statement contains exactly one type of operator, we can check a single character. Let's look at the character positions (0-indexed):\n\n*   `++X`: char[0]=`+`, char[1]=`+`, char[2]=`X`\n*   `X++`: char[0]=`X`, char[1]=`+`, char[2]=`+`\n*   `--X`: char[0]=`-`, char[1]=`-`, char[2]=`X`\n*   `X--`: char[0]=`X`, char[1]=`-`, char[2]=`-`\n\nNotice that the character at **index 1** is *always* `+` for an increment and `-` for a decrement. Therefore, the most efficient check is `if (statement[1] == '+')`. This single character comparison is sufficient to determine the operation.\n\n*   **`x` (Smallest number of character comparisons for 100 instructions):**\n    With 100 instructions, and 1 comparison per instruction, the total number of comparisons is `100 * 1 = 100`.\n    **`x = 100`**\n\n**2. Memory Efficiency (Minimizing Memory)**\n\nA standard C implementation might use `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` into a character array. This would require an integer for `n`, an integer for the result `x`, and a `char` array of size 4 (for 3 characters plus the null terminator). This would be `4 + 4 + 4 = 12` bytes.\n\nHowever, to achieve the *absolute minimum* memory, we can process the input stream character by character using `getchar()`, avoiding the need for a character array buffer. The logic would be:\n1. Read `n`.\n2. In a loop that runs `n` times:\n   a. Read and discard the first character of the line.\n   b. Read the second character of the line and check if it's `+`.\n   c. Update `x` accordingly.\n   d. Read and discard all remaining characters on the line until the newline `\\n`.\n\nThis approach only requires storage for two variables:\n*   `int n;` (The number of statements): 4 bytes (on typical competitive programming platforms)\n*   `int x;` (The result): 4 bytes\n\n*   **`y` (Smallest memory size in B):**\n    The total memory required for variables is `4 bytes + 4 bytes = 8 bytes`.\n    **`y = 8`**\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe required format is `Nx+y`, as the original program is incorrect.\n\n*   `x` = 100\n*   `y` = 8\n*   `x + y` = `100 + 8 = 108`\n\nThe final answer string is `N108`.\n\n<<<N108>>>"
