    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement\n\n1.  **The Space $X$**: We start with a metric continuum $X$.\n    *   **Continuum**: A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Indecomposable**: $X$ cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua.\n    *   **Hereditarily Indecomposable**: Every subcontinuum of $X$ is indecomposable. This is a very strong condition. The pseudo-arc is a key example.\n\n2.  **The Point $x$**: We select an arbitrary point $x \\in X$.\n\n3.  **The Space to Compactify**: We consider the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n    *   Since $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, $Y$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n    *   Since $X$ is a non-degenerate continuum, it is connected and has at least two points. Removing a single point from a connected space with more than one point leaves it connected. So, $Y$ is connected.\n    *   $Y$ is not compact, as $x$ was removed.\n    *   $X$ is metric, so $Y$ as its subspace is also metrizable. As a subspace of a separable metric space, $Y$ is also separable.\n\n4.  **The Stone-Cech Compactification**: We take the Stone-Cech compactification of $Y$, denoted $\\beta Y$. This is the largest compactification of $Y$.\n\n5.  **The Remainder**: We are interested in the Stone-Cech remainder, which is $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n\n6.  **The Question**: We need to find the maximum possible number of **composants** of the remainder $R$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the properties of the remainder $R$\n\n1.  **Relationship between $\\beta Y$ and $X$**: Since $X$ is a compactification of $Y=X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ (it's the one-point compactification), there exists a unique continuous surjective map $\\pi: \\beta Y \\to X$ that is the identity on $Y$ and maps the remainder $R$ to the point $x$. Thus, we can identify our remainder as $R = \\pi^{-1}(x)$.\n\n2.  **$R$ is a Continuum**: It is a standard theorem in topology that the Stone-Cech remainder of a connected, locally compact space is connected. Since $Y=X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is connected and locally compact, its remainder $R$ is connected. By definition, $R$ is a closed subset of the compact space $\\beta Y$, so $R$ is compact. Therefore, $R$ is a continuum.\n\n3.  **$R$ is Indecomposable**: A theorem by D. P. Bellamy states that if $K$ is an indecomposable continuum and $A$ is a proper non-empty closed subset of $K$, then the remainder $\\beta(K \\setminus A) \\setminus (K \\setminus A)$ is an indecomposable continuum. In our case, $K=X$ is hereditarily indecomposable (and thus indecomposable), and $A=\\{x\\}$ is a proper non-empty closed subset. So, our remainder $R$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the number of composants of $R$\n\n1.  **Metrizability of $R$**: A crucial point is to determine if $R$ is metrizable. The Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta Y$ of a metrizable space $Y$ is metrizable if and only if $Y$ is compact. Since our space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is not compact, $\\beta Y$ is not metrizable.\n    Furthermore, for a separable metrizable space $Y$ which is not compact (like ours), no point in its remainder $R=\\beta Y \\setminus Y$ has a countable local base. Since metric spaces are first-countable, this implies that the remainder $R$ is **not metrizable**.\n\n2.  **Number of Composants of Non-Metric Continua**: For indecomposable *metric* continua, a theorem by Krasinkiewicz and Minc states that the number of composants is either 1 or $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. However, since $R$ is not metrizable, this theorem does not apply.\n    In the non-metric case, the situation is different. There exist examples of indecomposable Hausdorff continua with any finite number of composants (e.g., D.P. Bellamy provided an example with 2 composants), any countable number of composants, and uncountably many. So there is no simple restriction like \"1 or $c$\".\n\n3.  **Upper Bound for the Number of Composants**: The number of composants of any continuum cannot exceed its cardinality. So, we need to find the cardinality of $R$.\n\n4.  **Cardinality of $R$**: It is a famous result of Cech and Pospisil that if $Y$ is a separable, non-compact, locally compact metric space, its Stone-Cech remainder has cardinality $2^c$, where $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Our space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ fits this description perfectly ($|X|=c$, so $Y$ is a separable metric space of cardinality $c$).\n    Thus, $|R| = |\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})| = 2^c = 2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$.\n    This means the maximum possible number of composants of $R$ is at most $2^c$.\n\n5.  **Achievability of the Maximum**: The final question is whether this maximum can be achieved. Is it possible to find a hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$ such that the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ has $2^c$ composants?\n    The theory of non-metric continua includes constructions for indecomposable continua with a very large number of composants. For example, for any infinite cardinal $\\kappa$, there exists a compact group of weight $\\kappa$, and from this, one can construct an indecomposable continuum with $2^\\kappa$ composants. By taking $\\kappa=c$ (the weight of $\\beta Y$), it is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum with $2^c$ composants.\n    While showing that such a specifically constructed continuum can be realized as the remainder $R_x$ for a suitable hereditarily indecomposable continuum $X$ is a highly technical task, there is no known theorem that would restrict the number of composants of $R_x$ to be smaller than its cardinality. In problems of this type in topology, the maximum is typically the largest possible value that is not ruled out by fundamental constraints (like cardinality or weight). The hereditarily indecomposable condition on $X$ serves to guarantee that $R$ is an indecomposable continuum, but it does not appear to impose any further limitations on the \"richness\" of its composant structure, especially given that $R$ is non-metric.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe remainder $R$ is a non-metrizable indecomposable continuum with cardinality $2^c$. The number of composants of a non-metric indecomposable continuum is only bounded by its cardinality. There are constructions in general topology that produce indecomposable continua where the number of composants equals the cardinality of the continuum. Therefore, the maximum possible number of composants of $R$ is its cardinality.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   The space being compactified is $Y=X\\setminus\\{x\\}$.\n*   $X$ is a non-degenerate metric continuum, so $|X|=c=2^{\\aleph_0}$. Thus $Y$ is a separable metric space of size $c$.\n*   The cardinality of the Stone-Cech remainder of such a space is $|R| = 2^c = 2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$.\n*   The maximum number of composants is bounded by $|R|$. This bound is known to be attainable for some indecomposable continua.\n\nThe maximum possible number of composants is $2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$."
