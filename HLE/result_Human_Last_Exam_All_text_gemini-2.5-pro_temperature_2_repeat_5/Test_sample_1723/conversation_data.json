    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the genus of mushroom known for a blue spore print.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a *single genus* of mushroom that is *known* to produce a *distinctly blue spore print*.\n\n2.  **Understand Spore Prints:** A spore print is a critical tool for mushroom identification. It is the color of the spores left behind when a mushroom cap is placed on a surface (like paper) and allowed to release its microscopic spores. Common colors include white, cream, pink, yellow, various shades of brown, and black/purple-black.\n\n3.  **Research Blue Spore Prints:** Blue is an extremely rare color for a spore print. In fact, the consensus among professional mycologists and authoritative sources is that no known mushroom genus produces a truly, distinctly blue spore print. This suggests the question might be a \"trick question\" or based on a common misconception.\n\n4.  **Investigate Potential Candidates:** We must look at genera that are famous for their blue coloration, as this is the most likely source of the misconception.\n    *   **The Genus *Lactarius* (or *Lactifluus*):** This genus is the most probable answer. It contains the species *Lactarius indigo* (now scientifically named *Lactifluus indigo*). This mushroom is famous for its striking all-blue appearanceâ€”blue cap, blue gills, and a blue \"milk\" or latex that it exudes when cut.\n    *   **The Genus *Entoloma*:** This genus contains *Entoloma hochstetteri*, the New Zealand blue mushroom, which is also a brilliant blue color.\n    *   **Blue-Staining Genera:** Many other mushrooms, such as those in *Gyroporus* or certain species of boletes, will stain blue instantly when bruised or cut, but they are not blue themselves.\n\n5.  **Check the Actual Spore Print Colors:** Now we verify the spore print color of these candidates.\n    *   ***Lactarius indigo***: Despite its intense blue color, its spore print is **cream to pale yellowish**.\n    *   ***Entoloma hochstetteri***: Despite being vibrant blue, its spore print is **pink**.\n    *   **Blue-staining mushrooms:** These typically have yellow, olive, or brown spore prints.\n\n6.  **Conclusion based on evidence:** There is no scientifically verified mushroom with a blue spore print. However, the question asks what genus is *known* for this trait. Because *Lactarius indigo* is the most famous blue mushroom, it is widely, though **incorrectly**, assumed to have a blue spore print. This misconception is common enough that *Lactarius* has become \"known\" for this characteristic in popular knowledge, even if it is factually wrong.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Mushroom Color vs. Spore Color:** It is crucial not to confuse the color of the mushroom's body (the fruiting body) with the color of its microscopic spores.\n*   **Scientific Fact vs. Common Knowledge:** The question's premise conflicts with established mycology. The answer relies on identifying the subject of a common misconception, not a scientific fact.\n*   **Genus Name:** The specific species, the Indigo Milk Cap, was moved from the genus *Lactarius* to *Lactifluus*. However, *Lactarius* is the name that is still more widely recognized and historically associated with this mushroom.\n\nBased on the analysis that the question refers to a widespread misconception rather than a scientific reality, the answer is the genus containing the Indigo Milk Cap.\n\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
