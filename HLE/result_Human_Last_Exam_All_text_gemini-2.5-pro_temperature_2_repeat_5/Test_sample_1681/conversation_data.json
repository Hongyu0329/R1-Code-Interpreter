    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Game:** The problem describes a Prisoner's Dilemma game. Let's analyze the given payoff matrix:\n    ```\n    [[(5,5) , (0,7)],\n     [(7,0) , (1,1)]]\n    ```\n    We can identify the standard payoffs:\n    *   **R (Reward):** 5, for mutual cooperation (C, C).\n    *   **S (Sucker):** 0, for cooperating while the opponent defects (C, D).\n    *   **T (Temptation):** 7, for defecting while the opponent cooperates (D, C).\n    *   **P (Punishment):** 1, for mutual defection (D, D).\n\n    The condition for a Prisoner's Dilemma is `T > R > P > S`, which is `7 > 5 > 1 > 0`. This condition holds. In classical game theory, the only Nash Equilibrium for this game is (Defect, Defect), leading to a payoff of (1, 1). This is Pareto-inefficient because both players would prefer the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome of (5, 5).\n\n2.  **Introducing the Quantum Realm:** The game is played in \"quantum space\". This typically refers to the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol for quantum games. Here's what that implies:\n    *   **Quantum States:** The game state is represented by a qubit for each player. The initial state is not simply (C, C), but an entangled quantum state.\n    *   **Quantum Strategies:** Players' strategies are not just C or D, but any valid quantum operation (a unitary transformation) they can apply to their qubit.\n    *   **Initial State Design:** The problem states, \"You design the initial states for an optimal\" game. To \"solve\" the Prisoner's Dilemma, we must entangle the players' qubits. An \"optimal\" setup uses maximal entanglement to eliminate the classical dilemma. This is achieved by an entangling operator, `J`, applied to the base state `|00>` (representing `CC`).\n    *   **Game Flow:**\n        a. The game starts in a maximally entangled state `|ψ_initial> = J|00>`.\n        b. Player A applies their strategy `U_A` and Player B applies `U_B`.\n        c. The entangled state is then disentangled using `J†` (the conjugate transpose of `J`).\n        d. The final state is measured, projecting it onto one of the four classical outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD). The expected payoff for each player is the sum of the payoffs for each outcome, weighted by their probabilities.\n\n3.  **Identifying Key Strategies and Equilibria:**\n    *   **Classical Strategies in Quantum Form:**\n        *   Cooperate (C) is the identity operator: `C = I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.\n        *   Defect (D) is a flip operator, represented by `D = iσ_x = [[0, i], [i, 0]]`.\n    *   **Quantum Strategy (Q):** A key insight of quantum game theory is the existence of new strategies that are not possible in the classical game. A crucial one is `Q = iσ_z = [[i, 0], [0, -i]]`.\n    *   **Nash Equilibrium Analysis:** We need to find a strategy profile (a pair of strategies, one for each player) where neither player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy. We analyze this by comparing the payoffs. Let's denote the payoff vector for strategies `(S_A, S_B)` as `Payoff(S_A, S_B)`.\n\n4.  **Calculating Payoffs in the Maximally Entangled Game:**\n    With maximal entanglement, the payoffs for key strategy pairs can be calculated. The results are:\n    *   `Payoff(C, C)` = (5, 5). (The final state is `|CC>`).\n    *   `Payoff(D, D)` = (1, 1). (The final state is `|DD>`).\n    *   `Payoff(Q, Q)` = (5, 5). (The final state is `|CC>`).\n    *   `Payoff(C, D)` and `Payoff(D, C)` = (3.5, 3.5). (The final state is a 50/50 superposition of `|CD>` and `|DC>`).\n    *   `Payoff(C, Q)` and `Payoff(Q, C)` = (1, 1). (The final state is `|DD>`).\n    *   `Payoff(D, Q)` and `Payoff(Q, D)` = (3.5, 3.5). (The final state is a 50/50 superposition of `|CD>` and `|DC>`).\n\n5.  **Finding the Equilibrium Point:** Now we check for Nash Equilibria.\n\n    *   **Is the classical equilibrium (D, D) still an equilibrium?**\n        The payoff is (1, 1). If Player A unilaterally switches to Cooperate (C), the profile becomes (C, D) and her payoff becomes 3.5. Since `3.5 > 1`, she has an incentive to switch. Therefore, **(D, D) is no longer a Nash Equilibrium.**\n\n    *   **Is the cooperative outcome (C, C) an equilibrium?**\n        The payoff is (5, 5). If Player A unilaterally switches to Defect (D), the profile becomes (D, C) and her payoff becomes 3.5. If she switches to Quantum (Q), the profile is (Q, C) and her payoff is 1. Since `5 > 3.5` and `5 > 1`, she has no incentive to switch. By symmetry, Player B also has no incentive to switch. Therefore, **(C, C) is a Nash Equilibrium.**\n\n    *   **Is the quantum outcome (Q, Q) an equilibrium?**\n        The payoff is (5, 5). If Player A unilaterally switches to Defect (D), the profile becomes (D, Q) and her payoff is 3.5. If she switches to Cooperate (C), the profile becomes (C, Q) and her payoff is 1. Since `5 > 3.5` and `5 > 1`, she has no incentive to switch. By symmetry, Player B also has no incentive to switch. Therefore, **(Q, Q) is also a Nash Equilibrium.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhen the Prisoner's Dilemma is played in a quantum setting with an optimal (maximally entangled) initial state, the classical Nash Equilibrium of (Defect, Defect) is eliminated. New, stable equilibria emerge, such as (Cooperate, Cooperate) and (Quantum, Quantum). Both of these equilibria lead to the same Pareto-optimal outcome where both players receive the reward for mutual cooperation.\n\nThe \"equilibrium point\" refers to this stable outcome. The payoff vector at this point resolves the dilemma.\n\nThe equilibrium point is the payoff vector where both players cooperate.\n\n<<<**(5, 5)**>>>"
