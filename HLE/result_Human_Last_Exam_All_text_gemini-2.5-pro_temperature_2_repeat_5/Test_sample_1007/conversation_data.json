    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The core task is to identify the ballet step from the list where the feet are in the same configuration at the end of the movement as they were at the beginning. For instance, if a step starts in fifth position with the right foot in front, it must also end in fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Answer Choice A: Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Action:** This is a vertical jump. \"Entrechat\" refers to the interweaving or beating of the legs in the air. The number \"six\" refers to six movements (three changes of the feet). For any even-numbered entrechat (deux, quatre, six), the feet land in a changed position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, but the feet have switched places. The foot that started in front will now be in the back.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Answer Choice B: Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Starts in a closed position, typically fifth (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Action:** The name itself provides the clue. *Échappé* means to escape, referring to the jump from a closed position to an open one (second position). *Battu* means the legs are beaten together. *Changé* explicitly means \"changed.\" After jumping to second position, the dancer jumps a second time to close the feet back into fifth position, with the foot that was originally in front now in the back.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, but with the feet changed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Answer Choice C: Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Can start from one or two feet. From two feet, it typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Action:** *Assemblé* means to assemble. The dancer brushes one leg out, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (\"assembles\") both legs together in the air before landing on both feet at the same time in fifth position. This step has many variations. *Assemblé dessus* (over) and *assemblé dessous* (under) both change the position of the feet. However, it is possible to perform an *assemblé* that does not change the feet (e.g., *assemblé en avant* or a simple *assemblé côté* that returns to the original position).\n    *   **Conclusion:** While some variations end in the same position, many common variations do not. The term \"Assemblé\" by itself is ambiguous in this context.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Answer Choice D: Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Starts in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Action:** *Glissade* means to glide, and *derrière* means behind. To execute this step, the dancer glides the back foot out to the side, transfers weight onto it, and then slides the other foot (which was originally in front) to close in fifth position *behind* the new supporting foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, but the foot that was in front is now in the back.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Answer Choice E: Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically starts in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Action:** A *gargouillade* is essentially a decorated *pas de chat*. A standard *pas de chat* (step of the cat) starts in fifth position, lifts the back leg, jumps, lifts the front leg, and lands in the exact same fifth position it started from. The *gargouillade* adds a quick circular motion (*rond de jambe en l'air*) with each leg as it's lifted. Despite this decoration, the fundamental structure of landing in the original position remains.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in the same fifth position from which they started (e.g., right foot remains in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending leg positions are the same.\n\n**Final Determination:**\n\nComparing all the options, A, B, and D all change the feet by their standard definition. C is ambiguous, as it can either change or not. E, Gargouillade, is a step that, by its fundamental nature and structure, does not change the position of the feet from start to finish. Therefore, it is the most definitively correct answer.\n\n<<<E>>>"
