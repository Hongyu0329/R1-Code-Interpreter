    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Interpreting the Question: \"Sum of Three Cycles\"**\n\nThe term \"sum of graphs\" can have different meanings. We will analyze the most likely interpretation based on standard graph theory terminology.\n\n*   **Interpretation 1: Graph Join (also known as Complete Product or Sum)**\n    Let \\(C_{n,1}\\), \\(C_{n,2}\\), and \\(C_{n,3}\\) be three vertex-disjoint cycles of length \\(n\\). The **join** of these graphs, denoted \\(G = C_{n,1} + C_{n,2} + C_{n,3}\\), is formed by taking the disjoint union of their vertices and adding an edge between every vertex of \\(C_{n,i}\\) and every vertex of \\(C_{n,j}\\) for \\(i \\ne j\\). This is the most common and standard definition for the \"sum\" of graphs in many textbooks.\n\n*   **Interpretation 2: Union of Edges on a Common Vertex Set**\n    This would mean there is a common set of \\(n\\) vertices, and we draw three different Hamiltonian cycles (\\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\)) on this vertex set. The resulting graph \\(G\\) would have these \\(n\\) vertices and the union of the edges from the three cycles.\n\nGiven the standard terminology, **Interpretation 1 (Graph Join) is the most probable meaning**. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n**2. Chromatic Number of a Graph Join**\n\nA key property of the graph join is its effect on the chromatic number. For any two graphs \\(H_1\\) and \\(H_2\\), the chromatic number of their join is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers:\n\\[ \\chi(H_1 + H_2) = \\chi(H_1) + \\chi(H_2) \\]\nThis property extends to the join of multiple graphs. For our problem, \\(G\\) is the join of three cycles:\n\\[ \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_{n,1}) + \\chi(C_{n,2}) + \\chi(C_{n,3}) \\]\nSince all three cycles have the same length \\(n\\), this simplifies to:\n\\[ \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\]\n\n**3. Finding the Maximal Chromatic Number**\n\nThe question asks for the *maximal* chromatic number of \\(G\\). This means we can choose the value of \\(n\\) to maximize \\(\\chi(G)\\). Based on the formula above, we need to choose \\(n\\) such that the chromatic number of a single cycle, \\(\\chi(C_n)\\), is maximized.\n\nLet's analyze \\(\\chi(C_n)\\):\n*   A graph must have at least one edge to have a chromatic number of 2 or more. A cycle must have at least 3 vertices, so we assume \\(n \\ge 3\\).\n*   If \\(n\\) is **even** (\\(n \\ge 4\\)), a cycle \\(C_n\\) is bipartite and can be colored with 2 colors. So, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 2\\).\n*   If \\(n\\) is **odd** (\\(n \\ge 3\\)), a cycle \\(C_n\\) is not bipartite and requires 3 colors. For example, in \\(C_3=(v_1, v_2, v_3)\\), \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\) need different colors, and \\(v_3\\), being adjacent to both, needs a third color. So, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 3\\).\n\nTo maximize \\(3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n)\\), we must choose an \\(n\\) that gives the largest value for \\(\\chi(C_n)\\).\n*   Maximal value of \\(\\chi(C_n)\\) is 3.\n*   This maximum is achieved when \\(n\\) is any **odd integer** such that \\(n \\ge 3\\).\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nWe select any odd \\(n \\ge 3\\) (e.g., \\(n=3\\), \\(n=5\\), etc.). For this choice of \\(n\\):\n\\[ \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\]\nNow, we calculate the maximal chromatic number for \\(G\\):\n\\[ \\chi(G)_{\\max} = 3 \\cdot \\max_{n} \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\]\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ambiguity of \"Sum\":** The primary point of care is the interpretation of \"sum\". As justified above, \"join\" is the standard definition. If the \"union\" interpretation were used, the maximal chromatic number would be 7, achieved for \\(n=7\\) by arranging three Hamiltonian cycles to form the complete graph \\(K_7\\). However, the \"join\" interpretation is more faithful to standard definitions.\n2.  **Dependence on \\(n\\):** The maximal value is not dependent on a specific value of \\(n\\), but rather on the parity of \\(n\\). Any odd length for the cycles results in the same maximal chromatic number for \\(G\\).\n3.  **Base Cases:** The concept of a cycle requires \\(n \\ge 3\\). For \\(n=1\\) or \\(n=2\\), cycles are not well-defined or are degenerate (e.g., multiedges), but this does not affect the maximum value since we can choose \\(n=3\\).\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBy interpreting the \"sum of graphs\" as the standard graph join operation, the problem reduces to finding the maximum chromatic number of a cycle \\(C_n\\) and multiplying it by three. The maximum chromatic number for a cycle is 3 (for any odd \\(n\\)). Therefore, the maximal chromatic number for the sum of three such cycles is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n<<<9>>>"
