    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**The Sequence:**\n2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation:** The numbers in the sequence are increasing. Let's try to find a simple mathematical relationship between consecutive terms. Common patterns involve addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or a combination of these.\n\n2.  **Test for Simple Differences:**\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The sequence of differences is {9, 12, 28, 68}. There is no obvious arithmetic or geometric pattern here, so a simple difference-based rule is unlikely.\n\n3.  **Test for a Multiplication and Addition/Subtraction Pattern:**\n    This is a very common type of pattern. Let's assume the rule is `Next Term = (Previous Term * a) + b`. Let's test `a=2`, as the numbers are roughly doubling.\n    *   From 2 to 11: `2 * 2 + 7 = 11`\n    *   From 11 to 23: `11 * 2 + 1 = 23`\n    *   From 23 to 51: `23 * 2 + 5 = 46 + 5 = 51`\n    *   From 51 to 119: `51 * 2 + 17 = 102 + 17 = 119`\n\n4.  **Identify the Pattern in the Addends:**\n    The base rule appears to be `Next Term = (Previous Term * 2) + b`, where `b` is a changing number. Let's list the values of `b` (the addends) we found:\n    {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}\n    This sequence of addends seems irregular. This is a careful point: often in such problems, the first term may be an exception or just a starting seed, and the true pattern begins from the second term.\n\n5.  **Re-analyze the Pattern, Excluding the First Step:**\n    Let's ignore the first calculation (`2 * 2 + 7`) and see if there's a pattern in the addends for the rest of the sequence.\n    *   The sequence of addends, starting from the second step, is: {1, 5, 17, ...}.\n    *   Let's find the pattern within this new sequence {1, 5, 17}. We can look at the differences between its terms.\n    *   Difference 1: `5 - 1 = 4`\n    *   Difference 2: `17 - 5 = 12`\n\n6.  **Find the Pattern in the Second-Level Differences:**\n    *   We now have a sequence of differences: {4, 12, ...}.\n    *   A clear pattern emerges here: each term is 3 times the previous term (`4 * 3 = 12`). This is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.\n\n7.  **Predict the Next Terms:**\n    *   Following this pattern, the next difference in the {4, 12, ...} sequence will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n    *   This predicted difference (36) is then added to the last known addend (17) to find the next addend. So, the next addend is `17 + 36 = 53`.\n    *   This addend (53) is what we need to calculate the final term in the original sequence.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The rule for the final term is: `(Last Term * 2) + Next Addend`.\n    *   Calculation: `(119 * 2) + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n\n**Summary of the careful points:**\n*   First, try common patterns like simple differences or `ax+b`.\n*   Recognize that the pattern may not apply to the very first term, which can be just a starting point.\n*   If a pattern leads to a secondary sequence (like our addends {1, 5, 17}), analyze this secondary sequence for its own pattern.\n*   This may require finding differences of the secondary sequence (a third-level pattern), as we did to get {4, 12}.\n*   Once the complete pattern is identified, work forward to calculate the missing term.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe missing number in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
