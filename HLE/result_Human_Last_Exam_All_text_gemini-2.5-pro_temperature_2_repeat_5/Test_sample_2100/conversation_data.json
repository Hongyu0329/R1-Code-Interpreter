    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Quote and its Author**\nThe question begins with a quote attributed to Andrei Voznesensky, a famous Soviet and Russian poet. The quote describes a man as \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and laments his unknown burial place: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This points to a historical figure who was both an explorer/seafarer and whose final resting place was lost to history for a significant period. The fact that the poet is Russian suggests the subject is likely a figure of importance in Russian history.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Source of the Quote**\nThe lines are from Voznesensky's most famous work, the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" («Юнона и Авось»). This rock opera tells the story of a real historical expedition and a tragic romance.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\"**\nThe central figure of the rock opera is Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n*   **\"Sailor\":** This fits Rezanov perfectly. He was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer who commanded one of Russia's first round-the-world naval expeditions and was a key figure in the Russian-American Company, visiting Alaska, Japan, and Spanish California.\n*   **\"Joy-discovering\":** This is a poetic reference to his famous and tragic love affair with Concepción Argüello, the 15-year-old daughter of the Spanish commandant of San Francisco. He found this unexpected \"joy\" but had to leave, promising to return after getting the Tsar's permission to marry her.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Clue about the Lost Grave**\nThe line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" reflects a historical fact. Rezanov fell ill and died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807, during his arduous journey back to St. Petersburg. He was buried at the Voskresensky Cathedral. In the 1930s, under Soviet rule, the cathedral was destroyed, and the cemetery was paved over, completely obliterating any trace of his grave. Its location was unknown for decades.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Final Clue about the Discovery**\nThe question states, \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" Following the immense success of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" in the early 1980s, public interest in the real Rezanov surged. During the period of *Glasnost* in the late 1980s, this interest fueled research and an effort in Krasnoyarsk to find the lost burial site. While the grave itself was not found intact, the location of the former cemetery was identified, and the \"answer\" to where he was buried finally came to light. A monument was established on the site, with the first memorial cross being placed in 1989.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll the clues point to one man: the protagonist of Voznesensky's work, the explorer Nikolai Rezanov, whose lost grave became a subject of public interest and rediscovery in the late 1980s. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
