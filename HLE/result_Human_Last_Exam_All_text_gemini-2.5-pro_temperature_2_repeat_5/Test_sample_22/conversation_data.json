    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **SNP heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical quantity. It represents the proportion of the variation in a phenotype that can be explained by the additive effects of all common genetic variants (SNPs) considered together. It's the *theoretical maximum* predictive power that could ever be achieved using a perfect linear model of these SNPs. It's often estimated using methods like GCTA-GREML, but the concept itself is an upper bound on what is genetically predictable by these specific SNPs.\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical tool, not a theoretical limit. A PGS is a single score calculated for an individual that summarizes their genetic predisposition for a phenotype. It's built by taking a weighted sum of their genotypes. The weights (effect sizes) for each SNP are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS (R²_PGS):** This is a measure of the performance of a specific PGS. It is calculated by seeing how much of the variance in a phenotype the PGS can explain in a *new, independent sample* that was not used to create the score. This is typically measured as the R-squared (R²) value.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Relationship between h²_SNP and R²_PGS**\n\nThe core of the question lies in understanding that h²_SNP is the **target** and R²_PGS is the **result of trying to hit that target**.\n\n1.  **h²_SNP is the Ceiling:** The SNP heritability represents the \"perfect-world\" scenario. If you had an infinitely large GWAS so that you could estimate the true effect size of every single SNP with perfect accuracy, and you used those true effects to build a PGS, then its predictive ability (R²_PGS) would equal the SNP heritability (h²_SNP).\n2.  **PGS is an Imperfect Estimate:** In the real world, we cannot achieve this perfect scenario. The construction of any PGS is subject to several limitations:\n    *   **Estimation Error:** GWASs are conducted on finite samples. This means the SNP effect sizes used as weights in the PGS are just *estimates*, and they have statistical error. This \"noise\" in the weights will always reduce the predictive accuracy of the final score compared to a score built with the true, unknown weights.\n    *   **Incomplete Information:** GWASs have limited statistical power. They may fail to identify many true causal SNPs with very small effects, or the estimates for these small effects will be very noisy.\n    *   **Modeling Imperfections:** The relationship between SNPs (Linkage Disequilibrium, LD) is complex. Methods used to account for LD when building a PGS (e.g., clumping and thresholding, or more advanced statistical methods like LDpred) are approximations and are not perfect.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Word \"Necessarily\"**\n\nThe word \"necessarily\" implies that the predictive ability of a PGS can never be equal to or greater than the SNP heritability.\n\n*   Given the limitations described in Step 2, any practical PGS is built with imperfect information. A model built with imperfect information cannot outperform a theoretical perfect model. Therefore, the true predictive power of the PGS *must* be lower than the true SNP heritability.\n*   It is possible in a specific, finite test sample that due to random sampling fluctuation, the *measured* R²_PGS might be slightly higher than a particular *estimate* of h²_SNP (which also has its own estimation error). However, the question is about the fundamental relationship between the two quantities. The *expected* or *true* predictive ability of the PGS is fundamentally bounded by the SNP heritability.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSNP heritability defines the theoretical upper limit of predictability using a set of SNPs. A polygenic score is a practical attempt to reach that limit using estimated data. Due to inevitable errors and imperfections in the estimation process (e.g., from finite GWAS sample sizes), the performance of a real PGS will always fall short of this theoretical maximum. Therefore, the variance explained by a PGS is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n<<<True>>>"
