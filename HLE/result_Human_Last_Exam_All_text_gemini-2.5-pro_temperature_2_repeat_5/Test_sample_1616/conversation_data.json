    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (or TSL) is a historical sound change in English. The rule states that a long (tense) vowel becomes short (lax) when it is in the third-to-last syllable of a word (the antepenultimate syllable). For this rule to apply, a word must have at least three syllables.\n\nLet's look at some examples:\n*   *s**ā**ne* (/eɪ/) → *s**ă**nity* (/æ/)\n*   *div**ī**ne* (/aɪ/) → *div**ĭ**nity* (/ɪ/)\n*   *ser**ē**ne* (/iː/) → *ser**ĕ**nity* (/ɛ/)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Word from the List**\n\nWe will check each word to see if it fits the pattern of TSL. This involves looking at its root or base word, its syllable count, and the vowel sound in the relevant syllable.\n\n*   **derivative**\n    *   **Root word:** *derive* (pronounced /dɪˈraɪv/, with a long diphthong /aɪ/).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word *derivative* (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/) has four syllables: de-riv-a-tive. The vowel from the root *derive* is now in the third-to-last (antepenultimate) syllable. The long vowel /aɪ/ has shortened to the lax vowel /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    *   **Root word:** *serene* (pronounced /səˈriːn/, with a long vowel /iː/).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word *serenity* (/səˈrɛnəti/) has four syllables: se-ren-i-ty. The vowel from the root *serene* is in the antepenultimate syllable. The long vowel /iː/ has shortened to the lax vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    *   **Root concept:** Related to Latin *grātus* and English *grateful*. The base has a long 'a' sound (/eɪ/).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word *gratitude* (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/) has three syllables: grat-i-tude. The vowel in the first syllable (the antepenultimate) has been shortened from a tense /eɪ/ to a lax /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **southern**\n    *   **Root word:** *south* (pronounced /saʊθ/, with a long diphthong /aʊ/).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word *southern* (/ˈsʌðərn/) has only two syllables: south-ern. While the vowel has shortened from /aʊ/ to /ʌ/, this process cannot be trisyllabic laxing because the word is not three syllables long. This is a different type of vowel shortening.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word has **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    *   **Root word:** *please* (pronounced /pliːz/, with a long vowel /iː/).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word *pleasant* (/ˈplɛzənt/) has only two syllables: pleas-ant. The vowel has shortened from /iː/ to /ɛ/, but like *southern*, this is not TSL because the word is disyllabic.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word has **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**\n    *   **Root word:** Old English *sceadu* (pronounced with a short /æ/ vowel in the first syllable).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word *shadow* (/ˈʃædoʊ/) has two syllables: shad-ow.\n        1.  It is only a two-syllable word, so TSL cannot apply.\n        2.  More importantly, the vowel in its first syllable, /æ/, was historically already short. It did not result from the shortening of a long vowel.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word has **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 3: Choose the Best Answer**\n\nWe have identified three words that have not undergone trisyllabic laxing: *southern*, *pleasant*, and *shadow*. However, we must select only one.\n\nLet's consider the nuance.\n*   *southern* and *pleasant* show vowel shortening, but in a disyllabic context. The phonological process (laxing) is similar, but the environment is wrong for it to be TSL.\n*   *shadow*, on the other hand, fails to meet the criteria on two fundamental levels. First, it is disyllabic. Second, its etymology shows that the vowel in question (/æ/) was never long to begin with, so no shortening or \"laxing\" ever took place in its sound development.\n\nTherefore, *shadow* is the most definitive example of a word on the list that has no connection to the process of trisyllabic laxing. While *southern* and *pleasant* underwent a different type of laxing, *shadow* did not undergo this type of laxing at all.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
