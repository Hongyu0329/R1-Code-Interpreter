No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because the stable crystal structures of borophene are centrosymmetric, which means their second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (`χ⁽²⁾`), the material property essential for this process, is zero.
