    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC).**\nSPDC is a nonlinear optical process. In this quantum process, a single photon of higher energy (the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into two photons of lower energy (the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons). The key requirements for this process are the conservation of energy and momentum. Critically, the material mediating this interaction must possess a significant second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as `χ⁽²⁾` (chi-two).\n\n**Step 2: Relate the material property `χ⁽²⁾` to its crystal symmetry.**\nThe second-order susceptibility `χ⁽²⁾` is a third-rank tensor that describes the material's nonlinear response to an applied electric field. A fundamental principle in physics states that the properties of a crystal must be invariant under the symmetry operations of its crystal lattice. For `χ⁽²⁾` to be non-zero within the electric-dipole approximation (which is the dominant mechanism for SPDC), the material's crystal structure must lack a center of inversion symmetry. Materials that have a center of inversion are called \"centrosymmetric,\" and for such materials, `χ⁽²⁾ = 0`. Consequently, centrosymmetric materials do not exhibit SPDC through this primary mechanism.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure and symmetry of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene).**\nBoron nanosheets, often called borophene, are two-dimensional (2D) allotropes of boron. Unlike graphene, which has a single stable form (the honeycomb lattice), borophene is highly polymorphic, meaning it can exist in several different stable or metastable structures. We must examine the symmetry of these common structures.\n*   **Common Phases:** The most widely studied and experimentally synthesized phases of borophene (typically grown on substrates like Ag(111)) are the `β₁₂` phase and the `χ₃` phase.\n*   **Symmetry of `β₁₂` Borophene:** The crystal structure of the `β₁₂` sheet belongs to the orthorhombic system with the space group `Pmmn`. The associated point group is `D₂h` (`mmm`). This point group contains an inversion center. Therefore, `β₁₂` borophene is centrosymmetric.\n*   **Symmetry of `χ₃` Borophene:** The crystal structure of the `χ₃` sheet also belongs to the orthorhombic system, with the space group `Cmcm`. The associated point group is also `D₂h` (`mmm`), which possesses an inversion center. Therefore, `χ₃` borophene is also centrosymmetric.\n*   **General Conclusion:** Most theoretically predicted stable, free-standing borophene sheets are centrosymmetric.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the findings to answer the question.**\n1.  SPDC requires a material with a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, `χ⁽²⁾`.\n2.  A non-zero `χ⁽²⁾` requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n3.  The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Therefore, the `χ⁽²⁾` of ideal, pristine boron nanosheets is zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on this analysis, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Free-standing vs. Substrate-Supported:** The question specifies \"free-standing.\" This is a crucial detail. When borophene is grown on a substrate (e.g., silver), the interaction with the substrate breaks the overall inversion symmetry of the system, which could induce a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾`. However, for an ideal free-standing sheet, this extrinsic effect is absent.\n2.  **Bulk vs. Surface/Interface Effects:** In any material, inversion symmetry is broken at its surface. Since a 2D material is essentially all surface, one might argue there's an inherent `χ⁽²⁾` response. However, SPDC is most efficient as a bulk phenomenon where the light interacts with the material over a significant path length. For an atomically thin layer, the interaction volume is minuscule, making any such surface-type effect extremely weak and generally not considered a characteristic property of the material.\n3.  **Higher-Order Effects:** Non-linear optical effects can also arise from higher-order multipole interactions (e.g., electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole). These interactions follow different symmetry selection rules and can be present in centrosymmetric materials. However, these effects are typically several orders of magnitude weaker than the electric-dipole `χ⁽²⁾` effects and are not what is conventionally implied when asking if a material \"exhibits\" SPDC.\n4.  **Defects, Strain, and Edges:** The presence of defects, applied strain, or specific structures at the edges of the nanosheet can locally break the inversion symmetry and potentially lead to a `χ⁽²⁾` response. The question, however, implies the intrinsic property of the ideal nanosheet structure, not one that has been extrinsically modified.\n5.  **Comparison with other 2D materials:** It is useful to contrast borophene with other 2D materials. Graphene is also centrosymmetric and thus does not exhibit SPDC. In contrast, monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) like MoS₂ and WSe₂ are non-centrosymmetric and are known to have a strong `χ⁽²⁾` response, making them candidates for SPDC. This comparison highlights that symmetry is the key deciding factor.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe primary mechanism for spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) relies on a material possessing a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (`χ⁽²⁾`). According to fundamental symmetry principles, `χ⁽²⁾` is zero in materials with a crystal structure that has a center of inversion (i.e., is centrosymmetric). The stable, intrinsic structures of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the `β₁₂` and `χ₃` phases, are centrosymmetric. Consequently, their `χ⁽²⁾` is zero. Therefore, they are not expected to exhibit SPDC. While minor effects from surfaces or higher-order interactions might exist in theory, they would be exceedingly weak and do not constitute the characteristic SPDC phenomenon.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because the stable crystal structures of borophene are centrosymmetric, which means their second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (`χ⁽²⁾`), the material property essential for this process, is zero.>>>"
