A threshold signature scheme based on Schnorr signatures, such as FROST, provides a blueprint for a tightly secure two-round design. The process involves two phases:
1.  **Distributed Key Generation (DKG):** All `n` parties use a Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) protocol (like Pedersen VSS) to jointly create a single public key `Y` while each party `i` obtains a private share `x_i` of the secret key. This phase is performed once and ensures that no single party ever knows the full private key.
2.  **Two-Round Signing:** For a given message `m`, any `t` participants can create a signature as follows:
    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** Each of the `t` signers `P_i` generates two secret nonces (`d_i`, `e_i`) and broadcasts their public commitments (`D_i=g^{d_i}`, `E_i=g^{e_i}`). This two-part commitment is crucial for security against adaptive attacks.
    *   **Round 2 (Signing):** After receiving all commitments, each `P_i` computes a binding factor, the aggregate nonce commitment `R`, and the challenge `c = H(R, Y, m)`. Then, each `P_i` computes their partial signature `z_i = (d_i + e_i*ρ_i) + c*λ_i*x_i`, where `λ_i` is their Lagrange coefficient. These partial signatures `z_i` are broadcast.

An aggregator then combines the partial signatures `z = Σ z_i` to form the final signature `(R, z)`, which can be publicly verified. This design achieves tight security by avoiding proof techniques that incur security loss (like the Forking Lemma) and is robust because individual partial signatures can be verified, allowing for the identification of malicious signers.
