    "An analysis of the problem to find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Semidihedral Group `SD_{512}`**\nThe semidihedral group of order `2^m` is denoted `SD_{2^m}`. For a size of 512, we have `n = 512 = 2^9`, so `m=9`.\nThe group `G = SD_{512}` has the following presentation:\n`G = <r, s | r^(2^(m-1)) = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(m-2) - 1)>`\nSubstituting `m=9`:\n`G = <r, s | r^256 = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^(128 - 1) = r^127>`\n\nThe elements of `G` are of two forms:\n1.  Elements of the cyclic subgroup `<r>`: `r^i` for `0 <= i < 256`. There are 256 such elements.\n2.  Elements of the coset `s<r>`: `sr^i` for `0 <= i < 256`. There are 256 such elements.\nThe total number of elements is `256 + 256 = 512`.\n\n**Step 2: Define Power Subgroup**\nA subgroup `H` of a group `G` is a power subgroup if there exists an integer `k` such that `H` is the set of all `k`-th powers of elements of `G`. We denote this set as `G^k = {g^k | g ∈ G}`. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the powers of elements in `G`**\nWe need to compute `g^k` for `g ∈ G`.\n\n*   **Powers of `r^i`**:\n    `(r^i)^k = r^(ik)`\n\n*   **Powers of `sr^i`**: To compute `(sr^i)^k`, we first find its square.\n    The relation `srs = r^127` implies `sr = r^127 s`. Using this, we find how `s` commutes with `r^i`: `sr^i = r^(127i) s`.\n    Now, let's compute the square:\n    `(sr^i)^2 = sr^i sr^i = s(r^i s)r^i = s(s r^(127i))r^i = s^2 r^(127i) r^i = r^(127i + i) = r^(128i)`.\n    So, `(sr^i)^2 = r^(128i)`.\n\nNow, we analyze `G^k = { (r^i)^k } ∪ { (sr^i)^k }` based on the parity of `k`.\n\n**Case 1: `k` is an odd integer**\nIf `k` is odd, let `k = 2j+1` for some integer `j`.\n\n*   The set of powers `{(r^i)^k | 0 <= i < 256}` becomes `{r^(ik) | 0 <= i < 256}`. Since `k` is odd, `gcd(k, 256) = 1`. This means that as `i` runs from 0 to 255, `ik mod 256` also takes all values from 0 to 255. So, this set is `<r>`, the entire cyclic subgroup of order 256.\n*   The set of powers `{(sr^i)^k | 0 <= i < 256}`:\n    `(sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^(2j+1) = ((sr^i)^2)^j (sr^i) = (r^(128i))^j (sr^i) = r^(128ij) sr^i`.\n    This element belongs to the coset `s<r>`. We need to determine if this set generates the entire coset. We can rewrite the element:\n    `r^(128ij) sr^i = s (s^{-1} r^(128ij) s) r^i = s (s r s)^(128ij) r^i = s (r^127)^(128ij) r^i`.\n    Since `127 * 128 = (128-1)*128 = 128^2 - 128`, and `r^256=1`, `r^(128^2)=r^(16384)=1` and `r^(-128)`. So `r^(127*128) = r^(-128)`.\n    The element becomes `s r^(-128ij) r^i = s r^(i - 128ij) = s r^(i(1 - 128j))`.\n    To see if this covers the entire coset `s<r>`, we check if the exponent `i(1-128j)` can take all values mod 256. This happens if `gcd(1-128j, 256) = 1`. Since `1-128j` is always odd, its gcd with `256 = 2^8` is indeed 1. Thus, this set is exactly `s<r>`.\n*   So for any odd `k`, `G^k = <r> ∪ s<r> = G`. This means all odd values of `k` generate the same power subgroup, which is the group `G` itself. This gives **1** power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: `k` is an even integer**\nIf `k` is even, let `k = 2j` for some integer `j`.\n\n*   The set of powers `{(r^i)^k | 0 <= i < 256}` is `{r^(ik) | 0 <= i < 256}`. This forms the subgroup `<r^(gcd(k, 256))>`.\n*   The set of powers `{(sr^i)^k | 0 <= i < 256}`:\n    `(sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^(2j) = ((sr^i)^2)^j = (r^(128i))^j = r^(128ij)`.\n    Since `k=2j`, this is `r^(64ik)`. This set forms the subgroup `<r^(gcd(64k, 256))>`.\n*   The power subgroup `G^k` is the union of these two subgroups of `<r>`, which is the subgroup generated by both.\n    `G^k = <r^(gcd(k, 256)), r^(gcd(64k, 256))> = <r^(gcd(gcd(k, 256), gcd(64k, 256)))>`.\n    `gcd(gcd(k, 256), gcd(64k, 256)) = gcd(k, 256, 64k) = gcd(k, 256)`.\n*   So, for any even integer `k`, `G^k = <r^(gcd(k, 256))>`.\n*   We need to find how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way. The subgroup is determined by `d = gcd(k, 256)`, where `k` is even.\n*   Since `k` is even, `d = gcd(k, 256)` must be a multiple of `gcd(2, 256) = 2`. Thus, `d` must be an even divisor of 256.\n*   The divisors of `256 = 2^8` are `2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8` (i.e., `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256`).\n*   The even divisors of 256 are `{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}`.\n*   There are **8** such divisors. Each corresponds to a unique subgroup `<r^d>`. For any of these values `d`, we can choose `k=d`, which is even, giving `G^d = <r^(gcd(d, 256))> = <r^d>`.\n*   Thus, there are 8 distinct power subgroups that arise from even values of `k`. These are `<r^2>`, `<r^4>`, ..., `<r^256> = {1}`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of power subgroups**\nThe set of power subgroups from odd `k` is `{G}`.\nThe set of power subgroups from even `k` is `{<r^2>, <r^4>, ..., <r^256>}`.\nThese two sets of subgroups are disjoint, as `G` has order 512, while the others are proper subgroups of `<r>` and have orders from 1 to 128.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = (Number from odd k) + (Number from even k) = 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nThe 9 distinct power subgroups are:\n1.  `G = SD_{512}`\n2.  `<r^2>`\n3.  `<r^4>`\n4.  `<r^8>`\n5.  `<r^16>`\n6.  `<r^32>`\n7.  `<r^64>`\n8.  `<r^128>`\n9.  `<r^256> = {1}`\n\nThe final answer is the total count of these subgroups."
