The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial; it follows the Parker Spiral, typically making a ~45Â° angle with the radial direction. Your expectation that normalized magnetic helicity should be calculated using components perpendicular to the local magnetic field is physically correct.

However, the use of components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., the Y and Z components in a standard GSE or RTN coordinate system) is a widely used and practical approximation. The justification for this is not that the magnetic field is radial, but is instead based on the **Taylor "Frozen-In Flow" Hypothesis**. This hypothesis assumes that since the solar wind velocity is much greater than the wave propagation speed and is overwhelmingly radial, the waves are essentially "frozen" into the plasma and are carried past the stationary spacecraft in a radial direction. Therefore, the wave propagation vector **k** is *approximated* as being radial. Since magnetic helicity is defined in the plane perpendicular to **k**, this approximation justifies using the plane perpendicular to the radial direction for the calculation. While this introduces a predictable projection error in the magnitude of the helicity, it is computationally simpler and often sufficient for determining the wave polarization (left vs. right).
