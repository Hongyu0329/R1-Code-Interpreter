    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Engulfment of amyloid by macrophages.\n    *   **Key Action:** A protein is \"broken down\" or degraded.\n    *   **The Link:** The breakdown of this specific protein is the trigger that *allows* or *enables* the engulfment to happen.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify this specific protein.\n\n2.  **Understand the Biological Context:**\n    *   **Amyloid:** This typically refers to amyloid-beta (AÎ²) plaques, which are extracellular aggregates of protein fragments. They are a primary pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.\n    *   **Macrophages:** These are a type of white blood cell of the immune system that engulfs and digests cellular debris, pathogens, and foreign substances through a process called phagocytosis. In the brain, the resident macrophage-like cells are called **microglia**. Microglia are the primary cells responsible for trying to clear amyloid plaques.\n    *   **The Problem:** In Alzheimer's disease, for reasons not fully understood, microglia become dysfunctional and fail to effectively clear amyloid plaques, leading to their accumulation. The question implies that a specific molecular block prevents this clearance.\n\n3.  **Identify the Molecular Mechanism:**\n    *   The question points to a mechanism where an inhibitory signal is removed. Think of it like a protective shield around the amyloid plaque. When this shield is broken down, the plaque becomes vulnerable to being eaten by microglia.\n    *   Recent major scientific findings have pinpointed a specific protein involved in this \"shielding\" process. This mechanism involves the **complement system**, a part of the innate immune system that helps clear pathogens and debris.\n    *   The protein in question is **Complement Component 4 (C4)**.\n\n4.  **Trace the Process in Detail:**\n    *   **Step A: Coating the Plaque:** The C4 protein is activated and cleaved, producing fragments. One of these fragments, **C4b**, binds strongly to the surface of amyloid-beta plaques, coating them.\n    *   **Step B: The Inhibitory Signal:** This layer of C4b on the plaque acts as a \"don't eat me\" signal for microglia. It effectively camouflages the plaque, preventing microglial receptors from recognizing and binding to it for phagocytosis.\n    *   **Step C: The Breakdown:** The \"breakdown\" mentioned in the question refers to the enzymatic degradation of this protective C4b layer. Microglia themselves can secrete proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) that are capable of degrading C4b.\n    *   **Step D: Allowing Engulfment:** When the C4b shield is broken down and removed by these proteases, the amyloid plaque is \"unmasked.\" This allows microglial receptors to engage with the plaque, leading to its engulfment and clearance. The activity of these proteases is, in turn, regulated by other proteins called protease inhibitors (like SERPINA3).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of Microglia:** While the question uses the general term \"macrophage,\" in the context of amyloid plaques in the brain, the specific cell type is the **microglia**.\n*   **Protein vs. Protein Fragment:** The protein that is physically on the plaque and gets broken down is the **C4b fragment**. However, C4b is derived from its parent protein, **C4**. In biological terms, answering \"C4\" is correct as it is the gene product and the source of the functional fragment.\n*   **Mechanism is Inhibitory Removal:** It's crucial to understand this isn't a protein that helps with engulfment. It's a protein that *prevents* engulfment, and its removal (breakdown) is what allows the process to proceed.\n*   **Recent Discovery:** This C4b-shielding mechanism is a relatively new and significant finding in Alzheimer's research, highlighting a novel therapeutic avenue: targeting the breakdown of this C4b shield to enhance plaque clearance.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the protein whose breakdown on the surface of amyloid plaques permits their engulfment by microglia/macrophages is C4b, a fragment of the parent protein C4.\n\n***\nThe protein is **Complement Component 4 (C4)**. Specifically, its fragment C4b coats amyloid plaques, and the breakdown of this C4b layer allows macrophages (microglia) to engulf the plaque.\n\n<<<Complement Component 4 (C4)>>>"
