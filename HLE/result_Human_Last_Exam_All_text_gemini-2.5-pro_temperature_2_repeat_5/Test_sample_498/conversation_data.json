    "This is a sequence puzzle. To solve it, we need to identify the underlying pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation**\nThe sequence is Z, X, X, C, V, Y, B, N, _\nAt first glance, the letters seem random. They are not in alphabetical or reverse-alphabetical order. A simple arithmetic skip pattern (e.g., skip 2 letters, skip 3 letters) also does not fit.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Primary Pattern**\nLet's look at the letters on a standard QWERTY keyboard. We can notice that many of the letters in the sequence appear on the bottom row of the keyboard.\nThe bottom row of letters is: **Z, X, C, V, B, N, M**\nOur sequence contains Z, X, C, V, B, and N. These letters appear in the correct order as they would on the keyboard. This suggests that one of the patterns is the sequence of keys on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Secondary Pattern**\nLet's extract the primary keyboard pattern from our sequence and see what letters are left over.\nOriginal Sequence: Z X X C V Y B N\nKeyboard Pattern: Z X _ C V _ B N\nThe letters that do not belong to the keyboard-row pattern are X and Y.\nLet's call the keyboard row letters \"Sequence A\" and these leftover letters \"Sequence B\".\n*   Sequence A: Z, X, C, V, B, N, ... (The next letter would be M)\n*   Sequence B: X, Y, ...\nSequence B (X, Y) is a simple alphabetical sequence. The next letter would be Z.\n\n**Step 4: Determining the Interleaving Rule**\nNow we need to understand how Sequence A and Sequence B are combined.\nLet's trace the pattern:\n1.  **Z**: First letter from Sequence A.\n2.  **X**: Second letter from Sequence A.\n3.  **X**: First letter from Sequence B.\n4.  **C**: Third letter from Sequence A.\n5.  **V**: Fourth letter from Sequence A.\n6.  **Y**: Second letter from Sequence B.\n7.  **B**: Fifth letter from Sequence A.\n8.  **N**: Sixth letter from Sequence A.\n9.  **_**: This is the letter we need to find.\n\nThe pattern of combination is: (A, A, B), (A, A, B), (A, A, ...).\nWe have two letters from Sequence A (B, N), so the next letter should be the next letter from Sequence B.\n\n**Step 5: Finding the Next Letter**\nWe established that Sequence B is an alphabetical sequence: X, Y, ...\nThe next letter after Y in the alphabet is Z.\nTherefore, the blank should be filled by the third letter of Sequence B, which is Z.\n\nLet's confirm the full pattern:\n-   The main sequence is the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard: Z, X, C, V, B, N, M...\n-   The secondary sequence is alphabetical: X, Y, Z...\n-   The combined sequence takes two letters from the main sequence, then one from the secondary, and repeats.\n-   `Z, X` (from keyboard) -> `X` (from alphabet)\n-   `C, V` (from keyboard) -> `Y` (from alphabet)\n-   `B, N` (from keyboard) -> `_` (from alphabet)\nThe next letter in the alphabet sequence X, Y... is Z.\n\n<<<Z>>>"
