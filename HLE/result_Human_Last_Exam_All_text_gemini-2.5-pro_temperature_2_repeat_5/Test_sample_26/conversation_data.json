    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Characterize the space $X$\n*   $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This means $X$ is defined by the vanishing of a single non-singular homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   $X$ is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ of complex dimension 2. As a real manifold, its dimension is 4.\n*   Since $X$ is a compact complex manifold, it has the structure of a finite CW complex.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the connectivity of $X$\n*   We use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for homotopy groups. This theorem relates the homotopy groups of a smooth complex subvariety to those of the ambient projective space.\n*   Let $X$ be a smooth complex subvariety of dimension $n$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^N$. The inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^N$ induces isomorphisms $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^N)$ for $k < n$ and a surjection for $k=n$.\n*   In our case, $X$ is a surface, so its complex dimension is $n=2$. The ambient space is $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, so $N=3$.\n*   The theorem implies that $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism for $k < 2$.\n*   For $k=1$, we get an isomorphism $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n*   The homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ are known. From the fibration $S^1 \\to S^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$, we know $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$.\n*   Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. This means $X$ is simply connected.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the ranks of homotopy and homology groups\n*   A major result from Serre's C-theory states that for any simply connected finite CW complex $Y$, the Hurewicz homomorphism $h_k: \\pi_k(Y) \\to H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$ induces an isomorphism on the free parts of these abelian groups. That is, the kernel and cokernel of $h_k$ are torsion groups for all $k \\ge 1$.\n*   This implies that the rank of the homotopy group is equal to the rank of the homology group:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\pi_k(Y)) = \\text{rank}(H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Z})) = b_k(Y)$ (the k-th Betti number).\n*   Since $X$ is a simply connected finite CW complex, this result applies. We need to find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$, so we must compute the rank of $H_3(X)$, which is the third Betti number, $b_3(X)$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Betti number $b_3(X)$\n*   The Betti numbers of a smooth projective variety can be determined using Hodge theory. For a complex surface like $X$, the Betti numbers are related to its Hodge numbers $h^{p,q} = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} H^q(X, \\Omega^p_X)$.\n*   The first Betti number is $b_1(X) = h^{1,0} + h^{0,1}$. Since $X$ is a KÃ¤hler manifold, $h^{p,q}=h^{q,p}$, so $b_1(X) = 2h^{1,0}$. From Step 2, $\\pi_1(X)=0$, which implies $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})=0$ (as it's the abelianization of $\\pi_1$). Therefore, $b_1(X) = \\text{rank}(H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}))=0$, which in turn implies $h^{1,0}=0$.\n*   The third Betti number is given by $b_3(X) = h^{2,1} + h^{1,2}$.\n*   By Serre Duality for a complex surface (of dimension 2), we have $h^{p,q} = h^{2-p, 2-q}$.\n*   Applying this duality, we find:\n    *   $h^{1,2} = h^{2-1, 2-2} = h^{1,0}$.\n    *   $h^{2,1} = h^{2-2, 2-1} = h^{0,1}$.\n*   Therefore, $b_3(X) = h^{2,1} + h^{1,2} = h^{0,1} + h^{1,0} = b_1(X)$.\n*   Since $b_1(X)=0$, it follows that $b_3(X)=0$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$\n*   From Step 3, we have the relation $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$.\n*   From Step 4, we have calculated $b_3(X) = 0$.\n*   Therefore, the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0. This means that $\\pi_3(X)$ is a torsion group.\n\nFinal Summary: The analysis uses the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem to establish that $X$ is simply connected. Then, Serre's C-theory allows us to equate the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ with the Betti number $b_3(X)$. Using tools from Hodge theory, specifically Serre duality, we show that for a simply connected complex surface, $b_3=b_1$. Since $b_1=0$, it follows that $b_3=0$, and hence the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0."
