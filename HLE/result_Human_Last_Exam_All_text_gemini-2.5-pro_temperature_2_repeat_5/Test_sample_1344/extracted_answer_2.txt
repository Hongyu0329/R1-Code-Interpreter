The optimal combination is a **Hafnium (Hf)** metal center complexed with a thermally robust, tridentate **PNP-pincer ligand** (a ligand with a central nitrogen donor and two phosphine donor arms), which is heterogenized by grafting it as single sites onto a high-surface-area **mesoporous silica support like SBA-15**.
