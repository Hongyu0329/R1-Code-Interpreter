    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed-form expression of the infinite product.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product using q-series notation.**\nThe infinite product is given by $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\nLet's define $q = e^{-\\pi}$. Since $0 < e^{-\\pi} < 1$, the product converges.\nThe product can be written in terms of $q$ as:\n$$ P = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) $$\nThis is a standard object in the theory of q-series and elliptic functions. In terms of the q-Pochhammer symbol, this is $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to standard functions in number theory.**\nWe can relate this product to Euler's function, $\\phi(q)$, which is defined as:\n$$ \\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n) = (q;q)_\\infty $$\nWe can write $\\phi(q)$ as a product of terms with even and odd powers of $q$:\n$$ \\phi(q) = \\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1})\\right) \\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})\\right) $$\nThe first part of this product is exactly our product $P$ (with the index shifted from $n=0$ to $n=1$, which does not change the product).\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1}) = \\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k+1}) = P $$\nThe second part is:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n}) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-(q^2)^n) = \\phi(q^2) $$\nSo, we have the relation:\n$$ \\phi(q) = P \\cdot \\phi(q^2) $$\nThis means our product is the ratio of two Euler functions:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)} = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})} $$\n\n**Step 3: Use the theory of elliptic functions and modular forms.**\nThe product $P(q) = (q;q^2)_\\infty$ can be related to Ramanujan's class invariants. Ramanujan defined the function $G(q)$ as:\n$$ G(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1})^{-1} = \\frac{1}{(q;q^2)_\\infty} = \\frac{1}{P(q)} $$\nThe class invariants $G_n$ are the values of $G(q)$ for $q = e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}}$.\n$$ G_n = G(e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}}) $$\nFor our problem, we have $q=e^{-\\pi}$, which corresponds to $n=1$. So we need to find the value of $G_1 = G(e^{-\\pi})$. Our product is then $P = 1/G_1$.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the class invariant $G_n$ to the elliptic modulus.**\nThere is a known relation between the class invariant $G_n$ and the elliptic modulus $k_n=k(i\\sqrt{n})$, where $k(\\tau)$ is the elliptic modulus corresponding to the nome $q = e^{i\\pi\\tau}$. For the general nome $q=e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}}$, the relation is:\n$$ G_n = (4 k_n k'_n)^{-1/24} $$\nwhere $k'_n = \\sqrt{1-k_n^2}$ is the complementary modulus.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate for the specific case n=1.**\nFor $n=1$, we have $q = e^{-\\pi}$. We need to find the corresponding elliptic modulus $k_1 = k(i)$. The relation between the nome $q$ and the modulus $k$ is given by $q = e^{-\\pi K(k')/K(k)}$, where $K$ is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\nFor $\\tau = i$, we are at a special point known as the lemniscatic case. The modulus is known to be:\n$$ k_1 = k(i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nThe complementary modulus is:\n$$ k'_1 = \\sqrt{1-k_1^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nNow we can calculate $G_1$:\n$$ G_1 = \\left(4 \\cdot k_1 \\cdot k'_1\\right)^{-1/24} = \\left(4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{-1/24} = \\left(\\frac{4}{2}\\right)^{-1/24} = 2^{-1/24} $$\n\n**Step 6: Find the final value of the product.**\nOur original product is $P = 1/G_1$. Substituting the value we found for $G_1$:\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{2^{-1/24}} = 2^{1/24} $$\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$ has the closed-form expression $2^{1/24}$."
