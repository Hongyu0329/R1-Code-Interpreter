    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button in the described poker scenario.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Scenario:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB deep No-Limit Hold'em cash game. This is the standard stack depth for which most Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategies are based.\n    *   **Rake-Free:** This detail is important. The absence of rake (a fee taken from the pot by the house) slightly increases the expected value (EV) of playing any given hand, as the winner keeps the entire pot. This encourages playing a slightly wider, or looser, range of hands compared to a raked game.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most profitable position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street (flop, turn, river), which provides a massive informational advantage. Because of this, you should play the widest range of hands from the button.\n    *   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x the big blind. This is a standard opening size from late position.\n\n2.  **Define the Question:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"worst suited jack\" that you *should* open. \"Suited jack\" refers to any hand containing one Jack and a second, lower card of the same suit (e.g., J9s, J5s, etc.).\n    *   \"Should open\" implies the hand is part of a standard, profitable GTO opening range. We are not looking for a hand you should fold, but rather the weakest one that is still a correct open-raise.\n    *   \"Worst\" means the hand with the lowest profitability or Expected Value (EV) among all suited jacks that are considered standard opens.\n\n3.  **Consult GTO Opening Ranges:**\n    *   Modern poker strategy relies on GTO solvers that calculate the optimal way to play in a given situation. For a 100BB cash game, GTO opening ranges from the button are very wide, often including 40-50% of all possible starting hands.\n    *   The value of hands from the button is determined by a combination of high-card strength, connectivity (ability to make straights), and suitedness (ability to make flushes).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Suited Jack Hands:**\n    *   Let's list the suited jack combinations in descending order of general strength:\n        *   **AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs:** Premium and very strong hands. Obvious opens.\n        *   **J9s, J8s:** Strong suited connectors/one-gappers. Clear opens with great playability.\n        *   **J7s, J6s, J5s:** Medium-strength suited hands. Their value comes primarily from flush potential and the positional advantage. These are standard opens from the button.\n        *   **J4s, J3s, J2s:** These are the weakest suited jacks. They have a large gap between the two cards, reducing their straight potential. Their value is almost entirely derived from their flush potential and the fact that you are on the button.\n\n5.  **Identify the Bottom of the Range:**\n    *   In a standard GTO button opening range, all suited aces, suited kings, suited queens, etc., are opened. This logic extends to suited jacks.\n    *   Because you are on the button in a rake-free game, your opening range should be very wide. All suited jacks, from AJs all the way down to the very weakest one, are considered profitable open-raises.\n    *   The strength of these hands decreases as the kicker gets lower. J4s is weaker than J5s, J3s is weaker than J4s, and J2s is the weakest of them all. The '2' kicker offers the least help in making straights and is easily dominated.\n    *   Therefore, the suited jack with the lowest expected value that is still a standard, profitable open-raise is **J2s**. It is the \"worst\" of the good hands in this category.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe weakest, or \"worst,\" suited Jack that is still considered a standard and profitable open-raise from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game is the one with the lowest possible kicker, which is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
