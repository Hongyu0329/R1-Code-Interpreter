    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance:** The question refers to the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, with Svetlana Zakharova in the lead role of Odette/Odile. The most widely available professional recording of this specific production with Zakharova was filmed and broadcast live in cinemas in 2015, but it is the same choreography and staging. We will analyze this reference performance.\n\n2.  **Locate the Specific Dance:** We need to find the Odette variation in Act II. This is the solo for the white swan that occurs after the famous White Adagio (the pas de deux between Odette and Prince Siegfried).\n\n3.  **Define the Ballet Step:** The step to be counted is the *sissone fermée*. A *sissone* is a jump that takes off from two feet. A *sissone fermée* (meaning \"closed sissone\") is one where the dancer lands on one foot and then quickly closes the other foot to it, usually into 5th position. In this particular variation, they are performed traveling forward (*en avant*).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:** Yuri Grigorovich's choreography for this solo is iconic and follows a set structure.\n    *   The variation begins with slow, lyrical movements showcasing Odette's grace and swan-like arm movements (*port de bras*).\n    *   Following this introduction, the tempo increases, and Odette begins a diagonal traveling sequence of jumps from one corner of the stage to the other.\n    *   This specific sequence is where the *sissone fermées* are performed.\n\n5.  **Count the Steps:** By watching Zakharova's performance of this variation, we can count the steps in the diagonal sequence.\n    *   She prepares in the upstage corner.\n    *   She executes a series of sharp, quick jumps traveling forward. These are the *sissone fermées*.\n    *   Counting each jump in this distinct sequence, we find there are exactly seven performed in a row.\n    *   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.\n\n6.  **Confirm the Final Count:** After this diagonal of seven *sissone fermées*, the choreography transitions to other steps, such as *entrechat quatres*, *piqué* turns, and the final turning manège. There are no other *sissone fermées* in the remainder of the variation.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Performance:** It is crucial to analyze the correct production and dancer. The Grigorovich choreography is standard for the Bolshoi, and Zakharova's execution is a key reference.\n*   **Correct Act and Variation:** The count must be limited to the Act II Odette variation, not the entire ballet or other solos (like the Odile variation in Act III).\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** One must accurately identify a *sissone fermée* and distinguish it from other similar-looking jumps like a *temps levé* or an *assemblé*. The take-off from two feet is the defining characteristic of a *sissone*.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the performance, the total number is determined.\n\n<<<7>>>"
