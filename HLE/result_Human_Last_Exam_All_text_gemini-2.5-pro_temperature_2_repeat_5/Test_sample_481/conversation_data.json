    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the different numbers imprinted on Teva brand fluoxetine capsules for 10mg and 20mg dosages.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**\n    *   **Medication 1:** Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules.\n    *   **Medication 2:** Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n    *   **Information to Find:** The numbers imprinted on the capsules.\n    *   **Information to Exclude:** Color differences, the word \"PLIVA\", and size differences.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the different numerical codes for each dosage strength.\n\n2.  **Identify the Imprint for Teva Fluoxetine 10mg Capsules:**\n    *   To find the correct imprint, one must consult a reliable drug identification database (such as the FDA's National Drug Code Directory or Drugs.com).\n    *   A search for \"Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule\" reveals that the capsule is imprinted with \"TEVA 3105\".\n    *   The numerical part of this imprint is **3105**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Imprint for Teva Fluoxetine 20mg Capsules:**\n    *   Similarly, a search for \"Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule\" shows that this capsule is imprinted with \"TEVA 3106\".\n    *   The numerical part of this imprint is **3106**.\n\n4.  **Compare the Numbers and Formulate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is 3105.\n    *   The number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is 3106.\n    *   These are the two different numbers that distinguish the dosages as requested.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Manufacturer Specificity:** It is crucial to confirm the imprints are specific to the \"Teva\" brand, as other manufacturers of generic fluoxetine use different codes. The codes 3105 and 3106 are confirmed for Teva.\n*   **Adhering to Constraints:** The response must carefully avoid any mention of color, size, or the word \"PLIVA\" to meet the user's specific negative constraints.\n*   **Clarity on \"Numbers\":** The question asks specifically for the \"numbers\" on the capsules. The full imprints are \"TEVA 3105\" and \"TEVA 3106\", so the distinct numerical portions are 3105 and 3106.\n\n<<<The number imprinted on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is 3105, and the number on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is 3106.>>>"
