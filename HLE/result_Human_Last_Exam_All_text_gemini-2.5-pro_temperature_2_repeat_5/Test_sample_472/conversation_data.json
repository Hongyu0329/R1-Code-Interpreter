    "This question requires a metrical analysis, or scansion, of a line of Latin poetry from Plautus. The meter is a Trochaic Septenarius, which consists of seven trochaic feet (`L S`) followed by a single catalectic syllable (a long, which can be represented by a short syllable under the principle of *brevis in longo*).\n\nThe ideal pattern is:\nL S | L S | L S | L S || L S | L S | L S | L\n\nIn Plautine meter, this ideal form is rarely found. Substitutions and resolutions are very common:\n*   A trochee (`L S`) can be substituted by a spondee (`L L`).\n*   The long syllable (`L`) of a foot can be \"resolved\" into two short syllables (`S S`). This allows a trochee (`L S`) to become a tribrach (`S S S`), and a spondee (`L L`) can become an anapest (`S S L`) or a dactyl (`L S S`). A proceleusmatic (`S S S S`) is also possible.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**Line:** \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n1.  **Syllable Count and Hiatus:** First, we determine the number of syllables. A key point is the junction `bene esse`. While elision (running the words together as `benesse`) is common, Plautine trochaic lines often use **hiatus** (a pause between the words, keeping both vowels). Given that a Trochaic Septenarius has 15 syllables, we must assume hiatus here, preserving all syllables.\n    `et(1) ti-bi(2) be-ne(2) es-se(2) so-li(2) quom(1) si-bi(2) sit(1) ma-le(2)` = 15 syllables. This fits the meter.\n\n2.  **Syllable Quantity (Long 'L' or Short 'S'):**\n    *   `et`: Long by position (followed by `t` in `tibi`). **L**\n    *   `ti-bi`: Both vowels are naturally short. **S S**\n    *   `be-ne`: Both vowels are naturally short. **S S**\n    *   `es-se`: `es-` is a closed syllable (followed by `ss`), making it long by position. `-se` is a short vowel in an open syllable. **L S**\n    *   `so-li`: Dative of *solus*. The `o` is naturally long (`sōlus`) and the dative `-i` is long (`-ī`). **L L**\n    *   `quom`: Old spelling of `cum`. The syllable is closed by `m` and followed by a consonant (`s` in `sibi`), so it is long by position. **L**\n    *   `si-bi`: Both vowels are naturally short. **S S**\n    *   `sit`: The syllable is closed by `t`, making it long by position. **L**\n    *   `ma-le`: Both vowels are naturally short. **S S**\n\n    The raw sequence of quantities is: **L S S S S L S L L L S S L S S**\n\n3.  **Parsing into Feet:** Now we group this sequence into trochaic feet (`L S`), allowing for the valid substitutions and resolutions mentioned earlier.\n\n    *   **Foot 1:** `et ti` -> **L S**. This is a perfect trochee.\n    *   **Foot 2:** `bi be ne` -> **S S S**. This is a tribrach, a valid resolution of a trochee (`L S` becomes `S S S`).\n    *   **Foot 3:** `es se` -> **L S**. Another perfect trochee.\n    *   **Foot 4:** `so li` -> **L L**. This is a spondee, a common substitution for a trochee. A major pause (diaeresis) typically occurs here.\n    *   **Foot 5:** `quom si bi` -> **L S S**. This is a dactyl, a valid substitution for a trochee in comic verse.\n    *   **Foot 6:** `sit ma` -> **L S**. A final perfect trochee.\n    *   **Foot 7 (Catalectic):** `le` -> **S**. The final syllable is short, which is permissible at the end of a line (*brevis in longo*).\n\nThis scansion successfully accounts for all 15 syllables and uses metrical variations that are standard for Plautine comedy.\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>"
