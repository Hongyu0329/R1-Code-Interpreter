    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific philosopher who meets three criteria:\n1.  Belongs to the **Lviv-Warsaw School** of philosophy.\n2.  Analyzed the concept of a **\"hallmark\"** (a general term for a sign or indicator).\n3.  Decomposed this concept into two specific types: **\"symptoms\"** and **\"signals\"**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the key terms**\n*   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** A highly influential Polish school of logic and analytical philosophy active between the World Wars. Its members focused on clarity, logical rigor, and the analysis of language. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n*   **Hallmark/Sign:** A general term for something that stands for or indicates something else.\n*   **Symptom vs. Signal:** This is a fundamental distinction in semiotics (the theory of signs).\n    *   A **symptom** is a *natural sign*. The connection between the sign and what it signifies is based on a natural law or causal relationship. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of illness.\n    *   A **signal** is a *conventional* or *artificial sign*. The connection is established by rules, agreement, or intention within a community. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"cat\" is a signal that refers to a specific type of animal.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the distinction to the Lviv-Warsaw School**\nThe school's intense focus on the philosophy of language and logic makes it a very likely place to find this kind of semiotic analysis. We need to examine the work of its key members to see who made this particular distinction.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific philosopher**\n*   While several members of the school worked on language, the philosopher most famously associated with this specific semiotic analysis is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n*   In his works, notably in his influential book *Pragmatic Logic* (*Logika pragmatyczna*), Ajdukiewicz lays out a detailed theory of language.\n*   A cornerstone of his theory is the distinction between different kinds of signs. He uses the Polish term *oznaka* for a symptom (natural sign) and *znak* for a signal (conventional sign, especially those used intentionally in communication, like words).\n*   He used this distinction to clarify the nature of language, which he analyzed as a system of conventional signals, and to differentiate it from other non-conventional systems of signs. The concept of a general \"hallmark\" or \"sign\" is precisely what he \"decomposes\" into these two fundamental categories.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the established scholarship on the Lviv-Warsaw School and the philosophy of language, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the philosopher who introduced and systematically used the distinction between symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) as a way to analyze the broader notion of signs or hallmarks.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
