    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reagents**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry (1S,2R) indicates that the bromine atom and the methyl group are on opposite sides of the ring, making it a *trans* isomer.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) in tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. The solvent is the corresponding conjugate acid.\n\n**2. Determine the Reaction Type**\nThe combination of a secondary alkyl halide and a strong base strongly suggests an elimination reaction. Since the base is strong, the reaction will proceed via the **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** mechanism.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Reaction**\nThe E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (in this case, Br) and the proton being removed (a β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** position. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means both the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be in **axial** positions, one pointing up and the other down.\n\n**4. Draw and Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\nThe substrate is *trans*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. It exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations.\n*   **Conformation A:** The bulky methyl group (-CH₃) occupies the more stable **equatorial** position to minimize steric strain. Since the relationship is *trans*, the bromine atom (Br) must be in the **axial** position.\n*   **Conformation B:** In the ring-flipped conformer, the methyl group is in the **axial** position, and the bromine atom is in the **equatorial** position. This conformation is less stable due to 1,3-diaxial interactions involving the axial methyl group.\n\nThe reaction will proceed through the conformation that meets the anti-periplanar requirement.\n*   **Conformation A (axial Br):** This conformation can undergo E2 elimination because the leaving group is axial.\n*   **Conformation B (equatorial Br):** This conformation cannot undergo E2 elimination because the leaving group is not axial.\nTherefore, the reaction must occur from Conformation A, which is conveniently also the more stable conformer.\n\n**5. Identify the Possible β-Hydrogens for Elimination**\nIn Conformation A (with axial Br), we need to find β-hydrogens that are also axial. The β-carbons are the carbons adjacent to the one bearing the bromine, which are C2 and C6.\n*   **At C2:** This carbon has a methyl group. In Conformation A, the methyl group is equatorial, which means the hydrogen on C2 is **axial**. This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n*   **At C6:** This carbon is a -CH₂- group. It has one **axial** hydrogen and one equatorial hydrogen. The axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n\nSince there are two different axial β-hydrogens, two different elimination products are possible.\n\n**6. Predict the Major Product (Regioselectivity: Zaitsev vs. Hofmann)**\n*   **Path 1 (Elimination of H from C2):** Removing the axial hydrogen from C2 results in a double bond between C1 and C2. The product is **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is a trisubstituted alkene, which is the more thermodynamically stable product (the **Zaitsev product**).\n*   **Path 2 (Elimination of H from C6):** Removing the axial hydrogen from C6 results in a double bond between C1 and C6. The product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a disubstituted alkene, which is the less thermodynamically stable product (the **Hofmann product**).\n\nThe choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann product is determined by the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is a **bulky base**. Due to its large size, it has difficulty accessing the more sterically hindered proton.\n*   The proton at C2 is on a tertiary carbon, partially shielded by the adjacent methyl group.\n*   The proton at C6 is on a secondary carbon (-CH₂-), which is sterically less hindered and more accessible.\n\nBecause the base is bulky, it will preferentially abstract the more accessible proton from C6. Therefore, the major product of the reaction is the less substituted alkene, the Hofmann product.\n\n**7. Final Identification of the Product**\nThe major product formed by the elimination of H from C6 and Br from C1 is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
