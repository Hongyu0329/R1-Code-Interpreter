    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which museum acquired the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Information:** The core elements of the question are:\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\"\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Year of Creation:** 1927\n    *   **Artistic Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Year of Acquisition:** 1967\n    *   **Information to find:** The name of the acquiring museum.\n\n2.  **Translate the Title:** The artist, Kurt Günther, was German. The painting's original title is \"Der Radionist\". Searching for the artwork under its original German title can often yield more precise results, especially from German institutions.\n\n3.  **Search for the Artwork:** A search for \"Kurt Günther Der Radionist 1927\" directs us to collections and databases that list this specific work. The painting is a prominent example of the New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement in Germany.\n\n4.  **Locate the Holding Institution:** The search results consistently point to one museum as the current owner of the painting: the **Lindenau-Museum** located in Altenburg, Germany.\n\n5.  **Verify the Acquisition Details:** The final step is to confirm that the Lindenau-Museum did indeed acquire the painting in the specific year mentioned, 1967. This requires checking the museum's collection records or provenance information for the artwork. The inventory number for this painting at the Lindenau-Museum is G 1459. Museum records state that the painting was acquired (\"erworben\") in 1967 from the heirs of the artist.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Title Variation:** Be aware of the original German title (\"Der Radionist\") versus the English translation (\"The Radionist\"). Using the original language is often more effective for research.\n*   **Creation vs. Acquisition Date:** It's crucial not to confuse the year the painting was created (1927) with the year it was acquired by the museum (1967). The question specifically asks about the acquisition.\n*   **Source Reliability:** Information should be cross-referenced with reliable sources, ideally the holding museum's own database or official publications, to confirm the acquisition details.\n*   **Museum's Full Name:** The official name of the museum is the Staatliches Lindenau-Museum Altenburg, though it is commonly referred to as the Lindenau-Museum.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the museum that acquired Kurt Günther's \"The Radionist\" in 1967 is confirmed.\n\n<<<Lindenau-Museum Altenburg>>>"
