    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The goal is to identify a character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who fulfills three specific criteria:\n    *   They have visited a Roman city.\n    *   They describe the religious practices or symbols of the Romans.\n    *   This description contains a clear allusion to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters:** The novel centers on the Goths (the Wolfings) preparing to fight the invading Romans. Most characters' knowledge of Romans is based on rumors or impending conflict. However, the book introduces a character known for his travels and experience outside the lands of the Goths. This character is **Otter**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Role of Otter:** Otter is a former thrall who has traveled widely, having been a captive and a mercenary among the Romans. He is therefore called upon in the Goths' great hall to share his knowledge of their powerful enemy.\n\n4.  **Locate the Relevant Scene:** The key scene occurs in **Chapter VI, \"Otter tells of the Romans.\"** In this chapter, the war-duke Thiodolf asks Otter to describe the Romans to the assembled Folk-Mote (the tribal assembly) so they can understand who they are about to fight.\n\n5.  **Examine Otter's Description of Roman Beliefs:** Otter describes the Roman cities, military, and way of life from his perspective as a Gothic outsider. When he discusses their origins and beliefs, he says they claim descent from a \"God of the War-heap\" (a clear reference to Mars). He then moves on to describe what he calls their \"holiest image.\"\n\n6.  **Pinpoint the Allusion to Romulus and Remus:** Otter explicitly describes this holy Roman image in a way that is unmistakable to the reader, but filtered through his own Gothic understanding. He says:\n    > \"Forsooth, their holiest image...is a She-wolf giving suck to two man-children; and this they deem a holy and guarded thing, and a token of their fortune, that a wild-wood beast should be the foster-mother of their first father and his brother.\"\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** This passage directly matches all criteria of the question.\n    *   **Character:** Otter.\n    *   **Action:** He is describing what he saw in Roman cities.\n    *   **Allusion:** He describes a she-wolf nursing two human infants, which he identifies as their \"first father and his brother\"â€”a direct reference to the legend of Romulus and Remus without naming them. The reader immediately recognizes the iconic imagery of Rome's founding.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Indirect Reference:** The novel does not use the names \"Romulus\" and \"Remus.\" The description relies on the reader's own knowledge of Roman mythology, which makes the allusion clever. Otter, the character, is describing what he saw and was told, not reciting a history lesson.\n*   **Cultural Perspective:** Otter's description is colored by his own culture. He calls the statue an \"image\" and refers to the wolf as a \"wild-wood beast,\" emphasizing the strangeness of this reverence from a Gothic point of view.\n*   **Narrative Purpose:** This description serves to characterize the Romans as a powerful, ancient, and somewhat strange civilization, setting the stage for the coming conflict.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis confirms that the character who has been among the Romans and describes their foundational myth (the she-wolf and the twins) to the Goths is Otter. This happens in Chapter VI of the book.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
