    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's Criterion.\nLet the prime be $p=2$.\nThe coefficients of $f(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$ are $a_4=1, a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_4=1$.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ divides all other coefficients: $a_3=0$, $a_2=0$, $a_1=8$, and $a_0=14$.\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term $a_0=14$.\n\nBy Eisenstein's Criterion, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 4, its Galois group, let's call it $G$, is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of the polynomial helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFor a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant $\\Delta$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nFor our polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nTo see if $\\Delta$ is a square, let's find its prime factorization.\n$\\Delta = 256(14^3) - 27(8^4) = 2^8(2^3 \\cdot 7^3) - 3^3( (2^3)^4 ) = 2^{11} \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12}$\n$\\Delta = 2^{11} (7^3 - 2 \\cdot 3^3) = 2^{11} (343 - 54) = 2^{11} \\cdot 289 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 2^{10} \\cdot 17^2} = 2^5 \\cdot 17 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is not a rational number, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nTo distinguish among the remaining possibilities, we compute the resolvent cubic of $f(x)$. For a polynomial $x^4+px+q=0$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\nUsing $p=8$ and $q=14$:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nThe nature of the roots of the resolvent cubic tells us about the structure of the Galois group $G$:\n*   If $R(y)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then $G$ is $S_4$.\n*   If $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then $G$ is one of $D_4$, $C_4$, or $V_4$.\n    *   If $R(y)$ splits completely into three linear factors in $\\mathbb{Q}[y]$, $G$ is $V_4$.\n    *   If $R(y)$ has exactly one rational root, $G$ is $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\nWe test for rational roots of $R(y)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of -64.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSo $y=8$ is a rational root. This means $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and the Galois group $G$ is not $S_4$.\nTo find the other roots, we divide $R(y)$ by $(y-8)$:\n$(y^3 - 56y - 64) \\div (y-8) = y^2 + 8y + 8$.\nThe remaining roots are given by the quadratic equation $y^2 + 8y + 8 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nThese roots are irrational. Thus, the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ has exactly one rational root. This eliminates $V_4$ and confirms that the Galois group $G$ is either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguishing Between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final step is to determine whether the group is $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4). The test is as follows:\nLet $F$ be the splitting field of the resolvent cubic. In our case, the roots are $8, -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, so $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The Galois group is $D_4$ if the original polynomial $f(x)$ becomes reducible over the field $F$.\n*   The Galois group is $C_4$ if the original polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible over the field $F$.\n\nWe test if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ can be factored into two quadratics over $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A general factorization of a depressed quartic is:\n$x^4 + px + q = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$\nThis requires that $a^2$ be a root of the resolvent cubic $R(y)=0$, and that $a = \\sqrt{a^2}$ is an element of the field $F$.\n\nThe roots of our resolvent cubic are $y_1=8$, $y_2=-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $y_3=-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet's take the root $y_1 = 8$. We need to check if its square root, $\\sqrt{8}$, is in $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we can set $a = 2\\sqrt{2}$. With this value of $a$, we can find coefficients $b, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ for the factorization. Therefore, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nBecause $f(x)$ is reducible over the splitting field of its resolvent cubic, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the dihedral group $D_4$. The order of $D_4$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
