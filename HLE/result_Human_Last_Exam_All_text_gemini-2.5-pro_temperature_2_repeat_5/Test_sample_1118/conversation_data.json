    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the object Curt Querner holds in his 1933 self-portrait as a symbol of resistance.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific artwork:** The question refers to a self-portrait painted in 1933 after Curt Querner's imprisonment by the Gestapo. While Querner painted several self-portraits, the most famous one fitting this description is his \"Selbstbildnis mit Mohnblume\" (Self-Portrait with Poppy).\n\n2.  **Analyze the historical context:**\n    *   **Artist's Political Affiliation:** Curt Querner was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).\n    *   **Arrest:** In March 1933, shortly after the Nazis seized power, he was arrested by the Gestapo due to his political activities. He was imprisoned in the Hohnstein concentration camp.\n    *   **Release and Painting:** He was released after a few months. He painted this self-portrait later that year, capturing his experience and mindset after his release. His expression is gaunt, weary, but also defiant.\n\n3.  **Identify the object in his hand:** Looking at the painting \"Selbstbildnis mit Mohnblume\" (1933), Querner is clearly holding a single, bright red poppy flower between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand.\n\n4.  **Analyze the symbolism of the object as resistance:** Several layers of meaning make the poppy a powerful symbol in this context.\n    *   **The Color Red:** The most direct symbolic link is the color. Red was the color of communism and the political left, the very ideology for which Querner was persecuted. Displaying this color, even in the form of a flower, was a subtle but clear act of defiance against the Nazi regime, which had banned such political symbols.\n    *   **Contrast and Fragility:** There is a stark contrast between the delicate, fragile poppy and Querner's large, strong, working-class hand. This can be interpreted as his determination to protect his fragile ideals, beliefs, and humanity against the brutal force of the fascist state.\n    *   **Life and Hope:** A flower symbolizes life, nature, and beauty. By holding it after experiencing the dehumanizing conditions of a concentration camp, he reasserts his own life and unbroken spirit. It is a symbol of hope and survival in a time of darkness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy carefully analyzing the artist's personal history, the political climate of 1933 Germany, and the visual elements of the painting, we can conclude that the object he holds is a red poppy, which serves as a multi-layered symbol of his political convictions and silent resistance against the Nazi regime.\n\n***\n\nIn his 1933 self-portrait, painted after being released from Gestapo custody, Curt Querner holds a **red poppy** (Mohnblume).\n\n<<<a red poppy>>>"
