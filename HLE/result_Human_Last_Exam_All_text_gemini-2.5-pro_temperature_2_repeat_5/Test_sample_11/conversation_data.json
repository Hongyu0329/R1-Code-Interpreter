    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the *first statute* legislated by the *modern State of Israel* that *explicitly used the term \"good faith\"*.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **\"Modern State of Israel\":** This refers to the period after the state's establishment in 1948. We are therefore looking for a law passed by the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. This excludes laws from the preceding British Mandate or Ottoman periods, even if they were kept in force after 1948.\n    *   **\"Explicitly Introduce\":** The statute must use the specific legal term \"good faith\". In Hebrew, this term is \"תום לב\" (Tom Lev). It is not enough for the law to simply imply a similar concept; the precise phrase must be present.\n    *   **\"Statute\":** A formal written law passed by a legislative body.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Candidates:** The introduction of \"good faith\" was a hallmark of Israel's new civil legislation in the 1960s and 1970s, which moved the legal system away from its English common law roots and towards a continental civil law model. Several laws from this era are candidates.\n    *   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973:** This is the most famous statute concerning \"good faith\" as it established the principle as an overarching duty in all contracts (Sections 12 and 39). However, because of its fame, it is often mistakenly assumed to be the first.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** This major piece of legislation uses the term \"good faith\" in Section 10, which protects a person who purchased a right in land while relying in \"good faith\" on the official registry. This law predates the Contracts Law.\n    *   **Prohibition of Defamation Law, 1965:** Examining legislation from even earlier in the 1960s leads to this law. Section 15 of this statute provides a crucial defense for a person accused of defamation if they can prove they made the publication in \"good faith\".\n\n4.  **Compare the Candidates:** By comparing the dates of enactment, we can establish a clear timeline:\n    *   Prohibition of Defamation Law: **1965**\n    *   Land Law: **1969**\n    *   Contracts (General Part) Law: **1973**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The chronological order shows that the Prohibition of Defamation Law was enacted before the others. It explicitly and repeatedly uses the term \"good faith\" (תום לב) as a central element of its defenses. Therefore, it is the first statute of the modern State of Israel to introduce the concept.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **\"First\" vs. \"Most Important\":** It is crucial not to confuse the first statute to use the term with the statute that gave the term its widest and most significant application. The Contracts Law (1973) made \"good faith\" a foundational principle of Israeli private law, but the Prohibition of Defamation Law (1965) used the term years earlier in a more specific context.\n*   **\"Statute of the Modern State of Israel\":** This distinction is important because some British Mandate laws, like the Bills of Exchange Ordinance, did contain the term \"good faith\". However, these were laws adopted by Israel, not originally enacted by the Knesset. The question asks for the first original statute of the new state.\n*   **Explicit Language:** The analysis hinges on the law containing the specific Hebrew phrase \"תום לב\". Other related concepts like \"loyalty\" (נאמנות), found for instance in the Agency Law, 1965, do not count for the purposes of this question.\n\n<<<Prohibition of Defamation Law>>>"
