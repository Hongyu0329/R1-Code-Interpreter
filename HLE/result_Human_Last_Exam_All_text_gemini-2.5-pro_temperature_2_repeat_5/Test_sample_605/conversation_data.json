    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem and Definitions:**\n    *   **Calabi-Yau Link:** This refers to the manifold created by the intersection of a hypersurface defined by a polynomial equation, $f=0$, with a weighted unit sphere in a complex space $\\mathbb{C}^n$. The ambient space is $\\mathbb{C}^5$ and the link is a 7-dimensional manifold.\n    *   **Crawley-Nordström Invariant:** This is a topological invariant, denoted $\\nu(M)$, for certain 7-manifolds $M$. For a link $L(f)$ defined by a weighted homogeneous polynomial $f$, the invariant can be calculated using a specific formula, provided a condition on the weights is met.\n    *   **Weighted Homogeneous Polynomial:** A polynomial $f(z_1, ..., z_n)$ is weighted homogeneous with degree $d$ with respect to weights $(w_1, ..., w_n)$ if every monomial $c \\cdot z_1^{a_1} \\cdots z_n^{a_n}$ in $f$ satisfies the condition $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i w_i = d$.\n\n2.  **Verify the Weighted Homogeneity and Find the Degree `d`:**\n    *   The given polynomial is $f = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$.\n    *   The weights are $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n    *   Let's calculate the degree for each term:\n        *   Term 1 ($z_1^8z_3$): $8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8 \\cdot 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n        *   Term 2 ($z_1^4z_2^3z_3$): $4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4 \\cdot 22 + 3 \\cdot 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n        *   Term 3 ($z_1z_2^7$): $1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 1 \\cdot 22 + 7 \\cdot 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n        *   Term 4 ($z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$): $1 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 + 1 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n        *   Term 5 ($z_2z_3^4$): $1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 1 \\cdot 29 + 4 \\cdot 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n        *   Term 6 ($z_4^3z_5$): $3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3 \\cdot 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n        *   Term 7 ($z_5^3$): $3 \\cdot w_5 = 3 \\cdot 75 = 225$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The second term has a degree of 224, while all others have a degree of 225. This suggests a likely typographical error in the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Use the Calabi-Yau Condition:**\n    *   The problem states that the link is a \"Calabi-Yau Link\". For a hypersurface in a weighted projective space to be Calabi-Yau, its weighted degree `d` must be equal to the sum of the weights, i.e., $d = \\sum w_i$.\n    *   Let's calculate the sum of the weights:\n        $\\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   Since the sum of the weights is 225, and this matches the degree of almost every term, it is safe to conclude that the intended degree of the polynomial is $d = 225$. The Calabi-Yau condition $d = \\sum w_i$ is therefore satisfied.\n\n4.  **Check the Condition for the Invariant's Definition:**\n    *   The Crawley-Nordström invariant is defined as an integer if the second Stiefel-Whitney class of the link, $w_2(L(f))$, is zero.\n    *   This condition is equivalent to the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^n (w_i-1)$ being an even integer.\n    *   Let's check this for our weights:\n        $\\sum_{i=1}^5 (w_i - 1) = (22-1) + (29-1) + (49-1) + (50-1) + (75-1)$\n        $= 21 + 28 + 48 + 49 + 74 = 220$.\n    *   Since 220 is even, the condition is met, and the invariant is a well-defined integer.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Crawley-Nordström Invariant:**\n    *   When the condition in the previous step is met, the formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant $\\nu(L(f))$ is:\n        $\\nu(L(f)) = \\frac{1}{2} (d - \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i)$\n    *   We have already established the following values based on the problem's \"Calabi-Yau\" property:\n        *   $d = 225$\n        *   $\\sum w_i = 225$\n    *   Substituting these values into the formula:\n        $\\nu(L(f)) = \\frac{1}{2} (225 - 225) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\bf{0}$.\n\n<<<0>>>"
