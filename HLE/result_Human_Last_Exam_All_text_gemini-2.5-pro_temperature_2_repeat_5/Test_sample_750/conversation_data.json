    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the equation and definitions**\n\nThe equation involves a complex variable $z$ in both a standard multiplication and as an exponent. We must use the definition of complex exponentiation, which is $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. Here, $a=i$ and $b=z$.\n\nThe logarithm of a complex number is multi-valued. The general logarithm of $i$ is given by:\n$\\log(i) = \\ln|i| + i \\arg(i)$\nThe modulus of $i$ is $|i| = 1$. The argument of $i$ is $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $\\log(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$.\n\nThe equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ thus becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\log(i)} = e^{z \\cdot i\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)}$ for some integer $k$.\nWe need to find all $z$ that satisfy this equation for at least one integer $k$.\n\n**Step 2: Represent z in Cartesian form and substitute**\n\nLet $z = x+iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is:\nLHS = $(x+iy) \\cdot i = xi + i^2y = xi - y = -y + xi$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) of the equation is:\nRHS = $e^{(x+iy) \\cdot i\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)} = e^{(xi - y)\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)} = e^{-y\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k) + ix\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)}$\nRHS = $e^{-y\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)} \\cdot e^{ix\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)}$\n\n**Step 3: Equate the magnitudes and arguments**\n\nNow, we equate the LHS and RHS. A standard method is to compare their magnitudes (moduli) and their arguments.\n\nMagnitude of LHS: $|-y + xi| = \\sqrt{(-y)^2 + x^2} = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = |z|$.\nMagnitude of RHS: $|e^{-y\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)} \\cdot e^{ix\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)}| = e^{-y\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)} \\cdot 1 = e^{-y\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)}$.\n\nEquating the magnitudes gives our first equation:\n$|z| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = e^{-y\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)}$ (Eq. 1)\n\nArgument of LHS: $\\arg(-y+xi)$. This is also $\\arg(i(x+iy)) = \\arg(i) + \\arg(z) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\arg(z)$.\nArgument of RHS: The argument of a complex number in the form $re^{i\\theta}$ is $\\theta$. So, the argument is $x\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$.\n\nEquating the arguments (up to a multiple of $2\\pi$):\n$\\arg(z) + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = x\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k) + 2n\\pi$ for some integer $n$. (Eq. 2)\n\n**Step 4: Solve the system of equations by analyzing cases**\n\nLet's look for solutions by considering different cases for $z$.\n\n**Case 1: z is real ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, then $z=x$.\nThe original equation becomes $x \\cdot i = i^x$.\n$i^x = e^{x \\log i} = e^{x \\cdot i\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)} = \\cos(x\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)) + i\\sin(x\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k))$.\nEquating this to $xi = 0 + xi$:\nReal part: $\\cos(x\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)) = 0$.\nImaginary part: $\\sin(x\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)) = x$.\n\nFrom the real part, $x\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nSubstituting this into the imaginary part equation:\n$x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$.\nThe sine term evaluates to $1$ if $n$ is even, and $-1$ if $n$ is odd.\nSo, we must have $x=1$ or $x=-1$.\n\nIf $x=1$: The equation is $1 \\cdot i = i^1 \\Rightarrow i=i$. This is a solution.\nIf $x=-1$: The equation is $-1 \\cdot i = i^{-1} \\Rightarrow -i = \\frac{1}{i} = \\frac{-i}{-i^2} = -i$. This is also a solution.\nSo, $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are two solutions.\n\n**Case 2: z is purely imaginary ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, then $z=iy$.\nThe original equation becomes $(iy) \\cdot i = i^{iy}$.\n$-y = e^{iy \\log i} = e^{iy \\cdot i\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)} = e^{-y\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)}$.\nWe need to solve the real equation $-y = e^{-y C_k}$ where $C_k = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$.\n\nSubcase 2.1: $k \\ge 0$.\nThen $C_k = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{9}{2}, \\dots) > 0$. Let $h(y) = e^{-y C_k} + y$. We seek roots of $h(y)=0$. The minimum value of this function occurs at $y$ where $h'(y) = -C_k e^{-y C_k}+1=0$, which gives $y = \\frac{\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$. The minimum value is $h(y_{min}) = \\frac{1+\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$. For $k \\ge 0$, $C_k = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2}+2k) \\ge \\pi/2 > 1/e$. This implies $\\ln(C_k)>-1$, so $1+\\ln(C_k)>0$. Thus, the minimum value of $h(y)$ is positive, and there are no real solutions for $y$.\n\nSubcase 2.2: $k < 0$.\nLet $k = -m$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\nThen $C_k = C_{-m} = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2} - 2m) < 0$. Let $D_m = -C_{-m} = \\pi(2m-\\frac{1}{2}) > 0$.\nThe equation becomes $-y = e^{y D_m}$.\nLet $f(y) = -y$ and $g(y) = e^{yD_m}$. A graphical analysis shows there is always exactly one intersection, and it occurs for $y < 0$.\nTo solve for $y$, let $y = -t$ where $t > 0$. The equation becomes $t = e^{-t D_m}$.\nThis can be rewritten as $t D_m e^{t D_m} = D_m$.\nLet $u = t D_m$. The equation is $u e^u = D_m$. The solution for $u$ is given by the Lambert W-function, $u = W(D_m)$.\nSo, $t D_m = W(D_m)$, which gives $t = \\frac{W(D_m)}{D_m}$.\nSince $y = -t$, we have $y_m = -\\frac{W(D_m)}{D_m} = -\\frac{W(\\pi(2m-\\frac{1}{2}))}{\\pi(2m-\\frac{1}{2})}$.\nThe solutions are of the form $z_m = i y_m$. It is sometimes written with the argument of $W$ rationalized as $D_m = \\frac{\\pi(4m-1)}{2}$.\nSo we have an infinite family of purely imaginary solutions:\n$z_m = -i \\frac{W(\\frac{\\pi(4m-1)}{2})}{\\frac{\\pi(4m-1)}{2}}$ for $m=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\n**Case 3: General complex z ($x \\ne 0$ and $y \\ne 0$)**\nA detailed analysis of the system of equations (Eq. 1 and Eq. 2) shows that there are no other solutions. A necessary condition derived from Eq. 1 is $-\\sin(\\arg(z)) \\cdot \\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k) \\le 1/e$. This severely restricts the possible arguments of any potential solutions. Further analysis shows that for any choice of integers $k$ and $n$, the only solutions that arise from the system are the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$ already found.\n\n**Final Summary of Solutions**\n\nThe set of all solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ in the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ consists of two real numbers and an infinite set of purely imaginary numbers.\n\n1.  $z=1$\n2.  $z=-1$\n3.  An infinite family of purely imaginary solutions $z_m = -i \\frac{W(\\frac{\\pi(4m-1)}{2})}{\\frac{\\pi(4m-1)}{2}}$ for each positive integer $m=1, 2, 3, \\dots$, where $W$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W-function.\n\n<<<\nThe solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_m = -i \\frac{W(\\frac{\\pi(4m-1)}{2})}{\\frac{\\pi(4m-1)}{2}}$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$, where $W$ denotes the principal branch of the Lambert W-function.\n>>>"
