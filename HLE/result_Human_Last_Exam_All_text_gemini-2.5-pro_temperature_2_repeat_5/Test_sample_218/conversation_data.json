    "Answering this question requires understanding the representation theory of the symmetric group $S_n$, specifically for $n=25$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Irreducible Representations of S_n and Partitions:**\n    The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, ..., \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. For our question, $n=25$. We need to find the number of partitions of 25 for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep is strictly less than 500,000.\n\n2.  **Dimension of Irreducible Representations (Hook-Length Formula):**\n    The dimension $d_{\\lambda}$ of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is given by the hook-length formula:\n    $d_{\\lambda} = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{i,j}(\\lambda)}$\n    where the product is over all cells $(i, j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{i,j}(\\lambda)$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$. The hook length of a cell is the number of cells to its right in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus one (for the cell itself).\n\n3.  **Strategy for Finding Low-Dimension Irreps:**\n    The dimension $d_{\\lambda}$ is small when the product of hook lengths, $H_{\\lambda} = \\prod h_{i,j}$, is large. Large hook lengths occur in Young diagrams that are \"long and thin\", meaning they have a very large first row/column and very few other rows/columns. Conversely, \"boxy\" or \"square-like\" partitions tend to have small hook lengths and thus very large dimensions.\n\n    Our strategy will be to systematically check partitions with these \"thin\" shapes. We can classify them by the size of their largest part, $\\lambda_1$. Note that the dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is the same as that of its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$, i.e., $d_{\\lambda} = d_{\\lambda'}$. The conjugate $\\lambda'$ is obtained by reflecting the Young diagram of $\\lambda$ across its main diagonal. If $\\lambda$ has a large first part, its conjugate $\\lambda'$ will have a large number of parts.\n\n4.  **Systematic Enumeration of Partitions:**\n\n    We will list the partitions $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots)$ such that $\\lambda_1 \\ge 13$ (since partitions with $\\lambda_1 \\le 12$ are generally \"boxy\" and are expected to have dimensions well over 500,000). For each valid partition, we check if $d_{\\lambda} < 500,000$.\n\n    *   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 25$**: The only partition is $\\lambda=(25)$. This corresponds to the trivial representation.\n        $d_{(25)} = 1$. This is < 500,000. (1 partition)\n\n    *   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 24$**: The only partition is $\\lambda=(24,1)$. This is the standard representation (of dimension n-1).\n        $d_{(24,1)} = 24$. < 500,000. (1 partition)\n\n    *   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 23$**: Partitions are of the form $(23, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 2. Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n        - $\\lambda = (23,2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n        - $\\lambda = (23,1,1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n        Both are < 500,000. (2 partitions)\n\n    *   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 22$**: Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n        - $\\lambda = (22,3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = 2,000$.\n        - $\\lambda = (22,2,1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4,025$.\n        - $\\lambda = (22,1,1,1)$: $d_{(22,1,1,1)} = 2,024$.\n        All three are < 500,000. (3 partitions)\n\n    *   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 21$**: We check $(21, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 4. There are $p(4)=5$ such partitions.\n        - $d_{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n        - $d_{(21,3,1)} = 31,350$.\n        - $d_{(21,2,2)} = 21,000$.\n        - $d_{(21,2,1,1)} = 31,625$.\n        - $d_{(21,1,1,1,1)} = 10,626$.\n        All five are < 500,000. (5 partitions)\n\n    *   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 20$**: We check $(20, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 5. There are $p(5)=7$ such partitions. All seven have dimensions less than 500,000.\n        (e.g., $d_{(20,5)} = 40,480$, $d_{(20,3,2)}=239,250$, $d_{(20,1^5)}=42,504$) (7 partitions)\n\n    *   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 19$**: We check $(19, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 6. There are $p(6)=11$ partitions.\n        - The dimensions for sub-partitions $(4,2)$ and $(3,2,1)$ exceed 500,000. ($d_{(19,4,2)} > 600,000$).\n        - The other 9 partitions have dimensions less than 500,000. (e.g., $d_{(19,6)}=123,970$, $d_{(19,5,1)}=480,480$, $d_{(19,2^3)}=490,314$). (9 partitions)\n\n    *   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 18$**: We check $(18, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 7. There are $p(7)=15$ partitions.\n        - $\\lambda=(18,7)$: $d_{(18,7)}=303,600$.\n        - $\\lambda=(18,1^7)$: $d_{(18,1^7)}=346,104$.\n        - $\\lambda=(18,2,1^5)$: $d_{(18,2,1^5)}=333,625$.\n        - All other 12 partitions of this form have dimensions greater than 500,000. (3 partitions)\n\n    *   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 17$**: We check $(17, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 8.\n        - $d_{(17,8)} \\approx 600,875$.\n        - $d_{(17,1^8)} \\approx 735,471$.\n        All partitions of this form and with smaller $\\lambda_1$ will have dimensions greater than 500,000.\n\n5.  **Final Count of Irreps:**\n    First, sum the number of partitions found:\n    $1 (\\lambda_1=25) + 1 (\\lambda_1=24) + 2 (\\lambda_1=23) + 3 (\\lambda_1=22) + 5 (\\lambda_1=21) + 7 (\\lambda_1=20) + 9 (\\lambda_1=19) + 3 (\\lambda_1=18) = 31$ partitions.\n\n    Each of these 31 partitions corresponds to a unique irrep. We must also consider their conjugate partitions.\n    A partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate $\\lambda'$ are distinct unless $\\lambda$ is self-conjugate. The partitions we found are all \"thin\", with $\\lambda_1 > n/2 = 12.5$. Their conjugates will have a number of parts $\\lambda'_1 > 12.5$. None of the partitions in our list have more than 8 parts (the case of $(18,1^7)$). Therefore, none of these 31 partitions are self-conjugate, and none of their conjugates are in the list we generated.\n    Each of the 31 partitions has a distinct conjugate partition with the same dimension.\n    Total number of irreps = $31 \\times 2 = 62$."
