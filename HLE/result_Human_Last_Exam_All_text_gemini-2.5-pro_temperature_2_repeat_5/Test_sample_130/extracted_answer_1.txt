The edges are progressively smoothed, and they move with a velocity proportional to their local curvature (a process known as motion by mean curvature). Convex shapes shrink while concave indentations are filled in. As $t \rightarrow \infty$, this leads to the annihilation of any closed boundary, causing all edges to eventually disappear as the image converges to a constant state (either entirely black or entirely white).
