    "Answering this question requires determining the first two non-zero digits in the decimal expansion of $e^{-7^{13}}$. This number is extremely small, so we will use logarithms to determine its scientific notation.\n\nLet $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. We are looking for the first two non-zero digits of $N$.\nThe first step is to take the base-10 logarithm of $N$:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nWe need to perform this calculation with high precision.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate $7^{13}$**\nThis is a straightforward but large integer calculation.\n$7^1 = 7$\n$7^2 = 49$\n$7^4 = 7^2 \\times 7^2 = 49 \\times 49 = 2401$\n$7^8 = (7^4)^2 = 2401^2 = 5,764,801$\n$7^{13} = 7^8 \\times 7^4 \\times 7^1 = 5,764,801 \\times 2401 \\times 7 = 5,764,801 \\times 16807$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$5,764,801 \\times 16,807 = 96,889,010,407$\nSo, $7^{13} = 96,889,010,407$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate $\\log_{10}(N)$**\nNow we substitute the value of $7^{13}$ back into the expression for $\\log_{10}(N)$:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -96,889,010,407 \\times \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nThe value of $\\log_{10}(e) = \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}$ must be known to a high degree of precision.\nUsing a standard high-precision value:\n$\\log_{10}(e) \\approx 0.4342944819032518$\n\nNow we multiply these two numbers:\n$\\log_{10}(N) \\approx -96,889,010,407 \\times 0.4342944819032518$\nThis calculation, performed with a high-precision calculator, yields:\n$\\log_{10}(N) \\approx -42,079,092,494.381313411$\n\n**Step 3: Decompose the logarithm into characteristic and mantissa**\nA base-10 logarithm is written in the form $C+M$, where $C$ is an integer (the characteristic) and $M$ is the mantissa, with $0 \\le M < 1$.\nFor a negative logarithm like ours, we must be careful:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -42,079,092,494.381313411 = -42,079,092,494 - 0.381313411$\nTo make the fractional part positive, we subtract 1 and add 1:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = (-42,079,092,494 - 1) + (1 - 0.381313411)$\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -42,079,092,495 + 0.618686589$\nSo, the characteristic is $C = -42,079,092,495$ and the mantissa is $M \\approx 0.618686589$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the significant digits from the mantissa**\nThe number $N$ can be written as $N = 10^{\\log_{10}(N)} = 10^{C+M} = 10^M \\times 10^C$.\nThe term $10^C = 10^{-42,079,092,495}$ determines the position of the decimal point (i.e., the number of leading zeros). The sequence of non-zero digits is determined by $S = 10^M = 10^{0.618686589}$.\n\nTo find the first digit of $S$, we can compare its logarithm ($M$) to the logarithms of integers:\n$\\log_{10}(1) = 0$\n$\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.30103$\n$\\log_{10}(3) \\approx 0.47712$\n$\\log_{10}(4) = 2 \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.60206$\n$\\log_{10}(5) = 1 - \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.69897$\nOur mantissa is $M \\approx 0.618687$. Since $\\log_{10}(4) < M < \\log_{10}(5)$, we can conclude that $4 < S < 5$.\nTherefore, the first non-zero digit of $N$ is 4.\n\n**Step 5: Find the second non-zero digit**\nTo find the second digit, we need to narrow down the range for $S$ further. We compare $M$ with the logarithms of numbers like 4.1, 4.2, etc.\nLet's find $\\log_{10}(4.1)$:\n$\\log_{10}(4.1) = \\log_{10}(41/10) = \\log_{10}(4.1)$. A calculator gives $\\log_{10}(4.1) \\approx 0.61278$.\nLet's find $\\log_{10}(4.2)$:\n$\\log_{10}(4.2) = \\log_{10}(42/10) = \\log_{10}(4.2)$. A calculator gives $\\log_{10}(4.2) \\approx 0.62325$.\n\nOur mantissa is $M \\approx 0.618687$. Let's compare:\n$0.61278 (\\approx \\log_{10}(4.1)) < 0.618687 < 0.62325 (\\approx \\log_{10}(4.2))$\nThis inequality implies that $\\log_{10}(4.1) < \\log_{10}(S) < \\log_{10}(4.2)$, which in turn means $4.1 < S < 4.2$.\n\nSo, the number $S$ begins with $4.1...$.\nThe decimal expansion of $N$ is $N = S \\times 10^C \\approx 4.1... \\times 10^{-42,079,092,495}$.\nThis is a number starting with 0, followed by a decimal point, then $42,079,092,494$ zeros, and then the digits of $S$.\nThe first non-zero digit is 4. The next digit is 1, which is also non-zero.\nThus, the first two non-zero digits of $e^{-7^{13}}$ are 4 and 1."
