No, this approach is not valid. The primary selective pressure driving the evolution of mimicry syndromes in bees comes from vertebrate predators, most notably birds. The validity of the researcher's method hinges on whether human vision is a suitable proxy for avian vision, and it is not. Birds are tetrachromats and can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas humans are trichromats and cannot. Aposematic color patterns in insects often have UV components that are a critical part of the signal to predators. Therefore, two species that appear similar to a human may look distinctly different to a bird, and vice versa. By using human subjects, the study is measuring similarity based on a sensory system that is blind to potentially crucial aspects of the signal, meaning the resulting clusters would reflect human perception rather than the ecologically functional mimicry rings as they exist in nature.
