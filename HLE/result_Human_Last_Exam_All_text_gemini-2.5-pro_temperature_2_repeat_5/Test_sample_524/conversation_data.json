    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question \"How many homeomorphism classes are there of homogeneous planar continua?\".\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Terms\n\nFirst, let's understand the components of the question.\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. In this context, it is a closed, bounded, and connected subset of the Euclidean plane (R²).\n*   **Planar:** The continuum can be embedded in the plane (R²). The question is specifically about continua that are subsets of the plane.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism f: X → X (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) such that f(x) = y. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are asked to count the number of different types of these objects, where two objects are considered the same \"type\" if they are homeomorphic to each other.\n\nSo, the core task is to identify all the distinct (up to homeomorphism) subsets of the plane that are compact, connected, and homogeneous.\n\n### Step 2: A Systematic Classification\n\nThe classification of homogeneous planar continua is a classic, deep result in topology, established through the work of several mathematicians over many decades (including R.H. Bing, F.B. Jones, C.L. Hagopian, and J.T. Rogers, Jr.). We can arrive at the complete list by systematically dividing the possibilities based on fundamental topological properties.\n\n#### A. Degenerate vs. Non-degenerate Continua\n\nThe simplest way to start is to consider the number of points in the continuum.\n*   **Degenerate Continuum:** If the continuum consists of a single point, it is compact, connected (trivially), and homogeneous (trivially). This gives us our first homeomorphism class: **the point**.\n\n#### B. Non-degenerate Continua\n\nNow, let's consider continua with more than one point. A key topological property for continua is decomposability.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. (A subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum).\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable.\n\nLet's analyze these two cases for non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua.\n\n**Case 1: The Decomposable Case**\n\nA major theorem by F. Burton Jones (1955), later simplified by C. L. Hagopian, states that:\n*   *A homogeneous, non-degenerate, decomposable planar continuum is homeomorphic to a simple closed curve.*\nA simple closed curve is any space homeomorphic to the circle (S¹). The circle is indeed a planar continuum, and it is homogeneous (any point can be rotated to any other point).\nThis theorem tells us there is exactly one such homeomorphism class: **the simple closed curve**.\n\n**Case 2: The Indecomposable Case**\n\nNow we are left with continua that are non-degenerate, homogeneous, planar, and indecomposable. These are more \"exotic\" objects. We can further classify them by whether or not they separate the plane.\n\n**Subcase 2a: Indecomposable Continua that do NOT separate the plane.**\n\nA theorem by C.L. Hagopian (1972) addresses this situation:\n*   *A homogeneous, non-degenerate, indecomposable planar continuum that does not separate the plane is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc.*\nThe pseudo-arc is a specific, snake-like continuum known for being homogeneous and embeddable in the plane without separating it. All pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic to one another.\nThis gives us a third distinct class: **the pseudo-arc**.\n\n**Subcase 2b: Indecomposable Continua that DO separate the plane.**\n\nThe final possibility is a continuum that is non-degenerate, homogeneous, planar, indecomposable, and *does* separate the plane. This case was resolved by James T. Rogers, Jr. (1983):\n*   *A homogeneous, indecomposable planar continuum that separates the plane is homeomorphic to a circle of pseudo-arcs.*\nThis object, also known as a pseudo-circle, is constructed from pseudo-arcs in a circular arrangement. It is the only remaining possibility.\nThis gives us our fourth and final class: **the circle of pseudo-arcs**.\n\n### Step 3: Final Tally and Careful Points\n\nLet's list the homeomorphism classes we found:\n1.  **The point:** The unique degenerate case.\n2.  **The simple closed curve:** The unique decomposable, non-degenerate case.\n3.  **The pseudo-arc:** The unique indecomposable, non-degenerate, non-separating case.\n4.  **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** The unique indecomposable, non-degenerate, separating case.\n\nThese four classes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive according to the established theorems. They are topologically distinct:\n*   The point has dimension 0; the others have dimension 1.\n*   The simple closed curve is locally connected; the other three non-degenerate continua are not.\n*   The pseudo-arc does not separate the plane; the circle of pseudo-arcs does.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly four such homeomorphism classes.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the classification of homogeneous planar continua yields exactly four distinct homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
