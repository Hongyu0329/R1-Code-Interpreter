    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the space $X$ and the subset $U$\n\nThe question provides several key pieces of information:\n1.  **$X$ is a connected metric space:**\n    *   **Metric space:** This implies $X$ is a Hausdorff space and is first-countable. This is a very strong condition with many useful consequences.\n    *   **Connected:** The space cannot be written as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. This property will be crucial for relating the subset $U$ to the entire space $X$.\n\n2.  **$U$ is a dense open subset of $X$:**\n    *   **Open:** $U$ is an open set in the topology of $X$.\n    *   **Dense:** The closure of $U$ is the entire space $X$, i.e., $\\overline{U} = X$. This means that any non-empty open set in $X$ must have a non-empty intersection with $U$.\n\n3.  **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:**\n    *   This is the definition of $U$ being a 1-dimensional topological manifold (without boundary).\n    *   Since $U$ is a subset of a metric space $X$, $U$ inherits the metric and is itself a metric space.\n    *   Key properties of $\\mathbb{R}$ that are inherited locally by $U$ are, for example, local connectedness and local separability.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the core of the problem\n\nThe question asks for an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$, denoted $|X|$. In topology, common cardinalities are finite, countable ($\\aleph_0$), and the cardinality of the continuum ($c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$). A common way to bound the cardinality of a metric space is to determine if it is **separable**.\n\n**Definition:** A space is **separable** if it contains a countable dense subset.\n\n**Key Theorem:** A separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nTherefore, our strategy will be to prove that $X$ must be a separable space.\n\n### Step 3: Proving that $X$ is separable\n\nThe proof proceeds in three stages:\n1.  Prove that the subset $U$ is separable.\n2.  Show that because $U$ is a dense and separable subset of $X$, $X$ itself must be separable.\n3.  Conclude that since $X$ is a separable metric space, its cardinality is at most $c$.\n\n#### Stage 3.1: Prove that $U$ is separable\n\n*   We are given that $U$ is an open subset of $X$ and is a 1-dimensional topological manifold. As an open subset of a metric space, $U$ is itself a metric space, and therefore Hausdorff.\n*   A fundamental result in the theory of manifolds (often known as RadÃ³'s Theorem, though the result is more general) states that any Hausdorff, locally Euclidean manifold is **second-countable** (i.e., has a countable basis for its topology).\n*   For a metric space, being second-countable is equivalent to being separable.\n*   Therefore, since $U$ is a 1-manifold and a metric space, it is separable. This means there exists a countable subset $D_U \\subset U$ such that $D_U$ is dense in $U$.\n\n#### Stage 3.2: Show that $X$ is separable\n\n*   We have a countable subset $D_U \\subset U$, and we know that $D_U$ is dense in $U$. We also know that $U$ is dense in $X$. We need to show that $D_U$ is dense in $X$.\n*   Let $x$ be an arbitrary point in $X$, and let $V$ be any open neighborhood of $x$.\n*   Since $U$ is dense in $X$, its intersection with any non-empty open set is non-empty. So, $V \\cap U$ is a non-empty open set in $X$. Since $U$ is open, $V \\cap U$ is also an open set in the subspace topology of $U$.\n*   Now, since $D_U$ is dense in $U$, it must intersect every non-empty open subset of $U$. Therefore, the intersection $(V \\cap U) \\cap D_U$ is non-empty.\n*   This implies that $V \\cap D_U$ is non-empty.\n*   Since $V$ was an arbitrary open neighborhood of an arbitrary point $x \\in X$, this shows that every point of $X$ is either in $D_U$ or is a limit point of $D_U$. By definition, this means $D_U$ is dense in $X$.\n*   Since $D_U$ is a countable dense subset of $X$, the space $X$ is separable.\n\n#### Stage 3.3: Bound the cardinality of $X$\n\n*   We have now established that $X$ is a separable metric space.\n*   Let $D$ be a countable dense subset of $X$.\n*   Consider the set of all open balls with centers in $D$ and rational radii: $\\mathcal{B} = \\{B(d, r) \\mid d \\in D, r \\in \\mathbb{Q}, r > 0\\}$.\n*   The set $\\mathcal{B}$ is a countable collection of open sets (since it is indexed by $D \\times \\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$, a product of two countable sets). This collection forms a basis for the topology of $X$. So, $X$ is second-countable.\n*   Now, for each point $x \\in X$, we can associate a unique subset of this countable basis. Define a map $f: X \\to \\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{B})$ by $f(x) = \\{B \\in \\mathcal{B} \\mid x \\in B\\}$.\n*   Since $X$ is a Hausdorff space, this map is injective. If $x \\neq y$, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$. We can then find a basis element $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ containing $x$ but not $y$, which ensures that $f(x) \\neq f(y)$.\n*   Because there is an injective map from $X$ to $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{B})$, the cardinality of $X$ is at most the cardinality of $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{B})$.\n*   $|X| \\leq |\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{B})| = 2^{|\\mathcal{B}|} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = c$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion and Listing Careful Points\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Metric is essential:** The metric property guarantees that separable implies second-countable and that separable implies $|X| \\le c$. Non-metric spaces like the \"long line\" can be connected 1-manifolds but are not separable and have cardinality greater than $c$.\n2.  **Connectedness of X is essential:** While its role was subtle in the final argument, it prevents trivial counter-examples. For instance, an uncountable discrete space is a metric space where every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ (the point itself), but it is not connected and has uncountable cardinality. Connectedness is implicitly used in ensuring that the local property on $U$ can be propagated to a global property for $X$ via the denseness of $U$.\n3.  **Density of U is essential:** This property provides the bridge to transfer the separability of $U$ to the entire space $X$.\n4.  **$U$ as a 1-manifold is the key structural information:** This implies that $U$ is second-countable and hence separable, which is the starting point of the entire logical chain.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:**\nThe analysis shows that any space $X$ satisfying the given conditions must be separable. Any separable metric space has a cardinality no greater than that of the continuum, $c=2^{\\aleph_0}$. This provides an upper bound. The bound is achieved by simple examples like $X = \\mathbb{R}$ or $X = [0, 1]$ (with $U = (0,1)$), both of which satisfy the conditions and have cardinality $c$. Therefore, an upper bound exists, and it is $c$.\n\nThe final answer is that there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$, and that bound is the cardinality of the continuum, $c$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum, $c=2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
