No, it is not true. The second postulate is an independent axiom and cannot be derived from the first postulate alone. The first postulate is compatible with Galilean relativity, in which the speed of light is not constant. An additional physical assumption, such as the second postulate or the universal validity of Maxwell's equations, is required to arrive at the conclusions of special relativity.
