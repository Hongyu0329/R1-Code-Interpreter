    "This puzzle involves determining the movement of a single block, represented by the digit '2', within a grid. The grid also contains empty spaces ('0') and impassable walls ('1').\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Parse the Inputs:** The input and output strings are comma-separated rows of a grid.\n    *   '0' represents an empty space.\n    *   '1' represents a solid wall or obstacle.\n    *   '2' represents a movable block.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Movement in Example A:**\n    *   Input Grid A:\n        ```\n        0 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 2 1 1 1 1  <-- '2' is at (row=1, col=1)\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   Output Grid A:\n        ```\n        2 0 1 1 1 1  <-- '2' moved to (0,0)\n        1 0 1 1 1 1  <-- Original position (1,1) is now '0'\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   The '2' block moved from (1,1) to (0,0), which is a diagonal-up-left move into a space that was previously '0'.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Movement in Example B:**\n    *   Input Grid B:\n        ```\n        ...000000...\n        ...00001...\n        ...00211...  <-- '2' is at (row=3, col=6)\n        ...11111...\n        ```\n    *   Output Grid B:\n        ```\n        ...000000...\n        ...00021...  <-- '2' moved to (2,7)\n        ...00011...  <-- Original position (3,6) is now '0'\n        ...11111...\n        ```\n    *   The '2' block moved from (3,6) to (2,7), a diagonal-up-right move into a space that was '0'.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Movement Rules:**\n    *   **Rule 1: Movement Target:** The '2' block always moves into an adjacent (including diagonals) cell that contains a '0'. The original position of the '2' becomes a '0'.\n    *   **Rule 2: Stability:** The movement seems to be constrained by stability. The block '2' cannot move to a '0' space if that space is \"unsupported\". A space is considered \"supported\" or \"stable\" if the cell directly beneath it contains a '1' or is the bottom edge of the grid. Let's test this:\n        *   In Example A, the '2' at (1,1) has two adjacent '0's above it at (0,0) and (0,1). The move to (0,0) is stable because the cell below it, (1,0), is a '1'. The potential move to (0,1) would be unstable because the cell below it, (1,1), is the original position of the '2' and would become '0' after the move.\n        *   In Example B, the '2' at (3,6) can move to several adjacent '0's. Let's check the stability of the upward options: `(2,5)`, `(2,6)`, `(2,7)`. The move to (2,7) is stable because the cell below it, (3,7), is a '1'. The move to (2,5) is unstable as (3,5) is '0'. The move to (2,6) is unstable as (3,6) will become '0'.\n    *   **Rule 3: Priority:** When multiple stable moves are possible, there must be a priority order for choosing which direction to move in. By observing the outcomes of A and B, we can deduce the search order. The block tries to move, checking neighbors in a specific sequence, and takes the first valid (empty and stable) spot it finds. Let's test the priority order: Up, Up-Right, Right, Down-Right, Down, Down-Left, Left, Up-Left.\n        *   In Example A, the only stable move is Up-Left `(0,0)`, which is the last in the priority list, but the only valid one found.\n        *   In Example B, it checks U `(2,6)` (unstable), then UR `(2,7)` (stable). It finds this valid move and takes it without checking further. This matches the output.\n    *   This combination of Stability and Priority rules consistently explains both examples.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rules to Input_C:**\n    *   Input Grid C:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0\n        0 1 1 1 2 0  <-- '2' is at (1,4)\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   Let's check for valid moves from `(1,4)` using our rules and priority order:\n        1.  **Up (`U`):** Check `(0,4)`. It's a '0'. Is it stable? The cell below, `(1,4)`, will become '0'. So, no.\n        2.  **Up-Right (`UR`):** Check `(0,5)`. It's a '0'. Is it stable? The cell below, `(1,5)`, is also '0'. So, no.\n        3.  **Right (`R`):** Check `(1,5)`. It's a '0'. Is it stable? The cell below, `(2,5)`, is a '1'. Yes, this is a stable position.\n    *   Since we found a valid move (to the Right), we stop searching. The '2' block will move from `(1,4)` to `(1,5)`.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Output:**\n    *   The original `(1,4)` becomes '0'.\n    *   The new position `(1,5)` becomes '2'.\n    *   The resulting grid is:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0\n        0 1 1 1 0 2\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   Converting this back to the string format gives: `'000000,011102,111111'`.\n\n<<<000000,011102,111111>>>"
