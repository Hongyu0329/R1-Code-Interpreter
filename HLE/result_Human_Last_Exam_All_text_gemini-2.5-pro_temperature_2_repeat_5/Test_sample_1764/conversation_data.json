    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\n\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\nLet's break down the components:\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space $(X, d)$**:\n    *   $X$ is a finite set.\n    *   $d$ is a metric on $X$ that satisfies the strong triangle inequality (also called the ultrametric inequality): $d(x, z) \\leq \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$.\n\n*   **Banach Space $(B, ||\\cdot||)$**:\n    *   $B$ is a complete normed vector space. Standardly, the field of scalars is $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$.\n    *   The cardinality of the set $B$ is denoted by $K$. If the dimension of a real or complex Banach space is positive, its cardinality is at least continuum ($c = |\\mathbb{R}|$). If the dimension is 0, the space is just $\\{0\\}$ and its cardinality is 1.\n\n*   **Isometric Embedding**:\n    *   An isometric embedding is a function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances. This means that for all $x, y \\in X$, we have $||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y)$.\n\n*   **The Question**:\n    *   We are looking for the minimum possible value of the number of distinct isometric embeddings. This number is the cardinality of the set $\\{f: X \\to B \\mid f \\text{ is an isometric embedding}\\}$.\n    *   The phrase \"smallest possible number\" implies we can choose the space $X$ (from the class of finite ultrametric spaces) and the space $B$ (from the class of Banach spaces) to make this number as small as possible. The only constraint is that at least one such embedding must exist, otherwise the number of embeddings would be 0, and the question of a \"smallest number\" usually implies a non-zero number in such contexts. We look for the minimum positive integer value.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Analyze\n\n1.  **Existence of Embeddings**: For any finite metric space $X$ (and thus any finite ultrametric space), there always exists an isometric embedding into some Banach space. A standard example is the Kuratowski embedding into the space $L_\\infty(X)$. So, for any given $X$, we can always find a $B$ such that the number of embeddings is non-zero.\n\n2.  **Freedom in Choosing X and B**: The phrasing \"Let $X$ be a finite ultrametric space\" and \"B a Banach space\" suggests we can select a convenient $X$ and a convenient $B$ to find the minimum possible number of embeddings. We should check trivial cases.\n\n3.  **Trivial Case for X**: The simplest finite ultrametric space is a one-point space.\n    *   Let $X = \\{x_1\\}$.\n    *   The metric is necessarily $d(x_1, x_1) = 0$.\n    *   The ultrametric inequality $d(x_1, x_1) \\leq \\max(d(x_1, x_1), d(x_1, x_1))$ holds since $0 \\leq \\max(0, 0)$.\n    *   So, a one-point space is a valid choice for $X$.\n\n4.  **Trivial Case for B**: The simplest Banach space is the zero-dimensional space.\n    *   Let $B = \\{0\\}$.\n    *   This is a complete normed vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$ (or $\\mathbb{C}$). Its norm is $||0||=0$.\n    *   The cardinality of this space is $K=1$.\n\n5.  **Finding Embeddings for the Trivial Case**: Let's try to embed the one-point space $X = \\{x_1\\}$ into the zero-dimensional Banach space $B=\\{0\\}$.\n    *   An embedding is a map $f: \\{x_1\\} \\to \\{0\\}$. There is only one possible function: the one that maps $x_1$ to $0$. Let's call this map $f_0$. So, $f_0(x_1) = 0$.\n    *   We must check if $f_0$ is an isometry. The condition is $||f_0(x) - f_0(y)|| = d(x, y)$ for all $x, y \\in X$.\n    *   Since $X$ has only one point, we only need to check for $x=y=x_1$.\n    *   $||f_0(x_1) - f_0(x_1)|| = ||0 - 0|| = 0$.\n    *   $d(x_1, x_1) = 0$.\n    *   The condition $0=0$ is satisfied. Therefore, $f_0$ is an isometric embedding.\n\n6.  **Counting the Embeddings**: In the scenario above (X is a one-point space, B is the zero space), there is exactly one possible function from X to B, and this function is an isometric embedding. Therefore, the number of isometric embeddings is 1.\n\n7.  **Conclusion on the Minimum**:\n    *   We have found a valid choice of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly 1.\n    *   The number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer. Since we are seeking the smallest *possible* number (implying existence, so non-zero), no positive integer is smaller than 1.\n    *   Thus, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 1.\n\n### Step 3: Verifying for Non-Trivial Cases (Self-Correction/Deeper Analysis)\n\nWhat if $X$ is required to have more than one point (i.e., $|X| \\geq 2$)?\n*   If $|X| \\geq 2$, there exist $x, y \\in X$ with $d(x, y) = d_0 > 0$.\n*   For an isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$, we must have $||f(x) - f(y)|| = d_0 > 0$. This requires $f(x) \\neq f(y)$, so the image must have at least two points. This means $B$ cannot be the zero space $\\{0\\}$.\n*   Any non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ has cardinality $K \\geq c$ (continuum).\n*   Let $f$ be any single isometric embedding. For any vector $v \\in B$, the map $f_v$ defined by $f_v(x) = f(x) + v$ is also an isometric embedding, because $||f_v(x) - f_v(y)|| = ||(f(x)+v) - (f(y)+v)|| = ||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y)$.\n*   All these maps $f_v$ are distinct for distinct $v$. Thus, there are at least $|B| = K$ embeddings.\n*   For any non-trivial $X$, the smallest possible number of embeddings would be at least $K$. Since $K$ represents a cardinality (like $c$) and not a specific integer, this path doesn't lead to a specific numerical answer like the one seemingly requested.\n\nThe trivial case of $|X|=1$ is the only one that yields a specific integer, and it is not excluded by the problem statement. Therefore, it provides the definitive answer.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number. By choosing the simplest finite ultrametric space (a single point) and the simplest Banach space (the zero-dimensional space), we find a situation where exactly one isometric embedding exists. As a positive integer, 1 is the smallest possible value.\n\n<<<1>>>"
