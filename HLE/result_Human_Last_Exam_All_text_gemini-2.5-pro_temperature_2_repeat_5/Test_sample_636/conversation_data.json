    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix `F`.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a `2x2` state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system `A_cl = A + BF` are located at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Define Matrices and Variables**\n*   State Matrix: `A = [-1, 1; 1, 0]`\n*   Input Matrix: `B = [1, 2; 1, 0]`\n*   The state feedback gain `F` is a `2x2` matrix, since there are 2 states and 2 inputs. Let `F = [f11, f12; f21, f22]`.\n\n**Careful Point:** Since this is a multi-input system (B has 2 columns), the solution for F is generally not unique. We will need to find one possible solution.\n\n**3. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial. If the desired eigenvalues are `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`, the desired characteristic polynomial `P_d(s)` is:\n`P_d(s) = (s - p1)(s - p2) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`P_d(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\n`P_d(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`P_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n`P_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\n\n**4. Formulate the Closed-Loop System's Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe closed-loop system matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`.\n*   First, calculate the product `BF`:\n    `BF = [1, 2; 1, 0] * [f11, f12; f21, f22] = [1*f11 + 2*f21, 1*f12 + 2*f22; 1*f11, 1*f12] = [f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22; f11, f12]`\n*   Next, calculate `A_cl = A + BF`:\n    `A_cl = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22; f11, f12]`\n    `A_cl = [-1 + f11 + 2*f21, 1 + f12 + 2*f22; 1 + f11, f12]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl`, `P_c(s)`, is `det(sI - A_cl)`. For a `2x2` matrix, this can be expressed as `s^2 - trace(A_cl)s + det(A_cl)`.\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f11 + 2*f21) + f12 = f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f11 + 2*f21)(f12) - (1 + f12 + 2*f22)(1 + f11)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f12 + f11*f12 + 2*f21*f12 - (1 + f11 + f12 + f11*f12 + 2*f22 + 2*f11*f22)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -1 - f11 - 2*f12 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f22 - 2*f11*f22`\n\nSo, the closed-loop characteristic polynomial is:\n`P_c(s) = s^2 - (f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1)s + (-1 - f11 - 2*f12 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f22 - 2*f11*f22)`\n\n**5. Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\nNow, we match the coefficients of `P_c(s)` with the desired polynomial `P_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\n\n*   **Coefficient of s:**\n    `2 = -(f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1)`\n    `-2 = f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1`\n    `f11 + f12 + 2*f21 = -1`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Constant term:**\n    `2 = -1 - f11 - 2*f12 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f22 - 2*f11*f22`\n    `3 = -f11 - 2*f12 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f22 - 2*f11*f22` (Equation 2)\n\n**Careful Point:** We have two equations and four unknowns, confirming that the solution is not unique. To find one solution, we can simplify the problem by setting some of the elements of `F` to zero. Let's assume the second input is not used, which means `f21 = 0` and `f22 = 0`.\n\nThe equations now become:\n*   Equation 1: `f11 + f12 = -1`\n*   Equation 2: `3 = -f11 - 2*f12`\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns (`f11`, `f12`).\n*   Add Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n    `(f11 + f12) + (-f11 - 2*f12) = -1 + 3`\n    `-f12 = 2`\n    `f12 = -2`\n\n*   Substitute `f12 = -2` into Equation 1:\n    `f11 + (-2) = -1`\n    `f11 = 1`\n\nWe have found one possible solution: `f11 = 1`, `f12 = -2`, `f21 = 0`, `f22 = 0`.\n\n**6. Final Answer**\nThe resulting state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [1, -2; 0, 0]`\n\n**Verification (Final Check):**\n*   `A_cl = A + BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [1, 2; 1, 0][1, -2; 0, 0]`\n*   `A_cl = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [1, -2; 1, -2] = [0, -1; 2, -2]`\n*   The characteristic polynomial is `det(sI - A_cl) = det([s, 1; -2, s+2]) = s(s+2) - (1)(-2) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\n*   The roots of `s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0` are `s = [-2 ± sqrt(4-8)]/2 = -1 ± j`. The solution is correct.\n\n<<<[1, -2; 0, 0]>>>"
