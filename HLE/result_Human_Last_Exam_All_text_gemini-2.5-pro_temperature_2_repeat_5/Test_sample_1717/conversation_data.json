    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Determine the base health for a single player in Expert Mode.**\n    *   The Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Classic (Normal) Mode is 2,800.\n    *   In Expert Mode, boss health is increased. The source code multiplies the Classic Mode health by a factor of 1.3 for the Eye of Cthulhu.\n    *   Single-Player Expert Health = 2,800 * 1.3 = 3,640.\n\n2.  **Understand the standard multiplayer health scaling in Expert Mode.**\n    *   For most bosses in Expert Mode, health is increased for each additional player (beyond the first one).\n    *   The standard increase is 35% of the single-player Expert health per additional player.\n    *   Standard health increase per player = 3,640 * 0.35 = 1,274.\n    *   If this formula were used without any other limitations, the health would be `3640 + 1274 * (number of players - 1)`, which would approach infinity as the number of players approaches infinity.\n\n3.  **Identify the specific health scaling exceptions for the Eye of Cthulhu.**\n    The source code contains specific exceptions for certain bosses, including the Eye of Cthulhu, that override the standard scaling. There are two layers of caps.\n    *   **Cap on per-player health increase:** The first exception caps the amount of health added *per player*. Instead of the standard 1,274 health, the Eye of Cthulhu only gains a maximum of **1,000 health** for each additional player. The formula becomes `3640 + 1000 * (number of players - 1)`. Even with this cap, the health would still approach infinity with an infinite number of players.\n    *   **Cap on total added health:** This leads to the second, crucial exception. There is a hard-coded cap on the **total amount of health that can be added** through multiplayer scaling for the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n4.  **Find the value of the total added health cap.**\n    *   According to the game's source code, the total health added from multiplayer scaling for the Eye of Cthulhu is capped at **30,000**.\n    *   This means that no matter how many players are in the game (whether it's 31, 255, or a theoretical infinite number), the health gained from the multiplayer component cannot exceed 30,000.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final theoretical maximum health.**\n    *   The theoretical maximum health is the sum of the single-player Expert Mode health and the maximum possible health added from multiplayer scaling.\n    *   Max Health = (Single-Player Expert Health) + (Maximum Added Health Cap)\n    *   Max Health = 3,640 + 30,000\n    *   Max Health = 33,640\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Classic vs. Expert Health:** The calculation must start with the Expert Mode single-player health (3,640), not the Classic Mode health.\n*   **General vs. Specific Scaling:** One must know that the Eye of Cthulhu does not follow the general 35% health scaling rule but has its own specific, capped values.\n*   **Infinite Players vs. Capped Increase:** The key to solving the \"infinite players\" problem is realizing there's a finite cap on the total health increase. With an infinite number of players, the health scaling simply hits this absolute ceiling.\n*   **Multiple Caps:** It's important to recognize the two layers of caps: one on the per-player gain (1,000) and a final one on the total accumulated gain (30,000). For this problem, the final cap is the deciding factor.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  Base Health (1 Player, Expert): **3,640**\n2.  Maximum Health Increase from Players (Infinite Players): **30,000**\n3.  Theoretical Maximum Health: 3,640 + 30,000 = **33,640**\n\n<<<33640>>>"
