    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are asked to find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence.\n*   The original sequences are `x(n)` and `h(n)`, both of length 4.\n*   We are given their 4-point DFTs, `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n    *   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n    *   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   The new sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. This is an 8-point sequence.\n*   We need to find the 4-point DFT of this 8-point sequence `y(n)`.\n\n**2. Relate DFTs of Different Lengths (Time Aliasing)**\n\nWhen we compute an N-point DFT for a sequence of length M, where M > N, the time-domain sequence is aliased (wrapped around and added). The property that relates the DFTs is as follows:\n\nLet `Y(k)` be the M-point DFT of the M-point sequence `y(n)`.\nLet `Z(k)` be the N-point DFT of the same M-point sequence `y(n)`.\n\nThe relationship is `Z(k) = Y(k * (M/N))`. This means the N-point DFT is a sampled (decimated) version of the M-point DFT.\n\nIn our problem:\n*   The sequence `y(n)` has length M = 8.\n*   We want to find the 4-point DFT, so N = 4.\n*   Let `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`.\n*   Let `Z(k)` be the 4-point DFT of `y(n)`.\n\nThe relationship is `Z(k) = Y(k * (8/4)) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\nSo, we need to find `Z(0)=Y(0)`, `Z(1)=Y(2)`, `Z(2)=Y(4)`, and `Z(3)=Y(6)`.\n\n**3. Relate the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` (Time Interleaving)**\n\nThe 8-point sequence `y(n)` is constructed by interleaving the 4-point sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   The even-indexed samples of `y(n)` are `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The odd-indexed samples of `y(n)` are `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nThis structure is used in the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be calculated from the 4-point DFTs of the even and odd parts. The DFT of the even part `x(m)` is `X(k)`, and the DFT of the odd part `h(m)` is `H(k)`.\n\nThe formulas are:\n*   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n*   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\nHere, `W_N^k = e^(-j*2*pi*k/N)` is the twiddle factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Required Values of `Y(k)`**\n\nWe need `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\n\n*   **Calculate `Y(0)`:**\n    *   Use the first formula with `k=0`.\n    *   `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0)`\n    *   We know `X(0) = 1`, `H(0) = 0`, and `W_8^0 = 1`.\n    *   `Y(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculate `Y(2)`:**\n    *   Use the first formula with `k=2`.\n    *   `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)`\n    *   We know `X(2) = -1` and `H(2) = 1`.\n    *   We calculate the twiddle factor: `W_8^2 = e^(-j*2*pi*2/8) = e^(-j*pi/2) = -j`.\n    *   `Y(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **Calculate `Y(4)`:**\n    *   Use the second formula with `k=0`.\n    *   `Y(0+4) = Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0)`\n    *   `Y(4) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculate `Y(6)`:**\n    *   Use the second formula with `k=2`.\n    *   `Y(2+4) = Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2)`\n    *   `Y(6) = -1 - (-j)(1) = -1 + j`\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Answer `Z(k)`**\n\nNow we map the calculated `Y(k)` values back to `Z(k)`.\n*   `Z(0) = Y(0) = 1`\n*   `Z(1) = Y(2) = -1 - j`\n*   `Z(2) = Y(4) = 1`\n*   `Z(3) = Y(6) = -1 + j`\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is the vector `[Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)]`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe 4-point DFT for the given sequence is `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
