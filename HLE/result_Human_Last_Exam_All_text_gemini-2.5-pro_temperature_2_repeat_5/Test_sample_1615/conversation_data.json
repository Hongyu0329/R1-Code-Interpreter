    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum number of colors needed.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, denoted $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  The number of vertices is $|V(G)| = n = 12345$.\n2.  The graph $G$ is **not** a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n\nThe \"maximum number of colours that we need\" means we are looking for the highest possible value of the minimum number of colors required for a proper coloring. That is, we want to find the value of $\\max \\{ \\chi(G) \\}$, where the maximum is taken over all graphs $G$ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Properties and Recalling Key Concepts\n\n*   **Proper Vertex Coloring**: An assignment of colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n*   **Chromatic Number $\\chi(G)$**: The smallest number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of $G$.\n*   **Complete Graph $K_n$**: A graph with $n$ vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For a complete graph $K_n$, every vertex must receive a unique color, so $\\chi(K_n) = n$.\n*   **The condition \"$G$ is not a complete graph\"**: This is the crucial piece of information. If $G$ were allowed to be a complete graph, the answer would be $\\chi(K_{12345}) = 12345$. Since $G$ cannot be $K_{12345}$, we must determine the highest chromatic number a non-complete graph can have.\n\n### Step 3: Establishing an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\nLet $G$ be any graph with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete.\n1.  Since $G$ is not a complete graph, by definition, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are **not** connected by an edge.\n2.  Because $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color in a proper coloring. Let's assign color '1' to both $u$ and $v$.\n3.  Now, we need to color the remaining $n-2 = 12345 - 2 = 12343$ vertices.\n4.  In the worst-case scenario, to create a proper coloring, we might need to assign a new, unique color to each of these remaining $12343$ vertices. Let's use colors '2', '3', ..., '12344'.\n5.  This coloring scheme uses a total of $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colors. Specifically, color '1' is used for $u$ and $v$, and colors '2' through '12344' are used for the other $12343$ vertices.\n6.  This demonstrates that any non-complete graph with $n$ vertices can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors.\n7.  Therefore, for our graph $G$, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1 = 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n8.  This means the maximum possible chromatic number is no more than 12344.\n\nA key theorem that formally states this is: **A graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$.** Since $G$ is not $K_n$, we must have $\\chi(G) < n$, which implies $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n### Step 4: Showing the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nNow we need to show that it's possible for a non-complete graph on 12345 vertices to actually require 12344 colors. We can do this by constructing such a graph.\n\n1.  Consider the complete graph $K_{12345}$. As we know, $\\chi(K_{12345}) = 12345$.\n2.  Let's create a new graph, $G'$, by taking $K_{12345}$ and **removing just one edge**. Let this removed edge be between vertices $u$ and $v$.\n3.  Is this graph $G'$ a valid graph according to the problem statement?\n    *   It has 12345 vertices. (Yes)\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the edge $(u,v)$ is missing. (Yes)\n4.  Now, let's determine the chromatic number of $G'$.\n5.  Consider the set of all vertices in $G'$ except for $u$. This set has $12344$ vertices. In the graph $G'$, these $12344$ vertices are all mutually adjacent, forming a clique of size 12344 (a $K_{12344}$ subgraph).\n6.  In any proper coloring, all vertices in a clique must receive a different color. Therefore, we need at least 12344 colors to color this $K_{12344}$ subgraph.\n7.  This implies that $\\chi(G') \\ge 12344$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n*   From Step 3, we proved that for any graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number must be less than or equal to 12344.\n*   From Step 4, we constructed a specific graph $G'$ that is not complete and showed that its chromatic number is at least 12344.\n\nCombining these two facts, the maximum possible chromatic number must be exactly 12344.\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n*   Read the question carefully: \"maximum number of colours that we need\" means $\\max(\\chi(G))$ over the specified class of graphs.\n*   The condition \"not the complete graph\" is the key. A graph $G$ with $n$ vertices has $\\chi(G)=n$ if and only if $G=K_n$. So, for a non-complete graph, $\\chi(G) \\leq n-1$.\n*   To prove that $n-1$ is the maximum, you must not only show it's an upper bound but also provide an example of a graph that achieves it. The graph $K_n-e$ (a complete graph with one edge removed) is the standard example.\n*   The mention of \"maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$\" is a reference to the general context of graph coloring theorems, like Brooks' Theorem, which states $\\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G)$ for most graphs. For our constructed graph $G' = K_{12345}-e$, the maximum degree is $\\Delta(G')=12344$. Brooks' theorem gives $\\chi(G') \\le 12344$, which is consistent with our result.\n\nThe maximum number of colors needed is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
