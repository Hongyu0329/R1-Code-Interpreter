    "An \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" for the given functions is a non-standard term. Based on the function signatures and the principles of fixed point theory, we first define this concept and then derive the conditions for its existence.\n\n**Step 1: Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**\n\nGiven the functions:\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z × Y × X → Z` (assuming the second `G` in the prompt is a typo for `H`)\n\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet of elements `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Step 2: Recasting as a Standard Fixed-Point Problem**\n\nTo find conditions for the existence of such a point, we can use the framework of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. We reformulate the problem as finding a fixed point for a single operator on a product space.\n\n1.  **Define the Product Space:** Let `M = X × Y × Z`.\n2.  **Define the Operator:** Define an operator `T: M → M` by combining the functions F, G, and H:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n3.  **Equivalence:** A fixed point of `T` is a point `P = (x, y, z) ∈ M` such that `T(P) = P`. This equation, `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`, is equivalent to the system of three equations defining the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\nTherefore, the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are the conditions required by the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem for the operator `T` to have a fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Conditions from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem requires two primary conditions:\n\n**Condition 1: Completeness of the Metric Space**\n\nThe sets X, Y, and Z must be **complete metric spaces**.\n*   Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be non-empty complete metric spaces.\n*   The product space `M = X × Y × Z` is also a complete metric space when equipped with a suitable metric, such as the sum metric:\n    `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n**Condition 2: The Operator Must Be a Contraction Mapping**\n\nThe operator `T` must be a **contraction mapping** on the space `(M, d)`. This means there must exist a constant `k` (the contraction constant) with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for any two points `P₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `P₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `M`, the following inequality is satisfied:\n\n`d(T(P₁), T(P₂)) ≤ k * d(P₁, P₂)`\n\nExpanding this inequality gives the core condition on the functions F, G, and H:\n`d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`\n\n**Summary of Conditions**\nIf the two conditions above (completeness of the spaces and the joint contraction inequality) are met, the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem guarantees the existence of a **unique** FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)`.\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem and are as follows:\n\n1.  **Condition on the Spaces**: The sets X, Y, and Z must be non-empty **complete metric spaces**. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n\n2.  **Condition on the Functions (Contraction Property)**: The functions F, G, and H must collectively satisfy a joint contraction condition. This means there must exist a constant `k` such that `0 ≤ k < 1`, where for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in the product space `X × Y × Z`, the following inequality holds:\n\n    `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`\n\nIf these two conditions are met, there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)`.>>>"
