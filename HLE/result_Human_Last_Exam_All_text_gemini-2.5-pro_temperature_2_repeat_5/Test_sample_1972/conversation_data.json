    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the title of a novel based on two specific descriptions provided by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges.\n    *   **Description 1 (of the novel):** \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   **Description 2 (of the author):** \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Author:** The second description points to the author of the novel. We need to find which author Borges characterized as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\" Jorge Luis Borges was known for writing numerous prologues and reviews for the books of his friends and writers he admired. His closest friend and frequent collaborator was Adolfo Bioy Casares. Borges held Bioy Casares's prose in very high regard, often contrasting its clarity and classical structure with the more labyrinthine styles of other modernists, including William Faulkner, whom Bioy Casares also admired. Researching Borges's writings on Bioy Casares confirms that he did indeed describe him this way, seeing him as someone who took inspiration from Faulkner's narrative innovations but refined them into a more direct and less convoluted style.\n\n3.  **Identify the Novel:** The first description refers to the specific work by this author. We need to locate where Borges used the phrase \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" This quote is found in the prologue that Jorge Luis Borges wrote for Adolfo Bioy Casares's 1954 novel, *El sueño de los héroes* (translated into English as *The Dream of Heroes*).\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Verify:** Both pieces of evidence point to the same work. Borges wrote a prologue for his friend Adolfo Bioy Casares's novel *El sueño de los héroes*. In this single prologue, he describes the author (Bioy Casares) as a continuator and simplifier of Faulkner and describes the novel itself as possessing the intensity of a tiger and the variety of a chess duel. Therefore, both clues converge on this specific novel.\n\n**Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Source:** The source of the quotes is key. Both come from a single text: the prologue Borges wrote for the novel in question. This strengthens the certainty of the answer.\n*   **The Borges-Bioy Casares Relationship:** Understanding the close literary and personal friendship between Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares is crucial context. Borges often championed Bioy's work, and they co-authored several books under the pseudonym H. Bustos Domecq.\n*   **The \"Simplifier of Faulkner\" Comment:** This is not an insult but high praise from Borges. Borges valued precision and economy in writing. He admired Faulkner but found his style sometimes unnecessarily complex. In calling Bioy Casares a \"simplifier,\" Borges was praising his ability to achieve similar narrative depth with greater clarity and classical elegance.\n*   **Translation:** The quotes are translations from the original Spanish. The original meaning is faithfully conveyed, but it's always a good practice to be aware that nuances can exist between languages.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the author is Adolfo Bioy Casares, and the novel is the one for which Borges wrote the prologue containing both quoted descriptions.\n\nThe novel is *El sueño de los héroes* (*The Dream of Heroes*).\n\n<<<*El sueño de los héroes* (The Dream of Heroes) by Adolfo Bioy Casares.>>>"
