    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be efficiently produced.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Chemical Reaction\n\nThe synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) involves the direct reaction of Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F2) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\n`Xe(g) + 2F2(g) -> XeF4(s)`\n\nThis reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. According to Le Chatelier's principle, lower temperatures would favor the formation of the product (XeF4) from a thermodynamic standpoint. However, chemical reactions also require a certain amount of energy, known as activation energy, to start and proceed at a reasonable rate. For the reaction between Xe and F2, this activation energy is substantial.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Different Synthesis Methods\n\nThe question specifies \"using any method of synthesis,\" so we must consider the various ways XeF4 can be produced.\n\n*   **Thermal Synthesis (Heating):** This is the most common and standard method. A mixture of xenon and fluorine gases (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio to ensure an excess of fluorine) is heated in a sealed nickel container under pressure (around 6 atmospheres). The heat provides the necessary activation energy for the fluorine molecules to dissociate and react with xenon atoms.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The temperature for this method is critical. Too low, and the reaction rate is impractically slow (inefficient). Too high, and other products like Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) may form, or the XeF4 product may begin to decompose. The widely accepted optimal temperature for this process is **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds at a good rate and gives a high yield of XeF4, making it very efficient.\n\n*   **Photochemical Synthesis (UV Light):** This method uses ultraviolet (UV) light to provide the energy to break the F-F bonds in fluorine molecules, creating highly reactive fluorine radicals which then attack xenon atoms. This method can often be carried out at or below room temperature.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While this method can work at low temperatures, its efficiency in producing XeF4 specifically can be debatable. At low temperatures, the initial product is often Xenon difluoride (XeF2). Converting XeF2 to XeF4 (`XeF2 + F2 -> XeF4`) often requires additional energy (heat or more specific light wavelengths), which complicates defining it as a simple and \"efficient\" one-step process for XeF4 at very low temperatures.\n\n*   **Electric Discharge Synthesis:** Passing a high-energy electric discharge (like a microwave discharge) through the gas mixture can also initiate the reaction. The plasma created is very hot, but the reaction vessel can be kept at a very low temperature (e.g., cooled with liquid nitrogen at -196 °C) to collect the solid products.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Similar to photochemical synthesis, this method can suffer from a lack of selectivity, producing a mixture of XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6. Obtaining pure XeF4 efficiently can be challenging.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate \"Efficiency\" and Interpret the Question\n\nThe term \"efficiently\" is key. In a practical chemical context, an efficient process is one that gives a high yield of the desired product in a reasonable amount of time, without requiring overly complex or dangerous procedures.\n\n*   The thermal method at 400 °C is the textbook example of an efficient synthesis for XeF4. It is robust, well-understood, and produces gram-scale quantities of pure product.\n*   The other methods, while possible at lower temperatures, often have issues with rate, yield, or purity (selectivity) that can make them less \"efficient\" for the specific purpose of making XeF4. The need to form XeF4 from the intermediate XeF2 in these low-temperature methods suggests that there is still a kinetic barrier for the second fluorination step.\n\nTherefore, the question is most likely referencing the standard, reliable thermal synthesis. It asks for the **coldest** temperature at which this process is **still efficient**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Answer Choices\n\nLet's evaluate the given temperatures based on the thermal synthesis method:\n\n*   **A. 600 °C:** The reaction would be very fast, but this temperature is excessively high and favors the formation of XeF6, making it less efficient for producing pure XeF4.\n*   **B. 400 °C:** This is the ideal, standard temperature cited in chemistry literature for the efficient synthesis of XeF4 with high yield and good rate.\n*   **C. 200 °C:** This temperature is significantly below the typical range (300-400 °C) where the thermal reaction is known to proceed well. The reaction rate would be dramatically lower, making the process very slow and thus \"inefficient\".\n*   **D. 78 °C, E. 0 °C, F. -78 °C:** These temperatures are far too low to provide the necessary thermal activation energy. No significant reaction would occur via heating. While other methods could theoretically operate in this range, their efficiency for producing XeF4 is questionable, as discussed above.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nConsidering the available options, 400 °C is the well-established temperature for efficient production of XeF4 via its most common and reliable synthesis method. While the reaction might proceed at temperatures slightly below this, 400 °C is the option provided that represents the benchmark for an efficient process. The lower temperature options are likely too slow (200 °C) or require methods that are not necessarily efficient for producing XeF4 specifically. Therefore, 400 °C is the best answer for the coldest temperature listed at which XeF4 can still be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
