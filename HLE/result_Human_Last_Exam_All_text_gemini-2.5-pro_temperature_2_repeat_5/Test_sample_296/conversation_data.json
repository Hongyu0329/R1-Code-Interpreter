    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group ($\\Gamma$).\n\n**1. General Framework for Counting Subgroups of a Given Index**\n\nThe number of subgroups of index $n$ in a group $G$ is related to the number of homomorphisms from $G$ to the symmetric group $S_n$. Specifically, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of subgroups of index $n$ and the set of equivalence classes of transitive permutation representations of $G$ on a set of $n$ elements.\nThe number of subgroups of index $n$, denoted $s_n(G)$, can be calculated using the formula:\n$s_n(G) = \\frac{|\\text{Hom}_{\\text{trans}}(G, S_n)|}{(n-1)!}$\nwhere $|\\text{Hom}_{\\text{trans}}(G, S_n)|$ is the number of homomorphisms from $G$ to $S_n$ whose image is a transitive subgroup of $S_n$.\n\nFor our problem, $G = \\Gamma$ (the Grigorchuk group) and $n=4$. The formula becomes:\n$s_4(\\Gamma) = \\frac{|\\text{Hom}_{\\text{trans}}(\\Gamma, S_4)|}{3!} = \\frac{|\\text{Hom}_{\\text{trans}}(\\Gamma, S_4)|}{6}$\n\n**2. Identify Possible Images of Homomorphisms**\n\nWe need to find the number of homomorphisms $\\phi: \\Gamma \\to S_4$ with a transitive image. A crucial property of the Grigorchuk group is that it is a 2-group, meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2. Consequently, any homomorphic image of $\\Gamma$ must also be a 2-group.\n\nThe transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are:\n*   $C_4$: The cyclic group of order 4.\n*   $V_4$: The Klein four-group (of order 4).\n*   $D_4$: The dihedral group of order 8.\n*   $A_4$: The alternating group of order 12.\n*   $S_4$: The symmetric group of order 24.\n\nBoth $A_4$ and $S_4$ contain elements of order 3, so they cannot be images of a homomorphism from $\\Gamma$.\nThis leaves $C_4$, $V_4$, and $D_4$ as the only possible transitive images.\n\n**3. Analyze Homomorphisms to $C_4$, $V_4$, and $D_4$**\n\nTo count the homomorphisms, we use another important property of the Grigorchuk group: its abelianization is $\\Gamma_{ab} = \\Gamma / [\\Gamma, \\Gamma] \\cong (C_2)^3$.\n\n*   **Case 1: Image is $C_4$**\n    Any homomorphism from a group $G$ to an abelian group $A$ must factor through the abelianization of $G$. Thus, a homomorphism $\\phi: \\Gamma \\to C_4$ induces a homomorphism $\\bar{\\phi}: \\Gamma_{ab} \\to C_4$.\n    We have $\\Gamma_{ab} \\cong (C_2)^3$. Every non-identity element in $(C_2)^3$ has order 2. In contrast, $C_4$ has an element of order 4. A surjective homomorphism cannot map a group of exponent 2 to a group of exponent 4. Therefore, no surjective homomorphism from $\\Gamma$ to $C_4$ can exist. $|\\text{Epi}(\\Gamma, C_4)| = 0$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Image is $V_4$**\n    The Klein four-group $V_4$ is abelian and isomorphic to $(C_2)^2$. Any homomorphism $\\phi: \\Gamma \\to V_4$ factors through $\\Gamma_{ab}$. Thus, the number of surjective homomorphisms from $\\Gamma$ to $V_4$ is equal to the number of surjective homomorphisms from $(C_2)^3$ to $(C_2)^2$.\n    Let's calculate $|\\text{Epi}((C_2)^3, (C_2)^2)|$.\n    - The total number of homomorphisms (linear maps between vector spaces over $\\mathbb{F}_2$) from a 3D space to a 2D space is $(2^2)^3 = 4^3 = 64$.\n    - A homomorphism is not surjective if its image is a proper subgroup of $(C_2)^2$. The proper subgroups are the trivial group $\\{e\\}$ and three distinct subgroups of order 2 ($C_2$).\n    - There is 1 homomorphism with the trivial image.\n    - For each of the 3 subgroups isomorphic to $C_2$, the number of surjective homomorphisms from $(C_2)^3$ onto it is $2^3 - 1 = 7$. So, there are $3 \\times 7 = 21$ homomorphisms whose image has order 2.\n    - The number of non-surjective homomorphisms is $1 + 21 = 22$.\n    - Therefore, the number of surjective homomorphisms is $64 - 22 = 42$.\n    $|\\text{Epi}(\\Gamma, V_4)| = 42$.\n\n*   **Case 3: Image is $D_4$**\n    $D_4$ is not abelian. Its abelianization is $(D_4)_{ab} \\cong D_4/[D_4,D_4] \\cong V_4 \\cong (C_2)^2$. A surjective homomorphism $\\phi: \\Gamma \\to D_4$ induces a surjective homomorphism $\\bar{\\phi}: \\Gamma_{ab} \\to (D_4)_{ab}$.\n    A known, non-trivial result for the Grigorchuk group is that for any finite 2-group $F$, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the epimorphisms from $\\Gamma$ to $F$ and the epimorphisms from $\\Gamma_{ab}$ to $F_{ab}$. While the proof of this fact is deep, we can use it here.\n    Therefore, $|\\text{Epi}(\\Gamma, D_4)| = |\\text{Epi}(\\Gamma_{ab}, (D_4)_{ab})| = |\\text{Epi}((C_2)^3, (C_2)^2)| = 42$.\n\n**4. Summing the Homomorphisms**\n\nTo find the total number of transitive homomorphisms from $\\Gamma$ to $S_4$, we sum the numbers of epimorphisms to each of its possible transitive subgroups in $S_4$.\n*   There is exactly one subgroup in $S_4$ isomorphic to $V_4$ that is transitive. This subgroup, $\\{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)\\}$, is normal in $S_4$.\n*   There are three distinct (but conjugate) transitive subgroups in $S_4$ isomorphic to $D_4$. These correspond to the symmetry groups of the three possible labelings of a square with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nSo, the total number of transitive homomorphisms is:\n$|\\text{Hom}_{\\text{trans}}(\\Gamma, S_4)| = (1 \\times |\\text{Epi}(\\Gamma, V_4)|) + (3 \\times |\\text{Epi}(\\Gamma, D_4)|)$\n$|\\text{Hom}_{\\text{trans}}(\\Gamma, S_4)| = (1 \\times 42) + (3 \\times 42) = 4 \\times 42 = 168$.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we can use the formula from Step 1:\n$s_4(\\Gamma) = \\frac{|\\text{Hom}_{\\text{trans}}(\\Gamma, S_4)|}{6} = \\frac{168}{6} = 28$.\n\nThe Grigorchuk group has 28 subgroups of index 4."
