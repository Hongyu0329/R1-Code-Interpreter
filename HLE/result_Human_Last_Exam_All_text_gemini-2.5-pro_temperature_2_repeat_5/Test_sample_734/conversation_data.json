    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\nThe question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian who meets several precise criteria:\n*   They must be a **Christian theologian**.\n*   They must have developed **\"specialized terminology\"**. This implies a specific, perhaps unique, set of terms or a systematic framework, not just a general discussion.\n*   This terminology must be able to **describe changes in the laws of nature**.\n*   This framework must be applicable to two distinct theological events:\n    1.  The **virgin birth of Jesus** (a specific, singular miracle).\n    2.  Potential **alterations in natural laws at the Fall** of Man (a systemic, historical shift in the functioning of the created order).\n\n**2. Initial Consideration of Major Theologians:**\n*   **Thomas Aquinas:** A major figure who wrote extensively on miracles and natural law. He famously distinguished between God's \"absolute power\" (*potentia absoluta*) and \"ordained power\" (*potentia ordinata*). While this is specialized terminology and explains miracles like the virgin birth (an act of God's absolute power), it's less commonly applied to argue that the fundamental laws of nature themselves were rewritten at the Fall. Aquinas tended to view the pre-lapsarian state as humanity possessing super-added gifts (like immortality) that were lost, rather than living under different physical laws.\n*   **Reformers (Luther, Calvin):** They emphasized God's sovereignty and ability to work miracles, but they were generally less concerned with creating a systematic philosophical vocabulary to explain the *mechanics* of how miracles relate to natural law in the way the question implies.\n*   **Early Church Fathers:** This is a promising area, as many foundational concepts about creation, miracles, and the Fall were established during this period. We need a figure who engaged in deep philosophical and theological synthesis.\n\n**3. Focusing on the Most Likely Candidate: Augustine of Hippo**\nAugustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD) stands out as the most fitting answer. His work synthesizes Christian doctrine with Neoplatonic philosophy, leading him to develop a sophisticated model of creation and divine action.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The \"Specialized Terminology\"**\n    Augustine developed the concept of **\"seminal reasons\"** (in Latin, ***rationes seminales*** or sometimes *causales rationes*). He adapted this idea from Stoic philosophy. He posited that at the moment of creation, God embedded into matter the latent potentialities or \"seeds\" for everything that would ever come to be, including things that appear in the normal course of nature and things that appear miraculously.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Application to \"Changes in the Laws of Nature\"**\n    For Augustine, the \"laws of nature\" are simply the regular, predictable unfolding of these seminal reasons. A miracle is not God violating his own laws or acting against nature (*contra naturam*). Instead, it is the activation of a seminal reason that lies outside the *usual* sequence of events. Therefore, a miracle is not against nature, but merely against *our experience* of nature (*contra quam est nota natura*). This framework provides a language for discussing changes in nature's operation.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Application to the Virgin Birth**\n    The virgin birth fits perfectly into this model. It is an extraordinary event, but not a violation of the created order. In Augustine's view, God had placed a seminal reason for a virgin birth into creation from the very beginning. When the time came, this latent potential was activated by the will of God. It was an unfolding of a pre-written, higher-order potentiality within nature.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Application to the Fall**\n    This is the crucial criterion that solidifies Augustine as the answer. He extensively argued that death was not \"natural\" for humanity in their original state but was a penalty for sin. His framework of seminal reasons can account for this systemic shift. The pre-Fall world operated according to a set of principles where the seminal reasons for decay and mortality (at least for humanity) were not active. The act of the Fall triggered a change in the created order, activating the seminal reasons for death, disease, and \"thorns and thistles\" (i.e., a less-than-perfect natural environment). This constitutes an \"alteration in the laws of nature\" as they pertain to humanity and its relationship with creation, all explained by the same theological system.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nAugustine of Hippo is the theologian who developed the specific terminology of **rationes seminales** (seminal reasons) to explain divine action within the created order. This single, cohesive framework is uniquely capable of accounting for both singular miracles that seem to bypass normal natural processes (like the virgin birth) and for a systemic alteration in the functioning of nature as a consequence of a historical event (the Fall).\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
