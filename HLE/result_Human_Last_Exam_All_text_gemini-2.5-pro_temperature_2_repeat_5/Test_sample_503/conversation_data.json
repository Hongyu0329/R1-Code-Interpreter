    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category between two objects consists of a pair of 1-morphisms (a left adjoint and a right adjoint) and two 2-morphisms (the unit and counit) satisfying certain properties. We will analyze what this means in the specific context of the simplex category $\\Delta$ viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms:**\n    *   **The Simplex Category, $\\Delta$**: The objects are the finite ordinals, denoted by $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for integers $n \\ge 0$. The morphisms are order-preserving maps, i.e., functions $f: [m] \\to [n]$ such that if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n    *   **Locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$**: This tells us how to define 2-morphisms. The category of posets, $\\mathsf{Pos}$, can be made into a 2-category by defining a 2-morphism between two parallel maps $f, g: P \\to Q$ to be the relation $f \\le g$, which holds if and only if $f(x) \\le g(x)$ for all $x \\in P$. This is the pointwise order. Since this is a poset relation, there is at most one 2-morphism between any two 1-morphisms, hence \"locally posetal\". $\\Delta$ inherits this structure.\n    *   **Internal Adjunction from [23] to [37]**: We are looking for an adjunction where the \"from\" object is $X=[23]$ and the \"to\" object is $Y=[37]$. This involves:\n        *   A left adjoint 1-morphism, $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n        *   A right adjoint 1-morphism, $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n        *   A unit 2-morphism, $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\to R \\circ L$.\n        *   A counit 2-morphism, $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$.\n        The existence of the 2-morphisms $\\eta$ and $\\epsilon$ translates to the inequalities:\n        *   $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$ for all $i \\in [23]$, i.e., $i \\le R(L(i))$.\n        *   $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$, i.e., $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n        This pair of inequalities is equivalent to the more common definition of an adjunction between posets: for all $x \\in [23], y \\in [37]$, $L(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le R(y)$.\n\n2.  **Characterize the Adjoint Maps:**\n    The problem of counting adjunctions is now reduced to counting the number of pairs of order-preserving maps $(L, R)$ satisfying this condition. This condition defines a one-to-one correspondence between left adjoints and right adjoints. We can therefore count one of them.\n    *   **Counting Right Adjoints (R):** A map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all existing infima (meets). Since $[37]$ is a complete lattice, all infima exist.\n        *   For a map between two linear orders, preserving non-empty infima is equivalent to being order-preserving.\n        *   To preserve all infima, the map must also preserve the infimum of the empty set, which is the top element of the poset. Thus, $R$ must map the top element of $[37]$ to the top element of $[23]$.\n        *   So, a map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $R(37) = 23$.\n\n3.  **Count the number of such R maps:**\n    We need to count the number of order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ satisfying $R(37)=23$. Such a map is a sequence of values $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(37)$ such that $0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(37) \\le 23$.\n    Given the condition $R(37)=23$, the problem reduces to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(36)$ where each element is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n    This is a classic stars-and-bars problem. We are choosing $k=37$ items (the values of $R(0)$ through $R(36)$) from a set of $n=24$ possible values (the integers from 0 to 23), with replacement, and order does not matter (as the sequence must be non-decreasing).\n    The number of ways is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n    $$ \\binom{k+n-1}{k} = \\binom{37+24-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\n\n4.  **Alternative method: Counting Left Adjoints (L):**\n    To double-check, let's count the number of left adjoints $L: [23] \\to [37]$. A map is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all existing suprema (joins).\n    *   Similar to the case for meets, this means $L$ must be order-preserving and must preserve the supremum of the empty set, which is the bottom element.\n    *   So, a map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $L(0) = 0$.\n\n5.  **Count the number of such L maps:**\n    We need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ satisfying $L(0)=0$. Such a map is a sequence $L(0), \\dots, L(23)$ satisfying $0 \\le L(0) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n    With $L(0)=0$, we need to find the number of non-decreasing sequences $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ where each element is from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n    This is another stars-and-bars problem. We choose $k=23$ items (the values for $L(1)$ through $L(23)$) from a set of $n=38$ values (the integers from 0 to 37), with replacement.\n    The number of ways is:\n    $$ \\binom{k+n-1}{k} = \\binom{23+38-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n6.  **Final Verification:**\n    The two methods give $\\binom{60}{37}$ and $\\binom{60}{23}$. These are indeed equal, as $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, and here $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$. This consistency confirms the result.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$."
