    "Excellent question. Let's break down the linguistic history and the hypothetical alternative step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the current word, \"sister\".**\nThe modern word \"sister\" has a complex origin. It does not come purely from one source but is the result of the interaction between two very similar words from two closely related languages.\n*   **The Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word:** *sweostor*\n*   **The Norse (Old Norse) word:** *systir*\n\nBoth words descend from a common ancestor, the Proto-Germanic word **swestēr*. Because of this shared root, they were already very similar, making them easy to conflate. However, the form we use today, \"sister,\" is phonetically much closer to the Old Norse *systir* than the Old English *sweostor*. The `s-` instead of `sw-` and the `i` vowel sound strongly suggest that the Norse form eventually displaced or heavily modified the native Anglo-Saxon one, likely becoming dominant in the Danelaw (areas of Norse settlement) and then spreading.\n\n**Step 2: Remove the Norse influence.**\nThe core of the question is to imagine a timeline where the Norse invasions never happened. In this scenario, there is no Old Norse *systir* present in England to influence the language. We must, therefore, trace the evolution of the purely Anglo-Saxon word, *sweostor*, as it would have developed naturally into Modern English.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the hypothetical evolution of *sweostor*.**\nTo predict how *sweostor* would have evolved, we can look at documented forms and apply known rules of English sound change.\n\n1.  **Old English to Middle English:** The Old English word was *sweostor* (pronounced roughly 'SWEH-os-tor'). In the transition to Middle English (c. 1150-1500), this word took on several forms. Crucially, in the South and West Midlands—areas with the *least* Norse influence—the common form became **suster**. This change involves two natural phonetic shifts:\n    *   The loss of the `/w/` sound after an initial `/s/`, a process seen in other words like \"sword\" (from OE *sweord*) and \"answer\" (from OE *andswaru*).\n    *   The simplification of the vowel group `-eo-` to `-u-`.\n\n2.  **Middle English to Modern English:** Our starting point for the final evolution is the Middle English word **suster** (pronounced roughly 'SUUS-ter' with a 'u' as in 'put'). We need to see how the Great Vowel Shift (c. 1400-1700) and subsequent changes would have affected it. The key is the vowel sound /ʊ/ (the short 'u' in 'put' or 'book'). In English, this sound largely evolved into the /ʌ/ sound we hear in words like \"cut,\" \"run,\" \"sun,\" and \"but.\"\n    *   Middle English *sunne* -> Modern English *sun*\n    *   Middle English *butere* -> Modern English *butter*\n    *   Following this exact pattern, Middle English *suster* would have evolved into a word pronounced /ˈsʌstər/.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the modern spelling and pronunciation.**\nThe pronunciation /ˈsʌstər/ would almost certainly be spelled **suster**. It would rhyme with the word \"duster\" or \"buster.\"\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Acknowledge the Mixed Origin:** It's crucial to understand that our real-world \"sister\" isn't a pure Anglo-Saxon word but a hybrid heavily influenced by Norse.\n2.  **Isolate the Native Form:** The correct starting point for the counterfactual is the Old English *sweostor*.\n3.  **Use Historical Evidence:** Instead of pure speculation, we rely on the documented Middle English form *suster*, which was prevalent in non-Norse areas, making it the most likely candidate for what would have become standard English in this alternate timeline.\n4.  **Apply Consistent Sound Laws:** The transformation from Middle English *suster* to Modern English \"suster\" is not a guess; it follows the most common and regular sound change for that specific vowel (/ʊ/ -> /ʌ/).\n5.  **Avoid Confusing Cognates:** While German *Schwester* and Dutch *zuster* are interesting parallels, English has its own distinct path of sound evolution. The internal evidence from Middle English is the strongest guide.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nWithout the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the native Old English *sweostor* would have developed according to English's internal sound laws. Historical evidence shows it became *suster* in Middle English. Applying the standard vowel shift that turned the vowel in \"cup\" and \"sun,\" the word would have become \"suster.\"\n\n<<<suster>>>"
