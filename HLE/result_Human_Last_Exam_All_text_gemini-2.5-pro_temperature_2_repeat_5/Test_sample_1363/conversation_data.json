    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific dance from a list of five Standard Ballroom dances. The key condition is that in this dance, it is *impossible* to *overturn* a *reverse turn* without *disregarding the technique*.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A standard dance figure where the couple rotates to their left (counter-clockwise).\n    *   **Overturn:** To rotate more than the amount prescribed by the standard syllabus technique for a given figure. For example, if a turn is meant to be 3/4 of a circle, overturning would mean turning a full circle or more.\n    *   **Technique:** This refers to the fundamental principles and mechanics of a dance, including footwork, timing, rise and fall, sway, body contact, and character. To \"disregard the technique\" means to perform an action that violates these core principles.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Dance Option Based on its Technique:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This is a fast, rotational dance. The basic Reverse Turn is done continuously down the line of dance, typically making one full rotation over six steps (two bars of music). While the constant momentum and pattern make it very difficult and impractical to overturn a single turn without disrupting the flow, the underlying technique is one of continuous swing and rotation. It is choreographically possible to add more rotation, even if it creates a different, non-syllabus figure. The *potential* for extra rotation exists within its swinging technique.\n\n    *   **B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot:** These are both \"swing\" dances characterized by smooth, continuous movement, body sway, and rise and fall. The Reverse Turn in both these dances involves a \"passing\" action with the feet on the third step. For the man, the left foot passes the right foot (or brushes towards it) as the turn continues. This continuous motion and the principles of swing and CBM (Contrary Body Movement) generate momentum that can be controlled and even increased to create an \"overturned\" variation. Overturning the Reverse Turn is a common element in advanced choreography in both Waltz and Foxtrot. It is therefore not impossible.\n\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** Like the Waltz and Foxtrot, Quickstep is a swing dance. Its technique is built on speed, momentum, and dynamic movement. Figures like spins and pivots are common. The technique not only allows but encourages the manipulation of rotational momentum. Overturning a Reverse Turn is very possible and often leads into other dynamic figures.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. Its technique is characterized by:\n        *   No rise and fall.\n        *   Staccato (sharp, clipped) actions.\n        *   No body sway.\n        *   A \"walking\" action rather than a \"swinging\" action.\n        *   A compact hold.\n\n        Let's examine the mechanics of a basic Tango Reverse Turn. The figure typically involves three steps. On the third step, the dancer's feet *close together* (e.g., the man's left foot closes to his right foot). This action of closing the feet deliberately and abruptly *stops* the rotational momentum. It acts as a brake. The figure has a distinct beginning and end. To try and rotate *further* after the feet have closed would require either pivoting on closed feet (not a characteristic Tango action for this figure) or introducing a swinging action to generate new momentum. Both of these actions would fundamentally violate the core staccato, non-swinging technique of the Tango. Therefore, the very construction of the Tango Reverse Turn makes it technically impossible to overturn without disregarding its fundamental principles.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** In the Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, the technique of swing allows momentum to be carried through the steps, making overturning possible. In the Tango, the technique of closing the feet on the third step is designed specifically to halt momentum, making an overturn technically impossible without breaking the rules of the dance style.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The word \"impossible\" is absolute. The answer must be a dance where the core technique, not just stylistic preference or difficulty, prevents the action.\n*   The distinction between swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) and walking/staccato dances (Tango) is crucial.\n*   The key technical detail is what happens with the feet on the third step of the turn: \"passing\" feet in swing dances vs. \"closing\" feet in Tango. This mechanical difference is the reason for the answer.\n*   The question concerns the *Reverse Turn* specifically, not other figures in the dance that might have different rotational properties (e.g., a Tango pivot or whisk).\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the correct answer is the European Tango.\n\n<<<C>>>"
