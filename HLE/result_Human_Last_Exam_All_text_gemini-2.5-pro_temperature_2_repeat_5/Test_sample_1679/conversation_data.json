    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Luxor Obelisks\nThe first step is to know what we are looking for. The \"Luxor Obelisks\" were a pair of ancient Egyptian obelisks carved to stand at the entrance to the Luxor Temple. Only one remains at the temple in Luxor, Egypt. Its twin was given to France in the 19th century and now stands at the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris. Therefore, a film can satisfy the query by depicting either the obelisk in Luxor, Egypt, or the obelisk in Paris, France.\n\n### Step 2: List Best Picture Winners and Scan for Relevant Settings\nWe need to examine the list of Best Picture winners in chronological order, looking for films set in either Paris or Luxor.\n\n1.  **1927/28 to 1936:** Winners from this period include *Wings*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Grand Hotel*, and *It Happened One Night*. Their settings (WWI France, Berlin, US highways) do not include the specific locations of the obelisks.\n2.  ***The Life of Emile Zola* (1937):** This film is set in Paris. While a potential candidate, it is a studio-bound dramatic film focused on courtrooms and interiors. It does not feature prominent, clear shots of Parisian landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n3.  **1938 to 1950:** This period includes winners like *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, *Casablanca*, and *All the King's Men*. None are set in Paris or Luxor.\n4.  ***An American in Paris* (1951):** This is a very strong candidate. The film is a musical love letter to the city of Paris. Its famous climactic 17-minute ballet sequence explicitly visualizes various Parisian locations. One of the main segments of this ballet is set in a stylized recreation of the Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk is prominently featured. This is a confirmed depiction.\n5.  ***Around the World in 80 Days* (1956):** This film's global journey includes a stop in Paris. As a movie famous for its lavish, on-location shooting, it includes sweeping shots of Parisian landmarks, including a clear view of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk.\n6.  ***Gigi* (1958):** Another musical set in Paris, this film also features many scenes shot on location, with the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk visible.\n\n### Step 3: Compare Candidates and Determine the First\nWe have identified three clear instances of a Luxor Obelisk appearing in a Best Picture winner:\n*   *An American in Paris* (1951)\n*   *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956)\n*   *Gigi* (1958)\n\nThe question asks for the **first** winner to do so. By comparing the release years, *An American in Paris* (1951) precedes the others.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Distinguishing Obelisks:** It's important to know there is a Luxor Obelisk in Paris. Other famous obelisks, like Cleopatra's Needle in London or the one in Vatican City, would not count.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The analysis must strictly follow the year of the Best Picture award to find the \"first\" winner.\n*   **Confirmation of On-Screen Appearance:** It is not enough for a film to be set in Paris; the obelisk must actually appear on-screen. *An American in Paris* is notable for its deliberate and artistic depiction of the landmark.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is determined by identifying the earliest film from the list of confirmed candidates. *An American in Paris* won the award for the year 1951, making it the first.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
