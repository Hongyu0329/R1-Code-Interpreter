    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of edge squares that would lack bishops.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Pieces\n\n*   **Chessboard:** A standard 8x8 grid.\n*   **Edge Squares:** These are the squares forming the outer border of the board. An 8x8 board has 8 squares on each of the 4 sides. To avoid double-counting the 4 corner squares, the total number of edge squares is (8 * 4) - 4 = 28.\n*   **Bishops:** Bishops move and attack along diagonals.\n*   **The Constraint:** No two bishops can be placed on squares where one attacks the other. A key property of bishops is that a bishop on a white square can only attack pieces on other white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack pieces on other black squares.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Problem using Square Colors\n\nBecause of the bishops' movement, we can solve the problem for the white squares and the black squares independently and then add the results.\n\n*   **Total Edge Squares:** 28\n*   **White Edge Squares:** There are 14 white squares on the edge.\n*   **Black Edge Squares:** There are 14 black squares on the edge.\n\nThe arrangement of black edge squares is symmetrical to the arrangement of white edge squares. Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the white edge squares will be the same as the maximum number for the black edge squares. We only need to solve the problem for one color.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Maximum Number of Bishops on White Edge Squares\n\nLet's find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 white edge squares. The white edge squares are located on:\n*   Files (columns) 'a' and 'h'\n*   Ranks (rows) '1' and '8'\n\nA good strategy is to place bishops along two opposite edges, for instance, on all the white squares on the first rank ('1') and the last rank ('8').\n\n*   **White squares on rank 1:** b1, d1, f1, h1 (4 squares)\n*   **White squares on rank 8:** a8, c8, e8, g8 (4 squares)\n\nThese 8 squares are all on the edge. Now, we must check if any of these bishops attack each other. Bishops on the same rank do not attack each other. We only need to check for diagonal attacks between the two ranks.\n\n*   b1 does not attack a8, c8, e8, or g8.\n*   d1 does not attack a8, c8, e8, or g8.\n*   f1 does not attack a8, c8, e8, or g8.\n*   **h1** is on the same long diagonal as **a8**. A bishop on h1 would attack a bishop on a8.\n\nSo, we have one conflicting pair: (h1, a8). From this pair, we can only place one bishop. The other 6 squares (b1, d1, f1, c8, e8, g8) do not conflict with each other or with the one chosen from the (h1, a8) pair.\n\n*   Maximum bishops from this set = 6 (non-conflicting squares) + 1 (from the conflicting pair) = **7 bishops**.\n\nLet's verify that we cannot add any more bishops to the remaining white edge squares (on files 'a' and 'h').\nA placement of 7 bishops could be {b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, g8}. Let's see if any of the remaining white edge squares are un-attacked.\n*   The square **a2** is attacked by **b1**.\n*   The square **a4** is attacked by **e8**.\n*   The square **a6** is attacked by **c8**.\n*   The square **h3** (for example) is attacked by **c8**.\nThrough careful checking, it can be confirmed that this set of 7 bishops attacks all other white edge squares. Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on white edge squares is 7.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Total and Finding the Final Answer\n\n*   **Maximum bishops on white squares:** 7\n*   **Maximum bishops on black squares:** 7 (due to symmetry)\n*   **Total maximum bishops on edge squares:** 7 + 7 = **14 bishops**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would **lack** bishops.\n\n*   **Total number of edge squares:** 28\n*   **Number of squares with bishops:** 14\n*   **Number of squares lacking bishops:** 28 - 14 = 14\n\nThus, if they succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, 14 squares would have bishops, and 14 squares would be empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
