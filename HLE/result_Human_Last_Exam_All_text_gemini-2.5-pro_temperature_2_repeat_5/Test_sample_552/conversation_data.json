    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific paper:** The question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. This is one of his four groundbreaking *Annus Mirabilis* (Miracle Year) papers. The full German title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen,\" which translates to \"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat.\"\n\n2.  **Examine the citations within the paper:** Einstein's papers from this period are famously sparse in their citations, reflecting his method of working from first principles. His paper on Brownian motion is no exception. It does not contain a long list of references as modern scientific papers do. However, it does contain explicit references to prior work that his own theory builds upon.\n\n3.  **Search for a reference to \"lectures\":** The key to the question is the word \"lectures.\" We need to find a citation within the paper that points to a work specifically identified as lectures.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the relevant citation:** Within the paper, Einstein grounds his statistical arguments in the principles of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, a field largely developed by Ludwig Boltzmann. When Einstein requires a result from statistical mechanics to proceed with his derivation, he explicitly cites a work by Boltzmann.\n\n5.  **Identify the specific work cited:** The work Einstein cited is Ludwig Boltzmann's book, **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie.\"**\n\n6.  **Translate the title:** The German title \"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\" translates directly to **\"Lectures on Gas Theory.\"** This book is a comprehensive text based on the lectures Boltzmann gave on the subject and is considered a foundational work of statistical mechanics.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Citation vs. Influence:** Einstein was influenced by many scientists, such as James Clerk Maxwell and Hendrik Lorentz. However, the question specifically asks whose work he *cited*, which means a formal reference made within the text of his paper.\n*   **The specific term \"Lectures\":** The answer hinges on finding a work whose title or description confirms it is a collection of lectures. Boltzmann's *Vorlesungen über Gastheorie* fits this perfectly, as \"Vorlesungen\" is the German word for \"Lectures.\"\n*   **Original Language:** The original paper and its citations were in German. A correct analysis requires understanding the title of the cited work in its original language.\n*   **Context of the Paper:** Einstein was using the principles of statistical mechanics, pioneered by Boltzmann, to explain a new phenomenon (Brownian motion) and provide evidence for the existence of atoms. Therefore, citing the leading authority's foundational text on the subject was a logical and necessary step.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the citations in Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion, we find a direct reference to Ludwig Boltzmann's foundational book, which is a published compilation of his lectures. Therefore, the lectures Einstein cited were those of Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
