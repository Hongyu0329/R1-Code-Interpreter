    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key identifiable clues.**\nThe question provides several specific pieces of information to identify a particular person:\n*   **Who:** A physicist.\n*   **Primary Field:** Better known for work in the microscopy field.\n*   **What was discovered:** An optical effect.\n*   **Type of Imagery:** The effect occurs in real imagery.\n*   **Equipment involved:** Concave mirrors.\n*   **Origin of discovery:** It was accidentally observed by a custodial worker who was cleaning these mirrors.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each clue to narrow down the possibilities.**\n*   **\"Concave mirrors\" and \"real imagery\":** Concave mirrors are converging mirrors that can form real images (images that can be projected onto a screen) if the object is placed outside the focal length. The optical effect must be related to this property.\n*   **\"Accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning\":** This is a very specific historical anecdote. The act of cleaning would likely involve dusting. When dust particles are suspended in the air and pass through the focal point of a large, illuminated concave mirror, they scatter the light. This makes the real image, which is normally invisible in empty air, visible as a glowing, three-dimensional \"ghost\" image floating in space.\n*   **\"Optical effect\":** The phenomenon described above, where an aerial, real image is made visible by scattered light from dust or smoke, is the \"optical effect.\" It's often referred to as \"Headley's ghost\" or sometimes the \"Cheshire Cat\" effect.\n*   **\"Physicist better known for work in the microscopy field\":** This final clue is the most crucial for identifying the specific person. We need to find the physicist associated with the \"ghost\" image discovery who also had a significant reputation in the field of microscopy.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find the answer.**\nSearching for the discovery of aerial images or \"optical ghosts\" created by concave mirrors and dust leads to the English physicist and naturalist **Henry Headley** (1826â€“1890).\n\nThe story aligns perfectly with the question's details:\n*   A cleaner in his house reported seeing a \"ghost\" while dusting near a large concave mirror that was being illuminated by sunlight.\n*   Headley investigated and realized that the \"ghost\" was a real, three-dimensional image of the window frames and sky, made visible by the suspended dust particles scattering the focused light.\n*   He demonstrated this effect at meetings of scientific societies.\n\nNow, we must verify the microscopy connection. Henry Headley was indeed a distinguished figure in the world of microscopy. He was a Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society and published several papers on the subject, particularly in petrological microscopy (the study of minerals and rocks with a microscope). He also designed and invented various pieces of microscope apparatus. Therefore, he is a physicist (or natural philosopher, in the terminology of his era) who is indeed \"better known for work in the microscopy field\" and who discovered the optical effect described.\n\nAll the careful points from the question converge on one individual.\n\n<<<Henry Headley>>>"
