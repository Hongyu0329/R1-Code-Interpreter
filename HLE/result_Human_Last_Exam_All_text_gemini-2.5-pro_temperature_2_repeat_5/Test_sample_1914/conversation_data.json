    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the basic structure of the category**\n\nLet the category be $C$, with its set of objects $\\text{Ob}(C)$ and its set of morphisms $\\text{Mor}(C)$.\n-   We are given $|\\text{Ob}(C)| = 2$. Let the objects be $A$ and $B$.\n-   We are given $|\\text{Mor}(C)| = 4$.\n\nAccording to the axioms of a category, for each object, there must be an identity morphism.\n-   $id_A: A \\to A$\n-   $id_B: B \\to B$\nThese are two distinct morphisms that must be part of the 4 total morphisms. This leaves 2 additional, non-identity morphisms. Let's call them $f$ and $g$.\n\n**Step 2: Distribute the morphisms into Hom-sets**\n\nThe set of all morphisms can be partitioned into four disjoint Hom-sets:\n-   $\\text{Hom}(A, A)$: morphisms from $A$ to $A$. Let its size be $n_{AA}$.\n-   $\\text{Hom}(A, B)$: morphisms from $A$ to $B$. Let its size be $n_{AB}$.\n-   $\\text{Hom}(B, A)$: morphisms from $B$ to $A$. Let its size be $n_{BA}$.\n-   $\\text{Hom}(B, B)$: morphisms from $B$ to $B$. Let its size be $n_{BB}$.\n\nWe know $id_A \\in \\text{Hom}(A, A)$ and $id_B \\in \\text{Hom}(B, B)$, so $n_{AA} \\ge 1$ and $n_{BB} \\ge 1$.\nThe total number of morphisms is $n_{AA} + n_{AB} + n_{BA} + n_{BB} = 4$.\n\nThe two non-identity morphisms, $f$ and $g$, must be placed into these four sets. This is equivalent to finding non-negative integer solutions to $(n_{AA}-1) + n_{AB} + n_{BA} + (n_{BB}-1) = 2$.\nThere are $\\binom{2+4-1}{4-1} = \\binom{5}{3} = 10$ possible distributions of cardinalities for the Hom-sets.\n\n**Step 3: Group the distributions by isomorphism**\n\nTwo categories are isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by relabeling objects and morphisms. If we swap the labels of objects $A$ and $B$, the distribution $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB})$ becomes $(n_{BB}, n_{BA}, n_{AB}, n_{AA})$. We can group the 10 distributions into 6 isomorphism classes based on this symmetry.\n\n1.  **(3, 0, 0, 1)** is paired with **(1, 0, 0, 3)**.\n2.  **(2, 1, 0, 1)** is paired with **(1, 0, 1, 2)**.\n3.  **(2, 0, 1, 1)** is paired with **(1, 1, 0, 2)**.\n4.  **(1, 2, 0, 1)** is paired with **(1, 0, 2, 1)**.\n5.  **(2, 0, 0, 2)** is symmetric.\n6.  **(1, 1, 1, 1)** is symmetric.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze each group for non-isomorphic categories**\n\nFor each group, we must determine how many distinct, valid category structures (i.e., satisfying composition and associativity) can be built.\n\n**Group 1: (3, 0, 0, 1)**\n-   $\\text{Hom}(A,A) = \\{id_A, f, g\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(B,B) = \\{id_B\\}$, other Hom-sets are empty.\n-   The structure is determined by the composition within $\\text{Hom}(A,A)$. This set, with composition, must form a monoid of order 3 with $id_A$ as the identity.\n-   There are exactly **5** non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 (the cyclic group $C_3$, and four others).\n-   Each of these 5 monoids defines a valid, non-isomorphic category. An isomorphism cannot swap A and B, because the size of the Hom-sets is not symmetric ($|\\text{Hom}(A,A)|=3 \\neq |\\text{Hom}(B,B)|=1$).\n-   *Total for this group: 5 categories.*\n\n**Group 2: (1, 2, 0, 1)**\n-   $\\text{Hom}(A,A) = \\{id_A\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(B,B) = \\{id_B\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(A,B) = \\{f, g\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(B,A) = \\emptyset$.\n-   No non-trivial compositions are possible (e.g., $f \\circ h$ requires target of $h$ to be $A$, and $k \\circ f$ requires source of $k$ to be $B$).\n-   The composition rules are trivial and fixed by the identity laws. Since $f$ and $g$ cannot be distinguished by any composition, there is only one structure.\n-   *Total for this group: 1 category.*\n\n**Group 3: (2, 1, 0, 1)**\n-   $\\text{Hom}(A,A) = \\{id_A, f\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(A,B)=\\{g\\}$.\n-   $\\text{Hom}(A,A)$ must be a monoid of order 2. There are 2 such non-isomorphic monoids: the group $C_2$ ($f \\circ f = id_A$) and the idempotent monoid ($f \\circ f = f$).\n-   The only possible non-trivial composition involving $g$ is $g \\circ f : A \\to B$. As $\\text{Hom}(A,B) = \\{g\\}$, it must be that $g \\circ f = g$. This composition rule is compatible with associativity for both monoid structures on $\\text{Hom}(A,A)$.\n-   This gives 2 non-isomorphic categories.\n-   *Total for this group: 2 categories.*\n\n**Group 4: (2, 0, 1, 1)**\n-   $\\text{Hom}(A,A) = \\{id_A, f\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(B,A)=\\{g\\}$.\n-   Similar to Group 3, $\\text{Hom}(A,A)$ can have 2 monoid structures.\n-   The composition here is $f \\circ g : B \\to A$. It must be that $f \\circ g = g$. This rule is also compatible with associativity.\n-   These 2 categories are not isomorphic to those in Group 3 because an isomorphism would either have to preserve objects (impossible, different Hom-sets have non-zero cardinality) or swap them (also impossible, e.g. mapping $\\text{Hom}(A,B)$ to $\\text{Hom}(B,A)$ fails as $1 \\to 0$ and $0 \\to 1$).\n-   *Total for this group: 2 categories.*\n\n**Group 5: (2, 0, 0, 2)**\n-   $\\text{Hom}(A,A) = \\{id_A, f\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(B,B) = \\{id_B, g\\}$.\n-   Both $\\text{Hom}(A,A)$ and $\\text{Hom}(B,B)$ must be monoids of order 2.\n-   We have 2 choices for $\\text{Hom}(A,A)$ ($C_2$ or idempotent) and 2 for $\\text{Hom}(B,B)$. This gives 4 potential structures, determined by the pair of monoid types $(M_A, M_B)$.\n    1.  $(C_2, C_2)$: Swapping A and B gives the same pair.\n    2.  (Idempotent, Idempotent): Swapping A and B gives the same pair.\n    3.  $(C_2, \\text{Idempotent})$\n    4.  $(\\text{Idempotent}, C_2)$\n-   The categories from (3) and (4) are isomorphic by swapping objects A and B. So we have 3 distinct classes.\n-   *Total for this group: 3 categories.*\n\n**Group 6: (1, 1, 1, 1)**\n-   $\\text{Hom}(A,A) = \\{id_A\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(B,B) = \\{id_B\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(A,B)=\\{f\\}$, $\\text{Hom}(B,A)=\\{g\\}$.\n-   We must define the compositions $f \\circ g$ and $g \\circ f$.\n-   $g \\circ f$ has domain and codomain $A$, so it must be in $\\text{Hom}(A,A)$. The only choice is $g \\circ f = id_A$.\n-   $f \\circ g$ has domain and codomain $B$, so it must be in $\\text{Hom}(B,B)$. The only choice is $f \\circ g = id_B$.\n-   These relations satisfy associativity. They define a unique category structure where objects A and B are isomorphic.\n-   *Total for this group: 1 category.*\n\n**Step 5: Sum the results**\n\nAdding up the number of non-isomorphic categories from each group:\nTotal = 5 (from G1) + 1 (from G4) + 2 (from G2) + 2 (from G3) + 3 (from G5) + 1 (from G6)\nTotal = $5 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14$.\n\nSo, there are 14 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism."
