    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the central pixel of the line using Bresenham's algorithm.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe goal is to find the coordinates of the \"central pixel\" on the line segment from point (1, 1) to (11, 5). To do this, we must first generate all the pixels that lie on this line using Bresenham's line algorithm. Then, from this sequence of pixels, we must identify the one in the middle.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Define Initial Parameters**\n*   Start Point (x₁, y₁): (1, 1)\n*   End Point (x₂, y₂): (11, 5)\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in x and y:\n*   `dx = x₂ - x₁ = 11 - 1 = 10`\n*   `dy = y₂ - y₁ = 5 - 1 = 4`\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Bresenham's Algorithm Case**\nWe calculate the slope `m = dy / dx = 4 / 10 = 0.4`. Since `0 < m < 1`, the line has a shallow positive slope. This means for every step we take in the x-direction, we will either keep the y-coordinate the same or increment it by 1. The x-coordinate will be the \"driving axis\" and will be incremented in every step.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Initial Decision Parameter**\nThe initial decision parameter `p` helps decide whether to increment the y-coordinate.\nThe formula is: `p = 2 * dy - dx`\n*   `p₀ = (2 * 4) - 10 = 8 - 10 = -2`\n\n**Step 4: Generate the Sequence of Pixels**\nWe start at pixel (1, 1). The algorithm proceeds by incrementing `x` from 1 to 11. In each step, we use the decision parameter `p` to find the next `y`.\n\nThe rules are:\n*   If `p < 0`, the next pixel is at `(x+1, y)`, and we update `p` as `p = p + 2 * dy`.\n*   If `p >= 0`, the next pixel is at `(x+1, y+1)`, and we update `p` as `p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx`.\n\nLet's generate the pixels:\n*   **Pixel 1:** **(1, 1)** (Starting point).\n    *   Initial `p = -2`.\n\n*   **Pixel 2:** (For x = 2)\n    *   Since `p` (-2) is less than 0, we don't increment y. The pixel is **(2, 1)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = -2 + (2 * 4) = 6`.\n\n*   **Pixel 3:** (For x = 3)\n    *   Since `p` (6) is greater than or equal to 0, we increment y. The pixel is **(3, 2)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = 6 + (2 * 4) - (2 * 10) = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6`.\n\n*   **Pixel 4:** (For x = 4)\n    *   Since `p` (-6) is less than 0, we don't increment y. The pixel is **(4, 2)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = -6 + (2 * 4) = 2`.\n\n*   **Pixel 5:** (For x = 5)\n    *   Since `p` (2) is greater than or equal to 0, we increment y. The pixel is **(5, 3)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = 2 + (2 * 4) - (2 * 10) = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10`.\n\n*   **Pixel 6:** (For x = 6)\n    *   Since `p` (-10) is less than 0, we don't increment y. The pixel is **(6, 3)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = -10 + (2 * 4) = -2`.\n\n*   **Pixel 7:** (For x = 7)\n    *   Since `p` (-2) is less than 0, we don't increment y. The pixel is **(7, 3)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = -2 + (2 * 4) = 6`.\n\n*   **Pixel 8:** (For x = 8)\n    *   Since `p` (6) is greater than or equal to 0, we increment y. The pixel is **(8, 4)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = 6 + (2 * 4) - (2 * 10) = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6`.\n\n*   **Pixel 9:** (For x = 9)\n    *   Since `p` (-6) is less than 0, we don't increment y. The pixel is **(9, 4)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = -6 + (2 * 4) = 2`.\n\n*   **Pixel 10:** (For x = 10)\n    *   Since `p` (2) is greater than or equal to 0, we increment y. The pixel is **(10, 5)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = 2 + (2 * 4) - (2 * 10) = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10`.\n\n*   **Pixel 11:** (For x = 11)\n    *   Since `p` (-10) is less than 0, we don't increment y. The pixel is **(11, 5)**. This matches the endpoint.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Central Pixel**\nThe total number of pixels generated is `dx + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11`. The complete list is:\n(1,1), (2,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,3), **(6,3)**, (7,3), (8,4), (9,4), (10,5), (11,5)\n\nSince there are 11 pixels (an odd number), the central pixel is the `(11 + 1) / 2 = 6th` pixel in the sequence.\n\nCounting from the beginning of our generated list, the 6th pixel is **(6, 3)**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<< (6, 3) >>>"
