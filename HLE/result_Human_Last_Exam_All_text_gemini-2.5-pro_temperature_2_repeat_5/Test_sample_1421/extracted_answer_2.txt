The fermionic partition function $Z$ in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by:
$Z = \int \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi \, e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$
where the integral is a functional integral over all Grassmann-valued fields $\psi(\tau)$ and $\bar{\psi}(\tau)$ that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time $\tau \in [0, \beta]$:
$\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)$ and $\bar{\psi}(\beta) = -\bar{\psi}(0)$.
The Euclidean action $S_E$ is given by:
$S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left[ \bar{\psi}(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi(\tau) + H(\bar{\psi}(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right]$
with $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ and $H(\bar{\psi}, \psi)$ being the Hamiltonian function where fermion operators have been replaced by the corresponding Grassmann fields.
