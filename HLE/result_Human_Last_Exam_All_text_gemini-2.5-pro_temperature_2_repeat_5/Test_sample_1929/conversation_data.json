    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the type of reaction.**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. It is a conjugated diene.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. It is a substituted alkene and will act as a dienophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction that forms a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the regiochemistry of the reaction.**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction can produce different constitutional isomers (regioisomers) when both the diene and dienophile are unsymmetrical. In this case, the diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetric, but the dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂) is unsymmetrical because it has different substituents on the two carbons of the double bond. This means two different regioisomers are possible.\n\nThe major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is predicted by considering the interaction of the Frontier Molecular Orbitals (FMO): the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile. The reaction favors the orientation that allows for the best overlap between the atoms with the largest coefficients in these orbitals.\n\n*   **Diene (1,3-Butadiene):** The HOMO of butadiene has its largest orbital coefficients on the terminal carbons (C1 and C4).\n*   **Dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene):** We need to determine which carbon of the C=C double bond is more electrophilic. This carbon will have the largest coefficient in the LUMO. Both -CF₂ and -CCl₂ are electron-withdrawing groups. We compare their strengths:\n    *   **Inductive Effect (-I):** Fluorine is much more electronegative than chlorine. Therefore, the -CF₂ group is more strongly electron-withdrawing by induction than the -CCl₂ group.\n    *   **Resonance Effect (+R):** Both fluorine and chlorine can donate lone-pair electrons via resonance, which opposes the inductive effect. However, for halogens, the inductive effect generally dominates.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The -CF₂ group is more strongly electron-withdrawing overall. This makes the carbon atom of the CF₂ group more electron-deficient (more electrophilic) than the carbon of the CCl₂ group. Consequently, the carbon of the CF₂ group has the largest coefficient in the dienophile's LUMO.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the connectivity of the major product.**\nTo achieve the best orbital overlap, a terminal carbon of the diene's HOMO (C1 or C4) will bond with the carbon of the dienophile's LUMO that has the largest coefficient (the carbon of the CF₂ group).\n\n*   Favored bond formation: One end of butadiene (e.g., C1) bonds to the C of the -CF₂ group. The other end of the butadiene (C4) must then bond to the C of the -CCl₂ group.\n\nThis specific connectivity determines the structure of the major product.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure and name of the product.**\nThe reaction forms a cyclohexene ring.\n*   The original C2 and C3 of butadiene form the new double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   The original C1 and C4 of butadiene become -CH₂- groups adjacent to the double bond.\n*   The predicted connectivity is: The -CH₂- group from C1 of butadiene is attached to the -CF₂ group. The -CH₂- group from C4 of butadiene is attached to the -CCl₂ group.\n\nLet's name this product using IUPAC rules:\n1.  The parent structure is **cyclohexene**. The carbons of the double bond are numbered **1** and **2**.\n2.  We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants). The substituents are attached at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6. In this type of Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents from the dienophile are on adjacent carbons C4 and C5. The locant set for the substituents is {4,4,5,5}.\n3.  We apply alphabetical order to the substituent names ('chloro' before 'fluoro'). The group that comes first alphabetically should be given the lower locant number if possible.\n4.  Based on our predicted connectivity, let's assign the positions:\n    *   The -CCl₂ group is attached to the -CH₂- group from C4 of butadiene. This places the -CCl₂ group at position 4 in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The -CF₂ group is attached to the -CH₂- group from C1 of butadiene. This places the -CF₂ group at position 5 in the cyclohexene ring.\n5.  Assembling the name: The substituents are 4,4-dichloro and 5,5-difluoro. The parent is cyclohex-1-ene.\n\nThe name of the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nFinal check: The name correctly assigns the lower number (4) to the 'chloro' substituent, satisfying IUPAC rules. The structure corresponds to the major regioisomer predicted by FMO theory.\n\nThe product of the reaction is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
