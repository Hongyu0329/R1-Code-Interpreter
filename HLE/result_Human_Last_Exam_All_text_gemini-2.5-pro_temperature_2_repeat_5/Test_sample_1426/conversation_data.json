    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the correct musical work and location.**\nThe question specifies Dvořák's \"Symphony no. 2, Op. 4\". This symphony is in the key of B-flat major. We need to find the score for this symphony and look at the very end of the final movement (the 4th movement, Finale: Allegro con fuoco).\n\n**Step 2: Locate the part for the first violin.**\nWithin a full orchestral score, we must find the staff labeled \"Violino I\", which represents the first violin section.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the final measure for the first violin.**\nThe phrase \"ends... on three notes\" refers to the final chord played by the instrument. In orchestral string writing, playing multiple notes at once is common and is called a double-stop (two notes) or triple-stop (three notes). Looking at an authoritative score (like the Breitkopf & Härtel edition), the first violins play a triple-stop chord in the final measure.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the pitches of the three notes in the chord.**\nWe must read the notes on the treble clef staff, taking into account the key signature of B-flat major (which has two flats: B♭ and E♭).\n*   The **highest note** of the chord is on the middle line of the staff. This note is B, and the key signature makes it a **B♭**.\n*   The **middle note** is on the top line of the staff. This note is **F**.\n*   The **lowest note** is on the fourth line from the bottom. This note is **D**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the lowest note among the three.**\nThe three notes that comprise the final chord for the first violins are D, F, and B♭. Comparing these three pitches, D is the lowest note. (Together, they form a B-flat major triad, the home chord of the symphony).\n\nTherefore, the lowest of the three notes is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
