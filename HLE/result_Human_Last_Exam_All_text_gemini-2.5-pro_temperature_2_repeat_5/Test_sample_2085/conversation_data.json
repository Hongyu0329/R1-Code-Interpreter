    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\".\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Initial Information\nThe core task is to find the modern French equivalent of the name \"Odobeccus\".\n*   **Name:** Odobeccus\n*   **Source Language:** Presented as Gaulish.\n*   **Target Language:** French.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Name Origin**\nWhile the name is found in historical sources related to post-Roman Gaul, the individual named Odobeccus was a Frankish chieftain. The Franks were a Germanic people, not Gaulish (Celtic). Therefore, the name is almost certainly of Germanic (specifically Frankish) origin, not Gaulish. The form \"Odobeccus\" is how it was written in Latin by the chronicler Gregory of Tours. This distinction is crucial for the etymological analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Deconstruct the Name \"Odobeccus\"\nLike many ancient Germanic names, \"Odobeccus\" is a compound name made of two parts.\n*   Part 1: **Odo-**\n*   Part 2: **-beccus**\n\nThe `-us` ending is simply a standard Latin masculine nominative suffix and would be dropped in the evolution to French.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the First Element (\"Odo-\")\nThis element is very common in Germanic names.\n*   It comes from the Proto-Germanic root `*audaz`, meaning \"wealth,\" \"riches,\" or \"possession.\"\n*   This root regularly evolved into the French name element **Eude-** or **Odon-**.\n*   Familiar examples include the French names *Eudes* and *Odon*, and the German *Otto*.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Evolution of *Odo-***\nThe transformation from the Germanic *Aud(o)-* to the French *Eude-* is a standard, well-documented phonetic development.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Second Element (\"-beccus\")\nThis part is more complex and represents the main challenge.\n*   A direct translation from Gaulish would point to *beccos*, meaning \"beak,\" which gave the French word *bec*. However, \"Wealth-Beak\" is not a typical Germanic name construction.\n*   Since the name is Frankish (Germanic), we must look for a common Germanic name element that could have been rendered as \"-beccus\" by a Latin scribe.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Problem of Transcription**\nLatin chroniclers often struggled to accurately transcribe Germanic names. They would approximate the sounds using Latin letters, and scribal errors could further alter the name over time. Therefore, \"-beccus\" is very likely a corruption or a phonetic approximation of the original Frankish element.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Most Likely Original Frankish Name\nHistorians and onomastic specialists (those who study names) have concluded that \"-beccus\" is most likely a rendering of the common Germanic element **-bald**.\n*   The root `*baldaz` means \"bold\" or \"brave.\"\n*   This element is extremely common in Germanic names (e.g., Theobald, Baldwin, Archibald).\n*   While the phonetic link from *-bald* to *-beccus* is not direct, it's considered the most plausible explanation given the options. No other common Germanic suffix fits better.\n\nTherefore, the original Frankish name was likely **Audobald**. This name, meaning \"Rich and Bold,\" is a perfectly constructed and historically attested Germanic name.\n\n### Step 6: Trace the Evolution of \"Audobald\" into French\nNow, we can trace the phonetic evolution of the reconstructed original name, *Audobald*, into French.\n1.  **Aud(o)-** -> **Eude-**\n2.  **-bald** -> **-baud** or **-baut** (the 'l' softens or disappears, and the final 'd' often becomes a 't' sound or is silent).\n\nCombining these two parts gives the French equivalent.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" is a Latinized form of the Frankish (Germanic) name **Audobald**. The French form of Audobald is **Eudebaud** (with the common spelling variant *Eudebaut*).\n\n<<<Eudebaud>>>"
