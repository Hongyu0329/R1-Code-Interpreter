The Battle of Mons was on **August 23, 1914**.\n*   ***Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, Egypt***: Depicts a specific cavalry charge during the Battle of Agagia, part of the Senussi Campaign of World War I. This battle occurred on **February 26, 1916**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the dates of the battles.**\nNow, let's list the battles chronologically to find the latest one:\n1.  Battle of Quatre Bras (1815)\n2.  Battle of Waterloo (1815)\n3.  Battle of Balaclava (1854)\n4.  Battle of Inkerman (1854)\n5.  Battle of Rorke's Drift (1879)\n6.  Battle of Laing's Nek (1881)\n7.  Gordon Relief Expedition (1885)\n8.  Second Boer War (ended 1902)\n9.  Battle of Mons (1914)\n10.
