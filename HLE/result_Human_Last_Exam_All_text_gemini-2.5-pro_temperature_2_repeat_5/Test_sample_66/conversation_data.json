    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix derived from the flag of Tonga.\n\n**Step 1: Define the matrix from the flag**\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. The white canton is charged with a red couped cross.\nLet's model this as an `m x n` matrix `M` of pixels.\n- Red pixels are given the value `a`.\n- White pixels are given the value `b`.\n\nThe problem asks for the *maximal possible* rank, which means we can choose the values `a` and `b`, and the pixel resolution of the image, in a way that maximizes the rank. We assume `a` and `b` are real numbers. For the rank to be greater than 1, we must assume `a != b`. For the matrix to be non-zero, we assume `a` and `b` are not both zero.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the matrix `M`**\nThe matrix `M` can be represented as a linear combination of indicator matrices for its different colored regions. Let `M_R` be the indicator matrix for all red pixels (1 if red, 0 if white) and `M_W` be the indicator matrix for all white pixels (1 if white, 0 if red).\nSo, `M = a * M_R + b * M_W`.\n\nNote that for any pixel, it is either red or white, so `M_R + M_W = J`, where `J` is the `m x n` matrix of all ones.\nWe can rewrite `M` in terms of `J` and one of the indicator matrices, for example `M_W`:\n`M = a * (J - M_W) + b * M_W`\n`M = a * J - a * M_W + b * M_W`\n`M = a * J + (b - a) * M_W`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the rank of the decomposed matrix**\nThe rank of a sum of matrices `A+B` is related to the ranks of `A` and `B`. The column space of `A+B` is a subspace of the sum of the column spaces of `A` and `B`. `Col(A+B) ⊆ Col(A) + Col(B)`.\nThis means `rank(A+B) <= rank(A) + rank(B)`.\n\nIn our case, `A = aJ` and `B = (b-a)M_W`.\n- `rank(A) = rank(aJ) = 1` (as long as `a != 0`).\n- `rank(B) = rank((b-a)M_W) = rank(M_W)` (as long as `b != a`).\n\nThe rank of `M` is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its columns. This space is `Col(aJ + (b-a)M_W)`. This is a subspace of `Col(aJ) + Col((b-a)M_W)`. The dimension of this sum of spaces is given by `dim(Col(A) + Col(B)) = rank(A) + rank(B) - dim(Col(A) ∩ Col(B))`.\nThe column space of `aJ` is spanned by the all-ones vector, `j`. So `Col(aJ) = Span(j)`.\nThe key question is whether `j` is in the column space of `M_W`.\n\nLet the canton be of size `p x q`. `M_W` is the indicator matrix for the white pixels. The white pixels only exist within the canton. Therefore, `M_W` is a matrix that has non-zero values only in its top-left `p x q` block.\nAny column of `M_W` will have all its entries from row `p+1` to `m` equal to zero.\nThe vector `j` has ones in all its entries.\nTherefore, `j` cannot be a linear combination of the columns of `M_W` (unless the flag consists only of the canton, i.e., `m=p`, which is not the case for the Tongan flag).\nSo, `Col(aJ) ∩ Col((b-a)M_W) = {0}`.\n\nThe space spanned by the columns of `M` is `Col(M_W) + Span(j)`. Because the intersection is trivial, the dimension of this space is the sum of the dimensions of the two spaces.\nTherefore, `rank(M) = rank(M_W) + rank(aJ) = rank(M_W) + 1`.\nThis holds as long as `a != 0` and `a != b`, which we can choose to be the case to maximize the rank.\n\n**Step 4: Find the maximal rank of `M_W`**\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the maximal possible rank of `M_W`.\n`M_W` is non-zero only in the `p x q` canton submatrix. Let's call this submatrix `C_W`. The rank of `M_W` is equal to the rank of `C_W`.\n`C_W` is a `p x q` binary matrix, with `1` for the white background and `0` for the red cross.\nThe cross is \"couped\", which means it does not touch the edges of the canton. This implies that the border rows and columns of `C_W` consist entirely of ones.\n\nThe rank of `C_W` is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's analyze the types of rows `C_W` can have.\nA row's pattern is determined by where it slices the cross.\n1.  **Simple Greek Cross:** A simple cross made of one horizontal and one vertical rectangle.\n    *   A row outside the cross (e.g., the border) is all `1`s: `(1, 1, ..., 1)`.\n    *   A row slicing the vertical arm of the cross has a block of `0`s: `(1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)`.\n    *   A row slicing the horizontal arm of the cross has a wider block of `0`s: `(1, ..., 0, ..., 0, ..., 1)`.\n    These three row types can be shown to be linearly independent. So for a simple cross, `rank(C_W) = 3`. This gives `rank(M) = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n2.  **Cross Pattée:** The flag of Tonga is often depicted with a cross pattée, where the arms of the cross flare out. This introduces more variation in the row patterns. Let's model a canton of size `7x7`.\n    *   Row type A (border): `(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)`\n    *   Row type B (top/bottom of the flare): `(1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1)`\n    *   Row type C (next to the center): `(1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1)`\n    *   Row type D (center horizontal slice): `(1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1)`\n    We need to check if these four vectors are linearly independent.\n    Let `c_1 A + c_2 B + c_3 C + c_4 D = 0`.\n    Subtracting `c_1 A + ...` from `c_1(1,1,...)` we can work with vectors `A-B = (0,1,0,0,0,1,0)`, `A-C=(0,0,1,0,1,0,0)`, `A-D=(0,0,0,1,0,0,0)`. These three are clearly linearly independent. Since A is also linearly independent from this set, the full set {A, B, C, D} is linearly independent.\n    Therefore, with a cross pattée design, we can achieve `rank(C_W) = 4`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the maximal rank of M**\nUsing the formula `rank(M) = rank(M_W) + 1` and our finding that `max rank(M_W) = max rank(C_W) = 4`.\nMaximal rank of `M` = `4 + 1 = 5`.\n\nSince the problem asks for the maximal *possible* rank, we should consider a valid representation of the flag that yields this maximum. A cross pattée is a common and valid heraldic cross used on flags, including historical and modern depictions of the Tongan flag. There is no information that restricts the complexity of the cross to a simpler form that would yield a lower rank. Higher complexity could potentially lead to even higher ranks, but the cross pattée is sufficient to demonstrate a rank of 4 for `C_W`.\n\nFinal calculation:\n- A cross pattée shape within the canton can be designed to produce at least 4 linearly independent row types. This means `rank(C_W)` can be at least 4.\n- This leads to `rank(M_W) >= 4`.\n- For suitable choices of `a` and `b` (e.g., `a=2, b=1`), the rank of the final matrix `M` is `rank(M_W) + 1`.\n- Therefore, the maximal possible rank of `M` is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n\n<<<5>>>"
