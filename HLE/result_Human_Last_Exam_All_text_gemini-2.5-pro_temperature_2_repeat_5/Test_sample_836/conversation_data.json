    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the specified function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Function: Generalized Pair Correlation Function**\n    *   In the context of nuclear reactor physics, this function describes the probability or correlation of finding two neutrons at different space-time coordinates. It is fundamentally a measure of the statistical fluctuations in the neutron population.\n    *   This function is mathematically represented as the covariance of the neutron density, C(**r₁**, t₁; **r₂**, t₂), which measures how fluctuations at position **r₁** and time t₁ are related to fluctuations at position **r₂** and time t₂.\n    *   For stationary and homogeneous systems, this function depends only on the separation in space (Δ**r** = **r₂** - **r₁**) and time (τ = t₂ - t₁), becoming C(Δ**r**, τ).\n\n2.  **Identify the Mathematical Operation: Space-Time Double Fourier Transform**\n    *   The question specifies a double Fourier transform, one over the spatial variable and one over the temporal variable.\n    *   **Spatial Fourier Transform:** This transforms the spatial dependence from the position domain (**r**) to the wavevector domain (**k**). The wavevector **k** represents a spatial frequency or mode.\n    *   **Temporal Fourier Transform:** This transforms the time dependence from the time domain (t) to the angular frequency domain (ω). The frequency ω represents a temporal frequency.\n    *   Performing both transforms on the correlation function C(Δ**r**, τ) results in a new function, let's call it S(**k**, ω). This new function describes how the variance (or \"power\") of the neutron fluctuations is distributed across different spatial modes (**k**) and temporal frequencies (ω).\n\n3.  **Connect to Standard Terminology (Wiener-Khinchin Theorem)**\n    *   In physics and signal processing, a fundamental result known as the Wiener-Khinchin theorem states that the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function of a signal is the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** of that signal.\n    *   This concept is generalized to cross-correlations. The Fourier transform of the cross-correlation function between two signals gives the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**.\n\n4.  **Apply to the Nuclear Criticality Community Context**\n    *   The study of neutron fluctuations in a reactor is called \"reactor noise analysis\". The core quantities measured and analyzed are correlation functions and their Fourier transforms.\n    *   The temporal Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function of a single neutron detector's signal is called the Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD).\n    *   The temporal Fourier transform of the cross-correlation function between two different neutron detectors' signals is called the Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD).\n    *   The quantity described in the question—the double Fourier transform over both space and time of the generalized pair correlation function—is a more general version of these concepts. It represents the full spectrum of fluctuations in both space and time.\n\n5.  **Identify the Common Name**\n    *   This comprehensive function, S(**k**, ω), is most commonly and generally referred to by the nuclear criticality community as the **Power Spectral Density** of the neutron noise (or neutron fluctuations).\n    *   While other descriptive names like \"neutron noise power spectrum\" or \"spectral density of fluctuations\" are also used, **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** is the most standard and widely recognized term that encompasses the concept. It is the direct analogue of the term used in signal processing and is central to all frequency-domain reactor noise analysis techniques.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinction from Correlation Function:** The Power Spectral Density is the *Fourier transform* of the correlation function. The two are a Fourier pair, not the same function.\n*   **Context is Key:** While a similar mathematical entity in condensed matter physics might be called the \"dynamic structure factor,\" that term is not commonly used in the nuclear criticality community for this specific application. The question specifically asks for the term used in this community.\n*   **Generality:** The term Power Spectral Density (PSD) is general. It can refer to the Auto-PSD (when **r₁**=**r₂**), the Cross-PSD (when **r₁**≠**r₂** and only a time-transform is performed), or the full space-time transformed function S(**k**, ω) as requested in the question.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe double Fourier transform (in space and time) of the generalized pair correlation function of neutrons gives a function of wavevector **k** and frequency ω. This function quantifies the distribution of the variance of the neutron population fluctuations over spatial modes and temporal frequencies. Based on the Wiener-Khinchin theorem and the standard terminology used in the field of reactor noise analysis, this function is known as the Power Spectral Density.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density>>>"
