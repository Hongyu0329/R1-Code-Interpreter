    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the fundamental combinators**\n\nFirst, let's define the behavior of the S, K, and I combinators, which are the building blocks of this logic.\n*   **S x y z = x z (y z)**: The Substitution combinator applies `x` to `z`, `y` to `z`, and then applies the first result to the second.\n*   **K x y = x**: The Konstant combinator takes two arguments and returns the first one, discarding the second.\n*   **I x = x**: The Identity combinator takes one argument and returns it unchanged.\n\n### **Step 2: Understanding Church Numerals in SKI**\n\nA Church numeral `n` (written `c_n`) is a higher-order function that represents the number `n`. It takes a function `f` and a value `x` and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times. The general form is `c_n = λf.λx. f^n(x)`.\n\nWe can identify some simple Church numerals and operations within the expression:\n*   `c_1 = I`. Applying `I` to `f` and `x` gives `I f x = f x`, which is one application of `f`.\n*   `c_2 = S(I)(I)`. Let's verify this: `S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`, which is two applications of `f`. So, `S(I)(I)` is indeed `c_2`.\n*   **Multiplication (`mul`)**: The multiplication of two Church numerals `c_m` and `c_n` results in `c_{m*n}`. In SKI, this operation is performed by the `B` combinator (`B f g x = f(g x)`), whose SKI representation is `B = S(S(K S) K)`. The given expression contains this exact sub-expression. We will refer to `S(S(K(S))(K))` as `mul`.\n\n### **Step 3: Parsing and Simplifying the Expression**\n\nThe expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's substitute the known components we identified in Step 2:\n*   `I` is `c_1`\n*   `S(I)(I)` is `c_2`\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))` is `mul`\n\nThe expression becomes:\n`S(c_1)(S(I)(S(I)(K(mul(c_1)))))(mul(c_2)))`\n\nThis expression has the form `S x y z`, where:\n*   `x = c_1`\n*   `y = S(I)(S(I)(K(mul(c_1))))`\n*   `z = mul(c_2)`\n\nAccording to the definition of `S`, this will reduce as `S x y z = x z (y z)`.\nSubstituting our `x`, `y`, `z`:\n`E = c_1 z (y z)`\n\nSince `c_1` is `I` (Identity), `c_1 z (y z)` is equivalent to `I z (y z)`, which reduces to:\n`E = z (y z)`\n\nNow we need to evaluate `z` and `y z`.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluating `z`**\n\n`z = mul(c_2)`.\nThis is a partial application of the multiplication combinator. It creates a new function that, when applied to a church numeral `c_n`, will compute `mul c_2 c_n = c_{2*n}`. Therefore, `z` is a function that **doubles** a Church numeral. Let's call it `double`.\n\nSo, our expression for the final church numeral `n` is `n = double(y double)`.\n\n### **Step 5: Evaluating `y double`**\n\nThis is the most complex part. We must evaluate the result of applying `y` to `double`.\n`y = S(I)(S(I)(K(mul(c_1))))`\n\nLet's apply `y` to `double` using the `S` rule. `y` has the form `S a b` where `a = I` and `b = S(I)(K(mul(c_1)))`.\n`y double = (S I b) double = I double (b double) = double (b double)`\n\nNow we need to evaluate `b double`.\n`b = S(I)(K(mul(c_1)))`\n\nLet's apply `b` to `double`. `b` has the form `S a' b'` where `a' = I` and `b' = K(mul(c_1))`.\n`b double = (S I b') double = I double (b' double) = double (b' double)`\n\nNow we need to evaluate `b' double`.\n`b' = K(mul(c_1))`\n\n`b' double = (K (mul c_1)) double`. According to the `K` rule (`K x y = x`), this reduces to:\n`b' double = mul c_1`\n\nBefore proceeding, let's determine what `mul c_1` is. It should be a Church numeral.\n`mul c_1 f x = B c_1 f x = c_1 (f) x = I f x = f x`.\nThis is the definition of `c_1`. Therefore, `mul c_1` is equivalent to the church numeral `c_1`.\n\n### **Step 6: Assembling the results**\n\nNow we can substitute our findings back into the nested expressions.\n1.  We found `b' double = c_1`.\n2.  Substitute this into the expression for `b double`:\n    `b double = double (b' double) = double(c_1)`.\n    `double(c_1)` means `mul c_2 c_1`, which equals `c_{2*1} = c_2`.\n    So, `b double = c_2`.\n3.  Substitute this into the expression for `y double`:\n    `y double = double (b double) = double(c_2)`.\n    `double(c_2)` means `mul c_2 c_2`, which equals `c_{2*2} = c_4`.\n    So, `y double = c_4`.\n4.  Finally, substitute this into the expression for our final church numeral `n`:\n    `n = double (y double) = double(c_4)`.\n    `double(c_4)` means `mul c_2 c_4`, which equals `c_{2*4} = c_8`.\n\nThe Church numeral represented by the entire expression is `c_8`, so `n = 8`.\n\n### **Step 7: Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(8) = 3`\n\n<<<3>>>"
