No. Polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. Although they contain a sugar component (deoxyribose or ribose) in their backbone, their fundamental structure is defined by repeating nucleotide units (sugar + phosphate + base) linked by phosphodiester bonds, which is fundamentally different from polysaccharides that consist of monosaccharide units linked by glycosidic bonds.
