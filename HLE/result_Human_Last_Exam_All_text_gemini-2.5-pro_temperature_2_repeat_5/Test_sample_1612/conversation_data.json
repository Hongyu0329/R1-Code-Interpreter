    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball.\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"Triple Crown\"\nThe \"Triple Crown\" in baseball typically refers to the batting Triple Crown. To win this prestigious honor, a player must lead their respective league (either the American League or National League) in three key offensive categories all in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (AVG)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The question is almost universally interpreted as referring to the batting Triple Crown. There is also a pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA), but it is less famous and usually specified if intended. Our analysis will focus on the batting Triple Crown.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Ambiguities and Set the Scope\n*   **MLB History:** Major League Baseball history includes leagues that pre-date the modern AL/NL structure from 1901. We must decide whether to include winners from these leagues (like the National League before 1901 and the American Association). Standard baseball historiography considers these \"Major Leagues,\" so their winners should be included.\n*   **\"Winners\" vs. \"Instances\":** The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which means the number of unique players who have accomplished the feat, not the total number of times the feat has been achieved.\n*   **Statistical Nuances:** RBIs were not an official statistic until 1920. However, baseball's official record-keepers have retroactively applied the statistic, and early Triple Crown winners are officially recognized by MLB.\n\n### Step 3: List all Triple Crown Winning Seasons\nWe will list every time a player has won the Triple Crown, noting the player, year, and league.\n\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878, National League)\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887, American Association)\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894, National League)\n4.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901, American League)\n5.  **Ty Cobb** (1909, American League)\n6.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, National League)\n7.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1925, National League) - *Second time*\n8.  **Chuck Klein** (1933, National League)\n9.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, American League)\n10. **Lou Gehrig** (1934, American League)\n11. **Joe Medwick** (1937, National League)\n12. **Ted Williams** (1942, American League)\n13. **Ted Williams** (1947, American League) - *Second time*\n14. **Mickey Mantle** (1956, American League)\n15. **Frank Robinson** (1966, American League)\n16. **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, American League)\n17. **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, American League)\n\nIn total, the Triple Crown has been won **17 times**.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Unique Winners\nNow, we count the number of distinct players from the list above.\n\n1.  Paul Hines\n2.  Tip O'Neill\n3.  Hugh Duffy\n4.  Nap Lajoie\n5.  Ty Cobb\n6.  **Rogers Hornsby** (won twice)\n7.  Chuck Klein\n8.  Jimmie Foxx\n9.  Lou Gehrig\n10. Joe Medwick\n11. **Ted Williams** (won twice)\n12. Mickey Mantle\n13. Frank Robinson\n14. Carl Yastrzemski\n15. Miguel Cabrera\n\nBy counting the unique individuals on this list, we find that there have been **15** different players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<15>>>"
