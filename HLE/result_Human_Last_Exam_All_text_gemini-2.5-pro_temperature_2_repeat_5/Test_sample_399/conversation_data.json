    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the initial value problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are given a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) with an initial condition. This is an initial value problem (IVP).\n*   Differential Equation: $x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$\n*   Initial Condition: $x(0)=-8$\n*   Goal: Find the value of the solution $x(t)$ at $t=1$, i.e., find $x(1)$.\n\n**2. Identify the Type of ODE and Choose a Method**\nThe equation can be written as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. The right-hand side is a product of a function of $t$ and a function of $x$. This is a separable differential equation. The method of \"separation of variables\" is appropriate.\n\n**3. Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **Constant Solutions:** Check if there are any constant solutions by setting $x'(t)=0$. The equation becomes $(t-1)x^2(t)=0$. For this to be true for all $t$, we must have $x(t)=0$. This is a constant solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. So, the solution we are looking for is not the constant solution $x(t)=0$. This means we can safely divide by $x^2(t)$ without losing our particular solution.\n*   **Integration:** Remember to include the constant of integration, $C$, after integrating.\n*   **Algebra:** Be careful with algebraic manipulations, especially with signs and fractions when solving for the constant $C$ and the final answer.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 4.1: Separate the Variables**\nStart with the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nDivide both sides by $x^2$ and multiply by $dt$ to separate the variables $x$ and $t$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n\n**Step 4.2: Integrate Both Sides**\nIntegrate the left side with respect to $x$ and the right side with respect to $t$:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nRecall that $\\int x^n dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$. For the left side, we have $\\int x^{-2} dx$.\n$$ \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\nThis is the general implicit solution to the ODE.\n\n**Step 4.3: Use the Initial Condition to Find C**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. Substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution to find the value of the constant $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\n**Step 4.4: Write the Particular Solution**\nNow substitute the value $C = \\frac{1}{8}$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this IVP:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**Step 4.5: Find x(1)**\nThe goal is to find $x(1)$. Substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo add the fractions on the right side, find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides to solve for $x(1)$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nThe value of the solution at $t=1$ is $8/3$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
