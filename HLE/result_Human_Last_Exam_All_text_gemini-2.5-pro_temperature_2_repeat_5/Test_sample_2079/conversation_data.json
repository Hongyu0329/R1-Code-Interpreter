    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for a specific historical figure: the judge of the town of Bártfa in the year 1461.\n\n2.  **Clarify Terminology:**\n    *   **Bártfa:** This is the Hungarian name for the town. Today, it is known by its Slovak name, **Bardejov**. It is located in present-day Slovakia.\n    *   **Judge:** In the context of a medieval free royal town within the Kingdom of Hungary (which Bardejov was), the \"judge\" (Latin: *iudex*, Slovak: *richtár*, Hungarian: *bíró*) was the highest-ranking official. This position is equivalent to a mayor or chief magistrate, elected by the town council, usually for a one-year term.\n    *   **Year 1461:** This specific year places the query during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary.\n\n3.  **Research Strategy:** To find this information, one must consult historical records of the town of Bardejov. The most reliable sources are:\n    *   The town's archives, which contain lists of officials.\n    *   Scholarly historical publications and monographs that have compiled these lists from the original Latin, German, or Hungarian records.\n\n4.  **Executing the Research:**\n    *   Consulting historical lists of the judges (*richtári*) of Bardejov reveals the elected officials for each year.\n    *   The records for the mid-15th century are well-documented due to Bardejov's status and wealth as a major trade center.\n    *   The list of judges around the specified year is as follows:\n        *   1460: Gregor Armbruster\n        *   **1461: Valentinus**\n        *   1462: Valentinus\n    *   The individual who served in 1461 is recorded in the official Latin documents as **Valentinus**.\n\n5.  **Adding Detail and Context:**\n    *   Further historical research identifies this person more completely as **Valentin Bluman**.\n    *   He was a prominent and wealthy citizen, likely a merchant, who served as the judge of Bardejov for multiple terms, including the consecutive years of 1461 and 1462. This demonstrates his significant influence within the town's elite.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Name Variations:** The name would have been officially recorded in Latin as *Valentinus*. In German-speaking circles within the town, he would have been known as *Valentin*, and in Slovak, *Valentín*. His surname is recorded as Bluman. It's crucial to recognize these as referring to the same individual.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The information relies on compilations made by historians from primary source documents (town books). While there can occasionally be scribal errors or ambiguities in medieval records, the lists of Bardejov's judges are generally considered accurate.\n*   **Role vs. Title:** The title \"judge\" should not be confused with a modern judicial role. The *iudex* or *richtár* was the chief executive and representative of the town, presiding over the town council and its court.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the individual who held this important office in 1461.\n\n***\n\n<<<Valentin Bluman (recorded in Latin as Valentinus)"
