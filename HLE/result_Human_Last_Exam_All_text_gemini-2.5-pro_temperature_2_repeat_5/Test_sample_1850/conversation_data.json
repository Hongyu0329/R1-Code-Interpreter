    "To determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*, a step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n**Step 1: Defining \"Historical Saint\"**\n\nThe term \"historical saint\" must be defined in the context of the question and Milton's own 17th-century Protestant perspective.\n*   **Historical:** The figure must be understood as a real person from history, not a purely mythological or allegorical figure (this excludes angels like Michael or Raphael).\n*   **Saint:** Milton, as a Protestant, would not adhere to the formal canonization process of the Roman Catholic Church. For him, a \"saint\" (from the Greek *hagios*, \"holy one\") would broadly include revered holy figures from the Bible. Therefore, the scope should include key patriarchs, prophets, and apostles from the Old and New Testaments. The question also does not specify that Milton's mention must be positive. Therefore, any historical figure who has been canonized as a saint (e.g., by the Catholic Church) and is mentioned by name should also be counted, even if the reference is critical.\n*   **Mentioned by Name:** The figure must be explicitly named in the text, not just alluded to by a title or description (e.g., \"the Virgin\" for Mary or \"the one just man\" for Lot, neither of whom are mentioned by name).\n\n**Step 2: Systematic Search and Analysis of *Paradise Lost***\n\nWe will search the epic poem book by book for qualifying names.\n\n*   **Book I:**\n    *   **Moses:** Alluded to as \"**Amram's** Son\" (I, 338). He is mentioned by his own name later, so he counts.\n    *   **David:** Mentioned in reference to King Solomon: \"...that uxorious King, whose heart though large... fell To Idols foul.\" This is Solomon, but then the prior verse mentions the Moabite god Chemos, \"the opprobrium of **David**'s house.\" (I, 406). The context is unclear but David is named. He is clearly named in Book XII.\n\n*   **Book III:**\n    *   **Abraham:** Mentioned as the patriarch: \"the Sons of **Abraham**\" (III, 355).\n    *   **Peter:** Mentioned by name, albeit critically, in the description of the Limbo of Vanity: \"...and who reposed / Much hope in Pardons, Indulgences, Dispenses, / And **Peter's** Chair.\" (III, 489-493). This is a clear reference to Saint Peter.\n    *   **Dominic & Francis:** Mentioned in the same passage, referencing their followers: \"...who, to be sure of Paradise, dying put on the weeds of **Dominic**, or in Franciscan think to pass disguised\" (III, 474-477). These are post-biblical historical saints, mentioned by name.\n\n*   **Book XI:** In the vision shown to Adam by Michael:\n    *   **Abel:** Mentioned as the first victim of murder: \"...his surly Priest, till tantaliz'd, / Then falls on **Abel**\" (XI, 429-445). He is traditionally considered the first martyr and a saint.\n    *   **Enoch:** Mentioned as the one taken to Heaven without dying: \"Him the most High... conveyed to Heaven... with him the only righteous in a World perverse, And therefore hated... Thus walking on a secure peak of Heav'n he saw **Enoch** ascend\" (XI, 556-708, the name appears at line 665 and 708 in some editions). He is clearly named and described as being translated to Heaven.\n    *   **Noah:** Mentioned by his Latinate name, **Noe**, as the builder of the Ark: \"But God... commands **Noe** to build a wondrous Ark\" (XI, 728).\n\n*   **Book XII:** The historical narrative continues.\n    *   **Moses:** Clearly mentioned by name as the lawgiver: \"...by the hand of **Moses**\" (XII, 227).\n    *   **Isaac & Jacob:** Named as Abraham's descendants: \"...thine heir **Isaac**, and his Twinns, **Jacob** and **Esau**...\" (XII, 273).\n    *   **Joseph:** The son of Jacob is named: \"...**Joseph** comes, In whom they sell, and he againe preserves\" (XII, 287-288).\n    *   **Judah:** The son of Jacob and ancestor of the Davidic line is named: \"...and of that race from **Judah**...\" (XII, 307). As a Patriarch of one of the Twelve Tribes, he qualifies.\n    *   **David:** Mentioned clearly as the great king: \"...a King, who shall quell / The fiercest of their Foes, the mighty **David**\" (XII, 315-320).\n    *   **Solomon:** Mentioned as David's successor: \"...and next to him **Solomon**...\" (XII, 327).\n\n**Step 3: Compiling and Finalizing the List**\n\nCareful points to consider:\n*   Figures like **Lot** are alluded to (\"the one just man\") but not named.\n*   Figures like the **Virgin Mary** are central to the story of the redemption but are never mentioned by name.\n*   Figures like **Eli** (Book I) are mentioned, but his biblical role as a priest whose family was judged for wickedness makes his status as a \"saint\" highly questionable, so he is excluded.\n*   **Joshua**, successor to Moses, is described but not named.\n\nBased on the criteria, the final list is as follows:\n\n1.  **Abel** (First Martyr)\n2.  **Abraham** (Patriarch)\n3.  **David** (King)\n4.  **Dominic** (Post-Biblical Saint)\n5.  **Enoch** (Patriarch)\n6.  **Francis** (Post-Biblical Saint)\n7.  **Isaac** (Patriarch)\n8.  **Jacob** (Patriarch)\n9.  **Joseph** (Patriarch)\n10. **Judah** (Patriarch)\n11. **Moses** (Prophet)\n12. **Noah** (Patriarch, as \"Noe\")\n13. **Peter** (Apostle)\n14. **Solomon** (King)\n\nThis gives a total of 14 historical saints mentioned by name.\n\n<<<14>>>"
