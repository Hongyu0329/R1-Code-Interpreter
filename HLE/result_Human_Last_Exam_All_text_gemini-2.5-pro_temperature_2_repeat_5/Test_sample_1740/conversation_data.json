    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to determine the total number of unique members belonging to the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been found in humans. The phrase \"to date\" indicates we need the most current, accepted count.\n\n2.  **Define \"let-7 Family Member\":**\n    *   In molecular biology, a miRNA \"family\" is a group of miRNAs that share a common \"seed sequence.\" The seed sequence is a short region of nucleotides (typically positions 2-8 from the 5' end) that is critical for binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs).\n    *   Therefore, a \"member\" of the let-7 family is a distinct mature miRNA that possesses the canonical let-7 seed sequence (GAGGUAG).\n    *   It is crucial to distinguish between the mature miRNA and the precursor gene (pre-miRNA). Several different genes, located at different places in the genome, can be processed into the exact same mature miRNA sequence. The question asks for \"members,\" which most commonly refers to the unique mature miRNAs, not the number of genes.\n\n3.  **Identify the Canonical Members:**\n    *   The let-7 family is one of the most studied miRNA families. The originally identified and well-characterized members in humans include:\n        *   `let-7a`\n        *   `let-7b`\n        *   `let-7c`\n        *   `let-7d`\n        *   `let-7e`\n        *   `let-7f`\n        *   `let-7g`\n        *   `let-7i`\n    *   In addition to these, `miR-98` is universally considered a member of the let-7 family because it shares the same seed sequence and functional properties.\n    *   This gives a baseline count of 9 members.\n\n4.  **Consult the Authoritative Database (miRBase):**\n    *   To get the most current and accurate count (\"to date\"), we must refer to miRBase, the central repository for all miRNA sequences and annotations.\n    *   According to the current version of miRBase, the let-7 family (Family ID: MIPF0000002) in humans (*Homo sapiens*) includes additional miRNAs that share the GAGGUAG seed sequence.\n    *   Besides the 9 members listed above, miRBase also classifies the following human miRNAs in the let-7 family:\n        *   `miR-4458`\n        *   `miR-4500`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Total:**\n    *   By adding these more recently identified members to the canonical list, we get the total count.\n    *   9 (canonical members) + 2 (additional members from miRBase) = 11 members.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Genes vs. Mature miRNAs:** It's a common point of confusion. Humans have at least 12 distinct gene loci that produce these miRNAs (e.g., `let-7a` is produced from three genes: `let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, `let-7a-3`). However, since they all result in the same mature `let-7a` molecule, they count as one \"member.\" The question asks for members of the family, not genes.\n*   **Database Updates:** The number of known miRNAs can change as research progresses and databases are updated. The count of 11 is based on the current data in miRBase (version 22.1).\n*   **Other Potential Members:** Some research papers might suggest other members like `miR-202` (which also has the GAGGUAG seed), but it is not formally classified within the core let-7 family (MIPF0000002) in miRBase, indicating a more distant relationship. For a standard, confirmed answer, we stick to the official family classification in the primary database.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the most accurate answer is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
