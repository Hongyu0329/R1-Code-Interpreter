    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the definitions provided and the application of a known result from group theory that characterizes filled groups.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core definitions**\n\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset S of a group G is product-free if for any two elements a, b ∈ S (not necessarily distinct), their product ab is not in S. This is equivalent to S ∩ (S ⋅ S) = ∅. A direct consequence is that the identity element, `e`, cannot be in any non-empty product-free set, because if e ∈ S, then e ⋅ e = e ∈ S.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set S is maximal (by inclusion) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means for any element g ∈ G \\ S, the set S ∪ {g} is no longer product-free. This implies that for any g ∈ G \\ S, there must exist x, y ∈ S ∪ {g} such that xy ∈ S ∪ {g}. As S is product-free, at least one of x or y must be g. This leads to three possibilities for any g ∈ G \\ S:\n    1.  g² ∈ S ∪ {g}\n    2.  gs ∈ S ∪ {g} for some s ∈ S\n    3.  sg ∈ S ∪ {g} for some s ∈ S\n*   **A set S that \"fills\" G:** A subset S fills G if G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {e}, where S⁻¹ = {s⁻¹ | s ∈ S}. This means every non-identity element of G is either in S or its inverse is in S.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group G is filled if *every* maximal product-free set in G fills G. This is a very strong condition on the group's structure.\n\n**Step 2: Identify relevant theorems**\n\nSolving this from first principles is highly complex. The term \"filled group\" points to a specific, researched topic in group theory. A key result, established by Gentile and others, provides a complete characterization of finite filled groups.\n\n**Theorem (Gentile):** A finite group G is filled if and only if G is a Frobenius group with kernel K and a complement C of order 2, say C = <x>, where the action of the non-identity element x on K by conjugation is inversion. That is, for every k ∈ K, xkx⁻¹ = k⁻¹.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the theorem to groups of order 2q^m**\n\nWe are looking for nonabelian filled groups G of order |G| = 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m ≥ 1.\n\n1.  According to the theorem, G must be a Frobenius group, G = K rtimes C.\n2.  The complement C has order 2. Let C = <x>, where x² = e.\n3.  The kernel K must have order |G|/|C| = (2q^m)/2 = q^m.\n4.  The action of x on K must be inversion: xkx⁻¹ = k⁻¹ for all k ∈ K.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the properties of the resulting group structure**\n\nWe need to check if this structure matches the conditions of the problem.\n\n*   **Is K necessarily abelian?** For the inversion map k ↦ k⁻¹ to be an automorphism of K (which it must be for the semidirect product to be well-defined), we must have (k₁k₂)⁻¹ = k₁⁻¹k₂⁻¹ for any k₁, k₂ ∈ K. The standard rule for inverses is (k₁k₂)⁻¹ = k₂⁻¹k₁⁻¹. So we must have k₂⁻¹k₁⁻¹ = k₁⁻¹k₂⁻¹. This means that the inverses of any two elements in K commute. Since every element in K is the inverse of some other element (k = (k⁻¹)⁻¹), it follows that all elements of K commute. Therefore, the kernel K must be an abelian group.\n*   **Is G nonabelian?** The group G = K rtimes <x> is nonabelian if and only if the action of <x> on K is not trivial. The action is inversion. This action is trivial only if k⁻¹ = k for all k ∈ K, which means k² = e for all k ∈ K. The order of K is q^m, where q is an odd prime. Every element in K has an order that divides q^m, so its order is a power of q. The only element that can satisfy k² = e is the identity element e (since ord(k) must divide gcd(2, q^n)=1). Since K is not the trivial group (as m≥1), the inversion map is not the identity map, and therefore G is nonabelian.\n*   **Is G a Frobenius group?** A semidirect product K rtimes C is a Frobenius group if the action of C on K is fixed-point-free on the non-identity elements of K. A fixed point is an element k ∈ K such that xkx⁻¹ = k. Given the inversion action, this means k⁻¹ = k, or k² = e. As established above, for a group K of odd order q^m, the only element satisfying k² = e is the identity. Thus, the action is fixed-point-free, and G is indeed a Frobenius group.\n\n**Step 5: Characterize the groups K**\n\nThe kernel K must be an abelian group of order q^m. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any such group K is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order:\nK ≅ Z_{q^{m_1}} × Z_{q^{m_2}} × ⋯ × Z_{q^{m_r}}\nwhere the exponents m_i are positive integers such that m₁ + m₂ + ⋯ + m_r = m.\nEach distinct partition of the integer m corresponds to a unique non-isomorphic abelian group K of order q^m.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups G of order 2q^m are precisely the groups constructed as follows:\n*   Take any abelian group K of order q^m.\n*   Form the semidirect product G = K rtimes Z₂, where the non-identity element of Z₂ acts on K via the inversion automorphism (mapping each k ∈ K to k⁻¹).\n\nThese groups are known as **generalized dihedral groups**, often denoted as Dih(K). Each choice of a non-isomorphic abelian group K of order q^m yields a non-isomorphic filled group G.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, for an odd prime q and a natural number m, are the **generalized dihedral groups Dih(K)**, where K is an abelian group of order q^m.\n\nA group G is the generalized dihedral group Dih(K) if it has the following structure:\n1.  It contains a normal subgroup K that is an abelian group of order q^m.\n2.  It contains an element of order 2, let's call it s, that is not in K.\n3.  The group G is the set G = K ∪ sK, and the entire group structure is determined by the relation sks⁻¹ = k⁻¹ for all k ∈ K.\n\nThe possible groups for the kernel K are, up to isomorphism, the direct products of cyclic groups:\nK ≅ Z_{q^{m_1}} × Z_{q^{m_2}} × ⋯ × Z_{q^{m_r}}\nwhere m₁, m₂, ..., m_r is a partition of the integer m. The number of such non-isomorphic groups for a given m is p(m), the partition number of m.\n\nFor example:\n*   If m = 1, K must be Z_q. The only group is the standard dihedral group D_{2q}.\n*   If m = 2, K can be Z_{q²} or Z_q × Z_q. This gives rise to two non-isomorphic filled groups, Dih(Z_{q²}) and Dih(Z_q × Z_q).\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, for an odd prime q and a natural number m, are the generalized dihedral groups Dih(K), where K is any abelian group of order q^m. These groups are constructed as the semidirect product G = K ⋊ Z₂, where the non-identity element of Z₂ acts on K by sending every element k ∈ K to its inverse k⁻¹.>>>"
