The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, for an odd prime q and a natural number m, are the generalized dihedral groups Dih(K), where K is any abelian group of order q^m. These groups are constructed as the semidirect product G = K ⋊ Z₂, where the non-identity element of Z₂ acts on K by sending every element k ∈ K to its inverse k⁻¹.
