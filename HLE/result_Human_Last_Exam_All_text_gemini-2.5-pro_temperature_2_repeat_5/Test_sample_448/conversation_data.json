    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nFirst, we need to list the elements that are classified as noble gases (Group 18 of the periodic table). These are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*   Oganesson (Og)\n\n**Step 2: Filter the List Based on the Question's Constraints**\nThe question asks about noble gases on Earth in the year 2002.\n*   **Oganesson (Og):** This is a synthetic element that was first created in a laboratory in 2006. It does not occur naturally on Earth. Therefore, it cannot be the answer.\n*   **Year 2002:** The relative abundance of naturally occurring elements on Earth does not change significantly on a year-to-year basis. So, we can use standard, generally accepted abundance data. The year 2002 does not fundamentally change the answer.\n\nThis leaves us with Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas in Terrestrial Matter**\nThe question refers to \"all terrestrial matter,\" which includes the atmosphere, crust, mantle, and core. Noble gases are most easily measured in the atmosphere, where they are relatively more concentrated. Let's compare their abundances, primarily focusing on the atmosphere where they are found in their elemental form.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** The most abundant noble gas on Earth, making up about 0.934% (9,340 parts per million, or ppm) of the Earth's atmosphere by volume.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant, with an atmospheric concentration of about 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** The third most abundant, with an atmospheric concentration of about 5.2 ppm.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Much rarer than the first three, with an atmospheric concentration of about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Very rare, with an atmospheric concentration of about 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion, ppb).\n\nBased on the stable noble gases, Xenon is the rarest. Now we must consider Radon.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Unique Nature of Radon (Rn)**\n*   **Radioactivity and Half-Life:** Radon is different from the other noble gases on the list because it is radioactive. All of its isotopes are unstable and decay over time. Its most stable and common isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Source:** Radon is not a primordial element from the Earth's formation. Instead, it is continuously generated through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, which are found in trace amounts throughout the Earth's crust.\n*   **Steady-State Abundance:** Because Radon decays so quickly, it never accumulates in significant quantities. The total amount of radon on Earth at any given moment represents a \"steady-state\" balance between its rate of formation and its rate of decay.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Abundances of Xenon and Radon**\n*   **Xenon (Xe)** is stable, so the amount present today is a fixed quantity (the amount the Earth originally retained). Its atmospheric concentration is about 90 parts per billion.\n*   **Radon (Rn)** is transient. Its atmospheric concentration is extremely low and highly variable, typically estimated to be about 1 part in 10^21 (one part per sextillion). This is many orders of magnitude lower than Xenon's concentration.\n\nEven considering the Radon in the soil and groundwater, its extremely short half-life ensures that its total mass on the entire planet at any given instant is incredibly smallâ€”estimated to be only a few tens of kilograms in total. In contrast, the mass of Xenon in the atmosphere alone is estimated to be over a trillion kilograms.\n\n**Conclusion**\nDue to its radioactivity and extremely short half-life, Radon (Rn) does not accumulate and exists in far smaller quantities at any moment in time than any other natural noble gas. Therefore, it is the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
