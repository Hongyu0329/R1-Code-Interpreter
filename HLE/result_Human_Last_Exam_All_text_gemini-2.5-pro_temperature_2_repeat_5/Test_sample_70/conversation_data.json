    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the rank of the Danish flag\n\nFirst, we must determine the linear algebraic rank of the matrix representing the flag of Denmark.\nThe flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross.\nTo represent this as a matrix, we can imagine a grid of pixels covering the flag. Each entry in the matrix corresponds to a pixel's color. The problem states that \"values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal.\" This means we should assign distinct numerical values to different colors that do not have special mathematical relationships (e.g., Red=1, White=2. If we chose Red=1, White=0, the rank might not be maximal). Let's use `R` for the value of red and `W` for the value of white, where `R ≠ W` and both are non-zero.\n\nThe rows of the Danish flag matrix will be of two types:\n1.  Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the cross. These rows are all white. Let's represent such a row as `r_W = [W, W, W, ..., W]`.\n2.  Rows that are not part of the horizontal bar. These rows are mostly red, but interrupted by the vertical bar of the cross. Let's represent such a row as `r_R/W = [R, ..., R, W, ..., W, R, ..., R]`.\n\nThe set of all rows in the flag's matrix consists of vectors of type `r_W` and `r_R/W`. Let's check if these two types of vectors are linearly independent.\n`r_W` is a constant vector.\n`r_R/W` is not a constant vector.\nFor these two vectors to be linearly dependent, one must be a scalar multiple of the other. So, `r_R/W = k * r_W` for some scalar `k`.\nThis would mean `[R, ..., W, ..., R] = k * [W, ..., W, ..., W] = [kW, ..., kW, ..., kW]`.\nComparing the components, we would need `R = kW` and `W = kW`. This is only possible if `R = W`, which contradicts the requirement to maximize rank by choosing distinct values for distinct colors.\nTherefore, the vectors `r_W` and `r_R/W` are linearly independent. Since all rows in the matrix are of one of these two types, the entire row space is spanned by these two vectors.\nThus, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze African flags to find those with a rank of 2\n\nWe are looking for African flags whose matrix representation has a rank of 2. This means the space spanned by the flag's row vectors (or column vectors) must be two-dimensional.\n\nLet's categorize flag patterns:\n\n1.  **Simple Stripe Flags (Horizontal or Vertical):**\n    Examples: Nigeria (Green-White-Green vertical), Gabon (Green-Yellow-Blue horizontal).\n    Let's analyze a horizontal tricolor like Gabon's. The rows would be of three types: `[G, G, ...]`, `[Y, Y, ...]`, and `[B, B, ...]`. Let G, Y, B be distinct non-zero numbers. The vectors are `G * [1,1,...]`, `Y * [1,1,...]`, `B * [1,1,...]`. All these vectors are multiples of the all-ones vector `[1,1,...]`. They are therefore linearly dependent. The row space is spanned by a single vector. The rank is 1.\n    This means all simple horizontal or vertical striped flags (bicolors, tricolors, etc.) have a rank of 1, not 2.\n\n2.  **Flags with Complex Geometry (Diagonals, Triangles, Complex Cantons):**\n    Examples: Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Tanzania.\n    These flags generally produce many different, non-trivial row vectors. For instance, a diagonal division of colors creates a unique row for each pixel row. These vectors are typically linearly independent, leading to a rank much greater than 2.\n\n3.  **Flags with Two-Dimensional Geometric Structure:**\n    These flags have rows (or columns) that can be described as linear combinations of just two basis vectors.\n\n    *   **Benin** and **Madagascar**: These flags have a vertical stripe on the hoist side and two horizontal stripes on the fly side.\n        - Benin: Vertical Green, Horizontal Yellow over Red.\n        - Madagascar: Vertical White, Horizontal Red over Green.\n        Let's analyze Benin. Let the colors be G, Y, R. The rows are of two types:\n        1.  `r_Y = [G, ..., G, Y, ..., Y]` (a top row)\n        2.  `r_R = [G, ..., G, R, ..., R]` (a bottom row)\n        These two vectors are linearly independent (since `Y ≠ R`). All rows in the flag are of type `r_Y` or `r_R`. The row space is spanned by these two vectors, so the rank is 2. The same logic applies to Madagascar.\n\n    *   **Guinea-Bissau**: This flag has a vertical red stripe (with a black star) at the hoist and a horizontal bicolor (yellow over green) at the fly. We can analyze its columns.\n        1.  Columns in the red stripe area: These are complex due to the star, but they all share the red-and-black pattern. Let's call this type `c_star`. Example: `[R,..,R,Black,..,Black,R,..R]^T`.\n        2.  Columns in the bicolor area: These are all identical, of the form `[Y, ..., Y, G, ..., G]^T`. Let's call this `c_YG`.\n        The vectors `c_star` and `c_YG` are clearly linearly independent. Since all columns are of one of these two types, the column space is spanned by them. The rank is 2.\n\n4.  **Flags with a Simple, Symmetrical Symbol on a Bicolor Background:**\n    This case is more subtle.\n    *   **Burkina Faso**: Horizontal red-over-green bicolor with a yellow star in the center. The rows are:\n        1. Plain red rows: `r_R = [R, ..., R]`\n        2. Plain green rows: `r_G = [G, ..., G]`\n        3. Red rows with the star: `r_R_star = [R, ..., Y, ..., R]`\n        4. Green rows with the star: `r_G_star = [G, ..., Y, ..., G]`\n        The row vectors `r_R` and `r_G` are constant vectors and thus are linearly dependent on each other (they are multiples of the all-ones vector, `u`). Let's use `u` and a `delta` vector representing the star's shape as a basis. All four types of rows can be expressed as linear combinations of just two basis vectors, e.g., `u` and `r_R_star`. A formal analysis shows that the space spanned by all these vectors is two-dimensional. Therefore, the rank is 2.\n\n    *   **Algeria**: Vertical green-and-white bicolor with a red star and crescent in the center, straddling the color boundary. A similar analysis of the columns, symmetrical to the Burkina Faso row analysis, shows that the column space is spanned by two basis vectors. Therefore, the rank is 2.\n\n### Step 3: Final List\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the following African national flags have a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark:\n\n*   **Algeria**: A symbol symmetrically placed on a vertical bicolor.\n*   **Benin**: A vertical stripe combined with a horizontal bicolor.\n*   **Burkina Faso**: A symbol symmetrically placed on a horizontal bicolor.\n*   **Guinea-Bissau**: A vertical stripe (containing a symbol) combined with a horizontal bicolor.\n*   **Madagascar**: A vertical stripe combined with a horizontal bicolor.\n\n<<<Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar>>>"
