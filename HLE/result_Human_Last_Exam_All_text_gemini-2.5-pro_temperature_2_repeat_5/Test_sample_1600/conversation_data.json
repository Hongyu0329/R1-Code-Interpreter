    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the value of a(3).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **a(n):** A function that gives the number of certain Feynman diagrams.\n    *   **Feynman diagrams:** Graphical representations of mathematical expressions describing the interactions of subatomic particles.\n    *   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** The relativistic quantum field theory of electrodynamics. It describes how light and matter interact. In QED, the basic interaction vertex involves one photon, one incoming electron, and one outgoing electron.\n    *   **Order 2n:** This refers to the perturbation order of the diagram. In QED, the perturbation series is an expansion in the coupling constant `e`. Each vertex in a diagram contributes one factor of `e`. Therefore, a diagram with `V` vertices is of order `e^V`. Since observable quantities are often expressed in terms of the fine-structure constant `α = e^2/(4π)`, the order is typically given in powers of `α`. A diagram with `V = 2n` vertices will be of order `(e^2)^n = (constant * α)^n`, i.e., `α^n`. The number of loops `L` in a propagator correction diagram is related to the number of vertices `V` by `L = V/2`. Thus, an order `2n` diagram (meaning `2n` vertices) corresponds to an `n`-loop diagram.\n    *   **Electron or the photon propagators:** We are interested in propagator correction diagrams, also known as self-energy diagrams. These are diagrams with two external lines of the same type (either two external electron lines for the electron self-energy or two external photon lines for the photon self-energy).\n    *   **Non-vanishing:** The calculated value of the diagram must not be zero. This condition eliminates diagrams that are zero due to symmetries (like those forbidden by Furry's Theorem), but the standard set of irreducible propagator diagrams are all non-vanishing. We are counting topologically distinct diagrams.\n    *   **The Goal:** We need to find `a(3)`. Based on our interpretation, this means finding the number of 3-loop Feynman diagrams for the electron or photon propagator in QED.\n\n2.  **Counting the Diagrams for small `n`:**\n    *   **Case n=1 (Order 2, 1-loop):**\n        *   **Electron self-energy:** There is one single diagram. An incoming electron emits a virtual photon and then reabsorbs it. This diagram has 2 vertices and forms 1 loop.\n        *   **Photon self-energy (vacuum polarization):** There is one single diagram. A photon creates a virtual electron-positron pair, which then annihilates back into a photon. This diagram also has 2 vertices and forms 1 loop.\n        *   So, for `n=1`, the number of diagrams is 1. `a(1) = 1`.\n\n    *   **Case n=2 (Order 4, 2-loops):**\n        *   Counting these diagrams by hand is more complicated. One must consider all possible ways to connect 4 vertices to form a diagram with two external legs that cannot be cut by removing a single internal line (this is the condition for being \"one-particle irreducible\" or 1PI, which is standard for counting fundamental corrections).\n        *   The known result from QED calculations is that there are 7 such diagrams for both the electron and photon self-energy.\n        *   So, for `n=2`, the number of diagrams is 7. `a(2) = 7`.\n\n3.  **Finding the Value for n=3 (Order 6, 3-loops):**\n    *   Counting the 3-loop self-energy diagrams by hand is extremely difficult and highly prone to error. There are many ways to connect 6 vertices.\n    *   This number is a known result in the field of high-precision QED calculations. Such combinatorial problems have been studied extensively by physicists and mathematicians.\n    *   We have identified a sequence of numbers: `a(1)=1`, `a(2)=7`, ... We are looking for `a(3)`.\n    *   This sequence is well-documented. For instance, it can be found in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence identifier A000599.\n    *   The entry for A000599 is titled \"Number of n-loop one-particle irreducible diagrams for the electron or photon propagator in quantum electrodynamics.\" This perfectly matches the problem description.\n    *   The sequence begins: `1, 7, 72, 959, 16104, ...`\n    *   The first term (`n=1`) is 1.\n    *   The second term (`n=2`) is 7.\n    *   The third term (`n=3`) is 72.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Order 2n\":** The key is to correctly associate \"order `2n`\" with `n`-loop diagrams. `2n` refers to the number of vertices, not the number of loops.\n2.  **\"Electron or Photon\":** It's a non-trivial property of QED that the number of 1PI propagator correction diagrams is the same for both electrons and photons at any given loop order. The underlying graph theory is identical.\n3.  **1PI Requirement:** Although not explicitly stated, counting propagator corrections fundamentally involves counting the one-particle irreducible (1PI) diagrams. Non-1PI diagrams are reducible to products of lower-order diagrams.\n4.  **Use of Established Results:** For `n > 2`, direct enumeration is impractical. The question relies on knowledge of established results in theoretical physics.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nFollowing the analysis:\n*   `a(n)` is the number of `n`-loop self-energy diagrams in QED.\n*   `a(1)` = 1 (1-loop diagrams).\n*   `a(2)` = 7 (2-loop diagrams).\n*   We need `a(3)`, which is the number of 3-loop diagrams.\n*   From known results in physics literature and combinatorial sequences (OEIS A000599), the number of 3-loop self-energy diagrams in QED is 72.\n\nTherefore, `a(3) = 72`.\n\n<<<72>>>"
