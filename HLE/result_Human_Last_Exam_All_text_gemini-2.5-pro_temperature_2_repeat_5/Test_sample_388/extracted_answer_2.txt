The pharmacist should counsel Allison on the significant interaction between her fluoxetine (an SSRI) and the aspirin (an NSAID) contained in the Excedrin she took. Taking these two medications together substantially increases the risk of stomach and intestinal bleeding. The pharmacist should recommend that for future headaches, she use a safer alternative that contains only acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), and advise her to speak with her doctor about managing her headaches while on her current prescriptions.
