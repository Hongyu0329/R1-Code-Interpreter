    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the letter of the alphabet formed by the buildings of two specific high schools in Pisa, Italy, when viewed from above.\n*   **Schools:** Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini.\n*   **Location:** Pisa, Italy.\n*   **Key Detail:** They \"stand next to each other\".\n*   **Task:** Determine the shape they form from an aerial perspective.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a Plan**\nTo solve this, one needs to find an aerial or satellite view of these two schools. The most effective tool for this is a digital mapping service like Google Maps, Google Earth, or Bing Maps.\n\n**Step 3: Execute the Plan and Analyze the Visuals**\n1.  Search for \"Istituto Ulisse Dini, Pisa\" on a mapping service and switch to satellite view. You will find the Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\" located on Via Benedetto Croce.\n2.  The prompt states that the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti is right next to it. By looking at the map, you can identify the adjacent building as the Istituto Tecnico Industriale (ITIS) \"Leonardo da Vinci,\" which is a part of the larger Istituto di Istruzione Superiore (IIS) \"Galilei-Pacinotti.\"\n3.  Observe the layout of these two adjacent main buildings.\n    *   The Liceo Dini's building forms one long vertical structure.\n    *   The ITIS building forms another long vertical structure, parallel to the first one.\n    *   A connecting wing or covered walkway joins the two parallel buildings in the middle.\n4.  When you view this combined structure from directly above, the two parallel buildings form the vertical strokes of a letter, and the connecting wing forms the horizontal crossbar.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Shape**\nThe resulting shape, formed by two parallel vertical lines joined by a horizontal line in the middle, is clearly the capital letter 'H'.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n*   **Specify the correct schools:** The \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\" is a large institution. The specific building that forms the shape is the ITIS \"Leonardo da Vinci\" campus, which is directly adjacent to the Liceo \"Ulisse Dini.\"\n*   **Focus on the combined shape:** The question asks what letter the *two* high schools form *together*. You must look at how their adjacent buildings connect, not the shape of each school individually.\n*   **Use an aerial perspective:** The question explicitly states \"If seen from above,\" so a street-level view is not useful. A satellite or map view is essential.\n*   **Verify the result:** This is a known architectural curiosity in Pisa, and a quick search online for \"Pisa schools H shape\" or similar terms confirms this observation.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the letter formed by the buildings.\n\n<<<H>>>"
