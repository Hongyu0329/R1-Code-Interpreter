    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of the definitions of several key terms in topology, particularly how they behave in spaces that are not necessarily metric.\n\n### Step 1: Define the core concepts.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected, Hausdorff space. The question explicitly states \"(not necessarily metric)\", but the Hausdorff condition is standard for the term \"continuum\" in modern topology. We will see that relaxing the Hausdorff condition is key to finding the answer.\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. (A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to `X`).\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable.\n*   **Composant:** The composant of a point `x` in a continuum `X` is the set of all points `y` in `X` such that `x` and `y` are contained in some proper subcontinuum of `X`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the properties of composants.\n\nFor an indecomposable continuum, the relation `x ~ y` (meaning `x` and `y` lie in the same proper subcontinuum) can be shown to be an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are the composants. This means that for an indecomposable continuum, the composants form a partition of the space—they are pairwise disjoint and their union is the whole space.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the number of composants in the standard (Hausdorff) case.\n\n1.  **A non-degenerate continuum with one composant is decomposable.** A theorem in continuum theory states that if a continuum `X` (with more than one point) has only one composant, it must be decomposable. Therefore, an indecomposable continuum (if non-degenerate) must have at least two composants.\n2.  **In a metric indecomposable continuum, the number of composants is uncountable.** A series of theorems for metric continua establishes this:\n    *   Every proper subcontinuum of an indecomposable continuum is nowhere dense (has an empty interior).\n    *   Every composant can be written as a countable union of these nowhere dense proper subcontinua, making it a \"set of the first category\".\n    *   If there were only a countable number of composants, the entire space `X` would be a countable union of first category sets, making it a first category set itself.\n    *   However, the Baire Category Theorem states that a complete metric space (and thus a compact metric space like a continuum) is a \"set of the second category\" in itself.\n    *   This contradiction implies that the number of composants cannot be finite or countably infinite. It must be uncountable (specifically, it is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum).\n3.  These arguments extend from metric spaces to all compact **Hausdorff** spaces, because the Baire Category Theorem holds for them as well. So, any Hausdorff indecomposable continuum must have an uncountable number of composants.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the \"not necessarily metric\" clause.\n\nThe crucial part of the question is `(not necessarily metric)`. In compact spaces, the main property that separates metric spaces from non-metric ones is the Hausdorff separation axiom. While the term \"continuum\" almost always implies Hausdorff, in the context of a puzzle-like question, relaxing this standard assumption might be the intended path to a solution. If we consider compact, connected spaces that are **not** Hausdorff, the Baire Category Theorem does not apply, and the conclusion from Step 3 is avoided.\n\n### Step 5: Construct a non-Hausdorff example.\n\nLet's construct a simple, finite topological space that is a non-Hausdorff indecomposable continuum and count its composants.\n\nConsider the set `X = {a, b, c}` with the topology `T = {∅, {c}, X}`.\n*   **Compact:** `X` is finite, so it is compact.\n*   **Connected:** The only proper non-empty open set is `{c}`. Its complement `{a, b}` is not open. Thus, `X` cannot be partitioned into two disjoint non-empty open sets, so it is connected.\n*   **Hausdorff:** No. For instance, points `a` and `b` cannot be separated by disjoint open neighborhoods. So, this is a non-Hausdorff continuum.\n*   **Subcontinua (Closed, Connected Subsets):** The closed sets are `X`, `{a, b}`, and `∅`. `X` is a subcontinuum. `{a, b}` with the subspace topology ` {∅, {a, b}}` is connected, so it is also a subcontinuum. Thus, `K = {a, b}` is the only proper subcontinuum of `X`.\n*   **Indecomposable:** To be decomposable, `X` must be the union of two proper subcontinua. The only proper subcontinuum is `K`. `X` cannot be written as `K U K` or any other such union. Therefore, `X` is indecomposable.\n*   **Composants:** Let's find the composants. The only proper subcontinuum is `K = {a, b}`.\n    *   The composant of `a` consists of all points `y` such that `{a, y}` is contained in `K`. This is true for `y=a` and `y=b`. So the composant containing `a` is `{a, b}`.\n    *   The composant of `b` is likewise `{a, b}`.\n    *   The composant of `c` consists of points `y` such that `{c, y}` is in a proper subcontinuum. No proper subcontinuum contains `c`. Therefore, the composant of `c` contains only `c` itself.\n*   The distinct composants are `{a, b}` and `{c}`. There are **2** of them.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion.\n\nWe have established:\n1.  A non-degenerate indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant.\n2.  We constructed a non-Hausdorff indecomposable continuum that has exactly two composants.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric, and potentially not Hausdorff) continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
