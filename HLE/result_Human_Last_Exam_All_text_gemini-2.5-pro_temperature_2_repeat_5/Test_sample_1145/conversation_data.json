    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\n*   **System:** A particle confined to a one-dimensional box.\n*   **Box Dimensions:** The box extends from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   **Quantum State:** The particle is in the first excited state, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   **Interval of Interest:** We need to find the particle in the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the probability `P` of finding the particle within this specified interval.\n\n**2. Recall the Fundamental Equations**\n\n*   **Wavefunction for a Particle in a 1D Box:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is given by:\n    `ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n*   **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle per unit length at a position `x` is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    `P(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)`\n*   **Probability over an Interval:** To find the probability of the particle being between `x₁` and `x₂`, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval:\n    `P = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] |ψn(x)|² dx`\n\n**3. Apply the Specifics of the Problem**\n\n*   For our case, `n = 2`, `x₁ = 0.495a`, and `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n*   The probability density function for `n=2` is:\n    `P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n*   The integral we need to solve is:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n**4. Careful Point: Analyzing the Interval and Wavefunction**\n\n*   The interval `Δx = x₂ - x₁ = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a` is very narrow.\n*   The interval is centered at `x = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a`.\n*   Let's examine the wavefunction for `n=2` at the center of this interval, `x = 0.5a`:\n    `ψ₂(0.5a) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2π(0.5a) / a) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(π) = 0`\n*   This means there is a **node** (a point of zero probability) at the exact center of the box for the `n=2` state. Our interval is centered precisely on this node.\n*   Because the probability is zero at the center and non-zero on either side, we cannot use a simple approximation like `P ≈ P(x_center) * Δx`. We must perform the full integration.\n\n**5. Solving the Integral**\n\n*   To solve the integral of `sin²(u)`, we use the power-reduction identity: `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ)) / 2`.\n*   Applying this to our integrand: `sin²(2πx / a) = (1 - cos(2 * 2πx / a)) / 2 = (1 - cos(4πx / a)) / 2`.\n*   Substitute this back into the probability integral:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * [ (1 - cos(4πx / a)) / 2 ] dx`\n*   Simplify the expression:\n    `P = (1/a) * ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx`\n*   Now, perform the integration:\n    `P = (1/a) * [x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a)]` evaluated from `0.495a` to `0.505a`.\n*   Apply the limits of integration:\n    `P = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - (a / 4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)) - (0.495a - (a / 4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)) ]`\n*   Group the terms:\n    `P = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a/4π) * (sin(4π * 0.505) - sin(4π * 0.495)) ]`\n*   Simplify further:\n    `P = (1/a) * [ 0.01a - (a/4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)) ]`\n    `P = 0.01 - (1/4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π))`\n\n**6. Evaluating the Trigonometric Terms**\n\n*   Use the identities `sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ)` and `sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ)`.\n*   `sin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)`\n*   `sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)`\n*   Substitute these back into the expression for `P`:\n    `P = 0.01 - (1/4π) * (sin(0.02π) - [-sin(0.02π)])`\n    `P = 0.01 - (1/4π) * (2 * sin(0.02π))`\n    `P = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)`\n\n**7. Final Numerical Calculation**\n\n*   Now, we calculate the numerical value. We need the value of `sin(0.02π)`. The angle `0.02π` is in radians.\n*   `0.02π ≈ 0.02 * 3.14159265 = 0.06283185` radians.\n*   `sin(0.06283185) ≈ 0.06279052`\n*   Substitute this value back into our equation for `P`:\n    `P ≈ 0.01 - (1 / (2 * 3.14159265)) * 0.06279052`\n    `P ≈ 0.01 - (0.15915494) * 0.06279052`\n    `P ≈ 0.01 - 0.00999341`\n    `P ≈ 0.00000659`\n\n*   Alternatively, using the more precise Taylor series expansion for sin(u) where `u` is small (`sin(u) ≈ u - u³/6`):\n    Let `u = 0.02π`.\n    `P ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * [u - u³/6] = 0.01 - (u/2π) + u³/(12π) = 0.01 - (0.02π/2π) + (0.02π)³/(12π)`\n    `P ≈ 0.01 - 0.01 + (0.000008π³)/(12π) = (2/3)π² × 10⁻⁶`\n    `P ≈ (2/3) * (9.8696) × 10⁻⁶ ≈ 6.5797 × 10⁻⁶`\n\nBoth methods yield a result very close to `6.58 × 10⁻⁶`.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability is approximately 0.00000658.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
