    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb form *seh₂giyeti.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **PIE Form:** The starting point is PIE **\\*seh₂g-ie-ti**.\n    *   **Root:** *seh₂g-* (meaning related to tracking, perceiving, seeking). The *h₂* is a laryngeal consonant.\n    *   **Suffix:** *-ie-* (a present tense suffix).\n    *   **Ending:** *-ti (3rd person singular active indicative ending).\n    *   **Full Form:** A 3rd person singular present indicative verb, meaning \"(s)he is perceiving/giving a sign\".\n\n2.  **Key Issue: Ablaut Grade:** The provided form is in the *e-grade* (*seh₂g-*). However, the descendant verbs in the Germanic languages (Gothic *sokjan*, ON *sœkja*, OE *sēċan*, OHG *suohhen*) are all derived from a stem with a long *ō*. This points to the fact that Proto-Germanic generalized the *o-grade* form of the root, **\\*soh₂g-**, for this verb. This is a common occurrence in language evolution where one ablaut grade becomes the standard for a particular word family. Therefore, our derivation into Germanic must start from the o-grade to arrive at the historically attested forms.\n\n3.  **Meaning Shift:** The meaning of the root in PIE, confirmed by Latin *sāgīre* (‘to perceive acutely, be keen-nosed’), is about perception. In Germanic, this shifted to a more active sense: 'to seek, to look for'.\n\n4.  **Target Forms:** The request asks for the specific reflexes of the 3rd person singular present indicative form in four languages: Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German. We will not be deriving the infinitive, but the form corresponding to \"(s)he seeks\".\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n#### **Step 1: Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n1.  **Select the correct ablaut grade:** As noted, Germanic used the o-grade form **\\*soh₂g-**.\n2.  **Laryngeal Effect:** The *h₂* laryngeal merges with the preceding *o* to create a long vowel, pre-Germanic *\\*ā*. So, *soh₂g- → *sāg-.\n3.  **Grimm's Law (First Germanic Sound Shift):**\n    *   PIE voiced stop *g* becomes the PGmc voiceless stop *k*.\n    *   *sāg- → *sāk-.\n4.  **Proto-Germanic Vowel Shift:**\n    *   The long vowel *\\*ā* (from PIE *oH* or *eh₂*) becomes long *\\*ō* in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   *sāk- → **\\*sōk-**. This is the Proto-Germanic root.\n5.  **Verbal Ending:** The PIE present suffix *-ie-* becomes the suffix for Class 1 weak verbs in Germanic. The 3rd person singular PIE ending *-ti* becomes PGmc *-þi* and then simply **-iþ**.\n6.  **Final Proto-Germanic Form:** We combine the root *sōk-* with the verbal elements: *sōk- + -i- (from the suffix) + -þ (from the ending).\n    *   **Proto-Germanic: \\*sōkiþ** (\"he/she seeks\")\n\n#### **Step 2: Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc **\\*sōkiþ**.\n2.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The high front vowel *i* in the ending causes the back vowel *ō* in the root to front. PGmc *ō* becomes Old Norse **œ**.\n    *   *sōkiþ → *sœkiþ.\n3.  **Ending Change:** The 3rd person singular present indicative ending in Old Norse becomes **-r** (after unstressed vowels). The old *-iþ* ending is lost.\n    *   *sœkiþ → sœkir.\n4.  **Final Old Norse Form:**\n    *   **Old Norse: sœkir**\n\n#### **Step 3: Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc **\\*sōkiþ**.\n2.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The *i* in the ending fronts the root vowel *ō*. In the dialect that became Old English (Anglo-Frisian), *ō* is fronted and raised to become **ē**.\n    *   *sōkiþ → *sēkiþ.\n3.  **Palatalization:** The consonant *k* when it comes before a front vowel (like the newly formed *ē* or the *i* in the suffix) is palatalized into the affricate /tʃ/, spelled **ċ**.\n    *   *sēkiþ → *sēċiþ.\n4.  **Ending Change:** The PGmc ending *-iþ* evolves into the Old English ending **-eþ**.\n    *   *sēċiþ → sēċeþ. (A later syncopated form *sēcþ* also exists).\n5.  **Final Old English Form:**\n    *   **Old English: sēċeþ**\n\n#### **Step 4: Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc **\\*sōkiþ**.\n2.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** The PGmc voiceless stop *k* shifts to a fricative or affricate. After a vowel, it becomes the voiceless velar fricative /x/, written as **hh** between vowels.\n    *   *sōkiþ → *sōhhiþ.\n3.  **Vowel Change:** PGmc long *ō* becomes the diphthong **uo** in Old High German.\n    *   *sōhhiþ → *suohhiþ.\n4.  **Ending Change:** The PGmc ending *-iþ* becomes **-it** in Old High German.\n    *   *suohhiþ → *suohhit.\n5.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The *i* in the ending *-it* causes umlaut on the preceding diphthong *uo*, which becomes **üe**.\n    *   *suohhit → süehhit.\n6.  **Final Old High German Form:** The spelling varies, but a phonologically transparent form is *suehhit*.\n    *   **Old High German: suehhit**\n\n### **Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sōkiþ\n*   **Old Norse:** sœkir\n*   **Old English:** sēċeþ\n*   **Old High German:** suehhit\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkiþ; Old Norse: sœkir; Old English: sēċeþ; Old High German: suehhit>>>"
