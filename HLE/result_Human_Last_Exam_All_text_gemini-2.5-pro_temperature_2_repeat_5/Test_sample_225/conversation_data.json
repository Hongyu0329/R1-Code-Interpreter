    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve:** The given curve is a parametric curve defined by `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`. This is a specific type of Lissajous curve. We want to find the number of points where the curve crosses itself.\n\n2.  **Period of the Curve:** The period of `x(t) = cos(9t)` is `T_x = 2π/9`. The period of `y(t) = sin(5t)` is `T_y = 2π/5`. The entire curve traces itself completely over the interval `t ∈ [0, T]`, where `T` is the least common multiple (LCM) of `T_x` and `T_y`.\n    `T = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1 / GCF(9, 5)) = 2π * (1/1) = 2π`.\n    So, we need to find self-intersections for `t` in the interval `[0, 2π)`.\n\n3.  **Condition for Self-Intersection:** A self-intersection occurs at a point `(x, y)` if the curve passes through this point at two different times, `t1` and `t2`, within the interval `[0, 2π)`.\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    `x(t1) = x(t2)`  => `cos(9t1) = cos(9t2)`\n    `y(t1) = y(t2)`  => `sin(5t1) = sin(5t2)`\n    where `t1 ≠ t2`.\n\n4.  **Categorize Intersection Points:** The self-intersection points can be categorized into two groups:\n    a) **Interior intersections:** Points that lie strictly inside the bounding box `[-1, 1] x [-1, 1]`.\n    b) **Axial intersections:** Points that lie on the x-axis or y-axis.\n\n5.  **Calculate Interior Intersections:**\n    For a Lissajous curve of the form `x(t) = sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`, where `a` and `b` are coprime integers, the number of interior self-intersection points is given by the formula: `N_interior = (a-1)(b-1)/2`.\n    Our curve `x(t) = cos(9t) = sin(9t + π/2)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)` fits this form with `a=9`, `b=5`, and `δ=π/2`. Since `gcd(9, 5) = 1`, we can use the formula.\n    `N_interior = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2 = (8)(4) / 2 = 16`.\n    So, there are 16 interior self-intersection points.\n\n6.  **Calculate Axial Intersections:**\n    a) **Intersections on the x-axis (y=0):**\n    This occurs when `sin(5t) = 0`, which means `5t = kπ` for some integer `k`. So, `t = kπ/5`.\n    For a self-intersection, we need `cos(9t1) = cos(9t2)` for two different times `t1 = k1π/5` and `t2 = k2π/5` in `[0, 2π)`.\n    This means `k1` and `k2` must be different integers from `0` to `9`.\n    The condition becomes `cos(9k1π/5) = cos(9k2π/5)`.\n    Using the identity `cos(θ) = cos(2πn ± θ)`, we look for `9k1π/5 = 2nπ ± 9k2π/5`. This simplifies to `cos(α) = cos(β)` if `α=β` or `α=2π-β`. We need `cos(9k1π/5) = cos(18π - 9k1π/5) = cos(-9k1π/5) = cos(9(10-k1)π/5)`.\n    So, if `k2 = 10 - k1`, the x-coordinates are equal. We form pairs `(k1, k2)` with `k1 < k2`:\n    *   `(k1, k2) = (1, 9)` -> `t = π/5`, `9π/5`. Point: `(cos(9π/5), 0)`.\n    *   `(k1, k2) = (2, 8)` -> `t = 2π/5`, `8π/5`. Point: `(cos(18π/5), 0) = (cos(8π/5), 0)`.\n    *   `(k1, k2) = (3, 7)` -> `t = 3π/5`, `7π/5`. Point: `(cos(27π/5), 0) = (cos(7π/5), 0)`.\n    *   `(k1, k2) = (4, 6)` -> `t = 4π/5`, `6π/5`. Point: `(cos(36π/5), 0) = (cos(6π/5), 0)`.\n    The x-coordinates `cos(9π/5), cos(8π/5), cos(7π/5), cos(6π/5)` are all distinct. Thus, there are **4** self-intersection points on the x-axis.\n\n    b) **Intersections on the y-axis (x=0):**\n    This occurs when `cos(9t) = 0`, which means `9t = (k + 1/2)π`, so `t = (2k+1)π/18`.\n    For a self-intersection, we need `sin(5t1) = sin(5t2)` for `t1 = (2k1+1)π/18` and `t2 = (2k2+1)π/18`. The integers `k1, k2` range from `0` to `17` to cover `t` in `[0, 2π)`.\n    The condition `sin(α) = sin(β)` requires `α = β + 2nπ` (which implies `t1=t2`) or `α = π - β + 2nπ`.\n    So, `5t1 = π - 5t2 + 2nπ`.\n    `5[(2k1+1)π/18] + 5[(2k2+1)π/18] = (2n+1)π`.\n    `5(2k1 + 1 + 2k2 + 1) = 18(2n+1)`.\n    `10(k1 + k2 + 1) = 18(2n+1)`.\n    `5(k1 + k2 + 1) = 9(2n+1)`.\n    Since 5 and 9 are coprime, `(k1+k2+1)` must be a multiple of 9, and `(2n+1)` must be a multiple of 5.\n    Let `k1+k2+1 = 9j`. Since `0 ≤ k1, k2 ≤ 17`, we have `1 ≤ k1+k2+1 ≤ 35`.\n    Possible values for `9j` are 9, 18, 27. So `j` can be 1, 2, or 3.\n    Also, `2n+1 = 5j`, so `j` must be odd. Thus, `j=1` or `j=3`.\n    *   **Case j=1:** `k1+k2+1=9` => `k1+k2=8`. Pairs `(k1,k2)` with `k1<k2`: `(0,8), (1,7), (2,6), (3,5)`. These generate 4 distinct y-values `sin(5π/18), sin(15π/18), sin(25π/18), sin(35π/18)`. So, 4 points.\n    *   **Case j=3:** `k1+k2+1=27` => `k1+k2=26`. Pairs `(k1,k2)` with `k1<k2`: `(9,17), (10,16), (11,15), (12,14)`. These generate the 4 corresponding negative y-values. So, another 4 distinct points.\n    In total, there are **8** self-intersection points on the y-axis.\n\n7.  **Total Number of Self-Intersections:**\n    The total number of self-intersection points is the sum of the interior intersections and the axial intersections. We assume no triple or higher-order intersection points, which is a safe assumption for Lissajous curves with coprime frequency ratios.\n    Total = `N_interior + N_xaxis + N_yaxis`\n    Total = `16 + 4 + 8 = 28`."
