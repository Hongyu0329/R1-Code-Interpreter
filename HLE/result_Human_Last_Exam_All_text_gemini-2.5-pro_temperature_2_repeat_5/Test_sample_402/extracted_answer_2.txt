A filtering strategy where a gene is removed from the differential expression list if its `log2FoldChange` is greater than a high threshold (e.g., 5) AND its average normalized count in the clean reference group (`CAR-IL15` samples) is below a low threshold (e.g., 10). This can be implemented with the command: `awk -F'\t' 'NR==1 || !($3 > 5 && $7 < 10)' DE_results.tsv > DE_results_filtered.tsv`, where `$3` is the `log2FoldChange` column and `$7` is the mean count column for the uncontaminated samples.
