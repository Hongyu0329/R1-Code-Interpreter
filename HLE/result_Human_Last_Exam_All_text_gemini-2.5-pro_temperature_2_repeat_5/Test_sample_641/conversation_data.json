    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group and the question**\n\n*   **The Group:** PSU(n, q), also denoted as PSU(n, q²), is the Projective Special Unitary Group. It is defined over the finite field `F_q²`. In this problem, `n=4` and `q=997`. The group is PSU(4, 997).\n*   **Involution:** An involution in a group `G` is an element `g` such that `g² = 1` and `g ≠ 1`. In other words, it is an element of order 2.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the total number of such elements in the group PSU(4, 997).\n\n**Step 2: Relate involutions in PSU(4, q) to elements in SU(4, q)**\n\nThe group PSU(4, q) is the quotient of the Special Unitary Group SU(4, q) by its center, Z(SU(4, q)).\nLet `g = A * Z` be an element of PSU(4, q), where `A` is a matrix in SU(4, q) and `Z` is the center.\nThe condition `g² = 1` (where 1 is the identity in PSU) translates to `(A * Z)² = A² * Z = Z`. This implies that `A²` must be an element of the center `Z`.\nThe condition `g ≠ 1` means `A * Z ≠ Z`, which implies `A` is not in the center `Z`.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the center Z(SU(4, 997))**\n\nThe center `Z` of SU(n, q) consists of scalar matrices `cI` such that:\n1.  `cI ∈ SU(n, q)`, which means `det(cI) = c^n = 1`.\n2.  `cI ∈ U(n, q)`, which means `c^(q+1) = 1` (this comes from the property that for scalar matrices `cI`, being unitary means `(cI)(cI)^H = c * c^q * I = I`, so `c^(q+1)=1`).\n\nFor our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. We need scalars `c ∈ F_{997^2}` such that `c⁴ = 1` and `c^(997+1) = c^998 = 1`.\nThe number of such scalars is given by `d = gcd(n, q+1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\n`998 = 2 * 499`. Since 499 is a prime number, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nSo, the center `Z` has order 2. The elements are the solutions to `c²=1`, which are `c=1` and `c=-1`.\nThus, `Z(SU(4, 997)) = {I, -I}`.\n\n**Step 4: Find matrices A in SU(4, q) that satisfy the conditions**\n\nWe are looking for elements `A ∈ SU(4, 997)` such that `A ∉ {I, -I}` and `A² ∈ {I, -I}`.\n\n*   **Case 1: A² = -I**\n\nLet `A` be a unitary matrix. Any eigenvalue `λ` of `A` must satisfy `λ^(q+1) = 1`.\nIf `A² = -I`, then any eigenvalue `λ` of `A` must satisfy `λ² = -1`.\nThe base field is `F_q = F_997`. Since `997 ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, `-1` is a quadratic residue modulo 997. This means the equation `x² = -1` has two solutions in `F_997`, let's call them `j` and `-j`. These are elements of the subfield `F_q`.\nSo, if `A` has an eigenvalue `λ`, it must be either `j` or `-j`. Since `j, -j ∈ F_q`, their `q`-th power is themselves (`λ^q = λ`).\nNow we check the unitary condition: `λ^(q+1) = λ * λ^q = λ * λ = λ² = 1`.\nBut from `A² = -I`, we have `λ² = -1`.\nThis leads to `1 = -1`, a contradiction since the characteristic of the field is not 2.\nThis means no such eigenvalue `λ` can exist. A matrix must have eigenvalues in the algebraic closure of its field, and in this case, the potential eigenvalues are in the field `F_{q^2}` itself. The contradiction means no such matrix `A` can exist in GU(4, 997). Therefore, there are no solutions to `A² = -I` in SU(4, 997).\n\n*   **Case 2: A² = I**\n\nWe are looking for elements `A ∈ SU(4, 997)` such that `A² = I` and `A ∉ {I, -I}`.\nSuch a matrix `A` is an involution in SU(4, q). As a unitary matrix, `A` is diagonalizable. Its eigenvalues must be `+1` or `-1`.\nLet `k` be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue `-1`. The dimension of the eigenspace `V_{-1}` is `k`.\nSince `A ∈ SU(4, q)`, its determinant must be 1. `det(A) = (-1)^k = 1`, so `k` must be an even number.\nThe possible values for `k` are 0, 2, 4.\n*   If `k=0`, `A` has only eigenvalue `1`. Being diagonalizable, `A=I`. This is in the center.\n*   If `k=4`, `A` has only eigenvalue `-1`. `A=-I`. This is also in the center.\n*   If `k=2`, `A` has eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}`. `A` is not a scalar matrix, so `A ∉ {I, -I}`.\n    These are precisely the elements we need to count. Such matrices form a single conjugacy class in SU(4, q).\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of relevant elements and corresponding involutions in PSU(4, q)**\n\nLet `C` be the conjugacy class of matrices in SU(4, q) with eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}`.\nThe size of this class is given by the formula: `|C| = |GU(4,q)| / |GU(2,q) × GU(2,q)|`.\nUsing the formula for the order of a general unitary group `|GU(n,q)| = q^(n(n-1)/2) * Π_{i=1 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`:\n`|GU(4,q)| = q^6(q+1)(q²-1)(q³+1)(q⁴-1)`\n`|GU(2,q)| = q(q+1)(q²-1)`\n`|C| = (q^6(q+1)(q²-1)(q³+1)(q⁴-1)) / (q(q+1)(q²-1))²`\n`|C| = (q^6(q³+1)(q⁴-1)) / (q²(q+1)(q²-1))`\n`|C| = q⁴ * ( (q+1)(q²-q+1) * (q²-1)(q²+1) ) / ( (q+1)(q²-1) )`\n`|C| = q⁴(q²-q+1)(q²+1)`.\n\nLet `q=997`. The number of these matrices `A` is `N = 997⁴(997² - 997 + 1)(997² + 1)`.\n\nThese `N` matrices give rise to involutions in PSU(4, 997). The involutions are the cosets `A*Z`.\nFor any `A` in this class `C`, the matrix `-A` is also in `C`. This is because `-A` has eigenvalues `{-1, -1, 1, 1}`, which is the same set. Also `det(-A)=(-1)⁴ det(A) = det(A)=1`, so `-A` is also in SU(4, q).\nThe elements `A` and `-A` are distinct (since `A≠0`). They belong to the same coset, `A * Z = {A, -A}`.\nSo, the `N` matrices in the class `C` form `N/2` distinct cosets in PSU(4, q).\nThese `N/2` cosets form a single conjugacy class of involutions in PSU(4, q), and since Case 1 was empty, this is the total number of involutions.\n\nThe number of involutions is `N/2 = (1/2) * q⁴(q²-q+1)(q²+1)`.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\nFor `q=997`, the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is given by the formula:\n`1/2 * 997⁴ * (997² + 1) * (997² - 997 + 1)`\n\nThis is the numerical answer expressed as a formula. Evaluating this would result in a very large integer.\nNumber of involutions = `(997^4 * (994009 + 1) * (994009 - 997 + 1)) / 2`\n= `(997^4 * 994010 * 993013) / 2`\n= `997^4 * 497005 * 993013`\n\nThis represents the final answer."
