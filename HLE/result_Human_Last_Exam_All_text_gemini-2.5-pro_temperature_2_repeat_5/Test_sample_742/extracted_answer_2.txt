No. It is not possible. The two frameworks, Gödel's modal logic and the mathematics of quantum mechanics, are conceptually incommensurable. Gödel's key concepts, such as "positive properties" and "necessary existence as a property," have no natural representation in the Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics. Moreover, the definition of a God-like being as possessing all positive properties, if translated into physical terms, would directly violate the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, a fundamental theorem of quantum mechanics.
