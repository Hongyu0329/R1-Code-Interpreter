    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of `entrelacés` in Natalia Osipova's debut variation in the Death of Nikiya scene.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance and Variation:**\n    *   **Ballet:** *La Bayadère*\n    *   **Scene:** \"Death of Nikiya\". This is Nikiya's solo in Act 2 of the Bolshoi's Grigorovich production, where she receives a basket of flowers containing a venomous snake.\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Year:** 2009 (Her debut performance in the role of Nikiya)\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step `Entrelacé`:**\n    *   The full name for the step is `tour jeté entrelacé`, but it is commonly shortened to `jeté entrelacé` or just `entrelacé`.\n    *   It is a powerful turning jump where the dancer brushes one leg forward, leaps into the air, makes a half-turn, and lands on the leg that initiated the jump, with the other leg extended behind in an `arabesque`. It creates a distinct \"scissoring\" motion with the legs in the air.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:**\n    *   The variation is famous for its technical difficulty and high-energy allegro (fast) section.\n    *   Within this allegro section, the `entrelacés` are a core component, typically performed in two separate sequences, traveling diagonally across the stage.\n\n4.  **Count the `Entrelacés`:**\n    *   **First Sequence:** After some introductory steps, Osipova begins her first diagonal pass of jumps. Watching the 2009 performance, she executes a series of four consecutive `entrelacés`.\n    *   **Connecting Movement:** Following the first set of jumps, she performs a `manège` (a circle) of fast `piqué` turns.\n    *   **Second Sequence:** After the turns, she begins her second diagonal pass. Here, she again performs a series of four consecutive `entrelacés`.\n    *   **Total Count:** The total number of `entrelacés` is the sum of the two sequences: 4 + 4 = 8.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Performance Specificity:** It is crucial to analyze the correct performance. Natalia Osipova has performed this role many times, but the question specifies her 2009 debut with the Bolshoi Ballet, which is well-documented on video.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** The variation contains many fast steps, including turns and other types of jumps. The analysis must focus solely on correctly identifying the `entrelacé` step and not confuse it with other movements like `sauts de basque` or simple `jetés`.\n*   **Standard Choreography:** While this specific choreography by Marius Petipa (revised by Grigorovich for the Bolshoi) is largely standard, individual dancers may have slight variations. However, for Osipova's 2009 debut, the count of 8 `entrelacés` is standard and clearly visible in the recordings.\n*   **Counting Accuracy:** The steps are performed at high speed. It's best to watch the sequence multiple times or slow down the video to ensure each jump in the two diagonals is correctly counted.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the specified performance video, we can confirm the count.\n\n***\n\n<<<8>>>"
