    "This question requires a step-by-step analysis of music theory and knowledge of The Beatles' discography.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Music Theory Terms\n*   **Tonic Chord (I or i):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It is built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of G major, the tonic is a G major chord (I). In the key of A minor, the tonic is an A minor chord (i).\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is a minor chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n    *   In a major key like G major, the fifth note is D. The natural dominant chord is D major (V). A \"minor fifth chord\" (v) would be D minor, which uses a note (F-natural) from outside the G major scale. This is known as a \"borrowed\" chord.\n    *   In a minor key like A minor, the fifth note is E. The natural dominant chord is E minor (v). This chord is diatonic (it uses notes only from the A natural minor scale). Often, this chord is changed to E major (V) to create a stronger resolution back to the tonic, but the natural E minor (v) is also common.\n*   **Chord Jump:** This implies a direct and prominent change from one chord to the next, especially at the very beginning of a song.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Progression (Tonic to Minor Fifth)\nWe are looking for a song that starts with one of two progressions:\n1.  **I → v** (in a major key)\n2.  **i → v** (in a minor key)\n\nThe i → v progression is more common in popular music than I → v. This makes it more likely we are looking for a song in a minor key.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Potential Candidate Songs\nLet's consider songs by The Beatles that have distinctive opening progressions, particularly those in a minor key.\n\n*   **\"Michelle\":** This is often a first guess because of its well-known minor key feel (F minor). The tonic (i) is F minor, and the minor fifth (v) would be C minor. However, the song begins with an instrumental guitar riff. The harmony under this riff is an F minor tonic with a descending bassline that leads to the dominant (C7), not the minor fifth (Cm). The first vocal line also stays on the tonic. Therefore, \"Michelle\" does not start with the requested chord jump.\n\n*   **\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\":** The song is in A minor. The tonic (i) is A minor. The minor fifth (v) is E minor. The famous intro is a piano line over an A minor chord. The verse progression is Am → G → C → E (i → VII → III → V), not i → v.\n\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\":** This song is from the album *A Hard Day's Night*.\n    *   **Key:** A minor. The tonic chord (i) is A minor (Am).\n    *   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** The fifth note of A is E, so the minor fifth chord is E minor (Em).\n    *   **Opening of the song:** The song begins with a stark, strummed A minor chord, followed immediately by the verse.\n    *   **First Chord Change:** The lyrics for the first line are sung over the following chords:\n        `(Am) You say you will love me, if (Em) I have to go.`\n    *   This is a perfect match. The song begins with its main theme, and the very first chord change is a jump from the tonic (A minor) to the minor fifth chord (E minor).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe song \"Things We Said Today\" precisely fits the description. It is in a minor key (A minor), and its opening musical phrase is defined by the chord jump from the tonic (Am) to the minor fifth (Em).\n\n<<<Things We Said Today>>>"
