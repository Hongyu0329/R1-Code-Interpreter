    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules\nThe algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a finite-dimensional, hereditary algebra of Dynkin type $A_3$. It is of finite representation type, meaning there are only a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n\nThe indecomposable modules can be represented by their dimension vectors $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$, where $d_i$ is the dimension of the vector space at vertex $i$. The indecomposable modules correspond to contiguous intervals of vertices. We denote the module with support on vertices $i, i+1, \\dots, j$ as $M_{ij}$.\nThe 6 indecomposable modules are:\n1.  $S_1 = M_{11} = (1,0,0)$. This is a simple module and also the injective module $I_1$.\n2.  $S_2 = M_{22} = (0,1,0)$. This is a simple module.\n3.  $S_3 = M_{33} = (0,0,1)$. This is a simple module and also the projective module $P_3$.\n4.  $P_2 = M_{23} = (0,1,1)$. This is the projective cover of $S_2$ and $S_3$.\n5.  $I_2 = M_{12} = (1,1,0)$. This is the injective hull of $S_1$ and $S_2$.\n6.  $P_1 = M_{13} = (1,1,1)$. This is the projective cover of $S_1$. It is also the injective module $I_3$.\n\n### Step 2: Define $\\tau$-tilting and Slice Modules\n*   **$\\tau$-tilting Module**: For a hereditary algebra like $A$, a module $T$ is a $\\tau$-tilting module if it is a classical tilting module. This means:\n    1.  $T$ is the direct sum of $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable modules. (Here $n$ is the number of simple modules).\n    2.  $Ext^1_A(T, T) = 0$. Since $A$ is hereditary, indecomposable modules have no self-extensions ($Ext^1_A(M,M)=0$ for $M$ indecomposable). So this condition simplifies to $Ext^1_A(T_i, T_j) = 0$ for all distinct indecomposable summands $T_i, T_j$ of $T$.\n\n*   **Slice Module**: A slice module is a tilting module $T = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n T_i$ where the set of its indecomposable summands $\\{T_1, \\dots, T_n\\}$ forms a **slice** in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver of $A$. A slice is a set of vertices in the AR quiver such that there are no irreducible morphisms between any two vertices in the set. Visually, a slice cuts the AR-quiver into two parts without containing any arrows.\n\n### Step 3: The Auslander-Reiten (AR) Quiver\nTo check the slice condition, we need the AR-quiver for $A = \\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$. For a path algebra of type $A_n$ with linear orientation, the AR-quiver has a triangular shape. For $A_3$, it is:\n```\n           P₁ (1,1,1)\n          /   \\\n        P₂ (0,1,1)   I₂ (1,1,0)\n       /  \\   /  \\\n      S₃ (0,0,1)  S₂ (0,1,0)  S₁ (1,0,0)\n```\nThe arrows represent irreducible morphisms. Specifically, the irreducible maps are: $S_3 \\to P_2$, $S_2 \\to P_2$, $S_2 \\to I_2$, $S_1 \\to I_2$, $P_2 \\to P_1$, and $I_2 \\to P_1$.\n\n### Step 4: Identify Tilting Modules\nWe need to find combinations of three distinct indecomposable modules $T = T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3$ such that $Ext^1(T_i, T_j)=0$ for all $i,j$.\nA standard example of a tilting module is the projective generator $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$. Here $P_3 = S_3$. So $T_{proj} = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_3$ is a tilting module. The set of summands $\\{P_1, P_2, S_3\\}$ forms a slice in the AR quiver (they form the left edge of the triangle and there are no irreducible maps between them). Thus, $T_{proj}$ is a slice module.\n\nAnother standard example is the injective cogenerator $D(A) = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3$. Here $I_1=S_1, I_3=P_1$. So $T_{inj} = S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1$ is a tilting module (also called a cotilting module). Its summands $\\{S_1, I_2, P_1\\}$ form a slice (the right edge of the triangle). Thus, $T_{inj}$ is a slice module.\n\n### Step 5: Search for a non-slice tilting module\nA common way to find new tilting modules is through mutation. Let's mutate the projective tilting module $T_{proj} = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_3$ at the summand $S_3=P_3$. Since $S_3$ is a simple projective module, this is an APR-tilt. The new module summand is the cokernel of the minimal approximation of $S_3$ by modules in $add(P_1 \\oplus P_2)$.\nThe minimal approximation of $S_3$ is given by its inclusion into its injective hull if that's in the subcategory, or more generally by mapping into modules whose socle contains $S_3$. Here, $soc(P_2)=S_3$. The inclusion map $f: S_3 \\to P_2$ is a minimal right $add(P_1 \\oplus P_2)$-approximation of $S_3$.\nThe mutation recipe gives rise to the short exact sequence:\n$0 \\to S_3 \\xrightarrow{f} P_2 \\to S_2 \\to 0$\nThe new indecomposable summand is the cokernel, which is $S_2$.\nSo, the mutated module is $T_{mut} = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$.\n\nLet's verify if $T_{mut}$ is a tilting module:\n*   Its summands are $P_1$, $P_2$, $S_2$. They are 3 distinct indecomposable modules.\n*   We need to check $Ext^1$ groups. Any pair involving a projective module ($P_1$ or $P_2$) as the first argument has a vanishing $Ext^1$. We only need to check $Ext^1(S_2, P_1)$ and $Ext^1(S_2, P_2)$.\n    *   $Ext^1(S_2, P_2)$: From the projective resolution of $S_2$, $0 \\to S_3 \\to P_2 \\to S_2 \\to 0$, we apply $Hom(-, P_2)$ to get the long exact sequence. This yields $Ext^1(S_2, P_2)=0$.\n    *   $Ext^1(S_2, P_1)$: Applying $Hom(-, P_1)$ to the same resolution yields $Ext^1(S_2, P_1)=0$.\n*   Thus, $T_{mut} = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$ is a tilting module.\n\nNow, we check if $T_{mut}$ is a slice module.\nThe summands are $\\{P_1, P_2, S_2\\}$. Looking at the AR-quiver, there is an irreducible map $S_2 \\to P_2$. Since two of the summands are connected by an irreducible map, this set is not a slice.\nTherefore, $P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$ is a $\\tau$-tilting module which is not a slice module.\n\n### Step 6: Justify Uniqueness\nThe word \"unique\" in the question suggests this module is special. While there are other non-slice tilting modules (e.g., $S_3 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus I_2$ and $P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$), the module $P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$ is uniquely characterized as being the APR-tilt of the basic tilting module $A=P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ at the simple projective module $P_3=S_3$. This is the most canonical example of a tilting module which is not a slice module, obtained by the simplest mutation from the standard projective generator. The question is likely asking for this canonical representative.\n\nThe module $P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$ consists of the two non-simple projectives and the simple module \"in between\" them."
