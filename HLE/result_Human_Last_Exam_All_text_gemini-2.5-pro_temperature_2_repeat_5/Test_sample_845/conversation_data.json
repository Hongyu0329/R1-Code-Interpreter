    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Concepts:** The question asks for the name of a specific value used in heart monitoring. Let's break down the provided information:\n    *   **Topic:** Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) monitoring.\n    *   **Measurement Method:** Photoplethysmography (PPG), which uses light to detect blood volume changes. This is common in smartwatches and fitness trackers.\n    *   **Fundamental Data:** The system captures \"beat-to-beat intervals.\" This means it measures the time elapsed between one heartbeat and the very next one.\n    *   **Core Question:** HRV is computed from this specific value. What is the name of this value (the time between heartbeats)?\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **ECG vs. PPG:** The \"gold standard\" for measuring heart activity is an Electrocardiogram (ECG), which records the heart's electrical signals. On an ECG waveform, the most prominent spike, representing ventricular depolarization, is called the \"R-wave.\" The interval between two consecutive R-waves is the foundational measurement. PPG, on the other hand, measures the resulting blood pulse wave. While the source is different (electrical vs. blood flow), both methods aim to measure the time between consecutive cardiac cycles.\n2.  **Terminology Nuances:** Because the terminology originated with ECGs, the terms are often used interchangeably, even when the data comes from a PPG sensor.\n3.  **Raw vs. Cleaned Data:** In real-world data, some beats might be abnormal (e.g., arrhythmias) or the sensor might record an error (an artifact). For accurate HRV analysis, these bad beats are typically filtered out. This leads to slightly different names for the intervals depending on whether they are raw or cleaned.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: A Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  The question asks for the name of the time interval between consecutive heartbeats.\n2.  In the context of clinical cardiology and HRV research, this interval is most classically and commonly measured using an ECG. The time from the peak of one R-wave to the peak of the next is measured.\n3.  Therefore, this fundamental value is called the **R-R interval**.\n4.  Even when using PPG, which measures the \"Inter-Beat Interval\" (IBI) between pulse peaks, the term **R-R interval** is still widely used in the context of HRV because it refers to the same underlying physiological event that the PPG sensor is estimating.\n5.  Another very common and technically accurate term, especially in the context of consumer devices using PPG, is **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n6.  When data is cleaned to remove artifacts and abnormal beats, the resulting intervals used for HRV calculation are often called **NN intervals** (Normal-to-Normal intervals).\n7.  However, the most fundamental and universally recognized term for the raw beat-to-beat time measurement is the **R-R interval**. It is the direct answer to \"what is the value between heartbeats called?\" from which HRV is computed.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
