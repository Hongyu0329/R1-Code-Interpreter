    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the differential equation and the function f(x).**\nThe given autonomous differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\nThis can be written in the form $x'(t) = f(x(t))$, where the function $f(x)$ is:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n\n**2. Find the equilibrium points.**\nEquilibrium points are the constant solutions of the differential equation, which are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. This means we need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\nWe can factor out a $-x$ from the expression:\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\nThe quadratic term in the parentheses is a perfect square: $(x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$\nThe solutions to this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the two equilibrium points.\n\n**3. Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x_0$ can be determined by the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at that point, $f'(x_0)$.\n*   If $f'(x_0) < 0$, the equilibrium point is stable (it's an attractor).\n*   If $f'(x_0) > 0$, the equilibrium point is unstable (it's a repeller).\n*   If $f'(x_0) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive, and we must use another method, such as analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ around the equilibrium point.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n*   **For the equilibrium point x = 0:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point x = 1:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n\n**4. Sign analysis for the equilibrium point x = 1.**\nThe function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\nThe term $(x-1)^2$ is always non-negative. It is positive for all $x \\neq 1$ and zero for $x=1$. Therefore, the sign of $f(x)$ for $x \\neq 1$ is determined by the sign of $-x$.\n\n*   **To the left of x = 1 (but still positive, e.g., $x=0.5$):**\n    For $x$ in the interval $(0, 1)$, $-x$ is negative and $(x-1)^2$ is positive.\n    So, $f(x) = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$.\n    This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from $x=1$ and towards $x=0$.\n\n*   **To the right of x = 1 (e.g., $x=2$):**\n    For $x > 1$, $-x$ is negative and $(x-1)^2$ is positive.\n    So, $f(x) = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$.\n    This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards $x=1$.\n\nSince solutions starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the point is not stable. This type of equilibrium is called semi-stable. Semi-stable points are classified as unstable.\n\n**5. Count the number of stable equilibrium points (m).**\nBased on our analysis:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is a semi-stable (and therefore unstable) equilibrium point.\n\nThe number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, is 1.\nSo, $m = 1$.\n\n**6. Calculate the final expression.**\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$:\n$m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Correctly factorize $f(x)$ to find all equilibrium points.\n*   Remember the conditions for stability using the first derivative test ($f'(x_0) < 0$ for stable, $f'(x_0) > 0$ for unstable).\n*   Recognize that when $f'(x_0) = 0$, the test is inconclusive and another method is required.\n*   The sign analysis of $f(x)$ around the point $x=1$ is crucial to correctly classify its stability.\n*   Understand that semi-stable equilibria are considered unstable. Thus, only fully stable equilibria (attractors from all sides) count towards $m$.\n*   Perform the final calculation correctly.\n\nThe final answer is $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
