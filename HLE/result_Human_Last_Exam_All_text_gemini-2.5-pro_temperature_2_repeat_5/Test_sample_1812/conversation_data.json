    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe question asks for the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix, `A`. It also provides context that this is the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The primary task is to calculate the determinant of the matrix `A` that is explicitly provided.\n2.  **Contextual Information:** The phrase \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" provides the origin of the matrix. However, since the matrix `A` is given, we do not need to derive it from this context. The problem is a direct computation of `det(A)`. The information about the Markov quiver and `m_{1/2}` is extraneous to the calculation itself.\n3.  **Matrix Structure:** The matrix `A` is a 3x3 symmetric matrix.\n4.  **Calculation Method:** We can use several methods to find the determinant of a 3x3 matrix, such as the standard cofactor expansion (or the Rule of Sarrus) or using row operations. Using multiple methods can serve as a good verification of the result.\n5.  **Arithmetic Precision:** The calculation involves handling negative signs, so care must be taken to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n---\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nThe given matrix is:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWe will compute the determinant using the standard formula for a 3x3 matrix (cofactor expansion along the first row).\nThe formula is:\n\\[\n\\det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\\]\nFor our matrix:\n`a = 2`, `b = -1`, `c = -1`\n`d = -1`, `e = 2`, `f = -1`\n`g = -1`, `h = -1`, `i = 2`\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the first term**\n\\[\na(ei - fh) = 2 \\times ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1))\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2 \\times (4 - 1)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2 \\times 3 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the second term**\n\\[\n-b(di - fg) = -(-1) \\times ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1))\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 \\times (-2 - 1)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 \\times (-3) = -3\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the third term**\n\\[\nc(dh - eg) = (-1) \\times ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))\n\\]\n\\[\n= -1 \\times (1 - (-2))\n\\]\n\\[\n= -1 \\times (1 + 2)\n\\]\n\\[\n= -1 \\times 3 = -3\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Sum the terms to find the determinant**\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Verification (Alternative Method)\nAnother way to analyze this is to look for linear dependencies between the rows or columns. Let R1, R2, and R3 be the row vectors.\n*   R1 = [2, -1, -1]\n*   R2 = [-1, 2, -1]\n*   R3 = [-1, -1, 2]\n\nLet's add the three rows together:\nR1 + R2 + R3 = [ (2 - 1 - 1), (-1 + 2 - 1), (-1 - 1 + 2) ] = [0, 0, 0]\n\nSince the sum of the row vectors is the zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent. A fundamental property of determinants is that if the rows (or columns) of a matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is 0.\n\nThis confirms our calculation.\n\nThe final answer is the determinant of the matrix A.\n<<<0>>>"
