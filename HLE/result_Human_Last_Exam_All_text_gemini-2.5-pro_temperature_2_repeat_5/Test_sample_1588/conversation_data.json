    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Expansion**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for `Z` in `exp(Z) = exp(X)exp(Y)`, where `X` and `Y` are non-commuting operators or matrices. The expansion for `Z = log(exp(X)exp(Y))` is a series of commutators of `X` and `Y`:\n\n`Z = X + Y + (1/2)[X,Y] + (1/12)[X,[X,Y]] - (1/12)[Y,[X,Y]] + ...`\n\nThe *order* of a term is its total degree in `X` and `Y`. The terms of a specific order `n` are linear combinations of all possible linearly independent commutators of that order.\n\n**Step 2: Connecting the BCH Expansion to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe terms in the BCH expansion are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by `X` and `Y`, denoted `L(X,Y)`. The terms of order `n` belong to the homogeneous subspace of degree `n`, denoted `L_n(X,Y)`.\n\nThe number of linearly independent commutators of order `n` is equal to the dimension of this subspace, `dim(L_n(X,Y))`.\n\n**Step 3: A Crucial Property of the BCH Formula**\n\nA key result from the theory of Lie algebras (often associated with Dynkin, Specht, and Wever) states that for the specific case of `Z = log(exp(X)exp(Y))`, every basis element of the free Lie algebra `L(X,Y)` appears in the expansion with a **nonzero coefficient**.\n\nTherefore, the problem of finding the number of nonzero coefficients of order `n` is equivalent to finding the dimension of the subspace `L_n(X,Y)`, which is the number of linearly independent commutators of order `n`.\n\n**Step 4: Using Witt's Formula to Find the Dimension**\n\nThe dimension of the homogeneous subspace of degree `n` of a free Lie algebra on `m` generators is given by Ernst Witt's formula:\n\n`dim(L_n) = (1/n) * Σ_{k|n} μ(k) * m^(n/k)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order (degree), which is 10 in our case.\n*   `m` is the number of generators, which is 2 (`X` and `Y`).\n*   `k|n` means the sum is over all positive divisors `k` of `n`.\n*   `μ(k)` is the Möbius function.\n\n**Step 5: Applying Witt's Formula for n=10 and m=2**\n\n1.  **Identify the divisors of n=10:** The divisors `k` are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n\n2.  **Calculate the values of the Möbius function `μ(k)`:**\n    *   `μ(1) = 1` (by definition)\n    *   `μ(2) = -1` (2 is a single prime factor)\n    *   `μ(5) = -1` (5 is a single prime factor)\n    *   `μ(10) = μ(2 * 5) = μ(2) * μ(5) = (-1) * (-1) = 1` (10 has two distinct prime factors)\n\n3.  **Plug the values into Witt's formula:**\n    `dim(L_10) = (1/10) * [μ(1) * 2^(10/1) + μ(2) * 2^(10/2) + μ(5) * 2^(10/5) + μ(10) * 2^(10/10)]`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Möbius values:**\n    `dim(L_10) = (1/10) * [1 * 2^10 + (-1) * 2^5 + (-1) * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the powers of 2:**\n    *   `2^10 = 1024`\n    *   `2^5 = 32`\n    *   `2^2 = 4`\n    *   `2^1 = 2`\n\n6.  **Perform the final calculation:**\n    `dim(L_10) = (1/10) * [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]`\n    `dim(L_10) = (1/10) * [988 + 2]`\n    `dim(L_10) = (1/10) * [990]`\n    `dim(L_10) = 99`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of linearly independent commutators of order 10 is 99. Since each of these appears in the BCH expansion with a nonzero coefficient, the total number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is 99.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The specific form of the BCH expansion:** The result that all coefficients are non-zero is specific to `Z = log(exp(X)exp(Y))`. Other related formulas might have zero coefficients.\n*   **Correct application of Witt's formula:** It is essential to use the correct number of generators (`m=2`) and the correct order (`n=10`).\n*   **Möbius function calculation:** A mistake in calculating `μ(k)` would lead to an incorrect result. The key rules are `μ(1)=1`, `μ(p)=-1` for a prime `p`, `μ(p^k)=0` for `k>1`, and `μ(ab)=μ(a)μ(b)` for coprime `a,b`.\n*   **Arithmetic:** Basic arithmetic errors are a potential pitfall in the final calculation.\n\n<<<99>>>"
