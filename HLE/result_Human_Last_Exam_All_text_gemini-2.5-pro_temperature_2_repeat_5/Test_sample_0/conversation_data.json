    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nA critical-level view is a method for ranking populations based on their total value. The value of a population is calculated by summing up the welfare of each individual, but only the welfare that is *above* a certain \"critical level,\" denoted as *c*. For this analysis, we assume a positive critical level (*c* > 0), as this is the standard form of the view that distinguishes it from Classical Utilitarianism (where *c* = 0).\n\nThe value (V) of adding a person with welfare level *u* to a population is given by:\n*V_addition = u - c*\n\nThis means:\n*   If a person's welfare *u* is **greater than** the critical level *c*, adding them makes the population better (a positive contribution).\n*   If a person's welfare *u* is **less than** the critical level *c* (but still positive), adding them makes the population worse (a negative contribution).\n*   If a person's welfare *u* is **equal to** the critical level *c*, adding them has a neutral effect on the population's value.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Condition of the Theorem\n\nWe will now test the critical-level view (*c* > 0) against each of the five conditions provided.\n\n**A. Egalitarian Dominance**\n*   **Condition:** If two populations, A and B, have the same number of people, and everyone in population A is better off than everyone in population B, then population A is better than population B.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's say A has *n* people all at welfare level *u*, and B has *n* people all at welfare level *v*, where *u > v*.\n    *   Value(A) = *n* * (*u* - *c*)\n    *   Value(B) = *n* * (*v* - *c*)\n    *   Since *u > v*, it is always true that (*u* - *c*) > (*v* - *c*). Therefore, Value(A) > Value(B).\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Egalitarian Dominance.\n\n**B. General Non-Extreme Priority**\n*   **Condition:** For **any** two positive welfare levels *u* and *v* (where *u > v > 0*), there is some number of people (*n*) at level *v* that would be a better addition to a population than adding a single person at level *u*.\n*   **Analysis:** This condition states that quantity can always overcome quality for lives worth living. Let's test this with a critical-level view. The condition must hold for *any* choice of *u* and *v*.\n    *   Let's choose *u* to be a welfare level above the critical level (*u > c*) and *v* to be a positive welfare level below the critical level (*0 < v < c*).\n    *   The value of adding one person at level *u* is (*u - c*), which is a **positive** number.\n    *   The value of adding *n* people at level *v* is *n* * (*v - c*). Since *v < c*, the term (*v - c*) is a **negative** number. The total value is therefore negative.\n    *   The condition requires us to find a number *n* such that the addition of *n* people at *v* is better than one person at *u*. This means `n * (v - c) > (u - c)`.\n    *   This is impossible, as a negative number (`n * (v - c)`) can never be greater than a positive number (`u - c`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Because we found a case where the condition fails, critical-level views **violate** General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\n**C. Non-Elitism**\n*   **Condition:** There exists some very high welfare level *u* and a slightly lower level *v* such that adding a large number of people at level *v* can improve a population of people all at level *u*.\n*   **Analysis:** This condition's key phrase is \"There exists...\". We only need to find one scenario where it holds.\n    *   Let's choose two very high welfare levels, *u* and *v*, that are both **above** the critical level *c*. For example, *u* = 100*c* and *v* = 90*c*.\n    *   The value of adding *n* people at level *v* is *n* * (*v* - *c*). Since we chose *v > c*, this value is positive.\n    *   Adding a positive value to any population's total value makes it better. Therefore, it is possible to improve the initial population.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Non-Elitism.\n\n**D. Weak Non-Sadism**\n*   **Condition:** Adding people with negative welfare (i.e., lives not worth living) is never better than the initial state.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's add *n* people with a negative welfare level, *w* < 0.\n    *   The value of this addition is *n* * (*w* - *c*).\n    *   Since *w* is negative and *c* is positive, (*w* - *c*) is a large negative number. Therefore, the value added is always negative.\n    *   Adding a negative value never improves the total value of the population.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n**E. Weak Quality Addition**\n*   **Condition:** There is at least one situation where adding a person with positive welfare improves the population.\n*   **Analysis:** We just need to find one case.\n    *   Let's choose to add one person with a welfare level *u* that is above the critical level (*u > c*).\n    *   The value of this addition is (*u* - *c*), which is a positive number.\n    *   Adding this person improves the population's total value.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Quality Addition.\n\n### Final Answer Determination\n\nThe only condition that critical-level views violate is General Non-Extreme Priority. This is because the critical level creates a sharp dividing line; for lives below this level (but still positive), adding more people is always considered a bad thing, which directly contradicts the idea that any positive quality level can be compensated for by a sufficient quantity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
