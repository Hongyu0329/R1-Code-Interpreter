The table must change its shape. Specifically, when the sun rises and exposes the table to UV light, it should physically bend or fold (imitating the *trans* to *cis* isomerization). When the sun sets and the light is gone, it should straighten back out to its original, more linear shape (imitating the thermal relaxation from *cis* back to *trans*).
