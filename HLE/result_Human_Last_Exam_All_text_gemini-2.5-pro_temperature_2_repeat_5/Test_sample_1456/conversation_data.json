    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a sphere, etc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the set of all points `x` in `X` such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `p` and `x`. A subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not the entire space `X`. The collection of all composants of `X` forms a partition of `X`.\n*   **Product of Continua:** If `X` and `Y` are continua, their product `X x Y` with the product topology is also a continuum.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the number of composants to the structure of the continuum\nThe number of composants a continuum has is deeply connected to whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, i.e., `X = A U B` where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X`.\n    *   **Theorem:** A nondegenerate continuum has **exactly one** composant if and only if it is decomposable. In this case, the single composant is the entire space itself.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum is indecomposable if it is not decomposable.\n    *   **Theorem:** A nondegenerate continuum has **uncountably many** composants if and only if it is indecomposable. The number of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (i.e., the size of the set of real numbers, `|R|`, also written as `2^{\\aleph_0}`).\n\n### Step 3: Frame the question in terms of decomposability\nThe problem asks for the **largest possible number** of composants for the product `Z = X x Y`, where `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua.\n\nFrom Step 2, the number of composants for `Z` can be:\n*   `1`, if `Z` is decomposable.\n*   `c` (uncountably many), if `Z` is indecomposable.\n\nClearly, `c` is larger than `1`. So, the question is equivalent to asking: **Can the product `X x Y` of two nondegenerate continua be indecomposable?** If it can, the largest possible number of composants is `c`.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the decomposability of the product space `X x Y`\nThere is a fundamental theorem concerning the decomposability of product spaces:\n\n*   **Theorem:** The product `X x Y` of two continua is indecomposable if and only if **both** `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\nLet's briefly see the easier direction of this theorem. If, say, `X` is decomposable, then `X = A U B` for proper subcontinua `A` and `B`. Then `X x Y = (A x Y) U (B x Y)`. Since `A` is a proper subcontinuum of `X`, `A x Y` is a proper subcontinuum of `X x Y`. Similarly, `B x Y` is a proper subcontinuum of `X x Y`. Thus, `X x Y` is decomposable.\nSo, for `X x Y` to be indecomposable, both `X` and `Y` must be indecomposable.\n\n### Step 5: Construct an example that yields the maximum number\nTo achieve the maximum number of composants (`c`), we need the product `X x Y` to be indecomposable. Based on the theorem in Step 4, this requires us to choose `X` and `Y` to be indecomposable continua.\n\n*   **Do nondegenerate indecomposable continua exist?** Yes. A classic example is the **Knaster continuum** (also known as the bucket-handle continuum) or the **solenoid**. These are well-studied mathematical objects that are proven to be nondegenerate and indecomposable.\n\n*   **Construct the example:**\n    1.  Let `X` be a Knaster continuum. `X` is a nondegenerate and indecomposable continuum.\n    2.  Let `Y` be a Knaster continuum. `Y` is also a nondegenerate and indecomposable continuum.\n    3.  Consider the product space `Z = X x Y`.\n    4.  According to the theorem from Step 4, since both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable, their product `Z` is also indecomposable.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\nSince we have constructed a product `Z = X x Y` which is a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum, we can determine its number of composants.\n\n*   From the theorem in Step 2, any nondegenerate indecomposable continuum has `c` (uncountably many) composants.\n*   Therefore, the space `Z` we constructed has `c` composants.\n*   Since the only possible numbers of composants are `1` and `c`, the largest possible number is `c`.\n\n**List of careful points:**\n*   The distinction between degenerate (single point) and nondegenerate continua is important. While a single point is technically an indecomposable continuum, it has only one composant. The question specifies nondegenerate continua.\n*   The number of composants of a nondegenerate continuum is not an arbitrary integer; it must be either `1` or `c`.\n*   The argument relies on two major theorems from continuum theory: one connecting the number of composants to decomposability, and another connecting the decomposability of a product to its factors.\n*   The existence of nondegenerate indecomposable continua is crucial for demonstrating that the maximum is attainable.\n\nFinal Answer: The largest possible number of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
