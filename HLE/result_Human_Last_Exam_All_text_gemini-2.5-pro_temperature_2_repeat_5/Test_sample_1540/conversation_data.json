    "### Problem Analysis\n\nThe user wants to solve the \"Petya and Strings\" problem from a competitive programming context with a focus on memory efficiency.\n\n1.  **Input:** Two strings of the same length, composed of uppercase and lowercase English letters. The length is between 1 and 100.\n2.  **Task:** Perform a lexicographical comparison of the two strings.\n3.  **Core Rule:** The comparison must be case-insensitive. 'a' is equivalent to 'A'.\n4.  **Output:**\n    *   \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n5.  **Objective:** Write the most memory-efficient C program to solve this and state the total memory `m` (in bytes) used by the program's variables.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\nTo find the most memory-efficient solution, we need to minimize the amount of data we store in variables.\n\n1.  **String Storage:**\n    *   A common approach is to read both strings into two character arrays, for example, `char s1[101], s2[101];`. This would consume `101 + 101 = 202` bytes.\n    *   To be more memory-efficient, we should try to avoid storing both strings. The input is provided on two separate lines. Standard input reads data sequentially. We cannot read from the second line until the first line has been processed. This means we *must* store the first string to have it available for comparison while we read the second string.\n    *   Therefore, a buffer for the first string is unavoidable. Given the maximum length is 100, we need a buffer of size 101 to accommodate the string and its null terminator (`\\0`). `char s1[101];` is necessary.\n    *   However, we can avoid creating a buffer for the second string. We can read it character by character from the input stream and perform the comparison on-the-fly against the corresponding character in the stored first string.\n\n2.  **Reading and Comparison Logic:**\n    *   Read the first string into `s1` using `scanf(\"%s\", s1);`.\n    *   `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` reads the string but leaves the newline character (`\\n`) in the input buffer. We must consume this newline before attempting to read the second string. A call to `getchar()` will do this.\n    *   We can then loop, reading one character at a time from the second string using `getchar()`. The loop continues until we hit the newline character at the end of the second string or the End-Of-File (EOF) marker.\n    *   Inside the loop, we compare the character just read from the second string with the character at the current position in the first string (`s1`).\n    *   To handle the case-insensitive requirement, we convert both characters to a common case (e.g., lowercase) using the `tolower()` function from `<ctype.h>` before comparing them.\n    *   If `tolower(s1_char) < tolower(s2_char)`, the first string is smaller. We print \"-1\" and exit immediately.\n    *   If `tolower(s1_char) > tolower(s2_char)`, the first string is larger. We print \"1\" and exit immediately.\n    *   If they are equal, we move to the next character.\n    *   Since the problem guarantees the strings are of equal length, if the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings must be equal. We then print \"0\".\n\n3.  **Variable Memory Optimization:**\n    *   **First String Buffer (`s1`):** `char s1[101];` -> `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n    *   **Loop Index (`i`):** We need an index to traverse the stored string `s1`. The length is at most 100, so the index will range from 0 to 99. An `int` (typically 4 bytes) is sufficient, but we can do better. `unsigned char` has a range of 0-255 and uses only 1 byte. So, `unsigned char i;` -> `1 * sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n    *   **Second String Character (`c2`):** The `getchar()` function returns an `int`, not a `char`. This is to accommodate the special `EOF` value, which might not fit in a `char`. Therefore, the variable that stores the result of `getchar()` must be an `int`. So, `int c2;` -> `1 * sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes** (on a typical system).\n\n4.  **Final Memory Calculation:**\n    The total memory `m` used for variables in this most efficient program is the sum of the sizes of the variables identified above.\n    *   `m = sizeof(s1) + sizeof(i) + sizeof(c2)`\n    *   `m = 101 + 1 + 4`\n    *   `m = 106` bytes.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Buffer Size:** A string buffer in C must be one character larger than the maximum string length to store the null terminator (`\\0`). For a max length of 100, the buffer must be size 101.\n2.  **Input Reading:** When mixing `scanf` with `getchar`, be mindful that `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` leaves the trailing newline in the input buffer, which must be manually consumed before using `getchar` to read the next line.\n3.  **`getchar()` Return Type:** Always use an `int` to store the return value of `getchar()` to correctly handle `EOF`. Using a `char` is a common bug.\n4.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** The `tolower()` function (or `toupper()`) from the `<ctype.h>` library is the standard way to handle this.\n5.  **Problem Guarantees:** The solution relies on the guarantee that the strings are of equal length. This simplifies the logic, as we don't need to handle cases where one string is a prefix of the other.\n\nBy following this analysis, we can construct a C program that is highly memory-efficient and correctly solves the problem. The total memory consumed by its variables would be 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
