    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Define the function F₃(x)**\n\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined recursively:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integrand**\n\nThe integral we need to evaluate is `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\nThe integrand is of the form `f'(x)/f(x)`, where `f(x) = F₃(x)`. This is known as the logarithmic derivative.\nThe antiderivative of `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`.\nTherefore, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n\nUsing the antiderivative, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from `x = 0` to `x = 1`.\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate F₃(x) at the limits of integration**\n\nFirst, let's find `F₃(0)`:\n*   `sin(0) = 0`\n*   `e⁰ = 1`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\nNext, let's find `F₃(1)`:\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n(Note: The argument of the `sin` function is in radians.)\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the expression for V**\n\nBefore calculating, let's consider the absolute value. For any `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`:\n*   `sin(x)` is between `0` and `sin(1)` (approx `0.84`), so it's non-negative.\n*   `e^(sin(x))` is always positive (and greater than or equal to `e⁰ = 1`).\n*   `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always positive (and greater than or equal to 2).\n*   Therefore, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always positive on `[0, 1]`, since the argument of the logarithm is always greater than 1.\nThis means we can drop the absolute value signs.\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can write:\n`V = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) )`\nSubstituting the expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`:\n`V = ln[ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / ln(2) ]`\n\n**Step 6: Perform the numerical calculation for V**\n\nWe need to calculate the value of `V` using a calculator.\n1.  `sin(1)` (radian) ≈ 0.84147098\n2.  `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.31977789`\n3.  `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(1 + 2.31977789) = ln(3.31977789) ≈ 1.20000706`\n4.  `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718`\n5.  `V = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) ) ≈ ln( 1.20000706 / 0.69314718 ) ≈ ln(1.73127021)`\n6.  `V ≈ 0.54884034`\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final value and round to the closest integer**\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n*   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54884034 = 5488.4034`\n*   The closest integer to `5488.4034` is `5488`.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
