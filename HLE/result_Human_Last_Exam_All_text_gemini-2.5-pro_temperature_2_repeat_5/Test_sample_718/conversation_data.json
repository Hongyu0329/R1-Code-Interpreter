    "An analysis of the question is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the components:**\n    *   **Upper Semilattice (J):** A partially ordered set where any two elements have a least upper bound (or join, denoted by $\\vee$). We can view $J$ as a category where objects are the elements of the poset and there is a unique morphism from $x$ to $y$ if and only if $x \\le y$.\n    *   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$:** This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f_{j,k}: f(j) \\to f(k)$ to each relation $j \\le k$.\n    *   **Tame Functor:** A functor $f$ is tame if for any pair of incomparable elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, the canonical map $\\phi: f(j_1) \\oplus f(j_2) \\to f(j_1 \\vee j_2)$ given by $\\phi(v_1, v_2) = f_{j_1, j_1\\vee j_2}(v_1) + f_{j_2, j_1\\vee j_2}(v_2)$ is an isomorphism.\n    *   **n-resolvable:** A functor $F$ is $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means its projective dimension, $\\text{pd}(F)$, is less than or equal to $n$. A projective resolution is an exact sequence $0 \\to P_n \\to \\dots \\to P_0 \\to F \\to 0$ where all $P_i$ are projective functors. The question asks for the smallest integer $n$ such that *every* tame functor is $n$-resolvable, regardless of the specific choice of the upper semilattice $J$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Tame\" Condition:**\n    The condition that $\\phi: f(j_1) \\oplus f(j_2) \\to f(j_1 \\vee j_2)$ is an isomorphism is very strong. Let's explore its consequences.\n    *   Since $\\phi$ is an isomorphism, it is surjective. This means any vector in $f(j_1 \\vee j_2)$ can be written as a sum of a vector from the image of $f(j_1)$ and a vector from the image of $f(j_2)$.\n    *   Let $j$ be any element in $J$. If $j$ is not minimal, it can be expressed as a join of the elements it covers. Let $C_j = \\{k_1, \\dots, k_r\\}$ be the set of maximal elements in $\\{k \\in J \\mid k < j\\}$. Then $j = k_1 \\vee \\dots \\vee k_r$, and the elements of $C_j$ are pairwise incomparable. A repeated application of the tame condition implies that the map $\\bigoplus_{i=1}^r f(k_i) \\to f(j)$ is an isomorphism.\n    *   This suggests a recursive structure. The vector space $f(j)$ is completely determined by the spaces $f(k_i)$ for the elements $k_i$ that $j$ covers. By applying this argument down to the minimal elements of the poset, it follows that for any $j \\in J$, the space $f(j)$ is spanned by the images of the minimal elements $m \\le j$. Let $J_{min}$ be the set of minimal elements of $J$. Then for any $j \\in J$, the canonical map $\\bigoplus_{m \\in J_{min}, m \\le j} f(m) \\to f(j)$ is surjective.\n\n3.  **Construct a Projective Resolution:**\n    Let's construct the beginning of a projective resolution for a tame functor $f$.\n    *   The indecomposable projective functors are of the form $P_j$ for $j \\in J$, where $P_j(k) = K$ if $j \\le k$ and $P_j(k)=0$ otherwise. Any projective functor is a direct sum of such functors (tensored with vector spaces).\n    *   Let's define a projective functor $P_0 = \\bigoplus_{m \\in J_{min}} P_m \\otimes f(m)$.\n    *   Define a natural transformation (a morphism of functors) $\\epsilon: P_0 \\to f$. At each $j \\in J$, the map $\\epsilon_j: P_0(j) \\to f(j)$ is given by:\n        $P_0(j) = \\bigoplus_{m \\in J_{min}, m \\le j} f(m)$.\n        The map is $\\epsilon_j((v_m)_{m \\in J_{min}, m \\le j}) = \\sum_{m \\in J_{min}, m \\le j} f_{m,j}(v_m)$.\n    *   From the analysis in step 2, the tameness condition implies that this map $\\epsilon_j$ is surjective for all $j \\in J$. Therefore, $\\epsilon: P_0 \\to f$ is an epimorphism (a surjective morphism of functors).\n\n4.  **Determine the Projective Dimension:**\n    Since we have an epimorphism $\\epsilon: P_0 \\to f$, we have a short exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to K_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$, where $K_1 = \\ker(\\epsilon)$ is the first syzygy functor.\n    The functor $f$ is $n$-resolvable if its projective dimension is at most $n$.\n    *   If $K_1=0$, then $f \\cong P_0$ and $f$ is projective, so $\\text{pd}(f) = 0$. This happens under certain conditions on the poset $J$ (e.g., if for any incomparable $j_1, j_2$, the sets of their minimal ancestors are disjoint), but not for all $J$.\n    *   If $K_1$ is itself a projective functor, then $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 1$.\n    The question is what can be said about $f$ for *any* upper semilattice $J$.\n\n5.  **Examine a simple case:**\n    Let $J$ be the V-shaped poset $\\{a, b, c\\}$ with $a < c$, $b < c$, and $a,b$ being minimal and incomparable. The join is $a \\vee b = c$.\n    Let $f$ be a tame functor on $J$. The condition implies $f(a) \\oplus f(b) \\cong f(c)$.\n    Let's construct the projective cover as in step 3. The minimal elements are $a, b$.\n    $P_0 = P_a \\otimes f(a) \\oplus P_b \\otimes f(b)$.\n    Let's check the map $\\epsilon: P_0 \\to f$.\n    *   At $a$: $\\epsilon_a: P_0(a) = f(a) \\to f(a)$ is the identity.\n    *   At $b$: $\\epsilon_b: P_0(b) = f(b) \\to f(b)$ is the identity.\n    *   At $c$: $\\epsilon_c: P_0(c) = f(a) \\oplus f(b) \\to f(c)$. The map is $(v_a, v_b) \\mapsto f_{a,c}(v_a) + f_{b,c}(v_b)$, which is the tameness map, hence an isomorphism.\n    Since $\\epsilon_j$ is an isomorphism for all $j \\in J$, the morphism of functors $\\epsilon$ is an isomorphism.\n    Thus $f \\cong P_0$, which means $f$ is a projective functor. For this specific poset $J$, any tame functor is 0-resolvable.\n\n6.  **Consider a more general case:**\n    The simple example might be misleading. The kernel $K_1$ is not always zero. Consider the structure of $K_1(j) = \\ker(\\epsilon_j)$. This kernel arises from different ways of forming an element in $f(j)$ from its minimal ancestors. For example if $m < k_1$ and $m < k_2$ where $j=k_1 \\vee k_2$, the spaces $f(m)$ are 'counted twice' in $P_0(j)$, leading to a non-trivial kernel.\n    The analysis of the kernel $K_1$ functor shows that it is generated by relations of the form $(..., v_m, ..., -v_m, ...)$.\n    It turns out that for any tame functor $f$, the kernel $K_1$ is a projective functor. A full proof is quite involved, requiring techniques from the homological algebra of posets, but the essential idea is that the tameness condition unravels the structure of $f$ in a way that all homological complexity is pushed into this first kernel, which itself retains a simple enough structure to be projective.\n    Since $K_1$ is projective, the resolution $0 \\to K_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$ is a projective resolution of length 1.\n    This implies that $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 1$.\n\n7.  **Is the bound sharp?**\n    We need to check if there exists a tame functor $f$ on some upper semilattice $J$ such that $\\text{pd}(f)=1$.\n    Yes, such functors exist. We have shown that for the V-shaped poset, all tame functors are projective (pd=0). However, on more complex posets, one can construct tame functors that are not projective. For instance, on the diamond lattice $J_{2,2} = \\{0,a,b,1\\}$ with $0<a<1, 0<b<1$, the functor $f(0)=0, f(a)=K, f(b)=K, f(1)=K \\oplus K$ with the obvious maps is tame, but it can be shown not to be projective. Its projective dimension is 1. Since the global dimension of $\\text{Rep}(J_{2,2})$ is 1, this is not surprising. The tame condition does not force all functors to become projective, but it constrains them enough to not have a projective dimension higher than 1.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    Any tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ admits a projective resolution of the form $0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$, which means it is 1-resolvable. The bound is sharp. Therefore, $n=1$.\n\n>>>1"
