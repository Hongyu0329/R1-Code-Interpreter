    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the recursive function `f`\n\nThe function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined as follows:\n1.  **Base Case 1 (Invalid arguments):** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if the sequence is not non-decreasing (i.e., if `a_i > a_{i+1}` for any `i`).\n2.  **Base Case 2 (Origin):** `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`.\n3.  **Recursive Step (for all other valid cases):**\n    `f(a) = f(a-e_1) + f(a-e_2) + ... + f(a-e_n)`, where `e_k` is the k-th standard basis vector.\n\nA term `f(a - e_k)` in the sum contributes to the result only if its arguments `a' = a - e_k` are valid according to the base cases.\nLet `a' = (a_1, ..., a_k - 1, ..., a_n)`.\n- The condition `a'_1 >= 0` means that if `k=1`, we must have `a_1-1 >= 0`, i.e., `a_1 > 0`.\n- The condition that `a'` is non-decreasing requires `a_{k-1} <= a_k - 1` (for `k > 1`) and `a_k - 1 <= a_{k+1}` (for `k < n`). Since we are in a \"valid case\", we already have `a_{k-1} <= a_k <= a_{k+1}`. The second part `a_k - 1 <= a_{k+1}` is thus always satisfied. The first part becomes `a_{k-1} < a_k`.\n\nSo the recursion holds where terms corresponding to `a-e_k` are non-zero only if the coordinates of `a` strictly increase at the boundary `a_{k-1} < a_k`.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a combinatorial interpretation for `f`\n\nThe recursion describes counting paths on an n-dimensional integer lattice. `f(a)` represents the number of paths from point `a` to the origin `(0,0,...,0)` using steps in the negative axis directions (`-e_k`), such that every point on the path `x = (x_1, ..., x_n)` lies within the region defined by `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. The value `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` is equal to the number of **Standard Young Tableaux (SYT)** of a specific shape. A SYT is a filling of a Young diagram with numbers from 1 to `S` (where `S` is the total number of cells) such that numbers increase along rows and down columns.\n\nThe shape of the Young diagram, denoted by a partition `λ = (λ_1, λ_2, ..., λ_n)`, is determined by the arguments of `f`. The correct mapping is `λ = (a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1)`. The condition `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n` ensures that `λ_1 >= λ_2 >= ... >= λ_n`, which defines a valid Young diagram.\n\nThe number of SYT of a given shape `λ` can be calculated using the **Hook-Length Formula**:\n`d_λ = S! / H`, where `S` is the total number of cells (`S = Σλ_i = Σa_i`) and `H` is the product of all hook lengths in the diagram. The hook length of a cell is the number of cells to its right, plus the number of cells below it, plus one for the cell itself.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating `f(2, 4, 5)`\n\nFor `f(2, 4, 5)`, we have `n=3`, `a_1=2`, `a_2=4`, `a_3=5`.\nThe corresponding partition is `λ = (a_3, a_2, a_1) = (5, 4, 2)`.\nThe Young diagram is:\nXXXXX\nXXXX\nXX\nThe total number of cells is `S = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11`.\nThe hook lengths for each cell are:\n7 6 4 3 1\n5 4 2 1\n2 1\nThe product of hook lengths is `H = (7·6·4·3·1) * (5·4·2·1) * (2·1) = 504 * 40 * 2 = 40320 / 2 = 20160`.\nThe number of SYT is `f(2,4,5) = 11! / H = 39,916,800 / 20,160 = 1980`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`\n\nFor `f(p, p, p)` with `p = 9000`, the partition is `λ = (p, p, p)`, which is a `3 x p` rectangle.\nThe number of SYT for an `n x m` rectangle is given by the formula:\n`d_λ = (nm)! * (Π_{i=0}^{n-1} i!) / (Π_{i=0}^{n-1} (m+i)!)`.\nHere `n=3`, `m=p=9000`. So, `nm = 3p`.\n`f(p,p,p) = (3p)! * (0! * 1! * 2!) / (p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)!)`\n`f(p,p,p) = (3p)! * 2 / (p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)!)`.\nThis number is astronomically large and cannot be computed as a decimal number easily. The question asks to \"calculate\", and in such contexts, providing the exact expression is the standard practice.\nFor `p=9000`, the expression is: `f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating `f(p, p, p, p) mod p`\n\nWe need to compute `f(P, P, P, P) mod P` where `P = 10^9 + 7` is a prime number.\nThe partition `λ` is `(P, P, P, P)`, which is a `4 x P` rectangle (`n=4, m=P`).\nUsing the same SYT formula for a rectangle:\n`f(P,P,P,P) = (4P)! * (0! * 1! * 2! * 3!) / (P! * (P+1)! * (P+2)! * (P+3)!)`\n`f(P,P,P,P) = 12 * (4P)! / ( P! * (P+1)! * (P+2)! * (P+3)! )`.\n\nWe need to compute this value modulo the prime `P`. The denominator contains factors of `P!`, which is `0 mod P`. We must analyze the multiplicity of the factor `P` in both the numerator and the denominator.\nThe number of factors of a prime `p` in `n!` is given by Legendre's formula, `v_p(n!) = Σ floor(n/p^k)`.\nLet `N = 12 * (4P)!` and `D = P! * (P+1)! * (P+2)! * (P+3)!`.\n\n- `v_P((4P)!) = floor(4P/P) + floor(4P/P^2) + ... = 4`. So `v_P(N) = 4`.\n- `v_P(P!) = 1`. `v_P((P+k)!) = 1` for `k>0`.\n- `v_P(D) = v_P(P!) + v_P((P+1)!) + v_P((P+2)!) + v_P((P+3)!) = 1+1+1+1 = 4`.\n\nSince the `P`-adic valuations are equal, the factors of `P` cancel, and the expression has a well-defined value modulo `P`. We use the property that `(kP+j)! / P^k \\equiv k!*(-1)^k (mod P)` and more generally `(aP+b)! / P^a \\equiv a!((P-1)!)^a b! \\equiv a!(-1)^a b! \\pmod P`.\nA more direct calculation is easier:\n`N' = 12 * (4P)!/P^4 = 12 * (4! * Π_{i=0..3} (iP+1)...(iP+P-1)) \\pmod P`\n`N' \\equiv 12 * 4! * ((P-1)!)^4 \\pmod P \\equiv 12 * 24 * (-1)^4 = 288 \\pmod P`.\n\n`D' = (P!/P) * ((P+1)!/P) * ((P+2)!/P) * ((P+3)!/P) \\pmod P`.\n- `P!/P = (P-1)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod P`.\n- `(P+1)!/P = (P+1)(P-1)! \\equiv 1 * (-1) = -1 \\pmod P`.\n- `(P+2)!/P = (P+2)(P+1)(P-1)! \\equiv 2 * 1 * (-1) = -2 \\pmod P`.\n- `(P+3)!/P = (P+3)(P+2)(P+1)(P-1)! \\equiv 3 * 2 * 1 * (-1) = -6 \\pmod P`.\n`D' \\equiv (-1)(-1)(-2)(-6) = 12 \\pmod P`.\n\nSo, `f(P,P,P,P) \\equiv N' / D' \\equiv 288 / 12 = 24 \\pmod P`.\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\n1.  `f(2,4,5) = 1980`\n2.  `f(9000,9000,9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`\n3.  `f(10^9+7, 10^9+7, 10^9+7, 10^9+7) \\mod (10^9+7) = 24`\n\nThe question asks for the answers separated by a comma.\n\n<<<1980, 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!), 24>>>"
