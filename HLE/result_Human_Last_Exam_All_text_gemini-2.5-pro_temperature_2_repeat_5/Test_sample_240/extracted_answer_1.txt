The primary reason a functional MRI coil may show no resonance is due to its built-in active detuning circuitry. For safety, when the coil is disconnected from the scanner, this circuit defaults to a detuned, non-resonant state to prevent potential damage or harm during an RF transmit pulse. The coil only becomes resonant at its operating frequency when it is connected to the scanner and receives the specific DC control signal to switch it into the receive mode. Other less common reasons include poor probe positioning in a field null, the damping effect of an unpowered integrated preamplifier, or an inefficient coupling to a balanced coil design.
