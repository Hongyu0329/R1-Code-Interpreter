    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we need to analyze the basis set for each type of atom and then sum them up according to the molecular formula.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chemical formula and atomic composition of the molecule.**\n*   The molecule is toluene.\n*   The chemical formula for toluene is C7H8.\n*   This means the molecule contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 6-31G basis set for a Carbon atom.**\n*   The notation \"6-31G\" is a Pople-style basis set. It describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions.\n*   Carbon is a second-row element (atomic number 6), so it has both core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) electrons.\n*   **Core Orbital (1s):** The \"6-\" part of the name indicates that the 1s core orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function. This single function is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions. We count this as **1 contracted function**.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The \"-31\" part indicates a split-valence basis set, meaning the valence orbitals are represented by two sets of functions: an \"inner\" part and an \"outer\" part.\n    *   The \"3\" describes the inner valence functions. We have one for the 2s orbital and three for the 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz). Each is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians. This gives 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = 4 functions.\n    *   The \"1\" describes the outer valence functions. We have one for the 2s orbital and three for the 2p orbitals. Each is represented by a single primitive Gaussian. This gives another 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = 4 functions.\n*   **Total per Carbon atom:**\n    *   A simpler way to count is by orbital:\n        *   1s orbital: 1 contracted function.\n        *   2s orbital: 2 contracted functions (one from the \"3\" part, one from the \"1\" part).\n        *   2p orbitals (px, py, pz): Each of the three p-orbitals is described by 2 contracted functions. Total = 3 * 2 = 6 contracted functions.\n    *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 (1s) + 2 (2s) + 6 (2p) = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 6-31G basis set for a Hydrogen atom.**\n*   Hydrogen (atomic number 1) has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is its valence orbital.\n*   The split-valence description \"-31\" applies to this 1s orbital.\n*   The 1s orbital is represented by two contracted functions:\n    *   One \"inner\" contracted function (from the \"3\"), which is a combination of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   One \"outer\" contracted function (from the \"1\"), which is a single primitive Gaussian.\n*   **Total per Hydrogen atom:** 1 + 1 = **2 contracted functions**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8).**\n*   **Contribution from Carbon atoms:** There are 7 Carbon atoms.\n    *   Total from C = 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen atoms:** There are 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total from H = 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n*   **Grand Total:** The total number of contracted Gaussian functions is the sum of the contributions from all atoms.\n    *   Total functions = 63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = **79**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for *contracted* functions, not the more numerous *primitive* functions that they are built from.\n*   **Atom Types:** The basis set definition is different for first-row atoms (H, He) and second-row atoms (Li to Ne). It's crucial to apply the correct rule for each. For H in 6-31G, only the valence split applies. For C, both core and valence descriptions apply.\n*   **p-orbitals:** Remember that \"p\" refers to a set of three orbitals (px, py, pz). Any description applied to a \"p\" shell must be multiplied by three.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Ensure the correct number of atoms for the molecule (7 Carbons and 8 Hydrogens for toluene) is used in the final calculation.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<79>>>"
