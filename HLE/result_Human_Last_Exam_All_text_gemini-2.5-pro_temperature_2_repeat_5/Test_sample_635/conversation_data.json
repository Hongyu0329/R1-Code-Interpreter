    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function matrix $H(s)$. A left factorization takes the form $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, where $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are polynomial matrices. For the factorization to be coprime, the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be left coprime.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Transfer Function:**\n    $H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    The denominators of the elements are $(s+1)$ and $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$. The least common multiple of these denominators is $d(s) = s^2-1$. This polynomial indicates that the poles of the system are at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\n3.  **Find a General Left Factorization:**\n    We seek polynomial matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ such that $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. Let's write $D(s)$ with unknown polynomial entries:\n    $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$\n    The product $D(s)H(s)$ is:\n    $\\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}$\n    For this resulting matrix to be a polynomial matrix $N(s)$, all its entries must be polynomials.\n\n4.  **Determine the Entries of D(s):**\n    *   From the (1,2) entry of the product, $d_{11}(s)$ must be a polynomial. Let's call it $n_{12}(s)$.\n    *   From the (2,2) entry, $d_{21}(s)$ must be a polynomial. Let's call it $n_{22}(s)$.\n\n    *   Now consider the (1,1) entry: $n_{11}(s) = d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$.\n    To make this a polynomial, the denominator $(s+1)$ in the first term must be cancelled. The simplest way is to choose $d_{11}(s)$ to be a multiple of $(s+1)$. Let's try $d_{11}(s) = k(s+1)$.\n    The term becomes $k(s-1)$. Then we have $n_{11}(s) = k(s-1) + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$. For this to be a polynomial, $d_{12}(s)$ must cancel the denominator $s^2-1$. The simplest choice is $d_{12}(s)=0$.\n    Let's choose $k=1$ and $d_{12}(s)=0$. Then $d_{11}(s) = s+1$.\n    The first row of $N(s)$ is then:\n    $n_{11}(s) = (s+1)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + 0 = s-1$.\n    $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = s+1$.\n    So the first row of $D(s)$ is $[s+1 \\quad 0]$ and the first row of $N(s)$ is $[s-1 \\quad s+1]$.\n\n    *   Now consider the (2,1) entry: $n_{21}(s) = d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$.\n    To make this a polynomial, the term $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$.\n    Let's check the condition at the pole locations:\n    - At $s=1$: $d_{21}(1)(0)^2 + 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{22}(1)=0 \\implies d_{22}(1)=0$. This means $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$. Let $d_{22}(s) = p(s)(s-1)$ for some polynomial $p(s)$.\n    - At $s=-1$: $d_{21}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{21}(-1) + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n      Substituting $d_{22}(-1) = p(-1)(-1-1) = -2p(-1)$, we get $4d_{21}(-1) - 4p(-1) = 0$, which implies $d_{21}(-1) = p(-1)$.\n    Let's choose the simplest polynomials that satisfy these conditions. We previously found $d_{21}(s)$ must be a polynomial, let's try the simplest polynomial: a constant. Let $d_{21}(s) = \\alpha$.\n    We also need $d_{21}(-1) = p(-1)$, so $\\alpha = p(-1)$. The simplest choice for $p(s)$ is also a constant, say $p(s) = \\alpha$.\n    Then $d_{22}(s) = \\alpha(s-1)$.\n    Let's pick $\\alpha=1$ for simplicity. This gives $d_{21}(s)=1$ and $d_{22}(s)=s-1$.\n    With these choices, the numerator becomes $1 \\cdot (s-1)^2 + 2(s-1) = (s-1)[(s-1)+2] = (s-1)(s+1)$.\n    So, $n_{21}(s) = \\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{s^2-1} = 1$.\n    And $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)=1$.\n\n    So we have found a candidate factorization:\n    $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Verify the Factorization:**\n    First, check if $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$.\n    $\\det(D(s)) = (s+1)(s-1) - (0)(1) = s^2-1$.\n    $D^{-1}(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2-1}\\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    $D^{-1}(s)N(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2-1}\\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    $= \\frac{1}{s^2-1}\\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & (s-1)(s+1) \\\\ -(s-1)+(s+1) & -(s+1)+(s+1) \\end{bmatrix}$\n    $= \\frac{1}{s^2-1}\\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{(s-1)^2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = H(s)$.\n    The factorization is correct.\n\n6.  **Verify Left Coprimeness:**\n    The matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime if the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (i.e., rank 2) for all complex numbers $s$.\n    $[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    The rank can potentially drop only when sub-determinants are zero. In particular, we should check the values of $s$ where $\\det(D(s))=0$, which are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    *   At $s=1$:\n        $[D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n        The rows are linearly independent. For example, the determinant of the submatrix formed by columns 1 and 3 is $\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 2 \\neq 0$. Thus, the rank is 2.\n    *   At $s=-1$:\n        $[D(-1) \\quad N(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n        The rows are linearly independent. For example, the determinant of the submatrix formed by columns 1 and 3 is $\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -2 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 2 \\neq 0$. Thus, the rank is 2.\n    Since the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 for all $s$, the matrices are left coprime.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[ D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]"
