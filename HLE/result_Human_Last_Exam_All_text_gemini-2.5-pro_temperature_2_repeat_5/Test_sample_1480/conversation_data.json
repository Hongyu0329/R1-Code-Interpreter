    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\nThe question asks for the \"rule activation level\" within the context of an Interval Type-3 (IT3) fuzzy system. We are given two values and an operation to use.\n*   **Given Value 1:** `Φ_k(x') = 0.7`. In fuzzy logic systems, `Φ_k(x')` (or `w_k`) represents the firing strength or activation degree of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the *k*-th rule. It is the result of evaluating the inputs against the antecedent fuzzy sets.\n*   **Given Value 2:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This represents the membership degree of a value `y_j` in the fuzzy set `G_k_j` which is part of the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of the *k*-th rule.\n*   **Specified Operation:** A t-norm operation must be used.\n*   **Context:** The problem is set in an \"Interval Type-3\" fuzzy system.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the \"Rule Activation Level\"\n\nThere are two possible interpretations of \"rule activation level\":\n1.  It could refer only to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent, which is given as `Φ_k(x') = 0.7`.\n2.  It could refer to the result of the implication process, where the antecedent's firing strength is combined with the consequent's membership function.\n\nThe question explicitly asks to use a t-norm operation with the *given* values (`Φ_k(x')` and `μG_k_j(y_j)`). This strongly indicates that the second interpretation is intended. The question is asking for the result of applying the rule's firing strength to the consequent fuzzy set, a process known as implication. The result is the membership grade of `y_j` in the final output fuzzy set for that specific rule.\n\n### Step 3: The Role of \"Interval Type-3\" and the T-norm\n\n*   **Interval Type-3 (IT3):** In a full IT3 system, the membership grades themselves would be more complex constructs (like Type-2 fuzzy sets). However, the problem provides simple, crisp numbers (0.7 and 0.9). This means we are dealing with a simplified instance or a specific \"slice\" of the IT3 system. The fundamental operation (the t-norm) remains the same, but it is applied to these crisp values. The IT3 context informs us about the origin of these values but doesn't change the calculation method here.\n*   **T-norm Operation:** A t-norm generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy logic. The most common t-norms are:\n    *   **Minimum t-norm:** `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n    *   **Product t-norm:** `T(a, b) = a * b`\n\nSince the specific t-norm is not stated, standard practice is to assume the most common one, which is the **Minimum** t-norm. This is the classic operator used in Mamdani-style fuzzy inference.\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nFollowing the interpretation from Step 2 and the choice of t-norm from Step 3, the calculation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the inputs for the t-norm:**\n    *   Antecedent Firing Strength: `Φ_k(x') = 0.7`\n    *   Consequent Membership Degree: `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\n2.  **Apply the chosen t-norm (Minimum):**\n    *   `Rule Activation Level = t-norm(Φ_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    *   `Rule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n3.  **Compute the final result:**\n    *   `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ambiguity in Terminology:** The main challenge is interpreting \"rule activation level\". The context of being given both antecedent and consequent values, along with a specified operation, is the key to resolving this ambiguity in favor of the implication result.\n2.  **Unspecified T-Norm:** The choice of the `min` operator is an assumption based on its prevalence in fuzzy systems. If the product t-norm were assumed, the result would be `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`. However, `min` is the most standard assumption.\n3.  **Simplified Context:** The problem simplifies a complex IT3 system into a calculation involving crisp numbers. The core principles of fuzzy implication are being tested, not the full complexity of IT3 sets.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe problem requires calculating the result of combining the rule's antecedent firing strength (0.7) and a specific point on its consequent membership function (0.9) using a t-norm. Using the standard Minimum t-norm, the result is `min(0.7, 0.9)`, which is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
