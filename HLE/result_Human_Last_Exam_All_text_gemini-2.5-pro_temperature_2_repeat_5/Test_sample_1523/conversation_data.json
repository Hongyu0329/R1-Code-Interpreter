    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. The Theoretical Framework: Finite-Temperature Field Theory**\n\n*   In finite-temperature field theory, thermal equilibrium states are described using a path integral formalism in Euclidean spacetime.\n*   The key transformation is the Wick rotation of time to imaginary time, $t \\to -i\\tau$.\n*   For a system at temperature $T$, the imaginary time coordinate $\\tau$ is compactified into a circle with circumference $\\beta = 1/T$ (in natural units where $k_B=1$).\n*   The partition function, $Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H})$, is given by a functional integral (or path integral) over all field configurations $\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$ that are periodic in imaginary time with period $\\beta$:\n    $Z = \\int_{\\phi(\\tau+\\beta, \\mathbf{x}) = \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})} \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n*   Here, $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action of the field.\n\n**2. The Euclidean Action for a Neutral Scalar Field**\n\n*   For a neutral scalar field $\\phi$ with mass $m$, the free (non-interacting) part of the Euclidean action is given by:\n    $S_E[\\phi]_{\\text{free}} = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\mathcal{L}_E$\n    where $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is the Euclidean Lagrangian density:\n    $\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right)$\n    So, the action is:\n    $S_E[\\phi]_{\\text{free}} = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right)$\n\n**3. Defining the Inner Product and Identifying the Operator D**\n\n*   The structure of the action suggests a natural inner product. For any two real scalar fields $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ on the Euclidean spacetime manifold ($S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^d$), the standard L2 inner product is:\n    $(\\phi_1, \\phi_2) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi_1(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\phi_2(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$\n*   To identify the operator in question, we rewrite the Euclidean action in a quadratic form $(\\phi, D\\phi)$. This is achieved through integration by parts.\n    *   **Time derivative term:** $\\int_0^\\beta (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 d\\tau = [\\phi(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)]_0^\\beta - \\int_0^\\beta \\phi (\\partial^2_\\tau \\phi) d\\tau$. The boundary term vanishes because $\\phi$ is periodic in $\\tau$.\n    *   **Spatial derivative term:** $\\int (\\nabla \\phi)^2 d^d\\mathbf{x} = -\\int \\phi (\\nabla^2 \\phi) d^d\\mathbf{x}$. We assume the fields vanish sufficiently fast at spatial infinity for the boundary term to be zero.\n*   Substituting these back into the action expression:\n    $S_E[\\phi]_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\left( -\\phi(\\partial_\\tau^2\\phi) - \\phi(\\nabla^2\\phi) + m^2\\phi^2 \\right)$\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    $S_E[\\phi]_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left[ (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\right]$\n*   From this form, we can identify the operator $D$. The expression is in the form $\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$. The notation $D_\\phi$ in the question refers to the action of the operator $D$ on the field $\\phi$. The operator $D$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n    $D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 = -\\Box_E + m^2$\n    where $\\Box_E = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2$ is the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator.\n\n**4. Calculating the Inner Product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$**\n\n*   Using the definitions from the previous steps, we can now compute the inner product $(\\phi, D\\phi)$, which is more accurately written as $(\\phi, D\\phi)$:\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi(x) [D\\phi(x)]$\n    Substituting the explicit form of the operator $D$:\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left[ (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\right]$\n\n**5. Final Result and Relation to the Action**\n\n*   By comparing the result from Step 4 with the rewritten action from Step 3, we establish a direct relationship.\n*   The Euclidean action for a free scalar field is precisely half of this inner product:\n    $S_E[\\phi]_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D\\phi)$\n*   Therefore, the inner product is equal to twice the free Euclidean action:\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2 S_E[\\phi]_{\\text{free}}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Euclidean Spacetime:** The entire calculation is performed in Euclidean space, which affects the signs in the kinetic operator ($-\\Box_E$ instead of the Minkowskian $\\Box = \\partial_t^2 - \\nabla^2$).\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The periodicity of the scalar field in imaginary time is crucial for the integration by parts to work cleanly without boundary terms. This periodicity is a fundamental feature of the finite-temperature path integral for bosons.\n*   **The Operator D:** The operator $D = -\\Box_E + m^2$ is the inverse of the free-field propagator (or Green's function) in Euclidean space. The path integral is essentially a Gaussian integral over the fields, with the quadratic form defined by this operator.\n*   **Interacting Theories:** Even in a theory with interaction terms (e.g., a $\\lambda\\phi^4$ term), the operator $D$ still refers to the operator from the free, quadratic part of the action. The partition function is defined using this quadratic part, and the interaction terms are treated as corrections, typically via perturbation theory.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field $\\phi$ in the functional integral representation of the partition function is:\n$$\n(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left[ (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\right]\n$$\nThis quantity is equal to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $S_E[\\phi]_{\\text{free}}$.\n\n<<<The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is given by the integral $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left[ (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\right]$, which is equal to twice the free Euclidean action, $2 S_E[\\phi]_{\\text{free}}$.>>>"
