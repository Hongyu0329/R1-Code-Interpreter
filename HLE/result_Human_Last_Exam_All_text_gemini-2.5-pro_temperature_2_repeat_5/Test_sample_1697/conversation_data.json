    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting compound is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to a carboxamide group (-CONH₂).\n*   **N,N-diethyl-**: The two hydrogen atoms on the amide nitrogen are replaced by two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), resulting in a -CON(CH₂CH₃)₂ group.\n*   **3-dimethylamino-**: A dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, is attached to the benzene ring at position 3, which is meta to the amide group.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CON(C₂H₅)₂\n      /\n     / \\\n    | C1|\n H--|C6 C2|--H\n    \\\\ //\n H--C5-C4--H\n        |\n        C3-N(CH₃)₂\n```\nThe available protons for deprotonation on the aromatic ring are at positions C2, C4, C5, and C6.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step (Reagents: sec-BuLi, TMEDA, THF)**\n*   **sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium)**: A very strong organolithium base. Its primary function here is to deprotonate the most acidic proton on the aromatic ring, a process called lithiation.\n*   **TMEDA (Tetramethylethylenediamine)**: A bidentate ligand that coordinates strongly with the lithium cation (Li⁺). This breaks up the aggregates of sec-BuLi, increasing its basicity. More importantly, it participates in stabilizing the lithiated intermediate.\n*   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran)**: The aprotic polar solvent for the reaction.\n\nThis combination of reagents (sec-BuLi/TMEDA) is characteristic of a **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In this reaction, a substituent on the benzene ring, known as a Directed Metalation Group (DMG), directs the lithiation to a specific ortho position by coordinating with the lithium ion.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Site of Lithiation**\nOur starting molecule has two potential Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs):\n1.  **-CON(Et)₂ (N,N-diethylcarboxamide group) at C1**: This is a very powerful DMG. The carbonyl oxygen has lone pairs that can chelate strongly with the lithium ion. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, C2 and C6.\n2.  **-N(Me)₂ (dimethylamino group) at C3**: This is also a DMG, but it is significantly weaker than the amide group. The nitrogen atom has a lone pair that can coordinate with lithium. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, C2 and C4.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Relative Directing Power**: The -CONR₂ group is one of the most powerful DMGs, much stronger than the -NR₂ group. Therefore, the lithiation will be controlled primarily by the amide group, meaning it will occur at either C2 or C6.\n*   **Cooperative Effect**: We must consider the influence of both groups.\n    *   The -CON(Et)₂ group directs to **C2** and C6.\n    *   The -N(Me)₂ group directs to **C2** and C4.\n    *   Both groups direct lithiation to the **C2** position. This is known as a cooperative or synergistic effect. The deprotonation is strongly favored at the position located between the two directing groups.\n*   **Stabilization of the Intermediate**: The resulting aryllithium intermediate, with lithium at the C2 position, is stabilized by chelation. The lithium ion can be coordinated by both the carbonyl oxygen of the amide group and the nitrogen of the amino group. This thermodynamic stability makes the formation of the C2-lithiated species highly favorable, overcoming any potential steric hindrance from the adjacent bulky groups.\n\nTherefore, sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the hydrogen at the C2 position, forming the intermediate N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Reagent: Methyl Iodide, CH₃I)**\n*   The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a strong nucleophile (essentially an aryl carbanion).\n*   Methyl iodide (CH₃I) is an electrophile.\n*   The nucleophilic carbanion at C2 will attack the electrophilic methyl carbon of CH₃I in a nucleophilic substitution reaction (akin to Sₙ2), displacing the iodide ion (I⁻).\n\nThe reaction is: `Aryl-Li + CH₃-I → Aryl-CH₃ + LiI`\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Product**\nThe lithium atom at the C2 position is replaced by a methyl group (-CH₃). Starting from N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, a methyl group is added at the C2 position.\n\nThe name of the final product is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\nFinal structure:\n```\n      CON(C₂H₅)₂\n      /\n     / \\\n    | C1|\n H--|C6 C2|--CH₃\n    \\\\ //\n H--C5-C4--H\n        |\n        C3-N(CH₃)₂\n```\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide>>>"
