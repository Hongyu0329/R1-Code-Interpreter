    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Word and its Pronunciation**\n*   The kanji is 「弟」.\n*   The standard pronunciation is 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to).\n*   The word is composed of four morae: お(o), と(to), う(u), と(to).\n\n**Step 2: Define the Main Pitch Accent Patterns**\nTo analyze the word, we must first understand the main types of Japanese pitch accent.\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式 - Flat Pattern):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high through the rest of the word and any following particle. It is denoted as [0]. Example: さかな [0] (sakana - fish) -> さ(L)か(H)な(H)が(H).\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - Head-High Pattern):** The pitch is high only on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae, including any particle. It is denoted as [1]. Example: いのち [1] (inochi - life) -> い(H)の(L)ち(L)が(L).\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - Middle-High Pattern):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *before* the last mora of the word. Any following particle is low. It is denoted by the number of the mora where the pitch drop occurs. Example: こころ [2] (kokoro - heart) -> こ(L)こ(H)ろ(L)が(L). Note: The drop is after the second mora, こ.\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - Tail-High Pattern):** The pitch starts low, rises, and stays high until the last mora. It only drops when a particle is attached. It is denoted by the number of the last mora. Example: いもうと [4] (imouto - younger sister) -> い(L)も(H)う(H)と(H). With a particle: いもうとが -> い(L)も(H)う(H)と(H)が(L).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Pitch Accent of 「おとうと」**\n*   The standard, dictionary-approved pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is: お(low) と(high) う(high) と(high).\n*   When a particle such as 「が」 is attached, the pitch remains high: お(low) と(high) う(high) と(high) が(high).\n*   In this pattern, there is no drop in pitch within the word or on the following particle.\n\n**Step 4: Match the Pattern to the Definitions**\n*   The observed pattern for 「おとうと」—starting low, rising on the second mora, and remaining high indefinitely—perfectly matches the description of the **Heiban (平板式)** pattern.\n*   In numeric notation, 「おとうと」 is designated as [0], which signifies the Heiban pattern.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**\n*   **A. Heiban:** This matches our analysis.\n*   **B. Atamadaka:** Incorrect. This would be **お**とうと (H-L-L-L).\n*   **C. Nakadaka:** Incorrect. This would require a pitch drop within the word (e.g., お**と**うと, L-H-L-L).\n*   **D. Odaka:** Incorrect. This would require a pitch drop on a following particle (e.g., おとうと**が**, L-H-H-H-L).\n*   **E. Heiban or Nakadaka:** Incorrect. The standard pattern is firmly established as Heiban.\n\nTherefore, the correct pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
