    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given a system of linear differential equations known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman system, which models a continuous-time Markov chain with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. The equations describe the time evolution of the probability $P_i(t)$ of being in state $i$ at time $t$. We are asked to find the sum of the steady-state probabilities $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$.\n\nThe system of equations is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\nWith the normalization condition:\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\nThe given transition rates are:\n$ \\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008 $\n\n**Step 2: Correcting a Typo in the Equations**\nA careful point is to check the consistency of the provided equations. The general form for the Kolmogorov forward equation for state $j$ is $P_j'(t) = \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\lambda_{ij}P_i(t) - (\\sum_{k \\neq j} \\lambda_{jk})P_j(t)$. The term $\\lambda_{ij}P_i(t)$ represents the flow of probability *from* state $i$ *to* state $j$ and should be positive.\nIn the second equation for $P_1'(t)$, the term involving $P_0(t)$ is given as $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. This term represents the flow from state 0 to state 1 and should be $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. If we assume the given equation is correct, solving for the steady state leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we must assume it's a typo and correct the equation to:\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\nIn the steady state (as $t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities become constant, so their derivatives are zero: $P_i'(\\infty) = 0$. Let's denote the steady-state probabilities as $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. The system of equations becomes a linear algebraic system:\n1. $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_0 + \\lambda_{10}P_1$\n2. $0 = \\lambda_{01}P_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_1 + \\lambda_{21}P_2 + \\lambda_{31}P_3$\n3. $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_2$\n4. $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_2 - \\lambda_{31}P_3$\n5. $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$ (Normalization)\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the Numerical Values and Solve the System**\nLet's substitute the given values for $\\lambda_{ij}$:\n1. $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1$\n2. (This equation is linearly dependent on the others and can be used for verification later)\n3. $0 = 0.4 P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) P_2 \\implies 0 = 0.4 P_1 - 0.4 P_2$\n4. $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3$\n\nNow, we solve this system by expressing $P_0, P_2, P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_3 = P_2$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_2 = P_1$\nCombining these results, we get a key simplification: $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$\n\nNow substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1) + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 \\right) = 1$\n\nTo find $P_1$, we calculate the value in the parenthesis:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 = \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} = \\frac{0.707}{0.019}$\nSo, $P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\right) = 1 \\implies P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Required Sum**\nThe goal is to find $P_0 + P_1$. We have found $P_1$. Now we find $P_0$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\left( \\frac{0.019}{0.707} \\right) = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nNow, we compute the sum $P_0 + P_1$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we perform the division to get the numerical answer:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, e.g., six decimals, gives 0.946252.\n\nFinal answer:\nThe sum of the steady-state probabilities is $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = \\frac{669}{707}$."
