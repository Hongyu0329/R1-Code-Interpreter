    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific piece of legislation. Let's break down the key requirements:\n*   **\"First statute\"**: This implies we need to find the earliest law in chronological order that meets the criteria.\n*   **\"in the modern State of Israel\"**: This means the law must have been enacted by the Knesset after the establishment of the state in 1948. Laws from the preceding British Mandate or Ottoman periods are excluded, unless they were formally re-enacted by the Knesset.\n*   **\"to explicitly introduce\"**: The statute must contain the actual words \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*). A law that implies the concept through other terms (like \"justice\" or \"fairness\") would not qualify.\n*   **\"the concept of 'good faith'\"**: This refers to the legal principle requiring parties to act honestly and fairly.\n*   **Formatting constraints**: The final answer must not be preceded by \"the\" and must not have the year of enactment appended.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Potential Candidates**\nThe principle of \"good faith\" is a cornerstone of modern Israeli civil law, especially contract law. This points us toward major codifications in this area.\n*   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**: This is the most famous statute regarding good faith, establishing it as a foundational principle for all contracts in negotiation (Section 12) and performance (Section 39). However, its date (1973) suggests it may not be the *first*.\n*   **Sale Law, 1968**: This law, which predates the Contracts (General Part) Law, explicitly mentions good faith. Section 6 states that rights and obligations under a contract of sale shall be exercised \"in the customary manner and in good faith.\"\n*   **Land Law, 1969**: This law also uses the term. For instance, Section 10 protects a purchaser who acted in \"good faith\" when relying on the land registry.\n*   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957**: This is an even earlier candidate. The \"New Version\" statutes were official Hebrew re-enactments by the Knesset of laws originally from the British Mandate period, thereby making them statutes of the modern State of Israel. This ordinance explicitly uses the term \"good faith\" in defining a \"holder in due course\" (Section 28).\n\n**Step 3: Comparing the Candidates and Reaching a Conclusion**\nWe need to compare the enactment dates of the statutes that explicitly use the term \"good faith\":\n1.  **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]**: 1957\n2.  **Sale Law**: 1968\n3.  **Land Law**: 1969\n4.  **Contracts (General Part) Law**: 1973\n\nBased on this timeline, the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] of 1957 is the earliest statute enacted by the modern State of Israel to explicitly use the term \"good faith\". While the concept's application in this ordinance is specific (to the holder of a negotiable instrument) and not as broad as in the later Sale Law or Contracts Law, it is unequivocally the first statutory appearance of the explicit term in Israeli legislation.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance>>>"
