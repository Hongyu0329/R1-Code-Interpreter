    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**The Sequence:** 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the relationship between consecutive numbers.**\nLet's examine how each number can be derived from the previous one. We can try simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n*   **Differences:**\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The differences (9, 12, 28, 68) do not form a simple arithmetic or geometric progression.\n\n*   **Multiplication and Addition/Subtraction:** A common pattern in these types of sequences is `Next Term = k * Previous Term + C`, where `k` and `C` can be constants or follow a pattern themselves. Let's try a multiplier of 2, as the numbers are roughly doubling.\n    *   From 2 to 11: `2 * ?`. `2 * 5 + 1 = 11`.\n    *   From 11 to 23: `11 * 2 + 1 = 23`.\n    *   From 23 to 51: `23 * 2 + 5 = 51`.\n    *   From 51 to 119: `51 * 2 + 17 = 119`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the underlying pattern.**\nThe pattern appears to be `Next Term = 2 * Previous Term + C`, but the value of `C` changes. Also, the very first step (`2 * 5 + 1 = 11`) doesn't fit the `* 2` rule of the subsequent steps. It's common for the pattern to establish itself from the second or third term. Let's focus on the consistent part of the pattern:\n*   `23 = 2 × 11 + 1`\n*   `51 = 2 × 23 + 5`\n*   `119 = 2 × 51 + 17`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the pattern of the added numbers.**\nThe numbers being added are 1, 5, 17. Let's call this new sequence `C`. We need to find the next number in the sequence `C` to find the next number in the original sequence.\n*   Sequence C: 1, 5, 17, ( ? )\n*   Let's look for a pattern within sequence `C`.\n    *   Differences: `5 - 1 = 4`, `17 - 5 = 12`. The differences are 4 and 12. This suggests a geometric progression where each difference is 3 times the previous one (`4 * 3 = 12`).\n    *   Recurrence Relation: Let's test if `C_{n+1} = 3 * C_n + 2`.\n        *   For the first term: `3 * 1 + 2 = 5`. This is correct.\n        *   For the second term: `3 * 5 + 2 = 17`. This is also correct.\n*   Both methods suggest a clear pattern. The next difference in the first method would be `12 * 3 = 36`, so the next term in C would be `17 + 36 = 53`. Using the second method, the next term is `3 * 17 + 2 = 51 + 2 = 53`. The result is consistent.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\nWe've determined the next number to be added is 53. Now we apply the rule to the last term of the original sequence (119).\n*   Next Term = 2 × (Previous Term) + (Next Number in Sequence C)\n*   Next Term = 2 × 119 + 53\n*   Next Term = 238 + 53\n*   Next Term = 291\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Inconsistent Start:** Be aware that sometimes the established pattern does not apply to the first one or two terms in a sequence. It's important to find the consistent rule.\n2.  **Multi-layered Patterns:** The solution may involve a \"pattern within a pattern\". Here, the main sequence followed a `2x + C` rule, and the `C` term itself followed its own distinct pattern.\n3.  **Verification:** When you find a pattern for a sub-sequence (like `1, 5, 17`), it's a good practice to see if it can be described in more than one way (e.g., analyzing differences vs. finding a recurrence relation). If both methods yield the same result, it strongly supports your conclusion.\n4.  **Calculation Accuracy:** Double-check your arithmetic at each step to avoid simple errors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe sequence follows the rule `a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + c_n` starting from the second term. The sequence of `c_n` is `1, 5, 17`, which itself follows the rule `c_{n+1} = 3 * c_n + 2`. The next `c` term is 53. Therefore, the next term in the main sequence is `2 * 119 + 53 = 291`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
