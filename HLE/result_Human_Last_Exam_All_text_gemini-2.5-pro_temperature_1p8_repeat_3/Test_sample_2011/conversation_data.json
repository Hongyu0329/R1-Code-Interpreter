    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with $n=128$ vertices.\n\nLet's break down the key terms:\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices**: A graph $G=(V, E)$ where $|V|=128$.\n*   **Clique**: A subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. A clique of size $k$ induces a complete graph $K_k$.\n*   **Induced Subgraph**: For a subset of vertices $S \\subseteq V$, the induced subgraph $G[S]$ consists of the vertices $S$ and *all* edges from $E$ that have both endpoints in $S$.\n*   **Clique size**: The number of vertices in a clique.\n*   **Different clique sizes**: We are interested in the number of unique integers $k$ such that a clique of size $k$ exists. For example, if a graph has cliques of size 2, 3, and another of size 3, the set of different clique sizes is $\\{2, 3\\}$, and the number is 2.\n*   **Simultaneously appear**: All these induced subgraphs must exist in the *same* graph $G$.\n*   **Maximum possible number**: We need to consider all possible graphs on 128 vertices and find the one that gives the largest count of different clique sizes.\n\nLet $G$ be a graph on 128 vertices. Let $\\mathcal{K}(G)$ be the set of all possible integers $k$ such that there exists a subset of vertices $V_k \\subseteq V$ of size $k$ where the induced subgraph $G[V_k]$ is a complete graph $K_k$. The problem asks for the maximum possible value of $|\\mathcal{K}(G)|$ over all graphs $G$ with 128 vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Relating Induced Clique Sizes to the Clique Number\nLet's analyze the structure of the set $\\mathcal{K}(G)$.\nSuppose a graph $G$ has an induced subgraph that is a clique of size $k$. This means there is a set of $k$ vertices, let's call it $C_k$, that are all mutually adjacent.\n\nNow, consider any integer $j$ where $1 \\le j \\le k$. We can choose any subset of $j$ vertices from $C_k$. Let this subset be $C_j$. Since all vertices in the larger set $C_k$ are connected to each other, all vertices in the subset $C_j$ must also be connected to each other.\nThe subgraph induced by $C_j$, which is $G[C_j]$, will therefore be a complete graph of size $j$, i.e., a $K_j$.\n\nThis establishes a crucial property: **If a graph contains an induced clique of size $k$, it must also contain induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to $k$.**\n\nLet $\\omega(G)$ denote the clique number of the graph $G$, which is the size of the largest clique in $G$. From the reasoning above, if we have a clique of size $\\omega(G)$, we automatically have cliques of all sizes $1, 2, \\dots, \\omega(G)$. This means the set of all possible induced clique sizes is precisely $\\{1, 2, \\dots, \\omega(G)\\}$.\n\nSo, the number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in $G$ is exactly $\\omega(G)$.\n\n### Step 3: Reframing the problem\nBased on the analysis in Step 2, the original question is equivalent to a simpler one:\n**\"What is the maximum possible clique number, $\\omega(G)$, for any graph $G$ on $n=128$ vertices?\"**\n\n### Step 4: Solving the reframed problem\nLet $G$ be any graph with a set of vertices $V$ where $|V| = 128$.\nA clique is a subset of the vertex set $V$. By definition, the size of any subset of $V$ cannot exceed the size of $V$ itself.\nTherefore, the size of any clique in $G$ must be less than or equal to 128.\nThis means $\\omega(G) \\le 128$ for any graph $G$ on 128 vertices.\nSo, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n\n### Step 5: Finding a graph that achieves the maximum\nTo show that 128 is indeed the maximum possible number, we need to find at least one graph $G$ on 128 vertices that achieves this value. This means we need a graph $G$ with $\\omega(G) = 128$.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted as $K_{128}$.\nIn this graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\nThe entire set of 128 vertices is a clique, because every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\nThe size of this clique is 128. Therefore, the clique number of this graph is $\\omega(K_{128}) = 128$.\n\nAccording to our finding in Step 2, the number of different induced clique sizes in $K_{128}$ is equal to its clique number, which is 128. The set of these sizes is $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 128\\}$. For any size $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, 128\\}$, we can simply choose any $k$ vertices from $K_{128}$, and they will form an induced clique of size $k$.\n\n### Conclusion\n1.  The number of different induced clique sizes in any graph $G$ is equal to its clique number, $\\omega(G)$.\n2.  The problem is to find the maximum possible value of $\\omega(G)$ for a graph $G$ on 128 vertices.\n3.  The clique number of any graph is at most the number of vertices, so $\\omega(G) \\le 128$.\n4.  The complete graph $K_{128}$ is a graph on 128 vertices, and it has a clique number of 128.\n5.  Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
