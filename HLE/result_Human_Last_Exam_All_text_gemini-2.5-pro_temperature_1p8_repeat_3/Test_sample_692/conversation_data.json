    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the earliest known recorded date.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nFirst, let's break down the key components of the question:\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: We are looking for the oldest date found to date by archaeologists.\n*   **\"recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an artifact (like stone or ceramic), not just inferred from archaeological context (like carbon dating the object itself).\n*   **\"by a pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must have existed in the Americas before 1492. The primary candidates for early writing are civilizations in Mesoamerica (e.g., Olmec, Zapotec, Maya).\n*   **\"aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written in a native script, such as Maya hieroglyphs or the Epi-Olmec (Isthmian) script.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding Mesoamerican Calendars\nPre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures used several calendar systems. For this question, two are most relevant:\n1.  **The 260-day Calendar (Tzolk'in in Maya)**: This sacred calendar combines 13 numbers with 20 day names. A date like \"7 Manik'\" or \"1 Earthquake\" repeats every 260 days. While inscriptions of these dates are very old, they don't pinpoint a unique moment in history without more context.\n2.  **The Long Count Calendar**: This system is crucial because it is a non-repeating, linear count of days from a mythological starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in our calendar). A Long Count date specifies a unique day in history, making it an \"absolute date.\" It is written as a series of numbers representing periods of time (Baktun, Katun, Tun, Uinal, Kin).\n\nTo answer the question about the earliest \"date,\" a Long Count date is the most precise and definitive answer.\n\n### Step 3: Examining the Earliest Candidates for \"Recorded Dates\"\n\nSeveral artifacts are contenders for the earliest recorded date. It's important to differentiate between early writing, early repeating calendar dates, and early absolute (Long Count) dates.\n\n*   **Earliest Writing**: The **Cascajal Block**, found in an Olmec context and dated to around **900 BC**, is generally considered the earliest example of writing in the Americas. However, it does not contain any recognizable calendar dates.\n*   **Earliest Repeating Calendar Dates**:\n    *   **San Jos√© Mogote Monument 3**: This Zapotec monument, dated stylistically to around **600 BC**, bears a glyph believed to represent the day name \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day calendar.\n    *   **San Bartolo Murals**: Plaster fragments from the San Bartolo site in Guatemala contain a clear depiction of the day \"7 Manik'\" (or \"7 Deer\"). These fragments are securely dated by radiocarbon analysis to **300-200 BC**, making them the earliest *securely dated* instance of a calendar glyph.\n    *   **Careful Point**: While these are extremely early recorded dates, they are from the repeating 260-day cycle and do not represent a unique point in history.\n\n### Step 4: Examining the Earliest Absolute (Long Count) Dates\n\nThe key candidates for the earliest absolute date are monuments bearing Long Count inscriptions.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**\n    *   This monument from Chiapas, Mexico, has a damaged inscription. Based on the remaining numbers and artistic style, epigraphers have reconstructed the date as **7.16.3.2.13**.\n    *   In our calendar, this corresponds to **December 7, 36 BC**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This is the earliest potential Long Count date, but it is not definitively \"recorded\" because the most significant digit (the Baktun, or 7) is missing due to damage and must be inferred by scholars.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: Tres Zapotes Stela C**\n    *   This monument, found at the Epi-Olmec site of Tres Zapotes in Veracruz, Mexico, has a Long Count date inscribed on its back.\n    *   The inscription is clear and complete: **7.16.6.16.18**.\n    *   This date unambiguously translates to **September 3, 32 BC**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: For decades, this was considered the earliest known Long Count date. Unlike the Chiapa de Corzo Stela, the entire date is physically present and readable on the monument.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nComparing the candidates, the date on **Tres Zapotes Stela C** is the earliest known date that is *fully and unambiguously recorded* in an aboriginal writing system. While the date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is likely four years earlier, its reading depends on a scholarly reconstruction of a damaged inscription. Therefore, the most secure and definitive answer to the question of the earliest *recorded* date is the one from Tres Zapotes.\n\nThe date is written in the Epi-Olmec script using the Long Count system. It represents the number of days elapsed since the calendar's zero point. The inscribed date, 7.16.6.16.18, translates to a specific day in our Gregorian calendar.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe earliest known date fully and clearly recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is **September 3, 32 BC**. This date is inscribed in the Long Count calendar format (7.16.6.16.18) on **Stela C from Tres Zapotes**, an Epi-Olmec site in Veracruz, Mexico.\n\n<<<September 3, 32 BC>>>"
