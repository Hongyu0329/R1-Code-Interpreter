    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the \"Second Great War\"**: In the context of StarCraft lore, the Second Great War refers to the massive, sector-wide conflict depicted throughout the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*). It is distinct from the original \"Great War\" which was the subject of the first *StarCraft* game.\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date**: The war officially begins with the second major Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, led by the Queen of Blades. This event marks the start of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official StarCraft timeline, this takes place in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date**: The war concludes with the final defeat of the primary antagonist, the dark god Amon. This happens during the epilogue campaign of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void*, titled \"Into the Void\". According to the official timeline, these events take place in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration**:\n    *   The war starts at some point in the year 2504.\n    *   The war ends at some point in the year 2506.\n    *   This means the conflict spans parts of three distinct calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n    *   The total time elapsed is therefore more than 2 full years, but less than 3 full years. For example, if it started in March 2504 and ended in May 2506, the duration would be 2 years and 2 months.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule**: The question requires the duration in years, **rounded up**.\n    *   Since the actual duration is a value greater than 2.0 (e.g., ~2.2 years), rounding this number *up* to the next whole number gives 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Wars**: It is important not to confuse the Second Great War (*StarCraft II*) with the Brood War (the *Brood War* expansion, which ended in 2500) or the original Great War (*StarCraft*).\n*   **Defining the War's Scope**: Some might narrowly define the war as just the Terran-Zerg conflict in *Wings of Liberty*. However, the common and most complete understanding in the lore community is that the entire saga of *StarCraft II* constitutes the Second Great War, as the events flow directly into one another as part of a single continuous conflict against a singular, overarching threat (Amon, acting through his various agents).\n*   **The \"Rounded Up\" Instruction**: This is a key part of the question. A simple subtraction of years (2506 - 2504 = 2) would be incorrect because it ignores the time that has passed and the specific instruction to round up. Because the war was not exactly 2.0 years long but slightly longer, rounding up forces the answer to the next integer.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer is calculated.\n\n<<<3>>>"
