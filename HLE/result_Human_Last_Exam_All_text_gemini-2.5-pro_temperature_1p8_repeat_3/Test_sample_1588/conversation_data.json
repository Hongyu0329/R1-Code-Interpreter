    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Expansion\n\nThe BCH formula gives the solution `Z` for the equation `e^X * e^Y = e^Z`, where `X` and `Y` are non-commuting variables (typically representing elements of a Lie algebra or matrices). The solution `Z` is expressed as an infinite series of nested commutators of `X` and `Y`:\n`Z = X + Y + Z_2(X,Y) + Z_3(X,Y) + ... + Z_n(X,Y) + ...`\n\nHere, `Z_n(X,Y)` is the sum of all terms of total degree `n` (where degree is the count of `X`s and `Y`s in a term). For example:\n- **Order 1:** `Z_1 = X + Y`\n- **Order 2:** `Z_2 = (1/2)[X, Y]`\n- **Order 3:** `Z_3 = (1/12)[X, [X, Y]] - (1/12)[Y, [X, Y]]`\n\nThe question asks for the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10.\n\n### Step 2: Connecting BCH Coefficients to the Free Lie Algebra\n\nThe terms `Z_n(X,Y)` in the BCH expansion are elements of the **free Lie algebra** generated by `X` and `Y`. A key mathematical result is that the BCH formula generates all possible linearly independent Lie polynomials (basis elements) for each order `n`, and each of these basis elements appears with a non-zero coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the problem of finding the number of nonzero coefficients of order `n` is equivalent to finding the dimension of the subspace of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree `n` in two generators (`X` and `Y`). This dimension is denoted as `dim(L_n(2))`.\n\n### Step 3: Using Witt's Formula\n\nThe dimension of the subspace of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree `n` generated by `k` variables is given by **Witt's formula**:\n\n`dim(L_n(k)) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n- **n:** The order (or degree) of the polynomial. In our case, `n = 10`.\n- **k:** The number of generators (variables). In our case, `k = 2` (since we have `X` and `Y`).\n- **d|n:** The sum is taken over all positive integers `d` that are divisors of `n`.\n- **μ(d):** This is the **Möbius function**.\n\n### Step 4: Applying Witt's Formula for n=10 and k=2\n\nWe need to calculate `dim(L_10(2))`.\n\n1.  **Identify the divisors of n=10:**\n    The divisors `d` of 10 are `1, 2, 5, 10`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor:**\n    The Möbius function `μ(d)` is defined as:\n    - `μ(d) = 1` if `d` is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    - `μ(d) = -1` if `d` is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    - `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n\n    Let's calculate for our divisors:\n    - `μ(1) = 1` (By definition, 1 has 0 prime factors, which is even).\n    - `μ(2) = -1` (2 is a prime, 1 prime factor, which is odd).\n    - `μ(5) = -1` (5 is a prime, 1 prime factor, which is odd).\n    - `μ(10) = μ(2 * 5) = (-1)^2 = 1` (10 is square-free with 2 prime factors, which is even).\n\n3.  **Substitute these values into Witt's formula:**\n    `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [ μ(1)*2^(10/1) + μ(2)*2^(10/2) + μ(5)*2^(10/5) + μ(10)*2^(10/10) ]`\n\n4.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    - `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [ (1) * 2^10 + (-1) * 2^5 + (-1) * 2^2 + (1) * 2^1 ]`\n    - `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [ 1 * 1024 - 1 * 32 - 1 * 4 + 1 * 2 ]`\n    - `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [ 1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 ]`\n    - `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [ 992 - 4 + 2 ]`\n    - `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [ 988 + 2 ]`\n    - `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [ 990 ]`\n    - `dim(L_10(2)) = 99`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree 10 in two variables, which is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
