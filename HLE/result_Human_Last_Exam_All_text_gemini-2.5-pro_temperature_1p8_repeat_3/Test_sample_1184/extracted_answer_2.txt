**1) Hotspots for interaction with alpha-1 subunit (physical binding):**

These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and form the hydrophobic AID-Binding Pocket (ABP) that directly binds the alpha-1 subunit's I-II loop.

*   **Tryptophan at position 321 (W321)**
*   **Methionine at position 350 (M350)**
*   **Leucine at position 361 (L361)**
*   **Leucine at position 364 (L364)**
*   **Tryptophan at position 378 (W378)**
*   **Isoleucine at position 415 (I415)**
*   **Phenylalanine at position 434 (F434)**

**2) Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (gating modulation):**

These residues or regions are critical for the allosteric modulation of the alpha-1 subunit's function, often without being essential for the primary binding interaction itself.

*   **The N-terminal region from Methionine 1 to Aspartic Acid 34 (M1-D34):** This entire domain is a major determinant of the specific effects of the Î²1b subunit on channel inactivation kinetics.
*   **Lysine at position 308 (K308):** A critical residue for coupling the physical binding event to the functional modulation of voltage-dependent activation.
*   **Aspartic Acid at position 424 (D424):** A residue on the GK domain surface which, when mutated, alters channel modulation, demonstrating a key role in fine-tuning.
