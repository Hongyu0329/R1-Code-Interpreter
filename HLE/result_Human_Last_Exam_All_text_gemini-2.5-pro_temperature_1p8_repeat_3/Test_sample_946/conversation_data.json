    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source and Episode:** The question specifies the online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\" and the exact episode, \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". This is the primary source material.\n\n2.  **Identify the Setting and Event:** The key event within the episode is the \"Junior prom\".\n\n3.  **Identify the Subject:** The question asks about a specific character: a \"fictional singer\" represented by a \"cardboard cutout\" who \"performs\" at the prom. The term \"performs\" is used humorously, as the cutout is inanimate.\n\n4.  **Recall or Research the Scene:** In the episode, the Teen Girl Squad attends their Junior Prom. The entertainment is revealed.\n    *   First, Cheerleader exclaims with excitement, misidentifying the artist as \"K-S-K-T-V-M-T-R-L!\"\n    *   A nearby character tries to correct her, suggesting the name is \"Kasketeer\".\n    *   Immediately after, the narrator (Strong Bad) makes the official announcement.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Definitive Answer from Narration:** Strong Bad, in his role as the Teen Girl Squad's creator and narrator, clarifies the singer's name. His announcement is: \"This year's Junior Prom musical guest... all the way from some... European... country... It's a cardboard cutout of... **Kasza**!\"\n\n6.  **Confirm with On-Screen Text:** As Strong Bad announces the name, the word \"KASZA\" appears in large, stylized letters on the screen, confirming the spelling and cementing it as the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   **Fictional Context:** Kasza is a fictional artist created solely for this gag within the Homestar Runner universe.\n*   **Misleading Dialogue:** The name Cheerleader yells out (\"K-S-K-T-V-M-T-R-L!\") is a red herring and part of the joke. It is not the correct name.\n*   **The \"Performer\":** It is crucial to remember that the performer is not a live person or animated character, but specifically a cardboard cutout, as the question states.\n*   **Source of Truth:** In the context of the cartoon, the narrator's announcement and the on-screen text are the definitive sources for the correct name, superseding the dialogue of the characters within the squad.\n\nBy following these steps, we can definitively identify the name of the fictional singer.\n\n<<<Kasza>>>"
