    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Interpret the Question\n\nThe question asks for \"the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) where n = 35\".\n\nThis phrasing is unconventional and potentially ambiguous. Let's analyze possible interpretations:\n1.  **Literal Interpretation 1:** Find the minimum size of the union of vertex sets of the bipartite graphs. Let the family be $\\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k\\}$. Each $G_i$ is a subgraph of $K_n$. The vertex set of the family would be $V(\\mathcal{F}) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^k V(G_i)$. Since the family must cover all edges of $K_n$, for every edge $(u,v) \\in E(K_n)$, there must be some $G_i$ such that $(u,v) \\in E(G_i)$. This implies that both $u$ and $v$ must be in $V(G_i)$. Therefore, every vertex of $K_n$ must belong to at least one $V(G_i)$ that contains an edge incident to it. This implies that $V(\\mathcal{F})$ must be the entire vertex set of $K_n$. So, $|V(\\mathcal{F})| = n = 35$. This is a fixed value, not something to be minimized. So this interpretation is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Literal Interpretation 2:** Find the minimum of the sum of the number of vertices in each graph, i.e., $\\min \\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|$. This is a complex optimization problem related to covering designs, which is highly non-standard for this type of question and likely out of scope.\n\n3.  **Most Plausible Interpretation:** The phrasing \"number of vertices in a family\" is a misstatement for \"number of graphs in a family\". This kind of awkward phrasing can occur in translated problems or when posed by non-experts. Under this interpretation, the question is: **\"What is the minimum number of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{35}\\)?\"** This is a well-known problem in graph theory.\n\nWe will proceed with the third interpretation, as it leads to a standard and solvable problem.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Problem Mathematically\n\nLet $k$ be the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs $G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k$ of $K_n$ such that their edge sets cover all the edges of $K_n$. Formally, we want to find the smallest $k$ such that:\n$$ E(K_n) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(G_i) $$\nwhere each $G_i$ is a bipartite graph.\n\nThis value is related to the chromatic number of the graph. The key theorem states that the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs needed to cover a graph $G$ is equal to $\\lceil \\log_2(\\chi(G)) \\rceil$, where $\\chi(G)$ is the chromatic number of $G$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Theorem to \\(K_n\\)\n\n1.  **Chromatic Number of \\(K_n\\):** For a complete graph $K_n$, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Therefore, to color the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we need a unique color for each vertex. The chromatic number of $K_n$ is $\\chi(K_n) = n$.\n2.  **Applying the formula:** For $G = K_n$, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required for an edge cover is $k = \\lceil \\log_2(\\chi(K_n)) \\rceil = \\lceil \\log_2(n) \\rceil$.\n\nLet's briefly outline the proof for this formula to be thorough:\n*   **Sufficiency (Upper Bound):** To show that $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ graphs are sufficient, we can construct them. Let $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$. This implies $2^k \\ge n$. We can assign a unique binary vector of length $k$ to each of the $n$ vertices of $K_n$. For each bit position $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, we create a bipartite graph $G_j$. The vertex set of $G_j$ is partitioned into two sets: $U_j$ containing all vertices whose binary label has a 0 at the $j$-th position, and $V_j$ containing all vertices whose label has a 1 at the $j$-th position. The edges of $G_j$ are all edges of $K_n$ connecting a vertex in $U_j$ to a vertex in $V_j$. Now, consider any edge $(u, v)$ in $K_n$. Since $u$ and $v$ are distinct vertices, their assigned binary vectors must be different. This means their vectors differ in at least one bit position, say the $j$-th position. This implies that one of $u$ or $v$ is in $U_j$ and the other is in $V_j$. Therefore, the edge $(u,v)$ is included in the graph $G_j$. As this holds for any edge, the family $\\{G_1, \\dots, G_k\\}$ covers all edges of $K_n$.\n*   **Necessity (Lower Bound):** Suppose $k$ bipartite graphs $G_1, \\dots, G_k$ cover all edges of $K_n$. For each graph $G_i$, its vertices can be partitioned into two sets $(U_i, V_i)$. We can assign a binary vector of length $k$ to each vertex $v$ of $K_n$, where the $i$-th bit is 0 if $v \\in U_i$ and 1 if $v \\in V_i$. Now, consider any two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$. They form an edge in $K_n$. Since the graphs form a cover, the edge $(u, v)$ must belong to at least one graph, say $G_j$. Since $(u, v)$ is an edge in the bipartite graph $G_j$, $u$ and $v$ must lie in different partitions of $G_j$. This means the $j$-th bit of their assigned binary vectors will be different. Therefore, any two distinct vertices in $K_n$ will have different binary vectors. Since there are $n$ vertices, we need at least $n$ unique binary vectors of length $k$. The total number of unique binary vectors of length $k$ is $2^k$. So, we must have $n \\le 2^k$. Taking the logarithm base 2 gives $\\log_2(n) \\le k$. Since $k$ must be an integer, we have $k \\ge \\lceil \\log_2(n) \\rceil$.\n\nCombining both parts, we confirm that the minimum number of bipartite graphs is indeed $k = \\lceil \\log_2(n) \\rceil$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer for n = 35\n\nWe need to calculate $k = \\lceil \\log_2(35) \\rceil$.\n\nWe can look at powers of 2:\n*   $2^5 = 32$\n*   $2^6 = 64$\n\nSince $32 < 35 \\le 64$, we know that $5 < \\log_2(35) \\le 6$.\nThe ceiling function $\\lceil x \\rceil$ gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.\nTherefore, $\\lceil \\log_2(35) \\rceil = 6$.\n\nThe minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all edges of $K_{35}$ is 6. Based on our interpretation, this is the final answer."
