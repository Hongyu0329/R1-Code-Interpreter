    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct \"Sir Launfal\":** The question refers to the medieval poem, not the 19th-century \"The Vision of Sir Launfal\" by James Russell Lowell. The medieval romance \"Sir Launfal\" was written by Thomas Chestre around the late 14th century. The context of being \"preserved alongside\" a \"book of manners\" points directly to an original manuscript source.\n\n2.  **Locate the Manuscript:** Thomas Chestre's \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in a single, unique manuscript. This important document is **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, which is held in the British Library. Since this is the only manuscript containing the poem, any text preserved \"alongside\" it must also be in this manuscript.\n\n3.  **Examine the Contents of the Manuscript:** Cotton MS Caligula A.ii is an anthology, a collection of various Middle English texts bound together. Besides \"Sir Launfal\", it contains several other romances and poems, such as *Libeaus Desconus*, *Emare*, and *The Squyr of Lowe Degre*.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\":** Among the diverse texts in this manuscript is one that fits the description of a \"book of manners\". This genre, also known as a \"courtesy book,\" was popular in the Middle Ages and provided instruction on etiquette, social conduct, and morality. The specific text in Cotton MS Caligula A.ii is a poem on courtesy.\n\n5.  **Name the Specific Book:** The book of manners found in the manuscript is known as **The Boke of Curtasye**, which translates to **The Book of Courtesy**. It is a didactic poem that outlines the proper behavior for a young man, especially one serving in a great household.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct \"Sir Launfal\":** It is essential not to confuse Thomas Chestre's medieval romance with James Russell Lowell's later, more famous poem.\n*   **Uniqueness of the Manuscript:** The fact that the poem exists in only one manuscript makes the identification of its companion texts definitive.\n*   **Genre Identification:** Understanding what a \"book of manners\" or \"courtesy book\" was in a medieval context is key to identifying the correct text from the manuscript's table of contents.\n*   **Alternate Titles:** The work is most commonly referred to as \"The Boke of Curtasye\" or \"The Book of Courtesy,\" but may sometimes be referenced by its first line or as a \"boke of norture\" (book of good breeding).\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy following the steps, we have confirmed that the poem \"Sir Launfal\" is in the manuscript Cotton MS Caligula A.ii. We then analyzed the contents of this manuscript and identified the text that serves as a \"book of manners\". This text is the Middle English poem known as *The Boke of Curtasye*.\n\n<<<The Book of Courtesy>>>"
