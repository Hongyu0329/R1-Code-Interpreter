    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific character in William Morris's novel *The House of the Wolfings*. The key criteria for this character are:\n    *   They visited a Roman city.\n    *   They describe Roman religious practices.\n    *   This description contains a clear reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus (twin founders of Rome suckled by a she-wolf).\n\n2.  **Survey the Characters:** First, we must consider the main characters and their backgrounds to see who fits the criteria.\n    *   **Thiodolf:** The war-leader of the Wolfings. His experience with Romans is as an enemy on the battlefield. It is unlikely he spent time in a Roman city observing their culture peacefully.\n    *   **Hall-Sun:** The semi-divine foster-daughter of Thiodolf. Her realm is the forest and the world of the Goths and their gods. She has no backstory involving travel to Roman lands.\n    *   **Wolfing Warriors/Elders:** Like Thiodolf, their knowledge of Romans is primarily as an enemy force they are about to fight.\n    *   **Otter:** A thrall (a servant or slave) in the house of the Wolfings. His backstory is significant: he was captured by the Romans in his youth and lived among them as a slave before escaping or being freed and returning to his people.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidates:** Based on the character backgrounds, Otter is the only logical candidate. His time as a captive would have given him firsthand experience of Roman life, cities, and customs, which none of the other Goths possess.\n\n4.  **Locate the Scene in the Text:** We must find the passage where this character shares their knowledge. This occurs early in the book, in **Chapter III: The House of the Wolfings is Sitting in the Hall**. The Wolfings have gathered to discuss the impending threat of the Romans, and they ask Otter to speak about the enemy he knows so well.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Character's Description:** During his speech to the assembled tribe, Otter describes the Romans' power, their stone cities, and their beliefs. He specifically recounts the founding myth of their great city. He tells the Goths how the Romans depict in images \"a She-wolf giving suck to twin men-children,\" and that they hold this story in high honour.\n\n6.  **Connect to Romulus and Remus:** The description of a she-wolf nursing two male infants is an unmistakable allusion to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus. For Morris's contemporary readers, and anyone familiar with classical history, this reference would be immediately recognizable.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Perspective:** The story is told from the point of view of the Goths. Therefore, Otter does not name \"Romulus and Remus\" or \"Rome.\" He describes what he saw and heard in a way his fellow tribespeople would understand, making the familiar myth seem foreign and strange.\n*   **Cultural Contrast:** Morris uses this scene to highlight the profound cultural gap between the Goths and the Romans. The Wolfings revere the wolf as an ancestor and a symbol of their own strength and wildness. They are both fascinated and disturbed to hear that the Romans, their enemy, also have a foundational story involving a wolf, but one that is framed very differently.\n*   **Role of the Character:** Otter is a minor character, but his role as an informant is crucial for world-building and establishing the nature of the enemy. His unique experience makes him a bridge of knowledge between the two conflicting cultures.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis confirms that the character who was among the Romans and described their founding myth is the thrall, Otter. He does this in Chapter III while addressing the leaders of the Wolfing tribe.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
