    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### I. Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Connecting Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics\n\nThe core idea of Large Deviation Theory (LDT) is to quantify the probability of rare events. In statistical mechanics, any macroscopic state other than the equilibrium state is a \"rare event\" for a large system. The equilibrium state is the overwhelmingly most probable state.\n\n*   **Boltzmann's Entropy and Sanov's Theorem:** Boltzmann's principle states that the entropy $S$ of a macrostate is proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates $\\Omega$ corresponding to it: $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. The probability of this macrostate is proportional to $\\Omega$, so $P(\\text{macrostate}) \\propto e^{S/k_B}$.\n    Sanov's Theorem in LDT states that the probability of an empirical measure deviating from its expected form decays exponentially, with the rate given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The KL divergence acts as a rate function, $I$. We have $P(\\text{macrostate}) \\sim e^{-N \\cdot I}$, where $N$ is the system size.\n    Comparing these, we see that maximizing entropy ($S$) is equivalent to minimizing the rate function ($I$). Therefore, Sanov's theorem provides a rigorous foundation for the **Principle of Maximum Entropy**, which we use to find the equilibrium distribution.\n\n*   **Canonical Ensemble and Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** Cramer's theorem (or the Chernoff bound) describes the probability of the average of a set of random variables deviating from its expected value. The probability of such a deviation decays exponentially with a rate function, $I(a)$. The rate function is zero only when the average equals the expected value, $I(\\langle x \\rangle) = 0$.\n    In the canonical ensemble, the system's energy fluctuates around a mean value, $\\langle E \\rangle$, determined by the temperature of a heat bath. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem justifies taking this canonical average $\\langle E \\rangle$ as the equilibrium energy, because any other energy value is a large deviation with an exponentially small probability.\n\nTherefore, LDT justifies finding the equilibrium state by either:\na) Maximizing the statistical entropy $S$ subject to macroscopic constraints.\nb) Calculating the average values of observables (like energy) in the appropriate statistical ensemble (here, the canonical ensemble for photons).\n\nWe will follow approach (b), as it is more direct for this problem.\n\n#### Step 2: Formulating the Problem for a Photon Gas\n\n*   **System:** A gas of photons (light quanta) in a volume $V$ at thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at temperature $T$.\n*   **Particle Properties:** Photons are indistinguishable bosons.\n*   **Key Constraint:** The number of photons is not conserved. This implies that the chemical potential is zero, $\\mu=0$. The system is described by the grand canonical ensemble with $\\mu=0$, which is effectively a canonical ensemble formalism where each energy mode is treated independently.\n*   **Partition Function:** The grand canonical partition function $\\mathcal{Z}$ for a system of non-interacting bosons is a product of the partition functions for each single-particle energy state (or mode) $\\epsilon_i$.\n    $\\mathcal{Z} = \\prod_i \\mathcal{Z}_i$\n    For a single bosonic mode $i$ with energy $\\epsilon_i$, the partition function is the sum over all possible occupation numbers $n_i=0, 1, 2, ...$:\n    $\\mathcal{Z}_i = \\sum_{n_i=0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_i - \\mu)n_i}$\n    With $\\mu=0$ for photons, this is a geometric series:\n    $\\mathcal{Z}_i = \\sum_{n_i=0}^{\\infty} (e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})^{n_i} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}}$\n    The total partition function is:\n    $\\mathcal{Z} = \\prod_i \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}}$\n    The logarithm is more convenient to work with:\n    $\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = -\\sum_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})$\n\n#### Step 3: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy $\\langle E \\rangle$\n\nAs justified by LDT, the equilibrium energy is the canonical average, given by:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = U = -\\frac{\\partial (\\ln \\mathcal{Z})}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left(-\\sum_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})\\right) = \\sum_i \\frac{\\epsilon_i e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}}{1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}} = \\sum_i \\frac{\\epsilon_i}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n\nTo evaluate this sum, we convert it to an integral over a continuous energy spectrum using the density of states $g(\\epsilon)$ for photons in a 3D box of volume $V$. Including the two polarization states, the number of modes between energy $\\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon+d\\epsilon$ is:\n$g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{V \\epsilon^2}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} d\\epsilon$\n$U = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon} - 1} g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon} - 1} \\frac{V \\epsilon^2}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3} d\\epsilon = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n\nWe solve the integral using the substitution $x = \\beta\\epsilon$:\n$U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(x/\\beta)^3}{e^x - 1} \\frac{dx}{\\beta} = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^4} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\nThe definite integral is a standard result related to the Riemann-Zeta function: $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 3! \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\nSubstituting this back, we get the equilibrium mean energy:\n$U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^4} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi^2 V}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^4}$\nExpressing this in terms of temperature $T$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = U = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^4$\nThis is the famous Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy S\n\nThe equilibrium entropy $S$ is given by the thermodynamic relation:\n$S = k_B(\\ln \\mathcal{Z} + \\beta U)$\nFirst, we must calculate $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}$ by integrating:\n$\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = -\\int_0^{\\infty} g(\\epsilon)\\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon})d\\epsilon = -\\frac{V}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3}\\int_0^{\\infty} \\epsilon^2 \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon})d\\epsilon$\nUsing the same substitution $x=\\beta\\epsilon$:\n$\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = -\\frac{V}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^3} \\int_0^{\\infty} x^2 \\ln(1-e^{-x}) dx$\nWe integrate by parts: $\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du$. Let $u = \\ln(1-e^{-x})$ and $dv = x^2dx$.\nThis yields $\\int_0^{\\infty} x^2 \\ln(1-e^{-x}) dx = -\\frac{1}{3}\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{e^x-1}dx = -\\frac{1}{3} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = -\\frac{\\pi^4}{45}$.\nSo, the logarithm of the partition function is:\n$\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = -\\frac{V}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^3} \\left(-\\frac{\\pi^4}{45}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi^2 V}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^3}$\n\nNow we combine the terms for entropy:\n$S = k_B \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 V}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^3} + \\beta \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 V}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^4} \\right) \\right)$\n$S = k_B \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 V}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^3} + \\frac{\\pi^2 V}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^3} \\right) = k_B \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 V + 3\\pi^2 V}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^3} \\right)$\n$S = k_B \\frac{4\\pi^2 V}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^3}$\nSubstituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$S = \\frac{4\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^3$\n\n### II. Careful Points\n\n1.  **Photon Gas Properties:** It is crucial to remember that photons are bosons for which the particle number is not conserved, which sets the chemical potential $\\mu=0$.\n2.  **LDT Justification:** The role of the named theorems is to provide a rigorous mathematical justification for using the standard methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics (e.g., maximizing entropy or using canonical averages).\n3.  **Density of States:** The correct density of states for a relativistic, massless particle in 3D, including the two polarization states, is essential for converting sums to integrals correctly.\n4.  **Integral Evaluation:** The calculations hinge on correctly evaluating specific definite integrals, which are standard forms related to the Gamma and Riemann-Zeta functions.\n5.  **Final Form:** The equilibrium values are not constants but functions of the system's macroscopic state variables, typically volume $V$ and temperature $T$.\n\n### III. Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe equilibrium values are those of the most probable macroscopic state. As justified by Large Deviation Theory (Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems), this state corresponds to the average values calculated in the canonical ensemble.\n\n1.  **Mean Energy:** Starting from the partition function for a photon gas, $\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = -\\sum_i \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})$, we calculate the mean energy as $U = -\\partial(\\ln \\mathcal{Z})/\\partial \\beta$. Converting the sum to an integral with the photon density of states and evaluating it yields the Stefan-Boltzmann energy law.\n2.  **Entropy:** The entropy is found using the relation $S = k_B(\\ln\\mathcal{Z} + \\beta U)$. The value of $\\ln\\mathcal{Z}$ is found by integration, and when combined with the previously found value for $U$, it gives the final expression for the entropy of the photon gas.\n\nThe final equilibrium values are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^4$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n$S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^3$\n\nThese are also related by the simple expression $S = \\frac{4}{3}\\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T}$.\n\n<<<**Equilibrium Mean Energy**: $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^4$\n**Equilibrium Entropy**: $S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^3$>>>"
