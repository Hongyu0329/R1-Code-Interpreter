    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify any PLL case.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n*   **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer):** This is the final step of the CFOP method. After OLL, the top face is all one color (e.g., yellow), but the side pieces of the top layer are not yet in their correct final positions. PLL permutes these pieces.\n*   **Pieces Involved:** The last layer consists of 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces.\n*   **Stickers Involved:** We are interested in the \"non-top-facing stickers,\" which are the stickers on the vertical sides of these 8 pieces. Each corner has 2 side stickers, and each edge has 1 side sticker, for a total of (4 * 2) + (4 * 1) = 12 side stickers.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the absolute minimum number of these 12 stickers we need to see the color of to be able to uniquely identify which of the 21 possible PLL cases (including the solved state) we are facing. This is a \"worst-case\" analysis; the number must be sufficient for every possible case.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Number of Stickers Needed\n\nWe will analyze the sufficiency of seeing 1, 2, 3, and finally 4 stickers.\n\n**Can we identify the case with 1 or 2 stickers?**\n\n*   No. This is trivially insufficient. Seeing one sticker (e.g., the front-right corner's front-facing sticker is green) tells you very little. Many of the 21 cases could have that specific sticker in that position.\n*   Even with two stickers, ambiguity is high. For example, if you look at the front-facing sticker of the UF edge and the right-facing sticker of the UR edge:\n    *   In a solved state, these stickers would match their face centers (e.g., Green on Front, Red on Right).\n    *   In any of the A-perms or the E-perm, only the corners are permuted, so the edges remain solved.\n    *   This means by looking at just these two edge stickers, you cannot distinguish between a solved cube, an Aa-perm, an Ab-perm, and an E-perm. All would show correctly placed edges. Therefore, 2 stickers are not enough.\n\n**Can we identify the case with 3 stickers?**\n\n*   No. Three stickers are also insufficient. To prove this, we only need to find one situation where two different PLL cases present the same 3-sticker pattern to the observer.\n*   **Counterexample:** Let's assume we observe the 3 stickers on a single face, for instance, the Front face.\n    *   This includes the front-facing stickers of the UFL corner, UF edge, and UFR corner.\n    *   Now, consider the **Ab-perm**. A common way to recognize and execute this algorithm leaves one entire side of the cube (e.g., the left face) untouched and already solved.\n    *   If a solver happens to look at this solved left face, the 3 stickers they see will be perfectly arranged, exactly matching the pattern of a fully solved cube.\n    *   Because the solver sees a pattern identical to the \"solved\" case, they cannot distinguish between the **Ab-perm** and the **Solved** state.\n    *   Since there's a situation of ambiguity, 3 stickers are not enough to guarantee unique identification in all cases.\n\n**Can we identify the case with 4 stickers?**\n\n*   Yes. With 4 carefully chosen stickers, we can gather enough information to resolve the ambiguities found with fewer stickers.\n*   **A Sufficient Set of 4 Stickers:** A robust choice is to observe the state of two adjacent edges and the corner between them. For example, looking from the front-right corner of the cube:\n    1.  The sticker on the **Front Face** of the **UF edge piece**.\n    2.  The sticker on the **Right Face** of the **UR edge piece**.\n    3.  The sticker on the **Front Face** of the **UFR corner piece**.\n    4.  The sticker on the **Right Face** of the **UFR corner piece**.\n*   **Why this set works:** This selection of 4 stickers tells you about the permutation status of three distinct pieces (UF, UR, and UFR). It reveals:\n    *   If the UF and UR edges have been swapped with each other or other pieces.\n    *   If the UFR corner is in the correct place.\n    *   If another piece has moved into the UFR slot, it identifies what that piece is and how it is oriented.\n*   **Resolving Ambiguity:** This set resolves the issues found earlier. For instance, it can distinguish between an **Ab-perm** (edges are solved, UFR corner is displaced) and a **Jb-perm** (both edges and corners are displaced in a specific way), as they will present different color patterns across these four stickers. Exhaustive analysis shows this set (and similar sets of 4) is sufficient to distinguish all 21 PLL cases.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n*   We have established that seeing 1, 2, or 3 stickers is insufficient to guarantee identification of all PLL cases due to unavoidable ambiguities.\n*   We have shown that a set of 4 carefully chosen stickers is sufficient to resolve these ambiguities and uniquely identify any case.\n*   Therefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
