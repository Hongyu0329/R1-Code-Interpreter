    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ in the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, $G_0(x, x')$, is a two-point correlation function for a system described by a non-interacting Hamiltonian, $H_0$. In the path integral formalism, it is expressed as a functional integral over field configurations $\\psi(x)$ and $\\psi^*(x)$ (which are Grassmann variables for fermions).\n\nLet $x = (\\mathbf{r}, t)$. The Green's function is given by:\n$G_0(x, x') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x) \\psi^*(x') \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}$\n\nThe action for a non-interacting system, $S_0$, is:\n$S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int dt \\int d^3r \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0 \\right) \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\nHere, $H_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator, which acts on the spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{r}$.\n\n**Step 2: Diagonalize the Hamiltonian Operator**\n\nThe key to revealing the dependence on the energy eigenvalues is to switch to a basis where the operator $H_0$ is diagonal. Let $|\\phi_k\\rangle$ be the orthonormal eigenstates of $H_0$ with corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n$H_0 |\\phi_k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |\\phi_k\\rangle$\n\nThe eigenfunctions in the position representation are $\\phi_k(\\mathbf{r}) = \\langle \\mathbf{r} | \\phi_k \\rangle$. We can expand the field operator $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ in this basis:\n$\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\sum_k \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r}) c_k(t)$\n$\\psi^*(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\sum_k \\phi_k^*(\\mathbf{r}) c_k^*(t)$\n\nThe variables $c_k(t)$ and $c_k^*(t)$ are new Grassmann-valued functions of time, representing the field in the energy eigenbasis.\n\n**Step 3: Express the Action in the Energy Eigenbasis**\n\nNow, we substitute this expansion back into the action $S_0$:\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\sum_{k,k'} \\int d^3r \\, \\phi_{k'}^*(\\mathbf{r}) c_{k'}^*(t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0 \\right) \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r}) c_k(t)$\n\nUsing the facts that $H_0 \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r})$ and that the eigenfunctions are orthonormal, $\\int d^3r \\, \\phi_{k'}^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r}) = \\delta_{k'k}$, the action simplifies significantly:\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\sum_{k,k'} c_{k'}^*(t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\delta_{k'k} - \\epsilon_k \\delta_{k'k} \\right) c_k(t)$\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\, c_k^*(t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k \\right) c_k(t)$\n\nThis procedure decouples the action into a sum of independent actions for each mode `k`. The energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ now explicitly appears as a parameter in the action for mode `k`.\n\n**Step 4: Fourier Transform to Frequency Space**\n\nThe term $(i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k)$ suggests a Fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency domain to turn the differential operator into a simple algebraic expression. We define the Fourier transforms (setting $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity):\n$c_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{-i\\omega t} c_k(\\omega)$\n$c_k^*(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{i\\omega t} c_k^*(\\omega)$\n\nThe derivative term becomes $i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\omega$. The action in the frequency-eigenstate space is:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\, c_k^*(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Green's Function in the Diagonal Basis**\n\nThe Green's function in this basis, $G_0(k, k', \\omega, \\omega')$, is the expectation value $\\langle c_k(\\omega) c_{k'}^*(\\omega') \\rangle$. Due to the decoupled nature of the action, this will be zero unless $k=k'$ and the frequencies match.\nLet's call the diagonal component $G_0(k, \\omega)$. The path integral for this component is related to the inverse of the kernel of the quadratic term in the action. The kernel for mode $(k, \\omega)$ is precisely $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\nTherefore, the Green's function for the mode `k` at frequency $\\omega$ is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 6: The $i\\epsilon$ Prescription for Feynman Propagator**\n\nThe expression above has a pole on the real axis at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$, which makes the path integral ill-defined. To correctly implement the time-ordering of the Feynman Green's function and ensure convergence, a small imaginary part, $i\\epsilon$ (where $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$), is added to the denominator. The sign of this term depends on whether the state $\\epsilon_k$ is occupied or unoccupied relative to the Fermi level, $\\mu$. This leads to the final form:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\epsilon \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n### Summary of Functional Dependence and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Inverse Proportionality**: The fundamental functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is inverse proportionality to the linear difference between the frequency variable $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  **Poles at Eigenenergies**: The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane are located at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. This is a profound result: the poles of the non-interacting propagator directly reveal the spectrum of the single-particle Hamiltonian.\n3.  **Decoupling is Key**: The dependence is revealed by transforming to a basis where the single-particle Hamiltonian $H_0$ is diagonal. This decouples the system into a collection of independent modes, each characterized by its energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n4.  **$i\\epsilon$ is Crucial**: The $i\\epsilon$ prescription is not a minor detail but is essential to define the propagator correctly for time-ordered products and to handle the poles during integration. It dictates the causal structure of the propagation.\n\nIn conclusion, the bare Green's function $G_0$ depends on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ as poles in the denominator of its frequency-domain representation.\n\n***\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ in the energy eigenstate and frequency domain representation, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ as an inverse function of the form $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$. The single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ correspond to the locations of the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane.\n\n<<<The functional dependence is $G_0 \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$, where $\\omega$ is the frequency variable. The single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ appear as the locations of the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane.>>>"
