    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Terminology**\n\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space. Let's call it $X$.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every non-degenerate subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is the most famous example. A key feature of these continua is that they are one-dimensional.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $p$ in an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of $p$, denoted $C(p)$, is the union of all proper subcontinua of $K$ that contain $p$. In a non-degenerate metric indecomposable continuum, there are uncountably many ($c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$) distinct composants, each being a dense subset.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification ($\\beta Y$):** For a Tychonoff space $Y$ (which includes all metric spaces), $\\beta Y$ is the \"largest\" possible compactification of $Y$.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder ($Y^*$):** The set of points in the compactification that are not in the original space, i.e., $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$. In our case, $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. The question is about the number of composants of the remainder $R = (X \\setminus \\{x\\})^*$.\n\n**2. Understanding the Space and its Remainder**\n\n*   $X$ is a compact metric space. $x$ is a point in $X$.\n*   The space we are compactifying is $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. This is a locally compact, non-compact, sigma-compact metric space.\n*   The Stone-Cech remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is the set of \"ideal points\" at infinity needed to compactify $Y$. Since $X$ is itself a compactification of $Y$ with a single-point remainder $\\{x\\}$, there is a continuous surjective map $\\pi: \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\to X$ which is the identity on $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ and maps the entire remainder $R$ to the point $x$. So, $R = \\pi^{-1}(x)$.\n\n**3. Key Theorems**\n\nTo solve this problem, we rely on some deep results from continuum theory, primarily due to David Bellamy and Howard Cook from the early 1970s.\n\n*   **Theorem 1 (Bellamy, 1971):** If $X$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum and $x \\in X$, then the Stone-Cech remainder $R = (X \\setminus \\{x\\})^*$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Our $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum, so it is indecomposable. This theorem applies, and we know that the remainder $R$ is an indecomposable continuum. We now need to find the number of its composants.\n\n*   **Theorem 2 (Property of Hereditary Indecomposable Continua):** In a hereditary indecomposable continuum, every composant is *terminal*. A composant $C$ is terminal if there is a proper subcontinuum $K$ of $X$ such that $C$ is the only composant that intersects $K$. This implies that for any two distinct composants $C_1, C_2$ of $X$, there exists a subcontinuum $L \\subset X$ such that $X \\setminus L$ is the union of two disjoint open sets $U_1, U_2$ with $C_1 \\subset U_1$ and $C_2 \\subset U_2$. This is a very strong separation property.\n\n**4. Relating Composants of X to the Remainder R**\n\n*   Let $\\mathcal{C}(X)$ be the set of composants of $X$. For a metric indecomposable continuum, $|\\mathcal{C}(X)| = c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n*   The composants of $X$ partition the space $X$. Let's analyze how they relate to the remainder $R$. For each composant $K \\in \\mathcal{C}(X)$, let $K'$ be its part in $Y = X\\setminus\\{x\\}$, i.e., $K' = K \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n*   Let's define the \"trace\" of each composant of $X$ on the remainder $R$. For each $K \\in \\mathcal{C}(X)$, let $K^* = \\text{cl}_{\\beta Y}(K') \\cap R$.\n*   We can make the following deductions:\n    1.  **Partition of the Remainder:** The collection of sets $\\{K^* \\mid K \\in \\mathcal{C}(X)\\}$ forms a partition of the remainder $R$ into pairwise disjoint sets. The disjointness follows from the strong separation property (Theorem 2) of composants in a hereditary indecomposable continuum. This property ensures that for any two distinct composants $K_1, K_2$, their corresponding sets in $Y$, $K_1'$ and $K_2'$, can be placed in separated open subsets of $Y$, which implies their closures in $\\beta Y$ do not intersect. Thus $K_1^*$ and $K_2^*$ are disjoint.\n    2.  **Nature of the Pieces:** It is a further result (Bellamy, 1971) that each of these trace sets, $K^*$, is itself a non-degenerate continuum. So, $R$ is decomposed into a family of $c$ disjoint subcontinua.\n\n**5. Counting the Composants of R**\n\nWe now have a bijection between the composants of $X$ and the pieces $K^*$ that form the remainder $R$. The final step is to connect these pieces to the composants of $R$.\n\n*   **Theorem 3 (Bellamy, Cook):** For any two distinct composants $K_1, K_2$ of $X$, their traces $K_1^*$ and $K_2^*$ lie in distinct composants of $R$.\n*   This theorem provides an injective map from the set of composants of $X$ to the set of composants of $R$. Therefore, the number of composants of $R$ must be at least the number of composants of $X$, which is $c$.\n    *   $|\\mathcal{C}(R)| \\geq |\\mathcal{C}(X)| = c$.\n\n*   Can there be more than $c$ composants? Let's see if the map is also surjective.\n    *   Let $C_R$ be any composant of the remainder $R$.\n    *   Pick any point $p \\in C_R$.\n    *   Since the sets $\\{K^* \\mid K \\in \\mathcal{C}(X)\\}$ partition $R$, there must be a unique composant $K_p \\in \\mathcal{C}(X)$ such that $p \\in K_p^*$.\n    *   We know $K_p^*$ is a continuum in $R$ containing $p$.\n    *   By the definition of a composant, any subcontinuum containing $p$ must be a subset of the composant of $p$. Therefore, $K_p^* \\subseteq C_R$.\n    *   This implies that the entire composant $C_R$ is the one that contains the subcontinuum $K_p^*$.\n    *   So, every composant of $R$ arises from (i.e., contains) exactly one of the $K^*$ pieces.\n    *   This means the injective map from above is also surjective. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the composants of $X$ and the composants of $R$.\n\n*   Therefore, the number of composants of $R$ is exactly equal to the number of composants of $X$. For a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum, this number is $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n**6. The \"Maximum Possible\" Clause**\n\nThe question asks for the \"maximum possible\" number. Our analysis shows that for any hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$, the number is fixed at $c$. The reason for this phrasing is likely that if the condition on $X$ is weakened (e.g., to just \"indecomposable\" but not \"hereditary\"), the number of composants of the remainder can be smaller than $c$. The strong separation property (Theorem 2) can fail, leading to some $K_1^*$ and $K_2^*$ intersecting and thus merging into a single composant of $R$. The hereditary indecomposable case is the one that guarantees the richest, most separated structure in the remainder, thus achieving the maximum number of composants.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder is equal to the number of composants of the original continuum $X$. For any non-degenerate metric indecomposable continuum, this number is $c$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThe final answer is the cardinal number $c$, which is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n>>>$2^{\\aleph_0}$"
