A finite group G is a filled nilpotent group if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, `G = \prod G_p`, where each Sylow subgroup `G_p` is a filled p-group. The classification of filled p-groups is as follows:
1.  For a prime `p > 3`, `G_p` must be a cyclic group `C_{p^k}` for some `k \ge 0`.
2.  For `p = 3`, `G_3` must be a cyclic group `C_{3^k}` for some `k \ge 0`, or the group `C_3 \times C_3`.
3.  For `p = 2`, `G_2` must be a cyclic group `C_{2^k}` for some `k \ge 0`, the group `C_2 \times C_2`, or a generalized quaternion group `Q_{2^k}` for some `k \ge 3`.

(Note: `k=0` corresponds to the trivial Sylow p-subgroup).
