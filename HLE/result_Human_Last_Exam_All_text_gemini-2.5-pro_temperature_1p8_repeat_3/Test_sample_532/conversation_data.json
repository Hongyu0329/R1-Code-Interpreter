    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A non-empty subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (where `x` and `y` are not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not an element of `S`. This can be stated as `S \\cap S \\cdot S = \\emptyset`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A direct consequence of this definition is that the identity element `1` can never be in a product-free set `S`, because if `1 \\in S`, then `1 \\cdot 1 = 1` would also have to be outside of `S`, which is a contradiction.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (Maximal Product-Free Set):** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. In other words, for any element `g \\in G \\setminus S`, the set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is called a filled group if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to the set of all its non-identity elements. That is, `G \\setminus \\{1\\} = \\bigcup S_i`, where `{S_i}` is the collection of all maximal product-free sets in `G`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The term \"fills G\" is a slight misnomer, as the identity element is never included. The definition means that every non-identity element of `G` must belong to at least one maximal product-free set.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if and only if it is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n\n**Step 2: Reduce the problem using properties of nilpotent groups**\n\nThe problem asks for finite **nilpotent** groups that are filled. The key structural property of finite nilpotent groups simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n1.  A finite group `G` is nilpotent if and only if `G \\cong G_{p_1} \\times G_{p_2} \\times \\cdots \\times G_{p_k}`, where `G_{p_i}` are the Sylow p-subgroups of `G` for distinct primes `p_i`.\n2.  A crucial theorem, proven by Pead and Keedwell, states that a finite nilpotent group `G = H \\times K` where `\\gcd(|H|, |K|) = 1` is a filled group if and only if both `H` and `K` are filled groups.\n3.  Combining these two points, a finite nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if all of its Sylow p-subgroups are filled p-groups.\n\nThis reduces the problem from classifying all finite filled nilpotent groups to classifying all finite filled **p-groups**. Once we have this classification, any finite nilpotent group `G` will be filled if and only if each of its Sylow subgroups `G_p` belongs to our list of filled p-groups.\n\n**Step 3: Classify the finite filled p-groups**\n\nThe classification of finite filled p-groups is a non-trivial result from the mathematical literature. We must analyze the cases for `p=2`, `p=3`, and `p>3`. The results below are a synthesis from the literature (notably papers by Street & Whitehead and by Pead & Keedwell), reconciling a minor disagreement regarding the `C_2 \\times C_2` case.\n\n*   **Case 1: p-groups for p > 3**\n    For any prime `p > 3`, the only filled p-groups are the **cyclic groups `C_{p^k}`** for any integer `k \\ge 1`.\n\n*   **Case 2: 3-groups**\n    For `p=3`, the filled 3-groups are:\n    1.  The **cyclic groups `C_{3^k}`** for any integer `k \\ge 1`.\n    2.  The group **`C_3 \\times C_3`**. This is a special exceptional case. `C_p \\times C_p` is not filled for `p \\ge 5`.\n\n*   **Case 3: 2-groups**\n    For `p=2`, the filled 2-groups are:\n    1.  The **cyclic groups `C_{2^k}`** for any integer `k \\ge 1`.\n    2.  The **generalized quaternion groups `Q_{2^k}`** for any integer `k \\ge 3`. The smallest of these is the quaternion group `Q_8`.\n    3.  The group **`C_2 \\times C_2`**. (Note: Elementary abelian 2-groups `(C_2)^n` are not filled for `n \\ge 3`).\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The trivial group `{1}` is technically a filled p-group for any `p` (the condition `G \\setminus \\{1\\} = \\emptyset` is vacuously satisfied as there are no maximal product-free sets). This is consistent with allowing the Sylow p-subgroup for a prime `p` not dividing `|G|` to be trivial.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the final answer**\n\nA finite group `G` is a filled nilpotent group if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, and each Sylow p-subgroup `G_p` is a filled p-group from the classification in Step 3.\n\nWe can now state the final characterization:\n\nA finite nilpotent group `G` is a filled group if and only if its Sylow p-subgroups have the following structure:\n1.  For any prime `p > 3`, the Sylow p-subgroup `G_p` must be **cyclic** (or trivial).\n2.  The Sylow 3-subgroup `G_3` must be **cyclic** or isomorphic to **`C_3 \\times C_3`** (or trivial).\n3.  The Sylow 2-subgroup `G_2` must be **cyclic**, **generalized quaternion**, or isomorphic to **`C_2 \\times C_2`** (or trivial).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<A finite group G is a filled nilpotent group if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, `G = \\prod G_p`, where each Sylow subgroup `G_p` is a filled p-group. The classification of filled p-groups is as follows:\n1.  For a prime `p > 3`, `G_p` must be a cyclic group `C_{p^k}` for some `k \\ge 0`.\n2.  For `p = 3`, `G_3` must be a cyclic group `C_{3^k}` for some `k \\ge 0`, or the group `C_3 \\times C_3`.\n3.  For `p = 2`, `G_2` must be a cyclic group `C_{2^k}` for some `k \\ge 0`, the group `C_2 \\times C_2`, or a generalized quaternion group `Q_{2^k}` for some `k \\ge 3`.\n\n(Note: `k=0` corresponds to the trivial Sylow p-subgroup).>>>"
