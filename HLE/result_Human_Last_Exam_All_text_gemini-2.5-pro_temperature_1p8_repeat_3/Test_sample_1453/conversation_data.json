    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given protein sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that have a characteristic repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat. This repeat is denoted by the letters `(a b c d e f g)n`. The identity of the amino acids at specific positions within this repeat determines how the helices pack together.\n\n*   **Positions `a` and `d`** are the most critical. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic (nonpolar) amino acids. These residues face inward and pack together to form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil, which is the primary stabilizing force.\n*   **Positions `e` and `g`** are often charged or polar residues. They are located on the edges of the hydrophobic core and can form salt bridges or hydrogen bonds between adjacent helices, contributing to the specificity and stability of the interaction.\n*   **Positions `b`, `c`, and `f`** are typically exposed to the solvent and are usually occupied by hydrophilic (polar) residues.\n\n### Step 2: Assign the Heptad Register to the Sequence\n\nThe task is to find the correct `a-g` frame for the given sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. We look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues (like I, L, A, W, V) at positions `a` and `d`. This means we are looking for a `(hydrophobic)-x-x-(hydrophobic)` pattern.\n\nLet's test different possible alignments (frames) for the sequence. A very consistent pattern often emerges when the correct register is found.\n\n*   Let's try an alignment starting from the `I` at position 3, assuming it's the `g` position, making `A` at position 4 the `a` position.\n\n    Sequence:          `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n    Heptad Register:   `c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c`\n\n*   This alignment doesn't seem to yield a consistent hydrophobic pattern for `a` and `d`.\n\n*   Let's try a different alignment, assuming `A` at position 4 is the `a` position and `L` at position 7 is the `d` position. This fits the `a-b-c-d` pattern.\n\n    Sequence:          `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n    Heptad Register:   `e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d`\n\n*   Now let's identify the amino acids at the core `a` and `d` positions using this register:\n    *   **Position `a`:** The 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd residues of this repeat.\n        *   A, A, A, A  (All Alanine)\n    *   **Position `d`:** The 4th, 11th, 18th, and 25th residues of this repeat.\n        *   L, L, L, L  (All Leucine)\n\nThis alignment provides an extremely regular and canonical hydrophobic core pattern, with all `a` positions being Alanine (Ala) and all `d` positions being Leucine (Leu). The outlier `W` (Tryptophan) falls at a `b` position, which is solvent-exposed. This perfect regularity strongly suggests this is the correct heptad register.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Core Packing based on Knobs-into-Holes\n\nThe oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is determined by how efficiently the `a` and `d` side chains (\"knobs\") can pack into the spaces (\"holes\") created by the residues on the adjacent helix. The size of the amino acid side chains is crucial.\n\n*   **Alanine (Ala)** has a very small side chain (-CH₃).\n*   **Leucine (Leu)** has a larger, unbranched side chain (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂).\n\nLet's consider the possibilities for an `a=Ala`, `d=Leu` core:\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** While possible, having a small residue like Ala at the `a` position is not optimal. It would create a void in the core, leading to less favorable van der Waals packing compared to larger residues like Ile or Val, which are more common in dimeric coiled-coils.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** A trimeric core is more tightly packed than a dimeric one. Substituting a small residue like Ala for a larger one like Valine or Isoleucine (which are common in trimers) would create significant empty space (packing defects) in the hydrophobic core, which is highly destabilizing. Therefore, a trimer is very unlikely.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** A four-helix bundle has a larger hydrophobic core to fill compared to a dimer or trimer. The `a=Ala`, `d=Leu` pattern is a classic motif for forming a parallel tetramer. In this arrangement:\n    *   The large **Leucine** side chains from the four helices interdigitate in the center of the bundle, forming a stable central hydrophobic \"zipper\" at the `d` positions.\n    *   The very small **Alanine** side chains at the `a` positions pack neatly against the central Leucine core at the periphery of the interface. If a larger residue were at the `a` position, it would cause steric clashes. The combination of a large `d` residue and a small `a` residue is a perfect fit for the geometry of a tetrameric coiled-coil.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe sequence has a perfectly regular heptad repeat with Alanine at all `a` positions and Leucine at all `d` positions. Based on the principles of knobs-into-holes packing and steric complementarity, this `a=Ala`/`d=Leu` core composition is known to strongly favor the formation of a **tetramer (a four-helix bundle)** over other oligomeric states.\n\nTherefore, the predicted oligomeric state is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
