    "This problem asks for the largest possible number of a composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua, `X` and `Y`.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terminology:**\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact connected metric space.\n    *   A **nondegenerate continuum** is a continuum containing more than one point.\n    *   For a point `p` in a continuum `K`, the **composant** of `p` is the set of all points `x` in `K` such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of `K` containing both `p` and `x`. A proper subcontinuum of `K` is a subcontinuum that is not equal to `K`.\n    *   The set of all a composants of a continuum forms a partition of that continuum.\n\n2.  **Number of Composants of a Continuum:**\n    A fundamental result in continuum theory classifies continua based on their number of a composants, which is directly related to their decomposability.\n    *   A continuum is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. If a continuum is decomposable, it has exactly **one** composant (which is the space itself).\n    *   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable. According to a theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz, any indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants. The precise number is **`c`**, the cardinality of the continuum (`c = 2^ℵ₀`).\n\n    Therefore, the number of a composants for any continuum can only be 1 or `c`.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Product Space `Z = X × Y`:**\n    We are given that `X` and `Y` are two nondegenerate continua. Their product `Z = X × Y`, with the product topology, is also a continuum. Our goal is to find the maximum possible number of a composants for `Z`. From the previous point, the maximum value we can hope for is `c`. This would require `Z` to be an indecomposable continuum.\n\n4.  **Conditions for `X × Y` to be Indecomposable:**\n    We need to determine if it's possible for the product `Z = X × Y` to be indecomposable. A key theorem in continuum theory states that the product of two continua `X` and `Y` is indecomposable if and only if both `X` and `Y` are themselves indecomposable.\n\n5.  **Achieving the Maximum Number of Composants:**\n    To get the largest possible number of a composants for `Z`, we need to make `Z` indecomposable. According to the theorem in the previous step, this can be achieved if we choose both `X` and `Y` to be indecomposable continua.\n    *   **Existence of suitable continua:** Nondegenerate indecomposable continua do exist. The pseudo-arc is a classic example. Other examples include solenoids and Knaster continua (like the bucket-handle).\n    *   **Constructing the case:** Let's choose `X` to be a pseudo-arc and `Y` to be a pseudo-arc. Both are nondegenerate indecomposable continua.\n    *   **Result:** With this choice, the product space `Z = X × Y` is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   If we choose `X` and `Y` to be decomposable continua (e.g., `X = Y = [0,1]`), their product `Z` is also decomposable and has **1** composant.\n    *   If we choose `X` and `Y` to be indecomposable continua (e.g., two pseudo-arcs), their product `Z` is indecomposable and has **`c`** a composants.\n    *   Since the number of a composants can only be 1 or `c`, the largest possible number is `c`.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n*   The number of a composants of *any* continuum is not arbitrary; it must be either 1 or `c`.\n*   The decomposability of a product space `X × Y` is determined by the decomposability of its factors `X` and `Y`.\n*   The problem allows us to choose the continua `X` and `Y`, so we can select them to fulfill the conditions for the maximum case.\n*   We must ensure that the continua chosen for the maximal case (`X` and `Y` being indecomposable) are also nondegenerate, which is true for standard examples like the pseudo-arc.\n\nThe largest possible number of a composants is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
