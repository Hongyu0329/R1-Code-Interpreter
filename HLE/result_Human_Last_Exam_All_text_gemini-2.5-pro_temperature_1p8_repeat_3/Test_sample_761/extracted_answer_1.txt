No, polynucleotides are not, structurally, polysaccharides. They belong to two different classes of macromolecules with fundamental differences in their monomer units, the chemical bonds that link them, and their overall backbone structure. A polysaccharide is a polymer of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds, whereas a polynucleotide is a polymer of nucleotides (composed of a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester bonds.
