    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Question**\n\n*   **System:** A particle in a one-dimensional (1D) box.\n*   **Box dimensions:** The box extends from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   **Quantum state:** The particle is in the first excited state, which corresponds to the quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   **Objective:** Find the probability `P` of locating the particle in the small interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n\n**2. Recall the Fundamental Principles**\n\nThe probability of finding a particle in a specific region is given by the integral of the probability density, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that region.\nThe general formula is:\n`P(x₁ ≤ x ≤ x₂) = ∫[x₁ to x₂] |ψₙ(x)|² dx`\n\n**3. State the Wavefunction and Probability Density**\n\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is:\n`ψₙ(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n\nFor the state `n = 2`, the wavefunction is:\n`ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`\n\nThe corresponding probability density is:\n`|ψ₂(x)|² = (√(2/a) * sin(2πx / a))² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n\n**4. Set Up the Specific Integral**\n\nWe need to calculate the probability `P` for the interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]`:\n`P = ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n**5. Analyze the Problem and Choose a Solution Method**\n\nThe interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]` is very narrow (its width is `Δx = 0.01a`) and is centered at `x = 0.5a`.\nLet's evaluate the probability density at the center of the interval, `x = 0.5a`:\n`|ψ₂(0.5a)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2π(0.5a) / a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = (2/a) * (0)² = 0`\n\nSince the probability density is zero at the center of the interval, a simple approximation `P ≈ |ψ₂(center)|² * Δx` would give `P ≈ 0`, which is not accurate. The probability is very small, but not exactly zero. We must perform a more careful calculation. We can do this by approximating the integrand since the interval is small.\n\n**6. Approximate and Solve the Integral**\n\nSince the interval is centered around the node at `x=a/2`, it is convenient to change variables. Let `y = x - a/2`, so `x = y + a/2`.\nThe integration limits for `y` become:\n*   Lower limit: `0.495a - a/2 = -0.005a`\n*   Upper limit: `0.505a - a/2 = +0.005a`\n\nThe integrand becomes:\n`(2/a) * sin²(2π(y + a/2) / a) = (2/a) * sin²(2πy/a + π)`\nUsing the identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, we have `sin²(θ + π) = (-sin(θ))² = sin²(θ)`.\nSo, the term is `(2/a) * sin²(2πy/a)`.\n\nThe integral is now:\n`P = ∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(2πy/a) dy`\n\nThe argument of the sine function, `z = 2πy/a`, is very small within the integration range. We can use the small-angle approximation `sin(z) ≈ z`.\nTherefore, `sin²(2πy/a) ≈ (2πy/a)² = 4π²y²/a²`.\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the integral:\n`P ≈ ∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * (4π²y²/a²) dy`\n`P ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] y² dy`\n\nNow, we evaluate the simple integral of `y²`:\n`∫ y² dy = y³/3`\n`∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] y² dy = [y³/3]` from `-0.005a` to `0.005a`\n`= ((0.005a)³ / 3) - ((-0.005a)³ / 3)`\n`= 2 * (0.005a)³ / 3`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for `P`:\n`P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [2 * (0.005)³ * a³ / 3]`\n`P ≈ (16π² / 3) * (0.005)³`\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n`P ≈ (16 * π² / 3) * (5 x 10⁻³)³`\n`P ≈ (16 * π² / 3) * (125 x 10⁻⁹)`\n`P ≈ (16 * (9.8696) / 3) * (125 x 10⁻⁹)`\n`P ≈ (52.638) * (125 x 10⁻⁹)`\n`P ≈ 6579.75 x 10⁻⁹`\n`P ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Correct Wavefunction:** Always start with the correct normalized wavefunction for the given quantum number (`n=2`).\n2.  **Node Location:** Recognize that for `n=2`, a node (zero probability density) exists at the center of the box (`x=a/2`). This is crucial because the interval of interest is centered on this node.\n3.  **Invalid Simple Approximation:** A simple point-approximation (`P ≈ ρ(x_c)Δx`) is invalid when the function is zero or changes rapidly at the point of approximation. A full integration or a Taylor series approximation of the integrand is necessary.\n4.  **Approximation Accuracy:** Using `sin(z) ≈ z` is valid here because the integration interval is very small and centered where the sine function itself is zero.\n5.  **Unit Consistency:** Ensure all terms involving the box length `a` cancel out, as probability is a dimensionless quantity. This was achieved in Step 6.\n6.  **Calculator Mode:** Any numerical calculations involving trigonometric functions of `π` must be done in radians.\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n = 2 is approximately `6.58 x 10⁻⁶`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
