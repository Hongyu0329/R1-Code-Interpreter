### **Final Answer**

**1. Management Procedures:**
The patient's appropriate management requires a multi-phased approach, prioritizing systemic health.

*   **Phase 1: Emergency Care:**
    *   **Medical:** Immediate referral to a physician for initiation of diabetes treatment to control her high HbA1c of 7.5%.
    *   **Dental:** Thorough examination and radiographs (panoramic and periapical). The 28-hour delay makes reimplantation of the lost teeth impossible. Treatment involves wound cleaning, debridement, suturing of lacerations, and prescription of antibiotics, analgesics, and an antiseptic mouthwash. A tetanus booster should be given.

*   **Phase 2: Pre-Prosthetic Care:**
    *   Once her diabetic condition is stable, a comprehensive dental plan is made. This includes treating any existing periodontal disease and caries to ensure a healthy foundation for a prosthesis.

*   **Phase 3: Definitive Treatment:**
    *   A **Removable Partial Denture (RPD)** is the most appropriate treatment option due to the uncontrolled diabetes (making surgery risky), the long span of missing teeth, and the loss of the critical canine tooth. This choice avoids invasive preparation of adjacent teeth. Th
