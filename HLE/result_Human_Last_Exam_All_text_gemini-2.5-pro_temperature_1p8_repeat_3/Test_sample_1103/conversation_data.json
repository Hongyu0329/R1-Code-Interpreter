    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question about the Gauss class number problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks for a specific numerical result related to a famous problem in algebraic number theory.\n*   **Topic:** The Gauss class number problem.\n*   **Object of Interest:** Negative fundamental discriminants.\n*   **Property:** The class number associated with the discriminant must be exactly 48.\n*   **Goal:** Find the total *count* of such discriminants.\n\n**2. Define Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Quadratic Field:** A number field of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is a square-free integer. If $n < 0$, it is an imaginary quadratic field. If $n > 0$, it is a real quadratic field. The question concerns imaginary quadratic fields.\n*   **Fundamental Discriminant:** A fundamental discriminant $d$ is the discriminant of a quadratic field. For an imaginary quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{n})$ (with $n<0$ square-free), the discriminant $d$ is:\n    *   $d = n$ if $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n    *   $d = 4n$ if $n \\equiv 2 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod{4}$\n    The question asks specifically for **negative** fundamental discriminants, which correspond to imaginary quadratic fields.\n*   **Class Number:** For a fundamental discriminant $d$, the class number $h(d)$ is the order (size) of the ideal class group of the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$. The ideal class group measures the extent to which the ring of integers of the field fails to have unique factorization. A class number of 1 means the ring is a unique factorization domain.\n\n**3. Understand the \"Gauss Class Number Problem\"**\n\nOriginally, this problem, posed by Gauss, was to find all imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number $h$.\n*   A key result by Siegel (1935) showed that for any given class number $h$, there are only a **finite number** of negative fundamental discriminants $d$ with $h(d)=h$. However, Siegel's proof was \"ineffective,\" meaning it didn't provide a way to calculate a bound on the size of the discriminants one would need to check.\n*   The problem became solvable in practice thanks to the Goldfeld-Gross-Zagier theorem (work from the 1970s and 1980s). This theorem provided an *effective* lower bound for the class number, making it possible to find an explicit upper bound on the absolute value of the discriminants for a given class number $h$.\n*   With this theoretical breakthrough, determining the complete list for a specific class number became a finite, albeit massive, computational task.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Fundamental Discriminants Only:** The question specifically asks for *fundamental* discriminants. There are other integers (non-fundamental discriminants) that have a class number, but these are related to orders within the quadratic field, not the maximal order (the ring of integers). The standard Gauss class number problem deals with fundamental discriminants.\n2.  **Negative Discriminants Only:** The question is about *negative* discriminants ($d < 0$), corresponding to imaginary quadratic fields. The class number problem for *positive* discriminants (real quadratic fields) is a completely different and much harder problem. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many real quadratic fields with class number 1, for example.\n3.  **This is a Solved Problem:** For small class numbers (including 48), this is not an open mathematical question. The answer is known and published in peer-reviewed journals.\n4.  **Not a Simple Calculation:** The answer cannot be derived from a simple formula. It is the result of extensive computer searches based on the deep theoretical results mentioned above. You cannot calculate this by hand.\n5.  **Citing the Source:** The correct way to answer this question is to cite the definitive computational results. The most comprehensive work on this is by Mark Watkins, published in his 2004 paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\" in the journal *Mathematics of Computation*.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step\n\n**Step 1:** Reconfirm the precise question. We need to find the size of the set $S = \\{ d \\in \\mathbb{Z}^- \\mid d \\text{ is a fundamental discriminant and } h(d) = 48 \\}$.\n\n**Step 2:** Acknowledge that the solution requires looking up the result from the established literature. The work of M. Watkins provides a complete classification for all class numbers up to 100.\n\n**Step 3:** Consult Watkins' results. Table 4 in his paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\" lists, for each class number $h$ from 1 to 100, the number of negative fundamental discriminants $N(h)$ with that class number.\n\n**Step 4:** Locate the entry for $h=48$ in Watkins' table (or a reliable database like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, which cites this work).\n\n**Step 5:** The entry corresponding to the class number $h=48$ gives the number of such fundamental discriminants. This number is 562.\n\nThis means there are exactly 562 imaginary quadratic fields whose ideal class group has order 48.\n\n<<<562>>>"
