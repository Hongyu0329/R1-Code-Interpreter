    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Locate the Correct Section of the Score:** The question concerns the very end of the symphony. This means we need to look at the first violin (Violino I) part in the final measures of the fourth movement, the \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Last Three Notes:** To find the last three notes played, we must examine the last couple of measures for the first violin part.\n    *   The final measure of the symphony for the first violin consists of a single whole note (semibreve).\n    *   The second-to-last measure consists of two half notes (minims).\n    *   Together, these two measures contain the last three notes played by the first violin section.\n\n3.  **Determine the Pitch of Each Note:** Now we read the specific notes from the musical staff (in the treble clef).\n    *   In the second-to-last measure, the first half note is a **B**. Using scientific pitch notation, this is B5.\n    *   In the second-to-last measure, the second half note is an **F#** (F-sharp). This is F#6, which is in the octave above the previous note.\n    *   In the final measure, the single whole note is a **D#** (D-sharp). This is D#5.\n    *   So, the last three notes played in sequence are B5, F#6, and D#5.\n\n4.  **Compare the Pitches to Find the Lowest:** The final step is to compare these three pitches:\n    *   Note 1: B5\n    *   Note 2: F#6\n    *   Note 3: D#5\n    *   F#6 is clearly the highest note as it is in the 6th octave.\n    *   We then compare B5 and D#5. In any given octave, the note D# is lower than the note B.\n    *   Therefore, D#5 is the lowest of the three notes.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to look at the first violin (Violino I) part, not any other instrument.\n*   The question asks for the last \"three notes,\" which requires examining the notes leading up to and including the final sustained note.\n*   Identifying the correct octave is important for comparison. F#6 is much higher than B5 and D#5.\n*   The final chord of the symphony is B Major (B - D# - F#). The first violin plays the D#, which is the third of the chord, confirming the harmonic context.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe last three notes played by the first violin are B5, F#6, and D#5. Comparing these, the lowest pitch is D#.\n\n<<<D#>>>"
