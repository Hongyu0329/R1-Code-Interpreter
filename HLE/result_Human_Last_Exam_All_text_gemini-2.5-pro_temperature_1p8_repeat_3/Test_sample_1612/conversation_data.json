    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question \"How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\".\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"Triple Crown\" in MLB**\n\nFirst, it is crucial to understand what the \"Triple Crown\" refers to in baseball. The term most commonly refers to the **Batting Triple Crown**. A player achieves this by leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three key statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (BA)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\nThere is also a Pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in Wins, ERA, and Strikeouts), but the unqualified term \"Triple Crown\" almost always means the batting achievement. Therefore, the analysis will focus on the Batting Triple Crown winners.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and List all Triple Crown Winners**\n\nThe next step is to research and list every player who has won the Batting Triple Crown in either the American League (AL) or the National League (NL) throughout MLB history.\n\n**American League (AL) Winners:**\n*   **1901:** Nap Lajoie, Philadelphia Athletics\n*   **1909:** Ty Cobb, Detroit Tigers\n*   **1933:** Jimmie Foxx, Philadelphia Athletics\n*   **1934:** Lou Gehrig, New York Yankees\n*   **1942:** Ted Williams, Boston Red Sox\n*   **1947:** Ted Williams, Boston Red Sox\n*   **1956:** Mickey Mantle, New York Yankees\n*   **1966:** Frank Robinson, Baltimore Orioles\n*   **1967:** Carl Yastrzemski, Boston Red Sox\n*   **2012:** Miguel Cabrera, Detroit Tigers\n\n**National League (NL) Winners:**\n*   **1878:** Paul Hines, Providence Grays\n*   **1887:** Tip O'Neill, St. Louis Browns (American Association)\n*   **1894:** Hugh Duffy, Boston Beaneaters\n*   **1912:** Heinie Zimmerman, Chicago Cubs\n*   **1922:** Rogers Hornsby, St. Louis Cardinals\n*   **1925:** Rogers Hornsby, St. Louis Cardinals\n*   **1933:** Chuck Klein, Philadelphia Phillies\n*   **1937:** Joe Medwick, St. Louis Cardinals\n\n**Step 3: Count the Number of Unique Winners**\n\nThe question asks \"How many triple crowns winners are there,\" which implies counting the number of individual players who have accomplished this feat, not the total number of times it has been won.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Multiple Winners.** Notice that Ted Williams and Rogers Hornsby each won the Triple Crown twice. When counting the number of *winners*, they should each only be counted once.\n\nLet's list the unique players from the combined list:\n1.  Nap Lajoie\n2.  Ty Cobb\n3.  Jimmie Foxx\n4.  Lou Gehrig\n5.  Ted Williams (won twice)\n6.  Mickey Mantle\n7.  Frank Robinson\n8.  Carl Yastrzemski\n9.  Miguel Cabrera\n10. Paul Hines\n11. Tip O'Neill\n12. Hugh Duffy\n13. Heinie Zimmerman\n14. Rogers Hornsby (won twice)\n15. Chuck Klein\n16. Joe Medwick\n\nCounting these unique individuals gives us a total of **16** different players.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Historical Leagues.** The win by Tip O'Neill in 1887 occurred in the American Association, which was a recognized major league at the time and its records are included in MLB history.\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification and Answer Formulation**\n\nLet's verify the count.\n*   Unique winners in the American League: 9 (Nap Lajoie, Ty Cobb, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski, Miguel Cabrera)\n*   Unique winners in the National League: 7 (Paul Hines, Tip O'Neill, Hugh Duffy, Heinie Zimmerman, Rogers Hornsby, Chuck Klein, Joe Medwick)\n\nTotal unique winners = 9 (AL) + 7 (NL) = **16**.\n\nThe total number of Triple Crown *seasons* is 18, but the total number of unique *players* to win it is 16. Based on the wording of the question, the number of players is the correct answer.\n\n<<<16>>>"
