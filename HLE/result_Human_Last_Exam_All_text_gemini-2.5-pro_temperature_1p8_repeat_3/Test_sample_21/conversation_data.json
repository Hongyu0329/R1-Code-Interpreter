    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the polynomial**\n\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\nThis polynomial has a special structure. Let's compare it with a family of polynomials called the Dickson polynomials (of the second kind, or a scaled version of the first kind). Let's define a sequence of polynomials $H_n(x, k)$ by the recurrence relation:\n$H_0(x, k) = 2$\n$H_1(x, k) = x$\n$H_{n+1}(x, k) = x H_n(x, k) - k H_{n-1}(x, k)$\n\nThese polynomials are characterized by the property that if $x = y + k/y$, then $H_n(x, k) = y^n + (k/y)^n$.\nLet's compute $H_7(x, k)$:\n$H_2(x, k) = x^2 - 2k$\n$H_3(x, k) = x^3 - 3kx$\n$H_4(x, k) = x^4 - 4kx^2 + 2k^2$\n$H_5(x, k) = x^5 - 5kx^3 + 5k^2x$\n$H_6(x, k) = x^6 - 6kx^4 + 9k^2x^2 - 2k^3$\n$H_7(x, k) = x(H_6) - k(H_5) = x^7 - 6kx^5 + 9k^2x^3 - 2k^3x - k(x^5 - 5kx^3 + 5k^2x)$\n$H_7(x, k) = x^7 - 7kx^5 + 14k^2x^3 - 7k^3x$\n\nNow, let's compare the polynomial part of $f(x)$, which is $g(x) = f(x) - 22 = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$, with $H_7(x, k)$.\nWe match the coefficients:\n- Coefficient of $x^5$: $-7k = -14 \\implies k=2$.\n- Coefficient of $x^3$: $14k^2 = 14(2^2) = 14 \\cdot 4 = 56$. This matches.\n- Coefficient of $x$: $-7k^3 = -7(2^3) = -7 \\cdot 8 = -56$. This also matches.\n\nSo, we have established that $f(x) = H_7(x, 2) + 22$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of f(x)**\n\nThe Galois group of polynomials of the form $H_n(x, k) + c$ is generically the dihedral group $D_n$.\nThe roots of $f(x) = 0$ are given by solving $y^7 + (2/y)^7 + 22 = 0$. Let $z = y^7$. The equation becomes $z + 128/z + 22 = 0$, which is $z^2 + 22z + 128 = 0$.\nThe roots of this quadratic equation are $z = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{22^2 - 4(1)(128)}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{484 - 512}}{2} = -11 \\pm \\sqrt{-7} = -11 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}$.\nLet $A = -11 + i\\sqrt{7}$. Let $u$ be a 7th root of $A$, i.e., $u^7 = A$. Let $v$ be a 7th root of $\\bar{A}=-11-i\\sqrt{7}$ such that $uv=2$. Such a $v$ exists because $u^7v^7=A\\bar{A}=|A|^2 = (-11)^2+(\\sqrt{7})^2=121+7=128=2^7$.\nThe 7 roots of $f(x)$ are given by $x_j = u\\zeta_7^j + v\\zeta_7^{-j}$ for $j = 0, 1, \\ldots, 6$, where $\\zeta_7 = e^{2\\pi i/7}$ is a primitive 7th root of unity.\n\nThe Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ acts by permuting these 7 roots. We can identify two key automorphisms:\n1.  An automorphism $\\sigma$ which corresponds to changing the choice of the 7th root of unity, mapping $\\zeta_7 \\to \\zeta_7^k$ for some primitive root $k \\pmod 7$ and fixing $u, v$ can lead to complicated actions. A simpler one to consider is from the structure of the splitting field. The splitting field contains $\\mathbb{Q}(u,\\zeta_7)$, which has an automorphism $\\sigma$ defined by $\\sigma(u)=u\\zeta_7$ and $\\sigma(\\zeta_7)=\\zeta_7$. This leads to $\\sigma(v)=v\\zeta_7^{-1}$. The action on the roots is $\\sigma(x_j) = u\\zeta_7^{j+1} + v\\zeta_7^{-(j+1)} = x_{j+1 \\pmod 7}$. This is a 7-cycle on the roots, which we can denote as $r=(0\\ 1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 4\\ 5\\ 6)$.\n2.  An automorphism $\\tau$ corresponding to complex conjugation. This maps $\\zeta_7 \\to \\zeta_7^{-1}$ and $i \\to -i$. This sends $A = -11+i\\sqrt{7}$ to $\\bar{A}$. We can define $\\tau(u)=v$ and $\\tau(v)=u$. Its action on the roots is $\\tau(x_j) = \\tau(u\\zeta_7^j + v\\zeta_7^{-j}) = v\\zeta_7^{-j} + u\\zeta_7^j = x_{-j \\pmod 7}$. This permutation fixes $x_0$ and swaps $x_j$ with $x_{7-j}$, i.e., $s=(1\\ 6)(2\\ 5)(3\\ 4)$.\n\nThe two permutations $r$ and $s$ satisfy the relations $r^7=s^2=1$ and $srs=r^{-1}$. These are the defining relations for the dihedral group $D_7$. The presence of a 7-cycle implies the polynomial is irreducible. Because both $r$ and $s$ are in the Galois group, the group they generate, $D_7$, is the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The order of $D_7$ is $2 \\times 7 = 14$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem**\n\nThe question asks for the natural density of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$.\nAccording to the properties of Frobenius elements, a polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $n$ is irreducible modulo a prime $p$ if and only if the Frobenius element $Frob_p$ corresponding to $p$ in the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ acts as an $n$-cycle on the roots of $f(x)$.\nIn our case, $n=7$, and the Galois group is $G=D_7$. So we are looking for the density of primes $p$ for which $Frob_p$ is a 7-cycle.\nThe Chebotarev Density Theorem states that for any conjugacy class $C$ in $G$, the density of primes $p$ (unramified in the splitting field) for which $Frob_p \\in C$ is $|C|/|G|$.\nThe set of all 7-cycles forms a union of conjugacy classes. The density of primes for which $Frob_p$ is a 7-cycle is the total number of 7-cycles in $G$ divided by the order of $G$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the 7-cycles in D_7**\n\nThe group $D_7$ consists of 14 elements:\n- The identity element.\n- 6 rotations of the heptagon, generated by $r$. These are $r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, r^6$. All of these have order 7 and act as 7-cycles on the vertices.\n- 7 reflections of the heptagon. These are $s, sr, sr^2, sr^3, sr^4, sr^5, sr^6$. All of these have order 2. They are not 7-cycles.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in $D_7$ that are 7-cycles is 6.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the density**\n\nThe natural density of the set of primes $p$ such that $f(x)$ is irreducible mod $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in $D_7$ to the total number of elements in $D_7$.\n\nDensity = $\\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles in } D_7}{|D_7|} = \\frac{6}{14} = \\frac{3}{7}$."
