    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the candidates**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas. The noble gases are a group of chemical elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\nOganesson (Og) is also a noble gas, but it is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth and is therefore not a candidate.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the metric for rarity**\nThe question asks for the rarest gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we need to consider the total abundance of each gas across the entire Earth system (crust, mantle, oceans, and atmosphere), not just its concentration in the atmosphere. The specific year, 2002, is included, but the relative abundances of these gases do not change significantly on a year-to-year basis.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the abundance of the stable noble gases**\nLet's first look at the stable (non-radioactive or very long-lived) noble gases, primarily found in the atmosphere:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** By far the most common, making up about 0.93% of the atmosphere. Most of it is argon-40, produced from the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The next most abundant, at about 18 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere.\n*   **Helium (He):** About 5.2 ppm in the atmosphere. It is also generated in the crust from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium but is light enough to slowly escape Earth's gravity.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Much rarer, at about 1.1 ppm in the atmosphere.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** The rarest of the stable noble gases, with an atmospheric concentration of only about 0.09 ppm, or 90 parts per billion (ppb).\n\nBased on this, if we were only considering stable gases, Xenon would be the rarest.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the abundance of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is fundamentally different from the other noble gases on the list.\n*   **Radioactivity:** All isotopes of Radon are highly radioactive.\n*   **Short Half-life:** The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only about 3.8 days. Other isotopes have even shorter half-lives.\n*   **Source and Decay:** Radon is continuously generated in the Earth's crust through the radioactive decay of radium, which is part of the decay chains of uranium and thorium. However, because its half-life is so short, it decays into other elements very quickly.\n\n**Step 5: Compare Radon to Xenon**\nThis brings us to the crucial point of comparison.\n*   **Xenon (Xe)** is stable. Over geological time, it has accumulated in the atmosphere to its current, stable concentration. The total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is enormous, on the order of 10^13 kilograms.\n*   **Radon (Rn)** is unstable. It cannot accumulate. Although it is constantly being produced, it is also constantly decaying away. The total amount of Radon present on the entire planet at any single moment is incredibly small. Estimates place the total amount of Radon in the atmosphere at any given time at only a few kilograms. Even including the Radon in the ground and oceans, its total mass as a percentage of all terrestrial matter is minuscule, many orders of magnitude less than that of Xenon.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude based on the analysis**\nDue to its extremely short half-life and radioactive nature, the \"standing crop\" of Radon on Earth at any instant is exceptionally small. It is far rarer than Xenon, the rarest of the stable noble gases. The specific year of 2002 does not alter this fundamental fact of nuclear physics and geology. Therefore, Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
