    "An n-step self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice is a path of n steps on a 2D square grid (where points have integer coordinates) that never visits the same point more than once. We are asked to find `a(n)`, the number of such walks of length `n` starting from a fixed origin, for `n=10`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Basics**\nA walk starts at the origin (0,0). At each step, we can move from the current point (x,y) to one of its four neighbors: (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), or (x, y-1). A self-avoiding walk of `n` steps is a sequence of `n+1` distinct points `v_0, v_1, ..., v_n` where `v_0` is the origin and `v_{i+1}` is a neighbor of `v_i` for all `i`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculating the First Few Terms**\nLet's compute the values of `a(n)` for small `n` to understand the pattern.\n*   **a(1):** For the first step, there are 4 possible directions (Up, Down, Left, Right). All are valid self-avoiding walks.\n    *   a(1) = 4.\n*   **a(2):** After the first step, we are at a new point. From here, we can again move in 4 directions. However, one of these directions would take us back to the origin, which is forbidden. Therefore, there are only 3 valid choices for the second step for each of the 4 initial walks.\n    *   a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12.\n*   **a(3):** For any 2-step self-avoiding walk, the path has visited 3 points (e.g., (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) or (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1)). From the endpoint, one of the 4 possible moves is to backtrack to the previous point, which is forbidden. The other 3 moves go to unvisited points. So, for each of the 12 walks of length 2, there are 3 valid choices for the third step.\n    *   a(3) = 12 * 3 = 36.\n\n**Step 3: The Pattern Breaks at n=4**\nIt might seem like `a(n) = 4 * 3^(n-1)`, but this is incorrect. This formula counts non-backtracking walks, where a walk is only forbidden from immediately reversing its last step. A self-avoiding walk cannot revisit *any* previously visited point. For n ≤ 3, this distinction doesn't matter, but for n ≥ 4, it does.\n\n*   **a(4):** Let's analyze the 36 walks of length 3. We need to count the valid fourth steps.\n    1.  **\"Open\" walks:** Most 3-step walks end at a point where only one neighbor (the previously visited point) is forbidden. For example, the path (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(2,1). The endpoint is (2,1), and its only neighbor on the path is (2,0). So there are 3 valid moves.\n    2.  **\"Trapped\" walks:** Some 3-step walks create a partial enclosure. Consider the path (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1). The path has visited the points {(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)}. The endpoint is (0,1). Its neighbors are (0,0), (1,1), (-1,1), and (0,2). Two of these neighbors, (0,0) and (1,1), have already been visited. Thus, there are only 2 valid moves from this endpoint, not 3.\n*   **Counting for a(4):** There are 8 such \"trapped\" walks of length 3. The other 36 - 8 = 28 walks are \"open\".\n    *   Number of new walks from \"open\" paths: 28 * 3 = 84.\n    *   Number of new walks from \"trapped\" paths: 8 * 2 = 16.\n    *   Total for a(4) = 84 + 16 = 100.\n\n**Step 4: The Complexity of a(n) for larger n**\nAs `n` increases, the number of different path configurations and the variety of \"traps\" grow exponentially. Manually calculating `a(n)` by tracking all possible paths becomes infeasible. For example, to calculate a(5), we would need to classify all 100 paths of length 4 based on how many valid next steps each allows.\n\n**Step 5: Finding the Authoritative Value**\nThe number of self-avoiding walks is a famous and difficult problem in computational physics and combinatorics. There is no simple closed-form formula for a(n). However, the sequence has been computed to very high orders using sophisticated computer algorithms. This sequence is well-documented in resources like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n\nThe known values for the sequence are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   **a(10) = 44100**\n\nBased on these well-established results, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
