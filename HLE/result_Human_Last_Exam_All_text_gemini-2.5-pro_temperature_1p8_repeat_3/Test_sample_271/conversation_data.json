    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L / \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We can try to find common factors by grouping terms.\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the splitting fields of the factors**\nThe splitting field of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its irreducible factors.\n- For $h(x) = x^2 - 2$, the roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The degree of this extension is $[K_h : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$, and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n- For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we first check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n    - $3 \\nmid 1$ (the leading coefficient)\n    - $3 | 0$ (coefficients of $x^4, x^3, x^2$)\n    - $3 | -9$ (coefficient of $x$)\n    - $3 | 3$ (the constant term)\n    - $3^2=9 \\nmid 3$ (the constant term)\n  Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of $g(x)$**\nTo find the Galois group of the irreducible quintic $g(x)$, we can examine its roots.\nLet's analyze the number of real roots of $g(x)$. The derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$.\nThe critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, so $x^4 = 9/5$, which gives two real roots $x_c = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\nWe evaluate $g(x)$ at these critical points:\n- Let $c = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. The local minimum is $g(c) = c^5 - 9c + 3 = c(c^4-9)+3 = c(9/5-9)+3 = 3 - (36/5)c$. Since $c = (1.8)^{1/4} \\approx 1.158$, $g(c) \\approx 3 - 7.2 \\cdot 1.158 < 0$.\n- The local maximum is $g(-c) = (-c)^5 - 9(-c) + 3 = -c^5+9c+3 = c(-c^4+9)+3 = 3 + (36/5)c > 0$.\nSince the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots. An irreducible polynomial of degree 5 over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly three real roots has the symmetric group $S_5$ as its Galois group.\nLet $K_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$. Then $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, and $[K_g : \\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Galois group of the full polynomial**\nThe splitting field of $f(x)$ is $K = K_g K_h = K_g(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}][K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_g \\cap K_h : \\mathbb{Q}]}$.\nThe intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ can be either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a subfield of $K_g$.\n$K_g$ contains a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$, where $\\Delta_g$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\nSo, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subseteq K_g$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$. This holds if and only if $\\Delta_g$ is of the form $2k^2$ for some rational number $k$.\nThe discriminant of $x^5-9x+3$ is $\\Delta_g = 2322405 = 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 17203$. This is not of the form $2k^2$.\nTherefore, $K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K_g:\\mathbb{Q}][K_h:\\mathbb{Q}] = 120 \\cdot 2 = 240$, and the Galois group is the direct product $G \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the possible degrees of normal sub-extensions**\nWe are looking for normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions $L$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{1\\}, C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ can be of two types: products of normal subgroups or \"skew\" subgroups.\n\n1.  **Product subgroups**: $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\unlhd S_5$ and $N_2 \\unlhd C_2$.\n    The proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of this form are:\n    *   $H_1 = S_5 \\times \\{1\\}$, $|H_1|=120$. Index $[G:H_1] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_2 = A_5 \\times \\{1\\}$, $|H_2|=60$. Index $[G:H_2] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$, $|H_3|=2$. Index $[G:H_3] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_4 = A_5 \\times C_2$, $|H_4|=120$. Index $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **Skew subgroups**: These arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of the factors. The non-trivial quotients of $S_5$ are $S_5/\\{e\\} \\cong S_5$ and $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. The non-trivial quotient of $C_2$ is $C_2/\\{1\\} \\cong C_2$.\n    An isomorphism can exist between $S_5/A_5$ and $C_2/\\{1\\}$. Let $\\phi: S_5/A_5 \\to C_2/\\{1\\}$ be this isomorphism. This defines a normal subgroup $H_5 = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\phi(gA_5) = c\\{1\\}\\}$.\n    Let's identify $C_2$ with $\\{1, -1\\}$ multiplicatively. The homomorphism $\\text{sgn}: S_5 \\to C_2$ has kernel $A_5$. Thus $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. So the subgroup is $H_5 = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(g) = c\\}$.\n    This subgroup is the graph of the sgn homomorphism, and it is normal. Its order is $|S_5| = 120$.\n    *   $H_5 = \\{(g, \\text{sgn}(g)) \\mid g \\in S_5 \\}$. Index $[G:H_5] = 240/120=2$.\n\n**Step 6: List all the possible degrees**\nThe degrees of the corresponding normal intermediate fields $L$ are the indices of these subgroups.\n- From $H_1$, degree is 2. (This field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$)\n- From $H_2$, degree is 4. (This field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g}, \\sqrt{2})$)\n- From $H_3$, degree is 120. (This field is $K_g$)\n- From $H_4$, degree is 2. (This field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$)\n- From $H_5$, degree is 2. (This field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2\\Delta_g})$)\n\nThe set of possible values for the degrees $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is the set of these indices.\nThe possible degrees are $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
