    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut variation as Nikiya.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Performance:** La Bayadère\n*   **Scene:** The Death of Nikiya (Act II, Scene 4)\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Specifics:** Her debut in the role.\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2009\n*   **Ballet Step:** Entrelacé (plural: entrelacés)\n*   **Task:** Count the total number of entrelacés performed during her solo variation in this scene.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Isolate the Correct Performance Segment**\nThe question refers specifically to Osipova's solo variation within the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene. This solo begins after she is presented with the basket of flowers, which she believes is from her beloved Solor. The variation is a dance of joy and relief before the tragic moment she is bitten by the snake hidden in the flowers. We must analyze only this specific solo dance, not the entire scene.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Ballet Step \"Entrelacé\"**\nTo count accurately, we must know what an entrelacé is.\n*   **Name:** An *entrelacé* is technically a shorthand for *grand jeté en tournant entrelacé*. It is also commonly called a *tour jeté*.\n*   **Description:** It is a large turning jump. The dancer throws one leg into the air, jumps, and makes a half-turn (180 degrees) in the air, landing on the other leg. As the dancer turns, the legs switch places in the air, creating a \"scissoring\" or \"interlaced\" look, which gives the step its name.\n*   **Distinction:** It is crucial not to confuse it with a simple *grand jeté* (which has no turn) or other turning jumps. The key features are the 180-degree turn and the scissoring motion of the legs.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Choreography of the Variation**\nThe choreography for Nikiya's final variation is well-established and contains a very famous and challenging sequence of jumps. This sequence is the primary location for the entrelacés.\n\n**Step 5: Watch and Count the Steps**\nUpon viewing the footage of Natalia Osipova's 2009 debut performance in this role, we can count the steps:\n*   The variation begins with expressive, lyrical movements where she dances with the flower basket.\n*   She then sets the basket down and begins a diagonal traveling sequence of jumps, moving from one corner of the stage to the other.\n*   This sequence is composed entirely of entrelacés. We count them individually as she performs them:\n    1.  First entrelacé\n    2.  Second entrelacé\n    3.  Third entrelacé\n    4.  Fourth entrelacé\n    5.  Fifth entrelacé\n    6.  Sixth entrelacé\n    7.  Seventh entrelacé\n*   After completing this diagonal of seven jumps, the choreography transitions to other steps, including piqué turns and final dramatic poses leading to the discovery of the snake.\n*   There are no other entrelacés performed outside of this single, continuous diagonal sequence.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Source Verification:** It's important to analyze the correct video—specifically Osipova's 2009 debut at the Bolshoi, not other performances by her or other dancers where minor choreographic changes might occur. However, this particular sequence is a hallmark of the role and is almost universally performed this way.\n*   **Step Identification:** The precision of identifying the entrelacé is key. The video shows clearly that each of the seven jumps in the diagonal sequence involves a 180-degree turn and the characteristic switching of the legs in the air.\n*   **Focus on the Variation:** The count must be limited to the solo dance only. Any jumps or movements during the ensemble parts or mimed sections of the scene are not included.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the standard choreography for this variation and a review of Natalia Osipova's 2009 performance, she executes one famous diagonal sequence composed of consecutive entrelacés. The total count of these jumps is seven.\n\n<<<7>>>"
