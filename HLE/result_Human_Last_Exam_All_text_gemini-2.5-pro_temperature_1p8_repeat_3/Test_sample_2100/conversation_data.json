    "### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the clues from the question:**\n    *   **Clue 1: The poet and the quote.** The man was called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. Voznesensky also wrote a poem questioning the location of this man's grave: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This tells us three things: the subject is a man, he was a sailor/explorer, and his grave was lost or unknown at the time Voznesensky wrote the poem. The poet's involvement points towards a figure significant to Russian history or culture.\n    *   **Clue 2: The discovery timeline.** The question about the grave's location (\"Where is your grave?\") was answered in the late 1980s. This means the man's grave or remains were found during this specific historical period.\n    *   **Clue 3: The question.** The final answer required is the man's last name.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the clues and form a hypothesis:**\n    *   We are looking for a famous sailor or explorer connected to Russia whose burial site was unknown for a very long time but was discovered in the late 1980s (or very early 1990s, as archaeological discoveries often span years from planning to announcement).\n\n3.  **Evaluate potential candidates:**\n    *   A prominent figure in Russian exploration history is **Vitus Bering**, a Danish navigator who served in the Russian Navy. He led two major expeditions to the far eastern coast of Siberia and the coast of North America.\n    *   Let's check Bering against the clues:\n        *   **\"Sailor\" and \"Grave was unknown\":** Bering died during his second expedition in 1741 on an uninhabited island, which was later named Bering Island in his honor. He was buried there by the surviving crew members. For over 200 years, the exact location of his grave was lost and became a subject of historical mystery. This perfectly matches the line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n        *   **Voznesensky connection:** The quotes provided are direct translations from Andrei Voznesensky's 1984 poem titled \"Saga\" (\"Сага\"), which is explicitly about Vitus Bering. The description \"joy-discovering sailor\" is Voznesensky's poetic interpretation of Bering's role as an explorer.\n        *   **Grave found in the late 1980s:** In August 1991, a Danish-Russian archaeological expedition finally located the graves of Bering and five of his crewmen on Bering Island. This event directly corresponds to the clue that the answer to Voznesensky's question \"emerged in the late 1980s\" (the work and planning for the expedition began in this period, culminating in the 1991 discovery). The remains were identified, studied, and then reburied with honors.\n\n4.  **Final conclusion:**\n    *   All the clues point directly to Vitus Bering. He was the \"joy-discovering sailor\" from Voznesensky's poem, his grave was lost for centuries, and it was rediscovered by an expedition at the end of the 1980s/beginning of the 1990s. The question asks for his last name.\n\n### Careful points to consider:\n\n*   **The Poet:** Identifying Andrei Voznesensky is key, as his work provides the specific text and context. He famously wrote about historical figures, most notably Nikolai Rezanov in \"Juno and Avos,\" but the quotes here are from a different work.\n*   **The Quote:** The description \"joy-discovering sailor\" is poetic, not literal. It refers to the spirit of exploration and discovery.\n*   **The Timeline:** The \"late 1980s\" is a crucial piece of data. While the discovery was announced in 1991, this timeframe is close enough and the project's origins fall within this period, making it a valid clue.\n*   **The Question:** The request is specific: the last name.\n\nBy methodically linking the poetic description, the mystery of the lost grave, and the specific timeline of its discovery, we can confidently identify the man as Vitus Bering.\n\n<<<Bering>>>"
