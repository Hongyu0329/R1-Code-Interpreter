    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of involutions in the group PSU(4, 997).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Group G:** The group in question is `PSU(4, 997)`. This is the Projected Special Unitary group.\n    *   **U(n, q):** The unitary group of dimension `n` over the field with `q^2` elements, `F_{q^2}`. These are `n x n` matrices `A` with entries in `F_{q^2}` that preserve a non-degenerate Hermitian form. A standard condition is `A^*A = I`, where `A^*` is the conjugate transpose (conjugation being the Frobenius automorphism `x -> x^q`).\n    *   **SU(n, q):** The special unitary group, a subgroup of `U(n, q)` containing matrices with determinant 1.\n    *   **PSU(n, q):** The projected special unitary group, which is the quotient group `SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where `Z` is the center of `SU(n, q)`.\n    *   In our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. The prime `q=997` is odd and not 2 or 3.\n\n*   **Involution:** An involution in a group `G` is an element `x` of order 2. This means `x^2 = 1` (where `1` is the identity element) and `x \\neq 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Relating Involutions in PSU(n, q) to Elements in SU(n, q)\n\nAn element `x` in `PSU(n, q)` is an involution if and only if `x \\neq 1` and `x^2 = 1`.\nLet `π: SU(n, q) -> PSU(n, q)` be the natural projection homomorphism. An element `x` in `PSU(n, q)` can be written as `x = π(g)` for some `g ∈ SU(n, q)`.\n\nThe condition `x^2 = 1` translates to `π(g)^2 = 1`, which means `π(g^2) = 1`. This is equivalent to `g^2 ∈ ker(π) = Z(SU(n, q))`.\nThe condition `x ≠ 1` translates to `π(g) ≠ 1`, which means `g ∉ Z(SU(n, q))`.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of elements `g ∈ SU(n, q)` such that:\n1.  `g ∉ Z(SU(n, q))`\n2.  `g^2 ∈ Z(SU(n, q))`\n\nThese elements `g` are called the \"pre-involutions\" of `PSU(n, q)`. If `g` is a pre-involution, then for any `z` in the center `Z`, `gz` is also a pre-involution that maps to the same involution in `PSU`. Therefore, the number of involutions in `PSU(n, q)` is the number of these pre-involutions divided by the order of the center, `|Z(SU(n, q))|`.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Center Z(SU(4, 997))\n\nThe center `Z(SU(n, q))` consists of scalar matrices `cI` such that `cI ∈ SU(n, q)`. This requires `det(cI) = c^n = 1` and `(cI)` to be unitary, which implies `c^{q+1} = 1`.\nThus, `c` must satisfy `c^n=1` and `c^{q+1}=1`, which is equivalent to `c^{gcd(n, q+1)} = 1`.\nFor our case, `n=4` and `q=997`:\n*   `q+1 = 998 = 2 * 499`.\n*   `d = gcd(n, q+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nThe center `Z(SU(4, 997))` consists of `cI` where `c^2=1`. The solutions for `c` in `F_{997^2}` are `c=1` and `c=-1`.\nSo, `Z(SU(4, 997)) = {I, -I}`. The order of the center is `|Z| = 2`.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Pre-involutions\n\nWe are looking for elements `g ∈ SU(4, 997)` such that `g ∉ {I, -I}` and `g^2 ∈ {I, -I}`. This gives two cases:\n1.  `g^2 = I`\n2.  `g^2 = -I`\n\n**Case 1: `g^2 = -I`**\nLet `g` be an element in `U(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = -I`. As a unitary matrix, `g` is diagonalizable (over `C`), and its eigenvalues `λ` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`, so `λ = ±i`. For `g` to be in `U(n,q)`, its eigenvalues must also satisfy the unitary condition `λ^{-1} = λ^q`.\nLet's check this for `λ = i` and `q=997`:\n*   `i^{-1} = -i`\n*   `i^q = i^{997} = i^{4 \\cdot 249 + 1} = (i^4)^{249} \\cdot i = 1^{249} \\cdot i = i`\nThe condition `i^{-1} = i^q` becomes `-i = i`, which means `2i=0`. This is false since the characteristic of the field is 997.\nA more direct check is `λ^{q+1}=1`. For `λ=i` and `q=997`, we have `i^{997+1} = i^{998} = (i^2)^{499} = (-1)^{499} = -1`. Since this is not 1, `i` cannot be an eigenvalue of any element in `U(n, 997)`.\nTherefore, there are **no** elements `g` in `U(4, 997)` (and thus no elements in `SU(4, 997)`) such that `g^2 = -I`.\n\n**Case 2: `g^2 = I`**\nThese are the involutions in `SU(4, 997)`. Since we need `g ∉ Z`, we are looking for the non-central involutions.\nAn involution `g` is diagonalizable with eigenvalues `+1` and `-1`. Let `k` be the dimension of the `(-1)`-eigenspace. Since `g ∈ SU(4, q)`, its determinant must be 1. `det(g) = (-1)^k = 1`, which implies `k` must be an even number.\nThe possible values for `k` are 0, 2, 4.\n*   `k=0`: `g` is the identity matrix `I`. This is in the center.\n*   `k=4`: `g` is `-I`. This is also in the center.\n*   `k=2`: These are the non-central involutions.\n\nAn involution of type `k=2` is uniquely determined by its `(-1)`-eigenspace, which must be a 2-dimensional non-degenerate subspace of the 4-dimensional unitary space. So, the number of such involutions is equal to the number of non-degenerate 2-dimensional subspaces.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Non-central Involutions\n\nThe number of non-degenerate `m`-dimensional subspaces in an `n`-dimensional unitary space over `F_{q^2}` is given by the formula:\n`N(n, m) = |U(n, q)| / (|U(m, q)| * |U(n-m, q)|)`\n\nFor our case, `n=4` and `m=2`, the number of involutions is `N(4, 2) = |U(4, q)| / |U(2, q)|^2`.\n\nWe use the formula for the order of the unitary group: `|U(k, q)| = q^{k(k-1)/2} * \\prod_{i=1 to k} (q^i - (-1)^i)`.\n*   `|U(2, q)| = q^{1} * (q - (-1))(q^2 - 1) = q(q+1)(q^2-1) = q(q-1)(q+1)^2`.\n*   `|U(4, q)| = q^{6} * (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`.\n    Let's expand `(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`:\n    `= (q-1)(q+1) * (q+1)(q^2-q+1) * (q^2-1)(q^2+1)`\n    `= (q-1)(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1) * (q-1)(q+1)(q^2+1)`\n    `= (q-1)^2(q+1)^3(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n    So, `|U(4, q)| = q^6(q-1)^2(q+1)^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`. (Note: my previous `|SU(4,q)|` expansions were flawed, leading to confusion). A common expression for `|U(4, q)|` is `q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`.\n\nLet's compute the ratio:\nNumber of involutions = `|U(4, q)| / |U(2, q)|^2`\n`= [q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q(q+1)(q^2-1)]^2`\n`= [q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q^2(q+1)^2(q^2-1)^2]`\n`= q^4 * (q^3+1)(q^4-1) / ((q+1)(q^2-1))`\n`= q^4 * [(q+1)(q^2-q+1)] * [(q^2-1)(q^2+1)] / [(q+1)(q^2-1)]`\n`= q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n\nThis is the number of non-central involutions in `SU(4, q)`, and thus the total number of pre-involutions `g ∉ Z`.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Final Number\n\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is the number of pre-involutions not in the center, divided by the order of the center.\nNumber = `(Number of non-central involutions in SU(4, q)) / |Z|`\nNumber = `q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) / 2`.\n\nNow, we substitute `q = 997`:\nNumber = `997^4 (997^2 - 997 + 1)(997^2 + 1) / 2`\n*   `q^2 = 997^2 = 994009`\n*   `q^2 + 1 = 994010`\n*   `q^2 - q + 1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013`\nNumber = `997^4 * (993013) * (994010) / 2`\nNumber = `997^4 * (993013) * 497005`\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n*   `997^2 = 994009`\n*   `997^4 = (994009)^2 = 988053848081`\n*   `993013 * 497005 = 493530005565`\n*   Number = `988053848081 * 493530005565 = 487532306782413155106365`\n\nFinal Answer: The number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is `q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)/2` with q=997.\nFinal Calculation:\n$997^4 \\cdot (997^2 - 997 + 1) \\cdot (997^2 + 1) / 2$\n$= 988053848081 \\cdot 993013 \\cdot 994010 / 2$\n$= 988053848081 \\cdot 993013 \\cdot 497005$\n$= 487532306782413155106365$\n\n<<<487532306782413155106365>>>"
