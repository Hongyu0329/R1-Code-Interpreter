    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Duality Principle and the Goal\n\nThe problem asks to find the new output matrix `C_o` for a system transformed into **observer canonical form**. The method specified is **duality**.\n\nThe principle of duality connects observability of a system `(A, C)` to the controllability of its dual system `(A', C')`. Specifically, if we transform the dual system `(A', C')` into **controller canonical form** `(A_cc, B_cc)`, then the observer canonical form of the original system `(A, C)` is given by `(A_o, C_o)`, where:\n*   `A_o = A_cc'` (transpose of `A_cc`)\n*   `C_o = B_cc'` (transpose of `B_cc`)\n\nThe goal is to find `C_o`, which means we need to determine the controller canonical form matrix `B_cc` for the dual system.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Dual System\n\nThe original discrete-time system is:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\nwith `A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]` and `C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`.\n\nThe dual system `(A_d, B_d)` is defined by:\n*   `A_d = A'` (transpose of A)\n*   `B_d = C'` (transpose of C)\n\nLet's calculate `A_d` and `B_d`:\n`A_d = A' = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = C' = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\nThe state-space representation of the dual system (for which we analyze controllability) is:\n`z(k+1) = A_d z(k) + B_d u(k)`\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Controllability Indices of the Dual System\n\nThe structure of the controller canonical form `(A_cc, B_cc)` depends on the controllability indices `(μ_1, μ_2, ..., μ_p)` of the dual system `(A_d, B_d)`. Here, `n=3` (state dimension) and `p=2` (input dimension). We must have `μ_1 + μ_2 = 3`.\n\nTo find the indices, we form the controllability matrix `Wc` and select `n=3` linearly independent columns in a specific order.\n`Wc = [B_d, A_d*B_d, A_d^2*B_d, ...]`\n\nThe columns of `B_d` are `b_d1 = [0, 1, 0]'` and `b_d2 = [1, 1, 0]'`.\n\nLet's calculate `A_d*B_d`:\n`A_d * b_d1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]' = [2, 1, 1]'`\n`A_d * b_d2 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [1, 1, 0]' = [3, 2, 1]'`\n\nThe controllability matrix starts with `[b_d1, b_d2, A_d*b_d1, A_d*b_d2, ...]`:\n`Wc = [[0, 1, 2, 3, ...], [1, 1, 1, 2, ...], [0, 0, 1, 1, ...]]`\n\nWe select `n=3` linearly independent vectors by checking columns in order: `b_d1, b_d2, A_d*b_d1, A_d*b_d2, ...`:\n1.  `v1 = b_d1 = [0, 1, 0]'`. This is a non-zero vector.\n2.  `v2 = b_d2 = [1, 1, 0]'`. This is linearly independent of `{v1}`.\n3.  `v3 = A_d*b_d1 = [2, 1, 1]'`. We check if it's linearly independent of `{v1, v2}`.\n    `det([v1, v2, v3]) = det([[0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]]) = -1 * det([[1, 1], [0, 1]]) = -1 * (1) = -1 ≠ 0`.\n    So, `{v1, v2, v3}` are linearly independent.\n\nWe have found 3 linearly independent vectors: `{b_d1, b_d2, A_d*b_d1}`.\nThe number of vectors selected from the chain starting with `b_d1` is 2 (`b_d1` and `A_d*b_d1`). This gives `μ_1 = 2`.\nThe number of vectors selected from the chain starting with `b_d2` is 1 (`b_d2`). This gives `μ_2 = 1`.\nThe controllability indices are `(μ_1, μ_2) = (2, 1)`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Structure of the Canonical Matrix B_cc\n\nThe controller canonical form matrix `B_cc` has a specific sparse structure determined by the controllability indices. For a system with indices `(μ_1, μ_2, ..., μ_p)`, the non-zero rows of `B_cc` are rows `μ_1`, `μ_1 + μ_2`, `μ_1 + μ_2 + μ_3`, etc.\n\nFor our indices `(μ_1, μ_2) = (2, 1)`, the non-zero rows of `B_cc` are:\n*   Row `μ_1 = 2`\n*   Row `μ_1 + μ_2 = 3`\n\nThe other rows are all zero. By applying an appropriate input transformation, the simplest form of `B_cc` has a single `1` in each of these non-zero rows. The `j`-th non-zero row will have a `1` in the `j`-th column.\n*   Row 2 will be `[1, 0]`.\n*   Row 3 will be `[0, 1]`.\n\nSo, the controller canonical matrix `B_cc` is:\n`B_cc = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\n### Step 5: Find the New Matrix C_o\n\nAccording to the duality principle, the new output matrix `C_o` of the observer canonical form is the transpose of the `B_cc` matrix of the dual system's controller canonical form.\n`C_o = B_cc'`\n\n`C_o = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]' = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThus, the value of the new matrix C is `[[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`."
