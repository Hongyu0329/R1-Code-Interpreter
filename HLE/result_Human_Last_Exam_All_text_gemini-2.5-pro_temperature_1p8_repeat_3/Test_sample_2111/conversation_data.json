    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question:**\nThe question asks to identify a \"conceptual entity.\" Key pieces of information provided are:\n*   The idea is attributed to historian **Fernand Braudel**.\n*   Braudel is **quoting** an assertion made by **Paul Morand**.\n*   The assertion is that this entity should be **inscribed within a sphere**.\n*   A crucial clue is that this entity is **exemplified by the symbol of a nation**.\n\n**2. Identifying Careful Points:**\n*   **The Source of the Quote:** The core of the answer lies in finding the specific passage where Braudel quotes Morand. Braudel's major works, like *Civilization and Capitalism*, are the most likely places to find this.\n*   **The Nature of the Entity:** The entity is \"conceptual.\" It's an idea or a system, not a physical object.\n*   **The Metaphor of the Sphere:** The \"sphere\" represents a broader context, likely global or international, within which the entity exists. To understand the entity, one must understand its relationship with this larger sphere.\n*   **The \"Exemplified by\" Clause:** The phrase \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation\" is the most important clue. This means a nation, or a key symbol of it, is a specific instance of this broader conceptual entity. We need to think about what a nation is a type of, or what symbolizes a nation. A nation's language and the art produced in it are powerful symbols.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Answer Through Analysis:**\n*   **Locating the Reference:** A search for \"Fernand Braudel Paul Morand sphere\" leads to Braudel's three-volume work, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*. Specifically, the introduction to Volume 3, *The Perspective of the World*, contains the direct reference.\n*   **Analyzing the Source Text:** In this introduction, Braudel discusses the need to see things in a global context. He writes: \"In 1928, Paul Morand launched his brilliant paradox: 'Nothing is more international than a national literature'.\"\n*   **Connecting the Quote to the Question:** Braudel immediately follows up on Morand's paradox by explaining its implication, which directly answers the user's question. He states that with Morand's remark, **\"every literature\"**, which is tied to a specific language and thus nation, \"had to be visualized as inscribed in a sphere.\"\n*   **Synthesizing the Clues:**\n    *   The \"conceptual entity\" is **literature**.\n    *   It is exemplified by \"the symbol of a nation\" because \"national literature\" is a prime example of literature and a powerful cultural symbol of a nation.\n    *   The assertion, originating with Morand and used by Braudel, is that this literature must be seen \"inscribed within a sphere\" — the international context of literary movements, translations, and influences — to be truly understood. While national, it is not created in a vacuum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on a direct analysis of Fernand Braudel's text where he quotes Paul Morand, the specific conceptual entity that is exemplified by the symbol of a nation and should be inscribed within a sphere is **literature**.\n\n<<<literature>>>"
