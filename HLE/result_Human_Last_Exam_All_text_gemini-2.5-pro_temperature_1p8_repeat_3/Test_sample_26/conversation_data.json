    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object X**\n*   $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   The complex dimension of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 3. A hypersurface in it has complex dimension $3-1=2$. So, $X$ is a complex surface.\n*   The real dimension of $X$ is 4. $X$ is a compact, complex, and thus orientable 4-dimensional manifold.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Betti numbers of X**\nWe can compute the topological invariants of $X$, specifically its Betti numbers $b_k(X) = \\text{rank}(H_k(X, \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n1.  **Connectivity and Low-dimensional Homology:**\n    *   The **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem** states that for a smooth complex hypersurface $X$ of dimension $k$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homology and homotopy groups for low degrees.\n    *   For homotopy: $i_*: \\pi_j(X) \\to \\pi_j(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ is an isomorphism for $j < k=2$.\n    *   We know $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. $X$ is simply connected.\n    *   Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$, so $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$. Thus, $b_1(X) = 0$.\n    *   Since $X$ is connected, $b_0(X) = 1$.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Duality:**\n    *   $X$ is a compact, orientable 4-manifold. By Poincaré Duality, $b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X)$.\n    *   $b_4(X) = b_0(X) = 1$.\n    *   $b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Euler Characteristic and $b_2(X)$:**\n    *   The Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ can be computed using Chern classes. For a degree $d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, its total Chern class $c(T_X)$ is given by the formula $c(T_X) = \\frac{c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^n}|_X)}{c(N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^n})}$.\n    *   Here $n=3$, $d=5$. Let $h$ be the hyperplane class. $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}) = (1+h)^4$. The normal bundle is $N_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(5)$, with Chern class $1+5h$.\n    *   $c(T_X) = \\frac{(1+h)^4}{1+5h}|_X = (1+4h+6h^2+\\dots)(1-5h+25h^2-\\dots)|_X = 1-h+11h^2+\\dots$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic is the top Chern class evaluated on the fundamental class of $X$, so $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(T_X) = \\int_X 11h^2$.\n    *   The integral $\\int_X h^2$ is the degree of $X$, which is 5.\n    *   So, $\\chi(X) = 11 \\times 5 = 55$.\n    *   Using the Betti numbers: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2+b_2$.\n    *   $55 = 2 + b_2 \\implies b_2(X) = 53$.\n\nSummary of Betti numbers: $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_2=53, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Homotopy and Homology using Rational Homotopy Theory**\nWe want to find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$, which is the dimension of the rational vector space $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. Rational homotopy theory provides a powerful tool for this.\n\n1.  **The Rational Homotopy Long Exact Sequence:**\n    For the inclusion $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$, there is an associated long exact sequence in rational homotopy theory:\n    $\\dots \\to \\pi_k(X)_q \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)_q \\to H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\pi_{k-1}(X)_q \\to \\dots$\n    where $\\pi_k(-)_q = \\pi_k(-) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. The relative rational homotopy group $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)_q$ is replaced by the relative rational homology group $H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})$ because the base space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected.\n\n2.  **Rational Homotopy of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$:**\n    The rational homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ are known: $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is zero unless $k=2$ (where it is $\\mathbb{Q}$) or $k=2n+1$ (where it is $\\mathbb{Q}$). For $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ ($n=3$), non-zero groups are $\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)_q \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\pi_7(\\mathbb{CP}^3)_q \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Therefore, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)_q = 0$ and $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3)_q = 0$.\n\n3.  **Splicing the Long Exact Sequence:**\n    Let's write down the sequence around $k=4$:\n    $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3)_q \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\pi_3(X)_q \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)_q$\n    Substituting the known zero groups:\n    $0 \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\pi_3(X)_q \\to 0$\n    This exactness implies an isomorphism: $\\pi_3(X)_q \\cong H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Relative Rational Homology Group $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})$**\nWe use the long exact sequence of homology for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ with rational coefficients.\n\n1.  **The Long Exact Sequence:**\n    $\\dots \\to H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\dots$\n\n2.  **Identify the Terms:**\n    *   $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$ since $b_4(X)=1$. It's generated by the fundamental class of $X$, denoted $[X]$.\n    *   $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$. It's generated by the class of a hyperplane (a copy of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$), denoted $[\\mathbb{CP}^2]$.\n    *   The map $i_*: H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Q})$ sends $[X]$ to its class in the ambient space. A hypersurface of degree $d=5$ is homologous to 5 times the hyperplane class. So, $i_*([X]) = 5[\\mathbb{CP}^2]$. As a map from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{Q}$, this is multiplication by 5.\n    *   $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ since $b_3(X)=0$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Sequence:**\n    The sequence becomes:\n    $\\mathbb{Q} \\xrightarrow{\\times 5} \\mathbb{Q} \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to 0$\n    The map $\\times 5: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}$ is an isomorphism (since 5 is invertible in $\\mathbb{Q}$). This means it is surjective.\n    Exactness at the middle term means that the kernel of the map $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to 0$ (which is all of $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})$) is equal to the image of the preceding map $\\mathbb{Q} \\xrightarrow{\\times 5} \\mathbb{Q}$ (which is all of $\\mathbb{Q}$).\n    More simply, $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is the cokernel of the map $i_*$. Since $i_*$ is an isomorphism, its cokernel is the zero group.\n    Therefore, $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n*   From Step 3, we have the isomorphism $\\pi_3(X)_q \\cong H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n*   From Step 4, we found that $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$.\n*   Therefore, $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = 0$.\n*   The rank of a group is the dimension of its rationalization. The dimension of the zero vector space is 0.\n*   The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0. (Note: this does not imply that $\\pi_3(X)$ is the trivial group, only that it is a torsion group).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$."
