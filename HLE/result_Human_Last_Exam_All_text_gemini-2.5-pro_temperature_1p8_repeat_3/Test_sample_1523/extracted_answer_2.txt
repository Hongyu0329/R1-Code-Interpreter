The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$ is given by the integral of $\phi(x)(-\partial_\mu^2 + m^2)\phi(x)$ over the Euclidean spacetime volume. After an integration by parts, this becomes equal to twice the Euclidean action, $2S_E[\phi]$. Explicitly, it is:
$(\phi, D_\phi) = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^d\mathbf{x} \left[ \left(\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial\tau}\right)^2 + (\nabla\phi)^2 + m^2\phi^2 \right]$
where $\beta=1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $\tau$ is the imaginary time, and $m$ is the mass of the scalar field.
