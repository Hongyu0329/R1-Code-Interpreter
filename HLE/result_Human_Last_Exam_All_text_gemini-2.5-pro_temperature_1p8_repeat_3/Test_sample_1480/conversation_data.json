    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe core of the question is to determine the \"rule activation level\" of a specific fuzzy rule. The rule activation level, also known as the firing strength or firing level, quantifies the degree to which the conditions in the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of a rule are met by the given input.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Components of a Fuzzy Rule\nA typical fuzzy rule has two parts:\n1.  **Antecedent:** The \"IF\" part, which consists of one or more conditions (e.g., \"IF temperature is HIGH and humidity is LOW\").\n2.  **Consequent:** The \"THEN\" part, which specifies the output of the rule (e.g., \"THEN fan speed is FAST\").\n\nThe rule activation level is determined *exclusively* from the antecedent part. The consequent is used in a later stage of the fuzzy inference process (implication) to determine the rule's output fuzzy set.\n\n### Step 3: Deconstruct the Provided Information\nLet's carefully examine each piece of information given in the question:\n\n*   **\"Interval type-3 fuzzy set (IT3FS)\"**: This tells us the type of fuzzy logic system being considered. In a rigorous IT3FLS, the membership values and firing levels are not simple numbers but more complex mathematical objects (specifically, Type-2 Fuzzy Sets). However, the other pieces of information provided are simple scalar numbers (`0.7` and `0.9`). This suggests that the problem is either a conceptual simplification or that `Phi_k(x′)` represents a scalar value derived from the complex IT3FS structure (e.g., after type-reduction or by considering a specific property).\n\n*   **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`**: This notation provides a value associated with the `k`-th rule and an input `x'`. In the context of fuzzy logic, a value derived from the inputs and the antecedent part of the rule represents the firing strength. Therefore, `Phi_k(x′)` should be interpreted as the aggregated degree of truth of the antecedent of the `k`-th rule. This is, by definition, the rule activation level.\n\n*   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`**: The notation `μ` denotes a membership function, and `G` typically represents the fuzzy set in the consequent (\"THEN\" part) of a rule. Thus, this value is the membership grade of an output `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j`. As established in Step 2, the consequent part of the rule does not influence the rule's activation level. Therefore, this information is irrelevant to the question at hand.\n\n*   **\"using a t-norm operation\"**: A t-norm (like MIN or PRODUCT) is the operation used to combine the membership values of the individual conditions in the antecedent to get the final rule activation level. For example, for a rule \"IF $x_1$ is $A_1$ AND $x_2$ is $A_2$\", the activation level would be `t-norm(μ_A1(x_1), μ_A2(x_2))`. The question provides `Phi_k(x′)`, which is the *result* of this t-norm operation on all antecedent conditions. We are not given the individual membership values, so we don't need to perform a t-norm calculation ourselves.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Analysis and Arrive at the Answer\n\n1.  The question asks for the **rule activation level**.\n2.  The term `Phi_k(x′)` represents the computed value of the rule's antecedent for a given input `x'`. By definition, this is the rule activation level.\n3.  The value of `Phi_k(x′)` is given as **0.7**.\n4.  The other information, `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`, relates to the consequent and is not used to calculate the activation level. The mention of \"t-norm\" and \"IT3FS\" provides context but doesn't change the interpretation that `Phi_k(x′)` is the final activation value.\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level is the value given for the antecedent's satisfaction, which is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
