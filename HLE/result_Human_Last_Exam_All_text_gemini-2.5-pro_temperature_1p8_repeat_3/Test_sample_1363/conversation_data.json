    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe core of the question is: \"In which dance is it **impossible** to **overturn a reverse turn** without **disregarding the technique**?\"\nLet's break down the key terms:\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing that turns to the left. It typically consists of a set number of steps with a prescribed amount of rotation.\n*   **Overturn:** To execute more rotation than is standard for the figure. For example, turning a full 360 degrees on a figure that is typically a 3/4 turn.\n*   **Disregarding the technique:** This means breaking the fundamental rules of the dance. These rules include posture, hold, footwork (heel/toe), body action (like CBM - Contra Body Movement), sway, and rise & fall.\n*   **Impossible:** This is the crucial word. We are not looking for a dance where it is difficult, but one where the very mechanics and rules of the dance make overturning a technical violation.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Each Dance Option Based on its Technique\n\n**A. Viennese Waltz & E. Quickstep:**\n*   **Careful Points:** These are fast-paced dances. The primary goal is to travel quickly and dynamically around the floor. While they have standard amounts of turn for figures, the speed and need to navigate floor traffic often require adjustments.\n*   **Analysis:** The techniques of both dances, with their continuous movement and energy, allow for flexibility in the amount of turn. A slight overturn might be necessary to change direction or avoid other couples. While excessive overturning might be poor style, it doesn't necessarily violate a core, prohibitive technical rule. It is mechanically possible to turn more without, for example, breaking the rule of footwork or posture. Therefore, it is not \"impossible\".\n\n**B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot:**\n*   **Careful Points:** These are \"swing\" dances, characterized by smooth, flowing movements, rise and fall, and body sway.\n*   **Analysis:** The techniques of sway, rise and fall, and powerful CBM are the very tools that dancers use to create and control rotation. By exaggerating these technical elements, a dancer can intentionally and correctly create more turn. In fact, \"Overturned\" versions of figures (like the Overturned Reverse Turn in Waltz or Foxtrot) are named, recognized, and taught as part of advanced syllabi. Because overturning is a recognized and technically valid variation in these dances, it is clearly not impossible to do so without disregarding the technique.\n\n**C. European Tango:**\n*   **Careful Points:** Tango's technique is fundamentally different from the other four dances. The most critical points are:\n    1.  **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is kept on a level plane with bent knees. This removes the ability to use \"rise\" to help whip the body around.\n    2.  **No Sway:** Body sway, a key element for generating rotation in swing dances, is absent in Tango.\n    3.  **Staccato Action & Footwork:** The movement is sharp and grounded. Crucially, the \"close\" of a turn is often a \"Tango Close,\" where one foot is brought back and crosses behind the other (e.g., Man's step 3 of the Reverse Turn is LF back in CBMP, crossed behind RF).\n*   **Analysis:** This specific footwork of the Tango Close creates a physical and mechanical block. Once the feet are in this crossed position, further rotation in that direction is severely restricted without taking an extra, incorrect step or losing balance. To force more turn, a dancer would have to do something that violates Tango technique, such as:\n    *   Introduce \"rise\" (breaking rule #1).\n    *   Twist the upper body out of the frame (breaking posture rules).\n    *   Change the footwork from a \"Tango Close\" to a side-by-side close (which is not Tango technique for this figure).\n    *   Lift their heels improperly.\n*   Because the fundamental structure and rules of Tango actively prevent extra rotation within the figure, it is the one dance where overturning a reverse turn is impossible without disregarding the technique.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\nComparing all the dances, the English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, Viennese Waltz, and Quickstep all possess technical elements (like sway, rise, and flow) that can be used to create more rotation, and in some cases, overturned variations are standard. The European Tango, with its unique technique of no rise/fall, no sway, and the mechanically-limiting \"Tango Close,\" makes it impossible to overturn a Reverse Turn without breaking these foundational rules.\n\n<<<C>>>"
