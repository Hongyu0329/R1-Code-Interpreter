    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry (1S, 2R) is given, which is critical. Let's determine if this corresponds to a *cis* or *trans* isomer.\n    *   For a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, if one group is 'up' and the other is 'down' relative to the ring plane, it is *trans*. If both are 'up' or both are 'down', it is *cis*.\n    *   By drawing the molecule and applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, the (1S, 2R) configuration reveals that the Bromine atom and the Methyl group are on opposite sides of the cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the substrate is **trans-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane**.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, bulky base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH).\n*   **Reaction Type:** A secondary alkyl halide reacting with a strong base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. The bulky nature of the base further favors elimination over substitution (SN2).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Mechanism and Stereochemical Requirements of an E2 Reaction**\n\n*   The E2 reaction is a one-step process where the base abstracts a proton (a beta-hydrogen), the leaving group departs, and a double bond is formed simultaneously.\n*   **Crucial Point:** The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The hydrogen to be eliminated and the leaving group (Bromine) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means they must both be in **axial positions** and on opposite sides of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down), which is called a **trans-diaxial** arrangement.\n\n**Step 3: Draw and Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\n\n*   The substrate, trans-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, can exist in two different chair conformations that are in equilibrium.\n    *   **Conformer A (diequatorial):** The Bromine atom is in an equatorial position, and the Methyl group is also in an equatorial position. This is the more stable conformer because bulky groups prefer the less sterically hindered equatorial positions.\n    *   **Conformer B (diaxial):** The Bromine atom is in an axial position, and the Methyl group is also in an axial position. This is the less stable conformer due to significant 1,3-diaxial steric interactions.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Although Conformer A is more stable and thus more populated at equilibrium, it **cannot** undergo an E2 reaction because the leaving group (Br) is equatorial, not axial. The E2 reaction must proceed through the less stable **Conformer B**, where the Bromine is in the required axial position.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Possible Elimination Pathways from the Reactive Conformer**\n\n*   We must now examine Conformer B (the diaxial conformer) to see which beta-hydrogens can be abstracted. The leaving group is the axial Bromine on Carbon-1 (C1). The beta-hydrogens are on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Elimination at C2:**\n    *   On C2, the Methyl group is in the axial position.\n    *   This means the hydrogen atom on C2 is in the **equatorial** position.\n    *   An equatorial hydrogen is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Elimination cannot occur by removing the hydrogen from C2. The formation of 1-methylcyclohexene (the more substituted, or Zaitsev, product) is stereochemically forbidden.\n\n*   **Elimination at C6:**\n    *   On C6, there are two hydrogens: one axial and one equatorial.\n    *   The **axial hydrogen** on C6 is anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) to the axial bromine on C1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The bulky base (tert-butoxide) can and will abstract this axial hydrogen.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Product**\n\n*   Since the only possible E2 elimination pathway involves abstracting the axial hydrogen from C6, the double bond will form between C1 and C6.\n*   The methyl group on C2 is unaffected and remains in its position.\n*   The resulting alkene has the methyl group on the carbon adjacent to the double bond.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, we number the ring starting from the double bond to give the substituent the lowest possible number. The double bond carbons are C1 and C2, which means the methyl group is on C3.\n*   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted (or Hofmann) product, and it is formed exclusively because of the strict stereochemical constraints of the E2 reaction on this specific starting material.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
