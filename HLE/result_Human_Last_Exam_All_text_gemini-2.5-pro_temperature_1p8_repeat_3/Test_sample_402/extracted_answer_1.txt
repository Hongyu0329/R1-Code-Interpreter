The proposed filtering strategy is to first perform a differential expression analysis comparing the contaminated `CAR_only` samples against the clean `CAR_IL15` samples. In the resulting data table, the contaminating cancer-specific genes will appear with a large and statistically significant positive log2 fold change (L2FC). The filtering strategy is to then remove all genes that exceed a stringent L2FC threshold. A recommended starting threshold is an L2FC greater than 5, which corresponds to a more than 32-fold increase in expression and is highly indicative of contamination rather than a true biological difference. This can be implemented in a bioinformatics pipeline via a command-line tool like `awk`. Assuming the DE results are in a tab-separated file named `DE_results.tsv` and L2FC is in the third column, the following command will filter out the contaminants: `awk 'NR==1 || $3 <= 5' DE_results.tsv > filtered_DE_results.tsv`. Before finalizing the analysis, it is crucial to validate the list of removed genes to confirm they are indeed associated with the cancer cell line used in the experiment.
