    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What is being asked?** The total number of members in a specific microRNA (miRNA) family.\n    *   **Which family?** The let-7 family.\n    *   **In which organism?** Humans (*Homo sapiens*).\n    *   **What is the timeframe?** \"To date,\" meaning the current, established number according to scientific consensus.\n\n2.  **Define \"Family Member\":**\n    *   A microRNA \"family\" is a group of miRNAs that share a similar sequence, particularly in the \"seed region\" (nucleotides 2-8 of the mature miRNA). This shared seed sequence means they can regulate a similar set of target genes.\n    *   The question asks for the number of distinct *mature* miRNAs. This is a crucial point because several different genes (precursor miRNAs) can be processed to produce the exact same mature miRNA sequence. For example, `hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, and `hsa-let-7a-3` are three different precursor genes, but they all produce the same mature miRNA, `hsa-let-7a`. Therefore, `let-7a` is counted as a single member.\n\n3.  **Identify and List the Members:**\n    *   To find the members, we consult primary biological databases like miRBase (the central repository for miRNA data) and peer-reviewed scientific literature.\n    *   The human let-7 family consists of miRNAs named with the \"let-7\" prefix and a letter suffix.\n    *   Based on these sources, the members are:\n        1.  `let-7a`\n        2.  `let-7b`\n        3.  `let-7c`\n        4.  `let-7d`\n        5.  `let-7e`\n        6.  `let-7f`\n        7.  `let-7g`\n        8.  `let-7i`\n\n4.  **Identify Non-obvious Members and Exclusions (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Absence of `let-7h`:** It is a known fact that a human homolog of `let-7h` has not been identified, so it is not included in the count.\n    *   **Inclusion of `miR-98`:** The miRNA `miR-98` shares the same seed sequence as the let-7 family and is functionally and evolutionarily related. Scientific consensus universally includes `miR-98` as a member of the human let-7 family. So, we add `miR-98` to our list.\n        9.  `miR-98`\n\n5.  **Final Tally:**\n    *   Counting the members listed in steps 3 and 4 gives us a total.\n    *   let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i (8 members) + miR-98 (1 member) = 9 members.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n*   **Mature vs. Precursor:** Count the number of unique mature miRNAs, not the precursor genes.\n*   **Nomenclature:** Be aware that the family includes members with the `let-7` prefix as well as `miR-98`.\n*   **Exclusions:** Know that `let-7h` is not present in humans.\n*   **Verification:** This number is widely cited and confirmed in authoritative sources such as miRBase and numerous scientific reviews on the let-7 family.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final count of distinct mature let-7 family members identified in humans is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
