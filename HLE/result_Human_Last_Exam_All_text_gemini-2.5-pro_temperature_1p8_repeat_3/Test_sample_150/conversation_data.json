    "This is an analysis of the provided program and problem.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question\n1.  **Initial State:** A single integer variable `x` is initialized to `0`.\n2.  **Input:** The program first reads an integer `n`, which represents the total number of statements to be executed. Following this, `n` lines are read, each containing one statement.\n3.  **Statements:** A statement is a string of 3 characters. It involves one variable 'X' and one operation, either '++' (increment) or '--' (decrement).\n4.  **Possible Statements:** The operation and variable can be in any order. This means there are four valid types of statements:\n    *   `++X` (prefix increment)\n    *   `X++` (postfix increment)\n    *   `--X` (prefix decrement)\n    *   `X--` (postfix decrement)\n5.  **Execution:** For each statement read, the value of `x` must be updated. If the statement contains '++', `x` is incremented by 1. If it contains '--', `x` is decremented by 1.\n6.  **Output:** After all `n` statements have been executed, the final value of `x` should be printed.\n\n### Careful points regarding the submitted program\n1.  **Incomplete Logic:** The Java code uses `if (test.contains(\"++X\"))` to check for increments and `if (test.contains(\"--X\"))` for decrements.\n2.  **Missing Cases:** This logic only correctly identifies the prefix versions of the operations (`++X` and `--X`). It fails to handle the postfix versions (`X++` and `X--`). For example, if the input string is `\"X++\"`, neither of the `if` conditions will be true, and the value of `tresult` (which represents `x`) will not be changed.\n3.  **Correctness:** Due to the missing cases, the submitted program is incorrect and will fail on inputs containing postfix statements. Therefore, it does not solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis to acquire the final answer\n\nSince the program is incorrect, the answer must start with 'N'. We now need to write the most efficient C program to determine the values for `x` (character comparisons) and `y` (memory usage).\n\n**1. Designing an efficient C program:**\nThe core of the problem is to check if a statement is an increment or a decrement. We can observe the structure of the four possible statements:\n*   `++X`\n*   `X++`\n*   `--X`\n*   `X--`\nIn all these cases, the character at index 1 of the 3-character string is always an operator (`+` or `-`) and never 'X'. This provides a very simple and efficient way to determine the operation. We can read the statement and check only the character at index 1.\n\n**2. Calculating `x` (smallest number of character comparisons for n=100):**\n*   For each of the `n` statements, our efficient logic only needs to perform one character comparison: `if (statement[1] == '+')`.\n*   If the input size `n` is 100, the total number of character comparisons for the core logic will be `100 * 1 = 100`.\n*   So, `x = 100`.\n\n**3. Calculating `y` (smallest memory size in Bytes):**\nTo achieve the smallest memory footprint, we should use the smallest possible data types for our variables.\n*   **Variable `n`:** The problem constraint is `1 <= n <= 100` (based on the prompt). An `unsigned char` (1 byte, range 0-255) is sufficient to store `n`.\n*   **Variable `x`:** The final value of `x` will be in the range `[-n, +n]`. For `n=100`, the range is `[-100, 100]`. A `signed char` (1 byte, range -128 to 127) is sufficient.\n*   **Statement Buffer:** To read the 3-character statement string using `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` (a standard and efficient method), we need a buffer that can hold the 3 characters plus a null terminator. Thus, `char statement[4]` is required, which takes 4 bytes.\n*   **Total Memory `y`:** The sum of memory for these variables is `sizeof(unsigned char) + sizeof(signed char) + sizeof(char[4]) = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6` bytes.\n*   So, `y = 6`.\n\n**4. Final Answer Formulation:**\n*   The program is incorrect: **N**\n*   The value for `x` is **100**.\n*   The value for `y` is **6**.\n*   Following the format `Nx+y`, the result is `N100+6`.\n\n<<<N100+6>>>"
