    "An analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the inputs and the goal of the algorithm:**\n    *   Inputs: `n` (a non-negative integer), `c` (an integer base, `c ≥ 2`).\n    *   Goal: To find the base `c` representation of `n`.\n    *   The complexity will be a function of the input size, which is determined by the value of `n`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the cost of each step in the algorithm:**\n    *   We will assume that basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on integers that fit within a computer's word size take constant time, O(1). This is a standard assumption for this level of algorithm analysis.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Initialization**\n        *   `i := 0;` (1 assignment)\n        *   `x := n;` (1 assignment)\n        *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` (1 division)\n        *   `a_{0} := x — qc;` (1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment)\n        *   This step consists of a fixed number of elementary operations. Therefore, its time complexity is constant, **O(1)**.\n\n    *   **Step 2: The `while` loop**\n        *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. We need to determine the number of iterations.\n        *   Inside the loop, `x` takes the value of `q` from the previous step (`x := q`), and then `q` is updated to `⌊x/c⌋`. This means that in each iteration, the value of `q` is reduced by a factor of `c`.\n        *   The loop effectively counts how many times we can divide `n` by `c` until the quotient becomes 0.\n        *   Let `k` be the number of iterations.\n        *   Initially, before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   After 1 iteration, `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        *   After `k-1` iterations, `q` becomes `⌊n/c^k⌋`. The loop terminates when this value, in the next iteration becomes 0. This happens when `n/c^k < 1`, or `c^k > n`.\n        *   Taking the logarithm to the base `c` of both sides of `c^k > n`, we get `k > log_c(n)`.\n        *   Therefore, the number of iterations of the loop is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`. The number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`. So, the number of iterations is **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n    *   **Step 2.1: Inside the loop**\n        *   `i := i + 1;` (1 increment)\n        *   `x := q;` (1 assignment)\n        *   `q :=. ⌊x/c⌋;` (1 division)\n        *   `a_{i} := x — qc` (1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment)\n        *   The body of the loop consists of a fixed number of elementary operations. So, the cost of one iteration is constant, **O(1)**.\n\n    *   **Total cost of the loop:**\n        *   The total time for the loop is the number of iterations multiplied by the cost per iteration.\n        *   Total loop time = O(log_c(n)) * O(1) = **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Return statement**\n        *   The algorithm returns a sequence of digits `(a_i, a_{i-1}, ..., a_0)`.\n        *   The number of digits is `i+1`. Since `i` is the number of times the loop executed, `i = ⌊log_c(n)⌋`. The number of digits is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`, which is of the order O(log_c(n)).\n        *   Returning this sequence may take time proportional to its length. So, the complexity of this step is **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n3.  **Combine the costs to find the overall complexity:**\n    *   The total time complexity `T(n)` is the sum of the complexities of all steps.\n    *   `T(n) = T(initialization) + T(loop) + T(return)`\n    *   `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(log_c(n))`\n    *   The dominant term in this expression is O(log_c(n)).\n\n4.  **Simplify the final expression:**\n    *   The complexity is O(log_c(n)). Using the change of base formula for logarithms, we know that `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`.\n    *   Since `c` is a constant such that `c ≥ 2`, `log(c)` is also a positive constant. In Big-O notation, we can ignore constant factors.\n    *   Therefore, O(log_c(n)) is equivalent to O(log n).\n\n### Careful points:\n\n*   **Cost of Arithmetic Operations:** The analysis hinges on the assumption that division and modulo operations take constant time. For arbitrarily large numbers, this isn't true. If we were to consider bit complexity, where the input size is `k = log n` bits, a division takes `O(k^2)` or better (`O(k log k)` with faster algorithms). This would lead to a higher overall complexity, such as `O((log n)^2)`. However, for typical algorithmic analysis, the O(1) assumption for basic arithmetic is standard unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Variable in Complexity:** The complexity is a function of the input value `n`, not the number of digits in `n`. The number of digits is logarithmic with respect to `n`.\n*   **Role of `c`:** The base `c` is treated as a constant. If `c` were a variable input, the complexity would also depend on `c`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The loop iterates approximately `log_c(n)` times, and each iteration performs a constant number of operations. Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(log n)**.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
