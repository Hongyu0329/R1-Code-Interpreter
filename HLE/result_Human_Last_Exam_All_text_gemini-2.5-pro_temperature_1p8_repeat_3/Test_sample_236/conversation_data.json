    "This problem asks for the number of distinct homology cobordism classes of 3-manifolds that can be obtained by an integral surgery on a knot with four or fewer crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Knots and Surgeries\n\nFirst, we need to list all knots with a crossing number of at most four. These are:\n*   **0 crossings:** The unknot, denoted $0_1$.\n*   **1 and 2 crossings:** There are no knots.\n*   **3 crossings:** The right-handed trefoil knot ($3_1$) and its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil ($m(3_1)$).\n*   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). A key property of the figure-eight knot is that it is amphichiral, meaning it is isotopic to its mirror image ($4_1 \\cong m(4_1)$).\n\nNext, we identify the relevant surgeries. A Dehn surgery on a knot $K$ in the 3-sphere $S^3$ results in a new 3-manifold, denoted $S^3_r(K)$ where $r=p/q$ is the surgery coefficient. For the resulting manifold to be a homology 3-sphere (i.e., having the same integer homology groups as $S^3$), its first homology group $H_1(S^3_r(K); \\mathbb{Z})$ must be trivial. The order of this group is given by $|p|$ for a surgery on a knot. Thus, we require $|p|=1$. Since the question specifies \"integral surgery,\" the coefficient is an integer $n = p/1 = p$. Therefore, we are looking for surgeries with coefficients $n = +1$ and $n = -1$.\n\nWe will now analyze the homology cobordism classes of the manifolds $S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)$ for each knot $K$ identified above.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Surgery on the Unknot ($0_1$)\n\n*   Surgery on the unknot with an integer coefficient $n$ produces the lens space $L(n, 1)$.\n*   For $n=+1$, we get $S^3_{+1}(0_1) = L(1,1) = S^3$.\n*   For $n=-1$, we get $S^3_{-1}(0_1) = L(-1,1) = S^3$.\n*   The 3-sphere $S^3$ represents the identity element in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_3^H$.\n*   **Result from the unknot:** 1 element (the identity).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Surgery on the Trefoil Knots ($3_1$ and $m(3_1)$)\n\nLet's consider the right-handed trefoil, $3_1$.\n*   **+1 surgery:** The manifold $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$ is the famous Poincaré homology sphere. Let's denote its class in $\\Theta_3^H$ by $[P]$. This class is known to be non-trivial. A key invariant demonstrating this is the Rokhlin invariant, $\\mu(P)=1$.\n*   **-1 surgery:** To identify the class of $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$, we use the identity relating surgery on a knot and its mirror: $-M(K, r) \\cong M(m(K), -r)$, where $-M$ denotes the manifold with reversed orientation.\n    Applying this, $-S^3_{-1}(3_1) \\cong S^3_{+1}(m(3_1))$. The manifold $S^3_{+1}(m(3_1))$ is the Poincaré sphere with reversed orientation, $-P$. So, $-S^3_{-1}(3_1) \\cong -P$, which implies $S^3_{-1}(3_1) \\cong P$. Thus, its class is also $[P]$.\n*   **Surgeries on the left-handed trefoil ($m(3_1)$):**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(m(3_1))$ is diffeomorphic to $-P$. Its class is $[-P]$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(m(3_1)) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(3_1) = -P$. Its class is also $[-P]$.\n*   **Consolidating results for trefoils:** Surgeries on the trefoil knots give rise to two potential classes: $[P]$ and $[-P]$. A fundamental result in low-dimensional topology states that the Poincaré sphere has order 2 in the homology cobordism group. This means $P \\# P$ bounds a homology 4-ball, which implies $[P]+[-P]=0$, or $[P]=[-P]$.\n*   **Result from trefoils:** 1 non-trivial element, the class of the Poincaré sphere.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Surgery on the Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)\n\nThe figure-eight knot is amphichiral, meaning $4_1 \\cong m(4_1)$. Its signature is $\\sigma(4_1)=0$.\n*   Let $M_1 = S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ and $M_2 = S^3_{-1}(4_1)$.\n*   **Rokhlin Invariant:** The Rokhlin invariant of a homology sphere from $\\pm 1$ surgery on a knot $K$ is determined by the knot signature $\\sigma(K)$. For any surgery on the figure-eight knot, the resulting manifold bounds a spin 4-manifold with signature $\\sigma(4_1) = 0$. This implies the Rokhlin invariant of both $M_1$ and $M_2$ is 0. This distinguishes their classes from the Poincaré sphere class $[P]$ (which has $\\mu=1$).\n*   **Non-triviality and distinctness:** We use stronger invariants like the Heegaard-Floer d-invariants.\n    *   For $M_1 = S^3_{+1}(4_1)$, the d-invariant is $d(M_1) = -2$. Since this is non-zero, $[M_1]$ is not the identity element.\n    *   For $M_2 = S^3_{-1}(4_1)$, we use the identity relating it to $M_1$. Since $4_1$ is amphichiral: $M_2 = S^3_{-1}(4_1) \\cong S^3_{-1}(m(4_1)) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(4_1) = -M_1$.\n    *   The d-invariant is a homomorphism, so $d(M_2) = d(-M_1) = -d(M_1) = -(-2) = 2$. Since $d(M_2) \\neq 0$, $[M_2]$ is also not the identity element.\n*   **Are $[M_1]$ and $[M_2]$ distinct?** They are distinct if $[M_1] \\neq [M_2]$. We know $[M_2] = [-M_1]$. So we need to check if $[M_1] = [-M_1]$, which means we check if $[M_1]$ has order 2. If it has order 2, then $[M_1]+[M_1]=0$. Then $d([M_1]+[M_1]) = d(M_1)+d(M_1) = -2 + (-2) = -4$ must be 0. Since $-4 \\neq 0$, the class $[M_1]$ is not of order 2.\n*   Therefore, $[M_1]$ and $[M_2]=[-M_1]$ are two distinct, non-trivial homology cobordism classes.\n*   **Result from the figure-eight knot:** 2 distinct, non-trivial elements.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nLet's list all the distinct homology cobordism elements we have found:\n\n1.  The identity element, $[S^3]$, from surgery on the unknot.\n2.  The class of the Poincaré sphere, $[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$, from surgery on the trefoil knots.\n3.  The class $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$, from +1 surgery on the figure-eight knot.\n4.  The class $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$, from -1 surgery on the figure-eight knot.\n\nThese four elements are all distinct from each other, as demonstrated by the Rokhlin and d-invariants. Therefore, there are a total of 4 such elements.\n\n<<<4>>>"
