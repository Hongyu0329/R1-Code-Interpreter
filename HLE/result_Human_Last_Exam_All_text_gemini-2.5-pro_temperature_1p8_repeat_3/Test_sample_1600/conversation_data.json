    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the problem definition:**\n*   The function `a(n)` represents the number of a specific type of Feynman diagram in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).\n*   **\"Non-vanishing Feynman diagrams\"**: We are counting topologically distinct diagrams that contribute to the physical calculation. Symmetries of the diagram are already taken into account.\n*   **\"Order 2n\"**: In QED, the fundamental interaction is a vertex where an electron line meets a photon line. The order of a diagram corresponds to the number of such vertices. So, we are looking for diagrams with `2n` vertices.\n*   **\"Electron or the photon propagators\"**: These diagrams are corrections to the basic propagation of a single electron or a single photon. They are known as self-energy diagrams. These diagrams have two external lines (one coming in, one going out) and are one-particle irreducible (1PI), meaning they cannot be split into two separate diagrams by cutting a single internal line. The number of such diagrams is the same for both the electron and photon propagator at any given order.\n*   **The goal**: We need to find `a(3)`, which is the number of diagrams of order `2 * 3 = 6`.\n\n**2. Relate the problem to combinatorics:**\n*   The problem of counting these Feynman diagrams can be translated into a combinatorial problem.\n*   A self-energy diagram of order `2n` has `2n` vertices. The topology of the diagram is determined by how these `2n` vertices are connected by internal lines.\n*   In QED, each vertex has three lines meeting: two fermion (electron) lines and one boson (photon) line. Constructing these self-energy diagrams is equivalent to counting the number of ways to form pairs from `2n` distinct points.\n*   Consider the `2n` vertices. Pick one vertex. It can be connected to any of the remaining `2n-1` vertices. Once this pair is formed, pick another vertex from the remaining `2n-2`. It can be connected to any of the other `2n-3` vertices. This process continues until all vertices are paired up.\n*   The number of ways to do this is given by the product `(2n-1) * (2n-3) * (2n-5) * ... * 3 * 1`.\n\n**3. Identify the mathematical formula:**\n*   The product `(2n-1) * (2n-3) * ... * 1` is known as the **double factorial** of `2n-1`, denoted as `(2n-1)!!`.\n*   So, the formula for the number of diagrams is `a(n) = (2n-1)!!`.\n\n**4. Verify the formula for simple cases:**\n*   **For n=1**: This corresponds to order `2*1 = 2`. The diagrams have 2 vertices (a one-loop correction).\n    *   `a(1) = (2*1 - 1)!! = 1!! = 1`. This is correct. There is only one one-loop diagram for self-energy.\n*   **For n=2**: This corresponds to order `2*2 = 4`. The diagrams have 4 vertices (a two-loop correction).\n    *   `a(2) = (2*2 - 1)!! = 3!! = 3 * 1 = 3`. This is also correct. There are three distinct two-loop self-energy diagrams.\n\n**5. Calculate the final answer for a(3):**\n*   We need to find `a(3)`, which is the number of diagrams of order `2*3 = 6`. These are the three-loop corrections.\n*   Using the formula `a(n) = (2n-1)!!` with `n=3`:\n    *   `a(3) = (2 * 3 - 1)!!`\n    *   `a(3) = (6 - 1)!!`\n    *   `a(3) = 5!!`\n*   Now, we compute the value of the double factorial `5!!`:\n    *   `5!! = 5 * 3 * 1`\n    *   `5!! = 15`\n\nTherefore, `a(3)` is 15. There are 15 distinct non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6 for the electron or photon propagators.\n\n***\n\n<<<15>>>"
