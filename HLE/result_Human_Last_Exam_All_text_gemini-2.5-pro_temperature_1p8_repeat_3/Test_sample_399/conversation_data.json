    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Type of Differential Equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis is a first-order, non-linear, separable ordinary differential equation.\n\n**2. Separate the Variables**\nThe goal is to move all terms involving $x$ to one side of the equation and all terms involving $t$ to the other.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We will divide by $x^2$. We should check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$ for all $t$, then $x'(t)=0$. The right side of the equation becomes $(t-1)(0)^2 = 0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the solution we are looking for is not the trivial solution $x(t)=0$, and we can safely divide by $x^2$.\n\nDivide both sides by $x^2$ and multiply by $dt$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n\n**3. Integrate Both Sides**\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\n\n*   **Left-hand side integration:**\n    $$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x} $$\n*   **Right-hand side integration:**\n    $$ \\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t $$\n\nCombining these results and adding the constant of integration, C:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the Initial Condition to Find the Constant C**\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution to find $C$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Be cautious with the signs during substitution.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**5. Find the Particular Solution**\nSubstitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo find an explicit solution for $x(t)$, first multiply the equation by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x} = -\\left(\\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} $$\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides to solve for $x(t)$:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 8:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{8}{8 \\cdot (-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8})} $$\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{8}{-4t^2 + 8t - 1} $$\nThis is the particular solution that satisfies the initial condition.\n\n**6. Calculate x(1)**\nFinally, we need to find the value of the solution at $t=1$. We substitute $t=1$ into the expression for $x(t)$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4(1)^2 + 8(1) - 1} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4(1) + 8 - 1} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4 + 8 - 1} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{4 - 1} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nThe value of $x(1)$ is $8/3$.\n\n<<<$8/3$>>>"
