The pharmacist should advise Allison that taking Excedrin, which contains aspirin (an NSAID), while she is on Fluoxetine (an SSRI) significantly increases her risk for stomach or intestinal bleeding. For future headaches, she should use a product containing only acetaminophen (Tylenol) as it is a safer alternative. She should also consider discussing her new headaches with her doctor, as they can sometimes be related to her hormonal contraceptive or her antidepressant.
