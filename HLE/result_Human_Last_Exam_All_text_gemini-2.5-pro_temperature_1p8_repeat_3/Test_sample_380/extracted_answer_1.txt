The user's intuition is correct: physically, the polarization of an Alfven Ion Cyclotron (AIC) wave is defined by the rotation of the magnetic field vector in the plane perpendicular to the wave's propagation direction, which is along the local background magnetic field (**B₀**).

However, to answer your specific questions:

1.  **No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial.** The Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) at L1 follows the Parker Spiral, which is typically angled at approximately 45 degrees to the radial direction from the Sun.

2.  **The use of a coordinate system based on the radial direction (like GSE, where the X-axis is Sun-Earth) is a valid and standard practical simplification.** The justification is as follows:
    *   **Measurement Reality:** A spacecraft at L1 measures a time series of the magnetic field as the solar wind flows past it. This wind flows almost perfectly radially (along the GSE X-axis) at speeds much higher than the Alfven speed.
    *   **Taylor's Hypothesis:** This high-speed flow allows us to use Taylor's "frozen-in" Hypothesis, which treats the time series as a one-dimensional spatial cut through the plasma along the flow direction (the radial X-axis).
    *   **Preservation of Polarization Sense:** Because the data is effectively a scan along the X-axis, the wave's transverse properties are measured in the plane perpendicular to this scan, i.e., the Y-Z plane. While this plane is not the same as the true physical plane perpendicular to the magnetic field **B₀**, the mathematical projection of the wave vectors onto this measurement plane **preserves the sign of the helicity**.
    *   **Sufficiency for Identification:** The primary goal of calculating normalized magnetic helicity for AIC waves is to identify their characteristic left-hand polarization (a negative sign). Since the sign is preserved in this simplified calculation, using the Y and Z components of the GSE frame is sufficient and justified for correctly identifying the wave mode. It's a trade-off that sacrifices precision in the helicity's magnitude for a much simpler, yet still conclusive, analysis for wave identification.
