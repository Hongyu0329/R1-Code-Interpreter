    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the vector field and the Hopf charge\n\nThe vector field $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is defined in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as:\n$n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nwhere the functions $f$ and $G$ depend on the spatial coordinates $(x,y,z)$:\n$f = \\text{atan2}(y,x)$\n$r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2+z^2}$\n$G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$\n\nThis vector field $\\mathbf{n}$ is a unit vector for all points in space, so it represents a map from the physical space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to the unit sphere $S^2$. The coordinates $(G, f)$ are the standard spherical coordinates (polar angle, azimuthal angle) on the target sphere $S^2$.\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological invariant that characterizes such maps. For the Hopf charge to be well-defined, the field must approach a constant value at infinity.\nLet's check the behavior of $\\mathbf{n}$ as $|\\mathbf{x}| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} \\to \\infty$.\nAs $|\\mathbf{x}| \\to \\infty$, the term $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2+z^2}$ also goes to infinity.\nThen, $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) \\to \\pi \\exp(-\\infty) = 0$.\nAs $G \\to 0$:\n$n_x \\to \\sin(0)\\cos(f) = 0$\n$n_y \\to \\sin(0)\\sin(f) = 0$\n$n_z \\to \\cos(0) = 1$\nSo, $\\mathbf{n} \\to (0,0,1)$ at infinity. This condition is satisfied, which allows us to treat $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as being compactified to $S^3$. The map is therefore a map $\\mathbf{n}: S^3 \\to S^2$.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Hopf charge as a linking number\n\nThe Hopf charge can be computed as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular points on the target sphere $S^2$. A regular point is one whose preimage is a collection of smooth, non-intersecting curves (1-manifolds).\n\nLet's find the preimages of two judiciously chosen points on $S^2$.\nA good pair of points to consider are the south pole $\\mathbf{p}_S = (0,0,-1)$ and a point on the equator, for example, $\\mathbf{p}_E = (1,0,0)$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the preimage of the South Pole\n\nThe south pole corresponds to $\\mathbf{n} = (0,0,-1)$. This means $n_z = \\cos(G) = -1$, which implies $G = \\pi$.\nLet's find the points $(x,y,z)$ where $G=\\pi$:\n$G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi$\n$\\exp(-10 r_2) = 1$\n$-10 r_2 = 0 \\implies r_2 = 0$\n$r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2+z^2} = 0$\nThis equation is satisfied if and only if both terms under the square root are zero:\n1. $z^2 = 0 \\implies z=0$\n2. $(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 = 0 \\implies x^2+y^2=0.5$\n\nThis describes a circle in the $z=0$ plane (the xy-plane) with radius $\\sqrt{0.5} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, centered at the origin. Let's call this circle $C_S$. This is the preimage of the south pole.\n(Note: The south pole is a critical value of the map, but its preimage is a simple closed curve, which is allowable for this method.)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the preimage of an equatorial point\n\nAn equatorial point, say $\\mathbf{p}_E = (1,0,0)$, corresponds to $\\mathbf{n} = (1,0,0)$.\nThis means:\n1. $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G = \\pi/2$.\n2. $n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f) = \\sin(\\pi/2)\\cos(f) = \\cos(f) = 1$.\n3. $n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f) = \\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin(f) = \\sin(f) = 0$.\n\nFrom conditions 2 and 3, we get $f = 0$. The condition $f = \\text{atan2}(y,x) = 0$ means we are on the positive x-axis half-plane, i.e., $y=0$ and $x>0$.\n\nFrom condition 1, we find the points where $G=\\pi/2$:\n$G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2$\n$\\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2$\n$-10 r_2 = \\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)$\n$r_2 = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{10}$\nSquaring both sides and substituting the definition of $r_2$:\n$(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{10}\\right)^2$\n\nThe preimage of $\\mathbf{p}_E$ is the set of points satisfying both $y=0, x>0$ and the equation above. Substituting $y=0$ into the equation gives:\n$(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{10}\\right)^2$\n\nThis is the equation of a closed loop in the $xz$-plane (specifically, in the $y=0, x>0$ half-plane). Let's call this loop $C_E$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the linking number of the two preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge is the linking number of the two curves, $H = \\text{Lk}(C_S, C_E)$.\n\n*   $C_S$ is a circle in the $xy$-plane: $x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0$.\n*   $C_E$ is a loop in the $xz$-plane defined by $(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$, with $y=0, x>0$.\n\nTo calculate the linking number, we can see if one curve passes through the surface bounded by the other curve. Let's consider the plane containing $C_E$, which is the $xz$-plane.\nThe circle $C_S$ pierces this plane when $y=0$. Setting $y=0$ in the equation for $C_S$ gives $x^2=0.5, z=0$, which yields two points: $(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$ and $(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we check if the loop $C_E$ encloses any of these piercing points. The loop $C_E$ is constrained to $x>0$, so we only need to consider the piercing point $P = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0)$.\nDoes the loop $C_E$ in the $xz$-plane enclose the point $P$?\nThe equation for $C_E$ is $(x^2-0.5)^2+z^2 = K$, where $K = (\\ln(2)/10)^2 > 0$.\nThe curve exists for $x$ values such that $(x^2-0.5)^2 \\le K$, which means $-\\sqrt{K} \\le x^2-0.5 \\le \\sqrt{K}$. This is equivalent to $\\sqrt{0.5-\\sqrt{K}} \\le x \\le \\sqrt{0.5+\\sqrt{K}}$.\nThe point $P$ has $x_P = 1/\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{0.5}$.\nSince $K > 0$, we have $\\sqrt{0.5-\\sqrt{K}} < \\sqrt{0.5} < \\sqrt{0.5+\\sqrt{K}}$.\nThis shows that the piercing point $P$ lies inside the span of the loop $C_E$. Thus, the circle $C_S$ pierces the surface bounded by the loop $C_E$ exactly once.\n\nThe linking number of two such curves is $\\pm 1$. The sign depends on the orientation of the curves, which is determined by the map. For this standard construction of a Hopfion, the linking number is 1.\n\n### Step 6: Confirmation via structural analysis\n\nThe map has the form $(\\rho, \\phi, z) \\mapsto (G(\\rho, z), f=\\phi)$, where $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$ are cylindrical coordinates.\n*   The azimuthal coordinate $\\phi$ in space directly becomes the azimuthal angle $f$ on the sphere. As a point circles the z-axis once ($\\phi: 0 \\to 2\\pi$), the vector $\\mathbf{n}$ sweeps once around the equator of the target sphere ($f: 0 \\to 2\\pi$). This corresponds to a winding number of 1.\n*   The function $G$ depends on the \"toroidal\" coordinates $(\\rho, z)$. $G$ varies from $\\pi$ (at the core circle $r_2=0$) to $0$ (at infinity $r_2 \\to \\infty$). This single sweep of the polar angle corresponds to another winding number of 1.\nThe total Hopf charge is the product of these winding numbers.\n$H = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n>>>1"
