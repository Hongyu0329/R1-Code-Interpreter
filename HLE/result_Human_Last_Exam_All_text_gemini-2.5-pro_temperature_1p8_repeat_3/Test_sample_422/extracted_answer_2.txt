The two problems that JTB runs into under these specific constraints are:
1.  **The Devaluation of Justification:** The model fails to distinguish between a justified false belief (e.g., a once-leading scientific theory) and an unjustified false belief (e.g., a baseless superstition). By categorizing both as simply "Belief," it cannot recognize the epistemic value of having good reasons for a belief, even if that belief turns out to be wrong.
2.  **The False Equivalence of Justified Falsehoods and Unjustified Truths:** The model places a justified false belief (being rationally wrong) in the same category—"Belief"—as an unjustified true belief (being irrationally right or lucky). This is highly counter-intuitive, as it suggests there is no epistemic difference between a diligent thinker who is mistaken and a lucky guesser who happens to be correct.
