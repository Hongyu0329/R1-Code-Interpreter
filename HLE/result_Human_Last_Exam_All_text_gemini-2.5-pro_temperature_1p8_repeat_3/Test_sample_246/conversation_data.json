    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object in question.**\nLet $K$ be the trefoil knot in $S^3$.\nLet $\\tau_5(K)$ be the 5-twist-spun knot of $K$. This is a knotted 2-sphere embedded in the 4-sphere, $S^4$.\nLet $M = \\Sigma_2(S^4, \\tau_5(K))$ be the 2-fold branched cover of $S^4$ along the surface $\\tau_5(K)$.\nWe want to find the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$, denoted $d(\\pi_1(M))$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the fibration theorem for branched covers of twist-spun knots.**\nA key result in 4-manifold topology, due to Pao, Montesinos, and others, states that the double branched cover of $S^4$ over an $m$-twist-spun knot, $\\Sigma_2(S^4, \\tau_m(K))$, is a fiber bundle over the circle $S^1$.\n\n*   **The Fiber:** The fiber of this bundle, let's call it $F$, is the double branched cover of $S^3$ over the original knot $K$. So, $F = \\Sigma_2(S^3, K)$.\n*   **The Monodromy:** The monodromy of the fibration is the $m$-th power of a canonical involution $h: F \\to F$. Let's call the monodromy map $\\phi = h^m$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$.**\nThe fundamental group of a fiber bundle over $S^1$ is given by a semidirect product. Specifically, if $M \\to S^1$ is a fibration with fiber $F$ and monodromy $\\phi: F \\to F$, then its fundamental group is given by:\n$\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\pi_1(F) \\rtimes_{\\phi_*} \\mathbb{Z}$,\nwhere $\\phi_*: \\pi_1(F) \\to \\pi_1(F)$ is the automorphism induced by the monodromy map $\\phi$.\nIn our case, $m=5$, so $\\phi = h^5$, and the induced automorphism is $\\phi_* = (h^5)_* = (h_*)^5$.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the fiber $F$ and its fundamental group $\\pi_1(F)$.**\nThe knot $K$ is the trefoil knot ($3_1$, which can be represented as the torus knot $T(2,3)$).\nIt is a standard result that the double branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil knot is the lens space $L(3,1)$.\nSo, $F = L(3,1)$.\nThe fundamental group of the lens space $L(p,q)$ is the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\nThus, $\\pi_1(F) = \\pi_1(L(3,1)) = \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the monodromy action on the fundamental group.**\nWe need to find the automorphism $(h_*)^5: \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\nA crucial theorem (e.g., Lemma 4.2 in \"Symmetries of 3-manifolds and the assisted Thurston programme\" by Budney and Burton) states that for a prime, non-amphicheiral knot $K$, the canonical involution $h$ on the double branched cover $F = \\Sigma_2(S^3, K)$ induces the identity map on the first homology group $H_1(F, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n*   The trefoil knot is a prime knot.\n*   The trefoil knot is not amphicheiral (i.e., it is chiral; it is not isotopic to its mirror image).\n\nTherefore, this theorem applies. The map $h_*$ on $H_1(L(3,1); \\mathbb{Z})$ is the identity.\nThe fundamental group of the fiber is $\\pi_1(F) = \\mathbb{Z}_3$, which is an abelian group. For an abelian group, the first homology group is isomorphic to the fundamental group ($H_1(F) \\cong \\pi_1(F)/[\\pi_1(F), \\pi_1(F)] = \\pi_1(F)$).\nThus, the automorphism $h_*: \\pi_1(L(3,1)) \\to \\pi_1(L(3,1))$ is the identity map.\nThe monodromy action on the fundamental group is $\\phi_* = (h_*)^5 = (\\text{identity})^5 = \\text{identity}$.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the final group and its minimal number of generators.**\nSince the monodromy action is the identity, the semidirect product becomes a direct product:\n$\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\pi_1(F) \\rtimes_{\\text{id}} \\mathbb{Z} = \\pi_1(F) \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSubstituting the fundamental group of the fiber:\n$\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe now need to find the minimal number of generators for the group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThis is an infinite, abelian group. It contains elements of finite order (from the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ factor), so it cannot be a cyclic group (which would be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_n$).\nSince it is not cyclic, it cannot be generated by a single element. Therefore, it requires at least two generators.\n\nWe can show that two generators are sufficient. Let $a=(1,0)$ and $b=(0,1)$. Any element $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$: $(x,y) = x \\cdot a + y \\cdot b$. So, the set $\\{a,b\\}$ generates the group.\n\nThe minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ is 2.\n\nFinal answer is the minimal number of generators for $\\pi_1(M)$, which we have determined to be 2."
