    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for a specific number of a particular ballet step performed by a specific dancer, in a specific role, with a specific company, in a specific year, and in a specific part of the ballet.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Question's Components:**\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Year:** 2008\n    *   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n    *   **Role:** Kitri\n    *   **Section:** Act I variation\n    *   **Ballet Step:** single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Performance:** The first step is to analyze the correct performance. This requires finding video of Natalia Osipova's 2008 Bolshoi Ballet performance of Don Quixote. The Act I variation is Kitri's first major solo in the ballet, often performed with a fan.\n\n4.  **Understand the Ballet Terminology:**\n    *   **Pirouette en dehors:** An outward turn on one leg. For a right-footed turn, the body rotates to the right.\n    *   **From the fifth position:** The preparation for the turn starts with the dancer's feet in fifth position (one foot in front of the other, heel to toe). The dancer then bends their knees in a *plié* before pushing off into the turn.\n    *   **Single-turn:** The dancer completes one full 360° rotation before landing.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Choreography:** Kitri's Act I variation features a very well-known and standard choreographic sequence. This sequence is a diagonal line of steps moving from upstage to downstage. The specific step combination performed on this diagonal is precisely the one described in the question: a preparation from fifth position into a single pirouette en dehors, repeated several times to travel across the stage.\n\n6.  **Count the Turns:** By observing the video of the 2008 performance, we can count the number of pirouettes in this specific diagonal sequence.\n    *   Osipova begins the sequence upstage.\n    *   She executes the first pirouette from a fifth position plié.\n    *   She repeats this step multiple times to travel down the diagonal.\n    *   Carefully counting each individual turn in this specific sequence reveals the total.\n\n7.  **Conclusion of the Count:** In the standard choreography for this variation, and as executed by Natalia Osipova in the 2008 Bolshoi production, she performs this sequence a total of eight times. There are no other instances of this specific step (single-turn pirouette en dehors from fifth) within the Act I variation. The other turning sequences involve different steps like piqué turns.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of the choreography of Kitri's Act I variation in Don Quixote and review of Natalia Osipova's 2008 performance with the Bolshoi Ballet, she performs a diagonal sequence composed of this exact step. Counting the repetitions in that sequence provides the answer.\n\n<<<8>>>"
