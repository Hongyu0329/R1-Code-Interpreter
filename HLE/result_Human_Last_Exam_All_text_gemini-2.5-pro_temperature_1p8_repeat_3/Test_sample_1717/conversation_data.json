    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:**\n    First, we need the base health values for the Eye of Cthulhu. According to Terraria's game data:\n    *   **Normal Mode Base Health:** 2800 HP\n    *   **Expert Mode Base Health (1 Player):** 3640 HP\n\n2.  **Understand Health Scaling in Expert Mode Multiplayer:**\n    In multiplayer, boss health increases based on the number of active players. For Expert Mode, the health scaling formula for bosses is as follows: The total health is the single-player Expert Mode health plus an additional amount for each player after the first.\n    *   The health increase per additional player is **35%** of the boss's **Normal Mode** base health.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Health Increase Per Player:**\n    We calculate the amount of health added for each player beyond the first one.\n    *   Health Increase = Normal Mode Base Health × 0.35\n    *   Health Increase = 2800 × 0.35 = 980 HP\n\n4.  **Formulate the Health Equation:**\n    Let `N` be the number of players. The total health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for `N` players can be expressed with the following formula:\n    *   Total Health(N) = (1-Player Expert Health) + (N - 1) × (Health Increase Per Player)\n    *   Total Health(N) = 3640 + (N - 1) × 980\n\n5.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:**\n    The question specifies a theoretical scenario with an infinite number of players. If we analyze the formula as `N` approaches infinity:\n    *   `lim (N→∞) [3640 + (N - 1) × 980]`\n    This is a linear function of `N`, which means as `N` increases without bound, the calculated health also increases without bound, approaching infinity.\n\n6.  **Consider the Technical Limitations from the Source Code:**\n    The question explicitly mentions \"according to the source code\". This is a crucial detail. In computer programming, values are stored in variables of specific data types, which have inherent limits.\n    *   In Terraria's source code (written in C#), an NPC's maximum health (`NPC.lifeMax`) is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n    *   A 32-bit signed integer can hold values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum possible value for health is the maximum value of this data type.\n\n7.  **Determine the Final Theoretical Maximum Health:**\n    With an infinite (or just a sufficiently large) number of players, the health formula `3640 + (N - 1) * 980` will produce a number that far exceeds the storage capacity of a 32-bit integer. The game's code prevents this value from overflowing by capping it at the maximum possible value for the data type.\n    *   Therefore, the theoretical maximum health for any NPC in Terraria, including the Eye of Cthulhu, is **2,147,483,647**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Mode Specifics:** The health values and scaling percentages are different for Normal, Expert, and Master modes. The analysis must stick to Expert Mode values.\n*   **Base for Scaling:** The multiplayer health bonus is calculated based on the boss's *Normal Mode* health, not its Expert Mode health. This is a common point of confusion.\n*   **\"Theoretical Maximum\" Context:** In the context of software and source code, \"theoretical maximum\" almost always refers to the limit imposed by the data types used, rather than a purely mathematical limit which might be infinite.\n*   **Integer Overflow:** The analysis relies on the fact that the game clamps the health value at `int.MaxValue` to prevent a C# integer overflow, which would result in an incorrect (and likely negative) number. This is standard practice in game development.\n\nBy following these steps and considering the technical limitations of the game engine, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
