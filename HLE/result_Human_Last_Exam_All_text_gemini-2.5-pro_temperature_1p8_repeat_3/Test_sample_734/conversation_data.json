    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **\"Which Christian theologian...\"**: The request is for a specific individual known for their contributions to Christian theology.\n2.  **\"...first developed...\"**: This points to an originator of a concept or framework, likely a historical figure from the early or medieval church, as these were foundational periods for such doctrines.\n3.  **\"...specialized terminology...\"**: This is a key point. The answer is not just someone who believed in miracles, but someone who created a specific vocabulary or conceptual system to explain them.\n4.  **\"...that can describe changes in the laws of nature...\"**: The theologian's system must address the relationship between God's power and the regular, predictable operation of the natural world. It needs to explain how and why this regular operation could be altered or superseded.\n5.  **\"...applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus...\"**: This is the first test case. The theologian's system must be able to account for a unique, singular miracle that seemingly violates established biological laws.\n6.  **\"...and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall?\"**: This is the second, more complex test case. The system must also be able to describe a potential fundamental and ongoing shift in how the entire natural order works, following the Fall of Man described in Genesis.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"First\" vs. \"Most Famous\"**: Many theologians discussed these issues. For example, Thomas Aquinas developed a very systematic approach with his distinction between God's *potentia ordinata* (ordained power, governing the laws of nature) and *potentia absoluta* (absolute power, what God could do). However, Aquinas built heavily on the work of his predecessors. The question asks who was *first*.\n*   **Specificity of Terminology**: The answer relies on identifying the specific terms or concepts the theologian introduced, not just a general agreement with the biblical accounts.\n*   **Flexibility of the Framework**: The strength of the correct theologian's framework is its ability to handle both a specific, localized miracle (Virgin Birth) and a systemic, universal change in nature's operation (the Fall).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial Candidate Search**: The most likely candidates are foundational thinkers who addressed the nature of creation, miracles, and God's sovereignty. This immediately brings to mind **Augustine of Hippo** (354–430 AD) and later, Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274 AD).\n2.  **Evaluating Augustine**: Augustine predates Aquinas by over 800 years, making him a strong candidate for being \"first.\" He extensively analyzed creation and miracles, particularly in his work *The Literal Meaning of Genesis* (*De Genesi ad litteram*) and *The City of God*.\n3.  **Identifying Augustine's Specialized Terminology**:\n    *   Augustine argued that a miracle is not actually \"contrary to nature\" (*contra naturam*), because the ultimate \"nature\" of a thing is whatever God wills it to be. Instead, a miracle is merely contrary to the *known* course of nature. His precise phrasing was that a miracle is not contrary to nature, but **\"contrary to what we know of nature\" (*contra notam nobis naturam*)**. This is a key piece of specialized terminology.\n    *   To explain how such \"unusual\" events could happen, he developed the concept of **\"seminal reasons\" or \"causal reasons\" (*rationes seminales*)**. He taught that God, at the initial creation, embedded latent potentialities within the natural world. These hidden potentials do not unfold in the usual course of events but can be activated at any time by God's direct will to produce a miracle.\n4.  **Applying Augustine's Terminology**:\n    *   **To the Virgin Birth**: The birth of Jesus from a virgin is an event contrary to the known course of biological reproduction. In Augustine's system, however, it is not contrary to nature in an absolute sense. God simply activated a \"seminal reason\" He had placed within creation (and specifically in Mary) to bring about a human birth without a male seed. It was an unfolding of a pre-ordained potentiality, not a violation of the ultimate order.\n    *   **To the Fall**: Augustine taught that the original state of humanity and nature was different. After the Fall, death and corruption entered the world, representing a fundamental change in the \"usual course of nature.\" His framework allows for this systemic shift. The *ordo naturae* (order of nature) that operated before the Fall was one of grace and harmony. The post-Fall order is one marked by the consequences of sin. God's will established the first order and permitted the second, altered order to arise as a judgment.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Augustine of Hippo was the first major theologian to develop a sophisticated and specific terminology—distinguishing between nature as we know it and nature as God wills it, and using the concept of *rationes seminales*—that could be consistently applied to explain both singular miracles like the virgin birth and systemic alterations to the natural order like those associated with the Fall. While Aquinas later refined these ideas, Augustine was the originator.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
