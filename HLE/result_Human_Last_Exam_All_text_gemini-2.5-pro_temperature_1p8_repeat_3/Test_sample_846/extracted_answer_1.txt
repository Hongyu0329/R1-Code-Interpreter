When the sun rises, the table must change its shape from a relatively straight, extended form (the stable *trans*-isomer) to a bent or folded form (the *cis*-isomer) by absorbing UV light from the sun. When the sun sets and the UV light is gone, the table must revert back to its original, extended shape as the molecule relaxes to its more stable state.
