The edges will be progressively smoothed out, and any closed edge boundaries will shrink and eventually disappear. This is because the iterative process minimizes the total length of the edges (a process known as motion by mean curvature), ultimately causing the image to converge to a constant state (all black or all white), thereby eliminating all edges.
