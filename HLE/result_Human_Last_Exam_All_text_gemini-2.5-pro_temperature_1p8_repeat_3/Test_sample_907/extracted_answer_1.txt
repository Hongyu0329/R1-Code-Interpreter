The equations for the absorption cross-section signal are:
a) When interaction between molecules is neglected:
The absorption spectrum is a single Gaussian peak centered at the transition frequency of an individual molecule, $\omega_e$. Its magnitude is proportional to the number of molecules $N$.
Equation: $\sigma_{exp, a}(\omega_L) = C \cdot N |\vec{\mu} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}|^2 \exp\left(-(\omega_e - \omega_L)^2\tau^2\right)$

b) When nearest-neighbor interaction is considered:
The absorption spectrum is a single Gaussian peak corresponding to the creation of the $k=0$ exciton. Its center is shifted by the interaction energy to $\omega_e + 2J/\hbar$. The total oscillator strength is concentrated into this single transition.
Equation: $\sigma_{exp, b}(\omega_L) = C \cdot N |\vec{\mu} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}|^2 \exp\left(-\left(\omega_e + \frac{2J}{\hbar} - \omega_L\right)^2\tau^2\right)$

Where $C$ is a constant of proportionality, $\vec{\mu}$ is the single-molecule transition dipole moment, $\hat{\epsilon}$ is the laser field polarization, $\tau$ is the pulse duration parameter, $N$ is the number of molecules, and $J$ is the nearest-neighbor coupling energy.
