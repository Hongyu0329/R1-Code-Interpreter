    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Careful Points and Ambiguities\n\n1.  **Definition of Generalized Markov Number:** The term \"generalized Markov number\" \\(m_{p/q}\\) does not have a single, universally agreed-upon definition. Different authors, working in different contexts (like Diophantine approximation, hyperbolic geometry, or group theory), have defined it in ways that are not always equivalent.\n2.  **Two Main Approaches:**\n    *   **The Diophantine Approximation Approach (Perron, Cohn, Cusick):** This approach associates \\(p/q\\) with a specific quadratic irrational number \\(\\theta_{p/q}\\). The continued fraction of \\(\\theta_{p/q}\\) is purely periodic, with the period being a palindrome constructed from the coefficients of the continued fraction of \\(p/q\\). The properties of \\(\\theta_{p/q}\\) (e.g., the value of the quadratic form it is a root of) define the generalized Markov number.\n    *   **The Geometric/Group Theoretic Approach (Series, Bombieri):** This approach associates \\(p/q\\) with a word in the generators (e.g., L and R matrices) of a subgroup of the modular group \\(PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})\\). The generalized Markov number is then the trace of the matrix corresponding to this word. The associated continued fraction would be that of a root of the characteristic polynomial of this matrix.\n3.  **Choice of Method:** The wording of the question \"Compute the continued fraction associated with...\" strongly suggests the first approach is intended. This approach directly constructs a continued fraction, whereas the second approach first computes a number \\(m\\) (the trace), and then one would compute the continued fraction of the quadratic number \\(\\frac{m + \\sqrt{m^2-4}}{2}\\). The association is more direct in the first case. Therefore, we will follow the first approach.\n4.  **Parity of Continued Fraction Length:** The specific construction of the palindromic period depends on whether the length of the simple continued fraction of \\(p/q\\) is even or odd. It's crucial to use the standard form of the continued fraction (where the last coefficient is greater than 1).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Compute the continued fraction of 4/7.**\nWe use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\).\n\\[ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/4} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4/3} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} \\]\nSo, the simple continued fraction is \\(4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\nThe coefficients are \\(a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=3\\). The length of the sequence of coefficients is \\(n=3\\), which is an odd number.\n\n**Step 2: Construct the associated purely periodic continued fraction.**\nWe use the rule for rationals \\(p/q = [0; a_1, \\dots, a_n]\\) where \\(n\\) is odd. According to the theory developed by Cohn and others, the associated quadratic irrational number, let's call it \\(\\theta\\), has a continued fraction that is purely periodic. The periodic part is constructed by creating a palindrome from the coefficients of \\(p/q\\).\n\nThe rule is: the periodic part of the continued fraction for \\(1/\\theta\\) is given by \\((a_n, \\dots, a_1, a_1, \\dots, a_n)\\).\nFirst, we reverse the sequence of coefficients \\((a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3)\\) to get \\((a_3, a_2, a_1) = (3, 1, 1)\\).\nThen, we concatenate this reversed sequence with the original sequence:\nPeriodic part = \\((3, 1, 1)\\) followed by \\((1, 1, 3)\\).\nThis gives the sequence \\((3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3)\\).\n\n**Step 3: Write down the final continued fraction.**\nThe number \\(\\theta\\) is the number associated with \\(m_{4/7}\\). Its continued fraction is what the question asks for.\nFrom Step 2, we found that \\(1/\\theta = [\\overline{3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3}]\\).\nTherefore, the continued fraction for \\(\\theta\\) is:\n\\[ \\theta = \\frac{1}{[\\overline{3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3}]} = [0; \\overline{3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3}] \\]\nThis is the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\)."
