    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Curve and the Problem**\n\nWe are given the curve $C$ defined by the equation $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve defined over the field of 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nWe need to find the number of double points (also called nodes or ordinary double points) in the stable reduction of this curve over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nThe stable reduction of a curve is a \"good\" representative of the curve in characteristic $p$. It is a stable curve, which means it is a connected reduced curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points, and with some conditions on its components of genus 0 and 1 that are satisfied in our case. The number of double points is the number of such singularities.\n\nThe genus of the curve $C$ is $g = \\lfloor (\\deg(f)-1)/2 \\rfloor$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. Since the degree is 5, the genus is $g = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$. The arithmetic genus of the stable reduction must also be 2.\n\n**2. Analyze the Branch Points**\n\nThe stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2=f(x)$ is closely related to the 2-adic properties of the roots of $f(x)=0$, which are the branch points of the 2-to-1 map from $C$ to $\\mathbb{P}^1$. Since the degree of $f(x)$ is odd (5), the point at infinity is also a branch point.\n\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$. One root is $e_0=0$.\nLet $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. Let its roots be $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$. The six branch points are $B = \\{0, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, \\infty\\}$.\n\nTo understand the structure of the stable reduction, we study how these branch points \"cluster\" together in the 2-adic sense. This is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the roots. We use the Newton polygon of $g(x)$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v_2$. The coefficients are $a_4=8, a_3=4, a_2=4, a_1=1, a_0=8$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(a_i))$:\n$P_0=(0, v_2(8)) = (0,3)$\n$P_1=(1, v_2(1)) = (1,0)$\n$P_2=(2, v_2(4)) = (2,2)$\n$P_3=(3, v_2(4)) = (3,2)$\n$P_4=(4, v_2(8)) = (4,3)$\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points has two segments:\n- A segment from $P_0(0,3)$ to $P_1(1,0)$. The slope is $(0-3)/(1-0)=-3$. Its horizontal length is 1. This implies there is one root, say $e_1$, with valuation $v_2(e_1) = -(\\text{slope}) = 3$.\n- A segment from $P_1(1,0)$ to $P_4(4,3)$. The slope is $(3-0)/(4-1)=1$. Its horizontal length is 3. This implies there are three roots, say $e_2, e_3, e_4$, with valuation $v_2(e_i) = -(\\text{slope}) = -1$.\n\nSo, the valuations of the finite branch points (the roots of $f(x)$) are:\n- $v_2(0) = \\infty$\n- $v_2(e_1) = 3$\n- $v_2(e_2) = v_2(e_3) = v_2(e_4) = -1$\n\n**3. Partition the Branch Points and Determine Components of the Stable Reduction**\n\nThe components of the stable reduction correspond to clusters of branch points. Two branch points $b_i, b_j$ are in the same cluster if $v_2(b_i - b_j) > c$ for some threshold $c$. A simplified approach (that works here) is to group points based on their valuation.\n- Points with large positive valuation are \"close\" to 0. Here, $e_1$ (with $v_2(e_1)=3>0$) clusters with 0.\n- Points with negative valuation are \"large\" and thus \"close\" to $\\infty$. Here, $e_2, e_3, e_4$ (with $v_2=-1<0$) cluster with $\\infty$.\n\nThis suggests the set of branch points $B$ is partitioned into two sets:\n- $B_1 = \\{0, e_1\\}$\n- $B_2 = \\{e_2, e_3, e_4, \\infty\\}$\n\nEach partition corresponds to an irreducible component of the stable reduction. Let these components be $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nThe geometric genus of the component is determined by the number of branch points in the corresponding cluster. Let $n_i = |B_i|$. The genus is $g_i = \\lfloor (n_i-1)/2 \\rfloor$.\n- For $C_1$: $n_1 = |B_1| = 2$. The genus is $g_1 = \\lfloor (2-1)/2 \\rfloor = 0$. So, $C_1$ is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n- For $C_2$: $n_2 = |B_2| = 4$. The genus is $g_2 = \\lfloor (4-1)/2 \\rfloor = 1$. So, $C_2$ is an elliptic curve.\n\nThe stable reduction $\\bar{C}$ is the union of these two components, $\\bar{C} = C_1 \\cup C_2$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Number of Double Points**\n\nThe original curve is connected, so its stable reduction must also be a connected curve. This means the components $C_1$ and $C_2$ must intersect. The intersection points are the double points (nodes) of the stable reduction.\n\nWe use the formula for the arithmetic genus of a reducible curve:\n$p_a(\\bar{C}) = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 1$\nwhere $g_1$ and $g_2$ are the geometric genera of the components, and $\\delta$ is the number of intersection points between them (assuming they intersect transversally at nodes).\n\nThe arithmetic genus of the stable reduction is equal to the genus of the original curve, which is $g=2$.\nWe have $g_1 = 0$ and $g_2 = 1$.\nSo, the formula becomes:\n$2 = 0 + 1 + \\delta - 1$\n$2 = \\delta$\n\nThis implies there are $\\delta=2$ intersection points between the rational curve component and the elliptic curve component. These intersection points are the ordinary double points of the stable reduction.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has two double points."
