    "Answering the question requires a step-by-step analysis of the group structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group of size 128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $128=2^7$ is denoted as $Q_{128}$. Its structure is defined by the presentation:\n$G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nThe key properties of this group are:\n*   Its order is 128.\n*   The elements of $G$ can be written uniquely in the form $x^i$ or $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i \\le 63$.\n*   It contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 64, which is $\\langle x \\rangle$. This subgroup is maximal in $G$.\n*   The order of element $x$ is 64.\n*   For any element not in $\\langle x \\rangle$, say $g = x^i y$, its order is 4. This is because $(x^i y)^2 = x^i y x^i y = x^i (y x^i) y = x^i (x^{-i} y) y = y^2 = x^{32}$, and $(x^i y)^4 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the definition of a Power Subgroup**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a **power subgroup** if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is equal to the set of the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$. This set is denoted by $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. It's important to note that the set $G^k$ is not always a subgroup, but we are asked to count how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the set of powers $G^k$ for different $k$**\n\nWe need to compute the set $G^k$ and check if it's a subgroup. The calculation depends on whether $k$ is odd or even.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is an odd integer**\n\nLet $k = 2m+1$ for some integer $m$.\n*   For elements of the form $g=x^i$ (i.e., elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$):\n    The $k$-th power is $g^k = (x^i)^k = x^{ik}$. Since $k$ is odd, it is coprime to the order of $x$ (which is $64=2^6$). Therefore, as $i$ runs from 0 to 63, the product $ik \\pmod{64}$ also takes all values from 0 to 63. This means the set of $k$-th powers of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $\\langle x \\rangle$ itself.\n*   For elements of the form $g=x^i y$:\n    We use the fact that $g^2=x^{32}$. The $k$-th power is $g^k = g^{2m+1} = (g^2)^m \\cdot g = (x^{32})^m (x^i y) = x^{32m+i}y$.\n    The set of these powers is $\\{x^{32m+i}y \\mid 0 \\le i < 63\\}$. As $i$ runs through all values from 0 to 63, the exponent $32m+i \\pmod{64}$ also runs through all values from 0 to 63. So this set is $\\{x^j y \\mid 0 \\le j < 63\\}$, which is the coset $\\langle x \\rangle y$.\n*   Combining these results, for any odd $k$, $G^k = \\langle x \\rangle \\cup \\langle x \\rangle y = G$. Since $G$ is a group, it is a power subgroup. This gives us **one** power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is an even integer**\n\nLet $k = 2m$ for some integer $m$.\n*   For elements of the form $g=x^i$:\n    The $k$-th power is $g^k = (x^i)^k = x^{ik} = x^{2mi}$. The set of all such powers, for $i=0, \\dots, 63$, forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^{2m} \\rangle$. Using properties of cyclic groups, this subgroup is identical to $\\langle x^{\\gcd(2m, 64)} \\rangle$.\n*   For elements of the form $g=x^i y$:\n    The $k$-th power is $g^k = g^{2m} = (g^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$. This result is the same for all elements outside of $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   Combining these results, for any even $k=2m$, the set of powers is $G^k = \\langle x^{2m} \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{32m}\\}$.\n    For this set to be a subgroup, it must be closed. This is true if and only if the single element $x^{32m}$ is already contained in the subgroup $\\langle x^{2m} \\rangle$. The element $x^{32m}$ is in $\\langle x^{\\gcd(2m, 64)} \\rangle$ if and only if $32m$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(2m, 64)$. This condition holds for all integers $m$.\n    Therefore, for any even $k$, $G^k$ is a subgroup equal to $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the distinct subgroups generated**\n\nFrom the analysis above, the power subgroups of $G=Q_{128}$ are:\n1.  The group $G$ itself (from any odd $k$).\n2.  The subgroups of the form $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$ where $k$ is an even integer.\n\nLet $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ where $k$ is even. This means $d$ must be an even divisor of 64.\n*   The divisors of 64 are: $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n*   The even divisors of 64 are: $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n\nFor each of these even divisors $d$, we can find an even integer $k$ (for instance $k=d$) such that $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$. Each of these values for $d$ generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of $\\langle x \\rangle$:\n*   $d=2$: gives the subgroup $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ of order 32.\n*   $d=4$: gives the subgroup $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ of order 16.\n*   $d=8$: gives the subgroup $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ of order 8.\n*   $d=16$: gives the subgroup $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ of order 4.\n*   $d=32$: gives the subgroup $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ of order 2.\n*   $d=64$: gives the subgroup $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$, the trivial subgroup, of order 1.\n\nThis gives us **six** distinct subgroups. These are all proper subgroups of $G$ and are contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\n\nThe set of all power subgroups of $Q_{128}$ is:\n$\\{Q_{128}, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}\\}$.\n\nThese are all distinct subgroups. Counting them, we find there are $1 + 6 = 7$ power subgroups.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{7}$.\n<<<7>>>"
