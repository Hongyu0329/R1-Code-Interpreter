    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\nThe core of the question is to identify two specific individuals who meet the following criteria:\n*   They are Nobel laureates.\n*   They appeared in an Enron commercial.\n*   The commercial was part of a campaign in the year 2000.\n*   The campaign's tagline was \"Ask Why.\"\n*   The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" which alludes to the dramatic and fraudulent collapse of Enron a year later, making the campaign's message deeply ironic.\n\n**2. Identify the Advertising Campaign:**\nEnron ran a high-profile corporate image advertising campaign in 2000 with the tagline \"Ask Why.\" The campaign was designed to portray Enron not just as an energy company, but as a revolutionary company of ideas that challenged established business models. The commercials featured various thought leaders and business figures.\n\n**3. Identify the Featured Individuals and Verify their Nobel Status:**\nWe need to find two people from these commercials who are also Nobel Prize winners. Researching the participants of the \"Ask Why\" campaign reveals two prominent economists were featured:\n\n*   **Individual 1: Paul Krugman.** A well-known economist and public intellectual. He was featured in one of the commercials.\n*   **Individual 2: Myron Scholes.** An economist famous for the Black-Scholes options pricing model. He was also featured in a commercial for the same campaign.\n\n**4. List Careful Points and Nuances:**\n*   **Timing of the Nobel Prizes:** This is a crucial detail.\n    *   **Myron Scholes** received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1997**, three years *before* the Enron commercial aired. Therefore, at the time of the commercial, he was already a Nobel laureate.\n    *   **Paul Krugman** received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008**, eight years *after* the commercial aired. So, at the time of filming, he was a prominent MIT economist but not yet a Nobel laureate. The question asks \"Which two Nobel laureates were featured,\" which is correctly answered by naming people who now hold the title, even if one did not at the exact moment the commercial was filmed.\n\n*   **The \"Infamous\" Nature of the Commercials:** The irony is multi-layered.\n    *   Enron, a company built on complex and fraudulent accounting, was encouraging the public to \"Ask Why\" and embrace transparency and new ideas.\n    *   Myron Scholes was not only a Nobel laureate but also a partner at Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund that had spectacularly collapsed in 1998 due to extreme leverage and complex financial models. His appearance in a 2000 commercial for another company that would soon collapse due to financial complexity is a stark historical irony.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals who are Nobel laureates and were featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign are Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
