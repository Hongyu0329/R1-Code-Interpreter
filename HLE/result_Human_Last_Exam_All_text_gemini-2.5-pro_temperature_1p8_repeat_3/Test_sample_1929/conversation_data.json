    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene, CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂). This is a classic conjugated diene.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂). This is an alkene, which can act as a dienophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a [4+2] cycloaddition, commonly known as the **Diels-Alder reaction**. This reaction forms a new six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Mechanism and Connectivity of the Product**\n*   In a Diels-Alder reaction, the four π-electrons of the diene and the two π-electrons of the dienophile reorganize in a single, concerted step to form a cyclohexene ring system.\n*   Let's number the carbon atoms of the reactants to trace where they end up in the product:\n    *   Diene (1,3-butadiene): C¹H₂=C²H−C³H=C⁴H₂\n    *   Dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene): C⁵Cl₂=C⁶F₂\n*   The reaction mechanism involves breaking three π-bonds (C¹=C², C³=C⁴, and C⁵=C⁶) and forming two new σ-bonds and one new π-bond.\n    *   A new sigma (σ) bond forms between C¹ of the diene and one carbon of the dienophile (e.g., C⁶).\n    *   A new sigma (σ) bond forms between C⁴ of the diene and the other carbon of the dienophile (C⁵).\n    *   A new pi (π) bond forms between C² and C³ of the original diene.\n*   This forms a six-membered ring with the connectivity: -C¹-C²=C³-C⁴-C⁵-C⁶- and back to C¹.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\n*   Following the connectivity from Step 2, we can assemble the product structure.\n    *   The backbone of the product is a cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The new double bond is between carbons C² and C³.\n    *   The substituents from the dienophile are located on the adjacent carbons C⁵ and C⁶.\n    *   Carbon C⁵ has two chlorine (Cl) atoms attached.\n    *   Carbon C⁶ has two fluorine (F) atoms attached.\n\n    The resulting structure is a cyclohexene ring with a -CCl₂- group and a -CF₂- group on adjacent carbons. A schematic representation would look like this:\n    ```\n           CH=CH\n          /     \\\n        CH₂       CH₂\n         |         |\n       CF₂  ---  CCl₂\n    ```\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Regiochemistry:** The diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetric. The dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) is unsymmetric. However, because the diene is symmetric, there is only one possible constitutional isomer formed. Whether the CCl₂ group adds next to C¹ or C⁴ of the butadiene results in the same molecule after flipping and rotation.\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained. Since the dienophile has geminal (on the same carbon) substituents, there are no cis/trans isomers to consider for the dienophile itself, and the resulting product has no stereocenters.\n3.  **IUPAC Nomenclature:** This is the final step to accurately name the product.\n    *   The parent ring is **cyclohexene**.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the carbons of the double bond must be numbered C1 and C2.\n    *   We then number the rest of the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers).\n    *   **Numbering option A:** If we number so that the CCl₂ group is on C4 and the CF₂ group is on C5, the locants are {4,4,5,5}. The substituents are 4,4-dichloro and 5,5-difluoro.\n    *   **Numbering option B:** If we number in the opposite direction, the CF₂ group is on C4 and the CCl₂ group is on C5, giving locants {4,4,5,5}. The substituents are 4,4-difluoro and 5,5-dichloro.\n    *   **Tie-breaker rule:** When two different numbering schemes produce the same set of locants, we assign the lower number to the substituent group that comes first alphabetically. \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\".\n    *   Therefore, we must use the numbering scheme that assigns the lower number (4) to the chloro groups. This corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\nThe name is built by putting the substituent names in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants, followed by the parent name.\n*   Substituents (alphabetical): dichloro, difluoro\n*   Locants: 4,4-dichloro, 5,5-difluoro\n*   Parent name: cyclohexene\n*   Combining these gives the final name: **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
