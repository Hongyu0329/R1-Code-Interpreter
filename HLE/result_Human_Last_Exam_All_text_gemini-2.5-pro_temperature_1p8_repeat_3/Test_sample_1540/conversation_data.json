    "An analysis of the problem to find the most memory-efficient C program solution and the total memory used for its variables.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The main objective is to compare two strings lexicographically, treating uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent. We must then determine if the first string is less than, greater than, or equal to the second string and output -1, 1, or 0 accordingly. The secondary and most critical goal is to achieve this using the minimum possible memory for variables, and to quantify this memory usage in bytes.\n\n2.  **Core Logic - Case-Insensitive Comparison:**\n    *   The comparison proceeds character by character from the beginning of the strings.\n    *   For each pair of characters at a given position, we must ignore their case. A standard method is to convert both characters to a common case (e.g., lowercase using `tolower()`) before comparing them.\n    *   The comparison result is determined by the first position where the characters differ.\n    *   If all characters are the same (after ignoring case), the strings are considered equal.\n\n3.  **Strategy for Memory Efficiency:**\n    *   To compare the two strings, we must have access to both simultaneously. However, standard input is a forward-only stream. Once a character is read, it's consumed. This implies that we cannot read a character from the first string, then one from the second, then the next from the first, and so on without buffering.\n    *   A memory-efficient approach is to read and store the entire first string in a buffer. Then, we can read the second string one character at a time and compare it with the corresponding character in our buffer. This avoids the need to allocate a second large buffer for the second string.\n\n### Listing Careful Points\n\n*   **String Buffer Size:** The problem states the maximum string length is 100. In C, strings are null-terminated, so to store a string of 100 characters, we need an array of size `100 + 1 = 101`. The variable would be `char s1[101];`.\n*   **Input Method `getchar()`:** When reading the second string character-by-character, `getchar()` is a suitable function. Its return type is `int`, not `char`. This is crucial because it needs to represent every possible character value *and* a special non-character value, `EOF` (End of File). The variable holding its return value must therefore be an `int`.\n*   **Data Types for Variables:** To minimize memory, we must choose the smallest possible data type for each variable.\n    *   For the loop index, which will range from 0 to at most 99, an `unsigned char` (range 0-255, size 1 byte) is sufficient and more memory-efficient than a standard `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n    *   As established, the variable for `getchar()` must be an `int` (4 bytes).\n    *   The buffer for the first string must be `char[101]` (101 bytes).\n*   **Handling `scanf`'s Leftover Newline:** After reading the first string with `scanf(\"%s\", ...);`, a newline character (`\\n`) remains in the input buffer. This must be consumed (e.g., with a call to `getchar();`) before starting the character-by-character read of the second string to avoid reading the newline as the first character of the second string.\n*   **No Unnecessary Variables:** The solution should not declare temporary variables if the same result can be achieved without them. For example, the results of `tolower()` calls can be used directly in comparison expressions rather than being stored in intermediate `char` variables.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nFollowing the most memory-efficient strategy, we will declare only the essential variables with their smallest appropriate types.\n\n1.  **First String Buffer:** A character array to store the first string.\n    *   Declaration: `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory Used: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Loop Index:** A variable to iterate through the string.\n    *   Declaration: `unsigned char i;`\n    *   Memory Used: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Second String Character:** A variable to hold the character read from the second string via `getchar()`.\n    *   Declaration: `int c2;`\n    *   Memory Used: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes** (based on standard competitive programming environments).\n\nNo other variables are strictly necessary for a correct implementation.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation (m):**\nm = (Memory for s1) + (Memory for i) + (Memory for c2)\nm = 101 + 1 + 4\nm = 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
