    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    We are given a triangle $A B C$ with the following properties:\n    *   Side $BC = S$, where $S = SNYWR$.\n    *   Angle $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$.\n    *   We need to find the number of integer values for the length of side $AC$ for which there are exactly two possible lengths for side $AB$.\n\n2.  **Interpret the value of S:**\n    The term $S=S N Y W R$ is a common type of puzzle notation in mathematics competitions. It implies that $S$ is the sum of the numerical values of the letters, where A=1, B=2, C=3, and so on.\n    *   S is the 19th letter of the alphabet.\n    *   N is the 14th letter.\n    *   Y is the 25th letter.\n    *   W is the 23rd letter.\n    *   R is the 18th letter.\n    Summing these values: $S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99$.\n    So, we have $BC = 99$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Geometric Condition:**\n    The problem describes the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines (or the Side-Side-Angle case, SSA). We are given an angle ($\\angle B$), the side adjacent to it ($BC$), and the side opposite it ($AC$). We want to find the condition on the side opposite ($AC$) that allows for two possible triangles, which means two possible lengths for the third side ($AB$).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Condition Mathematically:**\n    Let the side lengths be $a = BC$, $b = AC$, and $c = AB$. We are given $a = S = 99$ and $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$. We are looking for the number of integer values of $b$ for which there are two possible values of $c$.\n\n    There are two primary methods to derive the condition for the ambiguous case.\n\n    **Method 1: Using the Law of Sines**\n    The Law of Sines states $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$.\n    Using the given values, we have $\\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{a}{\\sin A}$, which gives:\n    $\\sin A = \\frac{a \\sin B}{b} = \\frac{99 \\sin 30^{\\circ}}{b} = \\frac{99 \\cdot (1/2)}{b} = \\frac{49.5}{b}$.\n\n    For two possible triangles to exist, there must be two possible values for $\\angle A$. This occurs when:\n    *   $0 < \\sin A < 1$. This ensures that there is an acute solution $A_1 = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{49.5}{b}\\right)$ and an obtuse solution $A_2 = 180^{\\circ} - A_1$.\n    The condition $0 < \\frac{49.5}{b} < 1$ implies $b > 49.5$.\n    *   Both potential angles must lead to a valid triangle. A triangle is valid if the sum of its angles is less than $180^{\\circ}$.\n        *   For $A_1$: $A_1 + B < 180^{\\circ}$. Since $A_1$ and $B$ are both acute, this is always true.\n        *   For $A_2$: $A_2 + B < 180^{\\circ}$. This is the critical condition.\n          $(180^{\\circ} - A_1) + B < 180^{\\circ}$\n          $B < A_1$\n          Since $\\sin(x)$ is increasing for acute angles:\n          $\\sin B < \\sin A_1$\n          $\\sin 30^{\\circ} < \\frac{49.5}{b}$\n          $\\frac{1}{2} < \\frac{49.5}{b}$\n          $b < 2 \\cdot 49.5$\n          $b < 99$.\n\n    Combining the two conditions, we get $49.5 < b < 99$.\n\n    **Method 2: Using the Law of Cosines**\n    We can write the Law of Cosines for side $b$:\n    $b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \\cos B$\n    Substituting the known values:\n    $b^2 = 99^2 + c^2 - 2(99)c \\cos 30^{\\circ}$\n    $b^2 = 99^2 + c^2 - 198c \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n    Rearranging this into a quadratic equation for $c$ (the length of side $AB$):\n    $c^2 - (99\\sqrt{3})c + (99^2 - b^2) = 0$\n\n    For there to be two possible values for $c$, this quadratic equation must have two distinct positive real roots.\n    1.  **Distinct roots:** The discriminant must be greater than zero.\n        $D = (-99\\sqrt{3})^2 - 4(1)(99^2 - b^2) > 0$\n        $99^2 \\cdot 3 - 4 \\cdot 99^2 + 4b^2 > 0$\n        $-99^2 + 4b^2 > 0$\n        $4b^2 > 99^2 \\implies 2b > 99 \\implies b > 49.5$.\n    2.  **Positive roots:** The sum of the roots and the product of the roots must be positive.\n        *   Sum of roots: $c_1 + c_2 = 99\\sqrt{3}$. This is positive, so at least one root is positive.\n        *   Product of roots: $c_1 c_2 = 99^2 - b^2$. For both roots to be positive, their product must be positive.\n          $99^2 - b^2 > 0 \\implies 99^2 > b^2 \\implies b < 99$ (since b must be positive).\n\n    Combining these conditions gives the same inequality: $49.5 < b < 99$.\n\n5.  **Count the Integer Values:**\n    The length of side $AC$ is $b$. We need to find the number of integers $b$ that satisfy the inequality $49.5 < b < 99$.\n    The smallest integer value for $b$ is 50.\n    The largest integer value for $b$ is 98.\n    The number of integers in this range is:\n    Number of values = (Last Value) - (First Value) + 1\n    Number of values = $98 - 50 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The interpretation of `SNYWR` is crucial. The sum-of-letters-value is a standard convention for this type of problem phrasing.\n*   The conditions for the ambiguous SSA case must be correctly applied. I verified the condition $S/2 < AC < S$ using both the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines, confirming its correctness.\n*   The angle $B=30^\\circ$ is acute. The condition for an ambiguous case is different if the angle is obtuse (in which case there can be at most one solution).\n*   The counting of integers must be precise (using `Last - First + 1`).\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n*   Given $BC=S=99$ and $\\angle B = 30^\\circ$.\n*   For two possible triangles, the length of side $AC$ must satisfy $S/2 < AC < S$.\n*   This translates to $99/2 < AC < 99$, or $49.5 < AC < 99$.\n*   The integer values for $AC$ are $50, 51, \\ldots, 98$.\n*   The count is $98 - 50 + 1 = 49$.\n\n<<<49>>>"
