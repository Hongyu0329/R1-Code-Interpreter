    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific scientific paper:** The question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. Its German title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This was one of his four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers.\n\n2.  **Understand the term \"cite\":** In a scientific context, a \"citation\" is a reference to a source of information. In 1905, this was often done through footnotes rather than a formal bibliography at the end of the paper, which is common today. The question asks specifically about citations to \"lectures.\"\n\n3.  **Examine the direct citations within the paper:** Einstein's 1905 Brownian motion paper is notable for having very few citations.\n    *   He mentions Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff's analogy between dilute solutions and ideal gases.\n    *   He uses a value for the viscosity of a sugar solution from a textbook, \"Lehrbuch der Allgemeinen Chemie\" (\"Textbook of General Chemistry\") by Wilhelm Ostwald.\n    *   Neither of these references is to a series of \"lectures.\"\n\n4.  **Analyze the intellectual foundation of the paper:** Einstein's work on Brownian motion is a direct application of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat. To formulate his theory, Einstein relied on the principles established by his predecessors in this field.\n\n5.  **Identify the key influential figure and their work:** While Einstein was famously independent and often developed his ideas in isolation, he was a devoted student of the work of Ludwig Boltzmann, a pioneer of statistical mechanics. Einstein's understanding of the subject was profoundly shaped by studying Boltzmann's writings.\n\n6.  **Connect the influence to the term \"lectures\":** The specific major work by Boltzmann that Einstein studied was his book titled ***Vorlesungen über Gastheorie***. This German title translates directly to ***Lectures on Gas Theory***. Although this is a book, it is a published compilation of Boltzmann's lectures on the topic.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** While Einstein did not include a formal footnote in his 1905 paper saying \"as shown in the lectures of Boltzmann,\" his work is built upon the very principles detailed in Boltzmann's work, which was explicitly titled *Lectures on Gas Theory*. Therefore, when considering the source of the foundational knowledge Einstein used and implicitly \"cited\" through his methodology, Ludwig Boltzmann's lectures are the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Direct vs. Indirect Citation:** The question uses the word \"cite,\" which can be ambiguous. There is no *direct, formal citation* to lectures in the paper's footnotes. However, the intellectual framework is undeniably taken from a work titled \"Lectures.\" The question is best answered by identifying this primary source of knowledge.\n*   **\"Lectures\" as a Book Title:** The key is recognizing that Boltzmann's influential work was a book whose title was *Lectures on Gas Theory*. This aligns perfectly with the wording of the question.\n*   **Self-Taught Knowledge:** It is important to remember that Einstein did not attend Boltzmann's lectures in person. He learned the material by reading Boltzmann's published work on his own.\n\nBy synthesizing these points, we can confidently identify the individual whose \"lectures\" (in the form of a foundational published text) were essential to Einstein's paper.\n\n***\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
