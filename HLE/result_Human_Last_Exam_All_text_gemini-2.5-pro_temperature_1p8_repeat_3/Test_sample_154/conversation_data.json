    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we can analyze the problem by breaking it down.\n\n**1. Definitions**\n*   **Simple graph:** A graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a set of 5 vertices, V. Let n = |V| = 5.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting graph structures, so graphs that can be rearranged to look the same are counted only once.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (biconnected):** A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it is connected and remains connected after removing any single vertex. This implies that the graph has no cut-vertices (or articulation points). A key property of such graphs is that the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2.\n\n**2. Step-by-step analysis by number of edges**\n\nThe number of vertices is n=5. For a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, its minimum degree δ(G) must be at least 2.\nThe sum of degrees is 2m, where m is the number of edges.\nSum of degrees = Σ deg(v) >= n * δ(G) = 5 * 2 = 10.\nSince 2m >= 10, the number of edges m must be at least 5.\nThe maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is the complete graph K5, which has C(5,2) = 10 edges.\nSo, we need to count the nonisomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with m edges, where m is between 5 and 10.\n\n**Case m = 5:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 2*5 = 10. With δ(G) >= 2, the only possible degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n*   The only connected 2-regular graph on 5 vertices is the cycle graph, **C5**.\n*   Is C5 2-vertex-connected? Yes, removing any single vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n*   Number of graphs for m=5: **1**.\n\n**Case m = 6:**\n*   We need to find all connected nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges and check for 2-vertex-connectivity. There are 6 such connected graphs.\n    1.  **C5 with one chord:** This graph is formed by adding an edge between two non-adjacent vertices of C5. Since all vertices in C5 are equivalent, there is only one way to do this up to isomorphism. Adding an edge to a 2-connected graph preserves 2-connectivity. So, this graph is 2-connected.\n    2.  **C4 with a vertex attached to two opposite vertices:** Let the C4 vertices be 1-2-3-4-1. A new vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1 and 3. Let's check for cut vertices. Removing any vertex does not disconnect the graph. For instance, removing vertex 1 leaves vertices {2,3,4,5} with edges (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), forming a star-like structure centered at 3, which is connected. This graph is 2-connected. It is not isomorphic to the C5+chord because it does not contain a 5-cycle.\n*   The other 4 connected graphs with 6 edges have cut vertices (e.g., the butterfly graph, which consists of two triangles sharing a single vertex).\n*   Number of graphs for m=6: **2**.\n\n**Case m = 7:**\n*   This is the most complex case. There are 8 connected nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 7 edges. We must identify which ones are 2-connected. By careful case-by-case analysis (e.g., by building from smaller graphs or analyzing complements), we find there are 5 such graphs.\n    1.  The **Fan graph F4 (or K1 + P4)**: One central vertex connected to all vertices of a path P4. It is 2-connected.\n    2.  **C5 with two non-overlapping chords:** For example, on C5 (1-2-3-4-5-1), add edges (1,3) and (2,4). This graph is 2-connected.\n    3.  The graph obtained by adding an edge between two degree-2 vertices of the \"house graph\" (C5+chord). This can be constructed as a butterfly graph with an extra edge connecting vertices from the two different \"wings\". This is 2-connected.\n    4.  The complement of the graph P4 U K1 (a path on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex). This graph is 2-connected and is distinct from the others.\n    5.  The complement of the graph C3 U K2 (a triangle and an edge). This graph is also 2-connected and distinct.\n*   The remaining 3 connected graphs for m=7 have cut-vertices.\n*   Number of graphs for m=7: **5**.\n\n**Case m = 8:**\n*   We analyze the complements, which are graphs with n=5 and m' = 10-8 = 2 edges.\n*   There are two nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 2 edges:\n    a) Two edges sharing a vertex (P3 U 2K1).\n    b) Two disjoint edges (K2 U K2 U K1).\n*   The complement of (a) is 2-connected.\n*   The complement of (b) is the **Wheel graph W5 (K1 + C4)**. This graph is also 2-connected and non-isomorphic to the first one.\n*   Number of graphs for m=8: **2**.\n\n**Case m = 9:**\n*   The complement has m' = 10-9 = 1 edge. There is only one such graph (K2 U 3K1).\n*   Its complement is the **complete graph minus one edge, K5-e**.\n*   The complete graph K5 is 4-connected. Removing an edge reduces connectivity by at most 1, so K5-e is at least 3-connected, and therefore 2-connected.\n*   Number of graphs for m=9: **1**.\n\n**Case m = 10:**\n*   The only graph is the **complete graph K5**.\n*   K5 is 4-connected, so it is 2-connected.\n*   Number of graphs for m=10: **1**.\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming the counts for each number of edges:\n*   m=5: 1\n*   m=6: 2\n*   m=7: 5\n*   m=8: 2\n*   m=9: 1\n*   m=10: 1\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 12.\n\nThere are 12 simple nonisomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n<<<12>>>"
