    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the specific US city to which the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n2.  **Identify the key entities:**\n    *   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (1997)\n    *   **Character:** Tommaso\n    *   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n    *   **Action:** Moves to the United States.\n3.  **Analyze the character's role in the plot:** Tommaso is the protagonist Piero's best friend. He comes from a wealthy, intellectual family, which contrasts with Piero's working-class background. Tommaso is portrayed as adventurous and eager to escape their provincial hometown of Livorno.\n4.  **Locate the specific plot point:** In the film's narrative, after finishing their schooling, the paths of Piero and Tommaso diverge significantly. While Piero remains in Livorno, Tommaso follows his dream of living abroad.\n5.  **Determine the destination:** The film establishes that Tommaso moves to the United States. The specific city is shown to be **New York City**. This is often communicated to the audience and to Piero through postcards Tommaso sends back, detailing his exciting new life in the metropolis. This serves as a narrative device to highlight the contrast between the two friends' lives.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   Ensure the character is correctly identified (Tommaso, not the protagonist Piero).\n*   Verify the movie title and year (*Ovosodo*, 1997).\n*   The city is not just mentioned in passing; Tommaso's move to New York is a significant element that underscores the film's themes of class, ambition, and friendship.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBased on the plot of the movie *Ovosodo*, the character Tommaso moves to New York City after leaving Italy.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
