    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    *   The starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n    *   Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n        *   \"Benzamide\" indicates a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl-amide group (-CONH₂).\n        *   \"N,N-diethyl\" means two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide, making the group -C(=O)N(Et)₂.\n        *   \"3-dimethylamino\" means a dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is at position 3 of the benzene ring.\n    *   The structure can be drawn by placing the amide group at position 1 and the dimethylamino group at position 3 of the benzene ring.\n\n    Structure of the starting material:\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n        C — N(CH₂CH₃)₂\n       /\n    (C1)\n    /  \\\n (C6)  (C2)\n  |     |\n (C5)  (C3) — N(CH₃)₂\n    \\  /\n    (C4)\n    ```\n    The available protons on the aromatic ring for deprotonation are at positions C2, C4, C5, and C6.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Type (First Step):**\n    *   **Reagents:** `sec-BuLi` (sec-Butyllithium), `TMEDA` (N,N,N',N'-Tetramethylethylenediamine), and `THF` (Tetrahydrofuran).\n    *   `sec-BuLi` is a very strong base.\n    *   `TMEDA` is a chelating agent that complexes with the lithium ion (Li⁺), enhancing the basicity of the butyl anion and helping to direct the reaction.\n    *   This combination of reagents is characteristic of a **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In this reaction, a strong base deprotonates (removes a proton from) a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to a \"directing group\" on the aromatic ring. The directing group coordinates with the lithium ion, bringing the base close to the ortho C-H bond and making it more acidic.\n\n3.  **Identify Directing Groups and Determine the Site of Deprotonation:**\n    *   Our molecule has two directing groups:\n        1.  The **amide group** (`-C(=O)N(Et)₂`) at C1. This is a very powerful directing group.\n        2.  The **dimethylamino group** (`-N(CH₃)₂`) at C3. This is also a good directing group, but weaker than the amide.\n    *   The directing ability of the amide group is significantly stronger than the dimethylamino group. Therefore, the deprotonation will occur at a position *ortho* to the amide group. The positions ortho to C1 are **C2** and **C6**.\n    *   Now we must decide between C2 and C6. We need to consider the effect of the second directing group at C3.\n        *   **Position C2:** This position is *ortho* to the powerful amide director (at C1) and also *ortho* to the dimethylamino director (at C3). The two groups work together (synergistically) to make the proton at C2 the most acidic proton on the ring. The resulting lithiated intermediate is stabilized by chelation of the lithium ion with both the amide oxygen and the amino nitrogen.\n        *   **Position C6:** This position is *ortho* to the amide director (at C1) but *para* to the dimethylamino group. It is activated by the amide but not by the amine group in the same cooperative way as C2.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation will selectively and overwhelmingly occur at the **C2 position**. A lithium atom will replace the hydrogen atom at C2, forming an aryllithium intermediate.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Step (Reaction with Electrophile):**\n    *   The reagent added in the second step is **methyl iodide (CH₃I)**.\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step has a nucleophilic carbon at position C2 (effectively a carbanion).\n    *   Methyl iodide is an electrophile. The nucleophilic C2-Li will attack the electrophilic methyl group of CH₃I in an Sₙ2-type reaction, displacing the iodide ion (I⁻).\n    *   This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond, attaching a methyl group (-CH₃) to the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   Starting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, the reaction sequence introduces a methyl group at the C2 position.\n    *   The name of the final product is derived by adding \"2-methyl\" to the name of the starting material. When alphabetizing the substituents, \"diethyl\" comes before \"dimethylamino\", which comes before \"methyl\".\n    *   Final Product Name: **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\n### Summary of Transformation:\nStarting Material -> Deprotonation at C2 -> Reaction with CH₃I -> Final Product\n\n```\n [N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide]\n              |\n              | 1. sec-BuLi, TMEDA, THF (Deprotonation at C2)\n              V\n[2-Lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide intermediate]\n              |\n              | 2.
