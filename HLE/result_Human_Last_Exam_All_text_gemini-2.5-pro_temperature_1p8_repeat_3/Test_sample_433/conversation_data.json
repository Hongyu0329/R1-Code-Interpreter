    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the Beyond-Use Date (BUD).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Terms in the Question:**\n    *   **BUD (Beyond-Use Date):** This is the date and time after which a sterile compounded preparation must not be stored or used. It is determined from the moment a container is opened or a preparation is compounded.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container (SDC):** A container, such as a vial or an ampule, intended for parenteral administration for use in a single patient as a single injection/infusion. SDCs typically lack antimicrobial preservatives.\n    *   **Ampule:** A specific type of SDC made of glass. It is a sealed container that must be broken at the neck to be opened.\n    *   **Puncture:** For an ampule, this means breaking it open.\n    *   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or a biological safety cabinet (BSC), which provides a highly controlled environment to minimize contamination.\n\n2.  **Consult the Authoritative Standard:**\n    The primary guideline for sterile compounding and determining BUDs in the United States is the **United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>**, \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations.\" All analysis should be based on the rules set forth in this chapter.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specific Container Type (Ampule):**\n    The most critical point in this question is that the container is an **ampule**. An ampule is fundamentally different from a vial.\n    *   A vial has a rubber stopper that can be punctured by a needle. After the needle is withdrawn, the stopper provides some level of resealing.\n    *   An **ampule**, once broken, is an **open system**. It is completely open to the environment and cannot be resealed. This presents a much higher and more immediate risk of microbial and particulate contamination compared to a vial.\n\n4.  **Apply the USP <797> Rule for Ampules:**\n    Because an opened ampule is an open system with a high risk of contamination, USP <797> has a very strict rule for its use:\n    *   Once an ampule is opened, the contents must be used **immediately**.\n    *   There is no provision for storing an opened ampule for any length of time, even within the pristine conditions of an ISO Class 5 sterile environment.\n    *   Any unused contents from an opened ampule must be discarded immediately after use and cannot be saved for later.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Distinction between Ampules and Vials:** Do not confuse the rule for ampules with the rule for single-dose *vials*. A single-dose vial, when punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment, can be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial puncture. This is because its rubber stopper offers a limited barrier against contamination. This 12-hour rule **does not** apply to ampules.\n*   **Meaning of \"Immediate Use\":** In the context of USP <797>, \"immediately\" means that the withdrawal of the drug and its subsequent use in compounding or administration should be part of one continuous process without interruption or storage.\n*   **Environment Does Not Extend Ampule BUD:** While the sterile environment is crucial for reducing contamination during handling, it does not change the fundamental nature of an opened ampule as an open system. Therefore, the ISO Class 5 environment does not grant any extension to its BUD.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the official standards in USP <797>, an ampule is considered an open-system container once it is broken. Due to the high risk of contamination, it cannot be stored. Therefore, the contents must be used immediately, and any remaining portion must be discarded.\n\n<<<An opened single-dose ampule must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded. It cannot be stored for any period of time, regardless of the environment.>>>"
