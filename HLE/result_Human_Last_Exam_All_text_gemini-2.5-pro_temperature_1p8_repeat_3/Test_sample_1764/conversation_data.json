    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ in a Banach space $B$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space $X$**: A finite set $X$ with a metric $d$ that satisfies the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\leq \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$. We assume $|X| \\geq 2$ since a 1-point space is trivial.\n*   **Banach Space $B$**: A complete normed vector space. The problem states it has cardinality $K$, which suggests we might need to consider spaces beyond those over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding**: A function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x, y \\in X$, the equality $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d(x, y)$ holds. An isometric embedding must be injective.\n\n**Step 2: Establish a lower bound on the number of embeddings**\nLet's analyze the consequences of the symmetries of the space $X$. The set of all isometries of $X$ (bijections from $X$ to itself that preserve distances) forms a group, denoted $\\text{Isom}(X)$.\n\n*   **Key Theorem**: For any finite ultrametric space $X$ with $|X| \\geq 2$, the isometry group $\\text{Isom}(X)$ is non-trivial. In fact, its order is always an even number. So, there are at least two isometries: the identity map ($\\text{id}$) and at least one other isometry $\\sigma \\neq \\text{id}$.\n\n*   **Generating new embeddings**: Let's assume there exists at least one isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$. Let $\\sigma$ be a non-trivial isometry of $X$ (i.e., $\\sigma \\in \\text{Isom}(X)$ and $\\sigma \\neq \\text{id}$).\n    Consider the composite function $g = f \\circ \\sigma$. Let's check if $g$ is also an isometric embedding:\n    $\\|g(x) - g(y)\\|_B = \\|f(\\sigma(x)) - f(\\sigma(y))\\|_B$.\n    Since $f$ is an isometric embedding, this is equal to $d(\\sigma(x), \\sigma(y))$.\n    Since $\\sigma$ is an isometry of $X$, this is equal to $d(x, y)$.\n    So, $g = f \\circ \\sigma$ is also an isometric embedding.\n\n*   **Distinctness of the new embedding**: Is $g$ a different function from $f$? Suppose $g=f$. This means $f(\\sigma(x)) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in X$. Since $f$ is an isometric embedding, it must be injective. Therefore, $f(\\sigma(x))=f(x)$ implies $\\sigma(x)=x$ for all $x \\in X$, which means $\\sigma=\\text{id}$. This contradicts our assumption that $\\sigma$ is a non-trivial isometry.\n    Thus, $f$ and $f \\circ \\sigma$ are distinct functions.\n\n*   **Conclusion for the lower bound**: If a finite ultrametric space $X$ (with $|X|\\geq 2$) can be isometrically embedded into a Banach space $B$, there are at least $|\\text{Isom}(X)|$ embeddings. Since $|\\text{Isom}(X)| \\geq 2$, there must be at least **2** isometric embeddings. This establishes that the smallest possible number is at least 2.\n\n**Step 3: Show that the lower bound can be achieved**\nWe need to find a specific finite ultrametric space $X$ and a specific Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly 2.\n\n*   **Problem with standard Banach spaces**: If we take $B$ to be a standard Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ (like $\\mathbb{R}^n$ or $l_2$), the number of embeddings is infinite. If $f$ is an embedding, then for any vector $b \\in B$, the translated function $f_b(x) = f(x)+b$ is also an embedding. As $B$ is infinite, we get infinitely many embeddings.\n\n*   **Using a finite Banach space**: The problem can be resolved by considering a Banach space over a finite field. The definition of a Banach space can be extended to any complete valued field. A finite field with the trivial valuation ($|a|=1$ for $a\\neq 0$, $|0|=0$) is a complete valued field. Any finite-dimensional vector space over such a field is complete and thus a Banach space. The wording \"cardinality K\" supports this interpretation.\n\n*   **Constructing the example**:\n    1.  **The Space X**: Let's choose the simplest non-trivial ultrametric space. Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$ with the metric $d(x_1, x_2) = 1$. Any two-point metric space is ultrametric.\n    2.  **The Space B**: Let's construct a very simple Banach space.\n        *   Field: Use the finite field with two elements, $\\mathbb{F}_2 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Vector Space: Let $B$ be $\\mathbb{F}_2$ itself, as a one-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Its elements are $0$ and $1$. The cardinality is $K=2$.\n        *   Norm: Define a norm on $B$ by $\\|0\\| = 0$ and $\\|1\\| = 1$. We can verify this is a valid norm:\n            *   $\\|v\\| \\geq 0$, and $\\|v\\|=0 \\iff v=0$. (True)\n            *   $\\|a \\cdot v\\| = |a| \\cdot \\|v\\|$. The only valuation on $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is trivial. For $a=1, \\|1\\cdot v\\|=\\|v\\|=|1|\\|v\\|$. For $a=0, \\|0\\cdot v\\|=\\|0\\|=0=|0|\\|v\\|$. (True)\n            *   $\\|u+v\\| \\leq \\|u\\|+\\|v\\|$. This can be checked for all cases in $\\mathbb{F}_2$. E.g., $\\|1+1\\|=\\|0\\|=0 \\le \\|1\\|+\\|1\\|=2$. (True)\n        *   Completeness: Since $B$ is a finite metric space, it is complete. Thus, $B$ is a Banach space of cardinality 2.\n\n*   **Counting the embeddings for this (X, B) pair**: An isometric embedding is a function $f: \\{x_1, x_2\\} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ such that $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2) = 1$.\n    Let's check the possible functions:\n    *   $f(x_1)=0, f(x_2)=0$: $\\|f(x_1)-f(x_2)\\| = \\|0-0\\| = \\|0\\|=0 \\ne 1$. Not an embedding.\n    *   $f(x_1)=1, f(x_2)=1$: $\\|f(x_1)-f(x_2)\\| = \\|1-1\\| = \\|0\\|=0 \\ne 1$. Not an embedding.\n    *   $f(x_1)=0, f(x_2)=1$: $\\|f(x_1)-f(x_2)\\| = \\|0-1\\| = \\|-1\\| = \\|1\\|=1$. This is an embedding.\n    *   $f(x_1)=1, f(x_2)=0$: $\\|f(x_1)-f(x_2)\\| = \\|1-0\\| = \\|1\\|=1$. This is an embedding.\n\n    There are exactly two such functions.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nWe have shown that for any appropriate pair $(X, B)$, the number of isometric embeddings is at least 2. We have also constructed a valid pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of embeddings is exactly 2. Therefore, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
