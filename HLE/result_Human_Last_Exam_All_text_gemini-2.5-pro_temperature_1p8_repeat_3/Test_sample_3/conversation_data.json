    "Answering this question requires knowledge of the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields, specifically quadratic fields.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the object of study:** We are looking for the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve, denoted $E(K)_{tors}$. This is the set of points of finite order on the curve, which forms a finite abelian group. The base field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. We are interested in subgroups that are \"non-cyclic\" and want to find the \"largest possible order\".\n\n2.  **Recall the structure of torsion subgroups:** For any elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K$, the Mordell-Weil theorem tells us that the group of $K$-rational points $E(K)$ is a finitely generated abelian group. Its torsion part, $E(K)_{tors}$, is a finite abelian group which must be of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$ for integers $n_1, n_2$ with $n_2$ dividing $n_1$. A group of this form is non-cyclic if and only if $n_2 > 1$. The order of this group is $n_1 n_2$.\n\n3.  **Apply classification theorems:** The possible torsion structures for elliptic curves over quadratic fields have been completely classified. This work was done by Kamienny, Kenku, Momose, and completed by Najman. We need to list the possible non-cyclic groups and check their orders.\n\n4.  **List possible non-cyclic torsion groups over quadratic fields:**\n    *   First, any group that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (by Mazur's theorem) can appear over a quadratic field. The non-cyclic ones are $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The largest order among these is $2 \\times 8 = 16$.\n    *   Next, we list the non-cyclic groups that can appear over a quadratic field $K$ but not over $\\mathbb{Q}$. According to the classification theorems, these are:\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 20)\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 24)\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/14\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 28)\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 36)\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9)\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 27)\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16)\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 32)\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 36)\n\n5.  **Identify the largest possible order:** Looking at the orders of all the groups listed above, the maximum order is 36. This order corresponds to two possible group structures: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n6.  **Verify if these groups can occur over the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:**\n    *   The classification results are more specific: they often state which quadratic fields can support which torsion structures.\n    *   For the group $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, an elliptic curve must have all its 6-torsion points defined over the field $K$. This requires the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_6)$ to be a subfield of $K$. We have $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_6) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, so this condition is met. In fact, it is a known result that $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ occurs as a torsion group only over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Such curves have complex multiplication with $j$-invariant $j=0$.\n    *   For the group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$, it is also a known result from the classification that this group occurs as a torsion subgroup over a quadratic field, and the only quadratic field for which this occurs is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Since groups of order 36 are known to exist over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, and the complete classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields shows no possibility of a larger non-cyclic group, the largest possible order is 36.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between what is possible over *any* quadratic field and what is possible over the *specific* field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is special because it is the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$ and also $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_6)$. This allows for certain torsion structures (like containing the full 3-torsion or 6-torsion) that are not possible over most other quadratic fields.\n*   The answer relies on deep classification theorems from the arithmetic of elliptic curves. One does not typically compute this from scratch.\n*   One must correctly identify the full list of possible torsion groups and their orders to find the maximum.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe largest order is 36. This can be realized by curves with torsion subgroup isomorphic to either $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, both of which are known to occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
