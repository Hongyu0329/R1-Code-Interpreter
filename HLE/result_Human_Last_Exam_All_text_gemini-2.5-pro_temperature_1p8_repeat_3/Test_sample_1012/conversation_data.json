    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Threat Model:** The question specifies a threat from an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer\". This is a theoretical machine that can execute quantum algorithms perfectly and efficiently. The most relevant quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric key cryptography is Grover's algorithm.\n\n2.  **Classical Security:** In classical computing, the strength of a symmetric key cipher is measured by its key length, *n*. A brute-force attack requires, on average, 2^(n-1) attempts and in the worst case 2^n attempts to find the correct key. This is referred to as an *n-bit* security level. For example, AES-128 has a 128-bit key and is considered to have a 128-bit security level against classical attacks. A security level of 128 bits is currently considered secure for the foreseeable future.\n\n3.  **Quantum Attack using Grover's Algorithm:** Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that can find a specific item in an unsorted database of N items much faster than a classical computer. Specifically, it can find the item in approximately √N (square root of N) steps, whereas a classical computer would take about N/2 steps.\n\n4.  **Impact on Symmetric Keys:** For a symmetric key of length *n*, there are N = 2^n possible keys. A quantum computer running Grover's algorithm can search through all these keys and find the correct one in about √(2^n) = 2^(n/2) steps. This means that a quantum computer effectively halves the security level of a symmetric key.\n    *   For a 128-bit key, the quantum security level is 128 / 2 = 64 bits.\n    *   For a 256-bit key, the quantum security level is 256 / 2 = 128 bits.\n\n5.  **Determine the Required Security Level:** To be considered \"secure,\" a cryptographic system should resist attack for a sufficiently long time. The industry and cryptographic community standard for long-term security is generally considered to be a 128-bit security level. An attack requiring 2^128 operations is computationally infeasible with any known or foreseen technology, including quantum computers.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Minimum Key Length:** We need to find the key length, *n*, such that the quantum security level is at least 128 bits.\n    *   Quantum Security Level = n / 2\n    *   We require: n / 2 ≥ 128\n    *   Solving for *n*: n ≥ 2 * 128\n    *   Therefore, n ≥ 256 bits.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** A symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long to provide a 128-bit security level against an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\n\n**List of careful points:**\n\n*   **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography:** The question specifically asks about symmetric keys. The impact of quantum computers is different for asymmetric cryptography (like RSA and ECC), where Shor's algorithm poses a much more severe threat, rendering current standards completely insecure.\n*   **Grover's Algorithm:** This is the key algorithm to consider for symmetric ciphers. It provides a quadratic speedup, which means the security bits are halved (square root of the number of operations).\n*   **\"Arbitrarily Powerful\":** This phrase means we should assume the best-case scenario for the attacker—that they have a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer capable of running Grover's algorithm effectively. We should not assume current noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.\n*   **\"At Least\":** The question asks for the minimum required length. While a 512-bit key would also be secure (providing 256 bits of quantum security), 256 bits is the minimum length that achieves the widely accepted 128-bit security benchmark against quantum attacks.\n*   **Security Benchmark:** The choice of 128 bits as the target security level is a crucial assumption based on current cryptographic standards (e.g., NIST recommendations). An attack requiring 2^64 operations (the quantum security of a 128-bit key) is considered within the realm of possibility for a highly resourced adversary. An attack requiring 2^128 operations is considered infeasible.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, a 256-bit key is the minimum required to achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
