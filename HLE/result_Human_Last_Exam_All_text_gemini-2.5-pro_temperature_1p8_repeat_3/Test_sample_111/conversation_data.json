    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key individuals and date.**\n*   **Geoffrey Chaucer:** The famous English poet and courtier.\n*   **Blanche of Lancaster:** The first wife of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and a prominent noblewoman.\n*   **Date of Death:** Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368, most likely from the plague, at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England.\n\n**Step 2: Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's known activities and travels in 1368.**\n*   At this time, Chaucer was a member of the royal household, serving King Edward III as a valet or esquire. This position sometimes required him to travel abroad on diplomatic or other royal business.\n*   His personal and professional life was closely intertwined with John of Gaunt, who was one of his most important patrons. Chaucer's wife, Philippa de Roet, was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Philippa, and her sister, Katherine Swynford, was a governess in John of Gaunt's household and later became his long-time mistress and wife.\n*   Historical records, specifically the Issue Rolls of the Exchequer, show that on June 20, 1368, Chaucer received a warrant for an advance of money to cover his expenses for traveling abroad on the King's service. The destination is not explicitly stated but is widely believed to have been France or the Low Countries.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze evidence for his return to England.**\n*   The crucial point is determining when he returned from this mission abroad.\n*   A record from the *Compotus* (household account) of the Earl of Derby (John of Gaunt's son, the future King Henry IV) shows a payment made to Chaucer in London on September 1, 1368.\n*   Since Blanche died on September 12, 1368, this record places Chaucer in London, England, just eleven days *before* her death.\n*   While it's theoretically possible he left the country again in those eleven days, it is highly improbable. He would most likely have remained in England as part of the royal court.\n\n**Step 4: Consider evidence following Blanche's death.**\n*   Later in the year, on Christmas Eve of 1368, records show that both Geoffrey Chaucer and his wife Philippa received allowances for mourning clothes from John of Gaunt. This was a common practice for members of a noble household to formally mourn the death of a patron's family member.\n*   Chaucer's first major poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, written between 1368 and 1372, is universally accepted as an elegy for Blanche of Lancaster. This literary work further solidifies his connection to the event and his presence within the grieving court circle in England.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the provided answer choices based on the evidence.**\n*   A. Italy: Incorrect. Chaucer's first recorded diplomatic mission to Italy was not until 1372.\n*   B. France: He was likely in France during the summer of 1368, but the evidence places him back in England by September 1st, before Blanche's death.\n*   C. England: This is the most supported answer. The financial record of September 1, 1368, places him in London. His subsequent participation in the formal court mourning also occurred in England.\n*   D. Unknown: While pinpointing someone's exact location on a specific day centuries ago can be difficult, the available evidence points strongly to England, making \"Unknown\" a less accurate choice.\n*   E. Scotland: There is no historical evidence suggesting Chaucer was in Scotland during this period.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the financial record placing him in London on September 1, 1368, and his participation in the court mourning later that year, the most logical and evidence-based conclusion is that Geoffrey Chaucer was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368.\n\n<<<C>>>"
