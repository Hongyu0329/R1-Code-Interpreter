    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Group:** The group in question is $G = T \\times T$, the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself.\n2.  **Cohomology Theory:** We are asked to compute the dimension of the **bounded cohomology** group, denoted $H_b^n(G; V)$.\n3.  **Degree:** The degree is $n = 4$.\n4.  **Coefficients:** The coefficients are trivial real coefficients, which means the group acts trivially on $V = \\mathbb{R}$.\n5.  **Objective:** Compute $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology**\n\nTo compute the bounded cohomology of a direct product of groups, we can use the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology. For two countable groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, this formula states that there is an isomorphism:\n$$ \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\hat{\\otimes} H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\xrightarrow{\\cong} H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) $$\nwhere $\\hat{\\otimes}$ is the projective tensor product. For our purpose of computing the dimension, this simplifies to the following algebraic formula for the dimensions:\n$$ \\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\left( \\dim H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\right) $$\nThis formula is known to hold for $G_1 = G_2 = T$ because Thompson's group T is non-amenable.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Künneth Formula to our Problem**\n\nWe set $G_1 = G_2 = T$ and $n=4$. The formula becomes:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R}) $$\nWe need to evaluate the terms for all pairs $(p, q)$ of non-negative integers such that $p+q=4$. The pairs are (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 0).\nThe expanded sum is:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T) = (\\dim H_b^0(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T)) + (\\dim H_b^1(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T)) + (\\dim H_b^2(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T)) + (\\dim H_b^3(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T)) + (\\dim H_b^4(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T)) $$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Dimensions of the Bounded Cohomology of T**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in knowing the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group T with real coefficients. These are well-established results in geometric group theory.\n\n*   **Degree 0:** For any non-empty group, $H_b^0(G; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. So, $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n*   **Degree 1:** For any group $G$, $H_b^1(G; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$. So, $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n*   **Degree 2:** A famous result by Ghys and Sergiescu shows that T admits a non-trivial bounded Euler class. It was further established that this class spans the entire second bounded cohomology group. So, $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, which means $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n*   **Degree $\\ge$ 3:** A deep theorem by Nicolas Monod establishes that the higher bounded cohomology of T vanishes. Specifically, for all $n \\geq 3$, $H_b^n(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$. This implies that:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the Dimensions and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nNow we substitute these dimensions back into the expanded sum from Step 2:\n\n*   Term 1 ($p=0, q=4$): $\\dim H_b^0(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T) = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   Term 2 ($p=1, q=3$): $\\dim H_b^1(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   Term 3 ($p=2, q=2$): $\\dim H_b^2(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   Term 4 ($p=3, q=1$): $\\dim H_b^3(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   Term 5 ($p=4, q=0$): $\\dim H_b^4(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T) = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$.\n\nSumming these terms gives the total dimension:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Validity of the Künneth Formula:** The applicability of the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology is a non-trivial theorem and relies on properties of the groups involved. For T, its non-amenability is sufficient.\n*   **Accuracy of Input Data:** The calculation is entirely dependent on the correctness of the dimensions of $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$. These are fundamental but deep results in the field. The vanishing of higher bounded cohomology ($n \\ge 3$) for T is particularly crucial.\n*   **Understanding the Result:** The non-zero contribution comes solely from the $p=2, q=2$ term. This means the one-dimensional space $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$ is generated by the cross product of the generator of $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$ with itself.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to a single, well-defined result.\n\n<<<1>>>"
