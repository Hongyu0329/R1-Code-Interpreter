    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Setup and Geometry**\n*   **The Tank:** The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 equal edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   **Orientation:** The icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of its triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base of the tank.\n*   **Symmetry of Orientation:** A key property of the icosahedron is that for any face, there is an opposite face that is perfectly parallel to it. Therefore, if the tank rests on a triangular face, its top surface is also a parallel, identical triangular face.\n*   **Filling Level:** The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This refers to the volume. The water occupies exactly half of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Water Surface**\n*   **Center of Volume:** A regular icosahedron possesses a point of inversion symmetry at its geometric center. This means that for any point within the icosahedron, the point reflected through the center is also within the icosahedron.\n*   **Bisecting Plane:** This center of symmetry is also the center of volume. Any plane passing through this center divides the icosahedron's volume into two equal halves.\n*   **Water Level:** Since the tank is half-filled by volume, the water level must lie on the horizontal plane that passes through the exact center of the icosahedron. The shape of the water's surface is therefore the shape of the cross-section created by this central, horizontal plane.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Symmetry of the Cross-Sectional Shape**\nThe problem is now reduced to identifying the shape of the central cross-section of an icosahedron, taken parallel to one of its faces. We can determine this shape by analyzing its symmetries.\n*   **Rotational Symmetry:** The icosahedron is oriented on a triangular face. An axis passing perpendicularly through the center of this base triangle and the center of the parallel top triangle is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. Since the water surface is a horizontal plane perpendicular to this axis, the shape of the surface must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Central Symmetry:** The water surface is a plane that passes through the icosahedron's center of inversion. This means the 2D shape of the water surface must itself be centrally symmetric. For a 2D shape, central symmetry is equivalent to having 2-fold rotational symmetry about its center.\n*   **Combined Symmetry:** A shape that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry about the same center must have 6-fold rotational symmetry. (The group generated by a 3-fold and a 2-fold rotation about the same axis is the 6-fold rotation group).\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Shape**\n*   The water surface is the intersection of a plane with the polyhedron, which results in a polygon.\n*   We need to identify a polygon that exhibits 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   The only polygon with 6-fold rotational symmetry is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n1.  Correctly interpret \"standing on one of its faces\" to establish the orientation and the existence of a parallel top face.\n2.  Understand that \"half-filled\" refers to volume, not height.\n3.  Recognize that the icosahedron's center of symmetry means the half-volume level is a plane through the geometric center.\n4.  Apply the principles of symmetry. The 3-fold symmetry of the object's orientation and the inherent central symmetry of the icosahedron combine to require that the cross-sectional shape has 6-fold symmetry.\n5.  A polygon with 6-fold symmetry must be a regular hexagon.\n\nThe vertices of this hexagon are formed where the cutting plane intersects six of the icosahedron's edges that form a \"zig-zag\" pattern around its equator. The sides of the hexagon are formed by the intersection of the plane with six of the triangular faces.\n\nThe final answer is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<a regular hexagon>>>"
