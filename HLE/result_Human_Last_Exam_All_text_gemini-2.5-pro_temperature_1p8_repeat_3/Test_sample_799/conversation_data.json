    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set $E$ in an additive group (in this case, the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$) is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums of its elements are unique up to permutation of the summands. Formally, for any $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\in E$, the equation $x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4$ implies that the multiset $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ is a permutation of the multiset $\\{x_3, x_4\\}$. This means either $(x_1, x_2) = (x_3, x_4)$ or $(x_1, x_2) = (x_4, x_3)$.\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(E)$, is a way to measure the \"fractal\" dimension or complexity of a set $E$. It can be any non-negative real number. For a set in $\\mathbb{R}$, its Hausdorff dimension is between 0 and 1. A finite set has dimension 0, while an interval has dimension 1.\n\nThe question asks for the supremum of the Hausdorff dimension over all possible Sidon sets contained within the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound for the Dimension\n\nThis is the first major part of the analysis. We want to show that the dimension of a Sidon set cannot be \"too large\". A common approach in this area is to use arguments from fractal geometry and arithmetic combinatorics.\n\n*   **Heuristic Argument (with a flaw):** Let $E \\subseteq [0,1]$ be a Sidon set. Consider the sum map $f(x,y) = x+y$ defined on $E \\times E$. The Sidon property implies that this map is almost injective (2-to-1 due to symmetry, i.e., $f(x,y)=f(y,x)$). Since the map is almost injective, one might guess that the dimension of the sum set $E+E = \\{x+y \\mid x,y \\in E\\}$ is the same as the dimension of the domain $E \\times E$.\n    *   $\\dim_H(E \\times E) = \\dim_H(E) + \\dim_H(E) = 2 \\dim_H(E)$.\n    *   The sum set $E+E$ is a subset of $[0, 2]$, so its dimension is at most 1: $\\dim_H(E+E) \\le 1$.\n    *   Equating the dimensions, we get $2 \\dim_H(E) \\approx \\dim_H(E+E) \\le 1$, which suggests $\\dim_H(E) \\le 1/2$.\n*   **Careful Point:** This heuristic is not a proof. The relationship $\\dim_H(f(A)) = \\dim_H(A)$ requires the map $f$ to be bi-Lipschitz, which the sum map is not. Its inverse is not Lipschitz. So, a more rigorous argument is needed.\n*   **Rigorous Argument (sketch):** A more robust argument relies on deep results in arithmetic combinatorics, particularly those concerning the dimension of sets defined by additive relations. Let $s = \\dim_H(E)$.\n    1.  Consider the set of all solutions to the Sidon equation: $S = \\{(x,y,z,w) \\in E^4 : x+y = z+w\\}$.\n    2.  The set of *trivial* solutions (which are always present) is $T = \\{(x,y,x,y) \\mid x,y \\in E\\} \\cup \\{(x,y,y,x) \\mid x,y \\in E\\}$. The dimension of this set is $\\dim_H(T) = \\dim_H(E \\times E) = 2s$.\n    3.  $E$ is a Sidon set if and only if there are no non-trivial solutions, which means $S = T$.\n    4.  A result by Jean Bourgain on the dimension of such \"sum-product\" sets shows that (under appropriate conditions) the dimension of the solution set $S$ is $\\dim_H(S) = 4s - 1$.\n    5.  For $E$ to be a Sidon set, we must have $S=T$. A necessary condition for this is $\\dim_H(S) \\le \\dim_H(T)$.\n    6.  This leads to the inequality: $4s - 1 \\le 2s$.\n    7.  Solving for $s$ gives $2s \\le 1$, or $s \\le 1/2$.\n    This shows that if the Hausdorff dimension of a set $E$ is greater than $1/2$, it *cannot* be a Sidon set. Therefore, the maximum possible dimension is at most $1/2$.\n\n### Step 3: Show that the Upper Bound is Attainable\n\nThe second major part of the analysis is to demonstrate that the upper bound of $1/2$ can actually be achieved. This requires constructing a specific Sidon set that has a Hausdorff dimension of exactly $1/2$.\n\n*   **The Challenge:** Constructing such a set is highly non-trivial. Simple constructions of fractal sets often fail to be Sidon sets.\n    *   For example, the middle-third Cantor set is not a Sidon set. We have $1/3, 1 \\in C$ and $2/3 \\in C$. Then $1/3 + 1 = 2/3 + 2/3$, which is a non-trivial solution to the Sidon equation.\n    *   A slightly more advanced construction might be a self-similar Cantor set $C_M(D) = \\{ \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty d_j M^{-j} \\mid d_j \\in D \\}$, where $D$ is an integer Sidon set. This construction also generally fails because of what's known as the \"digit-swapping\" problem. One can form non-trivial solutions by rearranging digits at different positions, as long as the sums of digits at each position remain the same.\n*   **Known Constructions:** The existence of a Sidon set with dimension $1/2$ has been proven in several research papers. These constructions are quite sophisticated.\n    *   One approach involves building specific random Cantor sets and showing that with probability 1, they are Sidon sets with dimension $1/2$.\n    *   Another approach, taken by K. Hare and L. Roginskaya (2007), provides an explicit construction of a symmetric Cantor set with $\\dim_H(E)=1/2$ that is a Sidon set. They carefully choose the scaling factors and translations in a self-similar construction to avoid additive relations. For example, a set can be constructed from four contractions $f_i(x) = (x+c_i)/16$ for $i=1,2,3,4$. The dimension is $\\log(4)/\\log(16) = 1/2$. The key difficulty, which they solve, is to choose the translation parameters $\\{c_i\\}$ so the resulting set is Sidon.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the two steps, we have:\n1.  The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0, 1]$ is at most $1/2$.\n2.  There exists at least one Sidon set in $[0, 1]$ whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly $1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is $1/2$.\n\n<<<0.5>>>"
