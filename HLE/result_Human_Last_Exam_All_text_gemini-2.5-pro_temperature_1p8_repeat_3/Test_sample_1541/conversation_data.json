    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the most memory-efficient C program and calculate its memory usage.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Understanding the Core Task:** The goal is to reorder the numbers in a given sum string so they appear in non-decreasing order. The input consists only of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and the '+' symbol. For example, input `\"3+2+1+4+1\"` should become output `\"1+1+2+3+4\"`.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Key Constraint:** The problem explicitly asks for the *most memory-efficient C program*. This means we need to minimize the total bytes used by the variables in our program. The final answer `m` will be this total memory usage in bytes.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Input Format:** The input is a string with a maximum length of 1000 characters. Numbers are at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and '+' signs are at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...). The maximum number of summands occurs in a string like \"1+1+...+1\", which has `(1000+1)/2 = 500.5`. Thus, there can be at most 501 numbers.\n\n### Exploring Potential Solutions to Minimize Memory\n\nWe can evaluate different programming strategies based on how much memory their variables would consume. We will assume a standard environment where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Using a separate array for numbers**\n    1.  Declare a `char` array to read the input string: `char s[1001];` (1001 bytes).\n    2.  Declare an `int` array to store the extracted numbers: `int numbers[501];` (`501 * 4` = 2004 bytes).\n    3.  Parse `s`, convert characters to integers, and store them in `numbers`.\n    4.  Sort `numbers`.\n    5.  Print the sorted numbers with '+' separators.\n    *   **Memory Cost:** ~1001 + 2004 + loop variables = **>3000 bytes**. This is not very memory-efficient.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Using Counting Sort**\n    Since the range of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) is very small, counting sort is a highly efficient method in terms of both time and memory.\n    1.  Declare a `char` array for the input: `char s[1001];` (1001 bytes).\n    2.  Declare a small `int` array to count occurrences: `int count[4] = {0};` (16 bytes).\n    3.  Iterate through `s` once, populating the `count` array (e.g., `count[0]` for 1s, `count[1]` for 2s, etc.).\n    4.  Construct the output by printing the numbers based on the stored counts.\n    *   **Memory Cost:** 1001 bytes for `s` + 16 bytes for `count` + ~12 bytes for loop counters and flags = **~1029 bytes**. This is a significant improvement.\n\n*   **Strategy 3: In-place Sorting (Most Memory-Efficient)**\n    This strategy aims to reuse the input buffer itself to perform the sort, eliminating the need for any auxiliary data arrays.\n    1.  Declare a `char` array for the input: `char s[1001];` (1001 bytes).\n    2.  **Partition:** Traverse `s` and move all the digit characters to the beginning of the array. For example, `\"3+2+1\"` becomes `\"321\"` within the first three cells of `s`. We only need one `int` variable (`num_count`) to track how many digits we've gathered.\n    3.  **Sort:** Use the `qsort` library function to sort the first `num_count` characters of the `s` array. `\"321\"` becomes `\"123\"`. The numbers are sorted as characters, which is sufficient.\n    4.  **Print:** Iterate through the sorted portion of `s` and print the result with '+' separators.\n    *   **Memory Cost:**\n        *   `char s[1001];`: 1001 bytes\n        *   Variables `int i, num_count;`: `2 * 4` = 8 bytes\n        *   **Total for Strategy 3: 1001 + 8 = 1009 bytes**.\n\n### Listing Careful Points\n\n1.  **Buffer for Input String:** A C string requires a null terminator (`\\0`). For an input string of maximum length 1000, the buffer must be declared as `char s[1001];`.\n2.  **Memory Calculation:** The total memory `m` is the sum of memory used by all declared variables (on the stack or in global scope). This includes the main data structures and any helper variables like loop counters.\n3.  **Data Types:** Using `char` to store the digits '1', '2', etc., is more memory-efficient than converting them to `int`s and storing them in an `int` array.\n4.  **Reusing Memory:** The most efficient approach reuses the input buffer for the sorting process, thus avoiding the memory cost of a separate array for numbers or counts.\n5.  **Variable Minimization:** The implementation should declare a minimal number of helper variables. The in-place method successfully does this, requiring only a couple of integers for loop control and counting.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer (Step-by-Step with Analysis)\n\nThe most memory-efficient approach is **Strategy 3: In-place Sorting**. Let's finalize the memory calculation for an optimal C program implementing this strategy.\n\n1.  **Declare input buffer:**\n    ```c\n    char s[1001];\n    ```\n    This allocates `1001 * sizeof(char)` = **1001 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Declare necessary integer variables:**\n    To implement the logic (partitioning, sorting, and printing), we need at a minimum:\n    *   An index for iterating through loops (`int i`).\n    *   A counter for the number of digits found (`int num_count`).\n    ```c\n    int i = 0, num_count = 0;\n    ```\n    This allocates `2 * sizeof(int)` = `2 * 4` = **8 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Summing the variable memory:**\n    The total memory `m` is the sum of the memory allocated for all variables.\n    `m = (memory for s) + (memory for integer variables)`\n    `m = 1001 + 8`\n    `m = 1009`\n\nThe C program would read the string, overwrite its beginning with just the digits, call `qsort` on that part, and then print the formatted result. This entire process is completed using only the 1009 bytes of variable memory calculated above.\n\n<<<1009>>>"
