    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Atoms in the Molecule**\nThe chemical formula for toluene is C₇H₈.\nThis means the molecule consists of:\n*   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n**2. Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation**\nThe Pople-style basis set notation `6-31G` provides a recipe for how many basis functions are used for each atomic orbital and how they are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). We are interested in the number of *contracted* Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are the actual basis functions used in the calculation.\n\n*   The number before the hyphen (`6`) describes the core atomic orbitals.\n*   The numbers after the hyphen (`31`) describe the valence atomic orbitals.\n*   `G` simply stands for Gaussian-type orbitals.\n\n**3. Determine the Number of CGFs per Hydrogen Atom (H)**\n*   Hydrogen has only a 1s valence orbital and no core orbitals.\n*   We use the `31G` part of the notation for the valence shell. The notation `31` means the valence shell is \"split\" into two basis functions (a \"split-valence\" or \"double-zeta valence\" description).\n    *   The first basis function (the inner, more contracted part) is a CGF composed of a linear combination of **3** PGFs.\n    *   The second basis function (the outer, more diffuse part) is a CGF composed of a single (**1**) PGF.\n*   Therefore, for each hydrogen atom, there are 1 + 1 = **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n**4. Determine the Number of CGFs per Carbon Atom (C)**\n*   Carbon is a second-row element with both core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) orbitals.\n*   **Core Orbital (1s):** The `6-` part of the notation tells us that the 1s core orbital is represented by a single CGF, which is a contraction of 6 PGFs. This gives **1 CGF** for the core.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The `-31G` part describes the valence shell. The valence shell is split into an inner and an outer part.\n    *   **Inner Valence Part (`3`):** This describes a set of functions for the 2s and 2p orbitals. It consists of one s-type CGF and three p-type CGFs (px, py, pz). This gives 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer Valence Part (`1`):** This also describes a set of functions for the 2s and 2p orbitals, but these are more diffuse. It consists of one s-type CGF and three p-type CGFs (px, py, pz). This gives another 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 CGFs**.\n*   Total CGFs for a single carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of CGFs for Toluene (C₇H₈)**\nNow, we sum the contributions from all the atoms in the molecule.\n*   Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms: 7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs\n*   Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs\n*   Total number of contracted Gaussian functions = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question asks for the number of *contracted* Gaussian functions (CGFs), not the underlying *primitive* Gaussian functions (PGFs). The CGFs are the basis functions used in the quantum chemistry calculation.\n*   **Core vs. Valence Shells:** The notation applies differently to core and valence electrons. For second-row atoms like carbon, the first number (`6`) applies only to the core 1s orbital.\n*   **Split Valence:** The `31` indicates that the valence shell is described by two sets of basis functions of different sizes (one inner, one outer), making it a split-valence basis set.\n*   **s and p Functions:** In Pople basis sets, the valence s and p orbitals are typically treated together. The `31` split applies to both the 2s and 2p orbitals, meaning there is an inner s/p set and an outer s/p set.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as follows:\n(7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/atom) + (8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/atom) = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
