    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n**1. Understanding the Toric Code and Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD)**\n\n*   The toric code is a quantum stabilizer code. Its ground states are states stabilized by all stabilizer operators.\n*   The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is the number of independent ground states.\n*   The GSD is given by $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of logical qubits.\n*   The number of logical qubits, $k$, is determined by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined.\n\n**2. GSD on a General Surface**\n\n*   For a toric code defined on a closed 2D surface of genus $g$ (e.g., a sphere with $g$ handles) with $b$ boundaries (holes), the number of logical qubits is given by the formula:\n    $k = 2g + b - 1$\n*   This formula has been shown to be independent of the type of boundary conditions (smooth or rough) applied to the holes.\n\n**3. Defining the Surface and its Parameters**\n\n*   The problem describes a \"toric code with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\" This generally implies the code is defined on a surface that is topologically equivalent to a sphere ($g=0$) with punctures.\n*   However, in many practical and theoretical contexts, such a system is modeled on a finite 2D plane. A finite plane is topologically a disk, which is equivalent to a sphere with one large hole (the outer boundary).\n*   This interpretation (a planar code) is common and often implicitly assumed. If we treat the system as being on a finite plane, there is an additional boundary to considerâ€”the perimeter of the plane itself. Let's analyze both interpretations (sphere vs. plane).\n\n**4. Analysis for a Sphere with Holes**\n\n*   If the surface is a sphere, the genus is $g=0$.\n*   There are $n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes, making a total of $b = n+m$ boundaries.\n*   Using the formula $k = 2g + b - 1$, we get:\n    $k = 2(0) + (n+m) - 1 = n+m-1$.\n*   The GSD would be $2^{n+m-1}$.\n*   Let's check this against the answer choices. None of the options match $2^{n+m-1}$. This suggests the \"sphere with holes\" interpretation may not be what the question intends, especially in a multiple-choice context where one answer is expected to be correct.\n\n**5. Analysis for a Planar Code (Disk with Holes)**\n\n*   Let's assume the more common practical setting of a planar code. The surface is a 2D plane, which is topologically a disk. A disk is a sphere with one boundary.\n*   The $n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes are internal to this disk.\n*   So, in total, we have $n$ internal smooth holes, $m$ internal rough holes, plus the 1 outer boundary of the disk.\n*   The total number of boundaries is $b = n + m + 1$.\n*   The type of the outer boundary is not specified. However, the formula for $k$ is independent of the boundary types.\n*   The genus of a disk is $g=0$.\n*   Using the formula $k = 2g + b - 1$:\n    $k = 2(0) + (n + m + 1) - 1 = n+m$.\n*   Therefore, the number of logical qubits is $k = n+m$.\n*   The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is $2^k = 2^{n+m}$.\n\n**6. Verification of the Planar Code Interpretation**\n\n*   Let's check this result, GSD = $2^{n+m}$, with some simple cases.\n    *   **No internal holes ($n=0, m=0$):** We have a simple disk (planar code with no holes). $k=0+0=0$. GSD = $2^0 = 1$. This is correct; a simple disk has a unique ground state.\n    *   **One smooth internal hole ($n=1, m=0$):** This is an annulus with two smooth boundaries (the inner hole and the outer edge of the plane, assuming it's also smooth). The formula gives $k=1+0=1$. GSD = $2^1=2$. This is correct.\n    *   **One rough internal hole ($m=1, n=0$):** This is an annulus with one smooth and one rough boundary (assuming the outer edge is smooth). The formula gives $k=0+1=1$. GSD = $2^1=2$. This is correct.\n*   The interpretation of the system as a planar code leads to the formula GSD = $2^{n+m}$, which is consistent with known results for simple configurations and matches one of the answer choices.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe number of logical qubits for a toric code on a surface with genus $g$ and $b$ boundaries is $k=2g+b-1$. For a planar code, the surface is a disk ($g=0$) with $n$ smooth and $m$ rough internal holes, plus one outer boundary. This gives a total of $b=n+m+1$ boundaries. The number of logical qubits is $k = 0 + (n+m+1) - 1 = n+m$.\nThe ground space degeneracy is therefore $2^k = 2^{n+m}$.\n\nFinal Answer Selection: This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
