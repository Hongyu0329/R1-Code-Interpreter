    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\nThe core task is to compute the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix, denoted as `A`. The question provides additional context about a \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\", but then explicitly defines the matrix to be analyzed:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe information about \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) appears to be contextual and does not alter the structure of the matrix `A`. Therefore, we will proceed by calculating the determinant of the given matrix `A`.\n\n**2. List Careful Points and Choose a Method**\n*   **Matrix Identification:** The matrix for which the determinant needs to be calculated is clearly given. We should not be misled by the extra terminology unless it implies a modification to the matrix, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n*   **Method Selection:** For a 3x3 matrix, there are several methods to find the determinant:\n    *   The Sarrus rule (the standard formula for 3x3 determinants).\n    *   Cofactor expansion.\n    *   Row reduction to a triangular form.\n    *   Identifying special properties of the matrix.\n*   **Potential Shortcut:** Before diving into calculation, it's wise to inspect the matrix for special properties. A matrix has a determinant of zero if its rows or columns are linearly dependent.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Method 1: Using Matrix Properties (Recommended)**\n\n*   **Step 1:** Observe the sum of the elements in each row of the matrix `A`.\n    *   Row 1:  \\( 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Row 2:  \\( (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Row 3:  \\( (-1) + (-1) + 2 = 0 \\)\n*   **Step 2:** Observe the sum of the elements in each column.\n    *   Column 1: \\( 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Column 2: \\( (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Column 3: \\( (-1) + (-1) + 2 = 0 \\)\n*   **Step 3:** Relate this property to the determinant. If the sum of the elements in each row (or column) of a square matrix is zero, its rows (or columns) are linearly dependent.\n    *   For instance, let \\(R_1, R_2, R_3\\) be the row vectors. We can see that \\(R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = [0, 0, 0]\\). This demonstrates linear dependence.\n    *   Alternatively, this property implies that the vector \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\) is a non-zero solution to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}\\). This means that 0 is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n*   **Step 4:** A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that a square matrix is singular (i.e., its determinant is zero) if and only if its rows or columns are linearly dependent, or equivalently, if it has an eigenvalue of 0.\n*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, the determinant of `A` must be 0.\n\n**Method 2: Using the Sarrus Rule (for Verification)**\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix}\\) is given by the formula: \\( det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\).\n\n*   **Step 1:** Identify the coefficients from matrix `A`:\n    *   \\(a=2, b=-1, c=-1\\)\n    *   \\(d=-1, e=2, f=-1\\)\n    *   \\(g=-1, h=-1, i=2\\)\n*   **Step 2:** Substitute these values into the formula:\n    \\( \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot ( (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) ) - (-1) \\cdot ( (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) ) + (-1) \\cdot ( (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) ) \\)\n*   **Step 3:** Simplify the expression:\n    \\( \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot ( 4 - 1 ) + 1 \\cdot ( -2 - 1 ) - 1 \\cdot ( 1 - (-2) ) \\)\n    \\( \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (3) + 1 \\cdot (-3) - 1 \\cdot (3) \\)\n    \\( \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 \\)\n*   **Step 4:** Calculate the final result:\n    \\( \\det(A) = 0 \\)\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBoth methods confirm that the determinant of the given matrix `A` is 0. The first method, by observing the matrix properties, is more efficient and insightful.\n\n<<<0>>>"
