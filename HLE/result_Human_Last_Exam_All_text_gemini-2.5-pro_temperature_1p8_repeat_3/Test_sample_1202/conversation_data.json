    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes.\n    *   **Process 1: Retention:** How is a new gene copy kept in the genome over evolutionary time, avoiding being lost as a non-functional pseudogene? Immediately after duplication, one copy is redundant, meaning there is no selective pressure to maintain it, so it can be easily lost. A mechanism for retention must explain how the duplicate copy becomes essential or beneficial.\n    *   **Process 2: Divergence:** How do the two gene copies become different from each other in their DNA sequence and, consequently, their function?\n    *   **Qualifier: \"Most Likely\":** The question asks for the most common or probable mechanism among the choices provided. This suggests that while multiple mechanisms may exist, one is considered a primary driver.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between homologous sequences. One sequence is \"converted\" to match the other. This process leads to homogenization (making sequences identical), which is the *opposite* of divergence. While it's relevant to gene family evolution, it doesn't explain how duplicates diverge in function to be retained.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a gene accumulates disabling mutations (like stop codons or frameshifts) and becomes non-functional. It is the most common *fate* of a redundant duplicate gene. However, it represents the *loss* of the gene, not its functional *retention*. Therefore, it is a failure to retain, not a mechanism for retention.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, after gene duplication, one copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the second copy is free to accumulate mutations. By chance, these mutations may result in a completely new, beneficial function. Natural selection then acts to preserve this new function, leading to the retention of both genes.\n        *   **Retention:** Yes, the original gene is needed for its original function, and the duplicate is now beneficial for its new function.\n        *   **Divergence:** Yes, the duplicate gene's sequence changes to acquire the new function.\n        *   **Likelihood:** This requires a rare gain-of-function mutation to occur before the redundant gene is lost, which can be a significant evolutionary hurdle.\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in multiple tissues (i.e., it was pleiotropic). After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that disable *different* subfunctions. For example, copy 1 loses the ability to function in tissue A but retains function in tissue B, while copy 2 loses function in tissue B but retains it in tissue A. Now, both copies are required to perform the full set of ancestral functions.\n        *   **Retention:** Yes, because neither copy alone can fulfill all the original essential roles, so there is selective pressure to keep both. This solves the initial redundancy problem effectively.\n        *   **Divergence:** Yes, the genes diverge as they accumulate different inactivating mutations.\n        *   **Likelihood:** This mechanism relies on loss-of-function mutations, which are much more common than gain-of-function mutations. Therefore, it provides a more probable and quicker path to making both duplicates necessary for the organism's fitness.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern describing the rapid diversification of a lineage into many new species that fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that fuels adaptive radiation, adaptive radiation itself is a population/species-level phenomenon, not a molecular mechanism for the retention of a specific gene.\n\n3.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n\n    *   Both neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    *   However, subfunctionalization (D) offers a more robust solution to the initial problem of redundancy. A newly duplicated gene has no selective pressure on it and is likely to become a pseudogene. Subfunctionalization provides a pathway where common, neutral, or slightly deleterious mutations can quickly make both copies essential, thus locking them into the genome.\n    *   Neofunctionalization (C) is a powerful evolutionary force but is thought to be rarer because it depends on the chance evolution of a novel, beneficial functionâ€”a much less frequent event than a loss-of-function mutation.\n    *   Therefore, many evolutionary biologists consider **subfunctionalization** to be a more common, and thus \"most likely,\" initial mechanism for the preservation of duplicated genes.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, subfunctionalization provides the most plausible and frequent pathway for ensuring that both copies of a duplicated gene are preserved and subsequently diverge.\n\n<<<D>>>"
