The product is the ketone formed from an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement of the starting material. The reaction proceeds by deprotonation of the endo-alcohol, followed by a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift where the C1-C2 bond breaks and a new bond forms between C5 and the C2' of the cyclopentenyl group. The resulting enolate is protonated and tautomerizes to a ketone upon workup. The TBS ether and dimethoxy ketal functionalities remain intact.
