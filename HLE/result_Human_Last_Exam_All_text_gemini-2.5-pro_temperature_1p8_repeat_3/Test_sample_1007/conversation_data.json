    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends with the same leg position it started with.\n\n**The Question:**\nWe need to find the classical ballet step from the given options that finishes in the same position (specifically, with the same foot in front) as it began.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a jump of *batterie* (beaten steps). The number \"six\" refers to the number of movements/positions the legs make in the air. In essence, the legs cross three times. All even-numbered entrechats that land on two feet (like *entrechat quatre*, *six*, and *huit*) are defined by the fact that the legs return to their original position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in the exact starting fifth position (e.g., right foot remains in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** An *échappé* is a jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second). *Battu* means the legs beat together on the return to fifth.\n    *   **Key Point:** The word *changé* is French for \"changed\". This explicitly indicates that the feet will switch places.\n    *   **Ending Position:** If the step started with the right foot in front, it will end with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** A jump where one leg brushes out and the dancer pushes off the supporting leg to \"assemble\" both legs together in the air before landing on two feet. The most common forms, *assemblé dessus* (over) and *assemblé dessous* (under), involve changing the feet. For example, in *assemblé dessus*, the leg that starts in the back finishes in the front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** In its standard forms, the feet have changed position.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is generally different from the starting position.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** *Glissade* means \"to glide\". *Derrière* means the second leg closes \"behind\" the first.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Whether the feet change depends on which leg initiates the movement.\n        *   If you start with the right foot in front and do a *glissade* to the right, your right foot moves first, and the left closes *derrière* it. You end with the right foot in front (no change).\n        *   However, if you start with the right foot in front and do a *glissade* to the left, your left (back) foot moves first, and your right foot closes *derrière* it. You now end with the left foot in front (feet have changed).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since *glissade derrière* can be performed with or without changing the feet, it is not a step that *always* ends in the same position.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex decorative step, like a *pas de chat* combined with a small circle (*rond de jambe*) from each leg in the air.\n    *   **Ending Position:** In its most common execution, the step is performed by changing the feet, with the second leg finishing in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is typically different from the starting position.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nBased on the analysis, **Entrechat six** is the only step among the choices that, by its very definition, requires the dancer to land in the same position from which the step began. The other steps either explicitly change feet, usually change feet, or can be performed either with or without a change.\n\n<<<A>>>"
