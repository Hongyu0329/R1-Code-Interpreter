    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (or trisyllabic shortening) is a phonological rule in English that affects long (tense) vowels. The rule states that a tense vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable, which is the third syllable from the end of a word. This process often occurs when a suffix is added to a root word.\n\n*   A classic example is the change from `sane` /seɪn/ (tense vowel /eɪ/) to `sanity` /sænɪti/ (lax vowel /æ/). The vowel is in the first syllable of `san-i-ty`, which is the third syllable from the end.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Word**\n\n*   **southern:**\n    *   **Base word:** `south` /saʊθ/. The vowel is the diphthong /aʊ/, which is a tense vowel.\n    *   **Derived word:** `southern` /ˈsʌðərn/. The vowel changes to the lax /ʌ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count:** `south-ern` has only two syllables.\n    *   **Analysis:** Although a tense vowel becomes lax, the process is not *trisyllabic* laxing because the word is not three syllables long. Therefore, `southern` has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative:**\n    *   **Base word:** `derive` /dɪˈraɪv/. The vowel in the stressed syllable is the tense diphthong /aɪ/.\n    *   **Derived word:** `derivative` /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/. The word has four syllables: `de-riv-a-tive`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The original tense vowel /aɪ/ is now in the antepenultimate (third-from-end) syllable, `-riv-`. It changes to the lax vowel /ɪ/. This is a clear example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity:**\n    *   **Base word:** `serene` /səˈriːn/. The vowel in the stressed syllable is the tense vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Derived word:** `serenity` /səˈrɛnɪti/. The word has four syllables: `se-ren-i-ty`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The original tense vowel /iː/ is now in the antepenultimate syllable, `-ren-`. It changes to the lax vowel /ɛ/. This is a clear example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant:**\n    *   **Base word:** `please` /pliːz/. The vowel is the tense /iː/.\n    *   **Derived word:** `pleasant` /ˈplɛzənt/. The vowel changes to the lax /ɛ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count:** `pleas-ant` has only two syllables.\n    *   **Analysis:** Like `southern`, a tense vowel laxes, but in a two-syllable word. This process is known as pre-cluster shortening, not trisyllabic laxing. Therefore, `pleasant` has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude:**\n    *   **Related word:** `grateful` /ˈɡreɪtfʊl/. The vowel is the tense diphthong /eɪ/.\n    *   **Derived word:** `gratitude` /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/. The word has three syllables: `grat-i-tude`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The related tense vowel /eɪ/ corresponds to the lax vowel /æ/ in the antepenultimate syllable, `grat-`. This is an example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow:**\n    *   **Etymology:** The word comes from Old English `sceadu`, where the first vowel `æ` was already short/lax.\n    *   **Modern word:** `shadow` /ˈʃædoʊ/. The first vowel is the lax /æ/.\n    *   **Syllable Count:** `shad-ow` has only two syllables.\n    *   **Analysis:** This word fails the conditions for trisyllabic laxing on two counts. First, it is only a two-syllable word. Second, and more fundamentally, there was no tense vowel in its history that underwent a laxing process; the vowel was already lax. Therefore, `shadow` has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThree words in the list have not undergone trisyllabic laxing: `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`. All are disyllabic (two syllables), so the \"trisyllabic\" condition is not met.\n\nHowever, there is a key difference. In `southern` (from `south`) and `pleasant` (from `please`), a tense vowel in the base word *did* become lax in the derived word, even though the rule wasn't TSL.\n\nIn `shadow`, the vowel /æ/ was never tense to begin with in its etymological history. It did not undergo any kind of laxing process from a tense vowel. This makes it the most definitive example of a word on the list that has not undergone the process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
