    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:**\n    *   **Position: Button (BTN).** This is the most powerful position in No-Limit Hold'em. From the button, we can play the widest range of hands profitably because we are guaranteed to act last post-flop.\n    *   **Action: Open to 2.5x.** This is a standard opening size. A smaller or larger size would slightly alter the optimal range, but 2.5x is a very common baseline.\n    *   **Stack Depth: 100BB.** This is the standard cash game stack depth, meaning implied odds are a factor, and post-flop playability is important.\n    *   **Game Type: Rake-Free Cash Game.** This is a critical detail. The absence of rake increases the pot size that the preflop raiser is fighting for. This makes opening marginally profitable hands more attractive than in a raked game. Essentially, our opening range should be slightly wider.\n    *   **The Question:** We need to find the \"worst\" suited Jack (Jxs) that we \"should open\". This means identifying the weakest hand in this category that is still considered a profitable, standard open-raise. This will be the hand at the very bottom of the suited jacks portion of our opening range.\n\n2.  **Ranking Suited Jacks:**\n    Suited hands derive their value from their ability to make flushes (high equity when they do) and straights. Within the Jxs category, the hands are ranked based on the strength of the kicker and their connectivity (ability to make straights).\n\n    The ranking from best to worst is:\n    *   JTs (Best: strong flush and straight potential)\n    *   J9s\n    *   J8s\n    *   J7s\n    *   J6s\n    *   J5s (Connects to the 'wheel' straights A-5)\n    *   J4s\n    *   J3s\n    *   J2s (Worst: weakest flush kicker, worst connectivity)\n\n3.  **Determining the Opening \"Cutoff\" Point:**\n    To find the worst hand we *should* open, we need to consult a standard GTO (Game Theory Optimal) opening range for the button.\n\n    *   **Top Tier (Clear Opens):** Hands like JTs, J9s, and J8s are premium hands from the button and are always opened.\n    *   **Mid Tier (Standard Opens):** Hands like J7s, J6s, and J5s are also standard, profitable opens from the button due to their excellent playability and the positional advantage.\n    *   **Bottom Tier (Marginal Hands):** This is where the decision lies. We are considering J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n        *   **J4s:** In virtually all modern GTO charts for a 100BB game, even with rake, J4s is considered a pure 100% open from the button.\n        *   **J3s:** This hand is often on the cusp. In many standard *raked* game charts, J3s is a \"mixed strategy\"â€”meaning it should be opened some percentage of the time and folded the rest. The absence of rake makes opening more profitable, which would push a mixed strategy hand like J3s into a pure (or at least very high-frequency) open.\n        *   **J2s:** This is the weakest hand in the category. In a *raked* game, this is often a pure fold or, at best, a very low-frequency open. However, in a **rake-free** environment, the EV of opening increases for all marginal hands. A GTO solver would adjust for the lack of rake by widening its opening range. This would pull J2s from being a fold/low-mix into a hand that *should* be opened, at least some of the time (a mixed strategy).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The phrase \"you should open\" means the hand is part of the optimal opening strategy. This includes hands that are opened 100% of the time and hands that are opened as a mix (e.g., 30% of the time). The line for \"should open\" is drawn between the weakest hand you ever open and a hand you always fold.\n\n    In a rake-free 100BB game, the button's opening range is very wide. The additional EV from the absence of rake makes the weakest suited jack, J2s, a profitable hand to include in your opening strategy (even if it's only part-time as a mixed strategy). Since it is part of the GTO opening range, it is a hand you \"should open\". As it is the lowest-ranked hand in its category, it is the definitive \"worst\" suited jack you should open.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
