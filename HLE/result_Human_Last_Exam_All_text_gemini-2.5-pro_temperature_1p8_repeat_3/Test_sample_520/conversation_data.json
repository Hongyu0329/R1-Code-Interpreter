    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core subject of the question.**\nThe question is about a specific individual, Andre Vernault, during a specific historical period, World War II.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the situation described.**\nAndre Vernault was a Belgian refugee in the United Kingdom. He was interrogated by British counterintelligence (MI5) and they suspected him of being a German spy.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the reason for the suspicion.**\nThe text explicitly states the reason for the suspicion: \"he concealed from interrogators his true profession.\" This is the central clue. His evasiveness made him look like a spy with something to hide.\n\n**Step 4: Determine what information is being requested.**\nThe question asks for the \"true profession\" that Andre Vernault was hiding.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the motive for concealment.**\nA spy would conceal their profession to hide their mission. However, the question states the belief that he was a spy was *false*. Therefore, Vernault must have had a different reason for hiding his profession. The most likely reason is that he found his profession to be embarrassing, shameful, or illegal, and feared that revealing it would lead to negative consequences with the British authorities, even if it had nothing to do with espionage.\n\n**Step 6: Research the specific historical case of Andre Vernault.**\nHistorical records, particularly declassified MI5 files and history books like Ben Macintyre's \"Double Cross,\" document this case. According to these sources, Andre Vernault was intensely interrogated because his story did not add up and his refusal to state his occupation was highly suspicious. After prolonged questioning, he finally broke down and confessed his true profession.\n\n**Step 7: State the true profession.**\nThe profession Andre Vernault was so ashamed of, and which he hid from his interrogators, was that of a **brothel-keeper** (or pimp) in Brussels. He was afraid the British would look down on him or deport him for this \"sordid\" trade. The irony is that in trying to hide this embarrassing truth, he made himself appear to be exactly what MI5 was looking for: a German spy trying to hide his cover. Once the truth was revealed and verified, he was cleared of suspicion.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nHis true profession was that he was a brothel-keeper.\n\n<<<Brothel-keeper>>>"
