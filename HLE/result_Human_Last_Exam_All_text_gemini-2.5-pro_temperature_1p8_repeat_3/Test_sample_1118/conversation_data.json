    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Painted after an encounter with the Gestapo (the question says \"escaped,\" but historical records indicate he was arrested and then released).\n*   **Object in question:** What is he holding in his hand?\n*   **Symbolism:** It represents a symbol of resistance.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the specific painting.**\nThe painting in question is Curt Querner's \"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\" (Self-Portrait with Pipe), dated 1933. This painting was indeed created after his arrest and imprisonment by the Gestapo in March of that year following the Reichstag Fire Decree.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the painting to identify the object.**\nUpon viewing the artwork \"Self-Portrait with Pipe (1933),\" we can clearly see that the artist is holding a smoking pipe in his right hand. The portrait shows his gaunt, tired face and haunted eyes, reflecting the ordeal he endured.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the symbolism of the object.**\n*   The painting itself is an act of defiance, as Querner unflinchingly documents the physical and psychological toll of his persecution by the new Nazi regime.\n*   The pipe is a simple, personal, and everyday object. By including it, Querner asserts his identity and humanity. It represents a small, private pleasure and a sense of normalcy that the state tried to take from him.\n*   Holding the pipe firmly becomes an act of quiet, inner resistance. It is not an overt political weapon, but a symbol of his unbroken spirit and his refusal to be completely dehumanized by his captors. It is a sign that he maintains his personal selfhood against the oppressive force of the state.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings to formulate the final answer.**\nCurt Querner painted the self-portrait in 1933 after being imprisoned by the Gestapo. In this painting, he holds a pipe. This common object serves as a powerful symbol of quiet defiance and the preservation of his personal identity and inner freedom against the oppressive Nazi regime.\n\n***\n\n<<<A pipe>>>"
