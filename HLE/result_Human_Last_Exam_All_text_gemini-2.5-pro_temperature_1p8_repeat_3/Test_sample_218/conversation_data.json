    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition of $n$. For $S_{25}$, we need to consider partitions of 25. The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda \\vdash 25$ is given by the hook-length formula. We are looking for the number of partitions $\\lambda$ such that the dimension of the corresponding irrep is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe dimension of an irrep $V_\\lambda$ is generally smaller when the Young diagram for $\\lambda$ is \"long and thin\" or \"short and wide\". Such partitions are of the form $(n-k, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of a small integer $k$, or their conjugates. The dimension of the irrep for $\\lambda$ and its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is the same. Unless $\\lambda$ is self-conjugate, this gives two irreps of the same dimension.\n\nWe will systematically check partitions of the form $(25-k, \\mu)$ where $\\mu \\vdash k$ for small values of $k$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze partitions of the form $(25-k, \\mu)$ for small k**\n\n*   **k=0:** The only partition of 0 is the empty partition. This gives the partition $\\lambda=(25)$ of 25. The corresponding irrep is the trivial representation, with dimension 1. Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(1^{25})$, the sign representation, which also has dimension 1. Since $(25)$ is not self-conjugate, these are two distinct irreps.\n    *   Number of irreps: 2.\n\n*   **k=1:** The only partition of 1 is (1). This gives $\\lambda=(24,1)$. The dimension is $\\binom{25-1}{1} = 24$. This is less than 500,000. It is not self-conjugate. So, this partition and its conjugate $(2,1^{23})$ both correspond to irreps of dimension 24.\n    *   Number of irreps: 2.\n\n*   **k=2:** Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1). This gives $\\lambda_1=(23,2)$ and $\\lambda_2=(23,1,1)$.\n    *   dim($V_{(23,2)}) = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n    *   dim($V_{(23,1,1)}) = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n    *   Both are < 500,000. Neither is self-conjugate. So, these 2 partitions and their conjugates give 4 irreps.\n    *   Number of irreps: 4.\n\n*   **k=3:** Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), and (1,1,1). We check the dimensions for $\\lambda=(22, \\mu)$ where $\\mu \\vdash 3$.\n    *   dim($V_{(22,3)}$) = 2,025\n    *   dim($V_{(22,2,1)}$) = 2,275\n    *   dim($V_{(22,1,1,1)}$) = $\\binom{24}{3}$ = 2,024\n    *   All 3 are < 500,000. None are self-conjugate. So we have $3 \\times 2 = 6$ irreps.\n    *   Number of irreps: 6.\n\n*   **k=4:** There are $p(4)=5$ partitions of 4. For each $\\mu \\vdash 4$, we check the dimension for $\\lambda=(21, \\mu)$. The largest dimension among these is for $\\lambda=(21,3,1)$, which is 20,350. All 5 are well below 500,000. None are self-conjugate.\n    *   Number of irreps: $5 \\times 2 = 10$.\n\n*   **k=5:** There are $p(5)=7$ partitions of 5. For each $\\mu \\vdash 5$, we check the dimension for $\\lambda=(20, \\mu)$. The largest dimension among these is for $\\lambda=(20,3,2)$, which is 106,260. All 7 are well below 500,000. None are self-conjugate.\n    *   Number of irreps: $7 \\times 2 = 14$.\n\n*   **k=6:** There are $p(6)=11$ partitions of 6. For each $\\mu \\vdash 6$, we check the dimension for $\\lambda=(19, \\mu)$. The largest dimension among these is for $\\lambda=(19,3,2,1)$, which is 440,440. All 11 are below 500,000. None are self-conjugate.\n    *   Number of irreps: $11 \\times 2 = 22$.\n\n*   **k=7:** There are $p(7)=15$ partitions of 7. We check dimensions for $\\lambda=(18, \\mu)$.\n    *   dim($V_{(18,7)}$) = $\\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480,700 - 177,100 = 303,600$ (< 500,000).\n    *   dim($V_{(18,1^7)}$) = $\\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$ (< 500,000).\n    *   The dimension for any other partition of the form $(18, \\mu)$ is greater than 500,000. For instance, dim($V_{(18,6,1)}$) is 846,720.\n    *   So, only 2 of these partitions work. They are not self-conjugate.\n    *   Number of irreps: $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **k=8:** We check partitions of the form $\\lambda=(17, \\mu)$, where $\\mu \\vdash 8$. The dimensions are smallest for $\\mu=(8)$ and $\\mu=(1^8)$.\n    *   dim($V_{(17,8)}$) = $\\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1,081,575 - 480,700 = 600,875$ (> 500,000).\n    *   dim($V_{(17,1^8)}$) = $\\binom{24}{8} = 735,471$ (> 500,000).\n    *   Since the smallest dimensions for $k=8$ are already above the threshold, no other partitions for $k=8$ will work.\n\n**Step 2: Argue that no other partitions are possible**\n\nThe dimensions for partitions $(n-k,\\mu)$ tend to increase with $k$. For $k>8$, the minimum possible dimension will also be greater than 500,000. Therefore, no partitions with $\\lambda_1 \\le 16$ (or their conjugates, which we've already counted) need to be considered.\nPartitions that are more \"square-like\" (e.g., $\\lambda=(5,5,5,5,5)$) have extremely large dimensions (in this case, > $9 \\times 10^{12}$).\nOur systematic check of partitions with large first parts (and their conjugates) is sufficient.\n\n**Step 3: Sum the results**\n\nTotal number of irreps with dimension less than 500,000 is the sum of the counts from each case:\nTotal = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 22 + 4 = 64$."
