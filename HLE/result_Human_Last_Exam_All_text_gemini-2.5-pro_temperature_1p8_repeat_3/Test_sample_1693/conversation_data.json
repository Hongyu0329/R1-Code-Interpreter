    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Ship Nationality:** French\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** German U-boat (This can be a direct torpedo attack, gunfire, or by a mine laid by a U-boat).\n    *   **Time Frame:** Between the start of World War II (September 1, 1939) and the Franco-German Armistice (signed on June 22, 1940).\n    *   **Metric:** Largest by displacement. For merchant vessels, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is often used as a standard measure of size, but displacement (the actual weight of the ship) is the specific metric requested. Generally, a higher GRT corresponds to a higher displacement.\n\n2.  **Initial Research & Filtering:**\n    The search must focus on the \"Phoney War\" and the Battle of France periods. Most major French naval losses (like the battleship *Bretagne* at Mers-el-Kébir) occurred *after* the armistice and were not caused by U-boats. Therefore, the candidates are most likely to be large merchant ships, such as ocean liners or tankers.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Candidates:**\n    We will look for large French merchant vessels sunk by U-boats in the specified time frame.\n    *   **Tanker *Emile Miguet***: Sunk on October 12, 1939, by U-boat *U-48*. At 14,115 GRT, this was one of the largest tankers in the world, but not the largest French vessel sunk.\n    *   **Liner *Bretagne*** (a ship of the Société Générale de Transport Maritimes, not to be confused with the battleship): Sunk on October 14, 1939, by U-boat *U-45*. It had a tonnage of 10,108 GRT.\n    *   **Liner SS *Champlain***: A large and modern passenger liner belonging to the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (the French Line).\n\n4.  **Focus on the Strongest Candidate: SS *Champlain***\n    *   **Size:** The SS *Champlain* had a Gross Register Tonnage of **28,124 GRT**. Its full load displacement was approximately **43,000 tons**. This makes it significantly larger than any other French ship lost during this period.\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** On June 17, 1940, off the coast of La Rochelle, the *Champlain* struck a magnetic mine. This mine had been laid earlier by the German U-boat **U-65**. An action by a U-boat directly caused the ship's loss, thus it fits the criteria of being \"sunk by a U-boat\".\n    *   **Date of Sinking:** The ship hit the mine on **June 17, 1940**. The ship did not sink immediately but was beached and eventually declared a total loss. This event occurred five days *before* the Armistice was signed on June 22, 1940.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Warship vs. Merchant Ship:** It's important to consider both categories. However, no French capital ship or cruiser was sunk by a U-boat before the armistice. The largest warship sunk was the submarine *Doris* (around 600 tons), which is vastly smaller than the merchant liners.\n*   **\"Sunk by a U-boat\" Interpretation:** The cause of sinking includes mines laid by U-boats, not just torpedoes. The loss of the *Champlain* is directly attributable to the actions of *U-65*.\n*   **Displacement vs. GRT:** The question specifies displacement. While GRT is a measure of internal volume, displacement is a measure of weight. For a large passenger liner like the *Champlain*, the displacement (approx. 43,000 tons) is significantly higher than its GRT (28,124 tons), and it remains the largest vessel by either metric when compared to other candidates.\n*   **Date is Crucial:** Many significant French maritime losses occurred in July 1940 and later, which is after the armistice. The cutoff date of June 22, 1940, is a critical filter.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy comparing the candidates, the **SS *Champlain*** is unambiguously the largest French ship by displacement (and GRT) to be sunk as a result of an action by a German U-boat before the Armistice of 22 June 1940.\n\n<<<SS Champlain>>>"
