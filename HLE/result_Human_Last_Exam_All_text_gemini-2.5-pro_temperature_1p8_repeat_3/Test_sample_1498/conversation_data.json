    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Poem's Structure:** The poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' is a concise summary of the essential tenets of Islamic faith (Aqidah). It is structured logically, moving from the attributes of Allah to the belief in His Messengers, Books, Angels, and the Last Day.\n\n2.  **Locate the Section on Prophets:** After discussing the necessary, possible, and impossible attributes of Allah, the author transitions to the topic of the Prophets (Anbiya'). This section itself has parts: an introduction to the concept of prophethood, a listing of their required attributes, and then a list of the 25 prophets whose names are mentioned in the Qur'an, belief in whom is obligatory.\n\n3.  **Identify the Introductory Verse:** The verse that explicitly introduces the list of names is crucial. In the standard numbering of the poem, **Bayt 32** serves this purpose. It states:\n    > تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\n    > كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *(The detailed knowledge of twenty-five [prophets] is binding, upon every accountable person, so verify and seize [this knowledge].)*\n    This verse clearly signals that the names of the 25 prophets are about to be listed. Therefore, the list itself begins in the verse immediately following it.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Starting Verse of the List:** The very next verse, **Bayt 33**, begins the enumeration of the prophets' names:\n    > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ\n    > صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with, Salih, and Ibrahim, each to be followed.)*\n    This is the first verse that contains the names.\n\n5.  **Follow the List to its Conclusion:** We need to continue through the poem until the list of 25 prophets is complete.\n    *   **Bayt 34** continues the list: Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 35** continues the list: Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n    *   **Bayt 36** is the final verse in the list:\n        > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n        > عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n        *(Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [Prophet Muhammad], the seal, so leave deviation.)*\n    This verse concludes the list of 25, ending with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, referred to here as 'Taha'.\n\n6.  **Confirm the End of the List:** To ensure this is the end, we check the subsequent verse. **Bayt 37** says:\n    > عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ\n    > وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n    *(Upon them be peace and blessings, and upon their families, as long as the days endure.)*\n    This verse is a general supplication (prayer) for all the prophets mentioned and is not part of the list itself. Therefore, the list of names definitively ends at Bayt 36.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The question is specific:** It asks for the verses that contain the *names* of the prophets, not the verses that introduce the topic of prophethood in general (which start a few verses earlier).\n*   **Verse 32 is introductory:** It is a preamble to the list, not part of the list of names itself. The question asks *from which bayt* the names are mentioned, which would be the verse where the first name appears.\n*   **Numbering:** The numbering of the verses (abyat) is generally standard but can have minor variations in some prints. The range of 33-36 is the most widely accepted one.\n*   **Poetic Naming:** The name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is given as 'Taha' (طه), which is one of the names/titles used for him, fitting the poem's rhyme and meter.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThe names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an are enumerated in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' starting from Bayt 33 and concluding at Bayt 36.\n\n<<<From Bayt 33 to Bayt 36.>>>"
