    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Problem and Sequences**\n    *   We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) of two 4-point sequences, x(n) and h(n).\n    *   X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]\n    *   H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]\n    *   We need to find the 4-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence, which we'll call y(n).\n    *   y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}\n\n2.  **Interpret the Goal**\n    *   The request is to find a 4-point DFT for an 8-point sequence. This implies a reduction of the sequence length from 8 to 4. In DSP, this is typically achieved through **time-aliasing** (or circular folding).\n    *   We define a new 4-point sequence, g(n), by wrapping the 8-point sequence y(n) around a circle of 4 points.\n    *   g(n) = y(n) + y(n+4) for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    *   The problem is now to find G(k), the 4-point DFT of g(n).\n\n3.  **Use DFT Properties to Simplify the Problem**\n    There are two key DFT properties that allow us to solve this without computing the inverse DFTs of X(k) and H(k).\n\n    *   **Property 1: Time-Aliasing and Frequency Decimation:** The DFT of the time-aliased sequence g(n) is equal to the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of the original sequence y(n). If Y(k) = DFT<sub>8</sub>{y(n)}, then G(k) = Y(2k) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n    *   **Property 2: DFT of an Interleaved Sequence (Decimation-in-Time):** The sequence y(n) is formed by interleaving x(n) and h(n). The 8-point DFT of y(n) can be expressed in terms of the 4-point DFTs of x(n) and h(n).\n        *   y(2m) = x(m)\n        *   y(2m+1) = h(m)\n    The formula is: Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W<sub>8</sub><sup>k</sup> * H(k mod 4), where W<sub>N</sub><sup>k</sup> = e<sup>-j2πk/N</sup>.\n\n4.  **Combine Properties and Formulate a Direct Solution**\n    We need G(k) = Y(2k). We substitute `2k` into the formula from Property 2:\n    G(k) = Y(2k) = X(2k mod 4) + W<sub>8</sub><sup>2k</sup> * H(2k mod 4)\n\n    Let's simplify the twiddle factor:\n    W<sub>8</sub><sup>2k</sup> = e<sup>-j2π(2k)/8</sup> = e<sup>-j2πk/4</sup> = W<sub>4</sub><sup>k</sup>\n\n    So, the final formula for the desired 4-point DFT G(k) is:\n    G(k) = X(2k mod 4) + W<sub>4</sub><sup>k</sup> * H(2k mod 4)\n\n5.  **Calculate G(k) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3**\n    We need the following values:\n    *   X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]\n    *   H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]\n    *   W<sub>4</sub><sup>k</sup> values: W<sub>4</sub><sup>0</sup>=1, W<sub>4</sub><sup>1</sup>=-j, W<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup>=-1, W<sub>4</sub><sup>3</sup>=j\n\n    *   **For k = 0:**\n        The index for X and H is (2*0) mod 4 = 0.\n        G(0) = X(0) + W<sub>4</sub><sup>0</sup> * H(0)\n        G(0) = 1 + (1) * (0) = 1\n\n    *   **For k = 1:**\n        The index for X and H is (2*1) mod 4 = 2.\n        G(1) = X(2) + W<sub>4</sub><sup>1</sup> * H(2)\n        G(1) = -1 + (-j) * (1) = -1 - j\n\n    *   **For k = 2:**\n        The index for X and H is (2*2) mod 4 = 0.\n        G(2) = X(0) + W<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup> * H(0)\n        G(2) = 1 + (-1) * (0) = 1\n\n    *   **For k = 3:**\n        The index for X and H is (2*3) mod 4 = 6 mod 4 = 2.\n        G(3) = X(2) + W<sub>4</sub><sup>3</sup> * H(2)\n        G(3) = -1 + (j) * (1) = -1 + j\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The primary challenge is interpreting \"4-point DFT for an 8-point sequence\". This points to time-aliasing.\n*   The most efficient solution avoids computing the time-domain signals x(n) and h(n) by using established DFT properties for time-aliasing and decimation-in-time.\n*   The index for X(k) and H(k) in the final formula G(k) is `(2k mod 4)`, which alternates between 0 and 2. It is not simply `k` or `2k`.\n*   The twiddle factor simplifies nicely from W<sub>8</sub><sup>2k</sup> to W<sub>4</sub><sup>k</sup>, simplifying the calculations.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is the sequence G(k) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nG(k) = [G(0), G(1), G(2), G(3)] = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
