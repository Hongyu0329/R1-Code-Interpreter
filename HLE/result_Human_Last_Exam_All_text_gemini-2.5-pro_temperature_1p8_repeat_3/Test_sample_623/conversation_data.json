    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Molecule and Labeling:**\n    The starting molecule is glucose. The carbons are numbered from the aldehyde group (C1) to the primary alcohol group (C6). The molecule is labeled with the heavy isotope ¹³C at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   ¹³C is at C1.\n    *   ¹³C is at C4.\n\n2.  **Identify the Metabolic Pathway:**\n    The specified pathway is **glycolysis**.\n\n3.  **Define the Scope of Glycolysis:**\n    Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one molecule of glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) into two molecules of pyruvate (a 3-carbon molecule). The net reaction is:\n    Glucose + 2 NAD⁺ + 2 ADP + 2 Pᵢ → 2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 H⁺ + 2 ATP + 2 H₂O.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Carbon Flow in Glycolysis:**\n    The core of the question is to determine if any carbon atoms are lost from the intermediates during the glycolysis pathway. Let's trace the carbon skeleton:\n    *   **Glucose (6C)** is phosphorylated and isomerized to **Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (6C)**. The carbon skeleton remains intact, so the labels are still at C1 and C4.\n    *   **Aldolase Cleavage:** Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (6C) is cleaved into two 3-carbon molecules:\n        *   Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which comes from carbons C1, C2, and C3 of glucose.\n        *   Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which comes from carbons C4, C5, and C6 of glucose.\n    *   **Isomerization:** The DHAP molecule is then isomerized to G3P by the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase.\n    *   **Payoff Phase:** Each of the two G3P molecules is converted into a pyruvate molecule. This involves several steps (oxidation, phosphorylation, dephosphorylation), but importantly, no carbon atoms are added or removed. The 3-carbon chain of G3P becomes the 3-carbon chain of pyruvate.\n\n5.  **Examine for CO₂ Production:**\n    Let's review the ten steps of glycolysis (the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway). None of the ten enzymatic reactions involves a decarboxylation step (the removal of a carboxyl group as CO₂). The carbon balance is maintained throughout: one 6-carbon molecule becomes two 3-carbon molecules.\n\n6.  **Conclusion based on the Pathway:**\n    Since the glycolysis pathway itself does not produce any CO₂ molecules, it cannot produce any ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules. The ¹³C atoms from the original glucose molecule will end up in the final product of glycolysis, which is pyruvate.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Scope of the Question:** The question specifically asks about \"glycolysis\". It does *not* ask about subsequent pathways like the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction (link reaction) or the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle), which are the stages where decarboxylation and CO₂ release occur.\n*   **Fate of the Labels (Beyond Glycolysis):** For completeness, if the process continued:\n    *   The ¹³C from glucose C4 would end up on C1 of a pyruvate molecule. This C1 is the carboxyl group that is removed as **¹³CO₂** in the link reaction (pyruvate → acetyl-CoA).\n    *   The ¹³C from glucose C1 would end up on C3 of the other pyruvate molecule. This label would be retained in acetyl-CoA and would only be released as **¹³CO₂** in a later turn of the Krebs cycle.\n*   **The Answer:** Because the question is strictly limited to the glycolysis pathway, where no CO₂ is formed, the answer is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
