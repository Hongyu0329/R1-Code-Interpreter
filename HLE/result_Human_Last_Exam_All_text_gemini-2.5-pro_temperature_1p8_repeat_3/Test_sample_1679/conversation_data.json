    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object in question - the \"Luxor Obelisk\".**\nThere are two famous obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   One obelisk remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The other obelisk was transported to France in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\nTherefore, a film that depicts either the Luxor Temple in Egypt or the Place de la Concorde in Paris would fulfill the requirement.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the search criteria.**\nWe need to find the *first* film in chronological order that meets two conditions:\n1.  It must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n2.  It must contain a scene that visually depicts either of the two Luxor Obelisks.\n\n**Step 3: Chronologically analyze the winners of the Academy Award for Best Picture.**\nWe will go through the list of winners starting from the first award ceremony and check their settings and notable scenes.\n\n*   **1927/1928: *Wings*** - This film has scenes set in Paris during World War I. While there are celebrations in the streets of Paris, there is no famous or clear shot of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk. The focus is on the characters and action, not the landmarks.\n*   **1928-1936:** The winners during this period, such as *The Broadway Melody*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Cimarron*, *Grand Hotel*, *Cavalcade*, *It Happened One Night*, *Mutiny on the Bounty*, and *The Great Ziegfeld*, are set in locations like New York, the German frontlines, the American West, Berlin, and London. None are set in Paris or Luxor.\n*   **1937: *The Life of Emile Zola*** - This biographical film is set almost entirely in Paris, France. It recounts the life of the writer Emile Zola and the famous Dreyfus Affair. To establish the setting of 19th-century Paris, the film includes various shots of the city. It contains scenes that show the Place de la Concorde, which prominently features the Luxor Obelisk. This is a very strong candidate.\n*   **1938-1950:** The winners in this period, like *Gone with the Wind*, *Casablanca*, *The Best Years of Our Lives*, etc., do not feature Paris or Luxor on screen (though *Casablanca* famously references Paris).\n*   **1951: *An American in Paris*** - This film is a celebration of Paris and extensively features its famous landmarks, including very clear shots of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk. However, it won 14 years after *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n*   **1956: *Around the World in 80 Days*** - This film shows its protagonist's journey through Paris, including a scene in the Place de la Concorde. Again, this is much later than the 1937 winner.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\nBy examining the Best Picture winners in chronological order, *The Life of Emile Zola* (winner for 1937) is the first film to be set in Paris and contain shots that depict the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde. No earlier winner is set in Paris or Luxor, Egypt.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
