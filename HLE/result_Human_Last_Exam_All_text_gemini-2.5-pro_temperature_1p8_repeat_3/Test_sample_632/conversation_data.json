    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Landmark:** Pantheon.\n    *   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature.\"\n    *   **Action & Time:** Removed by the city administration around 1950.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:**\n    *   The most prominent features of the piazza are the Pantheon itself and the Fontana del Pantheon (the fountain with the obelisk) in the center. The feature in question must be something that is no longer there.\n    *   One famous removed feature associated with the Pantheon are the two bell towers, nicknamed \"le orecchie d'asino\" (the ass's ears), which were added to the facade in the 17th century. However, these were removed much earlier, around 1883, so this is not the correct answer.\n\n3.  **Focus on the 1950 Timeline:**\n    *   The period around 1950 in Rome was marked by significant urban changes, especially regarding transportation. After World War II and in preparation for the 1950 Holy Year (Jubilee), the city undertook many projects to modernize and \"clean up\" the appearance of the historical center.\n    *   A major part of this project was the reorganization of public transportation, which involved decommissioning many tram lines in the narrow streets of central Rome and replacing them with buses.\n\n4.  **Investigate the specific feature in Piazza della Rotonda:**\n    *   Historical photographs from the first half of the 20th century show that an electric tram line passed directly through the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    *   Due to the layout of the square with the large fountain in the center, the tram line had a very unusual configuration. It formed a **circular track, or a tram ring, that went all the way around the central fountain**.\n    *   This was a highly unique feature, as it meant public transport trams were circling a 16th-century fountain directly in front of a 2,00-year-old Roman temple. This ring allowed trams to navigate and turn within the tight confines of the square.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Removal:**\n    *   This tram ring was seen as noisy, disruptive, and aesthetically clashing with the historic grandeur of the Pantheon and the piazza.\n    *   As part of the city's plan to remove trams from the historical center, the tram ring around the fountain in Piazza della Rotonda was dismantled. This took place in the late 1940s, with the project being a key focus for the 1950 Jubilee.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **\"Architectural feature\":** While a tram line is primarily infrastructure, its unique circular layout that structured the movement within the square and dominated its appearance can be considered an \"architectural\" or \"urban design\" feature in a broader sense.\n*   **The \"Ass's Ears\" Misconception:** It's important to distinguish the correct answer from the more widely known removal of the Bernini-era bell towers, which occurred much earlier. The date is the crucial clue.\n*   **The 1950 Jubilee:** This event was a major catalyst for many urban renewal projects in Rome, including the removal of the tram lines from the city's core.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe unique feature in the Piazza della Rotonda that was removed around 1950 was the **tram ring**, a circular tram track that looped around the central fountain.\n\n<<<A tram ring that encircled the central fountain.>>>"
