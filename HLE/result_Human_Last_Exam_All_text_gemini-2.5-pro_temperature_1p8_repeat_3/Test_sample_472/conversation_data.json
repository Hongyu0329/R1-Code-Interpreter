    "This question requires a metrical scansion of a line of Latin poetry, likely from Roman Comedy (in this case, Plautus), which follows the meter of a trochaic septenarius. Scanning this meter involves several specific rules beyond the basics of vowel length.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Syllabification and Initial Quantity Assessment**\n\nFirst, we break the line into syllables and determine their length (long 'L' or short 'S') based on standard Latin prosody rules.\n\n*   **`et ti-bi be-ne es-se so-li quom si-bi sit ma-le`**\n\n*   `et`: The vowel 'e' is short, but the word is followed by `tibi`. The two 't's (`e**t t**ibi`) make the syllable closed and thus long by position. **[L]**\n*   `ti-bi`: The 'i' in `ti` is short and in an open syllable. The final 'i' of `tibi` is also short. **[S S]**\n*   `be-ne`: Both 'e's are short and in open syllables. **[S S]**\n*   `es-se`: The first syllable `es-` is closed by the double consonant 'ss', making it long by position, even though the vowel 'e' is naturally short. The final 'e' of the infinitive is short. **[L S]**\n*   `so-li`: The 'o' in `solus` is naturally long. The 'i' is short. **[L S]**\n*   `quom`: This is an archaic spelling of `cum`. The vowel `o` is long. As a monosyllable ending in a consonant, it is long. **[L]**\n*   `si-bi`: Both 'i's are short. **[S S]**\n*   `sit`: The vowel 'i' is short, but it's a closed syllable (ending in 't'), so it scans as long. **[L]**\n*   `ma-le`: The 'a' and 'e' are both short. **[S S]**\n\nCombining these, we get the raw sequence of syllables: `L S S S S L S L S L S S L S S`.\n\n**2. Parsing the Line into Metrical Feet**\n\nThe line is a **trochaic septenarius**. The basic pattern of this meter consists of seven and a half trochaic feet. A trochee is a long syllable followed by a short one (L S). The line structure is:\n`L S | L S | L S | L S || L S | L S | L S | L^`\nThe `||` represents a common caesura (pause), and the `L^` is a final, incomplete half-foot. Roman comic meter allows for many substitutions and resolutions.\n\nLet's group our syllable sequence into the expected feet:\n\n*   **Foot 1**: `et ti` -> `L S`. This is a perfect **trochee**.\n*   **Foot 2**: `bi be ne` -> `S S S`. The meter requires a trochee (L S). Here, the long syllable has been \"resolved\" into two short ones (L â†’ S S), resulting in a **tribrach** (S S S). This is a very common resolution in Plautus.\n*   **Foot 3**: `es se` -> `L S`. A perfect **trochee**.\n*   **Foot 4**: `so li` -> `L S`. A perfect **trochee**. The main caesura of the line falls here.\n*   **Foot 5**: `quom si` -> `L S`. A perfect **trochee**.\n*   **Foot 6**: `bi sit` -> `S L`. The meter calls for a trochee (L S), but we have an **iamb** (S L). This substitution of an iamb for a trochee is another frequent feature of this meter.\n*   **Foot 7**: `ma le` -> `S S`. The meter requires a trochee (L S). Here we have a **pyrrhic** (S S). This is another form of substitution/resolution common at the end of a line in Plautus.\n*   The line ends here, catalectically (i.e., the final half-foot is missing).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Meter:** The line is a trochaic septenarius, a common meter in Roman comedy. Knowledge of its structure (7.5 trochaic feet) is crucial.\n2.  **Long by Position:** Remember that a syllable can be long even with a short vowel if that vowel is followed by two consonants (e.g., `et tibi`, `esse`).\n3.  **Hiatus:** There is no elision between `bene` and `esse`. A \"hiatus\" (allowing both vowels to be pronounced) is permitted in this meter for effect or convenience.\n4.  **Resolution:** A single long syllable in a foot can be replaced by two short syllables. This is seen in Foot 2 (`bi be ne`), where the L of a trochee becomes S S, creating a tribrach (S S S).\n5.  **Substitution:** A foot can be replaced by another of equivalent time value or by convention. The iamb (S L) replacing the trochee (L S) in Foot 6 (`bi sit`) is a classic example in this meter.\n6.  **Catalexis:** The line is catalectic, meaning it is \"incomplete\" and ends before the final half-foot of the metrical pattern is finished.\n\n### Final Answer Construction\n\nBy assembling the feet identified above and placing a space between each, we arrive at the final scansion.\n\n*   Foot 1: `L S`\n*   Foot 2: `S S S`\n*   Foot 3: `L S`\n*   Foot 4: `L S`\n*   Foot 5: `L S`\n*   Foot 6: `S L`\n*   Foot 7: `S S`\n\nThis yields the complete scansion for the line.\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L S L S S L S S>>>"
