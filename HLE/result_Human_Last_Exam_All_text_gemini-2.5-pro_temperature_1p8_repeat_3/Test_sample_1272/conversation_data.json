    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Figure and Context:** The question focuses on Ming Dynasty General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and his military campaigns in Vietnam. The most relevant period for a \"major defeat\" is the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), when the Vietnamese, led by Lê Lợi, fought to end Ming rule.\n\n2.  **Examine Mu Sheng's Campaigns in Vietnam:**\n    *   Mu Sheng was involved in the initial successful Ming invasion of Vietnam in 1406-1407. This campaign was a victory, so his first major defeat did not occur then.\n    *   He also participated in earlier phases of the campaign against the Lam Sơn rebellion but did not suffer a decisive, large-scale defeat during that time.\n    *   The pivotal moment came in late 1427. The main Ming army in Vietnam was besieged in Dongguan (modern-day Hanoi). The Ming Emperor sent two massive reinforcement armies to relieve the siege. One army was led by General Liu Sheng, and the second army was led by General Mu Sheng.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the Specific Defeat:**\n    *   The first army, under Liu Sheng, was catastrophically defeated and its commander killed at the Battle of Chi Lăng in modern Lạng Sơn Province.\n    *   Mu Sheng was leading his army of about 50,000 soldiers from Yunnan province in China down along the Red River (Sông Hồng). When news of Liu Sheng's complete annihilation reached him, he became terrified and immediately ordered a retreat back to China.\n    *   This is where Mu Sheng's own defeat occurred. His retreat was not orderly. The Vietnamese forces, specifically the armies commanded by generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, had been dispatched to intercept him. They pursued his fleeing army.\n\n4.  **Locate the Site of the Battle:**\n    *   The Vietnamese forces caught up with Mu Sheng's panicked army and attacked them decisively.\n    *   Historical records pinpoint the key locations where Mu Sheng's army was routed as Lãnh Câu Pass (Ải Lãnh Câu) and Đan Xá fort (thành Đan Xá).\n    *   These battles turned the Ming retreat into a disastrous rout with heavy casualties. This event marked the complete failure of the Ming reinforcement effort and was unequivocally Mu Sheng's first major, personal defeat in this war.\n\n5.  **Connect Historical Locations to a Modern Province:**\n    *   By tracing the historical path of Mu Sheng's advance and retreat along the Red River and identifying the locations of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá, we can place them in modern-day Vietnam.\n    *   These historical battle sites are located within the territory of the current **Yên Bái Province**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing from Liu Sheng's Defeat:** It is crucial not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with the more famous defeat of Liu Sheng at Chi Lăng. They were two separate events in two different locations involving two different Ming armies.\n*   **Defining \"Major Defeat\":** While Mu Sheng may have had earlier setbacks, the 1427 rout of his large relief army, leading to its near-total disintegration and the failure of a critical strategic objective, qualifies as his first \"major defeat.\"\n*   **Confirming the Province:** The location must be the modern province, not a historical administrative division like Tuyên Quang prefecture. The battle sites of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá fall squarely within present-day Yên Bái Province.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe first major defeat of Ming General Mu Sheng occurred in 1427 when his retreating army was ambushed and routed by Vietnamese forces at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá. These locations are situated in the modern-day Vietnamese province of Yên Bái.\n\n<<<Yên Bái Province>>>"
