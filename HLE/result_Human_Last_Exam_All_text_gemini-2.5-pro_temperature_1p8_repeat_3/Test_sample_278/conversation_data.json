    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the parametric curve definition.**\nThe curve is defined in a piecewise manner based on the parameter `t`:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$: $x = \\cos t$, $y = \\sin t$.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$: $x = \\cos t$, $y = 5\\sin t$.\n\nThe goal is to find the area of the smallest square that can enclose the entire figure described by this curve.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first part of the curve ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$).**\n*   The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n*   These are the standard parametric equations for a circle. We can verify this by observing that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin (0,0).\n*   The range of `t` is $[0, \\pi]$. Let's find the range of x and y in this interval:\n    *   For $x = \\cos t$: As `t` goes from 0 to $\\pi$, `x` goes from $\\cos(0) = 1$ to $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$. So, the x-values span the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   For $y = \\sin t$: As `t` goes from 0 to $\\pi$, `y` starts at $\\sin(0)=0$, increases to a maximum of $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$, and decreases back to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$. So, the y-values span the interval $[0, 1]$.\n*   This part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of radius 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second part of the curve ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$).**\n*   The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n*   These are the parametric equations for an ellipse. We can find its Cartesian form: $\\frac{x^2}{1^2} + \\frac{y^2}{5^2} = \\cos^2 t + \\frac{(5\\sin t)^2}{25} = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is an ellipse centered at the origin (0,0) with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n*   The range of `t` is $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$. Let's find the range of x and y in this interval:\n    *   For $x = \\cos t$: As `t` goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, `x` goes from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$. So, the x-values span the interval $(-1, 1)$.\n    *   For $y = 5\\sin t$: As `t` goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $\\sin t$ is negative. `y` starts just below $5\\sin(\\pi)=0$, decreases to a minimum of $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = 5(-1) = -5$, and increases back towards $5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$. So, the y-values span the interval $[-5, 0)$.\n*   This part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the bounding box for the entire figure.**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum x and y coordinates for the entire curve. This defines the smallest rectangle (the \"bounding box\") that contains the figure.\n\n*   **x-range**: Combining the range from both parts, $x \\in [-1, 1] \\cup (-1, 1) = [-1, 1]$.\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$\n*   **y-range**: Combining the range from both parts, $y \\in [0, 1] \\cup [-5, 0) = [-5, 1]$.\n    *   $y_{min} = -5$\n    *   $y_{max} = 1$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box.**\n*   The width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   The height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square.**\nThe smallest square that can enclose the figure must have a side length equal to the larger dimension of the bounding box.\n*   Side length of the square, $S = \\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height})$.\n*   $S = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the area of the square.**\nThe area of a square with side length $S$ is given by $A = S^2$.\n*   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   Recognize that the parameter `b` changes, creating a piecewise curve made of a semi-circle and a semi-ellipse.\n*   Carefully determine the range of x and y for each piece by analyzing the trigonometric functions over their respective intervals.\n*   Combine the ranges to find the overall maximum and minimum coordinates, which define the bounding box of the complete figure.\n*   Remember that the side of the enclosing *square* must be equal to the *maximum* of the bounding box's width and height.\n*   The final step is to square the side length to get the area.\n\n<<<36>>>"
