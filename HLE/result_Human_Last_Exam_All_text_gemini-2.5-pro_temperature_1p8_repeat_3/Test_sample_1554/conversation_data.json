    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core of the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific philosopher belonging to the Lviv-Warsaw School. The key characteristic of this philosopher is their work on decomposing the general concept of a \"hallmark\" (or a sign) into two distinct categories: \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n**Step 2: Define the Lviv-Warsaw School**\nThe Lviv-Warsaw School was an influential school of logic and philosophy in Poland during the interwar period (1920s-1930s). It was founded by Kazimierz Twardowski. Its members are known for their contributions to formal logic, semantics, philosophy of language, and analytic philosophy. Key figures include Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Conceptual Distinction: Hallmark, Symptoms, and Signals**\nThis is a semiotic distinction, dealing with the theory of signs.\n*   **Hallmark:** This can be understood as a general term for an indicator, a sign, or a characteristic mark.\n*   **Symptom (Natural Sign):** This type of sign has a natural, often causal, connection to the thing it signifies. The connection is not based on human agreement or rules. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness.\n*   **Signal (Conventional Sign):** This type of sign has a meaning based on a rule, convention, or agreement. The connection is arbitrary and culturally established. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"cat\" is a signal for the furry animal.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Potential Candidates from the Lviv-Warsaw School**\nWe need to find which philosopher from this school focused on this particular semiotic distinction.\n*   **Kazimierz Twardowski:** As the founder, he laid much of the groundwork in philosophy of mind and language, but this specific distinction is more characteristic of his students.\n*   **Tadeusz Kotarbiński:** He was primarily known for his ontology (reism/concretism) and praxiology (the theory of efficient action). While related, his central focus was not on this semiotic decomposition.\n*   **Jan Łukasiewicz & Alfred Tarski:** They were primarily brilliant logicians. Tarski's work on the semantic theory of truth is a landmark, but it doesn't center on the symptom/signal distinction in this manner.\n*   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz:** He was a central figure in the philosophy of language and epistemology within the school. A core part of his work involved analyzing the nature of language and meaning. He explicitly developed a theory of signs that makes a fundamental distinction between what he called `oznaka` (a natural sign, or symptom) and `znak` (a conventional sign, or signal, of which language is the prime example). This distinction was crucial for his later theories, such as radical conventionalism.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe philosopher who is famous for analyzing signs and distinguishing between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) within the Lviv-Warsaw School is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. His work, particularly in essays collected in \"Language and Meaning,\" elaborates on this very decomposition.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
