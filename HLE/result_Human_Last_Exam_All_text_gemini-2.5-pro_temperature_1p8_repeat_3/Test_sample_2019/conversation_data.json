    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints\nA toroidal chessboard means the board wraps around on its edges, both horizontally and vertically. For a 5x5 board, this can be modeled using arithmetic modulo 5. A queen at position (r, c), where r is the row and c is the column (both from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}), attacks any square (r', c') if:\n1.  r = r' (same row)\n2.  c = c' (same column)\n3.  r - c ≡ r' - c' (mod 5) (same \"main\" diagonal)\n4.  r + c ≡ r' + c' (mod 5) (same \"anti-\" diagonal)\n\nWe need to place 4 queens, let's call their positions (r_i, c_i) for i=1, 2, 3, 4. For the queens to be non-attacking, all of their positions must be distinct, and for any two distinct queens i and j:\n*   `r_i` must be distinct.\n*   `c_i` must be distinct.\n*   `r_i - c_i (mod 5)` must be distinct.\n*   `r_i + c_i (mod 5)` must be distinct.\n\n### Step 2: A Change of Coordinates\nThe conditions on the diagonals are complicated when tied to the row and column coordinates. We can simplify the problem by changing our coordinate system. Let's define a new coordinate pair (d, s) for each square (r, c):\n*   d = r - c (mod 5)\n*   s = r + c (mod 5)\n\nThis transformation is invertible. We can recover (r, c) from (d, s):\n*   d + s = 2r (mod 5)  => r = 3(d + s) (mod 5) (since 3 is the multiplicative inverse of 2 in mod 5, 2*3=6≡1)\n*   s - d = 2c (mod 5)  => c = 3(s - d) (mod 5)\n\nEach of the 25 squares on the board (r,c) maps to a unique coordinate pair (d,s).\n\nIn this new (d,s) system, the four conditions for placing 4 non-attacking queens become:\n1.  The set of 4 `r` coordinates, `{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4}`, must have 4 distinct values.\n2.  The set of 4 `c` coordinates, `{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4}`, must have 4 distinct values.\n3.  The set of 4 `d` coordinates, `{d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4}`, must have 4 distinct values.\n4.  The set of 4 `s` coordinates, `{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4}`, must have 4 distinct values.\n\nThis means a valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens corresponds to choosing 4 points `(d_i, s_i)` in the (d,s) plane, such that when we transform them back to (r,c) coordinates, the r-values are distinct and the c-values are distinct.\n\n### Step 3: Counting in the (d,s) Coordinate System\nLet's build a valid configuration in the (d,s) space.\n1.  **Choose the main diagonals (d-coordinates):** We need to choose 4 distinct values for `d` out of the 5 possible values {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The number of ways to do this is C(5, 4) = 5. Let this set be D.\n2.  **Choose the anti-diagonals (s-coordinates):** We need to choose 4 distinct values for `s` out of the 5 possible values. The number of ways to do this is C(5, 4) = 5. Let this set be S.\n3.  **Pair them up:** We have 4 chosen d-coordinates (from D) and 4 chosen s-coordinates (from S). We need to form 4 pairs `(d_i, s_i)`. Since each `d_i` and `s_i` must be used exactly once, this is equivalent to defining a bijection (a permutation) `p: D -> S`. There are 4! = 24 such bijections.\n\nNow, we must check for which of these bijections the derived `r` and `c` coordinates are distinct.\nLet's fix a choice of D and S, for example, D = {0, 1, 2, 3} and S = {0, 1, 2, 3}. Let `p` be a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3}. The four chosen points are `(i, p(i))` for i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}.\nThe conditions are:\n*   The set of `r` values, `{3(i + p(i)) mod 5}`, must be distinct. This is equivalent to `{i + p(i) mod 5}` being distinct.\n*   The set of `c` values, `{3(p(i) - i) mod 5}`, must be distinct. This is equivalent to `{p(i) - i mod 5}` being distinct.\n\nLet's test all 24 permutations `p` of {0, 1, 2, 3}:\n1.  p = (1, 3, 0, 2):\n    *   `i + p(i)` (mod 5): {0+1, 1+3, 2+0, 3+2} = {1, 4, 2, 5} ≡ {1, 4, 2, 0}. All distinct. **OK**.\n    *   `p(i) - i` (mod 5): {1-0, 3-1, 0-2, 2-3} = {1, 2, -2, -1} ≡ {1, 2, 3, 4}. All distinct. **OK**.\n    *   This permutation represents a valid placement.\n\n2.  p = (2, 0, 3, 1):\n    *   `i + p(i)` (mod 5): {0+2, 1+0, 2+3, 3+1} = {2, 1, 5, 4} ≡ {2, 1, 0, 4}. All distinct. **OK**.\n    *   `p(i) - i` (mod 5): {2-0, 0-1, 3-2, 1-3} = {2, -1, 1, -2} ≡ {2, 4, 1, 3}. All distinct. **OK**.\n    *   This permutation also represents a valid placement.\n\nChecking all 24 permutations reveals that these are the only two that satisfy both conditions for D={0,1,2,3} and S={0,1,2,3}. So, for this specific choice of D and S, there are `k=2` ways to form a valid set of queens.\n\n### Step 4: Generalizing the Count\nWe need to confirm that this number `k=2` is the same regardless of our choice for the sets D and S.\nLet D' = D + a = {d+a | d in D} and S' = S + b = {s+b | s in S}. Let `p: D -> S` be a valid bijection. Define a new bijection `p': D' -> S'` by `p'(d+a) = p(d)+b`.\nThe new sums are `(d+a) + p'(d+a) = (d+a) + (p(d)+b) = (d+p(d)) + (a+b)`. Since `d+p(d)` were all distinct, shifting them all by a constant `a+b` preserves their distinctness.\nThe new differences are `p'(d+a) - (d+a) = (p(d)+b) - (d+a) = (p(d)-d) + (b-a)`. Similarly, shifting by `b-a` preserves distinctness.\nThus, the number of valid bijections `k` is independent of the choice of the sets D and S. It is always 2.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nWe can now calculate the total number of ways:\n*   Number of ways to choose the 4 main diagonals (set D) = C(5, 4) = 5.\n*   Number of ways to choose the 4 anti-diagonals (set S) = C(5, 4) = 5.\n*   Number of valid ways to pair them up (the number `k`) = 2.\n\nTotal number of ways = (Ways to choose D) × (Ways to choose S) × k\nTotal number of ways = 5 × 5 × 2 = 50.\n\n<<<50>>>"
