    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z.\n\n### Step 1: Interpreting the Question and the Hamiltonian\nThe question asks for the partition function Z in the grand canonical ensemble for a system with Hamiltonian `H^ = -μN^`.\n\n1.  **Grand Canonical Ensemble:** The partition function is generally given by `Z = Tr[e^(-β(H_sys - μ_res N))]`, where `H_sys` is the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian, `N` is the particle number operator, `μ_res` is the chemical potential of the reservoir the system is in contact with, and `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n2.  **Interpreting `H^ = -μN^`:** There are two common interpretations:\n    *   `H^` is the intrinsic Hamiltonian `H_sys`. In this case, the operator in the exponent would be `H_sys - μ_res N = -μN - μ_res N = -(μ + μ_res)N`. The calculation proceeds with an effective chemical potential `μ_eff = μ + μ_res`.\n    *   `H^` represents the full operator in the exponent, i.e., `H_sys - μ_res N` is given as `-μN`. This implies the intrinsic Hamiltonian `H_sys` is zero, and the system is characterized by a single chemical potential `μ`. This is a more direct interpretation of the question's notation and avoids ambiguity.\n\nWe will proceed with the second interpretation, as it is more straightforward. The task is to calculate the partition function `Z` corresponding to the statistical operator `ρ ∝ e^(βμN)`.\nSo, we need to calculate `Z = Tr[e^(βμN)]`.\n\n### Step 2: Path Integral Formalism\nWe want to calculate `Z = Tr[e^(-βK)]` where the operator is `K = -μN`. The path integral representation of this partition function is `Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] e^(-S)`, where `S` is the Euclidean action.\n\n1.  **Euclidean Action:** The general form of the action is `S = ∫dτ [ψ*∂_τψ + K(ψ*, ψ)]`, where `K(ψ*, ψ)` is the second-quantized form of the operator `K`.\n2.  **Our Action:** The second-quantized form of `K = -μN` is `K(ψ*, ψ) = -μ ∫d^d x ψ*(x)ψ(x)`. Substituting this into the action gives:\n    `S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ ψ*(x,τ)∂_τψ(x,τ) - μ ψ*(x,τ)ψ(x,τ) ]`\n    `S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ*(x,τ) (∂_τ - μ) ψ(x,τ)`\n3.  **Dependence on Statistics:** The evaluation of this path integral depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions, as this determines the nature of the fields `ψ` and the boundary conditions in the imaginary time `τ`. The question does not specify the particle statistics, so we must consider both cases. Let `M` be the number of distinct single-particle states available to the system.\n\n### Step 3: Case 1 - Bosons\n1.  **Field and Path Integral:** For bosons, the fields `φ` are complex-valued scalar fields. They must be periodic in imaginary time, `φ(x, 0) = φ(x, β)`, which leads to bosonic Matsubara frequencies `ω_n = 2πn/β` for integer `n`. The path integral over complex fields evaluates to the inverse of the determinant of the operator in the action.\n    `Z_B = [det(∂_τ - μ)]^(-1)`\n2.  **Evaluating the Determinant:** The logarithm of the partition function is easier to work with:\n    `ln(Z_B) = -ln[det(∂_τ - μ)] = -Tr[ln(∂_τ - μ)]`\n    The trace is a sum over all single-particle states (indexed by `k`) and all Matsubara frequencies (`n`). In the Fourier basis, the operator `(∂_τ - μ)` has eigenvalues `(iω_n - μ)`.\n    `ln(Z_B) = - Σ_k Σ_n ln(iω_n - μ)`\n3.  **Result of the Sum:** The evaluation of the sum over Matsubara frequencies is a standard result in many-body physics. For non-interacting bosons with single-particle energies `ε_k`, the general result is `ln Z = -Σ_k ln(1 - e^(-β(ε_k - μ)))`. In our problem, the intrinsic Hamiltonian is zero, so all single-particle energies are `ε_k = 0`.\n    `ln(Z_B) = - Σ_{k=1 to M} ln(1 - e^(βμ))`\n    `ln(Z_B) = -M ln(1 - e^(βμ))`\n4.  **Final Partition Function (Bosons):** Exponentiating the result gives the partition function:\n    `Z_B = [1 / (1 - e^(βμ))]^M`\n5.  **Careful Point:** For the geometric series summed to get this result to converge, we require `e^(βμ) < 1`. Since `β > 0`, this implies `μ < 0`. If `μ ≥ 0`, the partition function diverges, which signals that the state with infinite particle number has the lowest \"grand potential\" energy.\n\n### Step 4: Case 2 - Fermions\n1.  **Field and Path Integral:** For fermions, the fields `ψ` are anti-commuting Grassmann variables. They must be anti-periodic in imaginary time, `ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β)`, which leads to fermionic Matsubara frequencies `ω_n = (2n+1)π/β` for integer `n`. The path integral over Grassmann variables evaluates to the determinant of the operator.\n    `Z_F = det(∂_τ - μ)`\n2.  **Evaluating the Determinant:** Taking the logarithm:\n    `ln(Z_F) = ln[det(∂_τ - μ)] = Tr[ln(∂_τ - μ)]`\n    `ln(Z_F) = Σ_k Σ_n ln(iω_n - μ)`\n3.  **Result of the Sum:** The standard result for this sum for non-interacting fermions with single-particle energies `ε_k` is `ln Z = Σ_k ln(1 + e^(-β(ε_k - μ)))`. Again, we set `ε_k = 0`.\n    `ln(Z_F) = Σ_{k=1 to M} ln(1 + e^(βμ))`\n    `ln(Z_F) = M ln(1 + e^(βμ))`\n4.  **Final Partition Function (Fermions):** Exponentiating the result gives:\n    `Z_F = [1 + e^(βμ)]^M`\n5.  **Careful Point:** This expression is well-defined and convergent for all real values of the chemical potential `μ`, consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle which prevents infinite occupation of any state.\n\n### Final Answer\nSince the problem does not specify the particle statistics (bosons or fermions), we provide the answer for both cases. Let M be the number of available single-particle quantum states.\n\nFor **bosons**, the partition function is:\n$Z_B = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}} \\right)^M$, which requires $\\mu < 0$ for convergence.\n\nFor **fermions**, the partition function is:\n$Z_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^M$\n\n<<<For bosons: $Z_B = [1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}]^{-M}$ (valid for $\\mu < 0$). For fermions: $Z_F = [1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}]^M$.>>>"
