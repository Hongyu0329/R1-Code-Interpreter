No, this approach is not valid. The primary ecological function of this type of mimicry is to present a common warning signal to predators, which are mainly birds. Avian vision is fundamentally different from human vision, particularly in its ability to perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which is a key component of bumblebee coloration. Therefore, human-perceived similarity is not an appropriate proxy for the predator-perceived similarity that drives the evolution of these mimicry syndromes. Additionally, the use of unstandardized "field images" introduces significant confounding variables (like lighting and background) that would compromise the reliability of the similarity rankings.
