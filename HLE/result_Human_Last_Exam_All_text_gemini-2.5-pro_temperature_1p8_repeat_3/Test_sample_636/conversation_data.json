    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain `F`.\n\n### Analysis of the Question and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` that places the eigenvalues (poles) of the closed-loop system `A + BF` at the specified locations `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n2.  **System Definition**: The system is described by the state-space matrices:\n    *   State matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n    *   Input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n3.  **Matrix Dimensions**: The matrices `A` and `B` are both 2x2. The state vector `x` is 2x1. The control law is of the form `u = Fx`, which means the closed-loop system dynamics are `x_dot = Ax + B(Fx) = (A + BF)x`. For the matrix multiplication `BF` to be valid and result in a 2x2 matrix that can be added to `A`, the feedback gain `F` must be a 2x2 matrix. Let `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\n4.  **Controllability Check**: A prerequisite for being able to place the closed-loop poles arbitrarily is that the system must be controllable. A system is controllable if its controllability matrix `C = [B, AB]` has full rank (rank `n`, where `n` is the number of states).\n    *   For this 2x2 system, `n=2`. We need to check if `rank(C) = 2`.\n    *   The matrix `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]` has a determinant `det(B) = (1)(0) - (2)(1) = -2 ≠ 0`. Since `B` itself has rank 2, the controllability matrix `C` which contains `B` as a submatrix will also have rank 2.\n    *   Therefore, the system is controllable, and a matrix `F` that achieves the desired pole placement exists.\n5.  **Non-Uniqueness of Solution**: The characteristic equation of a 2x2 matrix provides two equations (by comparing coefficients). However, the matrix `F` has four unknown elements (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This means we have an underdetermined system of equations, leading to an infinite number of possible solutions for `F`. This is a common characteristic of multi-input systems.\n6.  **Strategy for a Solution**: To find a specific solution, we can simplify the problem by imposing additional constraints. A common technique is to reduce the multi-input system to a single-input system by assuming one of the inputs is not used. This is equivalent to setting one of the rows of `F` to zero. This reduces the number of unknowns to two, allowing for a unique solution for the simplified problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation of the Feedback Gain F\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`. The desired characteristic polynomial `P_des(s)` is formed from these roots:\n`P_des(s) = (s - p1)(s - p2)`\n`P_des(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`P_des(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\n`P_des(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`P_des(s) = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n`P_des(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Problem and Form the Closed-Loop Matrix `A_cl`**\nLet's find one solution by setting the second row of `F` to zero.\nLet `F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`.\nNow, we compute the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [0, 0]] = [[1*f1 + 2*0, 1*f2 + 2*0], [1*f1 + 0*0, 1*f2 + 0*0]] = [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]] = [[f1 - 1, f2 + 1], [f1 + 1, f2]]`\n\n**Step 3: Find the Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`**\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `det(sI - A_cl)`:\n`det(sI - A_cl) = det([[s - (f1 - 1), -(f2 + 1)], [-(f1 + 1), s - f2]])`\n`det(sI - A_cl) = (s - f1 + 1)(s - f2) - (f2 + 1)(f1 + 1)`\n`= s^2 - s*f2 - s*f1 + f1*f2 + s - f2 - (f1*f2 + f1 + f2 + 1)`\n`= s^2 + s(1 - f1 - f2) + f1*f2 - f2 - f1*f2 - f1 - f2 - 1`\n`= s^2 + (1 - f1 - f2)s + (-f1 - 2*f2 - 1)`\n\n**Step 4: Equate Coefficients and Solve for `f1` and `f2`**\nWe now equate the coefficients of our calculated polynomial with the desired polynomial, `s^2 + 2s + 2`.\n\n*   Comparing the `s^1` coefficients:\n    `1 - f1 - f2 = 2`\n    `-f1 - f2 = 1`\n    `f1 + f2 = -1`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   Comparing the `s^0` (constant) coefficients:\n    `-f1 - 2*f2 - 1 = 2`\n    `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n    `f1 + 2*f2 = -3` (Equation 2)\n\nNow we solve the system of two linear equations for `f1` and `f2`:\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(f1 + 2*f2) - (f1 + f2) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` into Equation 1:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\n**Step 5: State the Final Answer**\nWe found `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, and we had set `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`. Therefore, a state feedback gain matrix that places the eigenvalues at the desired locations is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Verification (Optional)**\nLet's quickly check our answer.\n`A_cl = [[f1 - 1, f2 + 1], [f1 + 1, f2]] = [[1 - 1, -2 + 1], [1 + 1, -2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation of this matrix is `det(sI - A_cl) = s(s+2) - (-1)(2) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\nThe roots of this equation are `s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = -1 ± j`, which matches our desired eigenvalues.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
