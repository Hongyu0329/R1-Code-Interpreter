    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Phenomenon - Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\n\nSPDC is a quantum optical process rooted in nonlinear optics. In this process, a high-energy \"pump\" photon, traveling through a suitable nonlinear medium, spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons, conventionally named the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons. This process must adhere to the laws of conservation:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The energy of the pump photon is equal to the sum of the energies of the signal and idler photons ($E_{pump} = E_{signal} + E_{idler}$).\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (Phase Matching):** The momentum vector of the pump photon must equal the sum of the momentum vectors of the signal and idler photons ($\\vec{k}_{pump} = \\vec{k}_{signal} + \\vec{k}_{idler}$).\n\nThe crucial point is that SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical process**. The interaction is mediated by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as **χ⁽²⁾** (chi-two).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Material Requirement for SPDC**\n\nFor a material to facilitate a second-order nonlinear process like SPDC, it must possess a **non-zero χ⁽²⁾**. There is a fundamental constraint on which materials can have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, and it is based on crystal symmetry.\n\n*   **Symmetry Rule:** A material can only have a non-zero bulk electric dipole χ⁽²⁾ if its crystal structure lacks a center of inversion. Such materials are called **non-centrosymmetric**.\n*   **Centrosymmetric Materials:** In a material with a center of inversion (centrosymmetric), applying an electric field $\\vec{E}$ and its inverse $-\\vec{E}$ must produce polarizations that are also inverses of each other ($P(\\vec{E}) = -P(-\\vec{E})$). However, the second-order polarization term depends on the square of the field ($P^{(2)} \\propto \\chi^{(2)} \\vec{E}^2$). When the field is inverted, $P^{(2)}(-\\vec{E}) \\propto \\chi^{(2)} (-\\vec{E})^2 = \\chi^{(2)} \\vec{E}^2 = P^{(2)}(\\vec{E})$. To satisfy both conditions simultaneously, the second-order susceptibility $\\chi^{(2)}$ must be zero.\n\nTherefore, the central question is whether free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and Symmetry of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\nBoron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are two-dimensional allotropes of boron. Unlike graphene, which has a single stable honeycomb structure, borophene is polymorphic, meaning it can exist in several different structural phases. The most commonly studied and synthesized phases are:\n\n*   **β₁₂-sheet:** This phase has an orthorhombic unit cell and belongs to the space group *Pmmn* (No. 59).\n*   **χ₃-sheet:** This phase also has an orthorhombic unit cell and belongs to the space group *Cmcm* (No. 63).\n*   **Striped-phase:** Another theoretically predicted stable phase, which also belongs to the space group *Pmmn*.\n\nTo determine if these structures can exhibit SPDC, we must check if their space groups correspond to a centrosymmetric crystal class.\n*   The space group *Pmmn* belongs to the point group *mmm* (or D₂h in Schoenflies notation).\n*   The space group *Cmcm* also belongs to the point group *mmm* (or D₂h).\n\nThe point group *mmm* possesses a center of inversion. Therefore, all these common, stable phases of borophene are **centrosymmetric**.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Findings and Form a Conclusion**\n\n1.  SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect requiring a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n2.  A non-zero χ⁽²⁾ is only possible in materials that lack inversion symmetry (are non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), such as β₁₂, χ₃, and the striped phase, are all structurally centrosymmetric.\n4.  Because borophene is centrosymmetric, its bulk electric dipole χ⁽²⁾ is necessarily zero.\n5.  Consequently, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit the standard, bulk phenomenon of spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Edges and Defects:** While the bulk of an ideal, infinite nanosheet is centrosymmetric, the edges of a finite-sized sheet or the presence of certain defects and strains can locally break this inversion symmetry. This could theoretically lead to a very weak SPDC signal originating from these specific sites, but it would not be an intrinsic property of the material as a whole and the overall efficiency would be extremely low, likely negligible.\n*   **Higher-Order Processes:** Centrosymmetric materials like borophene can exhibit third-order nonlinear effects (governed by χ⁽³⁾), such as third-harmonic generation and spontaneous four-wave mixing. The latter is sometimes called \"third-order SPDC\" but is a distinct process involving two pump photons, not one. The standard term \"SPDC\" almost universally refers to the second-order process.\n*   **Hypothetical Phases:** While the known stable phases are centrosymmetric, it is theoretically possible that other, less stable, non-centrosymmetric phases of borophene could exist. However, based on the current understanding of the material, the answer should focus on the established structures.\n\n### Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Initial Question:** When excited by incident light, would free-standing boron nanosheets be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion?\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\n2.  The fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit any second-order nonlinear process is that it must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n3.  A material's bulk χ⁽²⁾ can only be non-zero if its crystal lattice lacks a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n4.  The established stable structures of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, possess crystal structures that are centrosymmetric (belonging to the *mmm* point group).\n5.  Since the material is centrosymmetric, its bulk χ⁽²⁾ is zero by symmetry.\n6.  With a χ⁽²⁾ of zero, the material cannot mediate SPDC.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n<<<No, because the stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure for the material to have the necessary non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).>>>"
