No, because the stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure for the material to have the necessary non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).
