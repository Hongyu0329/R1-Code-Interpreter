    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the genus of mushroom known for a blue spore print.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific \"single genus of mushroom\" based on a unique characteristic: a \"distinctly blue spore print\".\n\n2.  **Understand \"Spore Print\":** A spore print is a crucial diagnostic tool in mycology. It's the color of a mushroom's spores when viewed in a large, powdered deposit. This is different from the color of the mushroom's cap, stem, or gills, and also different from any color the mushroom's flesh might turn when bruised or cut (e.g., the bluing boletes).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Common Spore Print Colors:** Standard spore print colors include white, cream, yellow, pink/salmon, various shades of brown (ochre, rusty, cinnamon), purple-brown, and black. Blue is not on the standard list, indicating it is extremely rare.\n\n4.  **Initial Research and Elimination of False Leads:**\n    *   **Bluing Boletes:** Genera like *Gyroporus* (e.g., *Gyroporus cyanescens*) and many species in *Boletus* are famous for their flesh instantly turning blue when cut or bruised. However, their spore prints are typically yellow to olive-brown. This is not the correct answer.\n    *   ***Lactarius indigo*:** This is a famous, strikingly blue mushroom. Even the latex (\"milk\") it bleeds when cut is indigo blue. However, its spore print is yellowish to cream-colored. This is also not the correct answer.\n    *   ***Entoloma hochstetteri*:** This is a vibrantly blue mushroom from New Zealand. Its fame (it's on the country's $50 note) often leads people to think it has blue spores. However, its spore print is pinkish-brown. This is also a false lead.\n\n5.  **Focusing on the Correct Genus:**\n    *   Research into rare spore colors consistently points to one specific genus. While most species in this genus do not have blue spores, it is recognized as the *only* genus that contains species that do.\n    *   This genus is **Entoloma**.\n    *   The family *Entolomataceae*, to which this genus belongs, is defined by its typically pink and angular spores. The name *Entoloma* itself hints at this (Entos = within, Loma = fringe, referring to the gills being attached).\n    *   However, within this very large and diverse genus, a small number of species have been discovered that produce a spore print that is distinctly grayish-blue. This is an exception to the rule for the genus, but it makes the genus unique in the fungal kingdom.\n\n6.  **Confirmation with Specific Species:** The existence of a blue spore print in this genus is confirmed by species such as:\n    *   ***Entoloma indigosporum*:** Its species name literally means \"indigo-spored\". Scientific papers describe its spore print as \"pure greyish-blue\".\n    *   ***Entoloma lazulinum*:** This species is also noted for having a light gray-blue spore print.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** While blue flesh, blue staining, and blue caps appear in several mushroom genera, the trait of producing a blue *spore print* is known to occur only within the genus *Entoloma*.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Distinction is Key:** It is critical to differentiate between the spore print color and the color of the mushroom's body or its bruising reaction. The question is very specific about the spore print.\n*   **Rarity:** Blue spore prints are exceptionally rare. This characteristic is found in only a few species within the correct genus; it is not a feature of the entire genus.\n*   **Color Nuance:** The blue color is often described as a \"grayish-blue\" or \"steel-blue\" rather than a vibrant, sky blue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the single genus of mushroom known to contain species that produce a distinctly blue spore print is *Entoloma*.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
