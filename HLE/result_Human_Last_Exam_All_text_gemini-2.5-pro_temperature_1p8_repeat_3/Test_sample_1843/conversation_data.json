    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\nSo, $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nIn this case, a primitive character $\\chi$ modulo $36036$ has the form:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere each $\\chi_q$ is a primitive Dirichlet character with conductor $q$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe need to find the number of such tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ for which this lcm is exactly 6.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power Factor\n\nFor the lcm to be 6, the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_q)$, must be a divisor of 6. That is, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_q) \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. Since characters must be primitive, their order cannot be 1. So we are looking for primitive characters with orders in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nLet's find the number of primitive characters for each modulus $q$ and their possible orders.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=4=2^2$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order 2. There are $\\phi(4)=2$ characters. One is the principal character (non-primitive, conductor 1). The other is a primitive character of order 2.\n    - Number of primitive characters: 1.\n    - Order of this character: 2.\n    Since $2$ divides $6$, this character is a valid component. We have **1 choice** for $\\chi_4$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=9=3^2$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(9)=6$. The non-primitive characters are those induced by characters modulo 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ such characters (of orders 1 and 2). The remaining $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$ characters are primitive. Their orders must be divisors of 6 but not divisors of 2. So, their orders must be 3 or 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both orders (3 and 6) divide 6. So all 4 primitive characters are valid components. We have $2+2 = \\textbf{4}$ choices for $\\chi_9$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=7$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. A character is primitive if it is non-trivial. There are $\\phi(7)-1=5$ primitive characters. Their orders are the divisors of 6 other than 1, which are 2, 3, and 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    All these orders divide 6. So all 5 primitive characters are valid components. We have $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$ choices for $\\chi_7$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=11$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. There are $\\phi(11)-1=9$ primitive characters. Their orders are the divisors of 10 other than 1, which are 2, 5, and 10. For the order to divide 6, it must be 2.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 5 or 10: These do not divide 6, so we cannot choose them.\n    We only have **1 choice** for $\\chi_{11}$ (the one of order 2).\n\n*   **Conductor $q=13$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. There are $\\phi(13)-1=11$ primitive characters. Their orders are the divisors of 12 other than 1, which are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. For the order to divide 6, it must be 2, 3, or 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of valid components is $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$ choices for $\\chi_{13}$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results\n\nThe total number of primitive characters $\\chi$ of conductor $N$ whose order divides 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal choices = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal choices = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must ensure the order is exactly 6. The order of $\\chi$ is 6 if:\n1.  The order of each component $\\chi_q$ divides 6. (We have already ensured this by our selection process).\n2.  The lcm of the orders contains a factor of 2.\n3.  The lcm of the orders contains a factor of 3.\n\nLet's check these conditions for our 100 possible characters.\n- **Factor of 2**: For any choice, the component $\\chi_4$ has order 2. Therefore, the lcm will always be divisible by 2.\n- **Factor of 3**: For any choice, the component $\\chi_9$ has order 3 or 6. In either case, its order is divisible by 3. Therefore, the lcm will always be divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm of the orders is always divisible by 2 and 3, it must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3) = 6$.\nCombined with the fact that the order of every component divides 6 (so the lcm must also divide 6), we can conclude that the order of every single one of the 100 characters we've constructed is exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is 100."
