    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Identify the Key Principles**\n\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$, where:\n    *   $\\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in the electron's momentum.\n    *   $p$ is the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (n=1).\n*   **Key Principles:**\n    1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position ($\\Delta x$) to the uncertainty in its momentum ($\\Delta p$). The relationship is given by:\n        $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n        where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar = h/2\\pi$). To find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\n        $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n    2.  **Bohr's Model of the Atom:** Bohr's second postulate states that the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in a stable orbit is an integer multiple of $\\hbar$.\n        $L = n\\hbar$\n        For a circular orbit, angular momentum is $L = mvr = pr$, where $p$ is the linear momentum. Thus:\n        $pr = n\\hbar$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$)**\n\n*   We are given the uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n*   **Careful Point:** Convert the unit to SI units (meters).\n    $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n    We don't need to calculate the numerical value of $\\Delta p$ yet, as it might simplify later.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Momentum of the Electron in the First Bohr Orbit ($p$)**\n\n*   We use Bohr's quantization condition for angular momentum: $pr_n = n\\hbar$.\n*   For the first Bohr orbit, we have $n=1$. The radius of the first Bohr orbit ($r_1$) is known as the Bohr radius, denoted by $a_0$.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must use the values for the first orbit ($n=1$).\n    $p \\cdot r_1 = 1 \\cdot \\hbar \\implies p \\cdot a_0 = \\hbar$\n*   Therefore, the momentum is:\n    $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}$\n*   The value of the Bohr radius is a well-known constant:\n    $a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$**\n\n*   Now, we form the ratio using the expressions from Step 2 and Step 3.\n    Ratio = $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0} \\right)}$\n*   **Careful Point:** We can simplify this expression before plugging in numbers. The reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$, cancels out.\n    Ratio = $\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\times \\frac{a_0}{\\hbar} = \\frac{a_0}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   This simplified formula makes the calculation very straightforward.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the Values and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   We have the values:\n    *   $a_0 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n    *   $\\Delta x = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n*   Substitute these into the ratio formula:\n    Ratio = $\\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n*   The $10^{-11}$ and the units (m) cancel out.\n    Ratio = $\\frac{5.29}{2}$\n    Ratio = $2.645$\n\nThe ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is derived from the calculation $\\frac{a_0}{2 \\Delta x} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11}}{2 \\times 10 \\times 10^{-12}} = 2.645$.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
