    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ is a non-singular polynomial matrix.\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. Two polynomial matrices are left coprime if they do not have any non-unimodular common left divisors. A unimodular matrix is a square polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant.\n\nThe condition of being left coprime is equivalent to the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ having full row rank for all complex values of $s$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Transfer Function Poles**\n\nFirst, let's write out the transfer function matrix and determine its pole structure.\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe poles of the individual elements are at $s=1$ and $s=-1$. The system poles are the roots of the characteristic polynomial, which is the determinant of $D(s)$ (up to a constant factor) in a coprime factorization. The degree of this determinant is the McMillan degree of the system.\n\nLet's calculate the McMillan degree by summing the orders of the system poles.\n-   **Pole at s = -1:** The terms are $\\frac{s-1}{s+1}$ (pole of order 1) and $\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$ (pole of order 1). The determinant of $H(s)$ is $\\det(H(s)) = -\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$, which has a pole of order 1 at $s=-1$. This indicates the pole order of the system at $s=-1$ is 1.\n-   **Pole at s = 1:** The term $\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$ has a pole of order 1. The determinant of $H(s)$ also has a pole of order 1 at $s=1$. This indicates the pole order of the system at $s=1$ is 1.\n\nThe total McMillan degree is the sum of the orders of the system poles: $1 + 1 = 2$.\nTherefore, for our coprime factorization $H = D^{-1}N$, we require $\\deg(\\det(D(s))) = 2$. The roots of $\\det(D(s))$ must be the system poles, so $\\det(D(s))$ must be of the form $k(s-1)(s+1) = k(s^2-1)$ for some non-zero constant $k$.\n\n**3. Constructing the Factorization**\n\nWe are looking for $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ such that $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$, where $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are polynomial matrices.\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. Then $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ gives:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, its entries must be polynomials.\n-   From the second column, $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials.\n-   For the entries in the first column to be polynomials, the denominators must cancel out.\n    -   $d_{i1}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{i2}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{d_{i1}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{i2}(s)}{s^2-1}$ for $i=1, 2$.\n    -   This requires that the numerator $d_{i1}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{i2}(s)$ is divisible by $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$.\n    -   Testing at $s=1$: $d_{i1}(1)(0)^2 + 2d_{i2}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{i2}(1)=0$. So $d_{12}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n    -   Testing at $s=-1$: $d_{i1}(-1)(-2)^2 + 2d_{i2}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{i1}(-1)+2d_{i2}(-1)=0 \\implies 2d_{i1}(-1)+d_{i2}(-1)=0$.\n\nWe need to find the simplest possible polynomials for $D(s)$ that satisfy these conditions and the determinant condition $\\det(D(s)) = k(s^2-1)$.\n\nLet's construct $D(s)$ row by row, aiming for an upper triangular form ($d_{21}=0$).\n-   **Second Row ($i=2$):** We have $d_{21}(s) = 0$. The conditions are:\n    1.  $d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(s)$ has a factor $(s-1)$.\n    2.  $2d_{21}(-1)+d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2(0)+d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(-1)=0$. So $d_{22}(s)$ has a factor $(s+1)$.\n    The simplest non-trivial choice is $d_{22}(s) = (s-1)(s+1) = s^2-1$. Let's use this. So the second row of $D(s)$ is $[0 \\quad s^2-1]$.\n\n-   **First Row ($i=1$):** We need to choose $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{12}(s)$.\n    1.  $d_{12}(1)=0 \\implies d_{12}(s)$ has a factor $(s-1)$.\n    2.  $2d_{11}(-1)+d_{12}(-1)=0$.\n    Now consider the determinant: $\\det(D(s)) = d_{11}(s)d_{22}(s) - d_{12}(s)d_{21}(s) = d_{11}(s)(s^2-1)$. Since we require $\\deg(\\det(D(s)))=2$, $d_{11}(s)$ must be a constant. Let $d_{11}(s)=c$.\n    The second condition becomes $2c + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n    The first condition implies $d_{12}(s) = p(s)(s-1)$ for some polynomial $p(s)$. The simplest choice is to let $p(s)$ be a constant, $p(s)=k$.\n    So $d_{12}(s) = k(s-1)$.\n    Substituting into the second condition: $2c + k(-1-1) = 0 \\implies 2c - 2k = 0 \\implies c=k$.\n    The simplest non-trivial choice is $c=k=1$. This gives $d_{11}(s)=1$ and $d_{12}(s)=s-1$.\n\nSo, our candidate matrix is:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nIts determinant is $\\det(D(s)) = s^2-1$, which has the correct degree and roots.\n\n**4. Calculate N(s)**\nNow we find the corresponding numerator matrix $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{11} = (1) \\left(\\frac{s-1}{s+1}\\right) + (s-1) \\left(\\frac{2}{s^2-1}\\right) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} = \\frac{s+1}{s+1} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{12} = (1)(1) + (s-1)(0) = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{21} = (0)\\left(\\frac{s-1}{s+1}\\right) + (s^2-1)\\left(\\frac{2}{s^2-1}\\right) = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{22} = (0)(1) + (s^2-1)(0) = 0\n\\]\nSo the numerator matrix is:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis is a polynomial matrix, so the factorization is valid.\n\n**5. Verify Coprimeness**\n\nTo verify that $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime, we check that the rank of the compound matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 for all complex $s$.\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rank of a matrix can only drop if all of its $2 \\times 2$ minors are zero. Let's compute a minor. For example, the minor formed by the 1st and 3rd columns is:\n\\[\n\\det \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} = (1)(2) - (1)(0) = 2\n\\]\nSince this minor is a non-zero constant, it is never zero for any value of $s$. Therefore, the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is always 2. This confirms that $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\n**Final Answer**\nA left coprime factorization of $H(s)$ is given by $H(s)=D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ with:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}, N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
