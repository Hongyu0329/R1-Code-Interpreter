    "This is a question that requires careful textual analysis of Shakespeare's entire canon and a clear understanding of the terms involved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"First book in the Bible\"**: This refers to the book with the earliest position in the accepted sequence.\n    *   **\"In canonical order\"**: This specifies the standard ordering of the books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, etc.). For Shakespeare's context, this would be the order familiar from the Bishops' Bible or the Geneva Bible, which is essentially the same as the modern Protestant canon for the Old Testament.\n    *   **\"To be mentioned by name\"**: This is the most crucial part. The analysis must look for the actual title of a biblical book (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Psalms,\" \"Book of Job\") in the dialogue or stage directions, not merely an allusion to a character or story from that book (e.g., mentioning \"Adam and Eve\" is an allusion to Genesis, but not a mention of the book itself).\n    *   **\"Which Shakespeare play\"**: The specific play containing the reference must be identified.\n\n2.  **Systematic Search through the Biblical Canon:**\n    We must proceed book by book through the Old Testament and check for a mention of its name in Shakespeare's plays.\n\n    *   **Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus:** There are countless allusions to stories and characters from these books (Cain, Abel, Noah's Ark, Pharaoh), but the words \"Genesis,\" \"Exodus,\" or \"Leviticus\" do not appear as book titles.\n    *   **Numbers:** The phrase \"The Book of Numbers\" appears in *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act I, Scene 1). However, the context makes it clear that this is a trick question. Slender is looking for his \"Book of Riddles\" and his servant Simple tells him he has \"The Book of Numbers,\" which is then clarified to be a book of arithmetic, not the biblical text. This is a false positive.\n    *   **Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles:** These names or words appear, but not as titles of the biblical books. \"Judges\" refers to legal figures, \"Kings\" to monarchs, and \"chronicles\" to historical records in a general sense.\n    *   **Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther:** These names are not mentioned as book titles.\n    *   **Job:** The character of Job is mentioned as a symbol of poverty and suffering in both *The Merry Wives of Windsor* and *2 Henry IV* (\"as poor as Job\"), but the phrase \"Book of Job\" is never used.\n    *   **Psalms:** This provides our first positive identification. In *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act II, Scene 1), Mistress Page is comparing two identical love letters sent to her and Mistress Ford. She remarks: \"I would have sworn... upon **the book of Psalms** that they had been writ on purpose\". This is a clear, unambiguous reference to the biblical book by its title.\n\n3.  **Conclusion of the Search:**\n    Since we have worked through the books of the Old Testament in canonical order and the first book to be unambiguously mentioned by its title is the Book of Psalms, we have found our answer. All preceding books are either not mentioned by name or are referenced in a way that does not refer to the biblical text (e.g., the arithmetic \"Book of Numbers\"). Any books mentioned from later in the canon (such as the Gospels or Epistles) are irrelevant because Psalms comes before them.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Allusion vs. Mention:** The most common trap is confusing an allusion with a direct mention. Shakespeare's works are saturated with biblical allusions, but direct mentions of book titles are rare.\n*   **Context is Key:** Words that are also book titles (like Kings, Judges, Numbers) must be checked in context to ensure the reference is to the biblical book and not the common meaning of the word. The reference to the \"Book of Numbers\" is the prime example of why context is essential.\n*   **Canonical Order:** The order matters. Even if the book of Revelation were mentioned, Psalms would still be the answer because it appears much earlier in the biblical canon.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe systematic check confirms that no book before Psalms in the canonical order is mentioned by name in any Shakespeare play. Therefore, the first one is Psalms. The play in which this definitive mention occurs is *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Book of Psalms is the first book, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name, and it is mentioned in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.>>>"
