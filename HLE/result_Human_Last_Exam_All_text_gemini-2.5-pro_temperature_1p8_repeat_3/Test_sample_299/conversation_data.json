    "Answering this question involves analyzing the properties of any function that satisfies the given conditions. Let $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We want to find the cardinality of this set, $|S|$.\n\n**Step 1: Deduce the fundamental properties of $f$.**\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. By the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective (one-to-one), we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A well-known theorem in real analysis states that a continuous function defined on an interval (in this case, $\\mathbb{R}$) is injective if and only if it is strictly monotone. Thus, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the two cases for monotonicity.**\n\n**Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing.**\n\n*   If a continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is strictly decreasing, it must have a unique fixed point. That is, there exists a unique real number $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    *(To see this, consider the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$. As $f$ is decreasing and $-x$ is decreasing, $h(x)$ is strictly decreasing. Furthermore, as a continuous decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = L \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{+\\infty\\}$ and $\\lim_{x\\to+\\infty} f(x) = M \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{-\\infty\\}$ with $L>M$. This implies $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} h(x) = +\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to+\\infty} h(x) = -\\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a unique $x_0$ where $h(x_0)=0$, i.e., $f(x_0)=x_0$.)*\n*   If such a fixed point $x_0$ exists, we can apply $f$ to the equation $f(x_0) = x_0$:\n    $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0)$.\n*   Using the given functional equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ and the fixed point property $f(x_0)=x_0$, we get:\n    $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$.\n*   However, the equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions. This can be seen by observing that the graph of $y=e^x$ always lies above the graph of $y=x$ (the minimum value of $e^x - x$ is 1 at $x=0$).\n*   This is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions that satisfy the given equation.\n\n**Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing.**\n\n*   If $f$ is strictly increasing, what can we say about the relation between $f(x)$ and $x$? Let's consider the possibility of a fixed point. A fixed point $x_0$ would lead to $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$, which we've shown is impossible. Thus, $f$ has no fixed points.\n*   Since $f$ is continuous and has no fixed points, we must have either $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n*   If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then applying the increasing function $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining these inequalities, we get $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would imply $\\exp(x) < x$, which is false for all real $x$.\n*   Therefore, any strictly increasing solution must satisfy $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This is consistent with $\\exp(x) = f(f(x)) > f(x) > x$, as $e^x > x$ is true for all $x$.\n*   Such a function $f$ is a \"functional square root\" of the exponential function, often denoted as $\\exp^{1/2}$. The existence and construction of such functions are studied in the theory of functional equations.\n*   A key property is that $f$ must commute with $\\exp(x)$:\n    $f(\\exp(x)) = f(f(f(x))) = (f \\circ f)(f(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$.\n*   Solutions can be constructed using Abel's functional equation. We seek a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\alpha: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies $\\alpha(\\exp(x)) = \\alpha(x) + 1$.\n*   Once such an $\\alpha$ is found, a solution $f$ is given by $f(x) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x) + 1/2)$.\n    Let's verify this:\n    $f(f(x)) = f(\\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x) + 1/2)) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(\\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x) + 1/2)) + 1/2) = \\alpha^{-1}((\\alpha(x)+1/2)+1/2) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x)+1)$.\n    From the Abel equation $\\alpha(\\exp(x))=\\alpha(x)+1$, we have $\\exp(x) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x)+1)$. Thus, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n*   So the problem reduces to finding the number of continuous, strictly increasing solutions $\\alpha$ to the Abel equation. A solution $\\alpha$ is determined by its behavior on a fundamental domain. We can specify $\\alpha$ as an arbitrary continuous strictly increasing function $\\psi$ on an interval $[c, e^c]$ provided the boundary condition $\\psi(e^c) = \\psi(c) + 1$ is met.\n*   For example, let's define $\\alpha$ on the interval $[1, e]$. We must choose a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\psi: [1, e] \\to [A, A+1]$ for any constant $A \\in \\mathbb{R}$. One such function is $\\psi(x) = A + \\ln x$. However, we can add a \"wobble\" to it. Let $\\delta(x)$ be any continuous function on $[1,e]$ with $\\delta(1) = \\delta(e) = 0$. For a sufficiently small real number $t$, the function $\\psi_t(x) = A + \\ln x + t\\delta(x)$ will be strictly increasing and map $[1,e]$ to $[A, A+1]$.\n*   The set of such \"wobble\" functions $\\delta(x)$ has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = |\\mathbb{R}|$. Each distinct choice of $\\psi$ (which can be parametrized by a real parameter $t$ over an interval for a given $\\delta$) yields a distinct function $\\alpha$, which in turn gives a distinct solution $f$.\n*   This construction shows that there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions.\n*   The total number of continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is the cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}^\\mathbb{Q}$, which is $\\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   Since there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions and at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions, the cardinality of the set of increasing solutions must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion.**\n\nThe set $S$ contains no decreasing functions. The set of increasing functions in $S$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the total cardinality of $S$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$. This is the cardinality of the set of real numbers."
