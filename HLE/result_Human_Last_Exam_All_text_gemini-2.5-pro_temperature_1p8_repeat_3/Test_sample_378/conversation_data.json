    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the subject of the question.**\nThe question is about Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, who served as the President of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the core claim in the question.**\nThe question asks for the year when Goodluck Ebele Jonathan \"publicly identified himself as Azikiwe.\" This implies that he either adopted \"Azikiwe\" as part of his name or made a public declaration to that effect.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the full name of Goodluck Jonathan.**\nA review of all credible biographical, official, and historical sources confirms that his full name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his legal or commonly used name.\n\n**Step 4: Investigate the potential source of confusion.**\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with **Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria. It is possible there is a confusion between these two prominent Nigerian leaders, or that a user has mistakenly combined their names.\n\n**Step 5: Search for any event where Jonathan identified as \"Azikiwe\".**\nA thorough search of news archives, official records, public speeches, and historical documents from his time in office and beyond reveals no instance of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as \"Azikiwe.\" He has often paid tribute to past leaders, including Nnamdi Azikiwe, in speeches, but this is fundamentally different from adopting the name or identifying himself as such.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion.**\nThe premise of the question is based on incorrect information. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe.\" Therefore, there is no year in which this event occurred.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. The premise of the question is incorrect."
