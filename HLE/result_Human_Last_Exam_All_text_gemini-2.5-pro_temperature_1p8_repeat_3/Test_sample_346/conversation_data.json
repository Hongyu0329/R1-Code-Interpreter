    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n**1. Understand the Building Blocks: SKI Combinators and Church Numerals**\n\n*   **SKI Combinator Rules:**\n    *   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n    *   `K x y = x`\n    *   `I x = x`\n\n*   **Church Numerals:** A way to represent natural numbers using functions. A Church numeral `n`, denoted as `c_n`, is a function that takes another function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times.\n    *   `c_n f x = f(f(...f(x)...))` (n applications of `f`)\n    *   `c_0 = \\f.\\x.x = K I`\n    *   `c_1 = \\f.\\x.f x = I`\n    *   `c_2 = \\f.\\x.f(f x)`\n\n*   **Arithmetic with Church Numerals:**\n    *   **Successor (`succ`):** `succ(c_n) = c_{n+1}`. The combinator is `succ = S(S(K S)K)`.\n    *   **Addition (`add`):** `add c_n c_m = c_{n+m}`. This can be expressed as `\\n.\\m.\\f.\\x. n f (m f x)`.\n    *   **Exponentiation (`pow`):** `pow(c_m, c_n) = c_{m^n}`. This is represented by function application: `c_n c_m`. Applying numeral `c_n` to `c_m` as its function argument results in a new numeral representing `m` to the power of `n`.\n\n**2. Deconstruct the Expression**\n\nThe given expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`.\n\nLet's break it down into manageable parts.\nLet `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`.\nLet `X = S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))`.\nLet `Y = S(A)(S(I)(I))`.\n\nThe main expression `E` has the form `S(I)(X)(Y)`.\nUsing the `S` rule: `S(I)(X)(Y)` reduces to `I Y (X Y)`.\nUsing the `I` rule: `I Y (X Y)` reduces to `Y (X Y)`.\n\nThis means `E` is the result of applying the function represented by `Y` to the argument represented by `(X Y)`.\n\n**3. Evaluate Part A**\n\n`A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n*   The combinator `S(K(S))(K)` is equivalent to `S(K S)K`, which is the composition combinator `B` (`B f g x = f(g x)`).\n*   The expression `S(B)` is the standard successor combinator `succ`. `succ c_n f x = f (c_n f x) = c_{n+1} f x`.\n*   So, `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the `succ` combinator.\n*   The combinator `I` represents the Church numeral `1`.\n*   Therefore, `A = succ(I) = succ(c_1) = c_2`. The expression `A` represents the number **2**.\n\n**4. Evaluate Part Y**\n\n`Y = S(A)(S(I)(I))`\n*   Substitute `A=2`: `Y = S(2)(S I I)`.\n*   Let's analyze the behavior of `Y` when applied to `f` and `x`.\n    `Y f x = (S 2 (S I I)) f x = 2 f ((S I I) f x)`\n*   Now evaluate the sub-part `(S I I) f x`:\n    `(S I I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`. This is the definition of `c_2 f x`.\n*   So, `Y f x = 2 f (2 f x)`. This is the definition of Church addition for `c_2 + c_2`.\n*   `2 f (2 f x) = c_2 f (c_2 f x) = c_{2+2} f x = c_4 f x`.\n*   Therefore, `Y` represents the number **4**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Argument (X Y)**\n\nFirst, let's find the value of `(X Y)`, which is `(X 4)` since `Y=4`.\n*   `X = S(I)(S(I)(K(A))) = S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))`.\n*   `X 4 = (S I (S I (K 2))) 4`.\n*   Let `u=I`, `v=(S I (K 2))`, `w=4`. Applying the `S` rule: `u w (v w)` gives `I 4 ((S I (K 2)) 4)`.\n*   This reduces to `4 ((S I (K 2)) 4)`.\n*   This is an application of the Church numeral `4` to the result of `(S I (K 2)) 4`. In Church arithmetic, this is exponentiation. Let `Z = (S I (K 2)) 4`. Then `X 4` is `c_Z^4`.\n*   Let's evaluate `Z`:\n    `Z = S I (K 2) 4 = I 4 ((K 2) 4) = 4 (K 2 4)`.\n    `K 2 4` reduces to `2`.\n    So `Z = 4(2)`.\n*   `4(2)` is the application of Church numeral `4` to `2`. This is exponentiation: `c_2^4`.\n*   The value of `Z` is `2^4 = 16`.\n*   Now we can evaluate `X 4 = 4(Z) = 4(16)`.\n*   This is exponentiation again: `c_{16}^4`.\n*   The value represented by `(X Y)` is `16^4`.\n\n**6. Evaluate the Final Expression E**\n\nThe whole expression is `E = Y (X Y) = 4 (X 4)`.\n*   We found that `Y=4` and `X 4` represents the number `16^4`.\n*   So, `E` is the application of Church numeral `4` to the Church numeral for `16^4`.\n*   This is another exponentiation: `c_{(16^4)}^4`.\n*   The final integer `n` is `(16^4)^4`.\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Value**\n\n*   `n = (16^4)^4 = 16^{(4 \\times 4)} = 16^{16}`\n*   To simplify, express 16 as a power of 2: `16 = 2^4`.\n*   `n = (2^4)^{16} = 2^{(4 \\times 16)} = 2^{64}`.\n\nThe Church integer `n` is `2^64`.\n\n**8. Answer the Question**\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^{64}) = 64`.\n\n<<<64>>>"
