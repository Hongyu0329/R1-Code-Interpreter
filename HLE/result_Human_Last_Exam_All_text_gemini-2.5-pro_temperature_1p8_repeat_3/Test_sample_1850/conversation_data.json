    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** John Milton's epic poem, *Paradise Lost*.\n    *   **Object of Inquiry:** \"Historical saints\".\n    *   **Constraint:** They must be \"mentioned by name\".\n\n2.  **Define \"Historical Saint\":** This is the most crucial point.\n    *   A \"saint\" is a person recognized for exceptional holiness. In the context of Christianity, this often refers to figures canonized by the Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox churches.\n    *   \"Historical\" implies a figure who lived in recorded history *after* the foundational biblical period. This is to distinguish them from key biblical figures like Abraham, Moses, David, or the original Apostles (Peter, Paul, etc.). While these biblical figures are considered saints in a broader sense, the term \"historical saint\" typically refers to later individuals like Saint Augustine, Saint Francis of Assisi, Saint George, etc.\n    *   Therefore, the question is asking for post-biblical, Christian saints who are named in the text.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure and Content of *Paradise Lost*:**\n    *   The poem's main narrative is set at the very beginning of time: the War in Heaven, the creation of the world, and the fall of Adam and Eve.\n    *   There are two main places where later historical figures could be mentioned:\n        1.  **Authorial Asides/Similes:** Milton, as the narrator, occasionally uses comparisons to things from his own time or from history (e.g., Galileo).\n        2.  **Prophetic Visions:** In Books XI and XII, the Archangel Michael shows Adam a vision of future human history, from his expulsion to the Second Coming.\n\n4.  **Examine the Prophetic Visions (Books XI and XII):**\n    *   Michael's vision is a summary of the Old and New Testaments. He mentions numerous *biblical* figures by name: Cain, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, David, and Solomon.\n    *   When he reaches the New Testament era, he describes the life, death, and resurrection of Christ (the \"Saviour\"). He mentions John the Baptist (\"the great Proclaimer\").\n    *   He speaks of the Apostles in general terms (\"the twelve,\" \"his Apostles\") but does *not* mention them individually by name (e.g., Peter, Paul, John).\n    *   Crucially, after describing the establishment of the early Church, Michael's prophecy focuses on its *corruption*. He speaks of \"grievous wolves\" who will pervert the truth for power and wealth. He does not name any of the Church Fathers or later saints who are credited with upholding the faith. The vision ends with the promise of the Second Coming.\n\n5.  **Examine Authorial Asides and Milton's Theology:**\n    *   This is the definitive point. Milton was a radical Protestant who was vehemently opposed to the practices and hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church. He viewed the veneration of saints as a form of idolatry and a corruption of pure, scripture-based faith.\n    *   He makes his position explicit in the invocation at the beginning of Book III. When asking his muse to guide him, he contrasts his divine theme with other types of epic subjects, including the legends of saints. He states he will not write of:\n        > \"...things silent held in Israel's shrines,\n        > In heathen Fable, or of Knightly Gests,\n        > Or tedious Legends, fraught with empty dreams,\n        > Brought from the Cells of our Canoniz'd Saints.\" (Book III, lines 30-33, spelling modernized).\n    *   Here, Milton explicitly states his authorial intent to *avoid* including stories or names of \"Canoniz'd Saints,\" which he dismisses as \"tedious Legends.\"\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\n*   The figures named in *Paradise Lost* are overwhelmingly biblical (Adam, Eve, Moses), angelic (Michael, Raphael), demonic (Satan, Beelzebub), or classical/pagan (used as demon names or in similes).\n*   The parts of the poem that deal with future history (Books XI-XII) only name figures from the Bible.\n*   Milton's own Protestant theology and his explicit statement in Book III show a deliberate intention to exclude the naming of post-biblical, canonized saints from his epic.\n*   A thorough search of the poem's text confirms that no figure fitting the definition of a \"historical saint\" (like Augustine, Aquinas, Francis, George, etc.) is mentioned by name.\n\nTherefore, the number of historical saints mentioned by name is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
