    "This question asks us to trace a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verbal root through its descendants in several ancient Germanic languages. This process involves applying a series of regular, historical sound changes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** The question gives us the root `*seh₂g-` in a present tense formation `*seh₂g-ie/ti`, meaning \"he is giving a sign\" or \"he tracks/perceives\".\n*   **Root:** The core element is `*seh₂g-`.\n*   **Phonology:**\n    *   `s`: Voiceless alveolar sibilant.\n    *   `e`: A mid-front vowel.\n    *   `h₂`: The \"a-coloring\" laryngeal consonant. This consonant colors an adjacent `*e` vowel to `*a`. When it is lost, it can lengthen the preceding vowel. The sequence `*eh₂` before a consonant typically becomes long `*ā`.\n    *   `g`: Voiced velar stop.\n*   **Cognates:** The given cognates, Hittite `sākizzi` and Latin `sāgīre`, confirm a root structure with `*s-`, an `*a` quality vowel, and a `*g`. The long vowel in Latin `sāgīre` confirms the PIE reconstruction `*seh₂g-` yielding Pre-Italic `*sāg-`.\n\n**2. Derivation into Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\nWe must apply the sound laws that mark the transition from PIE to Proto-Germanic.\n\n*   **Vowel Change:** The PIE sequence `*eh₂` became long `*ā`. In Proto-Germanic, PIE `*ā` regularly becomes long `*ō`.\n    *   `PIE *seh₂g- → Pre-Germanic *sāg- → PGmc *sōk-`\n*   **Grimm's Law:** This law affects all PIE stop consonants. For our root, we look at the voiced stop `*g`.\n    *   `PIE *g → PGmc *k` (voiceless velar stop).\n*   **Verb Formation:** The PIE present suffix `*-ie/o` is the source of the Germanic Class 1 weak verbs, which have the infinitive suffix `*-janą`. This suffix is added to the o-grade root. Here, the verb is formed from the root `*sōk-`.\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** Combining these changes, the root `*sōk-` plus the suffix `*-janą` gives the Proto-Germanic verb `*sōkijaną` ('to seek, to look for').\n\n**3. Derivation into Old Norse (ON)**\n\nWe trace the changes from PGmc `*sōkijaną` to Old Norse.\n\n*   **i-Umlaut (i-Mutation):** The `j` in the suffix `*-janą` is a high front vowel/semivowel. It causes the preceding back vowel (`*ō` in this case) to become a front vowel.\n    *   `PGmc *ō → ON œ` (written `æ` in normalized orthography).\n*   **Syncope:** The `*-ij-` sound that caused the umlaut was subsequently lost in Old Norse before the final vowel.\n*   **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` reduces to `-a` in Old Norse.\n*   **Old Norse Result:** `*sōkijaną → *sœkja → sœkja`.\n\n**4. Derivation into Old English (OE)**\n\nWe trace the changes from PGmc `*sōkijaną` to Old English.\n\n*   **i-Umlaut:** As in Old Norse, the `j` in `*-janą` causes the umlaut of the root vowel `*ō`.\n    *   `PGmc *ō → OE ē` (pronounced as a long front vowel /eː/, often written `é` or `e`).\n*   **Palatalization:** In Old English, the velar stop `*k` was palatalized to the affricate /tʃ/ when it came before a front vowel or the semivowel `j`. The spelling for this sound is `c` (or `ċ`).\n*   **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an` in Old English.\n*   **Old English Result:** `*sōkijaną → *sēkjan → sēcan` (pronounced /ˈseːt͡ʃɑn/).\n\n**5. Derivation into Old High German (OHG)**\n\nWe trace the changes from PGmc `*sōkijaną` to Old High German. This involves a different set of changes, most notably the High German Consonant Shift.\n\n*   **Vowel Change:** PGmc `*ō` regularly becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German.\n    *   `PGmc *ō → OHG uo`\n*   **High German Consonant Shift:** This shifts the articulation of stop consonants. PGmc `*k` after a vowel shifts to a voiceless velar fricative /x/, written `hh` or `ch`.\n    *   `PGmc *k → OHG hh`\n*   **i-Umlaut:** Unlike in Old Norse and Old English, the `j` in the suffix was lost very early in Old High German after heavy syllables (like `*suoh-`) before it could cause umlaut of the `uo` diphthong in the infinitive form. Therefore, the infinitive does not show i-umlaut.\n*   **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an` or `-en` in Old High German.\n*   **Old High German Result:** `*sōkijaną → *suohjan → suohhen`.\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sœkja; Old English: sēcan; Old High German: suohhen.>>>"
