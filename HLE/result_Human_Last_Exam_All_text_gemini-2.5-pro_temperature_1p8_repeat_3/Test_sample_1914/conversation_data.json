    "Answering this question requires us to find the number of non-isomorphic categories that have exactly 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the definition of a category\nA category consists of objects, morphisms, identity morphisms for each object, and an associative composition rule.\n- We have 2 objects, let's call them A and B.\n- We have 4 morphisms in total.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the mandatory morphisms\nFor any category with 2 objects A and B, there must be two identity morphisms:\n1.  `id_A: A → A`\n2.  `id_B: B → B`\n\nThese two identity morphisms are required by the definition of a category. This accounts for 2 of the 4 total morphisms, leaving us with 2 \"non-identity\" morphisms to place. Let's call these non-identity morphisms `f` and `g`.\n\n### Step 3: Classifying categories by the distribution of non-identity morphisms\nThe two morphisms `f` and `g` can be distributed among the four possible Hom-sets: Hom(A, A), Hom(B, B), Hom(A, B), and Hom(B, A). We can classify the possible category structures by how these two morphisms are distributed. Let `n_XY = |Hom(X, Y)|`. We know `n_AA ≥ 1`, `n_BB ≥ 1`, and the sum `n_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB = 4`.\n\nWe enumerate the partitions of the two non-identity morphisms, grouping cases that are equivalent by swapping the labels of objects A and B.\n\n**Case 1: Both `f` and `g` are endomorphisms on the same object.**\n- `Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f, g}`, `Hom(B,B) = {id_B}`.\n- This means `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) = (3, 0, 0, 1)`. The case `(1, 0, 0, 3)` is isomorphic by swapping A and B.\n- The set `Hom(A,A)` must form a monoid of order 3 under composition. There are exactly 5 non-isomorphic monoids with a single identity of order 3. Each of these defines a distinct category structure.\n- **Result: 5 categories.**\n\n**Case 2: Both `f` and `g` are morphisms between A and B, in the same direction.**\n- `Hom(A,B) = {f, g}`, with `n_AA=1`, `n_BB=1`.\n- This means `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) = (1, 2, 0, 1)`.\n- No compositions (other than with identities) are possible. For example, `f o g` is not defined as the target of `g` (B) is not the source of `f` (A). The structure is thus uniquely determined by this distribution.\n- The dual case `(1, 0, 2, 1)` has `Hom(B,A) = {f', g'}`. A category from the first case is isomorphic to its dual (by a functor that swaps A and B). So, these two distributions lead to a single category type up to isomorphism.\n- **Result: 1 category.**\n\n**Case 3: `f` is an endomorphism on A, and `g` is an endomorphism on B.**\n- `Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f}`, `Hom(B,B) = {id_B, g}`.\n- This means `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) = (2, 0, 0, 2)`.\n- This describes a category that is the coproduct (disjoint union) of two one-object categories. A one-object category is simply a monoid.\n- `Hom(A,A)` is a monoid of order 2, as is `Hom(B,B)`. There are two non-isomorphic monoids of order 2:\n    1. The group Z₂ (where `f o f = id_A`).\n    2. The idempotent monoid I (where `f o f = f`).\n- We can form three non-isomorphic combinations: (Z₂, Z₂), (Z₂, I), and (I, I). The case (I, Z₂) is isomorphic to (Z₂, I) by swapping A and B.\n- **Result: 3 categories.**\n\n**Case 4: `f` goes from A to B, `g` goes from B to A.**\n- `Hom(A,B) = {f}`, `Hom(B,A) = {g}`.\n- This means `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) = (1, 1, 1, 1)`.\n- Composition laws must be defined for `g o f : A → A` and `f o g : B → B`.\n- Since `Hom(A,A) = {id_A}` and `Hom(B,B) = {id_B}`, the compositions are forced: `g o f = id_A` and `f o g = id_B`.\n- This defines the \"walking isomorphism\" category, where objects A and B are isomorphic. The structure is unique.\n- **Result: 1 category.**\n\n**Case 5: One endomorphism and one morphism between distinct objects.**\n- e.g., `f` in `Hom(A,A)` and `g` in `Hom(A,B)`.\n- This means `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) = (2, 1, 0, 1)`.\n- We need to define `f o f : A → A` and `g o f : A → B`.\n- `g o f` must be `g`, as it is the only morphism in `Hom(A,B)`.\n- `f o f` can be `id_A` (Z₂ case) or `f` (idempotent case). This gives 2 different category structures.\n- Now we consider the dual case, which corresponds to the partition `(1, 0, 1, 2)` after swapping A,B, or `(2, 0, 1, 1)` without swapping. Let's analyze `(2, 0, 1, 1)`: `Hom(A,A) = {id_A, h}` and `Hom(B,A) = {k}`. Here, `h o k` must be `k`, and `h o h` can be `id_A` or `h`. This gives another 2 category structures.\n- One can show that a category from the first set (`g o f = g`) is not isomorphic to a category from the second set (`h o k = k`), as they are duals but not self-dual. Therefore, we have 2 + 2 = 4 distinct categories.\n- **Result: 4 categories.**\n\n### Final Tally\nSumming up the number of categories from each distinct case:\n- Case 1: 5\n- Case 2: 1\n- Case 3: 3\n- Case 4: 1\n- Case 5: 4\n\nTotal = 5 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 14."
