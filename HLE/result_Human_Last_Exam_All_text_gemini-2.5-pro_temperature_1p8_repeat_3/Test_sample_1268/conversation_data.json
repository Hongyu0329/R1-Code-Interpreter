    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the upper bound.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Mathematical Context:**\n    *   **Squarefree natural numbers (N):** This indicates we are working with real quadratic number fields, denoted by $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$, where $N > 1$ is an integer not divisible by any perfect square.\n    *   **Lattice and Covolume (V):** We consider the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of the field $K$. Using the two real embeddings of $K$, $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$, we can embed $\\mathcal{O}_K$ into the real plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The mapping is $\\sigma: \\alpha \\mapsto (\\sigma_1(\\alpha), \\sigma_2(\\alpha))$. The image, $\\Lambda = \\sigma(\\mathcal{O}_K)$, forms a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The covolume $(V)$ of this lattice is the volume of its fundamental domain, given by the formula $V = \\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$, where $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the field $K$.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the \"Maximum Norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)\"**\n    *   The notation \"k_{k,\\infty}\" is non-standard but its context suggests it refers to a characteristic norm of the lattice vectors. The subscript $\\infty$ typically denotes the maximum norm (or infinity norm), defined for a vector $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ as $\\|(x,y)\\|_\\infty = \\max(|x|, |y|)$.\n    *   In the theory of lattices, we have the concept of **successive minima**. For a given norm, the first minimum, $\\lambda_1$, is the norm of the shortest non-zero lattice vector. The second minimum, $\\lambda_2$, is the norm of the shortest lattice vector that is linearly independent of the first one. Since $\\lambda_1 \\le \\lambda_2$, $\\lambda_2$ can be considered the \"maximum\" of these characteristic norms. Thus, we interpret $k_{k,\\infty}$ as $\\lambda_2(\\Lambda, \\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$.\n    *   Our goal is to find an upper bound for $\\lambda_2$ in terms of the covolume $V$.\n\n3.  **Applying Minkowski's Second Theorem on Successive Minima:**\n    *   This fundamental theorem in the geometry of numbers relates the successive minima of a lattice to its covolume. For a lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and a 0-symmetric convex body $C$, the theorem states:\n        $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\dots \\lambda_n \\cdot \\text{vol}(C) \\le 2^n \\cdot \\text{covol}(\\Lambda)$\n    *   In our case:\n        *   The dimension is $n=2$.\n        *   The lattice is $\\Lambda = \\sigma(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ with $\\text{covol}(\\Lambda) = V$.\n        *   The norm is the infinity norm, so the corresponding convex body (the unit ball) is the square $C = \\{(x,y) : |x|\\le 1, |y|\\le 1\\}$. The volume (area) of this square is $\\text{vol}(C) = 4$.\n    *   Substituting these into the theorem:\n        $\\lambda_1 \\cdot \\lambda_2 \\cdot 4 \\le 2^2 \\cdot V$\n    *   Simplifying the inequality gives us a relationship between the successive minima and the covolume:\n        $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\le V$\n\n4.  **Calculating the First Successive Minimum ($\\lambda_1$)**\n    *   To find an upper bound for $\\lambda_2$, we need to establish a lower bound for $\\lambda_1$. The first minimum $\\lambda_1$ is the smallest non-zero infinity norm among all lattice vectors.\n        $\\lambda_1 = \\inf\\{\\|\\sigma(\\alpha)\\|_\\infty : \\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K, \\alpha \\neq 0\\}$.\n    *   **Lower Bound for $\\lambda_1$**: Let's prove $\\lambda_1 \\ge 1$.\n        Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there is a non-zero algebraic integer $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $\\|\\sigma(\\alpha)\\|_\\infty < 1$. This implies that $|\\sigma_1(\\alpha)| < 1$ and $|\\sigma_2(\\alpha)| < 1$. The norm of this algebraic integer, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\sigma_1(\\alpha) \\cdot \\sigma_2(\\alpha)$, must be a non-zero integer (since $\\alpha \\ne 0$). However, our assumption leads to $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)| = |\\sigma_1(\\alpha)| \\cdot |\\sigma_2(\\alpha)| < 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. This is a contradiction, as a non-zero integer cannot have an absolute value less than 1. Therefore, our assumption must be false. Thus, for any non-zero $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, $\\|\\sigma(\\alpha)\\|_\\infty \\ge 1$. This shows $\\lambda_1 \\ge 1$.\n    *   **Upper Bound for $\\lambda_1$**: Let's prove $\\lambda_1 \\le 1$.\n        Consider the rational integer $1$, which is also an element of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The corresponding lattice vector is $\\sigma(1) = (1,1)$. Its infinity norm is $\\|\\sigma(1)\\|_\\infty = \\max(|1|, |1|) = 1$. Since $\\lambda_1$ is the minimum norm of any non-zero vector, it must be less than or equal to this value. So, $\\lambda_1 \\le 1$.\n    *   **Conclusion for $\\lambda_1$**: Combining both bounds, we find that the first successive minimum is exactly 1: $\\lambda_1 = 1$.\n\n5.  **Deriving the Final Upper Bound**\n    *   Now we substitute our calculated value $\\lambda_1=1$ back into the inequality derived from Minkowski's theorem ($\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\le V$).\n    *   $1 \\cdot \\lambda_2 \\le V$\n    *   This gives us the final upper bound for the second successive minimum (our \"maximum norm\"):\n        $\\lambda_2 \\le V$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis shows that the upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty}$, interpreted as the second successive minimum $\\lambda_2$) in relation to the covolume $(V)$ is $V$ itself.\n\n<<<V>>>"
