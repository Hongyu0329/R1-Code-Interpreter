    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nFind the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n**Step 1: Understand the GCRD and the method of calculation**\nA matrix G(s) is a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a common right divisor, and any other common right divisor of P1(s) and P2(s) is also a right divisor of G(s). The GCRD is not unique; if G(s) is a GCRD, then U(s)G(s) is also a GCRD for any unimodular matrix U(s).\n\nA standard method to find the GCRD is to use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This involves performing elementary polynomial row operations on the stacked matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] to reduce it to a row-echelon form. The resulting non-zero rows constitute a GCRD.\n\n**Step 2: Construct the stacked matrix M(s)**\nWe form a 4x2 matrix by stacking P1(s) on top of P2(s):\nM(s) =\n[[s^2 + s, -s],      (Row 1)\n [-s^2 - 1, s^2],     (Row 2)\n [s, 0],              (Row 3)\n [-s - 1, 1]]         (Row 4)\n\n**Step 3: Perform elementary row operations to simplify M(s)**\nOur goal is to use row operations (swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, or adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another) to reduce the matrix.\n\n1.  **Create a simpler row.** We can create a very simple row with constant entries by adding Row 3 to Row 4.\n    *   Operation: `Row 4 -> Row 4 + Row 3`\n    *   New Row 4: [-s - 1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [[s^2 + s, -s],\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n     [s, 0],\n     [-1, 1]]\n\n2.  **Use the simple row to create zeros.** Now, we use the new Row 4 ([-1, 1]) to eliminate the entries in the first column of the other rows.\n    *   Operation: `Row 1 -> Row 1 + (s^2 + s) * Row 4`\n        *   New Row 1: [(s^2 + s) + (s^2 + s)(-1), -s + (s^2 + s)(1)] = [0, s^2]\n    *   Operation: `Row 2 -> Row 2 - (s^2 + 1) * Row 4`\n        *   New Row 2: [(-s^2 - 1) - (s^2 + 1)(-1), s^2 - (s^2 + 1)(1)] = [0, -1]\n    *   Operation: `Row 3 -> Row 3 + s * Row 4`\n        *   New Row 3: [s + s(-1), 0 + s(1)] = [0, s]\n\n    The matrix is now:\n    [[0, s^2],\n     [0, -1],\n     [0, s],\n     [-1, 1]]\n\n3.  **Continue the reduction.** The first column is now simplified. We can use the new Row 2 ([0, -1]) to eliminate the second column entries in the other rows.\n    *   Operation: `Row 1 -> Row 1 + s^2 * Row 2`\n        *   New Row 1: [0, s^2 + s^2(-1)] = [0, 0]\n    *   Operation: `Row 3 -> Row 3 + s * Row 2`\n        *   New Row 3: [0, s + s(-1)] = [0, 0]\n    *   Operation: `Row 4 -> Row 4 + 1 * Row 2`\n        *   New Row 4: [-1, 1 + (-1)] = [-1, 0]\n\n    The matrix is now fully reduced to:\n    [[0, 0],\n     [0, -1],\n     [0, 0],\n     [-1, 0]]\n\n**Step 4: Identify the GCRD from the reduced matrix**\nThe non-zero rows in the final matrix form the GCRD. By reordering these rows, we get:\nG(s) = [[-1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\n**Step 5: Normalize the GCRD**\nThe GCRD we found is G(s) = -I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix. The determinant of G(s) is (-1)(-1) - 0 = 1, which is a non-zero constant. This means G(s) is a unimodular matrix.\n\nSince any unimodular multiple of a GCRD is also a GCRD, we can multiply G(s) by another unimodular matrix to get a more standard form. Multiplying by U(s) = -I (which is unimodular):\n(-I) * G(s) = (-I) * (-I) = I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\nThis means that P1(s) and P2(s) are **right coprime**, and their GCRD can be taken as the identity matrix.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   All row operations must use polynomial multipliers. All multipliers used (e.g., `1`, `s`, `s^2+s`, `s^2+1`) were polynomials.\n*   The final result is a basis for the row space of the original stacked matrix.\n*   The fact that the GCRD is a unimodular matrix (like I or -I) has a specific meaning in control theory: the system represented by the pair (P1, P2) is right coprime.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe greatest common right divisor of P1(s) and P2(s) is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
