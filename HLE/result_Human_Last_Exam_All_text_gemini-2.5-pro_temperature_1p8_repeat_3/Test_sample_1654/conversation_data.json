    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of times Chekhov described Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe coat is the central symbol of Otchumyelov's fluctuating authority and subservience. Chekhov uses the action of taking the coat off and putting it on to physically manifest these changes. To find the answer, we must trace each mention or action related to the coat throughout the short story.\n\n1.  **Initial Description:** At the very beginning of the story, as the Police Superintendent makes his appearance, Chekhov provides the first description.\n    *   **Instance 1:** Otchumyelov is introduced \"wearing a new greatcoat and carrying a parcel.\" This sets his initial official and imposing status.\n\n2.  **First Shift (Authority asserted):** When dealing with what he assumes is a simple case involving a stray dog and a commoner, Otchumyelov feels hot and powerful.\n    *   **Instance 2:** He says, \"It's frightfully hot! It looks like rain,\" and instructs the policeman, \"Take off my coat, Yeldyrin.\" He sheds his formal covering, feeling relaxed and in command.\n\n3.  **Second Shift (Fear and Subservience):** The moment someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to the important General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's mood changes dramatically.\n    *   **Instance 3:** He immediately feels a chill and says, \"Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad.... there's a wind getting up.... I'm shivering.\" The coat becomes a shield and a return to frightened formality.\n\n4.  **Third Shift (Authority returns):** The policeman, Yeldyrin, reasons that the dog is not the General's, as the General prefers setters. This relieves Otchumyelov.\n    *   **Instance 4:** He says, \"I know it, too.... It's baking hot,\" and again orders, \"Take my coat off...\" His feeling of power returns, and he discards the symbolic covering.\n\n5.  **Fourth Shift (Fear returns):** The policeman then speculates that he might have seen a similar dog at the General's place after all, plunging Otchumyelov back into uncertainty and fear.\n    *   **Instance 5:** Otchumyelov, \"shivering,\" immediately reverses his command: \"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... I feel a draught.\" He needs the protective shell of the coat once more.\n\n6.  **Final Action (Resolution):** The final revelation comes from the General's cook: the dog belongs to the General's brother. Otchumyelov's opinion makes its final, sycophantic turn. As he leaves, Chekhov gives one last description of an action with the coat.\n    *   **Instance 6:** After fawning over the puppy, \"Otchumyelov wraps himself in his greatcoat and walks away from the market-place.\" This final act shows him retreating back into his official persona, ending the public incident.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The question asks how many times the coat was \"described.\" In this context, describing the *actions* involving the coat (taking it off, putting it on, wrapping it) is as important as describing its appearance (\"new\"), because these actions symbolize the character's internal shifts.\n*   The analysis includes the initial establishing description and the final concluding action, as they bookend the central series of reversals.\n*   The count is based on distinct moments in the narrative where Chekhov explicitly draws the reader's attention to the coat's state or the character's interaction with it.\n*   There are four central actions of taking the coat off (twice) and putting it on (twice), which form the core of the \"chameleon\" symbolism. Adding the initial description and the final action gives the total count.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, Chekhov describes the coat or an action involving it a total of six times.\n\n<<<6>>>"
