    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Wallpaper Groups and Point Groups\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 possible two-dimensional plane symmetry groups. They classify all the ways a pattern can be repeated in a plane using translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections.\n*   **Point Group (Crystal Class):** For any wallpaper group, its associated point group consists of the rotational and reflectional symmetries of the pattern around a fixed point, ignoring the translational components. The point group describes the macroscopic symmetry of the pattern.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements (i.e., symmetry operations) it contains.\n\nThe question asks for the number of wallpaper groups whose corresponding point group has exactly two elements.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Point Groups of Order 2\n\nA group with two elements must consist of the identity element and one other element which is its own inverse. In the context of 2D crystallographic point groups, there are two such possibilities:\n1.  **Point Group C₂ (or '2'):** This group consists of the identity operation and a 180-degree rotation. Performing a 180-degree rotation twice results in a 360-degree rotation, which is equivalent to the identity.\n2.  **Point Group D₁ (or 'm'):** This group consists of the identity operation and a reflection across a single line (a mirror line). Performing a reflection twice returns the object to its original state, so it is also an operation of order 2.\n\nTherefore, we need to count the number of wallpaper groups whose point group is either C₂ or D₁.\n\n### Step 3: List the 17 Wallpaper Groups and Identify Their Point Groups\n\nWe will go through the standard classification of the 17 wallpaper groups and check the order of their point group.\n\n| IUC Notation | Point Group | Order of Point Group | Condition Met (Order = 2)? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| p1 | C₁ (1) | 1 | No |\n| **p2** | **C₂ (2)** | **2** | **Yes** |\n| **pm** | **D₁ (m)** | **2** | **Yes** |\n| **pg** | **D₁ (m)** | **2** | **Yes** |\n| **cm** | **D₁ (m)** | **2** | **Yes** |\n| pmm | D₂ (2mm) | 4 | No |\n| pmg | D₂ (2mm) | 4 | No |\n| pgg | D₂ (2mm) | 4 | No |\n| cmm | D₂ (2mm) | 4 | No |\n| p4 | C₄ (4) | 4 | No |\n| p4m | D₄ (4mm) | 8 | No |\n| p4g | D₄ (4mm) | 8 | No |\n| p3 | C₃ (3) | 3 | No |\n| p3m1 | D₃ (3m) | 6 | No |\n| p31m | D₃ (3m) | 6 | No |\n| p6 | C₆ (6) | 6 | No |\n| p6m | D₆ (6m) | 12 | No |\n\n### Step 4: Count the Qualifying Wallpaper Groups\n\nBased on the table in Step 3, we can identify all the wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n\n1.  **p2:** The point group is C₂ (2-fold rotation), which has order 2.\n2.  **pm:** The point group is D₁ (mirror reflection), which has order 2.\n3.  **pg:** The point group is D₁ (mirror reflection), which has order 2. Although this group's characteristic symmetry is a glide reflection, its associated point group (crystal class) is D₁.\n4.  **cm:** The point group is D₁ (mirror reflection), which has order 2.\n\nCounting these groups, we have a total of 4 wallpaper groups that satisfy the condition.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are 4 wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2: **p2, pm, pg, and cm**.\n\n<<<4>>>"
