    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem\n\nFirst, let's understand all the components of the question.\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. A unary predicate describes a property of a single element.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic.\n    *   It is built over the schema $S$. The atomic formulas are of the form $P_i(v)$, where $v$ is a variable.\n    *   It allows only existential quantifiers ($\\exists$).\n    *   It allows only conjunction ($\\land$) as a boolean connective.\n    *   It allows the logical constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n    *   Crucially, it does **not** include negation ($\\neg$), disjunction ($\\lor$), or universal quantifiers ($\\forall$). This means all formulas are *positive*.\n*   **VC Dimension**: The VC dimension is a measure of the complexity or expressive power of a set of classifiers (a concept class). We need to determine the VC dimension of the concept class defined by our logic fragment.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Concept Class\n\nIn the context of logic and learning theory, a logic defines a concept class. We need to be precise about what the \"points\" are and what the \"concepts\" are.\n\n*   **Points**: The points are individual elements from the domain (or universe) of a logical structure. Let's call the domain $U$.\n*   **Structure**: A structure $\\mathcal{M}$ for the schema $S$ consists of a domain $U$ and an interpretation for each predicate $P_i$. The interpretation of $P_i$ is simply the set of elements in $U$ for which $P_i$ is true. For any element $u \\in U$, its \"type\" is the binary vector $(P_1(u), P_2(u), P_3(u), P_4(u))$. There are $2^4 = 16$ possible types.\n*   **Concepts**: A concept is a subset of the domain $U$. A concept $C$ is definable in our logic if there is a formula $\\phi(y)$ with one free variable $y$ in the language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ such that $C = \\{u \\in U \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(u)\\}$.\n*   **Concept Class**: For a fixed structure $\\mathcal{M}$, the set of all definable concepts forms a concept class, let's call it $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n*   **VC Dimension of a Logic**: The VC dimension of a logic is the maximum possible VC dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}$, maximized over all possible structures $\\mathcal{M}$. That is, VCdim(Logic) = $\\sup_{\\mathcal{M}} \\text{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}})$.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize the Formulas and Definable Concepts\n\nLet's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(y)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. A general formula with one free variable $y$ can be written in prenex normal form as:\n$\\phi(y) = \\exists x_1 \\exists x_2 \\dots \\exists x_k \\psi(y, x_1, \\dots, x_k)$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula built using only $\\land$. So, $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since the predicates are unary, each atom involves only one variable. We can group the atoms by the variable they use:\n$\\psi = \\left(\\bigwedge_{j \\in J_0} P_j(y)\\right) \\land \\left(\\bigwedge_{j \\in J_1} P_j(x_1)\\right) \\land \\dots \\land \\left(\\bigwedge_{j \\in J_k} P_j(x_k)\\right)$\n\nFor an element $u \\in U$, the truth of $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(u)$ can be determined by substituting $u$ for $y$. The formula is equivalent to:\n$\\left(\\bigwedge_{j \\in J_0} P_j(y)\\right) \\land \\left(\\exists x_1 \\bigwedge_{j \\in J_1} P_j(x_1)\\right) \\land \\dots \\land \\left(\\exists x_k \\bigwedge_{j \\in J_k} P_j(x_k)\\right)$\n\nThis has the form $C(y) \\land S$, where:\n*   $C(y) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in J_0} P_j(y)$ is a conjunction of predicates on the free variable $y$.\n*   $S = \\left(\\exists x_1 \\dots\\right) \\land \\dots$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables).\n\nFor a fixed structure $\\mathcal{M}$, the sentence $S$ is either true or false for the entire structure.\n*   If $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models S$, then $\\phi(y)$ is false for all $y$, defining the empty set concept, $\\emptyset$.\n*   If $\\mathcal{M} \\models S$, then $\\phi(y)$ is true if and only if $C(y)$ is true. This defines the concept $\\{u \\in U \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\bigwedge_{j \\in J_0} P_j(u) \\}$.\n\nSo, for any structure $\\mathcal{M}$, any definable concept is either $\\emptyset$ or a set defined by a pure positive conjunction of the base predicates. Let $C_J = \\{u \\in U \\mid \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_j(u) \\text{ is true}\\}$ for $J \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The concept class $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}$ is always a subset of $\\mathcal{K} = \\{ C_J \\mid J \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$. Note that $C_{\\emptyset}$ (for an empty conjunction) is the entire domain $U$.\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the VC Dimension\n\nTo find the VC dimension of the logic, we must find a structure $\\mathcal{M}$ that makes the concept class $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}$ as rich as possible, and then compute its VC dimension. The richest possible class is $\\mathcal{K}$.\n\nCan we construct a structure $\\mathcal{M}$ where $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}} = \\mathcal{K}$?\nYes. Let's choose a structure $\\mathcal{M}$ whose domain contains elements for all $2^4 = 16$ possible predicate combinations (types).\n*   For any $J \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$, the concept $C_J$ is definable by the simple formula $\\phi(y) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_j(y)$. This formula has no existential quantifiers, so the \"sentence\" part is $\\top$, which is always true.\n*   The empty set $\\emptyset$ is definable by the formula $\\bot$.\nIn this structure, any positive existential sentence is also true (unless it is self-contradictory, which is not possible with positive predicates). So any formula $\\phi(y) = C_J(y) \\land S$ will define the concept $C_J$. Thus, the concept class $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}$ is exactly $\\{ C_J \\mid J \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\}$.\n\n### Step 5: Compute the VC Dimension of the Richest Concept Class\n\nWe need to compute the VC dimension of the class of monotone conjunctions on 4 boolean features. It is a known result that the VC dimension of monotone conjunctions on $k$ features is $k$. Here, $k=4$. Let's prove it.\n\n**Lower Bound (VCdim $\\ge 4$)**: We need to show that there exists a set of size 4 that can be shattered.\nLet's choose a set of 4 points $Y = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$. We define the interpretation of predicates $P_1, \\dots, P_4$ on these points as follows: $P_j(y_i)$ is true if and only if $i \\neq j$.\n\nThis gives the following predicate matrix:\n| | $P_1$ | $P_2$ | $P_3$ | $P_4$ |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|$y_1$| F | T | T | T |\n|$y_2$| T | F | T | T |\n|$y_3$| T | T | F | T |\n|$y_4$| T | T | T | F |\n\nTo shatter $Y$, for any subset $Y' \\subseteq Y$, we must find a concept $C_J$ such that $Y \\cap C_J = Y'$. Let's choose the formula/concept based on the elements *not* in $Y'$. Let $J = \\{j \\mid y_j \\notin Y'\\}$. The concept is $C_J(y) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_j(y)$.\nLet's check this:\n*   If $y_i \\in Y'$, then $i \\notin J$. For this $y_i$ to be included in the concept, we need $P_j(y_i)$ to be true for all $j \\in J$. By our construction, since $j \\neq i$ for all $j \\in J$, $P_j(y_i)$ is indeed true. So $y_i$ is included.\n*   If $y_i \\notin Y'$, then $i \\in J$. For this $y_i$ to be excluded, we need $P_j(y_i)$ to be false for at least one $j \\in J$. Since $i \\in J$, we check $P_i(y_i)$. By our construction, $P_i(y_i)$ is false. So $y_i$ is excluded.\nThis works for any $y_i$. Thus, this set of 4 points is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Upper Bound (VCdim $\\le 4$)**: We need to show that no set of size 5 can be shattered.\nThe number of distinct concepts available in our class is $| \\{ C_J \\mid J \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\}| = 2^4 = 16$.\nTo shatter a set of size $d$, we must be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets. For a set of size 5, we would need to generate $2^5=32$ distinct subsets.\nSince our concept class only contains 16 distinct concepts, we cannot generate 32 distinct subsets. Therefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered.\nThis result is formally known as a consequence of Sauer's Lemma: if a concept class $\\mathcal{H}$ shatters a set of size $d$, then $|\\mathcal{H}| \\ge 2^d$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that we can shatter a set of size 4 and that we cannot shatter any set of size 5. Therefore, the maximum size of a shatterable set is 4.\n\nThe VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is 4."
