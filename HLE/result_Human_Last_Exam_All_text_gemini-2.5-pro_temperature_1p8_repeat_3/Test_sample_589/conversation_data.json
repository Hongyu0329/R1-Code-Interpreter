    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the query into key elements.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific Hollywood film based on four distinct criteria:\n1.  **Type of production:** A Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio.\n2.  **Character:** A teenager.\n3.  **Object:** A pink bike.\n4.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car (or similar vehicle).\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm potential films based on the key elements.**\nThe scene described is highly specific and dramatic. The combination of a teenager, a pink bike, and a game of \"chicken\" with a vehicle is very memorable. This immediately brings to mind a classic 1980s film.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the most likely candidate film.**\nThe film that famously features this exact scene is **Footloose (1984)**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify that *Footloose (1984)* meets all the careful points.**\n*   **Hollywood feature film by a major studio:** *Footloose* was produced and distributed by Paramount Pictures, which is unquestionably a major Hollywood film studio. The film was a major commercial success.\n*   **Teenager:** The character in the scene is Ariel Moore, played by Lori Singer. Ariel is a high school student and the rebellious teenage daughter of the town's reverend.\n*   **Pink bike:** Ariel is shown riding a distinctive light pink bicycle throughout the film. This specific visual element matches the query perfectly.\n*   **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car:** In a memorable scene that establishes her reckless and defiant character, Ariel rides her pink bike onto a highway and pedals straight into the path of a large, oncoming truck. She screams in defiance as the truck bears down on her, only swerving out of the way at the very last second. While the vehicle is a truck, it perfectly fits the context of an \"oncoming car\" as a dangerous, oncoming motor vehicle.\n\n**Step 5: Rule out other possibilities.**\n*   The 2011 remake of *Footloose* features a similar scene of defiance, but it involves two school buses playing chicken, not a character on a pink bike.\n*   Other teen movies featuring bikes, like *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* or *The Goonies*, do not feature a pink bike in such a scene.\n*   *Pretty in Pink* features a pink car (a Karmann Ghia), but not a pink bike involved in this specific action.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed analysis, every element of the question is satisfied by the 1984 film *Footloose*. The scene is a cornerstone of Ariel Moore's character introduction and is an iconic moment in 1980s cinema.\n\n<<<Footloose (1984)>>>"
