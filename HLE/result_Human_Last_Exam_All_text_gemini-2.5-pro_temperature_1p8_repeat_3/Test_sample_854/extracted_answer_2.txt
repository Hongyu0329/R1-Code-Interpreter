The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check because the QC test was fundamentally flawed. The purpose of chloramphenicol in the PDA is to inhibit bacteria. Therefore, a proper QC test should have shown that a bacterium like *Bacillus subtilis* could NOT grow on the medium. The lab staff misinterpreted the growth of the bacterium as a positive sign that the medium was "good," when it actually demonstrated that the medium's selective antibiotic agent was not effective. This flawed QC procedure made them blind to the fact that the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been inactivated by being autoclaved, which is why it later failed to prevent the growth of airborne bacterial contaminants.
