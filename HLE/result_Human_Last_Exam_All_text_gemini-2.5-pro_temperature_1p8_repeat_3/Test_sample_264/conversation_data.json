    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define a Coordinate System and the First Cube (Cube A)**\n\nTo analyze the problem geometrically, we first establish a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. The most convenient way to represent the first cube, let's call it Cube A, is by placing one of its corners at the origin `(0, 0, 0)`.\n\n*   **Cube A:** If Cube A has a side length of 1, it occupies the space defined by the following inequalities:\n    *   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n*   **Volume of Cube A:** `1 × 1 × 1 = 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Shift and Define the Second Cube (Cube B)**\n\nThe second cube, Cube B, is identical to Cube A but is shifted relative to it.\n\n*   **The Main Diagonal:** A main diagonal of Cube A connects opposite vertices. We chose a setup where one vertex is at `(0, 0, 0)` and the opposite vertex is at `(1, 1, 1)`. The vector representing this main diagonal is `d = (1, 1, 1)`.\n\n*   **The Shift Vector:** The problem states Cube B is \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". This phrasing is key.\n    *   **Careful Point (Interpretation):** This could mean two things: (a) the magnitude of the shift vector is 1/2, or (b) the shift components along each axis are 1/2. Interpretation (b) is standard for this type of geometric problem, as the \"main diagonal\" path is composed of equal movements along the x, y, and z axes. It also leads to a much neater problem setup and solution. Therefore, we interpret the shift as a vector `v = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n\n*   **Cube B:** Cube B is formed by adding the shift vector `v` to every point in Cube A. Its region is defined by:\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Region of Intersection**\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the set of all points `(x, y, z)` that satisfy the inequalities for *both* Cube A and Cube B. To find this region, we find the intersection of the coordinate ranges for each axis independently.\n\n*   **x-axis:** The region for x must satisfy both `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` (from Cube A) and `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2` (from Cube B). The common interval is `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n*   **y-axis:** The region for y must satisfy both `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` and `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`. The common interval is `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\n*   **z-axis:** The region for z must satisfy both `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`. The common interval is `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Shape of Intersection):** Because the cubes are axis-aligned, their intersection is also an axis-aligned rectangular prism (in this case, a cube).\n\nThe resulting shape of the intersection is defined by:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\n\nThe region of intersection is a smaller cube. We can calculate the length of its sides:\n*   Side length in x-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in y-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in z-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths:\nVolume = `(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2)`\nVolume = `1/8`\n\n### Final Answer\nThe volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
