    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question's Clues**\n\nThe question asks to identify a novel based on two key pieces of information, both attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  **A description of the novel:** It possesses \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  **A description of the author:** He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Clue (Description of the Novel)**\n\n*   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This metaphor suggests a work that is powerful, visceral, ferocious, and direct in its emotional impact. It implies a narrative with high stakes, perhaps involving themes of violence, passion, or primal forces.\n*   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This comparison points to a highly structured, intricate, and intellectually complex work. A chess game has a limited set of pieces and rules, yet the combinations of moves are immense. This suggests the novel is not a straightforward, linear story but rather a puzzle-like construction where every element (character, event, line of dialogue) is precisely placed and interacts with others in a complex system. The \"variety\" comes from the deep combinatorial possibilities within a constrained framework.\n\n**Careful Point:** We are looking for a novel that is both emotionally powerful and structurally sophisticated. It should feel raw yet be built like a precise mechanism.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Clue (Description of the Author)**\n\n*   **\"A continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\":** This is a critical literary judgment.\n    *   **Continuator of Faulkner:** William Faulkner was a huge influence on the Latin American \"Boom\" writers of the mid-20th century. His techniques—such as stream of consciousness, multiple and unreliable narrators, complex and non-linear timelines, and the creation of a mythical, self-contained fictional territory (like Yoknapatawpha County)—were widely adopted. This clue firmly places the author in the tradition of Latin American modernism.\n    *   **Simplifier:** This is the crucial part. It suggests the author takes Faulkner's complex methods but distills them into a more concise, stark, or accessible form. The author's style is likely less baroque and wordy than Faulkner's, perhaps achieving its complexity through fragmentation and suggestion rather than dense prose.\n\n**Careful Point:** We are not looking for an author who merely imitates Faulkner, but one who refines and condenses his techniques into a unique, and likely more minimalist, style.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Author and Novel**\n\nLet's combine the insights: We need a major Latin American novel known for being both intensely emotional and structurally labyrinthine, written by an author heavily influenced by Faulkner but known for a terse, economical prose style.\n\nSeveral authors could be considered (Vargas Llosa, García Márquez), but one stands out as a perfect fit for all clues: **Juan Rulfo**.\n\n*   **Rulfo as \"Continuator and Simplifier\" of Faulkner:** Rulfo's work, particularly his one novel, is deeply indebted to Faulkner. It features fragmented narratives, a story told by the dead, and the creation of a mythical space (the town of Comala). However, Rulfo's style is the opposite of Faulkner's dense prose; it is famously stark, spare, and poetic. He achieves immense complexity with very few words, fitting the description \"simplifier\" perfectly.\n\n*   **The Novel as a \"Tiger\" and \"Chess Duel\":** Rulfo's novel, *Pedro Páramo*, matches the description exactly.\n    *   **Intensity of a tiger:** The novel is a brutal story of a tyrannical local boss (*cacique*), revolving around themes of violence, desire, death, and damnation. Its atmosphere is haunting and its emotional impact is profound and visceral.\n    *   **Variety of a chess duel:** *Pedro Páramo* is one of the most structurally complex novels in literature. It is told through dozens of unlabeled narrative fragments, shifting between the past and present, and related by a chorus of ghostly voices. The reader must actively piece the entire story together like a puzzle or follow the moves in a complex game, where every fragment is a crucial piece.\n\n**Conclusion:** The novel Borges was referring to is Juan Rulfo's masterpiece, *Pedro Páramo*. Borges wrote a text about the novel where he used these exact descriptions to praise its unique combination of raw power and brilliant structural economy.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
