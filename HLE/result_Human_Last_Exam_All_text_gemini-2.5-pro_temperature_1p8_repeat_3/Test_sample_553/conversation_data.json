    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand the musical terms in the question: \"a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\".\n\n*   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It is built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of G Major, the tonic chord is G Major. In the key of C Major, the tonic chord is C Major.\n*   **Fifth Chord (V):** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In a standard major key, this chord is a major chord (written with a Roman numeral as \"V\"). For example, in the key of G Major, the fifth note is D, and the chord is D Major. In the key of C Major, the fifth note is G, and the chord is G Major.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is the crucial part of the question. It specifies that the chord built on the fifth note is a *minor* chord (written with a lower-case Roman numeral as \"v\"). This is a non-standard chord in a major key and is often \"borrowed\" from the parallel minor key. For example, in the key of C Major, the standard fifth is G Major (G-B-D). The minor fifth would be G minor (G-Bb-D). This switch from a major to a minor chord on the fifth degree creates a very distinctive, often melancholic or wistful, sound.\n*   **Chord Jump at the Start:** This means we are looking for a song whose opening progression is immediately I → v.\n\n### Step 2: Search the Beatles' Catalog for this Progression\n\nNow, we need to think of Beatles songs and analyze their opening chords, specifically looking for the I → v pattern.\n\n1.  **\"A Hard Day's Night\"**: Starts with a famous, unidentifiable dissonant chord. Does not fit.\n2.  **\"Yesterday\"**: In F major. Starts on the F major (I) chord. The second chord is Em7. This is not the minor fifth. Does not fit.\n3.  **\"Help!\"**: In A major. Starts with the band coming in on an A major (I) chord. The next distinct chord is C# minor. This is the iii chord. Does not fit.\n4.  **\"Eleanor Rigby\"**: In E minor. Starts on Em (i) and goes to C major (VI). This is a different progression. Does not fit.\n5.  **\"Michelle\"**: Let's analyze this one carefully.\n    *   **Key:** The song's verses are in the key of **F Major**. This makes the **F Major chord the tonic (I)**.\n    *   **The Fifth:** The fifth note in the key of F Major is **C**.\n    *   **Standard vs. Minor Fifth:** The standard fifth chord would be **C Major (V)**. The \"minor fifth chord\" as requested would be **C minor (v)**.\n    *   **Opening Chords:** The song begins with a distinct descending guitar line. The very first chord is **F Major (I)**. The immediate next chord that the harmony moves to is **C minor** (often played as a C minor 7th).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a perfect match. The song starts with the tonic (F Major) and immediately \"jumps\" to the minor fifth (C minor). The progression is **I → v**.\n\n### Step 3: Final Analysis and Careful Points\n\n*   **The Song:** The song that fits the description is \"Michelle\" from the album *Rubber Soul*.\n*   **The Harmonic Device:** The use of a minor v chord in a major key is a classic example of \"modal interchange\" or \"borrowing\" from the parallel minor key. The key of F Major has a C Major chord as its V chord. The key of F minor (the parallel minor) has a C minor chord as its v chord. Paul McCartney borrows the Cm from F minor to use in F Major, which gives the opening its unique, sophisticated, and slightly somber \"French\" sound.\n*   **Confirmation:** No other famous Beatles song features such a clear I → v progression right at its beginning. This harmonic signature is a defining characteristic of \"Michelle\".\n\nTherefore, after a step-by-step analysis of the music theory and the Beatles' discography, the answer is definitively identified.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
