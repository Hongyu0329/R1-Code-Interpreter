    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Barbell Graph Structure**\n1.  **Definition**: A barbell graph is formed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge.\n2.  **Parameters**: The problem specifies a barbell graph with 10 nodes. This means the two cliques must each have 5 nodes (5 nodes + 5 nodes = 10 nodes).\n3.  **Components**:\n    *   Two complete graphs, K5, let's call them Clique A and Clique B.\n    *   A \"bottleneck edge\" (also called a bridge) that connects one node from Clique A to one node from Clique B.\n4.  **Node Types**: We can categorize the nodes based on their position and connections.\n    *   **Bridge Nodes**: The two nodes at either end of the bottleneck edge. There is one such node in each clique. Let's call them `u_A` and `u_B`.\n    *   **Internal Nodes**: The other nodes within the cliques. There are 4 internal nodes in Clique A and 4 internal nodes in Clique B, for a total of 8.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Randomized Uniform Gossiping Process**\n1.  **Process**: Randomized uniform gossiping is a two-stage random process for communication in a network. In each step:\n    *   First, a node `u` is selected uniformly at random from the entire set of nodes `V`.\n    *   Second, the selected node `u` chooses one of its neighbors `v` uniformly at random.\n2.  **Goal**: We want to find the probability that the chosen communication link is the bottleneck edge. The edge `(u, v)` is considered \"sampled\" if the gossip process involves node `u` choosing neighbor `v`, or node `v` choosing neighbor `u`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Degree of Each Node**\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. This is crucial for calculating the probability of choosing a specific neighbor.\n1.  **Degree of Bridge Nodes (`u_A`, `u_B`)**:\n    *   Each bridge node is part of a K5 clique, so it's connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique.\n    *   It is also connected to the bridge node in the other clique via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree `d(u_A)` = (5 - 1) + 1 = 5.\n    *   Similarly, `d(u_B)` = (5 - 1) + 1 = 5.\n2.  **Degree of Internal Nodes**:\n    *   Each internal node is only connected to the other nodes within its K5 clique.\n    *   The degree of any node in a K5 graph is (5 - 1) = 4.\n    *   So, all 8 internal nodes have a degree of 4.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**\nLet the bottleneck edge be `e_b = (u_A, u_B)`. This edge is sampled in one of two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  Node `u_A` is chosen, and it then selects `u_B` as its neighbor.\n2.  Node `u_B` is chosen, and it then selects `u_A` as its neighbor.\n\nWe calculate the probability of each event and add them together.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 1 (u_A → u_B)**:\n    *   The probability of selecting `u_A` from the 10 total nodes is `P(u_A) = 1/10`.\n    *   Given `u_A` is selected, the probability of it choosing its neighbor `u_B` is `P(u_B | u_A) = 1 / d(u_A) = 1/5`.\n    *   So, `P(u_A → u_B) = P(u_A) * P(u_B | u_A) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 2 (u_B → u_A)**:\n    *   The probability of selecting `u_B` from the 10 total nodes is `P(u_B) = 1/10`.\n    *   Given `u_B` is selected, the probability of it choosing its neighbor `u_A` is `P(u_A | u_B) = 1 / d(u_B) = 1/5`.\n    *   So, `P(u_B → u_A) = P(u_B) * P(u_A | u_B) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **Total Probability**:\n    *   The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge `e_b` is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n    *   `P(e_b) = P(u_A → u_B) + P(u_B → u_A) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50`.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\nThe probability simplifies to `1/25`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Graph Identification**: Correctly interpreting \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" as two K5 cliques connected by one edge is the first critical step.\n*   **Gossiping Process**: It's important to understand the two-stage uniform selection: first a node from the whole graph, then a neighbor of that specific node.\n*   **Degree Calculation**: Accurately calculating the degrees of the different types of nodes is essential. A mistake here would propagate through the entire calculation. The bridge nodes have a higher degree (5) than the internal nodes (4).\n*   **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Recognizing that the edge `(u_A, u_B)` can be sampled by communication flowing in either direction and that these are distinct, mutually exclusive outcomes in the random process.\n*   **Final Simplification**: Simplify the final fraction to its lowest terms. `2/50` becomes `1/25`.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
