    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Visual Description:** The flag of Denmark is a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross is off-center, towards the hoist side.\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** To analyze the flag as a matrix, we represent its colors with numerical values. The problem states we must choose values to *maximize* the rank. Let's assign the color Red a value `r` and White a value `w`, with `r ≠ w`. To maximize rank, we should also assume `r ≠ 0` and `w ≠ 0` unless it's a single-color flag. A good choice would be `r=1` and `w=2`.\n3.  **Structure and Rank Calculation:** A simplified matrix of the Danish flag would look like this (ignoring exact proportions and focusing on the structure):\n    ```\n    r r w r r\n    r r w r r\n    w w w w w\n    r r w r r\n    r r w r r\n    ```\n    Let's identify the different types of row vectors in this matrix.\n    *   Rows that do not pass through the horizontal bar of the cross have the form `v_r = (r, r, w, r, r)`.\n    *   Rows that pass through the horizontal bar of the cross have the form `v_w = (w, w, w, w, w)`.\n\n    The entire set of row vectors is composed of these two types. The rank of the matrix will be the dimension of the space spanned by these vectors. We need to check if `v_r` and `v_w` are linearly independent.\n\n    Suppose `a * v_r + b * v_w = 0` for scalars `a` and `b`.\n    `a * (r, r, w, r, r) + b * (w, w, w, w, w) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)`\n    This gives us two distinct equations based on the columns:\n    1.  `a*r + b*w = 0` (from columns 1, 2, 4, 5)\n    2.  `a*w + b*w = 0` (from column 3)\n\n    From equation (2), `(a + b)w = 0`. Since we chose `w ≠ 0`, we must have `a + b = 0`, which means `a = -b`.\n    Substituting this into equation (1): `(-b)*r + b*w = 0`, which simplifies to `b*(w - r) = 0`.\n    Since Red and White are different colors, we have `w ≠ r`, so `w - r ≠ 0`. Therefore, `b` must be 0.\n    If `b = 0`, then `a = -b = 0`.\n    The only solution is `a=0` and `b=0`, which means the vectors `v_r` and `v_w` are linearly independent. Since all rows in the matrix are one of these two types, the row space is spanned by these two vectors.\n\n    Thus, the maximal rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Identify African Flags with a Maximal Rank of 2\n\nWe are looking for flags whose design, when converted into a matrix, produces exactly two linearly independent row (or column) vectors.\n\n**Flags with Rank 1 (to be excluded):**\n*   **Monocolor flags:** All rows are identical (or multiples of each other). Rank is 1.\n*   **Simple horizontally/vertically striped flags (no emblems):** For horizontal stripes of colors C1, C2, ..., all row vectors are of the form `(C_i, C_i, ..., C_i)`. These are all scalar multiples of the vector `(1, 1, ..., 1)`, making them linearly dependent. The rank is 1. A similar argument holds for vertical stripes and column vectors. Examples: Nigeria, Botswana, Gabon.\n\n**Flags with Rank 2:**\nThe design must introduce a variation that breaks the simple dependency of striped or monocolor flags, but only in a limited way that generates one additional basis vector. Common patterns include:\n\n1.  **A simple background (rank 1) with a central emblem.** The emblem's color(s) introduce new, linearly independent row/column vectors.\n    *   **Solid Field + Emblem:** A solid color field (rank 1) with a central emblem of a different color.\n        *   Example: A blue field with a white star. Rows are either `(b,b,b,...)` or `(b,...,b,w,b,...,b)`. These two forms are linearly independent.\n        *   Candidates: **Morocco**, **Somalia**, **Tunisia**.\n    *   **Striped Field + Emblem:** A striped flag (rank 1) where an emblem is placed on one of the stripes, changing the composition of those rows.\n        *   Example: Ghana (R/Y/G horizontal stripes, black star on yellow). Rows are `(r,r,r)`, `(y,b,y)`, `(g,g,g)`. The vectors `(1,1,1)` and `(y,b,y)` are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n        *   Candidates: **Angola**, **Burkina Faso**, **Cameroon**, **Ghana**, **Libya**, **Mauritania**, **Senegal**.\n\n2.  **Partitions of the field into simple geometric shapes.**\n    *   **Hoist Triangle and Stripes:** A triangle at the hoist with horizontal stripes filling the rest. The rows in the striped section have the form `(t, ..., t, c_i, ..., c_i)`, where `t` is the triangle color and `c_i` is a stripe color. It can be shown that all such rows can be constructed from just two basis vectors.\n        *   Candidates: **Djibouti**, **Sudan**.\n    *   **Vertical Band and Stripes:** A vertical band on the hoist side with horizontal stripes next to it.\n        *   Example: Benin (Green vertical, Yellow/Red horizontal). The column vectors are `(g,g,g,g)^T` and `(y,y,r,r)^T`. These are linearly independent. Rank is 2.\n        *   Candidates: **Benin**, **Guinea-Bissau**, **Madagascar**.\n    *   **Other Partitions**:\n        *   **Algeria**: A vertical bicolor with the emblem on the dividing line. The column space is spanned by `{ (1,1,1,...)^T, (g,...,r,...,g)^T }`. Rank 2.\n        *   **Central African Republic**: Four horizontal stripes crossed by one vertical stripe. The column space is spanned by `{(b,w,g,y)^T, (r,r,r,r)^T}`. Rank 2.\n\n**Flags with Rank > 2 (to be excluded):**\nFlags with more complex designs, such as multiple partitions, complex emblems with many colors, or diagonal layouts often produce three or more linearly independent vectors. Examples: South Africa, Eritrea, Burundi.\n\n### Final List of Flags\n\nBased on the analysis, the following African flags have a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark. They are grouped by their characteristic pattern.\n\n*   **Hoist Triangle with Stripes:**\n    *   Djibouti\n    *   Sudan\n*   **Vertical Band with Horizontal Stripes:**\n    *   Benin\n    *   Guinea-Bissau\n    *   Madagascar\n*   **Striped Field with an Emblem:**\n    *   Angola\n    *   Burkina Faso\n    *   Cameroon\n    *   Ghana\n    *   Libya\n    *   Senegal\n*   **Solid Field with an Emblem:**\n    *   Mauritania\n    *   Morocco\n    *   Somalia\n    *   Tunisia\n*   **Other Rank-2 Partitions:**\n    *   Algeria\n    *   Central African Republic\n\n<<<Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Djibouti, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Libya, Madagascar, Mauritania, Morocco, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia>>>"
