    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Question**\n\nThe prompt asks for the answer to a question posed by the title of a haiku. The title is \"The Bays\". The answer must be presented in alphabetical order. This implies the answer consists of multiple words.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points**\n\n*   **The Title:** \"The Bays\" is most likely a play on words, a homophone for \"The B's\". The question is, \"What are the 'B' words?\"\n*   **The Haiku:** Each line of the haiku is a clue that describes a word starting with the letter 'B'.\n*   **Alphabetical Order:** The final answer isn't just the words, but the words listed in alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Clues Line by Line**\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   A tempest is a violent, windy storm.\n    *   A primary action of a strong wind is to \"blow\".\n    *   This line describes a strong **Blow**. This is our first 'B' word.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" calculates to `2 * 15 = 30`.\n    *   We need to find a 'B' word associated with the number 30 and the concept of \"winds of change\".\n    *   In the Bible, Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver.\n    *   This act of **Betrayal** was a pivotal event that brought about immense \"winds of change\" in the foundation of Christianity. This is our second 'B' word.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   \"A divine one\" refers to something sacred or from God. \"Yields\" means it produces or provides something.\n    *   The holy **Bible** is considered a divine text by Christians, and it \"yields\" scripture, commandments, parables, and wisdom. This fits the clue perfectly and is our third 'B' word.\n\n**Step 4: Consolidate and Order the Answer**\n\n*   The three 'B' words we have found are: Blow, Betrayal, and Bible.\n*   The question requires the answer to be in alphabetical order.\n*   Arranging these words alphabetically gives us: Betrayal, Bible, Blow.\n\n<<<Betrayal, Bible, Blow>>>"
