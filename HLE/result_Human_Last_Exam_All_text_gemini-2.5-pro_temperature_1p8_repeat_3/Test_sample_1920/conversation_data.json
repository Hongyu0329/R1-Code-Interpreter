    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we will follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $53599$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n    \\item Trying division by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n    \\item Next, we factorize 7657. Trying division by 13: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n    \\item Next, we factorize 589. Trying division by 19: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n    \\item The number 31 is a prime number.\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThis is a square-free integer, which simplifies the analysis.\n\n**Step 2: Structure of Dirichlet Characters for a Square-Free Conductor**\n\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo $d$ is isomorphic to the direct product of the groups of characters for each prime factor. A character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo the prime $p$.\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\nLet's find the orders of these groups:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $p=7$: order is $\\phi(7) = 6$.\n    \\item For $p=13$: order is $\\phi(13) = 12$.\n    \\item For $p=19$: order is $\\phi(19) = 18$.\n    \\item For $p=31$: order is $\\phi(31) = 30$.\n\\end{itemize}\nIn a cyclic group of order $N$, the number of elements of order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $N$.\n\n**Step 3: Conditions for the Character $\\chi$**\n\nWe have two conditions on the character $\\chi$:\n1.  **It must be primitive with conductor $d$.** For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, a character $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\chi_{p_2} \\cdots \\chi_{p_k}$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p_i}$ is non-principal. A character is non-principal if its order is greater than 1.\n2.  **It must have order 6.** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n    $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_7), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Counting the Characters**\n\nLet $k_p = \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_p)$. From the order condition $\\operatorname{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$, it follows that each $k_p$ must be a divisor of 6. The divisors of 6 are $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nFrom the primitivity condition, each $\\chi_p$ must be non-principal, which means $k_p > 1$.\nSo for each prime factor $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, the order $k_p$ of the component character $\\chi_p$ must belong to the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nNote that for each prime $p$, the order of the character group $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of 6. Therefore, characters of order 2, 3, and 6 exist for each component.\n\nWe can count the desired characters using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nLet $S$ be the set of all primitive characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d$ whose order divides 6.\nLet $S_k$ be the set of all primitive characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d$ with order exactly $k$.\n\nWe want to find $|S_6|$. The set $S$ is the disjoint union of $S_2$, $S_3$, and $S_6$. (The order cannot be 1 as the character is primitive).\nSo, $|S_6| = |S| - |S_2| - |S_3|$.\n\n*   **Count $|S|$: Primitive characters with order dividing 6.**\n    For a character in $S$, each component $\\chi_p$ must be non-principal (order > 1) and have an order that divides 6. So, $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_p) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    For each prime $p$, the number of available characters $\\chi_p$ is:\n    (Number of order 2) + (Number of order 3) + (Number of order 6)\n    $= \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Since there are 4 prime factors, the total number of such characters is:\n    $|S| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n*   **Count $|S_2|$: Primitive characters with order 2.**\n    For a character in $S_2$, we need $\\operatorname{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 2$. This implies that each $k_p$ must divide 2. Combined with the primitivity condition ($k_p > 1$), this means $k_p = 2$ for all four primes.\n    For each prime $p$, the number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    So, $|S_2| = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n*   **Count $|S_3|$: Primitive characters with order 3.**\n    For a character in $S_3$, we need $\\operatorname{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 3$. This implies that each $k_p$ must divide 3. Combined with the primitivity condition ($k_p > 1$), this means $k_p = 3$ for all four primes.\n    For each prime $p$, the number of characters of order 3 is $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    So, $|S_3| = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   **Final Calculation.**\n    The number of primitive characters of order 6 is:\n    $|S_6| = |S| - |S_2| - |S_3| = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nFinal check of the logic: An alternative way to state the condition $\\operatorname{lcm}(k_p) = 6$ for $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is that:\n(1) The set of orders $\\{k_p\\}$ must contain at least one multiple of 2 (i.e., at least one order is 2 or 6).\n(2) The set of orders $\\{k_p\\}$ must contain at least one multiple of 3 (i.e., at least one order is 3 or 6).\nThe calculation using inclusion-exclusion correctly implements this. We take all possibilities where orders are from $\\{2,3,6\\}$ and subtract the cases where all orders are multiples of 2 but not 3 (i.e., all orders are 2) and cases where all orders are multiples of 3 but not 2 (i.e., all orders are 3). This gives the cases where there is a mix of prime factors 2 and 3 in the orders, which results in an lcm of 6.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nNumber = (Total ways to choose component characters of order 2, 3, or 6) - (Ways where all have order 2) - (Ways where all have order 3)\nNumber = $(\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6))^4 - (\\phi(2))^4 - (\\phi(3))^4$\nNumber = $(1+2+2)^4 - 1^4 - 2^4$\nNumber = $5^4 - 1 - 16$\nNumber = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
