    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user is asking for the name of the specific value that is measured *between* individual heartbeats. This value is then used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The measurement technology mentioned is PPG (Photoplethysmography).\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Measurement:** The fundamental data for both Heart Rate (HR) and HRV is the time duration between successive heartbeats. HR is the average of these beats over a minute, while HRV focuses on the variation in the length of these time durations from one beat to the next.\n\n3.  **Determine the Technical Terminology:**\n    *   The \"gold standard\" for measuring heart activity is the electrocardiogram (ECG), which tracks the heart's electrical signals. The most prominent feature of the ECG waveform is the QRS complex, with the \"R wave\" being the highest peak. The time elapsed between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   The question specifies that PPG is used. PPG measures changes in blood volume in the peripheral circulation (like a fingertip or wrist). It produces a pulse wave, and the time between the peaks of consecutive pulse waves is measured. This is most accurately called the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** or sometimes the Peak-to-Peak Interval (PPI).\n\n4.  **Connect the Terms:** In practice, especially in consumer wearables, the IBI measured by a PPG sensor is used as a direct proxy for the R-R interval measured by an ECG. Because the entire field of HRV analysis was built upon the concept of R-R intervals from ECGs, the term **R-R interval** is often used interchangeably with IBI, even when the data source is a PPG sensor.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Answer:** The value measured between heartbeats is a time interval. This time interval is the raw data from which all HRV metrics are calculated. The most common and foundational name for this value is the \"R-R interval,\" although \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\" is also correct and technically more specific for PPG technology.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinction between the Interval and HRV:** It is critical not to confuse the raw measurement (the time interval between beats) with HRV itself. HRV is not a single value but a collection of statistical metrics (e.g., RMSSD, SDNN) calculated from a series of these time intervals. The question asks for the name of the interval itself.\n*   **Measurement Units:** This value is a measure of time, typically expressed in milliseconds (ms).\n*   **Source of Data (ECG vs. PPG):** While the question specifies PPG, the terminology is heavily influenced by the medical standard, which is ECG. \"R-R interval\" is the standard term in HRV literature, and \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\" is what's being measured by the PPG to approximate it.\n*   **What HRV Represents:** A higher variation in R-R intervals (a higher HRV) is generally a sign of a healthy, adaptable autonomic nervous system, while a very low variation can be an indicator of stress or potential health issues.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe value computed between heartbeats is the time duration. The most widely recognized and foundational term for this duration in the context of Heart Rate Variability analysis is the **R-R interval**.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
