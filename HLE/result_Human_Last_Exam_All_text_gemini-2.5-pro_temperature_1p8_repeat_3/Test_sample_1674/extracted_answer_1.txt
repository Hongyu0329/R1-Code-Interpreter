Yes, this theory can not hold if a birefringent medium is added. The theory relies on the second system being able to perfectly reverse the transformations of the first system to recover the original input beam. A birefringent medium acts on the polarization state of light. By adding it to the first system, the polarization of the output beam (output 1) is altered. The second system, as described, is only set up to invert the effects of the random medium (via T⁻¹) and free-space propagation. It does not contain an element to reverse the polarization changes caused by the birefringent medium. Therefore, the final polarization state of output 2 will be different from the original input beam's polarization, meaning the original beam is not recovered and the theory fails.
