    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the character the protagonist marries in Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the novel and its main character:** The novel is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" by Jacek Dukaj. The main character, a human from the 21st century resurrected in the far future, is Adam Zamoyski.\n\n2.  **Analyze the core question:** The question asks for the name of the person Adam Zamoyski marries. It's important to understand that in the high-concept, post-human world of the novel, \"marriage\" may not take a traditional form. We need to look for a character with whom Adam forms a formal, lasting, and defining union or partnership.\n\n3.  **Recall the central relationships in the novel:** Adam Zamoyski's most significant and transformative relationship is with a powerful post-human entity. This relationship evolves throughout the story from a dynamic of protector/protected and guide/follower to a much deeper, symbiotic bond.\n\n4.  **Identify the specific character:** This key post-human character is named **Angelina**. She is an incredibly powerful and influential being, and her relationship with Adam is central to the plot's development and conclusion.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the nature of their bond as a \"marriage\":** While there isn't a traditional wedding ceremony, the union between Adam and Angelina is the novel's equivalent of a marriage. He becomes her \"Phylarch,\" a role that is essentially a lifelong guardian, partner, and anchor. This is a formal, recognized, and profound bond that commits them to each other, defining both of their existences going forward. In the context of the story's universe, this is the most fitting answer to the concept of marriage.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **The concept of \"marriage\" is abstract:** The union is not a simple romantic or legal contract as we understand it today. It is a complex, post-human political and existential alliance.\n*   **Protagonist's identity:** It's crucial to correctly identify Adam Zamoyski as the main character.\n*   **Key character's name:** The name of the post-human he unites with is Angelina, not to be confused with any other character he interacts with.\n*   **Finality of the union:** The bond formed at the end of the book is the climactic relational event for the protagonist, solidifying it as the correct answer.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the character in question. The protagonist Adam Zamoyski enters into a life-defining partnership with the post-human entity known as Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
