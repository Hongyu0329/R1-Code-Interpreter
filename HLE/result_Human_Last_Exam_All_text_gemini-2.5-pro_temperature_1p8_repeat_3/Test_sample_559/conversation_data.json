    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$$\n$$u' = u^2(u-1)$$\nWe are considering the phase plane $(u, d)$ for the region $u \\geq 0$.\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Separatrices are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points. Our goal is to find the equation of this curve.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points $(u, d)$ are found by setting both derivatives to zero: $u' = 0$ and $d' = 0$.\n\nFrom $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow, substitute these values of $u$ into the equation $d' = 0$.\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    $2d^2 + (5(0)^2 - 3(0))d - 0^3(1-0) = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    $2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1-1) = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points of the system are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**Step 3: Linearize the System and Classify the Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d)$ of the system:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u - 3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each non-degenerate equilibrium point.\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10(1) - 3)(0) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive real numbers, (1, 0) is an **unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10(1) - 3)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7 - 3 + 4 & -4 + 5 - 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, (1, -1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so the point is degenerate and linearization does not determine its stability.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Manifolds of the Saddle Point**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (1, -1). Let's find the eigenvectors at (1, -1).\n*   For the unstable manifold ($\\lambda_1 = 1$):\n    $(J - 1 \\cdot I)v = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    This gives $-6v_u - 3v_d = 0$, or $v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is $v_{unstable} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The unstable manifold is tangent to the line with slope -2 at (1, -1).\n\n*   For the stable manifold ($\\lambda_2 = -2$):\n    $(J - (-2) \\cdot I)v = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    This gives $3v_u = 0$, so $v_u=0$. The eigenvector is $v_{stable} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The stable manifold is tangent to the vertical line $u=1$ at (1, -1). In fact, the line $u=1$ is an invariant line for the system, and the ray $u=1, d<0$ constitutes the stable manifold of (1, -1).\n\n**Step 5: Find the Equation of the Unstable Manifold**\n\nWe look for an exact invariant curve of the system, which could correspond to the unstable manifold. Let's test a simple polynomial form, $d = f(u)$. A common technique for such problems is to try a polynomial of the same degree as the nonlinearities in the system. Let's test $d=au^2+bu+c$.\nLet's test the specific form $d = au^2 + bu$.\n$d' = (2au+b)u' = (2au+b)u^2(u-1) = 2au^4+(b-2a)u^3-bu^2$.\nSubstitute $d=au^2+bu$ into the right-hand side of the $d'$ equation:\n$2(au^2+bu)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(au^2+bu) - u^3+u^4$\n$= (2a^2+5a+1)u^4 + (4ab-3a+5b-1)u^3 + (2b^2-3b)u^2$.\nEquating the coefficients of the powers of $u$ in both expressions for $d'$:\n*   $u^2: \\quad -b = 2b^2 - 3b \\implies 2b^2 - 2b = 0 \\implies 2b(b-1)=0 \\implies b=0$ or $b=1$.\n*   $u^4: \\quad 2a = 2a^2 + 5a + 1 \\implies 2a^2 + 3a + 1 = 0 \\implies (2a+1)(a+1)=0 \\implies a=-1/2$ or $a=-1$.\n*   $u^3: \\quad b-2a = 4ab-3a+5b-1 \\implies 4ab-a+4b-1 = 0$.\n\nLet's test the possible pairs of $(a,b)$:\n*   If $b=0$, the $u^3$ equation gives $-a-1=0 \\implies a=-1$. This matches one of the possible values for $a$. So, $(a,b) = (-1, 0)$ is a solution.\n    This gives the invariant curve $d = -u^2$.\n*   If $b=1$, the $u^3$ equation gives $4a-a+4-1=0 \\implies 3a+3=0 \\implies a=-1$. This also matches. So, $(a,b) = (-1, 1)$ is a solution.\n    This gives the invariant curve $d = -u^2+u = u(1-u)$.\n\nWe have found two invariant curves: $d = -u^2$ and $d = u(1-u)$.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrix is an invariant manifold of the saddle point. We need to check which of these two curves corresponds to a manifold of the saddle point (1, -1).\n*   Curve $d = -u^2$: At $u=1$, $d=-(1)^2=-1$. It passes through (1, -1). The slope of this curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is -2. This matches the slope of the unstable eigenvector $v_{unstable} = (1, -2)^T$. Therefore, the curve **$d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1)**.\n\n*   Curve $d = u(1-u)$: At $u=1$, $d=1(1-1)=0$. It passes through (1, 0), not the saddle point. This curve is a trajectory that connects the unstable node (1, 0) to the origin (0, 0).\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point is a separatrix. It separates trajectories based on their origin and/or long-term fate. In this system:\n*   For $0 < u < 1$, the curve $d = -u^2$ separates trajectories originating from the unstable node (1, 0) from those originating from the stable manifold of the saddle (1, -1).\n*   For $u > 1$, the curve $d = -u^2$ separates trajectories that tend towards $d \\to +\\infty$ from those that tend towards $d \\to -\\infty$ as $u \\to \\infty$.\n\nThus, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the principal separatrix for this system.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
