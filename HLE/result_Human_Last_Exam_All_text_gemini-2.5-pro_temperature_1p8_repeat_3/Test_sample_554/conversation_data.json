    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the chemical name \"perfluoronanocar\".**\n\n*   **\"perfluoro-\"**: This is a standard prefix in organic chemistry. It signifies that all hydrogen (H) atoms attached to the carbon backbone of the parent molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n*   **\"-nanocar\"**: This is the parent molecule. It refers to a class of molecular machines designed to resemble a macroscopic automobile, but on a nanometer scale.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific \"nanocar\" structure and its chemical formula.**\n\n*   The term \"nanocar\" was popularized by the research group of Professor James M. Tour at Rice University. While several versions exist, the most iconic and seminal example is the original nanocar synthesized in 2005.\n*   This specific nanocar consists of two main parts:\n    1.  An **H-shaped chassis** made from an oligo(phenylene ethynylene) structure, which also includes the axles.\n    2.  Four **fullerene (C₆₀)** molecules that act as the wheels.\n*   According to the original scientific publication (*Nano Letters*, 2005, 5 (11), pp 2330–2334), the confirmed molecular formula of this entire nanocar molecule is **C₃₀₄H₃₆**. This formula accounts for the carbon atoms in both the chassis and the four C₆₀ wheels (4 x 60 = 240 carbons for the wheels, plus 64 carbons for the chassis/axle assembly) and the hydrogen atoms on the chassis.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the \"perfluoro-\" chemical modification.**\n\n*   Following the definition from Step 1, creating a \"perfluoronanocar\" means taking the parent nanocar (C₃₀₄H₃₆) and replacing every hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom.\n*   The parent molecule has **36 hydrogen atoms**.\n*   Therefore, the perfluorination process involves substituting these 36 hydrogen atoms with 36 fluorine atoms.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final number of fluorine atoms.**\n\n*   Since each of the 36 hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar is replaced by one fluorine atom, the resulting \"perfluoronanocar\" molecule would contain exactly **36 fluorine atoms**.\n*   The molecular formula of this hypothetical molecule would be C₃₀₄F₃₆.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"perfluoro-\":** It is crucial to use the standard chemical definition, which is the substitution of hydrogen atoms only. A broader interpretation like \"exhaustive fluorination\" (adding fluorine across double bonds or onto the fullerene cage) is non-standard for this prefix when applied to a parent hydrocarbon framework.\n2.  **Choice of Nanocar:** The answer depends critically on which nanocar is being considered. The original 2005 version (C₃₀₄H₃₆) is the most logical choice. A later version designed for the 2017 Nanocar Race has a different structure and formula (C₉₂H₉₂), which would lead to an answer of 92. Without further specification, the original design is the default.\n3.  **Source of Hydrogens:** All 36 hydrogen atoms are part of the chassis/axle structure. The fullerene wheels (C₆₀) are all-carbon allotropes and do not contain hydrogen, so they are not directly involved in the hydrogen-fluorine substitution process defined by the \"perfluoro-\" prefix.\n\nBased on the analysis of the most iconic nanocar molecule and standard chemical nomenclature, the number of fluorine atoms is determined by the number of hydrogen atoms in the original structure.\n\n<<<36>>>"
