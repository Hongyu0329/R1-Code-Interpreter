    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage of irreducible objects in the category of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ a primitive third root of unity.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Algebraic Setting\nLet $U_q = u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ be the quantum group associated with the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C}$. The user specifies that $q$ is a primitive third root of unity, for example, $q = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$. This is a crucial condition. When $q$ is a root of unity, the representation theory of $U_q$ differs significantly from the generic case (where $q$ is not a root of unity).\n\nThe smallest positive integer $d$ such that $q^{2d}=1$ is $\\ell=3$. In this setting, the elements $E^\\ell, F^\\ell, K^\\ell$ are central in $U_q$. The representation theory of $U_q$ is closely related to that of the \"small\" or \"restricted\" quantum group, often denoted $u_q$, which is the finite-dimensional algebra obtained by taking the quotient of $U_q$ by the ideal generated by $E^\\ell=0, F^\\ell=0, K^\\ell=1$. For simplicity and as is common for this type of problem, we will focus on the representations of this restricted quantum group $u_q$, as the overall structure of indecomposables for $U_q$ is built upon those of $u_q$.\n\nThe category $C$ mentioned in the question is the collection of all non-isomorphic indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $U_q$.\n\n### Step 2: Classifying the Simple (Irreducible) Objects\nThe irreducible representations (also called simple objects) of $u_q$ are well-known. They are analogs of the classical representations of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C}$ but are restricted in dimension by the parameter $\\ell$.\nFor $\\ell=3$, there are exactly $\\ell=3$ non-isomorphic simple modules, which we can denote by their dimension:\n*   $L_1$: The trivial representation of dimension 1.\n*   $L_2$: An irreducible representation of dimension 2.\n*   $L_3$: An irreducible representation of dimension 3.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Category Structure and Indecomposable Objects\nA key point is that for $q$ a root of unity, the category of finite-dimensional representations is **not semisimple**. This means there exist representations that are indecomposable but not irreducible (i.e., reducible).\n\nThe algebra $u_q$ for $\\ell=3$ is of **tame representation type**. This means that its indecomposable representations can be classified, but there are infinitely many of them. Specifically, for certain dimensions, there exist one-parameter families of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n*   **Irreducible objects:** $L_1, L_2, L_3$ (a finite set of 3 objects).\n*   **Reducible indecomposable objects:** There are some discrete ones (like the projective covers of simple modules), but more importantly, there are infinite families of them (so-called \"band modules\").\n\nSince there are only 3 irreducible objects but infinitely many indecomposable objects, a naive calculation of the percentage ($3/\\infty$) would yield 0%. This suggests that the question requires a more nuanced interpretation.\n\n### Step 4: Decomposing the Category into Blocks\nA non-semisimple category can be decomposed into a direct sum of smaller, indecomposable subcategories called **blocks**. To understand the properties of the whole category, we can analyze each block individually. Two simple modules belong to the same block if they are linked by a sequence of non-split extensions.\n\nFor $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at an $\\ell$-th root of unity, the simple modules $L_c$ and $L_{c'}$ are in the same block if and only if they have the same \"linkage class\". For $\\ell=3$, the rule simplifies: $L_c$ and $L_{c'}$ are in the same block if and only if $c$ and $c'$ have the same parity.\n\nApplying this rule to our simple modules $L_1, L_2, L_3$:\n1.  **The Principal Block ($B_{odd}$):** $L_1$ and $L_3$ are in the same block because their dimensions (1 and 3) are both odd.\n2.  **A separate Block ($B_{even}$):** $L_2$ is in a block by itself because its dimension (2) is even.\n\nThus, the category of representations decomposes into two blocks.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Percentage of Irreducibles within Each Block\nThe most natural interpretation of the question is to find the percentage of irreducibles within each block and then average the results.\n\n*   **Analysis of $B_{even}$:**\n    This block contains only one simple object, $L_2$. For a finite-dimensional algebra, any block containing only a single simple object must be a simple (i.e., semisimple) block. In a semisimple category, every object is a direct sum of simple objects. Therefore, the only indecomposable object in this block is the simple object $L_2$ itself.\n    *   Number of indecomposable objects in $B_{even}$: 1 (namely $L_2$).\n    *   Number of irreducible objects in $B_{even}$: 1 (namely $L_2$).\n    *   Percentage of irreducibles in this block = ($1/1$) * 100% = **100%**.\n\n*   **Analysis of $B_{odd}$:**\n    This block contains two simple objects, $L_1$ and $L_3$. It is known that this block is not semisimple (e.g., $\\text{Ext}^1(L_1, L_3) \\neq 0$). As mentioned in Step 3, this block is of tame representation type and contains infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n    *   Number of indecomposable objects in $B_{odd}$: Infinite.\n    *   Number of irreducible objects in $B_{odd}$: 2 (namely $L_1$ and $L_3$).\n    *   Percentage of irreducibles in this block = ($2/\\infty$) = **0%**.\n\n### Step 6: Averaging the Results\nWe have two blocks of representation theory. One is \"fully\" irreducible, while the other is \"almost entirely\" reducible and indecomposable. By giving equal weight to each block, we can compute an average percentage.\nAverage Percentage = (Percentage from Block 1 + Percentage from Block 2) / (Number of Blocks)\nAverage Percentage = (100% + 0%) / 2 = 50%\n\nThis interpretation resolves the issue of counting an infinite number of objects by considering the structural decomposition of the category.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{50}$.\n\n<<<50>>>"
