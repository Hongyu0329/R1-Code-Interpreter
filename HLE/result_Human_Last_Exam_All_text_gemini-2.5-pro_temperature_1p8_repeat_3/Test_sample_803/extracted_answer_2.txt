The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the semidirect products $G = P \rtimes C_2$, where $P$ is a Sylow $q$-subgroup of $G$ and the action of the non-identity element of $C_2$ on $P$ is a non-trivial automorphism $\alpha$, satisfying one of the following two conditions:
1.  $P$ is an abelian group that is not elementary abelian, and $\alpha$ is the inversion automorphism ($p \mapsto p^{-1}$ for all $p \in P$).
2.  $P$ is an elementary abelian group of order $q^m$ (isomorphic to $(C_q)^m$), and $\alpha$ is any non-identity involutive automorphism of $P$.
