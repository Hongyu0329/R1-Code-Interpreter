    "A finite group G is filled if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G fills G. A known equivalent condition for a group G to be filled is that for every element $x \\in G$, there exists an automorphism $\\phi \\in \\text{Aut}(G)$ such that $\\phi(x) = x^{-1}$. Such groups are also called A-groups. We need to find all nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the group G.**\nLet $|G| = 2q^m$. By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow $q$-subgroups, $n_q$, must divide 2 and satisfy $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$. Since $q$ is an odd prime, $n_q=2$ would imply $2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$, which means $q$ divides 1, an impossibility. Therefore, $n_q=1$.\nThis means the Sylow $q$-subgroup, let's call it $P$, is unique and thus normal in $G$. The order of $P$ is $q^m$. The Sylow 2-subgroup has order 2. Let's call it $C_2$.\nSo, $G$ must be a semidirect product $G = P \\rtimes_\\alpha C_2$, where $C_2 = \\langle y \\mid y^2=e \\rangle$ and $\\alpha: C_2 \\to \\text{Aut}(P)$ is a group homomorphism. The homomorphism is determined by the image of the generator $y$, which must be an automorphism of $P$, let's call it $\\alpha_y$. Since $y^2=e$, we must have $(\\alpha_y)^2 = \\text{id}_P$. So $\\alpha_y$ is an involutive automorphism of $P$.\nThe group $G$ is nonabelian if and only if the homomorphism $\\alpha$ is non-trivial, which means $\\alpha_y \\neq \\text{id}_P$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the filled group condition.**\nThe condition is that every element of $G$ is reversible by an automorphism. Elements of $G$ are of the form $p$ or $py$ for $p \\in P$.\n\n**Case 1: P is an abelian group.**\nLet $A$ be an abelian group of order $q^m$. Let $G = A \\rtimes_\\alpha C_2$.\nWe investigate which choices of involutive automorphism $\\alpha_y \\in \\text{Aut}(A)$ make $G$ a filled group.\n\n*   **Subcase 1.1: The action is inversion.**\n    Let $\\alpha_y$ be the inversion automorphism, i.e., $\\alpha_y(a) = a^{-1}$ for all $a \\in A$. Since $A$ is abelian, this is an automorphism. Since $q$ is odd, $A$ has elements of order greater than 2, so this action is non-trivial. The resulting group is the generalized dihedral group over $A$, denoted $\\text{Dih}(A)$.\n    -   For an element $a \\in A$, its inverse is $a^{-1}$. The inner automorphism defined by conjugation by $y$, $\\phi_y(x) = yxy^{-1}$, maps $a$ to $\\alpha_y(a) = a^{-1}$. So every element of $A$ is reversible.\n    -   For an element $g = ay \\in G \\setminus A$, we compute its square: $g^2 = (ay)(ay) = a \\alpha_y(a) = a a^{-1} = e$. Thus, every element in the coset $Ay$ is an involution (has order 2). An involution is its own inverse, so it is reversible by the identity automorphism.\n    -   Therefore, if the action is inversion, every element of $G$ is reversible. This means any generalized dihedral group $\\text{Dih}(A)$ over an abelian $q$-group $A$ is a filled group.\n\n*   **Subcase 1.2: A is an elementary abelian group.**\n    Let $A = (C_q)^m$. We can view $A$ as a vector space $V = \\mathbb{F}_q^m$. Then $\\text{Aut}(A) \\cong GL(V) = GL_m(q)$. Let $\\alpha = \\alpha_y$ be any non-identity involution in $GL_m(q)$.\n    Let $V=E_1 \\oplus E_{-1}$ be the decomposition of $V$ into eigenspaces of $\\alpha$. Since $\\alpha \\neq I$, $E_{-1}$ is non-trivial.\n    -   For an element $v \\in V$, we need to find an automorphism $\\psi$ of $G$ that reverses it. It can be shown that for any $v \\in V$, one can construct an automorphism $\\beta \\in C_{GL(V)}(\\alpha)$ (the centralizer of $\\alpha$) that maps $v$ to $-v$. This $\\beta$ can be extended to an automorphism of $G$ that fixes $y$. Thus, all elements in $V$ are reversible.\n    -   For an element $vy \\in G \\setminus V$, it can be shown that it is also reversible by some automorphism of $G$. The proof involves finding a suitable automorphism $(\\beta, p_0)$ that reverses $vy$. This is possible for any $v \\in V$.\n    -   Therefore, for any non-identity involution $\\alpha \\in GL_m(q)$, the group $(C_q)^m \\rtimes_\\alpha C_2$ is a filled group. Note that the case $\\alpha = -I$ (the inversion map) corresponds to $\\text{Dih}((C_q)^m)$, which is covered by Subcase 1.1.\n\n**Case 2: P is a nonabelian group.**\nIf $P$ is a nonabelian $q$-group, the condition that every element of $P \\rtimes_\\alpha C_2$ is reversible by an automorphism imposes very strong constraints on both $P$ and $\\alpha$. The known classifications and examples of filled groups suggest that this case yields no solutions. The groups identified in Case 1 are believed to be the complete list.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are the semidirect products $G = P \\rtimes C_2$ where $P$ is a Sylow $q$-subgroup and the action is non-trivial, satisfying one of two conditions depending on the structure of $P$.\n\n1.  **P is an abelian group that is not elementary abelian** (i.e., its exponent is greater than $q$). The only possible action is the inversion action, where the generator of $C_2$ maps every element of $P$ to its inverse. These groups are the generalized dihedral groups $\\text{Dih}(P)$.\n\n2.  **P is the elementary abelian group of order $q^m$** (i.e., $P \\cong (C_q)^m$). The action can be defined by any non-identity involutive automorphism of $P$.\n\nThese two families of groups are disjoint based on the exponent of their Sylow $q$-subgroup.\n\nFinal Answer Summary: The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ are the semidirect products $P \\rtimes_\\alpha C_2$ where $P$ is a group of order $q^m$, $\\alpha$ is a non-trivial involutive automorphism of $P$, and one of the following holds:\n*   $P$ is a non-elementary abelian group and $\\alpha$ is the inversion automorphism ($p \\mapsto p^{-1}$).\n*   $P$ is an elementary abelian group and $\\alpha$ is any non-identity involutive automorphism.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the semidirect products $G = P \\rtimes C_2$, where $P$ is a Sylow $q$-subgroup of $G$ and the action of the non-identity element of $C_2$ on $P$ is a non-trivial automorphism $\\alpha$, satisfying one of the following two conditions:\n1.  $P$ is an abelian group that is not elementary abelian, and $\\alpha$ is the inversion automorphism ($p \\mapsto p^{-1}$ for all $p \\in P$).\n2.  $P$ is an elementary abelian group of order $q^m$ (isomorphic to $(C_q)^m$), and $\\alpha$ is any non-identity involutive automorphism of $P$.>>>"
