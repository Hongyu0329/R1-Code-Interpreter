*   **Chemical Phase**: Mixture / inhomogeneous solid solution of Potassium Chloride (KCl) and Potassium Bromide (KBr).
*   **Unit Cell Structure**: Face-Centered Cubic (FCC).
*   **Lattice Constants**: The material has a range of lattice constants, bounded by `a ≈ 6.29 Å` (for KCl) and `a ≈ 6.60 Å` (for KBr). The average lattice constant calculated from the most intense peak is `a_avg ≈ 6.50 Å`.
