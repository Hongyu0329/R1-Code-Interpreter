    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Theoretical Framework:** The question is posed within the framework of the renormalization group (RG) and specifically asks for the use of the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. This method is a cornerstone of the modern theory of critical phenomena. It allows for perturbative calculations of critical exponents near the upper critical dimension, $d_c$. The results are expressed as a power series in $\\epsilon = d_c - d$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Universality Class and Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):**\n    *   The question does not specify a particular physical model (like Ising, XY, or Heisenberg). However, the epsilon expansion is typically applied to the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\\phi^4$ theory, which describes the critical behavior of the O(N) universality class.\n    *   For this broad class of models, the upper critical dimension, above which mean-field theory becomes exact, is $d_c = 4$.\n\n3.  **Define and Calculate the Expansion Parameter $\\epsilon$:**\n    *   The epsilon expansion parameter is defined as the deviation from the upper critical dimension: $\\epsilon = d_c - d$.\n    *   The problem specifies a spatial dimension $d=3$.\n    *   Therefore, for this problem, $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n4.  **Recall or Derive the Epsilon Expansion for the Exponent $\\alpha$:**\n    *   The scaling exponent $\\alpha$ describes the singularity in the specific heat, $C \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\alpha}$.\n    *   In the RG framework, one can calculate the critical exponents as a series in $\\epsilon$. The standard one-loop (first order in $\\epsilon$) calculation for the O(N) model gives the following result for the correlation length exponent $\\nu$:\n        $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    *   The exponent $\\alpha$ is related to $\\nu$ by the hyperscaling relation: $d\\nu = 2-\\alpha$.\n    *   Substituting $d = d_c - \\epsilon = 4 - \\epsilon$ and the expression for $\\nu$:\n        $(4 - \\epsilon)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon\\right) = 2 - \\alpha$\n    *   Expanding this and keeping only terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n        $2 + \\frac{N+2}{N+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) = 2 - \\alpha$\n    *   Simplifying the expression for the coefficient of $\\epsilon$:\n        $\\left( \\frac{N+2}{N+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon = \\left( \\frac{2(N+2) - (N+8)}{2(N+8)} \\right)\\epsilon = \\frac{N-4}{2(N+8)}\\epsilon$\n    *   So, we have:\n        $\\frac{N-4}{2(N+8)}\\epsilon = -\\alpha$\n    *   This gives the general first-order formula for $\\alpha$:\n        $\\alpha = \\frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}\\epsilon$\n\n5.  **Address the Ambiguity in N and Specialize the Formula:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The formula for $\\alpha$ depends on N, the number of components of the order parameter. The question is posed generally without specifying N. In such a context, it is standard practice to assume the most fundamental and commonly studied case, which is the Ising universality class.\n    *   For the Ising model, the order parameter is a scalar, which corresponds to $N=1$.\n    *   Substituting $N=1$ into the formula:\n        $\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}\\epsilon = \\frac{3}{18}\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer for d=3:**\n    *   To find the exponent for the three-dimensional system, we substitute the value $\\epsilon=1$ into our specialized formula.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is important to remember that using $\\epsilon=1$ is an extrapolation, as the expansion is formally derived for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Nevertheless, this is the standard procedure to obtain a first-order estimate for $d=3$.\n    *   Calculation:\n        $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis value of approximately 0.167 is a first-order estimate. More sophisticated techniques (higher-order expansions with resummation, Monte Carlo simulations) yield a more accurate value for the 3D Ising model of $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$. However, the result from the first-order epsilon expansion is specifically what is requested.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n*   **System:** d=3, described by $\\phi^4$ theory.\n*   **Method:** First-order $\\epsilon$ expansion.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension:** $d_c=4$.\n*   **Expansion Parameter:** $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n*   **General Formula:** $\\alpha = \\frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}\\epsilon$.\n*   **Assumed Model:** Ising class (N=1).\n*   **Specialized Formula:** $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon$.\n*   **Final Result:** Substitute $\\epsilon=1$ to get $\\alpha = 1/6$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
