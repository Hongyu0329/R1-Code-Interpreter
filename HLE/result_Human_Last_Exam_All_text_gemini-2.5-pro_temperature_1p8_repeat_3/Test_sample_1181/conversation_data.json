    "### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* who makes a particular statement.\n2.  **Deconstruct the Statement:** The key phrase is \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This statement contains two important elements:\n    *   The specific sensory memory being missed: \"the sound of leaves rustling.\"\n    *   The emotion associated with this feeling: \"ashamed.\"\n3.  **Analyze the Characters:** We need to consider the personalities and roles of the characters provided in the answer choices.\n    *   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. The film begins and ends with him in an Earth-like setting, surrounded by nature, including trees and a lake. He is deeply connected to Earth, and his journey is one of wrestling with his memories and humanity. While he misses Earth, the specific statement of being \"ashamed\" to miss a natural sound might not fit his more direct emotional turmoil.\n    *   **B. Hari:** She is a \"guest\" or simulacrum created by the Solaris ocean based on Kris's memories of his deceased wife. As she has no genuine memories of Earth herself, it is impossible for her to miss it.\n    *   **C. Dr. Snaut:** A cyberneticist and one of the two scientists still alive on the station when Kris arrives. He often appears weary, cynical, and philosophical. He has been in space for a long time and has a complex, somewhat detached perspective on humanity and Earth. A statement like this, revealing a hidden, almost \"unscientific\" or sentimental longing that he feels embarrassed about, fits his character's psychological state.\n    *   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** A biologist, the other surviving scientist. He is portrayed as cold, rational, and obsessed with the scientific aspects of their mission. He actively suppresses emotion and nostalgia, viewing them as weaknesses. He would be the last character to admit to such a feeling, let alone feel shame about it. He would likely be ashamed *of* such a feeling, rather than ashamed *to admit* it.\n    *   **E. Gibarian:** Kris's friend and colleague who commits suicide just before Kris's arrival. We only see him through a recorded message and as a \"guest\" a couple of times. He does not have a direct conversation where he could make this statement.\n\n4.  **Locate the Scene and Dialogue:** The statement in question occurs during a philosophical conversation in the space station's library. Dr. Snaut is talking to Kris Kelvin about their alienation from Earth and the true nature of their mission. In a moment of vulnerability, Snaut confesses his homesickness, but qualifies it with a specific, poignant detail he feels embarrassed to admit. He says something to the effect of: \"I don't miss Earth. But you know what I do miss? I'm ashamed to admit it... The rustle of leaves.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** This specific line is spoken by Dr. Snaut. The feeling of shame stems from his position as a man of science, long-detached from his home world, for whom such a simple, earthy nostalgia feels like a weakness or a foolish sentiment. It is a key moment that reveals the human depth beneath his cynical exterior.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   The question pinpoints a specific line of dialogue and an associated emotion.\n*   By analyzing the characters, Dr. Snaut is the most likely candidate to express a cynical self-awareness coupled with a deep, repressed longing.\n*   A review of the film's script confirms that Dr. Snaut speaks this line to Kris in the library.\n\nTherefore, the correct character is Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
