    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to find the lowest temperature from the given options at which Xenon tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$) can be produced efficiently. The keyword here is \"efficiently,\" which implies a reasonable reaction rate and good yield, not just the mere possibility of formation.\n\n2.  **Recall the Synthesis of Xenon Tetrafluoride:** The most common and direct method for producing $XeF_4$ is the direct reaction between xenon (Xe) gas and fluorine ($F_2$) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\n    $Xe(g) + 2F_2(g) \\rightarrow XeF_4(s)$\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Activation Energy:** This reaction, like most, has an activation energy barrier that must be overcome for the reaction to proceed at a significant rate. This means a certain amount of energy, typically in the form of heat, is required.\n    *   **Product Selectivity:** The reaction between xenon and fluorine can produce different xenon fluorides ($XeF_2$, $XeF_4$, $XeF_6$) depending on the conditions (temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of reactants).\n    *   **Temperature's Role:**\n        *   If the temperature is too low, the reaction rate will be impractically slow, making the process inefficient.\n        *   If the temperature is too high, it can favor the formation of the more highly fluorinated compound, Xenon hexafluoride ($XeF_6$), especially with an excess of fluorine. The reaction is $Xe(g) + 3F_2(g) \\rightarrow XeF_6(g)$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Standard Literature Procedures:** We need to consider the established, tested methods for synthesizing $XeF_4$ efficiently.\n    *   The synthesis of $XeF_2$ is typically done by reacting Xe and $F_2$ (with excess Xe) using sunlight or heating to about 400 °C.\n    *   The synthesis of $XeF_4$ is reliably and efficiently carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio in a sealed nickel vessel to **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds at a good pace to give a high yield of $XeF_4$.\n    *   The synthesis of $XeF_6$ requires more forcing conditions, such as higher temperatures (e.g., above 500 °C) or higher pressures (e.g., >50 atmospheres at 300 °C).\n\n5.  **Assess the Answer Choices Based on the Analysis:**\n    *   **A. 600 C:** This temperature is generally too high for the efficient production of $XeF_4$. It would favor the formation of $XeF_6$.\n    *   **B. 400 C:** This is the most commonly cited temperature in chemical literature for the efficient, high-yield synthesis of $XeF_4$ from its elements. It provides enough energy to overcome the activation barrier for a good rate but is not so high that it predominantly forms $XeF_6$.\n    *   **C. 200 C:** At this temperature, the thermal reaction rate would be very low, making the process inefficient in terms of time and yield.\n    *   **D. 78 C, E. 0 C, F. -78 C:** These temperatures are far too low to provide the necessary activation energy for an efficient thermal reaction. While photochemical synthesis (using UV light) can sometimes be performed at lower temperatures, the standard thermal method is considered the benchmark for \"efficient\" bulk production, and these temperatures are too low for that.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the balance between achieving a practical reaction rate and avoiding the formation of unwanted byproducts like $XeF_6$, 400 °C is the established and optimal temperature. Among the choices given, it represents the coldest temperature at which the synthesis is still considered efficient.\n\n<<<B>>>"
