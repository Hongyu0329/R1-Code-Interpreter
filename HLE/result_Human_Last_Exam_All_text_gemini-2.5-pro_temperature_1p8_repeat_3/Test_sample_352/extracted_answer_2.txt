The best replacement would be to mutate all four amino acids—Serine (S) at 47, Glutamate (E) at 48, Glutamate (E) at 49, and Aspartate (D) at 50—to Alanine (A). This would change the SEED sequence to AAAA. This strategy effectively and completely removes the negative charge by replacing the acidic amino acids with a neutral one and eliminates the potential for phosphorylation at position 47.
