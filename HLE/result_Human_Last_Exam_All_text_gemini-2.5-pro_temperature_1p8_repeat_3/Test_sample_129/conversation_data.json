    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 symbols from {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\nThe precedence of operators is `!` > `&` > `|`. Parentheses `()` can be used to override precedence. We need to find all unique valid expression strings of length 5 that evaluate to True.\n\nLet's categorize the expressions by their top-level structure. An expression string is a sequence of 5 symbols.\n\n### Category 1: Parenthesized Expressions of the form `(A)`\nFor an expression `(A)` to have a length of 5, the inner expression `A` must have a length of 3. We need to find all valid expressions of length 3, evaluate them, and if `A` evaluates to True, then `(A)` is a true expression we are looking for.\n\nValid expressions `A` of length 3:\n1.  **`X op Y`**: where `X, Y` are `T` or `F`, and `op` is `&` or `|`. (8 combinations)\n    *   `T & T` → True.  ⇒ `(T&T)` is a solution.\n    *   `T & F` → False.\n    *   `F & T` → False.\n    *   `F & F` → False.\n    *   `T | T` → True.  ⇒ `(T|T)` is a solution.\n    *   `T | F` → True.  ⇒ `(T|F)` is a solution.\n    *   `F | T` → True.  ⇒ `(F|T)` is a solution.\n    *   `F | F` → False.\n    (4 true expressions)\n\n2.  **`!!X`**: where `X` is `T` or `F`. (2 combinations)\n    *   `!!T` → True. ⇒ `(!!T)` is a solution.\n    *   `!!F` → False.\n    (1 true expression)\n\n3.  **`(X)`**: where `X` is `T` or `F`. (2 combinations)\n    *   `(T)` → True. ⇒ `((T))` is a solution.\n    *   `(F)` → False.\n    (1 true expression)\n\nNote: `!(X)` e.g., `!(T)`, consists of 4 symbols `!,(,T,)`, so it's not a length-3 expression.\n\n**Total for Category 1: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n### Category 2: Expressions with `&` or `|` as the root operator\nThese are expressions that are not fully enclosed in parentheses. Their structure is `A op B`. We will consider structures with 3 operands and 2 operators first, as they naturally have length 5.\n\n1.  **`X op1 Y op2 Z`**: This represents expressions like `T&F|T`. (8 combinations for each pair of operators).\n    *   **`op1=&`, `op2=|`**: `(X&Y)|Z` (due to precedence).\n        *   `T&T|T`(T), `T&T|F`(T), `T&F|T`(T), `F&T|T`(T), `F&F|T`(T). (5 true)\n    *   **`op1=|`, `op2=&`**: `X|(Y&Z)` (due to precedence).\n        *   `T|T&T`(T), `T|T&F`(T), `T|F&T`(T), `T|F&F`(T), `F|T&T`(T). (5 true)\n    *   **`op1=&`, `op2=&`**: `(X&Y)&Z` (left-associative).\n        *   `T&T&T`(T). (1 true)\n    *   **`op1=|`, `op2=|`**: `(X|Y)|Z` (left-associative).\n        *   True if at least one operand is `T`. Only `F|F|F` is False. (7 true)\n    **Subtotal: 5 + 5 + 1 + 7 = 18**\n\n2.  **Other `A op B` forms**: These are compositions where `A` and/or `B` are not single letters. Total length must be `len(A) + len(B) + 1 = 5`, so `len(A) + len(B) = 4`.\n    *   **`len=3, len=1`**: Forms `A op X`.\n        *   `!!Y op X`: 4 true expressions (`!!T&T`, `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`).\n        *   `(Y) op X`: 4 true expressions (`(T)&T`, `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`).\n    *   **`len=1, len=3`**: Forms `X op B`. Symmetric to above.\n        *   `X op !!Y`: 4 true expressions (`T&!!T`, `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`).\n        *   `X op (Y)`: 4 true expressions (`T&(T)`, `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`).\n    *   **`len=2, len=2`**: Forms `A op B` where `A=!X`, `B=!Y`.\n        *   `!X op !Y`: 4 true expressions (`!T|!F`, `!F&!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`).\n    Note: Structures like `X op !(Y)` are invalid because `!(Y)` has length 4, making the total expression length 6.\n    **Subtotal: (4+4) + (4+4) + 4 = 20**\n\n**Total for Category 2: 18 + 20 = 38**\n\n### Category 3: Expressions with `!` as the root operator\nThese are expressions of the form `!A` that are not fully enclosed in parentheses. The length must be 5, so `len(A)=4` or `len(A)<4` but parens are used making the total length 5.\n\n1.  **`!!!!X`**: `!(!(!(!X)))`. This has length 5.\n    *   `!!!!T` → `!!!F` → `!!T` → `!F` → True. (1 true expression)\n\n2.  **`! ( A )`**: where A has length 2. The only valid expressions of length 2 are `!T` and `!F`.\n    *   `!(!T)`: string `!, (, !, T, )`. Length 5. Evaluates to `!(False)` → True. (1 true expression)\n    *   `!(!F)`: string `!, (, !, F, )`. Length 5. Evaluates to `!(True)` → False.\n\nOther structures like `!(!T&F)` require additional parentheses, making the length greater than 5.\n\n**Total for Category 3: 1 + 1 = 2**\n\n### Final Count\n\nSumming the counts from all disjoint categories:\n*   Category 1: 6\n*   Category 2: 38\n*   Category 3: 2\n\nTotal True Expressions = 6 + 38 + 2 = 46.\n\n<<<46>>>"
