    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the letter formed by the two high school buildings.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the schools and their location.**\nThe question names two specific high schools in Pisa:\n*   Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\n*   Istituto Ulisse Dini\nThe question also states they are located next to each other. A quick search on a map service like Google Maps confirms their addresses are on the same street, Via Benedetto Croce, and their campuses are adjacent.\n\n**Step 2: Obtain an aerial view.**\nTo answer the question, we need to look at the buildings from above. Using the satellite view function on a map service provides the necessary perspective.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the building footprints.**\nWhen viewing the two school complexes from above, we need to observe the shape their main buildings form together.\n*   The **Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\"** building consists of a long block parallel to the street and other perpendicular wings. This forms the northern part of the shape.\n*   The **Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti** building is a separate, large complex located to the south of the Dini school. It also has a long block that runs roughly parallel to the main block of the Dini building.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the shapes to identify the letter.**\nBy looking at the two buildings as a single entity, a clear letter emerges:\n*   The long, parallel main buildings of the two schools form the two vertical strokes of a letter.\n*   A shorter wing or connecting structure between the two main buildings forms the horizontal crossbar.\n*   This arrangement distinctly forms the shape of the capital letter **H**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to look at both school buildings *together*, not individually.\n*   The orientation of the \"letter\" might be slightly slanted depending on the map's alignment, but the topology of the shape is what matters.\n*   The individual buildings have complex shapes, but their main, largest sections create the overall letter form.\n\nBased on this analysis, the combined footprint of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini high schools forms the letter H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
