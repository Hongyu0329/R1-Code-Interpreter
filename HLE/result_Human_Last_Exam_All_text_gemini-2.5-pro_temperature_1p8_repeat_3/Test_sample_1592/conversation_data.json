    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\nFirst, we need to pinpoint the exact location of Waskaganish. Waskaganish is a Cree community in Quebec, Canada. It is situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate geographical coordinates are 51.19° N latitude and 78.76° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nThe provinces and territories that border Quebec are:\n*   **Ontario** to the west and southwest.\n*   **Nunavut** to the north (including all the islands in James Bay and Hudson Bay).\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador** to the east.\n*   **New Brunswick** to the southeast.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Proximity to Each Neighbor**\nWe must evaluate the distance from Waskaganish to the border of each of these neighbors.\n\n*   **Ontario:** The Quebec-Ontario border runs north-south, starting in James Bay and continuing south. Waskaganish is located very close to this border. The land border to the southwest of Waskaganish is only a short distance away. Similarly, the waters of James Bay to the west of Waskaganish belong to Ontario.\n\n*   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands within James Bay. The closest significant island is Akimiski Island, which lies to the northwest of Waskaganish. Other smaller islands, like the Twin Islands, are also part of Nunavut and are located in James Bay.\n\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador & New Brunswick:** These provinces are located on the eastern and southeastern side of Quebec. Waskaganish is on the far western side of Quebec, making the distance to these provinces very large. They can be eliminated as contenders.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Distances to Ontario and Nunavut**\nThe final step is to compare the distance from Waskaganish to the Ontario border versus the distance to the nearest islands of Nunavut.\n\n*   **Distance to Ontario:** By examining a map, the land border between Quebec and Ontario is a straight line running south along the 79°31′ W meridian. Waskaganish is at 78°46′ W. The straight-line distance to this border is very small, estimated to be approximately 55-65 kilometers to the southwest.\n\n*   **Distance to Nunavut:** The closest part of Nunavut is one of the islands in James Bay. The southern coast of Akimiski Island, for example, is over 140 kilometers to the northwest of Waskaganish. The smaller Twin Islands are also further away than the Ontario border.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the geographical analysis, the provincial border of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than any part of the territory of Nunavut or any other province.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Exact Location:** Knowing that Waskaganish is on the southeastern shore of James Bay is critical, rather than just knowing it's \"in Quebec\".\n2.  **Territorial Boundaries in Water:** It is important to know that all islands in James Bay are part of Nunavut, while the water and the mainland coast are divided between Quebec and Ontario.\n3.  **Closest Point vs. Major City:** The question asks for the closest province or territory, which refers to the distance to its border, not necessarily to the nearest town or city (like Moosonee, ON).\n4.  **Visual Map Confirmation:** Using a map provides a clear visual confirmation. It's immediately apparent that Waskaganish lies very close to the \"corner\" where Quebec and Ontario meet at the southern end of James Bay.\n\nAfter this step-by-step analysis, the final answer is clear.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
