    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to find the tallest *historical* mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad*, excluding Mount Olympus, which is established as the tallest.\n\n2.  **List the Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad*:** We must systematically identify all real-world mountains that are named or clearly referenced in the epic poem.\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** Explicitly stated as the home of the gods and the primary mountain of the epic. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n    *   **Mount Ida:** Refers to the mountain near Troy (modern-day Kaz Dağı in Turkey), from which Zeus often observes the battle. This is a very prominent mountain in the narrative.\n    *   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, Hera's journey from Olympus to Lemnos is described. The text says she \"came to Athos,\" placing it directly in her path. This is a real mountain and peninsula in Greece.\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly, Greece, is mentioned as the source of the ash wood for Achilles's great spear, which was given to his father Peleus.\n    *   **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, Poseidon sits on the \"highest peak of wooded Samothrace\" (the island's main peak is Fengari) to watch the battle unfold at Troy.\n\n3.  **Find the Modern Elevations of these Historical Mountains:** To compare them, we need their real-world heights.\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 ft)\n    *   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 ft)\n    *   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** 1,774 meters (5,820 ft)\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters (5,328 ft)\n    *   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 ft)\n\n4.  **Compare the Heights to Find the Second Tallest:** Now, we rank the mountains by elevation to determine which one comes after Olympus.\n    1.  Mount Olympus (2,918 m)\n    2.  **Mount Athos (2,033 m)**\n    3.  Mount Ida (1,774 m)\n    4.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n    5.  Mount Samothrace (1,611 m)\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** By comparing the elevations of all historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, Mount Athos is clearly the tallest after Mount Olympus.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Specificity of \"The Iliad\":** The analysis is confined strictly to mountains mentioned within the text of the *Iliad*, not other Greek myths or the *Odyssey*.\n*   **Historical vs. Mythical:** All the mountains considered are real, geographical locations, satisfying the \"historical mountain\" criterion.\n*   **Which Mount Ida:** It is crucial to use the elevation for Mount Ida near Troy (Kaz Dağı), which is the one relevant to the *Iliad*, and not the taller Mount Ida on the island of Crete (2,456 m), which is not central to the *Iliad's* narrative.\n*   **Accuracy of Elevations:** Using standard, modern elevations is key to an accurate comparison.\n\nFinal analysis confirms that Mount Athos is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
