    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and the Pieces**\n\n*   The game is played on a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n*   The pieces are bishops. Bishops move and attack any number of squares diagonally. A key property is that a bishop always stays on the squares of the same color it starts on.\n*   The goal is to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops. This means no two bishops can be placed on the board such that one could capture the other.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Playing Area**\n\n*   The problem specifies that bishops can only be placed on the \"edge squares\" of the board.\n*   Edge squares are those in the first rank (row 1), the last rank (row 8), the first file (column a), and the last file (column h).\n*   Let's count the total number of edge squares:\n    *   There are 8 squares in row 1.\n    *   There are 8 squares in row 8.\n    *   Column 'a' has 8 squares, but the two corners (a1 and a8) have already been counted with the rows. This adds 6 new squares (a2 through a7).\n    *   Column 'h' also adds 6 new squares (h2 through h7).\n    *   Total edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 3: Strategize for Maximum Placement**\n\nSince bishops on white squares can never attack bishops on black squares, we can consider the two colors independently. However, a simpler and more powerful strategy is to use the ranks (rows).\n\n*   Consider placing bishops along an entire edge, for instance, the first rank (row 1).\n*   We can place 8 bishops on squares a1, b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1, and h1.\n*   All these squares are edge squares.\n*   Since they are all on the same rank, no two of these bishops attack each other. This is a valid placement of 8 bishops.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Impact of the First Placement**\n\nNow that we have 8 bishops on the first rank, we need to see which other edge squares are attacked by them. We want to place more bishops on any remaining un-attacked edge squares.\n\n*   The other edge squares are on columns 'a' and 'h', and on row 8.\n*   Let's check the columns:\n    *   The bishop on b1 attacks a2.\n    *   The bishop on c1 attacks a3. (|3-1|=|1-3| -> 2=2)\n    *   The bishop on d1 attacks a4, and so on up to g1 attacking a7.\n    *   The bishop on h1 attacks a8.\n    *   This means all edge squares on column 'a' (except a1, which is occupied) are attacked.\n    *   Symmetrically, the bishop on g1 attacks h2, f1 attacks h3, ..., b1 attacks h7, and a1 attacks h8.\n    *   This means all edge squares on column 'h' (except h1, which is occupied) are also attacked.\n\n*   Let's check the last rank (row 8):\n    *   The squares are a8, b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8, h8.\n    *   We already determined that the bishop on a1 attacks h8, and the bishop on h1 attacks a8.\n    *   Are the squares from b8 to g8 attacked? A bishop needs to move 7 steps diagonally to get from row 1 to row 8. This is only possible along the two main diagonals (a1-h8 and h1-a8). Bishops on b1, c1, etc., cannot reach row 8.\n    *   Therefore, the squares b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, and g8 are **not attacked**.\n\n**Step 5: Complete the Maximum Placement**\n\n*   We have 8 bishops on row 1.\n*   The squares b8 through g8 (6 squares) are unoccupied and not attacked. We can place bishops on all of them, and since they are on the same rank, they won't attack each other.\n*   This gives us an additional 6 bishops.\n*   Total maximum bishops placed = 8 (on row 1) + 6 (on row 8) = 14 bishops.\n\nIt is not possible to add any more. The only remaining empty edge squares are a8 and h8, both of which are attacked. This means the maximum number of bishops that can be placed is 14.\n\n**Step 6: Answer the Final Question**\n\nThe question asks: \"how many edge squares would lack bishops?\"\n\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Maximum number of bishops placed = 14.\n*   Number of squares without bishops = Total edge squares - Maximum bishops placed.\n*   Number of squares lacking bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
