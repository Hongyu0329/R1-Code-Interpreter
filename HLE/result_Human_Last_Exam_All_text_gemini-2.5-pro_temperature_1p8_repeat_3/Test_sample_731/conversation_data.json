    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup H of a group G is called a power subgroup if there exists an element g in G such that H is the cyclic subgroup generated by g (i.e., H = <g>). Therefore, the question is asking for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in the group.\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ (for $n \\ge 4$) is denoted as $SD_{2^n}$. The size of our group is 512, which can be written as $2^9$. Thus, we are dealing with the group $G = SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$, which corresponds to $n=9$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Group Structure**\n\nThe presentation of the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ is given by:\n$G = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{2^{n-1}} = e, b^2 = e, bab^{-1} = a^{-1+2^{n-2}} \\rangle$\n\nFor our specific case, $n=9$, the presentation is:\n$G = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{2^8} = e, b^2 = e, bab^{-1} = a^{-1+2^7} \\rangle$\n$G = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{256} = e, b^2 = e, bab^{-1} = a^{127} \\rangle$\n\nThe elements of this group are of the form $a^i$ or $a^i b$, where $0 \\leq i < 256$.\nThe group consists of a large cyclic subgroup $A = \\langle a \\rangle$ of order 256, and 256 other elements of the form $a^i b$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Cyclic Subgroups**\n\nWe can partition the cyclic subgroups into two disjoint sets:\n1.  Cyclic subgroups that are contained within the subgroup $A = \\langle a \\rangle$.\n2.  Cyclic subgroups that are not contained within $A$. These must be generated by elements of the form $a^i b$.\n\n**Part 1: Cyclic Subgroups within $\\langle a \\rangle$**\n\nThe subgroup $A = \\langle a \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256. A fundamental property of cyclic groups is that for a cyclic group of order $m$, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$.\nThe order of $A$ is $256 = 2^8$. The divisors of $2^8$ are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\ldots, 2^8$.\nThere are $8+1=9$ divisors.\nTherefore, there are **9** distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle a \\rangle$. These are the subgroups of orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256.\n\n**Part 2: Cyclic Subgroups not within $\\langle a \\rangle$**\n\nThese subgroups must be generated by elements of the form $g = a^i b$. We must find the order of these elements. Let's compute $g^2$:\n$g^2 = (a^i b)^2 = a^i b a^i b = a^i (b a^i b^{-1}) b^2$\nUsing the relation $ba^k b^{-1} = (bab^{-1})^k = (a^{127})^k = a^{127k}$, we have:\n$g^2 = a^i (a^{127i}) e = a^{i + 127i} = a^{128i}$.\n\nNow, we analyze the order of $g$ based on the parity of $i$:\n*   **Case 2a: $i$ is even.**\n    Let $i = 2k$, where $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 127\\}$.\n    $g^2 = a^{128(2k)} = a^{256k} = (a^{256})^k = e$.\n    So, if $i$ is even, the element $a^i b$ has order 2.\n    There are 128 even values for $i$ in the range $[0, 255]$. Each of these 128 elements of order 2 generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2 (e.g., $\\langle a^{2k}b \\rangle = \\{e, a^{2k}b\\}$). These subgroups are all distinct from each other and are not contained in $\\langle a \\rangle$.\n    This gives **128** new cyclic subgroups.\n\n*   **Case 2b: $i$ is odd.**\n    Let $i$ be an odd number.\n    $g^2 = a^{128i} = a^{128}$ (since $i$ is odd, $128i$ is an odd multiple of 128, and the order of $a$ is 256).\n    The element $a^{128}$ has order 2, since $(a^{128})^2 = a^{256} = e$.\n    As $g^2 \\neq e$, we check $g^4$:\n    $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (a^{128})^2 = e$.\n    So, if $i$ is odd, the element $a^i b$ has order 4.\n    There are 128 odd values for $i$ in the range $[0, 255]$. We need to find how many distinct subgroups these elements generate. A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators.\n    Let's find the other generator of $H = \\langle a^i b \\rangle$. It must be $g^3 = g^{-1}$.\n    $g^3 = g \\cdot g^2 = (a^i b) a^{128} = a^i(ba^{128}b^{-1})b = a^i(a^{127\\cdot128})b = a^i(a^{-128})b = a^{i-128}b$.\n    (Note: $a^{127 \\cdot 128} = a^{-128}$ since $o(a)=256$).\n    So, the two generators of $H$ are $a^i b$ and $a^{i-128}b$ (or $a^{i+128}b$ since indices are mod 256). This means $\\langle a^i b \\rangle = \\langle a^{i+128} b \\rangle$.\n    The 128 elements of order 4 are grouped into pairs, with each pair generating the same subgroup. For example, $\\langle ab \\rangle = \\langle a^{129}b \\rangle$.\n    The number of distinct subgroups is the number of elements divided by the number of generators per subgroup: $128 / 2 = 64$.\n    This gives **64** new cyclic subgroups.\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nTo find the total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups), we sum the counts from all cases:\n*   Subgroups within $\\langle a \\rangle$: 9\n*   Subgroups generated by $a^i b$ with $i$ even: 128\n*   Subgroups generated by $a^i b$ with $i$ odd: 64\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\n<<<201>>>"
