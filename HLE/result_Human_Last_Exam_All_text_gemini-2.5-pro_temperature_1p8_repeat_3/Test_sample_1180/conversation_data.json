    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve.\n\n**1. The Curve and the Valuation**\n\n*   The curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\n*   We are working with the 2-adic valuation, denoted by $v$, which is normalized such that $v(2) = 1$. The base ring is the ring of 2-adic integers, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**2. Finding a Better Model**\n\nThe initial model has a special fiber that is not reduced. Reducing the equation modulo 2 gives $z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, which is $(z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. This is a double line over the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1_x$, which is a highly singular model. To find the stable reduction, we need to find a better model of the curve.\n\nWe can perform a change of variables to simplify the equation. Let's establish an isomorphism between our curve $C$ and another curve $C'$ which is easier to analyze.\nLet $x' = 2x$ and $y' = 4z$. We can express the equation of $C$ in terms of $x'$ and $y'$:\nThe relation $y' = 4z$ gives $z = y'/4$.\nThe relation $x' = 2x$ gives $x = x'/2$.\nSubstituting these into the original equation for $C$:\n$(y'/4)^2 = 2(x'/2)^5 + 2(x'/2)^3 + 1$\n$(y')^2/16 = 2(x')^5/32 + 2(x')^3/8 + 1$\n$(y')^2/16 = (x')^5/16 + (x')^3/4 + 1$\nMultiplying the entire equation by 16, we get:\n$(y')^2 = (x')^5 + 4(x')^3 + 16$\n\nLet's call this new model $C': y^2 = x^5 + 4x^3 + 16$. This is an equation with integer coefficients, defining a model over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The transformation $(x, z) \\mapsto (2x, 4z)$ gives an isomorphism from $C$ to $C'$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, so they will have the same stable reduction and associated invariants.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Special Fiber of the New Model**\n\nNow we look at the reduction of the model $C'$ modulo 2.\n$y^2 \\equiv x^5 \\pmod 2$.\nThe special fiber of this model, let's call it $\\bar{C'}$, is the curve defined by $y^2 = x^5$ over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This curve is singular. Let's find the singular points.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^2 - x^5) = 2y \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2 - x^5) = -5x^4 \\equiv x^4 \\pmod 2$\nA point is singular if both partial derivatives are zero. This requires $x^4=0$, which implies $x=0$. If $x=0$, then the curve equation gives $y^2=0$, so $y=0$.\nThe special fiber $\\bar{C'}$ has a single singular point at the origin $(0,0)$. This type of singularity, $y^2 = x^5$, is a higher-order cusp. It is not a double point (node), so the model is not yet stable.\n\n**4. Resolving the Singularity and Identifying the \"Double Point\"**\n\nThe stable reduction is obtained by a sequence of blow-ups of the singular model until the special fiber becomes a stable curve (i.e., its only singularities are nodes). The term \"double point\" in the question refers to a node in the stable reduction. The thickness of this node is a measure of how \"singular\" the curve was at that point from an arithmetic perspective.\n\nThe singularity $y^2 = x^5$ is a well-known type of plane curve singularity. The process of resolving it involves creating a chain of exceptional divisors, which are rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$), in the special fiber of the resolved model. The stable model is formed by these components. In many contexts, the \"thickness\" of a singularity that resolves into a chain of rational curves is defined as the number of these rational curves.\n\nLet's resolve the singularity $y^2=x^5$:\n1.  **First Blow-up:** We blow up the origin $(x,y)=(0,0)$. In the chart where $y = y_1 x$, the equation $y^2=x^5$ becomes $(y_1 x)^2 = x^5$, which simplifies to $y_1^2 = x^3$. The new singularity is at the origin $(x,y_1)=(0,0)$ and is of the form $y_1^2 = x^3$. The exceptional divisor is a $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n2.  **Second Blow-up:** We blow up the new origin $(x,y_1)=(0,0)$. In the chart where $y_1 = y_2 x$, the equation $y_1^2=x^3$ becomes $(y_2 x)^2 = x^3$, which simplifies to $y_2^2 = x$. This curve is smooth. The process terminates.\n\nThe resolution of the cusp $y^2=x^5$ requires two blow-ups. This creates a chain of two exceptional rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$s). Let them be $E_1$ and $E_2$. The final special fiber consists of the strict transform of the original curve meeting the end of this chain of two $\\mathbb{P}^1$s. The configuration $E_1 \\cup E_2$ forms a component of the stable reduction. The 'node' or 'double point' can be thought of as the remnant of the original singularity, and its structure is now represented by this chain.\n\nThe thickness, in this context, corresponds to the number of exceptional curves in the minimal resolution of the singularity in the special fiber. Since we found two such curves, the thickness is 2. This integer measures the complexity of the node which appears during the reduction process.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nThe curve $z^2=2*x^5+2*x^3+1$ is isomorphic to $y^2=x^5+4x^3+16$. The special fiber of this second model is $y^2=x^5 \\pmod{2}$, which has a cusp singularity at the origin. The minimal resolution of this cusp requires two blow-ups, creating a chain of two exceptional $\\mathbb{P}^1$ components. The number of components in this chain is defined as the thickness of the singularity. Therefore, the thickness is 2."
