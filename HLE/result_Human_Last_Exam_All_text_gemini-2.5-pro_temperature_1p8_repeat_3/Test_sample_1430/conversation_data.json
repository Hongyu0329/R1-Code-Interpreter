    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Objects**\n\n*   **C:** A genus `g=3` Riemann surface. Topologically, this is a compact, orientable surface with 3 \"holes\". Algebraically, it's a smooth projective complex curve of genus 3.\n*   **X = C^(15):** The 15th symmetric power of C, denoted `Sym^15(C)`. Its points are effective divisors of degree 15 on C, which can be thought of as unordered sets of 15 points on C, allowing for repetitions. `X` is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi Group NS(X):** This is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. It is a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   **Rank of NS(X):** We are looking for the rank of this group, denoted `ρ(X)`, which is also known as the Picard number of X. This rank is the dimension of the rational vector space `NS(X) ⊗_Z Q`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi Rank of X to C and its Jacobian**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in a fundamental result concerning the Picard group (and thus the Neron-Severi group) of symmetric powers of a curve.\nLet `C` be a curve of genus `g`, and `J(C)` its Jacobian variety (a `g`-dimensional abelian variety). For the `d`-th symmetric power `Sym^d(C)`, there is a crucial relationship when `d` is large enough.\n\n*   **Theorem:** For a smooth projective curve `C` of genus `g`, if `d ≥ g`, then the Picard group `Pic(Sym^d(C))` is isomorphic to the direct sum `Pic(C) ⊕ Pic(J(C))`. Taking the ranks of the corresponding Neron-Severi groups, we get the formula:\n    `ρ(Sym^d(C)) = ρ(C) + ρ(J(C))`\n\nIn our problem:\n*   `g = 3` (genus of C)\n*   `d = 15` (symmetric power)\n\nSince `15 ≥ 3`, the condition `d ≥ g` is satisfied, and we can use this formula.\n`ρ(X) = ρ(Sym^15(C)) = ρ(C) + ρ(J(C))`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate ρ(C)**\n\nFor any smooth projective curve `C`, its Neron-Severi group `NS(C)` is isomorphic to `Z`. It is generated by the class of a single point.\n*   `ρ(C) = rank(Z) = 1`.\n\nSubstituting this into our formula, we get:\n`ρ(X) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values for `ρ(J(C))`, where `C` is any genus 3 curve.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Smallest Possible Rank of ρ(J(C))**\n\n*   `J(C)` is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety (PPAV).\n*   For any PPAV, the Neron-Severi group is at least rank 1, because the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor) is always a non-trivial algebraic class. So, `ρ(J(C)) ≥ 1`.\n*   This minimum value is achieved for a *generic* curve. A famous result states that for a generic curve `C` of genus `g`, its Jacobian `J(C)` has no endomorphisms other than the trivial ones (multiplication by integers). This means its endomorphism algebra `End(J(C)) ≅ Z`. In this case, `J(C)` has no \"extra\" algebraic cycles, and its Neron-Severi group is generated solely by the polarization class.\n*   Therefore, the smallest possible rank is `min(ρ(J(C))) = 1`.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Smallest Possible Rank of ρ(X)**\n\nUsing the result from Step 4:\n*   Smallest `ρ(X) = 1 + min(ρ(J(C))) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n**Step 6: Find the Largest Possible Rank of ρ(J(C))**\n\nThe rank `ρ(A)` of the Neron-Severi group of an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g` is bounded by its (1,1)-Hodge number, `h^(1,1)(A)`.\n*   For `J(C)`, `g = 3`.\n*   The Betti numbers of a g-dimensional complex torus are `b_k = \\binom{2g}{k}`. For `J(C)`, `b_2 = \\binom{6}{2} = 15`.\n*   The Hodge number `h^(p,q)` counts the dimension of `H^(p,q)(J(C))`. For an abelian variety, `h^(2,0)(J(C)) = \\binom{g}{2} = \\binom{3}{2} = 3`. By Hodge symmetry, `h^(0,2) = h^(2,0) = 3`.\n*   `h^(1,1)(J(C)) = b_2(J(C)) - h^(2,0)(J(C)) - h^(0,2)(J(C)) = 15 - 3 - 3 = 9`.\n*   Thus, the absolute maximum possible rank for `ρ(J(C))` is `g^2 = 3^2 = 9`.\n\nTo see if this maximum is achieved, we must find a specific genus 3 curve `C` whose Jacobian has this property. A large Neron-Severi rank corresponds to the Jacobian having many endomorphisms (Complex Multiplication or CM). The Hodge Conjecture, which is known for abelian varieties, states that `ρ(A)` equals the dimension of the space of Hodge cycles. For CM abelian varieties, this is known to be equal to `h^(1,1)(A)`.\n\n*   Consider the **Fermat quartic curve** in `P^2` given by the equation `x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0`. This is a smooth plane quartic curve, and by the genus-degree formula, its genus is `g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3`.\n*   The Jacobian of this specific curve, `J(C)`, is very special. It is known to be isogenous to the cube of a single elliptic curve `E`, where `E` is the Fermat quartic curve in `P^1` (e.g., `u^4+v^4=1`) which has CM by `Z[i]` (the Gaussian integers). So, `J(C)` is isogenous to `E x E x E`.\n*   An isogeny induces an isomorphism on Neron-Severi groups after tensoring with `Q`, so `ρ(J(C)) = ρ(E^3)`.\n*   For the product `E^3`, we can calculate its `h^(1,1)`. As shown in the calculation above, `h^(1,1)(E^3) = 9`.\n*   Since `E` is a CM elliptic curve, `E^3` is an abelian variety of CM type. For such varieties, the rank of the Neron-Severi group achieves its theoretical maximum: `ρ(E^3) = h^(1,1)(E^3) = 9`.\n*   Therefore, for the Fermat quartic curve, `ρ(J(C)) = 9`. This is the maximum possible rank.\n\n**Step 7: Find the Largest Possible Rank of ρ(X)**\n\nUsing the result from Step 6:\n*   Largest `ρ(X) = 1 + max(ρ(J(C))) = 1 + 9 = 10`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Condition on d:** The formula `ρ(Sym^d(C)) = ρ(C) + ρ(J(C))` is only valid for `d ≥ g`. In this case, `15 ≥ 3`, so it holds.\n2.  **Generic vs. Special Curves:** The rank `ρ(J(C))` depends heavily on the choice of `C`. A \"generic\" curve gives the minimal rank, while a highly \"special\" curve with symmetries and CM (like the Fermat curve) is needed to achieve the maximum.\n3.  **Hodge Conjecture for Abelian Varieties:** We used the fact that for an abelian variety `A`, `ρ(A) ≤ h^(1,1)(A)`, and that for CM abelian varieties, equality holds. This is a non-trivial fact.\n4.  **Isogeny Invariance:** The rank of the Neron-Severi group is an isogeny invariant for abelian varieties. This allowed us to compute the rank for `E^3` instead of the more complicated `J(C)` directly.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   The smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is `1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   The largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is `1 + 9 = 10`.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
