    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma to find the equilibrium point.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Classical Game\nFirst, let's identify the equilibrium in the classical version of the game. The payoff matrix is:\n```\n          Player 2\n        Cooperate(C)  Defect(D)\n P1  C    (5, 5)        (0, 7)\n     D    (7, 0)        (1, 1)\n```\n-   **Player 1's perspective**:\n    -   If Player 2 Cooperates, Player 1 gets 5 for Cooperating and 7 for Defecting. Player 1 should Defect.\n    -   If Player 2 Defects, Player 1 gets 0 for Cooperating and 1 for Defecting. Player 1 should Defect.\n    -   Defect (D) is the dominant strategy for Player 1.\n-   **Player 2's perspective**: By symmetry, Defect (D) is also the dominant strategy for Player 2.\n-   **Classical Nash Equilibrium**: The unique Nash Equilibrium is (Defect, Defect), resulting in a payoff of (1, 1). This is the \"dilemma,\" because if both players had cooperated, they would have achieved a better outcome of (5, 5).\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Quantum Game\nWe use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol for quantum games.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The problem states we should design an optimal initial state. To resolve the dilemma, we need to introduce quantum entanglement. The optimal choice is a maximally entangled state. The game starts with the initial state `|CC>` (represented as `|00>`), and an entangling operator `J` is applied.\n    `|\\psi_in> = J|00>`\n    For maximal entanglement, `J = (1/√2)(I ⊗ I + i σ_x ⊗ σ_x)`.\n    This results in the initial state `|\\psi_in> = (1/√2)(|00> + i|11>)`, which is a maximally entangled Bell state.\n\n2.  **Player Strategies**: Players' strategies are unitary transformations on their respective qubits. The classical strategies are:\n    -   **Cooperate (C)**: The identity operator `I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.\n    -   **Defect (D)**: The Pauli-X (bit-flip) operator `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`.\n\n    In the quantum realm, a new set of strategies is available. A key quantum strategy, often denoted as `Q`, is:\n    -   **Quantum (Q)**: The Pauli-Z operator with a phase, `Q = iσ_z = [[i, 0], [0, -i]]`.\n\n3.  **Payoff Calculation**: Players Alice (P1) and Bob (P2) apply their strategies `U_A` and `U_B`. A disentangling operator `J†` is then applied. The final state is:\n    `|\\psi_f> = J† (U_A ⊗ U_B) J |00>`\n    The final state is measured in the classical basis `{|00>, |01>, |10>, |11>}` (or `{CC, CD, DC, DD}`). The probabilities of these outcomes determine the expected payoff.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Game with Quantum Strategies\nWe now calculate the payoffs for a game where players can choose from the set of strategies `{C, D, Q}`.\n\n1.  **If both players play Q (Profile: (Q, Q))**:\n    -   `|\\psi_f> = J† (Q ⊗ Q) J |00> = |00>`\n    -   The outcome is certain to be `|00>` (Cooperate, Cooperate).\n    -   **Payoff: (5, 5)**.\n\n2.  **If Alice plays Q and Bob plays C (Profile: (Q, C))**:\n    -   `|\\psi_f> = J† (Q ⊗ C) J |00> = |11>`\n    -   The outcome is certain to be `|11>` (Defect, Defect).\n    -   **Payoff: (1, 1)**.\n\n3.  **If Alice plays Q and Bob plays D (Profile: (Q, D))**:\n    -   `|\\psi_f> = J† (Q ⊗ D) J |00> = |10>`\n    -   The outcome is certain to be `|10>` (Defect, Cooperate).\n    -   **Payoff: (7, 0)**.\n\nBy symmetry, we can fill out the complete payoff matrix for the extended game:\n\n**Alice's Payoffs**\n(Alice's strategy in rows, Bob's in columns)\n```\n        C     D     Q\n   C    5     0     1\n   D    7     1     0\n   Q    1     7     5\n```\n**Bob's Payoffs**\n(Alice's strategy in rows, Bob's in columns)\n```\n        C     D     Q\n   C    5     7     1\n   D    0     1     7\n   Q    1     0     5\n```\n\n### Step 4: Find the Quantum Nash Equilibrium\nNow we look for a strategy profile where neither player has an incentive to change their strategy unilaterally.\n\n1.  **Is (D, D) an equilibrium?** The payoff is (1, 1). If Alice unilaterally switches from D to Q (while Bob keeps playing D), the profile becomes (Q, D) and Alice's payoff changes from 1 to 7. Since she can improve her payoff, she has an incentive to switch. Thus, **(D, D) is not a Nash Equilibrium** in the quantum game.\n\n2.  **Is (Q, Q) an equilibrium?** The payoff is (5, 5).\n    -   Consider Alice's perspective (assuming Bob plays Q). If she switches from Q to C, her payoff changes from 5 to 1. She won't switch. If she switches from Q to D, her payoff changes from 5 to 0. She won't switch.\n    -   By symmetry, Bob has no incentive to unilaterally switch from Q either.\n    -   Therefore, **(Q, Q) is a Nash Equilibrium**.\n\nThe quantum strategy profile (Q, Q) is a stable equilibrium point. This equilibrium yields the payoff (5, 5), which is the Pareto optimal outcome that was unstable in the classical game. The dilemma is resolved.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe equilibrium point is the stable strategy profile and its corresponding payoff. In this quantum prisoner's dilemma, the unique pure-strategy Nash Equilibrium is the strategy profile where both players choose the quantum strategy `Q`. This equilibrium leads to a payoff of (5, 5).\n\n<<(5, 5)>>>"
