    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe given differential equation is $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$.\nAn equilibrium point is a value of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$$\n-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n$$\n\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$\n-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\n\nThe quadratic term inside the parenthesis is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$\n-x(x-1)^2 = 0\n$$\n\nThe solutions to this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the two equilibrium points of the system.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can use the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at that point.\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point $x^*$ is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we need to use another method, such as a phase line diagram.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$\nf(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x\n$$\n$$\nf'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1\n$$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$**:\n    We evaluate $f'(0)$:\n    $$\n    f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1\n    $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$**:\n    We evaluate $f'(1)$:\n    $$\n    f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0\n    $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method to analyze the stability of $x = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Phase Line Analysis for $x=1$**\n\nWe will analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the vicinity of $x=1$.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$)**:\n    $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9 - 1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009 < 0$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, which means the solution $x(t)$ decreases and moves away from $x=1$.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$)**:\n    $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1 - 1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -1.1(0.01) = -0.011 < 0$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, which means the solution $x(t)$ decreases and moves towards $x=1$.\n\nFor an equilibrium point to be stable, solutions on both sides of the point must move towards it. In this case, for $x < 1$, the solutions move away from $x=1$. Therefore, the equilibrium point $x = 1$ is not stable. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium point.\n\n**Step 4: Find the value of $m$**\n\nThe problem defines $m$ as the number of **stable** equilibrium points. Based on our analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x = 0$.\nThus, $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression**\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m = 1$:\n$$\nm - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
