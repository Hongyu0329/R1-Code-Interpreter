    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Problem:** We are asked to find the number of distinct $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. \"Distinct\" here means up to conjugacy by the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Classification Theorem:** The theory of reductive algebraic groups provides a powerful classification result for this problem. Let $G$ be a connected reductive group defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $F$ be the corresponding Frobenius endomorphism. The set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is in a one-to-one correspondence with the set of so-called *$F$-conjugacy classes* of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\n3.  **Define F-Conjugacy:** An $F$-conjugacy class in the Weyl group $W$ is a set of the form:\n    $$[w]_F = \\{ g^{-1} w F(g) \\mid g \\in W \\} $$\n    for some element $w \\in W$. Our task is to count the number of such distinct classes.\n\n4.  **Determine the Action of the Frobenius Endomorphism F on the Weyl Group W:**\n    *   A fundamental result by Lang states that any connected algebraic group defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is *quasi-split*. A quasi-split group contains a Borel subgroup defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    *   For a quasi-split group, the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ is induced by the action of the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q / \\mathbb{F}_q)$ on the Dynkin diagram of the group.\n    *   The group $G$ is of type $E_8$. The Dynkin diagram for $E_8$ is known to have a trivial automorphism group.\n    *   Because the automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram is trivial, the Frobenius endomorphism must act trivially on the simple reflections generating the Weyl group, and therefore acts trivially on the entire Weyl group $W = W(E_8)$. This means $F(g) = g$ for all $g \\in W$.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Problem:** Since the action of $F$ is trivial, the definition of an $F$-conjugacy class simplifies significantly:\n    $$[w]_F = \\{ g^{-1} w F(g) \\mid g \\in W \\} = \\{ g^{-1} w g \\mid g \\in W \\}$$\n    This is precisely the definition of an *ordinary conjugacy class* of the element $w$ in the group $W$.\n\n6.  **Re-state the Conclusion:** The number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Conjugacy Classes of W(E8):** The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a finite Coxeter group of order $696,729,600$. The number of its conjugacy classes is a well-established result in mathematics, determined through character theory and combinatorial methods. The number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is **112**.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Tori over $\\mathbb{F}_q$:** We are counting tori that are defined over the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, not just over its algebraic closure $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$.\n*   **Conjugacy:** The classification is up to conjugacy by the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n*   **Lang's Theorem:** The fact that any reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is quasi-split is a critical and non-trivial step. It allows us to understand the action of the Frobenius.\n*   **Action of Frobenius:** The action of $F$ on the Weyl group is key. It's essential to correctly identify this action based on the group's type. For $E_8$, this action is trivial due to the symmetry of its Dynkin diagram. For other groups (like $A_n$ or $D_4$), the action can be non-trivial, leading to a different calculation.\n*   **$F$-conjugacy vs. Ordinary Conjugacy:** It is crucial to distinguish between these two concepts and to correctly identify when they coincide.\n*   **Final Number:** The final step relies on a known mathematical fact (the number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$). This value is standard and can be found in reference texts on Coxeter groups and Lie theory (e.g., R.W. Carter's \"Conjugacy classes in the Weyl group\").\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer is the number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$.\n\n<<<112>>>"
