    "This problem requires finding the steady-state probabilities of a continuous-time Markov chain and then calculating the sum of two of these probabilities.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\nThe given set of differential equations is a Kolmogorov forward system, describing the evolution of probabilities $P_i(t)$ for a system to be in one of four states {0, 1, 2, 3}.\nThe goal is to find the value of $P_0(t) + P_1(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. These are the steady-state probabilities, which we denote as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\nAt steady state (as $t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities become constant, so their time derivatives are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$. The system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n**3. Check and Correct the Equations**\nLet's review the given equations. A fundamental property of a Kolmogorov system for probabilities is that the sum of probabilities is constant (and equal to 1): $P_0(t) + P_1(t) + P_2(t) + P_3(t) = 1$. Differentiating this with respect to time implies that the sum of the derivatives must be zero: $P_0'(t) + P_1'(t) + P_2'(t) + P_3'(t) = 0$.\n\nLet's sum the right-hand sides of the given equations:\n- From $P_0'': -\\lambda_{01}P_0(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_1(t)$\n- From $P_1'': -\\lambda_{01}P_0(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_1(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_2(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_3(t)$\n- From $P_2'': \\lambda_{12}P_1(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_2(t)$\n- From $P_3'': \\lambda_{23}P_2(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_3(t)$\n\nSumming the coefficients for each $P_i(t)$:\n- For $P_0(t)$: $-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01} = -2\\lambda_{01}$\n- For $P_1(t)$: $\\lambda_{10} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12}) + \\lambda_{12} = 0$\n- For $P_2(t)$: $\\lambda_{21} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}) + \\lambda_{23} = 0$\n- For $P_3(t)$: $\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31} = 0$\n\nThe sum of the derivatives is $-2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$, which is not zero. This indicates a typo in the problem statement. For the conservation of probability to hold, the flow from state 0 to state 1 must be represented by a positive term in the equation for $P_1'(t)$. The term $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ in the second equation should be $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$.\n\nThe corrected (and standard) system is:\n$P_0'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_0(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_1(t)$\n$P_1'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_0(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_1(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_2(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_3(t)$\n$P_2'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_1(t) - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_2(t)$\n$P_3'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_2(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_3(t)$\n$P_0(t) + P_1(t) + P_2(t) + P_3(t) = 1$\n\n**4. Set up and Solve the Linear System for Steady-State Probabilities ($\\pi_i$)**\nSetting the derivatives to zero, we get the steady-state equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n2.  (This equation is now linearly dependent on the others and can be ignored if we use 1, 3, and 4)\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n5.  $1 = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3$ (Normalization condition)\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0 = 0.008 \\pi_2 - 0.008 \\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_3 = \\pi_2$.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0 = 0.4 \\pi_1 - (0.392 + 0.008)\\pi_2 = 0.4 \\pi_1 - 0.4 \\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_1$.\nCombining these, we get $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0 = -0.019 \\pi_0 + 0.65 \\pi_1 \\implies 0.019 \\pi_0 = 0.65 \\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1$.\n\n**5. Use the Normalization Condition**\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$ into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019})\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3)\\pi_1 = 1$\nTo find $\\pi_1$, we simplify the expression in the parenthesis:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 = \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} = \\frac{0.707}{0.019}$.\nSo, $\\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\pi_1 = 1 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Desired Quantity**\nWe need to find $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\nWe know $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1$.\nSo, $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1\\right)\\pi_1$.\nSimplify the term in the parenthesis:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.019} = \\frac{0.669}{0.019}$.\nNow substitute the value of $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.669}{0.019}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.019}{0.707}\\right) = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to four decimal places, we get 0.9463."
