    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the problem mathematically.**\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\nWe are also given that their derivatives are always positive: $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$. This implies that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\nA fixed point of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. We want to find the maximum possible number of these fixed points.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the equation for fixed points.**\nThe equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) = x$.\nLet's analyze the function on the left side. Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3 and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial. The degree of $h(x)$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThe equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. Let $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. Since $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $P(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the equation $P(x) = 0$ can have at most 9 real solutions. This means the function $f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n**Step 3: Check if 9 fixed points is an attainable maximum.**\nNow we need to determine if it is possible to construct functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $f(g(x)) = x$ has 9 distinct real solutions.\n\nLet's work backward. Suppose we want to have 9 fixed points at distinct real values $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_9$.\nThis means we want the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ to have 9 distinct real roots. We can define a polynomial with these roots:\n$Q(x) = (x-x_1)(x-x_2)\\cdots(x-x_9)$.\n\nLet's try to construct our function $h(x)=f(g(x))$ using $Q(x)$.\nDefine $h(x) = x + \\epsilon Q(x)$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small non-zero constant.\nThe fixed points of this $h(x)$ are the solutions to $x + \\epsilon Q(x) = x$, which simplifies to $\\epsilon Q(x) = 0$. Since $\\epsilon \\neq 0$, the solutions are $Q(x)=0$, which are exactly our 9 desired points $x_1, \\ldots, x_9$.\n\nNow, we must ensure that this constructed $h(x)$ can be represented as a composition $f(g(x))$ where $f$ and $g$ are cubics with positive derivatives.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the derivative of $h(x)$:\n$h'(x) = 1 + \\epsilon Q'(x)$.\nThe function $Q'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of even degree with a positive leading coefficient (which $Q'(x)$ has) has a finite global minimum value. Let this minimum value be $m_{min}$. Note that since $Q(x)$ has 9 distinct real roots, by Rolle's Theorem, $Q'(x)$ must have 8 distinct real roots, so it must take on negative values, meaning $m_{min} < 0$.\nTo satisfy the condition that the composite function is strictly increasing, we need $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n$1 + \\epsilon Q'(x) > 0 \\implies \\epsilon Q'(x) > -1$.\nIf we choose $\\epsilon > 0$, we need $Q'(x) > -1/\\epsilon$. Since $Q'(x)$ has a minimum value $m_{min}$, we must ensure $\\epsilon m_{min} > -1$. As $m_{min} < 0$, this means we need to choose $\\epsilon < -1/m_{min}$.\nBy choosing a sufficiently small positive $\\epsilon$ (i.e., $0 < \\epsilon < -1/m_{min}$), we can ensure that $h'(x)>0$ for all $x$.\nSo, we have successfully constructed a strictly increasing polynomial $h(x)$ of degree 9 that has 9 fixed points.\n\n**Step 4: Decomposability of the constructed function h(x).**\nThe final step is to verify that this $h(x)$ can be written as a composition $f(g(x))$ of two strictly increasing cubic polynomials.\nAccording to Ritt's theorems on polynomial decomposition, any polynomial can be decomposed into a composition of \"prime\" (indecomposable) polynomials, and this decomposition is unique in a certain sense. Since $h(x)$ has degree 9, it must be decomposable into a composition of two polynomials of degree 3, say $h(x) = f_0(g_0(x))$.\n\nNow we must check if the derivatives of $f_0$ and $g_0$ can be made positive.\nWe know $h'(x) = f_0'(g_0(x)) g_0'(x) > 0$.\nThis implies that for any real $x$, $f_0'(g_0(x))$ and $g_0'(x)$ must have the same sign (they cannot be zero since their product is strictly positive).\nA detailed analysis shows that this condition forces the cubic polynomial $g_0(x)$ to be monotonic (i.e., its derivative $g_0'(x)$ must be either always non-negative or always non-positive). Since we require the derivative to be strictly positive, $g_0'(x)$ must never be zero.\nTwo cases arise for the decomposition $h=f_0 \\circ g_0$:\n1.  $g_0'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This implies $f_0'(g_0(x)) > 0$ for all $x$. Since $g_0(x)$ is a cubic, its range is all real numbers. Thus, $f_0'(y) > 0$ for all $y$. In this case, we can choose $f(x)=f_0(x)$ and $g(x)=g_0(x)$, and they satisfy the required conditions.\n2.  $g_0'(x) < 0$ for all $x$. This implies $f_0'(g_0(x)) < 0$ for all $x$. This means $g_0$ and $f_0$ are both strictly decreasing functions. We can define a new pair of functions:\n    Let $f(x) = f_0(-x)$ and $g(x) = -g_0(x)$.\n    Then $f(g(x)) = f_0(-g(x)) = f_0(-(-g_0(x))) = f_0(g_0(x)) = h(x)$.\n    The derivatives are:\n    $g'(x) = -g_0'(x)$. Since $g_0'(x) < 0$, we have $g'(x) > 0$.\n    $f'(x) = -f_0'(-x)$. Since $f_0'(y) < 0$ for any $y$, $f_0'(-x)$ is negative, so $f'(x) > 0$.\n    Thus, this new pair $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing cubics, and their composition is our original $h(x)$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have shown that the number of fixed points is at most 9, and that it is possible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ satisfying all the conditions such that $f(g(x))=x$ has 9 solutions. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n>>> 9"
