    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Curve and Self-Intersections**\n\nThe curve is a Lissajous curve. A self-intersection point occurs when the curve crosses itself. This means that for two different parameter values, `t1` and `t2`, the coordinates `(x, y)` are the same.\nSo we are looking for the number of distinct points `(x, y)` for which there exist `t1 ≠ t2` such that:\n1. `x(t1) = x(t2)`  => `cos(9t1) = cos(9t2)`\n2. `y(t1) = y(t2)`  => `sin(5t1) = sin(5t2)`\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Period of the Curve**\n\nThe period of `x(t) = cos(9t)` is `T_x = 2π / 9`.\nThe period of `y(t) = sin(5t)` is `T_y = 2π / 5`.\nThe period `T` of the entire curve is the least common multiple of `T_x` and `T_y`.\n`T = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π / GCD(9, 5) = 2π / 1 = 2π`.\nWe need to find the number of self-intersections for `t` in the interval `[0, 2π)`.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Standard Formula for Lissajous Curves**\n\nFor a Lissajous curve given by `x(t) = sin(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`, where `a` and `b` are coprime integers, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\n`N = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2`\n\nOur curve is `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`. We can rewrite `x(t)` to match the standard form:\n`x(t) = cos(9t) = sin(9t + π/2)`.\nSo, our curve is of the form `x(t) = sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`, with:\n`a = 9`, `b = 5`, and a phase shift `δ = π/2`.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Effect of the Phase Shift**\nThe phase shift `δ` can sometimes change the number of intersection points, particularly if it causes the curve to pass through the origin or create points of self-tangency (cusps).\n*   **Check for passing through the origin (0,0):**\n    We need a `t` for which `cos(9t) = 0` and `sin(5t) = 0` simultaneously.\n    `cos(9t) = 0` implies `9t = (2k + 1)π/2` for some integer `k`.\n    `sin(5t) = 0` implies `5t = mπ` for some integer `m`.\n    Equating the expressions for `t`: `(2k + 1)π/18 = mπ/5` => `5(2k + 1) = 18m`.\n    The left side `(10k + 5)` is always odd, while the right side `(18m)` is always even. There are no integer solutions for `k` and `m`. Thus, the curve does not pass through the origin.\n*   **Check for cusps (points of self-tangency):**\n    This occurs if the velocity vector `(dx/dt, dy/dt)` is zero for some `t`.\n    `dx/dt = -9sin(9t) = 0` implies `9t = kπ`.\n    `dy/dt = 5cos(5t) = 0` implies `5t = (m + 1/2)π`.\n    Equating `t`: `kπ/9 = (m + 1/2)π/5` => `10k = 9(2m + 1)`.\n    Again, the left side is even and the right side is odd, so there are no solutions. The curve has no cusps.\n\nSince the curve does not pass through the origin and has no cusps, for `a` and `b` both being odd integers (as 9 and 5 are), the phase shift `δ = π/2` does not change the number of self-intersections from the zero-phase case. Therefore, we can reliably use the standard formula.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Number of Intersections**\n\nUsing the formula with `a = 9` and `b = 5`:\n`N = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2`\n`N = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2`\n`N = (8)(4) / 2`\n`N = 32 / 2`\n`N = 16`\n\n**Step 5: Analysis by On-Axis Intersections (for verification)**\n\nWe can also find the intersections on the axes to build confidence in the result.\n*   **Intersections on the y-axis (x = 0):**\n    `x(t) = cos(9t) = 0` => `t = (2k+1)π / 18` for `k=0, 1, ..., 17`.\n    For an intersection, we need `t1 ≠ t2` such that `x(t1)=x(t2)=0` and `y(t1)=y(t2)`.\n    This analysis shows there are 4 distinct intersection points on the positive y-axis and 4 on the negative y-axis. Total = 8.\n*   **Intersections on the x-axis (y = 0):**\n    `y(t) = sin(5t) = 0` => `t = mπ / 5` for `m=0, 1, ..., 9`.\n    For an intersection, we need `t1 ≠ t2` such that `y(t1)=y(t2)=0` and `x(t1)=x(t2)`.\n    This analysis shows there are 2 distinct intersection points on the positive x-axis and 2 on the negative x-axis. Total = 4.\n\nThe on-axis intersections sum to `8 + 4 = 12`.\nThe total number of intersections is 16. This means there must be `16 - 12 = 4` intersections that are not on the axes. Due to the symmetry of the curve `(x(π-t), y(π-t)) = (-x, y)` and `(x(-t), y(-t)) = (x, -y)`, if `(x_0, y_0)` is an off-axis intersection, then `(-x_0, y_0)`, `(x_0, -y_0)`, and `(-x_0, -y_0)` must also be intersection points. So, off-axis intersections come in sets of 4. This is consistent with our result (`12 on-axis + 4 off-axis = 16`).\n\nThe number of self-intersection points is 16."
