    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Great Icosahedron**\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is a star-shaped object whose 20 faces are equilateral triangles that intersect each other. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n\n**Step 2: Define the \"Outer-Hull\"**\nThe \"outer-hull\" of a polyhedron is another term for its convex hull. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that completely contains the object. You can visualize this as shrink-wrapping the object with a plastic film; the resulting shape is the convex hull.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Outer-Hull of the Great Icosahedron**\nThe 12 vertices of the great icosahedron are located at the exact same positions in space as the 12 vertices of a regular (convex) icosahedron. Since the convex hull is determined by the outermost vertices of an object, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Triangulation of the Outer-Hull**\nThe question asks for the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull.\"\n*   The outer-hull is a regular icosahedron.\n*   A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose surface is already naturally composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles.\n*   This structure is itself a valid and minimal triangulation of its own surface. Any further subdivision would result in more triangles.\n\n**Step 5: Count the \"Visible Triangles from the Outside\"**\nThe question specifies \"the number of visible triangles from the outside.\"\n*   The outer-hull (the regular icosahedron) is a convex polyhedron.\n*   By definition, all faces of a convex polyhedron lie on its exterior surface.\n*   Therefore, all 20 triangular faces of the regular icosahedron are visible from the outside.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe problem simplifies to finding the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n1. The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n2. The surface of a regular icosahedron is composed of 20 triangular faces.\n3. This is the minimal triangulation of the surface.\n4. All 20 triangles are visible from the outside.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles required is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
