    "This problem asks for the conditions that guarantee the existence of a special type of fixed point for three functions, F, G, and H, involving three sets, X, Y, and Z. The solution involves applying the well-known Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to a composite operator defined on the product of the three spaces.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\"**\n\nFirst, we need to precisely define what an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" means based on the provided functions.\n*   We are given three non-empty sets: X, Y, Z.\n*   We have three functions (mappings):\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet of elements `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z`, that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Note the order of arguments in each function, as this is crucial. For `G`, the arguments are `(y, x, y)`, and for `H`, they are `(z, y, x)`. This structure dictates how the conditions will be formed.\n\n**Step 2: Reframe as a Single Fixed-Point Problem**\n\nThe standard approach for solving such systems is to use the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. This requires us to define a single operator on a single space.\n\n*   **Define the space:** We create the product space `P = X × Y × Z`.\n*   **Define the operator:** We combine F, G, and H into a single operator `T: P → P` as follows:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n*   An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` is now simply a fixed point of the operator `T`, since `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)` is equivalent to the system of equations from Step 1.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that if `(P, d_P)` is a non-empty complete metric space and `T: P → P` is a **contraction mapping**, then `T` has a unique fixed point. This gives us our primary conditions.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This leads to two main requirements:\n1.  The space `P` must be a complete metric space.\n2.  The operator `T` must be a contraction mapping on `P`.\n\n**Step 4: Deconstruct the Conditions**\n\n**Condition 1: Complete Metric Space**\n\nFor the product space `(P, d_P)` to be a complete metric space, each of its component spaces must be a complete metric space.\n*   Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be metric spaces.\n*   We can define a metric on `P = X × Y × Z`. A convenient choice is the sum metric:\n    `d_P((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`\n*   The product space `(P, d_P)` is complete if and only if `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are all complete.\n\n**This is the first major condition.**\n\n**Condition 2: Contraction Mapping**\n\nThe operator `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `p1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `p2 = (x2, y2, z2)` in `P`, the following inequality holds:\n`d_P(T(p1), T(p2)) ≤ k * d_P(p1, p2)`\n\nTo find what this means for F, G, and H, we assume they satisfy Lipschitz-type conditions. Let's expand the inequality using the definition of `T` and `d_P`:\n\n`d_X(F(x1,y1,z1), F(x2,y2,z2)) + d_Y(G(y1,x1,y1), G(y2,x2,y2)) + d_Z(H(z1,y1,x1), H(z2,y2,x2))`\n`≤ k * (d_X(x1,x2) + d_Y(y1,y2) + d_Z(z1,z2))`\n\nTo guarantee this, we establish separate bounds for F, G, and H.\n*   **For F:** Assume there exist non-negative constants `α1, α2, α3` such that:\n    `d_X(F(x1,y1,z1), F(x2,y2,z2)) ≤ α1*d_X(x1,x2) + α2*d_Y(y1,y2) + α3*d_Z(z1,z2)`\n\n*   **For G:** Assume there exist non-negative constants `β1, β2` such that:\n    `d_Y(G(y1,x1,y1), G(y2,x2,y2)) ≤ β1*d_Y(y1,y2) + β2*d_X(x1,x2)`\n    (Note: G depends on changes in `x` and `y` only).\n\n*   **For H:** Assume there exist non-negative constants `γ1, γ2, γ3` such that:\n    `d_Z(H(z1,y1,x1), H(z2,y2,x2)) ≤ γ1*d_Z(z1,z2) + γ2*d_Y(y1,y2) + γ3*d_X(x1,x2)`\n    (Note: H depends on changes in `x`, `y`, and `z`).\n\nNow, sum these three inequalities:\n`d_P(T(p1), T(p2))`\n`≤ (α1*d_X + α2*d_Y + α3*d_Z) + (β2*d_X + β1*d_Y) + (γ3*d_X + γ2*d_Y + γ1*d_Z)`\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Group the terms by their corresponding distance function (`d_X`, `d_Y`, `d_Z`):\n`d_P(T(p1), T(p2)) ≤ (α1+β2+γ3)d_X(x1,x2) + (α2+β1+γ2)d_Y(y1,y2) + (α3+γ1)d_Z(z1,z2)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, we need the right-hand side to be `≤ k * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z)` for a `k < 1`. This is achieved if the coefficient of each distance term is less than `k`.\nLet `k = max { (α1+β2+γ3), (α2+β1+γ2), (α3+γ1) }`.\nIf we require `k < 1`, then `T` is a contraction mapping.\n\n**This gives us the second major condition, related to the contraction coefficients.**\n\n### Final Answer: Summary of Conditions\n\nFor the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y` and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point, the following conditions derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem are sufficient:\n\n1.  **Metric Space Condition:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be non-empty **complete metric spaces** with respective metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n\n2.  **Contraction Conditions:** The functions must satisfy the following Lipschitz-type inequalities for all `x1,x2 ∈ X`, `y1,y2 ∈ Y`, and `z1,z2 ∈ Z`:\n    *   There exist non-negative constants `α1, α2, α3` such that:\n        `d_X(F(x1,y1,z1), F(x2,y2,z2)) ≤ α1*d_X(x1,x2) + α2*d_Y(y1,y2) + α3*d_Z(z1,z2)`\n    *   There exist non-negative constants `β1, β2` such that:\n        `d_Y(G(y1,x1,y1), G(y2,x2,y2)) ≤ β1*d_Y(y1,y2) + β2*d_X(x1,x2)`\n    *   There exist non-negative constants `γ1, γ2, γ3` such that:\n        `d_Z(H(z1,y1,x1), H(z2,y2,x2)) ≤ γ1*d_Z(z1,z2) + γ2*d_Y(y1,y2) + γ3*d_X(x1,x2)`\n\n3.  **Overall Contraction Constant Condition:** The sum of the corresponding Lipschitz constants must be less than 1. Specifically:\n    `max { (α1 + β2 + γ3), (α2 + β1 + γ2), (α3 + γ1) } < 1`\n\nIf these three conditions hold, there exists a **unique** triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` such that `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z`.\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n1.  **Completeness of Spaces:** The sets X, Y, and Z are non-empty complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Lipschitz-type Conditions:** There exist non-negative constants (`α1,α2,α3`, `β1,β2`, `γ1,γ2,γ3`) such that for all `x1,x2 ∈ X`, `y1,y2 ∈ Y`, `z1,z2 ∈ Z`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x1,y1,z1), F(x2,y2,z2)) ≤ α1*d_X(x1,x2) + α2*d_Y(y1,y2) + α3*d_Z(z1,z2)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y1,x1,y1), G(y2,x2,y2)) ≤ β1*d_Y(y1,y2) + β2*d_X(x1,x2)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z1,y1,x1), H(z2,y2,x2)) ≤ γ1*d_Z(z1,z2) + γ2*d_Y(y1,y2) + γ3*d_X(x1,x2)`\n3.  **Contraction Criterion:** The sum of the coefficients, grouped by the variable whose distance they multiply, is less than 1. That is: `max { (α1 + β2 + γ3), (α2 + β1 + γ2), (α3 + γ1) } < 1`.>>>"
