    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms and determine the total number of electrons (N).**\n    *   The molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\n    *   The atoms are: 1 Carbon (C), 3 Hydrogen (H), 1 Silicon (Si), and 1 Fluorine (F).\n    *   We sum the atomic numbers to find the total number of electrons:\n        *   C: 6 electrons\n        *   H: 1 electron (x3) = 3 electrons\n        *   Si: 14 electrons\n        *   F: 9 electrons\n    *   Total number of electrons, N = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = **32 electrons**.\n    *   Since N is even, the molecule has a singlet ground state (Total Spin, S=0). A \"full CI calculation\" typically refers to the ground state, which is a singlet state.\n\n2.  **Determine the total number of basis functions (M).**\n    *   The basis set is 6-31G**. This is also written as 6-31G(d,p). It specifies polarization functions for both heavy atoms (d-functions) and hydrogen atoms (p-functions).\n    *   We need to count the number of atomic orbitals (basis functions) for each atom. For Pople-style basis sets like this, by default, polarization functions are Cartesian (6 d-functions, 3 p-functions).\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H):**\n        *   The 6-31G part gives 2 s-type functions.\n        *   The second `*` (or `,p`) adds a set of 3 p-functions (px, py, pz).\n        *   Total per H = 2s + 3p = 5 basis functions.\n        *   There are 3 H atoms, so 3 * 5 = 15 functions.\n    *   **For Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (2nd-row atoms):**\n        *   The 6-31G part gives 9 basis functions (1s core + split valence 2s and 2p).\n        *   The first `*` (or `,d`) adds a set of 6 d-functions.\n        *   Total per C or F = 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n        *   There is 1 C and 1 F, so 15 + 15 = 30 functions.\n    *   **For Silicon (Si) (3rd-row atom):**\n        *   The 6-31G part gives 13 basis functions (1s,2s,2p core + split valence 3s and 3p).\n        *   The first `*` (or `,d`) adds a set of 6 d-functions.\n        *   Total per Si = 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n    *   **Total basis functions (M):**\n        *   M = (functions for C) + 3 * (functions for H) + (functions for Si) + (functions for F)\n        *   M = 15 + 3 * 5 + 19 + 15\n        *   M = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = **64 basis functions**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of singlet (S=0) CSFs.**\n    *   For a full CI calculation with N electrons in M spatial orbitals, the number of singlet (S=0) CSFs can be calculated using the Pauncz formula:\n        $N_{CSF} = \\binom{M}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{M}{N/2-1}\\binom{M}{N/2+1}$\n    *   We have N = 32 and M = 64.\n    *   Therefore, N/2 = 16.\n    *   The formula becomes:\n        $N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15}\\binom{64}{17}$\n\n4.  **Compute the values.**\n    *   First, we calculate the required binomial coefficients:\n        *   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16! \\cdot 48!} = 7,009,015,942,360,814$\n        *   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15! \\cdot 49!} = 2,288,985,120,351,312$\n        *   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17! \\cdot 47!} = 19,790,162,660,781,120$\n    *   Next, we substitute these values into the formula:\n        *   $\\binom{64}{16}^2 = (7,009,015,942,360,814)^2 = 49,126,302,058,476,711,867,184,207,992,796$\n        *   $\\binom{64}{15} \\times \\binom{64}{17} = (2,288,985,120,351,312) \\times (19,790,162,660,781,120) = 45,300,185,994,460,582,508,228,030,284,640$\n    *   Finally, we perform the subtraction:\n        *   $N_{CSF} = 49,126,302,058,476,711,867,184,207,992,796 - 45,300,185,994,460,582,508,228,030,284,640$\n        *   $N_{CSF} = 3,826,116,064,016,129,358,956,177,708,156$\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Electron Count:** Accurately sum the electrons from all atoms in the chemical formula.\n*   **Basis Function Count:** Correctly interpret the basis set notation (e.g., `**` means polarization on all atoms, `*` means only on heavy atoms). The choice between 6 Cartesian d-functions and 5 spherical d-functions is a common ambiguity; the standard for Pople basis sets is 6 Cartesian d-functions, which was used here.\n*   **CSF Formula:** The correct formula must be used. There are several equivalent formulas (e.g., Weyl-Paldus, Pauncz). We use the Pauncz formula here. It is crucial to use the correct number of electrons (N) and basis functions (M).\n*   **Calculation Precision:** The intermediate numbers are extremely large, so calculations must be performed with arbitrary-precision arithmetic to avoid rounding errors.\n\nThe final answer is the integer calculated above.\n\n<<<3826116064016129358956177708156>>>"
