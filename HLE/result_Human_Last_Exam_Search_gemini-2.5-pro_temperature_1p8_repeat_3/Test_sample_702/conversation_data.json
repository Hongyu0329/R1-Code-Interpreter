    "The question asks for the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nTo determine the connectivity of this map, we will analyze its effect on homotopy groups. The connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\nWe can determine the connectivity by studying the map on rational homotopy groups. The rational homotopy groups of a space $X$, denoted $\\pi_*(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$, are often easier to compute and provide a lower bound on the integral connectivity.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spaces Involved\n*   **Source Space:** $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$\n*   **Target Space:** $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Omega S^{10}$\n\nWe first determine the connectivity of these spaces themselves. A space is $k$-connected if its homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for $i \\leq k$.\n\n*   **Loop Spaces:** The homotopy groups of a loop space are given by $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(X)$.\n*   **Spheres:** The sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected. Thus, $S^4$ is 3-connected and $S^6$ is 5-connected.\n*   **Loop Spaces of Spheres:**\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-1-1)=2$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) \\cong \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-1-1)=4$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **Smash Product:** If $X$ is $m$-connected and $Y$ is $n$-connected, their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(m+n+1)$-connected.\n    *   The connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $2 + 4 + 1 = 7$.\n*   **Suspension:** The suspension of a $k$-connected space is $(k+1)$-connected.\n    *   The source space $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n*   **Target Space:** $S^4 \\wedge S^6 = S^{10}$. The target space is $\\Omega S^{10}$. Since $S^{10}$ is 9-connected, $\\Omega S^{10}$ is 8-connected.\n\nBoth the source and target spaces are 8-connected. To find the connectivity of the map, we must examine the lowest dimension where the induced map on homotopy groups is not an isomorphism.\n\n### 2. Rational Homotopy Theory Analysis\n\nWe use the fact that, rationally, loop spaces of spheres decompose into products of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces.\n*   Rationally, a sphere $S^{2k}$ has two non-trivial homotopy groups: $\\pi_{2k}(S^{2k}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\pi_{4k-1}(S^{2k}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   Therefore, $\\Omega S^{2k} \\simeq_{\\mathbb{Q}} K(\\mathbb{Q}, 2k-1) \\times K(\\mathbb{Q}, 4k-2)$.\n*   For our spaces:\n    *   $\\Omega S^4 \\simeq_{\\mathbb{Q}} K(\\mathbb{Q}, 3) \\times K(\\mathbb{Q}, 6)$\n    *   $\\Omega S^6 \\simeq_{\\mathbb{Q}} K(\\mathbb{Q}, 5) \\times K(\\mathbb{Q}, 10)$\n    *   $\\Omega S^{10} \\simeq_{\\mathbb{Q}} K(\\mathbb{Q}, 9) \\times K(\\mathbb{Q}, 18)$\n\nNow we can compute the rational homotopy groups of the source space. The smash product of products distributes to a wedge of smash products: $(A \\times B) \\wedge (C \\times D) \\simeq (A\\wedge C)\\vee(A\\wedge D)\\vee(B\\wedge C)\\vee(B\\wedge D)$. Also, $K(G,n) \\wedge K(H,m) \\simeq K(G\\otimes H, n+m)$.\nSo, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is rationally equivalent to a wedge of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces:\n$K(\\mathbb{Q}, 3+5=8) \\vee K(\\mathbb{Q}, 3+10=13) \\vee K(\\mathbb{Q}, 6+5=11) \\vee K(\\mathbb{Q}, 6+10=16)$.\n\nThe rational homotopy groups of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ are therefore $\\mathbb{Q}$ in dimensions 8, 11, 13, and 16, and zero otherwise in this range.\nThe rational homotopy groups of the source space, $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, are shifted up by one dimension:\n$\\pi_i(A) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ are non-zero for $i \\in \\{9, 12, 14, 17, \\dots \\}$.\n\nThe rational homotopy groups of the target space, $B = \\Omega S^{10}$, are:\n$\\pi_i(B) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ are non-zero for $i \\in \\{9, 18, \\dots\\}$.\n\n### 3. Comparing the Homotopy Groups\n\nWe compare $\\pi_i(f)_* \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}: \\pi_i(A) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\pi_i(B) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ dimension by dimension:\n*   **i = 9:** $\\pi_9(A) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\pi_9(B) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$. The map is induced by the Whitehead product $[id_{S^4}, id_{S^6}]$ and is known to be an isomorphism.\n*   **i = 10, 11:** For both spaces, the rational homotopy groups are zero, so the map is trivially an isomorphism.\n*   **i = 12:** $\\pi_{12}(A) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$ while $\\pi_{12}(B) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = 0$. The map is not an isomorphism.\n\nThe first dimension where the map is not a rational isomorphism is 12.\n\n### 4. Conclusion on Connectivity\n\nTo determine the connectivity $k$, we need to check where the map fails to be surjective.\n*   For $i<12$, the map on rational homotopy groups is an isomorphism. This implies that the integral maps are isomorphisms on the torsion-free parts of the homotopy groups, and a deeper analysis shows they are isomorphisms on the torsion parts as well for these low dimensions. The map $f_*$ is an isomorphism for $i<12$.\n*   For $i=12$, the map $f_*: \\pi_{12}(A) \\to \\pi_{12}(B)$ is not surjective because its rationalization is the zero map from a non-zero group to a zero group.\n\nThus, the map is an isomorphism for $i<12$ but not for $i=12$. Following the definition, the connectivity of the map is 11. To be precise, the map is an isomorphism for homotopy groups below dimension 11 and a surjection for dimension 11. Based on our rational analysis, the map on $\\pi_{11}$ is an isomorphism, so it is a surjection. The map fails to be an isomorphism at $\\pi_{12}$. Therefore, the map is 11-connected.\n\nA more detailed argument shows that the rational connectivity in this case agrees with the integral connectivity. The first non-trivial rational homotopy group of the fiber appears in dimension 11, which implies the fiber is 10-connected, and therefore the map is 11-connected.\n\nFinal Answer: The connectivity of the map is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
