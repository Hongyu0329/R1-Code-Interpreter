    "Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8. To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation, we first need to find the number of functions for each atom and then multiply by the number of atoms of that type.\n\nFor the 6-31G basis set:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Each hydrogen atom is represented by 2 contracted Gaussian functions. This is because the 1s orbital is described by a split-valence basis set, with one function for the inner part (composed of 3 primitive Gaussians) and one for the outer part (composed of 1 primitive Gaussian).\n*   **Carbon (C):** Each carbon atom is represented by 9 contracted Gaussian functions. This includes one for the 1s core orbital (a contraction of 6 primitive Gaussians), and for the valence 2s and 2p orbitals, it uses a split-valence description (3+1 for each). This gives 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 2 (for 2px) + 2 (for 2py) + 2 (for 2pz) = 9 functions. Note that s and p orbitals can sometimes be combined into \"sp\" orbitals in Pople-style basis sets.\n\nNow, we calculate the total for toluene (C7H8):\n*   **For the 7 Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **For the 8 Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\nTherefore, a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene uses a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
