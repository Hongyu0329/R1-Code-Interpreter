Yes, such a combination of parameters and pair of graphs exists. An example is the class $\mathsf{srg}(16, 6, 2, 2)$, which contains the Shrikhande graph and the line graph of $K_{4,4}$. These two graphs are not isomorphic but share the same parameters. The Shrikhande graph has 240 5-cycles, while the line graph of $K_{4,4}$ has 312 5-cycles.
