The new food, which tastes like bean salad, is likely the velvet bean (*Mucuna pruriens*). Its importance stems from the fact that it is a rich natural source of L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine. In the patient's case, increasing dopamine levels is critical because it inhibits the secretion of prolactin, which would help to control the growth of her suspected prolactinoma (a type of pituitary tumor). This tumor is the likely cause of her postpartum symptoms (fatigue, chills, hair loss) due to compression of the pituitary gland. Therefore, this diet serves as a natural therapeutic alternative to the dopamine agonist medication that was discontinued.
