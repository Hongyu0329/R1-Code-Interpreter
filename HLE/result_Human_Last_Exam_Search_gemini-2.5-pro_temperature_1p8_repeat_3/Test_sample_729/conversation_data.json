    "The term \"power subgroup\" is not a standard term in group theory. The most probable interpretation is that it refers to a **cyclic subgroup**, which is a subgroup generated by the integer powers of a single element. Based on this interpretation, the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 (Q₁₂₈) can be determined as follows.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q₁₂₈ can be represented by the presentation:\nQ₁₂₈ = < a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ >\n\nThe subgroups of Q₁₂₈ are either cyclic or themselves generalized quaternion groups. To find the number of \"power subgroups,\" we count the number of cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe cyclic subgroups of Q₁₂₈ can be divided into two categories:\n\n1.  **Subgroups of the cyclic group < a >:** The element 'a' generates a cyclic subgroup of order 64. A cyclic group of order *n* has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of *n*. The number of divisors of 64 (which is 2⁶) is 6 + 1 = 7. These subgroups are of orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements outside of < a >:** The elements not in the subgroup < a > are of the form aᵏx, where k ranges from 0 to 63. There are 64 such elements, and they all have an order of 4. A cyclic group of order 4 has φ(4) = 2 generators (where φ is Euler's totient function). Therefore, the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by these elements is 64 / 2 = 32.\n\nCombining these two sets, the total number of cyclic subgroups is 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nIt is worth noting that since Q₁₂₈ is a 2-group (a group of prime power order), all of its subgroups have an order that is a power of 2. If \"power subgroup\" were to be interpreted as any subgroup of prime power order, then it would refer to all subgroups of Q₁₂₈.\n\nUnder the most common and standard interpretation that \"power subgroup\" refers to a cyclic subgroup, there are 39 such subgroups.\n\n<<<39>>>"
