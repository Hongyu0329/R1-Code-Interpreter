    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` has a structure based on a triangulene core. The search results confirm that triangulene and its derivatives are planar molecules with three-fold symmetry.\n\nThe symmetry group for this molecule is **D3h**. This is determined by identifying the symmetry elements present in its structure:\n\n*   **One C3 axis of rotation:** The molecule is unchanged by a 120° rotation around an axis passing through the center of the central ring. This three-fold symmetry is a key feature of triangulenes.\n*   **Three C2 axes of rotation:** There are three two-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the main C3 axis. Each C2 axis passes through the center of the molecule and one of the corners that is substituted with an ethynyl group.\n*   **One horizontal mirror plane (σh):** The molecule is planar, meaning the plane of the molecule itself acts as a mirror plane.\n*   **Three vertical mirror planes (σv):** Each of these planes contains the C3 axis and one of the C2 axes.\n*   **One S3 improper axis of rotation:** Coincident with the C3 axis.\n\nThe presence of a C3 axis along with three perpendicular C2 axes places the molecule in the D3 point group family. The addition of the horizontal mirror plane (σh) makes the final point group D3h.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
