    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, a strong emphasis is placed on maintaining a square and stable torso. This means the hips and shoulders should remain aligned and facing forward as much as possible throughout the movement. The backbend in a cambré derrière initiates from the upper back, and the technique is characterized by its precision, control, and expressive use of the arms and head (épaulement). The goal is to create harmonious and sculptural shapes while adhering to a codified system.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is known for its speed, athleticism, and the creation of long, extended lines. A defining characteristic of the Balanchine style, particularly evident in arabesques which are often combined with a cambré derrière, is the opening of the hip of the working leg toward the audience. George Balanchine allowed the hip to lift, breaking from the traditional squared-off posture to create the illusion of a higher and longer line. This technique results in a \"three-dimensional spiral from the waist up\" and contributes to the dynamic and neoclassical look of his choreography.\n\nWhile there are also differences in the general speed of movement (Balanchine being faster) and the placement of the head, the modification of the hip placement is a fundamental technical departure from the classical Vaganova approach.\n\n<<<B>>>"
