    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that transforms aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. This is achieved by reacting the carbonyl compound with a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent. The reaction mechanism results in the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group being replaced by the carbon group from the ylide, forming a new carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nIn this specific reaction, the reactants are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with the structure (CH3)3C-CHO. It is known for the steric bulk of its tert-butyl group.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane:** This is the phosphorus ylide, which has the structure Ph3P=CH-CH2-(o-ClC6H4). The carbanion of the ylide is attached to an alkyl group, classifying it as a non-stabilized (or unstabilized) ylide.\n\nThe Wittig reaction's stereochemistry—that is, whether it produces a (Z)-alkene (cis) or an (E)-alkene (trans)—is heavily dependent on the type of ylide used. Non-stabilized ylides, like the one in this reaction, predominantly form (Z)-alkenes under standard, lithium-free conditions.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows: the ylide attacks the aldehyde, replacing the carbonyl C=O double bond with a C=C double bond. The resulting product is an alkene with the structure (CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(o-ClC6H4). Based on IUPAC nomenclature, this compound is named **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nGiven that a non-stabilized ylide is used, the major product will be the (Z)-isomer. Therefore, the principal product of this reaction is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
