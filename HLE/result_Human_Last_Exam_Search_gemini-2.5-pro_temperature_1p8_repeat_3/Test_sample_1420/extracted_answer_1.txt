The scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3, calculated to the first order in the epsilon expansion (ϵ=1) for the O(n) model, is given by the formula α = (4 - n) / (2(n+8)). Its value depends on the number of components 'n' of the order parameter. For the Ising model (n=1), α ≈ 0.167; for the XY model (n=2), α = 0.1; and for the Heisenberg model (n=3), α ≈ 0.045.
