    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat is determined using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion near the upper critical dimension, d_c. For many systems, including the O(n) model which describes magnets with n-component spins, the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. The epsilon expansion is a perturbative approach where calculations are performed as a power series in ϵ = d_c - d.\n\nFor a system with a spatial dimension d=3, the expansion parameter is ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nThe specific heat exponent α can be related to the correlation length exponent ν and the spatial dimension d through the hyperscaling relation:\nα = 2 - νd\n\nTo the first order in the epsilon expansion, the correlation length exponent ν for the O(n) model is given by:\nν = 1/2 + [ (n+2) / (4(n+8)) ] * ϵ\n\nSubstituting the expressions for ν and d = 4 - ϵ into the hyperscaling relation, we can derive the first-order expression for α:\n\nα ≈ 2 - [1/2 + ( (n+2) / (4(n+8)) ) * ϵ] * (4 - ϵ)\nα ≈ 2 - [ 2 - ϵ/2 + ( (n+2) / (n+8) ) * ϵ - ( (n+2) / (4(n+8)) ) * ϵ² ]\nα ≈ [ 1/2 - (n+2)/(n+8) ] * ϵ + O(ϵ²)\nα ≈ [ (n+8 - 2(n+2)) / (2(n+8)) ] * ϵ + O(ϵ²)\n**α ≈ [ (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) ] * ϵ**\n\nFor a spatial dimension of d=3, we set ϵ=1. The value of the exponent α depends on the number of components 'n' of the system's order parameter:\n\n*   For the **Ising model (n=1)**, which describes systems with a single-component order parameter (e.g., simple magnets, liquid-gas transition):\n    α ≈ (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) = 3 / 18 = **1/6 ≈ 0.167**\n*   For the **XY model (n=2)**, which describes systems with a two-component order parameter (e.g., superfluid helium, certain planar magnets):\n    α ≈ (4 - 2) / (2 * (2 + 8)) = 2 / 20 = **1/10 = 0.1**\n*   For the **Heisenberg model (n=3)**, which describes isotropic ferromagnets:\n    α ≈ (4 - 3) / (2 * (3 + 8)) = 1 / 22 = **~0.045**\n\nIt is also noteworthy that for n=4, the first-order epsilon expansion predicts α = 0.\n\n<<<The scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3, calculated to the first order in the epsilon expansion (ϵ=1) for the O(n) model, is given by the formula α = (4 - n) / (2(n+8)). Its value depends on the number of components 'n' of the order parameter. For the Ising model (n=1), α ≈ 0.167; for the XY model (n=2), α = 0.1; and for the Heisenberg model (n=3), α ≈ 0.045.>>>"
