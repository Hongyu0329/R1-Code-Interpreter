    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe dwarf cuttlefish brain is a complex structure organized around the esophagus, broadly divided into a supraesophageal mass and a subesophageal mass. The palliovisceral lobe is part of a larger group of lobes known as the palliovisceral lobe complex, which is situated in the posterior region of the subesophageal mass. This complex is involved in controlling locomotion, including escape jets and inking.\n\nDetailed 3D brain atlases of the dwarf cuttlefish, such as Cuttlebase, provide a clear understanding of the spatial arrangement of these neural structures. Based on posterior views of the cuttlefish brain from these resources, the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes are located immediately behind the main palliovisceral lobe.\n\nSpecifically:\n*   **Posterior Chromatophore Lobes (PCL):** These paired lobes are located in the dorsal and posterior region of the subesophageal mass and are crucial for controlling the chromatophores on the mantle, allowing the cuttlefish to change its skin patterns for camouflage and communication.\n*   **Fin Lobes (F):** Also paired, the fin lobes are responsible for controlling the movement of the cuttlefish's fins.\n\nThe entire brain is encased in a cartilaginous cranium for protection."
