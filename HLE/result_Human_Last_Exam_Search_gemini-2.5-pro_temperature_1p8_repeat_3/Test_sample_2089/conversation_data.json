    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals her fate in a pivotal bus scene is the 2010 Canadian film *Incendies*, directed by Denis Villeneuve. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nThe central character, Nawal Marwan, finds her life irrevocably altered during a brutal civil war in an unnamed Middle Eastern country. While searching for her son who was taken from her at birth, she boards a bus carrying Muslim refugees. The bus is ambushed by Christian nationalists who proceed to massacre the passengers.\n\nNawal survives the initial onslaught and, to save herself from the perpetrators who are setting the bus on fire, she reveals a crucifix, proving she is a Christian. In a desperate attempt to also save a young girl, Nawal claims the child as her own. However, the girl runs back towards the burning bus in search of her mother and is shot and killed. This traumatic event solidifies Nawal's resolve to join the fight and assassinate a nationalist leader, a decision that leads to her imprisonment, torture, and the eventual tragic discovery that seals her fate and that of her family. The bus scene is a critical turning point that sets the entire devastating narrative in motion.\n\nWhile the specific dialogue \"Thank you\" is not prominently mentioned in detailed scene descriptions, the act of being spared on the bus is what propels Nawal down a dark path, thus sealing her fate.\n\n<<<Incendies>>>"
