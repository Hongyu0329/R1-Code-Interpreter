    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed which results in a mixture of two diastereoisomers.\n\nThe ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, is a bridging ligand capable of binding to two ruthenium centers. The starting ruthenium complex, cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), is a chiral molecule with a *cis* geometry.\n\nThe reaction involves two equivalents of the ruthenium complex reacting with one equivalent of the bridging ligand. In this process, the two chloride ligands on each ruthenium atom are substituted by the nitrogen atoms of the pyridyl groups of the bridging ligand. This results in the formation of a dinuclear ruthenium complex.\n\nDue to the chirality of the [Ru(bpy)2] units, two diastereomers of the dinuclear product are formed:\n*   A *meso* form, which has opposite chiralities at the two metal centers (Δ/Λ) and possesses a center of inversion.\n*   A *rac* form, which has the same chirality at both metal centers (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ) and contains a two-fold rotation axis.\n\nTherefore, a total of two isomers are formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<2>>>"
