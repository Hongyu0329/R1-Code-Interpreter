    "The value computed between heartbeats, from which Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is derived, is called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nThis interval represents the precise time between consecutive heartbeats and is typically measured in milliseconds. While it is often referred to as the **RR interval** when measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG), the term Interbeat Interval (IBI) is commonly used when the measurement is derived from photoplethysmography (PPG). Other synonymous terms include **beat-to-beat interval** and **heart period**. The analysis of the variations in these IBIs constitutes the measurement of HRV.\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI)>>>"
