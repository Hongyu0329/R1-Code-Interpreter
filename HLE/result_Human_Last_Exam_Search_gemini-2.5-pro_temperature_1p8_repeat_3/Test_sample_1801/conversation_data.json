    "The two Nobel laureates featured in connection with the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial and its associated campaign were physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** and economist **Paul Krugman**.\n\nPhysicist Murray Gell-Mann, a 1969 Nobel laureate, appeared directly in one of the \"Ask Why\" television commercials. In the ad, he discussed the importance of questioning assumptions. For his participation, he received a substantial fee and a membership in the Screen Actors Guild.\n\nPaul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, was a member of Enron's advisory board in 1999. For his role, he received a payment of $50,000. While he did not appear in a commercial, his paid association with Enron has been a subject of discussion and scrutiny, particularly after the company's collapse and his subsequent critical columns about Enron and corporate cronyism.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
