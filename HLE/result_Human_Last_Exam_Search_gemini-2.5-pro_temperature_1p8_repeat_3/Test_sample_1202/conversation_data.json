    "After gene duplication, one of the two gene copies is typically redundant. Without selective pressure to maintain both, one copy is likely to accumulate mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene, a process known as **pseudogenization**. Therefore, for both copies to be retained in the genome, a mechanism must exist that makes both genes essential. The following are the primary models explaining the retention and subsequent divergence of duplicated genes:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange between similar DNA sequences. Rather than promoting divergence, gene conversion tends to homogenize duplicated genes, making them more similar. Thus, it works against divergence, although it can help maintain the functionality of gene pairs.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicated gene, where one copy becomes inactivated by mutations. This leads to the *loss* of one functional copy, not the retention of two diverging functional genes.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy acquires a completely new function through mutation. This process is driven by positive selection for the new function and is a major source of evolutionary novelty. It is a key mechanism for both retaining the duplicate (as each copy now has a distinct, beneficial role) and for their functional divergence.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that an ancestral gene had multiple functions or expression patterns (e.g., activity in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that silence a different sub-function. As a result, both gene copies are required to fully perform all the functions of the single ancestral gene. This \"division of labor\" provides a powerful mechanism for retaining both gene copies through a neutral process, leading to their functional divergence.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macro-evolutionary process where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many species that occupy different ecological niches. While gene duplication is considered a key genetic mechanism that can fuel adaptive radiation by providing the raw material for new adaptations, it is not itself the mechanism of gene retention and divergence at the molecular level within a genome.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are the principal and most accepted mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. They provide a selective advantage (neofunctionalization) or a state of necessity (subfunctionalization) for keeping both copies. While neofunctionalization explains the origin of novel traits, subfunctionalization provides a common, neutral pathway for preserving a large number of duplicates by partitioning their original functions, which might otherwise be lost to pseudogenization. Some evolutionary models suggest that subfunctionalization can be a transitional state that allows for the long-term preservation of a duplicate gene, which may later undergo neofunctionalization. Given its role as a widespread, often neutral mechanism that locks in both copies, it is arguably the most common and likely driver for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\n\nConsidering the choices, both C and D describe key mechanisms. However, the subfunctionalization model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) is often cited as a highly prevalent mechanism because it does not require a rare, beneficial new-function mutation to occur for the duplicates to be preserved.\n\n<<<D>>>"
