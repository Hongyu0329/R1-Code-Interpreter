    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, one must analyze the arrangement of amino acids within its repeating structural motif.\n\nCoiled coils are characterized by a seven-amino-acid pattern known as a heptad repeat, designated by the letters `abcdefg`. The stability and oligomeric state (the number of helical chains) of a coiled coil are largely determined by the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of amino acid side chains at the hydrophobic core positions, which are the 'a' and 'd' positions. Different amino acids at these core positions have distinct packing efficiencies that favor the formation of specific oligomers like dimers, trimers, or tetramers.\n\nThe provided sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. To decipher its structure, we must first identify the heptad repeat. By aligning the sequence to find a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions, a consistent motif emerges where Leucine (L) occupies the 'a' position and Isoleucine (I) occupies the 'd' position.\n\nThe sequence can be broken down as follows, with the heptad repeats identified:\n`GEIAQS` **`LKEIAKS`** **`LKEIAWS`** **`LKEIAQS`** `LKG`\n\nWithin the bolded heptad repeats:\n*   **Heptad 1:** L(a) K(b) E(c) I(d) A(e) K(f) S(g)\n*   **Heptad 2:** L(a) K(b) E(c) I(d) A(e) W(f) S(g)\n*   **Heptad 3:** L(a) K(b) E(c) I(d) A(e) Q(f) S(g)\n\nThis analysis consistently places Leucine (L) at the 'a' position and Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' position.\n\nBased on established principles from structural studies of coiled coils:\n*   Isoleucine at position 'a' and Leucine at position 'd' typically results in a **dimeric** (two-stranded) coiled coil.\n*   A mix of Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions favors a **trimeric** (three-stranded) state.\n*   The reverse arrangement, with Leucine at position 'a' and Isoleucine at position 'd', promotes the formation of a **tetrameric** (four-stranded) structure.\n\nThe sequence in question has Leucine at the 'a' positions and Isoleucine at the 'd' positions. This specific arrangement aligns with the rule for the formation of a tetrameric coiled coil due to the packing geometry of these side chains in the hydrophobic core. Therefore, the protein would most likely be in a tetrameric state.\n\n<<<C>>>"
