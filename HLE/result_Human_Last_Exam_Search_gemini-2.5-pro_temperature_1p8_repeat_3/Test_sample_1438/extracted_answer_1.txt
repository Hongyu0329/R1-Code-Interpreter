The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a single number but is defined by the rules of Berezin integration. For a single Grassmann variable θ, the integration rules are: ∫ dθ = 0 and ∫ θ dθ = 1. It is the anti-commuting property of Grassmann variables (θ²=0), enforced by these integration rules, that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle.
