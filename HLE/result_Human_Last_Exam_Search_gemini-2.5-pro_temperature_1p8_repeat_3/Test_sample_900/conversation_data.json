    "It is not possible to determine the exact number of \"pas de Balanchine\" Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo scene of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for the Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nWhile it is confirmed that Ms. Gileva performed this role, and extensive choreographic analysis exists regarding William Forsythe's style and his deconstruction of the classical ballet vocabulary, a precise, universally accepted definition of a \"pas de Balanchine\" within this context is not available in the searched materials. The term \"pas de Balanchine\" appears to be a stylistic reference to the influence of choreographer George Balanchine, rather than a specific, countable ballet step.\n\nFurthermore, all efforts to locate a video of the 2015 Semperoper Ballett performance featuring Svetlana Gileva in the specified role were unsuccessful, as the referenced YouTube links are no longer active. Without a visual record of the performance and a clear, established definition of the choreographic term in question, any attempt to count the number of \"pas de Balanchine\" would be purely speculative.\n\nCritical reviews and publications confirm Svetlana Gileva's performances in \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" often noting the exceptional quality of her dancing and the overall power of the Forsythe choreography. These sources, however, do not provide a detailed movement analysis that would allow for the identification and enumeration of specific steps like a \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\n<<<Not answerable>>>"
