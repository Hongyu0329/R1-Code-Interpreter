    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, involves two objects $[m]$ and $[n]$ and two monotone maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$. These maps must satisfy the conditions for a Galois connection between posets.\n\nSpecifically, an adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps (functors, in this context) $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ such that for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, the following equivalence holds:\n$L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$.\n\nThis pair of maps $(L,R)$ forms an adjunction, and each map uniquely determines the other. An adjunction is therefore specified by either a suitable map $L$ or a suitable map $R$. Let's analyze the conditions on these maps.\n\n1.  **Counting via the left adjoint $L: \\to$**:\n    A monotone map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ has a right adjoint $R$ if and only if for every $j \\in [n]$, the set $\\{i \\in [m] \\mid L(i) \\le j\\}$ has a maximum element. Since $[m]$ is a finite set, any non-empty subset has a maximum. Thus, the condition simplifies to this set being non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$. For this to hold for all $j$, we only need to check the \"worst case,\" which corresponds to the smallest value, $j=0$. So, there must exist an $i \\in [m]$ such that $L(i) \\le 0$. As the codomain of $L$ is $[n]=\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, all values are non-negative, so this forces $L(i)=0$. Since $L$ is monotone (order-preserving), if $L(i)=0$ for some $i$, then for all $k \\le i$, we have $L(k) \\le L(i) = 0$, which implies $L(k)=0$. The condition is therefore met if and only if $L(0)=0$.\n\n    So, we need to count the number of monotone maps $L: \\to$ that satisfy $L(0)=0$. A monotone map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$. We have the constraint $L(0)=0$, so we must determine the number of sequences $0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$. This is a classic combinatorial problem equivalent to choosing a multiset of 23 elements from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which has $37+1=38$ elements). The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{k+s-1}{k}$, where $k=23$ is the number of items to choose and $s=38$ is the number of categories to choose from. The result is $\\binom{23+38-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n2.  **Counting via the right adjoint $R: \\to$**:\n    A monotone map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ has a left adjoint $L$ if and only if for every $i \\in [m]$, the set $\\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le R(j)\\}$ has a minimum element. Since $[n]$ is well-ordered, this is equivalent to the set being non-empty. For this to hold for all $i \\in [m]$, we check the most restrictive case, which is for the largest value, $i=m$. So there must exist a $j \\in [n]$ such that $R(j) \\ge m$. As the codomain of $R$ is $[m] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$, this implies that for some $j$, $R(j)=m$. Since $R$ is monotone, its maximum value is $R(n)$. Therefore, the condition simplifies to $R(n)=m$.\n\n    In our case, we need to count the number of monotone maps $R: \\to$ such that $R(37)=23$. This requires choosing the sequence $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(36)$ subject to $0 \\le R(0) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$. This is equivalent to choosing a multiset of 37 elements from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$ (which has $23+1=24$ elements). The number of such maps is given by $\\binom{37+24-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nThe two counting methods produce the same number, since $\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot (60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot 37!} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is therefore given by this binomial coefficient.\n\n<<<C(60, 23)>>>"
