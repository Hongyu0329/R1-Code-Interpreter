    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors: white, red, violet, black, and blue. A sixth color, yellow, is also commonly associated with phosphorus, but it is actually a result of the degradation of white phosphorus rather than being a distinct allotrope itself.\n\nHere are the primary allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors:\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This is a waxy, translucent solid. Although it is named \"white,\" it often has a pale yellow appearance due to impurities or the gradual transformation to red phosphorus when exposed to light and heat. It is the most reactive and unstable of the common allotropes.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is formed when white phosphorus is heated in the absence of air. It is much more stable and less reactive than white phosphorus and is dark red in color. It is used on the striking surface of safety matchboxes.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a crystalline form that can be produced by heating red phosphorus to a high temperature. It is sometimes considered a crystalline form of red phosphorus, but is identified by its distinct violet or purple color.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus and is the least reactive. It has a graphite-like appearance, being black and flaky. There are two forms, α-black and β-black, both of which are black.\n\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** This is a more recently synthesized two-dimensional allotrope. It is considered a monolayer material and has a distinct blue color.\n\nIn summary, the pure allotropes of phosphorus display a range of colors including white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\n<<<5>>>"
