    "Without the influence of the Norse language following the Viking invasions, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **\"suster\"**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is a product of a linguistic blend that occurred between the 8th and 11th centuries. The original Old English, or Anglo-Saxon, words for a female sibling were primarily **`sweostor`** and, particularly in the influential dialects of West Saxon and Mercia, **`swuster`**.\n\nThe key change that led to the modern word was the alteration of the first vowel sound. The pronunciation with an \"i\" (as in \"sit\") was a direct borrowing from the Old Norse word **`systir`**, which was brought to England by Norse settlers. In a clear example of linguistic exchange, the Old English form was reshaped by its close Scandinavian counterpart.\n\nHad the Norse never introduced `systir`, the native Old English `swuster` would have followed a different evolutionary path. During the transition to Middle English, `swuster` became `suster`. This form was common before being gradually replaced by the Norse-influenced \"sister\".\n\nFollowing standard English phonological changes, the Middle English `suster` (pronounced with a 'u' sound as in 'put') would have evolved into Modern English. The short 'u' sound, in this context, typically developed into the /ÊŒ/ vowel sound we hear in words like \"cup\" or \"son\". Therefore, the pronunciation would be similar to \"duster\" or \"rust\".\n\nThus, if the linguistic landscape of England had not been altered by Norse interaction, English speakers today would likely refer to their female siblings as \"suster\"."
