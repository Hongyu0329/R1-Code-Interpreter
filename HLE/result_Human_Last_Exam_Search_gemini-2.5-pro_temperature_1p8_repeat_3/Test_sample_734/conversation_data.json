    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the alterations in natural laws at the Fall is the Apostle Paul.\n\nIn his Epistle to the Romans, Paul introduces the concepts of the \"**law of sin and death**\" and the \"**law of the Spirit of life**\". This framework explains the theological shift in the principles governing humanity and creation.\n\n*   **The Law of Sin and Death**: This terminology describes the state of existence after the Fall of Adam. Paul argues that through Adam's transgression, sin entered the world, and death through sin, establishing a principle or \"law\" that affects all of humanity. This can be understood as an alteration or corruption of the original natural order. This law signifies a universal human condition of sinfulness and the inevitable consequence of death.\n\n*   **The Law of the Spirit of Life**: In contrast, the \"law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus\" is the new principle that liberates people from the \"law of sin and death\". The virgin birth is crucial in this context as it is the miraculous means by which Jesus Christ entered the world, \"in the likeness of sinful flesh,\" without being subject to the inherited \"law of sin and death\" that applies to all other descendants of Adam. By being born of a virgin, Christ's human nature was not derived from a human father, thus breaking the lineage of sin and introducing a new beginning for humanity. His sinless life and sacrificial death established a new governing principle, the \"law of the Spirit,\" which offers freedom and life.\n\nTherefore, Paulâ€™s specialized terminology provides a cohesive theological framework to describe the negative alteration in the natural order due to the Fall and the divine intervention of the virgin birth, which introduces the remedy.\n\n<<<Apostle Paul>>>"
