    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ (in radians) for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given by:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{4\\left(1 - x_4\\right)\\left(3x_4^2 - 1\\right)^2}{3\\left(3 - x_4\\right)\\left(3x_4 - 1\\right)^2} + 1}\\right)$\nwhere $x_4$ is the largest root in the interval [-1, 1] of the polynomial $R_4(x) = (24 - 104x + 93x^2)(1-x) - 4$.\n\nThe exact value of this root is:\n$x_4 = \\frac{93 - \\sqrt{2033}}{124}$\n\nThis result was established by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis and later simplified by Gander and Wanner. The numerical approximation for this angle is $\\alpha \\approx 73.35^\\circ$.\n\nWhile the expression for $\\tan(\\alpha)$ can be written out as a single complex fraction involving $\\sqrt{2033}$, the form presented above is derived directly from the primary research and is less prone to transcription errors from poorly rendered snippets.\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{4\\left(1 - \\frac{93 - \\sqrt{2033}}{124}\\right)\\left(3\\left(\\frac{93 - \\sqrt{2033}}{124}\\right)^2 - 1\\right)^2}{3\\left(3 - \\frac{93 - \\sqrt{2033}}{124}\\right)\\left(3\\left(\\frac{93 - \\sqrt{2033}}{124}\\right) - 1\\right)^2} + 1}\\right)$>>>"
