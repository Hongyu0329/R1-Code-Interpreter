The force of attraction between the polymer ends is given by the law: $F(x) = -\frac{2 E(0) x}{n^2 \ell^2} \exp\left(\frac{x^2}{n^2 \ell^2}\right)$, where $x$ is the separation of the ends, $n$ is the number of mass points, $\ell$ is the length of the struts, and $E(0)$ is the kinetic energy of the polymer at zero extension.
