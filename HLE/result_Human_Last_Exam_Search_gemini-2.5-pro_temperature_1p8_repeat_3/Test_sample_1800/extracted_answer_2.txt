The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is approximately 7 molar percent for the Water Gas Shift reaction, while for water splitting, optimal ratios have been reported as 3Ni/1Ce in computational studies, a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and between Ni75Ce25Ox and Ni50Ce50Ox for the oxygen evolution reaction.
