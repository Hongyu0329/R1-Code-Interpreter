    "A self-avoiding walk on a lattice is a path that does not visit the same point more than once. The \"Manhattan lattice\" refers to a square grid, where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical steps, resembling the layout of streets in Manhattan. The number of n-step self-avoiding walks is denoted by a(n).\n\nThe calculation of a(n) is a complex combinatorial problem, and there is no known simple formula. However, the values have been computed for a significant number of steps. The sequence of these numbers is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the identifier A001411.\n\nBased on these enumerations, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, a(10), is 44,100.\n\nThe initial terms of the sequence a(n) are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\n<<<44100>>>"
