    "A reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is necessarily split. This is because the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group, which means the Galois group Gal$(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}/\\mathbb{F}_q)$ must act trivially on the diagram.\n\nFor a split reductive group over a finite field, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori, up to conjugation by elements of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group $W$. In this case, the Weyl group is of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe problem is therefore reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. According to the work of R. Carter, who classified the conjugacy classes of exceptional Weyl groups, the number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\nTherefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
