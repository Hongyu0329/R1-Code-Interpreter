    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers.\n\n*   **VIII** is 8.\n*   **CCC** is 300, as 'C' represents 100 and it is repeated three times (100 + 100 + 100).\n*   **MMMDCCLXXVII** is 3777. This is broken down as M(1000) + M(1000) + M(1000) + D(500) + C(100) + C(100) + L(50) + X(10) + X(10) + V(5) + I(1) + I(1).\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation:\n8 / 300 - 3777\n\nFinally, perform the calculation:\n8 divided by 300 is approximately 0.02666...\n0.02666... minus 3777 equals -3776.97333...\n\nRounding to four decimal places, the solution is -3776.9733.\n\n<<<-3776.9733>>>"
