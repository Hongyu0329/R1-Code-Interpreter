    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X × Y × Z → X, G:Y × Z × X → Y, and H:Z × X × Y → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, z, x) = y\n*   H(z, x, y) = z\n\nThe existence of such a point is typically guaranteed under specific conditions on the functions and the underlying spaces, which are usually complete partially ordered metric spaces. These conditions are established in the field of fixed-point theory, particularly as extensions of the well-known Banach Contraction Principle. The concept of an FGH-tripled fixed point is a generalization of a tripled fixed point and an extension of an FG-coupled fixed point.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\n### 1. Setting: Partially Ordered Metric Spaces\n\nThe spaces (X, ≤<sub>X</sub>), (Y, ≤<sub>Y</sub>), and (Z, ≤<sub>Z</sub>) are partially ordered sets, and (X, d<sub>X</sub>), (Y, d<sub>Y</sub>), and (Z, d<sub>Z</sub>) are complete metric spaces. The overall space for the tripled fixed point is the product space X × Y × Z.\n\n### 2. Mixed Monotone Property\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property. This property defines how the functions behave with respect to the partial orders on the spaces. A common definition of this property for F, G, and H is:\n\n*   **F(x, y, z)** is non-decreasing in x and non-increasing in y and z.\n*   **G(y, z, x)** is non-decreasing in y and non-increasing in z and x.\n*   **H(z, x, y)** is non-decreasing in z and non-increasing in x and y.\n\nThis means for any x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub> ∈ X, y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> ∈ Y, z<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub> ∈ Z:\nif x<sub>1</sub> ≤<sub>X</sub> x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>1</sub> ≥<sub>Y</sub> y<sub>2</sub>, and z<sub>1</sub> ≤<sub>Z</sub> z<sub>2</sub>, then:\n*   F(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>) ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>)\n*   G(y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>) ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>)\n*   H(z<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(z<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)\n\n### 3. Contractive Condition\n\nThe functions must satisfy a contraction-type condition. This is crucial for proving the convergence of sequences generated by iterating the functions. A typical contractive condition would be:\n\nFor all x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub> ∈ X, y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> ∈ Y, z<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub> ∈ Z with x<sub>1</sub> ≤<sub>X</sub> x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>1</sub> ≥<sub>Y</sub> y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>1</sub> ≤<sub>Z</sub> z<sub>2</sub>, there exist constants k<sub>i</sub>, l<sub>i</sub>, m<sub>i</sub> ∈ [0, 1) such that:\n\nd<sub>X</sub>(F(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>), F(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>)) ≤ k<sub>1</sub> d<sub>X</sub>(x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>) + k<sub>2</sub> d<sub>Y</sub>(y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) + k<sub>3</sub> d<sub>Z</sub>(z<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>)\nd<sub>Y</sub>(G(y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>), G(y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>)) ≤ l<sub>1</sub> d<sub>Y</sub>(y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) + l<sub>2</sub> d<sub>Z</sub>(z<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>) + l<sub>3</sub> d<sub>X</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>)\nd<sub>Z</sub>(H(z<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>), H(z<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)) ≤ m<sub>1</sub> d<sub>Z</sub>(z<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>) + m<sub>2</sub> d<sub>X</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>) + m<sub>3</sub> d<sub>Y</sub>(y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)\n\nwhere the sum of the constants (k<sub>1</sub>+k<sub>2</sub>+k<sub>3</sub> + l<sub>1</sub>+l<sub>2</sub>+l<sub>3</sub> + m<sub>1</sub>+m<sub>2</sub>+m<sub>3</sub>) is less than 1. This condition ensures that the mapping defined on the product space is a contraction, which leads to the existence of a unique fixed point.\n\n### 4. Existence of an Initial Point\n\nThere must exist an initial point (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies the following ordering:\n\n*   x<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>)\n*   y<sub>0</sub> ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>)\n*   z<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(z<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>)\n\nThis condition is necessary to start an iterative process that generates convergent sequences.\n\n### 5. Continuity or an Alternative Condition\n\nEither the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the partial orders and the spaces have a property that ensures convergence. For example, if any non-decreasing sequence {x<sub>n</sub>} in X has a limit, that limit must be the least upper bound of the sequence. If this property holds, the continuity of the functions may not be strictly necessary for the existence of the fixed point, though it is often assumed for uniqueness proofs.\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is typically guaranteed by the combination of a complete partially ordered metric space structure, a mixed monotone property of the functions, a contractive condition on the metric, the existence of a suitable starting point, and often the continuity of the functions. These conditions are fundamental in the modern development of fixed-point theory and its applications.An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X × Y × Z → X, G:Y × Z × X → Y, and H:Z × X × Y → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, z, x) = y\n*   H(z, x, y) = z\n\nThe existence of such a point is typically guaranteed under specific conditions on the functions and the underlying spaces, which are usually complete partially ordered metric spaces.
