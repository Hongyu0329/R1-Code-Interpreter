    "<<<\nIn Feynman's path integral formalism, the partition function Z for a system of fermions at a finite temperature T is calculated in the imaginary time representation. This involves a \"Wick rotation\" from real time *t* to imaginary time τ = *it*. The formula for the fermionic partition function is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields.\n\nThe fundamental components of the formula are:\n\n1.  **Grassmann Variables**: To correctly represent the anti-commuting nature of fermions and the Pauli exclusion principle within the path integral framework, the fermionic fields are not ordinary numbers but are represented by Grassmann variables (or anti-commuting numbers). Any two Grassmann variables, say ψ and η, anti-commute: ψ·η = -η·ψ, which implies that ψ² = 0.\n2.  **Imaginary Time**: The calculation is performed in Euclidean spacetime by substituting real time *t* with imaginary time τ via τ = *it*. The time evolution operator e⁻¹̇ᴴ in quantum mechanics becomes the statistical operator e⁻ᴴτ.\n3.  **Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions**: A key feature of the fermionic partition function in imaginary time is the imposition of anti-periodic boundary conditions on the fermion fields ψ(τ). To correctly calculate the trace of the density matrix (Tr(e⁻ᵇᴴ)), the Grassmann fields must be anti-periodic over the interval [0, β], where β = 1/(k₈T) is the inverse temperature (with k₈ being the Boltzmann constant). This condition is expressed as:\n    ψ(τ + β) = -ψ(τ)  and  ψ̄(τ + β) = -ψ̄(τ).\n\nTaking these elements into account, the formula for the fermionic partition function Z is:\n\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])**\n\nwhere:\n\n*   **Z** is the partition function.\n*   **ψ(τ, x)** and **ψ̄(τ, x)** are the Grassmann-valued fermionic fields.\n*   **D[ψ̄] D[ψ]** represents the functional integration measure over all possible configurations of the anti-periodic Grassmann fields.\n*   **S_E[ψ̄, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the system. It is obtained from the classical action by the Wick rotation to imaginary time. For a typical theory with a Hamiltonian density ℋ, the Euclidean action is:\n    **S_E = ∫₀ᵇ dτ ∫ d³x 𝓛_E**\n    where 𝓛_E is the Euclidean Lagrangian density. A common form for this is:\n    **𝓛_E = ψ̄(τ, x) (∂_τ + ℋ) ψ(τ, x)**\n\nFor many systems, the action is bilinear in the fermionic fields, allowing the integral to be performed formally. For a system with an action of the form S_E = ∫ dτ dτ' ψ̄(τ) M ψ(τ'), the partition function is given by the functional determinant of the operator M:\n**Z = det(M)**\n\nThis determinant is evaluated over the space of functions that satisfy the anti-periodic boundary conditions, leading to sums over discrete fermionic Matsubara frequencies, ωₙ = (2n + 1)π/β, which arise directly from these boundary conditions.>>>"
