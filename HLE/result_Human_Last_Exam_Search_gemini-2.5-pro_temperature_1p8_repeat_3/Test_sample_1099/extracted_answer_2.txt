To simulate the correlations from Positive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) measurements on a singlet state, a local hidden variable model requires, on average, a minimum of resources that depend on the specific measurements. For the general case of any POVM, **two bits of classical communication** are sufficient. Alternatively, for the subset of projective measurements, **one bit of classical communication** or **one non-signaling PR-box** is sufficient. A precise, universally applicable trade-off between communication and PR-boxes for all POVMs is not yet firmly established and is a subject of ongoing research.
