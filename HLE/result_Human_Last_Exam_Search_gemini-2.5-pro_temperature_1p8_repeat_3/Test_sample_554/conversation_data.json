    "Hypothetically, a perfluoronanocar would be a nanocar molecule where all the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by fluorine atoms. The term \"perfluorinated\" signifies the substitution of all hydrogen atoms with fluorine. Nanocars are complex molecules designed to function as molecular machines, resembling a car with a chassis and wheels that can move across a surface.\n\nSeveral designs for nanocars exist. One of the earliest, developed at Rice University in 2005, features an H-shaped chassis and fullerene wheels. For one specific nanocar structure, a chemical formula of C430H274O12 is provided.\n\nIf this particular nanocar were to be perfluorinated, all of its 274 hydrogen atoms would be replaced with fluorine atoms. Therefore, this hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms. It's important to note that different nanocar designs exist with varying numbers of atoms. For instance, another model has the chemical formula C85H59N5Zn. A perfluorinated version of this nanocar would contain 59 fluorine atoms.\n\nBased on the more complex nanocar structure with the published formula C430H274O12, the number of fluorine atoms is determined by the number of hydrogen atoms available for substitution.\n\n<<<274>>>"
