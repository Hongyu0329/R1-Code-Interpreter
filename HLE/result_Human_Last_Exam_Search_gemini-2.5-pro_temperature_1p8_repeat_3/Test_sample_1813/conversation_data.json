    "The generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is an integer that is part of a solution to the Markov Diophantine equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\). These numbers can be indexed by rational numbers \\( p/q \\) in the interval by relating the structure of the Stern-Brocot tree to the tree of Markov triples.\n\nTo compute the specific number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first determine the path to the rational number 4/7 in the Stern-Brocot tree. The tree starts with the fractions 0/1 and 1/1.\n\n1.  The mediant of 0/1 and 1/1 is 1/2. Since \\(4/7 \\approx 0.5714 > 0.5\\), we move to the right, into the interval (1/2, 1/1). The path begins with 'R'.\n2.  The mediant of 1/2 and 1/1 is 2/3. Since \\(4/7 < 2/3 \\approx 0.6667\\), we move to the left. The path is now 'RL', and the new interval is (1/2, 2/3).\n3.  The mediant of 1/2 and 2/3 is 3/5. Since \\(4/7 < 3/5 = 0.6\\), we move to the left again. The path is 'RLL', and the interval is (1/2, 3/5).\n4.  The mediant of 1/2 and 3/5 is \\((1+3)/(2+5) = 4/7\\). We have found the rational number.\n\nThe path from the root of the tree to 4/7 is thus RLL. We can now trace this path on the Markov tree of integer solutions. The Markov triples are generated starting from the fundamental solution (1, 1, 1). The first non-singular triple, which serves as the root for many representations of the tree, is (1, 2, 5). The children of a triple (x, y, z) with x < y < z are generated by the formulas:\n*   Left child: (x, z, 3xz - y)\n*   Right child: (y, z, 3yz - x)\n\nLet's trace the path RLL starting from the triple (1, 2, 5), which is associated with the fraction 1/2.\n*   **Path R:** We take the right child of (1, 2, 5). Here, x=1, y=2, z=5. The new triple is (2, 5, 3*2*5 - 1) = (2, 5, 29). This corresponds to the rational 2/3. The largest number in this triple is 29, so \\( m_{2/3} = 29 \\).\n*   **Path RL:** We are at the triple (2, 5, 29). We take its left child. Here x=2, y=5, z=29. The new triple is (2, 29, 3*2*29 - 5) = (2, 29, 169). This corresponds to the rational 3/5. The largest number is 169, so \\( m_{3/5} = 169 \\).\n*   **Path RLL:** We are at the triple (2, 29, 169). We take its left child. Here x=2, y=29, z=169. The new triple is (2, 169, 3*2*169 - 29) = (2, 169, 1014 - 29) = (2, 169, 985). This corresponds to our target rational 4/7. The largest number in this triple is 985.\n\nThus, the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is 985.\n\nThe continued fraction of an integer \\( n \\) is simply \\( [n] \\). Therefore, the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} = 985 \\) is.\n\n"
