    "Let $X$ be a finite ultrametric space and $B$ a Banach space. We are looking for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$. An isometric embedding is a function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x, y \\in X$, the equality $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d(x, y)$ holds, where $d$ is the metric on $X$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_B$ is the norm on $B$.\n\nThe number of isometric embeddings depends on the specific choice of the space $X$ and the Banach space $B$. We want to find if there is a pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of embeddings is minimal. Since the number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer, the lowest possible value is 0.\n\nLet's consider if it's possible to have zero isometric embeddings. This would occur if there exists a specific finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ such that no function $f: X \\to B$ satisfies the condition for an isometric embedding.\n\nConsider the finite ultrametric space $X = \\{a, b, c\\}$ with the metric defined by $d(a, b) = 1$, $d(b, c) = 1$, and $d(a, c) = 1$. This space is ultrametric because for any three distinct points $x, y, z \\in X$, the ultrametric inequality $d(x, z) \\le \\max\\{d(x, y), d(y, z)\\}$ holds, as $1 \\le \\max\\{1, 1\\}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the Banach space $B = \\mathbb{R}$, the set of real numbers with the standard absolute value as the norm. An isometric embedding would be a function $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that maps the points $a, b, c$ to three real numbers $p, q, r$ such that:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $|p - q| = d(a, b) = 1$\n    \\item $|q - r| = d(b, c) = 1$\n    \\item $|p - r| = d(a, c) = 1$\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's place $p$ at the origin, so $p=0$.\nFrom $|p - q| = 1$, we have $|0 - q| = 1$, which implies $q = 1$ or $q = -1$.\n\nCase 1: $q = 1$.\nNow we use the other two conditions:\n$|1 - r| = 1$, which means $1 - r = 1$ or $1 - r = -1$. This gives $r = 0$ or $r = 2$.\nHowever, we must also satisfy $|p - r| = 1$, which is $|0 - r| = 1$.\nIf $r=0$, then $|0 - 0| = 0 \\neq 1$.\nIf $r=2$, then $|0 - 2| = 2 \\neq 1$.\nNeither value of $r$ works.\n\nCase 2: $q = -1$.\nThe conditions become:\n$|-1 - r| = 1$, which means $-1 - r = 1$ or $-1 - r = -1$. This gives $r = -2$ or $r = 0$.\nAgain, we must also satisfy $|p - r| = 1$, i.e., $|0 - r| = 1$.\nIf $r=-2$, then $|0 - (-2)| = 2 \\neq 1$.\nIf $r=0$, then $|0 - 0| = 0 \\neq 1$.\nAgain, neither value of $r$ is valid.\n\nSince in all cases we reach a contradiction, there are no three points in $\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the required distance conditions. Therefore, there are no isometric embeddings of this particular finite ultrametric space $X$ into the Banach space $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis demonstrates that it is possible for the number of isometric embeddings to be 0. As the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
