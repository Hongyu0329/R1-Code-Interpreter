    "A finite group contains a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 if it is one of a specific list of six non-isomorphic groups. This classification was established by G. L. Walls in a 2007 paper.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for any two elements *x* and *y* in *S* (including the case where *x* = *y*), their product *xy* is not an element of *S*. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe six finite groups that satisfy the condition of having a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are:\n*   The cyclic group of order 4 (C₄)\n*   The cyclic group of order 5 (C₅)\n*   The Klein four-group (V₄ or C₂ × C₂)\n*   The symmetric group of order 6 (S₃)\n*   The dihedral group of order 10 (D₅ or D₁₀)\n*   The non-abelian group of order 21\n\nTherefore, there are a total of six such finite groups.\n\n<<<6>>>"
