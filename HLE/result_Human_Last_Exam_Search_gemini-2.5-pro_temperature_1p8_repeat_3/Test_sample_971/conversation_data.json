    "While Natalia Osipova's 2008 performance as Kitri in the Bolshoi Ballet's *Don Quixote* is renowned for its technical brilliance and high energy, a precise count of the single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position in the Act I variation cannot be definitively determined from available video footage.\n\nVideos of the 2008 performance, including one of her guesting in Novosibirsk, Siberia, showcase Osipova's remarkable talent. The Act I variation is characterized by a series of rapid and complex turning sequences. However, the quality of the recordings and the speed of the execution make it impossible to ascertain with certainty whether each pirouette commences from a clean fifth position as per the specific query.\n\nThe choreography for Kitri's variations in *Don Quixote* is known for its virtuosic and athletic demands, including impressive leaps and fast turns. Dancers often bring their own unique flair and interpretation to the role, which can result in slight variations in the choreography from one performance to another.\n\nReviews of Osipova's performances as Kitri frequently praise her powerful jumps and dizzying pirouettes. However, these descriptions are general and do not provide a detailed technical breakdown of the number and type of turns performed.\n\nTherefore, while Osipova's performance undoubtedly included numerous pirouettes, a verifiable and exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position in her 2008 Act I variation remains elusive based on the available visual evidence.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a definitive number based on the available video footage.>>>"
