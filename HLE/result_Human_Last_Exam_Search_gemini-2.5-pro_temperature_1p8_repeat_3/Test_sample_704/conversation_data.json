    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself, is **G**.\n\nWhen the primary colors yellow and blue are mixed, the resulting color is green. Isaac Newton, in his work \"Opticks,\" famously created a color wheel where he associated the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the notes of a musical scale.\n\nNewton's color circle maps the seven colors—Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet—to the notes of a Dorian musical mode starting on the note D. In this specific arrangement:\n*   Red corresponds to D\n*   Orange corresponds to E\n*   Yellow corresponds to F\n*   **Green corresponds to G**\n*   **Blue corresponds to A**\n*   Indigo corresponds to B\n*   Violet corresponds to a note that leads back to the octave of D\n\nThe color produced by mixing yellow and blue is green, which is associated with the musical note G. The color blue is associated with the musical note A. Therefore, the musical note representing the beginning of the range between green and blue on Newton's color circle is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
