Yes, it can be considered a stabilizer code. The stabilizer generators $Z_1 Z_2$, $Z_2 Z_3$, and $Z_3 Z_4$ all commute with each other. Furthermore, the logical basis states $|0_L\rangle = |0000\rangle$ and $|1_L\rangle = |1111\rangle$ are both +1-eigenstates of all three stabilizer generators, which means the code space is stabilized by this set of operators.
