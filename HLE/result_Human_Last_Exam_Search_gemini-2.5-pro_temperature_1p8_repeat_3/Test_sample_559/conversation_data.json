    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that divides it into regions of different long-term behavior; these are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1 - u(t))$\n$u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u^2(t)$\n\n**1. Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points are found by setting both derivatives to zero:\n*   $u'(t) = (u - 1)u^2 = 0$, which gives $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n*   If $u = 0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, so $d = 0$. This gives the equilibrium point (0, 0).\n*   If $u = 1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (-3 + 5)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d(d + 1) = 0$. This gives $d = 0$ or $d = -1$. This gives the equilibrium points (1, 0) and (1, -1).\n\nSo, the three equilibrium points are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):** The Jacobian is $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are 1 and 2, which are both positive. Thus, (1, 0) is an unstable node (a source).\n*   **At (1, -1):** The Jacobian is $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are 1 and -2. Since one is positive and one is negative, (1, -1) is a saddle point.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (1, -1). A trajectory that connects two different equilibrium points is known as a heteroclinic orbit.\n\nWe look for an invariant manifold, which is a curve that is composed of trajectories of the system. Let's test if a curve of the form $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold. If a trajectory lies on this curve, then $d(t) = -[u(t)]^2$. Differentiating with respect to $t$ gives:\n$\\frac{dd}{dt} = -2u \\frac{du}{dt} = -2u(u-1)u^2 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nNow, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the original equation for $d'(t)$:\n$d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$d'(t) = 2u^4 - 3u^3 + 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$d'(t) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nSince both expressions for $d'(t)$ are identical, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold of the system. This curve passes through the saddle point (1, -1) since $-1 = -(1)^2$, and it also passes through the equilibrium point (0, 0).\n\nThe tangent to the unstable manifold at the saddle point (1, -1) is given by the eigenvector corresponding to the positive eigenvalue ($\\lambda = 1$). The eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The slope of the tangent is -2. The slope of the curve $d = -u^2$ at $u = 1$ is given by $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$, which at $u=1$ is -2. This confirms that the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n\nThis invariant manifold connects the saddle point (1, -1) to the equilibrium point (0, 0) and is a separatrix for the system.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
