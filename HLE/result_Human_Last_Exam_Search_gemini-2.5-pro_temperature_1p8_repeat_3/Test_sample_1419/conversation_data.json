    "### Leading Order Expression for the Fixed-Point Coupling in ϕ⁴ Theory\n\nIn the vicinity of four dimensions, the ϕ⁴ theory possesses a non-trivial fixed point known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. The leading order expression for this fixed-point coupling, denoted as u*, can be determined through the epsilon expansion, where ϵ = 4 - d is a small parameter representing the deviation from four spatial dimensions.\n\nThe renormalization group (RG) beta function, which describes the running of the coupling constant 'u' with the energy scale, is crucial for finding the fixed point. At the fixed point, the beta function is zero, signifying that the coupling constant no longer changes with the energy scale.\n\nFor the single-component ϕ⁴ theory in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the coupling constant 'u' is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + Bu²\n\nwhere B is a positive constant that arises from the loop calculations. The first term, -ϵu, comes from the classical scaling of the coupling, while the second term, Bu², is the one-loop quantum correction.\n\nA fixed point, u*, is found by setting the beta function to zero:\n\nβ(u*) = -ϵu* + B(u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions: the trivial Gaussian fixed point at u* = 0, and the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point. For the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, we have:\n\nu* = ϵ / B\n\nThe precise value of the constant B depends on the specific conventions used for the definition of the coupling constant and the regularization scheme. A common result in many quantum field theory textbooks, using a particular normalization, gives the beta function for the coupling λ as:\nβ(λ) = -ϵλ + (3 / (16π²))λ²\n\nSetting this to zero yields the fixed point coupling:\nλ* = (16π² / 3)ϵ\n\nAnother common convention for an O(N) symmetric model, which for a single scalar field corresponds to N=1, gives the fixed point as λ* = 8π²ϵ / (N+8), which for N=1 becomes:\nλ* = 8π²ϵ / 9\n\nThe key result is that the fixed point coupling is directly proportional to ϵ at the leading order. Different normalizations of the coupling constant only change the proportionality constant.\n\n<<<u* = (16π²/3)ε>>>"
