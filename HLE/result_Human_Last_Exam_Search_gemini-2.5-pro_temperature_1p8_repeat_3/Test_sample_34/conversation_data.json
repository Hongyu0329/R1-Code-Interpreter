    "According to a baseline recommendation for a nine-handed cash game with 100bb, the button opening range includes suited jacks down to J6s. This implies that J6s is the weakest suited jack that should be opened from this position. Another source analyzing a similar scenario shows a button opening range that includes hands like 85 suited and suggests that J9s is a standard open. While ranges can vary based on the specific game dynamics and opponent tendencies, J6s is identified as a viable, albeit marginal, open.\n\nTherefore, the worst suited jack you should open from the button to 2.5x in a 100BB rake-free cash game is J6s.\n\n<<<J6s>>>"
