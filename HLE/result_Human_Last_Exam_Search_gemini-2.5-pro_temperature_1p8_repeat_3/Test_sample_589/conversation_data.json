    "The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car is the 1997 film *Gummo*.\n\nThe film, directed by Harmony Korine, features a character known as \"Bunny Boy,\" a teenager who is often seen wearing pink bunny ears. There are several scenes involving teenagers riding bicycles in the movie, and while a precise textual description of the character on a pink bike pedaling into oncoming traffic is not available, the film's overall transgressive and chaotic imagery strongly aligns with such a scene.\n\n*Gummo* was distributed by Fine Line Features, which at the time of the film's release was a specialty division of New Line Cinema, a major film studio.\n\n<<<Gummo>>>"
