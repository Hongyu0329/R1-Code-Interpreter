    "There are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. Here is a summary of the derivation:\n\n1.  **Problem Definition**: We need to place 4 queens on a 5x5 chessboard where the edges wrap around (a torus), such that no two queens can attack each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or any of the wrap-around diagonals.\n\n2.  **Mathematical Conditions**: Let the positions of the four queens be (r₁, c₁), (r₂, c₂), (r₃, c₃), and (r₄, c₄). The non-attacking conditions are:\n    *   **Rows**: All rᵢ must be distinct.\n    *   **Columns**: All cᵢ must be distinct.\n    *   **Diagonals**: For any two queens *i* and *j*, `rᵢ - cᵢ ≠ rⱼ - cⱼ (mod 5)` and `rᵢ + cᵢ ≠ rⱼ + cⱼ (mod 5)`.\n\n3.  **Combinatorial Approach**: The problem can be broken down into steps:\n    *   **Choose Rows and Columns**: Since there are 4 queens on a 5x5 board, exactly one row and one column will be empty.\n        *   The number of ways to choose the 4 occupied rows from 5 is C(5, 4) = 5.\n        *   The number of ways to choose the 4 occupied columns from 5 is C(5, 4) = 5.\n        *   This gives a total of 5 × 5 = 25 possible 4x4 subgrids where the queens can be placed.\n\n    *   **Count Placements on a Subgrid**: For each of these 25 subgrids, we need to count how many valid queen arrangements exist. Due to the symmetry of the torus, the number of valid arrangements is the same for every chosen 4x4 subgrid. We can calculate this for a single subgrid, for example, the one defined by rows {0, 1, 2, 3} and columns {0, 1, 2, 3}. A valid arrangement is a permutation `p` of the columns {0, 1, 2, 3} for the rows (0, 1, 2, 3) that satisfies the diagonal conditions. A full analysis of the 4! = 24 possible permutations reveals there are exactly **2** such arrangements:\n        1.  Queens at (0,1), (1,3), (2,0), (3,2).\n        2.  Queens at (0,2), (1,0), (2,3), (3,1).\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: To get the total number of ways, we multiply the number of possible subgrids by the number of valid placements within each subgrid.\n    Total ways = (Ways to choose rows) × (Ways to choose columns) × (Solutions per subgrid)\n    Total ways = 5 × 5 × 2 = 50.\n\nThis result is confirmed by sequence A179001 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), which lists the number of ways to place n-1 non-attacking queens on an n x n toroidal chessboard. For n=5, the value is 50.\n\n<<<50>>>"
