    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy system is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing level of the rule's antecedent and the membership degree of the consequent. The antecedent's firing level, `Φ_k(x′)`, is given as 0.7, and the consequent's membership degree, `μG_k_j(y_j)`, is given as 0.9.\n\nA t-norm (triangular norm) is a function that models the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. The choice of a specific t-norm is a design parameter of the fuzzy system. The most commonly used t-norms are the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\nThe calculation for the rule activation level is:\n`Activation Level = t-norm(Φ_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n`Activation Level = t-norm(0.7, 0.9)`\n\nHere are the results based on the most common t-norm operations:\n\n*   **Using the Minimum t-norm (Mamdani inference):** This is the most common t-norm.\n    `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n*   **Using the Product t-norm (Larsen inference):** This is another widely used t-norm.\n    `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\n*   **Using the Lukasiewicz t-norm:**\n    `max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6`\n\nWithout a specified t-norm, the rule activation level depends on the type of fuzzy inference system being used. However, if a single answer is expected, the minimum t-norm is the most frequent choice in fuzzy logic applications.\n\n<<<Using the most common t-norm (minimum), the rule activation level is 0.7. Using the product t-norm, the level is 0.63.>>>"
