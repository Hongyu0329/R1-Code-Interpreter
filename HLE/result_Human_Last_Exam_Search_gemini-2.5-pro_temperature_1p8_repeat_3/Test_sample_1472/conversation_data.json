    "The symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom. The molecule exists in both copper(I) and copper(II) forms, each with a different molecular geometry and corresponding point group.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I):**\nThe bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation, [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂]⁺, has a tetrahedral coordination geometry around the copper atom. This complex possesses an S₄ point group symmetry. This has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography and is used as a prominent example of S₄ symmetry in educational resources. The structure features a four-fold improper rotation axis (S₄), which involves a 90-degree rotation followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to the axis.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II):**\nThe bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex, [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂]²⁺, exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry. In the solid state, crystallographic studies have shown that the molecule crystallizes in the monoclinic space group *P*2₁/*c* with two formula units per unit cell (Z=2). This arrangement places the copper atom at a crystallographic inversion center, which means the molecule itself possesses an inversion center. Therefore, the point group of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) molecule in the crystal is Cᵢ. The coordination environment consists of four sulfur atoms from the two dithiahexane ligands in the equatorial plane and two counter-ions (such as fluoride from tetrafluoroborate) in the axial positions, with the axial bonds being elongated.\n\nIn summary:\n*   **Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) has an S₄ point group.**\n*   **Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) has a Cᵢ point group in the crystalline state.**\n\n<<<The symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper is S₄ for the copper(I) complex and Cᵢ for the copper(II) complex in the solid state.>>>"
