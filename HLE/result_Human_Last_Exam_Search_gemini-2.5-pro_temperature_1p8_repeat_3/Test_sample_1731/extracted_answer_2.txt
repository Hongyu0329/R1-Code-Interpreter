**Equilibrium Entropy (S):** The equilibrium entropy is the maximum possible entropy for a photon gas, which follows the Bose-Einstein distribution with zero chemical potential. It is given by `S = (4/3) * a * V * T^3`, where `a` is the radiation constant, `V` is the volume, and `T` is the temperature. The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem provides the formal justification that the equilibrium state corresponds to the one of maximum entropy because it is the most probable distribution.

**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):** The equilibrium mean energy is the expected energy for this maximum entropy state, given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `U = a * V * T^4`. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem explains that any deviation from this mean energy is exponentially unlikely, making this the stable equilibrium value.
