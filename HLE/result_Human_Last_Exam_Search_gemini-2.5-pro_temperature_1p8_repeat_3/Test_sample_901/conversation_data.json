    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. In this specific case, the stereochemistry of the starting material dictates the major product.\n\nThe substrate, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, has a *trans* relationship between the bromo and methyl groups. For the E2 reaction to occur, the leaving group (bromine) and a beta-hydrogen must be in an anti-periplanar (diaxial) arrangement. This requires the cyclohexane ring to adopt a chair conformation where the bromine is in an axial position.\n\nIn the conformer where bromine is axial, the methyl group is also forced into an axial position, which is less stable. Critically, the beta-hydrogen on the same carbon as the methyl group (C2) is in an equatorial position and therefore cannot be eliminated.\n\nThe only available beta-hydrogen in an anti-periplanar (axial) position is on carbon 6 (C6). The bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, abstracts this specific hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\nTherefore, the major product of the reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene. This outcome is a result of stereoelectronic control, where the required geometry for the E2 mechanism overrides Zaitsev's rule, which would have predicted the more substituted alkene, 1-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
