    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factor the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n$d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\n### 2. Understand Dirichlet Characters and Primitivity\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3,$ and $\\chi_4$ are characters modulo $7, 13, 19,$ and $31$, respectively.\n\nFor the character $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $d$, each of the component characters $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character modulo its respective prime. Since the moduli are prime, any non-principal character is primitive. The principal character is not primitive.\n\n### 3. Determine the Order of the Characters\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\nWe require this order to be 6.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Group Structure\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of integers modulo $p$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of a specific order $k$ is equal to the number of elements of order $k$ in this cyclic group.\n\nFor each prime factor of $d$:\n*   **Modulo 7:** The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$.\n*   **Modulo 13:** The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(13) = 12$.\n*   **Modulo 19:** The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(19) = 18$.\n*   **Modulo 31:** The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(31) = 30$.\n\nThe number of elements of order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ (if $k$ divides $n$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n\n### 5. Count the Characters of Relevant Orders\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each modulus whose orders can combine to give an lcm of 6. The orders of the component characters must be divisors of 6, i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 6. Also, at least one character must have order 3 and at least one must have order 2 or 6 to make the lcm equal to 6.\n\nFor each modulus, we count the number of primitive (non-principal) characters with orders dividing 1, 2, 3, or 6:\n*   **Modulo 7 (order 6):**\n    *   $\\phi(1) = 1$ (the principal character, not primitive)\n    *   $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $\\phi(6) = 2$\n*   **Modulo 13 (order 12):**\n    *   $\\phi(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $\\phi(6) = 2$\n*   **Modulo 19 (order 18):**\n    *   $\\phi(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $\\phi(6) = 2$\n*   **Modulo 31 (order 30):**\n    *   $\\phi(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\n### 6. Combine the Results\nLet $N_k(p)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p$ of order $k$.\nLet $S_k = \\{ \\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4) \\}$ where $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i$. We need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that $\\text{lcm}(S_k) = 6$.\n\nLet $C_k$ be the set of choices for the orders of the four primitive characters such that the lcm is $k$.\nWe calculate the number of combinations where the lcm of the orders is 6. This means the set of orders must contain an element divisible by 3 and an element divisible by 2.\n\n*   Let $A_6$ be the total number of tuples of primitive characters with orders dividing 6.\n    *   For each prime, there are $1+2+2 = 5$ choices (orders 2, 3, 6).\n    *   $|A_6| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 625$.\n*   Let $A_3$ be the number of tuples with orders dividing 3 (i.e., orders are 1 or 3). Since we require primitive characters, the order must be 3.\n    *   For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3.\n    *   $|A_3| = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n*   Let $A_2$ be the number of tuples with orders dividing 2 (i.e., orders are 1 or 2). Since we require primitive characters, the order must be 2.\n    *   For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2.\n    *   $|A_2| = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nThe number of characters of order 6 is the total number of characters with orders dividing 6, minus those whose orders strictly divide 6 (i.e., divide 2 or 3).\nNumber of characters = $|A_6| - |A_3| - |A_2| = 625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
