    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Ida** on the island of Crete, with an elevation of 2,456 meters (8,058 feet).\n\nSeveral mountains are referenced in the epic poem, but Mount Ida in Crete stands out as the highest among them, excluding Mount Olympus itself. In Greek mythology, this Mount Ida is sacred to the goddess Rhea and is known as the legendary birthplace of Zeus.\n\nAnother significant peak mentioned is Mount Ida in the Troad region of western Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), near the ancient city of Troy. From this mountain, the gods were said to have witnessed the Trojan War. Its highest peak, Gargarus, reaches an elevation of about 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n\nOther notable mountains in the *Iliad* include:\n*   **Mount Kyllini (or Cyllene)** in the Peloponnese, which rises to 2,376 meters (7,795 feet). It is famously associated with the birthplace of the god Hermes.\n*   **Mount Othrys** in central Greece, identified in mythology as the base of the Titans, has a highest summit of 1,726 meters (5,663 feet).\n*   **Mount Pelion** in Thessaly, the mythical home of the Centaurs, reaches 1,624 meters (5,328 feet).\n\nWhile other mountains like Neritum, Nysa, Placus, and Titanus are also mentioned, their precise historical locations and elevations are either not as clearly defined or not as high as Mount Ida in Crete.\n\n<<<Mount Ida on Crete>>>"
