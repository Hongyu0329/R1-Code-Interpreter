    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment with five fluorochromes (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750) that also involves streptavidin beads, preparing a comprehensive set of controls is essential for accurate data acquisition and sorting. The necessary controls are designed to address instrument setup (compensation), gating strategy, and potential artifacts from the reagents themselves.\n\nBased on best practices for multicolor flow cytometry, here is a breakdown of the essential controls you should prepare:\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1):** This sample contains only your cells or the particle of interest without any fluorescent labels. It is crucial for determining the baseline autofluorescence of your sample.\n*   **Beads-Only Control (1):** A sample containing just the streptavidin beads in buffer. This control is necessary to assess the intrinsic fluorescence of the beads and to ensure they do not generate unexpected signals in your detection channels.\n*   **Single-Stain Controls (5):** You need one individual control for each fluorochrome in your panel. These are absolutely critical for calculating spectral overlap (spillover) and setting up the compensation matrix. For optimal results, these controls should be as bright as or brighter than the signal in your experimental sample. You would have one sample for each of the following: AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5):** An FMO control contains all the fluorescent labels in your panel *except for one*. These controls are essential for accurately setting the positive gates for each marker. They account for the spectral spillover and spreading from all other fluorochromes into the channel of the missing one, preventing incorrect gating and sorting. For a five-color panel, you would prepare five different FMO controls.\n*   **Viability Dye Control (1):** To ensure you are sorting live cells, a viability dye is considered essential. Dead cells can bind antibodies and beads non-specifically, leading to false-positive results. A control sample (e.g., using heat-killed cells) is needed to correctly set the gate for discriminating between live and dead cells.\n\nSumming these up gives a total number of recommended controls:\n1 (Unstained) + 1 (Beads-Only) + 5 (Single-Stains) + 5 (FMOs) + 1 (Viability) = 13 essential controls.\n\n<<<13>>>"
