    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger topological system. The Chern number of this combined system is determined by the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional material characterized by a topological invariant known as the Chern number (C). This integer value is a fundamental property of the material's electronic band structure and is directly related to the quantized Hall conductance. The Chern number is a robust topological invariant, meaning it remains constant under continuous deformations of the system.\n\nFor composite topological systems, the Chern number is generally additive. Research on bilayer systems of Chern insulators shows that a total Chern number can be defined for the combined system. This principle of additivity is further supported by the fact that the Chern number of a system can be decomposed into a sum of subsystem winding numbers.\n\nA key feature of Chern insulators is the presence of chiral edge states, which are one-dimensional conducting channels at the boundary of the material. The number of these edge states is given by the absolute value of the Chern number. When two Chern insulators with different Chern numbers, C1 and C2, are brought into contact, the number of chiral modes at their interface is given by the difference |C1 - C2|.\n\nIn the scenario presented, we have two Chern insulators with C=1. Assuming they are oriented such that their chiral edge states propagate in the same direction (i.e., they have the same \"sign\" of the Chern number), the Chern number of the combined junction will be the sum of their individual Chern numbers. With a negligible tunneling barrier, the two insulators are strongly coupled, behaving as a unified system.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the junction is:\n\nC_total = C1 + C2 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nIf the two Chern insulators had opposite chirality (C1 = 1 and C2 = -1), their combined Chern number would be 0. However, the phrasing of the question, asking for \"the\" Chern number, suggests a scenario where the topological properties constructively interfere.\n\n<<<2>>>"
