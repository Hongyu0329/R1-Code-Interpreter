    "This problem asks for the values of the parameter λ for which the given Fredholm integral equation of the second kind has no solutions.\n\nThe equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n\nThe kernel of the integral equation, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, is a symmetric, degenerate kernel. It can be expressed as a finite sum:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`\n\nBecause the kernel is degenerate, the integral operator maps the space of polynomials of degree less than *n* to itself. This allows the problem to be reduced to a system of linear equations. Let's assume the solution `u(x)` can be written in the form:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ * P(x)`\nwhere `P(x)` is a polynomial of degree at most *n-1*. Substituting this into the equation and manipulating it leads to an operator equation for `P(x)`:\n`(I - λL)P = Q`\nwhere `L` is the integral operator with kernel `K(x, y)` and `Q(x) = L[1]`.\n\nA solution to this equation fails to exist if `λ` is the reciprocal of an eigenvalue `μ` of the operator `L` (`λ = 1/μ`), and the right-hand side `Q(x)` is not orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator `(I - λL)*`. Since the kernel is symmetric, `L` is self-adjoint, and the condition for no solution simplifies. A solution does not exist for `λ = 1/μ` if the corresponding eigenfunction `P_μ(x)` of `L` has a non-zero integral over the interval.\n\nIt can be shown that for the operator `L`, none of its eigenfunctions integrate to zero over. Therefore, the equation has no solution for all values of λ that are reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the operator L.\n\nThe problem then reduces to finding these eigenvalues. The operator `L`, when acting on the basis of monomials `{1, x, ..., xⁿ⁻¹}`, can be represented by an *n* x *n* matrix `A`. The eigenvalues `μ` of `L` are the eigenvalues of this matrix. The entries of this matrix, `A_ij`, are found by computing the action of `L` on each basis function. The resulting matrix `A` has entries:\n`A_ij = 1 / (n - i + j)`, for `i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nThis matrix is the product of the anti-diagonal identity matrix `J` and the `n` x `n` Hilbert matrix `H_n`. Finding the eigenvalues of this matrix for a general *n* in a simple closed form is a known difficult problem.\n\nHowever, we can solve for specific values of *n*:\n*   **Case n = 1:** The equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`. Solving this leads to the condition `λ = 1` for no solution.\n*   **Case n = 2:** The equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (x+y) u(y) dy`. Solving the corresponding 2x2 matrix eigenvalue problem gives `μ = 1/2 ± 1/√3`. The values of `λ = 1/μ` for which no solution exists are `λ = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\nWithout a general formula for the eigenvalues of the associated matrix for any *n*, we cannot provide a single neat expression for λ. The values for which no solution exists are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A` defined above.\n\nTherefore, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the *n* x *n* matrix `A` where `A_ij = 1 / (n - i + j)` for `i, j = 0, ..., n-1`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A whose elements are given by A_ij = 1/(n-i+j), for i,j = 0, 1, ..., n-1. For n=1, λ=1. For n=2, λ = -6 ± 4√3.>>>"
