    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function in the context of nuclear criticality is commonly referred to as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**.\n\nIn the field of nuclear reactor physics and criticality safety, the analysis of neutron population fluctuations, often called \"neutron noise,\" provides crucial information about the system's state. The correlation between neutron detection events is fundamental to this analysis and is mathematically described by the generalized pair correlation function. Two primary experimental techniques are used to measure these correlations in the time domain:\n\n*   **Rossi-alpha method:** This technique measures the time correlation between pairs of neutron counts to determine the prompt neutron decay constant, Î±. The output of a Rossi-alpha measurement is essentially a histogram of the time differences between neutron detections, which is directly related to the pair correlation function.\n*   **Feynman-alpha method:** This method determines the variance-to-mean ratio of the neutron counts in a specified time interval, which can be theoretically derived from the Rossi-alpha formulation.\n\nThe Power Spectral Density (PSD) is the frequency domain representation of these time correlations. Specifically, the Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD) is the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function (measured by a single detector, as in the Rossi-alpha method). When correlations between two different detectors are considered, the Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD) is used, which is the Fourier transform of the cross-correlation function.\n\nWhile the term \"dynamic structure factor\" also represents a space-time Fourier transform of the pair correlation function, especially in the broader field of neutron scattering, the term \"Power Spectral Density\" is more prevalently used within the nuclear criticality and reactor noise analysis community when referring to the temporal Fourier transform of the neutron signal's correlation function. The analysis of the PSD of neutron fluctuations is a standard technique for monitoring reactor subcriticality and diagnosing mechanical or thermal-hydraulic anomalies.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density>>>"
