    "**An American in Paris (1951)** was the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The film, set in the French capital, includes a scene with a stylized recreation of the Place de la Concorde, where the iconic Egyptian monument stands.\n\nThe journey to pinpoint this film involved a multi-step process. Initially, a comprehensive list of all Best Picture Oscar winners was compiled, alongside the historical erection dates of the three Luxor Obelisks located outside of Egypt. The obelisk in Paris's Place de la Concorde was erected in 1836, followed by Cleopatra's Needle in London in 1878, and finally, Cleopatra's Needle in New York's Central Park in 1881.\n\nWith these timelines established, the investigation turned to the settings of early Best Picture-winning films. Several films were identified as potential candidates due to their locations in New York, London, or Paris. Among the earliest contenders were *The Broadway Melody* (1928/29), set in New York, and *Cavalcade* (1932/33), which features scenes in London. However, detailed searches revealed no on-screen depiction of Cleopatra's Needle in either film.\n\nSubsequent examinations of other Paris-set winners, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) and *Gigi* (1958), also did not yield definitive visual evidence of the Luxor Obelisk.\n\nUltimately, research confirmed that *An American in Paris* contains a notable scene on a studio set designed to represent the Place de la Concorde, with a clear depiction of the Luxor Obelisk. The film's celebrated ballet sequence also incorporates the famous square and its fountain, further cementing its visual reference to this Parisian landmark.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
