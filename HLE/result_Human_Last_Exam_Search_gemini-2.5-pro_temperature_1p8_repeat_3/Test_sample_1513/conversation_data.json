    "An island town situated more than 500 kilometers from any other inhabited island, which rests on a bay created by a volcanic caldera bearing the same name as the town, is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas.\n\nThis settlement is the capital of Tristan da Cunha, a remote group of volcanic islands in the South Atlantic Ocean and a British Overseas Territory. It holds the distinction of being the most remote inhabited archipelago on Earth. The nearest inhabited landmass, Saint Helena, is approximately 2,100 to 2,437 kilometers away, and the closest continental land is South Africa, about 2,800 kilometers distant.\n\nThe town of Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is located on the only flat area of the main island, which is a volcano. It sits on the northwest coast at the base of Queen Mary's Peak, the island's volcanic summit. While the settlement is on a bay overlooking \"Big Beach\" and \"Little Beach\", the entire island is a stratovolcano. A volcanic eruption in 1961 occurred near the settlement, forcing the temporary evacuation of its residents.\n\nThe town itself was named in honor of the visit of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, in 1867. While not explicitly named \"Edinburgh of the Seven Seas Bay,\" a bay marks the entrance to the settlement.\n\n<<<Edinburgh of the Seven Seas>>>"
