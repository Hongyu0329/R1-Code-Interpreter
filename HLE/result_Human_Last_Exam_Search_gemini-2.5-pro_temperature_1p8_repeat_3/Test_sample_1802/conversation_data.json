    "A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is a quantum channel that can be expressed in the form:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d^2-1} p_i U_i \\rho U_i^\\dagger $$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the density matrix of the qudit, $\\{U_i\\}_{i=0}^{d^2-1}$ are the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators), which form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $p_i$ are non-negative real numbers that sum to one, i.e., $p_i \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{i=0}^{d^2-1} p_i = 1$.\n\nThe operators $K_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$ are the Kraus operators for the channel $\\Lambda$. A given Pauli channel is defined by the set of probabilities $\\{p_i\\}$.\n\nThe complementary channel, denoted as $\\Lambda^c$, describes the evolution of the environment that interacts with the primary system. The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. A fundamental result in quantum information theory states that the rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is equal to the dimension of the vector space spanned by the operators of the form $K_i^\\dagger K_j$, where $\\{K_i\\}$ is the set of Kraus operators for the original channel $\\Lambda$.\n\nIn our case, the operators are $K_i^\\dagger K_j = (\\sqrt{p_i} U_i)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_j} U_j) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} U_i^\\dagger U_j$.\nThe rank of the complementary channel is therefore:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\text{dim}\\left(\\text{span}\\left\\{ U_i^\\dagger U_j \\mid \\text{for all } i, j \\text{ such that } p_i > 0 \\text{ and } p_j > 0 \\right\\}\\right) $$\nTo find the maximal rank of the complementary channel, we need to choose the probabilities $p_i$ such that this dimension is maximized.\n\nThe operators $U_i^\\dagger U_j$ are themselves $d \\times d$ matrices. They belong to the vector space of all $d \\times d$ complex matrices, $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, which has a dimension of $d^2$. Therefore, the rank of the complementary channel can be at most $d^2$.\n\nWe now need to show that this maximum value of $d^2$ is achievable for some valid Pauli channel. Let's choose a Pauli channel where all the probabilities $p_i$ are non-zero, for example, the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_i = 1/d^2$ for all $i = 0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1$.\nIn this case, the set of operators whose span we are considering is $\\{U_i^\\dagger U_j\\}_{i,j=0}^{d^2-1}$.\n\nThe set of generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ forms a group under matrix multiplication, up to phase factors. This means that for any pair of operators $U_i$ and $U_j$, their product $U_i U_j$ is proportional to another Pauli operator $U_k$. Since the set $\\{U_i\\}$ is closed under multiplication (and taking adjoints, as $U_i^\\dagger$ is also proportional to a Pauli operator), the set of all products $\\{U_i^\\dagger U_j\\}$ will generate the entire set of Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$, up to phase factors.\n\nSince the set of all $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is linearly independent and forms a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, their linear span has a dimension of $d^2$.\n\nThus, by choosing a Pauli channel that includes all $d^2$ Pauli operators with non-zero probability, the rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$. As we've argued that the rank cannot exceed $d^2$, this is indeed the maximal possible rank.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
