    "Adult Raphidopterans, or snakeflies, are predators that primarily feed on soft-bodied insects. They have a noted preference for aphids and are considered beneficial for pest control in orchards.\n\nIn addition to preying on insects, some adult snakeflies also consume nectar and pollen. It is not definitively known if pollen is a required part of their diet, but it has been found in their digestive systems. They are often found on nectar-producing plants with small flowers.\n\nGiven the options:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Snakeflies have been recorded feeding on nectar.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While snakeflies eat pollen, specific records for Māhoe pollen are not available.\n*   **C. Fungus:** There is no evidence to suggest that snakeflies consume fungus.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** As predators and nectar/pollen feeders, they do not eat leaf tissue.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Snakeflies are significant predators of aphids. While \"Totara\" is a specific type of tree, the snakefly's diet of aphids in general is well-documented.\n\nBased on the evidence, adult Raphidopterans have been recorded feeding on both nectar and aphids.\n\n<<<F>>>"
