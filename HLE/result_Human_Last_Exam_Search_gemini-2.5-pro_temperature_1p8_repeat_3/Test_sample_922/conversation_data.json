    "The single known integer value that completes the sequence 24663, 35005, 119261, 196219, 211770, 227296, as of August 2022, is 272707.\n\nThis sequence is known in mathematics as the Enots Wolley sequence and is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A336957. The name \"Enots Wolley\" is \"Yellowstone\" spelled backward, and its definition is related to the Yellowstone sequence (A098550) but with some reversed conditions.\n\nThe sequence is defined as the lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers, starting with 1 and 2, where for any term `a(n)` with `n > 2`, `a(n)` shares a common factor with the previous term `a(n-1)` but is relatively prime to the term before that, `a(n-2)`. An open conjecture by N. J. Sloane posits that every integer with at least two distinct prime factors will eventually appear in this sequence.\n\nA search of the OEIS database for sequence A336957 reveals the term following 227296.\n\n<<<272707>>>"
