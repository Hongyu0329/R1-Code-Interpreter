    "The number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of order 512 is 9.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### 1. Defining the Semidihedral Group\nThe semidihedral group of order 512, denoted as SD_512, is a group of order 2⁹. It can be defined by the presentation:\nSD_512 = < r, s | r²⁵⁶ = 1, s² = 1, srs = r¹²⁷ >\n\nThis group has 512 elements, which can be expressed in the form rⁱ or rⁱs.\n\n### 2. Understanding Power Subgroups\nThe term \"power subgroup\" refers to a specific type of subgroup. For a group *G*, a subgroup *H* is a power subgroup if it is the set of the k-th powers of all elements in *G* for some integer *k*. This is formally written as H = Gᵏ = { gᵏ | g ∈ G }. It's important to note that Gᵏ is not always a subgroup, but when it is, it is called a power subgroup. An alternative definition is the subgroup generated by the set of k-th powers, H = <gᵏ | g ∈ G>, which is always a subgroup. For the semidihedral group, these definitions align.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Power Subgroups\nWe need to determine the set of distinct subgroups Gᵐ for all integers *m* ≥ 1.\n\n*   **Case 1: *m* is odd**\n    When *m* is an odd number, the power subgroup Gᵐ is the entire group G itself. This is because the generators *r* and *s* of the group are present in the set of *m*-th powers, and they generate the entire group. Thus, for any odd *m*, we get only one distinct power subgroup, which is SD_512.\n\n*   **Case 2: *m* is even**\n    When *m* is an even number, the power subgroup Gᵐ is a cyclic subgroup of the form <rᵈ>, where *d* = gcd(*m*, 256). Since 256 = 2⁸, any such divisor *d* must be a power of 2. As *m* is even, *d* must also be even. The possible values for *d* are the even divisors of 256, which are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. This gives us the following 8 distinct subgroups:\n    *   <r²>\n    *   <r⁴>\n    *   <r⁸>\n    *   <r¹⁶>\n    *   <r³²>\n    *   <r⁶⁴>\n    *   <r¹²⁸>\n    *   <r²⁵⁶> = {e} (the trivial subgroup)\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nCombining both cases, the distinct power subgroups of SD_512 are the group G itself and the 8 cyclic subgroups generated by even powers of *r*.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = 1 (for odd *m*) + 8 (for even *m*) = 9.\n\nIn general, for a semidihedral group SD₂ⁿ, the number of power subgroups is *n*. In this instance, n = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
