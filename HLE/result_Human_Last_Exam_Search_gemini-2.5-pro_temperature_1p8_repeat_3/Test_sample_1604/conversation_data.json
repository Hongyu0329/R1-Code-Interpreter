    "The latest battle historically depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Battle of Huj**.\n\nThis engagement, which took place on November 8, 1917, during the First World War, was the subject of her painting *Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*. The battle was part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign between British and Ottoman forces.\n\nOther battles from the First World War depicted by Lady Butler include:\n*   **The Retreat from Mons** (August 1914), depicted in her 1927 painting *The Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*. The Battle of Mons took place on August 23, 1914.\n*   **The Battle of Loos** (September 1915), shown in her work featuring the London Irish Rifles, known as *'Footballers at Loos'*.\n*   A general scene from the war is depicted in her 1929 painting, *A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders*.\n\nWhile several of her paintings portray scenes from the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War, her works depicting World War I are of later historical events. These include well-known pieces such as *Scotland Forever!* which shows the charge of the Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, and *The Roll Call*, which is associated with the Battle of Inkerman in 1854 during the Crimean War. Her painting, *The Defence of Rorke's Drift*, illustrates the famous battle from the Anglo-Zulu War in January 1879. Another work, *Floreat Etona!*, captures a moment from the Battle of Laing's Nek in 1881.\n\n<<<The Battle of Huj>>>"
