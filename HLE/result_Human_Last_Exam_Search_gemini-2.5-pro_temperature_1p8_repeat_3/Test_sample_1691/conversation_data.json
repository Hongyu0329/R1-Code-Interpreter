    "An analytical formula that approximates the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for the small $\\epsilon$ regime is given by the leading term of its asymptotic expansion.\n\nLet the integral be $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)} dx$, where $f(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$. For small positive $\\epsilon$, the value of the integrand is largest in the region where $f(x)$ is smallest. The function $f(x)$ has its minimum value in the integration interval $$ at $x=0$, where $f(0)=0$. Therefore, the main contribution to the integral for small $\\epsilon$ comes from the neighborhood of $x=0$.\n\nNear $x=0$, the term $9x^5$ is the dominant part of $f(x)$. Thus, we can approximate $f(x) \\approx 9x^5$. The integral can be approximated by replacing $f(x)$ with this leading term and extending the upper integration limit to infinity, as the contribution from larger $x$ is negligible in this approximation.\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can perform a change of variables. Let $u^5 = \\frac{9x^5}{\\epsilon}$, which gives $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u$. Then, $dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du$. Substituting these into the integral gives:\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon + 9\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)u^5} du = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon(1 + u^5)} du$\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du$\n\nThe remaining definite integral is a standard result, related to the Beta function, and can be expressed as:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^n} du = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$\n\nFor $n=5$, we have:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\left(\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nThis gives the analytical formula for the approximation of $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n<<<The analytical formula is $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\epsilon^{-4/5}$, where the constant $C$ is given by $C = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$.>>>"
