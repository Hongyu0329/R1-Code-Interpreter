    "The number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a surface code patch with holes depends on the specific arrangement and type of those holes and the boundaries of the patch. There are different methods for encoding, leading to different capacities.\n\nA common and straightforward method involves creating pairs of holes of the same type (either 'rough' or 'smooth' boundaries) to define a logical qubit. In this approach, two holes are used to create a single logical qubit. Therefore, a patch with two holes would encode one logical qubit. With two such patches, the total would be two logical qubits.\n\nHowever, more advanced configurations allow for denser encoding. By using holes with mixed boundary types (parts of the hole's boundary are 'rough' and other parts are 'smooth'), it is possible to encode more information. A specific architecture known as a \"mixed diamond-hole surface code\" has been shown to encode as many as 5 logical qubits in a single patch using just two holes.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of logical qubits for two patches, we assume each patch can be configured with this advanced \"mixed diamond-hole\" architecture.\n\nTherefore, at most, two patches of surface code with two holes each can encode:\n*   5 logical qubits per patch\n*   2 patches\n\nTotal logical qubits = 5 logical qubits/patch Ã— 2 patches = 10 logical qubits.\n\n<<<10>>>"
