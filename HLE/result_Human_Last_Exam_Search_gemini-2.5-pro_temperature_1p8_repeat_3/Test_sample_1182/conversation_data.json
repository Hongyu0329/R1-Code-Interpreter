    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, a detailed analysis of the curve's structure and its behavior at the prime 2 is required.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Curve and its Reduction\nThe curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. To understand its stable reduction, we analyze the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. The behavior of these roots under the 2-adic valuation determines the structure of the stable reduction.\n\nThe polynomial can be written as $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$. One root is $x_1 = 0$. Let $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. The valuations of the other four roots are determined by the Newton polygon of $g(x)$ at $p=2$. The 2-adic valuations of the coefficients of $g(x)$ are:\n*   $v_2(8) = 3$ (for $x^4$)\n*   $v_2(4) = 2$ (for $x^3$)\n*   $v_2(4) = 2$ (for $x^2$)\n*   $v_2(1) = 0$ (for $x^1$)\n*   $v_2(8) = 3$ (for $x^0$)\n\nFrom the Newton polygon constructed with these valuations, we find that $g(x)$ has one root, let's call it $x_2$, with a 2-adic valuation of $v_2(x_2) = 3$. The other three roots, $x_3, x_4, x_5$, each have a 2-adic valuation of $v_2(x_i) = -1$ for $i=3,4,5$.\n\nThe curve has degree 5, which is odd, so there is also a branch point at infinity. This gives a total of six branch points for the curve.\n\n### 2. Clustering of Branch Points\nThe stable reduction of a curve is determined by how its branch points cluster in the 2-adic sense. Branch points are considered to be in the same cluster if they reduce to the same point over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nThe branch points of the curve are $\\{0, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, \\infty\\}$. We examine their 2-adic valuations:\n*   $v_2(0)$ is infinite, which reduces to 0.\n*   $v_2(x_2) = 3$, which is positive, so $x_2$ reduces to 0.\n*   $v_2(x_3) = v_2(x_4) = v_2(x_5) = -1$, which are negative, so these roots reduce to infinity.\n*   The branch point at $\\infty$ also reduces to infinity.\n\nBased on this, the branch points partition into two clusters:\n*   **Cluster 1 (reducing to 0):** $\\{0, x_2\\}$\n*   **Cluster 2 (reducing to $\\infty$):** $\\{x_3, x_4, x_5, \\infty\\}$\n\n### 3. The Structure of the Stable Reduction\nThe structure of the stable reduction is a graph of curves, where the vertices correspond to these clusters of branch points. Since there are two clusters, the stable reduction will have two main components. The arithmetic genus of these components can be calculated based on the number of branch points in each cluster.\n*   The component for Cluster 1, with 2 branch points, has arithmetic genus $\\lfloor (2-1)/2 \\rfloor = 0$. This component is a rational curve (a projective line).\n*   The component for Cluster 2, with 4 branch points, has arithmetic genus $\\lfloor (4-1)/2 \\rfloor = 1$. This component is an elliptic curve.\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve is therefore composed of an elliptic curve and a rational curve. For the total arithmetic genus of the stable reduction to be 2 (the genus of the original curve), these two components must intersect. The formula for the arithmetic genus of a curve composed of two components $C_1$ and $C_2$ is $p_a(C) = p_a(C_1) + p_a(C_2) + (C_1 \\cdot C_2) - 1$.\nHere, $p_a(C)=2$, $p_a(C_1)=1$ (elliptic curve), and $p_a(C_2)=0$ (rational curve).\nSo, $2 = 1 + 0 + (C_1 \\cdot C_2) - 1$, which gives $(C_1 \\cdot C_2) = 2$.\n\nThis means the elliptic curve and the rational curve intersect at two distinct points. Each of these intersection points is an ordinary double point (a node) on the stable reduction.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has exactly two double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
