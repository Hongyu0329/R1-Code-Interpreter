    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of X. The upper bound is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum (the cardinality of the set of real numbers).\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1.  Let $U$ be the dense open subset of the connected metric space $X$. We are given that every point in $U$ has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. This property means that $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold. As a subspace of a metric space, $U$ is also metrizable.\n\n2.  Since $U$ is an open set in the metric space $X$, its connected components are also open sets in $X$. Let $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ be the set of connected components of $U$. These components are disjoint and open.\n\n3.  In a metric space, any collection of disjoint open sets must be countable. Therefore, the set of connected components $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ must be countable.\n\n4.  Each component $U_i$ is a connected 1-dimensional manifold. Every connected 1-manifold is homeomorphic to either the real line ($\\mathbb{R}$) or the circle ($S^1$).\n\n5.  Both $\\mathbb{R}$ and $S^1$ are second-countable spaces (they have a countable basis for their topology). A countable union of second-countable spaces is second-countable. Since $U$ is a countable union of its components $U_i$, $U$ is second-countable.\n\n6.  Every second-countable topological space is separable, which means it contains a countable dense subset. Let's call this countable dense subset of $U$ by the name $D$.\n\n7.  We are given that $U$ is dense in $X$. Since $D$ is dense in $U$, it follows that $D$ is also dense in $X$. This makes $X$ a separable metric space.\n\n8.  A key result in topology states that any separable metric space has a cardinality of at most **c**, the cardinality of the continuum. For any point $x \\in X$, since $D$ is dense, there exists a sequence of points in $D$ that converges to $x$. This fact can be used to show that the number of points in $X$ cannot be greater than the number of all possible sequences of points from $D$, which is $|\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathbf{c}$.\n\n9.  Furthermore, any connected metric space with more than one point has a cardinality of at least **c**. Thus, if $X$ is not a single point, its cardinality must be exactly **c**.\n\nTherefore, the conditions given in the problem constrain the cardinality of $X$ to be no more than the cardinality of the real numbers.\n\n<<<**c** (the cardinality of the continuum)>>>"
