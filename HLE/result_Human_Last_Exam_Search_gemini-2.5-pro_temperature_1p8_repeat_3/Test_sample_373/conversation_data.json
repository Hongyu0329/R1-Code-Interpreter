    "To determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping, we must first define the graph's structure and the sampling process.\n\n### Barbell Graph Structure\n\nA barbell graph is typically constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a path. For a 10-node graph, the most standard and simple structure consists of two 5-node complete graphs (K₅) connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck,\" as it is the sole link between the two dense clusters.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the graph's properties:\n*   **Total Nodes (n):** 10.\n*   **Cliques:** Two complete graphs with 5 nodes each.\n*   **Bottleneck:** A single edge connecting one node from each clique. Let's call the nodes connected by the bottleneck `u` and `v`.\n*   **Edges within one K₅ clique:** A 5-node complete graph has (5 * 4) / 2 = 10 edges.\n*   **Total Edges (m):** The total number of edges is the sum of edges in both cliques plus the bottleneck edge: 10 (left clique) + 10 (right clique) + 1 (bottleneck) = 21 edges.\n\n### Node Degrees\n\nThe degree of a node is its number of connections.\n*   For any node *not* part of the bottleneck connection (8 nodes in total), its degree is 4 (it connects to the 4 other nodes within its own clique).\n*   For the two nodes connected by the bottleneck (`u` and `v`), their degree is 5 (4 connections within their own clique plus 1 connection to the other clique via the bottleneck edge).\n\n### Randomized Uniform Gossiping\n\nIn a randomized uniform gossiping algorithm, the sampling process occurs in two steps:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from all `n` nodes in the graph. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/n`.\n2.  The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors to communicate with, again, uniformly at random. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor is `1/d`, where `d` is the degree of the selected node.\n\nThe probability of sampling a specific directed edge `(u, v)` is the product of these probabilities: `P(u) * P(v|u) = (1/n) * (1/degree(u))`.\n\n### Calculating the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge\n\nThe undirected bottleneck edge `(u, v)` can be sampled in two ways: by first picking node `u` and then its neighbor `v`, or by first picking node `v` and then its neighbor `u`. The total probability is the sum of these two events.\n\n1.  **Probability of sampling in the direction u → v:**\n    *   Probability of picking node `u` = `1/10`.\n    *   Degree of node `u` = 5.\n    *   Probability of `u` picking `v` = `1/5`.\n    *   `P(u → v) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n2.  **Probability of sampling in the direction v → u:**\n    *   Probability of picking node `v` = `1/10`.\n    *   Degree of node `v` = 5.\n    *   Probability of `v` picking `u` = `1/5`.\n    *   `P(v → u) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of these two probabilities:\n`P(bottleneck) = P(u → v) + P(v → u) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nThis can be expressed as a decimal or a percentage: `1/25 = 0.04 = 4%`.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
