    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G₀, which describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle, exhibits a direct and fundamental dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ. This relationship is most clearly seen in the frequency-momentum representation.\n\nThe bare Green's function for a fermionic system in frequency (ω) and momentum (k) space is given by the expression:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ)**\n\nwhere:\n*   **G₀(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function.\n*   **ω** represents the frequency.\n*   **ϵₖ** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum k. This term encapsulates the dispersion relation of the non-interacting particles.\n*   **iδ** is an infinitesimal imaginary term (with δ being a small positive number) that ensures the correct causal time-ordering of the propagator. The sign of δ determines whether the propagator is retarded or advanced.\n\nFrom this expression, we can describe the functional dependence as follows:\n\nThe bare Green's function, G₀, is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ. This means that G₀ has poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. In other words, the function diverges when the frequency of the propagating particle matches its allowed energy, which is a key feature indicating the energy spectrum of the non-interacting system.\n\nThis relationship is a cornerstone of many-body theory and quantum field theory, as it provides a direct link between the propagator of a particle and its fundamental energy properties. The path integral formalism provides a powerful framework for deriving these Green's functions.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a pole at the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. In the frequency-momentum representation, its functional dependence is expressed as G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ), showing an inverse relationship with the term (ω - ϵₖ).>>>"
