    "To solve this, I will outline the plan to identify the correct temperature for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) and then provide a Python script to present the information.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Synthesis Reaction:** The primary method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride is the direct reaction between xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas.\n2.  **Research Reaction Conditions:** I will access chemical knowledge about this specific reaction. The reaction requires energy input, typically in the form of heat, to overcome the activation energy and proceed at an efficient rate.\n3.  **Determine the Optimal Temperature:** The standard, industrially and academically recognized method involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio) in a nickel reaction vessel. The temperature for this process to produce XeF₄ efficiently is well-documented to be around 400 °C. Lower temperatures result in a very slow reaction, while higher temperatures can lead to the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n4.  **Select the Corresponding Answer:** I will compare this established temperature with the provided answer choices to find the correct one.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** The Python script will programmatically store the reaction data and the answer choices, identify the correct answer, and print the relevant chemical equation and the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_xenon_fluoride_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the synthesis temperature for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\n    and presents the relevant chemical information.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is achieved by the direct\n    # reaction of Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F2).
