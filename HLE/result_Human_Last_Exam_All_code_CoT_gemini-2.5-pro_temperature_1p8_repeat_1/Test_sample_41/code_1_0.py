The dataset shows an environment that is overwhelmingly favorable for significant, tornadic supercells. Key factors like instability (CAPE), low-level moisture (LowRH, LCL), and wind shear (SRH) are all at high or extreme levels.

However, the single number that represents the most significant negative impact, or inefficiency, on tornadogenesis is the Critical Angle.

The Critical Angle is the angle between the storm-relative inflow vector and the low-level shear vector. For a storm to most efficiently ingest the available horizontal rotation (measured by SRH) and tilt it into a vertical, tornadic circulation, this angle needs to be as small as possible (ideally near 0°).

In this case, the Critical Angle is 47°. While not prohibitive, an angle of 47° represents a suboptimal alignment. It means that despite the extreme amount of available low-level rotation (SFC-1km SRH = 361), the storm cannot utilize it with maximum efficiency. This geometric inefficiency acts as a bottleneck, making it harder for the storm to translate its immense potential into an actual tornado. Therefore, it is the greatest limiting factor in this specific dataset.

The number representing this greatest negative impact is:
