    print(" - MA (cotton-adapted) biotype: Thrives on a sucrose-only diet.")
    print(" - Implication: Watermelon is raffinose-rich; Cotton is sucrose-rich.")
    print(" - Key Enzyme: Galactosidase is needed to metabolize raffinose.")
    print(" - Experiment: CA is moved to cotton, MA is moved to watermelon.")

    print("-----------------------------------")
    
    # Statement A
    print("\nA. CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.")
    print("   - Analysis: The text explicitly states CA does well on raffinose, while MA does well on sucrose. This strongly supports that CA is better adapted to metabolize RFOs.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This statement is TRUE.")

    # Statement B
    print("\nB. CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.")
    print("   - Analysis: The experiment shows each biotype 'did well on' these specific diets, which reflects their adaptation and, by extension, their preference.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This statement is TRUE.")
    
    # Statement C
    print("\nC. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.")
    print("   - Analysis: CA moves from high-raffinose (watermelon) to low-raffinose (cotton). The enzyme for raffinose metabolism (galactosidase) would logically decrease in activity due to the lack of its substrate.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This statement is TRUE.")

    # Statement D
    print("\nD. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.")
    print("   - Analysis: Cotton's sucrose provides glucose. High glucose can inhibit the use of other sugars (catabolite repression). This is a plausible biological reason for decreased activity.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This statement is plausible and potentially TRUE.")
    
    # Statement E
    print("\nE. Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.")
    print("   - Analysis: MA is defined by its inability to do well on raffinose. This suggests a fundamental lack of the necessary metabolic machinery. It is highly unlikely this biotype could simply increase its enzyme activity in response to raffinose exposure. This contradicts its core described trait.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This statement is NOT TRUE.")

    print("\nStep 3: Final determination.")
    print("--------------------------")
    print("Statements A, B, and C are directly supported by the text. Statement E describes a response that contradicts the fundamental characteristics of the MA biotype. Therefore, E is the statement that is not true.")
