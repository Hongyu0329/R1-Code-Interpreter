# The gate capacitance per unit area, C, connects the gate voltage, V_g, 
# and the 2D carrier density, n, through the capacitor equation:
# n = C * V_g / e  (assuming zero threshold voltage)

# The carrier density is also related to the quantum Hall filling factor, nu, 
# magnetic field, B, and fundamental constants e and h:
# n = nu * (e * B / h)

# By equating the two expressions for n, we can find a direct relationship 
# between V_g and nu:
# C * V_g / e = nu * (e * B / h)
# Rearranging for V_g gives: V_g = nu * (e^2 * B) / (C * h)
# This shows that the gate voltage is directly proportional to the filling factor.

# The problem states that plateaus are observed at V_1, 3*V_1, and 5*V_1.
# This implies the corresponding filling factors must be in the ratio 1:3:5.

# With spin degeneracy g_s=2 and valley degeneracy g_v=2, the total degeneracy factor is g=4.
# For a system like this (e.g., graphene), the Hall plateaus follow the sequence nu = g * (N + 1/2),
# where N = 0, 1, 2, ... is the Landau Level index.
# For N=0, nu_1 = 4 * (0 + 1/2) = 2. This corresponds to V_g = V_1.
# For N=1, nu_2 = 4 * (1 + 1/2) = 6. This corresponds to V_g = 3*V_1.
# For N=2, nu_3 = 4 * (2 + 1/2) = 10. This corresponds to V_g = 5*V_1.
# The ratio 2:6:10 is indeed 1:3:5, which matches the experimental observation.

# Now we can calculate C by considering the change between two plateaus. Let's use the first two.
# We can express C as: C = (Delta_nu / Delta_V_g) * (e^2 * B / h)
