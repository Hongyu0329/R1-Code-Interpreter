    "My plan is to identify the major rivers that are explicitly named in Virgil's Aeneid and then find their approximate real-world lengths. I will store this information in a Python dictionary. Then, I will write a Python script to sort these rivers by length in descending order and print the names and lengths of the top three.\n\n1.  **Create a dataset**: I will compile a list of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their corresponding lengths in kilometers. The main candidates are the Nile, Euphrates, Rhine, Araxes, Po, and Tiber.\n2.  **Sort the data**: The script will sort the rivers based on their length, from longest to shortest.\n3.  **Output the result**: The script will print the top three longest rivers, clearly stating their names and lengths.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid,\n    sorts them by length, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in kilometers.\n    # Sources for mentions: Nile (8.711), Euphrates (8.726), Rhine (8.727), Araxes (8.728), Po (6.659), Tiber (numerous).\n    aeneid_rivers = {\n        'Nile': 6650,\n        'Euphrates': 2800,\n        'Rhine': 1233,\n        'Araxes': 1072,\n        'Po': 652,\n        'Tiber': 406,\n        'Hebrus': 480\n    }\n\n    # Sort the rivers by length in descending order.\n    # The sorted() function returns a list of tuples (key, value).\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(aeneid_rivers.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers.\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three_rivers):\n        # The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation\",\n        # which is interpreted here as printing the name and length clearly.\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {river}: approximately {length} km\")\n\nfind_longest_rivers()\n```\n<<<\n1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
