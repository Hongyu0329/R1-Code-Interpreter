        Other options are incorrect because they mix word-level features with text-level features (which measure the complexity of passages, not single words):
        - 'number of unique words' (in A and C) is a measure of a text's lexical diversity.
        - 'number of word categories' (in B and E) is a measure of a text's syntactic variety.

        Therefore, the most coherent and accurate group of features for predicting the complexity of a single word is {list(features.keys())}.
