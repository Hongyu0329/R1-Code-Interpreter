# A 2x2 matrix is PSD if M_11>=0, M_22>=0 and det(M)>=0
# det(E) = 1*1 - pi*pi = 1 - pi^2 < 0. So E is not in P.

# This shows C is a convex combination of two elements from S.
# So C is in P.

# Passes all simple tests.
# The advanced test based on the integer structure of the generators suggests D is not in P.

# from convex combinations of (a^2, ab, b^2) where a,b are integers.
