    "To determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Triple Crown:** A batter wins the Triple Crown by leading their league (American or National) in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.\n2.  **List all instances:** I will compile a list of every time a player has won the Triple Crown in MLB history.\n3.  **Identify unique winners:** From the complete list of Triple Crown seasons, I will identify the unique players who have achieved this feat, as some players have won it more than once.\n4.  **Count and display:** The final count of unique players will be calculated. The code will display the list of unique winners and then show a simple equation representing the sum of these unique players to get the final total.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_mlb_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates and displays the number of unique MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    It lists each unique player and shows a sum to represent the final count.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for all MLB batting Triple Crown winning seasons.\n    # Source: Major League Baseball official records.\n    triple_crown_seasons = [\n        {\"player\": \"Paul Hines\", \"year\": 1878},\n        {\"player\": \"Tip O'Neill\", \"year\": 1887},\n        {\"player\": \"Hugh Duffy\", \"year\": 1894},\n        {\"player\": \"Nap Lajoie\", \"year\": 1901},\n        {\"player\": \"Ty Cobb\", \"year\": 1909},\n        {\"player\": \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"year\": 1922},\n        {\"player\": \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"year\": 1925},\n        {\"player\": \"Chuck Klein\", \"year\": 1933},\n        {\"player\": \"Jimmie Foxx\", \"year\": 1933},\n        {\"player\": \"Lou Gehrig\", \"year\": 1934},\n        {\"player\": \"Joe Medwick\", \"year\": 1937},\n        {\"player\": \"Ted Williams\", \"year\": 1942},\n        {\"player\": \"Ted Williams\", \"year\": 1947},\n        {\"player\": \"Mickey Mantle\", \"year\": 1956},\n        {\"player\": \"Frank Robinson\", \"year\": 1966},\n        {\"player\": \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"year\": 1967},\n        {\"player\": \"Miguel Cabrera\", \"year\": 2012},\n    ]\n\n    # Extract player names from the list of winning seasons\n    player_names = [season['player'] for season in triple_crown_seasons]\n\n    # A set is used to automatically handle duplicates, giving us a list of unique players\n    unique_winners = sorted(list(set(player_names)))\n\n    # The final answer is the count of unique players\n    num_unique_winners = len(unique_winners)\n\n    print(\"The unique players who have won the MLB Triple Crown are:\")\n    for name in unique_winners:\n        print(f\"- {name}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of unique winners, we sum them up.\")\n    print(\"The final equation representing the count of each unique player is:\")\n    \n    # We represent each unique winner as '1' in our sum\n    equation_parts = ['1' for _ in unique_winners]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_unique_winners}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThere are {num_unique_winners} unique Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_mlb_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<15>>>"
