# Based on the topological analysis, the space CL(X) is disconnected.
# For any non-compact, infinite, totally-disconnected ultrametric space X,
# the hyperspace CL(X) has two quasi-components, which in this context
# correspond to the connected components. These are the set of compact subsets
# and the set of non-compact subsets.
# For a compact X, CL(X) is also disconnected and fragments into infinitely
# many components.
# Thus, the minimum number of components is 2.
