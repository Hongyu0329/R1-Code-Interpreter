        "3. Impact of Comorbidity on Brain Connectivity: Both substance abuse and major psychiatric disorders are often characterized by 'dysconnectivity' â€” abnormal communication patterns between brain regions. When they co-occur, these disruptions are often exacerbated.",
        
        "4. Specific Research Findings: Neuroimaging studies (like fMRI) consistently show that in dual-diagnosis patients, the functional connectivity (i.e., synchronized activity) between the left and right insula is often weakened or decreased compared to healthy individuals.",
        
        "5. Rationale for Decreased Connectivity: This reduction in communication is believed to impair the brain's ability to integrate bodily signals, emotional information, and cognitive control. This impairment can manifest as poor decision-making, intense cravings, and difficulty regulating emotions, which are hallmark symptoms of both conditions.",

        "   - C (Decreased inter-hemispheric insula connectivity): This aligns perfectly with the scientific consensus on dysconnectivity in dual-diagnosis populations.",
        "   - E (Increased left-hemispheric interconnectivity): This concerns connectivity within one hemisphere, not between them as the question asks."
