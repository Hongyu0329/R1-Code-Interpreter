# The problem concerns two circles and two perpendicular lines.
# Line 1: y = x + 1
# Line 2: y = -x + 5
# Circle C: radius r, center C
# Circle D: radius R = 2, center D

# Based on geometric principles, for a unique solution to exist, we must assume
# that both circles are tangent to both lines and that they are tangent to each other internally.

# For a circle of radius 'r' tangent to two perpendicular lines, the distance from its
# center 'C' to the lines' intersection point 'P' is given by PC = r * sqrt(2).
# Similarly, for the second circle with radius R=2, PD = R * sqrt(2).

# The centers C, D, and the intersection point P are collinear.
# The distance between the centers, CD, is therefore |PC - PD|.
# CD = |r * sqrt(2) - R * sqrt(2)| = |r - R| * sqrt(2).

# For the circles to be tangent internally, the distance between their centers CD
# must be equal to the absolute difference of their radii, |r - R|.
# This gives the equation:
# |r - R| * sqrt(2) = |r - R|

# This equation can be rearranged to |r - R| * (sqrt(2) - 1) = 0.
# Since (sqrt(2) - 1) is not zero, the only possible solution is |r - R| = 0, which means r = R.

# Given that the radius of the second circle is R = 2.
R = 2
r = R

# The problem asks for the value of r^2.
r_squared = r**2
