    print("--- The Question ---")
    print("Suppose X is a connected metric space, with a dense open subset U such that each point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the real line R.")
    print("Is there an upper bound on the cardinality of X?\n")

    print("--- The Argument ---")
    
    print("\nStep 1: Analyze the properties of the subset U.")
    print("The condition that each point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R means that U is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: Show that U is a separable space.")
    print("A space is 'separable' if it contains a countable dense subset.")
    print("As a subspace of the metric space X, U is itself a metric space.")
    print("A theorem in topology states that any manifold that is also a metric space must be second-countable.")
    print("(This is because a metric space is paracompact, and a paracompact manifold is second-countable).")
    print("A second-countable space is always separable. Therefore, U is a separable space.")
    print("Let's denote the countable dense subset of U by D_U.")

    print("\nStep 3: Show that X is also a separable space.")
    print("We will show that D_U, the countable dense subset of U, is also dense in X.")
    print("Let 'x' be any point in X and let N_x be any open neighborhood of 'x'.")
    print("Because U is dense in X, the intersection of N_x and U is a non-empty open set.")
    print("Let V = N_x intersect U. V is a non-empty open subset of U.")
    print("Because D_U is dense in U, it must intersect every non-empty open subset of U. Thus, D_U must have a non-empty intersection with V.")
    print("Since V is a subset of N_x, it follows that D_U has a non-empty intersection with N_x.")
    print("Since 'x' and N_x were arbitrary, this proves that D_U is dense in X.")
    print("Thus, X contains a countable dense subset, which means X is a separable metric space.")

    print("\nStep 4: Establish the cardinality bound for a separable metric space.")
    print("A separable metric space X is also second-countable, meaning it has a countable basis for its topology, B = {B_1, B_2, B_3, ...}.")
    print("We can define an injective (one-to-one) function f from X to the power set of the natural numbers, P(N).")
    print("For any point x in X, define f(x) = { i | x is in B_i }.")
    print("This function is injective: If x and y are distinct points in X, then because X is a metric space (and thus Hausdorff), there are disjoint open sets O_x and O_y containing x and y.")
    print("Since B is a basis, there exists some B_k such that x is in B_k and B_k is a subset of O_x.")
    print("This means k is in the set f(x). But y is not in O_x, so y is not in B_k, which means k is not in the set f(y).")
    print("Therefore, f(x) and f(y) are different sets. The function f is indeed injective.")
    print("This injective map shows that the cardinality of X is no more than the cardinality of P(N).")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The cardinality of P(N) is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by 'c'.")
    
    # The final equation as requested by the prompt
    print("The resulting inequality for the cardinality of X, denoted |X|, is:")
    
    number_2 = 2
    power_symbol = "^"
    set_symbol = "aleph_0" # Using a string to represent the symbol

    print(f"|X| <= |P(N)| = {number_2}{power_symbol}{set_symbol} = c")
    
    print("\nSo, yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of X. The upper bound is the cardinality of the continuum, c.")

    print("\nTo demonstrate that this bound is tight, consider X = R (the real line), which has cardinality c.")
    print("Let U = R \\ {0}. U is open and dense in X, and every point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R. This example satisfies all the conditions.")
