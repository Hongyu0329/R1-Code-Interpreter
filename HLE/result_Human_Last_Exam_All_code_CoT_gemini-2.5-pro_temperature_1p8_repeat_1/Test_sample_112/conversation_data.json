    "This is a knowledge-based question from the field of English literature. The poem in question is the 14th-century Middle English romance *Sir Launfal*, written by Thomas Chestre. It survives in a single 15th-century manuscript, Cotton Caligula A.ii, which is now in the British Library. This same manuscript also contains several other works, including a treatise on etiquette and behavior for children.\n\nMy plan is to provide a shell script that uses the `echo` command to print the answer to your question.\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/sh\n# This script will output the name of the book of manners Sir Launfal was preserved alongside.\n\necho \"The poem Sir Launfal is preserved in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii, which also contains a book of manners known as the Book of Courtesy (or Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke).\"\n```\n<<<Book of Courtesy>>>"
