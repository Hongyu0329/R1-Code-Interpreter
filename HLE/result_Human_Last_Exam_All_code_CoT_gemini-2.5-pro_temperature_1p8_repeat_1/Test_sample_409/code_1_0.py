The question asks for the minimal cohomology degree at which non-trivial extensions and obstructions become significant for B-modules in a semi-abelian category. We can analyze this by looking at the interpretations of the low-degree cohomology groups, denoted H^n(B, A), where A is a B-module.

Degree 0:
The 0-th cohomology group, H^0(B, A), represents the invariants of A under the action of B.
Equation: H^0(B, A) = A^B
This degree is about static properties, not extensions or obstructions. The number in this analysis is 0.

Degree 1:
The 1-st cohomology group, H^1(B, A), classifies derivations and is related to the study of complements and sections in semi-direct products. This can be viewed as a specific type of extension problem.
The number in this analysis is 1.

Degree 2:
The 2-nd cohomology group, H^2(B, A), is fundamentally important because it classifies the set of all extensions of B by A. These are represented by short exact sequences:
0 -> A -> E -> B -> 0
A non-zero element in H^2(B, A) corresponds to a non-trivial (i.e., non-split) extension. The value of this cohomology class can be seen as the *obstruction* to the extension being trivial. Therefore, at degree 2, the concepts of both non-trivial extensions and obstructions are of central importance. The number in this analysis is 2.

Degree 3:
The 3-rd cohomology group, H^3(B, A), relates to obstructions for more complex algebraic structures, such as extending crossed modules. This is a higher-level obstruction theory.
The number in this analysis is 3.

Conclusion:
While phenomena related to extensions begin at degree 1, the classification of extensions in the general sense and the concept of an obstruction to triviality are first unified and become significant at degree 2.
