    "This task requires a combination of literary knowledge and a way to verify that knowledge using code. The central question is how many historical, post-biblical saints are mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Premise:** Milton was a 17th-century Puritan who was highly critical of the Catholic Church, especially practices like the veneration of saints, which he would have considered idolatrous. The subject of *Paradise Lost* is the biblical story of the Fall of Man. Based on this context, it is highly unlikely that Milton would name any post-biblical historical saints in his epic poem. The poem does, however, mention numerous biblical figures who are also considered saints (e.g., Abel, Moses, David, Peter). The query specifically asks for \"historical saints,\" which most commonly refers to figures from Church history after the apostolic age. The code will therefore search for this specific category of saint.\n2.  **Formulate a Technical Approach:**\n    *   The script will first fetch the complete plain text of *Paradise Lost* from the Project Gutenberg website.\n    *   It will then define a list of prominent historical, post-biblical saints. This list will be representative, including well-known figures like Augustine, Francis of Assisi, Aquinas, and others.\n    *   The script will systematically search the entire text of the poem for each of these names. To ensure accuracy, it will look for whole words only (e.g., searching for `\\baugustine\\b` to avoid partial matches).\n    *   Finally, it will count the number of saints found and display this result, formatted as a simple equation as requested. Since the expected number is zero, the equation will reflect this.\n\nThis approach uses code to programmatically verify the conclusion drawn from literary and historical context.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef count_historical_saints_in_paradise_lost():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script searches for the names of historical, post-biblical saints\n    in the text of Milton's 'Paradise Lost' to determine how many are mentioned.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script will check for historical (post-biblical) saints in 'Paradise Lost'.\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Downloading the text of 'Paradise Lost'...\")\n\n    # The URL for the plain text of Paradise Lost from Project Gutenberg\n    url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/20/pg20.txt\"\n    text = \"\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=15)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # This will raise an HTTPError for bad responses\n        text = response.text\n        print(\"Successfully downloaded 'Paradise Lost'.\")\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not retrieve the text from the internet. {e}\")\n        print(\"Cannot proceed without the text.\")\n        return\n\n    # A representative list of major historical saints who lived after the biblical era.\n    # Note: Biblical figures like Peter, David, Moses etc., are excluded as the focus\n    # is on saints from post-apostolic church history.\n    saints_to_check = [\n        \"Augustine\", \"Ambrose\", \"Jerome\", \"Gregory\", \"Benedict\", \"Francis\",\n        \"Dominic\", \"Aquinas\", \"Catherine\", \"Teresa\", \"Ignatius\", \"George\", \"Patrick\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Searching the text for the following names:\")\n    print(\", \".join(saints_to_check))\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    found_saints = []\n    text_lower = text.lower()\n\n    for saint in saints_to_check:\n        # Use regex with word boundaries (\\b) to match only whole words, case-insensitively.\n        # This prevents matching \"francis\" in \"francs\" or \"dominic\" in \"dominion\".\n        pattern = r'\\b' + re.escape(saint.lower()) + r'\\b'\n        if re.search(pattern, text_lower):\n            found_saints.append(saint)\n\n    # Step 3: Report the findings and present the final equation.\n    print(\"Step 3: Compiling results...\")\n    total_found = len(found_saints)\n\n    if total_found == 0:\n        print(\"\\nConclusion: As expected from Milton's theology and the poem's subject,\")\n        print(\"no historical, post-biblical saints from the list were mentioned by name.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"\\nFound {total_found} historical saint(s) mentioned by name: {', '.join(found_saints)}\")\n\n    # Fulfilling the request to output each number in the final equation.\n    # If saints were found, this would be a sum of 1s.\n    # Since none are found, the set of numbers is empty, and the total is 0.\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    if total_found > 0:\n        # This part of the code is unlikely to run, but is included for completeness.\n        equation_numbers = [\"1\"] * total_found\n        equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_numbers)\n        print(f\"{equation_string} = {total_found}\")\n    else:\n        # If no saints are found, the equation is simply a statement of the total.\n        print(f\"0 = {total_found}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_historical_saints_in_paradise_lost()\n\n<<<0>>>\n```"
