Legal Analysis:

The core issue is determining when the 'risk of loss' for the MacBook Pro transferred from the seller (Jake) to the buyer (Luke). This is governed by the Sale of Goods Act.

1.  **Nature of the Contract:** The contract was for a specific item (the MacBook Pro). However, on June 2, it was not in a 'deliverable state' as it needed repairs.
2.  **The Governing Rule:** For a contract involving specific goods that the seller must work on to make them deliverable, the law states that ownership (and thus risk) passes to the buyer only after two conditions are met:
    a) The work required is completed by the seller.
    b) The buyer is given notice that the work has been completed.
3.  **Applying the Rule to the Facts:**
    *   On June 5, Jake completed the screen replacement, putting the MacBook into a deliverable state. This satisfies the first condition.
    *   On June 5, Jake sent a text to Luke notifying him that the laptop was ready. This satisfies the second condition of providing notice.
4.  **Timing of the Transfer:** Because both conditions were met on June 5, the ownership and the risk of loss passed to Luke on that date.
5.  **The Loss Event:** The flood that destroyed the laptop occurred *after* June 5. Since the risk had already transferred to Luke, he bears the loss.
6.  **Conclusion:** Jake is not required to refund the money. Option B correctly states that the risk passed to Luke when Jake put the laptop in a deliverable state (completed repairs) and notified Luke that it was ready.
