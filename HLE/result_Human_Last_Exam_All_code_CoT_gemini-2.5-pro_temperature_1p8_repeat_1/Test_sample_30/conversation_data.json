We should allow randomized verification procedures by relaxing (i) and (ii) to high probability statements: every z ∈ L should have a proof π that is accepted with probability at least c (the completeness parameter), and for no z ∈/ L should there be a proof π that is accepted with probability larger than s (the soundness parameter).

Complexity theory formalizes the notion of proof in a way that emphasizes the role played by the verification procedure.

We say that a language L admits efficiently verifiable proofs if there exists an algorithm V (formally, a polynomial-time Turing machine) that satisfies the following two properties: (i) for any z ∈ L there is a string π such that V(z, π) returns 0 (we say that V “accepts”), and (ii) for any z ∈/ L there is at least one string π such that V(z, π) accepts.\nJ. A normal form verifier is a pair V = (S, D) where S is a sampler with field size q(n) = 2 and D is a decider.

The number of levels of verifier V is defined to be the number of levels of its sampler S.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "An interactive proof system is a fundamental concept in computational complexity theory, providing a framework for understanding how interaction and randomization can be leveraged to verify computational statements. Let's analyze the provided options to determine which one is correct.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Statement A:** This statement claims that interactive verification does not involve communication between a verifier and a prover. This is the exact opposite of the definition of an interactive proof system, which is fundamentally based on the back-and-forth communication between these two parties. Thus, A is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Statement B:** The interactive proof for Graph Non-Isomorphism (GNI) is a classic and foundational example that is almost always used to introduce the power of interaction and randomization in proof systems. It perfectly illustrates how a polynomial-time verifier can be convinced of a statement (that two graphs are not isomorphic) by an all-powerful prover, something not known to be possible in the class NP. Therefore, stating it \"isn't very helpful\" is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Statement C:** Research into multi-prover interactive proofs with shared quantum entanglement (the class MIP*) has led to the result MIP* = RE (Recursively Enumerable). This means such systems can verify answers to problems that are undecidable by a standard Turing machine. This demonstrates that quantum entanglement is an exceptionally powerful tool for verification. Thus, C is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Statement D:** This statement correctly captures the asymmetry in computational requirements for the prover and the verifier in an interactive proof system. The verifier must be efficient, modeled as a probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) Turing machine, so that the verification process is feasible. The prover, in contrast, is assumed to be computationally unbounded (or at least, much more powerful). For the system to be able to handle complex problems (like those in PSPACE, which is equivalent to the class IP), the prover must be powerful enough to solve these problems, which are widely believed to require exponential time. Thus, D is a correct characterization.\n\n5.  **Analysis of Statement E:** The first part correctly describes completeness and soundness probabilities. However, the last part is false. A key feature of these systems is that as long as there is any polynomial gap between the completeness and soundness parameters, the protocol can be repeated in parallel to \"amplify\" the probabilities, making the probability of error exponentially small. Therefore, the exact initial values (within reasonable bounds) do *not* affect the ultimate power of the complexity class. Thus, E is incorrect.\n\n6.  **Analysis of Statement F:** Introducing a second prover who cannot communicate with the first (Multi-prover Interactive Proofs, or MIP) demonstrably increases the power of the verifier. The class of problems verifiable in this model is MIP = NEXP (Nondeterministic Exponential Time), which is strictly larger than IP = PSPACE. The inability of provers to coordinate allows the verifier to \"cross-check\" their answers for consistency. Thus, F is incorrect.\n\n7.  **Analysis of Statement G:** A major result in complexity theory is that IP = PSPACE. The class PSPACE contains problems believed to be significantly harder than NP problems (it is known that NP ⊆ PSPACE, and it is conjectured that NP ≠ PSPACE). Therefore, interaction and randomization allow a verifier to solve problems vastly more difficult than those in NP. Thus, G is incorrect.\n\n8.  **Analysis of Statement H:** Standard complexity theory defines languages over the binary alphabet {0, 1}, not a trinary alphabet {0, 1, 2}. This is a fundamental factual error. Thus, H is incorrect.\n\n9.  **Analysis of Statement I:** This statement attempts to define the class NP. However, the soundness condition (property ii) is fundamentally flawed. It states that for an instance *not* in the language, there is a proof that the verifier accepts. The correct condition is the opposite: for an instance not in the language, the verifier must *reject all* possible proofs. Thus, I is incorrect.\n\n10. **Analysis of Statement J:** This describes a very specific technical construct, likely related to Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs). While related, it is not a general statement about all interactive proof systems and is overly specific (e.g., fixing the field size to 2) to serve as a general, correct characterization.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, statement D is the only one that provides a correct and general description of the core properties of a prover-verifier interactive proof system.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_interactive_proofs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes statements about interactive proof systems and identifies the correct one.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Dictionary to hold the analysis for each statement.\n    analysis = {\n        'A': \"Incorrect.
