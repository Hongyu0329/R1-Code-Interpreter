        'C': "Incorrect. The result MIP* = RE shows that quantum entanglement allows for the verification of answers to extremely complex (even undecidable) problems.",
        'D': "Correct. This statement accurately describes the standard model of an interactive proof system (IP). The verifier must be efficient (run in probabilistic polynomial time), while the prover is assumed to be computationally powerful, often needing to solve problems that are believed to require exponential time (e.g., PSPACE-complete problems).",
        'E': "Incorrect. Standard amplification techniques show that the exact values of completeness and soundness do *not* significantly affect the class of languages, as long as a polynomial gap exists between them.",
        'F': "Incorrect. Using two non-communicating provers (MIP) allows verification of an even larger class of problems (NEXP) than with one prover (IP = PSPACE).",
        'G': "Incorrect. A landmark result in complexity theory is IP = PSPACE. PSPACE is believed to be a much larger class than NP, demonstrating that interaction and randomization greatly enhance verification power.",
        'H': "Incorrect. Standard complexity theory defines languages over the binary alphabet {0, 1}, not a trinary alphabet.",
        'I': "Incorrect. The soundness condition described is wrong. For a statement not in the language, a valid proof system requires that the verifier rejects *all* purported proofs.",
        'J': "Incorrect. This describes a highly specific technical setup (related to PCPs) and is not a correct general statement about all interactive proof systems."
