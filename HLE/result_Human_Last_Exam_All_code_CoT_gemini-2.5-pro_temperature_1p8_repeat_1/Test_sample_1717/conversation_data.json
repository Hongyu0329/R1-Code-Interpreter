    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the final Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** First, I will find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the game's data, this is 3,640 HP.\n2.  **Identify Health Scaling Formula:** Next, I will find the formula Terraria uses to scale boss health with additional players in Expert Mode. The health is increased by 35% for each player after the first one.\n3.  **Construct the Equation:** I will combine the base health and the scaling factor into a single mathematical equation where health is a function of the number of players (`N`). The formula is `Total Health = BaseHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`.\n4.  **Analyze for Infinite Players:** The question asks for the health with an *infinite* number of players. I will analyze the behavior of the equation as `N` approaches infinity.\n5.  **Final Code:** I will write a Python script that prints out each number and part of the formula, explains the process, and states the final conclusion based on the analysis.\n\n```python\ndef terraria_health_calculation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode given an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to Terraria's source code, these are the relevant values.\n    base_health_expert = 3640\n    per_player_health_bonus = 0.35\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the base values for the calculation.\")\n    print(f\"The Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Expert Mode is: {base_health_expert}\")\n    print(f\"The health bonus per additional player in Expert Mode is: {per_player_health_bonus} (or 35%)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Define the health scaling equation.\")\n    print(\"The formula is: Total Health = Base Health * (1 + Player Bonus * (Number of Players - 1))\")\n    print(\"Let 'N' represent the number of players.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Build the specific equation for the Eye of Cthulhu.\")\n    print(\"The final equation for its health is:\")\n    # The user requested to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_health_expert} * (1 + {per_player_health_bonus} * (N - 1))\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Analyze the equation for an infinite number of players (as N -> âˆž).\")\n    print(\"The formula can be simplified to: Total Health = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35 * N)\")\n    print(\"As 'N' (the number of players) increases without limit, the total health also increases without limit.\")\n    print(\"Terraria's game mechanics do not place a cap on this scaling.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Conclusion: The theoretical maximum health is infinite.\")\n\nterraria_health_calculation()\n<<<Infinite>>>"
