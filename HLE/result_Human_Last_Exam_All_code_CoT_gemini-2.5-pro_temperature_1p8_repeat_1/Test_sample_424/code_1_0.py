    Solves the problem by analyzing the connectivity of the described planar set.

    The problem asks for the number of points in a given planar set S, such that if a point p is removed from S, the complement of the resulting set has three or more components.
    The phrasing "the complement" is ambiguous. A plausible interpretation, leading to a non-trivial answer, is that it refers to the complement within the set S itself. That is, we are looking for the number of points p such that S \\ {p} has three or more connected components. These points are 'cut points' of the topological graph S.

    We analyze the main junction points to see if their removal fragments the set S into 3 or more pieces.
