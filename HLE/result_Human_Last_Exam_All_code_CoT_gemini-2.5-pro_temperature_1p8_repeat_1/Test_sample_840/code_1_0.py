            "A deterministic transport method similar to Pn. While powerful, it can suffer from modeling artifacts like 'ray effects' in scenarios with significant voids (e.g., loss of coolant), which are common in accidents. It is also less flexible for complex geometry changes than Monte Carlo.",
        "C. Monte Carlo - Serpent with ENDF/B-VII.1 Data": 
            "A strong candidate. The Monte Carlo method excels at modeling complex 3D geometries and continuous-energy physics, making it ideal for accident conditions. Serpent is a capable code that can be used for transient analysis. However, ENDF/B-VII.1 is an older data library.",
        "D. Monte Carlo - MCNP with ENDF/B-VIII.1 Data": 
            "The most suitable method. It combines the 'gold standard' Monte Carlo approach for high-fidelity geometry and physics modeling with the latest major release of the evaluated nuclear data library (ENDF/B-VIII.1). This provides the highest predictive accuracy for complex, time-dependent accident scenarios, typically through coupling with thermal-hydraulic codes.",
        "E. 3D Diffusion": 
            "The least suitable method. Diffusion theory is a low-order approximation of transport theory and is fundamentally invalid for accident scenarios involving large voids, strong absorbers, or boundary effects. Its assumptions break down completely under such conditions."
