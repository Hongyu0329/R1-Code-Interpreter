    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to determine the memory usage for the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The main goal is to create the *most memory-efficient* C program. This means using the minimum amount of memory for variables. The secondary goal is to calculate this memory usage in bytes.\n\n2.  **Memory Optimization Strategy:** A standard approach would be to read both strings into two character arrays. However, to save memory, we can avoid storing the second string completely. The most memory-efficient approach would be:\n    *   Read the first string into a character array.\n    *   Read the second string one character at a time using a function like `getchar()`.\n    *   As each character of the second string is read, compare it immediately with the corresponding character in the first string array. This way, we only need to store one full string in memory.\n\n3.  **Identify Necessary Variables:** Based on this strategy, the C program would need the following variables:\n    *   A character array to store the first string. Since the maximum length is 100, we need an array of size 101 to accommodate the null terminator (`\\0`). Let's call it `s1`.\n    *   An integer variable to use as an index for traversing the `s1` array. Let's call it `i`.\n    *   An integer variable to store the result of `getchar()`. `getchar()` returns an `int` so it can represent every possible character value as well as the special `EOF` (End Of File) value. Let's call it `c`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Memory per Variable:** We will assume a standard competitive programming environment (like a 64-bit Linux system with GCC), where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n    *   Memory for `char s1[101]`: `101 characters * 1 byte/character = 101 bytes`.\n    *   Memory for `int i`: `1 * 4 bytes = 4 bytes`.\n    *   Memory for `int c`: `1 * 4 bytes = 4 bytes`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all variables. I will use a Python script to present this calculation clearly.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the memory usage for the described C program.\n\n# 1. Memory for the first string.\n# The string can be up to 100 characters long. In C, we need one extra\n# byte for the null terminator '\\0'. The size of a char is 1 byte.\nmem_string_1 = 101 * 1\n\n# 2. Memory for the loop index.\n# An integer variable is needed to keep track of the position in the string.\n# On a typical system for competitive programming, an int takes 4 bytes.\nmem_index_variable = 4\n\n# 3. Memory for the character from the second string.\n# To read the second string character by character without storing it, we can use\n# getchar(). getchar() returns an int, which takes 4 bytes.\nmem_char_variable = 4\n\n# 4. Total memory calculation.\n# The total memory is the sum of the memory for these three variables.\nm = mem_string_1 + mem_index_variable + mem_char_variable\n\n# Output the breakdown of the calculation as requested.\nprint(f\"Memory for the first string (char s1[101]): {mem_string_1} bytes\")\nprint(f\"Memory for the index variable (int i): {mem_index_variable} bytes\")\nprint(f\"Memory for the single character from the second string (int c): {mem_char_variable} bytes\")\nprint(f\"Total memory m = {mem_string_1} + {mem_index_variable} + {mem_char_variable} = {m} bytes\")\n\n```\n<<<109>>>"
