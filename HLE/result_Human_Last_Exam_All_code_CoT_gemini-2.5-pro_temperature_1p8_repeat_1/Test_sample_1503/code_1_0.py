def solve_pohozaev_questions():
    """
    Solves the theoretical questions about the Pohozaev identity and related functionals.

    The analysis is based on established theories in variational methods for PDEs.
    - (a) The Pohozaev identity is a necessary, not sufficient, condition for a solution.
    - (b) Projecting onto the Pohozaev manifold is not always possible, as it
      requires sign conditions on the nonlinear terms that are not universally met.
    - (c) A minimizer on the Pohozaev manifold is a ground state, which also lies on
      the Nehari manifold. For such states, the energy along the radial scaling t -> J(tu)
      is maximized at t=1, implying a negative second derivative.
