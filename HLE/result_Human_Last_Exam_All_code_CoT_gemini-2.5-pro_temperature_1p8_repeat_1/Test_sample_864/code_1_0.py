# Define the D-transform variable
D = sympy.Symbol('D')

# The derivation in the text shows that the whitening filter W(D) is given by:
# W(D) = 1 - D^{-1}
# This can be written as W(D) = w_0 * D^0 + w_{-1} * D^{-1}

# Coefficients of the whitening filter
w0 = 1
w_neg1 = -1

# Final equation for W(D)
# We use sympy's pretty print for a nice mathematical output
w_d_expr = w0 + w_neg1 * D**(-1)

print("The appropriate whitening filter W(D) that ensures the resulting channel is causal is:")
print(sympy.pretty(w_d_expr, use_unicode=True))
print("\nIn this equation, the coefficients for each power of D are:")
print(f"The coefficient for D^0 is: {w0}")
print(f"The coefficient for D^-1 is: {w_neg1}")

final_equation = f"W(D) = ({w0})*D^0 + ({w_neg1})*D^-1"
print(f"\nThe final equation is:\n{final_equation}")

# Final Answer as per thought process
# The filter is W(D) = 1 - D^{-1}. This is the answer.
# Let's wrap it in the required format.
# The user wants an expression, and the code outputs the numbers in the expression.
# No single value as an answer, so outputting the expression seems right.
# Let's write the simplified expression in the final answer block.

final_answer = "1 - D^{-1}"
