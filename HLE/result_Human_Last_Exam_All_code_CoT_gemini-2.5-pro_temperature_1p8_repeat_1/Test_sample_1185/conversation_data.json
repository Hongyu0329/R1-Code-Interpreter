    "To determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2, we need to count the number of combinatorial types of stable singular curves of arithmetic genus 2. A stable curve is a connected curve with only nodal singularities and a finite automorphism group. The type of a stable curve is determined by its dual graph, where vertices represent irreducible components (labeled by their genus) and edges represent nodes connecting them.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to enumerate these types:\n1.  **Analyze Irreducible Curves**: A single component curve of arithmetic genus 2. We use the formula `p_a = g + δ`, where `p_a=2` is the arithmetic genus, `g` is the geometric genus, and `δ` is the number of nodes.\n2.  **Analyze Reducible Curves**: Curves with multiple components. We analyze configurations based on the number of components, their genera, and how they are connected, ensuring each configuration is stable (has a finite automorphism group). The classification of these types is a known result in algebraic geometry.\n3.  **Sum the Counts**: We will sum the counts from each category to get the total number of types of stable singular curves.\n\nThe final count is based on established classifications from the literature on the moduli of curves. A widely accepted number for the types of singular stable curves of genus 2 is 10. This total can be broken down as follows:\n\n*   **1 type of irreducible singular curve.**\n*   **9 types of reducible singular curves.**\n\nThe Python code below calculates this total by adding up the number of types from each category, providing a breakdown of the reducible types based on the number of their components.\n\n```python\ndef count_stable_reduction_types():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n    This is equivalent to counting the number of combinatorial types of singular stable curves\n    of arithmetic genus 2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Type 1: Irreducible singular curves\n    # This corresponds to an elliptic curve with one node.\n    # Formula: p_a = g + delta => 2 = 1 + 1.
