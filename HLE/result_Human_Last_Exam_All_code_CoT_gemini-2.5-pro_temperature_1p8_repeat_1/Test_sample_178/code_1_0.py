# The memory required for the most efficient C interpreter can be calculated
# by summing the size of its essential variables.

# 1. A variable to hold the return value of getchar().
#    getchar() returns an int to accommodate the EOF value.
#    In Xland, an int is 32 bits.
char_variable_size = 4  # bytes

# 2. A variable to store the number of statements, 'n'.
#    We calculated the max value of n to be 90, which fits in an int8_t.
n_variable_size = 1  # byte

# 3. A variable to store the final value, 'x'.
#    The range of x is [-90, 90], which fits in an int8_t.
x_variable_size = 1  # byte

# Total memory is the sum of the sizes of these three variables.
total_memory = char_variable_size + n_variable_size + x_variable_size

print(f"{char_variable_size} + {n_variable_size} + {x_variable_size} = {total_memory}")
