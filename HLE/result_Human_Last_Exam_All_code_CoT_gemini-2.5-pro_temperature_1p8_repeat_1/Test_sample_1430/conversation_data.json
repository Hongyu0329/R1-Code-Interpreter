    "Of course, I can help you solve this problem. Here is a step-by-step plan for my approach:\n\nFirst, I will identify the key mathematical objects and the question being asked. The question is to find the minimum and maximum possible rank of the Néron-Severi group for $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 curve and $C^{(15)}$ is its 15th symmetric power.\n\n**Step 1: Relate the Rank of NS(X) to the Jacobian of C**\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, denoted $\\rho(X)$, is not independent of the properties of the curve $C$. There is a classical formula by I.G. Macdonald that connects the Picard number of a symmetric power of a curve to the Picard number of its Jacobian variety, $J = \\text{Jac}(C)$. The formula states:\n$\\rho(C^{(d)}) = 1 + \\rho(J)$\nThis formula holds for any degree $d \\ge 1$. In our case, $d=15$ and the genus is $g=3$. So, the problem reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(J)$, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Minimum Possible Rank of NS(J)**\nThe Jacobian $J$ is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g=3$. The rank of its Néron-Severi group, $\\rho(J)$, depends on the geometric properties of the curve $C$. For a \"very general\" curve $C$, its Jacobian has the minimal possible number of endomorphisms (the ring $\\text{End}(J)$ is just $\\mathbb{Z}$). In this case, the Néron-Severi group is generated solely by the class of the canonical principal polarization (the theta divisor). Therefore, the minimum possible rank is 1.\n$\\rho_{min}(J) = 1$\n\n**Step 3: Find the Maximum Possible Rank of NS(J)**\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension $g$ is bounded above by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}$, which is equal to $g^2$. For our genus $g=3$ Jacobian, this means:\n$\\rho(J) \\le 3^2 = 9$\nThis maximum value is achieved for very special curves with Complex Multiplication (CM). An example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian achieves this maximum rank is the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$. The Jacobian of this curve is isogenous to a product of three copies of a CM elliptic curve, and its Néron-Severi rank is 9. Therefore, the maximum possible rank is 9.\n$\\rho_{max}(J) = 9$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\nUsing the formula from Step 1 and the minimum and maximum values for $\\rho(J)$ from Steps 2 and 3, we can calculate the smallest and largest possible ranks for $\\rho(X)$.\n*   Smallest rank of NS(X) = $1 + \\rho_{min}(J) = 1 + 1 = 2$\n*   Largest rank of NS(X) = $1 + \\rho_{max}(J) = 1 + 9 = 10$\n\nHere is the Python code that formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the smallest and largest possible ranks for the Neron-Severi\n# group of X = C^(15), where C is a genus 3 curve.\n\n# The genus of the curve C\ng = 3\n\n# Step 1: Define the bounds for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian, J = Jac(C).\n# For a \"very general\" curve of genus g, the rank of NS(J) is minimal.\n# The Neron-Severi group is generated by the class of the theta divisor.\nrho_J_min = 1\n\n# The maximum rank of NS(J) for a g-dimensional abelian variety is bounded by g^2.\n# This maximum is achievable for special curves with Complex Multiplication.\nrho_J_max = g**2\n\n# Step 2: Use Macdonald's formula to relate the rank of NS(X) to the rank of NS(J).\n# The formula is rho(X) = rho(C^(d)) = 1 + rho(J). This is independent of the degree d (for d>=1).\n\n# Calculate the smallest possible rank for NS(X)\nrank_NS_X_min = 1 + rho_J_min\n\n# Calculate the largest possible rank for NS(X)\nrank_NS_X_max = 1 + rho_J_max\n\n# Step 3: Print the results and the logic behind them.\nprint(\"The problem is to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(15),\")\nprint(\"where C is a genus g=3 curve.\\n\")\nprint(f\"The rank, rho(X), is given by the formula: rho(X) = 1 + rho(Jac(C)), where J = Jac(C) is the Jacobian of C.\\n\")\nprint(f\"For a genus g={g} curve, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian, rho(J), has a known range:\")\nprint(f\" - The minimum possible rank is rho_J_min = {rho_J_min}.\")\nprint(f\" - The maximum possible rank is rho_J_max = g^2 = {g}*{g} = {rho_J_max}.\\n\")\nprint(\"Using this, we can calculate the range for rho(X):\")\nprint(f\"The smallest possible rank of NS(X) is 1 + rho_J_min = 1 + {rho_J_min} = {rank_NS_X_min}.\")\nprint(f\"The largest possible rank of NS(X) is 1 + rho_J_max = 1 + {rho_J_max} = {rank_NS_X_max}.\")\n\n```\n<<<Smallest: 2, Largest: 10>>>"
