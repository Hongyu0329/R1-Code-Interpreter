# The user wants to find the smallest and largest possible ranks for the Neron-Severi
# group of X = C^(15), where C is a genus 3 curve.

# The genus of the curve C
g = 3

# Step 1: Define the bounds for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian, J = Jac(C).
# For a "very general" curve of genus g, the rank of NS(J) is minimal.
# The Neron-Severi group is generated by the class of the theta divisor.
rho_J_min = 1

# The maximum rank of NS(J) for a g-dimensional abelian variety is bounded by g^2.
# This maximum is achievable for special curves with Complex Multiplication.
rho_J_max = g**2

# Step 2: Use Macdonald's formula to relate the rank of NS(X) to the rank of NS(J).
# The formula is rho(X) = rho(C^(d)) = 1 + rho(J). This is independent of the degree d (for d>=1).

# Calculate the smallest possible rank for NS(X)
rank_NS_X_min = 1 + rho_J_min

# Calculate the largest possible rank for NS(X)
rank_NS_X_max = 1 + rho_J_max

# Step 3: Print the results and the logic behind them.
