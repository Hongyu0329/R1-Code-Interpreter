    Solves the Gauss class number problem for h=48.

    The Gauss class number problem for a given class number 'h' involves finding all
    imaginary quadratic fields (uniquely identified by their negative fundamental
    discriminants 'd') that have that class number. This is a computationally
    difficult problem that has been solved for many small class numbers through
    extensive computer searches by mathematicians.

    For class number h=48, the number of such discriminants is a known result from
    these comprehensive searches.
