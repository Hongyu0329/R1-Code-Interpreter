    "An internal adjunction from an object $[n]$ to an object $[m]$ in the 2-category $\\Delta$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, a left adjoint $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and a right adjoint $g: [m] \\to [n]$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Adjunction Condition**: In a 2-category enriched over posets, a pair of morphisms $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and $g: [m] \\to [n]$ forms an adjunction ($f \\dashv g$) if and only if they satisfy the following two conditions for all $i \\in [n]$ and $j \\in [m]$:\n    *   $id_{[n]} \\le g \\circ f$, which translates to $i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in [n]$.\n    *   $f \\circ g \\le id_{[m]}$, which translates to $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [m]$.\n    These two conditions are equivalent to the single, more common condition for Galois connections between posets:\n    *   $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ for all $i \\in [n], j \\in [m]$.\n\n2.  **Establish a Bijection**: From this equivalence, for a given order-preserving map $f$, a right adjoint $g$ exists if and only if for every $j \\in [m]$, the set $S_j = \\{i \\in [n] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$ has a maximum element. In the totally ordered set $[n]$, this is equivalent to $S_j$ being non-empty. For $S_j$ to be non-empty for all $j \\in [m]$, we must have an element in the image of $f$ that is less than or equal to any $j$. Since $f$ is order-preserving, its minimum output is $f(0)$. Thus, we need $f(0) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [m]$, which implies $f(0)=0$.\n    Any order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ with $f(0)=0$ has a unique right adjoint $g$.\n\n3.  **Count the Maps**: The problem is now reduced to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: [n] \\to [m]$ such that $f(0)=0$. An order-preserving map from $[n]$ to $[m]$ is equivalent to a non-decreasing sequence of $n+1$ integers: $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(n)$, where each $f(i) \\in [m]$. The condition becomes:\n    $0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(n) \\le m$.\n\n4.  **Use Combinatorics (Stars and Bars)**: We need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $y_1, \\dots, y_n$ (where $y_i=f(i)$) of length $n$ with values from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$. This is a classic combinatorial problem. It is equivalent to choosing $n$ items from a set of $m+1$ items with replacement, where order does not matter. The formula for this is the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{k \\choose n}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{k+n-1}{n}$. Here, $k=m+1$ (the number of available values) and we are choosing $n$ values. The number of such maps is:\n    $\\binom{(m+1)+n-1}{n} = \\binom{m+n}{n}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Result**: For this problem, we have $n=23$ and $m=37$. The number of internal adjunctions is:\n    $\\binom{23+37}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe following Python code will compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex\n# category from [n] to [m]. This is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, n).\nn = 23\nm = 37\n\n# The values for the binomial coefficient C(a, b)\na = n + m\nb = n\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = math.comb(a, b)\n\n# The final equation is C(60, 23) = result.\n# The instruction is to output each number in this final equation.\n# The following print statement displays the equation and all its numbers.\nprint(f\"C({a}, {b}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<4665391696039648100>>>"
