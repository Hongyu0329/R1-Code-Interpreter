    # - Cracking (A, E) and Creep Deformation (D) are not primarily fixed by adding layers of material.
    # - Foreign Object Damage (B) and Corrosion (F) can cause material loss, but another option is a more common and direct fit.
    # - Blade Tip Rub and Wear (C) is a classic example of material being ground away from a specific location (the tip).
    #   The standard repair is to build this tip back to its original dimensions using a welding build-up process.
    #   This perfectly matches the description.

The repair method described, 'build-up of layers of filler material' via TIG welding, is an additive process used to replace lost material.

Let's evaluate the options:
- Cracking (A, E) and Creep Deformation (D) are primarily issues of material integrity and shape, not bulk material loss that needs 'building up'.
- Blade Tip Rub and Wear (C) is the damage caused by the blade tips making contact with the engine casing, which grinds away material. Repairing this damage involves adding layers of filler material to the tip to restore the blade's original length and profile. This is a perfect match for the described repair process.
- While Foreign Object Damage (B) and Corrosion (F) also involve material loss, tip wear is the most common and classic application for a welding 'build-up' procedure in turbine blade MRO.

Therefore, the main source of damage addressed is Blade Tip Rub and Wear.
