# 1. Analyze the first call to a->foo(). The compiler knows the type is 'A',
#    so it can devirtualize the call. No vtable load needed.
call_1_loads = 0

# 2. Analyze the second call to a->foo() after 'escape(a)'.
#    The escape() function makes the object's type unknown to the compiler.
#    A real virtual dispatch is required, which involves one vtable load.
call_2_loads = 1

# 3. Analyze the third call to b->foo() after placement new.
#    The compiler sees the 'new(a) B' and knows the object's type is now 'B'.
#    It can devirtualize the call again. No vtable load needed.
call_3_loads = 0

# 4. Calculate the total number of vtable loads.
total_loads = call_1_loads + call_2_loads + call_3_loads

# 5. Print the analysis and the final equation.
