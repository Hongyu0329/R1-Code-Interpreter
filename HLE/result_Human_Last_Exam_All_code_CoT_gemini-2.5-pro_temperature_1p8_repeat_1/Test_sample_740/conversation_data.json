    "To solve this problem, we will determine the values of λ for which the given Fredholm integral equation of the second kind has no solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, we will analyze the kernel of the integral equation, $K(x,y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x-y}$. This is a degenerate kernel, which can be expanded as a finite sum of products of functions of $x$ and $y$.\n    $K(x, y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\n2.  By substituting this kernel into the integral equation, we can see that the solution $u(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. Let $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i x^{n-1-i}$, where $c_i = \\int_0^1 y^i u(y) dy$.\n3.  Substituting the form of $u(x)$ into the definitions for the coefficients $c_j$ yields a system of $n$ linear algebraic equations for the $n$ unknown coefficients $c_0, ..., c_{n-1}$.\n4.  This system can be written in matrix form $(I - \\lambda M) \\mathbf{c'} = \\mathbf{f}$ for some matrix $M$ and vectors $\\mathbf{c'}$ and $\\mathbf{f}$.\n5.  According to the Fredholm alternative, the integral equation has no solution if the determinant of the matrix of coefficients of the linear system is zero, i.e., $det(I - \\lambda M) = 0$, AND if the right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{f}$ is not orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint system's matrix. The condition $det(I - \\lambda M) = 0$ is equivalent to $1/\\lambda$ being an eigenvalue of the matrix $M$.\n6.  It can be shown that the orthogonality condition is generally not met for this problem. Therefore, the equation has no solution when $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $M$.\n7.  The matrix $M$ depends on the integer $n$. As $n$ is not specified, we will provide a Python script to find the characteristic equation for the eigenvalues for any given $n$. The script will then derive the polynomial equation for $\\lambda$. For demonstration, we will set $n=3$ in the script.\n8.  The script will use the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to construct the matrix, find its characteristic polynomial, and then derive the corresponding polynomial equation for $\\lambda$. The final equation will be printed to the console.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan for $n=3$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_lambda_equation(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the polynomial equation for lambda for which the integral equation has no solution,\n    for a given integer n.\n\n    The problem reduces to a linear system (I - lambda * M)c = f, where 1/lambda\n    are the eigenvalues of the matrix M.\n    Let mu be an eigenvalue of M.
