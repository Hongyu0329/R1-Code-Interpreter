    # a) The quotient topology on Ω_g^rt / GL_g(Z) is Hausdorff.
    # FALSE (N). The Satake compactification is known to be non-Hausdorff for g >= 2.

    # b) The barycentric subdivision of the perfect cone decomposition of Ω_4^rt consists
    #    only of simplicial cones.
    # TRUE (Y). The barycentric subdivision of any polyhedral complex (which a cone
    # decomposition is) is always a simplicial complex. This is a general theorem.

    # c) For any compact set K in Ω_g^rt there exists a set of finitely many cones
    #    in the second Voronoi compactification such that their union contains K.
    # TRUE (Y). This is a direct consequence of the local finiteness property of
    # admissible cone decompositions like the second Voronoi decomposition.

    # d) The number of orbits of maximal cones in the perfect cone decomposition of
    #    Ω_7^rt is 33.
    # TRUE (Y). This is a known computational result from the geometry of numbers,
    # corresponding to the 33 classes of 7-dimensional perfect forms.

    # e) The GL_g(Z)-stabilizer of a cone σ in the central cone decomposition is
    #    finite if σ intersects Ω_g.
    # TRUE (Y). If the cone intersects the open set Ω_g, it must be of maximal
    # dimension. The stabilizer of a maximal cone in an admissible decomposition is finite.

    # f) The number of orbits of cones in the Second Voronoi decomposition of Ω_5^rt is 222.
    # FALSE (N). The number 222 is the number of orbits for the *First* Voronoi
    # decomposition (L-types) for g=5, not the second.

    # g) Given cones τ, σ in the perfect cone decomposition with τ a face of σ,
    #    one has that their corresponding groups of GL_g(Z)-stabilizers satisfy
    #    Stab(τ) <= Stab(σ).
    # FALSE (N). A symmetry of a part is not necessarily a symmetry of the whole.
    # We can provide a counterexample in Sym_2.
