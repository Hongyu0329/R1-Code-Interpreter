def solve_safe_goal_problem():
    """
    This function determines the safe goal for the AI model M and prints it.

    The problem states that the set of indices 'I' for truly successful predictors
    is uncomputable. This means the model M cannot algorithmically determine which predictors
    will be successful in the long run. A "safe" goal, therefore, cannot rely on this
    unknowable information.

    Instead, M must rely on what it *can* compute. For any finite amount of data,
    M can *verify* which of its predictors are consistent with that data. This act of
    verification is a computable process, and its successful result is a finite, checkable
    object that serves as a 'formal proof' of consistency up to that point.

    Therefore, a safe strategy is to have a learning process based on these verifiable facts.
    The goal is 'Verification-based learning'. The information that fuels this learning is the
    set of 'formal proofs' of consistency it generates for its predictors.
