    "The user is asking to identify crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means its point group must contain a rotoinversion axis (e.g., a mirror plane `m` or a center of inversion `-1`).\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal does not have a unique polar axis. This is true for all centrosymmetric point groups and some non-centrosymmetric ones.\n3.  **Optically Active**: The crystal has the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\nThere is a fundamental contradiction in these requirements. By definition, a crystal can only be optically active if it is **chiral**. A chiral crystal structure is one that is *not* superimposable on its mirror image, meaning its point group must *lack* any rotoinversion axes.\n\nTherefore, the conditions \"achiral\" and \"optically active\" are mutually exclusive. No crystal class can satisfy both. An achiral crystal cannot be optically active, and an optically active crystal must be chiral.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by defining the sets of crystal classes for each property and showing that their intersection is empty.\n\n```python\ndef find_contradictory_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the 32 crystal point groups to find those that are\n    simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and optically active, and explains\n    why no such classes exist.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 32 crystal point groups in Hermann-Mauguin notation.\n    all_32_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm',\n        '4', '-4', '4/m', '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm',\n        '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m',\n        '6', '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-6m2', '6/mmm',\n        '23', 'm-3', '432', '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # Condition 1: Optically Active classes (must be Chiral).\n    # These 11 classes lack any rotoinversion axes (e.g., mirror planes or inversion centers).\n    optically_active_classes = {'1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '222', '32', '422', '622', '23', '432'}\n\n    # Condition 2: Achiral classes.\n    # By definition, these are all classes that are NOT chiral.\n    achiral_classes = all_32_classes - optically_active_classes\n\n    # Condition 3: Non-polar classes.\n    # These are all classes that are not polar.
