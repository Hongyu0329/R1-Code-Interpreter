    "This is a conceptual question about the relationship between two key metrics in statistical genetics. Here's a step-by-step explanation.\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population-level parameter that quantifies the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be attributed to the additive effects of all measured Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). It represents a theoretical upper limit or a ceiling on how much of a trait's variation can be explained by a linear model using this set of SNPs. It is an estimate of the *total* signal present across all SNPs.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) Predictive Ability:** A PGS is a concrete tool, a predictor, built from the results of a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). It sums up an individual's genetic risk based on a set of SNPs and their estimated effect sizes from the GWAS. Its predictive ability is typically measured as R², which is the proportion of phenotypic variance it can explain in a new, independent sample.\n\n3.  **Compare the Two:** The predictive ability (R²) of a PGS is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability (h²_SNP). The reason is that a PGS is an *imperfect estimate* of the true genetic signal. Key sources of this imperfection include:\n    *   **Estimation Error:** GWASs are performed on finite samples, so the estimated SNP effect sizes used to build the PGS have statistical error. They are not the true effect sizes.\n    *   **Methodological Limitations:** PGS construction methods must deal with correlations between SNPs (Linkage Disequilibrium) and often involve choices like selecting only a subset of SNPs that are statistically significant, thereby ignoring the cumulative effect of many small-effect variants.\n    *   **Population Mismatch:** The GWAS sample and the PGS prediction sample may have different genetic ancestries or environmental contexts, which can reduce accuracy.\n\nIn short, SNP heritability is the theoretical *potential*, while the PGS's R² is the *realized* prediction performance. Due to the unavoidable errors and limitations in estimating and building the PGS, its performance will fall short of the theoretical ceiling set by the SNP heritability.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
