    This program calculates the exact value of the limit lim_{N->inf} p(N)/N
    by analyzing the contributing cases of the equation's coefficients.

    The final limit is the sum of contributions from different classes of
    coefficients. As explained in the plan, most coefficient sets lead to a
    finite number of solutions, and their contribution to the limit is 0.

    Only two cases provide non-zero contributions.
