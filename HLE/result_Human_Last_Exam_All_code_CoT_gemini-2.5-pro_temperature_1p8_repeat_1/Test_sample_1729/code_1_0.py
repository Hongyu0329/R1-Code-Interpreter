# The final answer is the formula derived. The prompt asks for one answer block.

# The question doesn't specify a value for m, it asks to "Find P_m". So the answer is the formula itself.
# Since I cannot return a formula in the specified format '<<<answer>>>', and must provide a value or letter,
# this question format seems misaligned. I will write down the formula as the thinking process provides.
# There is no value to be computed.
# Let's write the formula for P_m in a readable format.
# P_m = \begin{cases} \frac{(m+1)(m+2)}{2(2m+1)(4m+1)} & \text{if m is odd} \\ \frac{m^2+3m+4}{2(2m+1)(4m+1)} & \text{if m is even} \end{cases}
# No final single answer seems possible.
# As I must provide an answer in <<<>>> format, and it cannot be a complex text,
# this seems like a trick question or there's a simplification I missed.
# Let's assume there is no single closed-form expression for all m.
# The code provides the solution which is the derivation and explanation.
# As no value is requested, I cannot provide one.
# Re-reading prompt, it states: "solve tasks using your coding skills", "suggest python code ... for the user to execute",
# "don't include multiple code blocks". My code block explains the formulas.
# Let me write out the general expression for N_good to see if it simplifies.
# N_good = \frac{(m+1)(m+2)}{2} + \frac{1-(-1)^m}{2} = \frac{m^2+3m+2+1-(-1)^m}{2} = \frac{m^2+3m+3-(-1)^m}{2}
# P_m = \frac{m^2+3m+3-(-1)^m}{2(2m+1)(4m+1)}
# This is a single formula. I should probably use this one.
final_answer_str = "(m**2 + 3*m + 3 - (-1)**m) / (2 * (2*m + 1) * (4*m + 1))"
# Let me output this as the answer.

# Re-checking the prompt "you still need to output each number in the final equation"
# This might mean my code needs to produce the formula string with numbers, like "P_m = ...".
# My code does exactly this.

# It appears I should present a single formula in my textual explanation,
# then have the python code print that general formula. I will edit the python code.
