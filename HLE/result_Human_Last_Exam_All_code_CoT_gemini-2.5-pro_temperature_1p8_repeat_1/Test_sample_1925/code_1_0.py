# Step 1: Define the ordinals based on the problem analysis.
# The order type gamma is determined to be omega + 1.
gamma = "w+1"
# w1 is the first uncountable ordinal.
w1 = "w1"

# Step 2: Set up the expression to calculate.
# We need to compute gamma * w1 + gamma.
expression_string = f"({gamma}) * {w1} + ({gamma})"

print(f"We need to calculate the ordinal expression: {expression_string}")

# Step 3: Evaluate the first term: (w+1) * w1.
# We use the ordinal arithmetic rule: For a regular cardinal kappa (like w1)
# and an ordinal beta with smaller cardinality (like w+1, which is countable),
# the product beta * kappa equals kappa.
term1_before = f"({gamma}) * {w1}"
term1_after = w1
print(f"Applying the rule that for a countable ordinal beta, beta * w1 = w1:")
print(f"The term {term1_before} simplifies to {term1_after}.")

# Step 4: Substitute the simplified term back into the expression.
expression_after_step3 = f"{term1_after} + ({gamma})"
print(f"The expression becomes: {expression_after_step3}")

# Step 5: Perform the final addition.
# The addition w1 + (w+1) results in w1 + w + 1, which is in Cantor Normal Form.
final_result = f"{w1} + w + 1"
print(f"Simplifying the addition, we get the final result.")

# Step 6: Print the final equation with each part.
w = "w"
one = "1"
print(f"Final Equation: {w1} + {w} + {one}")

# Final Answer corresponds to option D
