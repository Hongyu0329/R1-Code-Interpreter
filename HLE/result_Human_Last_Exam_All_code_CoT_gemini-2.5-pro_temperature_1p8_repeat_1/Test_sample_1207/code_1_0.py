    Step 1: Analyze the key symptoms. The patient presents with a triad of:
    - Transient monocular vision loss (suggesting retinal artery occlusion).
    - Pulsatile headaches (a sign of encephalopathy).
    - Hearing loss (cochlear involvement).

    Step 2: Identify the corresponding syndrome. This clinical triad of encephalopathy, Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion (BRAO), and sensorineural hearing loss is characteristic of Susac's Syndrome, a rare autoimmune microangiopathy.

    Step 3: Correlate the syndrome with expected imaging findings. The classic and pathognomonic findings for Susac's Syndrome on a brain MRI are:
    - T2 hyperintense lesions in the central corpus callosum, often referred to as "snowball" lesions.
    - Potential for leptomeningeal enhancement, indicating inflammation of the brain's lining.

    Step 4: Evaluate the given options.
    - A: Incorrect. Suggests rheumatoid arthritis.
    - C, D, E: Incorrect. These findings do not align with the specific multi-system triad presented.
    - B: Correct. This option precisely describes the characteristic MRI findings seen in Susac's Syndrome.

    Therefore, the expected modality is MRI, and the finding is leptomeningeal enhancement with 'snowball' hyperintensities.
