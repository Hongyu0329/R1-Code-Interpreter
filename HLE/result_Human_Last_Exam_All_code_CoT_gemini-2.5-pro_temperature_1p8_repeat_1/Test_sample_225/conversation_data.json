    "The user wants to find the number of self-intersection points for the parametric curve `C(t) = (cos(9t), sin(5t))`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)` is known as a Lissajous curve.\n2.  **Find the relevant formula:** For a Lissajous curve of the form `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`, the number of self-intersection points can be determined by a known formula, provided that `a` and `b` meet certain conditions. The formula for the number of self-intersections is `(a-1)(b-1)`. This formula is valid when `a` and `b` are coprime integers (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n3.  **Check the conditions:** In this case, `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n    *   `a` and `b` are both integers.\n    *   The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is `gcd(9, 5) = 1`, so they are coprime.\n    *   The conditions are met, so the formula is applicable.\n4.  **Calculate the result:** Substitute `a=9` and `b=5` into the formula `(a-1)(b-1)`.\n5.  **Write the Python code:** Create a Python script that defines the parameters `a` and `b`, calculates the number of self-intersections using the formula, and prints the result along with the numbers used in the calculation, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The curve is described by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n# This is a type of curve called a Lissajous curve.\n# For a Lissajous curve of the form x(t) = cos(at), y(t) = sin(bt), the number of\n# self-intersection points is given by the formula (a-1)(b-1), provided that a and b\n# are coprime integers (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\n# Define the parameters 'a' and 'b' from the equations.\na = 9\nb = 5\n\n# First, let's confirm that a and b are coprime. We can do this by finding their greatest common divisor (GCD).\nimport math\ngcd = math.gcd(a, b)\nif gcd != 1:\n    print(f\"The parameters a={a} and b={b} are not coprime (GCD={gcd}), so the formula may not apply.\")\nelse:\n    # Calculate the number of self-intersections using the formula.\n    num_intersections = (a - 1) * (b - 1)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with all its numbers.\n    print(f\"The parameters of the curve are a = {a} and b = {b}.\")\n    print(f\"Since gcd({a}, {b}) = {gcd}, they are coprime and the formula (a-1)*(b-1) can be used.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is: ({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) = {a - 1} * {b - 1} = {num_intersections}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of self-intersection points is {num_intersections}.\")\n\n```\n<<<32>>>"
