    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Dance Techniques:** I will first analyze the core technique of each dance listed in the options. I'll differentiate between the \"swing\" dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) and the \"non-swing\" dance (Tango).\n2.  **Evaluate the \"Reverse Turn\":** The Reverse Turn is a left-turning figure. \"Overturning\" it means turning more than the standard amount. In swing dances, the use of body sway, rise and fall, and continuous momentum makes it possible to \"overturn\" a turn while still adhering to the dance's technique; it's often a recognized variation.\n3.  **Focus on Tango:** The European Tango is unique in this list. Its technique is characterized by a lack of rise and fall, no body sway, a low center of gravity, and sharp, staccato movements. Attempting to generate the extra rotation needed to overturn a reverse turn would force a swinging action and illegal body sway, which fundamentally violates the core technique of the Tango.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script to represent this logic. To satisfy the prompt's requirement of \"output each number in the final equation,\" I will assign a number to the correct option (C is the 3rd option, so it will be number 3) and create a simple addition equation that results in this number. The script will then print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_dance_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes dance techniques to determine which one makes it impossible\n    to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding its technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The options provided in the multiple-choice question.\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrott',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n    \n    # Analysis of the techniques:\n    # Swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) use body sway and momentum\n    # which allow for turns to be overturned as a variation.\n    # Tango's technique is staccato, flat, with no sway, making the physics\n    # of an overturned swing action a violation of its core principles.\n    correct_option_letter = 'C'\n    \n    print(\"Based on dance technique analysis, the correct answer is the European Tango.\")\n    print(\"The reasoning is that Tango's staccato, non-swaying, and grounded nature is fundamentally at odds with the continuous momentum required to overturn a rotational turn.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo meet the puzzle requirements, let's form an equation to identify the correct option number.\")\n    \n    # Option 'C' is the 3rd option in the list.\n    # We will construct an equation that equals 3.\n    num1 = 1\n    num2 = 1\n    num3 = 1\n    result = num1 + num2 + num3\n\n    print(f\"The equation for the correct option is: {num1} + {num2} + {num3} = {result}\")\n    print(f\"The result '{result}' corresponds to the third option, which is option '{correct_option_letter}'.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the correct answer is: {options[correct_option_letter]}\")\n\nsolve_dance_puzzle()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
