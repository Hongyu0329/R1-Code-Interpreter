    This function encapsulates the logic for solving the Go puzzle.
    The analysis of the puzzle is based on common Go life-and-death patterns.
    
    1. White at B2: This is the most direct attack. It puts the {C1, C2} group
       in atari. Black's only local response is B1, which then puts the new
       {B1, C1, C2} group into atari at A1. White plays A1 to capture, which in
       turn puts the A2 stone in atari. The sequence forces black into a series
       of responses that ultimately leads to the capture of the entire group.
       
    2. White at A1: This is another killing move. Black is forced to respond at B2
       to prevent White from sealing the corner. White must then play B1 to save
       the A1 stone. This sequence leads to a position where it is White's move,
       and White can play at A4. The black group is then in atari at A3. Crucially,
       Black's only saving move, B@A3, is an illegal suicide move because the new
       group would have no liberties. Therefore, the group dies.
       
    Other moves like B1 are not kills because they result in a similar board
    position but with Black to play, allowing Black to escape.
    
    The killing moves are therefore A1 and B2.
