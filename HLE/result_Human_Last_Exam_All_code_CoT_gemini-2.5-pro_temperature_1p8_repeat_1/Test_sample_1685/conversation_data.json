    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE in the large x regime:** The given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n    $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n    The initial conditions $y(0)=0$, $y'(0)=3$, $y''(0)=2$ cause the solution to grow very rapidly. This suggests that the solution will have a finite-time singularity, meaning it will blow up to infinity at a specific time $x_0$. In this context, the \"large x regime\" refers to the behavior of the solution as $x$ approaches this singularity time $x_0$.\n\n2.  **Find the approximate analytical form:** To find the form of the solution near the singularity, we use the method of dominant balance. We assume a solution of the form $y(x) = A(x_0 - x)^{-\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha > 0$. By substituting this form into the ODE and comparing the orders of the terms as $x \\to x_0$, we can determine the most dominant terms.\n    The analysis shows that the dominant balance is between $y'''$ and $y^4$. This leads to the following conclusions:\n    *   The power $\\alpha$ must be $1$.\n    *   The coefficient $A$ is given by $A = 6^{1/3}$.\n\n    Thus, the approximate analytical expression for the solution near the singularity is:\n    $y(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{6}}{x_0 - x}$\n\n3.  **Determine the singularity time $x_0$:** The value of $x_0$ depends on the initial conditions of the ODE. It cannot be found by simple analytical means. Therefore, we must use a numerical method. The plan is to:\n    a.  Convert the third-order ODE into a system of three first-order ODEs.\n    b.  Use a robust numerical solver, such as `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` from Python's SciPy library, to integrate the system from the initial conditions.\n    c.  The integration will be stopped when the solution $y(x)$ reaches a very large value, which gives us a numerical estimate for the singularity time $x_0$. This is achieved using the solver's event detection feature.\n\n4.  **Construct the final expression:** Once the numerical value for $x_0$ is found, we will substitute it into the analytical formula along with the value of $A = 6^{1/3}$. Both values will be rounded to two decimal places as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the value of $x_0$ and print the final analytical expression.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\n# Step 1: Explain the purpose of the script.\n# This script finds an approximate analytical solution to the given ODE for large x,\n# which corresponds to the behavior near its finite-time singularity.\nprint(\"Finding the approximate analytical solution...\")\nprint(\"The form of the solution is y(x) = A / (x0 - x), where A = 6^(1/3).\")\nprint(\"We will now numerically compute the singularity time x0.\")\n\n# Step 2: Define the system of first-order ODEs.\n# Let y0 = y, y1 = y', y2 = y''.\ndef ode_system(x, Y):\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines the system of first-order differential equations.\n    Y = [y, y', y'']\n    \"\"\"\n    y0, y1, y2 = Y\n    \n    # The term 1/(tan(x)+1) has singularities, but the solution is expected\n    # to blow up before these are reached.\n    denominator_tan = np.tan(x) + 1\n    \n    y2_prime = y0**4 + y1**4 - y2 / (3 * x**2 + 2) + 1 / denominator_tan\n    return [y1, y2, y2_prime]\n\n# Step 3: Set up initial conditions and numerical integration parameters.\n# y(0) = 0.00, y'(0) = 3.00, y''(0) = 2.00\ninitial_conditions = [0.0, 3.0, 2.0]\n\n# Integration time span.
