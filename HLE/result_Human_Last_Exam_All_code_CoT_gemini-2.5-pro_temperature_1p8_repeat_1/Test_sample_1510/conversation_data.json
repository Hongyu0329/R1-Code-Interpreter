    "The question asks for the number of wallpaper groups whose corresponding point group has an order of 2.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I will establish a comprehensive list of all 17 wallpaper groups and their corresponding point groups (also known as crystal classes). The point groups describe the symmetries of the pattern that leave at least one point fixed.\n2.  Next, I will identify which of the possible 2D crystallographic point groups have an order of 2. The order of a group is the number of elements it contains. In this context, the point groups with order 2 are C2 (rotations by 180 degrees) and D1 (a single reflection).\n3.  Then, I will filter the list of 17 wallpaper groups to find all the ones associated with these order-2 point groups (C2 and D1).\n4.  Finally, I will count the number of groups found for C2 and D1 separately, and then sum these counts to get the total. The Python code below will implement this process, list the identified groups, and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wallpaper_group_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and counts the number of wallpaper groups\n    that have a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define all 17 wallpaper groups and their associated point groups.\n    # The notation for wallpaper groups is Hermann-Mauguin (e.g., 'p1', 'p2mm').\n    # The notation for point groups is Schoenflies (e.g., 'C1', 'D2').\n    wallpaper_groups_data = {\n        'p1': 'C1',\n        'p2': 'C2',\n        'pm': 'D1',\n        'pg': 'D1',\n        'cm': 'D1',\n        'pmm': 'D2',\n        'pmg': 'D2',\n        'pgg': 'D2',\n        'cmm': 'D2',\n        'p3': 'C3',\n        'p3m1': 'D3',\n        'p31m': 'D3',\n        'p4': 'C4',\n        'p4m': 'D4',\n        'p4g': 'D4',\n        'p6': 'C6',\n        'p6m': 'D6',\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: The point groups of order 2 are C2 and D1.\n    # C2 represents a 2-fold rotation.\n    # D1 represents a single reflection.\n\n    # Step 3: Filter the wallpaper groups.\n    groups_with_c2 = []\n    groups_with_d1 = []\n\n    for group_name, point_group in wallpaper_groups_data.items():\n        if point_group == 'C2':\n            groups_with_c2.append(group_name)\n        elif point_group == 'D1':\n            groups_with_d1.append(group_name)\n\n    # Step 4: Print the results and the final calculation.\n    print(\"The point groups of order 2 are C2 and D1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(f\"Number of wallpaper groups with point group C2: {len(groups_with_c2)}\")\n    print(f\"Group(s): {', '.join(groups_with_c2)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(f\"Number of wallpaper groups with point group D1: {len(groups_with_d1)}\")\n    print(f\"Group(s): {', '.join(groups_with_d1)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    total_count = len(groups_with_c2) + len(groups_with_d1)\n    print(\"The total number of wallpaper groups with point group of order 2 is the sum:\")\n    # The final print statement outputs each number in the equation as requested.\n    print(f\"{len(groups_with_c2)} + {len(groups_with_d1)} = {total_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function to solve the problem.\nsolve_wallpaper_group_question()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
