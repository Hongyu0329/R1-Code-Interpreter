It connects the symbols to the Kujiho (nine seals), reinterprets them as 'nine holes' of the body for Taoist rituals, and proposes this was for 'erotic energy'—all concepts that are not well-supported in mainstream historical scholarship on ninjutsu. Unlike the other options (A-G), which rely on singular and well-documented phenomena like censorship, manuscript damage, or known clandestine methods, option H requires a complex chain of speculative esoteric beliefs that were supposedly misunderstood by every single transcriber in the same way. This makes it far less likely than the more straightforward historical and practical explanations.")
