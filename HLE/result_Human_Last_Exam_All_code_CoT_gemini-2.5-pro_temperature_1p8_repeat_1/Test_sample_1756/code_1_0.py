# The following statements about transformer inference are correct.
# A: The effective sampling pool from applying both top-k and nucleus sampling is the intersection of the two, determined by the more restrictive filter.
# C: Temperature Ï„ > 1 flattens the distribution, meaning more tokens are needed to sum to the nucleus probability p, potentially including new tokens.
# E: After truncation and renormalization, the relative probability ratios between the remaining tokens are preserved.
# O: Different GPU architectures have different numerical characteristics, leading to different results in sensitive algorithms like beam search even with fixed seeds.
# P: Minor numerical non-determinism in MoE gating scores can interact with a hard pruning threshold, causing run-to-run variation in which experts are used.
# Q: Determinism requires all components to be deterministic. Even with deterministic MoE routing, non-deterministic attention computations can cause outputs to vary.
# R: Variable tensor shapes (e.g., from padding to different lengths) can cause CUDA libraries to use different, non-bit-exact computation kernels, causing non-determinism.
# X: Parallel computation of attention involves large sums where the floating-point operation order is not guaranteed, changing results slightly and affecting beam search.
# Y: Activation checkpointing recomputes parts of the forward pass. This recomputation can produce numerically different results due to non-deterministic operations.
# The incorrect statements are B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, S, T, W.

# We will now print the sorted list of correct statement letters.
