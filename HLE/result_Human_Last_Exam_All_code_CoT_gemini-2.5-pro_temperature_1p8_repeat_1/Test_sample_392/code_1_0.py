# The chess position is from the FEN: r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/2bBN3/3nn3/8/PPP2qPP/RNBQR2K b Qkq - 0 1
# In this puzzle, Black can force a checkmate. The best sequence is the fastest one.

# The move 1... Ng3+ (from knight on e4) results in an immediate checkmate.
# It's a double check from the queen on f2 and the new knight on g3.
# The white king on h1 cannot move to its only potential escape square g1 because it's attacked by the black queen.
# Since the king has no legal moves and it's a double check, this is checkmate.
# Therefore, option B starts with the correct mating move. The rest of the line is technically incorrect
# as white cannot move after being mated, but B identifies the correct winning move.

# We will print the full sequence from the correct answer choice B.
# Move numbers: 1, 2, 3
# Moves for Black: Ng3+, Qxg3, Qh4#
# Moves for White: hxg3, Qe1
