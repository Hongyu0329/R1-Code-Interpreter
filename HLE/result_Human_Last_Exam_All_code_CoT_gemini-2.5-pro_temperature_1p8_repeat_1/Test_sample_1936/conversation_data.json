    "To find the smallest number `n` for which there exists a set `G` with `n` elements and a binary operation that does not form a group, we need to understand the properties that define a group.\n\nA **group** is a set `G` combined with a binary operation `.` that must satisfy four fundamental properties (axioms):\n1.  **Closure**: For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result `a . b` is also in `G`.\n2.  **Associativity**: For any three elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element**: There exists an element `e` in `G` (the identity element) such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e . a = a . e = a`.\n4.  **Inverse Element**: For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an inverse element `b` in `G` such that `a . b = b . a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nIf a structure `(G, .)` fails to meet even one of these axioms, it is not a group. The problem asks for the smallest possible size `n` of the set `G` where we can define such a non-group structure.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  I will write a Python script to check for the smallest `n`, starting from `n=1`. For a group, the set must be non-empty, so `n` cannot be 0.\n2.  For each `n`, the script will generate all possible binary operations on a set of `n` elements. A binary operation can be conveniently represented by an `n x n` multiplication table (Cayley table). The elements of the set will be represented by `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.\n3.  For each generated operation, the script will check if it satisfies the group axioms.\n4.  The first value of `n` for which we find an operation that fails at least one axiom is our answer. The script will print this `n`, provide the example of the non-group operation table, and explain which axiom it fails.\n\n-   For `n=1`, the set is `{0}`. The only possible operation is `0 . 0 = 0`. The script will verify that this always forms a group (the trivial group).\n-   For `n=2`, the set is `{0, 1}`. The script will test the `2^(2*2) = 16` possible operations. It will quickly find one that is not a group and report `n=2` as the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef check_group_axioms(n, table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given operation table defines a group on the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The number of elements in the set.\n        table: An n x n list of lists representing the operation table.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (is_group, reason), where is_group is a boolean and\n        reason is a string explaining why it is or is not a group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Axiom 1: Closure\n    # Closure is guaranteed by the way the tables are generated, as all\n    # results are in {0, 1, ..., n-1}.\n\n    # Axiom 3: Identity Element\n    identity_element = -1\n    for e in range(n):\n        is_identity_candidate = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            if table[e][i] != i or table[i][e] != i:\n                is_identity_candidate = False\n                break\n        if is_identity_candidate:\n            identity_element = e\n            break\n\n    if identity_element == -1:\n        return False, \"it lacks an identity element\"\n\n    # Axiom 4: Inverse Element\n    for i in range(n):\n        has_inverse = False\n        for j in range(n):\n            if table[i][j] == identity_element and table[j][i] == identity_element:\n                has_inverse = True\n                break\n        if not has_inverse:\n            return False, f\"element {i} does not have an inverse\"\n\n    # Axiom 2: Associativity\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            for k in range(n):\n                # (i . j) . k\n                lhs = table[table[i][j]][k]\n                # i .
