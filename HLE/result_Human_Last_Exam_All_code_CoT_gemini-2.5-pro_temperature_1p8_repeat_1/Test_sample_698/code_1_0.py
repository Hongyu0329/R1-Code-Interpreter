# Description:
# A "True Avalanche" is a pun that repeats a specific pattern of syllables.
# The task is to find the True Avalanche using the word "computer" that fits the description:
# "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."

# Target Word Analysis:
# The word to be used in the pun is "computer".
# The syllables of "computer" are, phonetically: com - pu - ter.

# Answer Choices:
choices = {
    'A': 'Computers comp few urns',
    'B': 'Computer: "Come poo, tern!"',
    'C': 'Computer: "Come, pee you turkey!"',
    'D': 'Comb pewter computer',
    'E': 'Computer needs bird relieves'
}

# Step-by-step Evaluation:
# 1. We need a pun where a phrase sounds like "com-pu-ter".
# 2. The pun must match the context: software (computer) telling a bird what to do.

# Analyzing Choice A: "Computers comp few urns"
# - Syllables: "comp few urns" does not sound like "computer". Fails the phonetic test.

# Analyzing Choice B: 'Computer: "Come poo, tern!"'
# - Syllables: "Come" sounds like "Com". "poo" sounds like "pu". "tern" sounds like "ter".
# - Phonetic Match: "Come poo, tern" is an excellent phonetic match for "computer".
# - Contextual Fit: The sentence depicts a computer giving a command ("Come poo") to a bird (a "tern").
# - Result: This choice is a perfect fit for both the pun structure and the description.

# Analyzing Choice C: 'Computer: "Come, pee you turkey!"'
# - Syllables: "pee you turkey" does not sound like "puter". Fails the phonetic test.

# Analyzing Choice D: "Comb pewter computer"
# - Syllables: "Comb pewter" is a good phonetic match for "computer".
# - Contextual Fit: The phrase "comb pewter" has no connection to software, birds, or commands. Fails the contextual test.

# Analyzing Choice E: "Computer needs bird relieves"
# - This is a simple statement, not a pun with repeating syllables. Fails the structural test for an avalanche.

# Final Conclusion:
# Option B is the only one that works as a pun (repeating the syllables of "computer") AND matches the story.
