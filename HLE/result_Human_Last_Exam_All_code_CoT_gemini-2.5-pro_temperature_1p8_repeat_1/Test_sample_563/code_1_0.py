def solve_automorphism_groups():

    This function provides the number of isomorphism classes of automorphism groups

    The solution is based on established classification results from the mathematical
    literature on algebraic geometry and computational group theory, notably the
    work of T. Breuer and the OEIS sequence A116515.
