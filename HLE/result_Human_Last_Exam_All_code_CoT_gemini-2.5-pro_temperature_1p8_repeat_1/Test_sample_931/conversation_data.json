    "My plan is to address this biological question by encoding known facts about the diet of adult Raphidioptera (snakeflies) into a Python script.\n\n1.  First, I will establish the known food sources for adult snakeflies based on entomological knowledge. They are primarily predators of small, soft-bodied insects like aphids, but they are also known to supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.\n2.  Next, I will represent these facts as boolean variables within the script.\n3.  The script will then systematically evaluate each of the multiple-choice options (A-G) against these established facts.\n4.  Finally, the script will determine and print the most comprehensive and accurate answer based on this evaluation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidioptera to select the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Encode known facts about the diet of adult snakeflies.\n    # Fact: They are predators of soft-bodied insects like aphids.\n    feeds_on_aphids = True\n    # Fact: They supplement their diet with nectar.\n    feeds_on_nectar = True\n    # Fact: They are not herbivores (do not eat leaf tissue).\n    feeds_on_leaf_tissue = False\n    # Fact: They are not primarily fungivores.\n    feeds_on_fungus = False\n    # Fact: They may eat pollen, but specific New Zealand pollen (Māhoe) is a distractor,\n    # as snakeflies are not native to New Zealand.\n    feeds_on_mahoe_pollen = False\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the potential food sources for adult Raphidiopterans based on known facts...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate the provided choices.\n    # Choice A: Nectar\n    print(f\"Checking Choice A (Nectar): Is this a food source? {feeds_on_nectar}\")\n\n    # Choice B: Māhoe pollen\n    print(f\"Checking Choice B (Māhoe pollen): Is this a food source? {feeds_on_mahoe_pollen} (Geographically incorrect)\")\n    \n    # Choice C: Fungus\n    print(f\"Checking Choice C (Fungus): Is this a food source? {feeds_on_fungus}\")\n\n    # Choice D: Karamū leaf tissue\n    print(f\"Checking Choice D (Karamū leaf tissue): Is this a food source? {feeds_on_leaf_tissue} (Incorrect diet type)\")\n    \n    # Choice E: Totara Aphids\n    print(f\"Checking Choice E (Aphids): Is this a food source? {feeds_on_aphids} (Aphids are a primary prey)\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Evaluating combined options:\")\n\n    # Choice F: A and E\n    # Represents feeding on both Nectar and Aphids.\n    option_f_is_correct = feeds_on_nectar and feeds_on_aphids\n    print(f\"Checking Choice F (A and E): Do they eat both Nectar and Aphids? {option_f_is_correct}\")\n    \n    # Choice G: D and E\n    # Represents feeding on both Karamū leaf tissue and Aphids.\n    option_g_is_correct = feeds_on_leaf_tissue and feeds_on_aphids\n    print(f\"Checking Choice G (D and E): Do they eat both Leaf Tissue and Aphids? {option_g_is_correct}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude and present the final answer.\n    final_answer = None\n    if option_f_is_correct:\n        final_answer = \"F\"\n    elif option_g_is_correct:\n        final_answer = \"G\"\n    # Add other checks if necessary, but F is the most comprehensive.\n\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    if final_answer:\n        print(f\"Conclusion: The analysis shows that adult Raphidiopterans feed on both Nectar (A) and Aphids (E).
