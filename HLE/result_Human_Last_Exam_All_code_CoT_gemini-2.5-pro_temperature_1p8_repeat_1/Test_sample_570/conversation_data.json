    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible area for a convex set `K` in the plane that intersects every line `px + qy = 1` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Rephrasing the Condition**: A convex set `K` intersects a line `L` if and only if `K` is not entirely contained in one of the two open half-planes defined by `L`. For the line `px + qy = 1`, this means:\n    `inf_{(x,y) in K} (px + qy) <= 1 <= sup_{(x,y) in K} (px + qy)`\n    This must hold for all pairs of coprime integers `(p, q)`.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Basic Cases**: Let's consider the simplest pairs of coprime integers:\n    *   `(p,q) = (1,0)`: The line is `x = 1`. The condition implies `sup(x) >= 1` for `(x,y)` in `K`.\n    *   `(p,q) = (-1,0)`: The line is `-x = 1` (or `x = -1`). The condition implies `inf(x) <= -1`.\n    *   `(p,q) = (0,1)`: The line is `y = 1`. The condition implies `sup(y) >= 1`.\n    *   `(p,q) = (0,-1)`: The line is `-y = 1` (or `y = -1`). The condition implies `inf(y) <= -1`.\n\n3.  **A Lower Bound for the Area**: From the basic cases, the convex set `K` must have a projection onto the x-axis that contains the interval `[-1, 1]` and a projection onto the y-axis that contains `[-1, 1]`. This means `K` must \"touch\" the four lines `x=1`, `x=-1`, `y=1`, `y=-1`.\n    A known geometric theorem states that any convex set that touches all four sides of a rectangle with width `W` and height `H` must have an area of at least `WH/2`. In our case, the four lines form a square `[-1, 1] x [-1, 1]` with `W=2` and `H=2`.\n    Therefore, the area of `K` must be at least `(2 * 2) / 2 = 2`.\n\n4.  **Finding a Candidate Shape**: Now we need to find a convex domain that satisfies the condition and has an area of 2. A good candidate is the square defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| <= 1`. This square has vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\n\n5.  **Verifying the Candidate**: Let's check if `K = {(x,y) | |x|+|y|<=1}` intersects all lines `px+qy=1` where `gcd(p,q)=1`. The support function of this set is `sup_{|x|+|y|<=1} (px+qy) = max(|p|, |q|)`. Since `K` is centrally symmetric, the minimum value is `min_{|x|+|y|<=1} (px+qy) = -max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    The condition `m_K <= 1 <= h_K` becomes `-max(|p|,|q|) <= 1 <= max(|p|,|q|)`. This simplifies to `max(|p|,|q|) >= 1`.\n    For any pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`, they cannot both be zero.\n    *   If `p=0`, then `gcd(0,q)=|q|` must be 1, so `|q|=1`. Then `max(0,1) = 1`. The condition holds.\n    *   If `q=0`, then `gcd(p,0)=|p|` must be 1, so `|p|=1`. Then `max(1,0) = 1`. The condition holds.\n    *   If neither `p` nor `q` is zero, then `|p|>=1` and `|q|>=1`, so `max(|p|,|q|) >= 1`. The condition holds.\n    The square `|x|+|y|<=1` satisfies the condition for all required lines.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Area**: The area of this square can be calculated using the shoelace formula for polygons given its vertices. The calculation below confirms its area is 2.\n\nSince we found a lower bound of 2 for the area and a shape that achieves it, the minimal area is 2. The following Python code calculates the area of our candidate shape, demonstrating the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the area of the proposed optimal convex polygon\n    and prints the step-by-step calculation using the shoelace formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The minimal area is achieved by the convex polygon with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1).\n    # This shape is described by the inequality |x| + |y| <= 1.\n    vertices = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]])\n\n    # Extract x and y coordinates\n    x = vertices[:, 0]\n    y = vertices[:, 1]\n    \n    # We use the shoelace formula for the area of a polygon:\n    # Area = 0.5 * |(x1*y2 - y1*x2) + (x2*y3 - y2*x3) + ... + (xn*y1 - yn*x1)|\n    # Let's calculate the sum of terms: (x_i * y_{i+1} - y_i * x_{i+1})\n    \n    sum_of_terms = 0\n    \n    print(\"The minimal area is achieved by the convex polygon with vertices (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1).\")\n    print(\"We calculate its area using the shoelace formula: Area = 0.5 * |(x1*y2 - y1*x2) + (x2*y3 - y2*x3) + ... + (xn*y1 - yn*x1)|\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's calculate the terms of the sum one by one:\")\n\n    for i in range(len(vertices)):\n        p1 = vertices[i]\n        p2 = vertices[(i + 1) % len(vertices)]  # Wrap around for the last vertex\n        \n        term_val = p1[0] * p2[1] - p1[1] * p2[0]\n        sum_of_terms += term_val\n        \n        print(f\"Term {i+1} for vertices ({p1[0]},{p1[1]}) and ({p2[0]},{p2[1]}): {p1[0]}*{p2[1]} - {p1[1]}*{p2[0]} = {term_val}\")\n\n    area = 0.5 * abs(sum_of_terms)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe sum of the terms is: {sum_of_terms}\")\n    print(f\"The final equation for the area is: 0.5 * |{sum_of_terms}|\")\n    print(f\"The minimal area is: {area}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
