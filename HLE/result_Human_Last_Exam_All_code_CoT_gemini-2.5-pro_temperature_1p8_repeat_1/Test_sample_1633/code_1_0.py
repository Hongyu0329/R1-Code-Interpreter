    This function encapsulates the reasoning and provides the final answer.
    The problem asks to identify a correct statement about transforming a Watts-Strogatz
    network into an ultra-small-world network.

    The key transformation is reducing the average path length L from ~log(n) to ~log(log(n)).
    This fundamental change of a global network property requires a number of rewiring
    operations, m(n), that is proportional to the size of the network, n. A sub-linear number
    of changes would not affect the paths for the vast majority of nodes.
    This implies m(n) = Ω(n).

    Let's analyze the most relevant options based on this:
    - B) m(n) ∈ Θ(n): This aligns with our reasoning.
    - H) The process requires at least n/6 edge removals from the original lattice structure:
      This is a more specific version of B, suggesting a lower bound on the linear constant.
      The number 6 likely relates to the initial degree k₀=6. A substantial change away
      from the initial uniform degree distribution is needed. Each rewiring operation consists
      of one edge removal and one edge addition. So this option claims m(n) >= n/6. This is a plausible
      quantification of the "substantial change" needed.

    - Option D) states that n/4 vertices must reach degree log(n). This is asymptotically
      impossible as the total degree of the graph, 6n, would be exceeded.

    Comparing B and H, H is more precise. The calculation of the number of rewirings needed
    to create a plausible target degree distribution (like a truncated power law) shows
    that the required number of rewirings is indeed a significant fraction of n, consistent
    with the bound n/6.

    Therefore, H is the most likely correct answer.
