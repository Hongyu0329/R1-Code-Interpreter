# Step 1: Extract the numerical clues from the problem description.
# The word "double" in "double cabriole" implies the number 2.
step_modifier = 2

# The term "Act III" implies the Roman numeral for 3.
act_number = 3

# Step 2: Formulate the equation and calculate the result.
# The problem is a riddle suggesting a calculation. A plausible interpretation
# is that the act number is an exponent for the step modifier.
# This represents 2 to the power of 3.
total_steps = math.pow(step_modifier, act_number)

# Step 3: Print the full equation and the final answer.
# The result needs to be an integer for the number of steps.
final_result = int(total_steps)

print(f"The number of 'double' cabrioles suggests a base number of {step_modifier}.")
print(f"The 'Act III' suggests an exponent of {act_number}.")
print(f"The final calculation is: {step_modifier} ** {act_number} = {final_result}")
