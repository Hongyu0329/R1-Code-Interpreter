# The problem asks for the value of the limit:
# L = lim_{k->inf} [f(k+1) - f(k)]
#
# Our analysis shows that f(k), the minimum number of states,
# grows asymptotically as C*log(k).
#
# The difference f(k+1) - f(k) behaves like the derivative of C*log(k),
# which is C/k. As k approaches infinity, C/k approaches 0.
# Therefore, the limit is 0.
