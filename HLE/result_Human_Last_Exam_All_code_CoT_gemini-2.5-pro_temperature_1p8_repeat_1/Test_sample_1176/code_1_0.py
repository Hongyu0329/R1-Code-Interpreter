def solve_geology_quiz():
    """
    Solves the Cordilleran geology quiz by determining if each statement is
    a consensus (C) or debated (D) view.

    The statements evaluated are:
    (1) The Morrison formation represents a foredeep deposit. (C)
    (2) Metamorphic core complexes formed in response to a slab window. (D)
    (3) An orogenic plateau (the "Nevadaplano") existed in present-day Nevada by the end of the Cretaceous. (D)
    (4) An orogenic plateau in the Arizona portion of the Cordillera (the "Arizonaplano") was constructed via magmatic thickening of the crust in the late Cretaceous. (D)
    (5) Laramide-style structures are generally inboard of Sevier-style structures. (C)
    (6) The Sierra Nevada batholith and Idaho Batholith were formed by the ancestral Cordilleran arc. (C)
    (7) A series of large-magnitude ignimbrite eruptions began in Idaho and Montana in the Eocene and propagated generally to the southwest. (C)
    (8) The Colorado Plateau reached modern elevations by the late Cretaceous, and may have been uplifted further by Cenozoic delamination of mantle lithosphere. (D)
    (9) The Cascades arc reached modern elevation by the late Oligocene, but experienced a Pliocene-present flare-up. (C)
    (10) Laramide-style deformation was caused by subduction of the Shatsky conjugate. (D)

    The function prints the resulting string.
