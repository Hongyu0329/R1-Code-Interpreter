    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of side stickers (non-top-facing) on the last layer of a 3x3 Rubik's Cube that one must observe to uniquely identify which of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases is present.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Understand the Last Layer:** The last layer consists of 8 pieces: 4 corners and 4 edges. Each corner has two side-facing stickers, and each edge has one side-facing sticker. This gives a total of (4 corners * 2 stickers/corner) + (4 edges * 1 sticker/edge) = 12 side stickers.\n\n2.  **Goal of Identification:** We need to gather enough visual information from these 12 stickers to distinguish any of the 21 PLL cases from the other 20. A PLL case is a specific permutation (rearrangement) of these 8 pieces.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Information Needed:** To know the permutation, we need to know where each of the 8 pieces is located.\n    *   **Edges:** An edge piece is uniquely identified by its single side color (e.g., the \"blue edge\"). To know the permutation of all 4 edges, we must see their 4 side stickers.\n    *   **Corners:** A corner piece is identified by its pair of side colors (e.g., the \"blue-red\" corner). Seeing just one sticker (e.g., \"blue\") is not enough, as another corner might also have a blue sticker (e.g., the \"blue-orange\" corner).\n\n4.  **Initial Hypothesis (The \"One Sticker per Piece\" method):** A straightforward approach is to look at one sticker on each of the 8 pieces. This would require seeing **8 stickers**. For example, one could observe the four edge stickers and one sticker from each of the four corners. This method ensures that we gather information about every single piece on the layer.\n\n5.  **Evaluating Lower Numbers:**\n    *   Could we do it with fewer than 8? Let's say we look at 7 stickers. If we observe 7 pieces, the position of the 8th piece is automatically determined (it's in the only remaining spot). So, we need to uniquely identify 7 of the 8 pieces.\n    *   To uniquely identify a corner piece, you often need to see both of its side stickers. If we have a case that permutes three corners (like an A-perm) while leaving the edges in place, we would need to see the colors on those three corners to understand the permutation. To uniquely identify three corners, it might take seeing both side stickers of at least two of them, which is 4 stickers, plus the stickers for the edges.\n\n6.  **The Worst-Case Scenario:** The most difficult cases to distinguish are often those that look very similar from certain angles or those that involve many pieces. For example, distinguishing some G-perms requires looking at patterns on two adjacent faces. To fully resolve all possible ambiguities among the 21 cases, a significant amount of information is needed. The state of all 8 pieces must be determined.\n\n7.  **Conclusion on the Number:** To determine the full permutation of the 8 last layer pieces, one must be able to determine the location of each piece. Seeing one sticker from each of the 4 edge pieces (4 stickers) and one sticker from each of the 4 corner pieces (4 stickers) is a direct way to gather information on all 8 pieces. While a cleverly chosen set of fewer stickers might exist, any set with fewer than 8 stickers risks ambiguity. For instance, if you don't check a particular corner, you can't distinguish a permutation that moves it from one that doesn't. Therefore, to *guarantee* identification across all 21 cases, you need to observe at least one sticker from each of the 8 permutable pieces.\n\nThe number of stickers is the number of pieces being permuted in the last layer.\n\n```python\n# The last layer of a Rubik's Cube has 8 pieces that are permuted during the PLL step.\nnum_corners = 4\nnum_edges = 4\n\n# To fully identify the permutation, we must know the position of each of these pieces.\n# We can determine the position of a piece by looking at at least one of its non-top-facing stickers.\n# Therefore, the minimum number of stickers we need to see is equal to the number of pieces.\ntotal_pieces_to_identify = num_corners + num_edges\n\n# Final calculation\nprint(f\"Number of corner pieces: {num_corners}\")\nprint(f\"Number of edge pieces: {num_edges}\")\nprint(f\"To uniquely identify the location of every piece in the last layer,\")\nprint(f\"one must observe a sticker on each of the {total_pieces_to_identify} pieces.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen is {total_pieces_to_identify}.\")\n\n```\n<<<8>>>"
