    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of orbits of the set of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ under the action of the group of invertible linear transformations, $GL_2(R)$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Represent Quadratic Forms**: A quadratic form $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ over $R$ is determined by its coefficients $(a, b, c)$, where $a, b, c \\in R$. Since $|R| = 8$, there are $8^3 = 512$ such forms in total.\n\n2.  **Represent Linear Transformations**: A linear transformation is given by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $P$ with entries in $R$. The transformation is invertible if its determinant, $\\det(P)$, is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are the integers coprime to 8, which are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. The set of all such invertible matrices forms the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Define the Group Action**: An invertible transformation $P = \\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}$ acts on a quadratic form $Q$ by changing variables. If $Q_1(x, y) = a_1x^2 + b_1xy + c_1y^2$, applying the transformation $x \\to px' + qy', y \\to rx' + sy'$ yields a new form $Q_2(x', y')$. The coefficients of $Q_2$ are given by:\n    *   $a_2 = (a_1p^2 + b_1pr + c_1r^2) \\pmod 8$\n    *   $b_2 = (2a_1pq + b_1(ps+qr) + 2c_1rs) \\pmod 8$\n    *   $c_2 = (a_1q^2 + b_1qs + c_1s^2) \\pmod 8$\n    Two forms are equivalent if they belong to the same orbit under this action.\n\n4.  **Algorithm for Counting Orbits**:\n    a.  Generate the set of all 512 quadratic forms.\n    b.  Generate the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ by finding all $2 \\times 2$ matrices with entries in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ whose determinant is in $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n    c.  Maintain a set of `unclassified_forms`, initially containing all 512 forms.\n    d.  Iteratively pick a form from this set, find all forms in its orbit by applying every matrix in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$, and remove them from `unclassified_forms`. Each such orbit constitutes one equivalence class.\n    e.  The total number of times we perform step (d) is the number of equivalence classes.\n\n5.  **Implementation**: The following Python script implements this algorithm. It will enumerate the equivalence classes, print a representative for each, and output the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_quadratic_form_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring R=Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Generate the group GL(2, Z/8Z)\n    matrices = []\n    units = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n    R = 8\n    for p in range(R):\n        for q in range(R):\n            for r in range(R):\n                for s in range(R):\n                    det = (p * s - q * r) % R\n                    if det in units:\n                        matrices.append(((p, q), (r, s)))\n    \n    gl2_z8 = matrices\n\n    # Step 2: Define the transformation on a form's coefficients (a,b,c)\n    def transform(form, matrix):\n        a, b, c = form\n        p, q = matrix[0]\n        r, s = matrix[1]\n        \n        a_new = (a * p * p + b * p * r + c * r * r) % R\n        b_new = (2 * a * p * q + b * (p * s + q * r) + 2 * c * r * s) % R\n        c_new = (a * q * q + b * q * s + c * s * s) % R\n        \n        return (a_new, b_new, c_new)\n\n    # Step 3: Classify all 512 forms using the orbit counting algorithm\n    all_forms = set()\n    for a in range(R):\n        for b in range(R):\n            for c in range(R):\n                all_forms.add((a, b, c))\n\n    representatives = []\n    \n    while all_forms:\n        # Pick an unclassified form as a new representative\n        rep_form = next(iter(all_forms))\n        representatives.append(rep_form)\n        \n        # Compute the orbit of this representative\n        orbit = set()\n        for matrix in gl2_z8:\n            new_form = transform(rep_form, matrix)\n            orbit.add(new_form)\n            \n        # Remove the entire orbit from the set of unclassified forms\n        all_forms -= orbit\n\n    # Step 4: Print the results in a structured table\n    num_classes = len(representatives)\n    \n    class_details = []\n    for rep in sorted(representatives):\n        a, b, c = rep\n        discriminant = (b*b - 4*a*c) % R\n        \n        terms = []\n        if a != 0: terms.append(f\"{a}x^2\")\n        if b != 0: terms.append(f\"{b}xy\")\n        if c != 0: terms.append(f\"{c}y^2\")\n        \n        if not terms:\n             form_str = \"0\"\n        else:\n             # This creates the equation string with each number\n             form_str = \" + \".join(terms)\n\n        class_details.append({\n            \"rep\": rep,\n            \"form\": form_str,\n            \"D\": discriminant\n        })\n    \n    # Sort by discriminant then by the tuple representation for a canonical ordering\n    class_details.sort(key=lambda x: (x['D'], x['rep']))\n    \n    print(\"Found {} equivalence classes.
