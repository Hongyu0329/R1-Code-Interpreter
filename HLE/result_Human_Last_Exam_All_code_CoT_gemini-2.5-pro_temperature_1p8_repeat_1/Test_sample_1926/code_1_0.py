    This function formulates and prints the answer to the posed question
    in arithmetic geometry based on the Chebotarev density theorem.

    The problem asks for an asymptotic ratio of certain points on a curve.
    Based on the analysis, the question boils down to finding the density
    of points `P` in a projective space `P^r` such that the fiber of a map `f: C -> P^r`
    over `P` has a specific property.

    Assuming "irreducible degree d points" is a non-standard term for fibers that
    split completely into k-rational points, the density is given by the
    Chebotarev density theorem for function fields.

    The density of points whose fiber corresponds to the identity element in the
    Galois group G (i.e., the fiber splits completely) is 1/|G|.
