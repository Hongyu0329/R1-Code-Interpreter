    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we need to analyze the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric**: The spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. We will write down its components in spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$.\n2.  **Recall the Formula**: The Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$, are calculated from the derivatives of the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. The formula is:\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n3.  **Analyze Symmetries and Dependencies**: The Schwarzschild metric is diagonal and its components only depend on the coordinates $r$ and $\\theta$. This greatly simplifies the calculations and means that any Christoffel symbol involving derivatives with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ will be zero, as will many other components.\n4.  **Use Symbolic Computation**: Instead of manually calculating all $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ symbols, which is tedious and prone to error, we can use Python with the `sympy` library. The script will:\n    *   Define the coordinates and the metric tensor symbolically.\n    *   Calculate the inverse metric.\n    *   Systematically compute each Christoffel symbol using the formula.\n    *   Simplify the resulting expressions and check which ones are non-zero.\n    *   Print each non-zero symbol's formula and then the total count.\n\nBy following this plan, we can accurately find all the non-zero components and their expressions.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric,\n    prints each non-zero component's formula, and counts the total number of non-zero components.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the symbolic variables.\n    # We use natural units (c=G=1).
