    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of a given conductor $d$ and order $g$, we can follow a structured approach based on the prime factorization of $d$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Factorize the Conductor `d`:** First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n2.  **Character Decomposition:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a composite number $d = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. For $\\chi$ to be a *primitive* character of conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a *primitive* character of conductor $p_i^{a_i}$. In our case, the factorization of $d$ is square-free ($d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$), which simplifies the problem: a character $\\chi_i$ modulo a prime $p_i$ is primitive if and only if it is not the trivial character (i.e., its order is greater than 1).\n3.  **Order of the Character:** The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\ldots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$.\n4.  **Counting Using Inclusion-Exclusion:** We need to count the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that their orders, let's say $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$, satisfy $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\n    The condition $\\text{lcm}(\\dots) = 6$ is complicated to count directly. Instead, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion on the prime factors of the order $g=6=2 \\times 3$. The formula is:\n    \n    Number = (chars where lcm divides 6) - (chars where lcm divides 3) - (chars where lcm divides 2) + (chars where lcm divides 1)\n    \n5.  **Calculate Each Term:** For a given integer $k$, let's find the total number of character tuples where the lcm of their orders divides $k$. This is true if and only if the order of *each* component character $\\chi_i$ divides $k$.\n    - The number of choices for each $\\chi_i$ is the number of primitive characters modulo $p_i$ whose order divides $k$.\n    - A primitive character modulo a prime $p_i$ must have an order $j>1$ that divides $p_i-1$. The number of such characters of order $j$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(j)$.\n    - So, for each prime factor $p_i$ of $d$, we calculate the number of available primitive characters whose order divides $k$. This is $\\sum_{j | \\gcd(k, p_i-1), j>1} \\phi(j)$.\n    - The total number of tuples for a given $k$ is the product of these counts over all prime factors of $d$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** We will compute each term in the inclusion-exclusion formula and combine them to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = defaultdict(int)\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] += 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] += 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp = n\n    while p * p <= temp:\n        if temp % p == 0:\n            while temp % p == 0:\n                temp //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        result -= result // temp\n    return result\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef count_chars_order_divides_k(p, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts primitive characters mod p whose order divides k.\n    For a prime p, a character is primitive if its order > 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    limit = math.gcd(k, p - 1)\n    divs = get_divisors(limit)\n    count = 0\n    for j in divs:\n        if j > 1: # Primitive characters mod p have order > 1\n            count += phi(j)\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor d and order g.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    d_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    if any(exp > 1 for exp in d_factors.values()):\n        print(f\"Error: Conductor d={d} is not square-free.
