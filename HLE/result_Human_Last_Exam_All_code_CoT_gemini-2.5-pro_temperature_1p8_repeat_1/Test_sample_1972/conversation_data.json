    "The quote you are referring to is from Jorge Luis Borges's prologue to the novel **\"El astillero\"** (\"The Shipyard\") by the Uruguayan author **Juan Carlos Onetti**.\n\nIn that prologue, Borges praises the novel for having \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" He also identifies Onetti as a significant literary heir to William Faulkner, albeit one who simplified and distilled Faulkner's complex style into something uniquely his own.\n\n<<<The novel is \"El astillero\" (\"The Shipyard\") by Juan Carlos Onetti.>>>"
