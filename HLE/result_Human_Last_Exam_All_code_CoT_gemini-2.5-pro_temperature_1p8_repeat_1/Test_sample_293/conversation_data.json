    "Here is a plan to solve the integral:\n1.  First, we will focus on simplifying the integrand, which is an infinite sum: $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$.\n2.  Using the property that the sum of logarithms is the logarithm of the product, we can rewrite the sum as $\\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$.\n3.  We will then use the well-known infinite product identity for the cosine function: $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x}$.\n4.  This simplifies the original integral to $\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x$.\n5.  This is a standard definite integral known in mathematical analysis. Its value is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n6.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that calculates and displays this final value, presenting the symbolic components as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nprint(\"The problem is to evaluate the integral I = integral from 0 to infinity of sum_{n=1 to inf} log(cos(x/2^n)) dx.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 1: Simplify the integrand.\")\nprint(\"The sum S(x) = sum_{n=1 to inf} log(cos(x/2^n)) can be rewritten as the log of a product:\")\nprint(\"S(x) = log( product_{n=1 to inf} cos(x/2^n) )\")\nprint(\"Using the identity product_{n=1 to inf} cos(x/2^n) = sin(x) / x, the integrand becomes:\")\nprint(\"S(x) = log(sin(x) / x)\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Evaluate the resulting integral.\")\nprint(\"The problem is now to evaluate I = integral from 0 to infinity of log(sin(x)/x) dx.\")\nprint(\"This is a known definite integral, and its value is -pi / 2.\")\n\n# Calculate and display the final value.\npi_value = math.pi\nfinal_result = -pi_value / 2\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is: I = -pi / 2\")\nprint(\"The symbolic components of the result are pi and 2.\")\nprint(f\"pi = {pi_value}\")\nprint(f\"2 = {2}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe final numerical value of the integral is: {final_result}\")\n```\n<<<-1.5707963267948966>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the value of integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x$?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
