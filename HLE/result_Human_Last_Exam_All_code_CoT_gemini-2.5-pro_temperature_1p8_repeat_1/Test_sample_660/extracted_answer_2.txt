The empty set. The condition $p(1)F(0) \leq 0$ implies $p(1)F(0) = 0$ as p and F are non-negative, meaning that the preference for lenient auditors is equal for both truthful and untruthful firms. In this case of indifference, it is not guaranteed that more truthful firms choose more lenient auditors. Thus, the set of $\theta$ values for which this condition robustly holds is empty.
