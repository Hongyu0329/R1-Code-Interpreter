    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** First, I need to understand the structure of a \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\". A standard barbell graph connects two identical complete graphs with a single edge. With 10 nodes in total, this means we have two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (two K₅ cliques), connected by one edge. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n\n2.  **Understand the Process:** \"Randomized uniform gossiping\" means that in each round, every node selects one of its neighbors uniformly at random to communicate with. The \"uniform weights\" part confirms this uniform selection.\n\n3.  **Identify Key Nodes and Their Degrees:** The bottleneck edge connects two specific nodes, let's call them 'u' and 'v'. To find the probability of them being selected, we need their degrees (the number of connections they have).\n    *   A node in a K₅ clique is connected to the other 4 nodes in that clique.\n    *   Nodes 'u' and 'v' are also connected to each other via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   So, the degree of 'u' (and 'v') is `4 (in-clique) + 1 (bottleneck) = 5`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Probabilities:** The bottleneck edge is \"sampled\" if either node 'u' chooses to gossip with 'v', OR node 'v' chooses to gossip with 'u'.\n    *   The probability that 'u' selects 'v' is `1 / degree(u)`.\n    *   The probability that 'v' selects 'u' is `1 / degree(v)`.\n    *   Since these selections are made independently by each node, the total probability is `P(u→v) + P(v→u) - P(u→v) * P(v→u)`.\n\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints the final equation and the resulting probability, as requested. I'll use Python's `fractions` module to keep the equation clear and exact.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes during uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the graph parameters.\n    # A barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs (K_k)\n    # connected by a single edge. Thus, 2*k = 10 nodes.\n    total_nodes = 10\n    k = total_nodes // 2\n\n    # 2. Identify the bottleneck edge nodes (u, v) and their degrees.\n    # The bottleneck edge connects a node 'u' in the first K_5 to a node 'v'\n    # in the second K_5.\n    # The degree of such a node is its neighbors within the clique (k-1) plus\n    # the one neighbor across the bottleneck edge.\n    degree_of_bottleneck_node = (k - 1) + 1\n\n    # 3. Calculate the probability of the gossip events.\n    # In uniform gossiping, a node 'u' selects a neighbor 'v' with\n    # probability 1/degree(u).\n    # The sampling event occurs if 'u' selects 'v' OR 'v' selects 'u'.\n    # Let A be the event that 'u' selects 'v'.\n    # Let B be the event that 'v' selects 'u'.\n    \n    # P(A) = 1 / degree(u)\n    p_a = Fraction(1, degree_of_bottleneck_node)\n    \n    # P(B) = 1 / degree(v)\n    p_b = Fraction(1, degree_of_bottleneck_node)\n    \n    # The choices are independent, so the total probability is:\n    # P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B)\n    final_probability = p_a + p_b - (p_a * p_b)\n\n    # 4.
