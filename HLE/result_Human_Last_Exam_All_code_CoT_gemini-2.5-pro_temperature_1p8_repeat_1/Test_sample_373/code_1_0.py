    # 1. Define the graph parameters.
    # A barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs (K_k)
    # connected by a single edge. Thus, 2*k = 10 nodes.
    total_nodes = 10
    k = total_nodes // 2

    # 2. Identify the bottleneck edge nodes (u, v) and their degrees.
    # The bottleneck edge connects a node 'u' in the first K_5 to a node 'v'
    # in the second K_5.
    # The degree of such a node is its neighbors within the clique (k-1) plus
    # the one neighbor across the bottleneck edge.
    degree_of_bottleneck_node = (k - 1) + 1

    # 3. Calculate the probability of the gossip events.
    # In uniform gossiping, a node 'u' selects a neighbor 'v' with
    # probability 1/degree(u).
    # The sampling event occurs if 'u' selects 'v' OR 'v' selects 'u'.
    # Let A be the event that 'u' selects 'v'.
    # Let B be the event that 'v' selects 'u'.
    
    # P(A) = 1 / degree(u)
    p_a = Fraction(1, degree_of_bottleneck_node)
    
    # P(B) = 1 / degree(v)
    p_b = Fraction(1, degree_of_bottleneck_node)
    
    # The choices are independent, so the total probability is:
    # P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B)
    final_probability = p_a + p_b - (p_a * p_b)
