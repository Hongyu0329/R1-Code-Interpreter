    "My plan is to analyze the technical specifics of a cambré derrière (a backward bend) in both the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods. I will compare the two styles against the provided answer choices to identify the most significant and defining difference. The code will then print this step-by-step analysis and state the final correct answer.\n\n1.  **Define Vaganova Technique:** In a cambré derrière, the Vaganova method emphasizes stability and control. The bend should originate from the upper and middle spine, while the hips are kept square and stable over the supporting legs.\n2.  **Define Balanchine Technique:** The Balanchine style often prioritizes creating dynamic, elongated lines. In a backbend, it is characteristic to allow the hip to lift and open, which creates the appearance of a deeper, more dramatic bend.\n3.  **Compare and Conclude:** The most fundamental technical difference is this treatment of the hips. While other elements like speed or head placement can vary with choreography, the hip placement is a core stylistic differentiator. This directly corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the differences between Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière\n    to determine the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Answer choices provided\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    # Step-by-step explanation\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Vaganova method for cambré derrière.\")\n    vaganova_desc = \"\"\"\\\n    The Vaganova method is known for its focus on anatomical precision and core stability.\n    In a cambré derrière, the hips must be kept perfectly square and aligned over the supporting legs.\n    The bend comes from the upper and middle back, maintaining a strong, stable pelvis.\"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(vaganova_desc))\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the Balanchine method for cambré derrière.\")\n    balanchine_desc = \"\"\"\\\n    The Balanchine style emphasizes speed, musicality, and creating dramatic lines.\n    A key characteristic of a Balanchine backbend is allowing the hip to lift and open.\n    This 'breaks' the classical line at the hip to create a deeper and more visually spectacular bend.\"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(balanchine_desc))\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Compare the methods and evaluate the choices.\")\n    conclusion = \"\"\"\\\n    The most significant and defining technical difference is the hip placement.\n    - Vaganova: Hips remain square.\n    - Balanchine: Hip is allowed to lift and open.\n    While the degree of backbend (D) is affected, it is a *result* of the hip placement (B).\n    Therefore, the primary difference is the placement of the hip.\"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(conclusion))\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    final_answer = 'B'\n    print(f\"The correct choice is B: {choices[final_answer]}\")\n    \n    # Final Answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer formatted as requested:\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n```"
