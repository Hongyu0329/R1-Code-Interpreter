    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a specified interval.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the governing equation:** The state of a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is described by the wavefunction ψn(x). The probability of finding the particle at a specific location is given by the probability density, which is the square of the wavefunction: |ψn(x)|².\n    The formula for the normalized wavefunction is:\n    ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n * π * x / a)\n\n    Therefore, the probability density is:\n    P(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n * π * x / a)\n\n2.  **Formulate the calculation:** To find the probability of the particle being in an interval from `x1` to `x2`, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval:\n    Probability = ∫[from x1 to x2] (2/a) * sin²(n * π * x / a) dx\n\n3.  **Apply the given values:**\n    *   Quantum number, n = 2\n    *   Interval start, x1 = 0.495a\n    *   Interval end, x2 = 0.505a\n\n4.  **Use numerical integration:** While this integral can be solved analytically, it's complex. A more direct and reliable method is to use numerical integration. We will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function to perform this calculation. For simplicity, we can set the box length `a = 1.0`, as the 'a' variable cancels out in the final dimensionless probability. The integration will then be performed from 0.495 to 0.505.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the parameters for the particle in a 1D box problem\nn = 2  # The principal quantum number\na = 1.0  # We can set the length of the box 'a' to 1 for simplicity\nx1 = 0.495 * a  # The start of the interval\nx2 = 0.505 * a  # The end of the interval\n\ndef probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the probability density |ψ(x)|² for a particle\n    in a 1D box of length 'a' and quantum state 'n'.\n    The formula is (2/a) * sin^2(n*pi*x/a).\n    \"\"\"\n    return (2.0 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n# Perform the numerical integration of the probability density function\n# over the interval [x1, x2].\n# quad returns the result of the integral and an error estimate.\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.\n# We will print a clear statement showing the parameters used for the calculation\n# and the resulting probability.\nprint(f\"The equation to solve is the integral of (2/a) * sin^2(n*pi*x/a) dx.\")\nprint(f\"For quantum number n = {n}, and box length a:\")\nprint(f\"The probability of finding the particle between x = {x1/a}a and x = {x2/a}a is:\")\nprint(f\"P = {probability}\")\n```\n<<<6.579563942055041e-06>>>"
