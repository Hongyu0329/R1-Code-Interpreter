    Calculates the value of foo(7) based on mathematical analysis.
    The function foo(n) counts the number of group structures on a labeled set of n elements.
    For n=7, a prime number, the only group structure is the cyclic group Z_7.
    The number of such labeled group structures is 7! / |Aut(Z_7)|.
    |Aut(Z_7)| is given by Euler's totient function phi(7) = 7 - 1 = 6.
