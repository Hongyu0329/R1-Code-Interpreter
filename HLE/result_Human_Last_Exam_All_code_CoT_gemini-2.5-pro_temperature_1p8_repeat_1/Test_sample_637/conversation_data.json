    "Here is a plan to design the deadbeat observer:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to design an observer for a discrete-time system. The goal is a \"deadbeat\" observer, which means the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` should converge to zero in the minimum possible number of time steps. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues (poles) of the observer error dynamics matrix, `(A - LC)`, at the origin (i.e., making them all zero).\n\n2.  **Observability Check:** Before we can place the observer poles, we must confirm that the system `(A, C)` is observable. A system is observable if and only if the observability matrix `O = [C; CA; CA^2; ...; CA^(n-1)]` has full rank (`n`, where `n` is the dimension of the state `x`). We will use Python's `numpy` library to construct this matrix and check its rank.\n\n3.  **Pole Placement using Duality:** The problem of finding the observer gain matrix `L` to place the eigenvalues of `A - LC` is known as an observer pole placement problem. This problem is \"dual\" to the state-feedback pole placement problem. We can find `L` by solving for a state-feedback gain `K` for the dual system `(A.T, C.T)`. The desired observer gain will then be `L = K.T`. The goal is to find `K` such that the eigenvalues of `(A.T - C.T @ K)` are placed at the desired locations, which are `{0, 0, 0, 0}` for our deadbeat design.\n\n4.  **Implementation in Python:**\n    *   Define the matrices `A` and `C` using `numpy`.\n    *   Define the target poles as a list of four zeros: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n    *   Use the `scipy.signal.place_poles` function to solve the pole placement problem for the dual system `(A.T, C.T)`. This function is powerful as it can handle multi-input systems.\n    *   The function will return a gain matrix `K`.\n    *   The required observer gain `L` is the transpose of `K`.\n    *   Finally, the code will print the resulting gain matrix `L`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy.signal\n\ndef solve_deadbeat_observer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Designs a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the system matrices\n    A = np.array([\n        [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 0, 0, 2],\n        [0, 1, 0, -1],\n        [-1, 0, 1, -1]\n    ])\n    C = np.array([\n        [1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Get the dimension of the state space\n    n = A.shape[0]\n\n    # Step 1: Check for observability\n    # Construct the observability matrix O = [C; CA; CA^2; ...; CA^(n-1)]\n    O = C\n    A_power_i = A\n    for _ in range(1, n):\n        O = np.vstack([O, C @ A_power_i])\n        A_power_i = A_power_i @ A\n\n    # Calculate the rank of the observability matrix\n    rank_O = np.linalg.matrix_rank(O)\n    \n    if rank_O < n:\n        print(f\"The system is not fully observable (Rank of observability matrix is {rank_O} but n={n}).\")\n        print(\"A deadbeat observer that drives the full state error to zero might not exist.\")\n        # We proceed assuming the unobservable modes are benign (at the origin),\n        # which allows for the design.
