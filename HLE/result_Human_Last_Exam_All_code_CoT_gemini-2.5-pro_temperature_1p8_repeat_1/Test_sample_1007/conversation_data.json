    "In this task, we need to analyze several classical ballet steps to determine which one finishes with the legs in the same position as they started. I will write a Python script to define each step, analyze its movement, and identify the correct one based on whether the final leg position is changed from the initial one.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Create a data structure (a dictionary) to hold information about each ballet step from the answer choices. This information will include a detailed explanation of the step's execution and a boolean flag indicating whether the leg position changes.\n2.  Iterate through this data structure. For each step, print its name and the analysis of its movement.\n3.  Based on the boolean flag, determine if the step starts and ends in the same position.\n4.  After analyzing all the options, print the final conclusion identifying the correct step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one starts and ends in the same position.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps_data = {\n        \"A.
