    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics, we need to solve the system of two quadratic equations:\n1. $164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n2. $864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will treat the two equations as polynomials in the variable `y`, where the coefficients are themselves polynomials in `x`.\n2.  I will then compute the **resultant** of these two polynomials. The resultant is a mathematical tool that eliminates `y` from the system, yielding a single polynomial equation in `x`. The roots of this new polynomial are the x-coordinates of the intersection points.\n3.  The problem then reduces to finding the number of real roots of this resultant polynomial. For each real root `x`, there will be a corresponding real `y` value, so the number of real roots of the resultant polynomial gives the number of real intersection points.\n4.  I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform these algebraic manipulations, as they are too complex to be done by hand. The script will:\n    *   Define the two equations.\n    *   Calculate the resultant polynomial in `x`.\n    *   Print out the coefficients of this final equation as requested.\n    *   Calculate the number of real roots of the resultant.\n    *   Print the final count, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of real intersection points for the two given quadrics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols and the two polynomial equations from the problem\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n    \n    # Equation 1: 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\n    eq1 = 164*x**2 - 216*x*y + 72*y**2 - 16*x + 31\n    \n    # Equation 2: 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\n    eq2 = 864*x**2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y**2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149\n\n    # Treat the equations as polynomials in y, with coefficients being functions of x\n    poly1_y = sympy.Poly(eq1, y)\n    poly2_y = sympy.Poly(eq2, y)\n\n    # Compute the resultant of the two polynomials with respect to y.\n    # The resultant is a polynomial in x whose roots correspond to the x-coordinates\n    # of the intersection points of the original two curves.\n    resultant_poly = sympy.resultant(poly1_y, poly2_y)\n\n    # The final equation we need to solve is resultant_poly = 0.\n    # First, let's display the numbers (coefficients) in this final equation.\n    coeffs = resultant_poly.all_coeffs()\n    degree = resultant_poly.degree()\n    \n    print(\"The elimination of y results in a polynomial equation in x.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):\n        power = degree - i\n        # Format the string for each term of the polynomial\n        if c != 0:\n            term = \"\"\n            if power > 0:\n                if c == -1:\n                    term += \"-\"\n                elif c != 1:\n                    term += f\"{c}*\"\n                term += f\"x^{power}\" if power > 1 else \"x\"\n            else:\n                term += f\"{c}\"\n            equation_parts.append(term)\n    \n    # Print the equation in a readable format, handling signs properly\n    final_equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n    print(f\"{final_equation_str} = 0\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The numbers in this final equation are its coefficients:\")\n    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):\n        print(f\"  Coefficient of x^{degree - i}: {c}\")\n\n    # Now, we find the number of real roots of this resultant polynomial.\n    # This count gives the number of real x-coordinates for the intersections.\n    try:\n        real_x_roots = sympy.real_roots(resultant_poly)\n        num_real_intersections = len(real_x_roots)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"\\nCould not compute real roots due to an error: {e}\")\n        # As an alternative, we can try to solve and count real solutions.\n        all_roots = sympy.solve(resultant_poly, x)\n        num_real_intersections = sum(1 for root in all_roots if root.is_real)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of real roots for x in this equation is {num_real_intersections}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of real intersection points is {num_real_intersections}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_intersection()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
