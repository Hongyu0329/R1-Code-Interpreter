# The problem is a theoretical one in group representation theory.
# We are asked to compute k(B) - l(B) for a block B.
# B is a block of FG where F is a field of characteristic p=2.
# The defect group D is (C_2)^5, which is abelian.
# The inertial quotient E has order 5.

# Let's denote the characteristic as p, the order of the defect group as |D|,
# and the order of the inertial quotient as |E|.
p = 2
defect_group_type = "(C_2)^5"
defect_group_order = 2**5
inertial_quotient_order = 5

# The key information is that the defect group D is abelian and the order
# of the inertial quotient, |E|=5, is not divisible by the characteristic p=2.
# Such an inertial group is called a p'-group.

# A theorem by G. R. Robinson states that for a block B with an abelian
# defect group D and p'-inertial quotient E, the following equality holds:
# k(B) - l(B) = k(E) - l(E)
# where k(E) is the number of irreducible complex characters (or conjugacy classes) of E,
# and l(E) is the number of irreducible Brauer characters (or p-regular conjugacy classes) of E.

# In our case, E is a group of order 5. Since 5 is a prime number, E must be
# the cyclic group C_5.
# Let's compute k(C_5) and l(C_5).

# k(E) is the number of conjugacy classes in E. For a cyclic group,
# this is simply its order.
k_E = inertial_quotient_order

# l(E) is the number of p-regular conjugacy classes of E, where p=2.
# A conjugacy class is p-regular if the order of its elements is not
# divisible by p.
# The elements of E = C_5 have orders that divide 5, so possible orders are 1 and 5.
# Neither 1 nor 5 is divisible by p=2. So, all elements of C_5 are 2-regular.
# Therefore, all conjugacy classes are 2-regular.
l_E = inertial_quotient_order

# Now we can compute the final result.
result = k_E - l_E

# We print the final equation.
print(f"k(B) - l(B) = k(E) - l(E)")
print(f"k(B) - l(B) = k(C_5) - l(C_5)")
print(f"k(B) - l(B) = {k_E} - {l_E}")
print(f"k(B) - l(B) = {result}")
