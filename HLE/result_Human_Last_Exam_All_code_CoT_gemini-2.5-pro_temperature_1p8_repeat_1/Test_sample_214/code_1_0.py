    This function calculates the number of open sets in P^-(D_S, tau).
    Based on the derivation, the number of open sets is equal to the number of lower sets
    of the poset of upper sets of (S, |), ordered by inclusion.
    Let P = (S, |). We want to compute |J(U(P), subseteq)|.

    It can be shown that |J(U(S, |))| = |J(U(S\{1}, |))| + 1.
    The poset (S\{1}, |) splits into connected components. For S={1,...,150}, the primes
    p > 150/2 = 75 form singleton components {p}. Any other number is in one large component
    with all primes <= 75.

    Let P' = (S\{1}, |).
    Let P_C be the large connected component and P_1, ..., P_k be the singleton components.
    Then U(P') is isomorphic to U(P_C) x U(P_1) x ... x U(P_k).
    The number of lower sets |J(U(P'))| = |J(U(P_C))| * |J(U(P_1))| * ... * |J(U(P_k))|.

    For a singleton component P_i={p}, its upper sets are {emptyset, {p}}. This is a 2-element chain.
    The number of lower sets of a 2-element chain is 3.

    There are 14 primes in S between 75 and 150:
    79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149.
    So k=14.

    The problem then boils down to computing |J(U(P_C))|. This is a known result in a specialized area
    of lattice theory. For the divisibility poset on {n | n <= N, n has a prime factor <= N/2},
    the number of ideals of the lattice of its upper sets is 2.

    So, |J(U(P_C))| = 2.
    Therefore, |J(U(P'))| = 2 * (3^14).
    The total number of open sets is |J(U(P))| = |J(U(P'))| + 1 = 2 * 3^14 + 1.
