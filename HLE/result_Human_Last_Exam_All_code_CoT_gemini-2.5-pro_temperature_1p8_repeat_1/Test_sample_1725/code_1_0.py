def solve_crystal_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the answers to the two-part physics problem.

    Part A asks for the dimension of the fibers of a bundle pi, representing local crystal structure.
    This is identified with the dimension of the space of distortion tensors, which are 3x3 matrices.
    Dimension = 3 * 3 = 9.

    Part B asks for the number of coefficients specifying the energy density E.
    The energy is a quadratic form in the dislocation density tensor alpha.
    The number of coefficients is the number of independent quadratic invariants of a rank-2 tensor
    under the specified symmetry. The problem text implies a reduction from cubic to tetragonal symmetry (D4h).
    For tetragonal symmetry, we can decompose the tensor into symmetric (S) and antisymmetric (A) parts.
    Number of invariants for S: 6
    Number of invariants for A: 2
    Total coefficients = 6 + 2 = 8.
