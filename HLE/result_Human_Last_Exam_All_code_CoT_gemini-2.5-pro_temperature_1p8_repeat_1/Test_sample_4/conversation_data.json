    "My plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Lie Algebra Structure**: First, I will analyze the commutation relations of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. This algebra is 6-dimensional and, as I'll show, it is nilpotent. This is a key property.\n\n2.  **Recall Properties of Nilpotent Lie Algebra Cohomology**: For a nilpotent Lie algebra over $\\mathbb{R}$, two important properties hold for its Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$:\n    *   **Poincaré Duality**: The algebra is unimodular, which implies Poincaré duality for its cohomology. For a dimension $n=6$, this means $b_k = b_{6-k}$.\n    *   **Zero Euler Characteristic**: The Euler characteristic of the cohomology, $\\chi(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\sum_{k=0}^6 (-1)^k b_k$, is zero.\n\n3.  **Compute Low-Degree Betti Numbers**: I will compute the first few Betti numbers ($b_0$, $b_1$, $b_2$) by directly using the definition from the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex.\n    *   $b_0$ is always 1.\n    *   $b_1$ is the dimension of the space of closed 1-forms.\n    *   $b_2$ requires a more detailed computation of 2-cocycles and 2-coboundaries.\n\n4.  **Deduce Remaining Betti Numbers**: Using the values for $b_0, b_1, b_2$ along with Poincaré duality, I can find $b_4, b_5, b_6$. Then, the zero Euler characteristic property will allow me to solve for the final unknown Betti number, $b_3$.\n\n5.  **Construct the Poincaré Polynomial**: With all the Betti numbers computed, I will construct the Poincaré polynomial $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^6 b_k x^k$.\n\n6.  **Final Code**: I will write a Python script that implements these steps to calculate the coefficients and then prints the final polynomial in a readable format.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef compute_poincare_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Poincaré polynomial for the given 6-dimensional Lie algebra.\n\n    The Lie algebra g is defined by the commutation relations:\n    [e1, e2] = e3\n    [e1, e3] = e4\n    [e1, e5] = e6\n\n    Let b_k = dim(H^k(g)) be the k-th Betti number.
