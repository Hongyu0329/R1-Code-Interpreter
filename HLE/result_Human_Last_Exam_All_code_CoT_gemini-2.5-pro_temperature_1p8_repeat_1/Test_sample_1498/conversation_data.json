    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the poem specified, which is 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi.\n2.  Next, I will search through the text of the poem to find the specific section where the names of the 25 prophets are enumerated.\n3.  I will determine the starting and ending verse numbers (bayts) for this section based on the standard numbering of the poem.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that declares these start and end numbers and prints them in a clear sentence to answer your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses_range():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of bayts (verses) in\n    the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' where the names of the Prophets are listed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The starting bayt where the names of the prophets are mentioned.\n    start_bayt = 20\n\n    # The ending bayt where the list of prophets' names concludes.\n    end_bayt = 23\n\n    # Print the result in a clear sentence, including the start and end numbers.\n    print(f\"The names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n\nfind_prophet_verses_range()\n```\n<<<20-23>>>"
