def count_answers(graph, k):
    """
    Counts the number of answers for the formula phi_k in a given graph.
    
    The formula is phi_k = x_1,...,x_k exists y: AND_{i=1 to k} E(x_i, y).
    An answer is an assignment to the free variables (x_1,...,x_k) that satisfies the formula.
    This is equivalent to counting k-tuples (v_1,...,v_k) that have a common neighbor.

    The method uses the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion on the sets of answer tuples
    witnessed by each vertex y. The set of all answers is A = U_{y in V} (N(y))^k.
    The size is |A| = sum_{Y subset V, Y!=emptyset} (-1)^(|Y|-1) |intersect_{y in Y} N(y)|^k.
