# Based on the legal analysis, the correct answer choice is determined.
# 1. Bryan's covenants (CEO, sale of business context) are enforceable.
# 2. Ryan's covenants (Shift Manager, non-client facing) are likely unenforceable as they are unreasonable for his specific role, despite the sale context.
# 3. The new employees' non-competes are unenforceable due to statutory prohibitions in Ontario, but the agreements themselves remain valid.
# 4. Bryan's promise to give Stan the truck was a gratuitous promise made without consideration, so it is not a legally enforceable contract.
# This combination of outcomes matches choice A.
