# Step 1: Define the numbers found by deciphering the clues.
Y1 = 1853
Y2 = 27827
Y3 = 5317
Y4 = 584

# Step 2: The final part of the puzzle asks to "calculate the indices".
# This is interpreted as forming a final equation with the discovered numbers.
# We will calculate the sum of all indices.
total = Y1 + Y2 + Y3 + Y4

# Step 3: Print the final equation showing each number.
print(f"The final calculated relationship between the topological state indices is:")
print(f"{Y1} + {Y2} + {Y3} + {Y4} = {total}")
