    Solves the puzzle by finding a consistent set of values for the records.

    The problem contains a contradiction:
    1. If Lost Records (a) = 720/6 = 120,
    2. Then Single-Variant Records (c) = (a/4)^2 = (120/4)^2 = 30^2 = 900.
    3. This is impossible, as the number of readable records is only 720-120=600.

    This means the "1/6" figure is a red herring. We must find the correct value for 'a'
    by solving the system of constraints.

    Let's find 'a' (lost records), 'b' (dual-named), 'c' (single-variant), 'd' (full-imperial).
    Constraints:
    1. sqrt(c) = a / 4  => c = (a/4)^2. 'a' must be a multiple of 4.
    2. sqrt(b) + 3*a = d. 'b' must be a perfect square.
    3. The sum of readable records (b+c+d+80_for_caesar+...) must be <= (720-a).
       b + (a/4)^2 + (sqrt(b)+3a) + 80 <= 720 - a
    4. The sum (a+b+c+d) must be divisible by N=6 (distinct naming patterns).

    From rearranging constraint 3: b + sqrt(b) <= 640 - 4a - (a/4)^2.
    Testing values for 'a' reveals a potential integer solution set at a=72.
    If a=72:
        b + sqrt(b) <= 640 - 4*72 - (72/4)^2
        b + sqrt(b) <= 640 - 288 - 18^2
        b + sqrt(b) <= 352 - 324
        b + sqrt(b) <= 28

    We now test perfect squares for b (let y=sqrt(b), so y^2+y<=28):
    y=1, b=1: 1+1=2 <= 28. Valid.
    y=2, b=4: 4+2=6 <= 28. Valid.
    y=3, b=9: 9+3=12 <= 28. Valid.
    y=4, b=16: 16+4=20 <= 28. Valid.
    y=5, b=25: 25+5=30 > 28. Invalid.

    Now check constraint 4 for a=72 and possible b values.
    The sum S = a+b+c+d must be divisible by N=6.
    c = (72/4)^2 = 324.
    S = 72 + b + 324 + (sqrt(b)+3*72) = 72 + b + 324 + sqrt(b) + 216 = b + sqrt(b) + 612.
    - Test b=1 (y=1): S = 1+1+612 = 614. (614 % 6 != 0)
    - Test b=4 (y=2): S = 4+2+612 = 618. (618 % 6 == 0). This is a solution.
    - Test b=9 (y=3): S = 9+3+612 = 624. (624 % 6 == 0). This is also a solution.
    - Test b=16 (y=4): S = 16+4+612=632. (632 % 6 != 0)

    There appear to be two solutions based on the constraints. A well-formed problem
    usually has a unique solution. Given the puzzle-like nature, the solution
    leading to more "round" or "fitting" numbers is often the intended one. Let's
    check the leftover record counts for each.
    - For b=4: a=72, b=4, c=324, d=sqrt(4)+216=218. Total=72+4+324+218=618. Readable docs known = 4+324+218+80(caesar)=626. Readable records=720-72=648. Others=648-626=22.
    - For b=9: a=72, b=9, c=324, d=sqrt(9)+216=219. (Wait, d=sqrt(9)+3*72 = 3+216=219). Let's recompute sum: S=9+3+612 = 624. d=219. Total = 72+9+324+219=624. Readable docs known = 9+324+219+80=632. Others = 648-632=16.

    Let me recompute `d` for `b=9` carefully.
    `d = sqrt(9) + 3*72 = 3 + 216 = 219`.
    I must have made a typo in my scratchpad (`225`). Let me re-check all `b=9` calculations.
    Sum = a+b+c+d = 72+9+324+219 = 624. 624 is divisible by 6. It's a valid solution.
    Let me check d for b=4. d=sqrt(4)+3*72 = 2+216=218. Sum = 72+4+324+218 = 618. 618 is div by 6.
    The ambiguity remains. However, the calculation for d from my thought process `d=225` must have come from `d=sqrt(81) + ...`. This implies b was 81. Let me check my thought process again. It seems I made an arithmetic mistake and fixed `d` value in my head.

    Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the first valid solution found.
    a = 72
    b = 4
    c = 324
    d = 218
    This is the most logical choice as it's the first one that fits all constraints.
