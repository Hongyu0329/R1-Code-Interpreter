    "Of the six noble gases, their abundance in Earth's atmosphere is the standard measure of their presence in terrestrial matter. I will create a Python script to compare their known abundances to identify the rarest one. The values for these natural abundances have not changed significantly over time, so the data is valid for the year 2002.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Store the atmospheric abundance of each noble gas as a percentage in a dictionary.\n2.  Print the abundance of each gas for clarity.\n3.  Programmatically find the gas with the lowest percentage.\n4.  Print the name of this rarest noble gas as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the rarest noble gas on Earth by comparing their\n    abundances in the atmosphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The abundance of noble gases in Earth's atmosphere as a percentage by volume.\n    # These values are fundamentally constant and were the same in 2002.\n    # Source: CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics & other scientific sources.\n    noble_gas_abundances = {\n        'Helium': 0.00052,\n        'Neon': 0.0018,\n        'Argon': 0.934,\n        'Krypton': 0.000114,\n        'Xenon': 0.0000087,\n        # Radon is a radioactive gas with a highly variable and extremely low concentration.\n        # Its atmospheric percentage is on the order of 10^-19 %, making it the rarest by far.\n        'Radon': 1e-19\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the percentage of each noble gas in Earth's atmosphere.\")\n    for gas, percentage in noble_gas_abundances.items():\n        # Using scientific notation for very small numbers for better readability\n        print(f\"{gas}: {percentage:.{1 if '%' in str(percentage) else '10g'}}%\")\n\n    # Find the gas with the minimum abundance\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundances, key=noble_gas_abundances.get)\n    min_abundance = noble_gas_abundances[rarest_gas_name]\n    \n    # Building the \"equation\" string as requested by showing the numbers to be compared.\n    abundance_list = list(noble_gas_abundances.values())\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Find the minimum value among these percentages.\")\n    print(\"The values being compared are:\")\n    # sys.stdout.write is used to avoid newlines for the \"equation\"\n    sys.stdout.write(\"min(\")\n    for i, val in enumerate(abundance_list):\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{val}\")\n        if i < len(abundance_list) - 1:\n            sys.stdout.write(\", \")\n    sys.stdout.write(\")\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nStep 3: The result of this comparison is {min_abundance}%.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis corresponds to the noble gas: {rarest_gas_name}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_rarest_noble_gas()\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"
