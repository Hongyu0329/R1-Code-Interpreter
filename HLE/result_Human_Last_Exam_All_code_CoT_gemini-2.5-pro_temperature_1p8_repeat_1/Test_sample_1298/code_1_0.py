    print("4. Evaluating Treatment Options:")
    print("   - Supportive care like analgesics (B) or diuretics (H) manages symptoms but not the cancer itself.")
    print("   - Local therapy like radiotherapy (G) would not address the widespread nature of the disease.")
    print("   - Antibiotics (F) and immunosuppression (E) are inappropriate as there is no infection and suppressing the immune system is harmful in cancer.")
    print("   - Systemic therapy is required to treat cancer that has spread throughout the body.")
