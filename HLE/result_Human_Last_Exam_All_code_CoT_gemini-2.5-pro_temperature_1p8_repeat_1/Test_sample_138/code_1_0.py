# This problem asks for the number of positive definite even lattices
# of dimension 17 and determinant 2.
# This is a known result from the mathematical theory of the classification of lattices.

# According to the literature (work by Quebbemann, cited by Nebe),
# these lattices fall into 4 "genera".
# The number of distinct lattices in each genus is its "class number".

# The class numbers for the four genera are known to be 1, 1, 2, and 2.
genus_1_class_number = 1
genus_2_class_number = 1
genus_3_class_number = 2
genus_4_class_number = 2

# To find the total number of such lattices, we sum the class numbers of all possible genera.
class_numbers = [genus_1_class_number, genus_2_class_number, genus_3_class_number, genus_4_class_number]
total_lattices = sum(class_numbers)

# We print the equation showing the sum of the class numbers.
equation = " + ".join(map(str, class_numbers))
print(f"The total number of lattices is the sum of the class numbers of the 4 genera.")
print(f"Calculation: {equation} = {total_lattices}")
