# Step 1: Define the constants based on the problem analysis.
# The analysis of the nonlinear system yields a relationship for the initial
# conditions x0(0), y0(0), z0(0) for which a solution exists.
# The relationship is x0(0)^2 + y0(0)^2 + z0(0)^2 = R^2, which defines a sphere.

# From the problem constraint alpha + beta + gamma = C * (1 - e^-T), we have C = 10^25.
C = 10**25

# The derivation shows that the squared radius of the sphere is R^2 = C / 2.
R_squared = C / 2

# Step 2: Calculate the surface area of the sphere.
# The surface area (A) of a sphere with radius R is given by A = 4 * pi * R^2.
# By substitution, the formula becomes A = 4 * pi * (C / 2) = 2 * pi * C.
factor = 2
area = factor * math.pi * C

# Step 3: Print the numbers used in the final equation and the resulting area.
# The final equation for the area is: Area = 2 * pi * 10^25.
print("The final equation for the area (A) is of the form: A = factor * pi * C")
