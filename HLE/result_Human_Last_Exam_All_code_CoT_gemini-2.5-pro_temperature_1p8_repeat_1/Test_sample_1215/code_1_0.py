    This script solves the logic puzzle by demonstrating the existence of a formula
    phi that satisfies the given conditions and is equivalent to a simpler formula psi
    with the minimum possible number of variables.

    The problem states we need to find the minimum number of variables required
    in a formula 'psi', which is logically equivalent to a formula 'phi', where 'phi':
    1. Has exactly n distinct atomic variables (n >= 2).
    2. Has exactly 2^(n-1) satisfying truth assignments.
    3. Is not a tautology.
    4. For any two distinct satisfying assignments, the assignments are indeed distinct (a vacuous condition).

    Our approach is to find a formula 'phi' that satisfies these conditions but depends on
    the fewest possible variables.
