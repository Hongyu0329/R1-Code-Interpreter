    "My plan is to find the rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids. After analyzing the examples, I've concluded that the transformation follows the rules of a cellular automaton, specifically the \"B23/S23\" rule, also known as \"HighLife\".\n\nHere's the breakdown of the rule:\n1.  The grid is a 2D matrix of cells, which can be either 'live' (1) or 'dead' (0).\n2.  For each cell, we count its 'live' neighbors in the 8 surrounding cells (Moore neighborhood). The grid does not wrap around, meaning cells at the edges and corners have fewer than 8 neighbors.\n3.  The value of a cell in the output grid is determined by the following conditions:\n    *   **Birth (B):** A dead cell (0) becomes a live cell (1) if it has exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors.\n    *   **Survival (S):** A live cell (1) remains a live cell (1) if it has exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors.\n    *   **Death:** In all other cases (a live cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors, or a dead cell with a neighbor count other than 2 or 3), the cell becomes or remains dead (0).\n\nI will now provide a Python script that applies this rule to the given test input grid and prints the resulting output grid.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function applies a cellular automaton rule (B23/S23) to a given grid.\n    - A cell is BORN (0->1) if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors.\n    - A cell SURVIVES (1->1) if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors.\n    - Otherwise, a cell DIES (1->0 or 0->0).\n    The neighborhood is the 8 surrounding cells (Moore neighborhood), without wrap-around.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The sixth test input grid\n    grid = [\n        [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n    ]\n\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the grid to calculate the new state\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Count live Moore neighbors (8 directions)\n            live_neighbors = 0\n            for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    # Skip the cell itself\n                    if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                        continue\n                    \n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    \n                    # Check if the neighbor is within grid boundaries\n                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                        if grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                            live_neighbors += 1\n\n            # Apply the B23/S23 rule\n            current_value = grid[r][c]\n            \n            if current_value == 1:  # Live cell\n                if live_neighbors == 2 or live_neighbors == 3:\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 1  # Survival\n                else:\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 0  # Death by underpopulation or overpopulation\n            else:  # Dead cell (current_value == 0)\n                if live_neighbors == 2 or live_neighbors == 3:\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 1  # Birth\n                else:\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 0  # Stays dead\n\n    # Print the final output grid row by row\n    for row in output_grid:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<1111010011101011000101111>>>"
