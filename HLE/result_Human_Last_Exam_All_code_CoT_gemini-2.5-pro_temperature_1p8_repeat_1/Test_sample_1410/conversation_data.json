    "This is a mate-in-X chess problem. To solve it, I will analyze the board state provided by the FEN string to find the shortest sequence of moves for White to force a checkmate, assuming Black plays optimally to defend.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Position:** I'll examine the threats and opportunities for both White and Black from the FEN: `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`. White is to move. The Black king is under significant pressure from White's Queen, Knight, and Bishop, while White's king is threatened by the Black rook on e1.\n2.  **Identify Candidate Moves:** I will look for White's most forcing moves, such as checks and captures, that advance the attack.\n3.  **Calculate the Mating Sequence:** I will trace the consequences of the most promising move. White's first move should put Black in a position from which they cannot escape checkmate in the following move, regardless of their response.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this step-by-step analysis, showing the move sequence and explaining why it leads to checkmate. The final output will be the number of moves for White to win.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This function is not used for calculation but for demonstrating a structured output\n# in case of future expansion.
