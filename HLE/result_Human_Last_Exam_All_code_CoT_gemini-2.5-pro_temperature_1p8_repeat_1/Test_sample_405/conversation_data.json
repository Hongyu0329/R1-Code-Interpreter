    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n1.  Identify the main, stable, or notable allotropes of pure phosphorus.\n2.  List the distinct color associated with each of these allotropes.\n3.  Write a Python script that enumerates these allotropes and their colors.\n4.  The script will then count and print the total number of distinct colors.\n\n```python\n# The main allotropes of phosphorus each exhibit a distinct color.\n# This script will list them and provide a count.\n\n# A dictionary mapping each allotrope to its characteristic color.\nallotropes_and_colors = {\n    \"White Phosphorus\": \"White (or yellowish)\",\n    \"Red Phosphorus\": \"Red\",\n    \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"Violet\",\n    \"Black Phosphorus\": \"Black\",\n    \"Blue Phosphorus\": \"Blue\" # A 2D allotrope, similar to graphene\n}\n\nprint(\"The main allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors are:\")\nfor allotrope, color in allotropes_and_colors.items():\n    print(f\"- {color}\")\n\n# The total number of colors is the number of allotropes listed.\ncount = len(allotropes_and_colors)\n\n# Building the equation string as 1 + 1 + ... for each color\nequation_numbers = [\"1\"] * count\nequation_string = \" + \".join(equation_numbers)\n\nprint(\"\\nTo find the total number of colors, we sum one for each distinct allotrope:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_string} = {count}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
