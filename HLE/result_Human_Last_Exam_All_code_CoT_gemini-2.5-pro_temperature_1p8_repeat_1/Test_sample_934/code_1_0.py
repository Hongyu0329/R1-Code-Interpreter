    Step-by-step diagnostic reasoning:

    1. Patient Risk Profile: The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of heavy smoking (>40 pack-years) and alcohol use disorder. These are the two strongest and most classic risk factors for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC).

    2. Clinical Presentation: Her symptoms of severe substernal chest pain and odynophagia (pain with swallowing) are alarm symptoms that are highly concerning for an esophageal malignancy.

    3. Laboratory and Imaging Findings: Leukocytosis (high white blood cell count) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) indicate a significant inflammatory process, which can be caused by a response to a tumor. The imaging findings of 'esophageal lumen narrowing' and 'wall thickening' are the most direct evidence pointing towards a mass or an infiltrative cancer within the wall of the esophagus.

    4. Interpretation of Endoscopy: The endoscopic report of a visually normal mucosa (no erythema, ulcers, plaques) is a key finding. While this might seem to rule out cancer, it actually helps pinpoint the likely type. An infiltrative or submucosal cancer can grow within the esophageal wall, causing the thickening and narrowing seen on other imaging, without creating a visible lesion on the surface. This presentation is characteristic of some forms of SCC.

    5. Evaluating the Answer Choices:
       - A, D, E (Infectious esophagitis, GERD): Ruled out or made highly unlikely by the normal-appearing endoscopy. These conditions typically have visible mucosal abnormalities (plaques, ulcers, erythema).
       - B (Esophageal adenocarcinoma): Less likely. The primary risk factor is chronic GERD, which is not in her history.
       - C (Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma): This is the most likely diagnosis. It fits the patient's profound risk factors, alarm symptoms, and the full set of diagnostic findings, including the imaging results that suggest an infiltrative tumor.
