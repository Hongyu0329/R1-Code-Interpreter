    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a given surface code architecture.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand Logical Qubits in Surface Codes:** The number of logical qubits in a surface code patch is determined by its topology. Specifically, for a simple planar patch (a 2D surface), the number of logical qubits is equal to the number of \"holes\" (also called defects or punctures) within it. Each hole allows for the creation of a new, independent logical qubit.\n2.  **Calculate Qubits per Patch:** The problem states that each patch has two holes. Therefore, each patch can encode 2 logical qubits.\n3.  **Calculate Total Qubits:** The problem specifies two independent patches of this surface code. Since the patches are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch. This is equivalent to multiplying the number of patches by the number of logical qubits per patch.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation and the result, as requested.\n\n```python\n# Number of independent surface code patches.\nnum_patches = 2\n\n# Number of holes within each patch.\nnum_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n# In a planar surface code, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be\n# encoded is equal to the number of holes created in the surface.\n# Each hole supports one logical qubit.\nlogical_qubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch\n\n# The total number of logical qubits is the product of the number of patches\n# and the number of logical qubits each patch can encode.\ntotal_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n\n# Print the final calculation as an equation.\n# The equation shows: (number of patches) * (logical qubits per patch) = total logical qubits.\nprint(f\"The final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{num_patches} patches * {logical_qubits_per_patch} logical qubits/patch = {total_logical_qubits} total logical qubits\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
