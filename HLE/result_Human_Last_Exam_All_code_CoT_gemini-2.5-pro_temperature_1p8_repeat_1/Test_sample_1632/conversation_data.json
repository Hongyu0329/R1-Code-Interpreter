    "To find a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (2D square) lattice, we need to count all paths of length 10 starting from the origin that do not visit the same point more than once.\n\nThis problem is a classic combinatorial enumeration problem. Since there is no simple closed-form formula for a(n), we will solve it computationally. The most straightforward approach is to use a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Represent the Walk**: A walk can be represented by a sequence of coordinates `(x, y)`. The walk starts at `(0, 0)`. At each step, we can move one unit up, down, left, or right.\n2.  **Self-Avoiding Condition**: To ensure the walk is self-avoiding, we must keep track of all points visited so far. A `set` is an efficient data structure for this, as it provides fast checking for previously visited points.\n3.  **Recursive Backtracking Algorithm**:\n    *   We will define a recursive function, let's say `count_walks(current_position, visited_points, steps_left)`.\n    *   **Base Case**: If `steps_left` is 0, it means we have successfully formed a valid walk of the desired length. We return 1 to count this path.\n    *   **Recursive Step**: From the `current_position`, we try to move to each of the four neighbors.\n        *   For each neighbor, we check if it is already in the `visited_points` set.\n        *   If it's a new point, we make a recursive call with the neighbor as the new position, an updated set of visited points, and `steps_left - 1`.\n        *   We sum the results from all valid moves to get the total number of paths from the current state.\n4.  **Initial Call**: The process starts from `(0, 0)` with 10 steps to take. The initial `visited_points` set contains only the origin `(0, 0)`.\n5.  **Final Output**: The code will calculate the value of a(10) and print the result in the format `a(10) = result`, which displays the full equation as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_self_avoiding_walks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 10  # The desired number of steps for the walk\n\n    def _count_walks_recursive(current_pos, visited, steps_left):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts valid self-avoiding walks from a given state.\n\n        Args:\n            current_pos (tuple): The (x, y) coordinates of the current position.\n            visited (frozenset): The set of visited points in the current path.\n            steps_left (int): The number of steps remaining.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The total count of valid walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one complete walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        total_walks = 0\n        x, y = current_pos\n\n        # Explore the four possible moves: right, left, up, down.\n        # These are all the neighbors on a Manhattan lattice.\n        for next_pos in [(x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1)]:\n            # Check if the next position has already been visited.\n            if next_pos not in visited:\n                # If the point is new, we continue the walk from there.\n                # We create a new visited set for the recursive call to ensure\n                # paths from different branches don't interfere with each other.\n                total_walks += _count_walks_recursive(\n                    next_pos, visited | {next_pos}, steps_left - 1\n                )\n\n        return total_walks\n\n    # Initial setup for the walk.\n    start_pos = (0, 0)\n    # The initial path contains only the starting point.\n    # We use a frozenset because it is immutable and can be used in sets/dicts if needed.\n    initial_visited = frozenset([start_pos])\n\n    # Start the calculation.\n    result = _count_walks_recursive(start_pos, initial_visited, N)\n\n    # Print the final equation with both numbers N and the calculated result.\n    print(f\"a({N}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve_self_avoiding_walks()\n<<<44100>>>"
