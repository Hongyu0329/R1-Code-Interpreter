    Calculates the second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor.
    
    The local density of the a2 coefficient is proportional to tr(R/6 * I + E),
    where E is the endomorphism from the Lichnerowicz formula for the squared Dirac operator.
    
    The steps are:
    1. Define the endomorphism E for the gauged Dirac operator.
    2. Construct the expression for the a2 density trace.
    3. Evaluate the trace and find the coefficient.
