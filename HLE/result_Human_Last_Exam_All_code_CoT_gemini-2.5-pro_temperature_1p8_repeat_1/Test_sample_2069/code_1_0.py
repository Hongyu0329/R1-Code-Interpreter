  This function derives and prints the two additional inequalities needed to exactly model f(x)
  with the given MILP system.

  The function f(x) is:
  - f(x) = x - 1,       if x >= 1
  - f(x) = 0,           if 0 <= x < 1
  - f(x) = x,           if x < 0

  The existing MILP system uses a binary variable 'a' to handle the switch at x = 1.
  When a = 0 (for x < 1), the system's lower bound on y is too loose. We need to raise it
  from max(l, x-1) to min(0, x).

  We introduce a binary variable 'b', where we can conceptually link b=1 to x>=0 and b=0 to x<0.

  We need to enforce:
  1. y >= 0 when 0 <= x < 1 (where a=0, b=1)
  2. y >= x when x < 0       (where a=0, b=0)

  We can formulate these conditions as two linear inequalities using a big-M approach,
  substituting problem bounds 'l' and 'u' for M.

  Constraint for (1): To enforce y >= 0 when b=1.
  y >= 0 - M1*(1-b). Let M1 = -l. This gives y >= -l*(1-b) => y >= l - l*b.

  Constraint for (2): To enforce y >= x when b=0.
  y >= x - M2*b. Let M2 = u. This gives y >= x - u*b.

  These two constraints are verified to be consistent and correct for the entire system.
  The final python code will print these two inequalities. The format requested requires
  printing each number, so we will use symbolic representations l, u, b, and x.
