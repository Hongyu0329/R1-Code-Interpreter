    "This problem requires mathematical reasoning rather than a computational search, as there are infinitely many finite groups. The plan is to use the properties of maximal product-free sets to constrain the possible groups and then check each case.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Understand the definitions**: We'll start with the definitions of a product-free set and a maximal by inclusion product-free set.\n2.  **Use a key theorem**: A known theorem simplifies the problem significantly. For a set `S = {a, b}` to be a maximal product-free set in a finite group `G`, it's necessary that `G = S ∪ S²`, where `S² = {a², ab, ba, b²}`.\n3.  **Constrain group order**: Based on the theorem, we can determine the possible orders of `G`. The size of `G` will be `|G| = |S| + |S²| = 2 + |S²|`. Since `S²` can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 distinct elements, `|G|` can only be 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n4.  **Examine groups of possible orders**: We will examine the groups for each of these possible orders and see which ones satisfy the condition.\n    *   Order 3: The cyclic group `Z₃`.\n    *   Order 4: The cyclic group `Z₄` and the Klein four-group `V = Z₂ x Z₂`.\n    *   Order 5: The cyclic group `Z₅`.\n    *   Order 6: The cyclic group `Z₆` and the symmetric group `S₃`.\n5.  **Count the groups**: Finally, we will count the number of non-isomorphic groups identified in the previous step.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan by walking through the logical steps and printing the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the logical argument to find the number of finite groups\n    that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Establish the key property ---\")\n    print(\"Let G be a finite group and S = {a, b} be a set of size 2 in G.\")\n    print(\"1.
