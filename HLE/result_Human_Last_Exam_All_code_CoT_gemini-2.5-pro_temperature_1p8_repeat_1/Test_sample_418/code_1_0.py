def count_equivalence_classes():
    """
    This function calculates the number of equivalence classes for a topological space X
    which is the disjoint union of five specified spaces.

    The equivalence relation x ~ y holds if there is an auto-homeomorphism of X sending x to y.

    An auto-homeomorphism of a space must map its connected components to homeomorphic
    connected components. The five spaces are the connected components of X and are not
    homeomorphic to each other. Therefore, any auto-homeomorphism of X must map each
    component to itself.

    This means we can find the number of equivalence classes for each component separately
    and then sum them up.

    An equivalence class in this context is an orbit of the auto-homeomorphism group action.
    If the space is 'homogeneous' (any point can be mapped to any other point by an
    auto-homeomorphism), it has exactly one equivalence class.
