def get_min_trials(n):
    """
    Calculates T(n), the minimum number of trials needed to decide if we have an
    equal number of real and fake golden bars among 2n bars.

    The logic is derived as follows:
    1.  First, create n pairs from the 2n bars and weigh each pair. This takes n weighings.
    2.  If a pair is unbalanced, it's (Real, Fake). If balanced, it's (Real, Real) or (Fake, Fake).
    3.  Let k be the number of unbalanced pairs. The number of balanced pairs is m = n - k.
    4.  The total number of real bars is R = k + 2 * (number of RR pairs). For R=n, we need n-k = 2 * (number of RR pairs).
    5.  If n-k is odd, it's impossible. We are done in n weighings.
    6.  The worst case is when n-k is even, requiring us to solve a subproblem for the m balanced pairs.
        The subproblem takes m-1 weighings for m>1. Total cost = n + (m-1).
    7.  We maximize this cost by finding the smallest k that makes n-k even.
        - If n is even, worst case is k=0, m=n. T(n) = n + (n-1) = 2n-1.
        - If n is odd > 1, worst case is k=1, m=n-1. T(n) = n + (n-1-1) = 2n-2.
        - If n = 1, we can find the answer in 1 weighing.
