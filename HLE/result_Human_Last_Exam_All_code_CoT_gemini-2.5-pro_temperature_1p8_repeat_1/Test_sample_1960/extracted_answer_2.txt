Let `U` be the formula `(1 ⊸ ⊥)`.
The function `f` is defined as: `f(w) = U^w`, where `U^w` is `1` if `w=0`, and the `w`-fold tensor product `U ⊗ ... ⊗ U` if `w>0`.
The formula `C` is: `C(W, m, b) = (U^b)^m`, where `U^b` is the `b`-fold tensor product of `U`, and `(U^b)^m` is the `m`-fold tensor product of `U^b`.
