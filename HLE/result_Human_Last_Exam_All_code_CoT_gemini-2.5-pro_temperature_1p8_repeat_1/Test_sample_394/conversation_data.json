    "Here is my plan to solve this problem.\n1.  Let the sides of the right triangle be `a`, `b`, and the hypotenuse `c`. Since the sides are rational, we can express them in terms of a primitive Pythagorean triple `(m^2-n^2, 2mn, m^2+n^2)` scaled by a rational number `d`.\n    *   `a = d(m^2-n^2)`\n    *   `b = d(2mn)`\n    *   `c = d(m^2+n^2)`\n    Here, `m` and `n` are coprime integers with `m > n > 0` and opposite parity. `d` is a positive rational number.\n\n2.  The area of the triangle is given as 263.\n    *   Area = `(1/2) * a * b = (1/2) * d(m^2-n^2) * d(2mn) = d^2 * mn(m^2-n^2) = 263`.\n\n3.  Let `d = k/s` where `k,s` are positive integers. The equation becomes:\n    *   `(k/s)^2 * mn(m^2-n^2) = 263`\n    *   `k^2 * mn(m^2-n^2) = 263 * s^2`\n\n4.  For this equation to hold, `mn(m^2-n^2)` must be of the form `263 * (\\text{a rational square})`. Since `mn(m^2-n^2)` is an integer, it must be `263` times an integer square.\n    *   Let `mn(m^2-n^2) = mn(m-n)(m+n) = 263 * q^2` for some integer `q`.\n\n5.  Substituting this back, we get `k^2 * (263 * q^2) = 263 * s^2`, which simplifies to `k^2 * q^2 = s^2`, so `k*q = s`.\n\n6.  Now let's express the hypotenuse `c` and find its denominator.\n    *   `c = d(m^2+n^2) = (k/s)(m^2+n^2) = (k/(kq))(m^2+n^2) = (m^2+n^2)/q`.\n\n7.  The denominator of the hypotenuse `c` is `q / gcd(q, m^2+n^2)`.\n\n8.  The problem is now reduced to finding integers `m, n` (with `m>n>0`, `gcd(m,n)=1`, `m, n` of opposite parity) that satisfy `mn(m-n)(m+n) = 263 * q^2` for some integer `q`, such that the resulting denominator `q / gcd(q, m^2+n^2)` is minimized.\n\n9.  Since finding the smallest `m,n` requires searching for rational points on an elliptic curve, which is a non-trivial task, I will provide a Python script to search for integer solutions `(m, n)` up to a specified limit. The script will then calculate `q` and the corresponding denominator of the hypotenuse, keeping track of the smallest one found.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.\"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a number is a perfect square and returns (bool, int_sqrt).\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False, -1\n    if n == 0:\n        return True, 0\n    s = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return s * s == n, s\n\ndef find_smallest_denominator(search_limit_m=4000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for the smallest possible denominator of the hypotenuse.\n    \n    The problem reduces to finding integers m, n such that:\n    m*n*(m*m - n*n) = 263 * q*q for some integer q.\n    The hypotenuse is then c = (m*m + n*n) / q.\n    The denominator of c is q / gcd(q, m*m + n*n).\n    We search for the (m, n) pair that minimizes this denominator.\n    \"\"\"\n    min_denom = float('inf')\n    best_solution = None\n\n    # Search for m and n that define a primitive Pythagorean triple\n    for m in range(2, search_limit_m):\n        for n in range(1, m):\n            # Conditions for primitive triple generators\n            if (m % 2) == (n % 2): # m and n must have opposite parity\n                continue\n            if gcd(m, n) != 1: # m and n must be coprime\n                continue\n\n            # This is the area of the integer Pythagorean triple (m^2-n^2, 2mn, m^2+n^2)\n            # which is Area_int = m * n * (m*m - n*n)\n            # In our case, Area_int = 263 * q^2\n            area_int = m * n * (m*m - n*n)\n            \n            if area_int % 263 == 0:\n                quotient = area_int // 263\n                is_sq, q = is_perfect_square(quotient)\n\n                if is_sq:\n                    hypotenuse_numerator = m*m + n*n\n                    \n                    common_divisor = gcd(q, hypotenuse_numerator)\n                    denominator = q // common_divisor\n\n                    if denominator < min_denom:\n                        min_denom = denominator\n                        best_solution = (m, n, q, denominator)\n\n    if best_solution:\n        m, n, q, denom = best_solution\n        print(f\"Smallest denominator found up to m={search_limit_m}: {min_denom}\")\n        print(f\"Achieved with m = {m}, n = {n}\")\n        a_num = m*m - n*n\n        b_num = 2*m*n\n        c_num = m*m + n*n\n        \n        # We need to simplify the fractions to their lowest terms\n        # Sides are (a_num/q), (b_num/q).
