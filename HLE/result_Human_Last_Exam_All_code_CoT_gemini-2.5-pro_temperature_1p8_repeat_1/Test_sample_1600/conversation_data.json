    "To find the value of `a(3)`, we first need to understand the sequence `a(n)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Sequence:** The problem defines `a(n)` as the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for electron or photon propagators in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). In QED perturbation theory, the order `2n` corresponds to diagrams with `n` loops. The problem mentions \"non-vanishing,\" which in this context usually refers to the topologically distinct one-particle-irreducible (1PI) diagrams that contribute to the calculation.\n\n2.  **Address Ambiguity:** The phrase \"for the electron or the photon propagators\" is ambiguous because the number of diagrams is different for each.\n    *   For the **electron self-energy**, the sequence of the number of diagrams for `n=1, 2, 3` loops is `1, 7, 72, ...`\n    *   For the **photon self-energy** (vacuum polarization), the sequence is `1, 2, 10, ...`\n\n3.  **Resolve Ambiguity:** The calculation of the electron's anomalous magnetic moment (`g-2`), which is intimately related to the electron self-energy diagrams, is one of the most famous and precise tests of QED. The 3-loop (`2n=6`) calculation involves exactly 72 diagrams. Due to its historical and physical significance, it is most likely that `a(n)` refers to the sequence for the electron propagator.\n\n4.  **Determine a(3):** Based on this, we set `a(n)` to be the sequence for the electron self-energy diagrams: `a(1) = 1`, `a(2) = 7`, `a(3) = 72`. The question asks for `a(3)`.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will store the first few terms of this sequence and then retrieve and print the value for `a(3)` in the requested equation format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_diagram_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n=6\n    for the electron propagator in quantum electrodynamics.\n\n    The sequence a(n) represents the number of one-particle-irreducible (1PI)\n    Feynman diagrams for the electron self-energy at n-loop order.\n    The order of the diagram is 2n.\n    \n    The first few terms of the sequence are:\n    a(1) = 1  (for 1-loop, order 2)\n    a(2) = 7  (for 2-loops, order 4)\n    a(3) = 72 (for 3-loops, order 6)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We use a dictionary to store the known values of the sequence a(n).\n    a_n_sequence = {\n        1: 1,\n        2: 7,\n        3: 72,\n    }\n\n    n = 3\n    result = a_n_sequence.get(n)\n\n    # The final output is an equation showing each number, as requested.\n    if result is not None:\n        print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The value for a({n}) is not defined in the sequence.\")\n\nsolve_feynman_diagram_count()\n```\n<<<72>>>"
