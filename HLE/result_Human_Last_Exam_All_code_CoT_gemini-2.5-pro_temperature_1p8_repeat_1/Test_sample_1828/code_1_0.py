    Calculates the difference between the maximal and minimal possible cardinality
    of the set X, based on principles of set theory.

    X: the set of cardinalities of uncountable maximal almost disjoint (MAD) families
       of subsets of omega.
    Given: Continuum hypothesis fails (2^aleph_0 > aleph_1).
    Given: 2^aleph_1 = aleph_3.
    """

    # Step 1: Determine the possible range for the continuum, c = 2^aleph_0.
    # The cardinality of any uncountable MAD family, kappa, is in the range [aleph_1, c].
    # CH fails -> c > aleph_1.
    # By cardinal arithmetic -> c = 2^aleph_0 <= 2^aleph_1.
    # Given 2^aleph_1 = aleph_3 -> c <= aleph_3.
    # So, aleph_1 < c <= aleph_3. The possible values for c are aleph_2 and aleph_3.

    # Step 2: Determine the minimal possible cardinality of X.
    # It is a known result that there is always a MAD family of size c. So |X| >= 1.
    # It is consistent with ZFC to construct a model where c is the only possible
    # cardinality for a MAD family. This occurs when the 'almost disjointness number' a = c.
    # This holds since the possible values for c (aleph_2, aleph_3) are regular cardinals.
    # In such a model, X = {c}, so |X| = 1.
    min_card_X = 1

    # Step 3: Determine the maximal possible cardinality of X.
    # To maximize |X|, we need to maximize the number of available cardinals for MAD families.
    # This is achieved by maximizing c. The maximal value for c is aleph_3.
    # If c = aleph_3, the possible cardinalities are in the set of uncountable cardinals
    # up to aleph_3, which is {aleph_1, aleph_2, aleph_3}. This gives at most 3 values.
    # It is a deep result in set theory (by Shelah) that it is consistent to have a model
    # where MAD families exist for all regular cardinals between aleph_1 and c.
    # Since aleph_1, aleph_2, and aleph_3 are all regular, it's consistent to have
    # X = {aleph_1, aleph_2, aleph_3}.
    # In this case, the size of X is 3.
    max_card_X = 3

    # Step 4: Calculate the difference.
    difference = max_card_X - min_card_X
