    # Part (a): An expression for the minimum number of vertices.
    # For the moduli space to be non-empty, the stability condition 2g - 2 + |A| > 0
    # must hold. If it does, a stable graph with 1 vertex can be constructed.
    # As a graph needs at least one vertex, the minimum is 1.
    answer_a = "1"

    # Part (b): Is M_trop(g,A) a simplicial fan for g = 0?
    # Yes, for g=0, the maximal cones of the fan correspond to trivalent trees.
    # The dimension of these cones equals the dimension of the space, making them
    # simplicial and the overall fan simplicial.

    # Part (c): Is M_trop(g,A) a tropical variety for g > 0? And what is its dimension?
    # Yes, it is the tropicalization of the algebraic moduli space M_g,A.
