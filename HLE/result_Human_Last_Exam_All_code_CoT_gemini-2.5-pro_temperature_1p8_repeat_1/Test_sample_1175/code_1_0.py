# The problem simplifies to calculating the expression (3/2) * 10**(10/3) + 37/4.
# We will compute the value of this expression.

# Define the two terms from the simplified expression
term1 = (3/2) * (10**(10/3))
term2 = 37/4

# Calculate the final result
result = term1 + term2

# We output the numbers in the final simplified equation and the result.
print("The final simplified equation is (3/2) * 10**(10/3) + 37/4.")
print(f"The value of the first term, (3/2) * 10**(10/3), is: {term1}")
print(f"The value of the second term, 37/4, is: {term2}")
print(f"The final equation with the calculated values is: {term1} + {term2} = {result}")
