    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to correctly identify the topological space $X$. The problem describes $X$ as \"the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area\". I will translate this description into a standard construction in mathematics, namely a quotient space of Lie groups.\n2.  Once I have a representation of $X$, say $G/\\Gamma$, I will identify its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X)$. This often involves using known results from topology and geometry, as calculating a fundamental group from first principles can be very complex.\n3.  The first homology group with integer coefficients, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is the abelianization of the fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X)^{ab}$. The abelianization of a group is obtained by dividing the group by its commutator subgroup.\n4.  Using a known presentation of $\\pi_1(X)$, I will compute its abelianization. This is a standard algebraic procedure.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that explains these steps and prints the final result. The core of the \"computation\" will be the algebraic simplification of the group presentation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the steps to compute H_1(X, Z) and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the space X\")\n    print(\"A lattice in R^2 is defined by two linearly independent vectors, which can be the columns of a matrix g in GL(2,R).\")\n    print(\"Two matrices, g1 and g2, define the same lattice if g1 = g2*h for some h in GL(2,Z).\")\n    print(\"The 'unit area' condition restricts g to have |det(g)| = 1.
