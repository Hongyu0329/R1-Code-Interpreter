# This script analyzes three categories fibered in groupoids and determines their properties.

# --- Analysis of X1 ---
# X1(S) corresponds to the Hilbert scheme Hilb_11(A^3), parameterizing 0-dimensional
# subschemes of length 11 in affine 3-space.
# - Type: The Hilbert functor is representable by a scheme. Type: S.
# - Separated (s): Hilbert schemes are always separated.
# - Universally Closed (uc): No, because the underlying space A^3 is not proper.
# - Irreducible (irr): No, Hilb_d(A^n) is known to be reducible for n>=3 and d>=4.
# - Dimension (dim): The dimension of the irreducible component of d distinct points
#   is n*d. While other components can have larger, difficult-to-calculate dimensions,
#   n*d is the standard "naive" dimension.
dim1 = 3 * 11
profile1 = f"[S, s, {dim1}]"


# --- Analysis of X2 ---
# X2 is the quotient stack [(A^4 \ V(xy-zw))/C*] with weights (1,4,2,3).
# - Type: The C* action has points with finite non-trivial stabilizers (e.g., mu_4
#   on the y-axis). Therefore, it is a Deligne-Mumford stack. Type: DM.
# - Separated (s): Quotients of separated schemes by algebraic groups are separated.
# - Universally Closed (uc): No, the base space is not proper.
# - Irreducible (irr): Yes. A^4 is irreducible, and V(xy-zw) is an irreducible
#   hypersurface. The complement of a proper subvariety in an irreducible variety
#   is irreducible.
# - Dimension (dim): dim(base) - dim(group).
dim2 = 4 - 1
profile2 = f"[DM, s, irr, {dim2}]"


# --- Analysis of X3 ---
# X3(S) represents the Picard stack of a genus 7 curve C_0.
# - Type: The automorphism group of any line bundle is G_m, which is a 1-dimensional
#   group. Since the stabilizers are not finite, this is an Algebraic stack. Type: A.
# - Separated (s): The Picard stack of a proper variety is separated.
# - Universally Closed (uc): No. It has infinitely many connected components (indexed by
#   degree) and thus is not of finite type.
# - Irreducible (irr): No, because it is not connected.
# - Dimension (dim): dim = g - 1, where g is the genus.
dim3 = 7 - 1
profile3 = f"[A, s, {dim3}]"

# The final answer is the concatenation of the profiles.
