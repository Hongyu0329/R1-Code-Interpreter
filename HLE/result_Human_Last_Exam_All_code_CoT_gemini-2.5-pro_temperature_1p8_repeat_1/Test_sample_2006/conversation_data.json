    "This riddle is a math puzzle in disguise. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Decode the Clues:** I'll interpret each line of the haiku to extract numerical values and mathematical operations.\n2.  **The Title (\"The Bays\"):** This sounds like \"The Base,\" hinting that the puzzle involves number base conversion.\n3.  **Line 1 (\"An August tempest\"):** August is the 8th month. This will be our base number. So, `base = 8`.\n4.  **Line 2 (\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"):** \"Twice fifteen\" is `2 * 15 = 30`. This is the number that needs to be converted from the base we found in line 1.\n5.  **Line 3 (\"A divine one yields\"):** This line provides the number `1`. The word \"yields\" implies surrendering or giving way, which I'll interpret as a subtraction operation.\n6.  **The Calculation:** The steps combine into a single calculation: Convert the number `30` from `base 8` into a standard decimal number, and then subtract `1`.\n7.  **Find the Final Answer:** The riddle asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order.\" I will convert the final numerical result into its corresponding letter (e.g., 1=A, 2=B, etc.).\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan and reveal the answer.\n\n```python\nimport string\n\n# 1. Decode the clues from the haiku.\n# \"The Bays\" hints at using number bases.\n# \"An August tempest\" gives the base number. August is the 8th month.\nbase = 8\n# \"Twice fifteen\" gives the number to be converted.\nnum_str = \"30\"\n# \"A divine one yields\" provides a number (1) and an operation (yields -> subtract).\nsubtract_val = 1\n\n# 2. Perform the calculation.\n# Convert the number from the given base to decimal (base 10).\n# int(\"30\", 8) calculates 3*8^1 + 0*8^0 = 24.\ndecimal_val = int(num_str, base)\n# Subtract the value from the third line.\nfinal_num = decimal_val - subtract_val\n\n# 3. Convert the final number to its corresponding letter of the alphabet.\n# (A=1, B=2, ..., W=23)\nalphabet = string.ascii_uppercase\nfinal_answer_letter = alphabet[final_num - 1]\n\n# 4. Print the explanation and the final equation.\nprint(\"The haiku translates to a mathematical equation:\")\nprint(f\"The number to convert is {num_str} from base {base}.\")\nprint(f\"The value to subtract is {subtract_val}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{num_str} (base {base}) - {subtract_val} = {decimal_val} - {subtract_val} = {final_num}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe {final_num}rd letter of the alphabet is the answer.\")\nprint(f\"The answer is: {final_answer_letter}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<W>>>\")\n```"
