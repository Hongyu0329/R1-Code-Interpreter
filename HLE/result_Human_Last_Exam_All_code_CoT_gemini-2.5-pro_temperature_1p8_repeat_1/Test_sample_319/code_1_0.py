    This problem is about finding the exponent c in the growth rate O(N^c) of special points.
    A special point is a point q such that the direction spaces of planes passing through it span R^10.
    The direction space of a plane is 2-dimensional.
    To span R^10, we need at least k=5 planes, since 5 * 2 = 10.
    Let's assume a generic configuration of N planes where any 5 planes intersect at a single unique point
    and their direction spaces span R^10.
    The number of special points is then the number of ways to choose 5 planes out of N.
    This gives the number of special points as "N choose 5".
