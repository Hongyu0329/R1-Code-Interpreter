    "My plan to answer this question is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the question to understand that it's a piece of movie trivia about Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film, \"Solaris\".\n2.  Recall or research the central themes and character arcs in the film. The movie heavily explores themes of memory, humanity, and connection to Earth.\n3.  The protagonist, Kris Kelvin, is the character who travels from Earth to the Solaris station. His journey is marked by intense nostalgia and a deep longing for his home world.\n4.  A key element of his nostalgia is his connection to the nature he left behind, symbolized by footage and memories of his father's house, including the sensory experience of rustling leaves. This feeling of missing such a simple, terrestrial sound, to the point of shame, is a core part of his character's emotional state.\n5.  Based on this, I will identify Kris Kelvin as the correct character.\n6.  I will then select the corresponding letter from the provided answer choices.\n7.  Finally, I will write a Python script that states this conclusion and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_solaris_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the character from the 1972 movie Solaris\n    who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character in question is the protagonist, the psychologist Kris Kelvin.\n    # A central theme of the film is his profound homesickness and disconnection\n    # from the natural world he left behind on Earth. His nostalgia is a powerful\n    # force throughout the story, and the longing for simple sounds like\n    # rustling leaves is a poignant expression of this.\n    character_name = \"Kris\"\n    \n    # Mapping the character to the answer choices provided.\n    answer_choices = {\n        \"A\": \"Kris\",\n        \"B\": \"Hari\",\n        \"C\": \"Snaut\",\n        \"D\": \"Sartorius\",\n        \"E\": \"Gibarian\"\n    }\n\n    correct_choice = None\n    for choice, name in answer_choices.items():\n        if name == character_name:\n            correct_choice = choice\n            break\n\n    print(f\"The character from the 1972 movie 'Solaris' who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth is Kris Kelvin.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to answer choice {correct_choice}.\")\n\nsolve_solaris_trivia()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
