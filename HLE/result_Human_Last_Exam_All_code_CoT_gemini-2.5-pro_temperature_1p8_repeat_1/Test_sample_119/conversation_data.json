    "In this chess position, it is Black's turn to move. The White king on `g5` is extremely exposed, which suggests a forced mating sequence is possible. My plan is to find the most forcing sequence of checks for Black that leads to the quickest possible checkmate.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Black's initial checks:** The most promising check for Black is `...h5+`. This move forces the White king away from the center and further restricts its movement.\n2.  **Determine White's forced response:** After `...h5+`, the White king on `g5` cannot move to `f4` or `g4` because those squares are controlled by the Black knight on `e5`. The only legal move for White is `Kh4`.\n3.  **Analyze the new position:** After `1... h5+ 2. Kh4`, the board is set for the final blow. The White king is on `h4`, trapped on the side of the board.\n4.  **Find the mating move:** From this new position, Black can play `2... f6#`. This is checkmate because:\n    *   The White king on `h4` is in check from the Black pawn on `f6`.\n    *   The king has no escape squares: `h3` is controlled by the Black rook on `h2`, `g3` is blocked by its own pawn, `g5` is controlled by the Black pawn on `g6`, and `h5` is controlled by the Black pawn on `h5`.\n    *   The check cannot be blocked, and the checking pawn on `f6` cannot be captured.\n\nThis sequence, a mate in two moves, is the shortest possible mating sequence.\n\nHere is the Python code to print the move sequence.\n\n```python\ndef find_chess_mate_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the shortest mating sequence for black from the given position.\n    \n    The sequence is a mate in 2 moves, determined through analysis.\n    1. Black's move: h5+ (This forces the white king to h4)\n    2. White's move: Kh4 (The only legal move)\n    3. Black's move: f6# (This is checkmate)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The moves of the shortest mating sequence.\n    black_move_1 = \"h5+\"\n    white_response = \"Kh4\"\n    black_move_2 = \"f6#\"\n\n    # Combine the moves into the required format.\n    final_sequence = [black_move_1, white_response, black_move_2]\n\n    # Print the sequence of moves.\n    print(\" \".join(final_sequence))\n\nfind_chess_mate_sequence()\n```\n<<<h5+ Kh4 f6#>>>"
