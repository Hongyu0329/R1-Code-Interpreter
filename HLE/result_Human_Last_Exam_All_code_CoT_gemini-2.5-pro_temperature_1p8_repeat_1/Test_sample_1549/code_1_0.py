    Calculates the compactness degree [X] for X = [0,1]^3.

    The solution is based on a theorem by de Groot relating the compactness
    degree of a space to its covering dimension.

    Theorem: For a separable metrizable space X, the compactness degree [X] is
    given by the formula: [X] = dim(X) + 1, where dim(X) is the covering
    dimension of X.

    The space X = [0,1]^3 is a separable metrizable space, so the theorem applies.
