def solve_crypto_question():
    """
    Analyzes the provided multiple-choice question about digital signatures.

    The main challenge is interpreting the premise: "For an existentially forgeable
    digital signature scheme (e.g. ECDSA belongs to this family)". Standard ECDSA is
    existentially UNFORGEABLE (EUF-CMA), the standard security level. However, ECDSA is
    known to be MALLEABLE, meaning it's not secure under a stronger definition called
    Strong Existential Unforgeability (SUF-CMA). Given a signature (r, s), (r, -s) is
    also a valid signature for the same message.

    The most reasonable interpretation is that the question uses "existentially forgeable"
    to refer to schemes like ECDSA that are EUF-CMA secure but NOT SUF-CMA secure.
    We analyze the options based on this interpretation.
