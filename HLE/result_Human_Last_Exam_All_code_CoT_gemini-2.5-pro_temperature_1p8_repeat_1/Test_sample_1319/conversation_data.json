    "Here is a plan to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus:\n\n1.  **Identify Mountains**: First, I will compile a list of the prominent historical mountains mentioned in Homer's Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus as per the request. These are Mount Athos, Mount Ida (the one near Troy), Mount Pelion, and Mount Samothrace.\n2.  **Gather Elevation Data**: Next, I will find the current-day summit elevations for each of these mountains.\n    *   Mount Athos: 2,033 meters\n    *   Mount Ida: 1,774 meters\n    *   Mount Pelion: 1,624 meters\n    *   Mount Samothrace: 1,611 meters\n3.  **Process and Compare**: I will write a Python script to store this data. The script will then process the data to find the mountain with the highest elevation.\n4.  **Output the Result**: Finally, the script will print a clear statement showing the comparison of all the mountain elevations and identify the tallest one as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_iliad_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Store mountains and their elevations (in meters).\n    mountains = {\n        'Mount Athos': 2033,\n        'Mount Ida': 1774,\n        'Mount Pelion': 1624,\n        'Mount Samothrace': 1611\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Find the mountain with the maximum elevation.\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains, key=mountains.get)\n    tallest_mountain_elevation = mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    # Step 4: Output the comparison and the result.\n    # The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.\n    print(\"Comparing the elevations of mountains from the Iliad (excluding Olympus):\")\n    \n    # Get all elevation values for the \"equation\" part.\n    elevations = list(mountains.values())\n    \n    print(f\"The elevations considered are: {mountains['Mount Athos']}m (Athos), {mountains['Mount Ida']}m (Ida), {mountains['Mount Pelion']}m (Pelion), and {mountains['Mount Samothrace']}m (Samothrace).\")\n    \n    # Printing the \"equation\" as a comparison of all numbers\n    print(f\"\\nThe comparison equation is: max({elevations[0]}, {elevations[1]}, {elevations[2]}, {elevations[3]}) = {tallest_mountain_elevation}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nAfter Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is {tallest_mountain_name}.\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_tallest_iliad_mountain()\n\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
