    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation for the partition function Z using the path integral formalism, followed by a Python script to display the final result.\n\n### My Plan\n\nI will solve for the grand canonical partition function `Z` using the path integral formalism as requested. My plan involves three main steps:\n1.  First, I will set up the path integral with the appropriate Euclidean action for the given Hamiltonian `H^ = -μN^`.\n2.  Second, I'll simplify the action and show that the path integral is a standard Gaussian integral over bosonic fields.\n3.  Third, I will evaluate this integral by calculating the corresponding functional determinant, which will lead to the final expression for `Z`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **The Path Integral and the Action**\n\n    The grand canonical partition function `Z` is defined by the trace `Z = Tr[exp(-β(H^ - μN^))]`. In the path integral formalism, this trace is expressed as an integral over all possible configurations of a complex bosonic field `ψ(τ)` (where `τ` is imaginary time) that are periodic over the interval `τ ∈ [0, β]`.\n    \n    `Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-S[ψ*, ψ])`\n\n    The Euclidean action `S` is determined by the grand canonical Hamiltonian `K^ = H^ - μN^`. For a single mode system, the action is:\n    \n    `S = ∫_0^β dτ [ψ*(τ)∂_τψ(τ) + K(ψ*, ψ)]`\n\n2.  **Substituting the Hamiltonian**\n\n    The problem provides the system's Hamiltonian as `H^ = -μN^`. We substitute this into the expression for the grand canonical Hamiltonian `K^`:\n\n    `K^ = H^ - μN^ = (-μN^) - μN^ = -2μN^`\n\n    In the path integral, the number operator `N^` is replaced by the product of fields `ψ*ψ`. Therefore, `K(ψ*, ψ) = -2μψ*ψ`. The action becomes:\n\n    `S = ∫_0^β dτ [ψ*(τ)∂_τψ(τ) - 2μψ*(τ)ψ(τ)]`\n    \n    We can factor out the fields to get:\n    \n    `S = ∫_0^β dτ [ψ*(τ) (∂_τ - 2μ) ψ(τ)]`\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Gaussian Integral and the Determinant**\n\n    The action `S` is quadratic in the fields `ψ*` and `ψ`. This means the path integral is a standard Gaussian integral. The result of a Gaussian path integral is the inverse of the determinant of the operator in the quadratic form.\n\n    `Z = [det(∂_τ - 2μ)]⁻¹`\n\n    To evaluate this functional determinant, we need the eigenvalues of the operator `(∂_τ - 2μ)` acting on periodic functions. This is a standard result in quantum field theory. The determinant of an operator of the form `(-∂_τ + E)` for periodic bosonic fields is given by `1 - exp(-βE)`.\n\n    Our operator is `(∂_τ - 2μ)`, which can be written as `-(-∂_τ + 2μ)`. Ignoring the overall sign which affects normalization, we can identify `E = 2μ`. Substituting this into the standard formula gives:\n\n    `det(∂_τ - 2μ) = 1 - exp(-β(2μ)) = 1 - exp(2βμ)`\n\n4.  **Final Result**\n\n    Finally, we substitute the value of the determinant back into our expression for `Z`:\n\n    `Z = 1 / det(∂_τ - 2μ) = 1 / (1 - exp(2βμ))`\n\n    This expression represents a geometric series that converges only when `|exp(2βμ)| < 1`. Since `β = 1/(k_B T)` is positive, this condition requires that the chemical potential `μ` must be negative (`μ < 0`).\n\nBelow is the Python code that prints out the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef print_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the derived partition function Z in a formatted way.\n    The equation includes numerical constants and symbolic representations of\n    physical quantities.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the integer constants that appear in the final equation.\n    const_1 = 1\n    const_2 = 2\n\n    # Define unicode characters for the physical symbols for better readability.\n    beta_symbol = \"\\u03B2\"  # β for inverse temperature\n    mu_symbol = \"\\u03BC\"    # μ for chemical potential\n\n    # Print the final equation for the partition function Z.\n    print(\"The partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian H = -μN is:\")\n    print(f\"Z = {const_1} / ({const_1} - exp({const_2} * {beta_symbol} * {mu_symbol}))\")\n    \n    # Add the condition for the validity of the result.\n    print(f\"\\nNote: This result is valid for {mu_symbol} < 0.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_partition_function()\n```\n<<<Z = 1 / (1 - exp(2*β*μ))>>>"
