    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Problem:** The problem asks for the number of Tverberg partitions for a specially constructed set of points $X$. The key information is that for this specific set $X$, *every* Tverberg partition corresponds to a single partition of the integer $n$ into parts $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r$. This is a strong condition that simplifies the problem significantly. It means we don't need to engage with the geometric aspects of Tverberg's theorem. Instead, the problem reduces to a standard combinatorial counting question: \"How many ways can we partition a set of $n$ distinct items (the points in $X$) into $r$ unlabeled subsets of specified sizes $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r$?\"\n\n2.  **The Combinatorial Formula:** The number of ways to partition a set of $n$ elements into unlabeled subsets of sizes given by the multiset $\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r\\}$ is calculated in two steps:\n    *   **Step A: Multinomial Coefficient:** First, we calculate the number of ways to partition $n$ distinct items into $r$ *labeled* or *distinct* subsets of sizes $a_1, \\dots, a_r$. This is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n      $$ \\binom{n}{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r} = \\frac{n!}{a_1! a_2! \\dots a_r!} $$\n    *   **Step B: Adjust for Unlabeled Subsets:** Since the Tverberg subsets are unlabeled (the order doesn't matter), we must correct for overcounting. If some of the subset sizes are identical (e.g., we have three subsets of size 2), we have counted permutations of these identical-sized subsets as distinct, but they are not. To correct this, we divide by the product of the factorials of the counts of each size. For example, if there are $m_k$ subsets of a certain size $s_k$, we divide by $m_k!$. The final formula is:\n      $$ \\text{Number of partitions} = \\frac{1}{\\prod_k m_k!} \\times \\frac{n!}{\\prod_i a_i!} $$\n      where $m_k$ is the number of times a particular part size appears in the partition list `a`.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   I will write a Python script that takes a list `a = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_r]` as input.\n    *   The script will use the `math.factorial` function for factorials and `collections.Counter` to find the frequencies ($m_k$) of the part sizes.\n    *   To fulfill the request, the code will print out each part of the formula with the numerical values substituted, showing the intermediate steps and the final result. I will use the example partition `a = [4, 2, 2, 1]` to demonstrate the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_partitions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to partition a set of n points into\n    unlabeled subsets of specified sizes.\n\n    The problem states that for a given partition of n, a_1, ..., a_r, there\n    exists a set of n points X for which *every* Tverberg partition has part\n    sizes corresponding to a_1, ..., a_r. This simplifies the problem to a\n    combinatorial one: counting the number of ways to partition the n labeled\n    points of X into unlabeled subsets with the given sizes.\n\n    The formula is: (n! / (a_1! * a_2! * ...)) / (m_1! * m_2! * ...),\n    where n is the total number of points, a_i are the sizes of the parts,\n    and m_j is the count of parts of a certain size.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Example: A partition of n points into parts of given sizes.\n    # For this to be a valid Tverberg partition in R^d, each part size a_i\n    # must be at most d+1.
