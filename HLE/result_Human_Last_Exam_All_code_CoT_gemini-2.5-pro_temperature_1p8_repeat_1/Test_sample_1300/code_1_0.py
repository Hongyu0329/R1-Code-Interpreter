def solve():
    """
    This function designs a molecule based on a complex set of constraints and verifies its properties.
    The constraints provided are numerous and some appear contradictory, particularly regarding the number of tertiary amines and hydrogen bond acceptors.
    After extensive exploration of chemical space, it's concluded that a molecule satisfying ALL constraints simultaneously is unlikely under standard chemical definitions.
    The proposed solution is a molecule that satisfies the vast majority of key constraints, including molecular formula, weight, atom counts, ring structures, and most functional groups.
    The plan is to:
    1. Define the SMILES string for the candidate molecule. This molecule was designed to meet the atom count, weight, and major structural features.
    2. Use the RDKit library to create a molecule object from the SMILES string.
    3. Calculate all the properties requested in the prompt:
        - Heavy atom count
        - Molecular weight (monoisotopic)
        - Formal charge
        - Valence electron count
        - Aromatic ring count
        - Presence of specific rings (benzene, imidazole)
        - Heteroatom count and type
        - Hydrogen bond donor/acceptor count (using Lipinski's definitions)
        - Rotatable bond count
        - Presence of required functional groups (imine, phenolic OH) by checking SMARTS patterns.
    4. The prompt asks for a "final equation" showing each number. This will be implemented by printing a comparison of the target value and the calculated value for each property.
    5. The discrepancy regarding the "three tertiary amines" constraint will be noted, as the designed molecule does not contain them, suggesting a possible ambiguity or error in the problem description.
