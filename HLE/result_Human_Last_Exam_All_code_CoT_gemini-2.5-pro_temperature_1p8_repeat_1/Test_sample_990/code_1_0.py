# Step 1 & 2: Derive acceleration (as outlined in the plan above).
# The key result from the physics derivation is that the raindrop experiences
# a constant acceleration, a = g/7. This result assumes the raindrop starts
# with negligible initial mass. The densities rho and Rho cancel out during
# the derivation.

# Step 3: Calculate the time of fall using kinematics.

# The height 'h' is given as 350 * g meters.
h_factor = 350

# The constant acceleration 'a' is g / 7.
a_factor_numerator = 1.0
a_factor_denominator = 7.0

# The kinematic equation is h = (1/2) * a * t^2.
# Substituting the expressions for h and a:
# (h_factor * g) = (1/2) * (a_factor_numerator / a_factor_denominator * g) * t^2

# We can solve for t^2:
# t^2 = 2 * h_factor / (a_factor_numerator / a_factor_denominator)
t_squared = 2 * h_factor * a_factor_denominator / a_factor_numerator

# Calculate the final time t by taking the square root.
time_of_fall = math.sqrt(t_squared)
