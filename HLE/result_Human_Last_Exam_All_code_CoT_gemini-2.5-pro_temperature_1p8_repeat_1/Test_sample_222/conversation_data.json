    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Request**: The request asks for the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence `{x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}`. A direct DFT is not possible since the sequence length (8) does not match the DFT length (4). I will interpret this using a standard method in digital signal processing: creating a 4-point sequence from the 8-point one by aliasing in the time domain. This is done by \"folding\" the second half of the 8-point sequence and adding it to the first half. This operation has a clear correspondence in the frequency domain.\n\n2.  **Find the Time-Domain Sequences**: I will first find the original 4-point sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)` by applying the Inverse DFT (IDFT) to the given `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\n3.  **Construct the Sequences**:\n    *   First, I will create the 8-point interleaved sequence, let's call it `y_8pt(n)`.\n    *   Then, I will create the 4-point aliased sequence `y_4pt(n)` by calculating `y_4pt(n) = y_8pt(n) + y_8pt(n + 4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final DFT**: I will compute the 4-point DFT of the resulting `y_4pt(n)` sequence.\n\n5.  **Present the Result**: I will display the final 4-point DFT, which we'll call `Y(k)`, by printing each of its complex-valued components in a clear, equation-like format.\n\nThis method correctly uses all the information given and resolves the ambiguity in the problem statement in a way that is consistent with digital signal processing principles.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef format_complex_clean(c):\n    \"\"\"Formats a complex number into a clean string like 'a + bj'.\"\"\"\n    # Round to handle potential floating point inaccuracies\n    real = round(c.real, 2)\n    imag = round(c.imag, 2)\n\n    # Check if parts are integers for cleaner output\n    if real == int(real):\n        real = int(real)\n    if imag == int(imag):\n        imag = int(imag)\n\n    if imag == 0:\n        return str(real)\n    if real == 0:\n        if imag == 1: return \"j\"\n        if imag == -1: return \"-j\"\n        return f\"{imag}j\"\n    \n    sign = \"-\" if imag < 0 else \"+\"\n    imag_abs = abs(imag)\n    \n    if imag_abs == 1:\n        return f\"{real} {sign} j\"\n    else:\n        return f\"{real} {sign} {imag_abs}j\"\n\n# Given 4-point DFTs as numpy arrays\nX_k = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\nH_k = np.array([0, 1+1j, 1, 1-1j])\n\n# Step 1: Find the 4-point sequences x(n) and h(n) using the Inverse DFT\nx_n = np.fft.ifft(X_k)\nh_n = np.fft.ifft(H_k)\n\n# Step 2: Construct the 8-point interleaved sequence y_8pt(n)\n# y_8pt(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}\ny_8pt = np.zeros(8, dtype=complex)\ny_8pt[0::2] = x_n\ny_8pt[1::2] = h_n\n\n# Step 3: Create a 4-point sequence y_4pt(n) by aliasing (folding and adding)\ny_4pt = y_8pt[:4] + y_8pt[4:]\n\n# Step 4: Compute the 4-point DFT of the aliased sequence\nY_k = np.fft.fft(y_4pt)\n\n# Step 5: Print the final result in the specified format\nprint(\"The final equation for the 4-point DFT, Y(k), is:\")\nprint(f\"Y(0) = {format_complex_clean(Y_k[0])}\")\nprint(f\"Y(1) = {format_complex_clean(Y_k[1])}\")\nprint(f\"Y(2) = {format_complex_clean(Y_k[2])}\")\nprint(f\"Y(3) = {format_complex_clean(Y_k[3])}\")\n\n# Construct the final answer string\nfinal_answer_list = [format_complex_clean(c) for c in Y_k]\nfinal_answer_str = f\"[{', '.join(final_answer_list)}]\"\nprint(f\"\\n<<<[{final_answer_list[0]}, {final_answer_list[1]}, {final_answer_list[2]}, {final_answer_list[3]}]>>>\")\n\n```"
