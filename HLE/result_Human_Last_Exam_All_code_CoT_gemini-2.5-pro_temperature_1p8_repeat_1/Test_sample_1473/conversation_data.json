    "My plan to solve this integral is as follows:\n1.  First, I will simplify the term `arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc^2(x)))` within the integrand. By setting `y = arctan(sin(x))` and using trigonometric identities, I can show that this term simplifies to `arctan(sin(x))`.\n2.  With this simplification, the integral becomes $I = \\int_0^{\\pi} \\frac{\\arctan(\\sin x)}{\\sin x} dx$.\n3.  I will then use the symmetry property of definite integrals. Since the integrand $f(x) = \\frac{\\arctan(\\sin x)}{\\sin x}$ is symmetric about $x=\\pi/2$ (i.e., $f(\\pi-x)=f(x)$), the integral can be rewritten as $I = 2 \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\arctan(\\sin x)}{\\sin x} dx$.\n4.  To solve this new integral, I will employ Feynman's trick (differentiation under the integral sign). I'll define a parameterized integral $J(a) = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\arctan(a \\sin x)}{\\sin x} dx$.\n5.  I will differentiate $J(a)$ with respect to $a$, which results in a simpler integral: $\\frac{dJ}{da} = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{dx}{1+a^2 \\sin^2 x}$.\n6.  This integral can be solved using a standard substitution (like the Weierstrass substitution or by converting to tan), yielding $\\frac{dJ}{da} = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{1+a^2}}$.\n7.  Next, I'll integrate $\\frac{dJ}{da}$ with respect to $a$ to find $J(a)$. The result is $J(a) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\ln(a + \\sqrt{1+a^2}) + C$.\n8.  The constant of integration $C$ is found to be zero by evaluating at $a=0$.\n9.  Finally, our original integral is $I = 2J(1)$. By substituting $a=1$ into the expression for $J(a)$, I can determine the final value of $I$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the step-by-step symbolic evaluation of the integral\n    I = integral from 0 to pi of csc(x) * arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)^2)) dx.\n    The evaluation uses simplification, symmetry, and Feynman's trick.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Problem: Determine the value of I = integral from 0 to pi of (csc x) * (arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc^2(x)))) dx\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 1: Simplify the integrand\n    print(\"Step 1: Simplify the integrand.\")\n    print(\"Let y = arctan(sin(x)).
