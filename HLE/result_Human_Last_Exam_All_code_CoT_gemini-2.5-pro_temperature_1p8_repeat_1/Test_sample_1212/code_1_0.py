    This function returns the solution to the Go puzzle.
    The puzzle asks for all possible first moves for White that lead to a kill.
    
    Based on the analysis:
    1. B2: This move directly fills the vital eye space of the Black group, killing it.
    2. A3: This move prevents a second eye. If Black responds at B2 to make one eye, White's follow-up at B1 will seal the kill.
    3. B1: Similar to A3, this prevents a second eye. If Black responds at B2, White's follow-up at A3 will kill the group.
    
    Thus, the killing moves are B2, A3, and B1.
