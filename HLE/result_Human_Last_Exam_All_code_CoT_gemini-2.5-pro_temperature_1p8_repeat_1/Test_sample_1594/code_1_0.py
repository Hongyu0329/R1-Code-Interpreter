# The two highschools, Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini,
# are located next to each other in Pisa.
# When viewed from above on a map, their buildings are arranged in a specific way.
# - The Liceo Scientifico "Ulisse Dini" forms the left vertical bar.
# - The Istituto Tecnico Industriale "G. Galilei" forms the right vertical bar.
# - A connecting structure between them forms the horizontal crossbar.
# This combination clearly forms a letter.
