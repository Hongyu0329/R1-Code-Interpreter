# Define the numbers from the Roman numeral equation
num1 = 109  # CIX
num2 = 30   # XXX
num3 = 3761 # MMMDCCLXI

# Calculate the result following the order of operations (division then subtraction)
result = (num1 / num2) - num3

# Print the full equation in modern numbers along with the solution
print(f"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}")
