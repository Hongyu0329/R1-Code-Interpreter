    "I will solve this problem by first converting the Roman numerals into modern numbers.\n1.  **CIX**: 'C' is 100 and 'IX' is 9 (10 - 1). So, CIX is 100 + 9 = 109.\n2.  **XXX**: 'X' is 10. So, XXX is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30.\n3.  **MMMDCCLXI**: 'MMM' is 3000, 'DCC' is 700 (500 + 100 + 100), 'LX' is 60 (50 + 10), and 'I' is 1. So, MMMDCCLXI is 3000 + 700 + 60 + 1 = 3761.\n\nThe equation becomes `109 / 30 - 3761`.\n\nFollowing the order of operations (division first, then subtraction), the calculation is:\n1.  `109 / 30 ≈ 3.6333...`\n2.  `3.6333... - 3761 ≈ -3757.3667...`\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers from the Roman numeral equation\nnum1 = 109  # CIX\nnum2 = 30   # XXX\nnum3 = 3761 # MMMDCCLXI\n\n# Calculate the result following the order of operations (division then subtraction)\nresult = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Print the full equation in modern numbers along with the solution\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-3757.366666666667>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
