    Solves the checkout line problem using the properties of the exponential distribution.

    The problem states that the probability of completing checkout is constant per second.
    This describes a process modeled by the exponential distribution, which has a key
    property: it is "memoryless".

    The memoryless property means that the expected future waiting time is independent
    of the time already spent.

    We are given that the expected checkout time for any customer is 10 minutes. This
    sets the mean of our distribution.
