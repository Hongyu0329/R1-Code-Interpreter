# The number of terminal pairs in the Multicut problem.
k = 10**6

# --- Theoretical Background ---
# The Multicut problem is NP-hard.
# A polynomial-time O(log k)-approximation algorithm exists (Garg, Vazirani, Yannakakis).
# This is asymptotically tight, as an Omega(log k) hardness of approximation is also known.
# This means we cannot expect a better approximation factor like O(sqrt(log k)) or a constant factor.

# --- Calculations ---
# We calculate the values for log(k) and sqrt(log(k)) to match them with the answer choices.
# The options' values suggest the use of the natural logarithm (math.log in Python).
approximation_factor = math.log(k)
unachievable_factor = math.sqrt(approximation_factor)

# --- Output the result ---
print(f"For the Multicut problem with k = {int(k)} terminal pairs:")
print(f"The best achievable approximation factor in polynomial time is O(log k).")

# Output for Option C's claim
print(f"An approximation of alpha <= log(k) is achievable.")
print(f"Calculation: log({int(k)}) = {approximation_factor:.1f}")

# Output for Option B's claim
print(f"\nAn approximation of alpha <= sqrt(log(k)) is not known to be achievable in polynomial time.")
print(f"Calculation: sqrt(log({int(k)})) = {unachievable_factor:.1f}")

print("\nTherefore, the correct statement is that we cannot get an alpha <= sqrt(log k) approximation, but we can get an alpha <= log k approximation.")
