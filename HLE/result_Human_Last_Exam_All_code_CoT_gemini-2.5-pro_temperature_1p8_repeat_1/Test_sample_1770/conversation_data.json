    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you need to identify and knock out the gene responsible for the first step in its catabolic pathway. This pathway breaks down phenolic acids like p-coumaric acid.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the key enzyme that initiates the degradation of p-coumaric acid.\n2.  Identify the specific gene in *Corynebacterium glutamicum* that codes for this enzyme.\n3.  Use a Python script to print this information, explaining the reasoning for the knockout.\n\nThe script below will outline the logic and state the target gene.\n\n```python\ndef find_knockout_gene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the gene knockout strategy\n    to prevent p-coumaric acid degradation in Corynebacterium glutamicum.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    product = \"p-coumaric acid\"\n    organism = \"Corynebacterium glutamicum\"\n    \n    print(f\"Goal: Prevent the degradation of {product} in {organism}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the first step of the degradation pathway.\")\n    print(f\"The degradation of {product} is initiated by an enzyme that removes a carboxyl group (decarboxylation).\")\n    print(f\"This reaction converts {product} into 4-vinylphenol, which is then further metabolized.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Identify the enzyme and the corresponding gene.\")\n    print(\"The enzyme responsible for this reaction is Phenolic Acid Decarboxylase (PAD).\")\n    print(f\"In {organism}, the gene that encodes for this enzyme is known as 'padC'.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"By knocking out the padC gene, you will eliminate the Phenolic Acid Decarboxylase enzyme.\")\n    print(f\"This will block the degradation pathway at its first step, causing your desired product, {product}, to accumulate in the cell.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"The target gene for knockout is: padC\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_knockout_gene()\n```\n<<<padC>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    You want to engineer Corynebacterium glutamicum to produce p-coumaric acid so you introduce the appropriate biosynthetic genes.
