    "My plan is to identify the two Nobel laureates who appeared in the specified Enron commercial. I will write a Python script that stores their names as strings in variables. Then, the script will use the `print` function to display these names, directly answering the user's question.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify two Nobel laureates from a 2000 Enron commercial.\n# We will store their names in variables and then print them.\n\n# Storing the names of the Nobel laureates\nlaureate_one = \"Paul Krugman\"\nlaureate_two = \"William F.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
