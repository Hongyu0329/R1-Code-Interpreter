    "The Chern number is a topological invariant, and for weakly coupled systems, it is additive. When two Chern insulators are joined together, the Chern number of the resulting system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nIn this case, we have two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1. To find the Chern number of the junction, we simply add their individual Chern numbers.\n\n*   Chern number of the first insulator (C1) = 1\n*   Chern number of the second insulator (C2) = 1\n*   Total Chern number of the junction (C_total) = C1 + C2\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers of the two individual insulators\nC1 = 1\nC2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\n# Print the equation and the final result\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the first insulator is: {C1}\")\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the second insulator is: {C2}\")\nprint(\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"Equation: {C1} + {C2} = {C_total}\")\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is: {C_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
