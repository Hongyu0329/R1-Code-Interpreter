# Step 1: Define the known topological properties of the Mobius band.
# chi is the Euler characteristic.
# k is the number of boundary components.
chi = 0
k = 1

# Step 2: Calculate the non-orientable genus (g) using the formula chi = 2 - g - k.
# This can be rearranged to g = 2 - chi - k.
g = 2 - chi - k

# Step 3: Calculate the number of failing forests using the formula N = 2^(g-1).
# This formula is from advanced results in algebraic combinatorics for non-orientable surfaces.
num_failing_forests = int(math.pow(2, g - 1))

# Step 4: Print the steps and the final answer.
