def calculate_minimax_lower_bound(n, delta, N, kl_divergences, phi):
    """
    Calculates a lower bound on the minimax risk R_n^* using Le Cam's method
    and Pinsker's inequality.

    The derivation follows these steps:
    1. The minimax risk is bounded by the Bayes risk for a specific hypothesis set.
    2. The estimation problem is reduced to a hypothesis test between H0: P=P_0 and 
       H1: P is drawn from a mixture of {P_1,...,P_N}.
    3. The risk is bounded by the testing error, which relates to the total variation
       distance between the distributions under H0 and H1.
    4. Pinsker's inequality bounds the TV distance with KL divergence.
    5. The KL divergence of the mixture is bounded by the average of individual KLs.

    The final bound is: R_n^* >= (Phi(delta/2) / 2) * (1 - sqrt(n * K_avg / 2))
    where K_avg = (1/N) * sum(D_KL(P_j || P_0) for j=1..N).

    This bound is non-trivial only if n * K_avg < 2.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of i.i.d. datapoints.
        delta (float): The minimum separation rho(theta(P_0), theta(P_j)).
        N (int): The number of alternative hypotheses P_1, ..., P_N.
        kl_divergences (list[float]): A list of KL divergences [D_KL(P_1||P_0), ..., D_KL(P_N||P_0)].
        phi (callable): The non-decreasing loss function component Phi.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated lower bound. Returns 0.0 if the bound is trivial.
