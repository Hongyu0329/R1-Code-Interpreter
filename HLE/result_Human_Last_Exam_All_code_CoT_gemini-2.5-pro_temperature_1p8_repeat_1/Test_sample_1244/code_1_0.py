def solve():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the lattice theory problems.

    (a) Is it true that an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can have farness exactly 2?
    A positive-definite even unimodular lattice must have a rank that is a multiple of 8.
    Rank 12 is not a multiple of 8, so no such lattice exists.
    An indefinite lattice cannot be a neighbor of the positive-definite Z^n.
    Thus, no such lattice exists.

    (b) Suppose L is an odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 with far(L) = 3. Can L have a vector x ...?
    A positive-definite odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 is, up to isometry, unique. It is Z^14.
    The farness of Z^14 is 1. The premise far(L)=3 is a contradiction.
    No such lattice exists.

    (c) If an even unimodular lattice L in R^24 has a visible root system of type D_24, what is the smallest d for which L can be a d-neighbor of Z^24?
    The lattice L is the Niemeier lattice with root system D_24.
    L and Z^24 share a common sublattice, the root lattice D_24, of index 2 in both.
    This makes them 2-neighbors. Farness must be greater than 1, so the smallest d is 2.
