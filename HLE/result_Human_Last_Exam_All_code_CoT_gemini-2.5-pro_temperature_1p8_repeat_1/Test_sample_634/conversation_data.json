    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. This method involves forming a stacked matrix M by combining P1 and P2, and then reducing this matrix using elementary polynomial row operations. The goal is to transform the matrix M into the form `[G; 0]`, where G is the GCRD.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 1: Form the stacked matrix M.**\nWe stack P1 on top of P2 to get a 4x2 matrix M:\nM = [R1; R2; R3; R4]\nR1 = [s^2 + s, -s]\nR2 = [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\nR3 = [s, 0]\nR4 = [-s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 2: Perform elementary row operations to simplify M.**\nWe look for relationships between the rows to simplify the matrix. Observe the relationship between R1 and R4. If we multiply R4 by `-s`, we get:\n-s * R4 = -s * [-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s, -s] = R1.\nThis means R1 is a polynomial multiple of R4. Therefore, we can eliminate R1 by the elementary row operation `R1' = R1 + s*R4`.\nR1' = [s^2 + s, -s] + s*[-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] = [0, 0].\nThe matrix becomes:\nM' = [0, 0;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2;\n      s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 3: Reduce the remaining non-zero rows.**\nWe now work with the reduced 3x2 matrix. Let's use the last row `R4 = [-s - 1, 1]` to eliminate the `s^2` term in `R2 = [-s^2 - 1, s^2]`. We perform the operation `R2' = R2 - s^2*R4`:\nR2' = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2*[-s - 1, 1]\n    = [-s^2 - 1 - (-s^3 - s^2), s^2 - s^2]\n    = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0]\n    = [s^3 - 1, 0]\nThe matrix system is now equivalent to:\nM'' = [s^3 - 1, 0;\n       s, 0;\n       -s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 4: Reduce further.**\nThe first two rows have a zero in the second column. We can simplify them by finding the greatest common divisor of their first elements, `s^3 - 1` and `s`. Using the polynomial Euclidean algorithm:\n`s^3 - 1 = (s^2) * s - 1`\nThe remainder is -1. This means their GCD is 1 (a constant). We can write `1 = s^2*(s) - 1*(s^3 - 1)`.\nThis allows us to form a row `[1, 0]` by the operation `s^2*R3 - R2'`:\ns^2*[s, 0] - [s^3 - 1, 0] = [s^3 - (s^3 - 1), 0] = [1, 0].\nSo, the first two rows can be replaced by `[1, 0]`, and the system becomes equivalent to:\nG_intermediate = [1, 0;\n                  -s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 5: Final simplification to canonical form.**\nThis matrix `G_intermediate` is a valid GCRD. However, we can simplify it further into a more standard form (row-echelon form). We perform one last row operation: `R2'' = R2 + (s+1)*R1`:\nR2'' = [-s - 1, 1] + (s+1)*[1, 0]\n     = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1 + 0]\n     = [0, 1]\nThe final simplified GCRD matrix is:\nG = [1, 0;\n     0, 1]\n\nThis is the 2x2 identity matrix. When the GCRD is the identity matrix (or any unimodular matrix), the original matrices are called right co-prime.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem is to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD)\n# of two polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n# Through the matrix Euclidean algorithm (performing row operations on the stacked matrix [P1; P2]),\n# we found that the GCRD is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n# The elements of the GCRD matrix G(s)\ng11 = 1\ng12 = 0\ng21 = 0\ng22 = 1\n\n# Create the matrix using a list of lists\nG = [[g11, g12],\n     [g21, g22]]\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(\"The greatest common right divisor is the matrix G(s) where:\")\nprint(f\"g11(s) = {G[0][0]}\")\nprint(f\"g12(s) = {G[0][1]}\")\nprint(f\"g21(s) = {G[1][0]}\")\nprint(f\"g22(s) = {G[1][1]}\")\nprint(\"\\nSo the GCRD matrix is:\")\n# Use numpy for pretty printing the matrix, though it's not strictly necessary.\n# For simple cases, manual formatting is also fine.\ntry:\n    print(np.array(G))\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(f\"[[{g11}, {g12}],\")\n    print(f\" [{g21}, {g22}]]\")\n\n```\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
