    "To determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source**: I will base my answer on data from miRBase, which is the authoritative and primary repository for microRNA sequence data and annotation.\n2.  **Define \"Family Member\"**: The term \"let-7 family member\" typically refers to mature miRNAs with distinct sequences. While some members are encoded by multiple genes at different locations in the genome (e.g., let-7a is encoded by three genes), they produce the same mature miRNA. The family also includes miR-98, which is highly homologous in sequence and function.\n3.  **List the Members**: I will list the canonical members of the human let-7 family based on their distinct mature identifiers.\n4.  **Write Python Code**: I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Stores the list of identified let-7 family members in a list.\n    *   Calculates the total number of members by finding the length of the list.\n    *   Prints each member's name and the final total count.\n\n```python\n# The let-7 family is a group of microRNAs known for their role as tumor suppressors.\n# The number of members is based on the distinct mature miRNA sequences identified in humans.\n# This information is cataloged in miRBase, the central miRNA database.\n\n# List of the distinct members of the let-7 family in humans (Homo sapiens),\n# including the closely related miR-98.\nlet7_family_members = [\n    \"let-7a\",\n    \"let-7b\",\n    \"let-7c\",\n    \"let-7d\",\n    \"let-7e\",\n    \"let-7f\",\n    \"let-7g\",\n    \"let-7i\",\n    \"miR-98\"\n]\n\n# Calculate the total number of members in the family.\ntotal_members = len(let7_family_members)\n\n# Print the final result.\nprint(\"The following members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans:\")\nfor member in let7_family_members:\n    print(f\"- {member}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTotal number of members: {let7_family_members[0]} + {let7_family_members[1]} + ... gives {total_members}\")\nprint(f\"There are {total_members} identified members in the human let-7 family.\")\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
