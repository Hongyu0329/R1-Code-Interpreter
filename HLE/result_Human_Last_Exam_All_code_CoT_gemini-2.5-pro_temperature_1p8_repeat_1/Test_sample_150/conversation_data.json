    "No, the provided Java program does not solve the problem correctly.\n\n### Analysis of the Submitted Program\nThe problem specifies that an operation can be written in any order, which means there are four possible statements: `++X`, `X++`, `--X`, and `X--`.\n\nThe Java code contains this logic:\n```java\nif (test.contains(\"++X\"))\n{\n    tresult++;\n}\nif (test.contains(\"--X\"))\n{\n    tresult--;\n}  \n```\nThis logic is flawed because `test.contains(\"++X\")` will only be true for the string `\"++X\"` but not for `\"X++\"`. Similarly, it will not correctly handle `\"X--\"`. Therefore, the program will produce the wrong result if the input contains statements like `X++` or `X--`.\n\n### C Code Plan and Efficiency\nI will rewrite the program in C. My version will be correct and highly efficient.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Read the number of statements, `n`.\n2.  Initialize a variable `x` to 0, which will hold the final result.\n3.  Loop `n` times to process each statement.\n4.  In each loop, read the statement string (e.g., \"X++\"). The key insight for efficiency is that we don't need to compare the entire string. All increment operations (`++X`, `X++`) contain a `+` symbol as their middle character, and all decrement operations (`--X`, `X--`) contain a `-` symbol as their middle character.\n5.  Therefore, I only need to check the character at index 1 of the input string. If `s[1] == '+'`, I increment `x`. Otherwise, I decrement `x`.\n6.  After the loop finishes, print the final value of `x`.\n\n**Efficiency Analysis (for N=100):**\n*   **Speed (x - character comparisons):** My proposed C solution only performs one character comparison (`s[1] == '+'`) per statement. For an input of 100 statements, the total number of comparisons is `100 * 1 = 100`. This is the minimal number possible, as you must inspect at least one character to distinguish between an increment and a decrement.\n*   **Memory (y - memory size in Bytes):** The C program will use variables on the stack. Their sizes on a typical system are:\n    *   `int n;` (for the number of statements): 4 bytes\n    *   `int x = 0;` (for the result): 4 bytes\n    *   `char s[4];` (buffer to read a 3-char string plus null terminator): 4 bytes\n    *   The total minimal memory for these variables is `4 + 4 + 4 = 12` bytes.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Read the number of statements\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    // Initialize the variable x to 0\n    int x = 0;\n    \n    // A character array to store each statement. Size 4 is enough for \"++X\" and a null terminator.\n    char statement[4];\n\n    // Loop through each statement\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%s\", statement);\n        \n        // Check the middle character to determine the operation.\n        // If it's '+', it's an increment ('++X' or 'X++').\n        // Otherwise, it must be a decrement ('--X' or 'X--').\n        if (statement[1] == '+') {\n            x++;\n        } else {\n            x--;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the final value of x\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n<<<N100+12>>>"
