            "statement": "It didn't have any production funding from FINAS (National Film Development Corporation Malaysia), but it becomes internationally renowned.",
            "evaluation": "This is a profound point. FINAS is the main governmental body for film funding. A lack of funding often implies the subject matter is too controversial for official state support. For a film about the taboo May 13 incident to be made without this support and then gain major international acclaim (like at the Golden Horse Awards) is a powerful statement. It highlights a disconnect between the official narrative and the stories artists feel are important to tell, making its journey incredibly significant for Malaysians who understand this tension."

However, the film's importance is rooted in its subject and production context, not just the director's existing reverence. The film made the director more revered, not the other way around."

It does not, in itself, constitute the 'most important reason' for its significance. Its eventual release *despite* its sensitive topic is significant, but that is part of the larger story described in option B."

            "statement": "It received nine nominations at Taiwanâ€™s Golden Horse Awards.",
            "evaluation": "This is a huge achievement and part of its 'international renown' mentioned in option B. However, this is an *outcome*. The core reason for its significance in Malaysia is the *combination* of its courageous subject matter, the lack of official local support (FINAS), and its subsequent international validation by prestigious bodies like the Golden Horse Awards."
