    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  Let the given tensor be $T_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$. The tensor is defined on the space $V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n}$, where $V$ is the space of functions from $\\{0,1\\}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. This is equivalent to saying the tensor is an element of $(\\mathbb{C}^2 \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^2 \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^2)^{\\otimes n}$.\n2.  The slice rank is an asymptotic measure. The tensor $T_n$ is a sum of two parts: $P_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ and $U(x,y,z) = 1$. The all-ones tensor $U$ has a slice rank of 1. The asymptotic behavior of the slice rank of $T_n$ will be dominated by the slice rank of $P_n$.\n3.  The tensor $P_n$ is the $n$-th tensor power of a smaller $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor $P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1+y_1+z_1$. The slice rank of a tensor power $A^{\\otimes n}$ is given by $(SR(A))^n$. So, $SR(P_n) = (SR(P_1))^n$.\n4.  Next, I need to compute the slice rank of the base tensor $P_1$. A 3-tensor $T$ has slice rank 1 if its coefficients can be written as $u_i v_j w_k$ where two of the vectors are constant. This is equivalent to saying that the matrix \"slices\" of the tensor along one direction are all proportional to each other.\n    For $P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1+y_1+z_1$, the slices along the $z_1$ direction are the matrices $M_0$ (for $z_1=0$) and $M_1$ (for $z_1=1$):\n    $M_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0+0 & 0+1 \\\\ 1+0 & 1+1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $M_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0+0+1 & 0+1+1 \\\\ 1+0+1 & 1+1+1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Since $M_0$ and $M_1$ are not proportional, the slice rank of $P_1$ is greater than 1.\n5.  We can show that $P_1$ can be decomposed into a sum of two slices. For example, $P_1 = (x_1+y_1) + z_1$. The term $(x_1+y_1)$ defines a tensor that is a slice with respect to the $z_1$ variable, and the term $z_1$ defines another such slice. So, $SR(P_1) \\le 2$. Since we know $SR(P_1)>1$, we must have $SR(P_1) = 2$.\n6.  Combining these results, the slice rank of $P_n$ is $SR(P_n) = 2^n$. The slice rank of $T_n$ has the asymptotic form $c \\cdot 2^n$ for some constant $c$. The base of the exponential growth is 2.\n7.  We are given that the slice rank has the form $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The base of the exponential growth in this formula is $3/2^K$.\n8.  By equating the two expressions for the base, we get the equation $2 = 3/2^K$.\n9.  Solving for $K$: $2^{K+1} = 3 \\implies K+1 = \\log_2(3) \\implies K = \\log_2(3) - 1 = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n10. Finally, I will write a Python script to compute the numerical value of $K$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Set up the equation for the base of the asymptotic slice rank.\n# Our calculated base of the slice rank growth. Let's call it `base_calc`.\nbase_calc = 2\n\n# The given base of the slice rank growth from the problem. Let's call it `base_given`.\n# The formula is (3 / (2**K))^n, so the base is 3 / (2**K).\n# Let the numerator be `b` and the denominator part be `a**K`.\nb = 3\na = 2\n\n# Step 2: Formulate the equation to solve for K.\n# The equation is base_calc = b / (a**K).\n# In our case, this is 2 = 3 / (2**K).\nprint(f\"The equation to solve is: {base_calc} = {b} / ({a}**K)\")\n\n# Step 3: Solve the equation for K.\n# 2 * (2**K) = 3\n# 2**(K+1) = 3\n# K + 1 = log2(3)\n# K = log2(3) - 1\n# This is equivalent to K = log2(3/2).\n\nK = math.log2(b / a)\n\n# Step 4: Print the final value of K.\nprint(f\"The value of K is: {K}\")\n```\n<<<0.5849625007211562>>>"
