    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of red or blue pieces required to represent the dyadic rational number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in a standard Red-Blue Hackenbush construction.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n1.  **Understanding the Representation:** In Red-Blue Hackenbush, finite games correspond to dyadic rational numbers (fractions of the form $\\frac{m}{2^k}$). A canonical way to construct a game for a positive dyadic rational number is based on its binary expansion.\n2.  **Binary Expansion:** First, we express the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in binary.\n    $$ \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} $$\n    In terms of powers of 2, this is:\n    $$ \\frac{13}{16} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^1} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^2} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^3} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^4} $$\n    This gives the binary representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$ as $0.1101_2$.\n3.  **Constructing the Game:** The \"Winning Ways\" construction for such a number involves a sum of simpler games, where each term in the binary expansion corresponds to a game piece.\n    *   A term of $+ \\frac{1}{2^k}$ is represented by a single **red** piece.\n    *   A term of $- \\frac{1}{2^k}$ would be represented by a single **blue** piece.\n4.  **Counting the Pieces:** To create the value $\\frac{13}{16}$, we sum the games for each non-zero term in its binary expansion:\n    *   The `1` in the $2^{-1}$ place (for $+\\frac{1}{2}$) requires one red piece.\n    *   The `1` in the $2^{-2}$ place (for $+\\frac{1}{4}$) requires one red piece.\n    *   The `0` in the $2^{-3}$ place requires no piece.\n    *   The `1` in the $2^{-4}$ place (for $+\\frac{1}{16}$) requires one red piece.\n    The total number of pieces is the sum of the pieces for each term: $1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3$.\n5.  **A Simpler Method:** Notice that the binary digits of the fractional part ($1101$) are identical to the binary representation of the numerator (13). This provides a shortcut: the number of pieces needed is simply the number of '1's in the binary representation of the numerator. This is also known as the population count or Hamming weight.\n\nThe following Python code implements this shortcut to find the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces to represent a dyadic rational in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n\n    The number of pieces (red for positive, blue for negative) required to represent\n    a dyadic fraction m/2^k is equal to the number of '1's in the binary\n    representation of the numerator m (its population count).\n    \"\"\"\n    numerator = 13\n    denominator = 16\n\n    # The number of pieces is the number of set bits (1s) in the numerator's binary representation.\n    binary_numerator = bin(numerator)\n    # The bin() function returns a string like '0b1101', so we count the '1's.\n    num_pieces = binary_numerator.count('1')\n    \n    print(f\"To represent the number {numerator}/{denominator}:\")\n    print(f\"1.
