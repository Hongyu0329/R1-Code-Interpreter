    """
    This function determines the shape of the water surface in a half-filled icosahedron tank.

    The reasoning is based on the geometric properties of the icosahedron:
    1. An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 equilateral triangle faces. When it rests on a face, the opposite face is parallel to it.
    2. A tank that is "half-filled" with a uniform substance like water will have its surface at a level that bisects the total volume.
    3. Due to the high degree of symmetry, the plane that bisects the volume of the icosahedron is the one passing through its geometric center, parallel to the base.
    4. The cross-section of an icosahedron created by a plane passing through its center and parallel to a pair of opposite faces is a regular hexagon.
