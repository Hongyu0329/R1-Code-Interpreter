    "This is a fascinating geometry problem. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the shape of the water's surface.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the setup:** The tank is an icosahedron, which is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces. It's standing on one of these faces, meaning its base is a horizontal equilateral triangle.\n2.  **Understand \"half-filled\":** The tank is filled to 50% of its volume. Due to the perfect symmetry of a regular polyhedron like an icosahedron, a horizontal plane that cuts the volume exactly in half must pass through the geometric center of the shape.\n3.  **Determine the cross-section:** The water's surface will be the shape formed by the intersection of this horizontal plane (passing through the icosahedron's center) with the interior of the tank.\n4.  **Identify the shape:** For an icosahedron, a cross-sectional slice that passes through its center and runs parallel to one of its faces is a well-known geometric shape. This plane intersects 6 of the icosahedron's 30 edges at their midpoints. These 6 points form the vertices of a regular hexagon.\n5.  **Formulate the answer:** The shape of the water surface is therefore a regular hexagon. I will provide a simple Python script to state this conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_icosahedron_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the shape of the water surface in a half-filled icosahedron tank.\n\n    The reasoning is based on the geometric properties of the icosahedron:\n    1. An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 equilateral triangle faces. When it rests on a face, the opposite face is parallel to it.\n    2. A tank that is \"half-filled\" with a uniform substance like water will have its surface at a level that bisects the total volume.\n    3. Due to the high degree of symmetry, the plane that bisects the volume of the icosahedron is the one passing through its geometric center, parallel to the base.\n    4. The cross-section of an icosahedron created by a plane passing through its center and parallel to a pair of opposite faces is a regular hexagon.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    shape = \"a regular hexagon\"\n\n    # There are no numerical calculations required for this problem.\n    # We will simply print the result based on the geometric deduction.\n    print(f\"The shape of the water surface in a half-filled icosahedron tank standing on a face will be {shape}.\")\n\nsolve_icosahedron_problem()\n```\n<<<a regular hexagon>>>"
