    print("Let X be a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.")
    print("By definition, X = A U B, where A and B are proper subcontinua of X.")

    print("\nStep 1: Finding at least two candidates for regular subcontinua.")
    print("Since A is a proper subcontinuum, the set X \\ A is a non-empty open set. Because X = A U B, it must be that X \\ A ⊆ B. This implies that the interior of B, int(B), is non-empty.")
    print("Similarly, since B is proper, X \\ B ⊆ A, which implies that int(A) is non-empty.")
    print("Let's define two new sets:")
    print("  K_A = closure(int(A))")
    print("  K_B = closure(int(B))")
    print("By their construction, K_A and K_B are regular subcontinua of X. Since int(A) ⊆ A ≠ X and int(B) ⊆ B ≠ X, K_A and K_B are also proper subcontinua.")

    print("\nStep 2: Proving the two candidates are distinct.")
    print("Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that K_A = K_B = K.")
    print("From X \\ A ⊆ B, we have X \\ A ⊆ int(B) because X \\ A is open. Therefore, cl(X \\ A) ⊆ cl(int(B)) = K.")
    print("Since A is a closed set, cl(X \\ A) = X \\ int(A). So, we have X \\ int(A) ⊆ K.")
    print("Now we have both K = cl(int(A)) and X \\ int(A) ⊆ K.")
    print("Let's consider the union of these two sets:")
    print("  K U (X \\ int(A)) = cl(int(A)) U (X \\ int(A))")
    print("Since we assumed X \\ int(A) ⊆ K, the left side is just K.")
    print("The right side is the union of a set and its complement within X, which is X itself.")
    print("This leads to K = X.")
    print("But this is a contradiction. K_A = cl(int(A)) ⊆ A, and A is a *proper* subcontinuum, so K_A cannot be equal to X.")
    print("The assumption that K_A = K_B must be false. Therefore, any decomposable continuum has at least two distinct regular proper subcontinua.")

    print("\nStep 3: Providing an example that achieves the minimum of 2.")
    print("Consider the 'figure-eight' continuum, which is the union of two circles C1 and C2 tangent at a single point.")
    print("Let X = C1 U C2. This is a decomposable continuum.")
    print("The only regular proper subcontinua of X are C1 and C2 themselves.")
    print("  - For C1: int(C1) consists of the points of C1 minus the tangent point. closure(int(C1)) = C1. Thus, C1 is regular.")
    print("  - For C2: int(C2) consists of the points of C2 minus the tangent point. closure(int(C2)) = C2. Thus, C2 is regular.")
    print("The cardinality of the collection {C1, C2} is 2.")
