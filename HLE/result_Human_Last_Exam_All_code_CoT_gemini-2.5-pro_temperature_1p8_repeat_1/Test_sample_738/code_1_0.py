# Step 1: Calculate the total number of distinct instructions.
# The problem states the following possible instructions and their variations (speed levels):
# Stop: 1 state
# Turn left: 2 speed levels
# Turn right: 2 speed levels
# Move forward: 4 speed levels
# Move backward: 2 speed levels
actions = {
    'stop': 1,
    'turn_left': 2,
    'turn_right': 2,
    'forward': 4,
    'backward': 2
}
total_distinct_instructions = sum(actions.values())
print(f"1. Calculating total distinct instructions:")
print(f"   Stop (1) + Left (2) + Right (2) + Forward (4) + Backward (2) = {total_distinct_instructions} instructions\n")


# Step 2: Determine the minimum bits needed to represent one instruction.
# To represent N states, we need ceil(log2(N)) bits.
bits_per_instruction = math.ceil(math.log2(total_distinct_instructions))
print(f"2. Calculating bits per instruction:")
print(f"   To represent {total_distinct_instructions} different states, we need ceil(log2({total_distinct_instructions})) = {bits_per_instruction} bits\n")


# Step 3: Calculate the total number of instructions for one Martian day.
# A Martian day (sol) is 24h 39m 35.244s. We convert this to Earth minutes.
# Instructions are issued each Earth minute.
hours = 24
minutes = 39
seconds = 35.244
total_minutes_in_sol = (hours * 60) + minutes + (seconds / 60)
# We need to store an instruction for each minute, so we take the ceiling.
total_instructions_for_day = math.ceil(total_minutes_in_sol)
print(f"3. Calculating total instructions for a Martian day:")
print(f"   A Martian day is 24h 39m 35.244s, which is ~{total_minutes_in_sol:.2f} Earth minutes.")
print(f"   Total instructions to store = ceil({total_minutes_in_sol:.2f}) = {total_instructions_for_day}\n")


# Step 4: Calculate the total memory size in bytes.
# Total bits = total instructions * bits per instruction
# Total bytes = Total bits / 8
total_bits = total_instructions_for_day * bits_per_instruction
total_bytes = total_bits / 8
print(f"4. Calculating total memory needed in bytes:")
print(f"   Total bits = {total_instructions_for_day} instructions * {bits_per_instruction} bits/instruction = {total_bits} bits")
print(f"   Total bytes = {total_bits} bits / 8 bits/byte = {total_bytes} bytes\n")


# Final answer format as requested
print("The final equation is:")
print(f"Total Bytes = ({total_instructions_for_day} * {bits_per_instruction}) / 8")
print(f"Total Bytes = {int(total_bytes)}")
