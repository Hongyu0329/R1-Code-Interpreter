    "An analytical formula that approximates the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$ can be developed by analyzing the behavior of the integrand in this limit.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Dominant Behavior**: The integral is given by $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$. Let the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + f(x)$, where $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the integrand becomes large where $f(x)$ is small. The function $f(x)$ is zero at $x=0$, which is within the integration bounds. Therefore, the value of the integral is dominated by the contribution from the region near $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the Integrand**: For small values of $x$, the function $f(x)$ is dominated by its term with the lowest power of $x$. In this case, that term is $9.0 x^{5.0}$. So, we can approximate $f(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$ for $x \\approx 0$. The integral is then approximated as:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Integral**: Since the main contribution to the integral comes from a small region around $x=0$, extending the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$ will not significantly change the result, as the integrand becomes very small for large $x$. This simplification makes the integral solvable in a standard form:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n4.  **Solve Analytically**: This integral can be solved using a change of variables. Let $u^5 = \\frac{9.0 x^5}{\\epsilon}$. This leads to $x = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0})^{1/5} u$, and $dx = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0})^{1/5} du$. Substituting these into the integral gives:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0})^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^5} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5} 9.0^{-1/5}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{du}{1+u^5} = 9.0^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{du}{1+u^5}$.\n\n5.  **Use Standard Integral Formula**: The remaining definite integral has a known value: $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^n}du = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$. For our case, $n=5.0$.\n\n6.  **Combine for Final Formula**: By substituting the value of the standard integral, we obtain the final analytical approximation for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\left( 9.0^{-1/5.0} \\frac{\\pi/5.0}{\\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\right) \\epsilon^{-4.0/5.0}$.\n    This can be written as $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^{-a}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the constants $C$ and $a$ and presents the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Parameters from the integral's denominator.\n# The term with the lowest power of x is 9.0 * x^5.0.\n# p is the coefficient and n is the power of this dominant term.\np = 9.0\nn = 5.0\n\n# The approximation for the integral has the form: I(epsilon) approx C * epsilon**(-a)\n\n# The exponent 'a' is determined by the dominant power 'n'.\na = (n - 1.0) / n\n\n# The coefficient 'C' is determined by 'p' and 'n'.\n# The formula for C involves a standard definite integral, whose value is (pi/n) / sin(pi/n).\nintegral_value = (math.pi / n) / math.sin(math.pi / n)\nC = p**(-1.0 / n) * integral_value\n\n# The script will now print the derivation and the final formula clearly.\n\nprint(\"The analytical formula for I(epsilon) for small epsilon is of the form:\")\nprint(\"I(epsilon) approx C * epsilon**(-a)\")\nprint(\"\\nThe values for the constants 'a' and 'C' are calculated as follows:\")\n\n# Explain and print the value of 'a'.\nprint(f\"\\nThe exponent 'a' is derived from the lowest power of x (n={n}):\")\nprint(f\"a = (n - 1) / n = ({n} - 1) / {n} = {a}\")\n\n# Explain and print the value of 'C'.\nprint(f\"\\nThe coefficient 'C' is derived from the lowest power of x (n={n}) and its coefficient (p={p}):\")\nprint(f\"C = p**(-1/n) * ( (pi/n) / sin(pi/n) )\")\nprint(f\"C = {p}**(-1/{n}) * ( (pi/{n}) / sin(pi/{n}) )\")\n# Print the intermediate numerical values for clarity\nprint(f\"C approx {p**(-1.0/n):.4f} * {integral_value:.4f} = {C:.4f}\")\n\n# Print the final numerical formula as requested, with all numbers included.\nprint(\"\\nThus, the final approximate analytical formula is:\")\nprint(f\"I(epsilon) approx {C:.4f} * epsilon**(-{a})\")\n```\n<<<0.6888>>>"
