    "To determine how many elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Relevant Surgeries**: An \"integral surgery\" on a knot K results in a 3-manifold. For this manifold to be an element of the homology cobordism group, it must be an integer homology 3-sphere (a manifold whose integer homology groups are the same as the 3-sphere, $S^3$). Surgery with an integer coefficient *n* on a knot produces a manifold whose first homology group is $\\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$. For this group to be trivial (as required for an integer homology sphere), we must have $|n|=1$. Therefore, we only need to consider surgeries with coefficients +1 and -1.\n\n2.  **Identify Knots**: We list all prime knots with four or fewer crossings:\n    *   **0 crossings**: Unknot ($0_1$)\n    *   **3 crossings**: Trefoil knot ($3_1$)\n    *   **4 crossings**: Figure-eight knot ($4_1$)\n\n3.  **Classify Surgery Results**: The homology cobordism group, $\\Theta_3^H$, is known to be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, meaning it has two elements: the trivial element (represented by $S^3$) and one non-trivial element. The specific element generated by a $\\pm 1$ surgery on a knot K is determined by the knot's Arf invariant.\n    *   If `Arf(K) = 0`, the surgery results in the **trivial element**.\n    *   If `Arf(K) = 1`, the surgery results in the **non-trivial element**.\n\n4.  **Calculate Arf Invariants**:\n    *   `Arf(Unknot)` = 0\n    *   `Arf(Trefoil)` = 1\n    *   `Arf(Figure-eight)` = 0\n\n5.  **Count the Unique Elements**: By checking the Arf invariants of our knots, we can see which elements they generate.\n    *   The Unknot and Figure-eight knot (both with Arf=0) generate the trivial element.\n    *   The Trefoil knot (with Arf=1) generates the non-trivial element.\n    *   This gives us a total of two distinct elements.\n\nThe following Python code systematically applies this logic to arrive at the final count.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements representable\n    by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script determines how many unique elements of the homology cobordism group\")\n    print(\"can be formed by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define knots with at most 4 crossings and their Arf invariants.\n    # Note: A knot's mirror image has the same Arf invariant, so we don't need to list it separately.\n    knots = {\n        \"Unknot (0_1)\": {\"arf_invariant\": 0},\n        \"Trefoil (3_1)\": {\"arf_invariant\": 1},\n        \"Figure-eight (4_1)\": {\"arf_invariant\": 0}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify knots and their Arf invariants.\")\n    for name, data in knots.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: Arf invariant = {data['arf_invariant']}\")\n    print(\"\\nAn Arf invariant of 0 yields the trivial element.\")\n    print(\"An Arf invariant of 1 yields the non-trivial element.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the type of homology cobordism element each knot generates.\n    element_map = {\n        0: \"Trivial Element\",\n        1: \"Non-trivial Element\"\n    }\n\n    # Use a dictionary to group knots by the element they generate.\n    generated_elements = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    for name, data in knots.items():\n        element_type = element_map[data[\"arf_invariant\"]]\n        generated_elements[element_type].append(name)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Group knots by the homology element they generate.\")\n    for element, knames in generated_elements.items():\n        print(f\"- The {element} is generated by: {', '.join(knames)}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Count the number of unique elements generated.\n    num_trivial = 1 if \"Trivial Element\" in generated_elements else 0\n    num_nontrivial = 1 if \"Non-trivial Element\" in generated_elements else 0\n    total_elements = len(generated_elements)\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Final Count.\")\n    print(\"The final count is the number of distinct groups from Step 2.\")\n    print(f\"Number of groups generating the Trivial Element: {num_trivial}\")\n    print(f\"Number of groups generating the Non-trivial Element: {num_nontrivial}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{num_trivial} (from Arf=0 knots) + {num_nontrivial} (from Arf=1 knots) = {total_elements} total elements\")\n\nsolve_homology_cobordism_count()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
