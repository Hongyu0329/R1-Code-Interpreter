    # The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes of compact metric spaces

    # Step 1: Reduce the problem using topological theorems.
    # A key concept is the "disconnection number", d(X). We are given d(X) = 4.
    # A series of theorems in continuum theory connect this property to the shape of the space.
    # Theorem A: A compact connected metric space X has a finite disconnection number if and only if
    # it is a "dendrite". A dendrite is a locally connected, compact, connected metric space
    # that contains no subspace homeomorphic to a circle.
    # Theorem B: For any dendrite X, the disconnection number is d(X) = k + 1, where k is the
    # number of "endpoints" (or leaves) of the dendrite.

    # So, the problem is reduced to finding the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of topological trees
    # with k=3 leaves.
