    "To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the smallest rectangle that can enclose the given figure, and then determine the side length of the smallest square that can contain this rectangle.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the parametric curve:** The curve is defined in two parts.\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = \\sin(t)$. This is the upper half of a unit circle. Here, $x$ ranges from -1 to 1, and $y$ ranges from 0 to 1.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = 5\\sin(t)$. This is the lower half of an ellipse. Here, $x$ ranges from -1 to 1, and $y$ ranges from -5 to 0.\n\n2.  **Determine the overall range of x and y:**\n    *   The minimum x-value (`x_min`) is -1 and the maximum x-value (`x_max`) is 1.\n    *   The minimum y-value (`y_min`) is -5 and the maximum y-value (`y_max`) is 1.\n\n3.  **Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box:**\n    *   The width of the figure is `width = x_max - x_min = 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   The height of the figure is `height = y_max - y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n4.  **Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square:** The side length of the smallest square that can enclose this bounding box must be equal to the larger of its dimensions.\n    *   `side = max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the area:** The area of this square is `side * side`.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to find the final area.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Determine the overall range of x and y\n# For x = cos(t), the range over [0, 2*pi] is [-1, 1].\nx_min = -1\nx_max = 1\n\n# For y, we have two parts:\n# Part 1: y = sin(t) for t in [0, pi]. Range is [0, 1].\n# Part 2: y = 5*sin(t) for t in (pi, 2*pi). Range is [-5, 0).\n# The overall range for y is the union of these two ranges.\ny_min = -5\ny_max = 1\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\n# Step 4: Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the area of the square\narea = side_length * side_length\n\n# Print the final calculation and result\nprint(f\"The side length of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the figure's width and height.\")\nprint(f\"Width = {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}\")\nprint(f\"Height = {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}\")\nprint(f\"Side of the square = max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}\")\nprint(f\"The area of the square is:\")\nprint(f\"{int(side_length)} * {int(side_length)} = {int(area)}\")\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
