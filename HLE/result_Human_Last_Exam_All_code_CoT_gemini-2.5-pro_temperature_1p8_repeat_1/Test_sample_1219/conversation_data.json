    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a high-precision calculation problem. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  The core of the problem is to compute `tan(x)` for a very large number `x = 10^100`. The tangent function is periodic with a period of `π`. This means `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`.\n2.  So, the first step is to calculate the remainder `r = 10^100 mod π`.\n3.  Since `10^100` is a huge integer, the value of `π` used in the calculation must be extremely precise. An error in the digits of `π` would lead to a completely different remainder `r`. We need to use `π` with a precision of at least 100 decimal places plus a few extra for accuracy. I'll use a precision of 120 digits for the calculation.\n4.  Python's standard `decimal` module is perfect for this kind of high-precision arithmetic. I will use it to represent `10^100` and `π`.\n5.  The `decimal` module does not have a built-in `tan` function. I will implement one by calculating `sin(r)` and `cos(r)` using their Taylor series expansions. To ensure the Taylor series converges quickly, I will first reduce the angle `r` to the range `[-π/2, π/2]`.\n6.  Finally, after computing `tan(r)`, I will extract and print the first three digits that appear after the decimal point.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan:\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef find_tan_googol_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first 3 digits after the decimal point of tan(10^100).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a high precision for the decimal calculations.\n    # To find `10^100 mod pi` accurately, we need pi to be precise\n    # to more than 100 decimal places. 120 should be sufficient.\n    prec = 120\n    decimal.getcontext().prec = prec\n\n    # A high-precision string of Pi with 119 decimal places (120 significant digits).\n    pi_str = \"3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679\"\n\n    # --- High-precision math functions for Decimal objects ---\n\n    def sin_decimal(x, p):\n        \"\"\"Computes sin(x) for a Decimal 'x' to 'p' places using Taylor series.\"\"\"\n        decimal.getcontext().prec = p + 4  # Use a few guard digits\n        x_squared = x * x\n        result = decimal.Decimal(0)\n        term = x\n        i = 1\n        # Taylor series for sin(x) = x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - ...\n        while abs(term) > decimal.Decimal('1e-' + str(p + 2)):\n            result += term\n            i += 2\n            term *= -x_squared / ((i - 1) * i)\n        decimal.getcontext().prec = p\n        return +result\n\n    def cos_decimal(x, p):\n        \"\"\"Computes cos(x) for a Decimal 'x' to 'p' places using Taylor series.\"\"\"\n        decimal.getcontext().prec = p + 4  # Use a few guard digits\n        x_squared = x * x\n        result = decimal.Decimal(0)\n        term = decimal.Decimal(1)\n        i = 0\n        # Taylor series for cos(x) = 1 - x^2/2! + x^4/4! - ...\n        while abs(term) > decimal.Decimal('1e-' + str(p + 2)):\n            result += term\n            i += 2\n            term *= -x_squared / ((i - 1) * i)\n        decimal.getcontext().prec = p\n        return +result\n\n    def tan_decimal(x, p):\n        \"\"\"Computes tan(x) for a Decimal 'x' to 'p' places.\"\"\"\n        s = sin_decimal(x, p + 4)\n        c = cos_decimal(x, p + 4)\n        if c == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Tangent is undefined.\")\n        decimal.getcontext().prec = p\n        return s / c\n\n    # --- Main calculation ---\n\n    # 1.
