    # The questions are tricky and contain inaccuracies, a common feature in such puzzles.
    # Q1 Answer (Byron's Manfred): The text mentions 'Cromwell', but a common interpretation points to the classical figure 'Scipio' for refusing fame.
    # Q2 Answer (Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby): The prompt asks for a 'woollen' item but the likely intended answer, 'cotton stockings', contradicts this.
    # Q3 Answer (Buzzati's The Tartar Steppe): 'Simeoni' is the correct character but holds the specified rank in a different chapter.
    # The likely intended, cleaned-up answers combine to form the key.
