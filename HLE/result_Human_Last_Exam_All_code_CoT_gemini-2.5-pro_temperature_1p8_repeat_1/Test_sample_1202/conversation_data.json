    "Of the provided options, neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are the two major models that explain the long-term retention and functional divergence of duplicate genes. To determine which is the most likely mechanism, we need to analyze the conditions each model requires.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to model this analysis. The script will:\n1.  Define each of the potential mechanisms with their key characteristics, specifically whether they lead to the retention of both gene copies and whether they cause the copies to diverge.\n2.  Iterate through each mechanism, explaining how it relates to the fate of duplicate genes.\n3.  Filter these mechanisms to find the ones that satisfy both conditions of the question: retention and divergence.\n4.  Provide a final conclusion by comparing the qualifying models. Subfunctionalization is often considered a more probable initial outcome because it relies on common, selectively neutral, or nearly-neutral degenerative mutations. In contrast, neofunctionalization requires a rarer gain-of-function mutation to occur for the duplicate gene to be preserved. For this reason, subfunctionalization can be argued as a \"more likely\" mechanism for initial preservation.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_fates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes different mechanisms for the fate of duplicate genes\n    to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    mechanisms = [\n        {\n            'option': 'A',\n            'name': 'Gene conversion',\n            'preserves_both_functional_copies': False,\n            'leads_to_divergence': False,\n            'explanation': 'One sequence replaces another, leading to homogenization, not divergence.
