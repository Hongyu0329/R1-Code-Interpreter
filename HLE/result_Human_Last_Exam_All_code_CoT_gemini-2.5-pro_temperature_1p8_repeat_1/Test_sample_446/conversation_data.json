    "This is a biological knowledge question that can be solved by applying known principles of protein-protein interactions. All the choices contain the RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) tripeptide motif, which is the primary recognition site for many integrin receptors. However, the amino acids flanking this core motif play a critical role in determining the binding affinity and specificity for different types of integrins.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Motif:** Recognize that all peptides contain the RGD sequence, so the answer must lie in the flanking amino acids.\n2.  **Recall/Identify High-Affinity Sequences:** Access biological knowledge about which flanking sequences confer strong integrin binding. The sequence RGDSP is a well-characterized motif derived from fibronectin, a major extracellular matrix protein. This sequence is known to bind with high affinity to several integrins, such as α5β1 and αvβ3, and is commonly used in in vitro assays.\n3.  **Screen the Candidates:** Check which of the answer choices contains this known high-affinity RGDSP sequence.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** Write a script that encodes this logic. The script will define the list of candidate peptides and search for the one containing the well-established \"RGDSP\" motif. The script will then print the reasoning and the identified peptide.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_integrin_binding_peptide():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the most likely integrin-binding peptide from a list of candidates.\n    \n    The function operates on the principle that while the RGD motif is essential,\n    flanking sequences determine high-affinity binding. The RGDSP sequence,\n    derived from fibronectin, is a classic and potent integrin-binding motif.\n    This script searches for the peptide containing this specific sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    peptides = {\n        'A': 'RGDMAA',\n        'B': 'RGDSPSS',\n        'C': 'RGDLTTP',\n        'D': 'RGDQVSK',\n        'E': 'RGDARGG'\n    }\n\n    # The RGDSP motif is a well-established high-affinity binding sequence for integrins.\n    high_affinity_motif = \"RGDSP\"\n    \n    found_key = None\n\n    print(\"Analyzing peptides for integrin binding potential...\")\n    print(f\"The core recognition motif is RGD.
