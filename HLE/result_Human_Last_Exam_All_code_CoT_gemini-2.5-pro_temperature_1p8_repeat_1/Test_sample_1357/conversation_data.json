    "This is a problem in algebraic geometry, specifically concerning the degeneration of curves. The number of types of stable reductions for a genus `g` curve whose Jacobian has good reduction is equivalent to counting the number of non-isomorphic \"stable trees of curves\" of total arithmetic genus `g`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Translate the conditions:** The condition that the Jacobian of the genus 4 curve `C` has good reduction imposes a strong constraint on the stable reduction `C_s` of the curve. According to Raynaud's theorem, this implies that the dual graph of `C_s` must be a tree.\n2.  **Use the genus formula:** For a stable curve `C_s` composed of irreducible components `C_i` with genera `g_i`, its arithmetic genus `p_a(C_s)` is given by `p_a(C_s) = sum(g_i) + k - 1 - delta`, where `k` is the number of components and `delta` is the number of nodes. Since the dual graph is a tree with `k` vertices (components) and `delta` edges (nodes), we have `delta = k - 1`. Substituting this into the formula gives `p_a(C_s) = sum(g_i)`. As the genus is 4, the sum of the genera of the components must be 4.\n3.  **Apply the stability conditions:** A stable curve must satisfy these conditions:\n    *   Any component `C_i` with genus `g_i = 0` (a rational curve) must have at least 3 nodes on it. This means the corresponding vertex in the dual graph must have a degree of at least 3.\n    *   Any component `C_i` with genus `g_i = 1` (an elliptic curve) must have at least 1 node on it (i.e., it cannot be an isolated component in a multi-component curve). This is automatically satisfied for any component in a connected graph with more than one vertex.\n4.  **Enumerate possibilities:** We need to find all combinations of tree graphs and assignments of genera `g_i >= 0` to their vertices that satisfy `sum(g_i) = 4` and the stability conditions. A \"type\" is a unique (non-isomorphic) combination of a tree graph and a genus assignment.\n\nThe Python code below follows this enumeration process by considering the number of components `k` from 1 to 6 (for `k>6`, no solutions exist). It catalogues each valid type and calculates the total count.\n\n```python\ndef count_stable_reductions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves\n    with good reduction Jacobians by enumerating the combinatorial possibilities.\n\n    The method is to count the number of non-isomorphic stable trees of curves\n    with a total arithmetic genus of 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Finding all types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve with good reduction Jacobian...\\n\")\n\n    # A \"type\" is a unique combination of component genera and their connectivity graph.\n    # The conditions are:\n    # 1.
