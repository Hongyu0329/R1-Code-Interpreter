    "My plan is to determine the French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" by breaking it down into its etymological components and finding the modern French form of each part.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Name**: I will separate \"Odobeccus\" into its two recognizable parts: the root \"Odo-\" and the suffix \"-beccus\".\n2.  **Trace the First Part**: \"Odo-\" is a well-documented Germanic name element. I will identify its known evolution into Old and Modern French, which is the name \"Eudes\".\n3.  **Trace the Second Part**: \"-beccus\" is a Latinized version of the Gaulish word \"beccos\". I will identify its evolution into modern French, which is the word \"bec\".\n4.  **Combine the Parts**: By combining the French equivalents of the two original parts, I will construct the most likely French form of the name.\n5.  **Final Output**: The script will print out this step-by-step reasoning and then print the final resulting name.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_french_equivalent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the name \"Odobeccus\" and determines its most likely French equivalent.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The original name to be analyzed.\n    gaulish_name = \"Odobeccus\"\n\n    # Step 1: Break down the name into its constituent parts.\n    # The name is composed of a Germanic root and a Gaulish suffix.\n    part1_original = \"Odo\"\n    part2_original = \"beccus\"\n\n    # Step 2: Find the French equivalent of the first part, \"Odo\".\n    # \"Odo\" is a Germanic personal name that was common among the Franks.\n    # Its established evolution into French is the name \"Eudes\".\n    # For example, the 9th-century King Odo of West Francia is known as \"Eudes\" in French.\n    part1_french = \"Eudes\"\n\n    # Step 3: Find the French equivalent of the second part, \"-beccus\".\n    # This suffix comes from the Gaulish word \"beccos\", meaning \"beak\".\n    # The word survived the transition from Gaulish to Latin to French.\n    # Its direct descendant in modern French is \"bec\".\n    part2_french = \"bec\"\n\n    # Step 4: Combine the French parts to form the final name.\n    # The modern French equivalent is formed by joining the evolved components.\n    final_name = part1_french + part2_french\n\n    # Step 5: Print the analysis and the result.\n    print(f\"Finding the French equivalent for the name: {gaulish_name}\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"1. The name is broken down into two parts: '{part1_original}' and '-{part2_original}'.\")\n    print(f\"2.

The suffix '-{part2_original}' is from Gaulish 'beccos' (beak), which became '{part2_french}' in French.\")\n    print(f\"4.
