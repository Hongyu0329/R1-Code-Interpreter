    # The data shows a clear non-linear, concave-down trend.
    # A linear model would not capture this curvature well.
    # A quadratic model might fit, but a simpler two-parameter square-root model
    # often describes this kind of relationship parsimoniously.
    # Let's test the square root model: y = a * sqrt(x) + b.
    
    # Define the square root model function
    def sqrt_model(x, a, b):
        return a * np.sqrt(x) + b
