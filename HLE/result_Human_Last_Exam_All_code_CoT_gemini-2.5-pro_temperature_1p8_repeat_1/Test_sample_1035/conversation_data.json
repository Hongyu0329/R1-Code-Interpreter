    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum total number of vertices in a set of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph \\(K_n\\).\n\nLet the complete graph be \\(K_n\\) with \\(V = \\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\\}\\) as its set of vertices. We are looking for a family of bipartite graphs \\(B_1, B_2, ..., B_k\\) such that the union of their edge sets contains all the edges of \\(K_n\\). The goal is to minimize the sum of the number of vertices in these bipartite graphs, which is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(B_i)|\\).\n\nThis is a known problem in extremal graph theory. The minimum value for this sum is given by the formula:\n$$S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lceil \\log_2 i \\rceil$$\n\nThis formula can be understood using an information-theoretic argument. Each vertex \\(v_i\\) needs to be distinguishable from every other vertex \\(v_j\\) by at least one bipartite graph \\(B_l\\), meaning they must fall into different partitions of \\(B_l\\). The total sum of vertices represents the total cost of this encoding. The construction that achieves this minimum involves assigning a \"code\" to each vertex \\(v_i\\). To distinguish vertex \\(v_i\\) from the preceding \\(i-1\\) vertices \\(\\{v_1, ..., v_{i-1}\\}\\), it requires a code of length \\(\\lceil \\log_2 i \\rceil\\). The total sum is the sum of these code lengths over all vertices.\n\nFor \\(n = 35\\), we need to calculate \\(S_{35} = \\sum_{i=1}^{35} \\lceil \\log_2 i \\rceil\\).\n\nWe can compute this sum by grouping terms that have the same value for \\(\\lceil \\log_2 i \\rceil\\).\n*   For \\(i=1\\), \\(\\lceil \\log_2 1 \\rceil = 0\\). (1 term)\n*   For \\(i=2\\), \\(\\lceil \\log_2 2 \\rceil = 1\\). (1 term)\n*   For \\(i \\in [3, 4]\\), \\(\\lceil \\log_2 i \\rceil = 2\\). (2 terms)\n*   For \\(i \\in [5, 8]\\), \\(\\lceil \\log_2 i \\rceil = 3\\). (4 terms)\n*   For \\(i \\in [9, 16]\\), \\(\\lceil \\log_2 i \\rceil = 4\\). (8 terms)\n*   For \\(i \\in [17, 32]\\), \\(\\lceil \\log_2 i \\rceil = 5\\). (16 terms)\n*   For \\(i \\in [33, 35]\\), \\(\\lceil \\log_2 i \\rceil = 6\\). (3 terms)\n\nThe total sum is \\((1 \\times 0) + (1 \\times 1) + (2 \\times 2) + (4 \\times 3) + (8 \\times 4) + (16 \\times 5) + (3 \\times 6)\\).\n\nThe following Python code calculates this sum and displays the components of the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_min_vertices_sum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all edges of K_n, for n=35.\n    \n    The formula is S_n = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(log2(i)).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    print(f\"To find the minimum number of vertices for n = {n}, we calculate the sum S_n = sum_{{i=1 to n}} ceil(log2(i)).\")\n\n    value_counts = {}\n    # Group terms by the value of ceil(log2(i))\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # By convention or direct calculation, ceil(log2(1)) is 0.\n        val = math.ceil(math.log2(i)) if i > 1 else 0\n        \n        if val in value_counts:\n            value_counts[val] += 1\n        else:\n            value_counts[val] = 1\n\n    # Prepare the components for the final equation\n    sum_parts = []\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Sort by value for a structured output\n    for val in sorted(value_counts.keys()):\n        count = value_counts[val]\n        product = count * val\n        sum_parts.append(str(product))\n        total_sum += product\n    \n    # Format the final equation string showing each term's contribution\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(sum_parts) + f\" = {total_sum}\"\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is formed by summing the contributions from these groups:\")\n    print(final_equation)\n\ncalculate_min_vertices_sum()\n```\n<<<147>>>"
