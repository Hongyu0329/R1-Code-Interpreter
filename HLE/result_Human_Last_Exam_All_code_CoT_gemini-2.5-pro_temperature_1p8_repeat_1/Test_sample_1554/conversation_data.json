    "Of course. I will identify the philosopher and then use a Python script to print the answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the correct philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who worked on semiotics and the theory of signs.\n2.  Recall the specific distinction they made regarding signs, specifically the terms 'symptoms' and 'signals' as parts of a 'hallmark' or sign.\n3.  Write a Python script that stores this information in variables and then prints it out in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_philosopher():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher\n    who distinguished between symptoms and signals.\n    \"\"\"\n    philosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n    concept = \"hallmark (or sign)\"\n    decomposition = {\n        \"symptoms\": \"natural signs with a causal link to their object\",\n        \"signals\": \"conventional signs based on rules or agreement\"\n    }\n\n    print(f\"The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposes the notion of a '{concept}' is {philosopher}.\")\n    print(f\"He broke it down into:\")\n    print(f\"- Symptoms: {decomposition['symptoms']}\")\n    print(f\"- Signals: {decomposition['signals']}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer\nfind_philosopher()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
