    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system. The given set of differential equations describes a continuous-time Markov chain. At steady state, as time $t$ approaches infinity, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Set up the Steady-State Equations:** When the system is at steady state, the rate of change of probabilities is zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. This converts the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n2.  **Incorporate the Normalization Condition:** The sum of all probabilities must equal 1, so we have the equation $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$. This equation is essential because the original rate equations are linearly dependent. We will replace one of the rate equations with the normalization equation to get a solvable system.\n3.  **Solve the Linear System:** I will formulate the system of linear equations in matrix form, $A\\mathbf{\\pi} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{\\pi}$ is the vector of unknown probabilities. I will then use Python with the NumPy library to solve for $\\mathbf{\\pi}$.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Result:** Once the individual probabilities ($\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$) are found, I will calculate the required sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$ and print the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_steady_state():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the boundary-value problem for the Kolmogorov-Chapman system\n    to find the steady-state probabilities and their sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem describes a continuous-time Markov chain with 4 states (0, 1, 2, 3).\n    # We need to find the sum of the steady-state probabilities for states 0 and 1,\n    # denoted as P0(+infinity) and P1(+infinity).\n\n    # At steady state (as t -> +infinity), the probabilities are constant,\n    # so their time derivatives are zero: P_i'(t) = 0.\n    # Let pi_i = P_i(+infinity).
