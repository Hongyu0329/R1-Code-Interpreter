    """
    Solves for the largest possible cardinality of the set of non-coastal points
    in a hereditarily decomposable continuum.

    The solution proceeds in the following steps:
    1.  Relate 'coastal points' to a known topological property.
        - In a hereditarily decomposable continuum, a point 'p' is a coastal point
          if and only if the continuum is 'aposyndetic' at 'p'.
        - Therefore, the set of points where the continuum fails to be coastal is the
          set of points where it is not aposyndetic.

    2.  Establish an upper bound for the cardinality.
        - A metric continuum (the standard type) has cardinality at most 'c',
          the cardinality of the continuum (2^aleph_0).
        - Any subset, including the set of non-coastal points, must therefore
          also have cardinality less than or equal to 'c'.

    3.  Find an example that achieves this upper bound.
        - A classic example is the 'Cantor fan' (or 'Cantor brush'). This is
          a dendrite formed by joining a single point to every point in a
          Cantor set via line segments.
        - Dendrites are hereditarily decomposable.
        - The set of points where a dendrite is not aposyndetic is its set
          of endpoints (points of order 1).

    4.  Determine the cardinality for the example.
        - For the Cantor fan, the set of endpoints is a copy of the Cantor set.
        - The cardinality of the Cantor set is 'c'.

    5.  Conclusion.
        - An upper bound for the cardinality is 'c', and an example exists that
          achieves this cardinality.
        - Therefore, the largest possible cardinality is 'c'.
