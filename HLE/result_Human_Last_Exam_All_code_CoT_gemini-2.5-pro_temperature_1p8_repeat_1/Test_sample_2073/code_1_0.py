# Let X = det(N). From our analysis, we have:
# E[X] = 0
# E[X^2] = 13
#
# The function phi(a) is defined by a complex integral involving the characteristic
# function of X.
# A Taylor series expansion of the integrand around t=0 gives a simplified result.
# phi(a) approx E[X^2] - 2*a
#
# We need to evaluate phi(7).

a = 7
expected_X_squared = 13

# The value of the integral is hypothesized to be given by the limit of the
# integrand at t=0, which is E[X^2] - 2*a.
result = expected_X_squared - 2 * a

# The provided formula for the matrix N and the function phi(a) are constructed
# in such a way that it leads to a simple final value.
# The calculation steps for the determinant are:
# det(N) = det(A), where A is the top-left 3x3 submatrix.
# Using row operations on A, where R3 -> R3 - R2, we find that
# det(A) = N_11*N_23 - N_13*N_21
# Substituting and simplifying gives:
# det(N) = 2*N1 - N3 - 2*N1*N2 + 2*N3*N4
#
# E[det(N)] = 0
# E[(det(N))^2] = E[(2*N1 - N3 - 2*N1*N2 + 2*N3*N4)^2]
# Due to independence and zero mean of N_i, only the expectation of squared terms
# remains:
# E[(det(N))^2] = E[4*N1^2 + N3^2 + 4*N1^2*N2^2 + 4*N3^2*N4^2]
# Since E[Ni^2] = 1, E[(det(N))^2] = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13.

# The equation for phi(a) can be shown to depend on the distribution of det(N).
# A common trick in such problems is that the value is given by the leading term
# of the integrand's power series expansion.
# The limit of the integrand of phi(a) as t->0 is E[(det(N))^2] - 2*a.
# For a=7, this is 13 - 2*7 = -1.
