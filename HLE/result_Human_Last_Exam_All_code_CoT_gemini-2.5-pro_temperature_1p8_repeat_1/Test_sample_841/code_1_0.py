# The task is to find the size of a specific set of rings that are Half-Factorial Domains (HFDs).
# An HFD is a ring where all factorizations of an element into irreducibles have the same length.

# The set of rings is a union of:
# 1. Rings of integers O_Q(sqrt(-d)) for d > 0 and square-free.
# 2. Rings Z[sqrt(-d)] that are not integrally closed (which occurs when -d = 1 mod 4).

# Step 1: Analyze rings of type (2), the non-maximal orders.
# It is a known result from algebraic number theory that these rings are never HFDs.
# For example, in Z[sqrt(-7)], the element 8 has factorizations 2*2*2 (length 3) and
# (1+sqrt(-7))(1-sqrt(-7)) (length 2), so it is not an HFD.
# Therefore, the count of HFDs from this group is 0.
num_hfd_in_non_maximal_orders = 0

# Step 2: Analyze rings of type (1), the rings of integers (maximal orders).
# These are Dedekind domains. A Dedekind domain is an HFD if and only if its
# ideal class number is 1 or 2.

# Step 3: Count the number of such rings by listing the values of d.
# The complete lists of d for which the class number of Q(sqrt(-d)) is 1 or 2 are known.

# List of d's for which the class number is 1 (these rings are UFDs and thus HFDs).
d_class_number_1 = [1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163]
num_class_number_1 = len(d_class_number_1)

# List of d's for which the class number is 2.
d_class_number_2 = [5, 6, 10, 13, 15, 22, 35, 37, 51, 58, 91, 115, 123, 187, 235, 267, 403, 427]
num_class_number_2 = len(d_class_number_2)

# Step 4: Calculate the total size of the set.
# The total is the sum of the counts from all categories.
total_size = num_class_number_1 + num_class_number_2 + num_hfd_in_non_maximal_orders

# Step 5: Print the results and the final equation.
