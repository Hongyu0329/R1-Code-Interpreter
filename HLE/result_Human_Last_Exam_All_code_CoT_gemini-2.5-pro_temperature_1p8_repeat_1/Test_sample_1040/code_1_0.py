    Based on the mathematical derivations, the following identities necessarily follow from the premises:
    6. k.Φ²(l;m) = 0
    7. (lm).Φ²(k;m) = 0
    8. (klm).Φ²(k;l) = 0
    11. (lm).Φ³(k;l;m) = 0
    12. (klm).Φ³(k;l;m) = 0
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The condition Ψ(k;l;m) = 0 implies a set of identities, notably that for distinct x,y,z from {k,l,m}, we have relations like x.Φ(y) = xy.Φ(y) and x.Φ(y) = z.Φ(y).
    2. A key simplification is proving that Φ³(k;l;m) = Φ²(k;l). This makes identities involving Φ³ reducible to ones about Φ². Specifically, identity 11 becomes a permuted version of the logic for 8, and identity 12 becomes identical to 8.
    3. Each of the identities 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 can be proven to be 0 by algebraic manipulation using the consequences of the assumption Ψ(k;l;m) = 0, the properties of the monoid M, and the monoid action.
    4. For instance, proving identity 6: k.Φ²(l;m) = k.Φ(l) - k.(m.Φ(l)) = k.Φ(l) - (km).Φ(l). From the premise, it can be derived that k.Φ(l) = km.Φ(l), which makes the expression zero. Similar proofs exist for the other true identities.
    5. The other identities (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10) cannot be proven and are not necessarily true. For example, Φ²(k;l) = 0 is not guaranteed, which makes 5 and 9 (since 9 is equivalent to 5) not necessarily true.
    
    The final answer is the comma-separated string of the numbers for the true equations, in increasing order.
