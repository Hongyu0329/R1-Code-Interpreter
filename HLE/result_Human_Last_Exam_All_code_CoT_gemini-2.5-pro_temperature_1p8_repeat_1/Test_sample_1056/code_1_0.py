    # Let tau be the golden ratio conjugate.
    tau = (math.sqrt(5) - 1) / 2
    
    # Step 1: Characterize the group G.
    # The group G is the set of piecewise linear, orientation-preserving homeomorphisms
    # of the interval [0, 1]. Its breakpoints are in the ring Z[tau] = {a + b*tau | a, b in Z},
    # and the slopes of the linear segments are integer powers of tau.
    # This group is known in the literature as the "golden ratio Thompson's group", often denoted F(tau).

    # Step 2: Relate G to Thompson's group F.
    # A significant result in group theory, proven by Cleary and Taback,
    # states that this group G = F(tau) is isomorphic to the classical Thompson's group F.
    # Thompson's group F is defined similarly, but with dyadic rational breakpoints (of the form k/2^n)
    # and slopes that are powers of 2.

    # Step 3: Use the property that abelianization is invariant under isomorphism.
    # If two groups are isomorphic, their abelianizations are also isomorphic.
    # Abelianization of G is G / [G, G], where [G, G] is the commutator subgroup.
    # Since G is isomorphic to F, Ab(G) is isomorphic to Ab(F).

    # Step 4: Use the known structure of the abelianization of F.
    # The abelianization of Thompson's group F is a well-known result:
    # Ab(F) is isomorphic to the direct product of two infinite cyclic groups, Z x Z,
    # which can also be written as Z^2.

    # Step 5: Deduce the rank and torsion order for Ab(G).
    # Since Ab(G) is isomorphic to Z^2, it is a free abelian group.
    # The rank (r) of an abelian group is the dimension of its free part.
    # For Z^2, the rank is 2.
    r = 2
    
    # The torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order.
    # In Z^2, the only element of finite order is the identity element (0, 0).
    # Therefore, the torsion subgroup is the trivial group { (0, 0) }.
    # The order (t) of this subgroup is its size, which is 1.
    t = 1
    
    # The final answer is the pair (r, t).
    result_pair = (r, t)
