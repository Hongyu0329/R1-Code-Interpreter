    "Here is a step-by-step plan to address your question.\n\nFirst, I will address the physics question regarding boron nanosheets and spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). Then, as per the instructions to provide a coding solution, I will provide a Python script that demonstrates the fundamental principle of energy conservation involved in the SPDC process.\n\n**Physics Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC):** This is a nonlinear optical effect where a high-energy \"pump\" photon splits into two lower-energy photons, known as \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons. This process is governed by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  **Symmetry Requirement:** A material can only have a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ if its crystal structure is non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion symmetry. Materials with an inversion center (centrosymmetric materials) have a $\\chi^{(2)}$ of zero and therefore do not exhibit SPDC in their bulk form.\n3.  **Boron Nanosheets (Borophene):** The most common and stable synthesized forms of free-standing borophene (like the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ phases) have crystal structures that are centrosymmetric.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Because the common, stable forms of free-standing boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry, their bulk second-order susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) is zero. Consequently, they would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. While effects at edges or defects could theoretically break this symmetry locally, the bulk material itself is not suitable for this process.\n\n**Code Plan:**\n\nTo fulfill the coding task requirement, I will write a Python script that calculates the resulting photon wavelengths in an SPDC process based on the law of energy conservation. This demonstrates the physics principle, even though it doesn't occur in borophene. The script will:\n1.  Define a pump laser wavelength and a signal photon wavelength.\n2.  Use the energy conservation equation ($\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{pump}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{signal}} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{idler}}$) to calculate the wavelength of the idler photon.\n3.  Print an explanation and the final equation with all the numerical values included, as requested.\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\ndef calculate_spdc_wavelengths():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates the principle of energy conservation in\n    Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC), a process not expected\n    in free-standing boron nanosheets due to their crystal symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define pump and signal wavelengths in nanometers (nm).\n    # A 405 nm laser is a common pump source.\n    # We'll use the degenerate case where the pump photon splits into two\n    # identical photons, so the signal/idler wavelength is double the pump.\n    pump_wavelength = 405.0\n    signal_wavelength = 810.0\n\n    # According to the law of energy conservation for SPDC:\n    # E_pump = E_signal + E_idler\n    # Since E = hc/λ, this becomes: hc/λ_p = hc/λ_s + hc/λ_i\n    # which simplifies to: 1/λ_p = 1/λ_s + 1/λ_i\n\n    # We can rearrange to solve for the idler wavelength:\n    # 1/λ_i = 1/λ_p - 1/λ_s\n    try:\n        # Avoid division by zero and ensure the physical condition that\n        # signal wavelength is greater than pump wavelength.\n        if pump_wavelength <= 0 or signal_wavelength <= pump_wavelength:\n            raise ValueError(\"Wavelengths must be positive, and signal wavelength must be longer than pump wavelength.\")\n            \n        inv_idler_wavelength = (1 / pump_wavelength) - (1 / signal_wavelength)\n        idler_wavelength = 1 / inv_idler_wavelength\n    \n        print(\"This script demonstrates energy conservation in Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).\")\n        print(\"\\nBased on the energy conservation equation:\")\n        print(\"1 / (Pump Wavelength) = 1 / (Signal Wavelength) + 1 / (Idler Wavelength)\\n\")\n        print(f\"For a pump photon at {pump_wavelength:.1f} nm and a detected signal photon at {signal_wavelength:.1f} nm,\")\n        print(f\"the corresponding idler photon must have a wavelength of {idler_wavelength:.1f} nm.\\n\")\n\n        print(\"The full equation with these values is:\")\n        print(f\"1 / {pump_wavelength:.1f} = 1 / {signal_wavelength:.1f} + 1 / {idler_wavelength:.1f}\")\n\n    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred during calculation: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_spdc_wavelengths()\n\n```\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets are not generally expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion because their common, stable crystal structures possess inversion symmetry, which forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes.>>>"
