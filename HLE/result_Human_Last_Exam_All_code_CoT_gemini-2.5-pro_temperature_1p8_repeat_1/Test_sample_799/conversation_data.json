    "This is a fascinating question that lies at the intersection of number theory, harmonic analysis, and fractal geometry. The answer is a well-known result in these fields.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Sidon Set and Hausdorff Dimension:** Briefly explain the key concepts involved. A Sidon set is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique. Hausdorff dimension is a way to measure the \"size\" or complexity of a set, particularly for fractals.\n2.  **State the Upper Bound:** Reference the mathematical theorem that establishes a maximum possible value for the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in `[0, 1]`. This theorem states that the dimension cannot be greater than 1/2.\n3.  **State the Lower Bound:** Reference the complementary theorem which shows that it's possible to construct Sidon sets with dimensions that get arbitrarily close to this upper bound. Specifically, for any `α < 1/2`, a Sidon set of dimension `α` can be constructed.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Combining these two results, the \"maximum\" value, which is technically the supremum or least upper bound, is exactly 1/2.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** Since this is a theoretical result and not a computational one, the Python code will serve to explain these steps and print the final answer, including the numbers in the resulting fraction, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hausdorff_dimension_of_sidon_set():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the known mathematical answer for the maximum\n    Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the interval [0, 1].\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Introduction to the concepts\n    print(\"This problem addresses a known result in mathematical analysis.\")\n    print(\"1.
