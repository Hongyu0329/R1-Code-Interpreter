    # Main theoretical results
    print("\nThe solution is based on two key theorems:")
    print(" - Theorem 1 (Upper Bound): The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in [0, 1] must be less than or equal to 1/2.")
    print(" - Theorem 2 (Lower Bound): For any number 'alpha' less than 1/2, a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of 'alpha' can be constructed.")

    # Conclusion
    print("\nCombining these theorems, we find that the dimension can get arbitrarily close to 1/2, but never exceed it.")
