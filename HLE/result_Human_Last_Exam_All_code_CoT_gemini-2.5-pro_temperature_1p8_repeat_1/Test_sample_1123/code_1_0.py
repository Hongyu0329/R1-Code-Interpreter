    print("1. The experiment uses a technique called photo-affinity labeling. A photosensitizer absorbs light and activates a probe, which then covalently labels proteins.")
    
    print("\n2. In the first experiment, the probe contains a 4-hydroxyphenyl group (a phenol). In the presence of light and a photosensitizer, a strong fluorescent signal is observed. This indicates efficient protein labeling.")
    
    print("\n3. The proposed mechanism is that the excited photosensitizer oxidizes the phenol on the probe. This reaction generates a highly reactive intermediate: a phenoxyl radical.")
    
    print("\n4. This phenoxyl radical is the species that attacks and forms a covalent bond with nearby proteins, causing the labeling.")
    
    print("\n5. The second experiment is a crucial control. The probe's phenol group (-OH) is replaced with a benzyl alcohol group (-CH2OH).")
    
    print("\n6. Benzyl alcohols are much more difficult to oxidize than phenols. Therefore, the phenoxyl radical cannot be formed with this second probe.")
    
    print("\n7. The experimental result confirms this: the labeling efficiency (fluorescent signal) is 'much lower' with the second probe.")
    
    print("\n8. Conclusion: The large difference in labeling between the two probes is due to the ability of Probe 1 to form a phenoxyl radical and the inability of Probe 2 to do so. Therefore, the phenoxyl radical is the key molecule leading to the observed effect.")
