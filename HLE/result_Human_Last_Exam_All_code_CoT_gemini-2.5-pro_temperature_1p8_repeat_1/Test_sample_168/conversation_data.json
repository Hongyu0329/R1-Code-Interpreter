    "To determine which animal can hear human muscle twitches, we need to compare the frequency of the sound produced by muscle contractions with the hearing ranges of the animals listed.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Establish the frequency range of sounds produced by human muscle twitches. These are very low-frequency sounds, primarily in the infrasonic range.\n2.  Review the hearing range of each animal in the answer choices.\n3.  Identify the animal whose hearing range includes the frequency of a muscle twitch.\n4.  The code will print out this step-by-step reasoning, including the relevant frequency numbers, to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_animal_hearing_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes animal hearing ranges to determine which might hear a human muscle twitch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the frequency of a human muscle twitch.\n    # Muscle contractions produce very low-frequency sounds (mechanomyography).\n    muscle_twitch_frequency_min = 5  # Hz\n    muscle_twitch_frequency_max = 25 # Hz\n    print(f\"The sound from a human muscle twitch is very low frequency.\")\n    print(f\"Frequency Range of Muscle Twitch: {muscle_twitch_frequency_min} Hz to {muscle_twitch_frequency_max} Hz.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Compare this frequency with the hearing ranges of the animals.\n    print(\"Analyzing the hearing ranges of the potential animals:\")\n    print(\" - A. Dog: ~67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. Cannot hear below 67 Hz.\")\n    print(\" - B. Bat: ~2,000 Hz to 110,000 Hz (ultrasonic). Cannot hear low frequencies.\")\n    print(\" - C. Herring: Has a very wide range, from <1 Hz to over 3,000 Hz. Can hear infrasound.\")\n    print(\" - D. Whale (Baleen): ~10 Hz to 39,000 Hz. Can hear some, but Herring are notably sensitive.\")\n    print(\" - E. Human: ~20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Can barely hear the upper range of a twitch, missing most of it.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude which animal's range fits.\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"The Herring's hearing range starts below 1 Hz, which fully covers the sound produced by a muscle twitch.\")\n    \n    # Final 'Equation' / Comparison:\n    herring_min_freq = 1\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Comparison:\")\n    print(f\"Muscle Twitch ({muscle_twitch_frequency_min}-{muscle_twitch_frequency_max} Hz) is within Herring's hearing range (<{herring_min_freq} Hz and up).\")\n\nsolve_animal_hearing_puzzle()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
