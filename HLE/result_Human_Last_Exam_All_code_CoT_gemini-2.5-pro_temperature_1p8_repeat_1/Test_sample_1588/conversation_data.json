    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use Witt's formula for the dimension of the free Lie algebra on `k` generators. The number of linearly independent terms of degree `n` in the BCH formula for two operators `X` and `Y` corresponds to the number of basic Lie commutators of length `n` in two variables, which is given by this formula.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the appropriate formula:** The number of coefficients of a specific order `n` in the BCH expansion for `k` generators is calculated using Witt's formula:\n    `L_k(n) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} mu(d) * k^(n/d)`\n    where `mu` is the Möbius function, and the sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n\n2.  **Define the parameters:**\n    *   The order `n` is 10.\n    *   The number of generators `k` is 2 (for operators `X` and `Y`).\n\n3.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   Find the divisors of `n=10`, which are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n    *   Calculate the Möbius function `mu(d)` for each divisor `d`.\n        *   `mu(1) = 1`\n        *   `mu(2) = -1`\n        *   `mu(5) = -1`\n        *   `mu(10) = mu(2*5) = 1`\n    *   Substitute these values into Witt's formula:\n        `L_2(10) = (1/10) * [mu(1)*2^(10/1) + mu(2)*2^(10/2) + mu(5)*2^(10/5) + mu(10)*2^(10/10)]`\n    *   Compute the numerical result.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that defines the necessary functions (for divisors and the Möbius function) and then performs the calculation step-by-step, printing out each part of the equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of the prime factors of n.\n    The keys are the prime factors and the values are their powers.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        while temp_n % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        factors[temp_n] = factors.get(temp_n, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    - mu(1) = 1\n    - mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    - mu(n) = (-1)^k if n is a product of k distinct primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    \n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef solve_bch_coefficient_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of nonzero BCH coefficients\n    for a given order n and number of generators k.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # Order of the expansion\n    k = 2   # Number of generators (e.g., X and Y)\n\n    print(\"The number of nonzero coefficients is given by Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"L_k(n) = (1/n) * sum over d|n ( mu(d) * k^(n/d) )\")\n    print(\"\\nFor order n=10 and k=2 generators:\")\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    total_sum = 0\n    sum_terms = []\n    value_terms = []\n\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power_val = n // d\n        term_val = mu_d * (k**power_val)\n        total_sum += term_val\n\n        # Formatting for display\n        mu_str = f\"({mu_d})\" if mu_d < 0 else str(mu_d)\n        sum_terms.append(f\"{mu_str} * {k}^{power_val}\")\n        value_terms.append(f\"{mu_str} * {k**power_val}\")\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(f\"L_2(10) = (1/{n}) * [ {' + '.join(sum_terms).replace('+ -', '- ')} ]\")\n    print(f\"L_2(10) = (1/{n}) * [ {' + '.join(value_terms).replace('+ (', '- ').replace(')', '')} ]\")\n    print(f\"L_2(10) = (1/{n}) * [ {1024} - {32} - {4} + {2} ]\")\n    print(f\"L_2(10) = (1/{n}) * [ {total_sum} ]\")\n    print(f\"L_2(10) = {result}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_bch_coefficient_count()\n```\n<<<99>>>"
