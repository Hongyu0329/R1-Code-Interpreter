def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    Solves the problem by analyzing the properties of aposyndetic continua.

    The logic proceeds in the following steps:
    1. For an aposyndetic continuum, the set of non-block points is identical
       to the set of non-cut-points.
    2. The problem thus becomes finding the minimum possible number of
       non-cut-points in an aposyndetic continuum.
    3. A non-degenerate continuum (e.g., an arc [0,1]) has at least two
       non-cut-points. The arc has exactly 2, {0, 1}.
    4. We must consider the degenerate continuum: a single-point space X = {p}.
       This space satisfies all the required definitions.
       - It is a continuum (compact, connected, Hausdorff).
       - It is aposyndetic (the condition on distinct points is vacuously true).
       - Its only point 'p' is a non-cut-point because X \\ {p} is the empty
         set, which is connected.
    5. Therefore, the set of non-cut-points (and thus non-block points) for X={p}
       is {p}, which has cardinality 1.
    6. Since any non-empty continuum has at least one non-cut-point, the
       minimum possible cardinality is 1.
