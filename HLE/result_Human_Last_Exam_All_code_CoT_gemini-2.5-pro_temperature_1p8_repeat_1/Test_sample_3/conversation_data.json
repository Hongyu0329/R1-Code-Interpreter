    "This problem asks for the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The study of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields is a deep area of number theory.\n\nThe possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields, including $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, have been completely classified. The classification is the result of work by several mathematicians, including S. Kamienny, M. Kenku, F. Momose, and P. Parent.\n\nMy plan is to use this classification to solve the problem. I will write a Python script that:\n1.  Stores a list of the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. These are of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$.\n2.  Calculates the order, which is the product $m \\times n$, for each of these groups.\n3.  Determines and prints the maximum order among them.\n4.  Finally, I will display the equation for the largest order.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \n    The possible torsion structures are known from deep theorems in number theory.\n    This script uses the known classification for Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over\n    # quadratic fields, the non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur over K = Q(sqrt(-3))\n    # are of the form Z/mZ x Z/nZ, where (m, n) are in the following list.\n    possible_groups = [\n        # Groups of the form Z/2Z x Z/2NZ for N in {1, 2, 3, 6}\n        (2, 2),\n        (2, 4),\n        (2, 6),\n        (2, 12),\n        # Groups of the form Z/3Z x Z/3NZ for N in {1, 2, 3}\n        (3, 3),\n        (3, 6),\n        (3, 9),\n        # The group Z/6Z x Z/6Z, which occurs only over Q(sqrt(-3))\n        (6, 6)\n    ]\n\n    max_order = 0\n    largest_group_factors = None\n\n    print(\"Analyzing possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over Q(sqrt(-3)):\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    for m, n in possible_groups:\n        order = m * n\n        print(f\"Group: Z/{m}Z x Z/{n}Z,  Order Calculation: {m} * {n} = {order}\")\n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n            largest_group_factors = (m, n)\n            \n    if largest_group_factors is None:\n        print(\"\\nNo non-cyclic groups found in the list.\")\n        # Exit if for some reason the list was empty\n        return\n        \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"\\nThe largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup is {max_order}.\")\n    \n    m, n = largest_group_factors\n    print(f\"This maximum order comes from the group Z/{m}Z x Z/{n}Z.\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the largest order is:\")\n    print(f\"{m} * {n} = {max_order}\")\n\nsolve_torsion_order()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
