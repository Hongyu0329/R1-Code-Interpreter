    This function calculates the value of R based on the problem's parameters.

    The solvability condition for the system of differential equations is:
    x_0^2 + y_0^2 + z_0^2 = R^2
    where R^2 = alpha / (1 - exp(-T)).

    Substituting alpha = (1/2)*(exp(2T) - 1) and simplifying, we get:

    This function calculates R = sqrt( (exp(T) * (exp(T) + 1)) / 2 )
