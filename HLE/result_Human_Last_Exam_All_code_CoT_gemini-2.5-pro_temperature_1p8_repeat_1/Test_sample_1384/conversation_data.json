    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  The problem is to find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of the number $N = e^{-7^{13}}$.\n2.  Since $N$ is expected to be a very small positive number, its decimal representation will start with many zeros after the decimal point (e.g., $0.000...d_1d_2...$). We are looking for the digits $d_1$ and $d_2$.\n3.  To find these leading digits, we can analyze the base-10 logarithm of $N$. The formula for the base-10 logarithm of $N$ is:\n    $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e)$.\n4.  Let's call the value of this logarithm $x$. Any decimal number $x$ can be expressed as the sum of its integer part and its fractional part: $x = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{x\\}$, where $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the integer part (which will be a large negative integer in this case) and $\\{x\\}$ is the fractional part, satisfying $0 \\le \\{x\\} < 1$.\n5.  From $x = \\log_{10}(N)$, we can write $N = 10^x$. Substituting the separated form, we get:\n    $N = 10^{\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{x\\}} = 10^{\\{x\\}} \\times 10^{\\lfloor x \\rfloor}$.\n6.  The term $10^{\\lfloor x \\rfloor}$ is an integer power of 10, which determines the magnitude of the number, i.e., the position of the decimal point.\n7.  The term $S = 10^{\\{x\\}}$ is called the significand (or mantissa) of the number $N$. Since $0 \\le \\{x\\} < 1$, the significand $S$ will be a number in the range $1 \\le S < 10$. The digits of $S$ are precisely the significant digits of our original number $N$.\n8.  The task thus simplifies to calculating the value of $S$ and extracting its first two digits (the digit before the decimal point and the first digit after it).\n9.  This calculation involves very large and very precise numbers, so we need to use a high-precision arithmetic library. Python's built-in `decimal` module is well-suited for this.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan. It will:\na. Set a high precision for the calculations.\nb. Compute $7^{13}$.\nc. Compute $\\log_{10}(e)$ to high precision using the identity $\\log_{10}(e) = 1 / \\ln(10)$.\nd. Calculate $x = -7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e)$.\ne. Isolate the fractional part $\\{x\\}$.\nf. Compute the significand $S = 10^{\\{x\\}}$.\ng. Print the intermediate values used in the \"final equation\" for clarity.\nh. Extract and display the first two non-zero digits from the resulting significand.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef find_first_two_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the precision for the decimal calculations to a high value for accuracy.\n    decimal.getcontext().prec = 100\n\n    # The number is N = e^(-7^13).
