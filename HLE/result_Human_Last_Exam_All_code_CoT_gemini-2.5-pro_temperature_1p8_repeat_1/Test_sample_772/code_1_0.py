# 1. Define the dimension of the group G = SO_3(R).
# SO_3(R) is the group of rotations in 3D space, which is a 3-dimensional manifold.
d = 3

# 2. State the general formula for the exponent alpha.
# For a compact simple Lie group of dimension d, the number of products n required
# for a set of measure 1/N to cover the group scales as n ~ N^(1/d).
# This is derived from a scaling argument involving the volume of small balls.
# The asymptotic relation is n(N) ~ N^alpha, so we have alpha = 1/d.

# 3. Define the numbers in the final equation for alpha.
numerator = 1
denominator = d

# 4. Output the final equation and its components as requested.
print(f"The equation for alpha is based on the dimension of the group, d = {d}.")
print(f"The final equation is: alpha = {numerator} / {denominator}")

# 5. Calculate and print the numerical value of alpha.
alpha_value = numerator / denominator
print(f"The numerical value of alpha is: {alpha_value}")
