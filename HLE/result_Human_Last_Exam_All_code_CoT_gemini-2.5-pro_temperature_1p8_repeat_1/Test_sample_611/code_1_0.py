# Step 1: Determine the asymptotic density of the Wiener sausage.
# Based on the analysis, the process X_t does not have an asymptotic velocity,
# as |X_t| grows like exp(sqrt(t)), which is sub-linear in the exponent.
# For a 2D Brownian-like process with no asymptotic velocity, the density of its sausage (of any positive radius) is 1.
# This means the sausage covers almost the entire complex plane.
c = 1

# Step 2: Define the threshold from the problem.
threshold = 2/3

# Step 3: Compare the density with the threshold.
# We are interested in the limit of P(V_n > threshold).
# Since V_n converges in probability to c, this limit is 1 if c > threshold, and 0 if c < threshold.

is_greater = c > threshold

# Step 4: The final result for the probability.
if is_greater:
    final_probability = 1
else:
    # This case also covers the unlikely scenario where c == threshold,
    # where the limit might be 1/2 or other values depending on the distribution,
    # but based on our analysis c is exactly 1.
    final_probability = 0
