    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze its structure to find the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule's name indicates a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring substituted at the 1, 3, and 5 positions with three identical large groups. This arrangement gives the molecule a `C3` rotational axis of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the three large substituent \"arms\" are chemically equivalent, and the three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are also equivalent. This simplifies the problem significantly, as we only need to count the unique signals from the central core and one of the substituent arms.\n\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core and Linkers:**\n    *   **Core Methyl Groups:** The three methyl groups on the central benzene ring (at positions 2, 4, 6) are equivalent by `C3` symmetry. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **Linker Methylene Groups:** There are three methylene (`-CH2-`) groups linking the benzene ring to the indazole substituents. While the three `-CH2-` groups are equivalent by symmetry, the carbon atom of each `-CH2-` is prochiral. It is attached to the chiral indazole group, which makes the two protons on the `-CH2-` group diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent), especially given the steric hindrance that restricts bond rotation. Therefore, one set of three equivalent protons will produce one signal, and the other set of three equivalent protons will produce a second signal. This results in **2 signals** from the linkers.\n\n3.  **Count Signals from One Substituent Arm:**\n    We only need to analyze one of the `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)` arms. This is a rigid, chiral moiety, so protons in chemically different environments will produce separate signals.\n    *   **Pyrazole ring proton:** There is one proton on the five-membered pyrazole ring. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   **Bridgehead proton:** There is one proton on the bridgehead carbon of the camphor-like skeleton (C4). This is **1 signal**.\n    *   **Saturated ring methylene protons:** There are two `CH2` groups in the saturated six-membered ring (C5 and C6). In the rigid bicyclic system, the `exo` and `endo` protons of each `CH2` group are diastereotopic. Since the C5 and C6 positions are not equivalent, this results in `2 * 2 =` **4 signals**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl group:** The methyl group at the C7 bridgehead is unique. This is **1 signal**.\n    *   **Geminal dimethyl groups:** The two methyl groups at C8 are diastereotopic because of the overall asymmetry of the molecule. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   Summing these up, the total from one arm is `1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 =` **9 signals**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Signals:**\n    By adding the signals from all the unique parts, we get the total number of expected peaks.\n    *   Total Signals = (Core Methyls) + (Linker Protons) + (One Arm)\n    *   Total Signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of expected 1H NMR signals for the given molecule.\n# The method involves analyzing the molecule's symmetry and counting the number of\n# chemically non-equivalent proton environments.\n\n# 1. Define signals from the central core of the molecule.\n# The molecule has C3 symmetry, making the 3 methyl groups on the benzene ring equivalent.\nsignals_from_core_methyls = 1\n\n# The 3 -CH2- linker groups are also equivalent. However, each -CH2- group is attached\n# to a chiral center, making its two protons diastereotopic. This results in two distinct signals.\nsignals_from_linkers = 2\n\n# 2. Define signals from one of the three identical substituent arms.\n# The arm is a rigid, chiral structure without internal symmetry. We count each unique proton environment.\n#   - 1 signal from the proton on the pyrazole ring.\n#   - 1 signal from the bridgehead proton.\n#   - 4 signals from the four non-equivalent protons of the two CH2 groups in the saturated ring.\n#   - 1 signal from the methyl group on the bridgehead.\n#   - 2 signals from the two diastereotopic geminal methyl groups.\n# The total number of signals from one arm is the sum of these individual signals.\nsignals_from_one_arm = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2\n\n# 3. Calculate the total number of signals by summing the contributions from each part.\ntotal_signals = signals_from_core_methyls + signals_from_linkers + signals_from_one_arm\n\n# 4. Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result.\nprint(\"Calculation of total expected 1H NMR signals:\")\nprint(f\"Signals from equivalent core methyl groups: {signals_from_core_methyls}\")\nprint(f\"Signals from diastereotopic linker CH2 groups: {signals_from_linkers}\")\nprint(f\"Signals from one substituent arm: {signals_from_one_arm}\")\nprint(\"---\")\nprint(f\"Total signals = {signals_from_core_methyls} (core methyls) + {signals_from_linkers} (linkers) + {signals_from_one_arm} (one arm) = {total_signals}\")\n\n```\n<<<H>>>"
