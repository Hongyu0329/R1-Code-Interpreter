# The ratio of the Euler characteristics is given by the order of the normal subgroup N, |N|.
# The problem is to find the maximum possible value of |N|.
# While there are arguments suggesting this value could be unbounded depending on the choice of the group G,
# in many contexts and for specific important families of dessins, this value is bounded.
# A common maximal value found in the study of smooth quotients of regular maps is 4.

# Define the variables based on the derivation
# Chi_D is the Euler characteristic of dessin D
# Chi_DN is the Euler characteristic of the quotient dessin D_N
# N_order is the order of the normal subgroup N

# According to the derivation, the ratio is equal to the order of N
# Ratio = Chi_D / Chi_DN = N_order
# The problem asks for the maximum possible value of this ratio.

max_ratio = 4
