    "My plan is to demonstrate how critical-level views in population ethics violate the \"Non-Elitism\" principle, which is one of the conditions in Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\n1.  **Define Critical-Level Views:** I will start by explaining that these views evaluate a population by summing the value of each life, where the value is defined as an individual's welfare minus a fixed \"critical level.\"\n2.  **Define the Non-Elitism Principle:** I'll explain this principle, which states that a large number of people with low but positive welfare can, in principle, be better than one person with very high welfare.\n3.  **Create a Numerical Example:** I will set up a clear example with specific numbers for the critical level, a high welfare level, and a low positive welfare level (that is still below the critical level).\n4.  **Show the Conflict:** Using the formula from the critical-level view, I will calculate the value of adding one high-welfare person versus adding many low-welfare people. The code will print out each step of the calculation, showing that the value of adding any number of the low-welfare people is always negative and can therefore never outweigh the positive value of the single high-welfare person.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The script will conclude that this directly violates the Non-Elitism principle and identify the corresponding answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_arrhenius_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and demonstrates which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem\n    is violated by critical-level views using a step-by-step numerical example.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program will demonstrate how Critical-Level Views violate the 'Non-Elitism' principle.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # 1.
