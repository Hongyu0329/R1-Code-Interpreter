    """
    This function solves the mathematical problem by determining the cardinalities of S/A, B/S, and H1(B/A, Q).

    Step-by-step derivation:
    1.  Initial Object A: The initial object in the category of scales (maps s: Z -> P) is the identity map on the integers, A = (a: Z -> Z). Its associated prescale is P_A = Z.

    2.  Terminal Object B: For a morphism from any scale to B to be unique, B's prescale must be the trivial group {0}. So, B = (b: Z -> {0}). Its prescale is P_B = {0}. While b is a trivial map, this is the only way for a terminal object to exist in the broader category containing the scales.

    3.  Scale S: S is the inclusion map s: Z -> *R, where *R is the prescale of hyperreals. P_S = *R.

    4.  Cardinality of S/A:
        - S/A is the quotient P_S / im(h_AS), where h_AS: P_A -> P_S is the canonical map.
        - The map h_AS is the inclusion Z -> *R. Its image is the set of standard integers in *R, which is isomorphic to Z.
        - The quotient is *R / Z.
        - The cardinality of the hyperreals *R is |R^N / U| = (2^Aleph_0)^Aleph_0 = 2^Aleph_0, which is the continuum c, or Beth_1.
        - The cardinality of the quotient |*R / Z| is also Beth_1.
        - So, card_1 = "Beth_1".

    5.  Cardinality of B/S:
        - B/S is the quotient P_B / im(h_SB), where h_SB: P_S -> P_B is the canonical map.
        - The map h_SB is the zero map from *R to {0}. Its image is {0}.
        - The quotient is {0} / {0}, the trivial group.
        - Its cardinality is 1.
        - So, card_2 = 1.

    6.  Cardinality of H_1(B/A, Q):
        - The space B/A is the quotient P_B / im(h_AB).
        - The map h_AB: P_A -> P_B is the zero map from Z to {0}. Its image is {0}.
        - The space B/A is {0} / {0}, which is a single point space.
        - The first homology group of a point, H_1({pt}, Q), is the trivial group {0}.
        - Its cardinality is 1.
        - So, card_3 = 1.

    7.  Final Answer Assembly: The three cardinalities are (Beth_1, 1, 1).
