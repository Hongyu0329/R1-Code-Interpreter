# Number of sets
n = 2024
# Size of each set
k = 45

# As deduced from the problem's constraints, the only possible structure for the sets
# forces the existence of a single element common to all sets.
# Let this common element be 'c'.
# The size of the union of all sets is the sum of the sizes of the parts of each set
# that are unique to it, plus the single common element.
# Each set contributes k-1 unique elements.
# The total size is 1 (for the common element) + n * (k - 1).

# Perform the calculation
k_minus_1 = k - 1
result = 1 + n * k_minus_1

# Print the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.
