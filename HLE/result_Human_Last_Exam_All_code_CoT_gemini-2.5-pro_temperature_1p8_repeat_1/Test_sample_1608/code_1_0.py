    print("   - AKP1 and RIB3 together are required to sense 'flagpep140-168'. The ROS signal is 2x10^6 RLUs only when both are present, versus 2x10^2 RLUs when they are alone. This points to a receptor/co-receptor complex.")
    print("   - YKL23 confers response to 'csp192-208' (ROS: 2x10^6 RLUs vs 2x10^2 RLUs in wt), indicating it's a receptor for it.")
    print("   - KIB1 strongly enhances the response to 'flagpep25-40' (ROS: 2x10^8 RLUs vs 2x10^6 RLUs in wt), suggesting a downstream amplification role.")
    
    print("\n2. From Split Luciferase (Exp 2):")
    print("   - KIB1 physically interacts with AKP1 (RLU: 8x10^5).")
    print("   - KIB1 does not physically interact with RIB3 (RLU: 2x10^2).")

    print("\n3. From GFP Localization (Exp 3):")
    print("   - AKP1 and RIB3 are at the plasma membrane (100% signal).")
    print("   - Upon 'flagpep140-168' treatment, KIB1 translocates from the plasma membrane (75% -> 20%) to the nucleus (5% -> 50%). This is a classic downstream signaling event.")

    print(f"  - The ROS experiment shows that perception of 'flagpep140-168' requires both AKP1 and RIB3. The ROS reading was 2x10^2 for 'Arabidopsis + AKP1' and 2x10^2 for 'Arabidopsis + RIB3', but 2x10^6 for 'Arabidopsis + AKP1+ RIB3'. This co-dependence strongly supports that they form a functional receptor complex.")
