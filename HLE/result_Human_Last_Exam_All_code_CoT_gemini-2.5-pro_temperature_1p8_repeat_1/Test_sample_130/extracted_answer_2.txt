As t approaches infinity, the repeated application of the local median filter causes the edges in the binary image to evolve. Specifically, the edges become smoother as sharp corners and small details are eliminated. The total length of the edges tends to decrease, which causes convex shapes to shrink (and eventually disappear if they are small enough) and edges separating large regions to straighten. The process is a discrete computational analogue of mean curvature flow.
