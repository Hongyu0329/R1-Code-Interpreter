    "The user wants to determine the largest possible weight of a topological group $G$ with specific properties.\n\n### Method\n1.  **Analyze the given properties of the group G**:\n    *   $G$ is a compact topological group.\n    *   $G$ is first-countable, meaning it has a countable local base at each point. The character of the group is $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   The cardinality of $G$ is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$, where $\\frak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n    *   $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff.\n\n2.  **Deduce whether G is Hausdorff**:\n    A key result in the theory of topological spaces is Arhangel'skii's theorem, which states that a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff space has a cardinality of at most $\\frak{c}$.\n    The given cardinality of our group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$, which is strictly greater than $\\frak{c}$.\n    If $G$ were Hausdorff, its cardinality would have to be less than or equal to $\\frak{c}$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $G$ must be a non-Hausdorff group.\n\n3.  **Utilize the structure of non-Hausdorff topological groups**:\n    In any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The group is Hausdorff if and only if $N = \\{e\\}$. Since $G$ is non-Hausdorff, $N$ is a non-trivial subgroup.\n    The quotient group $H = G/N$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n    The properties of being compact and first-countable are inherited by the quotient group $H$. Thus, $H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n4.  **Bound the weight of the quotient group H**:\n    Since $H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group, we can apply Arhangel'skii's theorem to it. This implies that the cardinality of $H$ is bounded: $|H| \\le \\frak{c}$.\n    The weight of any topological space is at most its cardinality, so we have $w(H) \\le |H|$.\n    Combining these results, we find an upper bound for the weight of $H$: $w(H) \\le \\frak{c}$.\n\n5.  **Relate the weight of G to the weight of H**:\n    Let $\\pi: G \\to H$ be the canonical quotient map.\n    *   Since $\\pi$ is a continuous and open surjective map, it can be shown that the weight of the domain $G$ is equal to the weight of the codomain $H$. So, $w(G) = w(H)$.\n    *   Combining with the previous step, we get $w(G) \\le \\frak{c}$. This means the weight of any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions cannot exceed $\\frak{c}$.\n\n6.  **Show that this upper bound can be achieved**:\n    To prove that $\\frak{c}$ is the largest *possible* weight, we must construct an example of such a group $G$ that has weight $\\frak{c}$.\n    *   Let $K$ be a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group with weight $w(K) = \\frak{c}$. A standard example is the circle group $\\mathbb{T}$ (the set of complex numbers with modulus 1, under multiplication).\n    *   Let $N_{abs}$ be any abstract group with cardinality $2^{2^\\frak{c}}$.\n    *   Construct the group $G$ as the direct product $G = N_{abs} \\times K$.\n    *   Define a topology on $G$ where the open sets are of the form $N_{abs} \\times V$, for any open set $V$ in $K$. This topology makes $G$ a topological group.\n    *   This constructed group $G$ is compact, first-countable, has cardinality $|N_{abs}| \\times |K| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}} \\cdot \\frak{c} = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$, and is non-Hausdorff (since $\\overline{\\{e_G\\}} = N_{abs} \\times \\{e_K\\}$).\n    *   The weight of this group is $w(G) = w(K) = \\frak{c}$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**:\n    We have shown that for any group $G$ with the given properties, its weight must be less than or equal to $\\frak{c}$. We also constructed an example of such a group where the weight is exactly $\\frak{c}$. Therefore, the largest possible weight is $\\frak{c}$. The final equation for the maximum weight is $w_{max} = \\frak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function calculates and prints the largest possible weight of the described topological group.\n  The reasoning is based on cardinal invariants of topological groups and Arhangel'skii's theorem.\n  The final result for the maximum weight is c (the cardinality of the continuum), which is equal to 2**aleph_0.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # The final equation is w_max = 2**aleph_0\n  # We represent aleph_0 as a string for printing purposes.\n  equation = \"w_max = 2**aleph_0\"\n  num_1 = 2\n  num_2 = 0\n\n  print(\"The final equation for the largest possible weight is:\")\n  print(equation)\n  print(\"\\nThe numbers in this final equation are:\")\n  print(num_1)\n  print(num_2)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<$2^{\\aleph_0}$>>>"
