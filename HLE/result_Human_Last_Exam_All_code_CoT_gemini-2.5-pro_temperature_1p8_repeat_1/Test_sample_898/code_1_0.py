    This script models the logical propositions as sets to demonstrate
    the tautology in option C. In quantum logic, these propositions
    are subspaces, but the specific property holds for sets as well.

    - a: Represents particles with momentum in a given range.
    - b: Represents particles in position interval [-1, 1].
    - c: Represents particles in position interval [-1, 3].

    The crucial fact is that any particle in [-1, 1] is also in [-1, 3],
    meaning the set for 'b' must be a subset of the set for 'c'.
