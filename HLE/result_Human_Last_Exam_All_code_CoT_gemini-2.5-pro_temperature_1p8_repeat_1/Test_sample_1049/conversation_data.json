    "Here is a plan to find the closed form for the sum:\n1.  Let the sum be $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$. The term $\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the square of the generating function for central binomial coefficients, which equals $4^n$. This suggests that the closed form for $S_n$ might be of the form $P(n) \\cdot 4^n$, where $P(n)$ is a polynomial in $n$.\n2.  I will write a Python script to compute the value of $S_n$ for small values of $n$ (e.g., n=0, 1, 2, 3).\n3.  Then, I will compute the corresponding values of $P(n) = S_n / 4^n$.\n4.  By observing the values of $P(n)$, I will guess the degree of the polynomial. Let's assume it's a cubic polynomial of the form $P(n) = An^3 + Bn^2 + Cn + D$.\n5.  Using the computed values of $P(0), P(1), P(2), P(3)$, I will set up a system of four linear equations with four variables (A, B, C, D).\n6.  I will solve this system to find the integer coefficients A, B, C, and D.\n7.  Finally, I will present the closed form $S_n = (An^3 + Bn^2 + Cn + D) \\cdot 4^n$ and verify that it works.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef combinations(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Computes the binomial coefficient C(n, k)\"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    if k > n // 2:\n        k = n - k\n    \n    res = 1\n    for i in range(k):\n        res = res * (n - i) // (i + 1)\n    return res\n\ndef calculate_Sn(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the sum S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k, k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\"\"\"\n    total_sum = 0\n    for k in range(n + 1):\n        term = ( (2 * k + 1)**5 * \n                 combinations(2 * k, k) * \n                 combinations(2 * n - 2 * k, n - k) )\n        total_sum += term\n    return total_sum\n\ndef find_closed_form():\n    \"\"\"Finds the polynomial P(n) such that S_n = P(n) * 4^n\"\"\"\n    # Calculate S_n for n = 0, 1, 2, 3\n    S_values = [calculate_Sn(n) for n in range(4)]\n    \n    # Calculate P(n) = S_n / 4^n\n    P_values = [S_values[n] // (4**n) for n in range(4)]\n    \n    # We assume P(n) = An^3 + Bn^2 + Cn + D.\n    # We set up a system of linear equations M * x = P_values\n    # where x = [D, C, B, A]\n    M = np.array([\n        [1, 0, 0, 0],  # n=0\n        [1, 1, 1, 1],  # n=1\n        [1, 2, 4, 8],  # n=2\n        [1, 3, 9, 27]  # n=3\n    ])\n    \n    # Solve for the coefficients [D, C, B, A]\n    coeffs = np.linalg.solve(M, P_values)\n    D, C, B, A = [int(round(c)) for c in coeffs]\n    \n    print(\"The closed form for the sum is of the form: (A*n^3 + B*n^2 + C*n + D) * 4^n\")\n    print(f\"The calculated coefficients are: A={A}, B={B}, C={C}, D={D}\")\n    print(\"\\nSo the closed form is:\")\n    \n    # Format the output nicely\n    def format_term(coeff, power):\n        if coeff == 0:\n            return \"\"\n        \n        sign = \"+ \" if coeff > 0 else \"- \"\n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n        \n        if power == 0:\n            return f\"{sign}{abs_coeff}\"\n        \n        coeff_str = str(abs_coeff) if abs_coeff != 1 else \"\"\n        power_str = f\"n^{power}\" if power > 1 else \"n\"\n            \n        return f\"{sign}{coeff_str}{power_str}\"\n\n    poly_str = f\"({A}n^3 {format_term(B, 2)}{format_term(C, 1)}{format_term(D, 0)}) * 4^n\"\n    poly_str = poly_str.replace(\"(+\", \"(\").replace(\" -\", \"- \").replace(\"+\", \"+ \")\n    print(f\"S_n = {poly_str}\\n\")\n    \n    # Verification\n    print(\"Verification for n=0, 1, 2, 3:\")\n    for n in range(4):\n        s_val = S_values[n]\n        formula_val = (A * n**3 + B * n**2 + C * n + D) * (4**n)\n        print(f\"For n={n}:\")\n        print(f\"  Direct Sum S_{n} = {s_val}\")\n        print(f\"  Formula Result = {formula_val}\")\n        print(f\"  Match: {s_val == formula_val}\")\n\nfind_closed_form()\n\n```\n<<< (425*n^3 - 780*n^2 + 476*n + 1) * 4^n >>>"
