    "This is a sophisticated cryptography design problem. Designing a secure threshold signature scheme requires careful consideration of cryptographic principles. One of the leading designs that meets your criteria for a **t-out-of-n threshold signature** with a **two-round signing protocol** and a **tight security proof** is **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signatures)**.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Explain the FROST Protocol**: I will first break down the design of the FROST protocol into its main phases: Key Generation, a two-round Signing process, and Signature Verification. This will provide the conceptual blueprint for the scheme.\n2.  **Provide a Python Implementation**: I will then write a Python script that simulates the entire FROST protocol. This code will serve as a concrete example of the design. For clarity, it will use integer arithmetic modulo a prime number, which is the foundation of elliptic curve cryptography, rather than a full elliptic curve library.\n3.  **Demonstrate Verification**: The script will conclude by performing a signature verification, printing out each component of the final verification equation as requested to show that the signature is valid.\n\n### FROST Protocol Design\n\nThe protocol operates over a cryptographic group (like an elliptic curve) with a generator `G` and a prime order `q`.\n\n**1. Key Generation (Centralized)**\n\nA trusted dealer (or a more complex Distributed Key Generation protocol) is needed to set up the keys:\n*   The dealer chooses a secret polynomial `f(x) = a_0 + a_1*x + ... + a_{t-1}*x^{t-1}` where `t` is the threshold. The coefficients `a_i` are random secrets.\n*   The master secret key for the group is `a_0`.\n*   The group's public key is `Y = a_0 * G`.\n*   The dealer gives each of the `n` participants `P_i` (for `i` in `1..n`) a unique secret share `s_i = f(i)`.\n\n**2. Two-Round Signing Protocol**\n\nWhen a group of `t` participants wants to sign a message `m`:\n\n*   **Round 1: Commitment**\n    1.  Each of the `t` participating signers `P_i` secretly generates two random nonces (`d_i`, `e_i`).\n    2.  Each signer computes and broadcasts their *commitments* `D_i = d_i * G` and `E_i = e_i * G`.\n\n*   **Round 2: Signature Share Generation**\n    1.  After all commitments are received, an aggregator (who can be one of the signers) computes a unique *binding factor* `b_i` for each participant by hashing the message and all commitments.\n    2.  The group commitment `R` is calculated by summing all individual commitments, weighted by their binding factor: `R = Σ(D_i + b_i * E_i)`.\n    3.  A challenge `c` is computed by hashing the group's public key `Y`, the group commitment `R`, and the message `m`: `c = H(Y, R, m)`.\n    4.  Each participant `P_i` calculates their partial signature: `z_i = d_i + e_i*b_i + c*L_i*s_i`, where `L_i` is the Lagrange coefficient for that participant and `s_i` is their secret share. They send `z_i` to the aggregator.\n\n**3. Aggregation and Verification**\n\n*   The aggregator collects the `t` partial signatures and sums them to create the final signature value `z = Σ(z_i)`. The complete signature is the pair `(R, z)`.\n*   Anyone can verify the signature by checking if `z * G == R + c * Y`.\n\nThis two-round design is provably secure against forgery attacks and ensures that no single participant can bias the final signature.\n\nHere is a Python script demonstrating the full process.\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport random\n\n# A class to represent a FROST participant\nclass Participant:\n    def __init__(self, id, secret_share, group):\n        self.id = id\n        self.secret_share = secret_share\n        self.group = group\n        self.d_i, self.e_i = None, None # Nonces for one signing session\n        self.D_i, self.E_i = None, None # Commitments for one signing session\n\n    # Round 1: Generate nonces and commitments\n    def commit(self):\n        self.d_i = random.randrange(1, self.group['q'])\n        self.e_i = random.randrange(1, self.group['q'])\n        self.D_i = (self.d_i * self.group['G']) % self.group['q']\n        self.E_i = (self.e_i * self.group['G']) % self.group['q']\n        return (self.D_i, self.E_i)\n\n    # Round 2: Generate signature share\n    def sign(self, message, commitments_map, lagrange_coeff, public_key):\n        # The participant would receive the full list of commitments from the coordinator\n        # and re-calculate R and c to ensure the coordinator is honest.\n        # Here we assume the coordinator-provided values are correct.\n        \n        # Calculate binding factor for this participant\n        all_commitments_flat = []\n        # Sort by participant ID for a deterministic hash\n        for pid in sorted(commitments_map.keys()):\n            all_commitments_flat.extend(commitments_map[pid])\n\n        # b_i = H(m, {D_k, E_k}, i)\n        binding_factor_i = H(message, *all_commitments_flat, self.id, q=self.group['q'])\n        \n        # Re-create R and c locally for security\n        group_commitment_R = 0\n        for j, (Dj, Ej) in commitments_map.items():\n            binding_factor_j = H(message, *all_commitments_flat, j, q=self.group['q'])\n            term = (Dj + binding_factor_j * Ej) % self.group['q']\n            group_commitment_R = (group_commitment_R + term) % self.group['q']\n        \n        challenge_c = H(public_key, group_commitment_R, message, q=self.group['q'])\n\n        # z_i = d_i + (e_i * b_i) + (L_i * s_i * c)\n        term1 = self.d_i\n        term2 = (self.e_i * binding_factor_i) % self.group['q']\n        term3 = (lagrange_coeff * self.secret_share) % self.group['q']\n        term4 = (term3 * challenge_c) % self.group['q']\n        \n        z_i = (term1 + term2 + term4) % self.group['q']\n        return z_i\n\n# Helper functions\ndef H(*args, q):\n    \"\"\"A hash function that returns an integer modulo q.\"\"\"\n    s = \"\".join(map(str, args))\n    return int(hashlib.sha256(s.encode()).hexdigest(), 16) % q\n\ndef modInverse(n, modulus):\n    \"\"\"Compute the modular inverse of n using Fermat's Little Theorem.\"\"\"\n    return pow(n, modulus - 2, modulus)\n\ndef lagrange_coeff(i, S, q):\n    \"\"\"Computes the Lagrange coefficient L_i for participant i in set S.\"\"\"\n    num = 1\n    den = 1\n    for j in S:\n        if i == j:\n            continue\n        num = (num * j) % q\n        den = (den * (j - i)) % q\n    return (num * modInverse(den, q)) % q\n\ndef run_frost_demo():\n    \"\"\"Demonstrates the FROST threshold signature scheme.\"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
