def find_tacitus_quote():
  """
  This script provides the five-word Latin quote requested by the user.
  
  The quote is from Tacitus' "Agricola," Chapter 33, from the speech
  Agricola gave before the Battle of Mons Graupius.
  
  The original text reads "omnis in victoria spes" (four words), with the
  verb "est" (is) being implied, a common feature in Latin.
  
  When the implied verb is included for a complete quotation, the phrase
  becomes "omnis in victoria spes est" (five words). This thematically
  mirrors the phrase from Cornelius Nepos about the necessity of battle.
  
  The output will be in all lowercase and without punctuation as requested.
