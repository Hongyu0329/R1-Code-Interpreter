    Computes the partial derivative D_x rho(alpha, beta) based on the problem description.

    The signed distance function rho from a point (u,v) to the curve y=x^5 is
    rho(u,v), and its nearest point on the curve is (x, x^5).
    We are given that for (u,v) = (alpha, beta), the nearest point has x=1.

    The L-infinity distance being minimized implies that at the solution x,
    we have |u-x| = |v-x^5|.
    Also, (alpha, beta) is above the curve, so rho is positive and signs of
    (u-x) and (v-x^5) can be determined to be negative and positive respectively.
    
    This leads to two equations for rho(u,v) and x(u,v):
    1) rho = x - u
    2) rho = v - x^5

    From this, we get an implicit equation for x(u,v): x^5 + x = u + v.
    We need to compute D_x rho, which is the partial derivative of rho with respect to u.
    
    Differentiating rho = v - x^5 w.r.t u:
    d(rho)/du = -5 * x^4 * d(x)/du

    Differentiating x^5 + x = u + v w.r.t u:
    5 * x^4 * d(x)/du + d(x)/du = 1
    d(x)/du * (5 * x^4 + 1) = 1
    d(x)/du = 1 / (5 * x^4 + 1)

    Substituting d(x)/du back into the expression for d(rho)/du:
    d(rho)/du = -5 * x^4 / (5 * x^4 + 1)

    We evaluate this at the point where the closest x-coordinate is 1.
