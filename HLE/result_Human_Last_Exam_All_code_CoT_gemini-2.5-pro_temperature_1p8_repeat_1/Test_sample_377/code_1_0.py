    """
    This function calculates the number of blocks for the group algebra kG.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The number of blocks of kG (char k = 2) equals the number of conjugacy classes of 2'-elements (odd order elements) of G.
    2. G is 2-solvable as it has a normal 2-subgroup D. The number of blocks of kG equals the number of blocks of k(G/D) = kS.
    3. The group S has order 27, which is odd. Thus, the algebra kS is semisimple.
    4. For a semisimple algebra, the number of blocks is the number of conjugacy classes of S.
    5. We compute the number of conjugacy classes of S = 3^{1+2}_+, the extraspecial group of order 27 and exponent 3.

    The group S has a presentation <a, b | a^3=b^3=c^3=1, c=[a,b], c is central>.
    An element is represented by a tuple (i, j, k) for a^i b^j c^k.
    Multiplication (a^i1 b^j1 c^k1) * (a^i2 b^j2 c^k2) is a^(i1+i2) b^(j1+j2) c^(k1+k2-i2*j1).
