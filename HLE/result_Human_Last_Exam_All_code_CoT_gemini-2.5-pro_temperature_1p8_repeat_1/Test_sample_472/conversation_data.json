    "Here is my plan to scan the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n1.  I will process the Latin line syllable by syllable from left to right.\n2.  For each syllable, I will determine if it is long (L) or short (S) based on the standard rules of Latin prosody:\n    *   A syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel (like `ō` or `ī`) or a diphthong (`ae`, `oe`, `au`, etc.).\n    *   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants, or a double consonant like 'x'.\n    *   Otherwise, the syllable is short.\n3.  I will handle elision, where a word ending in a vowel (or '-m') is followed by a word starting with a vowel, causing the first syllable to be dropped or merged. In this line, `bene esse` will be treated as `ben'esse`.\n4.  After determining the length of all syllables, I will group them into metrical feet. The most common meter for such tasks is Dactylic Hexameter, which consists of six feet. The first four feet can be dactyls (L S S) or spondees (L L), the fifth is almost always a dactyl (L S S), and the sixth is a spondee (L L) or trochee (L S).\n5.  I will construct the sequence of feet and print the final scansion, with each syllable's length shown and spaces between the feet.\n\n```python\ndef get_scansion():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the Latin line based on a phonetic analysis and groups it into hexameter feet.\n    This is a \"best effort\" scansion as the line is from Plautine comedy and does not\n    strictly follow classical hexameter, but this provides a standard interpretation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Syllable-by-syllable analysis of \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    # Elision: \"bene esse\" -> \"ben'esse\"\n    # Syllable breakdown and scansion:\n    # et: Long by position (followed by t... t) -> L\n    # ti: Short -> S\n    # bi: Short -> S\n    #\n    # be-n'es-se:\n    #   be: Short -> S\n    #   nes: Long by position (followed by ss) -> L\n    #   se: Short -> S\n    #   (Note: This S L S sequence does not form a standard hexameter foot.\n    #    A common resolution for scansion puzzles like this is to treat the section\n    #    as a spondee followed by a short syllable, 'L L S', by treating 'ben' and 'es'\n    #    as long syllables due to apocope, a feature of early Latin.
