To answer the question, we must consider how "concrete feedback that emphasizes immediate next steps" interacts with each stage of Hidi and Renninger's model.

*   **Phase 1: Triggered Situational Interest (Choice A)**
    At this stage, interest is brief and passively sparked. While feedback might be positive, the student's engagement is too fleeting for the feedback to have a lasting, long-term developmental impact.

*   **Phase 2: Maintained Situational Interest (Choice B)**
    Interest here is held by external factors like an engaging task or teacher. The feedback is very useful for success in the immediate context, but since the motivation is still primarily external, it doesn't necessarily build the *internal* drive required for a significant long-term shift.

*   **Phase 3: Emerging Individual Interest (Choice C)**
    This is the most critical stage for this type of feedback. The student has started to value the topic and engage voluntarily, but their interest is still fragile. They often face challenges they don't know how to overcome. Concrete, actionable feedback on "what to do next" directly empowers them, builds their competence, and increases their sense of self-efficacy. This support is crucial for preventing frustration and helping their interest solidify into a stable, long-term individual interest. Therefore, the long-term impact is most significant here.

*   **Phase 4: Well-Developed Individual Interest (Choice D)**
    A student at this stage already possesses a deep, self-sustaining interest. They are capable of generating their own next steps and overcoming challenges independently. While they still benefit from feedback, it is often more high-level. The specific type of feedback mentioned (immediate next steps) is less impactful than it is for a student who is still learning *how* to engage with the subject.

*   **Conclusion on Choice E**:
    While concrete feedback is broadly beneficial, its *developmental significance* is not equal across all stages. It is most transformative during the emerging interest phase.

Therefore, the student with an emerging individual interest is the one for whom this feedback provides the most significant long-term impact.
