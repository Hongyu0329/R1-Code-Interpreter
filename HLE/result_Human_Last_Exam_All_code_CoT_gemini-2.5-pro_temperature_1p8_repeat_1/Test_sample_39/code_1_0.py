    print("Step 1: Interpret Statement P in Large Cardinal Theory")
    print("The existence of a nontrivial elementary embedding j:V→M is a central concept in large cardinal theory.")
    print("A key theorem by Dana Scott shows that statement P is precisely equivalent to the axiom: 'There exists a measurable cardinal.'")
    print("Thus, the question is really asking about the relationship between the existence of an inaccessible cardinal and a measurable cardinal.")

    print("The statement P asserts a much stronger large cardinal axiom: 'There exists a measurable cardinal'.")

    print("\nCan S prove P?")
    print("No. If the weaker system S could prove the stronger statement P, it would be proving the consistency of a strictly stronger theory relative to itself. By Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem, this is not possible (assuming S is consistent). Therefore, A is incorrect.")

    print("\nCan S disprove P?")
    print("No. If S could disprove P, it would mean 'ZFC + ∃ inaccessible' proves that no measurable cardinals can exist. This would imply 'ZFC + ∃ measurable' is inconsistent. However, the consistency of these theories is a foundational assumption of modern set theory, and a weaker theory like S cannot disprove the consistency of a stronger one. Therefore, B and D are incorrect.")
    
    print("\nIs P meaningless?")
    print("No. The statement is well-formed within the language of ZFC, making E incorrect.")
