    "Of course. This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The process involves two steps. First, the reaction of an aromatic compound with a strong base (sec-BuLi/TMEDA), and second, the reaction of the intermediate with an electrophile (methyl iodide).\n2.  **Identify the Key Features:** The starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, has two functional groups on a benzene ring: a tertiary amide (-CONEt₂) and a dimethylamino group (-NMe₂). Both of these are known as \"Directed Metalation Groups\" (DMGs).\n3.  **Apply DoM Rules:** In a Directed ortho-Metalation, the strong base removes a proton from the position *ortho* (adjacent) to the DMG. When multiple DMGs are present, the reaction is directed by the strongest group. The tertiary amide group is a significantly stronger directing group than the dimethylamino group. Furthermore, since the two groups are *meta* to each other, they both synergistically direct the deprotonation to the C-2 position (the carbon atom located between them), making that proton the most acidic on the ring.\n4.  **Determine the Product:** The first step creates a carbanion at the C-2 position. In the second step, this powerful nucleophile attacks the methyl iodide, adding a methyl group at the C-2 position.\n5.  **Construct the Final Answer:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic step-by-step and programmatically constructs the name of the final product, highlighting the positional numbers as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that outlines the process and provides the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_organic_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a two-step organic reaction and determines the final product.\n    Reaction: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide reacts first with sec-BuLi/TMEDA\n              and then with methyl iodide.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
