    # Given constants
    c1 = 10**4
    y = 10**5

    # The problem provides l1 and alpha1:
    # l1 = (1 + 10**5)**5
    # alpha1 = (1 + 10**5)**6 * (1 - 10**5 + 10**10)
    # The structure of these values suggests a hidden relationship. Let's analyze it.
    # Let y = 10**5.
    # l1 = (1 + y)**5
    # alpha1 = (1 + y)**6 * (1 - y + y**2)
    # We know the sum of cubes factorization: (1 + y^3) = (1 + y) * (1 - y + y**2)
    # So, (1 - y + y**2) = (1 + y**3) / (1 + y).
    # Substituting this into the expression for alpha1:
    # alpha1 = (1 + y)**6 * (1 + y**3) / (1 + y) = (1 + y)**5 * (1 + y**3)
    # We can see that alpha1 = l1 * (1 + y**3).
    # Therefore, alpha1 / l1 = 1 + y**3.

    # Based on this analysis, we can infer that x11 = alpha1 / l1.
    x11 = 1 + y**3
    
    # From the matrix equation:

    # | 0  0 | | x21 x22 | + | x21 x22 | = | 0 1 | + | 0 c2 | | 0 u2 |
    #
    # The left side becomes:
    # | x21  x22 |   | x11 x12 |   | x11+x21  x12+x22 |
    # |  0    0  | + | x21 x22 | = |   x21      x22   |
    #
    # The right side becomes:
    # | 1  0 |   | c1*u1  0    |   | 1+c1*u1     0     |
    # | 0  1 | + |  0   c2*u2  | = |    0      1+c2*u2 |
    #
    # Equating the elements at position (2,1) gives: x21 = 0.
    # Equating the elements at position (1,1) gives: x11 + x21 = 1 + c1*u1.
    # Substituting x21 = 0, we get: x11 = 1 + c1*u1.

    # We have two expressions for x11, so we can set them equal to solve for u1:
    # x11 = 1 + c1*u1  =>  u1 = (x11 - 1) / c1
    
    # Let's calculate the numerical value of u1.
    rhs = x11 - 1
