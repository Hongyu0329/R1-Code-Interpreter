    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify and count all the independent continuous transformations that leave the equations invariant.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the types of symmetries:** The symmetries of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations form a group. We will list the distinct families of transformations within this group. These include translations, rotations, boosts, and scalings.\n2.  **Count the parameters for each symmetry type:** For each family of transformations (e.g., spatial translations), we will count the number of independent parameters required to define a transformation. This number is the dimension of that particular subgroup of symmetries.\n3.  **Sum the dimensions:** The total dimension of the full Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of all the independent symmetry types.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that assigns a variable to the dimension of each symmetry type and then sums them up to find the total dimension. The script will print the final equation showing how the total is calculated.\n\nThe symmetry transformations are:\n*   **Time translations:** Shifting the time origin ($t \\to t + \\delta t_0$). This is 1 parameter.\n*   **Space translations:** Shifting the spatial origin ($\\vec{x} \\to \\vec{x} + \\delta \\vec{x}_0$). In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this has 3 parameters.\n*   **Spatial rotations:** Rotating the coordinate system ($\\vec{x} \\to R\\vec{x}$). The rotation group in 3D, SO(3), has a dimension of 3.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** Shifting to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity ($\\vec{x} \\to \\vec{x} - \\vec{v}_0 t$). This has 3 parameters for the velocity vector $\\vec{v}_0$.\n*   **Pressure shift:** Shifting the pressure by a constant ($p \\to p + p_0$). This is 1 parameter.\n*   **Scaling:** A specific scaling transformation of all variables ($t \\to \\lambda^2 t, \\vec{x} \\to \\lambda \\vec{x}, \\vec{u} \\to \\lambda^{-1}\\vec{u}, p \\to \\lambda^{-2} p$). This is controlled by 1 parameter, $\\lambda$.\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of the number of parameters from each of these independent symmetries.\n\n```python\n# The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations\n# in R^3 is the sum of the dimensions of its independent one-parameter subgroups.\n\n# Number of parameters for time translation (t -> t + a)\ntime_translations = 1\n\n# Number of parameters for space translations (x -> x + b) in R^3\nspace_translations = 3\n\n# Number of parameters for spatial rotations in R^3 (group SO(3))\nspatial_rotations = 3\n\n# Number of parameters for Galilean boosts (x -> x - v*t) in R^3\ngalilean_boosts = 3\n\n# Number of parameters for the pressure shift (p -> p + c)\npressure_shift = 1\n\n# Number of parameters for the scaling transformation of space, time, velocity, and pressure\nscaling_symmetry = 1\n\n# The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of all these symmetries.\ntotal_dimension = (time_translations + \n                   space_translations + \n                   spatial_rotations + \n                   galilean_boosts + \n                   pressure_shift + \n                   scaling_symmetry)\n\n# Print the full equation as requested\nprint(\"The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries is the sum of the dimensions of each independent transformation:\")\nprint(f\"{time_translations} (time translation) + \"\n      f\"{space_translations} (space translations) + \"\n      f\"{spatial_rotations} (spatial rotations) + \"\n      f\"{galilean_boosts} (Galilean boosts) + \"\n      f\"{pressure_shift} (pressure shift) + \"\n      f\"{scaling_symmetry} (scaling)\")\nprint(f\"= {total_dimension}\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"
