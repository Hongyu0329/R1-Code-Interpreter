# The value t for which we need to calculate x(t).
t_val_string = "ln(10^20)"

# For t = ln(10^20), we have the following values:
# e^t = exp(ln(10^20)) = 10^20
# e^-t = exp(-ln(10^20)) = 10^-20
e_t = 1e20
e_neg_t = 1e-20

# The particular solution to the ODE is x(t) = 2 * (2 - e^-t) / (e^t + e^-t).
# The numbers in the final equation for our specific t are:
num1 = 2
num2 = 2
num3 = e_neg_t
num4 = e_t
num5 = e_neg_t

# As requested, here is the final equation with all numbers specified.
print(f"The final equation to be calculated is:")
print(f"x({t_val_string}) = ({num1} * ({num2} - {num3})) / ({num4} + {num5})")
print("")

# Calculate the value using these numbers.
# Note: In standard floating point arithmetic, 2.0 - 1e-20 is computationally equal to 2.0,
# and 1e20 + 1e-20 is equal to 1e20.
# The calculation simplifies to (2 * 2) / 1e20.
numerator = num1 * (num2 - num3)
denominator = num4 + num5
result = numerator / denominator

# Print the final result
print(f"The result of x({t_val_string}) is:")
