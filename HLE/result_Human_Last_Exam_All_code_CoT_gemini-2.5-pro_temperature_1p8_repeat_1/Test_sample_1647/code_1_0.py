# The plan is as follows:
# 1.  Analyze the problem to determine the necessary physical formulas. The core task is to calculate gravitational time dilation, which requires the Schwarzschild radius of the central body (Pegasi).
# 2.  Use Kepler's Third Law with the provided orbital data for the exoplanet Pandora to find the mass of Pegasi, which is then used to find its Schwarzschild radius. A simplified formula for the Schwarzschild radius will be derived to make calculations more direct.
# 3.  The time dilation formula involves a square root. Given the constraints of the Bagua architecture (which likely lacks a built-in `sqrt` function), a Taylor series approximation (f â‰ˆ 1 + Rs / 2r) will be used, valid for distances where Rs << r.
# 4.  Design a memory-efficient C program for the Bagua architecture. This involves selecting the smallest possible data types for each variable (char, wchar, frac) and minimizing the total number of variables declared.
# 5.  Calculate the total memory usage 'z' of this conceptual C program in trits based on the sizes specified in the Bagua architecture.
# 6.  Execute the physical calculations using Python to find the time dilation factor 'f' for the given distance d = 13 km.
# 7.  Finally, print the result in the specified format 'f:z', with 'f' rounded to three decimal places. The script will also show the numbers used in the final equations.

# Constants and inputs from the problem statement
T_days = 800.0  # Orbital period of Pandora in Earth days
a_km = 100000000.0  # Orbital radius of Pandora in km
d_km = 13.0  # Pioneer's distance from the event horizon in km

# The formula for Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is derived by combining Kepler's Third Law
# and the standard Rs formula. This gives a direct formula: Rs = (8 * pi^2 * a^3) / (T^2 * c^2)

# frac c;               // For 3e8
# frac a_km;            // For 100,000,000 (too large for a 24-bit int)
# unsigned wchar T_days;// For 800 (fits in 12 bits)
# unsigned char d_km;   // For 13 (fits in 6 bits)
# frac Rs;              // Intermediate result for the radius
# frac f;               // Final result for the factor
