    Solves the problem of finding the number of cardinalities in the interval [|T1|, |T2|].
    
    The problem provides the following information for two trees, T1 and T2:
    - Height of each tree: omega_2
    - Cardinality of each level: omega (countably infinite)
    
    The cardinality of a tree is the total number of its nodes.
    This is calculated by summing the cardinalities of all its levels.
