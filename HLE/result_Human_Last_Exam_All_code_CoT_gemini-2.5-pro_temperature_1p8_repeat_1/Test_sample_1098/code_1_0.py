    explanation = """
This thought experiment describes a system that challenges the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The frictionless one-way door acts as "Maxwell's demon."

1.  **Initial State vs. Final State:** The system starts with gas equally distributed in two compartments, a state of maximum entropy (disorder). The goal is to trap all the gas in one compartment, which is a state of very low entropy (high order). According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, this spontaneous decrease in entropy in an isolated system is impossible.

2.  **The Role of the Door:** The apparatus can only work if the "demon" (the one-way door) can operate without being influenced by the thermal chaos of the gas. This setup is known as a Brownian ratchet.

3.  **The Problem of Thermal Equilibrium:** As explained by physicist Richard Feynman, if the door is at the same temperature as the gas, it will also experience random thermal vibrations (Brownian motion). These vibrations would cause it to randomly open from both directions, meaning a molecule could pass back just as easily as it passed through initially. No gas would accumulate on one side.

4.  **The Required Condition:** For the door to function as a perfect, truly "one-way" valve, it must be shielded from thermal fluctuations. This is only possible if the door itself is at a temperature where thermal motion ceases: absolute zero (0 Kelvin). At 0 K, the door would be static and would not randomly jiggle open to let gas molecules back through.

5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the experimental parameter that must be controlled to a specific value (absolute zero) for the demon to succeed is Temperature. The apparatus requires a temperature difference between the gas and the door mechanism.
