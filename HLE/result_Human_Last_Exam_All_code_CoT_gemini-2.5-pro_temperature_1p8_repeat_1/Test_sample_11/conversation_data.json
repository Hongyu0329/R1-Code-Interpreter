    "My plan is to identify the specific Israeli statute that is widely recognized by legal scholars as being the first to introduce the principle of \"good faith\" as a foundational and general concept in a major area of law. I will then create a Python script to print the name of this statute, as per the user's request.\n\n```python\n# The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly and fundamentally\n# introduce the concept of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"tom lev\") as a general,\n# overarching principle governing a major field of private law was the\n# Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973.\n#\n# This script prints the name of that statute.\n\nstatute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\n\nprint(statute_name)\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which was the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\"?
