    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the mathematical functions:** First, I will represent the given supply `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` and demand `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` equations as Python functions.\n\n2.  **Find the Market Equilibrium:** Market equilibrium occurs where the supply price equals the demand price (`P_S = P_D`). This gives us the equation `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`. This equation is transcendental and cannot be solved algebraically. Therefore, I will use a numerical solver, specifically `fsolve` from the `scipy.optimize` library, to find the equilibrium quantity (`Q_e`). Once `Q_e` is found, the equilibrium price (`P_e`) can be calculated by substituting `Q_e` into either the supply or demand function.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It can be calculated by finding the total area between the demand curve and the supply curve from Q=0 up to the equilibrium quantity `Q_e`.\n    *   The demand function is defined for all `Q >= 0`.\n    *   The supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined when `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > cbrt(2)`. Let's call this minimum quantity `Q_min`.\n    *   The total welfare is calculated with the definite integral:\n        `Total Welfare = ∫[0 to Q_e] (Demand Function) dQ - ∫[Q_min to Q_e] (Supply Function) dQ`\n    *   I will use the `quad` function from the `scipy.integrate` library to perform this numerical integration.\n\n4.  **Display the Result:** Finally, I will print the calculated equilibrium quantity and price. Then, I'll show the values of the two integrals that make up the total welfare calculation and present the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_and_calculate_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines supply and demand, finds their equilibrium,\n    and calculates the total economic welfare.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions\n    # Demand: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\n    def demand_p(q):\n        return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\n    # Supply: P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\n    def supply_p(q):\n        # This function is only defined for Q > cbrt(2).\n        # We will only integrate it over its valid domain.\n        # For the solver, an error for invalid input is fine\n        # as long as the initial guess is in the valid domain.\n        return np.log(q**3 - 2)\n\n    # Step 2: Find the market equilibrium (Q_e, P_e)\n    # We need to solve the equation: supply_p(q) = demand_p(q)\n    # or equilibrium_equation(q) = supply_p(q) - demand_p(q) = 0\n    def equilibrium_equation(q):\n        return supply_p(q) - demand_p(q)\n\n    # Provide an initial guess for the root-finding algorithm.\n    # From inspection, Q must be > cbrt(2) ~= 1.26.
