# The final result of the calculation is derived from the mass formula for arithmetic quotients
# over function fields. The reasoning is as follows:
#
# 1. The total mass in question is given by the expression M = (q_v * (q - 1) / (q_v - 1)) * mass(mu).
# 2. The mass of the measure mu on the space GL_n^1(K_hat) / GL_n(R) is calculated
#    by decomposing the space via the determinant map.
# 3. This leads to mass(mu) = vol(SL_n(K_hat)/SL_n(R)) * vol(O^x / R^x).
# 4. The first term, vol(SL_n(K_hat)/SL_n(R)), is 1 by the theory of Tamagawa numbers for SL_n.
# 5. The second term, vol(O^x / R^x), is 1/(q-1) based on the measure normalization.
# 6. Therefore, mass(mu) = 1 / (q - 1).
# 7. Substituting this back, the expression becomes M = (q_v * (q - 1) / (q_v - 1)) * (1 / (q - 1)) = q_v / (q_v - 1).
# 8. As the value of q_v (the order of the residual field) is not specified, a common approach in this
#    field is to consider the asymptotic limit as q_v approaches infinity.
# 9. The limit of q_v / (q_v - 1) as q_v -> infinity is 1.
