    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions for the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$. The order of the variables matters, meaning $(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_5)$ is a distinct solution from a permutation of its values if they are not all equal.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Rephrasing the Problem**: We are looking for the number of ordered 5-tuples of non-negative integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ whose squares sum to 2024. This is a classic counting problem that can be solved using generating functions. The problem is equivalent to finding the coefficient of $z^{2024}$ in the polynomial expansion of $(\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} z^{i^2})^5$.\n\n2.  **Method - Dynamic Programming**: I will use a dynamic programming approach, which is an efficient way to compute powers of a polynomial. The largest integer whose square is less than or equal to 2024 is $\\lfloor\\sqrt{2024}\\rfloor = 44$. So, our polynomial is effectively $(\\sum_{i=0}^{44} z^{i^2})^5$.\n\n3.  **DP State**: I'll use a dictionary (or a hash map) `dp` where `dp[k]` stores the number of ways a sum `k` can be formed using a certain number of squared terms.\n\n4.  **Algorithm**:\n    a.  First, establish the list of perfect squares that can contribute to the sum. These are $0^2, 1^2, 2^2, \\dots, 44^2$.\n    b.  Initialize a `dp` mapping for a single term sum. For each square `s`, `dp[s] = 1`.\n    c.  Iteratively build up the solution for sums of two, three, four, and finally five squares. To get the counts for `i` squares, we 'convolve' the counts for `i-1` squares with the list of single squares.\n    d.  In simpler terms, for each sum `k` achievable with `i-1` squares, we add each possible square `s` and increment the count for the new sum `k+s`.\n    e.  After iterating up to 5 terms, the value `dp[2024]` will hold the total number of solutions.\n\n5.  **Output**: The final Python code will calculate this value and print it in a descriptive message that includes the original equation's numbers, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_sum_of_squares_solutions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation:\n    x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    target_sum = 2024\n    num_variables = 5\n    \n    # The maximum value for any x_i is floor(sqrt(2024)) = 44.\n    max_val = int(target_sum**0.5)\n    squares = [i * i for i in range(max_val + 1)]\n    \n    # dp[k] will store the number of ways to write k as a sum of i squares.\n    # We initialize it for i=1.
