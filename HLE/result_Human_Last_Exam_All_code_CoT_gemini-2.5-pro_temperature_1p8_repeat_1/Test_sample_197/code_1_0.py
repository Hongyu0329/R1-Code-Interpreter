    Simulates the given Structural Equation Model to check if correlation implies causation between A and D.
    
    SEM: E -> A -> B -> C <- D <- E
    
    Analysis:
    In this model, A and D are not causally linked (i.e., there is no arrow from A to D or D to A).
    However, both A and D are caused by a common variable, E. This is known as a "common cause" or "confounder" structure (A <- E -> D).
    A common cause induces a spurious correlation between its effects. We expect A and D to be correlated
    even though neither causes the other. This simulation demonstrates this principle.
