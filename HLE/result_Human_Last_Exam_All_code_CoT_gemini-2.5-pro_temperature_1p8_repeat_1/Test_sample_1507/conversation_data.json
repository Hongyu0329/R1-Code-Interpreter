    "The problem asks for the number of visible triangles from the outside of a great icosahedron. This is equivalent to finding the number of faces of its convex hull.\n\n1.  **Identify the object's convex hull:** The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its vertices are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, its convex hull (the smallest convex shape that encloses it) is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Count the faces of the convex hull:** We need to find the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\n3.  **Properties of an icosahedron:** A regular icosahedron is one of the five Platonic solids, and it is defined as having 20 faces. Each face is an equilateral triangle.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The number of triangles needed to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\nHere is the Python code to present this result.\n\n```python\n# The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron.\n# Its convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n# The number of visible triangles on the outer-hull is equal to the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\n\n# A regular icosahedron has 20 faces, which are all triangles.\nnumber_of_triangles = 20\n\n# Print the result as a descriptive equation.\nprint(f\"Number of triangles = {number_of_triangles}\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
