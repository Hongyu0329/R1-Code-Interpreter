    "The problem asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$. This space is the real Grassmannian manifold $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\nFirst, let's identify the mathematical objects and properties:\n1.  **The Space:** The space is the real Grassmannian $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. It's known to be diffeomorphic to $Gr_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, since taking the orthogonal complement of a $k$-plane in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ gives an $(n-k)$-plane.\n2.  **The Cohomology Ring:** We are interested in the integral cohomology ring, $H^*(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. Unlike the case of complex Grassmannians (which are torsion-free), the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians can have torsion. The torsion consists entirely of elements of order 2.\n3.  **The Torsion Subgroup:** Let $T$ be the torsion subgroup of $H^*(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. It is an elementary abelian 2-group, meaning it is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n4.  **The Rank:** The question asks for the \"rank\" of this torsion subgroup. In this context, this means the dimension of $T$ as a vector space over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This is equivalent to the number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands in its decomposition.\n\nThere are several formulas in the mathematical literature for calculating this rank. Due to the diffeomorphism $Gr_k(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cong Gr_{n-k}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, any valid formula must give the same result for both representations of the space. Based on a synthesis of results from various sources (notably Hiller, Stong, Korbaš, and Lörinc), a consistent formula can be established.\n\n**The Formula:**\nTo calculate the rank of the torsion subgroup of $H^*(Gr_k(\\mathbb{R}^n); \\mathbb{Z})$, let $k' = \\min(k, n-k)$ and $m' = \\max(k, n-k)$. The rank is the number of integer pairs $(i, j)$ that satisfy the following two conditions:\n1.  $1 \\le j < i \\le m'$\n2.  $k' - i + j$ is an odd number.\n\nFor the given problem, $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, we have $k=3$ and $n=5$.\n*   $k' = \\min(3, 5-3) = \\min(3, 2) = 2$.\n*   $m' = \\max(3, 5-3) = \\max(3, 2) = 3$.\n\nWe need to count the integer pairs $(i, j)$ such that $1 \\le j < i \\le 3$ and the value $2 - i + j$ is odd.\n\nThe following Python code implements this counting procedure to find the rank.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_torsion_rank(k, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology\n    of the real Grassmannian Gr_k(R^n).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let k_prime = min(k, n-k) and m_prime = max(k, n-k).\n    # The rank is the number of pairs (i, j) with 1 <= j < i <= m_prime\n    # such that (k_prime - i + j) is odd.\n    \n    k_prime = min(k, n - k)\n    m_prime = max(k, n - k)\n    \n    print(f\"For the Grassmannian Gr({k}, R^{n}):\")\n    print(f\"We use the symmetric formula where k' = min({k}, {n-k}) = {k_prime} and m' = max({k}, {n-k}) = {m_prime}.\")\n    print(\"The rank is the number of pairs (i, j) such that 1 <= j < i <= m' and (k' - i + j) is odd.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through all pairs (i, j) where 1 <= j < i <= m_prime\n    for i in range(2, m_prime + 1):\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            value = k_prime - i + j\n            \n            print(f\"Checking pair (i={i}, j={j}):\")\n            # This is the \"equation\" for each step, as requested.\n            print(f\"  Value = {k_prime} - {i} + {j} = {value}\")\n            \n            if value % 2 != 0:\n                print(f\"  Result: {value} is odd.
