# The problem asks for the largest real number r such that for a specific
# decomposition of a 4x4 square into 16 unit-area polygons, any
# axis-aligned unit square S has an intersection with at least one
# polygon of area r or more.

# The optimal value of r is widely conjectured to arise from the most
# regular decomposition: a simple grid of 16 1x1 squares.
# We analyze this case to find the value of r.

# A test unit square S can overlap with at most four 1x1 grid cells.
# Let the bottom-left corner of S be at a position with fractional parts (f, g)
# relative to the grid lines (0 <= f < 1, 0 <= g < 1).

# The areas of intersection with the four cells are:
# A1 = (1-f)*(1-g)  (bottom-left cell)
# A2 =   f  *(1-g)  (bottom-right cell)
# A3 = (1-f)*  g   (top-left cell)
# A4 =   f  *  g   (top-right cell)
# The sum A1+A2+A3+A4 = 1.

# The value of r for this decomposition is the minimum of the maximum
# of these areas, over all possible placements (f,g) of the square.
# r = min_{f,g} max(A1, A2, A3, A4)

# To minimize the maximum of these four areas, we should make them as
# equal as possible. This occurs when f=1/2 and g=1/2.

# Set the values for the worst-case placement
f = 0.5
g = 0.5

# Calculate r for this placement.
# This represents the minimal value of the maximal overlap, and thus the value of r for this decomposition.
r_value = (1 - f) * (1 - g)

# Display the final equation and the result, showing each number.
