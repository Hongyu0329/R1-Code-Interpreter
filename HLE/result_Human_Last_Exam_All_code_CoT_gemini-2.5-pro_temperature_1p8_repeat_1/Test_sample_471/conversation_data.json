    "To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus, we use results from differential topology, specifically Morse theory. This theory establishes a deep connection between the number of critical points of a function defined on a manifold and the topological properties of that manifold.\n\nThe topology of the 2-torus ($T^2$) can be described by its Betti numbers ($b_k$), which count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions:\n*   $b_0 = 1$: The torus is a single connected object.\n*   $b_1 = 2$: The torus has two independent, non-contractible loops (one going around the \"tube\" and one going through the \"hole\"). These correspond to 1-dimensional holes.\n*   $b_2 = 1$: The torus surface encloses a single 2-dimensional void.\n\nThe Weak Morse Inequalities state that for a well-behaved class of functions known as Morse functions, the number of critical points of a specific type (minima, saddles, maxima) is at least the corresponding Betti number.\n*   Number of minima ($c_0$) $\\ge b_0$\n*   Number of saddle points ($c_1$) $\\ge b_1$\n*   Number of maxima ($c_2$) $\\ge b_2$\n\nThis implies that the total number of critical points for any Morse function must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers. For the torus, this sum is $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$. This lower bound is achievable; for example, the height function on a torus lying flat in 3D space has exactly one minimum, two saddle points, and one maximum.\n\nA more general and powerful result, which holds for *any* non-constant smooth function (including those with degenerate critical points), states that the minimal number of critical points on a compact, connected, orientable surface of genus $g$ is $2g+2$. Since the torus has genus $g=1$, this formula also gives $2(1)+2=4$.\n\nThus, the minimal number of critical points is 4. The following Python code performs the calculation based on the sum of the Betti numbers.\n\n```python\ndef get_minimal_critical_points_on_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    on a 2-torus using its Betti numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to Morse theory, the minimal number of critical points of a smooth function\n    # on a manifold is related to its topology, described by Betti numbers.\n\n    # b_0: The 0th Betti number (number of connected components).\n    # For a torus, which is a single connected piece, b_0 = 1. This corresponds to at least one minimum.\n    b_0 = 1\n\n    # b_1: The 1st Betti number (number of 1D \"holes\" or fundamental loops).\n    # A torus has two independent loops, so b_1 = 2. This corresponds to at least two saddle points.\n    b_1 = 2\n\n    # b_2: The 2nd Betti number (number of 2D \"voids\").\n    # A torus encloses one void, so b_2 = 1.
