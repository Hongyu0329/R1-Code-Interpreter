# In the 2017 Mariinsky production of Paquita, Maria Khoreva performs the
# first female variation in the Act I Pas de Trois.

# During a diagonal sequence in her solo, she executes a cabriole devant multiple times.
# We can represent each instance as 1.
first_cabriole = 1
second_cabriole = 1
third_cabriole = 1

# The total is the sum of these instances.
total_cabrioles = first_cabriole + second_cabriole + third_cabriole

# The final output presents the "equation" as requested, showing each counted step.
print(f"In the specified variation, Maria Khoreva executed a total of {first_cabriole} + {second_cabriole} + {third_cabriole} = {total_cabrioles} cabrioles devants.")
