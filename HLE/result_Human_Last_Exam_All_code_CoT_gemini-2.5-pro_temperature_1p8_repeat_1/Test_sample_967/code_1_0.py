    # We need to compute the terms.

    # Step 3: Analyze the vertex groups G_v
    # The groups N_g are finite-index subgroups of pi_1(M_g).
    # M_g is a mapping torus of a surface S_g (g>=2), so pi_1(M_g) fibers
    # over Z with an infinite fiber pi_1(S_g).

    # So, beta_1^(2)(pi_1(M_g)) = 0.
    # By the index formula for l2-Betti numbers, beta_1^(2)(N_g) = [index] * beta_1^(2)(pi_1(M_g)) = 0.
    # The vertex groups G_v are either N_100 or free products of N_g groups.
    # The l2-Betti number beta_1^(2) is additive over free products of infinite groups.
    # Since beta_1^(2)(N_g) = 0 for all g, beta_1^(2)(G_v) is also 0 for every vertex v.
    sum_beta1_G_v = 0

    # Step 4: Analyze the edge groups G_e
    # Edge groups are "freely indecomposable free factors" of the vertex groups.
    # The vertex groups are free products of N_g groups (or just N_100).
    # The N_g groups are freely indecomposable.
    # Thus, any edge group G_e must be isomorphic to some N_k.
    # As a result, beta_1^(2)(G_e) = beta_1^(2)(N_k) = 0 for all edges e.
