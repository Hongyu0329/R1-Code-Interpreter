# This problem asks for the smallest possible size of the limit of a diagram
# F: J^op -> Set, where J is a directed poset, F(j) are non-empty sets,
# and the maps are surjective.

# As demonstrated by the reasoning, the size of the limit is always at least 1.
# This lower bound is achievable, for example, by choosing J as the natural numbers
# with their usual order, and F(n) as a singleton set {c} for all n.

# In this example, the limit has exactly one element: the constant sequence (c, c, ...).
# The size is 1.

# Therefore, the smallest possible size is 1.
# The final equation is: Smallest Possible Size = 1.
# Here we print the number from this equation.
