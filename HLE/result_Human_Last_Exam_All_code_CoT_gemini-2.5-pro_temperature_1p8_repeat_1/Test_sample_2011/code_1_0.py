def solve_max_clique_sizes(n):
    """
    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes
    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on n vertices.

    The logic is based on two main points:
    1.  An upper bound: A clique of size k requires k vertices. In a graph with n
        vertices, any induced subgraph can have at most n vertices. Thus, any
        induced clique must have size k <= n. This means the number of
        different possible clique sizes is at most n.

    2.  Achievability of the bound: The complete graph on n vertices, K_n, serves as a
        constructive proof that this upper bound can be reached. For any k
        between 1 and n, any subset of k vertices from K_n induces a clique of
        size k (K_k). Therefore, K_n contains induced cliques of all sizes from
        1 to n.

    Combining these, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is exactly n.
