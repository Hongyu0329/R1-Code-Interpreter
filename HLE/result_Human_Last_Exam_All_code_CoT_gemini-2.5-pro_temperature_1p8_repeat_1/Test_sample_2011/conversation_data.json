    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will establish an upper bound for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a graph with `n` vertices.\n2.  Next, I will demonstrate that this upper bound is actually achievable by constructing a specific graph on `n` vertices that has this number of different induced clique sizes.\n3.  Based on these two points, I will conclude what the maximum number is.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that formalizes this reasoning and prints the answer for the specific case where `n = 128`.\n\n**Step 1: Establishing an Upper Bound**\nLet `G` be a graph with `n = 128` vertices. A clique of size `k`, denoted as `K_k`, is a set of `k` vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. For `K_k` to be an induced subgraph of `G`, there must be a subset of `k` vertices in `G` that induces `K_k`. This requires that `k`, the number of vertices in the clique, cannot be greater than the total number of vertices in the graph, `n`. Therefore, any possible clique size `k` must satisfy `1 <= k <= n`. This means the set of all possible clique sizes is a subset of `{1, 2, ..., n}`. Consequently, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes cannot exceed `n`.\n\n**Step 2: Showing the Bound is Achievable**\nNow, I need to show that it is possible to construct a graph on `n` vertices that contains induced cliques of `n` different sizes. Consider the complete graph on `n` vertices, `K_n`. In this graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\nLet's choose any integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= n`. If we select any subset of `k` vertices from `K_n`, the subgraph induced by this subset will include all edges between these vertices, because all possible edges exist in `K_n`. Therefore, the induced subgraph is a clique of size `k`, i.e., `K_k`.\nSince we can do this for any `k` from 1 to `n`, the graph `K_n` has induced subgraphs isomorphic to `K_1, K_2, ..., K_n`. This means the set of different clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs in `K_n` is `{1, 2, ..., n}`. The number of different sizes in this set is `n`.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\nFrom Step 1, we know the maximum number of different clique sizes is at most `n`. From Step 2, we have a constructive example (`K_n`) that achieves exactly `n` different clique sizes. Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is `n`. For the given problem, `n = 128`, so the answer is 128.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic and provides the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_max_clique_sizes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on n vertices.\n\n    The logic is based on two main points:\n    1.  An upper bound: A clique of size k requires k vertices. In a graph with n\n        vertices, any induced subgraph can have at most n vertices. Thus, any\n        induced clique must have size k <= n. This means the number of\n        different possible clique sizes is at most n.\n\n    2.  Achievability of the bound: The complete graph on n vertices, K_n, serves as a\n        constructive proof that this upper bound can be reached. For any k\n        between 1 and n, any subset of k vertices from K_n induces a clique of\n        size k (K_k). Therefore, K_n contains induced cliques of all sizes from\n        1 to n.\n\n    Combining these, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is exactly n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    max_sizes = n\n\n    print(f\"Considering all graphs on n = {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"The task is to find the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Reasoning:\")\n    print(f\"1.
