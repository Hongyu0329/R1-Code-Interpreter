# Step 1: Define the asymptotic behavior of the escape probability p_n.
# Based on the analysis, the probability p_n scales as n^(-alpha).
# p_n ~ c * n**(-alpha) for some constants c and alpha.

# Step 2: Determine the exponent alpha.
# Our physical and mathematical reasoning leads to the conclusion that
# the Green's function G(S,S) for a walk starting on an edge of a cube of size 2n
# scales as the square root of n.
# G_n ~ K * sqrt(n)
# The escape probability p_n = 1 / G_n.
# So, p_n ~ (1/K) * n**(-1/2).
# This means the exponent alpha is 1/2.
alpha = 1/2

# Step 3: Calculate the limit based on this scaling.
# The limit to be calculated is lim_{n->inf} [ln(1/p_n) / ln(n)].
# Substituting p_n from Step 2:
# 1/p_n ~ K * n**alpha
# ln(1/p_n) ~ ln(K * n**alpha) = ln(K) + alpha * ln(n).
# The expression becomes:
# [ln(K) + alpha * ln(n)] / ln(n) = ln(K)/ln(n) + alpha.
# As n -> infinity, ln(n) -> infinity, so ln(K)/ln(n) -> 0.
# The limit is alpha.
