def solve_path_problem():
    """
    Calculates the number of distinct paths based on a combinatorial interpretation.

    The problem is interpreted as finding the number of non-empty subsets of paths
    between the two intersection points of the circle and the line segment.

    Let the intersection points be A and B. There are 3 elementary paths (edges)
    connecting them:
    1. The line segment between A and B.
    2. The first circular arc between A and B.
    3. The second circular arc between A and B.

    A "distinct path" is interpreted as a path that traverses a unique combination
    of these elementary paths. This is equivalent to choosing a non-empty subset
    from the 3 elementary paths.

    The number of subsets of a set of size n is 2^n.
    We subtract 1 to exclude the empty set, as any path from A to B must use at
    least one edge.
