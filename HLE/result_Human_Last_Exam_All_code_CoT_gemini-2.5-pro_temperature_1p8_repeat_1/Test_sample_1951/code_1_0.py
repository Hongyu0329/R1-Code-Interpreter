    Analyzes the statements about Attack Graphs and identifies the incorrect ones.

    A. Correct. Worst-case generation complexity for both graph types is exponential.
    B. Incorrect. This is an absolute statement. While common monotonic LAGs have limitations, it is theoretically possible to define a non-monotonic LAG that can represent any path an SEG can.
    C. Correct. The monotonicity assumption is the primary reason LAGs are more compact than SEGs as it prunes the state space significantly.
    D. Incorrect. Calculating probabilities in cyclic graphs is a solvable problem using methods from Markov chain theory and probabilistic model checking.
    E. Correct. The "in general" qualifier is key. Common monotonic LAGs struggle with negation as it introduces non-monotonicity, whereas SEGs handle it naturally by explicit state representation.

    The incorrect statements are B and D.
