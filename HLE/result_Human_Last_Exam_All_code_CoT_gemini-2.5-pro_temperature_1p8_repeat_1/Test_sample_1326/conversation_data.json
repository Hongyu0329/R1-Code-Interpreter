    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ over the range from $x=0$ to $x=4$.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n- $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8} = \\frac{x^3}{4}$ for $0 \\le x \\le 3$\n- $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x}$ for $3 \\le x \\le 5$\n\nSince the range of integration $0 \\le x \\le 4$ spans across the two definitions, we must split the integral at $x=3$:\n$I = \\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{x^3}{4} dx + \\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x} dx$\n\n**Step-by-step Plan:**\n\n1.  **Calculate the first integral:** $\\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{x^3}{4} dx$\n    This is a standard polynomial integral. The antiderivative of $\\frac{x^3}{4}$ is $\\frac{x^4}{16}$.\n    Evaluating this from 0 to 3 gives: $[\\frac{x^4}{16}]_{0}^{3} = \\frac{3^4}{16} - \\frac{0^4}{16} = \\frac{81}{16}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the second integral:** $\\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x} dx$\n    This integral is in the special form $\\int e^x(f(x) + f'(x))dx$, whose antiderivative is $e^x f(x)$.\n    We can rewrite the term $\\frac{1 + \\sin x}{1 + \\cos x}$ as $\\frac{1}{1 + \\cos x} + \\frac{\\sin x}{1 + \\cos x}$.\n    Using half-angle trigonometric identities, we find that if we let $f(x) = \\tan(\\frac{x}{2})$, its derivative is $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sec^2(\\frac{x}{2}) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\cos x}$. Also, $\\frac{\\sin x}{1 + \\cos x} = \\tan(\\frac{x}{2})$.\n    Thus, the integrand is $e^x(f'(x) + f(x))$, and the antiderivative is $e^x f(x) = e^x \\tan(\\frac{x}{2})$.\n    Evaluating this from 3 to 4 gives: $[e^x \\tan(\\frac{x}{2})]_{3}^{4} = e^4 \\tan(2) - e^3 \\tan(1.5)$. (Note: angles are in radians).\n\n3.  **Sum the results:** The total integral is the sum of the results from Step 1 and Step 2.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The integral is split into two parts at x=3.\n# Part 1: Integral of p(x) = (2*x^3)/8 from x = 0 to 3\n# The antiderivative of x^3/4 is x^4/16.\n# Evaluating from 0 to 3: (3^4 / 16) - (0^4 / 16)\nintegral_part1 = 81.0 / 16.0\n\n# Part 2: Integral of p(x) = (e^x * (1 + sin(x))) / (1 + cos(x)) from x = 3 to 4\n# The antiderivative is e^x * tan(x/2).\n# We evaluate this from 3 to 4 (using radians for tan).\n# The result is (e^4 * tan(2)) - (e^3 * tan(1.5)).\nval_at_4 = math.exp(4) * math.tan(2)\nval_at_3 = math.exp(3) * math.tan(1.5)\nintegral_part2 = val_at_4 - val_at_3\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts.\ntotal_integral = integral_part1 + integral_part2\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final equation.\nprint(\"The total integral is the sum of two parts: I = I1 + I2\")\nprint(\"\\nPart 1: Integral from 0 to 3 of (x^3/4) dx\")\nprint(f\"I1 = [x^4/16] from 0 to 3 = (3^4)/16 - 0 = 81/16 = {integral_part1}\")\nprint(\"\\nPart 2: Integral from 3 to 4 of (e^x * (1 + sin(x))) / (1 + cos(x)) dx\")\nprint(f\"I2 = [e^x * tan(x/2)] from 3 to 4\")\nprint(f\"I2 = (e^4 * tan(2)) - (e^3 * tan(1.5))\")\nprint(f\"I2 = ({val_at_4}) - ({val_at_3})\")\nprint(f\"I2 = {integral_part2}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nTotal Integral = I1 + I2\")\nprint(f\"Total Integral = {integral_part1} + ({integral_part2}) = {total_integral}\")\n\n# Output the final numerical answer in the specified format\n# print(f\"<<<{total_integral}>>>\")\n```\n<<<-397.4629653383041>>>"
