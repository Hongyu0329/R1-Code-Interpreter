  This function prints the solution to the mathematical problem.
  The reasoning, explained above, leads to the conclusion that the minimum value is 0.
  The existence of a specific function f from combinatorial set theory allows us to
  construct a scenario where no function g can satisfy the required property,
  making the set of such functions g an empty set.
