    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory:** The question pertains to the supersymmetric sigma-model (SUSY σ-model) used to study disordered electronic systems. The specific model depends on the symmetry class.\n2.  **Determine the Manifold:** For symmetry class D, the target space of the SUSY σ-model is a supermanifold. The non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables parametrize the bosonic base of this supermanifold. For `n` replicas, this bosonic base space is the symmetric space `O(4n) / (O(2n) x O(2n))`.\n3.  **Calculate the Dimension:** The number of variables required to parametrize a manifold is simply its dimension. We need to calculate the dimension of `O(4n) / (O(2n) x O(2n))`.\n    *   The dimension of a symmetric space `G/H` is `dim(G) - dim(H)`.\n    *   The dimension of the orthogonal group `O(N)` is `N*(N-1)/2`.\n    *   So, `dim(O(4n)) = 4n*(4n-1)/2 = 8n^2 - 2n`.\n    *   The dimension of the subgroup `O(2n) x O(2n)` is `dim(O(2n)) + dim(O(2n)) = 2 * [2n*(2n-1)/2] = 2 * (2n^2 - n) = 4n^2 - 2n`.\n    *   The dimension of the space is `(8n^2 - 2n) - (4n^2 - 2n) = 4n^2`.\n    *   A simpler way to calculate the dimension of `O(p+q) / (O(p) x O(q))` is `p*q`. Here, `p=2n` and `q=2n`, so the dimension is `(2n)*(2n) = 4n^2`.\n4.  **Substitute the Value:** The user specified `n=2` replicas. We will substitute this value into the final formula `4n^2`.\n5.  **Generate Code:** A Python script will be created to perform this calculation and print the steps as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_class_d_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassmann variables for the SUSY sigma-model\n    of symmetry class D with a given number of replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas as specified in the problem\n    n = 2\n\n    # The number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables for symmetry class D\n    # is given by the dimension of the symmetric space O(4n)/(O(2n) x O(2n)).\n    # This dimension simplifies to the formula: 4 * n^2.\n\n    print(\"Problem: Find the number of non-Grassmann variables for the supersymmetric sigma-model.\")\n    print(\"Details:\")\n    print(f\"  - Symmetry Class: D\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of Replicas (n): {n}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"The formula for the number of variables is dim(O(4n)/(O(2n) x O(2n))) = 4 * n^2.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation steps:\")\n\n    # Perform the calculation\n    result = 4 * (n ** 2)\n\n    # Print the final equation with the numbers substituted, as requested.\n    print(f\"Number of variables = 4 * ({n}**2)\")\n    print(f\"                    = 4 * {n**2}\")\n    print(f\"                    = {result}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"The final answer is: {result}\")\n\nsolve_class_d_variables()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
