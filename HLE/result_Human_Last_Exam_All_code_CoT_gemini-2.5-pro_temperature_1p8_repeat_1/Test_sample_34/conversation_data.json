    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this poker theory question using a Python script for illustration.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Scenario:** The question is about identifying the weakest suited Jack (a hand like JXs, where X is another card of the same suit) that is still profitable to open-raise with from the button position in a 100 big blind, no-rake Texas Hold'em cash game.\n2.  **Poker Theory Application:** In poker, the button is the most powerful position, allowing a player to open the widest range of hands. A standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) range for this situation is very wide (around 45-50% of hands) and includes all suited Jacks.\n3.  **Rank the Hands:** The strength of a suited Jack hand (JXs) is primarily determined by its kicker (the 'X' card). A higher kicker is better as it leads to stronger pairs and better straight/flush draws. Therefore, we can rank the hands from best to worst: AJs, KJs, QJs, ..., J3s, J2s.\n4.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Hand:** Since a standard opening range includes all suited Jacks, the \"worst\" one you should still open is the one at the very bottom of this ranking.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that creates a list of all suited Jack hands, sorts them from best to worst based on kicker strength, and prints the weakest hand from that list, explaining the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_openable_suited_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button\n    in a standard 100BB rake-free cash game, based on GTO principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Card ranks from highest to lowest, excluding the Jack itself.\n    kicker_ranks = ['A', 'K', 'Q', 'T', '9', '8', '7', '6', '5', '4', '3', '2']\n\n    # All possible suited Jack hands, automatically sorted from best to worst by kicker.\n    suited_jacks = [f\"J{rank}s\" for rank in kicker_ranks]\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Suited Jack Opening Hands from the Button ---\")\n    print(\"\\nIn a 100BB cash game, the Button has a significant positional advantage.\")\n    print(\"This allows for a wide opening range, which in GTO strategy includes all suited Jacks.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere are the suited Jack hands, ranked from strongest to weakest based on kicker strength:\")\n    print(\"Strongest ->\", \" -> \".join(suited_jacks), \"-> Weakest\")\n\n    # The \"worst\" hand to open is the lowest-ranked hand that is still\n    # considered a standard, profitable open-raise.\n    worst_hand = suited_jacks[-1]\n\n    print(f\"\\nSince all hands in this list are profitable opens from the button, the 'worst' among them is the one with the lowest kicker.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the worst suited Jack you should open is: {worst_hand}\")\n\n\n# Run the function to display the analysis and the result.\nfind_worst_openable_suited_jack()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
