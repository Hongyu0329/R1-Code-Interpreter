# The problem asks for the property equivalent to a function f being continuous,
# expressed in the language of nonstandard analysis.

# The nonstandard characterization of continuity for a function f at a standard point x_0
# is that it maps the monad of x_0 to the monad of f(x_0).
# The monad of a standard point p is the set of all points (standard or nonstandard)
# that are infinitesimally close to p.

# A function is continuous over its entire domain X if it is continuous at every
# standard point x_0 in X.

# This leads to the following condition:
# For every standard point x_0 in X, and for every point x_1 in the nonstandard
# extension X* that is infinitesimally close to x_0, their images under f,
# f(x_0) and f(x_1), must be infinitesimally close to each other.

# This statement corresponds exactly to option B.

# The other options are incorrect:
# A is too weak (only standard points).
# C is too strong (S-continuity, not equivalent to standard continuity).
# D, E, F are converse statements not equivalent to continuity.
