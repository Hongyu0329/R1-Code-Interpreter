    "To answer this question, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  I will first identify the specific 1905 paper by Albert Einstein on Brownian motion.\n2.  I will then research the citations or references within that paper. Historical analysis shows that Einstein's 1905 papers, including the one on Brownian motion, were remarkable for their lack of citations to other contemporary scientific work.\n3.  However, the work is undeniably built upon the foundation of statistical mechanics. The question asks about *lectures*, and the physicist whose work and published \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" were the most direct intellectual underpinning for Einstein's statistical approach was Ludwig Boltzmann.\n4.  Therefore, I will create a Python script that stores this information and prints the answer clearly, acknowledging that while there was no formal citation in the paper, Boltzmann's work (including his published lectures) was the key intellectual foundation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# The user is asking whose lectures were foundational to Einstein's 1905 Brownian motion paper.\n# While Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion (\"Über die von der\n# molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden\n# Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\") famously contained no citations, his work\n# was deeply rooted in the principles of statistical mechanics.\n#\n# The primary figure whose work and published lectures on statistical mechanics\n# and gas theory were a direct influence on Einstein's thinking for this paper\n# was Ludwig Boltzmann. Einstein's paper is considered a major validation of\n# Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of thermodynamics.\n\nfoundational_figure = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\npaper_subject = \"Brownian motion\"\nyear = 1905\n\n# Output the answer in a full sentence.\nprint(f\"Albert Einstein's {year} paper on {paper_subject} did not formally cite any sources.\")\nprint(f\"However, the work was fundamentally based on the principles of statistical mechanics developed by {foundational_figure}, whose published lectures on gas theory were a major influence.\")\n\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
