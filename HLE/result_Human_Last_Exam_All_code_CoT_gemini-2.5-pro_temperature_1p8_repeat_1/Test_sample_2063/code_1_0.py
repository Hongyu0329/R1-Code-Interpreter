    """
    This function calculates the limiting probability P(n) as n -> infinity.
    
    The problem asks for the probability that for a random DNA sequence of length n
    with 8 bases, the count of each base 'x' (c_x) does not satisfy c_x mod 8 = x.

    1. For large n, the probability P(n) does not converge to a single value but
       oscillates depending on the value of n mod 8. This is because the sum of
       base counts must equal n, which creates a constraint on the counts mod 8.
       sum(c_x) mod 8 = n mod 8.

    2. The "limiting value" is interpreted as the Cesaro mean, or the average
       probability over one full cycle of oscillation (from n mod 8 = 0 to 7).

    3. This average value elegantly resolves to (7/8)^8. This result can be understood
       intuitively as the product of probabilities for each of the 8 independent conditions
       (c_x mod 8 != x) not being met. For large n, the probability of any single
       condition c_x mod 8 = x being met is 1/8, so the probability of it not being
       met is 7/8. For all 8 conditions to not be met, the probability is (7/8)^8.

    4. We will calculate this value by computing the numerator (7^8) and the
       denominator (8^8).
