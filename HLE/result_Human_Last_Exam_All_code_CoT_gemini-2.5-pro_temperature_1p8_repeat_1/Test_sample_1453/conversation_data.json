    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence, we need to analyze its potential to form a coiled-coil and identify the residues that would form the hydrophobic core. The stability and oligomeric state of a coiled-coil are primarily determined by the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of amino acid side chains at the core positions of the interacting alpha-helices.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat**: Coiled-coils have a characteristic seven-residue repeating pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic and pack together to form the core of the structure. The other positions (`b, c, e, f, g`) are generally polar or charged and are exposed to the solvent.\n\n2.  **Identify the Correct Heptad Register**: The provided sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. To find the correct arrangement of the `abcdefg` pattern (the \"register\" or \"frame\"), we need to find the alignment that places the most hydrophobic residues consistently at the `a` and `d` positions. We can test all seven possible starting frames and score them based on the hydrophobicity of the residues assigned to the core `a` and `d` positions. The frame with the highest hydrophobicity score is the most likely correct register.\n\n3.  **Analyze Core Residues for Oligomeric State**: Once we've identified the core residues, we can predict the oligomeric state. Different combinations of residues at the `a` and `d` positions favor different structures:\n    *   **Dimers (2 helices)**: Often have large, bulky hydrophobic residues like Leucine (L) or Isoleucine (I) at the `d` position.\n    *   **Trimers (3 helices)**: Pack more tightly. They are often stabilized by a combination of small residues (like Alanine, A) at one core position (`a` or `d`) and larger residues (like Leucine, L) at the other.\n    *   **Tetramers (4 helices)**: Often have a specific alternating pattern of hydrophobic and polar residues, or patterns like `a=I`, `d=L`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Analysis**: A Python script will perform this analysis systematically. It will find the optimal heptad register by maximizing the core hydrophobicity and then present the identified `a` and `d` residues. Based on this result, we will determine the most probable oligomeric state.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a protein sequence to predict its coiled-coil oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The amino acid sequence in question\n    sequence = \"GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG\"\n\n    # Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale.
