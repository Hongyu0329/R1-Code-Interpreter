    "The question describes the discovery of the phase-contrast principle by the Dutch physicist Frits Zernike. While observing diffraction gratings with a telescope, he noticed that secondary \"ghost\" images appeared, shifted in phase. He realized this effect could be used to make transparent details, like those in living cells, visible under a microscope without staining. The anecdote about a custodian cleaning a concave mirror and making tiny scratches visible is often associated with this discovery, illustrating the principle of making invisible phase objects visible. Zernike was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to output the name of the physicist.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the physicist based on the provided clues.\n    Clues:\n    1.
