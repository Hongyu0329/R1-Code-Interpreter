# The patient's lipid panel results
total_cholesterol = 160  # mg/dL
hdl = 37                 # mg/dL
triglycerides = 140      # mg/dL

# The Friedewald equation is used to estimate LDL cholesterol:
# LDL = Total Cholesterol - HDL - (Triglycerides / 5)
# This formula is valid when Triglycerides are < 400 mg/dL.

# Calculate the estimated LDL cholesterol
vldl = triglycerides / 5
calculated_ldl = total_cholesterol - hdl - vldl

# The lab-reported LDL was 95 mg/dL. Our calculation should match this.

# Based on the clinical reasoning, the most appropriate next step is a physiatry consult.
# If the options were:
# A. Increase the dose of metoprolol.
# B. Obtain a venous Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities.
# C. Start a nutritional supplement.
# D. Consult a physiatrist for rehabilitation evaluation.
# E. Check a creatine kinase (CK) level.
# The correct answer would be D.
