    # The problem asks for the largest possible value of K in the inequality
    # mu(X^3) >= K * mu(X) for any compact subset X of SL_2(R).

    # Based on mathematical derivation:
    # 1. Using the compact subgroup X = SO(2), we find that K must be less than or equal to 1.
    #    For X = SO(2), X^3 = X, so mu(X) >= K * mu(X), which implies K <= 1.
    # 2. Using the invariance properties of the Haar measure, we can show K must be at least 1.
    #    For any non-empty compact X and any x in X, xX is a subset of X^2.
    #    Since the Haar measure is left-invariant, mu(X^2) >= mu(xX) = mu(X).
    #    Similarly, for any z in X, X^2 * z is a subset of X^3.
    #    Since the Haar measure on SL_2(R) is right-invariant, mu(X^3) >= mu(X^2 * z) = mu(X^2).
    #    Combining these, we get mu(X^3) >= mu(X^2) >= mu(X), which means mu(X^3) >= 1 * mu(X).
    #    Therefore, K must be at least 1.

    # From K <= 1 and K >= 1, we conclude K = 1.
    K = 1
