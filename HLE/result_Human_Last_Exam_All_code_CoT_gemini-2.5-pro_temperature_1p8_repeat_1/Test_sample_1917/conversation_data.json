    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of unique values in the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Modulo:** The modulus is $m=22$. We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem by considering the problem modulo its prime factors, 2 and 11.\n    *   A value $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of residues $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$.\n\n2.  **Periodicity of the sequence:** We are looking at the sequence $x_a = a^a \\pmod{22}$. Let's analyze its components:\n    *   **Modulo 2:** $a^a \\pmod 2$ depends only on whether $a$ is even or odd. This sequence depends on $a \\pmod 2$.\n    *   **Modulo 11:** For $a$ not divisible by 11, Euler's totient theorem states $k^{\\phi(11)} \\equiv k^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This means that the value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on the base $a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$. If $a$ is a multiple of 11, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. In all cases, the value depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\pmod{10}$.\n\n3.  **Combine the dependencies:** For the sequence $a^a \\pmod{22}$, the value for each $a$ depends on $a \\pmod 2$, $a \\pmod{10}$, and $a \\pmod{11}$. The overall sequence of residues must therefore be periodic. The period is the least common multiple of these moduli: $\\text{lcm}(2, 10, 11) = 110$.\n\n4.  **Computation:** Since the sequence of residues is periodic with period 110, the set of all possible residues is the same as the set of residues for $a$ from 1 to 110. We can write a simple program to compute these values and find the size of the resulting set.\n\n5.  **Python Script:** The following Python script will perform the calculation:\n    *   It iterates $a$ from 1 to 110.\n    *   For each $a$, it computes $a^a \\pmod{22}$ using the efficient `pow(base, exp, mod)` function.\n    *   It stores each unique result in a set.\n    *   Finally, it prints the sorted set of residues and its cardinality.\n\n```python\ndef find_residue_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22 for a in N}.\n\n    The sequence a^a mod 22 is periodic. The period is determined by the\n    dependencies of the calculation on a mod 2, a mod 11, and a mod 10 (from\n    Euler's totient theorem for modulus 11). The least common multiple\n    lcm(2, 10, 11) is 110. Therefore, we only need to check the first 110\n    values of a to find all possible residues.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Using a set to automatically store unique residues\n    residues = set()\n    \n    # The period is 110, so we iterate from a = 1 to 110\n    period = 110\n    for a in range(1, period + 1):\n        # Calculate a^a mod 22\n        # pow(a, a, 22) is efficient for modular exponentiation\n        residue = pow(a, a, 22)\n        residues.add(residue)\n        \n    # Sort the set for a clean presentation\n    sorted_residues = sorted(list(residues))\n    \n    print(\"Let A = {a^a : a in N}. The set {a mod 22: a in A} is found by computing a^a mod 22 for a from 1 to 110.\")\n    print(f\"The set of unique residues is: {sorted_residues}\")\n    print(f\"The cardinality of this set is: {len(sorted_residues)}\")\n\nfind_residue_cardinality()\n```\n<<<14>>>"
