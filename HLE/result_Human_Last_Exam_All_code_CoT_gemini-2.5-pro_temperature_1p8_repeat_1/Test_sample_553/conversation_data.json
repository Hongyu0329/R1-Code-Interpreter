    "This is a music theory question. The song you are looking for is \"Michelle\" from the album *Rubber Soul*. I will write a Python script that explains why this song fits your description.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the key of the song \"Michelle\". The song is primarily in F major.\n2.  Identify the tonic chord in the key of F major. The tonic (I) chord is F major.\n3.  Identify the fifth degree of the F major scale. The fifth degree is C.\n4.  Identify the \"minor fifth chord\", which means a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale. This is a C minor (v) chord.\n5.  Confirm that the song's opening vocal melody (\"Mi-chelle...\") moves from the tonic chord (F major) to the minor fifth chord (C minor). This is a well-known characteristic of the song.\n6.  The Python script will then print out this information, including the song's title and the harmonic progression that answers your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the Beatles song\n    that begins with a distinctive harmonic jump from the\n    tonic chord to a minor chord on the fifth degree.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key = \"F Major\"\n    \n    # In music theory, chords are numbered with Roman numerals.\n    # 'I' represents the tonic chord.\n    # 'v' represents a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale.\n    tonic_chord_name = \"F Major\"\n    tonic_chord_numeral = \"I\"\n    \n    minor_fifth_chord_name = \"C minor\"\n    minor_fifth_chord_numeral = \"v\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that fits the description is: '{song_title}'\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the musical explanation:\")\n    print(f\"The song is in the key of {key}.\")\n    print(f\"The opening vocal harmony starts on the tonic chord, which is '{tonic_chord_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"It then immediately moves to a '{minor_fifth_chord_name}' chord, which is a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe harmonic 'equation' for this opening is:\")\n    print(f\"Chord 1 (Tonic): {tonic_chord_numeral} = {tonic_chord_name}\")\n    print(f\"Chord 2 (Minor Fifth): {minor_fifth_chord_numeral} = {minor_fifth_chord_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
