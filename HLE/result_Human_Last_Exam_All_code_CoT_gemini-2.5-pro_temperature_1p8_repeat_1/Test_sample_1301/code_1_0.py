    This function returns the SMILES string for a molecule that satisfies all the given constraints.

    The constraints are:
    - Molecular Weight: ~258.11 g/mol
    - Heavy Atom Count: 18
    - Valence Electron Count: 102
    - Formal Charge: 0, No radicals
    - Heteroatoms: 6 (1 carbonyl oxygen, 5 ether oxygens)
    - Hydrogen Bond Acceptors: 6
    - Hydrogen Bond Donors: 0
    - No F, Cl, Br, I
    - Rings: 3 total, all are saturated heterocycles
    - No aliphatic or aromatic carbocycles
    - Rotatable Bonds: 0
    - Aromatic Rings: 0
    - Bicyclic arrangement present
    - Carbonyls >= 1
    - No forbidden functional groups (esters, amides, nitriles, etc.)

    Based on these constraints, the molecular formula is deduced to be C12H18O6.
    The structure that fits all constraints is a rigid, tricyclic, bridged ether-ketone.
    The structure is based on a bicyclo[5.5.5]heptadecane skeleton where some carbons are
    replaced by oxygens and one CH2 group is replaced by a C=O group.

    The SMILES string represents this complex cage-like molecule.
