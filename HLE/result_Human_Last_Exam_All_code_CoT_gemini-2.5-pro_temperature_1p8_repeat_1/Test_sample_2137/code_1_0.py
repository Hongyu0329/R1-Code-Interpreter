    This script solves the riddle by identifying the project connecting the clues.

    Step 1: The songs 'Venus in Furs,' 'Sister Ray,' and 'Lady Godiva's Operation'
             point to The Velvet Underground, and its key figures Lou Reed, John Cale,
             and their mentor Andy Warhol.

    Step 2: The riddle asks for a project with similar themes. 'Songs for Drella' is a
             collaborative tribute album to Andy Warhol by Lou Reed and John Cale.
             'Drella' was Warhol's nickname. This is a strong candidate.

    Step 3: We analyze the clue: "A singer widely recognized for the book about the
             principal songwriter's solo career is a major contributor to the music
             of this project."
             - The 'principal songwriter' is Lou Reed.
             - The project is 'Songs for Drella'.
             - A 'major contributor' is Lou Reed himself.
             - Lou Reed is a 'singer'.
             - Lou Reed published a well-known book of his lyrics called 'Pass Thru Fire',
               which is a "book about his ... solo career".

    Step 4: All clues point to 'Songs for Drella'.
    """
    project_name = "Songs for Drella"
    answer_choice = "F"

    # The prompt asked to "output each number in the final equation", which seems
