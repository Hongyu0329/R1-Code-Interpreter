    # b) The angle condition is that the angle theta between the tangent plane and the
    # cylinder's direction (z-axis) is > 1/10.
    # This means sin(theta) > sin(1/10). sin(theta) is given by |n . v| / ||n||,
    # where n is the normal vector (gradient of P) and v is the z-axis vector.
    # The area element of the surface dS relates to the projected area element dxdy by
    # dS = (||n|| / |n . v|) dxdy.

    # c) For any point (x, y) in the projection, the number of points on the surface
    # P(x, y, z) = 0 is the number of real roots of a polynomial in z of degree at most D.
    # Therefore, there are at most D "sheets" of the surface.
    max_num_sheets = D
