    "To answer your question, I will identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the Armistice of 22 June 1940.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will compile a list of French ships that were sunk by German U-boats during the specified period (September 1939 - June 22, 1940).\n2.  For each ship, I will determine its displacement in tons. It's important to note that for merchant vessels, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a measure of volume, is more commonly cited than displacement (a measure of weight). I will use the best available displacement figures, which are sometimes calculated from GRT and Deadweight Tonnage (DWT).\n3.  I will write a Python script to store this data. The script will then process the data to find the ship with the maximum displacement.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the name of the ship, its displacement, and a comparison with other large ships from the list to show the result clearly.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat\n    before the Armistice of 22 June 1940.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data is compiled from historical naval records (e.g., uboat.net, wrecksite.eu).\n    # 'displacement_tons' is the ship's weight, the primary criterion.
