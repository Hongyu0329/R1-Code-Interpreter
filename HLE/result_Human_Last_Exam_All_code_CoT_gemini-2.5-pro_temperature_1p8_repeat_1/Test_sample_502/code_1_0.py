    This function calculates the largest possible dimension for the quotient ring R/I.

    The dimension of the quotient ring R/I is equal to the order of the group H that effectively acts on the polynomial ring R.
    The group G, of order 10000, acts on C^10 via a homomorphism rho: G -> GL_10(C). The effective group is H = rho(G).
    The order of H, |H|, must divide the order of G. Thus, |H| <= |G| = 10000.
    To maximize the dimension of R/I, we must maximize |H|.
    The maximum value of |H| is 10000, which is achieved if the representation rho is faithful (injective).

    We demonstrate this is possible with a specific example:
    - Let G be the cyclic group of order 10000.
    - Let the representation rho be defined for a generator g of G by rho(g) = diag(exp(2*pi*i/10000), 1, ..., 1).
    - This is a faithful representation, and the acting group H = rho(G) is a cyclic group of order 10000 generated by a pseudo-reflection.

    For such a group, the ring of invariants R^H is a polynomial algebra generated by n=10 polynomials.
    The order of H is the product of the degrees of these fundamental invariants.
    The fundamental invariants for this action are x_1^10000, x_2, ..., x_10.
    Their degrees are 10000, 1, 1, ..., 1. The product of these degrees gives the dimension.
