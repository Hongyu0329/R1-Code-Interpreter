# The analysis of the algorithm shows that for all three graph classes,
# the number of steps required is Theta(log n).

# 1. Cycle: A 2-regular graph. This is a bounded-degree graph.
#    The upper bound is O(log n). A path/cycle is a worst-case
#    example, requiring Omega(log n) steps.
#    f_1(n) = Theta(log n) -> Omega(log n) -> Category 9

# 2. Tree with max degree <= 100: A bounded-degree graph.
#    The upper bound is O(log n). This class includes the path graph,
#    which gives a lower bound of Omega(log n).
#    f_2(n) = Theta(log n) -> Omega(log n) -> Category 9

# 3. Graph with max degree <= 100: A bounded-degree graph.
#    The upper bound is O(log n). This class includes path/cycle graphs,
#    giving a lower bound of Omega(log n).
#    f_3(n) = Theta(log n) -> Omega(log n) -> Category 9
