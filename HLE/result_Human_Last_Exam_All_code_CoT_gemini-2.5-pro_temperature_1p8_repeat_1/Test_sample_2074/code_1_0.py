# Based on the mathematical derivation, the function l(b) is constant for all b in (-1, 1).
# My step-by-step analysis shows that the value of l(b) is 101.

# Assign the values derived for l(1/2) and l(-1/2)
l_half = 101
l_neg_half = 101

# The constant factor in the expression
factor = 6

# Calculate the final result
result = factor * (l_half + l_neg_half)

# As requested, output the components of the final equation and the result
