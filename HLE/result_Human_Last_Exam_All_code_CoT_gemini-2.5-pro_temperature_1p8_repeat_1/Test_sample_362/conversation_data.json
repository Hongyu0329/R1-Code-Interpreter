    "The Wittig reaction is a powerful method in organic synthesis for creating carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes). It involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or a ketone) with a phosphorus ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent).\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the product and fulfill the request:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:**\n    *   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO. The key feature is the tert-butyl group attached to the aldehyde functional group.\n    *   **Phosphorus Ylide:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane. This is the Wittig reagent. Its structure can be represented as (C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:** In the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group and the triphenylphosphine group of the ylide are exchanged. A new double bond is formed between the carbonyl carbon and the ylide carbon.\n\n    *   `R¹R²C=O` + `(Ph)₃P=CR³R⁴` → `R¹R²C=CR³R⁴` + `(Ph)₃P=O`\n\n3.  **Determine Products:**\n    *   Applying this to our specific reactants:\n        *   The `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part comes from pivalaldehyde.\n        *   The `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)` part comes from the ylide.\n    *   Combining these gives the alkene product: **(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)**.\n    *   The IUPAC name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n    *   The other product is **triphenylphosphine oxide**, (C₆H₅)₃P=O.\n\n4.  **Create Code:** The request asks for a script to output the numbers from the final balanced chemical equation. The following Python script will use the RDKit library to determine the molecular formulas of the reactants and products and then extract all numerical values from the balanced equation.\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors import CalcMolFormula\n\ndef get_molecular_formula(smiles_string):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the molecular formula from a SMILES string.\"\"\"\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_string)\n    if mol is not None:\n        return CalcMolFormula(mol)\n    return \"\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the products of the specified Wittig reaction,\n    constructs the balanced chemical equation, and extracts all numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Names and SMILES representations of the relevant species\n    # Reactants\n    pivalaldehyde_name = \"Pivalaldehyde\"\n    pivalaldehyde_smiles = \"CC(C)(C)C=O\"\n    \n    # The SMILES for the ylide is complex and not well-supported,\n    # so we'll determine its formula from its constituent parts.\n    # Ylide = (Triphenylphosphine) + (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl) - H2\n    # C18H15P + C8H8Cl -> Wittig Salt (C26H23ClP), then deprotonation -> Ylide (C26H22ClP)\n    ylide_name = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n    ylide_formula = \"C26H22ClP\"\n\n    # Products\n    product_name = \"1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\"\n    product_smiles = \"CC(C)(C)C=CCc1c(Cl)cccc1\" # This is the main organic product\n\n    byproduct_name = \"Triphenylphosphine oxide\"\n    byproduct_smiles = \"O=P(c1ccccc1)(c2ccccc2)(c3ccccc3)\"\n    \n    # Calculate molecular formulas using RDKit\n    pivalaldehyde_formula = get_molecular_formula(pivalaldehyde_smiles)\n    product_formula = get_molecular_formula(product_smiles)\n    byproduct_formula = get_molecular_formula(byproduct_smiles)\n\n    # Assemble the final chemical equation\n    print(\"The Wittig reaction product is 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\")\n    \n    # Print equation with names\n    print(f\"{pivalaldehyde_name} + {ylide_name} -> {product_name} + {byproduct_name}\\n\")\n    \n    # Print equation with molecular formulas\n    equation_str = (\n        f\"{pivalaldehyde_formula} + {ylide_formula} -> \"\n        f\"{product_formula} + {byproduct_formula}\"\n    )\n    print(\"In terms of molecular formulas:\")\n    print(equation_str)\n\n    # Extract all numbers from the molecular formula equation string\n    numbers = re.findall(r'\\d+', equation_str)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe numbers from the final molecular formula equation are:\")\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        from rdkit import Chem\n        main()\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"This script requires the RDKit library.\")\n        print(\"Please install it using: pip install rdkit\")\n\n```\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
