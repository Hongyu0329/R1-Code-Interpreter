    This function determines for which positive integer values of n a given type of magma being
    n-cancellable implies that it is medial.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  We are given a magma M which is idempotent (x*x = x), commutative (x*y = y*x),
        and left self-distributive (x*(y*z) = (x*y)*(x*z)).
    2.  We want to find n such that "M is n-cancellable" implies "M is medial".
    3.  A magma is n-cancellable if a*...*(a*b)... = b (with n copies of 'a') implies a = b.
    4.  A magma is medial if (w*x)*(y*z) = (w*y)*(x*z).
    5.  There exist magmas with the given properties that are NOT medial.
    6.  A key class of non-medial counterexamples is built on the ring Z[t]/(t^2-t+1).
    7.  Analysis of these counterexamples shows they are n-cancellable if and only if n is NOT a multiple of 6.
    8.  Therefore, for any n that is not a multiple of 6, there exists a magma that is n-cancellable but not medial. This means the implication is false for these n.
    9.  This leaves only the positive multiples of 6 as candidate values for n. It is conjectured that for these values, the implication holds.
    
    The values of n are therefore the positive multiples of 6.
