    Analyzes a likely hydrolysis reaction and identifies the product with the higher molar mass.

    The provided SMILES string in the problem description, CC12COC(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1,
    is not valid according to the RDKit library and likely represents a complex orthoester/acetal.
    Such compounds hydrolyze in acid.

    We deduce the plausible products of this hydrolysis based on the structural fragments
    indicated in the SMILES string (a phenyl group and a methyl group).

    Plausible products are:
    1. Benzoic Acid (from the phenyl-C(O)x part)
    2. Hydroxyacetone (from the methyl-C(O)x part and other atoms)

    This script calculates their molar masses and identifies the heavier one.
