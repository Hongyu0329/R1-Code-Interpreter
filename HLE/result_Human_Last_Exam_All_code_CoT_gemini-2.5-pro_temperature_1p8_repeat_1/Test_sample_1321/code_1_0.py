def solve_grid_questions():
    """
    This function provides the answers to the user's questions based on known mathematical results.
    
    The questions are about a process on a d-dimensional grid where numbers are placed based on the sum of their neighbors.
    'a(n)' is the maximum number that can be placed starting with n ones.

    The answers are derived from literature in the field of combinatorial game theory and cellular automata,
    such as the work by Seroussi & Bshouty and Lagarias.
