    "Of course, I can help with that. This question belongs to the field of mathematics known as fixed-point theory, specifically for coupled systems of equations. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the conditions and a Python script to verify them.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Problem**: First, we need to correctly state the problem. An \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" is a triplet `(x, y, z)` from sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` that simultaneously solves a system of three equations. Based on the function signatures you provided, the system is:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    *   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n    *(Note: The prompt defined `G` twice. I am assuming the third function `Z*Y*X -> Z` is named `H`, which is standard for such problems.)*\n\n2.  **Use the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**: The most common way to find conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point is to use the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem (also called the Contraction Mapping Principle). This theorem states that a contraction mapping on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point.\n\n3.  **Formulate as a Single Fixed-Point Problem**: We can combine the three functions `F`, `G`, and `H` into a single operator `T` that acts on the product space `M = X × Y × Z`.\n    *   Define `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`.\n    *   A fixed point of `T` is a point `(x, y, z)` where `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`, which is exactly the FGH-tripled fixed point we are looking for.\n\n4.  **Establish the Conditions**: For the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to apply, two main conditions must be met:\n    *   **Condition on Spaces**: The space `M` must be a complete metric space. This is true if `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are themselves complete metric spaces (e.g., the set of real numbers `R`, or any closed subset of `R^n`).\n    *   **Condition on Functions (Contraction)**: The operator `T` must be a contraction. This means it must \"shrink\" the distance between any two points by a factor `k < 1`. This property of `T` depends on the properties of `F`, `G`, and `H`. If `F`, `G`, and `H` are Lipschitz continuous, we can derive simple conditions on their Lipschitz constants.\n\n5.  **Derive the Final Inequalities**: We assume `F`, `G`, and `H` satisfy the following contractive (Lipschitz) conditions with non-negative constants:\n    *   `distance_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ k_Fx*d(x₁,x₂) + k_Fy*d(y₁,y₂) + k_Fz*d(z₁,z₂)`\n    *   `distance_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y'₁), G(y₂, x₂, y'₂)) ≤ k_Gy*d(y₁,y₂) + k_Gx*d(x₁,x₂) + k_Gy_alt*d(y'₁,y'₂)`\n    *   `distance_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k_Hz*d(z₁,z₂) + k_Hy*d(y₁,y₂) + k_Hx*d(x₁,x₂)`\n\n    For the operator `T` to be a contraction, a sufficient condition is that the sum of the constants corresponding to each variable is less than 1:\n    1.  **For x-dimension**: `k_Fx + k_Gx + k_Hx < 1`\n    2.  **For y-dimension**: `k_Fy + k_Gy + k_Gy_alt + k_Hy < 1`\n    3.  **For z-dimension**: `k_Fz + k_Hz < 1`\n\nBelow is a Python script that takes these Lipschitz constants as input and checks if these three conditions are met, thereby guaranteeing the existence of a unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n```python\ndef check_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions(k_Fx, k_Fy, k_Fz, k_Gx, k_Gy, k_Gy_alt, k_Hx, k_Hy, k_Hz):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n    The FGH-tripled fixed point is a solution (x, y, z) to the system:\n        F(x, y, z) = x\n        G(y, x, y) = y\n        H(z, y, x) = z\n    \n    This function checks if the Lipschitz constants of F, G, and H satisfy the\n    sufficient conditions derived from the Banach Contraction Mapping Principle.\n\n    Args:\n        k_Fx, k_Fy, k_Fz: Lipschitz constants for F w.r.t. x, y, z.\n        k_Gx, k_Gy, k_Gy_alt: Lipschitz constants for G w.r.t. its 1st, 2nd, and 3rd arguments.\n        k_Hx, k_Hy, k_Hz: Lipschitz constants for H w.r.t. x, y, z arguments.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Checking Conditions for a Unique FGH-Tripled Fixed Point ---\\n\")\n\n    # Condition 1 (sum of coeffs for x-dimension)\n    sum_x = k_Fx + k_Gx + k_Hx\n    cond1_met = sum_x < 1\n    print(\"Condition 1 (for x-dimension): k_Fx + k_Gx + k_Hx < 1\")\n    print(f\"  Calculation: {k_Fx} + {k_Gx} + {k_Hx} = {sum_x}\")\n    print(f\"  Result: {sum_x} < 1 is {cond1_met}\\n\")\n\n    # Condition 2 (sum of coeffs for y-dimension)\n    sum_y = k_Fy + k_Gy + k_Gy_alt + k_Hy\n    cond2_met = sum_y < 1\n    print(\"Condition 2 (for y-dimension): k_Fy + k_Gy + k_Gy_alt + k_Hy < 1\")\n    print(f\"  Calculation: {k_Fy} + {k_Gy} + {k_Gy_alt} + {k_Hy} = {sum_y}\")\n    print(f\"  Result: {sum_y} < 1 is {cond2_met}\\n\")\n\n    # Condition 3 (sum of coeffs for z-dimension)\n    sum_z = k_Fz + k_Hz\n    cond3_met = sum_z < 1\n    print(\"Condition 3 (for z-dimension): k_Fz + k_Hz < 1\")\n    print(f\"  Calculation: {k_Fz} + {k_Hz} = {sum_z}\")\n    print(f\"  Result: {sum_z} < 1 is {cond3_met}\\n\")\n\n    # Final Conclusion\n    print(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\n    if cond1_met and cond2_met and cond3_met:\n        print(\"All conditions are met.
