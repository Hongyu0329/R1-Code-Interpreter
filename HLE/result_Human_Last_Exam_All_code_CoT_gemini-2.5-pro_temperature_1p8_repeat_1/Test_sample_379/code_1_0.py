# Step 1: Define the constants from the geometric analysis.
# The side length 'r' of the cube is a variable, but it will cancel out in the final ratio.
# We found that the locus C is composed of 6 arcs on the unfolded surface of the cube.

num_arcs = 6

# Step 2: Calculate the angle subtended by a single arc.
# From the analysis, each arc corresponds to an angle of pi/3 radians.
# This is derived from finding the segment of a circle of radius 'r' on an adjacent face,
# which spans from an angle of 0 to acos((r/2)/r) = acos(0.5) = pi/3.
angle_per_arc_rad = math.pi / 3

# Step 3: Calculate the total angle for the entire locus C.
total_angle_rad = num_arcs * angle_per_arc_rad

# Step 4: Calculate the total length of the locus C.
# The locus is on a circle of radius 'r'. Length = radius * total_angle.
# So, Length_C = r * total_angle_rad.
# Let's express this in terms of r and pi.
# total_angle_rad = 6 * (pi/3) = 2*pi.
# So Length_C = r * 2 * pi.

# Step 5: The problem asks to calculate the ratio: (Length of C) / (2 * pi * r).
# Ratio = (r * 2 * pi) / (2 * pi * r)
ratio = (2 * math.pi) / (2 * math.pi) # The 'r's cancel out

# Step 6: Convert the ratio to a whole number percentage.
percentage = int(ratio * 100)

# Step 7: Output the explanation and the final result.
