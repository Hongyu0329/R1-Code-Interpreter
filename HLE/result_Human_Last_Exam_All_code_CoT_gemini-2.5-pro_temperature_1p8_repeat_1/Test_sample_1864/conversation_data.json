    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure data accuracy, proper instrument setup, and correct gating for sorting. The essential controls include an unstained control, single-stain compensation controls, and Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for determining the total number of controls:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** One sample with just the streptavidin beads is needed to measure baseline autofluorescence. This sets the negative baseline for all channels.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** One control is required for each of the five fluorophores (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750). These are used to calculate the compensation matrix to correct for spectral overlap between the channels.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** For precise gating, especially in a sorting experiment, an FMO control is prepared for each fluorophore. An FMO control contains all the fluorophores used in the experiment *except* for one. This helps to accurately define the boundary between the negative and positive populations by revealing the spread caused by all other fluorophores.\n\nThe following Python script calculates and explains the total number of essential controls required.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a flow cytometry\n    sorting experiment based on the number of fluorophores.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The five detection channels correspond to five fluorophores.\n    num_fluorophores = 5\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # 1. Unstained control: Essential for setting baseline fluorescence.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-stain controls: Essential for compensation.\n    # One is needed for each fluorophore used.\n    single_stain_controls = num_fluorophores\n\n    # 3.
