    print("\nStep 1: Analyze the problem statement.")
    print("The problem is about a compact connected metric space X.")
    print("The key property is that for some integer n >= 2, the configuration space F_n(X) of n distinct points is disconnected.")
    print("We need to find how many distinct homeomorphism classes of such spaces X exist.")

    print("\nStep 2: Simplify the condition on F_n(X).")
    print("In topology, it's a known result that for a compact connected metric space X, the disconnection of the configuration space F_n(X) for any n >= 2 is equivalent to the disconnection of F_2(X).")
    print("So, the condition simplifies to: 'The space F_2(X) = {(x_1, x_2) in X^2 | x_1 != x_2} is disconnected.'")

    print("\nStep 3: Apply the central theorem.")

    print("A space that is homeomorphic to [0, 1] is called an 'arc'.")
    print("Intuitively, an arc allows for a total ordering of its points. This order separates F_2(X) into two sets, {(x, y) | x < y} and {(x, y) | y < x}, which form the two connected components. For other spaces, like a circle, there is no such global ordering, and one can always 'go around' to get from any configuration to another, making F_2(X) connected.")

    print("\nStep 4: Determine the number of homeomorphism classes.")
    print("The theorem tells us that the spaces X satisfying the given condition are precisely those that are homeomorphic to the interval [0, 1].")
    print("The question asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for these spaces.")
    print("A homeomorphism class is a set of all spaces that are mutually homeomorphic.")
    print("Let's say X_1 and X_2 are two spaces that both satisfy the condition.")
    print("Then, X_1 is homeomorphic to [0, 1], and X_2 is homeomorphic to [0, 1].")
    print("Since homeomorphism is an equivalence relation, it is transitive. Therefore, X_1 is homeomorphic to X_2.")
    print("This implies that all spaces satisfying the condition belong to the very same homeomorphism class.")

    print("\nStep 5: Final conclusion.")
    number_of_classes = 1
