    1.  Let's partition the index set N = {1, 2, 3, ...} into two infinite, disjoint subsets.
        Let E = {2, 4, 6, ...} be the set of even indices.
        Let O = {1, 3, 5, ...} be the set of odd indices.

    2.  This splits our set of ultrafilters U into two infinite subsets:
        U_E = {u_i | i is in E}
        U_O = {u_i | i is in O}

    3.  Let's define two corresponding large subsets of N:
        A_E = The union of all P_i for i in E.
        A_O = The union of all P_i for i in O.
        Since {P_i} is a partition of N, A_E and A_O are disjoint and their union is N.

    4.  In the topology of the Stone-Cech remainder N*, the sets A_E* = {v in N* | A_E is in v}
        and A_O* = {v in N* | A_O is in v} are disjoint open sets whose union is N*.

    5.  Any accumulation point of U_E must be in A_E*. Similarly, any accumulation point of U_O must be in A_O*.
        Therefore, the set of accumulation points of U, denoted L(U), is the disjoint union of the
        accumulation points of U_E and U_O.
        L(U) = L(U_E) U L(U_O).

    6.  Since U_E is an infinite subset of the compact space N*, it must have at least one accumulation point.
        So, the size of L(U_E) is >= 1.

    7.  Likewise, U_O is an infinite subset of N*, so the size of L(U_O) is >= 1.

    8.  Since L(U_E) and L(U_O) are disjoint, the total number of accumulation points is:
        |L(U)| = |L(U_E)| + |L(U_O)| >= 1 + 1 = 2.

    1.  The argument above shows the minimum is at least 2. To show that 2 is the minimum, we must demonstrate
        that a construction is possible where there are exactly 2 accumulation points.

    2.  This requires constructing the sets {P_i} and ultrafilters {u_i} such that |L(U_E)| = 1 and |L(U_O)| = 1.

    3.  It is a known result in set theory and topology that it's possible to construct a countable, discrete
        subset of N* that has exactly one accumulation point.

    4.  By choosing the ultrafilters in U_E appropriately, we can ensure they have a single accumulation point, call it v_E.
        Similarly, we can construct the ultrafilters in U_O to have a single accumulation point, v_O.

    5.  As shown in Step 1, v_E is in A_E* and v_O is in A_O*, which are disjoint. Thus, v_E and v_O are distinct.

    6.  In this construction, the total set of accumulation points L(U) would be {v_E, v_O}, which has exactly 2 points.
