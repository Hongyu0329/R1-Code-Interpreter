# Step 1: Define the relationship between critical covariance and variance.
# From the derivation, for a stable non-trivial weight configuration,
# the covariance 'C' between corresponding inputs must equal their variance 'V'.
# C = V

# Step 2: Define the correlation coefficient formula.
# rho = C / sqrt(Var(v) * Var(s))

# Step 3: Substitute the condition from Step 1 into the formula from Step 2.
# We are given that the input statistics are the same, so Var(v) = Var(s) = V.
# Let's represent the Variance V with a placeholder value. Since it will cancel
# out, any positive value will work.
V = 1.0

# From the critical condition, C must be equal to V.
C = V

# Now, we calculate the correlation coefficient rho.
rho = C / (V**0.5 * V**0.5)

# The final equation is `rho = 1`.
# We now print the number from this final equation as requested.
