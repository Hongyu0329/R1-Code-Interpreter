    "To solve this problem, we first need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, for the given differential equation.\n\n**1. Find the equilibrium points**\n\nEquilibrium points occur where the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\nSo we need to solve the equation:\n$$ -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe term in the parentheses is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x - 1)^{2} = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation, which are the equilibrium points, are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n**2. Determine the stability of the equilibrium points**\n\nLet $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$. An equilibrium point $x_0$ is stable if trajectories of $x(t)$ starting near $x_0$ move towards $x_0$. We can test this by checking the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of each equilibrium point.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$**:\n    *   If $x$ is slightly less than 0 (e.g., $x = -0.1$), $f(x) = -(-0.1)(-0.1 - 1)^2 = (+0.1)(-1.1)^2 > 0$. This means $x'(t) > 0$, so $x(t)$ increases towards 0.\n    *   If $x$ is slightly greater than 0 (e.g., $x = 0.1$), $f(x) = -(0.1)(0.1 - 1)^2 = -(0.1)(-0.9)^2 < 0$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so $x(t)$ decreases towards 0.\n    Since trajectories from both sides move towards $x=0$, it is a **stable** equilibrium point.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$**:\n    *   If $x$ is slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$), $f(x) = -(0.9)(0.9 - 1)^2 = -(0.9)(-0.1)^2 < 0$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from 1.\n    *   If $x$ is slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$), $f(x) = -(1.1)(1.1 - 1)^2 = -(1.1)(0.1)^2 < 0$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards 1.\n    Since trajectories move towards $x=1$ from one side but away from it on the other, it is a **semi-stable** equilibrium point, not a stable one.\n\n**3. Calculate m**\n\nBased on the analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. Therefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m = 1$.\n\n**4. Compute the final expression**\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$, we need to calculate:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\nThe following Python code will compute this value.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the number of stable equilibrium points, m.\n# From the analysis, we found m = 1.\nm = 1\n\n# Step 2: Define the other terms in the equation.\nbase = 2\nexponent = 4048\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the value of 2^4048.\n# Python can handle very large integers automatically.\nsecond_term = base ** exponent\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final result of m - 2^4048.\nresult = m - second_term\n\n# Step 5: Print the final equation with all numbers and the result.\n# We display the value of m, the base, the exponent, and the final result.\nprint(f\"The number of stable equilibrium points is m = {m}\")\nprint(f\"We are calculating: {m} - {base}^{exponent}\")\nprint(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n\n# The final answer in the required format\n# Note: The result is a very large negative number.\nfinal_answer_str = str(result)\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer_str}>>>\")\n```"
