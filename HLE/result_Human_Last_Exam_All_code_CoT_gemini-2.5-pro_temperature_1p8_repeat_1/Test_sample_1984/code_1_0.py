# Step 1: Define the number of stable equilibrium points, m.
# From the analysis, we found m = 1.
m = 1

# Step 2: Define the other terms in the equation.
base = 2
exponent = 4048

# Step 3: Calculate the value of 2^4048.
# Python can handle very large integers automatically.
second_term = base ** exponent

# Step 4: Calculate the final result of m - 2^4048.
result = m - second_term

# Step 5: Print the final equation with all numbers and the result.
# We display the value of m, the base, the exponent, and the final result.

# Note: The result is a very large negative number.
