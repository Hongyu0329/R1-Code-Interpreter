    Analyzes the options based on the Domain Model pattern to find inappropriate implementations.

    - A (Logic in Controller): Incorrect. This violates MVC/layered architecture principles and creates an anemic domain model. Business logic does not belong in the UI/request-handling layer.
    - B (Logic all in one class): Incorrect. This creates a "God Object" and violates the Single Responsibility Principle. Logic like discount calculation belongs to the Customer, and inventory checking belongs to the Book.
    - C (Distributed logic in relevant classes): Correct. This represents a rich domain model where behavior is encapsulated with the data it operates on.
    - D (Logic all in a service): Incorrect. This is the Transaction Script pattern, which results in an Anemic Domain Model where domain objects are just data bags.
    - E (Logic in both domain objects and services): Correct. This is a common and robust approach. Core entity logic is in the domain objects, and a service class orchestrates the overall process, especially when it involves multiple domain objects or infrastructure concerns (like sending emails).

    The inappropriate options are A, B, and D.
