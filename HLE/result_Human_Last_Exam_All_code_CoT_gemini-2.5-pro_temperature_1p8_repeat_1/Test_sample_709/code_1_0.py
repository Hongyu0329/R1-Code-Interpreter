# Task Analysis and Solution

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the Tzotzil sentence to arrive at the correct English translation.

The sentence is: Oy `ox k`op ta batz`i k`op ta jna junabi.

**Step 1: Word-by-word breakdown**

*   `Oy`: Existential particle, meaning "there is/are". With the past marker `junabi`, it becomes "there was".
*   ``ox`: The number "three". In the phrase ``ox k`op`, this number contributes to an idiomatic meaning.
*   `k`op`: Can mean "word", "language", or "talk". The phrase ``ox k`op` (literally "three words") is often used idiomatically to mean "a talk" or "a discussion".
*   `ta`: Preposition meaning "in", "at", or "on".
*   `batz`i k`op`: Literally "true language", which the speakers use to refer to their own native language (Tzotzil).
*   `jna`: A contraction of `j-` ("my") and `na` ("house"), meaning "my house".
*   `junabi`: Time adverb meaning "last year".

**Step 2: Assembling the translation**

Putting the pieces together, we get:
"There was (Oy...junabi) a talk/discussion (`ox k`op`) in the native language (ta batz`i k`op`) at my house (ta jna`) last year (junabi`)."

**Step 3: Evaluating the options**

Let's compare this translation with the provided choices:

*   A, B, F, G are incorrect due to wrong locations or times.
*   C and E are incorrect translations.
*   This leaves D and H:
    *   D: `There was talk in Tzotzil at my house last year.`
    *   H: `There was talk in my native language at my house last year.`

Both D and H are very close. `batz`i k`op` can be translated as both "Tzotzil" and "native language". However, the sentence has a personal context due to `jna` ("my house"). Translating `batz`i k`op` as "my native language" fits this personal context very naturally in English. Thus, H is the most suitable choice.
