    Analyzes the question of whether the second postulate of special relativity

    print("Question: Is the 2nd postulate of special relativity superfluous and can be deduced from the first?")
    print("-" * 80)
    print("This is a classic question in the philosophy of physics. Here is a step-by-step analysis:")
    print("\nStep 1: The Postulates")
    print("1. The Principle of Relativity: The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames of reference.")
    print("2. The Constancy of the Speed of Light: The speed of light in a vacuum (c) has the same value in all inertial frames.")

    print("\nStep 2: The Argument for Deduction (The 'Yes' argument)")
    print("This argument hinges on accepting Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism as a fundamental 'law of physics'.")
    print("  - Maxwell's equations predict that light waves travel at a specific speed, c.")
    print("  - If we apply Postulate 1 (laws of physics are the same everywhere) to Maxwell's equations, it follows that the predicted speed, c, must also be the same for all observers.")
    print("  - From this viewpoint, Postulate 2 appears to be a logical consequence of Postulate 1.")

    print("\nStep 3: The Argument Against it being Superfluous (The 'No' argument)")
    print("This argument highlights the role of the postulate in building the theory.")
    print("  - Before Einstein, the prevailing view was that Postulate 1 did NOT apply to electromagnetism. It was thought Maxwell's equations were only valid in a special frame (the 'ether').")
    print("  - Einstein's revolutionary step was to INSIST that Postulate 1 applied to ALL physics. He then elevated a known consequence of electromagnetism to a universal principle of its own (Postulate 2).")
    print("  - Why do this? Because Postulate 2 directly forces a change in our fundamental understanding of space and time. It replaces classical velocity addition (v' = v + u) with a new, non-intuitive reality.")
    print("  - Postulate 1 alone is not enough to get to special relativity. Postulate 1 could still be true in a universe with Galilean relativity (where velocities add and the speed of light is not constant for all observers). It is Postulate 2 that forces the theory to be relativistic in the Einsteinian sense, not the Galilean one.")

    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion")
    print("The second postulate is not considered superfluous. It is the key piece of physical information that, when combined with the principle of relativity, dismantles classical notions of absolute time and space. While logically contained within the union of Postulate 1 and Maxwell's theory, stating it as a separate, foundational principle was a critical step in building the new kinematics of special relativity clearly and unambiguously.")
