    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I will analyze the question to understand the core graph theory concept being asked. The question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number ($\\chi(G)$) for a graph $G$ with a specific number of vertices ($n=12345$), given that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n2.  I will establish a tight upper bound for the chromatic number of such a graph.\n3.  I will prove this upper bound in two steps:\n    a.  Show that for any non-complete graph on $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n-1$.\n    b.  Show that this bound of $n-1$ can be achieved by constructing a specific graph that meets the problem's criteria and has a chromatic number of exactly $n-1$.\n4.  The construction I will use is a complete graph $K_n$ with a single edge removed. I will demonstrate that this graph contains a clique of size $n-1$, which means its chromatic number must be at least $n-1$.\n5.  Combining these points, the maximum possible chromatic number is confirmed to be $n-1$.\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script that articulates this logic and calculates the result for $n=12345$. The script will print out the step-by-step reasoning and the final calculation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring\n    of a graph G with 12345 vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    n = 12345\n    \n    print(\"Let n be the number of vertices in the graph G.\")\n    print(f\"n = {n}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper coloring of G, which is the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, chi(G).\")\n    print(\"The graph G has n=12345 vertices and is not a complete graph (K_n).\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Find an upper bound for chi(G).\")\n    print(\"A complete graph K_n requires n colors, as every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\")\n    print(\"However, the problem states that G is NOT a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"This means there is at least one pair of vertices, let's call them u and v, that are not connected by an edge.\")\n    print(\"Because u and v are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color in a proper coloring.\")\n    print(\"We can devise a coloring scheme: color u and v with color 1.
