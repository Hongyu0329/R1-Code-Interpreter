# Define the known quantities from the problem description.
n = 9  # Number of pirates (vertices)
e = 16 # Number of pairs at gunpoint (edges)

# The problem can be modeled as a connected planar graph.
# A "Mexican standoff" is interpreted as a face in the planar embedding of this graph.
# We use Euler's formula for connected planar graphs: n - e + f = 2,
# where 'n' is vertices, 'e' is edges, and 'f' is faces.

# We can solve for 'f' to find the number of standoffs.
# The formula is: f = 2 - n + e
f = 2 - n + e

# The calculation provides the maximum number of possible standoffs.
