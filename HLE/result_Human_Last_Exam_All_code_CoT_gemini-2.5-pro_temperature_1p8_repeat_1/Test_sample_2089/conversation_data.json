    "I will answer your question by identifying the specific film and then, as requested, I will provide the answer within a Python code block using the `print` function.\n\nThe film you're referring to is the 2004 thriller *Collateral*, which received an Oscar nomination for Jamie Foxx for Best Supporting Actor. In the film, a hitman named Vincent (played by Tom Cruise) is hunting a target. To confirm the target's identity, Vincent has the cab driver Max (played by Jamie Foxx) call the target's phone. As the man is about to get on a public bus, he answers, then hangs up. As he boards the bus, he turns to the driver and says \"Thank you,\" which gives Vincent a clear view of his face and a clean shot to kill him, thus sealing his fate.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the film that matches the description.\nfilm_title = \"Collateral\"\nprint(f\"The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \\\"Thank you\\\" while boarding a bus is: {film_title}\")\n```\n<<<Collateral>>>"
