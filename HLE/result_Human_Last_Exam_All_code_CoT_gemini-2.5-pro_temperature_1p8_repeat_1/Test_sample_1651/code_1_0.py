    intro = """
    The problem asks for the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points for F in the Stone-Cech remainder of R.

    Let's break it down:
    1.  R is the real line.
    2.  βR is the Stone-Cech compactification of R. It's a compact space containing R as a dense subset.
    3.  The Stone-Cech remainder is R* = βR \\ R. It can be thought of as the set of points "at infinity". It has two connected components, R*_+, the points at positive infinity, and R*_-, the points at negative infinity.
    4.  f: R -> R is a continuous function.
    5.  F: βR -> βR is the unique continuous extension of f.
    6.  A fixed point in the remainder is a point p in R* such that F(p) = p.

    can_it_be_zero = """
    Step 1: Can the number of fixed points be zero?

    Yes. Consider the function f(x) = -x.
    -   As x approaches +infinity, f(x) approaches -infinity. This means the extension F maps the "positive" part of the remainder (R*_+) to the "negative" part (R*_-).
    -   Similarly, F maps R*_- to R*_+.
    -   Since F maps every point in the remainder to a different component of the remainder, it's impossible for any point p in R* to satisfy F(p) = p.
    -   So, the number of fixed points can be 0.

    why_not_one = """
    Step 2: If the number is non-zero, can it be one?

    No. It has been proven in topology that if the extension F has any fixed points in the remainder R*, it must have at least two. This is a non-trivial theorem (proven by M. Hoffman and J. van Mill in 1998).

    Here is a heuristic argument for why this might be true:
    -   Consider an odd function, e.g., f(x) = x + sin(x). (An odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x)).
    -   For an odd function, one can show that if p is a fixed point of its extension F, then its reflection -p is also a fixed point.
    -   If p is a point in R*_+, then -p is a distinct point in R*_-.
    -   Thus, for any odd function that has at least one fixed point in the remainder, it must have at least two.
    -   The full proof extends this idea to cover all continuous functions, not just odd ones.

    can_it_be_two = """
    Step 3: Can the number of fixed points be exactly two?

    Yes. The same paper by Hoffman and van Mill that proved the number must be at least two also provides a constructive example of a continuous function f: R -> R whose extension F has exactly two fixed points in the remainder R*.

    The construction of this function is highly complex and technical, designed to precisely control the behavior of its extension at infinity.

    conclusion = """
    Conclusion:

    -   The number of fixed points can be 0.
    -   If the number of fixed points is non-zero, it must be at least 2.
    -   An example with exactly 2 fixed points exists.

    Therefore, the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points of F in the Stone-Cech remainder is 2.
