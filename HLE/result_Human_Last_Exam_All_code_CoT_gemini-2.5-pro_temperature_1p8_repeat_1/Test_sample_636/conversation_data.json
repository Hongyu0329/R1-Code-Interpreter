    "To find the state feedback gain `F` that places the closed-loop eigenvalues of the system `A + BF` at the desired locations, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the System:** We are given the matrices `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]` and `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`.\n2.  **Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial:** The desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair `λ = -1 ± j`. The characteristic polynomial for these eigenvalues is `(s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j)) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\n3.  **Formulate Equations:** The characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system `A + BF` is `det(sI - (A + BF)) = 0`. By defining `F` with unknown elements `f1, f2, f3, f4` and matching the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial with our desired one, we get a system of linear equations. This system is underdetermined (2 equations, 4 unknowns).\n4.  **Find a Solution:** To find a specific solution, we can introduce a simplification. We assume that the feedback gain only uses the first input channel of the system, which is a common approach if the system is controllable through that channel. This means we set the second row of `F` to all zeros (`f3 = 0, f4 = 0`). This simplifies the problem to a solvable `2x2` system of linear equations for `f1` and `f2`:\n    *   `f1 + f2 = -1`\n    *   `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n5.  **Solve with Code:** The following Python code solves this system for `f1` and `f2`, constructs the full `F` matrix, and verifies that the resulting closed-loop system `A + BF` has the correct eigenvalues.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_and_verify():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the state feedback gain F for a given system to place\n    eigenvalues at desired locations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define system matrices\n    A = np.array([[-1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0]])\n    B = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [1.0, 0.0]])\n\n    # The problem of placing eigenvalues at -1 +/- j leads to an\n    # underdetermined system of equations for the elements of F.\n    # By simplifying F to have a second row of zeros, we get a\n    # solvable linear system for the first row [f1, f2]:\n    #  1*f1 + 1*f2 = -1\n    # -1*f1 - 2*f2 =  3\n\n    # We can write this system in matrix form M*x = v, where x = [f1, f2]'\n    M = np.array([[1.0, 1.0], [-1.0, -2.0]])\n    v = np.array([-1.0, 3.0])\n\n    # Solve for x = [f1, f2]\n    try:\n        solution = np.linalg.solve(M, v)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(\"The system of equations could not be solved.\")\n        return\n\n    # Construct the full gain matrix F from the solution\n    F = np.array([\n        [solution[0], solution[1]],\n        [0.0, 0.0]\n    ])\n\n    # Calculate the closed-loop matrix A_cl = A + B*F for display\n    A_cl = A + B @ F\n\n    # Print all the matrices involved in the final equation as requested\n    print(\"The goal is to find F such that the eigenvalues of A + B*F are at -1 +/- j.\")\n    print(\"A solution for F is:\")\n    print(\"F =\\n\", F)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe full equation A + B*F = A_cl contains the following matrices:\")\n    print(\"\\nA =\\n\", A)\n    print(\"\\nB =\\n\", B)\n    print(\"\\nResulting in A_cl =\\n\", A_cl)\n\n\n    # --- Verification Step ---\n    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_cl)\n    print(\"\\n--- Verification ---\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of the final matrix A_cl are:\")\n    # Using np.round to handle potential floating point inaccuracies\n    print(np.round(eigenvalues, 5))\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_and_verify()\n```\n<<<[[ 1. -2.], [ 0.  0.]]>>>"
