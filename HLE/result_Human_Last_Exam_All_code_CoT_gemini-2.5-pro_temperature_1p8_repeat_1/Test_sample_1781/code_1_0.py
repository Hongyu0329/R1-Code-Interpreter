    # Step 2: Analyze the question's second part about the epithet's source.
    # Philip II's epithet, "Augustus", was given to him by his chronicler, Rigord,
    # a monk of Saint-Denis. Rigord documented this in his biography "Gesta Philippi Augusti".

    print(f"C. {options['C']['year']}, {options['C']['person']}: The person, {biographer_source}, is correct. The year {options['C']['year']} is the year of Philip II's death, not the start of the title change, but it marks the end of his transformative reign.")

    # specific event of 1190, it accurately frames the event within the monarch's reign, making this the most plausible choice.
