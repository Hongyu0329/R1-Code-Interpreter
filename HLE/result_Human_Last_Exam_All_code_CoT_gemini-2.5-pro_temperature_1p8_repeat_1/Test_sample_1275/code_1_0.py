    # For part B, we need to state a bound. We will use an expression

    # --- Part A ---
    # Question: Must every geodesic word representing an element in alpha(K) be
    # fully quasireduced if K is rational?
    # Answer: Yes. It is a known result in geometric group theory that any geodesic
    # in a hyperbolic group is fully quasireduced for universal constants
    # depending on the group, specifically on delta.
    answer_A = "Yes"

    # --- Part B ---
    # Question: Is there a finite bound for epsilon such that a fully (1, epsilon)-quasireduced
    # word in alpha(K) exists for a rational K? If so, state the bound.
    # Answer: Yes, such a word exists (any geodesic word will do). The bound can be
    # expressed in terms of delta and R. A plausible expression reflecting the interplay
    # between hyperbolicity and automata-theoretic properties is 4*delta + R.

    # --- Part C ---
    # Question: Is it true that alpha(K) contains only quasigeodesic words
    # if K is context-free?
    # Answer: No. If K contains the identity element {1}, it can be represented by a
    # context-free language (e.g., the Dyck language). This language contains words
    # of arbitrary length that represent the identity (e.g., w * w_inverse). Such words are
    # not quasigeodesics as their length is large while the distance they span is 0.
