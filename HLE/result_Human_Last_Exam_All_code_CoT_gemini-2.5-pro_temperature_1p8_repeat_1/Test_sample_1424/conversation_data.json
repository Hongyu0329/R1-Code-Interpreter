    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, particularly in the context of many-body quantum theory, the relationship between the bare Green's function ($G_0$) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$) is most clearly expressed in frequency-momentum space. The bare Green's function describes the propagation of a single particle in a non-interacting system.\n\nThe functional form is derived by performing a Fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency domain. For calculations involving temperature, it is common to use the Matsubara (or imaginary time) formalism. In this representation, the bare Green's function for a fermion with momentum **k** and fermionic Matsubara frequency $i\\omega_n$ has a very simple and fundamental dependence on the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$:\n\n$G_0(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}}$\n\nHere, $\\epsilon_k$ is the energy of the single-particle state with quantum number $k$, often measured relative to the chemical potential. This equation shows that the Green's function has a simple pole at the particle's energy. This relationship is a cornerstone of diagrammatic perturbation theory.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this functional relationship by calculating the value of the bare Green's function for a given single-particle energy and a Matsubara frequency.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(i_omega_n, epsilon_k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function in Matsubara frequency space.\n\n    Args:\n        i_omega_n (complex): The fermionic Matsubara frequency (e.g., 3.0j).\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n\n    Returns:\n        complex: The value of the bare Green's function G_0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The core formula for the bare Green's function\n    G_0 = 1 / (i_omega_n - epsilon_k)\n    return G_0\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to demonstrate the calculation and print the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # Example single-particle energy eigenvalue (relative to the chemical potential)\n    # Units are arbitrary (e.g., eV).\n    epsilon_k = 2.0\n\n    # Example fermionic Matsubara frequency. In Python, the imaginary unit is 'j'.\n    # This would correspond to a specific temperature and integer n in omega_n = (2n+1)pi*T\n    i_omega_n = 3.0j\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    G0_value = calculate_bare_greens_function(i_omega_n, epsilon_k)\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"In the Matsubara formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a direct dependence on the single-particle energy epsilon_k.\")\n    print(\"The functional form is: G_0(k, i*omega_n) = 1 / (i*omega_n - epsilon_k)\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's calculate an example:\")\n\n    # Print the equation with the specific numbers used\n    print(f\"\\nFor epsilon_k = {epsilon_k} and i*omega_n = {i_omega_n}:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({i_omega_n} - {epsilon_k})\")\n\n    # Print the final calculated value\n    print(f\"\\nG_0 = {G0_value}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<$G_0(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}}$>>>"
