    print("   - A fundamental result in category theory is that all left adjoints preserve colimits.")
    print("   - The initial object is a type of colimit (an empty colimit). In C, the initial object is '0'.")
    print("   - Therefore, the functor F(X) must map the initial object '0' to the initial object '0'.")
    print(f"   - This gives our second key equation: 0 x A {iso} 0.")
