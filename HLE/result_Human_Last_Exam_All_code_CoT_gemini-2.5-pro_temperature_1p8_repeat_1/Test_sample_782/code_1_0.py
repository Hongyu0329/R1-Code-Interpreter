# Step-by-step cost analysis for computing 2A - 3B

# Cost of step 1: Computing D = A-B in projective coordinates using mixed addition.
cost_A_minus_B = 8  # in Multiplications (M)

# Cost of step 2: Doubling the point D in projective coordinates.
cost_doubling_D = 7  # in Multiplications (M)

# Cost of step 3: Computing R = 2D-B in projective coordinates using mixed addition.
cost_2D_minus_B = 8  # in Multiplications (M)

# Cost of step 4: Converting the final result R from projective to extended coordinates.
cost_conversion_to_extended = 4  # in Multiplications (M)

# Calculate the total cost
total_cost = cost_A_minus_B + cost_doubling_D + cost_2D_minus_B + cost_conversion_to_extended

# Print the breakdown of the final cost calculation
