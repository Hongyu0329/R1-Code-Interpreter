    "To find the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans based on synapse number, I will use a Python script. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Access Connectome Data**: I will use the `celegans-connectome` library, which provides easy access to published C. elegans connectome datasets. Specifically, I'll use the well-documented dataset from Kato et al., 2014.\n2.  **Filter Connections**: I will filter the chemical synapse data to isolate all connections originating from the presynaptic neurons ASJL and ASJR.\n3.  **Aggregate Synapse Counts**: I will group these connections by their postsynaptic target neuron and sum the number of synapses for each target.\n4.  **Identify Main Target**: I'll find the target neuron that receives the maximum total number of synapses from the ASJ pair.\n5.  **Display Results**: I will print the name of the main target cell and the detailed breakdown of the synapse counts from ASJL and ASJR that lead to the total.\n\nThis approach will systematically analyze the entire connectome to provide a definitive answer based on the selected dataset.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_asj_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main postsynaptic target of ASJ neurons in C. elegans.\n    This function uses a publicly available connectome dataset to calculate\n    which neuron receives the most synapses from the ASJ neuron pair (ASJL/ASJR).\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        from celegans_connectome.load import load_connectome\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"Error: The 'celegans-connectome' library is not installed.\")\n        print(\"Please install it to run this code:\")\n        print(\"pip install celegans-connectome pandas\")\n        return\n\n    # Load the chemical synapse data for the adult hermaphrodite from Kato et al., 2014\n    # The 'chem' DataFrame contains columns: 'pre' (presynaptic), 'post' (postsynaptic), 'synapses'\n    try:\n        chem, _ = load_connectome(dataset_name=\"c-elegans-splinter-connectome\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to load connectome data.
