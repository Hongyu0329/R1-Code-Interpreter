    "The question asks for a specific polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago, a clear reference to dinosaurs. The molecule in question is a synthetic hydrocarbon designed to resemble the shape of a Tyrannosaurus rex. I will write a Python script to print out the name of this molecule and the creature it's named after.\n\n```python\ndef find_dinosaur_hydrocarbon():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a famous dinosaur.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The hydrocarbon is designed to mimic the shape of a T-Rex.\n    hydrocarbon_name = \"T-rexanene\"\n\n    # The creature it's named after.\n    creature_name = \"Tyrannosaurus rex\"\n\n    # The time in millions of years since this creature has been extinct.\n    extinction_age_in_millions = 65\n\n    # Print the answer.\n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon is named '{hydrocarbon_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"It is named after the {creature_name}, which has been extinct for over {extinction_age_in_millions} million years.\")\n\nfind_dinosaur_hydrocarbon()\n```\n<<<T-rexanene>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
