# Final Plan:
# 1. Identify the core translation challenge: a phonetic pun central to the plot in both stories.
#    - "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter": "bunch of keys" misheard as something like "bunch of fish".
#    - "The Next Day": "you, there" misheard as "Uther".
# 2. Evaluate each proposed translation practice.
#    - I. Transcreation: This involves creating a new, analogous pun in the target language. This is a primary and effective solution.
#    - II. Embedded audio link: This allows the reader to hear the original English pun, making the plot mechanics clear. This is a valid, if technical, solution.
#    - III. Changing the setting: This doesn't inherently solve the linguistic pun problem. It is not a direct solution.
#    - IV. Character with an accent: This provides a narrative device to create a new, plausible phonetic misunderstanding in the target language. This is a form of creative adaptation and is a valid solution.
#    - V. Pictorial illustration: A picture can't convey sound or phonetic ambiguity. It is not a solution.
#    - VI. Footnotes with phonetic transcription: This explicitly explains the original pun to the reader, ensuring comprehension. This is a common and valid solution.
# 3. The viable solutions are I, II, IV, and VI.
# 4. The final step is to format these Roman numerals as a hyphen-separated string, as requested. The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as outputting each Roman numeral in the final sequence.

options = ["I", "II", "IV", "VI"]

# Constructing the final output string containing each selected Roman numeral.
final_answer = "-".join(options)

# Printing the final formatted answer.
print(final_answer)
