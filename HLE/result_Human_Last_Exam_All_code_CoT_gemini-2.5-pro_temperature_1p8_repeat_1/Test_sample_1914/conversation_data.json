    "To find the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we need to perform a case-by-case analysis. This is a combinatorial problem of classifying small algebraic structures.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Let the two objects be $A$ and $B$. Any category must have identity morphisms for each object, so we have $id_A$ and $id_B$. This accounts for 2 of the 4 morphisms.\n2.  We are left with 2 non-identity morphisms. We need to classify all possible structures based on where these two morphisms are located. The possible locations are the four \"hom-sets\": $Hom(A,A)$, $Hom(A,B)$, $Hom(B,A)$, and $Hom(B,B)$.\n3.  I'll categorize the possibilities based on how the 2 non-identity morphisms are distributed among these four hom-sets.\n4.  For each case, I will determine the number of valid, non-isomorphic category structures. This involves defining the composition rules for the morphisms and ensuring they satisfy the category axioms (especially associativity).\n5.  Finally, I will sum up the counts from all the distinct cases.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this step-by-step reasoning and compute the final sum.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n#\n# Let the two objects be A and B.\n# Any category with 2 objects must have at least two morphisms: the identity morphisms id_A and id_B.\n# So, we have 4 - 2 = 2 non-identity morphisms to place and define composition rules for.\n# Let's denote the hom-sets as Hom(X, Y) for X, Y in {A, B}.\n#\n# We can partition the 2 non-identity morphisms into the 4 hom-sets.\n# The partitions of 2 are:\n# 1. 2: Both morphisms are in the same hom-set.\n# 2. 1+1: The two morphisms are in different hom-sets.\n#\n# We will analyze each case up to isomorphism (which includes swapping the roles of A and B).\n\nprint(\"Analyzing cases based on the distribution of the 2 non-identity morphisms:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\n# Case 1: Both non-identity morphisms are in the same hom-set.\n#\n# Subcase 1.1: Both morphisms are in Hom(A, A).\n# - Hom(A,A) now has 1 (identity) + 2 (non-identity) = 3 morphisms. It must form a monoid.\n# - Hom(B,B) has only the identity morphism.\n# - The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is 5. Each defines a distinct category.\nnum_case_1_1 = 5\nprint(f\"Case '2 in Hom(A,A)': Hom(A,A) must be a monoid of order 3. This gives {num_case_1_1} categories.\")\n\n# The case where both are in Hom(B, B) is isomorphic by swapping A and B.\n\n# Subcase 1.2: Both morphisms are in Hom(A, B).\n# - We have two parallel morphisms from A to B. Let's call them f and g.\n# - Hom(A,A) and Hom(B,B) only contain identity morphisms.\n# - No compositions of non-identity morphisms are possible. Associativity is trivially satisfied.\n# - This structure is unique up to renaming f and g.\nnum_case_1_2 = 1\nprint(f\"Case '2 in Hom(A,B)': Two parallel arrows from A to B. This gives {num_case_1_2} category.\")\n\n# The case where both are in Hom(B, A) is isomorphic by swapping A and B.\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\n# Case 2: The two non-identity morphisms are in different hom-sets.\n#\n# Subcase 2.1: One in Hom(A, A) and one in Hom(B, B).\n# - Both Hom(A,A) and Hom(B,B) have 2 morphisms and must form monoids of order 2.\n# - There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2 (one where f*f=id, one where f*f=f).\n# - Counting pairs of these monoids {M_A, M_B} up to swapping gives 3 possibilities.\nnum_case_2_1 = 3\nprint(f\"Case '1 in Hom(A,A), 1 in Hom(B,B)': Depends on choices for monoids of order 2. This gives {num_case_2_1} categories.\")\n\n# Subcase 2.2: One in Hom(A, A) and one in Hom(A, B).\n# - Hom(A,A) is a monoid of order 2 (2 choices). The morphism in Hom(A,B) must compose with it.\n# - The composition rules are forced by the structure. Both choices for the monoid on Hom(A,A) yield valid, non-isomorphic categories.\nnum_case_2_2 = 2\nprint(f\"Case '1 in Hom(A,A), 1 in Hom(A,B)': Structure is determined by Hom(A,A). This gives {num_case_2_2} categories.\")\n\n# Subcase 2.3: One in Hom(A, A) and one in Hom(B, A).\n# - This is the \"dual\" of the previous case.

The structure is fixed.\nnum_case_2_4 = 1\nprint(f\"Case '1 in Hom(A,B), 1 in Hom(B,A)': The isomorphism category.
