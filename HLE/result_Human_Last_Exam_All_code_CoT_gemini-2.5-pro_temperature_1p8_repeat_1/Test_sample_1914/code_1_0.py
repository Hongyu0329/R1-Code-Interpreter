# The problem is to find the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.
#
# Let the two objects be A and B.
# Any category with 2 objects must have at least two morphisms: the identity morphisms id_A and id_B.
# So, we have 4 - 2 = 2 non-identity morphisms to place and define composition rules for.
# Let's denote the hom-sets as Hom(X, Y) for X, Y in {A, B}.
#
# We can partition the 2 non-identity morphisms into the 4 hom-sets.
# The partitions of 2 are:
# 1. 2: Both morphisms are in the same hom-set.
# 2. 1+1: The two morphisms are in different hom-sets.
#
# We will analyze each case up to isomorphism (which includes swapping the roles of A and B).

# Subcase 1.1: Both morphisms are in Hom(A, A).
# - Hom(A,A) now has 1 (identity) + 2 (non-identity) = 3 morphisms. It must form a monoid.

# - We have two parallel morphisms from A to B. Let's call them f and g.
# - Hom(A,A) and Hom(B,B) only contain identity morphisms.
# - No compositions of non-identity morphisms are possible. Associativity is trivially satisfied.
# - This structure is unique up to renaming f and g.
num_case_1_2 = 1

# Subcase 2.1: One in Hom(A, A) and one in Hom(B, B).
# - Both Hom(A,A) and Hom(B,B) have 2 morphisms and must form monoids of order 2.
# - There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2 (one where f*f=id, one where f*f=f).

num_case_2_1 = 3

# - Hom(A,A) is a monoid of order 2 (2 choices). The morphism in Hom(A,B) must compose with it.
# - The composition rules are forced by the structure. Both choices for the monoid on Hom(A,A) yield valid, non-isomorphic categories.
num_case_2_2 = 2
print(f"Case '1 in Hom(A,A), 1 in Hom(A,B)': Structure is determined by Hom(A,A). This gives {num_case_2_2} categories.")

# Subcase 2.4: One in Hom(A, B) and one in Hom(B, A).
# - We have f: A -> B and g: B -> A.
# - Composition g o f must be id_A and f o g must be id_B, as Hom(A,A) and Hom(B,B) have only one element.
# - This defines the category where A and B are isomorphic. The structure is fixed.
