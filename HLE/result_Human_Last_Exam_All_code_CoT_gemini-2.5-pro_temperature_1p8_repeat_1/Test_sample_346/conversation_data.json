    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand what the complex SKI combinator expression represents. The problem states that the expression is a Church integer, let's call it `n`. A Church integer `n` is a higher-order function that takes a function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times. The general form is `C_n = λf.λx. f^n(x)`.\n\nOur goal is to determine the value of `n`. A direct, step-by-step reduction of the SKI expression is extremely complex. A more practical approach is to analyze the structure of the expression and its behavior when applied to arguments.\n\nLet's denote the main combinators:\n- `T = S(I)` (Thrush combinator): `T x y z = z (x z)`\n- `C_k`: The Church numeral for integer k. For example, `I` (Identity) is `C_1`.\n- `SUCC = S(S(K(S))(K))`: The successor function, where `SUCC(C_k) = C_{k+1}`.\n- `M = S(I)(I)` (Mockingbird combinator): `M f = f(f)`.\n\nThe given expression can be written using these names as: `T( T( T( K(SUCC(I)) ) ) ( SUCC(M) ) ) )`.\nLet's call the entire expression `E`. Since `E` is a Church numeral `C_n`, its application to a function `f` should yield a new function, which when applied to `x` results in `f^n(x)`.\nLet's analyze `E`'s application to a generic function `f`:\n`E(f) = f( f( (f(C_2)) (f(f(f))) ) )`\nHere, `C_2` appears because `SUCC(I) = SUCC(C_1) = C_2`. The nested structure comes from the repeated application of the `T` combinator. The `f(f(f))` part comes from the `SUCC(M)` term.\n\nThe expression `f` appears applied to other functions (like `f(C_2)` or `f(f)`) instead of just a value `x`. This is a strong hint that `f` itself is intended to be a Church numeral. A common technique for such problems is to test the expression with a simple, non-trivial Church numeral. Let's choose `f = C_2`.\n\nWhen Church numerals are applied to each other, they behave like exponentiation: `C_a(C_b) = C_{b^a}`.\nUsing this rule, we can evaluate `E(C_2)`:\n\n1.  Let `f = C_2`. The inner terms are `f(C_2)` and `f(f(f))`.\n2.  `f(C_2)` becomes `C_2(C_2) = C_{2^2} = C_4`.\n3.  `f(f(f))` becomes `C_2(C_2(C_2)) = C_2(C_4) = C_{4^2} = C_{16}`.\n4.  These two are applied to each other: `(f(C_2))(f(f(f)))` becomes `C_4(C_{16}) = C_{16^4} = C_{(2^4)^4} = C_{2^{16}}`.\n5.  This result is nested within two applications of `f`: `f(f(...))`.\n6.  The first application of `f`: `f(C_{2^{16}})` becomes `C_2(C_{2^{16}}) = C_{(2^{16})^2} = C_{2^{32}}`.\n7.  The final application of `f`: `f(C_{2^{32}})` becomes `C_2(C_{2^{32}}) = C_{(2^{32})^2} = C_{2^{64}}`.\n\nSo, we found that `E(C_2) = C_{2^{64}}`.\nSince `E` is `C_n`, we have `E(C_2) = C_n(C_2) = C_{2^n}`.\nBy equating the results, we get `C_{2^n} = C_{2^{64}}`, which implies `2^n = 2^{64}`, and therefore `n = 64`.\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(64) = 6`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result by modeling the exponentiation behavior of Church numerals.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We model Church numerals by their integer values, focusing on how they combine.\n# The key insight is that for Church numerals, C_a(C_b) corresponds to C_{b^a}.\n# The expression E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))\n# evaluates, for an argument f, to f(f((f C_2)(f(f f)))), where C_2 = SUCC(I).\n\n# To find the value of n for E = C_n, we evaluate E(C_2).\n# Let's substitute f with C_2 (represented by the number 2).\n# The operations will be based on the exponentiation rule: a(b) -> b**a.\n\n# Start value for 'f'\nf = 2\n\n# Term 1: f(C_2) => C_2(C_2) => 2(2) => 2**2\nterm1_val = f**f\n# print(f\"Value of f(C_2) where f=C_2 is {term1_val}\") # 4\n\n# Term 2: f(f(f)) => C_2(C_2(C_2)) => 2(2(2)) => 2(2**2) = 2(4) => 4**2\nterm2_val = (f**f)**f\n# print(f\"Value of f(f(f)) where f=C_2 is {term2_val}\") # 16\n\n# Innermost application: (f(C_2))(f(f(f))) => term1_val(term2_val) => term2_val ** term1_val\ninner_app_val = term2_val ** term1_val\n# print(f\"Value of inner application is 16**4 = {inner_app_val}\") # 65536, or 2^16\n\n# The result is nested in f(f(...)). So we apply f two more times.\n# First nesting: f(...) => f(inner_app_val) => inner_app_val ** f\nres1_val = inner_app_val ** f\n# print(f\"Value after first nesting is (2^16)^2 = 2^32\")\n\n# Second nesting: f(...) => f(res1_val) => res1_val ** f\nfinal_e_c2_val_log2 = math.log2(res1_val) * f\n# final_e_c2 is a huge number (2^64), so we work with its log.\n# log2(E(C_2)) = log2( (res1_val)^f ) = f * log2(res1_val)\n# log2(res1_val) = f * log2(inner_app_val)\n# log2(inner_app_val) = term1_val * log2(term2_val)\n# log2(term2_val) = f * log2(f**f) = f * f * log2(f) = 2*2*1=4\n# So log2(term2_val) is 4\n# log2(inner_app_val) = term1_val * 4 = 4 * 4 = 16\n# log2(res1_val) = f * 16 = 2 * 16 = 32\n# log2(E(C_2)) = f * 32 = 2 * 32 = 64.\n# So E(C_2) evaluates to a number whose log2 is 64, i.e., 2^64.\n\n# We have E(C_2) = C_{2^64}.\n# We also know for E=C_n, E(C_2) = C_n(C_2) = C_{2^n}.\n# Equating these gives: 2^n = 2^64, so n = 64.\nn = 64\n\n# The final question is log_2(n)\nlog2_n = math.log2(n)\n\n# Print the final equation as requested\nprint(f\"The church integer is n = {n}\")\nprint(f\"log_2({n}) = {int(log2_n)}\")\n```\n<<<6>>>"
