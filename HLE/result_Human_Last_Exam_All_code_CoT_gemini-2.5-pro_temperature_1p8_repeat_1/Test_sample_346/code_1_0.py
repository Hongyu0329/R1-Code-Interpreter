# We model Church numerals by their integer values, focusing on how they combine.
# The key insight is that for Church numerals, C_a(C_b) corresponds to C_{b^a}.
# The expression E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))
# evaluates, for an argument f, to f(f((f C_2)(f(f f)))), where C_2 = SUCC(I).

# To find the value of n for E = C_n, we evaluate E(C_2).
# Let's substitute f with C_2 (represented by the number 2).
# The operations will be based on the exponentiation rule: a(b) -> b**a.

# Start value for 'f'
f = 2

# Term 1: f(C_2) => C_2(C_2) => 2(2) => 2**2
term1_val = f**f
# print(f"Value of f(C_2) where f=C_2 is {term1_val}") # 4

# Term 2: f(f(f)) => C_2(C_2(C_2)) => 2(2(2)) => 2(2**2) = 2(4) => 4**2
term2_val = (f**f)**f
# print(f"Value of f(f(f)) where f=C_2 is {term2_val}") # 16

# Innermost application: (f(C_2))(f(f(f))) => term1_val(term2_val) => term2_val ** term1_val
inner_app_val = term2_val ** term1_val
# print(f"Value of inner application is 16**4 = {inner_app_val}") # 65536, or 2^16

# The result is nested in f(f(...)). So we apply f two more times.
# First nesting: f(...) => f(inner_app_val) => inner_app_val ** f
res1_val = inner_app_val ** f
# print(f"Value after first nesting is (2^16)^2 = 2^32")

# Second nesting: f(...) => f(res1_val) => res1_val ** f
final_e_c2_val_log2 = math.log2(res1_val) * f
# final_e_c2 is a huge number (2^64), so we work with its log.
# log2(E(C_2)) = log2( (res1_val)^f ) = f * log2(res1_val)
# log2(res1_val) = f * log2(inner_app_val)
# log2(inner_app_val) = term1_val * log2(term2_val)
# log2(term2_val) = f * log2(f**f) = f * f * log2(f) = 2*2*1=4
# So log2(term2_val) is 4
# log2(inner_app_val) = term1_val * 4 = 4 * 4 = 16
# log2(res1_val) = f * 16 = 2 * 16 = 32
# log2(E(C_2)) = f * 32 = 2 * 32 = 64.
# So E(C_2) evaluates to a number whose log2 is 64, i.e., 2^64.

# We have E(C_2) = C_{2^64}.
# We also know for E=C_n, E(C_2) = C_n(C_2) = C_{2^n}.
# Equating these gives: 2^n = 2^64, so n = 64.
n = 64

# The final question is log_2(n)
log2_n = math.log2(n)

# Print the final equation as requested
print(f"The church integer is n = {n}")
print(f"log_2({n}) = {int(log2_n)}")
