    Analyzes statements about probabilistic graphical models and identifies the true ones.

    The correct statements are:
    - C: The nodes in a junction tree are cliques, and the algorithm operates on their joint distributions (potentials).
    - E: High treewidth leads to large cliques, making the algorithm's exponential complexity a practical barrier.
    - G: The lack of resilience to high treewidth is a direct result of needing to manage exponentially large joint distributions for the large cliques.
    - I: The algorithm's runtime grows exponentially with the number of variables in the largest clique, so efficiency diminishes exponentially.
    - L: This is a correct, alternative definition of the Running Intersection Property, which ensures the consistency of the junction tree.

    The final result is a comma-separated list of these letters.
