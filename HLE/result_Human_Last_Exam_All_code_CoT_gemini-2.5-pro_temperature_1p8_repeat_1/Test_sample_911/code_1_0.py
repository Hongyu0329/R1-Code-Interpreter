def solve_force_on_conductor():
    """
    Calculates and prints the symbolic formula for the force per unit area on the conductor.
    
    The problem describes a setup with a surface current between a perfect magnetic
    conductor and a superconductor, with a perfect electrical conductor at the far end.
    The force on the electrical conductor is due to magnetic pressure.
    
    The magnetic field H at the conductor (x=d) is attenuated by the superconductor.
    This attenuation is captured by a hyperbolic cosine term in the denominator.
    The force is proportional to H^2.
    
    Based on the provided options, we select the one that aligns with the physical derivation
    and represents a physically plausible scenario.
