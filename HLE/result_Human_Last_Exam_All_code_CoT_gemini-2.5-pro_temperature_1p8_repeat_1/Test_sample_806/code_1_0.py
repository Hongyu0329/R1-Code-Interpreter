The clinical picture strongly suggests the patient developed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) in reaction to an anticonvulsant drug. The specific biochemical reaction that initiates this process is an abnormal interaction between the drug and the body's immune system.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1.  **Initiating Event: Non-Covalent Binding:** The process begins when the drug molecule (or its metabolite) binds directly and non-covalently to a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) protein, particularly HLA-B, located on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. This binding bypasses the normal process of antigen processing.

2.  **T-Cell Receptor Interaction:** This drug-HLA complex is then recognized as a "foreign" structure by T-Cell Receptors (TCR) on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (a type of immune cell).

3.  **Immune Cell Activation:** This recognition directly activates the T-cells, causing them to multiply rapidly and release inflammatory signaling molecules (cytokines).

4.  **Targeted Cell Killing:** The activated cytotoxic T-cells migrate to the skin. There, they release a potent cytotoxic protein called **granulysin**.

5.  **Keratinocyte Apoptosis:** Granulysin induces widespread apoptosis (programmed cell death) in keratinocytes, the main cells that make up the epidermis (the outer layer of skin).

6.  **Blister Formation:** The massive death of these skin cells causes the epidermis to separate from the underlying dermis, leading to the formation of the characteristic blisters and sloughing of skin seen in SJS/TEN.
