    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem and the corresponding python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant formulas:** I will use two fundamental topological formulas for Feynman diagrams.\n    *   The first relates the number of loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V): `L = I - V + 1`.\n    *   The second relates the number of vertices (V), internal lines (I), external lines (E), and the type of interaction (n-point vertex): `n * V = 2 * I + E`.\n\n2.  **Set the parameters for minimization:** To find the absolute minimum number of vertices, I will choose the simplest possible parameters:\n    *   **Loops (L):** The problem specifies `L = 2`.\n    *   **Interaction type (n):** I will assume a `φ⁴` theory, which is a very common type of interacting scalar field theory. This means each vertex connects four lines, so `n = 4`. This choice leads to a smaller number of vertices than a `φ³` theory.\n    *   **External lines (E):** The diagrams with the fewest components are \"vacuum bubbles,\" which have no external lines. Therefore, I will set `E = 0`.\n\n3.  **Solve the equations:** I will algebraically solve the system of two equations with the chosen parameters to find the value of `V`.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that carries out this calculation and prints the final equation with all the numbers substituted, as requested, to show how the minimum number of vertices is derived.\n\n```python\n# Set the parameters based on the plan\n# L: Number of loops\n# n: Number of lines meeting at a vertex (for phi-4 theory)\n# E: Number of external lines (for a vacuum bubble diagram)\nL = 2\nn = 4\nE = 0\n\n# The two fundamental equations for a Feynman diagram are:\n# 1) L = I - V + 1\n# 2) n * V = 2 * I + E\n#\n# From (1), we can express the number of internal lines (I) as:\n# I = L + V - 1\n#\n# Substitute this expression for I into equation (2):\n# n * V = 2 * (L + V - 1) + E\n#\n# Now, we solve for V (the number of vertices):\n# n * V = 2*L + 2*V - 2 + E\n# n*V - 2*V = 2*L - 2 + E\n# V * (n - 2) = 2*L - 2 + E\n# V = (2*L - 2 + E) / (n - 2)\n\n# Now, we calculate the numerator and denominator separately\n# to show the steps of the calculation.\nnumerator = 2 * L - 2 + E\ndenominator = n - 2\nmin_vertices = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the final calculation step-by-step\nprint(\"To find the minimum number of vertices (V), we use the formula:\")\nprint(\"V = (2*L - 2 + E) / (n - 2)\\n\")\nprint(f\"Given L = {L} (two loops), n = {n} (phi-4 theory), and E = {E} (vacuum diagram):\")\nprint(f\"V = (2*{L} - 2 + {E}) / ({n} - 2)\")\nprint(f\"V = ({2*L - 2 + E}) / ({n-2})\")\nprint(f\"V = {int(min_vertices)}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram is {int(min_vertices)}.\")\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
