# The problem asks for the other critical exponent for a reverse square function
# estimate for the cone in R^3. One critical exponent is given as p = 4.

# Critical exponents in this context are values of 'p' where the geometric
# nature of the functions that are "worst" for the inequality changes. This
# causes the slope of the best constant alpha (as a function of 1/p) to change.

# The critical exponent p = 4 is the Tomas-Stein exponent. It arises from
# analyzing the interaction of two transversal wave packets, which tests the
# local curvature of the cone.

# The other main critical exponent for the cone in R^3 comes from a more
# global and intricate geometric construction known as the "hairbrush"
# example, developed by Bourgain and Wolff. This example provides a
# fundamental obstruction for restriction-type estimates.

# The hairbrush example demonstrates that the inequality cannot hold for p <= 10/3.
# This makes p = 10/3 the other point where the behavior of the best constant alpha
# changes. It is the endpoint of the modern cone restriction conjecture, proven by Guth.

# Therefore, the other critical exponent is 10/3.
