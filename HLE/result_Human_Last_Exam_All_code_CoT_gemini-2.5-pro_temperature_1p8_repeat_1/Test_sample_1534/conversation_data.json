    "This is a neuroanatomical question. To answer it, I will access my knowledge base on cephalopod biology. My plan is to identify the location of the palliovisceral lobe within the cuttlefish brain and then determine which structures are situated immediately behind it. Since the user requests a coding solution, I will present these findings within a Python script that prints the answer.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know which brain regions are anatomically posterior (i.e., towards the rear of the animal) to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish.\n2.  **Access knowledge base:** The cuttlefish brain consists of a supraesophageal mass (above the esophagus) and a subesophageal mass (below the esophagus). The palliovisceral lobe is a large and very important part of the posterior subesophageal mass.\n3.  **Determine relative position:** The palliovisceral lobe is situated at the very back of the main, consolidated brain structure. It is the most posterior of the major brain lobes. Its primary function is to control the mantle, fins, and viscera (internal organs).\n4.  **Identify adjacent posterior structures:** Because the palliovisceral lobe is at the rear of the brain proper, there are no other major \"brain regions\" or \"lobes\" located behind it. Instead, the structures lying immediately posterior are the large nerves that originate from the palliovisceral lobe and extend backward to the rest of the body. Key among these are the **pallial nerves**, which contain the famous giant axons responsible for rapid mantle contraction and jet propulsion. Also originating from this area are the **visceral nerves**, which innervate the internal organs. Within the palliovisceral lobe itself, the **giant fiber lobes** are the specific sub-regions from which the giant axons originate, and they are located in the most posterior part of the lobe complex.\n5.  **Formulate the answer:** The structures adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the giant fiber lobes (often considered part of the palliovisceral complex) and the major nerve trunks (pallial and visceral nerves) that exit the brain.\n6.  **Create the Python script:** I will write a simple Python script to define these regions as strings and then print them in a clear, formatted statement.\n\n```python\ndef get_posterior_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain structures located\n    posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The palliovisceral lobe is the most posterior major lobe of the central brain mass.\n    # Therefore, the structures lying adjacent and posterior to it are primarily the\n    # nerve-originating regions within it and the major nerve trunks leaving it.\n\n    # The sub-region within the posterior palliovisceral lobe that gives rise to the giant axons.\n    region1 = \"Giant Fiber Lobes\"\n\n    # The major nerve trunks exiting the brain posteriorly.\n    region2 = \"Posterior Pallial Nerves\"\n    region3 = \"Visceral Nerves\"\n\n    print(\"In the dwarf cuttlefish brain, the structures lying adjacent posteriorly to the main body of the palliovisceral lobe are:\")\n    print(f\"- The {region1}, which are located in the posterior part of the lobe complex and give rise to the giant axons.\")\n    print(f\"- The large nerve trunks that exit the brain, primarily the {region2} and the {region3}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    get_posterior_regions()\n```\n<<<The primary structures lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the giant fiber lobes (which are technically part of the lobe complex) and the large posterior pallial and visceral nerves that exit the brain.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
