    print("The question is: Does there exist a program P that computes def_superfast(10000)?")
    print("\nThe answer is NO. Such a program cannot exist.\n")
    print("This is a well-known result from computability theory. The function described is a type of 'Busy Beaver' function, which is proven to be uncomputable. Here is why:\n")
    
    print("--- Proof by Contradiction ---\n")
    
    print("Step 1: The Assumption")
    print("Let's assume for a moment that such a program, let's call it 'P', DOES exist. 'P' is a Python program that takes the input 10000 and correctly computes and returns the value of def_superfast(10000).")
    print("We can also assume that the source code of our program 'P' is reasonably short, specifically less than 10000 characters long.\n")

    print("Step 2: The Definition of the Function")
    print("The function def_superfast(10000) is defined as 'Huge_int + 1'.")
    print("'Huge_int' is the largest integer returned by ANY Python program that is less than 10000 characters long and eventually halts.\n")

    print("Step 3: Putting It Together")
    print("Our hypothetical program 'P' has the following properties:")
    print("  a) It's a Python program with source code less than 10000 characters.")
    print("  b) It halts and returns an integer value (the result of def_superfast(10000)).")
    
    print("\nBecause of these properties, 'P' itself is one of the programs that must be considered when calculating 'Huge_int'.\n")

    print("Step 4: The Contradiction")
    print("Let 'V' be the integer value that our program 'P' computes and returns.")
    print("From the definition in Step 2, we know that the value V must be equal to Huge_int plus 1.")
    
    print("\nHowever, since 'P' is one of the programs included in the definition of 'Huge_int', its output 'V' must be less than or equal to the maximum of all possible outputs.")
    print("Therefore, we must also have that V is less than or equal to Huge_int.")
    
    print("\nThis creates a logical impossibility. We have two conflicting statements derived from our initial assumption.\n")

    print("--- The Final Equation ---")
    print("By combining the two statements about V, we get the following contradictory equation:")
    print("Huge_int + 1 <= Huge_int")
    
    print("\nThis statement is fundamentally false. A number cannot be smaller than or equal to a value that is one less than itself.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The only way to resolve this contradiction is to reject our initial assumption from Step 1.")
    print("Therefore, our assumption that program 'P' can exist must be false. No program can compute def_superfast(10000).")
