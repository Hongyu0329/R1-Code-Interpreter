    "This is a deep question in point-set topology, specifically continuum theory. The solution relies on a significant theorem about the structure of such spaces. Here is my step-by-step plan to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terms**: First, I will break down the terms in the question: \"hereditary indecomposable metric continuum,\" \"Stone-Cech compactification,\" \"Stone-Cech remainder,\" and \"composant.\"\n2.  **Identify the Core Problem**: The goal is to determine the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Let's call the remainder $Y^*$.\n3.  **Apply a Key Theorem**: I will invoke a crucial theorem from continuum theory by H. Cook and D. P. Bellamy. This theorem states that for a hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$, the remainder $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is homeomorphic to the original space $X$.\n4.  **Connect Theorem to Solution**: Since the remainder $Y^*$ is topologically identical (homeomorphic) to $X$, it must have the same number of composants as $X$.\n5.  **State Properties of X**: By definition, any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants. The number of these composants is equal to $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum, which is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n6.  **Final Conclusion**: Because $Y^*$ has the same number of composants as $X$, the number of composants of the remainder is $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Since this result holds for any such continuum $X$, this value is the maximum possible number.\n7.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to print this explanation and then output the final answer in a symbolic equation form, printing each part of the equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the maximum number of composants\n    of the Stone-Cech remainder of a hereditary indecomposable metric\n    continuum with one point removed.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the space in question.\")\n    print(\"Let X be a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum, and let x be a point in X.\")\n    print(\"The space we are analyzing is the Stone-Cech remainder of X \\\\ {x}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Recall the decisive theorem.\")\n    print(\"A major theorem in continuum theory (by H.
