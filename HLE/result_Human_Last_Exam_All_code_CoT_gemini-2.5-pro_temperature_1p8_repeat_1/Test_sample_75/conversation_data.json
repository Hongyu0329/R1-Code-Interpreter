    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\nFirst, I will establish the start and end years of the conflict based on the official game lore. The Second Great War spans the entire StarCraft II trilogy.\n*   **Start Year:** The war begins in 2504 with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*.\n*   **End Year:** The war officially concludes in 2508 with the *Into the Void* epilogue campaign, which follows *Legacy of the Void*.\n\nNext, I will write a Python script to calculate the total duration by subtracting the start year from the end year. The script will display the years used in the calculation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_war_duration():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to lore, the war starts in 2504 with Wings of Liberty.\n    start_year = 2504\n\n    # The war concludes in 2508 with the Into the Void epilogue campaign.\n    end_year = 2508\n\n    # Calculate the duration in years.\n    duration = end_year - start_year\n\n    # Round up the result as requested. Since the duration is a whole number,\n    # rounding up does not change the value.\n    final_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n    # Print the equation with all numbers and the final answer.\n    print(f\"The Second Great War starts in the year {start_year} and ends in the year {end_year}.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\n    print(f\"The total duration of the war is {final_duration} years.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_war_duration()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
