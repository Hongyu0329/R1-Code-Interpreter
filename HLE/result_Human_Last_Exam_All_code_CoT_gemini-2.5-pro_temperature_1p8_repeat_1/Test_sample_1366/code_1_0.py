    # Part (a): Based on the theory of W-algebras (specifically principal W-algebras of sl_2),
    # the decomposition V(p) =bigoplus_{n=0}^{infty} rho_n otimes L(p)_n is a known result.
    # The decomposition of a module into a direct sum of irreducible submodules is unique.
    # Therefore, another decomposition of this form does not exist.
    answer_a = "Yes; No"

    # Part (b): The problem defines L(p)_n as the simple highest-weight module
    # "with top-level rho_n", and rho_n is defined as the "(n+1)-dimensional
    # irreducible sl_2-module". The question asks for the top-level dimension of L(p)_n.
    # From the definitions, this is directly n+1.
    answer_b = "n+1"

    # Part (c): Calculate the minimal conformal weight for p=2.
    # This is interpreted as the minimal conformal weight of a primary field
    # other than the vacuum, which corresponds to the lowest highest weight
    # Delta_n for n > 0.
    
    # Given parameters
    p = 2
    
    # Calculate the level k
    # k = -2 + 1/p
    k = -2 + 1/p
    
    # The conformal weight Delta_n of the highest-weight vector of L(p)_n is given by
    # the Sugawara construction formula: Delta_n = n(n+2) / (4*(k+2)).
    # We want the minimum of this value for n > 0 (since n=0 is the vacuum).
    # Delta_n is an increasing function for n>0, so the minimum is at n=1.
    n = 1
    
    # The equation for the minimal non-zero primary conformal weight:
    # Delta_1 = (1 * (1 + 2)) / (4 * (k + 2))
    # Let's compute the numbers:
    k_plus_2 = k + 2.0
    numerator = float(n * (n + 2))
