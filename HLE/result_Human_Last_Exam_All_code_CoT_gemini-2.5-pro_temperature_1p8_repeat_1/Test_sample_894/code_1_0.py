    Identifies and lists the San Francisco November 2024 propositions
    that could be nullified by a competing proposition.

    Based on the official Voter Information Pamphlet for the November 5, 2024,
    San Francisco election, the following competing measures have been identified:

    1. Proposition C vs. Proposition I (Real Estate Transfer Taxes): These are
       competing tax measures. The one that receives more "yes" votes will go
       into effect, and the other will be rejected (nullified). Therefore, both
       'C' and 'I' can be nullified.

    2. Proposition E vs. Proposition L (Police Department Oversight): These
       propositions present conflicting approaches to police oversight. The one
       that passes with more "yes" votes will supersede the other. Therefore,
       both 'E' and 'L' can be nullified.

    The final list of propositions that could be nullified is C, E, I, and L.
    This script will sort them alphabetically and print them in the required format.
