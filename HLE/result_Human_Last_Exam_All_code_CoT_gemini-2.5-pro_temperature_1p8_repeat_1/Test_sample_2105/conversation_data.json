    "To determine the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for the major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule:** The reduction of a disulfide (R-S-S-R) yields two thiol molecules (2 * R-SH). Therefore, the major reduction product is perylene-3-thiol (C₂₀H₁₂S).\n\n2.  **Construct the Molecular Graph:** I will construct a graph where each atom (including all 20 carbons, 1 sulfur, and 12 hydrogens) is a node and each bond is an edge. This molecular graph is derived using standard chemical informatics tools to ensure its accuracy.\n\n3.  **Calculate Wiener Index (W):** I will compute the Wiener index, which is the sum of the shortest path distances between all unique pairs of nodes in the graph.\n\n4.  **Calculate Szeged Index (Sz):** I will compute the Szeged index. For each edge `(u, v)` in the graph, this involves counting the number of nodes closer to `u` (`n_u`) and the number of nodes closer to `v` (`n_v`), and summing the product `n_u * n_v` over all edges.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Finally, I will compute the ratio of the Szeged index to the Wiener index (Sz / W).\n\nThe entire process is encapsulated in the following Python script.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef calculate_indices_and_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the Wiener and Szeged indices for the molecular graph\n    of perylene-3-thiol and computes their ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the molecular graph of perylene-3-thiol (C20H12S).\n    # The structure includes all 33 atoms (1 S, 20 C, 12 H) as nodes\n    # and all 37 chemical bonds as edges.
