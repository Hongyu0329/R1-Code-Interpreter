    explanation = """
    The best solution is N because it is the only one that comprehensively addresses all four cybersecurity requirements laid out in the problem.

    1.  **Prevents Spoofing/Replay:** The description explicitly states it safeguards against "replay attacks, biometric spoofing, and advanced adversarial AI manipulation."
    2.  **Handles Coercion:** It is the only option that makes a strong, direct claim to protect against coercion, a critical and difficult requirement.
    3.  **Resilient to Data Exposure:** It uses multiple layers of defense for data protection, including "quantum-resistant cryptography," "hardware security enclaves," "zeroization protocols," and "real-time revocation," making the system secure even if a component is compromised.
    4.  **Multi-Modal Support:** The concept of a "cryptographic module" that supports "reconfiguration of biometric credentials" is inherently designed to work with various types of biometric inputs.

    Other options are strong in one or two areas but fail to provide a complete solution. For instance, Liveness Detection (D) fails on data exposure, and Revocable Vaults (M) are less explicit on preventing coercion. Solution N describes a holistic, defense-in-depth system that meets every specified criterion.
