    "For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`. As it is an electron, its spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n\nThe total angular momentum `J` is the sum of the orbital and spin angular momenta, `J = L + S`. The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number `j` are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan series, which ranges from `|l - s|` to `l + s`.\nFor `l = 1` and `s = 1/2`, the possible `j` values are:\n`j = |1 - 1/2|, ..., 1 + 1/2`\n`j = 1/2, 3/2`\n\nFor each value of `j`, there are `2j + 1` possible values for the magnetic quantum number `m_j`, ranging from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ are given by:\n*   Eigenvalue of $J^2$ = $ħ^2 j(j+1)$\n*   Eigenvalue of $J_z$ = $ħ m_j$\n\nThe following Python script will calculate and print these eigenvalues for each possible state of the p-electron, assuming `ħ = 1` for the numerical values.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    A p-electron has orbital angular momentum l=1 and spin s=1/2.\n    \"\"\"\n    l = 1\n    s = 0.5\n\n    # Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n    j_values = [abs(l - s), l + s]\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron (l={l}, s={s}):\")\n    print(f\"The possible total angular momentum quantum numbers are j = {j_values[0]} and j = {j_values[1]}.\\n\")\n    \n    # Iterate through each possible j value in descending order\n    for j in sorted(j_values, reverse=True):\n        print(f\"--- For j = {j} ---\")\n\n        # Calculate and print the eigenvalue of J^2\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)ħ^2 = {j} * ({j} + 1)ħ^2 = {j_squared_eigenvalue}ħ^2\")\n\n        # Determine the possible m_j values for the current j\n        m_j_values = []\n        m_j = -j\n        while m_j <= j:\n            m_j_values.append(m_j)\n            m_j += 1\n        \n        print(f\"The corresponding eigenvalues of J_z for m_j from {-j} to {j} are:\")\n        # Iterate through possible m_j values and print J_z eigenvalues\n        for mj in sorted(m_j_values, reverse=True):\n            print(f\"  m_j = {mj: >4.1f}, J_z eigenvalue = {mj: >4.1f}ħ\")\n        print() # Add a newline for better separation\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n<<<For j=3/2, the J^2 eigenvalue is 3.75ħ^2 and the J_z eigenvalues are +1.5ħ, +0.5ħ, -0.5ħ, -1.5ħ.
