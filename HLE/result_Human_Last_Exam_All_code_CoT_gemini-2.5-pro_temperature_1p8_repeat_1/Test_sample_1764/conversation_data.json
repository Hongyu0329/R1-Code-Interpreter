    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will interpret the question. The question asks for the \"smallest possible number\" of isometric embeddings. This means I am free to choose any finite ultrametric space $X$ and any Banach space $B$ to find the configuration that results in the minimum number of such embeddings.\n2.  The number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...). Therefore, the absolute smallest possible number would be 0, if it is achievable.\n3.  I will demonstrate that it is indeed possible to have zero embeddings. I will do this by constructing a specific, simple example of a space $X$ and a space $B$.\n4.  For my example, I will choose $X$ to be a two-point space with a non-zero distance between the points. This is a valid finite ultrametric space. For $B$, I will choose the simplest possible Banach space: the trivial space containing only the zero vector, $B = \\{0\\}$.\n5.  Then, I will show that no function from this $X$ to this $B$ can satisfy the condition for an isometric embedding, which is that it must preserve the distance between points.\n6.  The Python code will implement this example. It will define the spaces and then systematically check all possible functions from $X$ to $B$. By showing that none of them work, it will conclude that the number of embeddings is 0 in this case. Since a number cannot be smaller than 0, this will be the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings\n    of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We will demonstrate the logic by picking a specific X and B.\n\n    # 1.
