    print("   - Observation: The bacterial count only drops in normal mice when the pathogen is missing BOTH A and B.")
    print("   - Conclusion: The host's 'xy' gene product is a defense mechanism. Pathogen virulence factors A and B have a redundant function to disable this 'xy' product.\n")

    # Step 2: The ΔC mutant
    print("2. Analysis of the ΔC mutant:")
    print(f"   - In normal mice (wtL), the ΔC pathogen resulted in {results['wtL_deltaC']} bacteria/ml.")
    print(f"   - In mice lacking gene xy (-xyL), the ΔC pathogen also resulted in {results['neg_xyL_deltaC']} bacteria/ml.")
    print("   - Observation: The bacterial count drops in BOTH mouse lines.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Virulence factor C's function is independent of the 'xy' product, as its removal impairs the pathogen regardless of the host's genotype.\n")
    
    # Step 3: Evaluate Option F
    print("3. Evaluating Answer Choice F:")
    print("   Choice F states: 'Virulence factor B deactivates the product of gene xy, and virulence factor C does not target the same host proteins as virulence factor A.'")
    print("\n   - Analyzing the first part: 'Virulence factor B deactivates the product of gene xy.'")
    print(f"     - This is TRUE. When B is present (e.g., in ΔA mutant in wtL mice), the bacteria count is high ({results['wtL_deltaA']}). This means B (and A) counteracts the defense from the xy product.")
    
    print("\n   - Analyzing the second part: 'virulence factor C does not target the same host proteins as virulence factor A.'")
    print("     - This is also TRUE. From our analysis, the target of A is the 'xy' product.")
    print("     - The target of C is something different, since its effect is seen even when the 'xy' product is absent.")
    print("     - Therefore, A and C have different targets.\n")
