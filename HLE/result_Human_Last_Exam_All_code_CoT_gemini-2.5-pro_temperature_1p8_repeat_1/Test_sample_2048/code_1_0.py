# The problem describes a sampling procedure that is impossible to execute
# due to fundamental mathematical contradictions.
#
# 1. The probability density function f(v) is defined using a function l2(v),
#    which is identically zero for all v. This is because the product in l2(v)
#    is over j >= i, which includes the case j=i, for which sinh(|v_i-v_i|/2) = sinh(0) = 0.
#    A function that is zero everywhere cannot be a valid probability density function,
#    so the random variable 'v' cannot be sampled.
#
# 2. Since 'v' cannot be sampled, the subsequent random variable 'z' cannot be generated.
#
# 3. We are asked to calculate l(k) = p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1, where p_k and d_k are the
#    PDF and differential entropy of z, respectively.
#
# 4. As 'z' cannot be produced, its probability distribution p_k(z) is effectively zero
#    for all z. Therefore, p_k(1) = 0.
#
# 5. The differential entropy, d_k = -integral(p_k(z) * log(p_k(z)) dz), also evaluates to 0,
#    as the integrand is zero everywhere (using the convention that lim x->0 of x*log(x) is 0).
#
# 6. Substituting these values into the expression for l(k):
#    l(k) = 0 + 2 * 0 - 1 = -1.
#
# The value is a constant, as suggested by the framing of the question.

l_k = 0 + 2 * 0 - 1
