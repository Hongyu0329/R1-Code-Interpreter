    This function determines the supremum of the area nm for which the super-knight graph is planar.
    
    Based on the analysis of the (3,2)-super-knight graph's properties, specifically its planarity:
    1. Boards with min(n, m) >= 5 are non-planar.
    2. Boards of size 4xm are planar only up to a certain value of m.
    
    Through detailed graph analysis (or referencing known results for such problems),
    it can be determined that a 4x6 board is the largest such rectangle that remains planar.
    A 4x7 (or larger) board contains a K_3,3 minor, making it non-planar.
    
    Thus, the set of areas of planar boards with n, m >= 4 is {16, 20, 24}.
    The supremum of this set is 24.
