    "To find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we can use a known result from algebraic graph theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the type of graph:** The graph in question is $K_{1000,1000}$, which is a complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ with $m=1000$ and $n=1000$.\n2.  **Recall the formula for the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{m,n}$:** For a complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$, the Alon-Tarsi number, denoted $AT(K_{m,n})$, is given by the well-established formula:\n    $$AT(K_{m,n}) = \\min(m, n) + 1$$\n3.  **Apply the formula to the specific case:** Substitute $m=1000$ and $n=1000$ into the formula.\n4.  **Calculate the result:** Compute $\\min(1000, 1000) + 1$.\n5.  **Write the code:** Create a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation and the result.\n\nThe Python code will define the values for $m$ and $n$, calculate the Alon-Tarsi number using the formula, and then print the step-by-step calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters for the complete bipartite graph K_{m,n}\nm = 1000\nn = 1000\n\n# The Alon-Tarsi number for a complete bipartite graph K_{m,n} is given by the formula min(m, n) + 1.\n# We apply this formula to K_{1000,1000}.\n\n# Calculate the minimum of m and n\nmin_val = min(m, n)\n\n# Calculate the Alon-Tarsi number\nalon_tarsi_number = min_val + 1\n\n# Print the details of the calculation, showing each number in the equation.\nprint(f\"To find the Alon-Tarsi number of K_{{{m},{n}}}, we use the formula AT(K_m,n) = min(m, n) + 1.\")\nprint(f\"Substituting the values m = {m} and n = {n}:\")\nprint(f\"AT(K_{{{m},{n}}}) = min({m}, {n}) + 1 = {min_val} + 1 = {alon_tarsi_number}\")\n```\n<<<1001>>>"
