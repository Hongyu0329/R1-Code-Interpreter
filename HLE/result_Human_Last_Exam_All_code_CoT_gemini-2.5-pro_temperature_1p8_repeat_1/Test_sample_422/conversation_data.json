    "The JTB (Justified True Belief) model of knowledge presents a straightforward definition, but it encounters significant philosophical issues beyond the famous Gettier problems. My plan is to outline two such problems by treating them as distinct points of failure in the model. I will write a Python script that uses a multiline string to clearly print and explain these two issues.\n\n1.  **The Justification Threshold Problem:** I will address the inherent vagueness of the \"Justification\" condition. The model doesn't specify what quality or quantity of evidence is sufficient to count as justification, making the standard for knowledge arbitrary.\n2.  **The Problem of Fallible Justification:** I will focus on the fact that justification and truth are independent conditions. This means one can have a very strong, rational justification for a belief that happens to be true by luck (a different kind of luck than in Gettier cases), yet we would be hesitant to call it \"knowledge\". The lottery paradox is a perfect illustration of this issue.\n\nThe final script will print this analysis clearly.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains two problems with the JTB definition of knowledge,\n    excluding Gettier problems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nIgnoring Gettier problems, the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge runs into several core issues. Here are two prominent ones:\n\n1. The Justification Threshold Problem:\nThe JTB model requires a belief to be \"justified,\" but it fails to define a clear standard or threshold for what counts as sufficient justification. How much evidence is required for a belief to be considered justified enough for knowledge? For example, is a strong hunch enough? Is a statistical probability of 99.9% enough? Without a non-arbitrary standard, the \"J\" in JTB is too vague to be consistently applied. This makes the boundary between a 'strongly held belief' and 'knowledge' blurry and subjective.\n\n2. The Problem of Fallible Justification (or Epistemic Luck):\nThe JTB model treats justification and truth as completely independent conditions. This means a belief can be both justified and true purely by coincidence. Consider the lottery paradox: You hold a ticket with a one-in-a-million chance of winning. You are highly justified in believing \"My ticket will lose.\" In the vast majority of cases where you do lose, your belief was justified and true. According to JTB, you would have *known* you were going to lose. However, this seems wrong; we don't think we can have knowledge of a future random event, even if our belief is rational and turns out to be correct. The justification, while strong, is fallible and not connected to the truth in a guaranteed way, meaning the knowledge is ultimately a matter of luck.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nexplain_jtb_problems()\n```\n<<<\nIgnoring Gettier problems, the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge runs into several core issues.
