    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Analyze the basis set (6-31G):**\n    *   This is a split-valence basis set.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** It has only valence electrons (1s). The basis set splits this into two functions: an inner part represented by one contracted function (from 3 primitives) and an outer part represented by one contracted function (from 1 primitive). Total for H = 2 functions.\n    *   **For Carbon (C):** It has core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) electrons.\n        *   **Core (1s):** Represented by a single contracted function (from 6 primitives).\n        *   **Valence (2s, 2p):** Split into two sets. The inner set has one s-function and a set of p-functions (px, py, pz), for a total of 1+3=4 functions. The outer set also has one s-function and one set of p-functions, for another 1+3=4 functions.\n        *   Total for C = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** We multiply the number of each type of atom by the number of functions it has in this basis set and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom in the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 core (1s) + 4 inner valence (2s, 2p) + 4 outer valence (2s', 2p') = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1 inner valence (1s) + 1 outer valence (1s') = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from each element\ntotal_carbon_functions = num_carbon * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_hydrogen_functions = num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_carbon_functions + total_hydrogen_functions\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final answer\nprint(f\"Molecule: Toluene (C{num_carbon}H{num_hydrogen})\")\nprint(f\"Basis Set: 6-31G\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Number of functions per Carbon atom: {functions_per_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Number of functions per Hydrogen atom: {functions_per_hydrogen}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Total functions = (Number of C atoms * Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms * Functions per H)\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = ({num_carbon} * {functions_per_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen} * {functions_per_hydrogen})\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = {total_carbon_functions} + {total_hydrogen_functions}\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
