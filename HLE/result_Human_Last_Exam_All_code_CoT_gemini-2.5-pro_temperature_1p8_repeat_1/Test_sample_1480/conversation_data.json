    "To calculate the rule activation level for a fuzzy rule, we need to combine the membership degrees of its antecedent parts using a t-norm operation. A t-norm represents a fuzzy logic AND. The question provides two values, `Phi_k(x′)=0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. In this context, we'll interpret these as the membership values of two different conditions in the \"IF\" part of a single rule that need to be combined.\n\nWhile the problem mentions an \"interval type-3 fuzzy set,\" which involves highly complex, multi-level membership functions, the provided values are simple scalars. This implies we are to demonstrate the fundamental t-norm operation that would be a core component of the more complex calculation.\n\nThere are several types of t-norms. The most common one, which we will use here, is the **Minimum** t-norm. The rule activation level will be the minimum of the given membership values.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define two variables for the given membership values, 0.7 and 0.9.\n2.  Use the `min()` function to calculate the t-norm, representing the rule activation level.\n3.  Print the result in a sentence that shows the full calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the membership values from the rule's antecedents.\n# Phi_k(x') can be interpreted as the membership value for the first condition.\nval1 = 0.7\n# muG_k_j(y_j) can be interpreted as the membership value for the second condition.\nval2 = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is used to combine the membership values for a fuzzy 'AND' operation.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\n# We calculate the rule activation level by taking the minimum of the two values.\nactivation_level = min(val1, val2)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(f\"Using the Minimum t-norm, the rule activation level is: min({val1}, {val2}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
