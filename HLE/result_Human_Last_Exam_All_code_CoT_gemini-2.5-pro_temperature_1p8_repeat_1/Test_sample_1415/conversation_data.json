    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` is a standard form. If we let `u = F₃(x)`, then `du = F₃'(x) dx`. The integral becomes `∫ (1/u) du`, which evaluates to `ln|u|` or `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1. This equals `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`. Using logarithm properties, this simplifies to `ln(|F₃(1)| / |F₃(0)|)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)`\n    *   `F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Value V:** The value of the integral `V` is `ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))`.\n    *   `V = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) )`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The final task is to find the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n\n7.  **Python Implementation:** The plan will be implemented in a Python script that defines the functions, calculates `F₃(0)` and `F₃(1)`, computes `V`, and then finds the closest integer to `10000 * V`. The script will print the steps of the final calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the integral problem and reports the final value.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the functions as per the problem description\n    def F0(x):\n        return x\n\n    def F1(x):\n        return math.sin(F0(x))\n\n    def F2(x):\n        return math.exp(F1(x))\n\n    def F3(x):\n        # We need to handle potential math domain errors for ln, although not an issue on [0,1]\n        arg = 1 + F2(x)\n        if arg <= 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Domain error: log of non-positive number.\")\n        return math.log(arg)\n\n    # The integral of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln|F₃(x)|.\n    # For x in [0, 1], sin(x) >= 0, so e^sin(x) > 0, 1+e^sin(x) > 1, and F₃(x) = ln(1+e^sin(x)) > 0.\n    # Thus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0)).\n    \n    # Calculate values at the boundaries\n    f3_at_0 = F3(0)\n    f3_at_1 = F3(1)\n\n    # Calculate V, the value of the integral\n    V = math.log(f3_at_1 / f3_at_0)\n\n    # The problem asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V\n    final_value = 10000 * V\n    closest_integer = round(final_value)\n    \n    # --- Output Section ---\n    print(\"The integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx evaluates to ln|F₃(x)|.\")\n    print(\"The definite integral from 0 to 1 is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0)).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)\")\n    print(f\"F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(2) ≈ {f3_at_0}\")\n    print(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ {f3_at_1}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate V\")\n    print(f\"V = ln({f3_at_1} / {f3_at_0})\")\n    print(f\"V ≈ {V}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the final requested value\")\n    print(f\"The value is the closest integer to 10000 * V.\")\n    print(f\"10000 * V ≈ 10000 * {V} = {final_value}\")\n    print(f\"The closest integer is: {closest_integer}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<5489>>>\n```"
