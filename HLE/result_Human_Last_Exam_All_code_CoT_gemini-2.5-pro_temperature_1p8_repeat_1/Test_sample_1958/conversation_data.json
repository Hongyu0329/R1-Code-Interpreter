    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to find the first book of the Bible mentioned in Shakespeare's plays:\n\n1.  **Define the Corpus**: First, I need a data source. I will programmatically download the complete works of William Shakespeare from the Project Gutenberg text file.\n2.  **Establish Canonical Order**: I will create an ordered list of the books of the Bible, starting with the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, etc.), as the first mentioned book is certain to be from this section.\n3.  **Isolate Play Titles**: I'll parse the downloaded text to identify all the play titles and their locations within the document. Shakespeare's plays in this file are typically preceded by several newlines and are written in all-caps, which allows for reliable extraction using regular expressions.\n4.  **Search and Identify**: I will iterate through the list of Bible books in canonical order. For each book, I will search the entire text of Shakespeare's works.\n5.  **Locate and Report**: The first time a match is found, the script will stop. It will then identify which play the match belongs to by finding the last play title that appeared before the matched Bible book name. Finally, it will print the name of the Bible book and the corresponding play.\n\nThis step-by-step process ensures we find the very first book according to the Bible's canonical order and correctly attribute it to the right play.\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport requests\n\ndef find_first_bible_book_in_shakespeare():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name\n    in Shakespeare's complete works and identifies the play.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of the books of the Old Testament in canonical order.\n    # We only need to go far enough to find the first match.\n    BIBLE_BOOKS_OT = [\n        \"Genesis\", \"Exodus\", \"Leviticus\", \"Numbers\", \"Deuteronomy\",\n        \"Joshua\", \"Judges\", \"Ruth\", \"Samuel\", \"Kings\", \"Chronicles\",\n        \"Ezra\", \"Nehemiah\", \"Esther\", \"Job\", \"Psalms\", \"Proverbs\",\n        \"Ecclesiastes\", \"Song of Solomon\", \"Isaiah\", \"Jeremiah\",\n        \"Lamentations\", \"Ezekiel\", \"Daniel\", \"Hosea\", \"Joel\", \"Amos\",\n        \"Obadiah\", \"Jonah\", \"Micah\", \"Nahum\", \"Habakkuk\", \"Zephaniah\",\n        \"Haggai\", \"Zechariah\", \"Malachi\"\n    ]\n\n    # URL for the plain text of Shakespeare's complete works\n    url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/100/100-0.txt\"\n    \n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        # Raise an HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        text = response.text\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to download Shakespeare's works.
