    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the Python code to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization:** The first step is to find the prime factorization of the conductor $N = 36036$.\n2.  **Character Decomposition:** According to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ for each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$.\n    - $\\chi = \\prod_{p^a || N} \\chi_{p^a}$\n    - The character $\\chi$ is primitive with conductor $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ is primitive with conductor $p^a$.\n    - The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters.\n3.  **Analyze Each Component:** For each prime power factor $p^a$, we will:\n    a. Determine the structure of the character group modulo $p^a$, which is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^a\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n    b. Identify the conditions for a character $\\chi_{p^a}$ to be primitive.\n    c. Count the number of such primitive characters whose order divides the required order, which is 6.\n4.  **Combine the Results:**\n    a. We'll verify that for any valid combination of component characters, the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n    b. The total number of characters is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n    c. The final python code will automate this calculation and print out the reasoning.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan with the code.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef prime_factorize(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the prime factorization of a number n.\"\"\"\n    factors = defaultdict(int)\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] += 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] += 1\n    return dict(factors)\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor N and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    ORDER = 6\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order {ORDER}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 1: Prime factorization of N\n    factors = prime_factorize(N)\n    factor_str = \" * \".join([f\"{p}^{a}\" if a > 1 else str(p) for p, a in sorted(factors.items())])\n    print(\"Step 1: Prime factorize the conductor N.\")\n    print(f\"N = {N} = {factor_str}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 2: Character decomposition\n    print(\"Step 2: Decompose the character based on the factorization of N.\")\n    print(\"A character chi mod N can be uniquely written as a product of characters: chi = chi_4 * chi_9 * chi_7 * chi_11 * chi_13.\")\n    print(\"chi is primitive with conductor N if and only if each component chi_p^a is primitive.\")\n    print(f\"The order of chi, lcm(ord(chi_4), ord(chi_9), ...), must be {ORDER}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    # Step 3: Analyze each component\n    print(\"Step 3: Count the valid primitive characters for each prime power factor.\")\n    \n    num_choices = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through prime factors p^a of N\n    for p, a in sorted(factors.items()):\n        m = p**a\n        \n        # Determine the structure of the character group\n        group_order = phi(m)\n        \n        primitive_orders_info = []\n        count = 0\n\n        # Check all possible orders 'd' that a character in this group can have.\n        for d in range(1, group_order + 1):\n            if group_order % d == 0: # 'd' must divide the group order\n                # Condition 1: The order 'd' of the component must divide the target order\n                if ORDER % d == 0:\n                    is_primitive = False\n                    # Condition 2: The character must be primitive for its modulus\n                    if a == 1: # For p^1, primitive means not the principal character (order > 1)\n                        if d > 1:\n                            is_primitive = True\n                    elif p == 2 and a == 2: # For 2^2=4, primitive means not principal (order > 1)\n                        if d > 1:\n                            is_primitive = True\n                    elif p%2 == 1 and a > 1: # For p^a, p odd, primitive means order 'd' does not divide phi(p^(a-1))\n                        if phi(p**(a-1)) % d != 0:\n                           is_primitive = True\n\n                    if is_primitive:\n                        # Number of elements of order d in a cyclic group is phi(d)\n                        num_d = phi(d)\n                        primitive_orders_info.append(f\"{num_d} of order {d}\")\n                        count += num_d\n        \n        num_choices[m] = count\n        \n        print(f\"For modulus {m} = {p}^{a}:\")\n        print(f\"  - The character group is cyclic of order phi({m}) = {group_order}.\")\n        print(f\"  - We need primitive characters whose order divides {ORDER}.\")\n        if primitive_orders_info:\n            print(f\"  - Available primitive characters: {' and '.join(primitive_orders_info)}.\")\n            print(f\"  - Total choices for mod {m}: {count}.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"  - No such characters exist.\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    # Step 4: Final calculation\n    print(\"Step 4: Combine the results.\")\n    print(\"The order of the final character is the lcm of the component orders.\")\n    print(f\"For the final order to be {ORDER}, the lcm must be a multiple of 2 and 3, and all component orders must divide {ORDER}.\")\n    print(\" - The character mod 4 must have order 2.
