    Solves the problem based on logical deduction.

    The problem statement has multiple inconsistencies that make direct computation infeasible.
    These include:
    1. A non-symmetric matrix M for which Cholesky decomposition is requested.
    2. A probability density function l_2 that appears to be identically zero due to the product including j=i.
    3. A bizarre definition for the sampling PDF f(v) that uses scalar inputs for functions defined on vectors.

    This suggests the problem is a puzzle solvable by logic rather than computation.
    The problem asks for "the value of l(a,b,c,d)", implying the function is constant over its domain.
    We can find this constant by choosing a convenient point, for instance, c = d.

    If c = d, then X_1(a,c) and X_2(a,d) are identical matrices.
    l(a,b,c,c) = ln(p_ab[X_1(a,c)] / p_ab[X_2(a,c)])
                 = ln(p_ab[X_1(a,c)] / p_ab[X_1(a,c)])
                 = ln(1)
                 = 0

    Assuming l(a,b,c,d) is a constant, its value must be 0.
