    "The question you're asking is at the heart of the philosophy of language and thought, and Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint (GC) provides a powerful framework for answering it.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Generality Constraint:** First, I'll explain the core idea of the GC. It posits that thought is structured and systematic. If you can think \"a is F\" and \"b is G\", you must also have the ability to think \"a is G\" and \"b is F\". Your concepts (like 'a', 'b', 'F', 'G') are recombinable.\n2.  **Analyze the Components:**\n    *   Understanding `Fa` (\"a has the property F\") means you possess the concept of the individual `a` and the concept of the predicate `F`.\n    *   Understanding `∀x Fx` (\"For all x, x has the property F\") requires the concept of the predicate `F` and the concept of universal quantification (`∀`).\n3.  **Synthesize the Answer:** The user's premise is crucial: \"Assume I understand universal quantification.\" The Generality Constraint is about the ability to deploy a concept (like the predicate `F`) in any context for which you have the other required conceptual tools. Since you have the concept `F` (from understanding `Fa`) and you are assumed to have the concept of universal quantification (`∀`), you possess all the necessary components. Therefore, you should be able to combine them to understand the proposition `∀x Fx`. The answer is **yes**.\n4.  **Represent in Code:** I will write a Python script to model this process symbolically.\n    *   It will start with the proposition `F(a)`.\n    *   It will \"extract\" the predicate `F` as the understood concept.\n    *   It will then take the pre-existing concept of the universal quantifier `∀`.\n    *   Finally, it will combine the predicate `F` with the quantifier `∀` to construct and print the new proposition `∀x F(x)`. This demonstrates the recombination principle at the heart of the GC.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_generality_constraint():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script models the application of Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint\n    to move from understanding a singular proposition to a universal one.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
