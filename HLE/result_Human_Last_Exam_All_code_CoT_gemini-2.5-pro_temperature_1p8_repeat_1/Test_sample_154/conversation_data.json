    "To solve this problem, I will write a Python script to systematically find and count all the 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the search space:** A simple graph with 5 vertices can have between 0 and 10 edges. However, a 2-vertex-connected graph with 5 vertices must have at least 5 edges (forming a cycle, C5) and at most 10 edges (the complete graph, K5).\n2.  **Generate candidate graphs:** I will iterate through all possible numbers of edges, `m`, from 5 to 10. For each `m`, I will generate all possible graphs with 5 vertices and `m` edges.\n3.  **Filter for 2-vertex-connectivity:** For each generated graph, I will use the `networkx` library to check if it's 2-vertex-connected. A graph is k-vertex-connected if it cannot be disconnected by removing fewer than `k` vertices.\n4.  **Filter for non-isomorphic graphs:** To ensure we count each unique graph structure only once, I will maintain a list of the 2-connected graphs found so far. For each new 2-connected graph, I will check if it is isomorphic to any graph already in the list. If it is not, I will add it to the list and count it.\n5.  **Calculate and display the result:** After checking all possibilities, I will sum the counts of unique graphs found for each number of edges. I will print the breakdown of this calculation, showing the number of graphs for each edge count, followed by the final sum, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport itertools\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_biconnected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected \n    simple graphs with a specified number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 5\n    nodes = range(n)\n\n    # A simple graph with n vertices can have at most n*(n-1)/2 edges.\n    # A 2-vertex-connected graph with n vertices must have at least n edges.\n    all_possible_edges = list(itertools.combinations(nodes, 2))\n    min_edges = n\n    max_edges = len(all_possible_edges)\n\n    # This list will store the unique (non-isomorphic) graphs we find.\n    found_graphs = []\n    \n    # This dictionary will store the count of unique graphs per number of edges.\n    count_per_edges = defaultdict(int)\n\n    # Iterate through all possible numbers of edges for a 2-connected graph.\n    for m in range(min_edges, max_edges + 1):\n        # Generate all possible combinations of edges for the current size 'm'.\n        for edges in itertools.combinations(all_possible_edges, m):\n            G = nx.Graph()\n            G.add_nodes_from(nodes)\n            G.add_edges_from(edges)\n\n            # A graph must be connected to be 2-vertex-connected.\n            # This is a quick preliminary check that speeds up the process.\n            if not nx.is_connected(G):\n                continue\n            \n            # Check for 2-vertex-connectivity.
