    "Of course. The ideal Ni/Ce ratio in a catalyst is not a single, universally fixed value but is determined experimentally. It represents a trade-off between having enough active Nickel sites and maintaining high dispersion (i.e., preventing Ni particles from clumping together), which maximizes the synergistic effect with the Ceria support.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Acknowledge that the \"ideal ratio\" is based on experimental findings from scientific literature, not a theoretical calculation I can perform from scratch.\n2.  Provide the typical ranges found to be effective for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting. For these reactions, the performance is often reported based on the weight percent (wt%) of Nickel.\n3.  Create a Python script to present this information clearly.\n4.  The script will also include a function to convert the commonly cited weight percent (wt%) values into the more fundamental atomic (molar) Ni/Ce ratio, showing the calculation steps. This will fulfill the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation.\"\n5.  The script will then print a summary of the optimal ranges and key considerations for each reaction.\n\nHere is the Python script to present the findings:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_atomic_ratio(ni_wt_percent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the atomic Ni/Ce ratio from the weight percent of Ni\n    in a Ni-CeO2 catalyst.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Molar masses (g/mol)\n    m_ni = 58.69\n    m_ce = 140.12\n    m_o = 16.00\n    m_ceo2 = m_ce + 2 * m_o\n\n    if not 0 < ni_wt_percent < 100:\n        return None, None, None, None\n\n    # In a 100g sample:\n    mass_ni = ni_wt_percent\n    mass_ceo2 = 100 - ni_wt_percent\n\n    # Moles of each component\n    moles_ni = mass_ni / m_ni\n    moles_ceo2 = mass_ceo2 / m_ceo2\n    # Moles of Ce are equal to moles of CeO2\n    moles_ce = moles_ceo2\n\n    # Atomic ratio\n    atomic_ratio = moles_ni / moles_ce\n\n    return moles_ni, moles_ce, atomic_ratio, mass_ni\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to display catalyst information.\n    \"\"\"\n    catalyst_info = collections.OrderedDict()\n\n    catalyst_info[\"Water Gas Shift (WGS)\"] = {\n        \"Optimal Ni (wt%) Range\": \"5-15%\",\n        \"Representative wt% for calculation\": 10,\n        \"Key Considerations\": \"Lower Ni content is often preferred to ensure high Ni dispersion, prevent sintering at high temperatures, and minimize side reactions like methanation.\"\n    }\n\n    catalyst_info[\"Water Splitting (WS)\"] = {\n        \"Optimal Ni (wt%) Range\": \"10-20%\",\n        \"Representative wt% for calculation\": 15,\n        \"Key Considerations\": \"A balance is needed to provide sufficient active sites while maintaining stability and strong metal-support interaction during thermochemical cycles.\"\n    }\n    \n    print(\"--- Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio for Ni-Ceria Nanoparticle Catalysts ---\\n\")\n    print(\"The ideal ratio is determined experimentally.
