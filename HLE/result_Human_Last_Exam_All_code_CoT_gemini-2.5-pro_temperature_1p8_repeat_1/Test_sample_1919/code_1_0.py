    This function counts the number of subsets S of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
    for which the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem is NP-hard.

    According to Schaefer's Dichotomy Theorem, the problem is in P if
    the constraint is 0-valid, 1-valid, or affine. Otherwise, it is NP-hard.

    - 0-valid condition: 0 must be in S.
    - 1-valid condition: 4 must be in S.
    - Affine condition: S must be one of the specific sets that define an
      affine--with-respect-to-GF(2) relation.
    
    The code iterates through all 32 subsets S and counts how many are
    not 0-valid, not 1-valid, and not affine.
