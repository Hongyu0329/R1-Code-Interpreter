    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in $\\phi^4$ theory, we will use the Renormalization Group (RG) framework in $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ dimensions.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will start with the well-established one-loop beta function, $\\beta(u)$, for the dimensionless coupling constant `u` of the $\\phi^4$ theory. This function describes how the coupling `u` 'runs' with changes in the energy scale.\n2.  A fixed point, denoted as $u^*$, is a specific value of the coupling where the theory becomes scale-invariant. This occurs when the beta function is equal to zero, i.e., $\\beta(u^*)=0$.\n3.  I will set up the equation $\\beta(u^*)=0$ and algebraically solve for the non-trivial fixed point $u^*$ (the one where $u \\neq 0$). This specific point is known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n4.  The Python script below will carry out these steps, printing each stage of the derivation, including the initial beta function, the equation for the fixed point, and the final expression for $u^*$ in terms of $\\epsilon$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_phi4_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher\n    fixed point in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program finds the leading order expression for the non-trivial (Wilson-Fisher) fixed point coupling u*\")\n    print(\"in phi^4 theory in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The one-loop beta function\")\n    print(\"The Renormalization Group (RG) beta function for the dimensionless coupling u, to one-loop order, is:\")\n    \n    # In standard field theory conventions (e.g., Peskin & Schroeder), the coefficient is 3/(16*pi^2).\n    # The '3' comes from the combinatorics of the one-loop Feynman diagram.\n    B_numerator = 3\n    B_denominator_str = \"16 * pi^2\"\n    print(f\"   β(u) = -ε*u + ({B_numerator} / {B_denominator_str}) * u^2\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Finding the fixed point\")\n    print(\"A fixed point u* is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero (β(u*) = 0).\")\n    print(\"At this point, the theory is scale-invariant.\")\n    print(\"Setting β(u*) = 0 gives the equation:\\n\")\n    print(f\"   -ε*u* + ({B_numerator} / {B_denominator_str}) * (u*)^2 = 0\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Solving the equation\")\n    print(\"We can factor the equation to find the possible solutions:\")\n    print(f\"   u* * [-ε + ({B_numerator} / {B_denominator_str}) * u*] = 0\\n\")\n    print(\"This equation reveals two fixed points:\")\n    print(\"   - The Gaussian fixed point: u* = 0 (which is unstable)\")\n    print(\"   - The non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, found by setting the term in the brackets to zero.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Deriving the Wilson-Fisher fixed point\")\n    print(\"Solving for the non-trivial fixed point:\")\n    print(f\"   -ε + ({B_numerator} / {B_denominator_str}) * u* = 0\")\n    print(f\"   ({B_numerator} / {B_denominator_str}) * u* = ε\")\n    print(f\"   u* = ({B_denominator_str} / {B_numerator}) * ε\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Final Answer: The leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling is:\")\n    \n    # Display the final equation with all its numerical components\n    final_coeff_num_str = \"16 * pi^2\"\n    final_coeff_den = 3\n    print(f\"   u* = ( {final_coeff_num_str} / {final_coeff_den} ) * ε\")\n\n# Run the function to display the derivation\nsolve_phi4_fixed_point()\n```\n<<<u* = (16 * pi^2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
