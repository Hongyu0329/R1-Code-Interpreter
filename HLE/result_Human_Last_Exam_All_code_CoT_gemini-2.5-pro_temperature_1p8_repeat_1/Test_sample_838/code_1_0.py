    explanation1 = "The starting material, [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene (IUPAC name: (S)-2-bromo-4-phenylbutane), is a secondary alkyl halide. It is treated with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically bulky base, in a 60/40 cyclohexane/diethyl ether mixture. These conditions favor an E2 elimination reaction. Due to the large size of the base, it preferentially removes a proton from the more accessible, less sterically hindered position (the terminal methyl group), following the Hofmann rule."

This reaction results in the anti-Markovnikov addition of water across the double bond."

Although the starting material was chiral, the first step of the synthesis was an elimination reaction that formed a flat C=C double bond, which destroyed the molecule's only chiral center. Since no new chiral centers were generated in the subsequent steps, the final product is not chiral."
