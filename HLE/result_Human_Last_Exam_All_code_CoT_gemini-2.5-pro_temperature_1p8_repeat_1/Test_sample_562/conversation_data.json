    "My plan is to first identify the radical for the kanji character 謄.\n1.  Deconstruct the kanji 謄 into its components. It is composed of a left part and a right part.\n2.  The left part is 月 and the right part is 朕. In kanji structure, the left-hand component is very often the radical.\n3.  The radical is therefore 月. When 月 appears as a radical on the left side of a character (a `hen`), it is called にくづき (nikuzuki), which means \"meat radical\". It is distinct from the moon radical (tsuki).\n4.  The Hepburn romanization for にくづき is \"Nikuzuki\".\n5.  I will write a Python script that stores this information in a dictionary and prints it out to answer the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name(character):\n    \"\"\"\n    Looks up the radical for a given Kanji character from a predefined dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji_database = {\n        '謄': {\n            'radical_char': '月',\n            'hepburn_name': 'Nikuzuki',\n            'description': 'When the radical 月 is on the left side, it is known as にくづき (nikuzuki).'\n        },\n        '媛': {\n            'radical_char': '女',\n            'hepburn_name': 'Onnahen',\n            'description': 'The radical 女 (woman) on the left side.'\n        }\n    }\n\n    if character in kanji_database:\n        info = kanji_database[character]\n        radical_char = info['radical_char']\n        hepburn_name = info['hepburn_name']\n        print(f\"The bushu (radical) in the character '{character}' is '{radical_char}'.\")\n        print(f\"The Hepburn transcription of its name is: {hepburn_name}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Information for the character '{character}' was not found.\")\n\n# The character we are analyzing\ntarget_kanji = '謄'\nfind_radical_name(target_kanji)\n```\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
