    This script solves the Drosophila development problem by applying

    # --- Rule definitions based on the problem statement ---
    # Rule 1: A diet of 250mg/L cholesterol supports normal development and reproduction.
    # Rule 2: A diet of 2mg/L cholesterol is insufficient for larvae to survive to adulthood.
    # Rule 3: A diet of 250mg/L cholestanol is lethal (adult survival is zero).

    # --- Scenario 1 Analysis ---
    # Question: What will happen to Drosophila fed on a diet of 250mg/L cholestanol
    # when raised from eggs from mothers that were reared on 250mg/L cholesterol?
    
    # Mother's Diet: 250mg/L cholesterol. This is a healthy diet.
    # Implication: The mother is healthy and can provision her eggs with enough cholesterol
    # for early development.
    maternal_provisioning_1 = "Sufficient"
    
    # Offspring's Diet: 250mg/L cholestanol.
    # Implication: This diet is lethal because cholestanol cannot be used to make the
    # molting hormone, Ecdysone. The larvae will use up their maternal cholesterol
    # stores but will then be unable to molt and develop further. They will not reach adulthood.

    # Question: What will happen to Drosophila fed on a diet of 250mg/L cholestanol and 2mg/L cholesterol
    # when raised from eggs from mothers that were reared on 250mg/L cholestanol?

    # Mother's Diet: 250mg/L cholestanol. This is a lethal diet.
    # Implication: The mother cannot survive and reproduce successfully. Her eggs will lack
    # the necessary cholesterol stores for development.
    maternal_provisioning_2 = "Deficient"

    # Offspring's Diet: 2mg/L cholesterol + 250mg/L cholestanol.
    # Implication: The diet itself contains an insufficient amount of cholesterol (2mg/L), which
    # is explicitly stated to be unable to support survival to adulthood. With no maternal stores
    # to provide a buffer, the larvae will not be able to develop.
    outcome_2 = "Death"
