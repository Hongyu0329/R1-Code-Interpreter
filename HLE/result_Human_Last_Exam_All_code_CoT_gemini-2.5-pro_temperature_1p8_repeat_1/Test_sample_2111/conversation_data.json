    "Based on Fernand Braudel's writings, particularly in *The Perspective of the World*, he quotes Paul Morand to argue for a particular approach to a field of study. Morand asserted that this entity, such as the history of a great nation, should not be viewed in isolation but must be understood within the broader context of the world, which he metaphorically describes as a sphere. The entity being discussed is history itself.\n\n<<<History>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
