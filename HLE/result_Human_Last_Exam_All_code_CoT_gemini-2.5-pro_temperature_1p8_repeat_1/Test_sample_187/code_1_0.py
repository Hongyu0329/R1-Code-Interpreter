  Identifies and returns a list of lines with errors in the triangle.py file.
  
  The errors are identified based on the specification that the code should use
  precise (non-floating point) SageMath arithmetic, but the code is written with
  standard Python syntax that violates this specification.
  
  - Line 1: Imports a numerical `sqrt` function instead of a symbolic one.
  - Line 11: Uses `^` (XOR) for exponentiation instead of `**`.
  - Line 18: Uses `/` (float division) which breaks precise arithmetic.
  - Lines 22, 23: Use `/` (float division) instead of exact rational division.
  - Lines 29, 30, 31: Use `^` (XOR) for exponentiation.
