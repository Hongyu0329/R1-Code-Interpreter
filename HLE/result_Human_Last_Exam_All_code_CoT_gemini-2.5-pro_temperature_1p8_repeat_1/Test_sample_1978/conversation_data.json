    "To find the index of the boundary-value problem, we need to calculate the difference between the dimension of the system of differential equations (n) and the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k).\n\n**1. Determine the dimension of the system (n):**\nThe problem is described by the state vector $x(t) = (x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), x_{3}(t), ..., x_{2024}(t))$. This vector has 2024 components, which means the system consists of 2024 first-order differential equations. The dimensions of the matrix A and vector I appear to contain typos and the true dimension of the system is determined by the state vector x(t).\nTherefore, **n = 2024**.\n\n**2. Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k):**\nThe given boundary conditions are:\n1.  $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$\n2.  $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n3.  $5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0$\n4.  $100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0$\n5.  $1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0$\n6.  $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0$\n\nLet's simplify these conditions:\n- Condition 1 is unique: $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$.\n- Condition 2 is a base condition: $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$.\n- Condition 3 is $5 \\times (x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$, which is the same as condition 2.\n- Condition 4 is $100 \\times (x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$, which is the same as condition 2.\n- Condition 5 is $-1000 \\times (x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$, which is also the same as condition 2.\n- Condition 6 is $100 \\times (x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0)) = 0$, which simplifies to $x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0$.\n\nThe conditions concerning $x_2$ are all multiples of each other, meaning they are linearly dependent. We only count the unique constraints. Thus, we have three linearly independent boundary conditions, one for each of $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_{2024}$.\nTherefore, **k = 3**.\n\n**3. Calculate the index:**\nThe index of the problem is given by the formula: `Index = n - k`.\nIndex = 2024 - 3 = 2021.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_problem_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the index of the described boundary-value problem.\n\n    The index of a boundary-value problem is n - k, where:\n    n: the dimension of the system of differential equations.\n    k: the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # n is the dimension of the system, which is the number of components in x(t).\n    # x(t) = (x1(t), ..., x2024(t)), so n = 2024.\n    n = 2024\n\n    # k is the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n    # The given conditions are:\n    # 1. x1(T) - x1(0) = 0\n    # 2. x2(T) - x2(0) = 0\n    # 3. 5*(x2(T) - x2(0)) = 0  (dependent on 2)\n    # 4. 100*(x2(T) - x2(0)) = 0 (dependent on 2)\n    # 5. -1000*(x2(T) - x2(0)) = 0 (dependent on 2)\n    # 6. 100*(x2024(T) - x2024(0)) = 0 => x2024(T) - x2024(0) = 0\n    # The unique, linearly independent conditions are on x1, x2, and x2024.\n    # So, k = 3.\n    k = 3\n\n    # Calculate the index.\n    index = n - k\n\n    # Print the equation and the final answer.\n    print(f\"The dimension of the system is n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of linearly independent boundary conditions is k = {k}.\")\n    print(\"The index of the problem is n - k.\")\n    print(f\"{n} - {k} = {index}\")\n\nsolve_problem_index()\n```\n<<<2021>>>"
