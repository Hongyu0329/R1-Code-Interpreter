    This function finds the largest value of x for which the summation

    The summation is equivalent to the modified Bessel function of the first kind, I_{x-1}(2).
    So, we need to solve the equation I_{x-1}(2) = 0 for the largest x.
    This is equivalent to finding the largest root 'v' of I_v(2) = 0, where x = v + 1.

    We use a numerical solver to find it.
