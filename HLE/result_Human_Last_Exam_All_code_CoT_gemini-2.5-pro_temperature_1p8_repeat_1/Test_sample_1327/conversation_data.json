    "To solve this number sequence puzzle, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial sequence:** The given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  **Calculate the differences:** I will find the difference between each consecutive term to see if there's a simple arithmetic progression.\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no immediate simple pattern here.\n3.  **Find the pattern in the differences:** I will look for a recursive pattern in the new sequence of differences (9, 12, 28, 68). Let's call this sequence `d`.\n    *   Relationship between 12 and 9: `12 = 2 * 9 - 6`\n    *   Relationship between 28 and 12: `28 = 2 * 12 + 4`\n    *   Relationship between 68 and 28: `68 = 2 * 28 + 12`\n4.  **Identify the emerging rule:** A pattern emerges starting from the second term of the difference sequence: `d(n+1) = 2 * d(n) + C`. The values for `C` are 4 and 12. We can see that 12 is `4 * 3`. This suggests a rule for `C` as well.\n5.  **Extrapolate the pattern:**\n    *   The next value for `C` will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n    *   Using this, the next difference `d(5)` will be `2 * d(4) + 36` which is `2 * 68 + 36 = 136 + 36 = 172`.\n6.  **Calculate the final term:** The missing term in the original sequence is the last known term plus the next difference: `119 + 172 = 291`.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform these calculations and output the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The given sequence\nT = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n# 1. Calculate the sequence of differences between terms\nd = []\nfor i in range(len(T) - 1):\n    diff = T[i+1] - T[i]\n    d.append(diff)\n\n# 2. Find the recursive pattern in the differences\n# The pattern appears to be d[i+1] = 2 * d[i] + C[i] starting from i=1.\n# Let's find the sequence C.\nC = []\n# Calculate C for d[2] = 2 * d[1] + C[0]\n# 28 = 2 * 12 + c1 => c1 = 4\nc1 = d[2] - 2 * d[1]\nC.append(c1)\n# Calculate C for d[3] = 2 * d[2] + C[1]\n# 68 = 2 * 28 + c2 => c2 = 12\nc2 = d[3] - 2 * d[2]\nC.append(c2)\n\n# 3. We notice a pattern in C: C[i+1] = 3 * C[i]\n# Predict the next value in the C sequence\nnext_c = C[-1] * 3\n\n# 4. Predict the next value in the difference sequence d\nnext_d = 2 * d[-1] + next_c\n\n# 5. Predict the next value in the original sequence T\nnext_T = T[-1] + next_d\n\n# Print the final calculation as requested\nprint(f\"The next term is found by adding the next difference to the last term.\")\nprint(f\"The next difference is calculated to be {next_d}.\")\nprint(f\"So, the final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{T[-1]} + {next_d} = {next_T}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
