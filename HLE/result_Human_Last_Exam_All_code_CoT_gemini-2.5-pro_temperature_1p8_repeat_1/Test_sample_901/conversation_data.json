    "Of course. Here is a Python script that logically determines the product of the reaction.\n\nFirst, I will outline the plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n1.  **Analyze Reactants and Reagents**: I will identify the starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, and the reagent, potassium tert-butoxide. I'll note that the reagent is a strong, sterically bulky base.\n2.  **Determine Reaction Mechanism**: Based on the substrate (secondary alkyl halide) and the strong, bulky base, the reaction mechanism will be identified as an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n3.  **Analyze Stereochemistry**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the removed proton (Hydrogen) must be in an anti-periplanar (or trans-diaxial) arrangement in the cyclohexane chair conformation.\n4.  **Evaluate Chair Conformations**: I will determine the most stable chair conformation of the reactant. For (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane (a *cis* isomer), the most stable conformer places the larger methyl group in the equatorial position, which forces the bromine into the axial position. This axial bromine is perfectly set up for an E2 reaction.\n5.  **Identify Possible Products**: With an axial bromine, elimination can occur by removing an axial proton from either adjacent carbon (C2 or C6).\n    *   Removing the proton from C2 would yield the more substituted Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).\n    *   Removing the proton from C6 would yield the less substituted Hofmann product (3-methylcyclohexene).\n6.  **Apply Hofmann's Rule**: Since potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base, it will preferentially attack the less sterically hindered proton. The proton on C6 is more accessible than the proton on C2 (which is shielded by the methyl group). Therefore, the Hofmann product will be the major product.\n7.  **Final Answer**: The major product is identified as 3-methylcyclohexene. The script will print out this step-by-step reasoning and then state the final answer and the numbers in the chemical names.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan:\n```python\ndef identify_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script logically determines the major product of the reaction between\n    (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    reactant = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide\"\n    product = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reactants and Reagents\n    print(\"Step 1: The reactant is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\")\n    print(f\"Step 1: The reagent is {reagent}, which is a strong, sterically bulky base.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine Reaction Mechanism\n    print(\"Step 2: A strong base reacting with a secondary alkyl halide favors an E2 elimination mechanism.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze Stereochemistry\n    print(\"Step 3: The E2 mechanism requires the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen (H) to be in a trans-diaxial orientation (both axial, on adjacent carbons).\")\n    print(f\"Step 3: The reactant, {reactant}, is a cis isomer.
