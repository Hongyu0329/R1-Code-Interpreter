    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to calculate the specific heat scaling exponent α using the epsilon expansion.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Parameters:** We need the spatial dimension `d`, the upper critical dimension `d_c`, and the number of components of the order parameter `n`. For this problem, `d=3`. The Ising model is the standard case, for which the upper critical dimension is `d_c=4` and the order parameter is a scalar, so `n=1`.\n2.  **Calculate Epsilon (ϵ):** The epsilon expansion works for dimensions `d` close to `d_c`. We define the expansion parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **Apply the Epsilon Expansion Formula:** The one-loop (first-order) epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent `α` in the n-vector model is given by the formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Substitute and Solve:** I will substitute the values of `n` and `ϵ` into this formula to calculate the first-order approximation for `α`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** The Python script will perform these calculations and print out each step of the process, including the final formula with all the numbers substituted in.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Parameters for the calculation\n# d: spatial dimension\n# d_c: upper critical dimension for the Ising universality class\n# n: number of components of the order parameter (n=1 for the scalar Ising model)\n\nd = 3\nd_c = 4\nn = 1\n\n# Step 1: Calculate epsilon (ε)\nepsilon = d_c - d\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the numerator and denominator for the alpha formula\n# The first-order epsilon expansion formula for alpha is:\n# α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\nnumerator = 4 - n\ndenominator = 2 * (n + 8)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate alpha\nalpha = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n# Step 4: Print the explanation and the result, showing each number in the equation.\nprint(\"Calculating the specific heat scaling exponent α using the first-order epsilon expansion.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 75)\nprint(f\"The given spatial dimension is d = {d}.\")\nprint(f\"The upper critical dimension for this system (Ising-like) is d_c = {d_c}.\")\nprint(f\"The expansion parameter is ε = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}.\")\nprint(f\"For the Ising model, the order parameter has n = {n} component.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe first-order formula for α is: α ≈ (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\")\nprint(f\"α ≈ ({4} - {n}) / ({2} * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α ≈ {numerator} / (2 * {n + 8}) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α ≈ {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α ≈ {alpha}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThus, to first order in the epsilon expansion for d=3, the scaling exponent α is {alpha:.4f}.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.1667>>>"
