# The cardinality of the family F is the count of the minimal set of
# fundamental infinite topological structures.
# As determined by the step-by-step logical derivation, this count is 5.
# The five fundamental space types are:
# 1. The infinite indiscrete space.
# 2. The infinite discrete space.
# 3. The infinite cofinite space.
# 4. The space of initial segments on a countable set.
# 5. The space of final segments on a countable set.
