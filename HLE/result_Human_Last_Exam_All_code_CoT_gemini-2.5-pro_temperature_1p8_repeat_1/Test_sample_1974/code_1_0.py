    This function explains the reasoning to find the maximum possible cardinality
    of the set S of Diophantine equations described in the problem.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of a set S of Diophantine equations.
    Let's denote a Diophantine equation as D and the statement "D has no solutions in N" as phi_D.
    The conditions for a Diophantine equation D to be in S are:
    1. phi_D is true. (The equation actually has no solutions in the set of natural numbers N).
    2. phi_D is unprovable in ZFC. (ZFC cannot prove that D has no solutions).
    3. phi_D is provable in ZFC + psi. (Adding a new axiom psi to ZFC makes it provable).

    The statement psi is introduced through a generic extension M[G] of a model M. This is a standard
    way in set theory to show that a statement is consistent with ZFC. We are free to choose psi,
    as the question asks for the *maximum possible* cardinality.

    Step 1: Determine the upper bound for the cardinality of S.
    A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation with a finite number of terms, variables, and integer coefficients. 
    The set of all such equations is countably infinite. For example, we can enumerate them by the sum of the absolute
    values of their coefficients, their degrees, and the number of variables.
    Since S is a subset of the set of all Diophantine equations, its cardinality can be at most
    countably infinite. In mathematical terms, |S| <= aleph_0.

    Step 2: Determine the lower bound for the cardinality of S by construction.
    We need to show that |S| can be countably infinite for a suitable choice of psi. To do this,
    we need to find a psi that helps prove infinitely many previously unprovable statements.
    Strong axioms, like large cardinal axioms, are known to have many such consequences.

    Let's choose psi to be a statement asserting the existence of a sufficiently large cardinal, for instance,
    one that implies the existence of a transitive set model of ZFC (e.g., "there exists a worldly cardinal").
    Let's call this psi_LC. Such statements are known to be consistent with ZFC (assuming a stronger theory)
    and can be introduced by forcing.

    The statements phi_D are of a specific logical form: "for all natural numbers x1, ..., xn, P(x1, ..., xn) != 0".
    These are known as Pi_1^0 sentences in arithmetic. The MRDP theorem (Matiyasevich's theorem) establishes a
    correspondence between the unsolvability of Diophantine equations and true Pi_1^0 sentences. So, we are looking
    for the maximum size of a set of true Pi_1^0 sentences unprovable in ZFC but provable in ZFC + psi.

    Let's construct an infinite sequence of such sentences:
    - Let T_0 = ZFC.
    - Let Con(T) be the Pi_1^0 sentence asserting the consistency of a theory T.
    - Let T_{n+1} = T_n + Con(T_n).
    - Let phi_n = Con(T_n).

    By GÃ¶del's Second Incompleteness Theorem, for each n, phi_n is unprovable in T_n (and thus unprovable in ZFC).
    However, if we assume ZFC is consistent, all phi_n are true statements.

    Now, let's see what ZFC + psi_LC proves.
    ZFC + psi_LC proves the existence of a model for ZFC. Inside the theory ZFC + psi_LC, we can formalize the argument
    that a theory with a model must be consistent. Thus, ZFC + psi_LC proves Con(ZFC), which is phi_0.
    This argument can be iterated. By proving the existence of a model for ZFC, we can also prove the existence
    of a model for T_1 = ZFC + Con(ZFC), because the model for ZFC is also a model for T_1 (since Con(ZFC) is true).
    This implies that ZFC + psi_LC proves Con(T_1), which is phi_1.
    In general, ZFC + psi_LC proves phi_n for all natural numbers n.

    So we have found an infinite sequence {phi_0, phi_1, phi_2, ...} of true Pi_1^0 sentences such that:
    - For each n, phi_n is unprovable in ZFC.
    - For each n, phi_n is provable in ZFC + psi_LC.

    By the MRDP theorem, each sentence phi_n corresponds to a Diophantine equation D_n whose unsolvability
    is equivalent to phi_n. These equations are all distinct and belong to the set S.
    This shows that for a suitable psi, the set S is countably infinite.
    Therefore, |S| >= aleph_0.

    Step 3: Conclusion.
    From Step 1, |S| <= aleph_0.
    From Step 2, the maximum possible value for |S| is at least aleph_0.
    Combining these, the maximum possible cardinality of S is exactly aleph_0.
    
    A note on the prompt's instruction: "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!".
    The Diophantine equations corresponding to statements like Con(ZFC) are known to exist but are extremely large and complex,
    involving many variables and high-degree terms. Writing one out explicitly is not feasible or standard practice in this context.
    The instruction likely stems from a generic template and is not applicable to this particular problem.
