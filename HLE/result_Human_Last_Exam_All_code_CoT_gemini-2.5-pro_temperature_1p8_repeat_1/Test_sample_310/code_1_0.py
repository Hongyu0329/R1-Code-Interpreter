        "1. When a laser with Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) interacts with a target, the OAM is transferred to electrons in the created plasma, causing them to rotate.",
        "2. This rotation of electrons generates a strong, stable axial magnetic field along the laser's path.",
        "3. This axial magnetic field acts as a lens, focusing the accelerated protons via the Lorentz force. This causes the proton beam to become more 'Collimated'.",
        "4. The magnetic confinement also creates a more stable and efficient acceleration structure, allowing for better energy transfer from the laser to the protons. This results in an 'Increase' in the final proton energy.",
        "5. Therefore, the combined effect is a collimated proton beam with increased energy."
