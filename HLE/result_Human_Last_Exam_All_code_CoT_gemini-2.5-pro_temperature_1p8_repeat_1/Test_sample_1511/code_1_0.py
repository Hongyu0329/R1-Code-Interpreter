# For Part (b), we calculate the size of the family of all 2-multisets of [5].
# This corresponds to the case where one family is the universal set and the other is empty,
# which gives the maximal sum for |F| + |G|.

m = 5
k = 2

# The formula for the number of k-multisets of an m-element set is C(m + k - 1, k).
# In our problem, this is the size of the largest possible family.
n_for_comb = m + k - 1
k_for_comb = k

# Calculate the value using math.comb
total_multisets = math.comb(n_for_comb, k_for_comb)

# The sum is achieved by taking one family of this size, and the other as empty.
max_sum = total_multisets + 0

# The final answer combines the results from all three parts.
# The calculation below justifies the number for part (b).
