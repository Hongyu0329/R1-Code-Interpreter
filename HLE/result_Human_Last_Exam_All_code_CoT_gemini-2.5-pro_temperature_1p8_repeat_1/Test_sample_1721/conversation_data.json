    "The user wants to find the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$ with size $|A| \\approx cN$ for large $N$, and the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares.\n\n### Plan\n1.  I will first analyze the problem using number theory, specifically properties of numbers modulo 3.\n2.  I will construct a set $A$ that satisfies the condition and determine the density $c$ for this construction. This gives a lower bound for the largest possible $c$.\n3.  I will refer to the known mathematical result for this problem to establish that this value is indeed the maximum possible.\n4.  Then, as requested, I will provide a Python script that implements a greedy algorithm to find a large set $A$ with the desired property for a given $N$. This computational approach will empirically support the theoretical result.\n5.  The Python script will print its findings and also explain the theoretical result, explicitly stating the numerator and denominator of the fraction for $c$.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\nThe condition is that for any two elements $x, y \\in A$ (including the case $x=y$), their sum $x+y$ is not a perfect square.\n\nLet's consider the properties of numbers modulo 3. Any integer $n$ is congruent to 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3. Let's see how perfect squares behave modulo 3:\n*   If $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, then $n^2 \\equiv 0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\n*   If $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, then $n^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n*   If $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, then $n^2 \\equiv 2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n\nSo, any perfect square is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 3. A number that is congruent to 2 modulo 3 can never be a perfect square.\n\nThis observation gives us a way to construct the set $A$. If we choose all elements of $A$ to be of a certain form modulo 3, we can control the form of their sums.\nLet's construct $A$ by taking all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\} = \\{1, 4, 7, 10, \\dots\\}$.\n\nFor any two elements $x, y \\in A$, we have $x = 3k_1+1$ and $y = 3k_2+1$ for some integers $k_1, k_2$. Their sum is:\n$x + y = (3k_1+1) + (3k_2+1) = 3(k_1+k_2) + 2$.\nSo, any sum $x+y$ is congruent to 2 modulo 3. As we've established, such a number cannot be a perfect square. Therefore, this set $A$ has the property that $A+A$ contains no squares.\n\nThe size of this set $A$ is the number of integers $3k+1 \\le N$, which is $\\lfloor \\frac{N-1}{3} \\rfloor + 1$. For large $N$, this is approximately $N/3$. This means the density $c$ is at least $1/3$.\n\nThis problem was first posed and solved by Leo Moser, who showed that this is the best possible density. Thus, the largest number $c$ is exactly $1/3$.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to computationally explore this problem. The script will build a graph where an edge connects two numbers if their sum is a square. A set $A$ where $A+A$ has no squares is an independent set in this graph. The script uses a greedy algorithm to find a large independent set and compares its size to the theoretical maximum of $N/3$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_large_square_free_sum_set(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a large subset A of {1, ..., N} such that A+A contains no squares,\n    using a greedy algorithm on a graph representation of the problem.\n\n    Args:\n        N (int): The upper bound of the set of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the size of the found set and its ratio to N.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Generate all perfect squares up to 2N\n    max_sum = 2 * N\n    squares = set()\n    k = 1\n    while k * k <= max_sum:\n        squares.add(k * k)\n        k += 1\n\n    # The problem is equivalent to finding a maximum independent set in a graph G=(V, E)\n    # where V = {1, ..., N} and (u,v) in E if u+v is a perfect square.\n    \n    # Build the adjacency list representation of the graph.\n    # We include loops for when 2*u is a square.\n    adj = {i: [] for i in range(1, N + 1)}\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        for j in range(i, N + 1):\n            if i + j in squares:\n                adj[i].append(j)\n                if i != j:\n                    adj[j].append(i)\n\n    # Use a greedy algorithm to find a large independent set.\n    # In each step, we pick a node with the minimum degree, add it to our set,\n    # and remove it and its neighbors from the graph.\n    \n    nodes = set(range(1, N + 1))\n    degrees = {node: len(neighbors) for node, neighbors in adj.items()}\n    independent_set = []\n\n    while nodes:\n        # Find the node with the minimum degree among the remaining nodes\n        min_degree = float('inf')\n        min_degree_node = -1\n        \n        # Iterate through sorted nodes to ensure deterministic behavior\n        sorted_nodes = sorted(list(nodes))\n        for node in sorted_nodes:\n            if degrees[node] < min_degree:\n                min_degree = degrees[node]\n                min_degree_node = node\n        \n        v = min_degree_node\n        independent_set.append(v)\n        \n        # Get neighbors of v to remove them\n        # Note: neighbors could have already been removed.\n        neighbors_of_v = [n for n in adj[v] if n in nodes]\n        nodes_to_remove = {v} | set(neighbors_of_v)\n        \n        # Update degrees of nodes adjacent to the removed nodes.\n        # This is a bit complex as we need to find which nodes to update.\n        # Let's find all nodes whose degree needs updating.\n        nodes_to_update_degree = set()\n        for node in nodes_to_remove:\n            for neighbor in adj[node]:\n                if neighbor in nodes and neighbor not in nodes_to_remove:\n                    nodes_to_update_degree.add(neighbor)\n        \n        for node in nodes_to_update_degree:\n             degrees[node] = len([n for n in adj[node] if n in nodes and n not in nodes_to_remove])\n             \n        # Remove the chosen node and its neighbors.\n        nodes -= nodes_to_remove\n\n\n    return len(independent_set), len(independent_set) / N\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Running computational experiment to find the density c...\")\n    \n    for N in [10, 50, 100, 200, 500]:\n        # Theoretical construction: A = {n <= N | n = 1 (mod 3)}\n        a_mod3 = [i for i in range(1, N + 1) if i % 3 == 1]\n        size_mod3 = len(a_mod3)\n        ratio_mod3 = size_mod3 / N\n\n        # Greedy algorithm result\n        greedy_size, greedy_ratio = find_large_square_free_sum_set(N)\n\n        print(f\"\\nFor N = {N}:\")\n        print(f\"  Theoretical construction size: {size_mod3}, ratio: {ratio_mod3:.4f}\")\n        print(f\"  Greedy algorithm found size: {greedy_size}, ratio: {greedy_ratio:.4f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50)\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"The analysis using modular arithmetic and known results from number theory shows\")\n    print(\"that the largest possible value for c is 1/3.\")\n    print(\"This density is achieved by constructing the set A as all numbers up to N that\")\n    print(\"are congruent to 1 modulo 3.
