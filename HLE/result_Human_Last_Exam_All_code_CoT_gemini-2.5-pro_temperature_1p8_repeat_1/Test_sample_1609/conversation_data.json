    "To determine a(4), where a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function with n variables, we need to solve a combinatorial problem. The sequence a(n) is non-trivial and does not have a simple known closed-form formula for all n.\n\nHowever, for small values of n, including n=4, the value can be determined through specific constructions or by applying formulas that are known to work for these cases. One such method that yields the correct result for n=4 is to find the maximum value of the expression `k * C(n, k)` for `k` from 1 to `n`, where `C(n, k)` is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n\nMy plan is to implement a Python script that performs this calculation for n=4:\n1.  Set `n = 4`.\n2.  Iterate `k` from 1 to 4.\n3.  For each `k`, calculate `C(4, k)`, the number of ways to choose `k` items from a set of 4.\n4.  Multiply the result by `k`.\n5.  Find the maximum value among the results for k=1, 2, 3, and 4. This maximum value is `a(4)`.\n\nThe script below will show the calculation for each value of `k` and then determine the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_a4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean\n    function of 4 variables.\n\n    The plan is to find the maximum value of the expression k * C(n, k) for n=4,\n    where k ranges from 1 to 4.
