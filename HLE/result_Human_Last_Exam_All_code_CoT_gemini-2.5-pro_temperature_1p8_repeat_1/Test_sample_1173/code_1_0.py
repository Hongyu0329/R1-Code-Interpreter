# Final value for the response
# The question is to find theta. The code should just output theta's value.
# The explanation is in the text. The python code is more of a calculation scratchpad
# or a final assertion. Let's provide the final derived value.

final_theta_value = 3/4
# Final printing
print(f"The largest possible multiple of 1/8 for theta is {final_theta_value}, which is {int(final_theta_value*8)}/8.")
# I need to follow the output format instruction
# "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# The final equation is E[tau] >= n - c*n^theta. The numbers are c and theta.
# c is a constant we don't need to find. We need to find theta.
# So just printing theta is enough.
print("theta = 3/4")
