        "The Bethe-Salpeter equation is an integral equation that describes the relativistic "
        "two-body system. In essence, it provides a non-perturbative way to calculate the "
        "full scattering properties of two interacting particles. The equation directly "
        "relates the full scattering amplitude (which represents the complete interaction, summing all possible processes) "
        "to the Bethe-Salpeter kernel (which represents the sum of all two-particle irreducible interactions). "
        "Thus, the equation facilitates a correspondence between the scattering amplitude and the interaction kernel."
