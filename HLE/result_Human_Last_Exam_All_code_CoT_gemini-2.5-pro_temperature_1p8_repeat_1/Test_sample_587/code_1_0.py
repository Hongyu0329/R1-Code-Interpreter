        "   - Statement A claims the problem is always FPT. This is false. If H is the class of cliques, the problem is #k-Clique, which is the canonical #W[1]-complete (and thus not FPT) problem.",
        "   - Statement C claims hardness for a class H with maximum degree at most 2. Graphs with maximum degree at most 2 are collections of paths and cycles, which have a bounded treewidth of at most 2. Subgraph counting is FPT for patterns of bounded treewidth. Therefore, C is false.",
        "   - Statement E suggests the complexity is characterized by the vertex-cover number of H. The 'only if' part is false. The class of paths has unbounded vertex-cover number, but since their treewidth is bounded (by 1), counting paths is FPT. This provides a counterexample.",
        "   - Statement B claims that for H being the class of cliques, the problem is #W[1]-complete. This is a correct statement. #k-Clique is #W[1]-complete on general graphs, and this hardness holds for 'somewhere dense' host graph classes.",
        "   - Statement D claims the problem is FPT if and only if the class H has bounded treewidth. This is a fundamental dichotomy theorem in parameterized complexity. For patterns H with bounded treewidth, the problem is FPT (by algorithms like color-coding). For patterns H from a class with unbounded treewidth, the problem is #W[1]-hard on somewhere dense host graphs G. This statement is also correct.",
        "4. We are left with two correct statements: B and D.",
        "5. Statement D provides a complete characterization for any class H. It establishes a general principle that explains why the problem is sometimes tractable and sometimes not. Statement B is a specific instance of the 'hard' case of D's dichotomy (cliques have unbounded treewidth).",
        "6. In computer science theory, a statement that provides a full and general characterization (a dichotomy theorem like D) is considered a more fundamental and comprehensive answer than one that points out a single, specific case (like B)."
