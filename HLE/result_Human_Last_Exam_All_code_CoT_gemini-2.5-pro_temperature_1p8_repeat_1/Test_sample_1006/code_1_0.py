    Solves the topological problem by explaining the reasoning step-by-step.

    The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a compact
    topological space X with two properties:
    (1) X contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
    (2) Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique
        continuous function on X.
