    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Define Rule 110**: I'll create a data structure, like a dictionary, that maps every possible 3-cell neighborhood (e.g., (1,1,0), (1,0,1)) to its corresponding output (1 or 0) according to Rule 110. The binary representation of 110 is `01101110`, which corresponds to the outputs for the neighborhoods `111, 110, 101, 100, 011, 010, 001, 000` respectively.\n2.  **Initialize the Automaton**: I'll create a 1D list of cells, large enough to contain the pattern's growth over 20 generations. The simulation will start from an initial state of a single `1` in the center of this list, with all other cells being `0`.\n3.  **Simulate Generations**: I'll loop 20 times. In each iteration, I will compute the next generation of cells based on the current one. A new list will be created, and for each cell, its next state will be determined by applying the Rule 110 logic to its 3-cell neighborhood in the current generation. After the new generation is fully calculated, it will replace the old one.\n4.  **Format and Print the Final Pattern**: After 20 iterations are complete, the list will contain the final pattern. I will trim any leading or trailing zeros and then print the resulting binary sequence.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef run_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script simulates the cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 generations,\n    starting from a single cell in state 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
