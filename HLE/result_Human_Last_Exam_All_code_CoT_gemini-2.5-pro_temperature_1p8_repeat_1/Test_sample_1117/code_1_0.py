print("1. The reaction is between Ce₂@C₈₀ and an external reactant.")
print("   - The two Cerium (Ce) atoms are permanently trapped INSIDE the C₈₀ carbon cage.")
print("   - The disilirane molecule reacts with the OUTSIDE of the cage.")
print("\n2. This means direct coordination between the external molecule and the internal Ce atoms is impossible.")
print("   - This rules out answers A and B.\n")

print("3. Before the reaction, the Ce atoms move freely. The external reaction adds a group to the cage, breaking its symmetry.")
print("   - This changes the electrostatic potential inside the cage, which 'locks' the Ce atoms into fixed, low-energy positions.")
print("   - This rules out answer C, where motion remains random.\n")

print("4. The external group creates a new axis for the molecule.")
print("   - To find the most stable configuration, the two Ce atoms align along this axis at the furthest points from each other.")
print("   - These positions are known as the poles of the fullerene.\n")

print("--- Final Conclusion ---")
print("The reaction causes the two Cerium atoms to become fixed at the poles of the fullerene.")
# The following line summarizes the result in an equation-like format including the numbers.
