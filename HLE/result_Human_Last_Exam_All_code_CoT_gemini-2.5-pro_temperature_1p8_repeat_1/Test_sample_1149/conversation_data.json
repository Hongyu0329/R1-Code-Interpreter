    "Here is a plan to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The query is about a specific anatomical feature of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*. This is a question of fact based on paleontological research.\n2.  **Locate a Scientific Source:** I will access information from the primary scientific literature describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri*. The key reference is the 2002 paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, which provides a detailed description of the holotype skull.\n3.  **Extract the Relevant Data:** According to the scientific description of the skull (specimen SMNS 58022), the lateral surface of the lacrimal recess is marked by a specific number of distinct depressions. The paper identifies an anterodorsal depression, a posterodorsal depression, and a ventral depression.\n4.  **Formulate the Code:** I will write a Python script that represents each identified depression as a variable. The script will then sum these variables to calculate the total number and print the result in a clear, descriptive sentence, including the numbers that make up the total, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_irritator_depressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of depressions\n    in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri based on\n    published paleontological findings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to the 2002 paper by Sues et al. on the skull of Irritator challengeri,\n    # the lacrimal recess is described as having three main depressions.\n    \n    # We can represent each distinct depression.\n    anterodorsal_depression = 1\n    posterodorsal_depression = 1\n    ventral_depression = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of depressions.\n    total_depressions = anterodorsal_depression + posterodorsal_depression + ventral_depression\n    \n    # Print the final result as a full sentence, showing each number in the equation.\n    print(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {anterodorsal_depression} anterodorsal depression + {posterodorsal_depression} posterodorsal depression + {ventral_depression} ventral depression = {total_depressions} depressions in total.\")\n\nsolve_irritator_depressions()\n```\n<<<3>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
