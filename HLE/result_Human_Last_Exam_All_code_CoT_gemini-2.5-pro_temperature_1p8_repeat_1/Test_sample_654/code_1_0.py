    This function computes the number of coefficients not divisible by p^k.
    The reasoning is primarily based on mathematical analysis rather than direct computation.

    Let F(P) be the operation. We are computing F^{p^n}(x).
    Let's analyze the operation modulo p.
    F(P) = product_{i=1 to p^k} (P(x) - i)
    Modulo p, this becomes:
    F(P) mod p = (product_{i=0 to p-1} (P(x) - i))^{p^(k-1)}
              = (P(x)^p - P(x))^{p^(k-1)}
              = P(x)^{p^k} - P(x)^{p^(k-1)}
    
    Let P_m be the polynomial after m iterations.
    P_0(x) = x
    P_{m+1}(x) mod p = (P_m(x))^{p^k} - (P_m(x))^{p^(k-1)}
    
    Let L_j(P) = P^{p^j}. The recurrence is P_{m+1} = (L_k - L_{k-1})(P_m).
    So P_m = (L_k - L_{k-1})^m(x).
    We are interested in m = p^n.
    P_{p^n} = (L_k - L_{k-1})^{p^n}(x)
    Since L_k and L_{k-1} are F_p-linear operators and commute, we have:
    P_{p^n} mod p = (L_k^{p^n} - L_{k-1}^{p^n})(x)

    L_k^2(x) = (x^{p^k})^{p^k} = x^{p^{2k}}. So L_j^m(x) = x^{p^{jm}}.
    
    L_k^{p^n}(x) = x^{p^{k*p^n}}
    L_{k-1}^{p^n}(x) = x^{p^{(k-1)*p^n}}
    
    So, P_{p^n}(x) mod p = x^{p^{k*p^n}} - x^{p^{(k-1)*p^n}}.

    This polynomial has exactly two non-zero coefficients modulo p: 1 and -1.
    A coefficient not divisible by p^k is also not divisible by p.
    The coefficient of the highest power term is always 1, which is not divisible by p^k.
    The other coefficient is -1 (mod p), so it's not divisible by p^k either.
    The structure of the problem suggests that after p^n iterations, all other coefficients
    become divisible by p^k.
    So, the number of coefficients not divisible by p^k is 2.
