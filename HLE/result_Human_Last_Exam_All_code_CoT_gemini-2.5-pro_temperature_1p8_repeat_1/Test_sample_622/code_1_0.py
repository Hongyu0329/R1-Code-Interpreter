    print("- Principle A: An anaphor (e.g., 'himself', 'herself') must be bound in its local clause.")
    print("- Principle B: A pronoun (e.g., 'he', 'she') must be free in its local clause.")
    print("- Principle C: An R-expression (e.g., a name like 'Mary') must be free everywhere.")
    print("A broader view of binding also includes principles governing the relationship between moved elements (like 'who', 'what') and the traces they leave behind, such as the Empty Category Principle (ECP).\n")

    print(f"Sentence A is: '{sentence_a}'")
    print("Here, 'She' is a pronoun and 'Mary' is an R-expression (a name). They are co-indexed ('_i'), meaning they refer to the same person.")
    print("The pronoun 'She' is in the subject position and c-commands the R-expression 'Mary' in the object position.")
    print("Principle C states that an R-expression must be free (not c-commanded by a co-referential element).")
    print("Conclusion for A: This sentence violates Principle C. Therefore, it is ungrammatical due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    print("Step 3: Analysis of Sentence B")

    print(f"Sentence B is: '{sentence_b}'")

    print("In English, 'Whose' cannot be moved on its own, leaving the noun 'glasses' behind. The entire phrase 'Whose glasses' must be moved to the front.")
    print("Correct form: 'Whose glasses does John like?'")
    print("Conclusion for B: This violates constraints on syntactic movement. This can be seen as a type of binding violation, as the moved element ('Whose') fails to properly bind its trace.\n")

    print("Step 4: Analysis of Sentence C")
    sentence_c = "Who does John like Mary and?"
    print(f"Sentence C is: '{sentence_c}'")
    print("This sentence is ungrammatical. It attempts to question one part ('himself' or 'someone', which becomes 'Who') of a coordinate structure ('Mary and himself').")
    print("This violates the Coordinate Structure Constraint, which states that one cannot move an element out of a coordinate structure.")
    print("Conclusion for C: This is a violation of a movement constraint (an 'island constraint'). Like the issue in B, this can be framed as a binding violation where the moved element 'Who' cannot bind its trace from outside the coordinate 'island'.\n")

    print("Step 5: Final Conclusion")
    print("All three sentences (A, B, and C) are ungrammatical due to violations of syntactic principles that govern relationships of binding or co-reference.")
    print("- A violates Binding Principle C for R-expressions.")
    print("- B and C violate principles governing the 'binding' of traces left by movement.")
    print("Given that the answer choices include combinations, the question intends this broader definition of 'binding principles'.")
    print("Therefore, A, B, and C all fit the description.")
