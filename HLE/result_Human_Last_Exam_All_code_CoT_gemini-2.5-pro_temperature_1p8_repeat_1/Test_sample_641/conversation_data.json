    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and Field:** The group is PSU(n, q^2) with n=4 and q=997. An involution is an element of order 2.\n\n2.  **Relate Involutions in PSU to Elements in SU:** The group PSU(n, q^2) is the quotient of the special unitary group SU(n, q^2) by its center, Z. An element `gZ` in PSU is an involution if `(gZ)^2` is the identity, which means `g^2` must be in the center `Z`, and `g` must not be in `Z`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Center Z:** The center of SU(n, q^2) has order `gcd(n, q+1)`. For n=4 and q=997, the order is `gcd(4, 998) = 2`. The center is `Z = {I, -I}`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n\n4.  **Find Preimages in SU(4, 997^2):** We need to count elements `g` in SU(4, 997^2) such that `g^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}` and `g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}`.\n    *   The condition `g^2 = -I` is impossible for any element in the unitary group over a field of odd characteristic (like 997), because it leads to a contradiction in the required properties of its eigenvalues.\n    *   This leaves us with the condition `g^2 = I`, which means `g` is an involution in SU(4, 997^2).\n\n5.  **Count Non-Central Involutions:** The elements we are looking for are the non-central involutions in SU(4, 997^2). For SU(4, q^2), these involutions form a single conjugacy class. The number of elements in this class (`N_1`) can be calculated using the formula `N_1 = q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Number:** Each involution in PSU corresponds to a pair of non-central involutions `{g, -g}` in SU. Therefore, the number of involutions in PSU(4, q^2) is the number of non-central involutions in SU(4, q^2) divided by 2 (the size of the center).\n\nThe final formula is `N = (q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)) / 2`. The Python code below computes this value for q=997.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Set the value for q\nq = 997\n\n# The formula for the number of involutions in PSU(4, q^2) for odd q is:\n# N = (q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)) / 2\n\n# Calculate each term in the formula\nterm_q4 = q**4\nterm_q2_plus_1 = q**2 + 1\nterm_q2_minus_q_plus_1 = q**2 - q + 1\n\n# Calculate the numerator\nnumerator = term_q4 * term_q2_plus_1 * term_q2_minus_q_plus_1\n\n# Calculate the final result using integer division\nresult = numerator // 2\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation with the computed numbers\nprint(f\"The number of involutions in PSU(4, {q}) is given by the formula:\")\nprint(\"N = (q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)) / 2\")\nprint(f\"\\nSubstituting q = {q}:\")\nprint(f\"N = ({term_q4} * ({q**2} + 1) * ({q**2} - {q} + 1)) / 2\")\nprint(f\"N = ({term_q4} * {term_q2_plus_1} * {term_q2_minus_q_plus_1}) / 2\")\nprint(f\"N = {numerator} / 2\")\nprint(f\"\\nNumber of involutions in PSU(4, 997): {result}\")\n```\n<<<487641700784710499507196515>>>"
