# The three-digit number is formed by the categories corresponding to f_1(n), f_2(n), and f_3(n).
# Digit 1 corresponds to f_1(n) for a forest of maximum degree at most sqrt(log n).
# The bound on the number of steps is Theta(Delta) = Theta(sqrt(log n)), which is category 6.
digit_1 = 6

# Digit 2 corresponds to f_2(n) for a forest of maximum degree at most log n.
# The bound on the number of steps is Theta(Delta) = Theta(log n), which is category 8.
digit_2 = 8

# Digit 3 corresponds to f_3(n) for any forest.
# The bound on the number of steps is Theta(Delta). Delta can be up to n-1.
# Theta(n) is omega(log n), which is category 9.
digit_3 = 9

# The final three-digit number. The prompt instruction "output each number in the final equation"
# is ambiguous as there is no equation. I will interpret it as showing the components of the final number.
