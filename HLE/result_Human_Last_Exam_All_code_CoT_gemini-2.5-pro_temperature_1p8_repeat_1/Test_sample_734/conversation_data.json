    "The theologian who first developed a systematic and specialized terminology to explain such events is **Augustine of Hippo** (354-430 AD).\n\nHis key concept was that of **\"seminal reasons\"** (*rationes seminales* or *rationes causales*).\n\nHere's the plan for how this concept addresses the user's question:\n1.  **Define Seminal Reasons:** Augustine proposed that at the initial creation, God embedded \"seeds\" or \"potentials\" for everything that would ever come into being. These are the *rationes seminales*.\n2.  **Explain Normal Natural Law:** The ordinary, predictable course of nature is simply the normal unfolding of these seminal reasons in their expected sequence (e.g., an acorn growing into an oak tree).\n3.  **Explain Miracles (like the Virgin Birth):** A miracle is not a violation of the natural order that God created, but rather the divine activation of a seminal reason that lies dormant or outside the usual, observable sequence. God, as the author of these reasons, can bring them to fruition at any time. Thus, the virgin birth was a potential God had embedded in creation from the beginning and chose to activate at a specific moment in history.\n4.  **Explain Changes at the Fall:** Similarly, the alterations in nature after the Fall (e.g., the introduction of death, toil, and suffering) can be understood as a shift in which seminal reasons would manifest. The potential for decay and hardship was present, and the Fall changed the conditions of the world, causing these negative potentials to become active and part of the new \"course of nature.\"\n\nThis single framework of *rationes seminales* provides a sophisticated way to talk about God's interaction with the world, allowing for a consistent natural order, unique miracles, and epochal shifts in how that order operates, all without portraying God as arbitrary or contradicting His own created laws.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to print out this information.\n```python\ndef theological_explanation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the name of the theologian and the explanation of their key concept.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    key_concept = \"seminal reasons (rationes seminales)\"\n\n    explanation = f\"\"\"\nThe Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to address this was {theologian}.\n\nHis key concept was that of the '{key_concept}'.\n\nHere is how this single concept applies to both cases:\n\n1.  Normal Nature: Augustine argued that God embedded the potential for all future things into creation from the beginning as 'seminal reasons'. The regular laws of nature are the normal, sequential unfolding of these potentials.\n\n2.  Miracles (e.g., the Virgin Birth): A miracle is not God violating nature, but rather God activating a pre-existing 'seminal reason' outside of its normal timing or sequence. It's a potential that was always there, just hidden from the usual course of events.\n\n3.  The Fall: The changes to the natural world after the Fall are explained as a shift in the conditions of creation, causing previously dormant or negative 'seminal reasons' (for decay, thorns, hardship) to become active and part of the regular course of nature.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\ntheological_explanation()\nprint(\"\\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>\")\n```"
