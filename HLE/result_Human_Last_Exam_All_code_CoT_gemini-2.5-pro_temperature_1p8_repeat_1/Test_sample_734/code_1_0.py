The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to address this was {theologian}.

His key concept was that of the '{key_concept}'.

Here is how this single concept applies to both cases:

1.  Normal Nature: Augustine argued that God embedded the potential for all future things into creation from the beginning as 'seminal reasons'. The regular laws of nature are the normal, sequential unfolding of these potentials.

2.  Miracles (e.g., the Virgin Birth): A miracle is not God violating nature, but rather God activating a pre-existing 'seminal reason' outside of its normal timing or sequence. It's a potential that was always there, just hidden from the usual course of events.

3.  The Fall: The changes to the natural world after the Fall are explained as a shift in the conditions of creation, causing previously dormant or negative 'seminal reasons' (for decay, thorns, hardship) to become active and part of the regular course of nature.
