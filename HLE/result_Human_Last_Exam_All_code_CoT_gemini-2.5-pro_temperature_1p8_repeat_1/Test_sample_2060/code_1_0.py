    Analyzes potential information routes in the monkey visual 'what' pathway
    to identify the impossible one based on known neuroanatomy.

    The "what" pathway (ventral stream) has a generally hierarchical and
    posterior-to-anterior flow (V1 -> V2 -> V4 -> TEO -> TE). While feedback
    and loops exist, a route that reverses the main hierarchical progression
    within the inferior temporal cortex (IT) is not plausible.

    The critical flaw to check for is the transition from a higher IT area (like VTF)
    back to a lower one (TEO) as part of a forward-moving path.
