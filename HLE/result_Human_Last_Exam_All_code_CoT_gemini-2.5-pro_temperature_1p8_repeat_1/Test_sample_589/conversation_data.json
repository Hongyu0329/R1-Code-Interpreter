    "My plan is to identify the movie based on the very specific visual cues provided in your query. I will break down the key elements: a major Hollywood film, a teenager as the protagonist of the scene, a distinctly pink bicycle, and the specific action of pedaling directly into the path of an oncoming car. By cross-referencing these details with famous scenes in teen and horror films, I can pinpoint the exact movie you're thinking of.\n\nThe scene you're describing occurs in the 1999 dark comedy \"Jawbreaker.\" Towards the end of the film, the character Fern Mayo (played by Judy Greer), who has been remade into a popular girl named Vylette, has a climactic confrontation. She gets on a pink bicycle and defiantly pedals straight toward a convertible being driven by the film's main antagonist, Courtney Shayne (played by Rose McGowan). This sequence perfectly matches all the details of your request.\n\n```python\n# The film featuring a teenager on a pink bike pedaling toward an oncoming car.\nmovie_title = \"Jawbreaker\"\nstudio = \"TriStar Pictures\"\nyear = 1999\n\nprint(f\"The movie you are referring to is '{movie_title}', a feature film produced by {studio} in {year}.\")\n```\n<<<Jawbreaker>>>"
