    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to place 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This will be done by systematically checking every possible arrangement of 4 queens.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define the Board and Attacks:** A 5x5 toroidal board means the edges wrap around. A queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks a square `(r2, c2)` if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board of size `N x N` (here `N=5`), the attack conditions are:\n    *   **Row Attack:** `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column Attack:** `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Diagonal Attack:** This is where the wrap-around happens. We can check this efficiently using modular arithmetic:\n        *   `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N`\n        *   `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`\n\n2.  **Generate and Test Placements:** We will write a Python script to perform the following steps:\n    *   Generate all possible combinations of 4 squares out of the 25 squares on the board.\n    *   For each combination, check if any pair of queens attacks each other using the rules above.\n    *   If no two queens in a placement attack each other, it is a valid solution, and we increment a counter.\n\n3.  **Output the Result:** After checking all combinations, the final count will be the answer. The script will print this number.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_toroidal_queens_placements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place a given number of non-attacking queens\n    on a toroidal chessboard of a given size.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 5\n    num_queens = 4\n\n    # Create a list of all possible square coordinates, e.g., (0, 0), (0, 1), ...\n    all_squares = [(r, c) for r in range(board_size) for c in range(board_size)]\n\n    valid_placements_count = 0\n\n    # Generate all unique combinations of squares to place the queens\n    # This is equivalent to \"25 choose 4\" for a 5x5 board and 4 queens.\n    for queen_positions in itertools.combinations(all_squares, num_queens):\n        is_valid = True\n        \n        # Check for attacks between every pair of queens in the current placement\n        # For 4 queens, there are C(4, 2) = 6 pairs to check.\n        for q1, q2 in itertools.combinations(queen_positions, 2):\n            r1, c1 = q1\n            r2, c2 = q2\n\n            # Check for row or column attacks\n            if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2:\n                is_valid = False\n                break\n            \n            # Check for toroidal diagonal attacks using modular arithmetic\n            if (r1 - c1) % board_size == (r2 - c2) % board_size:\n                is_valid = False\n                break\n            \n            if (r1 + c1) % board_size == (r2 + c2) % board_size:\n                is_valid = False\n                break\n\n        if is_valid:\n            valid_placements_count += 1\n\n    # Print the final result in a descriptive sentence\n    print(f\"For a {board_size}x{board_size} toroidal board, the number of ways to place {num_queens} non-attacking queens is {valid_placements_count}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_toroidal_queens_placements()\n```\n<<<50>>>"
