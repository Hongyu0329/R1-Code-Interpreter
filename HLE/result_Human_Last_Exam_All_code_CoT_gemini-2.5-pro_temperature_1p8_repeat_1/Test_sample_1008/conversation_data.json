    "In a typical dance scene in film, the auditory elements are layered to create a specific emotional impact and to guide the audience's focus. The hierarchy is generally determined by what is driving the scene's narrative and rhythm.\n\nHere is the plan to determine the hierarchy and present it:\n1.  **Analyze the core purpose of a dance scene:** The primary purpose is to convey emotion, advance the plot, or showcase a performance, all of which are intrinsically linked to music.\n2.  **Rank Music:** Music is the foundation. It dictates the tempo, rhythm, mood, and choreography. Therefore, it is the most important sound element.\n3.  **Rank Sound Effects:** Sound effects (SFX), such as footsteps, the swish of clothing, or environmental sounds, add a layer of realism and texture. In genres like tap dance, the sound of the feet becomes a percussive part of the music itself. However, they generally serve to support the music and the visual action, placing them second in importance.\n4.  **Rank Speech:** Dialogue or speech is usually minimized or entirely absent during a dance sequence. It can distract from the music and the physical performance, which are the main focus. If present, it's typically brief and of tertiary importance.\n5.  **Format the output:** The final code will store these elements in a list in the correct order and then print them as a comma-separated string.\n\n```python\n# The hierarchy of sound importance in a dance scene.\n# Music is the primary driver of the scene, setting the mood and rhythm.\n# Sound effects add realism and texture, supporting the music and action.\n# Speech is typically minimized to avoid distracting from the dance.\n\nsound_hierarchy = [\"Music\", \"Sound effects\", \"Speech\"]\n\n# Print the hierarchy in the requested format\nprint(\", \".join(sound_hierarchy))\n```\n<<<Music, Sound effects, Speech>>>"
