    This function determines the minimum number of prototypes required.

    The problem requires us to find the minimum number of prototypes to guarantee that
    a distance-weighted soft-label kNN classifier correctly classifies C class centroids.

    1.  **Sufficiency**: To guarantee that Centroid_i is classified as Class i, we can
        place a prototype, P_i, directly at the location of Centroid_i. We assign P_i
        a "pure" soft label, where the score is 1 for Class i and 0 for all other
        classes. When classifying Centroid_i, the distance to P_i is 0. In a
        distance-weighted scheme (e.g., weight = 1/distance), P_i has an infinite
        weight. This infinite weight ensures that the final computed label for
        Centroid_i is the pure label of P_i, guaranteeing a correct classification
        regardless of the value of k > 0 or the other prototypes. By creating one such
        prototype for each of the C classes, we can guarantee all C centroids are
        classified correctly. This shows that C prototypes are sufficient.

    2.  **Necessity**: Can we succeed with fewer than C prototypes? Assume we have
        C-1 prototypes. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one
        class, say Class X, which is not the primary class for any of the C-1
        prototypes. When we try to classify Centroid_X, all prototypes in the kNN
        neighborhood will have soft labels that favor other classes. There is no
        prototype to "pull" the classification towards X. Therefore, it's impossible
        to guarantee that Centroid_X will be classified correctly. This shows that
        C-1 prototypes are not sufficient.

    3.  **Conclusion**: Since C prototypes are sufficient and C-1 are not, the minimum
        number of prototypes required is C. The values of N and D are irrelevant to
        this logical conclusion.

    The final equation is simply:
    Minimum Number of Prototypes = C
    """
    
    # The number of classes 'C' is a variable in the problem description.
    # The solution is the variable itself.
    variable_c = 'C'

    # Outputting the final equation as requested.
    # In this case, it's a symbolic equation.
    print(f"Minimum Number of Prototypes = {variable_c}")
