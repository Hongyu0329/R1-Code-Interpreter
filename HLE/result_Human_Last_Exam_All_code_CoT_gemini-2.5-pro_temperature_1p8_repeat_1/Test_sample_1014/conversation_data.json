    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization:** The core of the task is to break down the number 8139881 into its prime factors. A prime factor is a prime number that divides the original number without leaving a remainder.\n2.  **Trial Division Algorithm:** I will use an efficient method called trial division.\n    *   First, I will check for the smallest prime, 2. I'll repeatedly divide the number by 2 until it's no longer even.\n    *   Next, I will loop through odd numbers (3, 5, 7, and so on) up to the square root of the remaining number. For each odd number that is a divisor, I'll add it to my list of factors and divide the number by it repeatedly.\n    *   If any number is left after the loop finishes, that remaining number must also be a prime factor.\n3.  **Identify the Largest Factor:** Once I have the complete list of prime factors, I will find the maximum value in that list.\n4.  **Display the Result:** As requested, the code will first print the full prime factorization equation and then print the largest prime divisor.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the prime factorization of a given number,\n    prints the factorization equation, and then prints the largest prime divisor.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 8139881\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Step 1: Factor out the number 2.\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Step 2: Factor out odd numbers starting from 3.\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of the remaining number.\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n\n    # Step 3: If n is still greater than 1 at the end, the remaining\n    # n is a prime factor itself.\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # Step 4: Output the factorization equation as requested.\n    # The equation shows how the original number is a product of its prime factors.\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of {original_n} is:\")\n    print(f\"{original_n} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\")\n\n    # Step 5: Find the largest prime factor from our list and print it.\n    if factors:\n        largest_prime_factor = max(factors)\n        print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor is {largest_prime_factor}\")\n    else:\n        # This case is for input n=1.\n        print(f\"\\n{original_n} has no prime factors.\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer.\nfind_largest_prime_divisor()\n```\n<<<6257>>>"
