No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. This remains true even for homopolynucleotides.

While both are biological polymers (large molecules made of repeating monomer subunits), their chemical composition, monomer structure, and the bonds linking the monomers are fundamentally different.

Here is a breakdown of the key structural differences:

1.  **Monomers (The Building Blocks):**
    *   **Polysaccharides:** The monomers are monosaccharides (simple sugars, e.g., glucose). They consist only of sugar units.
    *   **Polynucleotides:** The monomers are nucleotides. Each nucleotide is a far more complex unit made of three separate components:
        a. A pentose sugar (ribose in RNA, deoxyribose in DNA).
        b. A phosphate group.
        c. A nitrogenous base (e.g., Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine).

2.  **Connecting Bonds:**
    *   **Polysaccharides:** Monosaccharide monomers are linked together by **glycosidic bonds**.
    *   **Polynucleotides:** Nucleotide monomers are linked by **phosphodiester bonds**, which form a characteristic sugar-phosphate backbone.

3.  **Overall Chemical Composition:**
    *   **Polysaccharides:** Composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (i.e., they are carbohydrates).
    *   **Polynucleotides:** In addition to the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the sugar component, they critically contain **phosphorus** (from the phosphate groups) and **nitrogen** (from the bases).

**Conclusion:**
Although polynucleotides do contain a sugar component, the mandatory presence of phosphate groups and nitrogenous bases, all linked by phosphodiester bonds, defines them as a distinct class of molecules. Therefore, a polynucleotide cannot be structurally classified as a polysaccharide.
