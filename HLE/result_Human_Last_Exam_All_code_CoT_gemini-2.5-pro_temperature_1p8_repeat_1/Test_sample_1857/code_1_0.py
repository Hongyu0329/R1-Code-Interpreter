# Based on the reasoning above, we have found the values for j, k, and l.
# This code will print the final result.

# j corresponds to Beethoven's 5th Symphony and 5th Piano Concerto.
j = 5

# k corresponds to Britney Spears's 4th studio album and the 4th movement of Beethoven's 5th.
k = 4

# l is derived from the track number of the song "Toxic".
l = 1

# The problem states: "output each number in the final equation!".
# Since there isn't a literal equation to display, the code will print the solved values
# in the format demonstrated in the problem description, like "j k l".

print(f"The numbers derived from the clues are:")
print(f"j = {j}")
print(f"k = {k}")
print(f"l = {l}")
print(f"The final answer is: {j} {k} {l}")
