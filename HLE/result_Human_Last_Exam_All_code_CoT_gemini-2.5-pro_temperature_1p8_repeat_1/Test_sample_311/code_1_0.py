# Final Answer Calculation
# This script calculates the number of atoms transferred between molecules in the synthesis.

# Question 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
# Compound 11 (C4) is split into two C2 fragments (compound 12).
# One C2 fragment is used in the synthesis. These 2 carbons remain through all steps to compound 1.
carbons_from_11_in_1 = 2

# Question 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
# Compound 11 (2 oxygens) is split into two fragments (compound 12), each with 1 oxygen from 11.
# The synthesis uses one fragment, so 1 oxygen from 11 is carried forward.
# This oxygen is unaffected by the reactions leading to compound 14.
oxygens_from_11_in_14 = 1

# Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
# Compound 10 is made with MeNO2 and has 1 nitrogen.
# Compound 7 is made from compound 10, so it also has 1 nitrogen.
# That 1 nitrogen in compound 7 is the same nitrogen from compound 10.
nitrogens_from_7_in_10 = 1

# Printing the results
print(f"Number of carbons from compound 11 in compound 1: {carbons_from_11_in_1}")
print(f"Number of oxygens from compound 11 in compound 14: {oxygens_from_11_in_14}")
print(f"Number of nitrogens from compound 7 in compound 10: {nitrogens_from_7_in_10}")

final_answer = f"{carbons_from_11_in_1},{oxygens_from_11_in_14},{nitrogens_from_7_in_10}"
