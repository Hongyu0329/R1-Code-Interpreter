    "Here is my plan to determine the maximal rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n1.  **Model the Flag as a Matrix**: I will represent the flag as a grid of pixels. Every red pixel is assigned a value `a`, and every white pixel is assigned a value `b`. The goal is to find the maximum possible rank of this matrix by choosing the optimal values for `a` and `b`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structure**: The flag of Tonga has a very specific structure:\n    *   A main field that is entirely red.\n    *   A canton (top-left rectangle) that is white.\n    *   A red cross located inside the white canton.\n\n3.  **Identify Row Types**: I will analyze the rows of the resulting matrix. Due to the flag's simple geometric structure, there will be very few distinct types of rows.\n    *   Any row that passes through the main red field (i.e., any row below the canton) will consist only of the value `a`.\n    *   Within the top portion of the flag (the part containing the canton), rows that intersect the horizontal bar of the red cross will also consist entirely of the value `a`.\n    *   Rows that intersect the white part of the canton (above or below the horizontal bar of the cross) will consist of `b` values (for the white background) and `a` values (for the vertical bar of the red cross, and for the red field to the right of the canton).\n\n4.  **Determine the Rank**: Based on this analysis, I will find that there are only two unique types of rows in the entire matrix. The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). The entire row space of the flag matrix is spanned by these two row types, so the rank can be at most 2. To maximize the rank, I will determine if it's possible to choose `a` and `b` to make these two row types linearly independent. If they can be made independent, the maximal rank will be 2.\n\n5.  **Construct a Python Script**: Finally, I will write a Python script that demonstrates this conclusion. The script will construct a sample matrix for the flag and use NumPy's rank function to verify the result. By showing that choosing `a` and `b` appropriately yields a rank of 2, the script will confirm the logical deduction.\n\nThis step-by-step process ensures a robust and verifiable answer to the problem.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_and_explain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the maximal rank of the Tongan flag matrix and explains the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. Theoretical Analysis\n    # Let 'a' be the value for red pixels and 'b' for white pixels.\n    # The flag's matrix has two distinct types of rows:\n    #\n    # - Row Type 1: An all-red row. This occurs for any row fully in the red field\n    #   or intersecting the horizontal bar of the red cross in the canton.\n    #   It looks like: [a, a, a, ..., a]\n    #\n    # - Row Type 2: A row passing through the white sections of the canton.\n    #   It contains 'b's for the white background and 'a's for the red cross/field.\n    #   It looks like: [b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a]\n    #\n    # The entire row space of the matrix is spanned by these two vectors.\n    # Therefore, the rank can be at most 2.\n\n    # To find the *maximal* rank, we must choose 'a' and 'b' such that these\n    # two row types are linearly independent.\n    #\n    # They are linearly dependent if one is a scalar multiple of the other.\n    # For this to happen (with non-zero vectors), they would need to be identical\n    # in pattern, which would require a = b. If a = b, the flag is one color,\n    # and the rank is 1.\n    #\n    # By choosing a != b (and a != 0), we make the two row types linearly independent.\n    # For example, let a = 2 and b = 1.\n    # A vector of all 2s cannot be a multiple of a vector containing 1s and 2s.\n    # Since the two row types are linearly independent, the rank is 2.\n\n    # 2. Demonstration with NumPy\n    # We can create a sample matrix and compute its rank.\n    # Let's choose values to maximize the rank.\n    a = 2.0\n    b = 1.0\n\n    # Define matrix and feature dimensions (proportions can be approximate)\n    H, W = 20, 40\n    canton_h, canton_w = H // 2, W // 4\n    matrix = np.full((H, W), fill_value=a)  # Red field\n\n    # White canton\n    matrix[0:canton_h, 0:canton_w] = b\n\n    # Red cross in canton\n    cross_h_bar_start, cross_h_bar_end = canton_h // 3, (canton_h * 2) // 3\n    cross_v_bar_start, cross_v_bar_end = canton_w // 3, (canton_w * 2) // 3\n    matrix[cross_h_bar_start:cross_h_bar_end, 0:canton_w] = a\n    matrix[0:canton_h, cross_v_bar_start:cross_v_bar_end] = a\n\n    # Calculate the rank\n    maximal_rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(matrix)\n\n    # 3.
