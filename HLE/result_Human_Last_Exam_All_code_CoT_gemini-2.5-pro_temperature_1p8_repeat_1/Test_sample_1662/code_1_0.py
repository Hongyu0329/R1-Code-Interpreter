    The question asks to identify which pair of ballet institutions uses a pirouette preparation from fourth position with bent knees and arms in an 'allongé' (elongated) position. Let's analyze the styles:

    1.  **School of American Ballet (SAB):** This school, founded by George Balanchine, is famous for the Balanchine Technique. A signature of this style is the preparation for pirouettes from a deep fourth position lunge (bent knees) with the arms held in a distinct open and stretched (allongé) position. This is a definite match.

    2.  **Paris Opera Ballet School (French School):** The French style emphasizes elegance, precision, and long lines. Its preparation for pirouettes from fourth position often involves a sweeping movement where the arms open wide, passing through an allongé line, to generate momentum and aesthetic quality. While stylistically different from the Balanchine preparation, it prominently features the use of an allongé arm position.

    3.  **The Royal Ballet School, Vaganova Academy, and La Scala:** These schools teach the English, Russian (Vaganova), and Italian (Cecchetti) methods, respectively. In these highly structured techniques, the preparation for pirouettes from fourth position almost universally involves rounded arm positions (e.g., first position, third position, etc.), not an open, allongé position.

    4.  **Conclusion:** The two institutions that both utilize an allongé arm position in their preparation for pirouettes from fourth are the Paris Opera Ballet School and the School of American Ballet.
