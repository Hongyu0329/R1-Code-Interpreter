    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the problem and identify the cardinal characteristic.
    # The problem defines a structure <x_alpha : alpha < delta>.
    # x_alpha is a subset of omega_2 with |x_alpha| = omega_2.
    # The condition "if alpha < beta < delta then |x_beta \ x_alpha| < omega_2"
    # means that x_beta is an "almost subset" of x_alpha. This defines a
    # decreasing sequence of sets under the almost-inclusion order (x_beta <=* x_alpha).
    #
    # The condition "there does not exist an omega_2-sized subset y ... such that
    # for every alpha < delta, |y \ x_alpha| < omega_2" means that there is no
    # lower bound 'y' for this entire sequence.
    #
    # This structure is a "tower", and the problem asks for the possible lengths delta.
    # The smallest possible delta for which such a tower exists is a cardinal
    # invariant known as the tower number, t(kappa). Here, kappa = omega_2.
    # So, the problem is to find the possible values for delta = t(omega_2).

    # Step 3: State the properties of the tower number.
    # According to ZFC set theory, for any regular cardinal kappa, the tower number
    # t(kappa) must satisfy:
    # 1. t(kappa) is a regular cardinal.
    # 2. kappa < t(kappa) <= 2^kappa.
    #
    # We apply this to kappa = omega_2, which is a regular cardinal.
    # So, delta = t(omega_2) must be a regular cardinal and omega_2 < delta <= 2^omega_2.

    # Step 4: Determine the sequence of possible values.
    # The cardinals greater than omega_2 are omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, etc.
    # All successor cardinals (like omega_3, omega_4, etc.) are regular.
    # So, the possible values for delta are regular cardinals from this sequence.

    # Step 5: Find the smallest and second smallest possible values for delta.
    # The smallest cardinal greater than omega_2 is omega_3.
    # omega_3 is regular. It is consistent with ZFC that t(omega_2) = omega_3
    # (this holds, for example, in any model of ZFC with the Generalized
    # Continuum Hypothesis, where 2^omega_2 = omega_3).
    # So, the smallest possible value for delta is omega_3.
    #
    # The next cardinal after omega_3 is omega_4.
    # omega_4 is also a regular cardinal. It is also consistent with ZFC that
    # t(omega_2) = omega_4. Advanced forcing techniques in set theory can
    # construct models of ZFC where this is the case.
    # Therefore, the second smallest possible value for delta is omega_4.
