    Calculates the correspondence chromatic number for the given graph.

    The graph is obtained from C_100 by replacing each edge with 1234 parallel edges.
    1. The resulting graph is a multigraph.
    2. The base graph C_100 is bipartite (since it's an even cycle), so the new graph is also bipartite.
    3. Each vertex in C_100 has degree 2. In the new graph, the degree of each vertex is d = 2 * 1234 = 2468.
       Thus, the graph is 2468-regular.
    4. A theorem states that for a d-regular bipartite multigraph (with d as a positive even integer),
       the correspondence chromatic number is d/2 + 1.
