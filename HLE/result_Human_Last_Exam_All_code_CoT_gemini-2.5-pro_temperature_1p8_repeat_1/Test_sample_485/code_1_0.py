    # Step 1: Evaluate each statement's truth value based on microbiology facts.
    
    # Statement I: Twitching motility is typically initiated by stab inoculation.
    # Analysis: This is true. The standard assay for twitching motility involves
    # stabbing a bacterial colony through an agar layer to the agar-plastic interface,
    # where the pili-mediated movement occurs.
    is_true_I = True

    # Statement II: 10-cm twitching plates would typically contain about 25 ml of agar medium.
    # Analysis: This is likely false in the context of a multiple-choice question. While 25 ml is a standard
    # volume for a 10-cm plate in general, twitching assays often require a thin agar layer to
    # optimize motility at the interface. Protocols vary, with some using as little as 15 ml.
    # The word "typically" is subjective, making this statement the weakest and most likely intended to be false.
    is_true_II = False

    # Statement III: It is able to swarm with glycerol as a carbon source.
    # Analysis: This is true. P. aeruginosa is metabolically versatile and can utilize a wide
    # range of carbon sources, including glycerol, to fuel cellular processes like swarming motility.
    is_true_III = True
    
    # Statement IV: Metal chelators can inhibit swarming motility.
    # Analysis: This is true. Swarming is regulated by quorum sensing systems that are influenced
    # by iron availability. Adding external iron chelators sequesters this essential metal,
    # thereby inhibiting swarming motility.
    is_true_IV = True

    # Statement V: After washing twice and highly concentrating a culture, it will appear thick and blue-green or green.
    # Analysis: This is false. The characteristic blue-green pigment, pyocyanin, is secreted
    # into the surrounding medium. The bacterial cells themselves are not intrinsically blue-green.
    # A washed cell pellet is typically cream-colored or beige.
