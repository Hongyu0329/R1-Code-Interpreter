    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information and Constants**:\n    *   Uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$.\n    *   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit, so the principal quantum number $n=1$.\n    *   We will use the following physical constants:\n        *   Reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar \\approx 1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$.\n        *   Bohr radius (radius of the first orbit), $a_0 \\approx 5.29177 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$)**:\n    *   According to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is given by the relation:\n        $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n    *   We will substitute the values of $\\hbar$ and $\\Delta x$ to find $\\Delta p$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Momentum of the Electron in the First Bohr Orbit ($p$)**:\n    *   In the Bohr model, the angular momentum of an electron in the $n$-th orbit is quantized: $L = mvr = n\\hbar$.\n    *   The linear momentum is $p = mv$. Therefore, $p \\cdot r = n\\hbar$.\n    *   For the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$), the radius is the Bohr radius ($r_1 = a_0$).\n    *   So, the momentum is $p = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\hbar}{a_0} = \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ratio**:\n    *   The required ratio is $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n    *   Substituting the expressions from the previous steps, we get:\n        Ratio = $\\frac{\\hbar / (2 \\Delta x)}{\\hbar / a_0} = \\frac{a_0}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n    *   We will compute this value using a Python script.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the final ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron\n    to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define physical constants and given values.\n    # Reduced Planck constant in J·s\n    hbar = 1.054571817e-34\n    # Bohr radius (radius of the first Bohr orbit) in meters\n    a0 = 5.29177210903e-11\n    # Given uncertainty in position in meters (10 pm = 10 * 10^-12 m)\n    delta_x = 10e-12\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n    # using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (Δp * Δx ≥ ħ/2).\n    # We calculate the minimum uncertainty.\n    delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the momentum (p) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n    # From Bohr's model, angular momentum L = p * r = n * ħ.\n    # For the first orbit (n=1), p = ħ / a₀.\n    p_bohr = hbar / a0\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final ratio of Δp to p.\n    ratio = delta_p / p_bohr\n\n    # Print the final result, showing each number in the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"The uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is: {delta_p:.5g} kg·m/s\")\n    print(f\"The momentum in the first Bohr orbit (p) is: {p_bohr:.5g} kg·m/s\")\n    print(\"\\nThe ratio (Δp / p) is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{delta_p} / {p_bohr} = {ratio}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_momentum_ratio()\n```\n<<<2.6458860545150004>>>"
