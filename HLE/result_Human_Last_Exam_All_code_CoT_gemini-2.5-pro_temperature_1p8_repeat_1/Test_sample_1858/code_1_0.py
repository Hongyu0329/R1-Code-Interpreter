# The problem asks for the number of connected components of the space of
# non-self-intersecting 6-sided polygons in R^3.

# Step 1: Understand the space.
# A non-self-intersecting polygon is a type of knot. Deforming a polygon
# without self-intersection means its knot type remains unchanged. The space of
# all such polygons with a fixed knot type is path-connected. Therefore, the
# number of connected components is the number of distinct knot types that
# can be formed with a 6-sided polygon.

# Step 2: Identify possible knot types.
# This requires finding all knot types with a "stick number" (minimum number
# of segments) of 6 or less.

# Let's list the knots by their stick number s(K):
# - s(K) < 6: Any closed polygon with 3, 4, or 5 sticks is always an "unknot".
#   So, we have the unknot as one possible type.
unknot_component = 1

# - s(K) = 6: It is a well-known result in knot theory that the only knot with a
#   stick number of 6 is the trefoil knot. The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning
#   it is distinct from its mirror image. This gives two more knot types.
right_trefoil_component = 1
left_trefoil_component = 1

# - s(K) > 6: Any other knot, like the figure-eight knot (s(K)=7), requires
#   more than 6 sticks and cannot be formed.

# Step 3: Sum the number of components.
# The total number of components is the sum of these distinct knot types.
total_components = unknot_component + right_trefoil_component + left_trefoil_component
