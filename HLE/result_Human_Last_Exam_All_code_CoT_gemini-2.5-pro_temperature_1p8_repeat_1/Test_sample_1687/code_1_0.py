    # Analysis of Key Clinical Findings:
    # 1. History: A 65-year-old woman post-difficult colonoscopy (no polypectomy).
    # 2. Symptoms: Onset of Left Upper Quadrant (LUQ) pain and left-shoulder pain (Kehr's sign).
    # 3. Vitals & Exam: Tachycardia, hypotension, abdominal distension, pallor. Signs of shock and internal bleeding.
    # 4. Labs: Drastic drop in hemoglobin from 11.7 g/dL to 6.5 g/dL, confirming severe hemorrhage.

    # Rationale for selecting the best option:
    # - Colonic perforation is less likely to cause this degree of rapid, massive bleeding.
    # - Lower GI bleeding would typically present with blood per rectum, which is not noted.
    # - Postpolypectomy syndrome is impossible as no polypectomy was performed.
    # - Splenic laceration is a known complication of difficult colonoscopy and perfectly explains the triad of LUQ pain, Kehr's sign, and signs of severe intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
