    print("For a connected topological space X, a point x in X is a 'dispersion point' if the space X \\ {x} (X without x) is totally disconnected.")
    print("A space is 'totally disconnected' if its only connected subsets are single points.")
    print("The question is: What is the maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points in a compact connected metric space?\n")

    print("--- The Answer ---")
    max_cardinality = 1
    print(f"The maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points is {max_cardinality}.")
    print("An example of a space that achieves this maximum is the Knaster-Kuratowski fan.\n")

    print("--- Proof Sketch (by Contradiction) ---")
    print("The reasoning below proves that the number of dispersion points cannot be two or more.")
    print("Let X be a compact connected metric space, and let's assume it has at least two dispersion points, p1 and p2.\n")

    print("Step 1: Pick three distinct points.")
    print("Since X is a non-trivial connected metric space, it must have infinitely many points. We can pick a third point, r, distinct from p1 and p2.\n")

    print("Step 2: Use the property of the first dispersion point, p1.")
    print("Since p1 is a dispersion point, the space X \\ {p1} is totally disconnected.")
    print("This means we can find a separation of X \\ {p1} for the points p2 and r. Let's say X \\ {p1} = U union V, where:")
    print("  - p2 is in U, and r is in V.")
    print("  - U and V are disjoint.")
    print("  - U and V are both open and closed in the subspace X \\ {p1}.\n")

    print("Step 3: Construct two closed sets whose union is X.")
    print("Let's define two sets in the original space X: A = U union {p1} and B = V union {p1}.")
    print("Because U and V are closed in X \\ {p1}, it can be shown that A and B are closed sets in X.")
    print("Their union is A union B = (U union {p1}) union (V union {p1}) = U union V union {p1} = (X \\ {p1}) union {p1} = X.")
    print("Their intersection is A intersect B = {p1}.\n")

    print("Step 4: Show that the set B must be connected.")
    print("A theorem in topology states that if a connected space X is written as the union of two closed sets (A and B), and their intersection (A intersect B) is connected, then both A and B must also be connected.")
    print("Here, A intersect B = {p1}, which is a connected set. Therefore, B must be connected.\n")

    print("Step 5: Use the property of the second dispersion point, p2.")
    print("Since p2 is a dispersion point, the space X \\ {p2} is totally disconnected.")
    print("Our set B = V union {p1}. By construction, p2 is in U, and U and V are disjoint, so p2 is not in V. Also, p2 is not p1.")
    print("Therefore, the set B does not contain p2. This means B is a subset of X \\ {p2}.\n")

    print("Step 6: The Contradiction.")
    print("Since B is a subset of the totally disconnected space X \\ {p2}, B itself must be totally disconnected.")
    print("From Step 4, we concluded that B is connected.")
    print("From Step 5, we concluded that B is totally disconnected.")
    print("A space can be both connected and totally disconnected only if it consists of a single point.")
    print("However, our set B = V union {p1}. It contains p1 and the point r (which is in V). Since p1 and r are distinct, B contains at least two points.")
    print("This is a contradiction. A set with at least two points cannot be a single point.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The contradiction arose from our initial assumption that there are at least two dispersion points.")
    print("Therefore, the assumption is false. A compact connected metric space can have at most one dispersion point.")
