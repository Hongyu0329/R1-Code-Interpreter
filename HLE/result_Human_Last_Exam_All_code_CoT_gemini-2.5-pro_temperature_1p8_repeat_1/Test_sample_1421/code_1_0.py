The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is:

Z = ∫ D[ψ̄]D[ψ] exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])

This formula can be broken down as follows:

- Z: The Partition Function of the fermionic system.

- ∫ D[ψ̄]D[ψ]: This represents the functional integral (or path integral) over all possible field configurations.
  - The fields ψ(τ) and ψ̄(τ) are Grassmann variables, which are anti-commuting numbers required to describe fermions.

- Boundary Conditions: The integral is performed over fields that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time τ, meaning ψ(β) = -ψ(0). This is a unique and crucial feature for fermions.

- exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ]): This is the statistical weight for each field configuration.

- S_E[ψ̄, ψ]: This is the Euclidean action of the system. For a general system of fermions described by a single-particle Hamiltonian 'h', the action is defined as the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian:

  S_E = ∫ from 0 to β dτ [ ψ̄(τ) (∂_τ + h) ψ(τ) ]

  Here:
    - β is the inverse temperature, β = 1 / (k_B * T).
    - τ is imaginary time, running from 0 to β.
    - ∂_τ is the partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.
    - h is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator of the system.

Combining these components gives the full expression:

Z = ∫ D[ψ̄]D[ψ] exp[ - ∫ from 0 to β dτ  ψ̄(τ) (∂_τ + h) ψ(τ) ]
