    "This task requires tracing a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root through several stages of the Germanic language family. I will apply established rules of historical phonology to determine the form in each language.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the PIE root:** The provided form is `*seh₂gieti`, based on the root `*seh₂g-`.\n2.  **Proto-Germanic (PGmc):** The descendant verbs for 'to seek' in Germanic (e.g., English 'seek', German 'suchen') derive from the Proto-Germanic `*sōkijaną`. This form uses the o-grade of the PIE root (`*soh₂g-`) and shows the effect of Grimm's Law, where the PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes a voiceless stop `*k`. The PIE vowel combination `*o` + laryngeal `*h₂` yields the long vowel `*ō` in Proto-Germanic.\n3.  **Old Norse (ON):** I will apply i-umlaut, where the `/j/` in `*sōkijaną` fronts the root vowel `*ō` to `œ`. The verb ending will also be updated to the standard Old Norse infinitive.\n4.  **Old English (OE):** I will apply i-umlaut as well. In Old English, i-umlaut of `*ō` results in `œ̄`, which then simplifies to `ē`. The `/j/` is lost after causing this change in a long-syllable verb. The ending is updated to the Old English infinitive `-an`.\n5.  **Old High German (OHG):** Two major changes occur here. First, the High German Consonant Shift changes the PGmc `*k` to the voiceless fricative `hh` (often spelled `ch`). Second, the PGmc long vowel `*ō` is \"broken\" into the diphthong `uo`. The infinitive ending becomes `-an`.\n\nFinally, the Python code will assign each of these derived forms to a variable and print them in a single line representing the etymological development.\n\n```python\ndef trace_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script traces a PIE root through its development into various Germanic languages.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
