# The Lojban term "rusybavlamdei" is a compound word (lujvo).
# Let's break it down to understand its meaning and the roles of its arguments.
# 1. Deconstruction:
#    - rusy: from 'grusy' (gray)
#    - bav: from 'bapli' (future)
#    - lam: from 'mlana' (adjacent, side)
#    - dei: from 'djedi' (day / duration in days)
# The head of the compound is 'djedi'.

# 2. Place Structure of the Head ('djedi'):
#    'djedi' has a key place structure for duration:
#    d1 is a quantity (number) of full days of event d2 by standard d3.

# 3. Interpretation of the Lujvo's Structure:
#    The modifiers (gray, future, adjacent) describe the 'event' (d2), not the number of days (d1).
#    This implies that the event (d2) becomes the main subject (x1) of the new word 'rusybavlamdei'.
#    This is an implicit conversion, making the lujvo behave like it's based on 'se djedi'.
#    The place structure of 'se djedi' is:
#    x1 is an event (formerly d2)
#    x2 is the duration in days (formerly d1)
#    x3 is the standard (formerly d3)

# 4. Final Place Structure of "rusybavlamdei":
#    rusybavlamdei x1 x2 x3
#    - x1 is the event being described.
#    - x2 is the number of full days the event lasts.
#    - x3 is the day standard for counting.

# 5. Matching with the Answer Choice:
#    We need the interpretation of the second (x2) and third (x3) arguments.
#    - x2: the number of full days of the event x1.
#    - x3: the day standard.
#    This corresponds directly to choice E.

analysis_of_x2 = "is the number of full days corresponding to x1"
analysis_of_x3 = "is the 'day standard'"

print("Based on grammatical analysis, the most likely interpretation is:")
print(f"The second argument (x2) {analysis_of_x2}.")
print(f"The third argument (x3) {analysis_of_x3}.")
print("\nThis matches Answer Choice E.")
