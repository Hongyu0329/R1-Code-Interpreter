# Parameters from the problem description
n = 2025
# A_j and B_j are constant for all j
A = 10**15
B = 10**20

# Step 1: Theoretical Derivation Summary
# The problem is solved using perturbation theory. The solvability condition for the first-order approximation
# imposes constraints on the initial values of the zeroth-order solution (x_j^0, y_j^0).
# The condition is: (Sum_{j!=i} [(x_j^0/A_j)^2 + (y_j^0/B_j)^2]) * (1 - e^-T) = alpha_i^2.

# Step 2: Addressing the dependence on T
# The problem states alpha_i = 1 - e^-T. This leads to a solution dependent on the unknown T.
# To obtain a specific numerical value as requested, we assume a likely typo in the problem,
# where alpha_i^2 = 1 - e^-T was intended. This is a common structure for such problems.
# With this assumption, the condition simplifies to: Sum_{j!=i} [(x_j^0/A_j)^2 + (y_j^0/B_j)^2] = 1.

# Step 3: Solving the system of conditions
# This results in a system of n linear equations for C_j = (x_j^0/A_j)^2 + (y_j^0/B_j)^2.
# The solution is C_j = 1 / (n - 1) for all j = 1, ..., n.
# So, for each j, the initial values must satisfy: (x_j^0/A_j)^2 + (y_j^0/B_j)^2 = 1 / (n - 1).

# Step 4: Calculating the areas
# This equation describes an ellipse in the (x_j^0, y_j^0) plane.
# The area of the j-th ellipse is Area_j = pi * (A_j * sqrt(1/(n-1))) * (B_j * sqrt(1/(n-1)))
# Area_j = pi * A_j * B_j / (n - 1).
# S is the sum of these areas: S = sum(Area_j for j=1 to n) = n * pi * A * B / (n - 1).

# Step 5: Final Calculation
# The problem asks for the value of S / (2025 * pi).
# Since n = 2025, this is S / (n * pi).
# Value = (n * pi * A * B / (n - 1)) / (n * pi) = (A * B) / (n - 1).
