# Step 1: Define the properties of the original nanocar molecule.
# The chemical formula for the well-known nanocar is C384H428.
num_carbon_atoms = 384
num_hydrogen_atoms = 428

# Step 2: Understand the term "perfluoronanocar".
# The prefix "perfluoro-" means every hydrogen atom (H) is replaced by a fluorine atom (F).
# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in the new molecule is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original.
num_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms

# Step 3: Print the logic and the final result, showing each number in the process.
