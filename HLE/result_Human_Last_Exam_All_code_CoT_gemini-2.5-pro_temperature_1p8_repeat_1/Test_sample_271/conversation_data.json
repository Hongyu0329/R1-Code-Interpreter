    "To solve this problem, we need to find the Galois group of the splitting field $K$ of the polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. According to the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, the normal subfields $L$ correspond to normal subgroups of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The degree of such an extension, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$, is equal to the index of the corresponding normal subgroup in $G$.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Factor the Polynomial:** First, we factor the given polynomial $P(x)$ into its irreducible factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This will simplify the problem into finding the Galois groups for simpler polynomials.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group:** We find the Galois group for the splitting field of each irreducible factor. The Galois group of $P(x)$ will be the direct product of these individual groups, provided their splitting fields have a trivial intersection ($\\mathbb{Q}$).\n3.  **Identify Normal Subgroups and Compute Indices:** We model the resulting Galois group $G$ using Python's `sympy` library. Then, we programmatically construct all of its normal subgroups. For each proper, non-trivial normal subgroup $H$, we compute its index, which is $|G| / |H|$.\n4.  **List the Degrees:** The set of all such indices will give us the list of all possible degrees for the normal subfields $L$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out these steps:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import SymmetricGroup, AlternatingGroup, CyclicGroup\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.perm_groups import PermutationGroup\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all possible degrees of normal field extensions L/Q where Q < L < K,\n    with K being the splitting field of P(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Factor the polynomial and determine the Galois Group.\n    # The polynomial P(x) factors as (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3).\n    # The splitting field of x^2 - 2 is Q(sqrt(2)) with Galois group C_2.\n    # The polynomial x^5 - 9x + 3 is irreducible over Q (by Eisenstein's criterion for p=3).\n    # It has 3 real roots and 2 complex roots, so its Galois group is S_5.\n    # The intersection of the two splitting fields is Q, so the Galois group G of P(x)\n    # is the direct product C_2 x S_5.\n    \n    C2 = CyclicGroup(2)\n    S5 = SymmetricGroup(5)\n    A5 = AlternatingGroup(5)\n    \n    # We represent G as a permutation group on 7 elements {0, 1, ..., 6}.\n    # Let C2 act on {0, 1} and S5 act on {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    \n    def map_perm(p, shift):\n        \"\"\"Maps a permutation p to act on a shifted set of elements.\"\"\"\n        new_array = list(range(p.size + shift))\n        p_array = p.array_form\n        for i, v in enumerate(p_array):\n            new_array[i + shift] = v + shift\n        return Permutation(new_array)\n\n    # Permutation groups corresponding to C2 and S5 acting on disjoint sets\n    c2_gen_p = Permutation(0, 1)\n    C2_p = PermutationGroup([c2_gen_p])\n    \n    s5_gens_p = [map_perm(gen, 2) for gen in S5.generators]\n    S5_p = PermutationGroup(s5_gens_p)\n    \n    a5_gens_p = [map_perm(gen, 2) for gen in A5.generators]\n    A5_p = PermutationGroup(a5_gens_p)\n\n    # The full Galois group G and its order\n    G = PermutationGroup(C2_p.generators + S5_p.generators)\n    G_order = G.order() # Should be 2 * 120 = 240\n\n    # Step 3: Identify normal subgroups H and compute their indices [G:H].\n    # Normal subgroups of G = C2 x S5 are of two types:\n    # 1.
