    explanation = """
The problem asks for the smallest non-negative integer n such that the property (Rn) is not preserved by the m-adic completion of a Noetherian local ring (A, m).

1.  Definition of (Rn): A Noetherian ring A has property (Rn) if for every prime ideal p of A with height at most n, the localization A_p is a regular local ring.

2.  Analysis for n = 0:
    The property (R0) requires that for every minimal prime p (height 0), the ring A_p is a field. This property is always preserved when passing from a ring A to its completion Â. Thus, n cannot be 0.

3.  Analysis for n = 1:
    The property (R1) is not always preserved under completion. A famous counterexample was constructed by M. Nagata:
    - He created a 2-dimensional normal Noetherian local domain A.
    - Since A is normal, it satisfies Serre's condition (R1).
    - However, the completion of this ring, Â, is not (R1). This is due to one of its 'formal fibres' being non-reduced, which, by a criterion from Grothendieck, implies that Â fails to be (R1).
    - This provides a case where A is (R1), but Â is not (R1).

4.  Conclusion:
    Since the property is preserved for n = 0 but not for n = 1, the smallest non-negative integer for which (Rn) is not preserved is 1. While counterexamples also exist for n = 2 and higher, the question specifically asks for the smallest such integer.
