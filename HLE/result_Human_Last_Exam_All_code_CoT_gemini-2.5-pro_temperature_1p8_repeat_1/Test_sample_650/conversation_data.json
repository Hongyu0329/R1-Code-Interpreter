    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we need to analyze the number of operations the algorithm performs with respect to the input size, which is primarily determined by the integer `n`.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Initialization**\n    The first step initializes a few variables: `i`, `x`, `q`, and `a_0`. This involves a fixed number of basic arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, subtraction) and assignments. The time taken for this step is constant and does not depend on the size of `n`. Therefore, the complexity of Step 1 is O(1).\n\n2.  **Step 2: The `while` loop**\n    This is the most significant part of the algorithm. We need to determine how many times the loop runs and how much work is done in each iteration.\n    *   **Work per iteration:** Inside the `while` loop (steps 2.1 and 2.2), a constant number of operations are performed: an increment, an assignment, a division (`⌊x/c⌋`), a multiplication (`qc`), and a subtraction (`x - qc`). Since the number of operations is fixed for each iteration, the work done per iteration is O(1).\n    *   **Number of iterations:** The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. In each iteration, the value of `x` is set to the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`. This means that the value being processed is effectively divided by `c` in each iteration. The loop will stop when the value of `q` becomes 0, which happens when `x` becomes less than `c`.\n    The number of times we can divide `n` by `c` until the result is less than 1 is given by the logarithm `log_c(n)`. Therefore, the loop will execute `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Return value**\n    This step simply returns the result. The time taken is negligible.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe total time complexity is the number of iterations multiplied by the complexity of each iteration.\n`Total Complexity = (Number of Iterations) * (Work per Iteration)`\n`Total Complexity = O(log_c(n)) * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`\n\nAccording to the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log(c)` is also a constant. In Big O notation, we ignore constant factors. Thus, the complexity `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\nThe Python code below implements the described algorithm. For a given `n` and `c`, it calculates the digits of the base-c representation and prints the final verification equation, showing all the numbers involved.\n\n```python\ndef represent_in_base(n, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements the IMAG(n, c) algorithm to find the representation of\n    a number n in base c.
