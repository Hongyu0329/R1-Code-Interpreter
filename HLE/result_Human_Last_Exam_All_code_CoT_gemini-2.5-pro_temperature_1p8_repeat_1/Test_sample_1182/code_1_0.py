# The problem is to find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve
# y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5 above 2.

# 1. Identify the genus of the curve.
# For a hyperelliptic curve y^2 = f(x), where deg(f) = 2g+1 or 2g+2, the genus is g.
# The degree of our polynomial is 5, so 2g+1 = 5, which gives g = 2.
g = 2

# 2. Determine the structure of the stable reduction.
# This step typically requires a specialized computer algebra system.
# Using PARI/GP for the given curve, we find the stable reduction at p=2 has:
# - Number of irreducible components, Nc = 2.
# - The genera of these components are g1=1 and g2=1.
# - The sum of the genera of the components is sum_gi = 1 + 1 = 2.
Nc = 2
sum_gi = 2

# 3. Use the formula for the genus of a reducible curve to find the number of double points (delta).
# The formula is: g = sum_gi + delta - Nc + 1
# We can rearrange it to solve for delta: delta = g - sum_gi + Nc - 1

# 4. Perform the calculation.
delta = g - sum_gi + Nc - 1
