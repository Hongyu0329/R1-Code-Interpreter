    "This is a historical/art history question, not a coding task, so I will provide a direct answer based on my knowledge.\n\nHere is my plan to answer the question:\n1.  Identify the specific self-portrait by Curt Querner from the period mentioned (1933, after his arrest).\n2.  Examine descriptions and analyses of this painting to determine what object he is holding.\n3.  Explain the symbolic meaning of the object in the context of his experience with the Gestapo and his resistance to the Nazi regime.\n4.  Provide a concise final answer in the requested format.\n\nThe painting in question is Querner's \"Self-Portrait with Thistle\" (Selbstbildnis mit Distel), painted in 1932 or 1933. After being arrested and interrogated by the SA (who would be integrated into the Gestapo system), he painted himself with a defiant expression. In his hand, he holds a large thistle plant. The prickly, resilient thistle serves as a powerful symbol of his unbroken will, defiance, and inner resistance against the brutality of the Nazi regime.\n\n<<<A thistle>>>"
