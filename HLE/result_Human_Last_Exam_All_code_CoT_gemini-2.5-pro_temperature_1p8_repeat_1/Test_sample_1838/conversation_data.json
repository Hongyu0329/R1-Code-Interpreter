    "To find the central pixel of the line from (1, 1) to (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixel coordinates that lie on this line. After generating the complete list of pixels, we can find the one in the middle.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify line parameters**: The line starts at (x1, y1) = (1, 1) and ends at (x2, y2) = (11, 5). We calculate the horizontal and vertical distances: `dx = x2 - x1 = 10` and `dy = y2 - y1 = 4`. Since `dx > dy`, the line has a shallow slope, and we will step along the x-axis for each point and decide when to increment the y-axis.\n2.  **Generate all pixels**: We will implement Bresenham's algorithm, starting from (1, 1). The algorithm will generate a sequence of 11 pixels (`dx + 1` points).\n3.  **Find the central pixel**: The list of pixels will have 11 elements. The central element in a list of 11 items is the 6th one (at index 5, using 0-based indexing).\n4.  **Execute the code**: The following Python code implements this logic. It generates the list of pixels, identifies the central one, and prints its coordinates.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel_bresenham(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the central pixel of a line using Bresenham's algorithm.\n    This implementation is for lines with a positive slope less than 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate deltas\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # Initialize decision parameter\n    # This is for a shallow slope (dx > dy)\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n\n    # List to store the coordinates of all pixels on the line\n    line_pixels = []\n\n    # Initialize current coordinates\n    x, y = x1, y1\n\n    # Add the starting point to the list\n    line_pixels.append((x, y))\n\n    # Iterate from start x to end x\n    while x < x2:\n        x += 1\n        if p < 0:\n            # Move to the next pixel without changing y\n            p = p + 2 * dy\n        else:\n            # Move to the next pixel and increment y\n            y += 1\n            p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx\n        \n        line_pixels.append((x, y))\n\n    # The list of pixels is now generated.
