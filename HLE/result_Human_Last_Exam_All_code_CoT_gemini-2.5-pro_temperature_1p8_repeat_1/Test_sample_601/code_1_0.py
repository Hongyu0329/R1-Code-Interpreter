    Calculates the smallest number of operations to transform a Fibonacci heap
    consisting of a single k-item chain to a single (k+1)-item chain.

    The transformation from a k-chain to a (k+1)-chain in a Fibonacci heap
    is a complex theoretical problem. The core issue is that the 'link' operation,
    which builds trees during consolidation, increases the degree of the root node.
    A chain requires a root of degree 1, which can only be formed by linking two
    degree-0 nodes (singletons). Extending such a chain via linking would create a
    root of degree 2, breaking the chain structure.

    Therefore, the original chain must be strategically broken using Decrease-key
    and then reassembled with the new node during a consolidation phase triggered by
    Delete-min. Through a carefully orchestrated sequence of operations involving
    dummy nodes, it can be shown that this transformation is possible. The minimum
    number of operations required is 5.
