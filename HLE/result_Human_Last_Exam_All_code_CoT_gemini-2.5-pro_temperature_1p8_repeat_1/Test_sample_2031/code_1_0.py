    print("The metaphor of opals for her eyes suggests that looking into them would be like looking into an opal. You wouldn't see one clear image, but rather shifting flashes of color, representing different memories from the depths of her past flickering to the surface.")

    print("This perfectly matches the idea of 'The shifting depth of memories', as it captures both the layered history ('depth') and the dynamic, unpredictable way these memories are now returning ('shifting').")
