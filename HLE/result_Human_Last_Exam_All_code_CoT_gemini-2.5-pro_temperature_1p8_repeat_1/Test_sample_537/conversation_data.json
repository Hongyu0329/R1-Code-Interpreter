    "I have analyzed the pattern in the provided list of words. The series of words seems to encode a mathematical equation.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  The first three words, `utpshtheas`, `fkuhu`, and `numhkatnatu`, seem to represent the numbers 8, 5, and 3 respectively.\n2.  I discovered this pattern by observing a common type of sequence puzzle. The relationship between these numbers forms a simple subtraction equation: `8 - 5 = 3`.\n3.  Following this pattern, the next logical step in the sequence is to perform the next subtraction: `5 - 3 = 2`.\n4.  Therefore, the final word, `anhaeketn`, must represent the number 2. The English word for this is \"TWO\".\n5.  The prompt requires printing the final equation, which is `5 - 3 = 2`.\n\nBased on this logic, the Python code below will print out the numbers in the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the puzzle based on the observed mathematical sequence.\n    The pattern is deduced from the first three items:\n    1st item resolves to 8.\n    2nd item resolves to 5.\n    3rd item resolves to 3.\n    This implies an equation: 8 - 5 = 3.\n\n    The pattern continues with the next logical equation in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The numbers from the sequence\n    num1 = 5\n    num2 = 3\n    \n    # The next step in the sequence\n    result = num1 - num2\n    \n    # The final decoded word corresponds to the result '2', which is 'TWO'.\n    # The prompt asks for each number in the final equation to be printed.\n    \n    print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
