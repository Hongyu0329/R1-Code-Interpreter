    # The problem is to find the order type of the set X of possible cardinalities
    # of maximal almost disjoint (MAD) families on ω, assuming 2^ω = ω_1 (CH).

    # Step 1: Characterize the set X of cardinalities.
    # A MAD family A is a set of infinite subsets of ω.
    # Its cardinality κ = |A| must be less than or equal to |P(ω)| = 2^ω.
    # It's a known result that MAD families must be infinite, so κ >= ω.
    # So, for any κ in X, we have ω <= κ <= 2^ω.

    # Step 2: Apply the Continuum Hypothesis (CH).
    # The given assumption is 2^ω = ω_1.
    # This implies that for any κ in X, ω <= κ <= ω_1.
    # The only cardinal numbers in this range are ω and ω_1.
    # Thus, X is a subset of {ω, ω_1}.

    # Step 3: Verify that these cardinalities are achievable.
    # We use standard theorems from ZFC set theory.
    # - Existence of a MAD family of size ω:
    #   It's a theorem in ZFC that a MAD family of size ω exists.
    #   This means ω is a possible cardinality.
    # - Existence of a MAD family of size ω_1 (under CH):
    #   It's a theorem in ZFC that a MAD family of size 2^ω exists.
    #   Given CH (2^ω = ω_1), this means a MAD family of size ω_1 exists.
    #   This means ω_1 is a possible cardinality.

    # Step 4: Final determination of the set X.
    # From the above, the set of possible cardinalities is X = {ω, ω_1}.
    set_X = {"ω", "ω_1"}

    # Step 5: Determine the order type of X.
    # X = {ω, ω_1} is ordered by the usual ordering of cardinal numbers: ω < ω_1.
    # An order type of a well-ordered set is the unique ordinal it's isomorphic to.
    # The ordered set (X, <) has two elements. It is order-isomorphic to the
    # set {0, 1} with its usual order.
    # This set represents the ordinal number 2.
    order_type = 2

    # Printing the elements involved and the conclusion.
    # Python 3.7+ guarantees dictionary insertion order preservation
    # but using a list makes the order explicit.
    elements_of_X = ["ω", "ω_1"]

    print(f"Under the Continuum Hypothesis (2^ω = ω_1), the set of possible cardinalities of maximal almost disjoint families is X = {{{', '.join(elements_of_X)}}}.")
    print(f"The set X is ordered by magnitude: {elements_of_X[0]} < {elements_of_X[1]}.")
    print(f"This is a well-ordered set with two elements.")
    print(f"Its order type is the ordinal number it is order-isomorphic to, which is 2.")
