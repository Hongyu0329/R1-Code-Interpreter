    "An elegant way to solve this is to express the infinite product in terms of the Gamma function, a generalization of the factorial function. Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Factor the general term**: The term inside the product, `1 - z^3/n^3`, can be factored using the roots of unity. The cube roots of 1 are $1$, $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$, and $\\omega^2 = e^{4\\pi i/3}$. This allows us to write:\n    $$ 1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Relate to the Gamma function**: The infinite product from $n=1$ is related to the Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function. A known identity is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)\\Gamma(1-x\\omega)\\Gamma(1-x\\omega^2)} $$\n    where $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.\n\n3.  **Adjust the product range**: The problem asks for the product starting from $n=3$. We can express this by taking the product from $n=1$ and dividing by the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty} = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}}{\\left(1 - \\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n4.  **Substitute and simplify**: Substituting the Gamma function identity and factoring the denominator terms yields:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)(1-z^3/8) \\cdot \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n    Using the recurrence relation of the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(x+1) = x\\Gamma(x)$, the denominator can be greatly simplified. For example, $(1-z)(1-z/2)\\Gamma(1-z)$ simplifies to $\\frac{\\Gamma(3-z)}{2}$.\n\n5.  **Final Expression**: After simplification, the entire expression remarkably condenses to:\n    $$ \\frac{8}{\\Gamma(3-z)\\Gamma(3-z\\omega)\\Gamma(3-z\\omega^2)} $$\n    This is the final symbolic answer.\n\nThe following Python code will print this final equation, clearly indicating all the numerical constants involved as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs and prints the symbolic expression for the infinite product\n    prod_{n=3 to inf} (1 - z^3 / n^3).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The numbers that appear in the simplified final equation are 8, 3, 2, and 3.\n    # We will construct the string representation of the formula.\n    numerator = 8\n    gamma_arg_const = 3\n    omega_num = 2\n    omega_den = 3\n\n    # Symbolic variables\n    z = \"z\"\n    Gamma = \"Gamma\"\n    pi = \"pi\"\n    i = \"i\"\n\n    # String for omega and omega squared\n    w = f\"exp({omega_num}*{pi}*{i}/{omega_den})\"\n    w_squared = f\"exp({2*omega_num}*{pi}*{i}/{omega_den})\"\n\n    # Building the denominator string part by part\n    term1 = f\"{Gamma}({gamma_arg_const} - {z})\"\n    term2 = f\"{Gamma}({gamma_arg_const} - {z}*{w})\"\n    term3 = f\"{Gamma}({gamma_arg_const} - {z}*{w_squared})\"\n\n    denominator = f\"{term1} * {term2} * {term3}\"\n\n    # Final equation as a string\n    final_equation = f\"{numerator} / ({denominator})\"\n\n    # Print the result.\n    # The output shows the final equation with all its numbers.\n    print(final_equation)\n\nsolve_infinite_product()\n```\n<<<8 / (Gamma(3 - z) * Gamma(3 - z*exp(2*pi*i/3)) * Gamma(3 - z*exp(4*pi*i/3)))>>>"
