    Analyzes whether Kant's account of judgment in the Critique of Judgment
    is purely descriptive or also normative.

    Kant's account is descriptive because it details the cognitive faculties
    (imagination, understanding) and their 'free play' in aesthetic judgment.

    However, it is also normative for a key reason: the claim to universality.
    When one judges something to be beautiful, Kant argues they are not just
    stating a personal preference but are speaking with a 'universal voice,'
    implying that everyone else *ought* to agree. This 'ought' establishes a
    standard or a norm for valid aesthetic judgment.

    Therefore, the account is not purely descriptive.
