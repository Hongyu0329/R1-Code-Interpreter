    "To determine the number of primitive Gaussians in the 6-311G** basis set, we need to analyze the notation and apply it to different types of atoms, as the total count depends on the element. I will provide a Python script that calculates and explains the breakdown for both a Hydrogen atom and a representative \"heavy\" atom (any atom from the second row, like Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the 6-311G** notation**:\n    *   `6-`: Core electrons are described by one function composed of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   `-311`: Valence electrons are described using a triple-split basis. One basis function is a sum of **3** primitives, the second is **1** primitive, and the third is **1** primitive.\n    *   `G`: Stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n    *   First `*`: Adds a set of **d-type polarization functions** to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. A set of Cartesian d-functions consists of 6 individual primitives (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   Second `*`: Adds a set of **p-type polarization functions** to hydrogen atoms. A set of p-functions consists of 3 primitives (p_x, p_y, p_z).\n\n2.  **Calculate Primitives per Atom Type**:\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H)**: It has no core electrons. The `311` split applies to its 1s valence orbital (3+1+1=5 primitives). The second `*` adds 3 p-type primitives.\n    *   **For a Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)**: It has both core and valence electrons. The calculation will sum the primitives for the core (1s), valence (2s and 2p), and polarization functions.\n\nThe following Python script implements this logic and prints a detailed breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_basis_set_primitives():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G**\n    basis set for Hydrogen and a representative heavy atom from the second row.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set.\")\n    print(\"The final count depends on the atom type.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Calculation for a Hydrogen atom ---\n    print(\"--- For a Hydrogen Atom (H) ---\")\n    \n    # Hydrogen has only a valence 1s orbital, which gets the '311' split.\n    s_primitives_h = 3 + 1 + 1\n    print(f\"Valence (1s): The '311' split means there are {s_primitives_h} s-type primitives (from 3+1+1).\")\n    \n    # The second '*' in '**' adds p-functions to Hydrogen.
