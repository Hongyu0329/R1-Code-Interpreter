    # 1. Any triangle of 3 Red points contains a Green point.
    # 2. Any triangle of 3 Green points contains a Yellow point.
    # 3. Any triangle of 3 Yellow points contains a Red point.

    # That is, we cannot have n_R >= 3, n_G >= 3, and n_Y >= 3 all at the same time.

    # the convex hull of all points while also being contained within a triangle of other points).
