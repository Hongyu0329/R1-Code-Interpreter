Then, I will construct and print a sentence that directly answers the user's question using these variables.\n\n```python\n# Information about the artwork and its acquisition\nartist = \"Kurt Günther\"\npainting_title = \"The Radionist\"\ncreation_year = 1927\nacquisition_year = 1967\nacquiring_museum = \"Galerie Neue Meister, part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden\"\n\n# Constructing the final answer string\noutput = (\n    f\"In {acquisition_year}, the museum that acquired the {creation_year} tempera painting \"\n    f\"'{painting_title}' by {artist} was the {acquiring_museum}.\"\n)\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(output)\n```\n<<<Galerie Neue Meister, part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which museum acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
