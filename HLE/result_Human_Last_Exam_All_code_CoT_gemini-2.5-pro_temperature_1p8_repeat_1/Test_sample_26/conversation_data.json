    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we will use a chain of results from algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.\n\n### My Plan:\n1.  **Identify Topological Properties of X**: Note that $X$ is a 2-dimensional complex manifold, which corresponds to a 4-dimensional real manifold. It is also compact and orientable.\n2.  **Apply the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem**: This theorem relates the topology of $X$ to the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. We'll use it to determine the first Betti number, $b_1(X)$, which will show that $X$ is simply connected.\n3.  **Use Poincaré Duality**: Since $X$ is a compact, orientable 4-manifold, we can relate its third Betti number, $b_3(X)$, to its first Betti number, $b_1(X)$.\n4.  **Connect Homotopy and Homology**: For simply connected spaces, there is a close relationship between homotopy groups and homology groups. We'll use this to relate the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ to the Betti number $b_3(X)$.\n5.  **Synthesize and Calculate**: By combining these steps, we can deduce the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\nThe following Python code walks through these steps to arrive at the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) for a smooth\n    quintic hypersurface X in CP^3 by laying out the logical argument.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters of the problem\n    ambient_space_dim = 3  # Ambient space is CP^n where n=3\n    hypersurface_degree = 5    # The hypersurface has degree d=5 (quintic)\n\n    # Dimensionality of the hypersurface X\n    # X is a submanifold of CP^3 of complex codimension 1.\n    complex_dim_X = ambient_space_dim - 1\n    # As a real manifold, its dimension is twice its complex dimension.\n    real_dim_X = 2 * complex_dim_X\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the fundamental group of X using the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem.\")\n    print(\"Let X be a smooth hypersurface in CP^n.\")\n    print(f\"In our case, X is a hypersurface in CP^{ambient_space_dim}, so its complex dimension is {complex_dim_X}.\")\n    print(\"The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for homotopy groups states that the inclusion\")\n    print(f\"map X -> CP^{ambient_space_dim} induces isomorphisms pi_k(X) -> pi_k(CP^{ambient_space_dim}) for k < {complex_dim_X}.\")\n    print(f\"For k=1, we have pi_1(X) isomorphic to pi_1(CP^{ambient_space_dim}).\")\n    # pi_1(CP^n) is trivial for all n >= 1.\n    pi_1_CPn_rank = 0\n    print(f\"Since pi_1(CP^{ambient_space_dim}) is trivial (rank {pi_1_CPn_rank}), pi_1(X) must also be trivial.\")\n    print(\"This means X is simply connected.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Relate the Betti numbers of X using Poincaré Duality.\")\n    print(f\"X is a compact, orientable real manifold of dimension {real_dim_X}.\")\n    print(\"Poincaré Duality states that b_k(X) = b_{n-k}(X), where n is the real dimension.\")\n    # We are interested in b_3(X)\n    k = 3\n    dual_k = real_dim_X - k\n    print(f\"For k={k}, we have b_{k}(X) = b_{{{real_dim_X}-{k}}}(X) = b_{dual_k}(X).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the value of the Betti numbers.\")\n    print(\"From Step 1, since pi_1(X) is trivial, its abelianization, H_1(X, Z), is also trivial.\")\n    # b_1(X) is the rank of H_1(X, Z).\n    b_1_X = 0\n    print(f\"Therefore, the first Betti number, b_1(X), is {b_1_X}.\")\n    # From Step 2, b_3(X) = b_1(X)\n    b_3_X = b_1_X\n    print(f\"Using the duality from Step 2, we find b_3(X) = b_1(X) = {b_3_X}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Relate the rank of the homotopy group to the Betti number.\")\n    print(\"For a simply connected space like X, the Hurewicz Theorem implies that\")\n    print(\"the rank of the k-th homotopy group is equal to the k-th Betti number for k > 1.\")\n    # The rank of pi_3(X) is b_3(X).\n    rank_pi_3_X = b_3_X\n    print(\"So, rank(pi_3(X)) = b_3(X).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Conclusion: Final Calculation.\")\n    print(\"Combining our findings, we can construct the final equation:\")\n    # Using f-string to clearly display the final chain of reasoning and calculation\n    print(f\"rank(pi_3(X)) = b_3(X) = b_1(X) = {rank_pi_3_X}\")\n\nsolve_homotopy_rank()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
