    1.  High temperature causes a rapid increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), creating oxidative stress.
    2.  The cell's first and most rapid defense against a sudden surge of ROS is its enzymatic system.
    3.  Enzymes like Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) are the primary front-line defenders. SOD rapidly converts superoxide radicals, and CAT then neutralizes the resulting hydrogen peroxide.
    4.  This enzymatic response is characteristically faster than the synthesis or mobilization of non-enzymatic antioxidants (liposoluble or hydrosoluble).
    5.  Therefore, the enzymatic antioxidants are the ones 'initially activated'.
