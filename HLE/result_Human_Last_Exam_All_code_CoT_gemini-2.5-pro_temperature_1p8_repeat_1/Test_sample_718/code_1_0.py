    print("Step 1: The structure of J as an 'upper semilattice' is crucial. By definition, any pair of elements {a, b} in J has a unique least upper bound (a 'join'). This property forbids J from containing certain sub-structures, specifically the 'four-point crown' (a poset with four points a,b,c,d and relations a<c, b<c, a<d, b<d), because in the crown the pair {a, b} has two minimal upper bounds (c and d), not a unique least one.")
    print("\nStep 2: The problem specifies a 'tame functor'. In this context, this means the poset J is of 'tame representation type'. This is a classification that constrains the complexity of its indecomposable representations.")
    print("\nStep 3: A key theorem by Nazarova, extended by Loupias and others, connects the representation type of a poset to the global dimension of its category of representations (Fun(J, Vect_K)). The theorem states: A poset is of tame representation type if and only if the global dimension of its representation category is at most 2, *provided* that the poset does not contain the 'four-point crown'.")
    print("\nStep 4: From Step 1, we know J (as an upper semilattice) does not contain the crown. From Step 2, we know J is of tame type. Therefore, the theorem applies directly, and we can conclude that the global dimension of the category Fun(J, Vect_K) is at most 2.")
    print("\nStep 5: The global dimension of a category is the maximum possible projective dimension of any object (functor) within it. So, for our functor f, its projective dimension must be less than or equal to 2 (i.e., proj.dim(f) <= 2).")
    print("\nStep 6: A functor f is n-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length n. Since the projective dimension of f is at most 2, it is guaranteed to have a resolution of length 2 (where some terms could be zero if the dimension is smaller).")
