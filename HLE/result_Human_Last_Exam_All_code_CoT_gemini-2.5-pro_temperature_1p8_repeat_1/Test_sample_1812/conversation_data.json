    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the provided 3x3 matrix `A`. The information about \\(m_{1/2} = 13\\) is not relevant to the calculation since the matrix `A` is explicitly given. I will use Python for this task.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \na & b & c \\\\ \nd & e & f \\\\ \ng & h & i \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis calculated by the formula: `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n\nThe Python script will:\n1.  Define the matrix `A` using the `numpy` library.\n2.  Extract the individual elements (a, b, c, etc.).\n3.  Calculate the determinant by breaking it down into steps, as per the formula.\n4.  Print out each step of the calculation, showing how the numbers from the matrix are plugged into the formula and evaluated, as requested.\n5.  Finally, print the computed determinant value.\n\nThis approach will make the calculation process clear and easy to follow.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem asks to compute the determinant of the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver.\n# The matrix A is explicitly provided.
