For example, if we compare A-vs-B and B-vs-C to infer A-vs-C, the patients and trial designs in A-vs-B must be similar enough to those in B-vs-C so that B acts as a fair common comparator. However, even if transitivity is assumed to hold, the analysis could be invalidated by statistical inconsistency or unmanageable heterogeneity.",

        'Homogeneity (C)':
            "This assumes that the true treatment effect is the same across all trials comparing the same two treatments. If there is significant variation (heterogeneity), it can be statistically modeled using a random-effects NMA. Therefore, assuming strict homogeneity is not required for a valid analysis, and it is certainly not sufficient to ensure the entire network is valid.",

        'Consistency (B)':
            "This is the statistical manifestation of transitivity. It means that the treatment effects from direct evidence (e.g., A-vs-C trials) and indirect evidence (e.g., from A-vs-B and B-vs-C trials) are in agreement. We can test for inconsistency. However, finding no statistical inconsistency is not enough on its own. The underlying transitivity assumption could still be violated in a way that doesn't produce a statistically significant signal, or the network may lack the power to detect it."

A valid NMA is built on a chain of logic, and every link must be strong.
1. The study sets must be comparable (Transitivity).
2. The variation within study sets must be accounted for (Homogeneity/Heterogeneity).
3. The direct and indirect evidence must agree (Consistency).

Since a failure in any of these areas can invalidate the results, no single assumption, when met in isolation, is sufficient to guarantee the overall validity of the analysis. A successful NMA requires that all these conditions are satisfied or appropriately handled.
