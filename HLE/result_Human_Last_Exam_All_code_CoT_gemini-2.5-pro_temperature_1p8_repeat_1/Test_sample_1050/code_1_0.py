    num_rows = 2024
    num_columns = 2023
    num_monsters = 2022

    # Step 1: Analyze the structure of the board.
    # The problem states there are 'num_monsters' monsters, each in a unique row
    # (from row 2 to 2023) and that each column contains at most one monster.
    # This implies that 'num_monsters' columns are unsafe (contain one monster each).
    num_unsafe_columns = num_monsters
    
    # The number of safe columns is the total number of columns minus the unsafe ones.
    num_safe_columns = num_columns - num_unsafe_columns

    # Step 2: Analyze the information gained from each attempt.
    # Turbo's goal is to find the single safe column to pass through.
    # An attempt fails when Turbo hits a monster. Hitting a monster in column 'c'
    # tells Turbo that column 'c' is unsafe.
    # Therefore, each failed attempt can eliminate at most one column from the set of
    # potentially safe columns.

    # Step 3: Determine the number of attempts in the worst-case scenario.
    # To guarantee success, Turbo's strategy must work against the worst possible
    # monster placement. In the worst case, the safe column is the very last one
    # Turbo tries.
    # To be certain of the safe column's location, Turbo must first identify all
    # of the unsafe columns.
    max_failed_attempts = num_unsafe_columns

    # Step 4: Calculate the total number of guaranteed attempts.
    # After 'max_failed_attempts' have failed, Turbo will know the locations of all
    # monsters and thus all unsafe columns. He can then deduce the single safe column.
    # His next attempt will be down this known safe column, which is guaranteed to succeed.
    successful_attempts_needed = 1
    
    # The minimum number of attempts to guarantee a win is the sum of the maximum
    # possible failures and the one final success.
    min_guaranteed_attempts = max_failed_attempts + successful_attempts_needed
    
    # Step 5: Print the explanation and final equation.
