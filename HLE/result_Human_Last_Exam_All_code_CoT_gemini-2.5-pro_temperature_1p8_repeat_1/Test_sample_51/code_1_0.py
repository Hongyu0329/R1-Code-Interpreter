    print("\n--- Step 1: Deconstructing the Subterm Rule ---")
    print("The problem defines a dependent type theory with a special subterm relation.")
    print("The most unusual part is: 'a lambda (λ x. f) is a subterm of X whenever X is a subterm of X.'")
    print("Since any term X is a subterm of itself (reflexivity), this rule simplifies to: 'any lambda abstraction is a subterm of any term X.'")

    print("\n--- Step 2: From Structural to General Recursion ---")
    print("Structural recursion requires that recursive calls are made on arguments that are structurally smaller (i.e., subterms). This guarantees termination.")
    print("The given rule breaks this guarantee. A function defined on a term `x` of type `T` can make a recursive call on a brand new lambda `(λ y. ...)` of the same type `T`.")
    print("This allows us to write non-terminating functions that are still considered 'structurally recursive' by the system. It effectively introduces a general-purpose fixed-point operator (like the Y-combinator), enabling general recursion.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: General Recursion and the Halting Problem ---")
    print("With general recursion, the type theory is powerful enough to simulate any Turing machine. This means we can encode undecidable problems, like the Halting Problem, within the theory's logic.")
    print("For example, we can define propositions and functions that reason about whether other functions terminate.")

    print("\n--- Step 4: The Paradox with Classical Logic ---")
    print("Constructive logic (the basis of DTT) avoids paradoxes like the Halting Problem because it does not assume every proposition is either true or false.")
    print("Classical logic introduces this assumption via the Law of the Excluded Middle (LEM): `For any proposition P, P ∨ ¬P`.")
    print("Combining general recursion with LEM leads to a contradiction:")
    print("  1. Define a paradoxical computation `Liar` that terminates if and only if a proof of its own non-termination exists.")
    print("  2. Let `P` be the proposition '`Liar` terminates'.")
    print("  3. By LEM, we can assume `P ∨ ¬P`.")
    print("  4. Case 1 (Assume `P` is true): If `Liar` terminates, then by its definition, its non-termination proof must exist, meaning `¬P` is true. This is a contradiction (`P` and `¬P`).")
    print("  5. Case 2 (Assume `¬P` is true): If `Liar` does not terminate, then by its definition, a proof of its non-termination exists, which in turn means the computation *does* terminate, so `P` is true. This is also a contradiction (`¬P` and `P`).")
    print("Since both cases lead to a contradiction, the system can prove `False` and is therefore inconsistent.")

    print("\n--- Step 5: Identifying the Axiom ---")
    print("The crucial step that enables this paradoxical reasoning is the case analysis on termination, which is precisely the Law of the Excluded Middle.")
    print("Therefore, adding (H) Excluded Middle to the described system makes it inconsistent.")
