    "This sequence is not based on a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. Instead, it is a known sequence from number theory, listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A054320.\n\nThe sequence consists of integers `n` for which the sum of the divisors of `n` cubed (a value known as `sigma(n^3)`) is a perfect square. The provided numbers are the 4th through 9th known terms of this sequence.
