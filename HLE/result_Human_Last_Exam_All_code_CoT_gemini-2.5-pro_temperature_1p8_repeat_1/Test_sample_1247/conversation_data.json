    "To find the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to determine the number of permutations of length 333 that have exactly 3 inversions and avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nAn inversion in a permutation is a pair of elements that are out of their natural order. A permutation avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no four elements \\(a, b, c, d\\) at indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) such that their values satisfy \\(a < c < b < d\\).\n\nFor a large permutation length like n=333, and a small number of inversions like k=3, the number of such permutations becomes independent of n. This is because a permutation with a few inversions is \"mostly sorted\". The few out-of-order elements (which form the inversions) are likely to create a forbidden pattern if they are located in the middle of the sequence. To avoid the pattern, these disordered elements must be located at the very beginning or the very end of the permutation. The number of ways to do this doesn't depend on the total length n, once n is large enough (e.g., n >= 6).\n\nTherefore, we can solve this problem by computing the value for a smaller n (like n=8) and the result will be the answer for n=333.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that:\n1.  Sets n=8 and k=3.\n2.  Generates all permutations of length 8.\n3.  For each permutation, it counts the number of inversions.\n4.  If the number of inversions is 3, it checks if the permutation avoids the 1324 pattern.\n5.  It counts the number of such permutations and prints the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_inversions(p):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of inversions in a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inv_count = 0\n    n = len(p)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if p[i] > p[j]:\n                inv_count += 1\n    return inv_count\n\ndef has_1324_pattern(p):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a permutation has a 1324 pattern.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    if n < 4:\n        return False\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                if p[i] < p[k] and p[k] < p[j]:\n                    for l in range(k + 1, n):\n                        if p[j] < p[l]:\n                            return True\n    return False\n\ndef solve_av_nk_pattern(n, k, pattern_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates av_n^k(pattern) for small n.\n    This problem concerns pattern 1324. The implementation specifically checks for 1324.\n    \"\"\"\n    if pattern_str != \"1324\":\n        raise ValueError(\"This solver is specific to the 1324 pattern.\")\n\n    count = 0\n    # Use a list of numbers from 1 to n to represent the permutation\n    elements = range(1, n + 1)\n    for p in itertools.permutations(elements):\n        if count_inversions(p) == k:\n            if not has_1324_pattern(p):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for av_333^3(1324) by calculating it for a smaller n where the result is stable.\n    The number of 1324-avoiding permutations with k inversions is constant for n >= 2k.\n    Here n=333, k=3, so n >= 6 is sufficient.
