    "This is a geographical riddle. I will deduce the answer by breaking down the clues provided.\n\n1.  **\"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\"**: This points to one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, such as Easter Island (Rapa Nui), Tristan da Cunha, or the Pitcairn Islands.\n2.  **\"sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera\"**: This narrows it down to a specific type of volcanic island. The bay itself should be a flooded crater or directly adjacent to one.\n3.  **\"shares the town's name\"**: The name of the town and the name of the bay must be the same.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidates:\n*   **Tristan da Cunha**: The main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. It's not on a bay that shares its name.\n*   **Pitcairn Islands**: The main settlement is Adamstown, located above Bounty Bay. The names don't match.\n*   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui)**: The main town is **Hanga Roa**. It is situated on **Hanga Roa Bay**. This fits the name clue perfectly. The island is entirely volcanic, and its shape is dictated by its three main volcanoes, one of which, Rano Kau, has a dramatic caldera overlooking the area. The nearest inhabited island (Pitcairn) is over 2,000 km away, satisfying the remoteness clue.\n\nTherefore, Hanga Roa is the correct answer. I will now provide the answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the geographical riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clues:\n    # 1. More than 500 km from another inhabited island.\n    # 2. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    # 3.
