    "An A-stable numerical method's stability region S must contain the left-half of the complex plane. The BDF4 method is not A-stable, but it is A($\\alpha$)-stable, meaning its stability region contains a symmetric wedge of angle $2\\alpha$ around the negative real axis, defined by $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$. We want to find the largest such $\\alpha$.\n\nThe boundary of the stability region is given by the set of complex numbers $\\hat{h}(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\nFor the BDF4 method, the characteristic polynomials are:\n$\\rho(\\zeta) = \\frac{25}{12}\\zeta^4 - 4\\zeta^3 + 3\\zeta^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\zeta + \\frac{1}{4}$\n$\\sigma(\\zeta) = \\zeta^4$\n\nThe angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the lines passing through the origin that are tangent to this boundary curve. The angle of these tangent lines, $\\phi_{max}$, is an extremum of the argument of $\\hat{h}(\\theta)$. The stability angle $\\alpha$ is then given by $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi_{max}$.\n\nTo find the extrema of $\\arg(\\hat{h}(\\theta))$, we need to solve $\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\arg(\\hat{h}(\\theta)) = 0$. This condition is equivalent to finding $\\theta$ such that $\\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{e^{i\\theta}\\rho'(e^{i\\theta})}{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}\\right) = 4$.\n\nThis equation can be converted into a high-degree polynomial in $x = \\cos(\\theta)$. Solving this polynomial for its real roots in $[-1, 1]$ gives the values of $\\cos(\\theta)$ where the argument is extremal. We then substitute these back into the expression for $\\hat{h}$ to find the complex points on the boundary and compute their arguments.\n\nThe largest argument $\\phi_{max}$ that corresponds to a boundary point in the left-half plane determines the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle. Based on numerical solutions and established results, the relevant value for $\\cos(\\theta)$ is approximately -0.7383. Substituting this into the expressions for the real and imaginary parts of $\\hat{h}(\\theta)$ yields the coordinates that define the angle.\n\nLet $\\hat{h}(\\theta) = u(\\theta) + i v(\\theta)$. The stability angle $\\alpha$ can be expressed as $\\alpha = \\pi - \\arctan2(v, u)$. Since the problem requests the answer in terms of `arctan`, we can use the identity $\\pi - \\arctan2(v,u) = \\arctan(-v/u)$ for $u<0, v\\ge 0$ (and add $\\pi$ if $v<0$), or more generally, $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arctan(\\frac{u}{v})$.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations numerically to find the values of $u$ and $v$ and then computes $\\alpha$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \n    The angle is determined by finding the point on the stability boundary \n    in the left-half plane where the argument is maximized.
