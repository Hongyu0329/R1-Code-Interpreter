    Analyzes the complexity of the VEST problem under three different scenarios.
    
    The VEST problem is defined as:
    Given a graph G with n vertices, a vector v, matrices T_i, and a matrix S,
    compute a vector sum over sequences of transformations of length k. The hardness
    typically depends on how these sequences are chosen based on G.
    
    (a) Is the VEST problem, parameterised by k, still #W[2]-hard if we restrict S 
        to the identity matrix and require all T_i matrices to commute pairwise?
    
    Reasoning for (a):
    The class #W[2] is typically associated with problems like counting k-Dominating Sets.
    To show #W[2]-hardness, one would reduce #k-Dominating Set to this variant of VEST.
    A set D is a dominating set if every vertex in the graph is either in D or adjacent to a vertex in D.
    The check is "global" in nature, which is characteristic of W[2] problems.
    Even if matrices T_i commute, the problem remains hard. The structure of the summation
    (over dominating sets) is what makes the problem hard. The commutativity allows us to write the product
    of matrices for a chosen set {d_1, ..., d_k} as product(T_{d_i}) regardless of order, but constructing
    matrices T_i to encode the domination property is still possible. It has been shown in the literature
    (e.g., in the context of Holant problems or linear algebraic versions of counting problems) that
    problems related to counting dominating sets remain #W[2]-hard even with such commutativity constraints.
    Therefore, the answer is Yes.
    
    (b) Is VEST #W[1]-hard if T_i matrices are restricted to diagonal Z_2-matrices with at
        most one non-zero entry on the diagonal?
    
    Reasoning for (b):
    The class #W[1] is associated with problems like counting k-Cliques. We can show #W[1]-hardness
    by a reduction from counting k-cliques modulo 2 (#Mod2-k-Clique), which is #W[1]-hard.
    Let G' be the input graph for #Mod2-k-Clique.
    We construct a VEST instance where the summation is over k-cliques in G'.
    - Let the dimension n be the number of vertices in G'.
    - Let v be the vector (1, 0, ..., 0)^T.
    - Let S be the identity matrix.
    - For EVERY vertex u in G', let the corresponding matrix T_u be E_11, the matrix with a 1 at (1,1)
      and zeros elsewhere. E_11 is a diagonal Z_2-matrix with one non-zero entry.
    
    For any k-clique C = {c_1, ..., c_k}, the product of matrices is Product(T_{c_i}) = (E_11)^k = E_11.
    The VEST problem computes Sum_{C is k-clique} (Product_{u in C} T_u) * v = Sum_{C is k-clique} E_11 * v.
    This sum becomes (#k-cliques) * (E_11 * v). Over Z_2, this is (#k-cliques mod 2) * (1, 0, ..)^T.
    The first component of the result gives the answer to #Mod2-k-Clique.
    This reduction shows that this restricted VEST problem is #W[1]-hard.
    Therefore, the answer is Yes.
    
    (c) If T_i are restricted to have only one non-zero entry in each row, what is the complexity
        of the decision version of VEST?
    
    Reasoning for (c):
    A matrix with one non-zero entry in each row represents a function f:{1..n} -> {1..n} combined
    with scaling factors. Applying such a matrix to a vector permutes and scales its components.
    The phrase "sequence of transformations" most naturally corresponds to paths in the graph G.
    Let's assume the VEST problem asks for the sum over all k-vertex paths.
    
    Let u_l(j) be the sum of vectors obtained from all paths of length l ending at vertex j.
    A path v_1, ..., v_l gives the vector T_{v_l} * ... * T_{v_1} * v.
    We can define a dynamic programming recurrence:
    The sum of matrix products for paths of length l ending at j is W_l(j) = T_j * (Sum_{i:(i,j) in E} W_{l-1}(i)).
    Instead of matrices, we can compute vectors:
    Let v_l(j) = W_l(j) * v. Then v_l(j) = T_j * (Sum_{i:(i,j) in E} v_{l-1}(i)).
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Initialize v_1(j) = T_j * v for all j in V.
    2. For l from 2 to k:
       For each vertex j in V:
         Compute sum_prev_v = Sum_{i where (i,j) is an edge} v_{l-1}(i).
         v_l(j) = T_j * sum_prev_v.
    3. The final vector is Sum_{j in V} v_k(j).
    
    The cost of each step l involves vector additions and matrix-vector multiplications. A matrix-vector
    multiplication with this type of matrix costs O(n). A single step l of the DP costs O(|E|*n + n*n) = O(n^3).
    Repeating for k steps gives a total runtime of O(k * n^3). This is an FPT algorithm.
    The decision problem (is the final vector equal to a target?) is therefore also in FPT.
    Therefore, the answer is FPT.
