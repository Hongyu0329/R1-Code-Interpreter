    # Step 4: Equate the two expressions for A_m
    # The term (1 - cos(l*mu_m)) is non-zero for the eigenvalues and can be cancelled.
    # K1 / (K2*l*mu_m + K3*sin(K4*l*mu_m)) = 4 / (2*l*mu_m - sin(2*l*mu_m))

    # 2*K1*l*mu_m - K1*sin(2*l*mu_m) = 4*K2*l*mu_m + 4*K3*sin(K4*l*mu_m)

    # For the sin(2*l*mu_m) term: -K1 = 4*K3 => K3 = -K1/4
    
    # The problem is that K1 can be any non-zero constant, and K2, K3 scale accordingly.
    # This kind of expression is often written in a 'normalized' form. A common choice is to make the first coefficient inside the parenthesis equal to 1.
    # However, the coefficient is `K2*l` which is not a simple number. Another choice is to make the leading numerical coefficient equal to 1.

    # Now we need to determine K. The problem states a boundary condition l*y'(l) + k*y(l) = 0 for k>=0, and a condition on eigenvalues sqrt(lambda_m) > K.

    # A formula that depends on the problem parameters is not a specific value. The problem is posed to have a single numerical answer.
    # This suggests that the result should be independent of k. This can happen if the expression is zero for a valid value of k.
