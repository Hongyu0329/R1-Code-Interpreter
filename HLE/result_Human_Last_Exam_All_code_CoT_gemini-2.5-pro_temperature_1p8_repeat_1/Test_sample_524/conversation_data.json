    "This is a question from the mathematical field of topology. The answer is a known, proven result rather than a value that can be computed from scratch. The plan is to use code to present this established mathematical fact.\n\n1.  **Identify the Classes:** First, I will list the distinct, mutually non-homeomorphic types of homogeneous planar continua as established by the classification theorem in topology.\n2.  **Count the Classes:** The total number of these classes is the answer to the question.\n3.  **Present the Result:** I will write a Python script that enumerates these classes and then prints the final count, satisfying the request to show the components of the final number.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the solution to a known problem in mathematics.\n    The number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua is a\n    settled question in topology, established by the work of mathematicians\n    like R.
