    "To find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Tori to the Weyl Group**: The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are not all conjugate over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Their $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the so-called $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism.\n\n2.  **Consider the Specific Case of E8**: A fundamental theorem by Lang states that any connected algebraic group over a finite field has an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational Borel subgroup. This implies that any reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is quasi-split. For a simple group, the quasi-split forms are classified by the automorphisms of the corresponding Dynkin diagram. The Dynkin diagram for the root system of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Nature of G**: Because the $E_8$ Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms, any quasi-split group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be a *split* group.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Calculation**: For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. In this case, the concept of $F$-conjugacy simplifies to the standard notion of conjugacy. Therefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is simply the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n5.  **Find the Number of Conjugacy Classes**: The Weyl group for $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$, is a well-studied finite group. The number of its conjugacy classes is a known mathematical constant, determined from the character theory of the group. This number is 112.\n\nThe Python code below will state this result and print the final number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8.\n\n    The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G over F_q\n    is given by the number of F-conjugacy classes of its Weyl group W.\n    \n    For a group G of type E_8, the Dynkin diagram has trivial automorphism group.\n    This implies that any such group G over F_q is split.\n\n    For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group.\n    Thus, F-conjugacy classes are the same as ordinary conjugacy classes.\n\n    The problem reduces to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W(E_8).\n    This is a known result from the theory of finite reflection groups.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group W(E_8)\n    num_classes_W_E8 = 112\n\n    print(\"Let N be the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8.\")\n    print(\"N is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the corresponding Weyl group, W(E_8).\")\n    \n    # The final calculation is just stating this known value.\n    print(\"\\nThe number of conjugacy classes of W(E_8) is:\")\n    print(num_classes_W_E8)\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the final equation for the number of tori is:\")\n    print(f\"N = {num_classes_W_E8}\")\n\nsolve_tori_count()\n```\n<<<112>>>"
