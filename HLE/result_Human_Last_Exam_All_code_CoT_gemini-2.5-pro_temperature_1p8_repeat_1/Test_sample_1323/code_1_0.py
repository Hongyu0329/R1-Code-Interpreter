def determine_unknown_term():
    """
    This function symbolically calculates the term '?_1' from the problem statement.
    The term arises from the singular nature of the kernel G(y) when taking second derivatives.
    It can be found by evaluating a boundary integral that emerges from an integration by
    parts argument around the singularity.

    The term is of the form: ?_1 = C_ij * h(x).
    Our goal is to compute the coefficient tensor C_ij.

    The coefficient C_ij is derived from the following limit:
    C_ij * h(x) = lim_{eps->0} integral_{|y|=eps} (dG/dy_i)(y) * h(x-y) * n_j dS
    where n_j = y_j / |y| is the normal vector component and dS is the line element.

    As epsilon -> 0, h(x-y) -> h(x). The calculation for C_ij becomes:
    C_ij = (1 / (2*pi)) * integral_0^{2*pi} [y_i(theta) * y_j(theta) / epsilon^2] d_theta
    where y = (epsilon*cos(theta), epsilon*sin(theta)).
