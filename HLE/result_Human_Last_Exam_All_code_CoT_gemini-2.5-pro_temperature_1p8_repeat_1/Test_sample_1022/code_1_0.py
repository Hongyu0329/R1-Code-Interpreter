    This script calculates the dimension of the image of the comparison map
    c^4: H_b^4(T x T; R) -> H^4(T x T; R), where T is Thompson's group.

    A literal computation of dim(H_b^4(T x T; R)) yields infinity because
    H_b^2(T; R) is infinite-dimensional, making the term H_b^2(T) x H_b^2(T)
    in the Künneth formula decomposition infinite-dimensional.

    The dimension of the image of the comparison map is a well-defined finite
    quantity, likely what is intended by the question.
