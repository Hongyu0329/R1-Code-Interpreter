    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\nThe question you're asking touches on the intersection of formal logic, metaphysics, and physics. It's a fascinating topic. Here is a step-by-step plan to address it.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Gödel's Ontological Proof:** First, I'll explain that Gödel's proof is a work of formal, symbolic logic (specifically, modal logic). It is an *a priori* argument, meaning it proceeds from definitions and axioms, not from empirical observation of the physical world. Its \"mathematics\" is the language of logic, not physics.\n2.  **Analyze the Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics (QM):** Second, I'll describe the mathematics of QM, which involves tools like linear algebra, Hilbert spaces, and probability theory. This mathematical framework is designed to model and predict the behavior of physical systems and is verified by experimental data (*a posteriori*).\n3.  **Establish Incompatibility:** Third, I will explain why these two domains are fundamentally incompatible for the purpose of a proof. Using the mathematics of QM to prove a concept in modal logic is a \"category error\"—it's like trying to use a thermometer to measure the weight of a sound. The tools of one domain are not applicable to the concepts of the other.\n4.  **Provide Illustrative Code:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that conceptually models this separation. The code will define two separate \"systems\"—one representing the self-contained logical argument of Gödel, and another representing a simple quantum system. The code will demonstrate that they operate independently and cannot influence or inform one another, thus illustrating why a proof is not possible. The final output will be a symbolic equation representing this incompatibility.\n\nHere is the Python code that illustrates this principle.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass GodelsOntologicalProof:\n    \"\"\"\n    A conceptual class representing Gödel's Ontological Proof.\n    This proof is a self-contained logical system based on axioms and deductions.\n    It does not take physical data as input.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        # The proof is based on a set of axioms and logical rules.\n        self.axioms = {\n            1: \"Axiom 1: A property is positive or its negative is, but not both.\",\n            2: \"Axiom 2: A property implied by a positive property is positive.\",\n            3: \"Axiom 3: Being God-like (possessing all positive properties) is a positive property.\",\n            4: \"Axiom 4: If a property is positive, then it is necessarily positive.\",\n            5: \"Axiom 5: Necessary existence is a positive property.\"\n        }\n        self.logical_system_id = 1\n\n    def deduce_conclusion(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        This method simulates the logical deduction process.\n        The conclusion is derived *internally* from the axioms.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(\"--- Inside Gödel's Logical System ---\")\n        print(\"Applying logical rules to internal axioms...\")\n        print(\"Conclusion: Following the axioms, a 'God-like' entity necessarily exists.\")\n        # In this system, the conclusion is logically necessary (True).\n        return 1 # Representing a 'True' or 'Valid' conclusion.\n\n\nclass QuantumMechanicalSystem:\n    \"\"\"\n    A conceptual class representing a simple physical system in quantum mechanics.\n    Its behavior is described by probabilities and yields empirical data upon measurement.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Represents a simple quantum state (e.g., a qubit in superposition).\n        # |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where |α|² + |β|² = 1.\n        self.state_vector = np.array([1/np.sqrt(2), 1/np.sqrt(2)])\n        self.physical_system_id = 2\n\n    def perform_measurement(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Simulates a quantum measurement.
