# The problem asks for the largest value of p such that if a function f is in L^p(R^3)
# and the support of its Fourier transform is on the moment curve, then f must be zero.

# This is a problem about "sets of uniqueness" in Fourier analysis.
# A known theorem states that for the moment curve in R^n, gamma(t) = (t, t^2, ..., t^n),
# this property holds if and only if p is less than or equal to a critical value p_c.

# This critical value p_c is given by the formula: p_c = n * (n + 1) / 2.

# For the given problem, the function's domain is R^3, which means the dimension n is 3.
n = 3

# Now, we can calculate the critical value p_c for n=3.
p_critical = n * (n + 1) / 2

# The theorem implies that the statement in the problem is true for p <= p_c
# and false for p > p_c.
# The question asks for the largest possible value of p for which the statement holds true.
# This value is precisely p_c.
