    This function determines the coefficients for the expression of the number of 
    closed tree-like walks of length 6 in a simple graph X.
    The expression is of the form:
    c1*e + c2*k + c3*p + c4*sum(deg(v) choose 2) + c5*sum(deg(v) choose 3)
    
    The coefficients are derived from combinatorial counting of walks on small tree subgraphs.
