    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ have a dimension less than 500,000.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Irreps and Partitions:** The irreducible representations of the symmetric group on $n$ elements, $S_n$, are in a one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. For $S_{25}$, we need to consider all partitions of the number 25.\n\n2.  **Dimension Calculation:** The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is given by the hook-length formula. The formula states that the dimension $d_{\\lambda}$ is $n!$ divided by the product of the hook lengths of all the cells in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$. The hook length of a cell is the number of cells to its right (in the same row), plus the number of cells below it (in the same column), plus the cell itself.\n\n3.  **Computational Strategy:** I will write a Python script to perform the following actions:\n    a. Generate every unique partition of the integer 25. The number of partitions of 25 is 1958, which is a manageable number for a computer to process.\n    b. For each partition, calculate the dimension of its corresponding irrep using the hook-length formula. Since the numbers involved, like $25!$, are very large, the script will use Python's support for arbitrary-precision integers.\n    c. Compare each calculated dimension against the given limit of 500,000.\n    d. Keep a count of how many dimensions are strictly less than this limit.\n\n4.  **Final Output:** The final result is the total count. To adhere to the output format requirements, I will present this count as a sum of ones that equals the final number. For example, if the count is 3, the output will be `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of irreducible representations of the symmetric group S_25\n    that have a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 25\n    limit = 500_000\n\n    # Pre-calculate n! as it's a constant for all partitions.\n    n_factorial = math.factorial(n)\n\n    memo_partitions = {}\n    def generate_partitions(num, max_val=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        A generator for all integer partitions of 'num' in descending order.\n        For example, for n=4, it yields [4], [3,1], [2,2], [2,1,1], [1,1,1,1].\n        \"\"\"\n        if max_val is None:\n            max_val = num\n\n        # Base case for the recursion.\n        if num == 0:\n            yield []\n            return\n\n        # Recursively find partitions.\n        for i in range(min(num, max_val), 0, -1):\n            for p_rest in generate_partitions(num - i, i):\n                yield [i] + p_rest\n\n    memo_dimension = {}\n    def calculate_dimension(partition):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the dimension of an irrep for a given partition using the hook-length formula.\n        Memoization is used to cache results for previously seen partitions (though for n=25, all partitions are unique).\n        \"\"\"\n        # Partitions are lists, which are not hashable.
