    print("If delta < omega_1, then its cofinality, cf(delta), must be countable (i.e., cf(delta) = omega).")
    print("This allows us to find a sequence of ordinals beta_0 < beta_1 < beta_2 < ... that is cofinal in delta.")
    print("Consider the sub-tower <x_{beta_n} : n is a natural number>. If this sub-tower has a pseudo-intersection 'y', so does the original tower.")

    print("This new tower has the properties that z'_{n+1} is a true subset of z'_n, and z'_n is still uncountable and 'almost-equal' to z_n.")

    print("The second term is a countable union of countable sets.")
    print("A fundamental property of omega_1 is that it is a *regular cardinal*. This implies that a countable union of countable subsets of omega_1 is itself countable.")

    print("This contradicts property 3 of the tower definition.")
    print("Therefore, our assumption that delta < omega_1 was wrong. We must have delta >= omega_1.")
