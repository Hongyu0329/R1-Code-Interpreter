    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Danish Flag**: First, I need to understand what \"maximal linear algebraic rank\" means in this context. I will model the flag as a matrix where each distinct color is represented by a unique, non-zero number. The \"maximal rank\" is the rank calculated when these numbers are chosen to avoid accidental linear dependencies. The Danish flag's Nordic cross design creates two fundamental row patterns: rows that are all one color (the horizontal bar of the cross) and rows that have two colors (the background color interrupted by the vertical bar of the cross). This structure results in a maximal rank of 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze African Flag Geometries**: Next, I will categorize and analyze the geometric designs of various African flags to determine their maximal rank using the same principle.\n    *   **Simple Stripes**: Flags with only horizontal or vertical stripes (like Nigeria or Botswana) have row patterns that are all scalar multiples of each other, resulting in a rank of 1.\n    *   **Complex Geometries**: Flags with diagonal elements, complex emblems, or many color fields (like South Africa or Seychelles) create numerous unique and linearly independent row patterns, leading to a rank higher than 2.\n    *   **Target Geometries**: I'm looking for flags with a specific structure that, like the Danish flag, generates a space of row patterns spanned by exactly two basis vectors. A common example of such a structure is a flag with a vertical bar at the hoist and two horizontal stripes on the fly (e.g., the flag of Madagascar).\n\n3.  **Write a Python Script**: I will write a Python script that models the flags of Denmark and several representative African nations as NumPy matrices. The script will calculate the rank of each matrix and print the names of the African flags whose rank is 2, matching that of Denmark. The final output will explicitly state the answer.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the analysis:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef create_flag_matrix(name, dims=(60, 90)):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a numerical matrix representation of a flag's geometric design.\n    The values for colors are chosen to be distinct prime numbers to ensure\n    the calculated rank is the maximal possible rank for that geometry.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using prime numbers for colors avoids accidental linear dependencies.\n    # K is for blacK\n    colors = {'R': 2, 'W': 3, 'G': 5, 'Y': 7, 'B': 11, 'K': 13} \n    \n    H, W = dims\n    matrix = np.zeros(dims, dtype=int)\n\n    if name == \"Denmark\":\n        # A red field with a white Nordic cross.\n        # This structure generates a rank of 2.\n        matrix[:, :] = colors['R']\n        cross_h_start, cross_h_end = int(H * 5/12), int(H * 7/12)\n        cross_v_start, cross_v_end = int(W * 3/9), int(W * 4/9)\n        matrix[cross_h_start:cross_h_end, :] = colors['W']\n        matrix[:, cross_v_start:cross_v_end] = colors['W']\n        return matrix\n\n    if name == \"Madagascar\":\n        # A vertical white band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (red, green).\n        # This structure also generates a rank of 2.\n        white_band_width = int(W / 3)\n        matrix[:, 0:white_band_width] = colors['W']\n        matrix[0:int(H/2), white_band_width:W] = colors['R']\n        matrix[int(H/2):H, white_band_width:W] = colors['G']\n        return matrix\n        \n    if name == \"Benin\":\n        # A vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (yellow, red).\n        # This structure is geometrically identical to Madagascar's, yielding a rank of 2.\n        green_band_width = int(W * 2 / 5)\n        matrix[:, 0:green_band_width] = colors['G']\n        matrix[0:int(H/2), green_band_width:W] = colors['Y']\n        matrix[int(H/2):H, green_band_width:W] = colors['R']\n        return matrix\n\n    if name == \"Nigeria\":\n        # Simple vertical stripes.
