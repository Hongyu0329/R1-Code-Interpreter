    This script searches for a set A that satisfies the conditions of the problem.

    The problem defines Σ as the set of all finite, non-empty subsets A of positive integers such that:
    1. A+A ⊆ A×A
    2. A is not the empty set (∅) or the set {2}.

    As discussed in the text explanation, the condition A+A ⊆ A×A literally implies A must be empty,
    making Σ empty. We proceed by assuming A×A is a typo for the product-set A*A = {a*b | a,b in A},
    which is a more standard type of problem in this area of mathematics.

    The goal is to find min(max(A)) over all A in Σ. We will search for a qualifying set A
    by checking sets with increasing maximum values.
