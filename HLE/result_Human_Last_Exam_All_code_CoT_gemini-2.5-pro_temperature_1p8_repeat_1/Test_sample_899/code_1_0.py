The root is x = -3/(2*1) = 4*4 = 16 = 2 mod 7. So, x^2 + 3*x + 4 = (x-2)^2. The ring is F_7[x]/((x-2)^2). The change of variable u = x-2 shows it is isomorphic to F_7[u]/(u^2), and thus to R_F.")

Given that other rings in this problem are finite and likely have size 49, a plausible interpretation in this context is the finite-dimensional quotient O/(m^2) = (F_7[x]_{(x+1)})/(x+1)^2F_7[x]_{(x+1)}, which is isomorphic to F_7[x]/((x+1)^2).

Since 2 is a square mod 7 (3^2 = 9 = 2), the polynomial is reducible. The roots are x = (-1 +/- 3)/(2*5) = (6 +/- 3)/3, which are x=9/3=3 and x=3/3=1. So, the polynomial factors as 5*(x-1)*(x-3). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the ring is isomorphic to F_7[x]/(x-1) x F_7[x]/(x-3) which is isomorphic to F_7 x F_7.")

Since 6 is not a quadratic residue mod 7, the polynomial is irreducible. The quotient ring is therefore a field extension of degree 2, which is a field with 7^2 = 49 elements, F_49.")
    print("H) R_H = F_7[[x]]/((6*x^2 + 5*x + 4)/(x+4)). The notation is ambiguous. A plausible interpretation, fitting the context, is that the ring intended was F_7[x]/(6*x^2 + 5*x + 4). The polynomial 6*x^2 + 5*x + 4 = -(x^2 - 5*x - 4) has discriminant Delta = (-5)^2 - 4*1*(-4) = 25+16 = 41 = 6 mod 7.
