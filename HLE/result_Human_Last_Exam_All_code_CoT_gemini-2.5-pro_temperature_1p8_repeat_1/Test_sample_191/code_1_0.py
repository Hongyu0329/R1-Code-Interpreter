# The user is asking for the name of a protein that, when cleaved, signals for macrophage engulfment of amyloid.
# This describes a key protein in the complement system, which is part of the body's innate immune response.
# The process is called opsonization, where a target is tagged for destruction.
# In this case, the protein Complement C3 is cleaved into fragments (C3a and C3b).
# The C3b fragment attaches to the surface of amyloid plaques, marking them as targets for phagocytosis (engulfment) by macrophages and microglia (the brain's resident macrophages).

protein_name = "Complement C3"
