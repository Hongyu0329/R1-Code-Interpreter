    "My plan is to answer the user's biological question. The user is asking to identify a specific protein involved in the immune response to amyloid plaques. The key characteristic of this protein is that its breakdown, or cleavage, is what signals macrophages to engulf the amyloid. This process is known as opsonization. I will identify the protein central to this process and then, following the instructions, present the answer using a Python script that simply prints the name of the protein.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking for the name of a protein that, when cleaved, signals for macrophage engulfment of amyloid.\n# This describes a key protein in the complement system, which is part of the body's innate immune response.\n# The process is called opsonization, where a target is tagged for destruction.\n# In this case, the protein Complement C3 is cleaved into fragments (C3a and C3b).\n# The C3b fragment attaches to the surface of amyloid plaques, marking them as targets for phagocytosis (engulfment) by macrophages and microglia (the brain's resident macrophages).\n\nprotein_name = \"Complement C3\"\n\nprint(\"The protein that, when broken down, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is:\")\nprint(protein_name)\n```\n<<<Complement C3>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
