    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the task, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Framework**: The problem asks to use the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems. In statistical mechanics, these theorems provide the formal justification for why an isolated system in equilibrium is found in the macroscopic state of maximum entropy. They state that the probability of observing a macroscopic state significantly different from the one that maximizes entropy is exponentially small for a large number of particles. Therefore, finding the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy is equivalent to solving this entropy maximization problem.\n\n2.  **The Physical System (Bose case of light quanta)**: We are considering a system of photons. Photons are bosons, so they follow Bose-Einstein statistics. A key property of photons is that their number is not conserved; they can be created and annihilated. In the language of statistical mechanics, this means their chemical potential is zero (`μ = 0`).\n\n3.  **Finding the Equilibrium Distribution**: The equilibrium state is found by maximizing the Bose-Einstein entropy `S` subject to the constraint of a constant average total energy `<E>`. This procedure yields the famous Bose-Einstein distribution for the mean occupation number `<n_i>` of an energy level `ε_i` with degeneracy `g_i`:\n    `<n_i> = g_i / (exp(β(ε_i - μ)) - 1)`\n    Since `μ=0` for photons and assuming a simple system where each distinct energy level is non-degenerate (`g_i=1`), this simplifies to the Planck distribution:\n    `<n_i> = 1 / (exp(β*ε_i) - 1)`, where `β = 1 / (k_B * T)`.\n\n4.  **Calculating Equilibrium Values**:\n    *   **Mean Energy `<E>`**: Once we have the equilibrium occupation numbers `<n_i>`, the mean energy of the system is the sum over all energy levels:\n      `<E> = Σ_i <n_i> * ε_i`\n    *   **Entropy `S`**: We find the equilibrium entropy by substituting the equilibrium values `<n_i>` back into the formula for Bose-Einstein entropy (with `g_i=1` and `k_B=1`):\n      `S = Σ_i [ (<n_i> + 1) * ln(<n_i> + 1) - <n_i> * ln(<n_i>) ]`\n\n5.  **Implementation**: The Python code will implement these calculations. For a concrete example, I will assume a simple system with energy levels `ε_i = i` for `i=1, 2, 3, ...` and set `β=1`. The code will perform the summations and print the equations with their first few terms, along with the final numerical results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_bose_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium mean energy and entropy for a photon gas (Bose case).\n\n    This is based on the Bose-Einstein distribution, which describes the most probable\n    macroscopic state as predicted by large deviation theory (e.g., Boltzmann-Sanov).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- System Parameters ---\n    # We use non-dimensional units for this theoretical calculation.\n    # Set inverse temperature beta = 1 / (k_B * T).
