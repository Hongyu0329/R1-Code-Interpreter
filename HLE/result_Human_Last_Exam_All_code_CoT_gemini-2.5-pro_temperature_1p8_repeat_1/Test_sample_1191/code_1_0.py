    A higher mutation rate introduces more mutations per generation. Since the vast
    majority of mutations with any effect on fitness are deleterious (harmful), a high
    mutation rate leads to a high 'mutational load'. This reduces the average fitness
    of the population. Therefore, there is strong and constant natural selection to
    reduce the mutation rate to minimize this load.

    Perfectly accurate DNA replication and repair mechanisms are metabolically expensive.
    Furthermore, in any population with a finite size, genetic drift is a factor.
    Selection to improve a trait is only effective if its fitness benefit (s) is
    stronger than drift (roughly, s > 1/Ne, where Ne is the effective population size).
    A mutation that slightly lowers an already low mutation rate offers a very small
    fitness benefit. Eventually, this benefit becomes too small for selection to 'see'
    it, and drift dominates. This 'drift barrier' prevents the rate from evolving to zero.
    The potential need for beneficial mutations for future adaptation is also a factor,
    but it's generally considered a weaker force than the constant pressure of deleterious mutations.

    The genomic mutation rate is maintained at an equilibrium. This is not necessarily a
    perfect 'optimum' (as per choice A), but a balance point. It is determined by the
