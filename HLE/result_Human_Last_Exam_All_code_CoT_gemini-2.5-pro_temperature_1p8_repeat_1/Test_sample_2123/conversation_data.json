    "This is a classic linguistic riddle. The solution relies on a phonetic pun between a Russian word and an English name. Here is the plan to solve it using a script:\n\n1.  Identify the key descriptive phrase in the problem: \"wide boulevards\".\n2.  Translate this phrase into Russian. The word for \"wide\" is \"широкий\" (shirokiy).\n3.  Note the phonetic similarity between the Russian word \"широкий\" (shirokiy) and the surname of a famous English poet.\n4.  The script will print out these steps to demonstrate the connection and reveal the name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the steps to solve the Vienna boulevards riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The riddle describes the 'wide boulevards' of Vienna.\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Translate the key descriptive word 'wide' into Russian.\")\n    \n    russian_word = \"широкий\"\n    transliteration = \"shirokiy\"\n    print(f\"The Russian word for 'wide' is '{russian_word}', which is pronounced roughly as '{transliteration}'.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Find the English poet's surname that sounds like this Russian word.\")\n    \n    poet_surname = \"Shelley\"\n    print(f\"The pronunciation '{transliteration}' is phonetically very similar to the surname of the English Romantic poet, Percy Bysshe {poet_surname}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- The Final 'Equation' ---\")\n    print(f\"Russian for 'wide' ('{russian_word}') ==> sounds like ==> English poet's name ('{poet_surname}')\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Shelley>>>"
