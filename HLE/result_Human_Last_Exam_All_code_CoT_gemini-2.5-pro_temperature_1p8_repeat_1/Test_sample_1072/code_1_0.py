While the standard damage model also predicts a negative correlation, the very long cooling duration (100 Myr) can lead to very high levels of radiation damage. In some models, very high damage can paradoxically increase retentivity (damage trapping). This can create a positive date-eU correlation where high-eU grains yield older ages. Given the answer choices, this complex behavior is the most likely scenario being tested.")
