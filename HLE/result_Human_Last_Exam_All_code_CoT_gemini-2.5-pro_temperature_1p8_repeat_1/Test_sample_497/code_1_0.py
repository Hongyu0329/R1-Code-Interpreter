# This script calculates the value of capacitor x such that the equivalent
# capacitance of the ladder network is independent of the number of cells N.

# From the analysis, the condition for this independence is that the terminating
# capacitor x must be equal to the characteristic capacitance of the ladder.
# The characteristic capacitance (C_fp) was found by solving the fixed-point equation:
# 3 * C_fp**2 = c**2
# which gives C_fp = c / sqrt(3).

# Therefore, x must be equal to c / sqrt(3).
