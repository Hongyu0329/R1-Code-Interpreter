    # Part (a)
    print("\nPart (a): Does superintegrability hold for n=3 in the matrix model Z_{-3}(t)?")
    print("\nStep 1: Define 'Superintegrability'.")
    print("In the context of matrix models, superintegrability often implies that the coefficients in the character expansion of the partition function have a simple product structure over the cells of the Young diagram indexing the character (Schur function).")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyze the expansion coefficients.")
    print("The partition function is given by Z_{-n}(t) = sum_lambda C_lambda * s_lambda(t).")
    print("The coefficient is C_lambda = s_lambda(1) * s_lambda(delta_{k,n}) / s_lambda(delta_{k,1}).")
    print("Analysis of the terms shows that C_lambda is proportional to (product_{c in lambda} (N + content(c))) * chi^lambda(n^k), where |lambda|=nk and chi^lambda is a character of the symmetric group.")

    print("\nStep 3: Evaluate for n=3.")
    print("For n=3, the coefficient C_lambda depends on the character chi^lambda(3^k).")
    print("This character value does not, for a general partition lambda, have a simple product formula over the cells of the diagram.")
    print("For instance, for the partition lambda=(2,1) of size 3, the character chi^{(2,1)} on the cycle class (3) is -1, which cannot be produced by a simple product of factors associated with the cells.")
    
    print("\nConclusion for (a): Because the coefficients lack a simple product formula, the model is not considered superintegrable for n=3.")
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b)
    print("\nPart (b): For n=4, is the operator W_hat_{-4} necessary to generate Z_{-4}(t)?")
    
    print("\nStep 1: Identify the constraining algebra.")
    print("The dynamics of matrix models are constrained by a set of relations known as Ward identities, which form a W-algebra.")
    print("For a matrix model defined by a potential of highest degree 'm', the constraining algebra is generally the W_{m-1}-algebra.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: Determine the algebra for n=4.")
    print("The model Z_{-n}(t) is characterized by a potential term Tr(Phi_2^n). For n=4, this is a degree-4 potential.")
    print("Therefore, the corresponding constraining algebra is W_{4-1} = W_3.")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyze the W_3 algebra.")
    print("The W_3 algebra is generated by fundamental operators of spin 2 (the energy-momentum tensor of Virasoro algebra) and spin 3. It does not contain an independent, fundamental generator of spin 4.")
    
    print("\nStep 4: Conclude on the necessity of W_hat_{-4}.")
    print("If W_hat_{-4} is understood as a fundamental spin-4 operator, it is not necessary. The Z_{-4}(t) function is already fully described by the constraints of the W_3 algebra. Any necessary operator can be built from the spin-2 and spin-3 generators.")
    
    print("\nConclusion for (b): A fundamental operator W_hat_{-4} is not necessary.")
    answer_b = "No"
