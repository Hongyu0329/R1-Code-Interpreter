# The dimension of the ninth cohomology group of M with rational coefficients H^9(M, Q)
# As deduced from the step-by-step thinking process, the dimension is 0.

# H^9(M, Q) is isomorphic to (H^0(S^3) x H^9(M')) + (H^3(S^3) x H^6(M'))
# H^j(M') vanishes for j > 4 (rank of the arrangement)
# So, H^6(M') = 0 and H^9(M') = 0

dim_H0_S3 = 1
dim_H3_S3 = 1
dim_H9_M_prime = 0
dim_H6_M_prime = 0

# Calculate the dimension of H^9(M, Q)
dim_H9_M = dim_H0_S3 * dim_H9_M_prime + dim_H3_S3 * dim_H6_M_prime

# We still need to print the equation.
