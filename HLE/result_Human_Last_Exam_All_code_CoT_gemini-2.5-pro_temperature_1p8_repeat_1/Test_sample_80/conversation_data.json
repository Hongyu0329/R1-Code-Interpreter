    "To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares of a standard 8x8 chessboard. Then, we subtract this number from the total number of edge squares.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Calculate the total number of edge squares.** An 8x8 board has 4 sides, and each side has 8 squares. The 4 corner squares are counted twice, so the total number of edge squares is `(8 * 4) - 4 = 28`. Alternatively, it's `(8 - 1) * 4 = 28`.\n2.  **Understand bishop movement.** A bishop moves diagonally and always stays on squares of the same color (either light or dark). This means we can consider the placement on light squares and dark squares independently.\n3.  **Divide edge squares by color.** The 28 edge squares are split evenly between the two colors: 14 light squares and 14 dark squares.\n4.  **Determine the maximum number of bishops.** To place the maximum number of bishops, they must not attack each other. On the edge squares, any bishop placed can attack at most one other edge square. This attacked square will be of the same color and on an opposite edge. Therefore, the 14 edge squares of a single color form 7 diagonal pairs. To ensure the bishops are non-attacking, we can only place one bishop per pair. This means we can place a maximum of 7 bishops on the 14 light squares and 7 bishops on the 14 dark squares.\n5.  **Calculate the total number of bishops.** The total maximum number of bishops is the sum from both colors: `7 + 7 = 14`.\n6.  **Calculate the number of empty edge squares.** This is the total number of edge squares minus the number of squares occupied by bishops: `28 - 14 = 14`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_on_edge_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the\n    maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of a chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of squares on the edge of the board.\n    # An n x n board has 4 sides of (n-1) squares each.\n    total_edge_squares = (board_size - 1) * 4\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    # Bishops on light squares don't attack bishops on dark squares. The 28 edge\n    # squares are split into 14 light and 14 dark squares.\n    # Edge squares of a single color form diagonal pairs. For each pair,\n    # we can only place one bishop. So, the number of bishops is half the\n    # number of edge squares.\n    max_bishops_placed = total_edge_squares // 2\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate how many edge squares lack bishops.\n    # This is the total number of edge squares minus the number occupied by bishops.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops_placed\n\n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final calculation.\n    print(f\"A chessboard has {board_size}x{board_size} squares.\")\n    print(f\"The number of edge squares is: ({board_size} - 1) * 4 = {total_edge_squares}\")\n    print(f\"To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we can place one bishop for every two edge squares.
