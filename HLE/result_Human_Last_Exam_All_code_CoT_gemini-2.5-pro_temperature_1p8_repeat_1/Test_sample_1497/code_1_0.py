def solve_violin_puzzle():
  """
  This function prints the solution to the violin timbre puzzle.

  The solution is based on the following analysis:
  1. 'sul ponticello' affects the harmonic content of the string's vibration, which is controlled by nu (Group ii).
  2. A bridge mute adds mass to the bridge, altering the body's resonant frequencies, specifically lowering f_2 (Group iv, down).
  3. A helium environment changes the speed of sound, altering the air resonance f_1 (Group iii).
  4. Playing on the E string instead of the A string changes the open string's fundamental frequency, F (Group i).
