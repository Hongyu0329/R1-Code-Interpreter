    print("2. In wet conditions, a plant's pores (stomata) are open, CO2 is abundant, and the plant strongly selects for 12C. This leads to a LOW 13C ratio in its tissues.")
    print("3. In dry conditions (drought), stomata close to save water. CO2 becomes limited, forcing the plant to use more 13C. This leads to a HIGH 13C ratio.")

    print("\nA. An increase in tree ring thickness as the tree matures: Unlikely to be the predominant factor for a century-long trend across a region.")
    print("\nB. Periods of drought: Incorrect. Drought causes an INCREASE in the 13C ratio, which is the opposite of the observation.")
    print("\nC. Increased photosynthetic reserves of starch fueling tree growth: This is a result of environmental conditions, not the primary cause of the isotopic trend.")
    print("\nD. Thinning earlywood tree ring proportion: This is a structural change within the ring, not the primary environmental driver.")
    print("\nE. Changes in the SE Asia monsoon: Correct. The monsoon controls regional rainfall. A shift towards a wetter climate from the monsoon would reduce tree water stress, allowing for greater discrimination against 13C, and thus causing the observed declining 13C ratio over the period from {} to {}.".format(start_year, end_year))
