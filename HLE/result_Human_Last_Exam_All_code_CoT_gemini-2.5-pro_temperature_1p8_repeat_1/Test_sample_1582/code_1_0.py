    """
    This function simulates a Markov chain that fits the described properties
    to demonstrate it is not positive recurrent.

    The Markov Chain:
    - State space Î£ = {0, 1, 2, ...}.
    - Transitions:
      - From state 0, always move to 1: p(0, 1) = 1.
      - From state x > 0, move to x+1 with probability p=0.6, and to x-1 with probability q=0.4.
    - This chain is irreducible.

    The Function f and Set A:
    - Let A = {0}, which is a finite set.
    - Let f(x) = 1.5^x. This function is non-negative and f(x) -> infinity as x -> infinity.

    Checking the condition sum(p(x,y)f(y)) - f(x) >= 0 for x not in A:
    For x > 0:
    E[f(X_1) | X_0=x] - f(x) = [p * f(x+1) + q * f(x-1)] - f(x)
                            = [0.6 * (1.5)^(x+1) + 0.4 * (1.5)^(x-1)] - (1.5)^x
                            = (1.5)^x * [0.6 * 1.5 + 0.4 / 1.5 - 1]
                            = (1.5)^x * [0.9 + 0.266... - 1]
                            = (1.5)^x * [0.166...] > 0.
    The condition holds.
    
    The simulation will show that many paths starting from 0 never return,
    implying the mean return time is infinite. This is a hallmark of a chain
    that is not positive recurrent.
