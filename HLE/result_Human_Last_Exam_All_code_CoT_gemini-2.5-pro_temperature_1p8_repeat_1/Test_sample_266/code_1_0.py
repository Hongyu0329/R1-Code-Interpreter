Step 2: Analyzing the relationship.
These explanations are not contradictory. They are complementary, nested descriptions of the same phenomenon.
- The neurobiological change (3) is the physical mechanism that creates the learned association (2).
- The learned association (2) is the scientific process that results in the psychological state of 'fear' (1).
They represent a single reality described from the perspectives of neuroscience, behavioral psychology, and everyday experience.

Step 3: Conclusion.
The three are different, testable hypotheses. However, they are so interconnected that the truth of one implies the truth of the others.
If the specific neural changes happen (3), they will cause the conditioned behavior (2), which is what we call 'becoming afraid' (1).
Therefore, they are different hypotheses, but if one is right, all must be right. This corresponds to choice D.
