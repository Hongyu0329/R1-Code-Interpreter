    "Based on information from drug identification databases, I will identify the unique numerical codes imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules. Then, I will provide a Python script to display these differing numbers as requested.\n\n```python\n# Define the numerical imprints for each capsule strength\nimprint_10mg = 3105\nimprint_20mg = 3109\n\n# Display the numbers found on each capsule\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is {imprint_10mg}.\")\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\n```\n<<<3105 and 3109>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
