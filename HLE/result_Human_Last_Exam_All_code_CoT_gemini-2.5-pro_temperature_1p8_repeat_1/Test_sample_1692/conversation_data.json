    "An elementary cellular automaton evolves in discrete steps. The state of a cell in the next step is determined by its own state and the states of its left and right neighbors in the current step. This process is governed by a specific rule, numbered from 0 to 255. The same rule applies to all cells and for all steps.\n\nTo solve this, we must find a rule (from 0-255) that satisfies both steps of the evolution:\n1.  The rule transforms the initial row (`01101001`) into the unknown intermediate row.\n2.  The same rule transforms that intermediate row into the final row (`10000111`).\n\nMy plan is to write a script that systematically tests every possible rule from 0 to 255. For each rule, it will:\n1.  Generate a candidate for the intermediate row by applying the rule to the first given row.\n2.  Apply the same rule to this new candidate row to generate a final row.\n3.  Compare the generated final row with the given final row.\n4.  If they match, the candidate intermediate row is the unique solution.\n\nThis process assumes periodic boundary conditions, meaning the grid of cells wraps around, which is a standard convention.\n\n```python\ndef solve_automaton_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the missing intermediate step in a 1D elementary cellular automaton\n    by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    row1_str = \"01101001\"\n    row3_str = \"10000111\"\n    \n    n = len(row1_str)\n    row1 = [int(char) for char in row1_str]\n    row3_target = [int(char) for char in row3_str]\n\n    def apply_rule(input_row, rule_num):\n        \"\"\"Applies a given ECA rule to an input row.\"\"\"\n        new_row = []\n        num_cells = len(input_row)\n        for i in range(num_cells):\n            # Get neighborhood with periodic (wrapping) boundaries\n            left_neighbor = input_row[(i - 1 + num_cells) % num_cells]\n            center_cell = input_row[i]\n            right_neighbor = input_row[(i + 1) % num_cells]\n\n            # The 3-cell pattern is treated as a 3-bit number (from 0 to 7)\n            pattern_value = (left_neighbor << 2) | (center_cell << 1) | right_neighbor\n            \n            # The output for this pattern is the corresponding bit of the rule number\n            new_state = (rule_num >> pattern_value) & 1\n            new_row.append(new_state)\n        return new_row\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible rules\n    for rule in range(256):\n        # Step 1: Generate candidate intermediate row from the first row\n        candidate_row2 = apply_rule(row1, rule)\n        \n        # Step 2: Generate final row from the candidate intermediate row\n        generated_row3 = apply_rule(candidate_row2, rule)\n        \n        # Step 3: Check if the generated final row matches the target\n        if generated_row3 == row3_target:\n            # If a match is found, print the solution and exit\n            solution_str = \"\".join(map(str, candidate_row2))\n            print(solution_str)\n            return\n\n# Running the solver function to find and print the intermediate step.\n# Note: Based on standard definitions, this specific problem appears to have a\n# contradiction that prevents a solution.
