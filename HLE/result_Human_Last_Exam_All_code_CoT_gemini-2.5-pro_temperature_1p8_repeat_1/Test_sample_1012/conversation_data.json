    "To determine the minimum length for a symmetric key to be secure against a quantum computer, we must consider the most effective quantum attack against symmetric ciphers.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Threat**: The primary quantum algorithm that threatens symmetric key cryptography is **Grover's algorithm**.\n2.  **Explain the Impact**: Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems. Brute-forcing a symmetric key is such a problem. This means that if a key has *N* bits, a classical computer requires approximately 2^N operations to find it, but a quantum computer only needs about sqrt(2^N) = 2^(N/2) operations. This effectively halves the bit-strength of the key.\n3.  **Establish a Security Baseline**: A key length of 128 bits (like in AES-128) is widely considered the minimum standard for strong security against *classical* computers today. This means we want our post-quantum cipher to provide at least 128 bits of security *against a quantum computer*.\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: To achieve 128 bits of security against a quantum attack that halves the effective key length, we need to double the key size. The calculation is: `Required Quantum-Resistant Key Length / 2 = Desired Security Level`.\n5.  **Write Code**: Create a Python script to demonstrate this simple calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_post_quantum_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length needed to resist attacks\n    from a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A widely accepted security level to protect against classical supercomputers is 128 bits.\n    # An attacker would need to perform, on average, 2^128 operations.\n    desired_security_level = 128\n\n    # Grover's algorithm for quantum computers provides a quadratic speedup,\n    # which means the number of operations is the square root of the classical case.\n    # This effectively halves the bit strength of the key (e.g., security_bits = key_length / 2).\n    # To find the required key length to achieve our desired security level, we must double it.\n    grovers_factor = 2\n    \n    min_quantum_resistant_key_length = desired_security_level * grovers_factor\n\n    print(\"### Post-Quantum Symmetric Key Length Calculation ###\")\n    print(f\"Desired security level (against any computer): {desired_security_level} bits\")\n    print(\"Quantum computers can use Grover's algorithm, which reduces effective key strength by a factor of 2.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo counteract this, the key length must be doubled.\")\n    print(\"The equation is: (New Key Length) / (Grover's Factor) = (Desired Security Level)\")\n    \n    # Printing the final equation with the numbers filled in\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: {min_quantum_resistant_key_length} / {grovers_factor} = {desired_security_level}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nConclusion: To achieve a security level of {desired_security_level} bits against a quantum computer, a symmetric key must be at least {min_quantum_resistant_key_length} bits long.\")\n\ncalculate_post_quantum_key_length()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
