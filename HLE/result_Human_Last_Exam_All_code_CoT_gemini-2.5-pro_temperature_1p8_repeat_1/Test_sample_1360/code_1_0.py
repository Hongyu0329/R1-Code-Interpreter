# The key to this problem is understanding the different time scales involved.
# The dominant factor is the one that sets the most critical constraint for individually measuring events.
# In a particle counting experiment, "individually measuring" primarily means avoiding event pile-up,
# which happens when two distinct events occur too close in time for the detector to resolve them.

# The rate at which events occur is given by the source activity.
activity_in_kBq = 1
activity_in_Bq = activity_in_kBq * 1000  # Convert kBq to Bq (decays per second)

# The average time between consecutive decay events is the reciprocal of the activity.
# This time scale dictates the required time resolution to keep pile-up low.
# Equation: T_avg = 1 / Activity
average_time_between_decays_s = 1 / activity_in_Bq

# For clarity, let's convert this time into milliseconds (ms) and microseconds (us).
average_time_between_decays_ms = average_time_between_decays_s * 1000
average_time_between_decays_us = average_time_between_decays_s * 1_000_000
