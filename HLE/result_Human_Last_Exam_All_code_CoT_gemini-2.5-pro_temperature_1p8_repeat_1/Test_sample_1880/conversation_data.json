    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure involving analyzing the polynomial's properties over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** We'll first determine if the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a prerequisite for this analysis. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant of the polynomial helps narrow down the possible Galois groups. Specifically, the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** The reducibility of a related cubic polynomial, the \"resolvent cubic,\" will further constrain the possibilities.\n4.  **Distinguish Final Cases:** Based on the results from the discriminant and the resolvent cubic, we will perform a final test to distinguish between the remaining possible groups ($D_4$ or $C_4$).\n\nThe following Python script will perform the necessary calculations for these steps and print the logical progression to the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14\n    # This is of the form x^4 + qx + r\n    q = 8\n    r = 14\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the order of the Galois group for f(x) = x^4 + {q}x + {r}.\")\n\n    # Step 1: Irreducibility\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Check for irreducibility over Q.\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2:\")\n    print(f\"p=2 divides the coefficients {q} and {r}.\")\n    print(\"p=2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\")\n    print(f\"p^2=4 does not divide the constant term {r}.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the polynomial f(x) is irreducible over Q.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Discriminant\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Compute the discriminant Delta.\")\n    # For a polynomial x^4 + qx + r, the discriminant is Delta = 256*r^3 - 27*q^4\n    delta = 256 * r**3 - 27 * q**4\n    print(f\"The discriminant formula is Delta = 256*r^3 - 27*q^4.\")\n    print(f\"Delta = 256*({r})^3 - 27*({q})^4\")\n    print(f\"Delta = 256*{r**3} - 27*{q**4}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {256 * r**3} - {27 * q**4} = {delta}\")\n    \n    sqrt_delta_int = math.isqrt(delta)\n    is_sq = sqrt_delta_int**2 == delta\n    print(f\"Is Delta a perfect square in Q? {is_sq}\")\n    if not is_sq:\n        print(\"Since Delta is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group A_4.\")\n        print(\"This rules out A_4 and V_4, leaving S_4, D_4, or C_4 as possibilities.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Resolvent Cubic\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Analyze the resolvent cubic g(t) = t^3 - 4*r*t - q^2.\")\n    rc_c = -4 * r\n    rc_d = -q**2\n    print(f\"g(t) = t^3 - 4*({r})*t - ({q})^2\")\n    print(f\"g(t) = t^3 + {rc_c}t + {rc_d}\")\n    print(\"We test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem (integer divisors of -64).\")\n    \n    # Based on the theorem, we test integer divisors of -64.
