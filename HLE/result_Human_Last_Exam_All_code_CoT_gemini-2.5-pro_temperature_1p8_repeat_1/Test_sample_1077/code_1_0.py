    The letter's text, which expresses a profound disappointment with a personal encounter
    with Heidegger despite admiring his work "Being and Time," is a well-documented piece
    of correspondence from the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. He wrote it in 1934
    after visiting Heidegger in Freiburg, an encounter that he had hoped would be a meeting
    of minds but which left him feeling disconnected and misunderstood.
