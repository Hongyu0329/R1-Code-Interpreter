    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to determine the value of \\( m_{4/7} \\). Based on definitions found in the study of cluster algebras and related fields, the generalized Markov number \\( m_{k/n} \\) is an integer derived from the continued fraction of the rational number \\( n/k \\).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Find the continued fraction of \\( n/k = 7/4 \\)**.\n    The continued fraction expansion of a rational number \\( n/k \\) gives a sequence of integer coefficients, \\([a_1; a_2, \\dots, a_r]\\).\n\n2.  **Define the associated matrices**.\n    For each coefficient \\(a_i\\), we define a matrix \\(X_a = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n3.  **Compute the matrix product**.\n    The generalized Markov number \\( m_{k/n} \\) is defined as the trace of the matrix product formed by these matrices in reverse order of the continued fraction coefficients:\n    \\( U_{k/n} = X_{a_r} X_{a_{r-1}} \\cdots X_{a_1} \\).\n    So, \\( m_{k/n} = \\text{Tr}(U_{k/n}) \\).\n\n4.  **Compute the continued fraction of \\( m_{4/7} \\)**.\n    Once we have the integer value of \\( m_{4/7} \\), the final step is to find its continued fraction, which for an integer is trivial.\n\nLet's execute the plan:\n\n*   **Step 1: Continued fraction of 7/4**\n    \\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = 1 + \\frac{1}{4/3} \\)\n    \\( \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n    So, \\( \\frac{7}{4} = [1; 1, 3] \\). The coefficients are \\(a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=3\\).\n\n*   **Step 2 & 3: Matrix calculation**\n    We need to compute the trace of \\( U_{4/7} = X_3 X_1 X_1 \\).\n    \\( X_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n    \\( X_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n    First, compute the product \\( X_1 X_1 \\):\n    \\( X_1 X_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n    Now, multiply by \\(X_3\\) from the left:\n    \\( U_{4/7} = X_3 (X_1 X_1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n    The generalized Markov number is the trace of this matrix:\n    \\( m_{4/7} = \\text{Tr}(U_{4/7}) = -1 + (-1) = -2 \\).\n\n*   **Step 4: Continued fraction of -2**\n    The number is \\( -2 \\), which is an integer. The continued fraction of any integer \\( z \\) is simply \\( [z] \\).\n    Therefore, the continued fraction of \\( -2 \\) is \\( [-2] \\).\n\nThe following Python code implements this computation and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_continued_fraction_coeffs(n, d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the regular continued fraction coefficients for n/d.\n    Assumes n, d are integers and d > 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    coeffs = []\n    if d == 0:\n        return []\n    while d != 0:\n        q = n // d\n        r = n % d\n        coeffs.append(q)\n        n, d = d, r\n    return coeffs\n\ndef compute_generalized_markov_number(k, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the generalized Markov number m_{k/n}.\n    This is defined as the trace of a matrix product derived from the\n    continued fraction of n/k.\n    n/k = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_r]\n    m_{k/n} = tr(X_{a_r} * ... * X_{a_1})\n    where X_a = [[a, 1], [-1, 0]]\n    \"\"\"\n    if k == 0 or n == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"k and n must be non-zero\")\n    \n    # Get continued fraction coefficients for n/k\n    # For k/n = 4/7, we compute for n/k = 7/4\n    coeffs = get_continued_fraction_coeffs(n, k)\n\n    # Matrix generator\n    def get_X(a):\n        return np.array([[a, 1], [-1, 0]], dtype=int)\n\n    # Calculate the matrix product U = X_{a_r} * ... * X_{a_1}\n    if not coeffs:\n        return None \n\n    # Initialize U with the last matrix in the product sequence\n    # This corresponds to the last coefficient a_r\n    U = get_X(coeffs[-1])\n\n    # Multiply from the right by the other matrices in reverse order of coefficients\n    for i in range(len(coeffs) - 2, -1, -1):\n        U = U @ get_X(coeffs[i])\n        \n    markov_number = int(np.trace(U))\n    return markov_number\n\ndef get_cf_for_integer(num):\n    \"\"\"Computes the trivial continued fraction for an integer.\"\"\"\n    return [num]\n\n# Given values\nk = 4\nn = 7\n\n# Compute the generalized Markov number m_{4/7}\nmarkov_number = compute_generalized_markov_number(k, n)\n\n# Compute the continued fraction of the resulting number\nfinal_cf_coeffs = get_cf_for_integer(markov_number)\n\n# Print the results as requested\nprint(f\"The generalized Markov number m_{k}/{n} is: {markov_number}\")\nprint(f\"The continued fraction associated with {markov_number} is: {final_cf_coeffs}\")\nprint(f\"The final equation is {markov_number} = {final_cf_coeffs[0]}\")\nfor coeff in final_cf_coeffs:\n    print(f\"The coefficient in the expansion is: {coeff}\")\n\n```\n<<<-2>>>"
