    "Of course. The task is to identify the common name for the space-time double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function within the nuclear criticality community and present this information using a Python script.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will define the generalized pair correlation function, `G(Δr, Δt)`, which describes the statistical correlation between neutron detections separated by a vector `Δr` in space and an interval `Δt` in time.\n2.  Next, I will formulate its double Fourier transform, `S(k, ω)`, which involves integrating over both space and time, transforming into the conjugate wavevector (`k`) and frequency (`ω`) domains.\n3.  The core of the task is to identify the name of `S(k, ω)`. In formal statistical physics, this is called the \"Dynamic Structure Factor.\" However, in the applied field of nuclear criticality safety and reactor analysis, it is more commonly known by its signal processing name.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that programmatically prints the definition of the transform and clearly states its common name, satisfying the user's request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef describe_correlation_transform():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and identifies the space-time double Fourier transform\n    of the generalized pair correlation function as used in nuclear engineering.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Define Mathematical Symbols ---\n    correlation_func = \"G(Δr, Δt)\"\n    transformed_func = \"S(k, ω)\"\n    spatial_separation = \"Δr\"\n    time_separation = \"Δt\"\n    wavevector = \"k\"\n    angular_frequency = \"ω\"\n    imaginary_unit = \"i\"\n\n    # --- Define the Transform Equation ---\n    # The equation defines S(k, ω) as the transform of G(Δr, Δt)\n    # The exponent is exp[i(ωt - k·r)], a standard plane wave form.\n    # Note: exp[-i(k·Δr - ω·Δt)] is mathematically equivalent.\n    transform_equation = (f\"{transformed_func} = \"\n                          f\"∫d³{spatial_separation} ∫d{time_separation} {correlation_func} \"\n                          f\"* exp[{imaginary_unit}({angular_frequency}{time_separation} - {wavevector}·{spatial_separation})]\")\n\n    # --- Identify the Common Name ---\n    formal_name = \"Dynamic Structure Factor\"\n    community_name = \"Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the neutron noise\"\n\n    # --- Print the Explanation ---\n    print(\"The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is a key quantity in nuclear noise analysis.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"1.
