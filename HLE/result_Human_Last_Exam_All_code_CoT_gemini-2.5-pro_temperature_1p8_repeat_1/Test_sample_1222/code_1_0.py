    # Part (a): Does the existence of a non-zero sigma(a) imply g acts by a reflection?
    
    # The definition of the quiver-Taft map σ is built upon the action of a map g.
    # The problem statement specifies that "g acts as a reflection on Q with g . e_i = e_{n-d-i}".
    # This means the reflective nature of g is a given premise, a part of the setup required
    # for the map σ to be defined in the first place.
    # The condition that σ(a) is non-zero for all arrows 'a' is a property of the specific map σ,
    # not a condition that determines the action of g.
    # Therefore, the answer is yes, by definition.

    # Part (b): Provide a condition on d for which sigma(a) != 0 must hold for all a in Q_1.

    # The key defining property of sigma is the relation: σ(g . a) = λ⁻¹ g . σ(a).
    # We want to find a condition on 'd' that prevents σ(a) from being forced to be 0.
    
    # A potential issue arises if an arrow 'a' is a fixed point of g, i.e., g . a = a.
    # This would require the source vertex s(a)=i to be a fixed point: g . e_i = e_i.
    # Using the definition of g's action, we get: e_{n-d-i} = e_i.
    # This equality of vertices implies an equality of their indices, leading to the equation:
    # n - d - i = i
    # which can be rearranged to:
    # n - d = 2 * i
    
    # For a fixed arrow a, the relation for σ becomes σ(a) = λ⁻¹ g . σ(a).
    # This requires σ(a) to be a non-zero eigenvector of g. If no such eigenvector exists
    # in the corresponding path space, σ(a) must be 0.
    
    # To guarantee that σ(a) can be non-zero for all arrows 'a' in any quiver, we should
    # choose 'd' such that g can have no fixed points. This avoids the problematic scenario.
    # Looking at the equation n - d = 2 * i, it has an integer solution for 'i' if and only
    # if (n - d) is an even number.
    
    # Therefore, to ensure no fixed points exist, (n - d) must be an odd number.
