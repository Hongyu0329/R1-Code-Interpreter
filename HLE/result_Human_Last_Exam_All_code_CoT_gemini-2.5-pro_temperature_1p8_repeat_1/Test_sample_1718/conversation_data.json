    "To determine the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, we need to consider the special symmetries imposed by the Kähler structure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce Kähler Manifolds and Dimension:** A Kähler manifold is a special type of Riemannian manifold with an even real dimension, `n`. We express this as `n = 2m`, where `m` is the complex dimension of the manifold.\n2.  **Analyze Symmetries:** The Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold has additional symmetries compared to a general Riemannian manifold. In a suitable complex coordinate system, the only non-zero components are of the form $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$, where indices without a bar are holomorphic (from 1 to `m`) and indices with a bar are anti-holomorphic. These components have the following symmetries:\n    *   $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\gamma\\bar{\\beta}\\alpha\\bar{\\delta}}$ (symmetry in first and third indices)\n    *   $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\delta}\\gamma\\bar{\\beta}}$ (symmetry in second and fourth indices)\n    *   $\\overline{R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}} = R_{\\beta\\bar{\\alpha}\\delta\\bar{\\gamma}}$ (reality/Hermitian symmetry)\n3.  **Derive the Formula:** The first two symmetries imply that the tensor is defined by its components on symmetric pairs of holomorphic indices and symmetric pairs of anti-holomorphic indices. Let $N$ be the number of such symmetric pairs for a space of dimension `m`, which is $N = \\binom{m+1}{2} = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$. The tensor can then be viewed as an $N \\times N$ matrix. The third symmetry condition implies this matrix is Hermitian. An $N \\times N$ Hermitian matrix has $N^2$ independent real components.\n4.  **Final Formula:** Therefore, the number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` is given by the formula:\n    Number of components = $\\left(\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\\right)^2$.\n5.  **Implementation:** I will provide a Python script that calculates this number for any given complex dimension `m` and demonstrates it for the first few dimensions. The simplest non-trivial case is for `m=2` (a 4-dimensional real manifold, like a K3 surface), which serves as a good canonical example.\n\n```python\ndef count_riemann_components_kahler(m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m.\n\n    Args:\n        m (int): The complex dimension of the Kähler manifold.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The number of independent components.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(m, int) or m <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: The complex dimension 'm' must be a positive integer.\")\n        return None\n\n    # The formula is (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2.\n    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We will show the calculation step-by-step.\n    \n    term1 = m\n    term2 = m + 1\n    divisor = 2\n    \n    # Calculate the base of the exponent, N\n    base = (term1 * term2) // divisor\n    \n    # Square the result to get the final count\n    num_components = base ** 2\n\n    print(f\"For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m = {m} (real dimension n = {2*m}):\")\n    print(\"The number of independent components is given by the formula: (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2\")\n    \n    # Printing each number in the equation for clarity\n    print(\"\\nCalculation steps:\")\n    print(f\"1.
