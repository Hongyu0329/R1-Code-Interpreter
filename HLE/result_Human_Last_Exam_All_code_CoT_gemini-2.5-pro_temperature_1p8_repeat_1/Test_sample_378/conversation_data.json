    "Based on my research, the user's question contains a factual inaccuracy. Former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name. The name likely being confused is that of Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria.\n\nTherefore, the event the user is asking about—Goodluck Jonathan publicly identifying as \"Azikiwe\"—never occurred.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will print a clear explanation of this, correcting the user's premise.\n\n```python\ndef explain_name_discrepancy():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints an explanation regarding the name in the user's query.\n  \"\"\"\n  explanation = \"\"\"\nThere appears to be a confusion in the name provided.\nThe full name of the former President of Nigeria is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his recorded name. It is possible you are thinking of Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria (from 1963 to 1966).\n\nBecause \"Azikiwe\" is not part of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name, there is no public record or year in which he identified himself as such.\n\"\"\"\n  print(explanation)\n\nexplain_name_discrepancy()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe, as it is not part of his name.>>>"
