There appears to be a confusion in the name provided.
The full name of the former President of Nigeria is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.

The name "Azikiwe" is not part of his recorded name. It is possible you are thinking of Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria (from 1963 to 1966).

Because "Azikiwe" is not part of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name, there is no public record or year in which he identified himself as such.
