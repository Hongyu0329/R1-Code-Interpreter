    "An separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Often, these are the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points. Here is a step-by-step plan to find the separatrix for the given system:\n\n1.  **Find Equilibrium Points**: First, we need to find the points $(u, d)$ where both $u'(t)$ and $d'(t)$ are zero. These are the steady states of the system.\n    -   $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $u=1$.\n    -   Substituting these values into $d'(t)=0$ gives us three equilibrium points: $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n2.  **Classify Equilibrium Points**: Next, we linearize the system around each equilibrium point by computing the Jacobian matrix. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian at a point determine the stability and type of that point.\n    -   The analysis will show that $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (a source), and $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point. The point $(0,0)$ is a degenerate equilibrium.\n\n3.  **Identify the Separatrix**: The separatrix we are looking for is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$. This is a special trajectory that emanates from the saddle. Trajectories on either side of this manifold will have different fates. Based on the phase portrait, this separatrix connects the saddle point $(1,-1)$ with the equilibrium point $(0,0)$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Equation of the Separatrix**:\n    -   We can hypothesize that the separatrix has a simple polynomial form, like a parabola: $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$.\n    -   We use the properties of this specific trajectory to find the coefficients $a, b, c$:\n        a.  The curve must pass through the equilibrium point $(0,0)$. This implies $d(0)=0$, which gives $c=0$.\n        b.  The curve must pass through the saddle point $(1, -1)$. This implies $d(1)=-1$, which gives $a+b = -1$.\n        c.  The slope of the curve at the saddle point must match the direction of the unstable eigenvector of the Jacobian at that point. The unstable eigenvector for $(1,-1)$ has a slope of $dd/du = -2$. The slope of our polynomial is $d'(u) = 2au+b$. At $u=1$, the slope is $2a+b$. So, $2a+b=-2$.\n    -   Solving this system of linear equations for $a$ and $b$ gives $a=-1$ and $b=0$.\n\n5.  **Final Equation**: The resulting equation for the separatrix is $d = -u^2$. We can verify that this curve is indeed a trajectory of the system by substituting it back into the differential equation for the phase plane, $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic calculations and derive the equation of the separatrix.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the separatrix for the given system of differential equations\n    by systematically identifying the saddle point and its unstable manifold.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the variables and the system of differential equations\n    u, d = sp.symbols('u d')\n    u_prime = (u - 1) * u**2\n    d_prime = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u*(1 - u)*u**2\n\n    # Find equilibrium points by solving d'(t)=0 and u'(t)=0\n    equilibria = sp.solve([u_prime, d_prime], [u, d])\n    \n    # Compute the Jacobian matrix of the system\n    J = sp.Matrix([u_prime, d_prime]).jacobian([u, d])\n\n    # Identify the saddle point (1, -1)\n    saddle_point = (1, -1)\n    J_saddle = J.subs({u: saddle_point[0], d: saddle_point[1]})\n\n    # Find the eigenvectors of the Jacobian at the saddle point\n    eigenvects = J_saddle.eigenvects()\n    \n    unstable_eigenvector = None\n    # The unstable manifold corresponds to the positive eigenvalue\n    for eigval, multiplicity, vectors in eigenvects:\n        if eigval > 0:\n            unstable_eigenvector = vectors[0]\n            break\n\n    # Calculate the slope of the unstable manifold at the saddle point\n    m_saddle = unstable_eigenvector[1] / unstable_eigenvector[0]\n\n    # Assume the separatrix is a quadratic polynomial d = a*u**2 + b*u + c\n    a, b, c = sp.symbols('a b c')\n    d_poly = a*u**2 + b*u + c\n\n    # Set up equations to find the coefficients a, b, c\n    # The separatrix connects the saddle (1,-1) to the equilibrium (0,0)\n    # Condition 1: The curve passes through (0,0)\n    eq1 = d_poly.subs(u, 0) - 0\n    # Condition 2: The curve passes through the saddle point (1,-1)\n    eq2 = d_poly.subs(u, saddle_point[0]) - saddle_point[1]\n    # Condition 3: The slope at the saddle point matches the unstable eigenvector\n    d_poly_derivative = sp.diff(d_poly, u)\n    eq3 = d_poly_derivative.subs(u, saddle_point[0]) - m_saddle\n    \n    # Solve for the coefficients\n    coeffs = sp.solve([eq1, eq2, eq3], [a, b, c])\n    a_val = coeffs[a]\n    b_val = coeffs[b]\n    c_val = coeffs[c]\n\n    # Print the equation of the separatrix and its constituent numbers\n    print(\"The equation of the separatrix is d = a * u**2 + b * u + c.\")\n    print(\"The numbers in this equation are:\")\n    print(f\"a = {a_val}\")\n    print(f\"b = {b_val}\")\n    print(f\"c = {c_val}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe simplified equation is d = -u**2, or d + u**2 = 0.\")\n\nfind_separatrix()\n```\n<<<d = -u**2>>>"
