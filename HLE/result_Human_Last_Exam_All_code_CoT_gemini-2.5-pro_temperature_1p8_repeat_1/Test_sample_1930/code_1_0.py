# The analysis shows that the set of digitary functions is the vector space
# of affine functions f(x) = a*x + b. This space is spanned by two
# linearly independent functions, for example, the constant function f(x)=1
# and the identity function f(x)=x. Therefore, the dimension is 2.

dimension = 2

# "output each number in the final equation!"
# The final conclusion is that the dimension is 2. The most natural
# interpretation is to output this number.
