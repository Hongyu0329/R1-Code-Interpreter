    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group Parameters**: The problem specifies the \"semidihedral group of size 512\". A semidihedral group, denoted as $SD_n$, has an order (size) of $2^n$. First, I will determine the value of `n` by solving the equation $2^n = 512$.\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups**: A power subgroup, denoted $G^m$, is the set of all $m$-th powers of the elements in a group $G$. To find all distinct power subgroups, we only need to check exponents `m` that are divisors of the group's exponent (the lcm of all element orders). For $SD_n$, the exponent is $2^{n-1}$.\n3.  **Enumerate and Analyze the Subgroups**: I will systematically list the power subgroups corresponding to each divisor of the exponent. For $SD_n$, these are of the form $G^{2^k}$ for $k$ from $0$ to $n-1$. I will determine the structure of each of these subgroups.\n4.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups**: By analyzing the list of generated subgroups, I will check if they are all unique. Since they have different orders, they are indeed distinct. The total count will be the final answer.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will create a Python script that follows these steps. The script will calculate `n` from the group size and then print an explanation of the calculation, including the list of all distinct power subgroups, and finally state the total number. This aligns with the request to show the reasoning and the numbers involved.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_semidihedral_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral\n    group of a given size.\n\n    A power subgroup G^m is the set {g^m | g in G}.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # Step 1: Find the parameter 'n' for the semidihedral group SD_n.\n    # The order of SD_n is 2^n.
