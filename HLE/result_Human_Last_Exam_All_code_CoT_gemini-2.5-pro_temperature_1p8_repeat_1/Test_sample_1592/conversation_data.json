    "I will determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, by following these steps:\n1.  **Identify Geographic Coordinates:** I'll start by finding the latitude and longitude of the Waskaganish gathering place in Quebec.\n2.  **Select Representative Points:** For each neighboring province and territory (Ontario, Nunavut, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick), I will select a representative geographic point. To get the most accurate result, I will choose a point on their border that is closest to Waskaganish.\n3.  **Calculate Distances:** I will use the Haversine formula, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere, to find the distance from Waskaganish to each representative point.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** Finally, I will compare the calculated distances. The province or territory with the smallest distance will be the answer.\n\nI will implement this logic in a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef haversine_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the great-circle distance in kilometers between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Earth radius in kilometers\n    R = 6371.0\n\n    # convert decimal degrees to radians\n    lat1_rad = math.radians(lat1)\n    lon1_rad = math.radians(lon1)\n    lat2_rad = math.radians(lat2)\n    lon2_rad = math.radians(lon2)\n\n    # differences\n    dlon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n    dlat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n\n    # haversine formula\n    a = math.sin(dlat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(dlon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n    distance = R * c\n\n    return distance\n\ndef find_closest_province_or_territory():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, QC (outside of Quebec).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coordinates for Waskaganish, Quebec\n    waskaganish_coords = {\"lat\": 51.49, \"lon\": -78.76}\n\n    # Representative points for neighboring provinces and territories\n    locations = {\n        \"Ontario\": {\"lat\": 51.49, \"lon\": -79.52},  # Point on the ON-QC border at same latitude\n        \"Nunavut\": {\"lat\": 52.9, \"lon\": -81.0},    # Southern coast of Akimiski Island\n        \"Newfoundland and Labrador\": {\"lat\": 51.42, \"lon\": -57.11}, # Near the border at Blanc-Sablon\n        \"New Brunswick\": {\"lat\": 47.37, \"lon\": -68.32} # City of Edmundston near the border\n    }\n\n    distances = {}\n\n    print(f\"Calculating distance from Waskaganish, QC ({waskaganish_coords['lat']}° N, {abs(waskaganish_coords['lon'])}° W):\\n\")\n\n    for loc, coords in locations.items():\n        dist = haversine_distance(\n            waskaganish_coords[\"lat\"], waskaganish_coords[\"lon\"],\n            coords[\"lat\"], coords[\"lon\"]\n        )\n        distances[loc] = dist\n        print(f\"To {loc}: approximately {dist:.2f} km\")\n\n    # Find the location with the minimum distance\n    closest_location = min(distances, key=distances.get)\n    min_distance = distances[closest_location]\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is {closest_location}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_closest_province_or_territory()\n```\n<<<Ontario>>>"
