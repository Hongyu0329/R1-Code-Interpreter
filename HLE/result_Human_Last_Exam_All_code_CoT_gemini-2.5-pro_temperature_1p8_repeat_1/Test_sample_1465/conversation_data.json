    "To determine the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil sequences, I will use a well-established method from structural biology. The oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a coiled-coil is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions of its heptad repeat (`abcdefg`).\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Identify the correct heptad repeat \"phasing\" for each sequence to locate the 'a' and 'd' positions. Based on sequence analysis, most sequences use a `gabcdef` register, while one uses a `defgabc` register.\n2.  Extract the amino acid residues from these 'a' and 'd' positions.\n3.  Apply a set of predictive rules, largely based on the foundational work by Harbury et al., which link specific `(a, d)` amino acid pairings to oligomeric states:\n    *   `(a=I, d=I)` → Tetramer\n    *   `(a=I, d=L)` → Trimer\n    *   `(a=L, d=I)` → Dimer\n4.  For non-canonical pairs found in the sequences, I will apply rules based on biophysical principles (e.g., side-chain size and polarity).\n5.  Handle an apparent typo in the second sequence to make it a standard 4-heptad repeat.\n6.  Finally, the script will print the predicted oligomeric state for each of the five sequences.\n\n```python\ndef predict_coiled_coil_states():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil sequences based on the residues\n    at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequences = [\n        \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\",\n        \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\",\n        \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\",\n        \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\",\n        \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\",\n    ]\n\n    oligomer_states = []\n\n    # --- Analysis for each sequence ---\n\n    # Sequence 1: EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\n    # Phasing is 'gabcdef'.
