    "My plan is to identify the mushroom genus that is famously associated with the color blue. The question specifies a blue spore print, which is a common mycological misconception. The correct answer pertains to a genus that includes a well-known and distinctly blue mushroom species, leading to this trivia question, even though the species' spore print is actually a different color. I will write a Python script to print the name of this genus.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mushroom_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the mushroom genus that is famously,\n    albeit incorrectly, associated with having a blue spore print due to the\n    distinctly blue color of one of its prominent species, Lactarius indigo.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus is Lactarius. The species Lactarius indigo is famous for its blue color and blue \"milk\" (latex).\n    # However, its spore print is actually yellowish to cream.
