print("\n--- Part 1: Immediate and Systemic Management ---")
print(f"The patient presented late ({patient_data['Time_to_Hospital']} hours) with significant trauma and uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c of {patient_data['HbA1c']}%). The priorities are:")
print("1. Medical Stabilization: Urgent consultation with a physician to begin management of diabetes mellitus. Poor glycemic control significantly impairs wound healing and increases the risk of infection.")
print("2. Acute Dental Care: Thorough cleaning and irrigation of the wounds. Radiographs (X-rays) are essential to check for bone fractures or retained tooth fragments.")
print("3. Infection Control: Due to the delay and contamination, systemic antibiotics and a tetanus shot evaluation are necessary.")

print("\n--- Part 2: Cells of Interest in Healing ---")
print("The key cells involved in the healing of the tooth sockets and surrounding tissues are:")
print("- Inflammatory Cells: Neutrophils and macrophages are the first responders to clean the wound and fight off bacteria.")
print("- Tissue Regeneration Cells: Fibroblasts synthesize collagen for soft tissue repair. Osteoblasts build new bone to fill in the sockets, while Osteoclasts remodel the existing alveolar bone.")

print("\n--- Part 3: Prosthetic Replacement Plan (Interim Phase) ---")
print("Immediate definitive replacement (like implants) is contraindicated due to poor diabetic control.")
print("An interim (temporary) solution is the most appropriate first step.")
print("- Recommended Denture: Interim Removable Partial Denture (RPD).")
print("- Rationale: It restores aesthetics and function quickly without invasive surgery, allowing the gums and bone to heal properly. It is a safe choice while the patient's systemic health is being optimized.")
print("- Material: Acrylic Resin. It is cost-effective and easy to adjust.")
print("- Abutment Teeth: The teeth supporting the denture would be the Left Central Incisor and the Left Second Premolar.")
print("- Rationale for Abutments: These are the teeth directly adjacent to the gap. They provide the necessary support and retention (using clasps) to hold the partial denture securely.")

print("\n--- Part 4: Significance of the SNB Angle ---")
print(f"An SNB angle of {patient_data['SNB_Angle']} degrees is high (normal ≈ 80°), indicating mandibular prognathism (a forward-positioned lower jaw), creating a Skeletal Class III profile. This anatomical information is critical for designing the bite and tooth arrangement of the final prosthesis to ensure it is stable and functional.")

print("\n--- Conceptual 'Management Complexity' Equation ---")
print("There is no literal mathematical formula for a clinical plan. However, to illustrate how the factors combine, we can create a conceptual equation:")
print("Management_Complexity = (Trauma + Late_Presentation) * Systemic_Factors + Dental_Complexity")
print("Plugging in the numbers from the case:")
print(f"Conceptual Value = (Tooth_Loss + [Delay:{patient_data['Time_to_Hospital']}h]) * ([HbA1c:{patient_data['HbA1c']}%] + Obesity) + [SNB_Angle:{patient_data['SNB_Angle']}°]")
print("This shows how each factor (trauma, delay, diabetes, skeletal pattern) adds a layer of complexity to the overall treatment.")
