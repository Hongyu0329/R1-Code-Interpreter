    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the initial value problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Type of Equation**: The given differential equation, $x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$, is a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. It is also a separable equation because it can be written in the form $\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(t)g(x)$.\n2.  **Separate the Variables**: We can rearrange the equation to group terms involving $x$ on one side and terms involving $t$ on the other. This gives us $\\frac{1}{x^2}dx = (t-1)dt$.\n3.  **Integrate Both Sides**: We will integrate both sides of the separated equation.\n    *   $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2}dx = \\int x^{-2}dx = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n    *   $\\int (t-1)dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$\n    Combining these with an integration constant $C$, we get the general solution: $-\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$.\n4.  **Apply the Initial Condition**: We are given $x(0)=-8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution to find the value of $C$.\n    *   $-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C$\n    *   $\\frac{1}{8} = C$\n5.  **Find the Particular Solution**: Now we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n    *   $-\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$\n6.  **Solve for x(1)**: Finally, we substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find the value of $x(1)$.\n    *   $-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}$\n    *   $-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = -\\frac{3}{8}$\n    *   $\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}$\n    *   $x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the steps.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# The problem is to solve x'(t) = (t-1)*x^2(t) with x(0) = -8 and find x(1).\n\n# Initial condition values\nt0 = 0\nx0 = -8\n\n# Find the constant C from the general solution -1/x = t^2/2 - t + C\n# C = -1/x0 - (t0^2/2 - t0)\nC = Fraction(-1, x0) - (Fraction(t0**2, 2) - Fraction(t0))\n\nprint(\"The general solution is of the form: -1/x(t) = t^2/2 - t + C\")\nprint(f\"Using the initial condition x({t0}) = {x0}, we find C:\")\nprint(f\"-1/({x0}) = ({t0})^2/2 - {t0} + C\")\nprint(f\"{Fraction(-1, x0)} = C\")\nprint(f\"So, the particular solution is: -1/x(t) = t^2/2 - t + {C}\")\nprint(\"\\nNow, we find x(1) by substituting t=1:\")\nprint(f\"-1/x(1) = (1)^2/2 - 1 + {C}\")\n\n# Calculate the right hand side of the equation for t=1\nt = 1\nrhs_val_1 = Fraction(t**2, 2)\nrhs_val_2 = -t\nrhs_val_3 = C\nrhs_total = rhs_val_1 + rhs_val_2 + rhs_val_3\n\nprint(f\"-1/x(1) = {rhs_val_1} - 1 + {rhs_val_3}\")\nprint(f\"-1/x(1) = {Fraction(4,8)} - {Fraction(8,8)} + {Fraction(1,8)}\")\nprint(f\"-1/x(1) = {rhs_total}\")\n\n# Solve for x(1)\nx1 = -1 / rhs_total\n\nprint(f\"Therefore, x(1) = 1 / ({-rhs_total})\")\nprint(f\"The final result is x(1) = {x1}\")\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
