    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will analyze the homotopy groups of the source and target spaces. This is a classic problem in algebraic topology. The general case involves a map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\to \\Omega(S^m \\wedge S^n)$. Here, $m=4$ and $n=6$.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Determine the connectivity of the source space, $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n2.  Determine the connectivity of the target space, $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n3.  Analyze the map on the first non-trivial homotopy group.\n4.  Conclude the connectivity of the map.\n\nA space is $k$-connected if all its homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for $i \\le k$. The connectivity of the map is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups $f_* : \\pi_i(\\text{source}) \\to \\pi_i(\\text{target})$ is an isomorphism for $i<k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the connectivity of the map\n    f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n    m = 4\n    n = 6\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the connectivity of the map f: Sigma(Omega S^{m} wedge Omega S^{n}) -> Omega(S^{m} wedge S^{n}) for m={m}, n={n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Connectivity of the source space\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the source space: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6)\")\n    conn_omega_sm = m - 2\n    print(f\"The loop space Omega S^{m} (for m>1) is (m-2)-connected.
