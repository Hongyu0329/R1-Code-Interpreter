**1) Hotspots for interaction with alpha-1 subunit (Residues in the Beta Interaction Domain - BID):**
The following residues in the human beta-1 subunit (UniProt P54289) are critical for high-affinity binding to the alpha-1 subunit's Alpha Interaction Domain (AID). They are located in the guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain and form a hydrophobic binding groove.
*   **W238 (Tryptophan):** Essential for forming a key hydrogen bond; its mutation abolishes binding.
*   **Y232 (Tyrosine):** Contributes to the hydrophobic surface of the binding groove.
*   **V262 (Valine) & A263 (Alanine):** Form part of the wall of the binding groove.
*   **I313 (Isoleucine), L314 (Leucine) & I317 (Isoleucine):** Part of an alpha-helix that packs against the AID helix.

**2) Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of alpha-1 subunit:**
The fine-tuning of channel gating is primarily controlled by regions outside the core binding domain, most notably the variable N-terminal domain.
*   **The N-terminal Domain (approx. residues 1-76):** This entire region dictates the specific modulatory signature of the beta-1 subunit, particularly its effect on inactivation kinetics.
*   **K30 (Lysine), K32 (Lysine), and K34 (Lysine):** These specific positively charged residues within the N-terminus have been identified as hotspots for mediating channel modulation by cellular signaling pathways (e.g., G-protein pathways), which is a key aspect of fine-tuning channel function in a physiological context.
