    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function `f`\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. By the given equation, this means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function $y \\mapsto e^y$ is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is injective must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\n3.  **Commutativity with exp:** We can establish a relationship between $f$ and the exponential function.\n    $f(e^x) = f(f(f(x)))$.\n    Also, by substituting $f(x)$ into the original equation for $x$, we get $f(f(f(x))) = e^{f(x)}$.\n    Therefore, we have the important property: $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$. This means $f$ and $\\exp$ commute.\n\n### Step 2: Rule out the case where `f` is strictly decreasing\n\nLet's assume $f$ is strictly decreasing.\nSince $f$ is a continuous and strictly decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range is $\\mathbb{R}$. This implies that:\n*   $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$\n*   $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$\n\nNow, let's examine the limit of the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$ as $x \\to -\\infty$.\nThe right-hand side is $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} e^x = 0$.\n\nFor the left-hand side, let $y = f(x)$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, we have $y \\to \\infty$. So,\n$\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to \\infty} f(y) = -\\infty$.\n\nEquating the limits, we get $-\\infty = 0$, which is a contradiction.\nTherefore, no such strictly decreasing function $f$ can exist.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly increasing\n\nSince $f$ cannot be decreasing, it must be strictly increasing.\n\n1.  **Behavior of `f` relative to `x`:** The function $g(x) = e^x$ has no fixed points, and $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If $f$ had a fixed point, $f(x_0)=x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$, which would imply $e^{x_0} = x_0$, a contradiction. So $f$ has no fixed points. Since $f$ is continuous, we must have either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\n    If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$.\n    But $f(f(x)) = e^x > x$. This is a contradiction.\n    Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Construction of Solutions:** We can construct the solutions, which demonstrates their existence and allows us to count them. The construction shows that a solution is uniquely determined by its behavior on a small interval.\n    Let's define a solution by specifying its value at $x=0$. Let $f(0) = c$.\n    From $f(x) > x$, we have $c = f(0) > 0$.\n    From the original equation, $f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$. This means $f(c) = 1$.\n    Since $f$ is strictly increasing and $c>0$, we have $f(c) > f(0)$, which implies $1 > c$.\n    So, any solution must satisfy $0 < c < 1$ for $c=f(0)$.\n\n    Now, let's build a solution based on this.\n    a. **Choose a constant `c`:** Pick any $c \\in (0, 1)$. There are $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum) choices for $c$.\n    b. **Define `f` on `[0, c]`:** We need to define $f$ on the interval $[0, c]$. We know $f(0) = c$ and $f(c) = 1$. Since $f$ must be continuous and strictly increasing, $f$ must map the interval $[0, c]$ to $[c, 1]$. Let's call this part of the function $\\phi$. So, $\\phi: [0, c] \\to [c, 1]$ is any strictly increasing continuous function (a homeomorphism) with $\\phi(0)=c$ and $\\phi(c)=1$.\n    c. **Extend `f` to the rest of `R`:** The choice of $c$ and $\\phi$ uniquely determines the function $f$ over all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   For $x \\in [c, 1]$, we can write $x = \\phi(t)$ for a unique $t \\in [0, c]$. Then $f(x) = f(\\phi(t)) = f(f(t)) = e^t = e^{\\phi^{-1}(x)}$.\n    *   This defines $f$ on $[0, 1]$. We can continue this process. For any $x>0$, we can define $f(x)$ using the relation $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$. Any $x > 0$ can be reached from the interval $[0, 1]$ by repeatedly applying $\\exp$ or $\\ln$.\n    *   Similarly, for $x<0$, we can use the relation $f(\\ln x) = \\ln(f(x))$ (which is derived from $f(e^x)=e^{f(x)}$ and holds for $x>0$ where $f(x)>0$). This allows us to define $f$ for all negative numbers.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the cardinality of the set of solutions\n\nThe set of all solutions $S$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all possible pairs $(c, \\phi)$, where $c \\in (0, 1)$ and $\\phi: [0, c] \\to [c, 1]$ is a strictly increasing homeomorphism.\n\n1.  **Cardinality of choices for `c`:** The interval $(0, 1)$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the real numbers).\n\n2.  **Cardinality of choices for `Ï†`:** For any fixed $c$, we need to find the number of strictly increasing homeomorphisms from $[0, c]$ to $[c, 1]$. This is the same as the number of strictly increasing homeomorphisms from $[0, 1]$ to $[0, 1]$. Let's call this set $H$.\n    *   The set of all continuous functions from $[0, 1]$ to $[0, 1]$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. So, $|H| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   We can construct an explicit family of such functions of size $\\mathfrak{c}$. For example, for each $a \\in (1/3, 2/3)$, consider the function $\\psi_a(x)$ which is the identity on $[0, 1/3]$ and $[2/3, 1]$, and connects the points $(1/3, 1/3)$, $(1/2, a)$, and $(2/3, 2/3)$ with two line segments. Each choice of $a$ gives a different valid homeomorphism. Since there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $a$, we have $|H| \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the cardinality of the set of possible functions $\\phi$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n3.  **Total Cardinality:** The total number of solutions is the cardinality of the set of pairs $(c, \\phi)$. This is given by the product of the cardinalities of the choices for $c$ and $\\phi$.\n    $|S| = |(0, 1)| \\times |H| = \\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of continuous functions satisfying the given equation is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum."
