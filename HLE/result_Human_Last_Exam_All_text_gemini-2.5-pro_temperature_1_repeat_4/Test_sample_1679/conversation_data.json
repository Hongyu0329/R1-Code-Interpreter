    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisks\"**\nFirst, it is crucial to understand what a \"Luxor Obelisk\" is. There are two of them. Originally, they both stood at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Egypt. In the 1830s, one of the obelisks was transported to France. Therefore, a film can depict a Luxor Obelisk by showing one of two locations:\n1.  The Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n2.  The Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n\n**Step 2: Create a Search Strategy**\nThe goal is to find the *first* Best Picture winner to show either of these locations. The most logical approach is to go through the list of Best Picture winners chronologically, starting from the first award ceremony, and analyze the setting of each film.\n\n**Step 3: Chronological Analysis of Best Picture Winners**\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:**\n    *   *Wings* (1927/28): Has scenes in Paris, but they are focused on nightlife and intimate settings, not major public landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   *The Broadway Melody* (1928/29): Set in New York.\n    *   *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1929/30): Set on the German front in WWI.\n    *   *Cimarron* (1930/31): Set in the American West.\n    *   *Grand Hotel* (1931/32): Set in Berlin.\n    *   *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937): This is a potential candidate as it is set in Paris. However, the film is a historical drama focused on courtrooms, interiors, and the Dreyfus Affair. It does not feature scenic shots of Parisian landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   Other winners from this era are set in the US, UK, or on the high seas, making them irrelevant to this search.\n\n*   **1940s:**\n    *   The winners of the 1940s, such as *Rebecca*, *How Green Was My Valley*, *Casablanca*, and *The Best Years of Our Lives*, are set in locations like England, Wales, Morocco, and the USA. None are set in Paris or Luxor.\n\n*   **1950s:**\n    *   *All About Eve* (1950): Set in New York's theater world.\n    *   ***An American in Paris*** **(1951):** This film is an immediate and very strong candidate. As the title suggests, it is a musical romance explicitly set in and celebrating the city of Paris. The film is famous for its extended final ballet sequence. In this sequence, Gene Kelly dances through a series of elaborate, stylized sets designed to evoke famous Parisian locations and painters. One of these prominent settings is the Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk is clearly and centrally depicted.\n\n**Step 4: Verification and Conclusion**\nHaving identified *An American in Paris* (1951) as a definite instance of a Luxor Obelisk being shown on-screen, we must confirm it is the first. The chronological review shows no confirmed depiction in any earlier Best Picture winner. Films set in Paris before 1951, like *The Life of Emile Zola*, did not use the city's landmarks in the same scenic way. Furthermore, no Best Picture winner before 1951 was set in Luxor, Egypt.\n\nTherefore, the analysis concludes that *An American in Paris* is the first film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
