    "This is a fascinating question of historical linguistics. To determine the answer, we must trace the etymology of the word \"sister\" and then project a hypothetical evolution without a key historical influence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Modern English Word and its Immediate Origin:**\n    The Modern English word is \"sister\". Etymological dictionaries confirm that this word is not a direct descendant of the original Old English word. Instead, it was borrowed from, or heavily influenced by, the Old Norse word *systir*. This influence is a direct result of the Viking invasions and the subsequent settlement of Norse speakers in England (the Danelaw) from the 8th century onwards.\n\n2.  **Identify the Original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) Word:**\n    Before the Norse influence, the word used by the Anglo-Saxons for \"sister\" was **sweostor**. This word, like the Old Norse *systir*, descends from the same Proto-Germanic root, *\\*swestēr*. The two words are cognates, which is why they are similar.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Linguistic Influence:**\n    The Old English *sweostor* and the Old Norse *systir* co-existed in England for centuries. The key differences are in the initial consonant cluster (`sw-` vs. `s-`) and the first vowel sound (`eo` vs. `y`). The Norse form (`s-` and a front vowel sound like `i`) was phonetically simpler and eventually won out, giving us our modern \"sister\". The native `sw-` was dropped and the vowel shifted to align with the Norse pronunciation.\n\n4.  **Hypothesize the Natural Evolution of *sweostor* Without Norse Influence:**\n    To figure out what *sweostor* would have become, we need to apply the known sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English to other, uninfluenced words.\n\n    *   **The initial `sw-` cluster:** This sound was generally stable in English. We see it preserved in many words that evolved naturally from Old English, such as:\n        *   OE *swimman* → ModE *swim*\n        *   OE *swān* → ModE *swan*\n        *   OE *swēte* → ModE *sweet*\n        Therefore, it is almost certain that the hypothetical word would have begun with \"sw-\".\n\n    *   **The vowel `eo`:** The Old English short diphthong `eo` typically evolved into `e` in Middle English. For example:\n        *   OE *seofon* → ME *seven* → ModE *seven*\n        *   OE *heofon* → ME *heven* → ModE *heaven*\n        Following this pattern, the first part of *sweostor* would have become *swester-* in Middle English.\n\n    *   **The final syllable:** The unstressed `-or` ending would likely have reduced to `-er`, a very common ending in Modern English.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Hypothetical Word:**\n    Combining these changes, the developmental path would look like this:\n    *   Old English: **sweostor**\n    *   Hypothetical Middle English: **swester**\n    *   Hypothetical Modern English: **swester**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Dialectal Evidence:** This hypothetical evolution is not pure speculation. The form *swester* actually survived for a long time in some regional English dialects, particularly in the south and west where Norse influence was weaker. The related Scots language has the word *suister*, showing a similar development from the original Old English root.\n*   **Cognate Evidence:** Looking at other related West Germanic languages that did not experience the same Norse influence provides strong supporting evidence. The German word for sister is **Schwester** and the Dutch word is **zuster**. The German form is particularly telling, as it almost perfectly matches the projected English evolution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the standard rules of English linguistic evolution and evidence from surviving dialects and related languages, if the Norse had never interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the Old English word *sweostor* would have naturally evolved into a different form. The \"w\" would have been retained and the vowels would have shifted according to typical English sound laws.\n\nThe final word would be **swester**.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
