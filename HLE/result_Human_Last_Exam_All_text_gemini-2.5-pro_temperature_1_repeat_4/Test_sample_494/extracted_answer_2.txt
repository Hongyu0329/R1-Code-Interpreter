Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling. The potential energy surface that gives rise to tunneling is determined by the electronic structure and nuclear masses, not nuclear spin. The change in hydrogen nuclear spin from fermion to boson alters the symmetry requirements for the overall wavefunction, which changes which rotational states are allowed. However, it does not eliminate the existence of the two tunnel-split energy levels. Both the lower and upper states of the tunneling doublet can be combined with appropriate rotational states to form total wavefunctions that are allowed under boson statistics. Therefore, the energy splitting due to tunneling would still be present and observable.
