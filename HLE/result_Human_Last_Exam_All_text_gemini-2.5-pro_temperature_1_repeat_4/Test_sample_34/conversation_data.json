    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Scenario:**\n    *   **Position: Button (BTN):** This is the most profitable position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last post-flop, which gives you a massive informational advantage. This allows you to play a very wide range of hands profitably.\n    *   **Action: Open to 2.5x:** This is a standard opening size. The size itself doesn't drastically change the range, but it's important context.\n    *   **Stack Depth: 100BB:** This is the standard cash game stack depth, meaning implied odds are a factor, but not as much as in very deep-stacked games.\n    *   **Game Type: Rake-Free:** This is a crucial detail. In most poker games, a percentage of the pot (the rake) is taken by the house. To be profitable, a hand must win enough to overcome the rake. In a rake-free environment, the bar for profitability is lower. This means you can and should open a wider range of hands than you would in a raked game. Marginal hands that might be slightly unprofitable in a raked game become profitable opens here.\n    *   **Hand in Question: \"The worst suited jack you should open\":** We are looking for a hand of the form JXs (Jack-X suited). We need to find the lowest value of 'X' where JXs is still considered a standard, profitable open-raise in this specific scenario.\n\n2.  **Principles of Opening Ranges from the Button:**\n    *   **Fold Equity:** When you raise from the button, the Small Blind and Big Blind will fold a significant percentage of the time, allowing you to win the blinds uncontested. This immediate profit is called fold equity.\n    *   **Playability & Equity Realization:** Hands that are suited or connected can make strong draws (flushes and straights). Being in position allows you to control the size of the pot and bluff effectively, meaning you \"realize\" your hand's equity better than you would out of position.\n    *   **Domination:** A key weakness of hands with a weak kicker (like a Jack with a low side card) is that if you hit your top pair (a Jack), you can be \"dominated\" by an opponent who also has a Jack but with a better kicker (e.g., your J3s loses to their KJs on a J-high board).\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Suited Jack Hands (JXs):**\n    *   Let's rank the suited Jack hands from best to worst: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n    *   **JTs, J9s, J8s:** These are very strong hands with great flush and straight potential. They are clear opens from the button in any game.\n    *   **J7s, J6s, J5s:** The straight potential diminishes as the gap between the cards widens. However, they retain their flush potential and top-pair potential. Given the power of being on the button, these are still standard opens.\n    *   **J4s, J3s, J2s:** These are the weakest suited Jacks. Their straight potential is nearly non-existent. Their value comes primarily from three sources:\n        1.  The fold equity from raising on the button.\n        2.  The ability to make a strong flush.\n        3.  The ability to make top pair (though with a very weak kicker).\n\n4.  **Determining the \"Cutoff\" Point:**\n    *   The question asks for the *worst* hand you *should* open. This implies it's the hand at the very bottom of a correct opening range.\n    *   In a typical raked game, the cutoff for suited Jacks from the button might be J5s or J4s, with the weaker ones becoming marginal folds.\n    *   However, the **rake-free** nature of this game is the deciding factor. Without the need to beat the rake, the profitability of stealing the blinds increases significantly. Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solvers show that in a rake-free, 100BB game, you should be opening an extremely wide range from the button (often over 50% of hands).\n    *   This expanded range includes *all* suited Jack combinations. The combination of fold equity, positional advantage, and flush potential makes even the weakest suited jack, J2s, a profitable open-raise.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince all suited Jacks from JTs down to J2s are considered standard, profitable opens from the button in a 100BB rake-free game, the \"worst\" one that you should open is simply the one that is objectively the weakest in that category. The weakest suited Jack is J2s, due to having the lowest possible kicker and the worst connectivity for making straights.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
