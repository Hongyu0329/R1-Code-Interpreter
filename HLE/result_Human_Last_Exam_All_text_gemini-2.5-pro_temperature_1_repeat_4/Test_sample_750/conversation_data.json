    "Answering the question requires solving the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Equation and Complex Exponentiation**\n\nThe right-hand side of the equation involves complex exponentiation, which is a multi-valued function. We define $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$. In our case, $a=i$ and $b=z$.\n\nThe complex logarithm, $\\ln(w)$, is also multi-valued: $\\ln(w) = \\ln|w| + i(\\arg(w) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor $w=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nSo, $\\ln(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\n\nLet's define $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for convenience. Then $\\ln(i) = iC_k$.\n\nSubstituting this into the exponentiation, we get:\n$i^z = e^{z \\ln i} = e^{z(iC_k)} = e^{izC_k}$.\n\nThe original equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{izC_k}$\n\nA complex number $z$ is a solution if it satisfies this equation for at least one integer value of $k$.\n\n**2. Express Both Sides in Polar Form**\n\nTo solve for $z$, we can equate the magnitudes and arguments of both sides of the equation.\nLet $z = x + iy = r e^{i\\theta}$, where $r = |z|$ and $\\theta = \\arg(z)$.\n\n*   **Left-Hand Side (LHS):** $z \\cdot i$\n    *   In polar form: $(re^{i\\theta}) \\cdot e^{i\\pi/2} = r e^{i(\\theta + \\pi/2)}$.\n    *   Magnitude: $|z \\cdot i| = |z| \\cdot |i| = r \\cdot 1 = r$.\n    *   Argument: $\\arg(z \\cdot i) = \\arg(z) + \\arg(i) = \\theta + \\pi/2$.\n\n*   **Right-Hand Side (RHS):** $e^{izC_k}$\n    *   Substitute $z=x+iy$: $e^{i(x+iy)C_k} = e^{(ix-y)C_k} = e^{-yC_k} \\cdot e^{ixC_k}$.\n    *   Magnitude: $|e^{-yC_k} \\cdot e^{ixC_k}| = |e^{-yC_k}| \\cdot |e^{ixC_k}| = e^{-yC_k} \\cdot 1 = e^{-yC_k}$.\n    *   Argument: $\\arg(e^{ixC_k}) = xC_k$.\n\n**3. Form a System of Equations**\n\nBy equating the magnitudes and arguments, we get a system of two real equations.\n*   **Equating Magnitudes:**\n    $r = e^{-yC_k}$  (Equation 1)\n*   **Equating Arguments:**\n    The arguments must be equal up to an integer multiple of $2\\pi$.\n    $\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = xC_k + 2n\\pi$ for some integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. (Equation 2)\n\n**4. Solve the System by Analyzing Cases**\n\nWe now search for solutions $z=x+iy$ by considering different cases. Note that $z=0$ is not a solution since $0 \\cdot i = 0$ but $i^0=1$. So, we can assume $r=|z| \\neq 0$.\n\n**Case A: Real Solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $z$ is real, $z=x$ and $y=0$.\n\n*   **If $x > 0$:** $r=x$ and $\\theta=0$.\n    *   From Eq. 1: $x = e^{-0 \\cdot C_k} = e^0 = 1$. So, $x=1$.\n    *   From Eq. 2: $0 + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = (1)C_k + 2n\\pi \\implies \\frac{\\pi}{2} = (\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) + 2n\\pi \\implies 0 = 2k\\pi + 2n\\pi \\implies k+n=0$.\n    *   For any integer $k$, we can choose $n=-k$. This is always possible.\n    *   Thus, **$z=1$** is a solution.\n\n*   **If $x < 0$:** $r=-x$ and $\\theta=\\pi$.\n    *   From Eq. 1: $-x = e^{-0 \\cdot C_k} = e^0 = 1$. So, $x=-1$.\n    *   From Eq. 2: $\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = (-1)C_k + 2n\\pi \\implies \\frac{3\\pi}{2} = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) + 2n\\pi$.\n    *   $\\frac{3\\pi}{2} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2k\\pi + 2n\\pi \\implies 2\\pi = (2n-2k)\\pi \\implies 1 = n-k$.\n    *   For any integer $k$, we can choose $n=k+1$. This is always possible.\n    *   Thus, **$z=-1$** is a solution.\n\n**Case B: Purely Imaginary Solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $z$ is purely imaginary, $z=iy$ and $x=0$.\n\n*   **If $y > 0$:** $r=y$ and $\\theta=\\pi/2$.\n    *   From Eq. 1: $y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n    *   From Eq. 2: $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = (0)C_k + 2n\\pi \\implies \\pi = 2n\\pi \\implies n=1/2$.\n    *   Since $n$ must be an integer, this is impossible. There are no solutions on the positive imaginary axis.\n\n*   **If $y < 0$:** $r=-y$ and $\\theta=-\\pi/2$.\n    *   From Eq. 1: $-y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n    *   From Eq. 2: $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = (0)C_k + 2n\\pi \\implies 0 = 2n\\pi \\implies n=0$.\n    *   The condition on $n$ is met. We now need to solve the equation from (1): $-y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n    *   Let $t = -y$. Since $y<0$, we have $t>0$. The equation becomes $t = e^{tC_k}$.\n    *   Let's analyze the existence of solutions for $t>0$.\n        *   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi > 0$. The function $g(t) = e^{tC_k} - t$ is always positive for $t>0$ (its minimum value is greater than 0), so there are no solutions.\n        *   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k < 0$. Let $C_k = -A$ where $A>0$. The equation is $t = e^{-tA}$. The function $h(t) = t - e^{-tA}$ is strictly increasing for $t>0$ (since $h'(t) = 1+Ae^{-tA} > 0$). As $t \\to 0^+$, $h(t) \\to -1$. As $t \\to \\infty$, $h(t) \\to \\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists exactly one positive solution $t_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$.\n    *   Therefore, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution $z_k = iy_k$ where $y_k = -t_k$. This gives an infinite set of solutions on the negative imaginary axis.\n\n**Summary of Solutions**\n\nThe complete set of solutions for the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ consists of:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite family of purely imaginary solutions: $z_k = iy_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative solution to the equation $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n\nThe solutions can be written as:\n*   $z=1$\n*   $z=-1$\n*   $z = iy_k$, where $k$ is any integer such that $k \\le -1$, and $y_k$ is the solution to $-y = \\exp(-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$. These solutions can also be expressed using the Lambert W function as $y_k = \\frac{W(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$.\n\n<<<\nThe solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique real solution to the equation $-y_k = e^{-y_k(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n>>>"
