    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Board**\nThe goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares of a standard 8x8 chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. We then need to find how many edge squares are left empty.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\nThe edge squares are all the squares in the first and last rows (rank 1 and rank 8) and the first and last columns (file 'a' and file 'h').\n*   Rank 1 has 8 squares.\n*   Rank 8 has 8 squares.\n*   File 'a' has 8 squares, but two of them (a1 and a8) are already counted in the ranks. So, there are 6 new squares.\n*   File 'h' also has 8 squares, with two corners (h1 and h8) already counted. So, there are 6 new squares.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Bishop's Movement and Constraints**\nA bishop moves diagonally and always stays on squares of the same color. This means a bishop placed on a light square can never attack a bishop on a dark square. This is a crucial point because it allows us to solve the problem for light squares and dark squares independently and then combine the results.\n\n**Step 4: Divide the Problem by Color**\nLet's find out how many of the 28 edge squares are light and how many are dark.\n*   The edge squares are perfectly symmetrical. Half are light, and half are dark.\n*   Number of dark edge squares = 28 / 2 = 14.\n*   Number of light edge squares = 28 / 2 = 14.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Dark Edge Squares**\nWe need to place as many non-attacking bishops as possible on the 14 dark edge squares.\n*   **A careful point:** A bishop on an edge square often attacks another edge square. For example, a bishop on a1 (dark) attacks h8 (dark). A bishop on c1 (dark) attacks h6 (dark).\n*   Let's consider the dark squares on the side files ('a' and 'h') first: a3, a5, a7 and h2, h4, h6. There are 6 such squares. No two of these squares are on the same diagonal, so we can place a bishop on all 6 of them.\n*   Now, let's see which other dark edge squares are attacked by these 6 bishops:\n    *   Bishops on a3 and h6 attack c1.\n    *   Bishops on a5 and h4 attack e1.\n    *   Bishops on a7 and h2 attack g1.\n    *   Bishops on a7 and h2 attack b8.\n    *   Bishops on a5 and h4 attack d8.\n    *   Bishops on a3 and h6 attack f8.\n*   This means all the remaining dark edge squares on ranks 1 and 8 are attacked, *except* for the corner squares a1 and h8.\n*   So, from the remaining dark edge squares, we can only consider a1 and h8. However, a1 and h8 are on the same diagonal, so they attack each other. We can only place one bishop between them.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops on dark squares is 6 (from the side files) + 1 (from the corners) = 7.\n\n**Step 6: Maximize Bishops on Light Edge Squares**\nThe problem for the 14 light squares is perfectly symmetrical to the dark squares.\n*   We can place bishops on the 6 light squares on the side files ('a' and 'h'): a2, a4, a6 and h3, h5, h7. These 6 do not attack each other.\n*   These 6 bishops attack all other light edge squares on ranks 1 and 8, *except* for the corners a8 and h1.\n*   The corners a8 and h1 attack each other, so we can only place one bishop on either a8 or h1.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops on light squares is also 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Total Number of Placed Bishops**\nSince the bishops on dark squares and light squares don't interact, we can add the maximums for each color together.\n*   Total maximum bishops = 7 (on dark squares) + 7 (on light squares) = 14.\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the Number of Empty Edge Squares**\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would lack bishops.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Maximum number of bishops placed = 14.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Placed bishops\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
