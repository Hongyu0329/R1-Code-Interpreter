    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the \"Second Great War\"\nThe conflict referred to as the \"Second Great War\" in StarCraft lore encompasses the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy: *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void* (including its epilogue, *Into the Void*). This distinguishes it from the first \"Great War,\" which covers the original *StarCraft* and its *Brood War* expansion.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Start Date of the War\nThe war begins with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*. According to the official StarCraft timeline, this campaign starts in the year **2504**, four years after the conclusion of the Brood War. The inciting incident is the renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector and Jim Raynor's revived rebellion against the Terran Dominion.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the End Date of the War\nThe war concludes with the final defeat of the primary antagonist, the fallen Xel'naga Amon. This occurs at the end of the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*. The main campaign of *Legacy of the Void* (the Reclamation of Aiur) and the epilogue campaign are both set in the year **2506**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Duration\nThe war starts at some point in the year 2504 and ends at some point in the year 2506. To calculate the duration, we consider the time elapsed between these two points.\n\n*   The conflict was active during the year **2504** (*Wings of Liberty*).\n*   The conflict was active during the year **2505** (*Heart of the Swarm*).\n*   The conflict was active during the year **2506** (*Legacy of the Void* and *Epilogue*).\n\nSince the war spans across three separate calendar years, its total duration must be greater than two full years. For example, if the war started in March of 2504 and ended in September of 2506, the total time elapsed would be 2 years and 6 months (or 2.5 years). While the exact months are not specified in the lore, the sequence of events across these three years makes the duration definitively longer than two years but shorter than three full years.\n\n### Step 5: Round the Duration Up\nThe question specifically asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**.\n\n*   The calculated duration is a value greater than 2.0 years (e.g., 2.5 years).\n*   When you round any number greater than 2.0 up to the nearest whole number, the result is 3. For instance, `ceil(2.1)` is 3, `ceil(2.5)` is 3, and `ceil(2.9)` is 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Definition of the War:** It's crucial to correctly identify the war as the entire *StarCraft II* saga.\n*   **Timeline Accuracy:** The years 2504, 2505, and 2506 for the three main parts of the story are well-established in the official lore.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Duration\":** The duration is the total elapsed time from the start event to the end event, not just the subtraction of the end year and start year (2506 - 2504 = 2). The fact that the conflict takes place *across* three calendar years is the key detail.\n*   **Rounding Rule:** The \"rounded up\" instruction is critical. Any duration that is not an exact whole number must be rounded to the next highest integer. Since the war's duration is certainly more than exactly two years, it must be rounded up to three.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe Second Great War started in 2504 and ended in 2506. This gives it a duration of over two years. Rounding this value up results in 3 years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
