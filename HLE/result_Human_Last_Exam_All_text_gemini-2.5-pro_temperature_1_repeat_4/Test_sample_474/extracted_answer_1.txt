No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry syndromes is determined by the perception of natural predators (e.g., birds), not humans. There are two primary flaws in this methodology:
1.  **The Observer:** Human visual systems are different from those of major bee predators like birds. Birds are often tetrachromatic and can see ultraviolet (UV) light, a spectrum invisible to humans. Crucial components of the bees' warning coloration may exist in the UV spectrum, meaning species that look similar to humans could look very different to a predator.
2.  **The Stimuli:** Standard field images do not capture UV reflectance and present a static, 2D representation of the bee. This removes dynamic cues like flight patterns and behavior, which can also be part of the warning signal.
Because the method uses an inappropriate proxy for the predator and incomplete visual information, the resulting clusters would reflect human aesthetic similarity, not the ecologically functional mimicry rings shaped by predator selection.
