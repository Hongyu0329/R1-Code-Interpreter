    "This problem asks for the classification of all nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's carefully define the key terms in the question.\n*   **Product-Free Set**: A subset $S$ of a group $G$ is product-free if for all $x, y \\in S$, their product $xy$ is not in $S$. This can be written as $S^2 \\cap S = \\emptyset$. A direct consequence is that the identity element $1$ cannot be in any product-free set, since $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set**: A product-free set $S$ is maximal (by inclusion) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means for any element $g \\in G \\setminus S$, the set $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is not product-free.\n*   **A Set that Fills G**: A subset $S$ of a group $G$ fills $G$ if $G = S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{1\\}$, where $S^{-1} = \\{s^{-1} \\mid s \\in S\\}$. This means every non-identity element of $G$ is either in $S$ or its inverse is in $S$.\n*   **Filled Group**: A finite group $G$ is called \"filled\" if *every* maximal product-free set in $G$ fills $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Applying a Key Characterization Theorem\n\nThe definition of a filled group is quite abstract. Fortunately, there is a powerful theorem that provides a much simpler, equivalent characterization.\n\n**Theorem (V. F. Lev)**: A finite group $G$ is filled if and only if it satisfies one of the following two conditions:\n1.  $G$ is an elementary abelian 2-group.\n2.  $G$ has a unique element of order 2 (a unique involution).\n\nWe are looking for groups that are **nonabelian** and have order $|G| = 2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and $m \\ge 1$. We can analyze the two conditions from the theorem for such groups.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Conditions for Groups of Order $2q^m$\n\n**Condition 1: G is an elementary abelian 2-group.**\n*   An elementary abelian 2-group is a group isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^k$ for some integer $k$.\n*   The order of such a group is $2^k$.\n*   Our group $G$ has order $2q^m$. For this to equal $2^k$, we would need $q^m$ to be a power of 2. Since $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\ge 1$, this is impossible.\n*   Furthermore, elementary abelian groups are abelian, and the question specifically asks for **nonabelian** groups.\n*   Therefore, this case does not yield any solutions.\n\n**Condition 2: G has a unique element of order 2.**\nWe must now find all nonabelian groups of order $2q^m$ (with $q$ odd, $m \\ge 1$) that possess exactly one element of order 2.\n\n*   **Group Structure Analysis**: Let $G$ be such a group. By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow $q$-subgroups, $n_q$, must divide the order of the group ($2q^m$) and satisfy $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}$.\n    *   $n_q$ divides $2q^m$, so $n_q$ can be $1, 2, q, 2q, \\dots$.\n    *   $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}$ means $n_q$ must be 1 or a number of the form $kq+1$.\n    *   If $n_q = 2$, then $2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}$, which implies $q$ divides 1. This is impossible.\n    *   If $n_q$ is a multiple of $q$, it cannot be congruent to $1 \\pmod{q}$.\n    *   Therefore, $n_q$ must be 1. This means the Sylow $q$-subgroup, let's call it $P$, is unique and thus a normal subgroup of $G$. $|P|=q^m$.\n*   Let $K$ be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Its order is $|K|=2$. So $K \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n*   Since $P$ is a normal subgroup and $P \\cap K = \\{1\\}$, $G$ is a semidirect product of $P$ and $K$.\n    $G \\cong P \\rtimes_{\\alpha} K \\cong P \\rtimes_{\\alpha} C_2$.\n    The structure of $G$ is determined by the homomorphism $\\alpha: C_2 \\to \\text{Aut}(P)$. Let $x$ be the generator of $C_2$. The homomorphism $\\alpha$ is defined by the image of $x$, which must be an automorphism of $P$, let's call it $\\phi = \\alpha(x)$. Since $x^2=1$, we must have $\\phi^2 = \\text{id}$, the identity automorphism on $P$.\n\nWe have two possibilities for the automorphism $\\phi$:\n**Case A: $\\phi$ is the trivial automorphism ($\\phi = \\text{id}$).**\n*   In this case, the semidirect product is a direct product: $G \\cong P \\times C_2$.\n*   The group $G$ is nonabelian if and only if $P$ is nonabelian. A group of order $q^m$ (a $q$-group) is always abelian if $m=1$ or $m=2$. Nonabelian groups of order $q^m$ exist for all $m \\ge 3$.\n*   We need to check the number of elements of order 2 in $G = P \\times C_2$. An element $(p, k) \\in P \\times C_2$ has order $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(p), \\text{ord}(k))$. For this to be 2, we need $\\text{ord}(p)$ and $\\text{ord}(k)$ to divide 2, and not both be 1.\n    *   Since $P$ is a $q$-group with $q$ odd, the only element whose order divides 2 is the identity element, $1_P$. So, $\\text{ord}(p)=1$, which means $p=1_P$.\n    *   For the element in $C_2$, $\\text{ord}(k)$ must be 2. There is exactly one such element in $C_2$.\n    *   Thus, the only element of order 2 in $G$ is $(1_P, x)$, where $x$ is the generator of $C_2$.\n*   Conclusion for Case A: Groups of the form $P \\times C_2$, where $P$ is a nonabelian group of order $q^m$ (requiring $m \\ge 3$) are solutions.\n\n**Case B: $\\phi$ is a nontrivial automorphism of order 2 ($\\phi \\ne \\text{id}$, $\\phi^2=\\text{id}$).**\n*   The group $G \\cong P \\rtimes_{\\phi} C_2$ is a non-trivial semidirect product, which is always nonabelian.\n*   Let's find the elements of order 2 in $G$. Elements are of the form $(p,k)$ for $p \\in P, k \\in C_2=\\{1,x\\}$.\n    *   An element of the form $(p,1)$ has square $(p,1)^2 = (p\\phi(1)(p), 1^2) = (p^2, 1)$. For this to be the identity $(1,1)$, we need $p^2=1$. As $P$ is an odd order group, this implies $p=1$. This gives the identity element, not an element of order 2.\n    *   An element of the form $(p,x)$ has square $(p,x)^2 = (p\\phi(x)(p), x^2) = (p\\phi(p), 1)$. For this to have order 2, we need the square to be the identity, so $p\\phi(p)=1$, which is equivalent to $\\phi(p) = p^{-1}$.\n*   The number of elements of order 2 in $G$ is the number of solutions $p \\in P$ to the equation $\\phi(p) = p^{-1}$. We need this number to be exactly 1 for $G$ to have a unique involution. The identity element $p=1$ is always a solution, since $\\phi(1)=1=1^{-1}$. This corresponds to the element $(1,x)$, which always has order 2.\n*   So, the question reduces to: does the equation $\\phi(p)=p^{-1}$ have any non-trivial solutions in $P$?\n*   Consider the map $f: P \\to P$ defined by $f(p) = p^{-1}\\phi(p)$.\n*   Let $c$ be any element in the image of this map, i.e., $c=p^{-1}\\phi(p)$ for some $p \\in P$. Let's test if $c$ is a solution:\n    $\\phi(c) = \\phi(p^{-1}\\phi(p)) = \\phi(p^{-1})\\phi^2(p) = \\phi(p)^{-1}p = (p^{-1}\\phi(p))^{-1} = c^{-1}$.\n    So, any element in the image of $f$ is a solution.\n*   The set of solutions contains the image of $f$. For the number of solutions to be 1, the image of $f$ must be the trivial set $\\{1\\}$.\n*   The image of $f$ is $\\{1\\}$ if and only if $f(p)=1$ for all $p \\in P$.\n    $p^{-1}\\phi(p) = 1 \\iff \\phi(p)=p$.\n    This means $\\phi$ must be the identity automorphism.\n*   However, we are in Case B, where we assumed $\\phi$ is a *nontrivial* automorphism. Therefore, there must exist some $p \\in P$ for which $\\phi(p) \\ne p$, meaning $f(p) = p^{-1}\\phi(p) \\ne 1$. This non-identity element $f(p)$ is a solution to $\\phi(c)=c^{-1}$.\n*   This shows that if $\\phi$ is any nontrivial automorphism of order 2, there is always at least one non-trivial solution to $\\phi(p)=p^{-1}$. Thus, the number of elements of order 2 is greater than 1.\n*   Conclusion for Case B: Non-trivial semidirect products of this form have more than one element of order 2 and are therefore not filled.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the analysis of all cases, the only nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ (for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$) are the groups that arise from Case A. These are groups $G$ that are isomorphic to a direct product $P \\times C_2$, where:\n1.  $C_2$ is the cyclic group of order 2.\n2.  $P$ is a nonabelian group of order $q^m$.\n3.  The existence of a nonabelian group of order $q^m$ requires $m \\ge 3$.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the groups isomorphic to a direct product $P \\times C_2$, where $C_2$ is the cyclic group of order 2 and $P$ is any nonabelian group of order $q^m$. Such groups P exist if and only if $m \\geq 3$."
