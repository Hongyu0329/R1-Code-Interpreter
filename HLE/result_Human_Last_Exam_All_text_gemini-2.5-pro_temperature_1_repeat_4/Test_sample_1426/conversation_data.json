    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes for the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Work and Section:** The question specifies Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\" and the part for the \"first violin\" (Violino I). We need to look at the very end of the symphony, which is the conclusion of the fourth and final movement (Finale: Allegro con fuoco).\n\n2.  **Locate the Score:** To find the notes, we must consult the musical score. A reliable source like the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP) provides access to public domain scores. We need to find the full orchestral score for this symphony.\n\n3.  **Examine the Final Measure:** Upon examining the score at the end of the 4th movement, we focus on the staff labeled \"Violino I\". The entire orchestra concludes with a final, sustained chord.\n\n4.  **Interpret \"Three Notes\":** The question states the part \"ends on three notes\". In this context, it refers to the notes that make up the final chord played by the first violins. Rather than playing three notes in sequence, the first violin section plays a three-note chord (a triple stop) as its final sound.\n\n5.  **Identify the Notes of the Chord:** In the final measure, the score for the first violins shows a whole note chord containing three noteheads on the treble clef staff. These notes are:\n    *   B-flat on the middle line (B♭4)\n    *   F in the first space (F4)\n    *   D on the line just below the staff (D4)\n\n6.  **Determine the Lowest Note:** The three notes played simultaneously by the first violins are D4, F4, and B♭4. The question asks for the lowest one. By comparing their positions on the musical staff and their respective pitches, D4 is the lowest of the three.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Symphony Numbering:** It's important to be sure we are looking at the correct symphony. Dvořák's Symphony No. 2 has always been associated with the opus number 4, so there is no ambiguity here.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Ends on\":** The phrase \"ends on three notes\" could be interpreted as three sequential notes or a three-note chord. Given the common practice of ending a grand symphony with a powerful final chord, the chord interpretation is the correct and logical one. The final sound from the first violins is this chord.\n*   **Note Identification:** Correctly reading the notes in the treble clef is crucial. The notes D4, F4, and B♭4 form a B-flat major chord (the tonic chord of the symphony's home key) in its first inversion. The lowest note of this specific voicing is D.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nFollowing the analysis, the three notes in the final chord for the first violins are D, F, and B-flat. The lowest of these is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
