The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial. Due to the Sun's rotation, the interplanetary magnetic field forms a Parker Spiral, which is typically oriented at about 45 degrees to the radial direction at 1 AU.

The justification for using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., Y and Z components in a system where X is radial) to calculate magnetic helicity is a common and practical approximation based on Taylor's "frozen-in flow" Hypothesis. This hypothesis states that for a fast-flowing plasma like the solar wind, a stationary spacecraft primarily observes spatial structures being carried past it. The solar wind flow is overwhelmingly radial, so the radial direction becomes the effective direction of observation.

Therefore, the calculation method makes the simplifying assumption that the wave propagation direction (which for AIC waves is parallel to the local magnetic field, $\vec{B}_0$) is approximately aligned with the solar wind flow direction (the radial direction). This approximation is only rigorously valid when the local magnetic field happens to be radial. In the general case, it is an approximation that works best for "quasi-parallel" conditions, where the angle between the local magnetic field and the radial solar wind flow is small. For precise case studies, researchers typically abandon this approximation and transform the data into a local field-aligned coordinate system before calculating helicity.
