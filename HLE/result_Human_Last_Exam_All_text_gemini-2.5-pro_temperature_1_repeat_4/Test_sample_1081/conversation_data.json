    "Answering this question requires applying a classical result from the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields, due to Robert Steinberg. We need to find the total number of maximal tori in a group $G$ of type $E_8$ that are defined over the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the object of study:** We are given a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. We are looking for the number of its maximal tori that are $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational. A standard assumption for a simple group type over a finite field is that we are dealing with the split form, as other forms (twisted groups) are usually specified explicitly. $E_8$ is a simple algebraic group, which is a specific type of reductive group.\n\n2.  **Recall the main theorem:** There are a few ways to arrive at the answer, but the most direct one is to use a formula derived by R. Steinberg. In his influential paper \"Regular elements of semisimple algebraic groups\" (Publ. Math. IHES, 1965), a corollary gives the precise number.\n\n3.  **State Steinberg's Formula:** For a split semisimple algebraic group $G$ over a finite field $k = \\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of maximal tori of $G$ that are rational over $k$ is given by the formula:\n    $$ \\text{Number of } k\\text{-rational maximal tori} = |k|^{N-r} = q^{N-r} $$\n    where:\n    *   $q$ is the size of the finite field.\n    *   $N$ is the number of positive roots in the root system of $G$.\n    *   $r$ is the rank of the group $G$ (which is the dimension of any maximal torus).\n\n4.  **Determine the parameters for $E_8$:**\n    *   **Rank ($r$):** The group is of type $E_8$, so its rank is $r=8$.\n    *   **Number of positive roots ($N$):** The root system of type $E_8$ has a total of 240 roots. The number of positive roots is half of this total. So, $N = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the result:** We substitute the values for $N$ and $r$ into Steinberg's formula:\n    $$ \\text{Number of tori} = q^{N-r} = q^{120-8} = q^{112} $$\n\n### Careful Points and Verification:\n\n*   **Tori vs. Conjugacy Classes of Tori:** It is crucial to distinguish between the total number of rational tori and the number of *conjugacy classes* of such tori under the action of the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. The number of conjugacy classes is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112. The question asks for the total number of tori, not the number of classes.\n\n*   **Alternative Formula:** There is another theorem, also by Steinberg (from his 1968 Memoir \"Endomorphisms of linear algebraic groups\"), which states that the number of rational maximal tori is $q^m$, where $m$ is the number of roots in the root system $\\Phi$ whose \"support\" is the entire set of simple roots $\\Delta$. For a root $\\alpha = \\sum c_i \\alpha_i$ (where $\\alpha_i$ are the simple roots), its support is the set of simple roots $\\alpha_i$ for which the coefficient $c_i$ is non-zero.\n    For the $E_8$ root system, it is a known (but non-trivial) combinatorial fact that there are 56 positive roots with full support. Since if a root $\\alpha$ has full support, its negative $-\\alpha$ also has full support, the total number of roots with full support is $m = 2 \\times 56 = 112$.\n    This alternative formula gives the result $q^{112}$, which confirms our previous calculation.\n\n*   **Consistency of Formulas:** The fact that for $E_8$, the number of full-support roots ($m=112$) is equal to the number of positive roots minus the rank ($N-r = 120-8=112$) is a special property. This identity ($m=N-r$) holds for most, but not all, simple Lie types (it famously fails for $E_6$). The consistency for $E_8$ gives us high confidence in the result.\n\n*   **Applicability:** The group $G$ of type $E_8$ is simple, and therefore semisimple. The formula applies directly.\n\nThe final answer is obtained by a direct application of a classical theorem, with its parameters determined from the known properties of the $E_8$ root system.\n\n<<<q^112>>>"
