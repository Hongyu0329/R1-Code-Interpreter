The product is a tricyclic ketone. The reaction proceeds via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. First, potassium hydride (KH) deprotonates the tertiary alcohol at C2 to form a potassium alkoxide. This triggers a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement across the `C5=C6-C1-C2-C1'=C2'` system. This involves breaking the C1-C2 sigma bond of the norbornene core and forming a new sigma bond between C5 of the norbornene and C2' of the cyclopentenyl ring. The pi bonds also shift, resulting in an intermediate enolate with a double bond between C1' and C2, and another double bond between C1 and C6. The final aqueous workup protonates the enolate, which tautomerizes to the stable ketone. The final product is a complex tricyclic ketone with the C=O group at C2, a C=C double bond at C1-C6, and the silyl ether and ketal groups intact.
