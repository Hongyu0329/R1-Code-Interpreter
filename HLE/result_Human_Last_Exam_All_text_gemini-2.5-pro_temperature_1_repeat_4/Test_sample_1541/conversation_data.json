    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the method to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary task is to reorder the numbers in a given sum (composed of only 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s) into non-decreasing order. For example, `1+3+2+1` should become `1+1+2+3`.\n2.  **Identify Constraints:** The input is a string of at most 1000 characters. It contains only digits '1', '2', '3', '4' and the '+' symbol.\n3.  **Core Requirement:** The solution must be the *most memory-efficient* C program. We need to calculate the total memory in bytes (`m`) used by the variables in this optimal program.\n\n### List of Careful Points for Memory Efficiency\n\n1.  **Input Storage:** Reading the entire 1000-character string into a `char` array (e.g., `char s[1001];`) is a straightforward but memory-intensive approach. It would immediately consume over 1000 bytes. To be maximally memory-efficient, we should avoid storing the entire input string. We can process the input character by character as it's being read from the standard input stream.\n2.  **Data Storage:** Instead of storing the extracted numbers in an array to sort them, we can use the \"Counting Sort\" technique. Since we only have four distinct numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), we only need four counters to store how many times each number appears. This is vastly more memory-efficient than storing up to 501 individual numbers.\n3.  **Data Types:** To minimize memory, we must choose the smallest possible C data type for each variable that can hold its required range of values.\n    *   **Counters:** The input string has a maximum length of 1000. A valid sum string alternates between a number and a plus sign (e.g., `d+d+d...`). The maximum number of terms occurs in a string like `1+1+...+1`. A string of length 999 would have `(999+1)/2 = 500` numbers. Therefore, each counter must be able to hold a value up to 500.\n        *   `char` (0 to 255): Too small.\n        *   `short` (0 to 65,535): Sufficient. `sizeof(short)` is 2 bytes.\n    *   **Loop Variables:** The loops for printing the result will also iterate up to 500 times, so their counters should also be of type `short`.\n    *   **Flags:** Any boolean flags (e.g., to manage printing the '+' sign) can be stored in a `char`, which is the smallest addressable data type (1 byte).\n4.  **Output Buffer:** An output string should not be constructed in memory. The final sorted sum should be printed directly to the standard output, piece by piece.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step\n\nFollowing the principles above, here is the breakdown of the most memory-efficient program's variables and their sizes.\n\n**Step 1: Design the optimal algorithm.**\n1.  Initialize four counters to zero.\n2.  Read the input one character at a time. If it's a digit, increment the corresponding counter. Ignore '+' characters.\n3.  After reading all input, use the counters to print the sorted sum. Print all the '1's, then all the '2's, etc., placing a '+' between each number.\n\n**Step 2: Define the necessary variables and their optimal types.**\n\n*   **Four Counters:** To count the occurrences of '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n    *   `short count1, count2, count3, count4;`\n    *   Maximum value is 500, `short` is the best fit.\n    *   Memory: `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = **8 bytes**.\n*   **Input Character Holder:** To store a single character while reading from input.\n    *   `char ch;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(char)` = `1 * 1` = **1 byte**.\n*   **Printing Flag:** To handle the logic of when to print a '+'. It only needs to store a true/false state.\n    *   `char first_term_flag;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(char)` = `1 * 1` = **1 byte**.\n*   **Loop Counter:** For the loops that print the numbers based on the counts.\n    *   `short i;`\n    *   The loop needs to count up to 500.\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(short)` = `1 * 2` = **2 bytes**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total memory (`m`).**\n\nSum the memory usage of all variables:\n`m` = (Memory for counters) + (Memory for input char) + (Memory for flag) + (Memory for loop counter)\n`m` = 8 + 1 + 1 + 2\n`m` = 12\n\nThe total memory used for variables in the most memory-efficient C program is 12 bytes.\n\n<<<12>>>"
