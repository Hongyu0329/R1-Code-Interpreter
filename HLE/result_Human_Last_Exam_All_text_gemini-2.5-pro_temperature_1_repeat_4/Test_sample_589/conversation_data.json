    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific Hollywood film with the following key components:\n*   **Protagonist:** A teenager (or a character in their early teens).\n*   **Object:** A pink bicycle.\n*   **Action:** The character pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n*   **Production:** A feature film produced by a major Hollywood studio.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the key visual cues.**\nThe combination of a \"pink bike\" and \"pedaling toward a car\" is a very specific and dramatic scene. This is not a casual bike ride; it implies a moment of extreme emotion, defiance, or a cry for help. The color pink is a significant detail that narrows down the possibilities considerably, as it's less common than a standard red or blue bike in films.\n\n**Step 3: Brainstorm potential films and evaluate them against the criteria.**\n*   **Teen movies with bikes:** Films like *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *The Goonies*, and *It* feature kids and teenagers on bikes, but none of them contain this specific scene with a *pink* bike being ridden toward a car as an act of defiance or despair.\n*   **Movies with \"chicken\" scenes:** The film *Footloose* (1984) has a famous \"chicken\" scene, but it involves two tractors, not a bike and a car. *Rebel Without a Cause* (1955) has a \"chickie run\" with cars. These do not match the prompt.\n*   **Movies with prominent pink elements:** The film *Pretty in Pink* (1986) comes to mind, but the protagonist drives a pink car (a Volkswagen Karmann Ghia), she does not ride a pink bike in a confrontational scene.\n\n**Step 4: Focus on the specific combination of elements.**\nThe scene described is highly memorable and serves as a pivotal character moment. It occurs in the 1995 film **Now and Then**.\n\n*   **Studio:** The film was produced by New Line Cinema, a major and influential studio (often called a \"mini-major\") that has since been fully integrated into Warner Bros. This satisfies the \"major film studio\" requirement.\n*   **Character:** The character is Samantha Albertson (played by Gaby Hoffmann as a child). She is 12 years old, which fits the pre-teen/teenager description.\n*   **Bike:** Samantha owns and rides a distinctive pink bicycle.\n*   **Action:** In a key scene, distraught and overwhelmed by her parents' impending divorce, Samantha gets on her pink bike and deliberately pedals down the middle of a suburban street as a car drives directly toward her. Her friends scream at her to stop as she continues, only swerving away at the very last second. This action perfectly matches the question's description.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nBy carefully analyzing all the specific details provided in the question—a teenager, a pink bike, and the act of riding toward an oncoming car—the film that perfectly matches this description is *Now and Then* (1995).\n\n<<<Now and Then>>>"
