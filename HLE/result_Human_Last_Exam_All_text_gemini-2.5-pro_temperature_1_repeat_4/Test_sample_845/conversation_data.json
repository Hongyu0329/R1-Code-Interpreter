    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Context:** Measuring Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   **Method:** Using Photoplethysmography (PPG) to capture \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **Core Query:** \"HRV is computed as a value between heartbeats. What is that value called?\" The question asks for the specific name of the time interval measured between two consecutive heartbeats, which is the fundamental data point used to calculate HRV.\n\n2.  **List of Careful Points:**\n    *   **HR vs. HRV:** It's important to distinguish between Heart Rate (average beats per minute) and Heart Rate Variability (the variation in time *between* those beats). The question is about the latter.\n    *   **The \"Value\" is an Interval:** The value being referred to is not a rate or a frequency, but a duration of time, typically measured in milliseconds (ms).\n    *   **Measurement Technology (PPG vs. ECG):** The question mentions PPG. The gold standard for measuring beat-to-beat intervals is the Electrocardiogram (ECG). Terminology from ECG is often used even when the data comes from PPG.\n    *   **Different Levels of Specificity:** There are a few related terms, and the best one depends on the level of technical precision.\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Identify the fundamental measurement.** The core data point is the time that elapses from one heartbeat to the very next one. This is the \"beat-to-beat interval\".\n\n    *   **Step 2: Consider the gold standard terminology.** In clinical settings and research, the ECG is the standard. On an ECG trace, the most prominent spike representing the heart's contraction is called the \"R-wave\". Therefore, the time interval measured from one R-wave to the next is called the **R-R interval**. This is the most common and classic term used in the context of HRV.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Consider more general terminology.** Since the measurement can be done with other tools like PPG (which measures pulse peaks, not R-waves), a more general term is often used: **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**. This term means the exact same thing as the R-R interval—the time between beats—but is not specific to the ECG waveform.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Consider the term for processed data.** For an accurate HRV calculation, the raw R-R intervals or IBIs are typically \"cleaned\" or \"filtered\" to remove intervals associated with abnormal beats (arrhythmias) or signal artifacts. The resulting intervals, which represent the time between two consecutive *normal* heartbeats, are called **Normal-to-Normal (NN) intervals**. Most standard HRV metrics (like RMSSD, SDNN) are calculated from a series of these NN intervals.\n\n    *   **Step 5: Select the best answer.** The question asks for the name of the \"value between heartbeats.\" While \"NN interval\" is the most technically precise term for the data used in the final computation, the most fundamental and widely recognized name for the interval itself is the **R-R interval** or **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**. Of these, the R-R interval is the most classic term tied to the history of HRV analysis.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
