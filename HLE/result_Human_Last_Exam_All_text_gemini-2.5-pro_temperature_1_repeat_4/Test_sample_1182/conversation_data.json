    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $C: y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the curve and its properties.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is 5. For a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$, the genus $g$ is given by $2g+1 = \\deg(f)$ or $2g+2 = \\deg(f)$.\nSince $\\deg(f)=5$, we have $2g+1=5$, which gives $g=2$. The curve has genus 2.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the branch points of the curve.**\nThe branch points of the cover $C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1_x$ are the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ and the point at infinity (since the degree of $f(x)$ is odd). There are $2g+2=6$ branch points in total.\nLet's find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)$.\n$f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$.\nOne root is $r_1 = 0$. Its 2-adic valuation is $v_2(r_1) = \\infty$.\nLet $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. We find the valuations of the roots of $g(x)$ using its Newton polygon with respect to the prime $p=2$.\nThe coefficients of $g(x)$ are $a_4=8, a_3=4, a_2=4, a_1=1, a_0=8$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(a_i))$:\n- $(4, v_2(8)) = (4,3)$\n- $(3, v_2(4)) = (3,2)$\n- $(2, v_2(4)) = (2,2)$\n- $(1, v_2(1)) = (1,0)$\n- $(0, v_2(8)) = (0,3)$\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0,3)$ to $(1,0)$. The length of this segment (projected onto the x-axis) is $1-0=1$. The slope is $(0-3)/(1-0)=-3$. This corresponds to one root, let's call it $r_2$, with valuation $v_2(r_2) = -(\\text{slope}) = -(-3) = 3$.\n2.  A segment from $(1,0)$ to $(4,3)$. The length of this segment is $4-1=3$. The slope is $(3-0)/(4-1)=1$. This corresponds to three roots, $r_3, r_4, r_5$, each with valuation $v_2(r_i) = -(\\text{slope}) = -1$.\n\nSo, the branch points are $B = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, \\infty\\}$, where:\n- $r_1 = 0$\n- $v_2(r_2) = 3$\n- $v_2(r_3) = v_2(r_4) = v_2(r_5) = -1$\n- The point at infinity, $\\infty$.\n\n**Step 3: Group the branch points into clusters.**\nThe stable reduction of the curve is determined by how the branch points cluster together upon reduction modulo 2. Two branch points are in the same cluster if their reductions in $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{F}_2)$ are the same.\nThe reduction of a point $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2$ depends on its valuation:\n- If $v_2(x) > 0$, $\\bar{x} = 0$.\n- If $v_2(x) = 0$, $\\bar{x} = 1$ (since the residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$).\n- If $v_2(x) < 0$, $\\bar{x} = \\infty$.\n- The point $\\infty$ reduces to $\\infty$.\n\nLet's find the reduction of each branch point:\n- $r_1=0$: $v_2(0)=\\infty > 0$, so $\\bar{r_1} = 0$.\n- $r_2$: $v_2(r_2) = 3 > 0$, so $\\bar{r_2} = 0$.\n- $r_3, r_4, r_5$: $v_2(r_i) = -1 < 0$, so $\\bar{r_3} = \\bar{r_4} = \\bar{r_5} = \\infty$.\n- $\\infty$: its reduction is $\\infty$.\n\nThis gives us two clusters of branch points:\n- Cluster $C_0 = \\{r_1, r_2\\} = \\{0, r_2\\}$, whose points reduce to $0$.\n- Cluster $C_\\infty = \\{r_3, r_4, r_5, \\infty\\}$, whose points reduce to $\\infty$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the stable reduction.**\nThe stable reduction of the curve will have a component for each cluster. Let's call them $X_0$ and $X_\\infty$. So, the number of components is $m=2$.\nThe arithmetic genus of each component $X_i$ is the genus of the hyperelliptic curve whose branch points are the elements of the corresponding cluster $S_i$. The genus $g_i$ of such a curve is given by $2g_i+1 = |S_i|$ or $2g_i+2 = |S_i|$.\n- For component $X_0$, the cluster is $S_0=C_0=\\{0, r_2\\}$. It has size $|S_0|=2$. The corresponding curve is $y^2=x(x-r_2)$, which has genus $g_0$ satisfying $2g_0+2=2$, so $g_0=0$. The arithmetic genus $p_a(X_0)=0$.\n- For component $X_\\infty$, the cluster is $S_\\infty=C_\\infty=\\{r_3,r_4,r_5,\\infty\\}$. It has size $|S_\\infty|=4$. The corresponding curve is $y^2=(x-r_3)(x-r_4)(x-r_5)$, which is an elliptic curve. Its genus $g_\\infty$ satisfies $2g_\\infty+2=4$, so $g_\\infty=1$. The arithmetic genus $p_a(X_\\infty)=1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the number of double points.**\nThe number of double points (nodes) in the stable reduction is given by the formula relating the genus of the original curve to the arithmetic genera of the components of its stable reduction:\n$g = \\sum_{i} p_a(X_i) + \\delta - m + 1$\nwhere:\n- $g$ is the genus of the original curve ($g=2$).\n- $p_a(X_i)$ is the arithmetic genus of the component $X_i$.\n- $\\delta$ is the number of double points (nodes) connecting the components.\n- $m$ is the number of components ($m=2$).\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n$2 = p_a(X_0) + p_a(X_\\infty) + \\delta - 2 + 1$\n$2 = 0 + 1 + \\delta - 1$\n$2 = \\delta$\n\nThe number of double points in the stable reduction is 2. These two nodes connect the component $X_0$ (a rational curve) and the component $X_\\infty$ (an elliptic curve)."
