    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$, where $m$ is the number of stable equilibrium points of the given autonomous differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Find the Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change $x'(t)$ is zero. We set the right-hand side of the equation to zero and solve for $x$:\n$$\n-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n$$\nTo solve this cubic equation, we can factor out a common term, which is $-x$:\n$$\n-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe quadratic expression inside the parentheses is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$\n-x(x-1)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor equal to zero:\n1.  $-x = 0 \\implies x = 0$\n2.  $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n\nThus, the equilibrium points are $x^*_1 = 0$ and $x^*_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stability of Each Equilibrium Point**\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we analyze the sign of the derivative of the function $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$ at that point. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$, and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at each equilibrium point.\n\n*   **For $x^*_1 = 0$**:\n    $$\n    f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1\n    $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For $x^*_2 = 1$**:\n    $$\n    f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0\n    $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive for this point. We need to use another method, such as a phase line analysis.\n\n**Step 4: Phase Line Analysis for $x=1$**\nWe need to check the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ on either side of $x=1$. The sign of $f(x)$ tells us whether the solution $x(t)$ is increasing ($f(x)>0$) or decreasing ($f(x)<0$).\nThe term $(x-1)^2$ is always non-negative for real $x$. Therefore, the sign of $f(x)$ is determined by the sign of the term $-x$.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1** (e.g., $x=1.1$): The term $-x$ is negative. Thus, $f(x) < 0$. This means that to the right of $x=1$, $x'(t)$ is negative, so solutions are decreasing and move towards $x=1$.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly less than 1** (e.g., $x=0.9$): The term $-x$ is also negative. Thus, $f(x) < 0$. This means that to the left of $x=1$, $x'(t)$ is negative, so solutions are decreasing and move away from $x=1$.\n\nAn equilibrium point is defined as stable (or more formally, Lyapunov stable) if solutions that start sufficiently close to it remain close to it for all future time. Since solutions starting just to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, $x=1$ is **not a stable equilibrium point**. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium, which is a type of unstable equilibrium.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the value of $m$**\nThe variable $m$ represents the number of stable equilibrium points. Based on our analysis:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium point.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point. So, $m=1$.\n\n**Careful point:** The phrasing \"m is a number of stable equilibrium\" is slightly ambiguous. It could be interpreted as $m$ being the count of stable equilibria (i.e., $m=1$) or the value of a stable equilibrium (i.e., $m=0$). Standard mathematical convention suggests that a variable like $m$ or $n$ in this context represents a count. Thus, we conclude $m=1$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\nWe need to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value $m=1$ we found:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\nThis is the final numerical value.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
