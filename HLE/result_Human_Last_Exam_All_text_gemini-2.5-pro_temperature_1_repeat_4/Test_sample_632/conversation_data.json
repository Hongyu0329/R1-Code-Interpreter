    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify a specific \"unique architectural feature\" that was present in the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome but was removed by the \"city administration\" around the year \"1950\".\n\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, the square in front of the Pantheon.\n*   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature\". This term can be interpreted broadly to include not just buildings but also significant urban infrastructure.\n*   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n*   **Agent:** The \"city administration\" was responsible for the removal.\n*   **Timeline:** The removal happened around 1950. This date is the most critical clue.\n\n### **2. Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Avoid Common Misconceptions:** The feature is not the Pantheon itself, nor is it the large fountain (Fontana del Pantheon) in the center of the square, as both are still present today.\n*   **Historical Context:** We need to look at what the square looked like in the first half of the 20th century and compare it to its state after 1950.\n*   **The 1950 Date:** This date rules out other famous demolitions in the square's history. For instance, the medieval houses and market buildings (known as the \"casamenti\") that once crowded the square were demolished much earlier, mostly in the late 19th century, to \"liberate\" the view of the Pantheon.\n*   **\"Architectural Feature\":** This could refer to something other than a traditional building. It could be paving, lighting, or, in this case, a transport system.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Path to the Answer**\n\n1.  **Eliminate Existing Features:** As noted, the Pantheon and the fountain with its obelisk are still there, so they are not the answer. The surrounding buildings are also largely the same.\n2.  **Investigate Pre-1950 Photographs:** Historical photos of the Piazza della Rotonda from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s show a feature that is no longer there today: a **tramway line**.\n3.  **Research the Tramway:** Rome had an extensive tram network (the \"rete tranviaria\") in the early 20th century. A specific line ran right through the Piazza della Rotonda, with tracks that formed a circle around the central fountain. This allowed trams to navigate the square.\n4.  **Verify the Timeline:** Following World War II, Rome's city administration began a policy of dismantling much of the central tram network to make room for increased automobile and bus traffic. This process took place throughout the late 1940s and 1950s. The removal of the tram line from the Piazza della Rotonda falls squarely within this period.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The circular tramway line fits all the criteria: it was a distinct (and for a historic square, unique) feature; it was removed by a decision of the city administration; and the removal happened around the year 1950.\n\n<<<The circular tramway line that went around the fountain."
