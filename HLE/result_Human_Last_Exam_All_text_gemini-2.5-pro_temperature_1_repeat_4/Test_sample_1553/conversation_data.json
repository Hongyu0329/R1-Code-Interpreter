    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe novel in question is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (\"Perfect Imperfection\") by Jacek Dukaj. The main protagonist of the story is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who has been resurrected in a far-future reality.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character's primary love interest and partner.**\nThroughout the novel, Adam Zamoyski's primary guide, protector, and eventual lover is a powerful post-human being (a \"stahs\"). This character is instrumental in his survival and adaptation to the incomprehensible new world. Her name is Angelika.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the concept of \"marriage\" in the context of the book.**\nThe relationship between Adam and Angelika is complex and a central element of the plot. While the post-human society in the book has evolved beyond many traditional human institutions, Adam and Angelika form a formal, binding union. This act, within the narrative's context, is the equivalent of a marriage, establishing a permanent and possessive bond between them.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the name of the character.**\nBased on their relationship, which culminates in a formal and binding union, the character that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries is Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
