The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is $Z = \int_{\psi(\beta)=-\psi(0)} \mathcal{D}[\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)] e^{-S[\psi^*, \psi]}$, where the integral is a functional integral over anti-periodic Grassmann fields. The Euclidean action S is given by $S[\psi^*, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left[ \sum_j \psi_j^*(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi_j(\tau) + H(\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right]$, with $\beta=1/(k_B T)$ and $H(\psi^*, \psi)$ being the classical analogue of the Hamiltonian.
