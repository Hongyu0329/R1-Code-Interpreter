    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"Triple Crown\"\nThe term \"Triple Crown\" in Major League Baseball can refer to two different achievements, one for batters and one for pitchers. It is crucial to analyze both to provide a complete answer.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player leads their respective league (American League or National League) in three key offensive categories in a single season:\n    1.  Batting Average (BA)\n    2.  Home Runs (HR)\n    3.  Runs Batted In (RBI)\n\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher leads their respective league in three key pitching categories in a single season:\n    1.  Wins (W)\n    2.  Strikeouts (K)\n    3.  Earned Run Average (ERA)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Batting Triple Crown Winners\nThis is the more famous of the two feats and is often what is meant by the unqualified term \"Triple Crown\". We need to count the number of *unique players* who have accomplished this.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Some players have won the award more than once (Rogers Hornsby, Ted Williams). These players should only be counted once toward the total number of winners.\n*   The list includes winners from the American Association (AA) in the 19th century, which is recognized by MLB as a major league.\n*   Two players won in the same year (1933) but in different leagues.\n\n**List of Batting Triple Crown Winners (by unique player):**\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878)\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887)\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n4.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n5.  **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n6.  **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912)\n7.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, 1925)\n8.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n9.  **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n10. **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n11. **Joe Medwick** (1937)\n12. **Ted Williams** (1942, 1947)\n13. **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n14. **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n15. **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n16. **Miguel Cabrera** (2012)\n\nCounting these unique individuals, we find there have been **16** Batting Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Pitching Triple Crown Winners\nThis achievement, while less famous, is also a significant accomplishment. We will again count the number of unique pitchers.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Many pitchers have won multiple times (Walter Johnson, Pete Alexander, and Sandy Koufax won three times each; Christy Mathewson, Lefty Grove, and Roger Clemens won twice). Each should only be counted once.\n*   Two different pitchers have won in the same year on two separate occasions (1905 and 2011), one in each league.\n*   The most recent winner was in the shortened 2020 season.\n\n**List of Pitching Triple Crown Winners (by unique player):**\n1.  **Tommy Bond** (1877)\n2.  **Old Hoss Radbourn** (1884)\n3.  **Tim Keefe** (1888)\n4.  **John Clarkson** (1889)\n5.  **Amos Rusie** (1894)\n6.  **Cy Young** (1901)\n7.  **Rube Waddell** (1905)\n8.  **Christy Mathewson** (1905, 1908)\n9.  **Walter Johnson** (1913, 1918, 1924)\n10. **Pete Alexander** (1915, 1916, 1920)\n11. **Dazzy Vance** (1924)\n12. **Lefty Grove** (1930, 1931)\n13. **Bucky Walters** (1939)\n14. **Lefty Gomez** (1940)\n15. **Hal Newhouser** (1945)\n16. **Sandy Koufax** (1963, 1965, 1966)\n17. **Dwight Gooden** (1985)\n18. **Roger Clemens** (1997, 1998)\n19. **Pedro Mart√≠nez** (1999)\n20. **Randy Johnson** (2002)\n21. **Jake Peavy** (2007)\n22. **Clayton Kershaw** (2011)\n23. **Justin Verlander** (2011)\n24. **Shane Bieber** (2020)\n\nCounting these unique individuals, we find there have been **24** Pitching Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nThe question \"How many triple crowns winners are there\" is best answered by combining the number of unique winners from both categories. Since no player has ever won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown, we can simply add the two totals together.\n\n*   Unique Batting Triple Crown Winners: **16**\n*   Unique Pitching Triple Crown Winners: **24**\n*   Total Unique Triple Crown Winners in MLB History = 16 + 24 = **40**\n\n<<<40>>>"
