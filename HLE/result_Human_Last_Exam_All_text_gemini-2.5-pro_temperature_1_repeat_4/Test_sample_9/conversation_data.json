    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the space X**\n\n*   **Lattice:** A lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis of two linearly independent vectors, $v_1, v_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The lattice is the set $L = \\{n_1 v_1 + n_2 v_2 \\mid n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n*   **Basis Matrix:** A basis can be represented by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A = (v_1 | v_2)$, where $v_1, v_2$ are the column vectors. Since the lattice is nondegenerate, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent, so $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   **Unit Area:** The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition of unit area means we consider matrices $A$ such that $|\\det(A)|=1$. Let's denote the set of such matrices as $GL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   **Equivalence of Bases:** Two different bases $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(v'_1, v'_2)$ define the same lattice if they are related by an integer linear transformation. That is, the corresponding matrices $A$ and $A'$ are related by $A' = Ag$ for some $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the group of integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$.\n*   **Space of Lattices:** Combining these, the space of all unit-area lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, let's call it $\\mathcal{L}_1$, is the quotient space $\\mathcal{L}_1 = GL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   **Moduli Space (Quotient by Rotation):** The problem specifies $X$ as a \"moduli space,\" which in this context implies that lattices are identified if they are equivalent up to rotation. The special orthogonal group $SO(2)$ acts on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ by rotation. This induces a left action on the basis matrices: $A \\mapsto RA$ for $R \\in SO(2)$. Therefore, the space $X$ is the quotient of the space of lattices by this rotation action:\n    $X = SO(2) \\backslash \\mathcal{L}_1 = SO(2) \\backslash (GL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n**Step 2: Finding a more concrete model for X**\n\nThe structure of a lattice is independent of its orientation in space. All rotational information is captured by its Gram matrix.\n*   **Gram Matrix:** For a lattice basis $A$, the Gram matrix is $P = A^T A$. This matrix defines the metric properties of the lattice, specifically the squared lengths of basis vectors ($P_{11}=v_1 \\cdot v_1, P_{22}=v_2 \\cdot v_2$) and their dot product ($P_{12}=P_{21}=v_1 \\cdot v_2$).\n*   **Properties of the Gram Matrix:** $P$ is a symmetric positive-definite matrix. Its determinant is $\\det(P) = \\det(A^T A) = (\\det A)^2$. Since $|\\det A|=1$, we have $\\det(P)=1$.\n*   **Invariance under Rotation:** If we rotate the lattice by $R \\in SO(2)$, the new basis is $RA$. The new Gram matrix is $(RA)^T(RA) = A^T R^T R A = A^T I A = A^T A = P$. Thus, the Gram matrix is invariant under rotation.\n*   **Action of Change of Basis:** A change of lattice basis from $A$ to $Ag$ (with $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$) changes the Gram matrix to $P' = (Ag)^T(Ag) = g^T A^T A g = g^T P g$.\n*   **Identification of X:** The space $X$ is therefore the space of positive-definite symmetric $2 \\times 2$ matrices $P$ with $\\det(P)=1$, modulo the equivalence relation $P \\sim g^T P g$ for $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Let $\\mathcal{P}_1$ be the space of such matrices $P$.\n*   **Hyperbolic Plane Model:** The space $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is a standard model for the hyperbolic plane $\\mathbb{H}^2$. A common identification is via the action of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ on $\\mathcal{P}_1$ by $P \\mapsto g^T P g$. This action is not quite right. A better identification is $\\mathcal{P}_1 \\cong SL(2,\\mathbb{R})/SO(2)$, which is homeomorphic to the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\text{Im}(z) > 0\\}$.\n*   **Action on $\\mathbb{H}$:** Under this identification, the action $P \\mapsto g^T P g$ for $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $\\mathcal{P}_1$ translates to an action on $\\mathbb{H}$. For $g \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the action is the standard Mobius transformation $z \\mapsto \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$. For elements with determinant -1, like $j_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, the action is $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$.\n*   **Final Model for X:** The space $X$ is the quotient of the upper half-plane by the full modular group $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. So, $X = \\mathbb{H} / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Computing the Homology Group H1(X, Z)**\n\n*   **Homology of Orbifolds:** The space $X = \\mathbb{H} / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an orbifold, as the action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $\\mathbb{H}$ has fixed points. In this context, the question is most reasonably interpreted as asking for the first orbifold homology group, which is the abelianization of the orbifold fundamental group. For a quotient orbifold $Y/G$ where $Y$ is simply connected, the orbifold fundamental group is $G$.\n*   **Fundamental Group:** Since $\\mathbb{H}$ is simply connected (it's contractible), the orbifold fundamental group of $X$ is $\\pi_1^{orb}(X) = GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   **Abelianization:** The first homology group is the abelianization of the fundamental group: $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = (\\pi_1^{orb}(X))^{ab} = GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})^{ab}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of GL(2, Z)^ab**\n\nWe need to compute the abelianization of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   **Group Structure:** $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ fits into a split short exact sequence:\n    $1 \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\det} \\{ \\pm 1 \\} \\to 1$.\n    The sequence splits, for example via the homomorphism that maps $-1$ to the matrix $J = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This means $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a semidirect product: $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   **Abelianization of a Semidirect Product:** For a semidirect product $N \\rtimes H$, its abelianization is given by $(N \\rtimes H)^{ab} \\cong (N^{ab})_H \\oplus H^{ab}$, where $(N^{ab})_H$ is the group of coinvariants of the action of $H$ on the abelianization of $N$.\n*   **Applying the Formula:**\n    *   $N = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ and $H = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   The abelianization of $N$ is a standard result: $N^{ab} = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n    *   The abelianization of $H$ is $H^{ab} = \\mathbb{Z}_2^{ab} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   The action of $H=\\mathbb{Z}_2$ on $N^{ab}=\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ is induced by conjugation by the matrix $J$. Let $t$ be the generator of $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, which corresponds to the image of the matrix $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The action is:\n        $t \\mapsto J T J^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = T^{-1}$.\n        So the action on $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ is inversion: $t \\mapsto t^{-1}$ (or $k \\mapsto -k$ in additive notation).\n    *   The group of coinvariants $(\\mathbb{Z}_{12})_{\\mathbb{Z}_2}$ is the quotient of $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ by the subgroup generated by elements of the form $g - h(g)$ for $g \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ and $h \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$. It is enough to check for the generator $t$: we quotient by the subgroup generated by $t - t^{-1} = 2t$.\n        $(\\mathbb{Z}_{12})_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} = \\mathbb{Z}_{12} / \\langle 2t \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   **Final Result:** Plugging everything back into the formula for the abelianization of the semidirect product:\n    $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})^{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_{12})_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThus, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$."
