    "This question asks us to identify which word from a given list has not been affected by the historical English sound change known as Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL):** TSL is a phonological rule in the history of English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of a word). This process typically occurs when a suffix is added to a base word, shifting the stress and placing the original vowel in the correct position for the rule to apply. For example, the tense vowel /iː/ in *ser**e**ne* becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *ser**e**nity* (/səˈrɛnəti/), where the vowel is now in the third-to-last syllable.\n\n2.  **Analyze each word:** We will check each word against the criteria for TSL:\n    *   Is the word at least three syllables long?\n    *   Is there a related base word with a tense vowel?\n    *   Has that tense vowel become lax in the antepenultimate syllable of the word in question?\n\n*   **southern**:\n    *   Related base word: `south` (vowel /aʊ/, which is tense).\n    *   The word is `southern` /ˈsʌðərn/. The vowel has changed to /ʌ/ (lax).\n    *   However, `southern` is a disyllabic word (two syllables: `south-ern`). The laxing occurs in the first syllable, which is the penultimate (second-from-last), not the antepenultimate.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It has undergone vowel laxing, but it is not *trisyllabic* laxing. Therefore, it has not undergone TSL.\n\n*   **derivative**:\n    *   Related base word: `derive` (vowel /aɪ/, which is tense).\n    *   The word is `derivative` /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/. It has four syllables (`de-riv-a-tive`). The vowel in the second syllable corresponds to the vowel in `derive`.\n    *   The second syllable (`-riv-`) is the antepenultimate syllable. The vowel has changed from tense /aɪ/ to lax /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a classic example of Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**:\n    *   Related base word: `serene` (vowel /iː/, which is tense).\n    *   The word is `serenity` /səˈrɛnəti/. It has four syllables (`se-ren-i-ty`). The vowel in the second syllable corresponds to the vowel in `serene`.\n    *   The second syllable (`-ren-`) is the antepenultimate syllable. The vowel has changed from tense /iː/ to lax /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a classic example of Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**:\n    *   Related base word: `please` (vowel /iː/, which is tense).\n    *   The word is `pleasant` /ˈplɛzənt/. The vowel has changed to /ɛ/ (lax).\n    *   However, `pleasant` is a disyllabic word (`pleas-ant`). The laxing occurs in the penultimate syllable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Like `southern`, it shows vowel laxing, but not *trisyllabic* laxing. Therefore, it has not undergone TSL.\n\n*   **gratitude**:\n    *   Related base word: Consider `grateful` (vowel /eɪ/, which is tense). The root is `grate-`.\n    *   The word is `gratitude` /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/. It has three syllables (`grat-i-tude`).\n    *   The first syllable (`grat-`) is the antepenultimate syllable. The vowel has changed from tense /eɪ/ (in the root) to lax /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is an example of Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**:\n    *   Related base word: `shade` (vowel /eɪ/, which is tense).\n    *   The word is `shadow` /ˈʃædoʊ/. The vowel is /æ/ (lax).\n    *   However, `shadow` is a disyllabic word (`shad-ow`). The laxing occurs in the penultimate syllable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Like `southern` and `pleasant`, it has not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\n### Careful Point: Distinguishing the \"Best\" Answer\n\nWe have found three words that did not undergo TSL because they are not trisyllabic: `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`. A well-formed question usually has only one correct answer. Let's look for a deeper distinction. The question is about a \"sound development\".\n\n*   Both `southern` (from Old English *sūþerne*) and `pleasant` (from Middle English *plesant*) did experience a historical vowel shortening/laxing process that was triggered by their phonological environment.\n*   `shadow`, however, has a unique history. It comes from Old English *sceadu*, which already had a short, lax vowel (*æ*). Its tense counterpart, `shade`, comes from a different but related Old English word, *scēad*, which had a long, tense vowel. Therefore, the vowel in `shadow` was never tensed and then laxed; it was inherited as a lax vowel from its direct ancestor.\n\nSo, while all three words (`southern`, `pleasant`, `shadow`) are not examples of TSL, `shadow` is the strongest answer because it did not undergo *any* such laxing process from a tense-vowel base in its direct line of development. The tense/lax relationship with `shade` is due to them evolving from two different forms in Old English.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe words `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` are all examples of Trisyllabic Laxing. The words `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow` are not, as they are disyllabic. Among these three, `shadow` is the most definitive answer because its lax vowel is inherited directly from its Old English ancestor (*sceadu*) and was not created by a laxing process from a tense vowel.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
