    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Repeating Pattern (Heptad Repeat):**\n    Coiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that have a characteristic repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat. This repeat is labeled with the letters `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`. The stability and oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of the coiled-coil are primarily determined by the amino acids at the core positions, `a` and `d`. These positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. The `e` and `g` positions are often occupied by charged residues that form stabilizing salt bridges between the helices.\n\n2.  **Assign the Heptad Repeat to the Sequence:**\n    The given sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\n    We can visually identify four repeating units that look like `EIAxSLK`, where `x` is a variable residue. Let's ignore the flanking `G` residues, which are common at the ends of helices.\n    *   Repeat 1: `EIAQSLK`\n    *   Repeat 2: `EIAKSLK`\n    *   Repeat 3: `EIAWSLK`\n    *   Repeat 4: `EIAQSLK`\n\n    Now, we must assign the `a-b-c-d-e-f-g` positions to this repeat. We are looking for an assignment where the hydrophobic residues (I, A, L, W) fall into the core `a` and `d` positions. In a heptad repeat, the `a` and `d` positions are separated by two amino acids (e.g., `a-b-c-d`).\n    Let's test possible assignments for the `EIAxSLK` unit:\n    *   If `I` is `a`, then `x` would be `d`. In repeats 1 and 4, `x=Q` (Glutamine), which is polar. This is an unfavorable assignment for a core position.\n    *   Let's try the assignment where `A` is `a` and `L` is `d`. The sequence pattern is `A-x-S-L`. This fits the `a-b-c-d` pattern. This would mean the full assignment for the `EIAxSLK` repeat is:\n        `E(f) I(g) A(a) x(b) S(c) L(d) K(e)`\n    This assignment is chemically very sound:\n    *   The `a` position is Alanine (A).\n    *   The `d` position is Leucine (L).\n    *   The `g` position is Isoleucine (I), another hydrophobic residue that often participates in core packing.\n    *   The `e` position is Lysine (K), a charged residue, perfect for forming inter-helical electrostatic interactions.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Core Residues (`a` and `d` positions):**\n    Using the `f-g-a-b-c-d-e` assignment, let's list the residues at the `a` and `d` positions for the entire sequence:\n    *   **`a` positions:** A, A, A, A (Alanine)\n    *   **`d` positions:** L, L, L, L (Leucine)\n\n4.  **Apply Knobs-into-Holes Packing Principles to Determine Oligomeric State:**\n    The size of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` core positions is a major determinant of how many helices can pack together efficiently.\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** Typically requires large hydrophobic residues (like Leucine, Isoleucine) at both `a` and `d` positions to form a sufficient hydrophobic core.\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** The packing is very tight. The `a` position is more buried than `d`. It often favors a beta-branched amino acid (like Isoleucine or Valine) at `a` and an unbranched one (like Leucine) at `d`.\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** The four helices form a bundle. The four `a` residues pack against each other in the very center of the bundle, while the four `d` residues are located at the more open corners between adjacent helices. This packing arrangement strongly favors a **small** residue (like Alanine) at the crowded `a` position to avoid steric clash, and a **large** hydrophobic residue (like Leucine or Isoleucine) at the `d` position.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The sequence shows a consistent pattern of **Alanine (small) at the `a` position** and **Leucine (large) at the `d` position**. This specific pattern (`a`=small, `d`=large) is the classic signature of a **tetrameric (4-helix) coiled-coil**. The packing of four small alanines creates a stable, tight core, while the four large leucines fit perfectly into the larger holes at the corners of the bundle.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state of this protein would be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
