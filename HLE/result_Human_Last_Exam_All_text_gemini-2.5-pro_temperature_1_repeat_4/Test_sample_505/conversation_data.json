    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics of Surface Code Encoding:**\n    *   The surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code. Logical qubits are encoded in the global, topological properties of a 2D array of physical qubits.\n    *   The number of logical qubits `k` that can be encoded depends on the topology of the surface, specifically its genus (number of handles) and the number of boundaries (or holes).\n\n2.  **Analyze a Single \"Patch\" of Surface Code:**\n    *   A standard, rectangular \"patch\" of surface code with properly defined boundaries (e.g., \"smooth\" and \"rough\" edges) is designed to encode exactly **one logical qubit**. The logical X and Z operators are represented by strings of Pauli operators stretching between opposite boundaries of different types.\n    *   This single qubit can be considered the \"base\" qubit for the patch.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Effect of \"Holes\":**\n    *   A \"hole\" is a region within the patch where stabilizers are not measured, effectively creating an internal boundary.\n    *   Each hole introduced into a patch adds a new, independent topological feature. This feature can be used to encode one additional logical qubit.\n    *   For each hole, a new pair of logical operators can be defined. For example, a logical Z operator can be a loop of Z-type Pauli operators enclosing the hole, and the corresponding logical X operator can be a string of X-type Pauli operators connecting the hole's boundary to the patch's outer boundary.\n    *   Therefore, a single patch containing `H` holes can encode a total of `k = 1 + H` logical qubits (1 from the patch's external boundaries and `H` from the `H` internal holes).\n\n4.  **Formulate the Problem:**\n    *   We are given **two patches** of surface code.\n    *   We are given a total of **two holes**.\n    *   Let `k1` and `k2` be the number of logical qubits in patch 1 and patch 2, respectively.\n    *   Let `H1` and `H2` be the number of holes in patch 1 and patch 2, respectively.\n    *   The total number of logical qubits is `k_total = k1 + k2`.\n    *   The total number of holes is constrained: `H1 + H2 = 2`. `H1` and `H2` must be non-negative integers.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits:**\n    *   Using the formula from Step 3, we have:\n        *   `k1 = 1 + H1`\n        *   `k2 = 1 + H2`\n    *   Substituting these into the expression for the total number of qubits:\n        *   `k_total = (1 + H1) + (1 + H2)`\n        *   `k_total = 2 + H1 + H2`\n    *   Now, using the constraint on the total number of holes (`H1 + H2 = 2`):\n        *   `k_total = 2 + 2`\n        *   `k_total = 4`\n\n6.  **Verify with Possible Distributions (to find the maximum):**\n    The question asks for the *maximum* number of logical qubits. We must check if the distribution of holes affects the total. There are two possible ways to distribute the two holes:\n\n    *   **Case A: One hole in each patch.**\n        *   `H1 = 1`, `H2 = 1`.\n        *   Qubits in patch 1: `k1 = 1 + H1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n        *   Qubits in patch 2: `k2 = 1 + H2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n        *   Total qubits: `k_total = k1 + k2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n    *   **Case B: Both holes in one patch.**\n        *   `H1 = 2`, `H2 = 0` (or vice-versa, which is symmetrical).\n        *   Qubits in patch 1: `k1 = 1 + H1 = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n        *   Qubits in patch 2: `k2 = 1 + H2 = 1 + 0 = 1`.\n        *   Total qubits: `k_total = k1 + k2 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth possible distributions of the two holes across the two patches result in a total of 4 logical qubits. Since the result is constant for all valid configurations, the maximum number of logical qubits is 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Patch\":** The analysis hinges on interpreting a \"patch of surface code\" as a structure that already encodes one logical qubit by default due to its specially configured boundaries.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Hole\":** The analysis assumes each hole adds the capacity for one additional logical qubit. These interpretations are standard in the context of topological quantum computing.\n*   **Independence:** The two patches are treated as separate, non-interacting systems. Therefore, the total number of logical qubits is the simple sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\n<<<4>>>"
