    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ratio of the two isomer products.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactant and Reaction Type**\nThe reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is a linear conjugated polyene with four double bonds. The reaction is an electrocyclic ring closure occurring under thermal conditions. The reacting part of the molecule is the octatetraene system from C2 to C9. This system contains 8 π-electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory Rules**\nFor an electrocyclic reaction, we use the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which can be derived from FMO theory.\n*   **Number of π-electrons:** The reacting system is an octatetraene, which has 8 π-electrons. This is a 4n system, where n=2.\n*   **Reaction Condition:** The reaction is thermal.\n*   **Selection Rule:** For a 4n π-electron system under thermal conditions, the reaction proceeds via a **conrotatory** ring closure. This means the terminal p-orbitals of the conjugated system rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) to form the new σ-bond.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Reactant's Reactive Conformation**\nThe cyclization occurs between C2 and C9. We need to determine the orientation of the substituents (a methyl group and a hydrogen atom) at these two termini. The molecule must adopt an s-cisoid conformation for the cyclization to occur. Let's define substituents pointing towards the inside of the coiled chain as \"in\" and those pointing to the outside as \"out\".\n\n*   **At C2:** The double bond C2=C3 has a (Z) configuration. In IUPAC nomenclature, the priority of the groups on C2 is CH₃ > H, and on C3 is the rest of the chain (C4...) > H. For a (Z) isomer, the high-priority groups are on the same side. Thus, the methyl group on C2 and the C4-part of the chain are on the same side. In the reactive s-cisoid conformation, this places the **methyl group at C2 \"in\"** and the hydrogen \"out\".\n*   **At C9:** The double bond C8=C9 has an (E) configuration. The priority of the groups on C9 is CH₃ > H, and on C8 is the rest of the chain (C7...) > H. For an (E) isomer, the high-priority groups are on opposite sides. Thus, the methyl group on C9 and the C7-part of the chain are on opposite sides. This places the **methyl group at C9 \"out\"** and the hydrogen \"in\".\n\nSo, the reactive conformation has one methyl group \"in\" and the other \"out\".\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Stereochemical Outcome of the Conrotatory Closure**\nThe stereochemical outcome of a pericyclic reaction depends on the mode of rotation (conrotatory or disrotatory) and the initial geometry of the substituents (in/in, out/out, or in/out). The established rules for conrotatory closures are:\n*   in/in → cis product\n*   out/out → trans product\n*   **in/out → cis product**\n\nOur reactant has an \"in/out\" arrangement of the two methyl groups. According to the selection rules, the thermally allowed conrotatory pathway will lead to the **cis-isomer (A)**.\n\n**Step 5: Account for the Formation of the Minor Product**\nThe problem states that two products are formed: the cis-isomer (A) and the trans-isomer (B). According to our FMO analysis, the allowed pathway produces only the cis-isomer A. The trans-isomer B must therefore be formed via a higher-energy, \"forbidden\" pathway. In this case, the forbidden pathway would be the disrotatory ring closure.\n\n*   **Allowed Path:** Reactant → [Conrotatory TS] → cis-Isomer (A)\n*   **Forbidden Path:** Reactant → [Disrotatory TS] → trans-Isomer (B)\n\nThe activation energy for the allowed pathway is significantly lower than for the forbidden pathway. Therefore, the rate of formation of the cis-isomer (A) will be much faster than the rate of formation of the trans-isomer (B).\n\n**Step 6: Predict the Ratio of A to B**\nSince A is the product of the kinetically favored \"allowed\" pathway and B is the product of the \"forbidden\" pathway, **A is the major product and B is the minor product**. The ratio [A]/[B] will be greater than 1.\n\nThe problem asks for a prediction of the ratio. Without specific energy values, a precise numerical value cannot be calculated. However, in the context of such problems, a highly selective reaction is often represented by a simple integer ratio like 9:1. This reflects a significant, but not infinite, difference in activation energies, which is consistent with the problem stating that both products are indeed formed. A ratio of 9:1 for A:B implies that the cis-isomer is strongly favored.\n\nTherefore, the predicted ratio of A to B is 9:1. The question asks for the ratio of A and B, which can be written as the value of [A]/[B].\n\nRatio [A]/[B] = 9/1 = 9."
