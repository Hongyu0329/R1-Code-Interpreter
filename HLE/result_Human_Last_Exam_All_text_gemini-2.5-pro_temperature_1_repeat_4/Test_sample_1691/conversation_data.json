    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to derive the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$.\n\n**1. Analyze the integral for small $\\epsilon$**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nWe are interested in the behavior of this integral for small positive $\\epsilon$ (the \"small $\\epsilon$ regime\"). Let the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + g(x)$, where $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$.\n\nThe key to the asymptotic analysis is to identify where the integrand becomes large. This happens when the denominator becomes small. For $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the denominator approaches $g(x)$. We need to find the zeros of $g(x)$ in the integration interval $[0, 15.00]$.\n\nThe function $g(x)$ can be written as $g(x) = x^{5.0}(9.0 + 5.0 x + 9.0 x^{3.0})$.\nFor $x > 0$, all terms are positive, so $g(x) > 0$.\nAt $x = 0$, we have $g(0) = 0$.\n\nThus, the denominator $g(x)$ has a single zero at $x=0$ within the integration interval. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + g(x)}$ develops a singularity at $x=0$. The dominant contribution to the integral will come from the region near this point.\n\n**2. Approximate the integrand near the singularity**\n\nNear the singularity at $x=0$, we can approximate the function $g(x)$ by its Taylor series expansion. For small $x$, the term with the lowest power of $x$ will dominate.\n$g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0} \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$ for $x \\to 0$.\n\nTherefore, we can approximate the integral by replacing $g(x)$ with its leading-order behavior near $x=0$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n**3. Calculate the approximate integral**\n\nThe contribution from the singularity at $x=0$ determines the leading-order behavior of $I(\\epsilon)$. The integrand decays quickly as $x$ increases (like $1/x^5$), so the value of the upper limit (15.00) does not affect the leading singular term. We can extend the upper limit to $\\infty$ to facilitate the calculation. This simplification yields a standard integral form.\n\nLet the approximate integral be $J(\\epsilon)$:\n$J(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\nThis integral can be solved using a general formula. For an integral of the form $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + a x^n} dx$, the result is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + a x^n} dx = \\frac{\\pi}{n a^{1/n} \\sin(\\pi/n)} \\epsilon^{\\frac{1-n}{n}}$.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n- $a = 9.0$\n- $n = 5.0$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n- The power of $\\epsilon$ is $\\frac{1-5.0}{5.0} = -\\frac{4.0}{5.0} = -0.8$.\n- The coefficient is $\\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$.\n\n**4. The final analytical formula**\n\nCombining these parts, we get the analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\epsilon^{-4.0/5.0}$\n\nThis formula captures the dominant behavior of the integral as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$. The integral diverges, and this formula describes the rate of divergence.\n\nCareful points to consider:\n- The approximation relies on the behavior near a single point ($x=0$). This is valid because the singularity at this point provides the dominant contribution.\n- The terms $5.0 x^{6.0}$ and $9.0 x^{8.0}$ and the upper limit of integration $15.00$ affect the next terms in the asymptotic expansion (e.g., the constant term), but not the leading singular behavior we have found.\n- The formula is \"analytical\" as it is expressed in terms of standard mathematical constants ($\\pi$) and functions ($\\sin$).\n\nFinal expression:\nThe analytical approximation for $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime is:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\epsilon^{-4.0/5.0}>>>"
