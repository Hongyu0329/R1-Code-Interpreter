    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe problem provides a system of linear first-order ordinary differential equations, which is the Kolmogorov-Chapman system for a continuous-time Markov chain with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. The variables $P_i(t)$ represent the probability of the system being in state $i$ at time $t$. The constants $\\lambda_{ij}$ are the transition rates from state $i$ to state $j$.\n\nThe system of equations is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = \\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\nWith the conservation of probability:\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\nThe transition rates are given as:\n$$\n\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008\n$$\nThe question asks to find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$. This requires finding the stationary (or steady-state) probabilities of the system.\n\n**2. Setting up the Steady-State Equations**\nIn the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these limiting probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. In this state, their time derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\nSetting the derivatives to zero, the system of differential equations transforms into a system of linear algebraic equations, also known as the balance equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\nAnd the normalization condition remains:\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\n**3. Solving the System of Equations**\nFirst, substitute the given numerical values of the transition rates into the balance equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 \\pi_{0} + 0.65 \\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 \\pi_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) \\pi_{1} + 0.392 \\pi_{2} + 0.008 \\pi_{3} \\implies 0 = 0.019 \\pi_{0} - 1.05 \\pi_{1} + 0.392 \\pi_{2} + 0.008 \\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 \\pi_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_{2} \\implies 0 = 0.4 \\pi_{1} - 0.4 \\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 \\pi_{2} - 0.008 \\pi_{3}$\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\nNow, we solve this system. A good strategy is to express $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_2$, and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 \\pi_{2} = 0.008 \\pi_{3} \\implies \\pi_{2} = \\pi_{3}$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 \\pi_{1} = 0.4 \\pi_{2} \\implies \\pi_{1} = \\pi_{2}$\n\nCombining these results, we get a simple relationship:\n$\\pi_{1} = \\pi_{2} = \\pi_{3}$\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 \\pi_{0} = 0.65 \\pi_{1} \\implies \\pi_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_{1}$\n\nNow, use the normalization equation (5) to find the value of $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\nSubstitute the expressions in terms of $\\pi_1$:\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n\nTo avoid rounding errors, we can work with fractions:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} = \\frac{650}{19}$\nSo the equation becomes:\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} + \\frac{3 \\times 19}{19}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19}\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\n**4. Calculating the Required Probabilities**\nNow that we have $\\pi_1$, we can find $\\pi_0$:\n$\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19} \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\nThe other probabilities are:\n$\\pi_2 = \\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n$\\pi_3 = \\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\nAs a check, we can sum them up:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19 + 19 + 19}{707} = \\frac{707}{707} = 1$.\nThe probabilities sum to 1, as expected.\n\n**5. Finding the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, which is $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768175...$\n\nRounding to six decimal places, the answer is 0.946252.\n\n<<<0.946252>>>"
