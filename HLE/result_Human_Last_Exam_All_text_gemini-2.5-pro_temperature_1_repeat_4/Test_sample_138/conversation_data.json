    "An analysis of the properties of positive definite even lattices reveals that their existence is subject to certain necessary conditions relating their dimension, signature, and local structure at the prime 2. We will analyze the problem step-by-step to determine if such lattices can exist.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   A **lattice** $L$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. It is defined by an inner product, which can be represented by a Gram matrix $G$.\n*   **Dimension**: The dimension of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which is $n=17$.\n*   **Positive definite**: The quadratic form $Q(x) = x \\cdot x$ is positive for all non-zero $x \\in L$. This implies the signature of the lattice is $(n, 0)$, so here it is $(17, 0)$.\n*   **Even lattice**: For every vector $x \\in L$, the squared norm $x \\cdot x$ is an even integer.\n*   **Determinant**: The determinant of the Gram matrix $G$ of a basis for $L$. Here, $\\det(L) = 2$.\n\n**2. Local Properties (p-adic structure)**\n\nThe classification of lattices relies on understanding their structure over the p-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ for all primes $p$. The existence of a global lattice requires that the local properties are compatible. The most stringent conditions often come from the prime $p=2$.\n\nLet $L$ be a hypothetical lattice with the given properties. We consider its 2-adic completion $L_2 = L \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**3. Jordan Decomposition over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$**\n\nAny lattice over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ admits a Jordan decomposition into an orthogonal sum of lattices of the form $2^k J_k$, where each $J_k$ is a unimodular $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-lattice.\n\nThe determinant of $L_2$ is related to the determinants of its Jordan components. The 2-adic valuation of the determinant is given by:\n$v_2(\\det(L_2)) = \\sum_{k \\ge 0} k \\cdot \\dim(J_k)$\n\nIn our case, $\\det(L) = 2$, so $v_2(\\det(L_2)) = v_2(2) = 1$. The equation becomes:\n$\\dim(J_1) + 2\\dim(J_2) + 3\\dim(J_3) + \\dots = 1$\n\nSince the dimensions must be non-negative integers, the only possible solution is:\n*   $\\dim(J_1) = 1$\n*   $\\dim(J_k) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 2$.\n\nThe total dimension of the lattice is $n=17$. The sum of the dimensions of the Jordan components must be 17:\n$\\sum_{k \\ge 0} \\dim(J_k) = \\dim(J_0) + \\dim(J_1) = 17$\nSince $\\dim(J_1) = 1$, we must have $\\dim(J_0) = 16$.\n\nSo, the Jordan decomposition of $L_2$ must be of the form $L_2 = J_0 \\perp 2J_1$, where:\n*   $J_0$ is a unimodular $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-lattice of dimension 16.\n*   $J_1$ is a unimodular $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-lattice of dimension 1.\n\n**4. The \"Even\" Condition**\n\nThe condition that $L$ is an even lattice imposes constraints on its 2-adic structure. A $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-lattice is even if and only if for every component $2^k J_k$ in its Jordan decomposition, the form $x \\mapsto 2^k Q_k(x,x)$ takes values in $2\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   For the component $2J_1$, the norms are multiplied by 2, so they are automatically in $2\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This component is always even.\n*   For the component $J_0$ (where $k=0$), the norms themselves must be in $2\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This means that $J_0$ must be an even unimodular lattice (also known as a Type II lattice).\n\nSo, the structure of $L_2$ is further constrained:\n*   $J_0$ is a Type II unimodular $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-lattice of dimension 16.\n*   $J_1$ is a unimodular $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-lattice of dimension 1. A 1-dimensional unimodular lattice is necessarily of Type I, of the form $\\langle u \\rangle$ where $u$ is a 2-adic unit ($u \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\} \\pmod 8$).\n\n**5. The Existence Condition (The Signature-Oddity Congruence)**\n\nA fundamental theorem in the theory of integral quadratic forms provides a necessary condition for the existence of a lattice with a given signature and 2-adic structure. For a lattice $L$ with signature $(n_+, n_-)$ and 2-adic completion $L_2$, the following congruence must hold:\n$n_+ - n_- \\equiv \\omega_2(L_2) \\pmod 8$\nwhere $\\omega_2(L_2)$ is the 2-adic oddity invariant of the lattice $L_2$.\n\nFor our hypothetical lattice:\n*   $n_+ = 17$ and $n_- = 0$. So, $n_+ - n_- = 17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\n\nThe 2-adic oddity $\\omega_2(L_2)$ is calculated from its Jordan decomposition $L_2 = \\bigoplus_k 2^k J_k$. The formula is:\n$\\omega_2(L_2) = \\sum_{k \\ge 0} k \\cdot \\dim(J_k) + \\sum_{k \\ge 0} \\text{oddity of the Type I part of } J_k$\n\nLet's calculate this for our $L_2 = J_0 \\perp 2J_1$:\n*   The first sum is $\\sum k \\cdot \\dim(J_k) = (0 \\cdot \\dim(J_0)) + (1 \\cdot \\dim(J_1)) = 0 + 1 = 1$.\n*   The second sum requires the oddities of the Type I parts.\n    *   For $J_0$, it is a Type II lattice, so its Type I part is zero, and its oddity contribution is 0.\n    *   For $J_1 = \\langle u \\rangle$, it is a Type I lattice. Its oddity is its trace modulo 8, which is just $u \\pmod 8$.\n*   Combining these, the total oddity is $\\omega_2(L_2) = 1 + u$.\n\n**6. The Contradiction**\n\nNow we substitute our calculated values into the existence congruence:\n$n_+ - n_- \\equiv \\omega_2(L_2) \\pmod 8$\n$17 \\equiv 1 + u \\pmod 8$\n$1 \\equiv 1 + u \\pmod 8$\n$0 \\equiv u \\pmod 8$\n\nThis result implies that the 2-adic unit $u$ must be divisible by 8. This is a contradiction, as a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ must be an odd integer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe assumption that a positive definite even lattice of dimension 17 and determinant 2 exists leads to a logical contradiction. The necessary conditions for the existence of such a lattice cannot be satisfied. Therefore, no such lattice can exist.\n\nThe number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2 is 0."
