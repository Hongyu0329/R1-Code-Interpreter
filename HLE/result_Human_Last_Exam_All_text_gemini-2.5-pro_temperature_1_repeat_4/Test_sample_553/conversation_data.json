    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Musical Terminology in the Question**\n\n*   **The Beatles:** The artist is clearly identified. We must limit our search to their discography.\n*   **Starts with:** We need to analyze the very beginning of the song, specifically the introductory chords.\n*   **Tonic:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the first degree of the scale (represented by the Roman numeral I in a major key or i in a minor key). For example, in the key of G major, the tonic chord is G major. In the key of F minor, the tonic chord is F minor.\n*   **Minor fifth chord:** This is the most crucial part of the question. The \"fifth\" refers to the fifth degree of the scale. A standard chord on the fifth degree is usually a major chord (called the dominant). A \"minor fifth chord\" means we are looking for a *minor* chord built on that fifth degree (represented by v). This is a less common, but very distinctive, harmonic choice.\n*   **Chord Jump:** This simply means a chord change or progression from one chord to the next.\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song that begins with a progression of **Tonic -> Minor Fifth Chord** (i.e., **i -> v** in a minor key, or **I -> v** as a modal interchange in a major key).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs**\n\nLet's consider some famous Beatles songs and their opening chord progressions.\n\n*   **\"Let It Be\":** Key of C major. Starts C (I) -> G (V) -> Am (vi). This is Tonic to Major Fifth (Dominant), not Minor Fifth.\n*   **\"Yesterday\":** Key of F major. Starts F (I) -> Em7 (vii). This is Tonic to the chord on the seventh degree.\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Starts with a famously unique and dissonant G11sus4 chord. It does not start on a clear tonic.\n*   **\"Help!\":** Key of A major. The main riff is over A (I) -> C#m (iii) -> F#m (vi). It does not start with the requested progression.\n*   **\"In My Life\":** Key of A major. The intro riff is over A (I) and E (V) chords. This is Tonic to Major Fifth.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Correct Song**\n\nNow let's analyze the song **\"Michelle\"**.\n\n*   **Key:** The verse of \"Michelle\" is in the key of **F minor**.\n*   **Tonic Chord (i):** In the key of F minor, the tonic chord is **F minor**.\n*   **Fifth Degree:** The fifth note of the F minor scale is C.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** A minor chord built on the note C is **C minor**.\n\nNow, let's listen to or recall the very beginning of \"Michelle\". The song starts with a gentle, fingerpicked acoustic guitar introduction.\n*   The first chord played is **F minor** (the tonic).\n*   The immediate next chord it \"jumps\" to is **C minor** (the minor fifth chord).\n\nThis progression, **F minor -> C minor**, perfectly matches the description: a chord jump from the tonic (i) to the minor fifth chord (v). This distinctive harmonic opening gives the song its sophisticated, slightly melancholic, French-chanson feel.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, no other famous Beatles song starts with this specific I -> v or i -> v progression. The song that perfectly fits the description is \"Michelle\".\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
