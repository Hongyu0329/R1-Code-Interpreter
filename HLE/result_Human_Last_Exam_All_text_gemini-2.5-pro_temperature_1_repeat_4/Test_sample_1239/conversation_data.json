    "An analysis of the symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations involves finding the group of transformations that leave the equations invariant. This is a classic problem in the field of symmetry analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs). The dimension of the Lie group is equal to the dimension of its associated Lie algebra, which is spanned by the infinitesimal generators of the symmetry transformations.\n\n**Step 1: The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations**\n\nIn $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the motion of an incompressible fluid with constant density $\\rho$ and kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ is described by the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and the pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$, which satisfy the following system of PDEs:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nFor simplicity in symmetry analysis, we can set $\\rho=1$ by absorbing it into the pressure term.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Symmetries**\n\nWe seek transformations of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ that map solutions to other solutions. A systematic way to find these is to compute the infinitesimal generators of the Lie group. The full calculation is quite involved, but the result is well-known. The symmetries can be categorized as follows:\n\n*   **Time Translation:** The equations are autonomous (coefficients do not depend on time $t$). This gives rise to invariance under time shifts:\n    $t \\to t + \\epsilon$.\n    This corresponds to **1** generator.\n\n*   **Space Translations:** The equations are homogeneous in space (coefficients do not depend on the spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$). This leads to invariance under spatial shifts:\n    $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon \\mathbf{c}$, for any constant vector $\\mathbf{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    This corresponds to **3** independent generators (one for each spatial direction).\n\n*   **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are isotropic (invariant with respect to the orientation of the coordinate system). This gives invariance under rotations of both the spatial coordinates and the vector velocity field:\n    $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to R\\mathbf{u}$, where $R$ is a rotation matrix from SO(3).\n    The group SO(3) is 3-dimensional, corresponding to **3** independent generators (rotations about the $x_1, x_2, x_3$ axes).\n\n*   **Galilean Boosts:** The equations obey the principle of Galilean relativity. They are invariant under a transformation to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$:\n    $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon \\mathbf{v} t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\epsilon \\mathbf{v}$.\n    This corresponds to **3** independent generators (one for a boost in each spatial direction).\n\n*   **Scaling (Dilation):** The Navier-Stokes equations possess a specific scaling symmetry. If $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}))$ is a solution, then so is the scaled set of functions $(\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}(\\tilde{t}, \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}), \\tilde{p}(\\tilde{t}, \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}))$, where the transformation is:\n    $t \\to e^{2\\epsilon} t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to e^{\\epsilon} \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to e^{-\\epsilon} \\mathbf{u}$, $p \\to e^{-2\\epsilon} p$.\n    This is a one-parameter group of transformations, adding **1** generator to the Lie algebra.\n\n**Step 3: Careful Points and Interpretation**\n\n*   **Infinite-Dimensional Symmetries:** The pressure $p$ only appears as a gradient, $\\nabla p$. Therefore, the equations are invariant under the transformation $p \\to p + f(t)$ for any arbitrary function of time $f(t)$. This constitutes an infinite-dimensional group of symmetries (a gauge symmetry). However, in the context of determining the \"dimension of the Lie group,\" it is standard practice to refer to the maximal *finite-dimensional* Lie group of point symmetries. Therefore, this infinite-dimensional part is excluded from the count.\n\n*   **Dependence on Spatial Dimension:** The dimension of the symmetry group depends on the spatial dimension $n$ of the problem. The question specifically asks for $\\mathbb{R}^3$ ($n=3$). Our count is specific to this case. (For $n=2$, the symmetry group is infinite-dimensional in a different way related to the vorticity equation).\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Total Dimension**\n\nThe dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the number of independent generators from each finite-dimensional symmetry subgroup:\n*   Time Translation: 1\n*   Space Translations: 3\n*   Spatial Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean Boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\nThis 11-dimensional Lie group is sometimes referred to as the Galilean-similitude group.\n\n<<<11>>>"
