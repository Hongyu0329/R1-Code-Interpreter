    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community in Quebec, Canada. It is located on the southern coast of the Rupert River, very close to where the river flows into James Bay. Its geographic position is in the western part of Quebec.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nQuebec shares borders with several other Canadian provinces and territories:\n*   **Ontario** to the west and southwest.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador** to the east.\n*   **New Brunswick** to the southeast.\n*   **Nunavut** to the north. The border with Nunavut is primarily a maritime one, running through Hudson Bay, the Hudson Strait, and Ungava Bay. Critically, several islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay are also part of Nunavut.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Waskaganish to its Neighbors**\nWe need to compare the distance from Waskaganish to the border of each neighboring province or territory.\n\n*   **Waskaganish to Ontario:** Waskaganish is situated on the eastern shore of James Bay. The western shore of James Bay is part of the province of Ontario. The distance from Waskaganish directly west across the southern part of James Bay to the Ontario coastline is relatively short. The land border between Quebec and Ontario also begins at the southern tip of James Bay, not far south of Waskaganish.\n\n*   **Waskaganish to Nunavut:** The mainland of Nunavut is far to the north of Waskaganish. However, the territory of Nunavut includes all the islands in James Bay, such as Akimiski Island. While Akimiski Island is in James Bay, it is located more towards the center and north of the bay, making it further from Waskaganish than the nearby Ontario coast.\n\n*   **Waskaganish to Newfoundland and Labrador:** The border with Labrador is located on the far eastern side of Quebec. Waskaganish is in the far west, making this distance very large.\n\n*   **Waskaganish to New Brunswick:** The border with New Brunswick is far to the south, below the Gasp√© Peninsula. This is also a very large distance from Waskaganish.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Closest Province or Territory**\nBy comparing the relative locations on a map, it is clear that the shortest distance from Waskaganish to a jurisdiction outside of Quebec is the distance across the southern part of James Bay to the Ontario coast. The distance to the Nunavut islands in the bay is greater, and the distances to Newfoundland and Labrador or New Brunswick are significantly larger.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is important to know that Waskaganish is on the coast of James Bay.\n*   It is crucial to consider all parts of neighboring territories, including the islands in James Bay which belong to Nunavut.\n*   A visual inspection on a map of Canada clearly shows that the Ontario border (both the maritime boundary across the bay and the land boundary to the southwest) is much closer to Waskaganish than any part of Nunavut, Newfoundland and Labrador, or New Brunswick.\n\nTherefore, the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
