    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (or 2D square) lattice, denoted as a(10).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** A grid of points (x, y) with integer coordinates.\n*   **Walk:** A sequence of points starting at an origin (we'll use (0,0)), where each point is one step away (horizontally or vertically) from the previous one.\n*   **n-step Walk:** A walk with n steps (and thus n+1 points).\n*   **Self-Avoiding:** The walk never visits the same point more than once.\n*   **a(n):** The function that counts the number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks.\n\n**2. Calculating a(n) for Small Values of n**\n\nWe can calculate the first few terms of the sequence by direct enumeration.\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    *   From the origin (0,0), there are 4 possible first steps: North, South, East, or West.\n    *   All 4 are valid 1-step self-avoiding walks.\n    *   **a(1) = 4**\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    *   We start with the 4 paths of length 1. For each, we take a second step.\n    *   **Careful point:** The walk cannot immediately reverse. For a path that went East to (1,0), the next step cannot be West. This leaves 3 possible directions for the second step.\n    *   Since a 2-step walk cannot otherwise intersect itself, we simply multiply.\n    *   a(2) = (choices for step 1) × (choices for step 2) = 4 × 3 = 12.\n    *   **a(2) = 12**\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    *   We extend the 12 paths of length 2. Again, there are 3 non-reversing choices for the third step.\n    *   **Careful point:** We must check if a 3-step walk can self-intersect. The shortest possible loop on a square lattice requires 4 steps (to form a 1x1 square). Therefore, a 3-step non-reversing walk is guaranteed to be self-avoiding.\n    *   a(3) = a(2) × 3 = 12 × 3 = 36.\n    *   **a(3) = 36**\n\n*   **a(4):**\n    *   Starting from the 36 paths of length 3, we consider the 3 non-reversing extensions for each, giving a potential 36 × 3 = 108 paths.\n    *   **Careful point:** A 4-step walk can self-intersect by forming a square loop and returning to the starting point. We must identify and exclude these cases.\n    *   An intersection occurs if a path `p0 -> p1 -> p2 -> p3` takes a fourth step from `p3` back to `p0`. This can only happen if `p3` is adjacent to `p0`.\n    *   Let's count the number of 3-step paths where the endpoint is adjacent to the origin. These paths must form a \"U\" shape (e.g., East, then North, then West).\n        *   Choices for the first step: 4 (e.g., East)\n        *   Choices for the second step (must be a turn): 2 (e.g., North or South)\n        *   Choices for the third step (to complete the \"U\"): 1 (e.g., West)\n        *   Number of such \"U\"-shaped paths = 4 × 2 × 1 = 8.\n    *   For these 8 paths, one of the 3 possible extensions is forbidden (the one that returns to the origin). So they only contribute 8 × 2 = 16 valid walks.\n    *   The remaining 36 - 8 = 28 paths do not end near the origin, so all 3 of their extensions are valid. They contribute 28 × 3 = 84 valid walks.\n    *   Total a(4) = 16 + 84 = 100.\n    *   **a(4) = 100**\n\n**3. The Challenge for Larger n**\n\n*   **Careful point:** As n increases, this method of direct enumeration becomes extremely complex. The number of path configurations to check grows exponentially, and the rules for identifying potential self-intersections become much more complicated. For a path `p0 -> ... -> pn`, the next step is invalid if it lands on any of the previous points `p0, p1, ..., pn-1`.\n*   There is no known simple closed-form formula for a(n). Finding a(n) for larger n is a significant computational challenge.\n\n**4. Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\n*   The problem of counting self-avoiding walks is a classic in computational physics and combinatorics. The values for a(n) have been calculated using powerful computers and sophisticated algorithms.\n*   The sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411. We can look up the value for n=10 from this established resource.\n*   The sequence is: a(1)=4, a(2)=12, a(3)=36, a(4)=100, a(5)=284, a(6)=780, a(7)=2172, a(8)=5916, a(9)=16268, **a(10)=44100**.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
