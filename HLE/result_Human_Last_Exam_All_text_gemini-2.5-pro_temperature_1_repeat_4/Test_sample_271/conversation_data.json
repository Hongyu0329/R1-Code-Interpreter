    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Factor the polynomial:**\n    Let $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We look for common factors.\n    We can group the terms as follows:\n    $f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n    $f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n    $f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n    So the roots of $f(x)$ are the roots of $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the factors and their splitting fields:**\n    *   The polynomial $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. Its splitting field is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n    *   The polynomial $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3. All other coefficients (0, 0, -9, 3) are divisible by 3. The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n    *   To determine the Galois group of $h(x)$, we analyze its roots. The degree of $h(x)$ is the prime number 5. A theorem states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly $p-2$ real roots, its Galois group is the symmetric group $S_p$.\n        Let's find the number of real roots of $h(x)$. The derivative is $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $h'(x)$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. There are two real critical points. A quintic polynomial with two critical points can have at most three real roots.\n        We evaluate $h(x)$ at some integer points:\n        $h(-2) = -32 + 18 + 3 = -11$\n        $h(0) = 3$\n        $h(1) = 1 - 9 + 3 = -5$\n        $h(2) = 32 - 18 + 3 = 17$\n        Since $h(-2)<0$ and $h(0)>0$, there is a root in $(-2, 0)$.\n        Since $h(0)>0$ and $h(1)<0$, there is a root in $(0, 1)$.\n        Since $h(1)<0$ and $h(2)>0$, there is a root in $(1, 2)$.\n        Thus, $h(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots.\n        According to the theorem, the Galois group of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$. Let $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$. Then $[K_h : \\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Galois group of K/Q:**\n    The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its factors, $K = K_g K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\text{roots of } h(x))$.\n    The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$. The order of the group is given by $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}][K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_g \\cap K_h : \\mathbb{Q}]}$.\n    We need to determine the intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_h$.\n    The subfields of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ are $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. So the intersection is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The Galois group of $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$. The only subgroup of index 2 in $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$. By Galois theory, $K_h$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$, where $\\Delta_h$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\n    The discriminant of $x^n+px+q$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}((1-n)^{n-1}p^n + n^n q^{n-1})$.\n    For $h(x)=x^5-9x+3$, we have $n=5, p=-9, q=3$.\n    $\\Delta_h = (-1)^{10}((-4)^4(-9)^5 + 5^5 3^4) = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\n    Since $\\Delta_h < 0$, the quadratic subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$ is an imaginary quadratic field.\n    The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$, which implies $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is not a subfield of $K_h$.\n    Therefore, the intersection is $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    This implies that $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\n    The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n4.  **Find the degrees of intermediate normal extensions:**\n    We are looking for the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\n    By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions $L$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$.\n    The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n    We need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$.\n    The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n    The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\n    The normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$ are:\n    a) **Product subgroups:** $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\unlhd C_2$ and $N_2 \\unlhd S_5$.\n        *   $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_1|=2$. $[G:H_1] = 240/2 = 120$. This corresponds to $L_1 = K_h$.\n        *   $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|H_2|=60$. $[G:H_2] = 240/60 = 4$. This corresponds to $L_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$.\n        *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|H_3|=120$. $[G:H_3] = 240/120 = 2$. This corresponds to $L_3 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n        *   $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$: $|H_4|=2 \\cdot 60=120$. $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$. This corresponds to $L_4 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$.\n\n    b) **Skew subgroups:** These arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups. The non-trivial quotients of $C_2$ is $C_2$. The non-trivial quotients of $S_5$ are $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$ and $S_5/\\{e\\} \\cong S_5$. The only common non-trivial quotient group is $C_2$.\n    This gives rise to a normal subgroup defined by the isomorphism $\\phi: C_2 \\to S_5/A_5$.\n        *   $H_5 = \\{(c, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\phi(c) = \\sigma A_5 \\}$. Let's identify $C_2$ with $\\{1, -1\\}$ and the quotient $S_5/A_5$ with $\\{1, -1\\}$ (where $-1$ is the coset of odd permutations). Then $H_5 = \\{(c, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid c = \\text{sgn}(\\sigma)\\}$.\n        The size of this subgroup is the number of pairs $(1, \\sigma)$ with $\\sigma \\in A_5$ plus the number of pairs $(-1, \\sigma)$ with $\\sigma \\notin A_5$. This is $|A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n        $|H_5|=120$. $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$. This corresponds to the field $L_5 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2\\Delta_h})$.\n\n5.  **List the possible degrees:**\n    The possible degrees of the intermediate normal extensions $L$ are the indices we calculated.\n    The indices are 120, 4, 2, 2, 2.\n    The set of unique possible degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\nFinal answer is the list of these degrees.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
