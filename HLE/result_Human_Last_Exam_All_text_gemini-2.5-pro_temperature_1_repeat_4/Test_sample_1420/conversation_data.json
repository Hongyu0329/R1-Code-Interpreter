    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Method:**\n    *   **System:** The problem concerns critical phenomena in a system with spatial dimension $d=3$. Although not explicitly stated, the context of the $\\epsilon$-expansion typically refers to the universality class of the Ising model (or the more general $O(N)$ model). We will assume the Ising model ($N=1$), which is the most common case for such questions.\n    *   **Method:** The method specified is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion, a cornerstone of the renormalization group (RG) theory.\n\n2.  **Understand the Epsilon Expansion:**\n    *   The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative method used to calculate critical exponents as a power series in the parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$.\n    *   $d_c$ is the upper critical dimension, which is the dimension above which mean-field theory exponents become exact. For the Ising/$O(N)$ model, the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n    *   For the specific case of $d=3$, the expansion parameter is $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n3.  **Define the Specific Heat Exponent $\\alpha$:**\n    *   The specific heat $C$ near the critical temperature $T_c$ is described by the scaling law $C \\sim |t|^{-\\alpha}$, where $t = (T-T_c)/T_c$ is the reduced temperature.\n    *   A key result from RG theory is the hyperscaling relation (also known as Josephson's law), which connects $\\alpha$ to the spatial dimension $d$ and the correlation length exponent $\\nu$:\n        $$ \\alpha = 2 - d\\nu $$\n    *   **Careful Point:** This relation is fundamental. To find $\\alpha$, we first need to find the exponent $\\nu$.\n\n4.  **Find the Correlation Length Exponent $\\nu$ via $\\epsilon$-Expansion:**\n    *   The correlation length exponent $\\nu$ is one of the primary results from an RG calculation. For the general $O(N)$ model, the one-loop $\\epsilon$-expansion for $\\nu$ is given by:\n        $$ \\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)} \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to use the correct formula. This is the standard one-loop result.\n    *   For the Ising model, we set $N=1$:\n        $$ \\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1+2}{4(1+8)} \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{36} \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{12} \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n\n5.  **Derive the $\\epsilon$-Expansion for $\\alpha$:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the expressions for $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ and the expansion for $\\nu$ into the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$.\n    *   $$ \\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{12} \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right) $$\n    *   We expand the product, keeping only terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$ (since our expression for $\\nu$ is only to first order):\n        $$ \\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon - \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right] $$\n    *   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to forget the $-\\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$ term. Both terms linear in $\\epsilon$ must be included.\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        $$ \\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right] $$\n        $$ \\alpha = 2 - 2 - \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n        $$ \\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2}{6} - \\frac{3}{6} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n        $$ \\alpha = - \\left( -\\frac{1}{6} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n        $$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{6} \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value for d=3:**\n    *   As established in Step 2, for a spatial dimension of $d=3$, we have $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n    *   Substitute $\\epsilon=1$ into the first-order result for $\\alpha$:\n        $$ \\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6} $$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat, calculated to first order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion for a system in $d=3$ dimensions (where $\\epsilon=1$), is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
