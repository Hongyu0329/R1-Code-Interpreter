    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in Vergil's line.\n\n**The Line:**\n\"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n\n**Step 1: Translation and Grammatical Breakdown**\n*   **Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, lead on the nurturing day, O Lucifer.\"\n*   **Nascere:** Imperative form of `nascor` (to be born). A command: \"Be born!\"\n*   **praeque:** The preposition `prae` (before) with the enclitic conjunction `-que` (and). It connects `Nascere` with what follows.\n*   **diem:** Accusative singular of `dies` (day).\n*   **veniens:** Present participle of `venio` (to come), modifying the implied \"you\" (Lucifer). \"coming.\"\n*   **age:** Imperative form of `ago` (to lead, bring). A command: \"lead on!\" or \"bring!\"\n*   **Lucifer:** Vocative case. The one being addressed, the \"light-bringer\" or morning star.\n*   **almum:** Accusative singular of `almus` (nurturing, kind), modifying `diem`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Exclude the Prohibited Devices**\nThe question asks to find a device *other than* apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and hyperbaton. It is crucial to confirm these are present first to ensure we do not select them.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses an inanimate object (the star Lucifer) as if it were a person capable of understanding and obeying commands (`Nascere`, `age`). This is present.\n*   **Sound Effects (Alliteration, Assonance, Consonance):** There is assonance in `age` and `almum` (repetition of the 'a' sound). This is present.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional separation of words that belong together. Here, the adjective `almum` (nurturing) is separated from its noun `diem` (day) by the verb `age` and the vocative `Lucifer`. The natural order would be `diem almum`. This is present.\n\n**Step 3: Search for Additional Poetic Devices**\nNow we must look for a device that is not on the excluded list. We should analyze the meaning and word choice in the line.\n*   The line begins with the command `Nascere` (\"Be born!\").\n*   It continues with the phrase `veniens prae diem` (\"coming before the day\").\n*   For the morning star, the act of \"being born\" (`nascere`) in the sky is functionally the same event as \"coming before the day\" (`veniens prae diem`). The star's appearance is its birth.\n*   Vergil is therefore using two different words/phrases (`nascere` and `veniens`) to describe the same action. This is a form of semantic redundancy.\n\n**Step 4: Name the Identified Device**\nThe use of more words than are grammatically or semantically necessary to express an idea, often for the sake of emphasis, is a rhetorical device known as **pleonasm**. By commanding Lucifer to both \"be born\" and \"come forth,\" Vergil emphatically repeats the call for the dawn to arrive. This repetition adds weight and urgency to the command.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAfter excluding apostrophe, sound effects, and hyperbaton, a clear poetic device present in the line is pleonasm, seen in the redundant use of `nascere` and `veniens` to describe the single action of the morning star's appearance.\n\n<<<Pleonasm>>>"
