    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question to identify key clues.**\nThe question asks for the name of a physicist with several specific attributes:\n*   He is a physicist.\n*   He is \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\" This could mean he invented types of microscopes or techniques used in microscopy.\n*   He discovered an \"optical effect in real imagery.\" Real images are formed by the actual convergence of light rays, such as those from a concave mirror or a converging lens.\n*   The discovery was prompted by an \"accidental observation by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\" This is a very specific and unique detail that is key to identifying the person.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the most distinctive clue.**\nThe story about a custodial worker's accidental observation is the most unique part of the question. Such a specific anecdote is likely to be associated with only one famous discovery. Searching for this story directly is the most efficient approach. The story describes how observing a mirror being wiped revealed imperfections in its surface, leading to a new method of testing optics.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the anecdote to a specific physicist and discovery.**\nThis story is famously associated with the French physicist **Léon Foucault**. While cleaning a concave mirror in Foucault's laboratory, a worker's hand or cleaning cloth passed through the light path. Foucault observed that this highlighted the surface errors on the mirror with great sensitivity. This observation led him to develop the **Foucault knife-edge test** in 1858.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the other clues against the identified physicist, Léon Foucault.**\n*   **Physicist?** Yes, Léon Foucault (1819-1868) was a prominent French physicist.\n*   **Optical effect in real imagery?** The Foucault knife-edge test is precisely this. A point source of light is reflected by the concave mirror, forming a real image. A knife-edge is brought into this focal point. An observer looking at the mirror from behind the knife-edge will see a pattern of light and shadow across the mirror's surface. This pattern is a highly magnified map of the slope errors on the surface, making it an extremely sensitive method for quality control of optical components.\n*   **Better known for work in the microscopy field?** While Foucault is most famous to the general public for the Foucault pendulum (demonstrating the Earth's rotation) and for accurately measuring the speed of light, his contributions to the field of optics are foundational. The Foucault knife-edge test is essential for creating the high-precision mirrors used in both reflecting telescopes and reflecting microscopes. He also invented the Foucault polarizer and a polarizing microscope. Therefore, his work is critically important to the broader field of microscopy and precision optical instruments.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the analysis to form a final answer.**\nAll clues point conclusively to Léon Foucault. The specific anecdote about the custodial worker, the nature of the optical test involving real imagery from a concave mirror, and his significant contributions to the field of practical optics (which underpins microscopy) all match his profile and a key discovery he made.\n\n<<<Léon Foucault>>>"
