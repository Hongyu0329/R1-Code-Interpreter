    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of members of the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs (miRNAs) that have been identified in humans to date.\n\n**Step 2: Define the \"let-7 Family\"**\nThe let-7 family is a group of miRNAs that are highly conserved across species. They are characterized by sharing a similar \"seed sequence\"â€”a short, specific nucleotide sequence (typically positions 2-8 of the miRNA) that is critical for binding to target messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. All members of the let-7 family share this conserved seed sequence, leading them to regulate a similar set of target genes.\n\n**Step 3: Clarify What Constitutes a \"Member\"**\nThis is a crucial point. In miRNA biology, there's a distinction between:\n*   **Precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs):** These are the hairpin-loop RNA structures from which mature miRNAs are processed. A single type of mature miRNA can be encoded by multiple different precursor genes located at different positions in the genome.\n*   **Mature miRNAs:** These are the final, short (~22 nucleotide) functional molecules. They are the active \"members\" that perform the gene silencing.\n\nThe question \"how many members\" almost always refers to the number of distinct **mature miRNA types** in the family, not the number of genes that encode them.\n\n**Step 4: List the Known Human let-7 Family Members**\nBased on the primary miRNA database, miRBase, and established scientific literature, the human let-7 family consists of a set of miRNAs named with a letter suffix. We can list them out:\n\n1.  `let-7a`\n2.  `let-7b`\n3.  `let-7c`\n4.  `let-7d`\n5.  `let-7e`\n6.  `let-7f`\n7.  `let-7g`\n8.  `let-7i` (Note: There is no `let-7h` or `let-7j` in humans)\n\n**Step 5: Include Other miRNAs Belonging to the Family**\nIn addition to the miRNAs explicitly named \"let-7,\" another miRNA, `miR-98`, shares the same seed sequence and is considered a bona fide member of the let-7 family.\n\n9.  `miR-98`\n\n**Step 6: Count the Total Members**\nBy counting the distinct mature miRNA types listed in Steps 4 and 5, we arrive at the total number of members in the family.\n(let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i) + (miR-98) = 8 + 1 = 9 members.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Mature Members vs. Precursor Genes:** It is important not to confuse the 9 mature members with the number of genes that encode them. Several let-7 members are encoded by more than one gene. For instance, the mature `let-7a` miRNA is produced from three different genes (`let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, `let-7a-3`). In total, the 9 mature let-7 family members are encoded by 12 different precursor genes in the human genome. The question asks for \"members,\" which points to the functionally distinct mature molecules.\n2.  **-5p and -3p Variants:** Each precursor hairpin can produce two mature miRNAs, one from the 5' arm (e.g., `hsa-let-7a-5p`) and one from the 3' arm (e.g., `hsa-let-7a-3p`). Typically, one strand (usually the -5p for let-7) is far more abundant and is considered the primary functional product. When we say \"let-7a,\" we are implicitly referring to the main functional molecule, `hsa-let-7a-5p`. The count of 9 refers to these primary family members.\n3.  **Nomenclature:** The absence of `let-7h` is a common point of confusion. This name is not used for any canonical human miRNA in the family.\n\nBy following this analysis, we conclude that there are 9 distinct mature members of the let-7 family in humans.\n\n<<<9>>>"
