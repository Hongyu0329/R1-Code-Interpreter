    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for the requested calculation.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)\n\nThe molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. We need to sum the number of electrons for each atom, which is given by its atomic number (Z).\n*   Carbon (C): Z = 6, so 6 electrons.\n*   Hydrogen (H): Z = 1. There are 3 hydrogen atoms, so 3 x 1 = 3 electrons.\n*   Silicon (Si): Z = 14, so 14 electrons.\n*   Fluorine (F): Z = 9, so 9 electrons.\n\nThe total number of electrons is:\nN = 6 (for C) + 3 (for 3H) + 14 (for Si) + 9 (for F) = 32 electrons.\n\nFor a typical neutral, closed-shell molecule, the ground state is a singlet state, meaning the total spin quantum number S = 0. For a singlet state, the number of alpha-spin electrons ($N_\\alpha$) is equal to the number of beta-spin electrons ($N_\\beta$).\n$N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (K)\n\nThe basis set is 6-31G**. This is a Pople-style split-valence basis set with polarization functions on both heavy atoms and hydrogen.\n*   The `6-31G` part describes the core and valence atomic orbitals.\n*   The first `*` (equivalent to `d`) adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n*   The second `*` (equivalent to `p`) adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n\nIn standard computational chemistry practice, Pople basis sets use 6 Cartesian d-functions ($d_{xx}, d_{yy}, d_{zz}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$) and 3 Cartesian p-functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n\nLet's count the number of basis functions for each atom:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   6-31G: 2 s-type functions (1s, 1s').\n    *   `**` (p-functions): 3 p-type functions.\n    *   Total for H = 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (First-row heavy atoms):**\n    *   6-31G: 1 core function (1s) + 2 sets of valence functions (2s, 2p and 2s', 2p'). This totals 1 + (1s + 3p) + (1s + 3p) = 9 functions.\n    *   `**` (d-functions): 6 d-type functions.\n    *   Total for C or F = 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si) (Second-row heavy atom):**\n    *   6-31G: Core functions (1s, 2s, 2p) + 2 sets of valence functions (3s, 3p and 3s', 3p'). This totals (1s + 1s + 3p) + (1s + 3p) + (1s + 3p) = 5 + 4 + 4 = 13 functions.\n    *   `**` (d-functions): 6 d-type functions.\n    *   Total for Si = 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\nNow, we sum the basis functions for all atoms in $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ (1 C, 3 H, 1 Si, 1 F):\nK = (1 * #BFs for C) + (3 * #BFs for H) + (1 * #BFs for Si) + (1 * #BFs for F)\nK = (1 * 15) + (3 * 5) + (1 * 19) + (1 * 15)\nK = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64 basis functions.\n\nSo, the full CI calculation will be performed with N=32 electrons in K=64 spatial orbitals.\n\n### Step 3: Use the formula for the number of CSFs\n\nFor a full CI calculation, the number of singlet (S=0) CSFs for N electrons in K orbitals is given by the formula:\n\n$N_{CSF} (S=0) = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2 - 1}\\binom{K}{N/2 + 1}$\n\nPlugging in our values K = 64 and N = 32 (so N/2 = 16):\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15}\\binom{64}{17}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the final number\n\nWe need to compute the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16! \\cdot 48!} = 333,331,156,240$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15! \\cdot 49!} = 108,924,867,424$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17! \\cdot 47!} = 941,170,335,280$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16}^2 = (333,331,156,240)^2 = 111,109,659,186,812,133,337,600$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} \\times \\binom{64}{17} = (108,924,867,424) \\times (941,170,335,280) = 102,519,571,424,561,152,519,680$\n\nFinally, calculate the difference:\n$N_{CSF} = 111,109,659,186,812,133,337,600 - 102,519,571,424,561,152,519,680$\n$N_{CSF} = 8,590,087,762,250,980,817,920$\n\nThis is the total number of singlet CSFs for a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n<<<8590087762250980817920>>>"
