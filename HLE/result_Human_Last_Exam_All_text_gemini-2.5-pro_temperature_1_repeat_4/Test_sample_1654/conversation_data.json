    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat in Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon.\"\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Question and the Symbolism**\n\nThe question asks for the number of times Chekhov describes Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat. The prompt correctly notes that these descriptions are not merely physical but symbolic, representing his shifting attitude, servility towards the powerful, and abuse of authority towards the weak. The key actions are putting the coat on (to assume an air of official severity) and taking it off (to appear more lenient or to show deference).\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the \"Descriptions\" in the Story**\n\nWe need to read through the story and count every instance where the coat is mentioned in a way that reflects Otchumyelov's state of mind. This includes the initial description and the final action, as well as the famous on-and-off sequence.\n\n### **Step 3: Chronological Analysis of the Coat Descriptions**\n\n1.  **Initial Description:** The story opens by establishing Otchumyelov's official status, symbolized by his coat.\n    *   **Instance 1:** \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square. He is wearing a **new greatcoat** and with a parcel under his arm.\" This sets the baseline of his authority.\n\n2.  **First Shift:** When Hryukin, the victim, suggests the dog might belong to the powerful General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov immediately changes his tone from severe to concerned. His physical reaction involves the coat.\n    *   **Instance 2:** \"**Help me off with my coat**, Yeldyrin.... It's frightfully hot!\" He literally sheds his official severity to appease a potentially powerful figure.\n\n3.  **Second Shift:** A moment later, someone in the crowd states that the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov's authority returns instantly.\n    *   **Instance 3:** \"**Put my coat on**, brother Yeldyrin.... There's a wind getting up.... I am cold.\" He puts his authority back on to deal with what he now perceives as a commoner's stray dog.\n\n4.  **Third Shift:** The policeman Yeldyrin speculates that the dog might still be the General's, as he has seen one like it near the General's property. Otchumyelov's attitude softens again.\n    *   **Instance 4:** \"**Take my coat off**, Yeldyrin...\" Again, he removes the symbol of his severity when faced with the possibility of offending the powerful.\n\n5.  **Fourth Shift:** The General's cook, Prokhor, arrives and states definitively that the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov becomes stern once more.\n    *   **Instance 5:** \"**Put on my coat**, brother Yeldyrin; I feel the wind.... I am chilly.\" He re-dons his authoritative mantle to pass judgment.\n\n6.  **Final Description:** Just as he is about to resolve the matter, Prokhor clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's *brother*. Otchumyelov's face breaks into a smile. As he leaves, his final action with the coat signifies a retreat into his official, yet now unsettled, persona.\n    *   **Instance 6:** \"**Wrapping himself in his greatcoat**, he goes on his way through the market-place.\" This final description shows him enclosing himself once more within his symbol of authority after the confusing incident.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Count and Conclusion**\n\nBy counting each distinct moment where Chekhov uses the coat to symbolize a change in Otchumyelov's mentality or to define his character, we find there are six specific descriptions. These include the initial setup, the four central shifts of putting it on and taking it off, and the final symbolic gesture.\n\nTherefore, Chekhov described the coat 6 times to symbolize the shifts in Otchumyelov's mentality.\n\n<<<6>>>"
