    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge\n\nThe problem provides a vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` defined in 3D space `(x, y, z)`. Let's analyze its structure.\nThe vector components are:\n`nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`\n`ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`\n`nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis is the parameterization of a unit vector on a 2-sphere `S^2` using spherical coordinates, where `G` is the polar angle (angle from the z-axis) and `f` is the azimuthal angle.\n\nThe angles `G` and `f` are defined as functions of the Cartesian coordinates `(x,y,z)`:\n1.  `f = atan2(y, x)`: This is the standard azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates `(rho, f, z)`, where `rho = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`. This means that as one physically moves in a circle around the z-axis, the vector `n` also rotates azimuthally by the same angle.\n2.  `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`, where `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`. The polar angle `G` depends only on `rho = sqrt(x^2+y^2)` and `z`.\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological invariant that classifies maps from the 3-sphere `S^3` to the 2-sphere `S^2`. Our vector field `n(x,y,z)` is a map from `R^3` to `S^2`. To apply the concept of the Hopf charge, we must be able to extend this map to `S^3`. We do this by considering the one-point compactification of `R^3`, which is topologically equivalent to `S^3`. This requires the vector field `n` to approach a constant value as the distance from the origin `sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)` goes to infinity.\n\nLet's check the limit at infinity:\nAs `(x,y,z) -> infinity`, `rho` or `|z|` goes to infinity.\nThis causes `r2 = sqrt((rho^2-0.5)^2 + z^2)` to go to infinity.\nThen, `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)` approaches `PI * exp(-infinity)`, which is `0`.\nAs `G -> 0`:\n`nx -> sin(0)*cos(f) = 0`\n`ny -> sin(0)*sin(f) = 0`\n`nz -> cos(0) = 1`\nSo, at infinity, the vector field `n` approaches the constant vector `(0, 0, 1)` (the \"north pole\" of `S^2`). This means the map can be extended to `n: S^3 -> S^2`, and its Hopf charge is well-defined.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Linking Number Definition of the Hopf Charge\n\nThe Whitehead formula for the Hopf charge `H` states that it is equal to the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular points on the target sphere `S^2`.\n`H = Lk(n⁻¹(p₁), n⁻¹(p₂))` for `p₁, p₂ ∈ S²`.\n\nLet's choose two convenient points on `S^2`: the south pole and a point on the equator.\n\n**Point 1: The South Pole `p_S = (0, 0, -1)`**\nThe vector `n` points to the south pole when `nz = -1`, which means `cos(G) = -1`. This occurs when `G = PI`.\nFrom the definition of `G`, we have:\n`PI = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`\n`1 = exp(-10 * r2)`\nThis implies `-10 * r2 = 0`, so `r2 = 0`.\nFrom the definition of `r2`:\n`r2^2 = (x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = 0`\nFor this sum of squares to be zero, both terms must be zero:\n1.  `z^2 = 0  =>  z = 0`\n2.  `(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 = 0  =>  x^2+y^2 = 0.5`\nThe preimage of the south pole, `C_S = n⁻¹(p_S)`, is a circle in the `z=0` plane with radius `sqrt(0.5)` centered at the origin.\n\n**Point 2: A point on the equator, `p_E = (1, 0, 0)`**\nThe vector `n` points to `(1, 0, 0)` when:\n1.  `nz = cos(G) = 0  =>  G = PI/2`\n2.  `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 1*cos(f) = 1  =>  cos(f) = 1`\n3.  `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 1*sin(f) = 0  =>  sin(f) = 0`\n`cos(f)=1` and `sin(f)=0` together imply that the azimuthal angle `f = 0`. Geometrically, this corresponds to the half-plane where `y=0` and `x>0`.\n\nNow we use the condition `G = PI/2`:\n`PI/2 = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`\n`1/2 = exp(-10 * r2)`\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/2) = -10 * r2  =>  -ln(2) = -10 * r2`\n`r2 = ln(2) / 10`\nSquaring both sides: `r2^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`.\nSubstituting the definition of `r2` and the condition `y=0`:\n`(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`\nThis equation describes a curve in the `y=0, x>0` half-plane. Since the right side is a positive constant, this curve is a closed loop. Let's call this loop `C_E = n⁻¹(p_E)`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Linking Number of the Two Preimages\n\nWe need to find the linking number `H = Lk(C_S, C_E)`.\n*   `C_S` is the circle `x^2+y^2=0.5` in the `z=0` plane.\n*   `C_E` is the loop `(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2` in the `y=0, x>0` half-plane.\n\nThe linking number can be found by counting the signed intersections of one curve with a surface bounded by the other curve.\nLet `S_E` be the disk-like surface in the `y=0, x>0` half-plane whose boundary is the curve `C_E`.\nWe need to count how many times the circle `C_S` pierces the surface `S_E`.\n\nThe circle `C_S` intersects the plane `y=0` at two points: `x = +/- sqrt(0.5), y=0, z=0`.\nSince the surface `S_E` exists only where `x>0`, we are only interested in the intersection point `P = (sqrt(0.5), 0, 0)`.\n\nNow, we check if this point `P` lies on, inside, or outside the boundary loop `C_E`. We test the point `P` in the equation for `C_E`:\nLHS = `(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = ((sqrt(0.5))^2 - 0.5)^2 + 0^2 = (0.5 - 0.5)^2 = 0`.\nRHS = `(ln(2)/10)^2`, which is a small positive number.\nSince `0 < (ln(2)/10)^2`, the point `P` lies strictly inside the loop `C_E`.\n\nThis means the circle `C_S` pierces the surface `S_E` exactly once. The magnitude of the linking number is therefore 1. The sign is determined by the orientations of the curves, which are induced by the map `n`. For this standard construction of a hopfion, the sign is positive.\n\nTherefore, the linking number is 1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages, which we calculated to be 1. This can also be confirmed by another method where the Hopf charge is the product of the winding numbers of the map in the azimuthal and poloidal directions. The azimuthal winding number is 1 (from `f->f`), and the poloidal winding number is also 1 (as `G` sweeps the full range from `PI` to `0`), giving `H = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\n<<<1>>>"
