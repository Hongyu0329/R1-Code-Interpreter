    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function Z for the given system using path integrals.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Grand Canonical Ensemble and the Partition Function**\n\nThe grand canonical ensemble describes an open system that can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir at a fixed temperature T and chemical potential μ. The grand canonical partition function, Z, is the fundamental quantity from which all thermodynamic properties can be derived.\n\nIn the operator formalism, Z is defined as:\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu\\hat{N})} \\right]$\nwhere:\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature ($k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant).\n*   $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the system's Hamiltonian operator.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   $\\text{Tr}$ denotes the trace over all states in the Fock space.\n\nThe operator $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu\\hat{N}$ is often called the grand canonical Hamiltonian.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Given Hamiltonian**\n\nThe question specifies the Hamiltonian as $\\hat{H} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$. There are two ways to interpret this:\n1.  $\\hat{H}_{sys} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$. This would make the grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}} = (-\\mu\\hat{N}) - \\mu\\hat{N} = -2\\mu\\hat{N}$.\n2.  The provided Hamiltonian is already the grand canonical Hamiltonian, i.e., $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$. This implies that the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ (containing kinetic and potential energy terms) is zero.\n\nThe second interpretation is more common for such simplified problems and leads to a more standard form. It describes a system of non-interacting particles where their single-particle energy levels, $\\epsilon_k$, are all zero. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\nSo, the operator inside the trace is $e^{-\\beta \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}} = e^{-\\beta(-\\mu\\hat{N})} = e^{\\beta\\mu\\hat{N}}$.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Partition Function as a Path Integral**\n\nThe path integral representation of the partition function is given by:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\nwhere $S_E$ is the Euclidean action and the integral is over all field configurations $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ in imaginary time $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta]$. The fields $\\psi$ can be complex numbers (for bosons) or Grassmann numbers (for fermions).\n\nThe Euclidean action corresponding to the grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}} = \\sum_k (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$ is:\n$S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\psi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\n\nFor our system, the single-particle energies are $\\epsilon_k=0$. Thus, the action simplifies to:\n$S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\psi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\n\nThe total partition function factorizes into a product of partition functions for each independent mode (or single-particle state) $k$:\n$Z = \\prod_k Z_k$\n\nWe now need to compute $Z_k$ for a single mode, which depends on the statistics of the particles (bosons or fermions).\n\n**Step 4: Case 1 - The System consists of Bosons**\n\n*   **Formalism**: For bosons, the fields $\\psi_k$ are ordinary complex-valued functions, and they must satisfy periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time: $\\psi_k(\\beta) = \\psi_k(0)$.\n*   **Path Integral as a Determinant**: The path integral is Gaussian, and its result is given by the inverse of the determinant of the operator in the action:\n    $Z_k = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi_k^*, \\psi_k] e^{-\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\psi_k^*(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)\\psi_k} = [\\text{det}(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{-1}$\n*   **Calculation**: The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues of the operator. For periodic boundary conditions, the eigenfunctions of $\\partial_\\tau$ are $e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau}$ with eigenvalues $-i\\omega_n$, where $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n / \\beta$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies ($n$ is an integer). The eigenvalues of the operator $(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$ are therefore $(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$.\n    Using the standard result for such determinants in quantum field theory (obtained by summing over Matsubara frequencies):\n    $\\ln Z_k = -\\text{Tr} \\ln(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) = -\\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu) = -\\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n    Therefore, the partition function for a single bosonic mode is:\n    $Z_k = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$\n*   **Physical Condition**: This result is valid only if the geometric series converges, which requires $|e^{\\beta\\mu}| < 1$. Since $\\beta > 0$, this means the chemical potential must be negative, $\\mu < 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Case 2 - The System consists of Fermions**\n\n*   **Formalism**: For fermions, the fields $\\psi_k$ are anti-commuting Grassmann numbers, and they must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time: $\\psi_k(\\beta) = -\\psi_k(0)$.\n*   **Path Integral as a Determinant**: The Gaussian integral over Grassmann variables gives the determinant of the operator (not its inverse):\n    $Z_k = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi_k^*, \\psi_k] e^{-\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\psi_k^*(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)\\psi_k} = \\text{det}(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$\n*   **Calculation**: For anti-periodic boundary conditions, the eigenvalues of $\\partial_\\tau$ are $-i\\omega_n$, where $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi / \\beta$ are the fermionic Matsubara frequencies ($n$ is an integer). The eigenvalues of $(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$ are again $(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$.\n    Using the standard result for fermionic determinants:\n    $\\ln Z_k = \\text{Tr} \\ln(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) = \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu) = \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n    Therefore, the partition function for a single fermionic mode is:\n    $Z_k = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$\n*   **Physical Condition**: This result is valid for any value of the chemical potential $\\mu$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function Z is the product of the single-mode partition functions over all available single-particle states, indexed by $k$. The final expression depends on whether the particles in the system are bosons or fermions.\n\n**For a system of bosons:**\nThe partition function Z is given by:\n$Z = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$\nThis is valid for a chemical potential $\\mu < 0$.\n\n**For a system of fermions:**\nThe partition function Z is given by:\n$Z = \\prod_k (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n\nSince the question does not specify the particle statistics, both results are valid answers.\n\n<<<For bosons: $Z = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ and the product is over all single-particle modes $k$. This requires $\\mu < 0$.\nFor fermions: $Z = \\prod_k (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$.>>>"
