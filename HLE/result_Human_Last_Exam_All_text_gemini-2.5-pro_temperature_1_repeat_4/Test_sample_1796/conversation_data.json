    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the sentence and the target word.**\n    The sentence is: \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\n    The target word is the first word: \"Fat\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the function of the target word in the sentence.**\n    The word \"Fat\" comes directly before the word \"people\".\n    The word \"people\" is a noun (it refers to a group of persons).\n    The word \"Fat\" is describing the noun \"people\". It answers the question \"What kind of people?\".\n\n3.  **Define the relevant parts of speech.**\n    *   **Noun:** A word for a person, place, thing, or idea (e.g., dog, city, happiness).\n    *   **Verb:** A word that expresses action or a state of being (e.g., run, is, think).\n    *   **Adjective:** A word that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun (e.g., `big` dog, `happy` person).\n    *   **Adverb:** A word that modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb (e.g., run `quickly`, `very` big).\n    *   **Conjunction:** A word used to connect clauses or sentences or to coordinate words in the same clause (e.g., and, but, if).\n\n4.  **Determine the part of speech based on the word's function.**\n    Since \"Fat\" is describing the noun \"people\", it is functioning as an adjective in this sentence.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Context is crucial.** The word \"fat\" can be a noun in other sentences (e.g., \"He trimmed the `fat` from the meat.\"). However, in this specific sentence, its role is to modify \"people\".\n*   **Ignore grammatical errors.** The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is grammatically incorrect. The subject (\"Fat people\") is plural, while the second verb (\"accumulates\") is singular. This error does not change the part of speech of the first word, \"Fat\", which is determined by its relationship with the word \"people\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the word \"Fat\" modifies the noun \"people\", which makes it an adjective.\n\n<<<C>>>"
