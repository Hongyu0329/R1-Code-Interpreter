    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Question Step-by-Step**\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This means the board wraps around on its edges. For a square at coordinates (r, c) where r is the row and c is the column (from 0 to 4), moving past column 4 brings you to column 0, and moving past row 4 brings you to row 0 (and vice-versa). All arithmetic on coordinates is performed modulo 5.\n*   **Pieces:** 4 Queens.\n*   **Constraint:** The queens must be \"non-attacking\". On a toroidal board, a queen at (r, c) attacks any square (r', c') if:\n    1.  `r' = r` (same row)\n    2.  `c' = c` (same column)\n    3.  `r' - c' ≡ r - c (mod 5)` (same main diagonal)\n    4.  `r' + c' ≡ r + c (mod 5)` (same anti-diagonal)\n*   **Goal:** Find the total number of ways to place the 4 queens on the 25 squares of the board according to these rules.\n\n### **2. List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Toroidal Attacks:** The diagonal attacks are the most complex part. A single main diagonal can consist of squares like (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). An anti-diagonal can consist of squares like (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0). A queen at (0,1) attacks the main diagonal defined by `r-c ≡ -1 (mod 5)`, which includes (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,0).\n*   **Distinct Configurations:** The question asks for the total number of ways, not the number of fundamentally different solutions under symmetry. Every unique set of 4 coordinates that satisfies the non-attacking condition is counted as one way.\n*   **Row and Column Occupancy:** To be non-attacking, no two queens can share a row or a column. Since we are placing 4 queens on a 5x5 board, this means they must occupy 4 different rows and 4 different columns. This leaves exactly one empty row and one empty column.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Derivation of the Final Answer**\n\nThe problem can be solved by breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts.\n\n**Step 1: Choose the Rows and Columns**\nA valid configuration of 4 queens must use 4 distinct rows and 4 distinct columns. We can start by choosing which 4 rows and which 4 columns will contain the queens.\n*   Number of ways to choose 4 rows out of 5: `C(5, 4) = 5`.\n*   Number of ways to choose 4 columns out of 5: `C(5, 4) = 5`.\nThis gives a total of `5 * 5 = 25` possible \"4x4 sub-boards\" on which the queens can be placed. Each sub-board is defined by the one row and one column that are left empty.\n\n**Step 2: Show all Sub-problems are Equivalent**\nLet's consider if the number of valid placements is the same regardless of which 4 rows and 4 columns we choose. We can show that any sub-problem (defined by a choice of 4 rows `R` and 4 columns `C`) is equivalent to any other sub-problem `(R', C')` via a simple coordinate shift (a translation on the torus). This transformation preserves the non-attacking property. Therefore, the number of solutions, let's call it `N`, is the same for all 25 sub-boards. The total number of solutions will then be `25 * N`.\n\n**Step 3: Solve for a Single Sub-problem**\nLet's calculate `N` for a specific sub-board. For simplicity, we choose rows `R = {0, 1, 2, 3}` and columns `C = {0, 1, 2, 3}`. We need to place 4 queens, one in each chosen row and column. This can be represented by a permutation `p` of the columns `{0, 1, 2, 3}`. The queen positions will be `(0, p(0)), (1, p(1)), (2, p(2)), (3, p(3))`.\n\nThe row and column conditions are already satisfied by this setup. We only need to check the two diagonal conditions:\n1.  **Main Diagonal:** For any two queens at `(i, p(i))` and `(j, p(j))`, we must have `i - p(i) <binary data, 3 bytes> j - p(j) (mod 5)`. This means the four values `0-p(0), 1-p(1), 2-p(2), 3-p(3)` must all be distinct modulo 5.\n2.  **Anti-Diagonal:** Similarly, `i + p(i) <binary data, 3 bytes> j + p(j) (mod 5)`. This means the four values `0+p(0), 1+p(1), 2+p(2), 3+p(3)` must all be distinct modulo 5.\n\n**Step 4: Enumerate and Check Permutations**\nThere are `4! = 24` permutations of `{0, 1, 2, 3}`. We must test each one.\n\nLet's test an example permutation `p = (1, 3, 0, 2)`.\n*   The queen positions are: `(0,1), (1,3), (2,0), (3,2)`.\n*   Main diagonal check (values of `r - c mod 5`):\n    *   `0 - 1 = -1 ≡ 4`\n    *   `1 - 3 = -2 ≡ 3`\n    *   `2 - 0 = 2`\n    *   `3 - 2 = 1`\n    The set of values is `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. They are all distinct. This condition is met.\n*   Anti-diagonal check (values of `r + c mod 5`):\n    *   `0 + 1 = 1`\n    *   `1 + 3 = 4`\n    *   `2 + 0 = 2`\n    *   `3 + 2 = 5 ≡ 0`\n    The set of values is `{0, 1, 2, 4}`. They are all distinct. This condition is also met.\n*   Conclusion: The permutation `p = (1, 3, 0, 2)` represents a valid placement.\n\nNow let's test another example `p = (0, 1, 2, 3)`.\n*   Main diagonal check: `0-0=0, 1-1=0, ...`. The values are not distinct. This is not a valid placement.\n\nBy systematically checking all 24 permutations, we find that there are exactly **two** valid permutations for this specific sub-board:\n1.  `p1 = (1, 3, 0, 2)` -> Solution: `{(0,1), (1,3), (2,0), (3,2)}`\n2.  `p2 = (2, 0, 3, 1)` -> Solution: `{(0,2), (1,0), (2,3), (3,1)}`\n\nSo, for our chosen sub-board, the number of solutions is `N = 2`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Total**\nAs established in Step 2, each of the 25 sub-boards has the same number of solutions, `N=2`.\nThe total number of ways is the number of sub-boards multiplied by the number of solutions per sub-board.\n\nTotal Ways = (Number of Sub-boards) × (Solutions per Sub-board)\nTotal Ways = `25 * 2 = 50`\n\nThere are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
