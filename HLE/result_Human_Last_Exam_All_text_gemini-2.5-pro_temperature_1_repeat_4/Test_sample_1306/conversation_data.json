    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Interpreting the Question:** The question asks for the percentage of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ that are irreducible, where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. A \"percentage\" implies a ratio of finite quantities. The full quantized universal enveloping algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ has infinitely many non-isomorphic finite-dimensional representations. Therefore, the question must refer to the \"small\" or \"restricted\" quantum group, often denoted $\\mathfrak{u}_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, which is obtained by adding the relations $E^\\ell=0, F^\\ell=0, K^\\ell=1$, where $\\ell$ is the order of $q$ as a root of unity. Here, $q$ is a primitive third root of unity, so $\\ell=3$. The algebra $\\mathfrak{u}_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is finite-dimensional and has a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n\n2.  **Classification of Simple (Irreducible) Modules:** For $\\mathfrak{u}_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with $\\ell=3$, the non-isomorphic simple modules (irreducible representations) are denoted by $L(d)$, where $d$ is the dimension. There are $\\ell=3$ such modules:\n    *   $L(1)$: The 1-dimensional trivial module.\n    *   $L(2)$: A 2-dimensional simple module.\n    *   $L(3)$: A 3-dimensional simple module.\n    So, there are a total of **3** non-isomorphic irreducible representations.\n\n3.  **Decomposition into Blocks:** The category of representations of $\\mathfrak{u}_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ decomposes into a direct sum of subcategories called blocks. The blocks are determined by the central characters (the values by which central elements act). The Casimir operator is a key central element.\n    *   The Casimir operator takes the same value on $L(1)$ and $L(2)$. Thus, $L(1)$ and $L(2)$ belong to the same block, called the principal block, denoted $\\mathcal{B}_0$.\n    *   The Casimir operator takes a different value on $L(3)$. Thus, $L(3)$ lies in a separate block, denoted $\\mathcal{B}_1$.\n    The set of all indecomposable modules is the union of the sets of indecomposable modules from each block.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Block $\\mathcal{B}_1$:**\n    *   The block $\\mathcal{B}_1$ contains only one simple module, $L(3)$.\n    *   A key result in the theory states that a simple module $L(d)$ for $\\mathfrak{u}_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is projective if and only if its dimension $d$ is a multiple of $\\ell$.\n    *   Here, $L(3)$ has dimension 3, and $\\ell=3$. So, $L(3)$ is a projective module.\n    *   A block containing a simple module that is also projective is a semisimple block. For a semisimple block with one simple object, the block algebra is a full matrix algebra (here, $\\text{Mat}_3(\\mathbb{C})$).\n    *   Such a category has only one non-isomorphic indecomposable object, which is the simple module itself.\n    *   Therefore, the block $\\mathcal{B}_1$ contributes **1** indecomposable module to our count, and this module, $L(3)$, is irreducible.\n\n5.  **Analysis of the Principal Block $\\mathcal{B}_0$:**\n    *   The principal block $\\mathcal{B}_0$ contains the simple modules $L(1)$ and $L(2)$.\n    *   This block is not semisimple and has a richer structure. It is known to be of finite representation type.\n    *   A standard result states that the number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules in the principal block of $\\mathfrak{u}_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is $\\ell(\\ell-1)$.\n    *   For $\\ell=3$, this number is $3 \\times (3-1) = 6$.\n    *   These 6 indecomposable modules consist of:\n        *   The two simple modules $L(1)$ and $L(2)$.\n        *   Their projective covers, $P(1)$ and $P(2)$, which are indecomposable but not irreducible.\n        *   Two other non-projective indecomposable modules, which are also not irreducible.\n    *   Thus, the principal block $\\mathcal{B}_0$ contributes **6** indecomposable modules, of which **2** are irreducible ($L(1)$ and $L(2)$).\n\n6.  **Total Count and Final Calculation:**\n    *   **Total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules:**\n        (from $\\mathcal{B}_0$) + (from $\\mathcal{B}_1$) = $6 + 1 = 7$.\n    *   **Total number of non-isomorphic irreducible modules:**\n        (from $\\mathcal{B}_0$) + (from $\\mathcal{B}_1$) = $2 + 1 = 3$.\n    *   **Percentage of irreducible objects:** The question asks for the percentage of the objects in the category $C$ (of indecomposable representations) that are irreducible. This is the ratio of the number of irreducible isomorphism classes to the total number of indecomposable isomorphism classes.\n        Percentage = $\\frac{\\text{Number of irreducible modules}}{\\text{Number of indecomposable modules}} \\times 100\\%$\n        Percentage = $\\frac{3}{7} \\times 100\\%$.\n\nThe fraction of objects that are irreducible is $3/7$.\n\n$3 \\div 7 \\approx 0.4285714$\n\nAs a percentage, this is approximately $42.86\\%$. The exact answer is the fraction $3/7$.\n\n<<<3/7>>>"
