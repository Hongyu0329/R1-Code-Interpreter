    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** The surname of an English poet.\n    *   **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay.\n    *   **Context:** The essay is describing the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   **Key Clue:** The surname \"appears\" in the description. This strongly suggests a pun or wordplay, where a Russian word used in the description contains the phonetic or literal spelling of the English surname.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Context: \"Wide boulevards of Vienna\"**\n    *   Vienna's wide boulevards, like the Ringstrasse, are famous for being grand and busy.\n    *   A description of such a place in an essay would likely include details about the architecture, the trees, the people, and the traffic.\n    *   The sounds of a bustling city are a common descriptive element. This includes the sound of vehicles.\n\n3.  **Explore the \"Russian Translation\" and Pun Angle:**\n    *   We are looking for a common Russian word, used to describe the scene, that sounds like an English poet's surname.\n    *   Let's consider the sounds of traffic. The sound a car horn makes, or the general hum of traffic, is a very plausible detail.\n    *   The Russian verb for \"to honk,\" \"to hoot,\" \"to buzz,\" or \"to hum\" is **гудеть** (gudet').\n    *   In a sentence describing the scene, a writer might say, \"Машины **гудят** на бульварах\" (Mashiny **gudyat** na bul'varakh), which means \"Cars are **honking/buzzing** on the boulevards.\"\n\n4.  **Connect the Russian Word to the English Poet:**\n    *   The root of the verb \"гудеть\" (gudet') and its conjugated form \"гудят\" (gudyat) is **гуд** (gud).\n    *   Now, we must find an English poet whose surname, when transliterated into Russian, is \"Гуд\".\n    *   The English surname **Hood** is transliterated into Russian as **Гуд**.\n    *   The poet in question is **Thomas Hood** (1799–1845), a well-known English poet and humorist.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Verify:**\n    *   An essay describing the wide boulevards of Vienna might mention the constant sound of traffic.\n    *   The Russian word for this sound is based on the root \"гуд\" (gud).\n    *   This root \"гуд\" is the direct Russian transliteration of the surname of the English poet Thomas **Hood**.\n    *   Therefore, in the Russian text, the poet's surname \"appears\" as part of a descriptive word. This perfectly matches all conditions of the puzzle.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The nature of the puzzle:** This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle that relies on a cross-linguistic pun, not a direct literary reference.\n*   **\"Surname appears\":** This phrasing is a major hint. It points away from a simple mention (\"The writer mentioned Hood\") or a thematic allusion (e.g., a melancholy tone reminiscent of a poet's work) and towards the literal or phonetic presence of the name within another word.\n*   **Plausibility:** The use of the word \"гудеть\" (to honk/buzz) is a very natural and plausible way to describe a busy urban boulevard, making the pun seamless and clever.\n*   **Poet's nationality:** The question specifies an *English* poet, and Thomas Hood fits this description.\n\nBy following this logical progression, we can confidently identify the surname.\n\n<<<Hood>>>"
