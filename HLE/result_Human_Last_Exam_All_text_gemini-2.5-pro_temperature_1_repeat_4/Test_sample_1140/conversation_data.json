    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the characteristics of the target molecule.**\nThe molecule is a peptide with two key features:\n1.  **Size:** It is 100 amino acids (aa) long. In the context of peptide synthesis, this is considered a large peptide or a small protein.\n2.  **Composition:** It contains an unnatural amino acid (Uaa), specifically azido phenylalanine (AzF), denoted by 'X'.\n\n**Step 2: List the careful points and constraints for synthesis.**\n*   The length (100 aa) poses a significant challenge for purely chemical synthesis methods.\n*   The presence of an unnatural amino acid (AzF) poses a significant challenge for standard biological synthesis methods.\n*   The goal is to find the *most helpful* technique, implying a need to balance feasibility, efficiency, and yield.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate common peptide synthesis techniques against these constraints.**\n\n*   **A) Standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):**\n    *   **How it works:** Amino acids are chemically coupled one by one to a growing chain attached to a solid support.\n    *   **Analysis:** SPPS has the advantage of being able to incorporate virtually any amino acid, including unnatural ones like AzF, as long as a protected building block is available. However, the efficiency of each coupling step is not 100%. For a 100 aa peptide, the cumulative loss of yield becomes enormous, resulting in an extremely small amount of the correct final product contaminated with many deletion sequences. Purification is exceptionally difficult.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Impractical due to the peptide's length.\n\n*   **B) Standard Recombinant Protein Expression (e.g., in *E. coli*):**\n    *   **How it works:** The gene for the peptide is inserted into a plasmid, which is then put into a host organism like *E. coli*. The cell's natural machinery (ribosomes) translates the gene into the peptide.\n    *   **Analysis:** This method is excellent for producing proteins of 100 aa or longer with high yields. However, the standard genetic code only has codons for the 20 canonical amino acids. There is no natural mechanism to incorporate AzF into a growing polypeptide chain.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not directly applicable due to the presence of the unnatural amino acid.\n\n*   **C) Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):**\n    *   **How it works:** This is a semi-synthetic method where smaller peptide fragments are synthesized separately and then chemically joined (ligated) together. It typically requires an N-terminal cysteine on one fragment and a C-terminal thioester on the other.\n    *   **Analysis:** This technique cleverly bypasses the length limitation of SPPS. One could synthesize a shorter fragment (~20-40 aa) containing the AzF using SPPS (where yield is manageable) and produce the remaining, longer fragment(s) via recombinant expression. The sequence contains a cysteine (`...KAVCLXV...`), which is a good candidate for a ligation site.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a viable and powerful strategy. However, it is a multi-step process involving multiple syntheses and purifications, followed by a final ligation and another purification step, which can be complex.\n\n*   **D) Genetic Code Expansion (via Amber Suppression):**\n    *   **How it works:** This is a sophisticated biological engineering technique. The host organism (e.g., *E. coli*) is engineered to recognize a specific codon—usually a stop codon like UAG (the \"amber\" codon)—as a signal to insert a specific unnatural amino acid. This requires introducing two new components: 1) an engineered tRNA synthetase that recognizes only the Uaa (AzF) and 2) its corresponding tRNA that reads the amber codon.\n    *   **Analysis:** This method combines the best of both worlds. It uses the highly efficient machinery of recombinant expression to synthesize the long 100 aa backbone, while the engineered components specifically insert the unnatural AzF at the desired position (which is coded by UAG in the gene). Systems for incorporating AzF via this method are well-established.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the most direct, elegant, and often highest-yielding method for producing a protein of this size with a site-specifically incorporated unnatural amino acid. It addresses both the length and composition challenges in a single, integrated *in vivo* process.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nComparing the options, Genetic Code Expansion is the \"most helpful\" technique because it is specifically designed to solve this exact problem—incorporating a Uaa into a recombinantly expressed protein—in a single, efficient process. While NCL is a possible alternative, it is generally more complex and labor-intensive than a well-optimized genetic code expansion system.\n\n<<<Genetic Code Expansion (using an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair, often via amber suppression)>>>"
