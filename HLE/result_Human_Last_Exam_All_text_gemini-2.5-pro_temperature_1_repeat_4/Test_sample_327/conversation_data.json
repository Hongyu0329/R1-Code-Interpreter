    "This problem asks for the number of game pieces required to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue-Hackenbush. We will use the standard canonical construction for dyadic rational numbers.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the form of the number.**\n    The number is $\\frac{13}{16}$. This is a positive dyadic rational number, which can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$.\n    *   The denominator is $16 = 2^4$, so we have $n=4$.\n    *   The numerator is $m=13$.\n    *   The fraction is in its simplest form, which will lead to the most efficient (canonical) representation.\n\n2.  **Understand the canonical construction for positive dyadic rationals.**\n    A positive number $x = \\frac{m}{2^n}$ is represented by a \"flower\" structure in Red-Blue-Hackenbush.\n    *   **The stalk:** This consists of $n$ blue edges stacked one on top of the other, starting from the ground. The number of blue pieces is therefore equal to $n$.\n    *   **The petals:** These are red edges attached to the nodes of the stalk. The number of red petals is determined by the binary representation of the numerator, $m$. A red edge is attached at a node for each '1' in the binary expansion of $m$.\n\n3.  **Count the number of blue pieces.**\n    The number of blue pieces is equal to $n$. Since $n=4$ for the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$, we need **4 blue pieces** for the stalk.\n\n4.  **Count the number of red pieces.**\n    The number of red pieces is equal to the number of '1's in the binary representation of the numerator, $m=13$. This is also known as the Hamming weight or population count.\n    *   First, we convert 13 to its binary form:\n        $13 = 8 + 4 + 1$\n        $13 = 1 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0$\n        So, the binary representation of 13 is $(1101)_2$.\n    *   Next, we count the number of '1's in $(1101)_2$. There are three '1's.\n    *   Therefore, we need **3 red pieces** for the petals.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of pieces.**\n    The total number of pieces is the sum of the blue pieces and the red pieces.\n    *   Total pieces = (Number of blue pieces) + (Number of red pieces)\n    *   Total pieces = $4 + 3 = 7$.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Irreducible Fraction:** Using the fraction in its simplest form $\\frac{13}{16}$ is key. Using an equivalent fraction like $\\frac{26}{32}$ would result in a different, less efficient game construction ($n=5, m=26=(11010)_2$, giving $5+3=8$ pieces) that has the same value but is not the canonical representation.\n*   **Positive vs. Negative:** The number is positive, so the stalk is blue and the petals are red. If the number were negative, the colors would be swapped (red stalk, blue petals), but the counting method and total number of pieces would remain the same.\n*   **Total Count:** The question asks for the total number of pieces, including both red and blue.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTo represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$, we need 4 blue pieces for the stalk and 3 red pieces for the petals. The total number of pieces required is $4 + 3 = 7$.\n\n<<<7>>>"
