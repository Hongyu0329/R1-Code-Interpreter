No. The mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics (based on Hilbert spaces, linear operators, and probability theory) and the logical formalism of Gödel's ontological proof (based on higher-order modal logic) are fundamentally incommensurable. Key concepts in Gödel's proof, such as "positive property" and "logical necessity," have no natural or non-arbitrary analogue within the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics. The former is a framework for describing the probabilistic behavior of physical systems, while the latter is a framework for exploring logical consequences from abstract axioms. Attempting to prove the conclusion of one within the system of the other constitutes a category error.
