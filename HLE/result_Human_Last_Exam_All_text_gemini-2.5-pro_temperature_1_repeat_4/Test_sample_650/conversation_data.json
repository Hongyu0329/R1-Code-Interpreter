    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Purpose:**\n    The algorithm takes two integers, `n` (a non-negative number) and `c` (a base, `c ≥ 2`), and computes the representation of `n` in base `c`. For example, `IMAG(42, 2)` would produce the binary representation `(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)`. The core idea is based on repeated integer division and finding the remainder.\n\n2.  **Break Down the Algorithm into Basic Steps:**\n    The algorithm consists of three main parts:\n    *   **Step 1: Initialization.** This part executes only once at the beginning.\n    *   **Step 2: The `while` loop.** This is the main computational part of the algorithm, which executes multiple times.\n    *   **Step 3: Return.** This part executes once at the end.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Cost of Each Part:**\n    We analyze the complexity by counting the number of basic operations (like assignment, arithmetic operations, comparisons). We assume the standard RAM model, where each of these basic operations takes constant time, denoted as `O(1)`.\n\n    *   **Cost of Step 1 (Initialization):**\n        `i := 0;` (1 assignment)\n        `x := n;` (1 assignment)\n        `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` (1 division, 1 assignment)\n        `a_{0} := x — qc;` (1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment)\n        The total number of operations in this step is a small, fixed constant. Therefore, the time complexity of Step 1 is `O(1)`.\n\n    *   **Cost of Step 3 (Return):**\n        `return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1} a_{0}))`\n        This step simply returns the computed result. Its cost is also constant, `O(1)`.\n\n    *   **Cost of Step 2 (The `while` loop):**\n        The total cost of the loop is the cost of a single iteration multiplied by the number of iterations.\n        *   **Cost of a single iteration:** Inside the `while` loop (Step 2.1), we have:\n            `i := i + 1;` (1 addition, 1 assignment)\n            `x := q;` (1 assignment)\n            `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` (1 division, 1 assignment)\n            `a_{i} := x — qc;` (1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment)\n            Similar to the initialization, the number of operations within one loop iteration is constant. So, the cost of a single iteration is `O(1)`.\n\n        *   **Number of iterations:** This is the most critical part of the analysis. The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. We need to determine how many times the value of `x` (and consequently `q`) can be divided by `c` before the quotient becomes 0.\n            Let's trace the value of `x` at the beginning of each iteration:\n            - Before the loop: `x = n`.\n            - After 1st iteration: `x` becomes `q_{initial} = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n            - After 2nd iteration: `x` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n            - After `k` iterations: `x` becomes `⌊n/c^k⌋`.\n            The loop terminates when the new quotient `q` becomes 0. The quotient calculated at the end of the `k`-th iteration is `⌊x_{new}/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c^k⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n            The loop stops when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`. This inequality holds when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, which is equivalent to `n < c^(k+1)`.\n            Taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides gives `log_c(n) < k+1`, or `k > log_c(n) - 1`.\n            The number of iterations `k` is roughly `log_c(n)`. More formally, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋` (for `n ≥ c`).\n            The number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in the base-c representation of `n`. Therefore, the number of iterations is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Costs to Find the Total Complexity:**\n    Total Time Complexity = (Cost of Step 1) + (Number of Iterations × Cost of one Iteration) + (Cost of Step 3)\n    Total Time Complexity = `O(1) + O(log_c(n)) × O(1) + O(1)`\n    Total Time Complexity = `O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(1)`\n    The dominant term is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n5.  **Final Simplification:**\n    In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm does not affect the asymptotic complexity, because `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c` is a constant `(c ≥ 2)`, `log(c)` is also a constant. Thus, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`. However, `O(log_c(n))` is a more precise description related to the problem's parameters.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Model of Computation:** The analysis assumes a RAM model where basic arithmetic operations on integers take constant `O(1)` time. If we were to consider bit complexity, where the cost of operations depends on the number of bits in the operands (`log n`), the complexity would be higher, typically `O((log n)²)`. For most standard algorithm analysis, the former assumption is used.\n*   **Base Cases:** For small values of `n` (e.g., `0 ≤ n < c`), the loop does not execute at all. The algorithm takes `O(1)` time. The `O(log_c(n))` complexity describes the behavior for large `n`, which is the focus of asymptotic analysis.\n*   **Input Constraints:** The constraints `n ≥ 0` and `c ≥ 2` are important. `c ≥ 2` ensures that `log_c(n)` is well-defined and positive for `n > 1`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The loop divides the input number `n` by the base `c` repeatedly until the result is zero. The number of such divisions is proportional to the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`. Since each iteration takes constant time, the total time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
