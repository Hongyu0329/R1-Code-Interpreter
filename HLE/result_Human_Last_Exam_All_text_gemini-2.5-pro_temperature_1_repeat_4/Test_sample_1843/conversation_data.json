    "Answering this question requires understanding the properties of Dirichlet characters, specifically their decomposition, primitivity, and order.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Factorize the Conductor N**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\n$N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$\n\n**2. Decomposition of Dirichlet Characters**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo $p^a$.\n\n**3. Condition for Primitivity**\n\nA character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is **primitive** if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ is primitive modulo $p^a$.\n\n**4. Condition for Order**\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$\nWe are given that this order must be 6.\n\n**5. Analyzing Each Component Character**\n\nFor the lcm to be 6, the order of each component character must be a divisor of 6. We need to find the number of **primitive** characters for each prime power factor $p^a$ whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo $4 = 2^2$**:\n    *   The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$.\n    *   There is one trivial character (conductor 1, order 1) and one non-trivial character (conductor 4, order 2).\n    *   For $\\chi_4$ to be primitive, it must be the non-trivial character of order 2.\n    *   Since $2|6$, this character is a valid choice.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1.\n\n*   **Modulo $9 = 3^2$**:\n    *   The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$.\n    *   A character mod 9 is primitive if it is not induced from a character mod 3. The characters induced from mod 3 have orders 1 and 2.\n    *   The primitive characters mod 9 are those with orders 3 and 6. In a cyclic group $C_m$, the number of elements of order $d$ is $\\phi(d)$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Both orders (3 and 6) divide 6.\n    *   Total number of choices for $\\chi_9$: $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Modulo $7$**:\n    *   The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$.\n    *   A character mod 7 is primitive if it's not the trivial character. So, the possible orders are 2, 3, and 6. All of these divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total number of choices for $\\chi_7$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Modulo $11$**:\n    *   The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$.\n    *   Primitive characters have orders that divide 10 and are greater than 1, i.e., 2, 5, 10.\n    *   We need the order to divide 6. The only common divisor is 2.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Total number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1.\n\n*   **Modulo $13$**:\n    *   The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$.\n    *   Primitive characters have orders that divide 12 and are greater than 1, i.e., 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n    *   We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n**6. Combining the Components and Verifying the Order**\n\nTo find the total number of characters, we multiply the number of choices for each component:\nTotal choices = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal choices = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must verify that all of these 100 characters indeed have an order of 6.\nLet $\\chi$ be any character constructed this way. Its order is $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\dots)$.\n*   Since every component character has an order that divides 6, their lcm must also divide 6. So $\\text{ord}(\\chi)$ can only be 1, 2, 3, or 6.\n*   The component $\\chi_4$ must be primitive, so its order is exactly 2. This means $\\text{ord}(\\chi)$ must be a multiple of 2.\n*   The component $\\chi_9$ must be primitive, so its order is 3 or 6. In either case, its order is a multiple of 3. This means $\\text{ord}(\\chi)$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\nA number that is a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3 must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nSince we already established that $\\text{ord}(\\chi)$ divides 6, the order must be exactly 6.\nTherefore, all 100 characters we constructed are primitive, have conductor $N$, and have order 6.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is the product of the number of valid choices for each prime power component:\nNumber = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
