    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific work in question:** The user asks about Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The official title of this paper is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This was one of his four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers.\n\n2.  **Examine the citations in the Brownian motion paper:** A well-known characteristic of Einstein's 1905 papers, particularly the ones on relativity and Brownian motion, is their striking lack of formal citations or references to other contemporary scientists. A direct review of the 1905 Brownian motion paper confirms that it contains no bibliography and no footnotes citing the work of others. Therefore, strictly speaking, Einstein did not cite anyone's lectures *in this specific paper*.\n\n3.  **Consider closely related works from the same year:** In 1905, Einstein also completed and submitted his doctoral dissertation to the University of Zurich. The title of his thesis was \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"). This work is thematically very close to the Brownian motion paper; both were part of Einstein's effort to provide evidence for the existence of atoms and to calculate their size and number (Avogadro's number).\n\n4.  **Examine the citations in the doctoral dissertation:** Unlike his journal paper, Einstein's doctoral dissertation was an academic requirement that included a bibliography. In the list of references for his thesis, Einstein *does* cite several works.\n\n5.  **Identify the specific citation of \"lectures\":** One of the key works Einstein cited in his dissertation's bibliography is:\n    *   **L. Boltzmann, *Vorlesungen über Gastheorie*, I. und II. Teil. Leipzig 1896 u. 1898.**\n\n    This translates to:\n    *   **L. Boltzmann, *Lectures on Gas Theory*, Parts I and II. Leipzig 1896 and 1898.**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Distinction between the paper and the thesis:** The question specifically mentions the \"paper on Brownian motion.\" It is a crucial point of historical accuracy that this paper itself contains no citations.\n*   **Likely intent of the question:** The question's specific mention of \"lectures\" and the year \"1905\" strongly suggests it is referring to the citation of Ludwig Boltzmann's \"Lectures on Gas Theory.\" It is highly probable that the question conflates the Brownian motion paper with the doctoral thesis, two distinct but closely related works that Einstein produced in the same year.\n*   **The identity of the person:** The person whose lectures were cited is the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**, a pioneer of statistical mechanics whose work provided a foundation for Einstein's own theories.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion famously lacks citations, his doctoral thesis, completed in the same year, does contain them. Given the specific wording of the question, it is almost certain that it is referring to the citation found in the thesis. The lectures cited were those of Ludwig Boltzmann on gas theory.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
