    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Type of Reaction\n\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene)**\n    *   Structure: CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂\n    *   Classification: It is a conjugated diene, containing a system of 4 π-electrons over four carbons. For the reaction to occur, it must adopt an *s-cis* conformation.\n\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**\n    *   Structure: CCl₂=CF₂\n    *   Classification: It is a substituted alkene (ethene), which acts as a dienophile (a \"diene-loving\" species). It contains 2 π-electrons.\n\n*   **Type of Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, where the 4 π-electrons of the diene and the 2 π-electrons of the dienophile react to form a six-membered ring.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Mechanism and Predict the Product's Connectivity\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted, pericyclic reaction. This means all bond-making and bond-breaking occurs in a single step through a cyclic transition state.\n*   Let's number the carbons of the reactants to track the bond formation:\n    *   Butadiene: C¹H₂=C²H−C³H=C⁴H₂\n    *   Dienophile: C⁵Cl₂=C⁶F₂\n*   The π-electrons rearrange to form two new sigma (σ) bonds and one new pi (π) bond:\n    1.  A new σ-bond forms between C¹ of the diene and C⁶ of the dienophile.\n    2.  A new σ-bond forms between C⁴ of the diene and C⁵ of the dienophile.\n    3.  The π-bond between C¹-C² and C³-C⁴ of the diene are broken, and a new π-bond is formed between C²-C³.\n    4.  The π-bond between C⁵-C⁶ of the dienophile is broken.\n*   The product is a six-membered ring, a derivative of cyclohexene. The atoms forming the ring are C¹-C²-C³-C⁴-C⁵-C⁶. The new double bond is between C² and C³. The substituents (Cl and F atoms) remain attached to their original carbons (C⁵ and C⁶).\n\n### Step 3: Consider Potential Isomers (Careful Points)\n\n*   **Regioselectivity:** This considers which end of an unsymmetrical diene adds to which end of an unsymmetrical dienophile.\n    *   In this case, the diene (1,3-butadiene) is **symmetrical**.\n    *   The dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) is **unsymmetrical**.\n    *   Because the diene is symmetrical, there is only **one possible regioisomeric product**. Whether C¹ attacks the CCl₂ carbon or the CF₂ carbon, the resulting molecule is identical (it can be superimposed on the other by flipping it over).\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained in the product.\n    *   The dienophile CCl₂=CF₂ has no *cis* or *trans* isomers.\n    *   The carbons of the dienophile in the product (C⁵ and C⁶) are not stereocenters because they each bear two identical substituents (two Cl atoms on one, two F atoms on the other).\n    *   Therefore, there are no stereoisomers to consider in this specific reaction.\n\n### Step 4: Draw the Final Product and Determine its IUPAC Name\n\n*   **Structure:** Based on the connectivity established in Step 2, the product is a cyclohexene ring where two adjacent saturated carbons are substituted with halogen atoms.\n\n    ```\n         CH=CH\n        /     \\\n      H₂C      CH₂\n       |        |\n      CF₂ ---- CCl₂\n    ```\n\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The parent hydrocarbon is **cyclohexene**.\n    2.  Number the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible locants, which will be C1 and C2.\n    3.  Number the remainder of the ring in the direction that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. Numbering clockwise or counter-clockwise from the double bond gives the substituents at positions 4 and 5. The locant set is {4,4,5,5}.\n    4.  When two different numbering schemes produce the same locant set, alphabetical order of the substituents is used to decide the numbering.\n    5.  The substituents are \"chloro\" and \"fluoro\". Alphabetically, \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\".\n    6.  Therefore, the carbon with the two chlorine atoms (CCl₂) is assigned the lower number, C4, and the carbon with the two fluorine atoms (CF₂) is assigned C5.\n    7.  The final name combines the locants, substituent names, and the parent name.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe product of the reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
