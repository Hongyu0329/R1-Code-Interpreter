    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a state feedback gain matrix F such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix, `A_cl = A + BF`, are located at the desired positions `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. System and Gain Matrices**\n*   Given state matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Given input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n*   The state vector `x` is 2x1, and the input vector `u` is 2x1. The feedback law is `u = -Fx`. Therefore, the gain matrix `F` must be a 2x2 matrix.\n*   Let `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\n\n**3. Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`.\nThe characteristic polynomial for these eigenvalues is:\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ - λ1)(λ - λ2)`\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`P_desired(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`P_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`P_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**4. Form the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A_cl`**\nThe closed-loop matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`.\nFirst, calculate `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\nNow, calculate `A_cl`:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**5. Actual Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system is `P_actual(λ) = det(λI - A_cl)`.\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ, 0], [0, λ]] - [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ + 1 - f1 - 2*f3, -1 - f2 - 2*f4], [-1 - f1, λ - f2]]`\n\n`det(λI - A_cl) = (λ + 1 - f1 - 2*f3)(λ - f2) - (-1 - f2 - 2*f4)(-1 - f1)`\nExpanding this expression gives a polynomial in terms of `f1, f2, f3, f4`. This results in two equations (from comparing coefficients) with four unknowns. This means the solution for F is not unique. This is typical for multi-input systems.\n\n**6. Simplify the Problem to Find a Solution**\nTo find one possible solution, we can introduce constraints. A common method is to set some elements of F to zero. Let's try to find a solution by setting the second row of F to zero, i.e., `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\nThis simplifies F to `F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`.\n\nNow, recalculate `A_cl` with this simplified `F`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [0, 0]] = [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]] = [[-1 + f1, 1 + f2], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial for this simplified `A_cl` is:\n`P_actual(λ) = det(λI - A_cl) = det([[λ - (-1 + f1), -(1 + f2)], [-(1 + f1), λ - f2]])`\n`P_actual(λ) = (λ + 1 - f1)(λ - f2) - (-(1 + f2))(-(1 + f1))`\n`P_actual(λ) = (λ^2 - f2λ + λ - f2 - f1λ + f1f2) - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1f2)`\n`P_actual(λ) = λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2)λ + (-f2 + f1f2 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1f2)`\n`P_actual(λ) = λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2f2)`\n\n**7. Equate Coefficients and Solve**\nNow, we equate the coefficients of `P_actual(λ)` with `P_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n\n*   **Coefficient of λ:**\n    `1 - f1 - f2 = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 = -1` (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Constant term:**\n    `-1 - f1 - 2f2 = 2`\n    `f1 + 2f2 = -3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns (`f1` and `f2`).\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(f1 + 2f2) - (f1 + f2) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` back into Equation 1:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\n**8. Final Answer**\nWe found `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, and we had set `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\nTherefore, one possible state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
