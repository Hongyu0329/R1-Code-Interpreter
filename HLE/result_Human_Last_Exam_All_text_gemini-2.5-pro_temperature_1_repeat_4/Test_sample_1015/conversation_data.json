    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Movement: Cambré Derrière**\n    *   A cambré is a bend of the body from the waist. \"Derrière\" means \"to the back.\" So, a cambré derrière is a backward bend.\n    *   The fundamental technique for a safe and effective cambré derrière in any ballet method involves lifting the chest and sternum towards the ceiling, initiating the bend from the upper back (thoracic spine), and keeping the hips stable and square over the supporting legs. The head follows the line of the spine.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach**\n    *   The Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova, is known for its precise, logical, and systematic approach.\n    *   In a Vaganova cambré derrière, the emphasis is on strength, control, and anatomical correctness. The bend is initiated by lifting the sternum, with a strong focus on keeping the lower back long and supported by the abdominal muscles.\n    *   The depth of the bend is progressive and dependent on the dancer's strength and flexibility. The goal is a beautiful, harmonious curve, but not at the expense of correct placement. The hips must remain firmly in place.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method's Approach**\n    *   The Balanchine method, or style, developed by George Balanchine, is characterized by speed, musicality, and a \"neoclassical\" aesthetic that often pushes classical lines to their extremes.\n    *   In a Balanchine-style cambré derrière, the aesthetic goal often prioritizes a more dramatic and extreme line. Dancers are encouraged to achieve a much deeper backbend.\n    *   This often results in a bend that goes beyond what is typical in the Vaganova syllabus, sometimes creating a \"broken\" look where the dancer bends back as far as physically possible, bringing the head much lower towards the floor. This requires extreme flexibility, particularly in the mid and lower back, in addition to the upper back.\n\n4.  **Compare the Two Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there can be subtle stylistic differences in the *port de bras* (carriage of the arms), the fundamental arm positions and the concept of *allongé* (stretching the line) exist in both. This is not the primary, defining difference.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** In both methods, the ideal is to keep the hips square and stable. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault in both styles as it destabilizes the base and strains the lower back. Therefore, this is a point of similarity in correct execution, not a difference.\n    *   **C. Speed:** A cambré is an *adagio* (slow) movement by nature, designed to develop strength, control, and flexibility. While Balanchine's style is generally faster, this specific movement is not defined by its speed in either method.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** This is the most significant and widely recognized difference. The Balanchine aesthetic calls for a more extreme and deeper backbend to create a dramatic visual line, whereas the Vaganova method emphasizes a more controlled bend that prioritizes spinal alignment and upper back articulation. The visual result is that a Balanchine cambré is typically much deeper.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** The placement of the head is a consequence of the backbend. In both styles, the head follows the line of the spine to complete the curve. Because the Balanchine backbend is deeper, the head will naturally end up in a different final position (lower and more inverted). However, the *cause* of this difference is the degree of the backbend itself, making (D) the more fundamental answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most defining difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière lies in the aesthetic goal, which directly translates to the depth or degree of the backbend. Balanchine encourages a more extreme and dramatic bend.\n\n<<<D>>>"
