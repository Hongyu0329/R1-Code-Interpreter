    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Motif:** The question asks to identify a peptide that binds to an integrin receptor. All five answer choices are short peptides that begin with the tripeptide sequence **RGD** (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid).\n2.  **Recall the Significance of the RGD Motif:** The RGD sequence is the most famous and well-characterized recognition site for a large family of integrin receptors. Integrins are cell surface receptors that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM). The RGD sequence is found in several ECM proteins, such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin, which are the natural ligands for integrins. Therefore, any peptide containing the RGD sequence is a potential candidate for integrin binding.\n3.  **Evaluate the Role of Flanking Amino Acids:** While the RGD sequence is the core binding site, the amino acids that flank this motif are critically important. They influence the three-dimensional conformation of the RGD loop and can make additional contacts with the integrin receptor. These flanking sequences determine the binding affinity (how strongly the peptide binds) and specificity (which specific integrin subtype it binds to, e.g., αvβ3 vs. α5β1). To find the peptide *most likely* to bind, we should look for a sequence that resembles a known, high-affinity binding site from a natural integrin ligand.\n4.  **Analyze Each Option's Flanking Sequence:**\n    *   **A. RGDMAA:** The sequence Met-Ala-Ala (MAA) is not a well-known or common flanking sequence for high-affinity integrin binding.\n    *   **B. RGDSPSS:** This peptide contains the sequence **RGDSP**. The sequence GRGDSP is the canonical cell-binding sequence found in **fibronectin**, one of the most important ECM proteins and a primary ligand for many integrins (especially α5β1 and αv integrins). Synthetic peptides containing RGDSP are widely used in cell biology and biochemistry as a standard for studying integrin-mediated adhesion and signaling. The presence of this well-established, naturally derived motif makes this peptide an extremely strong candidate.\n    *   **C. RGDLTTP:** The sequence Leu-Thr-Thr-Pro (LTTP) is not characteristic of a known, potent integrin-binding site from a major ECM protein.\n    *   **D. RGDQVSK:** The sequence Gln-Val-Ser-Lys (QVSK) is not a recognized high-affinity integrin binding sequence.\n    *   **E. RGDARGG:** The sequence Ala-Arg-Gly-Gly (ARGG) is also not a classic flanking sequence associated with strong integrin binding.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the peptide **RGDSPSS** contains the RGDSP motif, which is derived from the natural integrin ligand fibronectin. This sequence is well-documented and extensively proven to bind effectively to integrin receptors in numerous *in vitro* assays. Therefore, it is the most likely of the given options to show strong binding.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Universality of RGD:** Remember that RGD is the key. All options have it.\n*   **Importance of Context:** The flanking residues provide the crucial context that dictates binding strength and specificity.\n*   **Reference to Natural Ligands:** The most reliable way to predict binding is to see if the peptide sequence mimics a known binding site in a natural protein ligand like fibronectin.\n*   **RGDSP as a Gold Standard:** The RGDSP sequence is a classic example used in research, making any peptide containing it a prime suspect for integrin binding.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe peptide RGDSPSS contains the well-established RGDSP integrin-binding motif from fibronectin. This makes it a peptide that has been extensively found to bind, and is highly likely to bind, an integrin receptor in an *in vitro* assay.\n\n<<<B>>>"
