    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   We are given a graph $G$.\n    *   The number of vertices is $|V| = n = 12345$.\n    *   The graph $G$ is specified to be \"other than the complete graph\". This means $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n    *   The question asks for the \"maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly\". This means we need to find the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, over all graphs $G$ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Proper Vertex Colouring:** An assignment of colours to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.\n    *   **Chromatic Number $\\chi(G)$:** The minimum number of colours required for a proper vertex colouring of $G$.\n    *   **Complete Graph $K_n$:** A graph with $n$ vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    *   The problem is to find: $\\max \\{ \\chi(G) \\mid |V(G)| = 12345 \\text{ and } G \\neq K_{12345} \\}$.\n\n3.  **Establish an Upper Bound:**\n    *   A fundamental theorem in graph theory states that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number is less than or equal to the number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n    *   Furthermore, the equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds **if and only if** the graph $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$.\n    *   In our problem, the number of vertices is $n = 12345$. The problem explicitly states that our graph $G$ is **not** the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatic number of $G$ must be strictly less than $n$.\n    *   This gives us an upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n - 1 = 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n    *   This means that no graph under the given conditions can require more than 12344 colours.\n\n4.  **Show the Upper Bound is Achievable (Construct an Example):**\n    *   To prove that 12344 is the maximum possible value, we must demonstrate that there exists at least one graph $G$ (which is not $K_{12345}$) that requires exactly 12344 colours.\n    *   Consider the following graph, let's call it $G^*$:\n        *   Let $G^*$ be the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices ($K_{12344}$) and a single isolated vertex ($K_1$).\n    *   Let's verify this graph $G^*$:\n        *   **Number of vertices:** The number of vertices in $G^*$ is $12344 + 1 = 12345$. This matches the condition.\n        *   **Is it a complete graph?** No. For a graph to be $K_{12345}$, every vertex must be connected to every other vertex. In $G^*$, the isolated vertex is not connected to any of the vertices in the $K_{12344}$ component. So, $G^* \\neq K_{12345}$. This also matches the condition.\n    *   Now, let's find the chromatic number of $G^*$:\n        *   The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components.\n        *   The components of $G^*$ are $K_{12344}$ and $K_1$.\n        *   The chromatic number of a complete graph $K_m$ is $m$. Thus, $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n        *   The chromatic number of a single vertex $K_1$ is 1.\n        *   Therefore, $\\chi(G^*) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n    *   This example shows that it is possible to have a graph that satisfies the conditions and requires 12344 colours.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that any graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph requires at most 12344 colours ($\\chi(G) \\le 12344$).\n    *   We have also constructed a specific graph that meets the criteria and requires exactly 12344 colours.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of colours needed is 12344.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The phrase \"and maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$\" is descriptive information true for any graph and does not add a constraint that changes the problem. The maximum is taken over all possible non-complete graphs, regardless of their specific maximum degree.\n*   The core of the problem relies on the specific properties of complete graphs and their relation to the chromatic number.\n*   It's crucial to distinguish between an upper bound and the *maximum* value. Proving an upper bound is not enough; one must also show that the bound is tight by providing an example that achieves it.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nThe number of vertices is $n = 12345$.\nThe graph is not the complete graph $K_n$.\nThe maximum chromatic number is $n-1$.\nMaximum number of colours = $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
