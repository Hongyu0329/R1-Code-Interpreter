    "Answering this question requires combining concepts from additive combinatorics and fractal geometry. Let's break down the problem into two parts: finding an upper bound for the dimension, and showing that this upper bound can be achieved.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums of its elements are unique up to the order of summands. Formally, for any $s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4 \\in S$, the equation $s_1 + s_2 = s_3 + s_4$ implies that the unordered pair $\\{s_1, s_2\\}$ is the same as the unordered pair $\\{s_3, s_4\\}$. This means either ($s_1=s_3$ and $s_2=s_4$) or ($s_1=s_4$ and $s_2=s_3$).\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(S)$, is a way to measure the \"fractal\" dimension of a set $S$. For a set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, its Hausdorff dimension is a real number between 0 and $n$. For the context of this problem, the set $S$ is a subset of $[0,1]$, so its dimension will be between 0 and 1.\n\n### **Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Dimension**\n\nWe will show that if $S \\subset [0,1]$ is a Sidon set, then its Hausdorff dimension cannot exceed 1/2. The argument uses a few standard results from the theory of fractal geometry.\n\n1.  **Consider the Cartesian Product:** Let $S$ be a Sidon set in $[0,1]$ and let its Hausdorff dimension be $d = \\dim_H(S)$. We form the Cartesian product of the set with itself, $S \\times S = \\{(x, y) : x \\in S, y \\in S\\}$. This is a set in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A fundamental property of Hausdorff dimension is the product formula, which states that $\\dim_H(S \\times S) = \\dim_H(S) + \\dim_H(S) = 2d$.\n\n2.  **Apply a Linear Transformation:** Consider the linear map $\\Phi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $\\Phi(x, y) = (x+y, x-y)$. This is an invertible linear transformation (its matrix has determinant -2). Invertible linear maps are bi-Lipschitz, and a key property is that they preserve Hausdorff dimension. Let $K = \\Phi(S \\times S) = \\{(x+y, x-y) : x,y \\in S\\}$. Then we must have $\\dim_H(K) = \\dim_H(S \\times S) = 2d$.\n\n3.  **Project the Transformed Set:** Now, let's project the set $K$ onto its first coordinate. Let $\\pi_1: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be the projection map $\\pi_1(u, v) = u$. The image of $K$ under this projection is the sumset $S+S = \\{s_1+s_2 : s_1, s_2 \\in S\\}$. So, $\\pi_1(K) = S+S$.\n\n4.  **Use the Sidon Property and Slicing Theorem:** The crucial step is to see how the Sidon property of $S$ constrains the geometry of $K$. Let's look at the \"fibers\" of the projection $\\pi_1$. For a given $u \\in S+S$, the fiber is the set of points in $K$ that project onto $u$, i.e., $F_u = K \\cap \\pi_1^{-1}(u)$.\n    A point $(u, v)$ is in the fiber $F_u$ if $u=s_1+s_2$ and $v=s_1-s_2$ for some $s_1, s_2 \\in S$.\n    Suppose another point $(u, v')$ is also in this fiber. Then $u=s_3+s_4$ and $v'=s_3-s_4$ for some $s_3, s_4 \\in S$.\n    Since $s_1+s_2 = s_3+s_4 = u$, and $S$ is a Sidon set, we must have $\\{s_1, s_2\\} = \\{s_3, s_4\\}$.\n    *   Case (a): $(s_3, s_4) = (s_1, s_2)$. Then $v' = s_1-s_2 = v$. The point is the same.\n    *   Case (b): $(s_3, s_4) = (s_2, s_1)$. Then $v' = s_2-s_1 = -(s_1-s_2) = -v$.\n    This means that for any $u$, the fiber $F_u$ can contain at most two points: $(u, v)$ and $(u, -v)$. A finite set of points always has a Hausdorff dimension of 0. Thus, $\\sup_{u \\in S+S} \\dim_H(F_u) = 0$.\n\n5.  **Combine the Results:** A dimension slicing theorem relates the dimension of a set to the dimensions of its projection and its fibers: $\\dim_H(K) \\le \\dim_H(\\pi_1(K)) + \\sup_{u} \\dim_H(F_u)$.\n    Substituting what we found:\n    $2d \\le \\dim_H(S+S) + 0$.\n    Since $S \\subset [0,1]$, its sumset $S+S$ is a subset of $[0,2]$. Any subset of the real line has a Hausdorff dimension of at most 1. So, $\\dim_H(S+S) \\le 1$.\n    Combining these inequalities gives: $2d \\le 1$, which implies $d \\le 1/2$.\n\nThis proves that any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ must have a Hausdorff dimension of at most 1/2.\n\n### **Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound**\n\nThe second part of the problem is to determine if this upper bound of 1/2 is achievable. This requires constructing a Sidon set in $[0,1]$ that has a Hausdorff dimension of exactly 1/2.\n\nThe construction of such sets is a known but non-trivial result in the field. Naive constructions of Cantor-type sets often fail. For example, the set of numbers in $[0,1]$ whose base-4 expansion contains only the digits 0 and 1 has dimension $\\log(2)/\\log(4) = 1/2$. However, this set is not a Sidon set. For instance, $x_1=1/4$, $x_2=1/16$, $x_3=0$, and $x_4=1/4+1/16$ are all in this set, but $x_1+x_2=x_3+x_4$, violating the Sidon condition.\n\nMore sophisticated constructions are required. For example, S. Astels in his 1999 paper \"Cantor sets with prescribed arithmetic properties\" provided a method to construct a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension 1/2 using generalized Cantor sets with carefully chosen and rapidly growing bases. Other mathematicians like O.C. McGehee and T. Jordan & M. Rams have also confirmed such constructions.\n\nSince it has been proven that Sidon sets of dimension 1/2 exist, the upper bound of 1/2 is tight.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ is at most 1/2.\n*   There exist Sidon sets in $[0,1]$ whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1/2.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
