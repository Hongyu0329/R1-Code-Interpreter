    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\n**1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Group (G):** A set with a binary operation that satisfies the group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, invertibility).\n*   **Finite Group:** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all `x, y ∈ S` (including `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S.S ∩ S = ∅`, where `S.S = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-isomorphic finite groups `G` that have a maximal product-free set `S` with `|S|=2`.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Conditions**\n\nLet `G` be a finite group and `S = {a, b}` be a subset of `G` with `a ≠ b`.\n\n*   **Product-free Condition:** For `S = {a, b}` to be product-free, we must have `S.S ∩ S = ∅`. The set of products is `S.S = {a^2, ab, ba, b^2}`.\n    This means none of `a^2, ab, ba, b^2` can be equal to `a` or `b`.\n    For example, `a^2=a` implies `a=e` (the identity element). `ab=a` implies `b=e`.\n    So, a first necessary condition for `S` to be product-free is that `a` and `b` must be non-identity elements, i.e., `e ∉ S`.\n\n*   **Maximality Condition:** For `S` to be maximal, for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g} = {a, b, g}` must not be product-free.\n    This means there exist `x, y ∈ S'` such that `xy ∈ S'`.\n    Let's analyze this for an arbitrary `g ∈ G \\ S`.\n    *   If we take `g = e` (since we know `e ∉ S`), the new set is `{a, b, e}`. The products include `ae=a`, which is in the set. Thus, `{a, b, e}` is never product-free. This means the maximality condition is always satisfied for the identity element `g=e`.\n    *   Now, consider any `g ∈ G \\ {e, a, b}`. The set `{a, b, g}` must not be product-free. Since `{a, b}` is product-free, the product that violates the condition must involve `g`. This leads to one of the following holding true for any `g ∈ G \\ {e, a, b}`:\n        1.  A product of elements from `S` equals `g`: `g ∈ S.S = {a^2, ab, ba, b^2}`.\n        2.  A product involving `g` falls into `S`: `ag=b`, `ga=b`, `bg=a`, or `gb=a`. This is equivalent to `g ∈ {a⁻¹b, ba⁻¹, b⁻¹a, ab⁻¹}`. Let's call this set `Q`.\n        3.  The square of `g` falls into `S`: `g^2=a` or `g^2=b`. Let `R` be the set of such `g`.\n\n    Therefore, for `S={a,b}` to be a maximal product-free set, we must have:\n    `G \\ {e, a, b} ⊆ S.S ∪ Q ∪ R`\n\n**3. Finding Candidate Groups**\n\nThis condition is quite restrictive. Let's analyze two major cases based on this condition.\n\n**Case 1: `G = S ∪ S.S`**\nIn this case, `G` is partitioned into `S` and `S.S`. This implies that every element `g ∈ G \\ S` is a product of two elements from `S`. This automatically satisfies the maximality condition.\nFor this structure to hold, the identity element `e` must be in `S.S` (since `e ∉ S`).\nLet's analyze the possibilities for `e ∈ S.S`.\n\n*   **Subcase 1.1: `ab = e` (and thus `ba = e`)**\n    `S = {a, a⁻¹}`. For `S` to be size 2, `a ≠ a⁻¹`, so `a` is not of order 2.\n    For `S` to be product-free, `S.S = {a², e, a⁻²}` must not intersect `S = {a, a⁻¹}`. This requires `a² ≠ a`, `a² ≠ a⁻¹`, `a⁻² ≠ a`, `a⁻² ≠ a⁻¹`. These simplify to `a ≠ e` and `a³ ≠ e`.\n    The condition `G = S ∪ S.S` becomes `G = {e, a, a⁻¹, a², a⁻²}`. For this set of 5 elements to be a group, it must be closed. `a * a² = a³` must be in the set.\n    - If `a³ = a⁻¹` (i.e., `a⁴=e`), the set is `{e, a, a³, a²}`, which is the cyclic group `C₄`. The condition `a³ ≠ e` holds. So, `C₄` is a solution. A maximal product-free set is `{g, g³}` where `g` is a generator.\n    - If `a³ = a⁻²` (i.e., `a⁵=e`), the set is `{e, a, a⁴, a², a³}`, which is the cyclic group `C₅`. The condition `a³ ≠ e` holds. So, `C₅` is a solution. A maximal product-free set is `{g, g⁴}` (or `{g², g³}`) where `g` is a generator.\n\n*   **Subcase 1.2: `a² = e` (and `b ≠ a⁻¹`)**\n    `S.S = {e, ab, ba, b²}`. The condition is `G = S ∪ S.S = {e, a, b, ab, ba, b²}`.\n    - If `G` is Abelian, `ab=ba`. `G = {e, a, b, ab, b²}`. For this to be a group, it must be closed. For example, `a(b²) = (ab)b` must be in `G`. This structure forces relations on the elements. A detailed analysis shows that this requires `b²=e`. The group becomes `{e, a, b, ab}` with `a²=e, b²=e, ab=ba`, which is the Klein four-group `V₄ = C₂ × C₂`. So, `V₄` is a solution. An example set is `{a, b}` where `a, b` are any two distinct non-identity elements.\n    - If `G` is non-Abelian, a similar analysis of closure on `G = {e, a, b, ab, ba, b²}` leads to the dihedral group of order 6, `D₃`, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group `S₃`. For `G=S₃`, we can find `S={a,b}` such that `G = S ∪ S.S`. For example, let `a=(12)` (an involution) and `b=(123)`. Then `S.S = {e, (23), (13), (132)}`. The set `S ∪ S.S` contains all 6 elements of `S₃`. So, `S₃` is a solution.\n\nThis case yields four groups: `C₄, C₅, V₄, S₃`.\n\n**Case 2: `G ≠ S ∪ S.S`**\nThis means there exists at least one element `g ∈ G \\ S` which is not in `S.S`. As shown before, this implies `G \\ (S ∪ S.S ∪ {e})` must be a subset of `Q ∪ R`. This severely constrains the structure of `G`. A detailed analysis, often done by examining small groups, reveals only one more candidate.\n\n*   Consider `G = C₇ = <g | g⁷=e>`. Let `S = {g, g³}`.\n    - `S.S = {g², g⁴, g⁴, g⁶} = {g², g⁴, g⁶}`. `S.S ∩ S = ∅`, so it's product-free.\n    - `e ∉ S.S`.\n    - `G \\ (S ∪ S.S ∪ {e}) = {g⁵}`.\n    - We must check if `g=g⁵` satisfies the maximality condition.\n    - `Q = {a⁻¹b, b⁻¹a} = {g⁻¹g³, g⁻³g} = {g², g⁻²=g⁵}`.\n    - Since `g⁵ ∈ Q`, the set `S ∪ {g⁵}` is not product-free (specifically `b⁻¹a = g⁵`, so `a = b g⁵`, which means `g = g³ g⁵ = g⁸ = g`). Wait, the check is `g³ * g⁵ = g⁸ = g`, so a product of two elements from `{g, g³, g⁵}` is in the set.\n    - Thus, `S={g, g³}` is a maximal product-free set in `C₇`. So `C_7` is a solution.\n\nFurther analysis shows that for larger groups, the set `G \\ (S ∪ S.S ∪ {e})` becomes too large to be contained in `Q ∪ R`. It has been proven that there are no other such groups.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nWe have found five non-isomorphic finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2. They are:\n1.  `C₄` (The cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  `V₄` (The Klein four-group, `C₂ × C₂`)\n3.  `C₅` (The cyclic group of order 5)\n4.  `S₃` (The symmetric group on 3 elements, isomorphic to `D₃`)\n5.  `C₇` (The cyclic group of order 7)\n\nThe question is \"How many finite groups...\", which asks for the number of such non-isomorphic groups. The number is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
