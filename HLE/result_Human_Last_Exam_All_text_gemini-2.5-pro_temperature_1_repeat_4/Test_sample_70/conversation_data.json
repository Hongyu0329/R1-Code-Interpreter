    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Flag Description:** The flag of Denmark features a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross's vertical and horizontal bars extend to the edges of the flag. The center of the cross is shifted towards the hoist side.\n\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** To analyze the flag using linear algebra, we represent it as a matrix. We assign distinct numerical values to the colors to satisfy the condition of maximal rank. Let Red = R and White = W, where R and W are distinct, non-zero numbers (e.g., R=1, W=2).\n\n3.  **Identifying Independent Rows:** We examine the rows of the matrix. There are only two distinct types of rows:\n    *   **Type 1:** Rows that correspond to the horizontal white bar of the cross. These rows consist entirely of the value W. All such rows are identical: `v1 = [W, W, W, ..., W]`.\n    *   **Type 2:** Rows that correspond to the red field above or below the horizontal bar. These rows are mostly the value R, but are interrupted by a segment of W for the vertical bar of the cross. All such rows are identical: `v2 = [R, ..., R, W, R, ..., R]`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Rank:** The rank of the matrix is the number of linearly independent vectors in its row space. The row space is spanned by the set of all row vectors, which in this case are all just copies of `v1` and `v2`. Therefore, the rank is the dimension of the space spanned by `{v1, v2}`.\n\n5.  **Linear Independence Check:** We check if `v1` and `v2` are linearly independent. They are linearly independent if one is not a scalar multiple of the other. For `v1 = c * v2`, we would need `W = c * R` and `W = c * W`. The second equation gives `c=1` (since W is non-zero). Substituting `c=1` into the first equation gives `W = R`. However, the colors are distinct, so W ≠ R. This is a contradiction. Thus, `v1` and `v2` are linearly independent.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:** Since the row space is spanned by two linearly independent vectors, the rank of the matrix representation of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Identify African Flags with Rank 2\n\nWe are now looking for African national flags whose matrix representation also has a rank of 2. This means the flag's design must be reducible to exactly two linearly independent row or column patterns.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Maximal Rank:** We must assign a unique, non-zero value to each color.\n*   **Emblems:** Emblems like stars, crescents, shields, or other complex symbols almost always introduce new, unique row/column patterns. A flag with an emblem on a colored field will have at least three linearly independent patterns (the field pattern, the emblem pattern, and the pattern of the field with the emblem on it), resulting in a rank of 3 or higher.\n*   **Simple Tricolors:** A simple horizontal or vertical tricolor flag (e.g., Red-White-Blue) will have three distinct row/column patterns, giving it a rank of 3.\n*   **Diagonal/Complex Patterns:** Flags with diagonal lines or other complex geometric shapes typically have many different row/column patterns, leading to a rank higher than 2.\n\nBased on these points, we search for flags with very simple geometric patterns composed of two colors or a specific structure that results in only two unique vector patterns.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of African Flags\n\n1.  **Nigeria:**\n    *   **Design:** Three vertical bands of Green-White-Green.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's analyze the columns. There are only two types of columns: all-Green columns (`c_G = [G, G, ..., G]^T`) and all-White columns (`c_W = [W, W, ..., W]^T`). These two vectors are linearly independent. The column space is spanned by `{c_G, c_W}`.\n    *   **Rank:** 2. This is a match.\n\n2.  **Madagascar:**\n    *   **Design:** A vertical white band at the hoist, with two horizontal bands of red (top) and green (bottom).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's analyze the rows. There are two types of rows: rows in the top half (`v_top = [W, ..., W, R, ..., R]`) and rows in the bottom half (`v_bottom = [W, ..., W, G, ..., G]`). These two row vectors are linearly independent (since R ≠ G). The row space is spanned by `{v_top, v_bottom}`.\n    *   **Rank:** 2. This is a match.\n\n3.  **Benin:**\n    *   **Design:** A vertical green band at the hoist, with two horizontal bands of yellow (top) and red (bottom).\n    *   **Analysis:** This flag has the exact same geometric structure as the flag of Madagascar. The rows are of two types: `v_top = [G, ..., G, Y, ..., Y]` and `v_bottom = [G, ..., G, R, ..., R]`. These two vectors are linearly independent.\n    *   **Rank:** 2. This is a match.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Other Flags (Why they are not Rank 2):**\n    *   **Flags with Emblems (e.g., Somalia, Angola, Morocco, Central African Republic):** As discussed, the emblem adds at least one more linearly independent vector, making the rank 3 or higher. For example, the star on Somalia's flag creates new row patterns distinct from the plain blue background, resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n    *   **Simple Tricolors (e.g., Mali, Gabon, Sierra Leone):** These flags have three distinct color bands, resulting in three linearly independent row/column vectors and a rank of 3.\n    *   **Flags with >3 Colors/Stripes (e.g., Mauritius, The Gambia):** These will have a rank of at least 4.\n    *   **Flags with Diagonal/Complex Patterns (e.g., Rep. of the Congo, Tanzania, Seychelles):** The rows and columns of these flags have many different patterns of colors, leading to a high rank.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe flags of African nations that have a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark, are those with simple, emblem-free geometric designs that produce exactly two linearly independent row or column vectors.\n\nThe countries are:\n*   **Nigeria**\n*   **Madagascar**\n*   **Benin**\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Nigeria>>>"
