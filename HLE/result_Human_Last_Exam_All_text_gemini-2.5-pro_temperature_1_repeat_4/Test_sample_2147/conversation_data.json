    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figure and his known beliefs.**\nPavel Milyukov (1859-1943) was a prominent Russian historian and a leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets). As a historian, he was a positivist, meaning he believed in objective, scientific, and rational approaches to understanding history and society. As a politician, he was a Westernizer who advocated for Russia to adopt a constitutional monarchy and other liberal-democratic institutions modeled on Western Europe. His worldview was rooted in 19th-century rationalism and belief in progress.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the quote and its context.**\nThe quote describes Milyukov accusing \"Western culture\" and denouncing \"X-Ys as a 'stagnant swamp'\".\n*   **\"Stagnant swamp\"**: This metaphor suggests something that is decaying, unproductive, lacking in vitality, and possibly morally corrupt. It implies a rejection of progress and reason.\n*   **\"Western culture of his time\"**: This points to the cultural movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries (the *fin de si√®cle*).\n*   **\"X-Y\"**: The hyphenated format suggests a compound term used to describe a specific group or movement.\n\n**Step 3: Connect Milyukov's beliefs to the cultural movements of the era.**\nGiven Milyukov's rationalist and progressive outlook, he would have been highly critical of artistic and philosophical movements that embraced irrationalism, mysticism, aestheticism (\"art for art's sake\"), and individualism over social duty. The dominant anti-rationalist cultural movement that swept across Europe and Russia during this period was a combination of Symbolism and Decadence.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate \"Symbolists-Decadents\" as the potential \"X-Y\".**\n*   **Symbolism**: An artistic and literary movement that rejected realism. It used symbols, metaphors, and suggestion to evoke subjective emotional experiences and mystical ideas.\n*   **Decadence**: A related movement characterized by a fascination with the perverse, the artificial, and the morbid. It often celebrated a sense of societal and moral decay.\n*   **The Connection**: These two movements were often conflated, especially by their critics. The term \"Symbolists-Decadents\" was frequently used to describe this new, anti-realist, and often pessimistic cultural trend.\n*   **Milyukov's Opposition**: For a rationalist liberal like Milyukov, this entire cultural direction was anathema. He saw it as a retreat from the pressing social and political problems Russia faced, a self-indulgent dive into obscurity and morbidity. It represented a betrayal of the Enlightenment values he cherished. Describing it as a \"stagnant swamp\" perfectly captures his view of it as a morbid, unproductive, and anti-progressive phenomenon.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nThe term that fits the \"X-Y\" format and represents a major cultural movement of the era that Pavel Milyukov, given his philosophical and political stances, would have vehemently denounced as a \"stagnant swamp\" is \"Symbolists-Decadents\".\n\n<<<Symbolists-Decadents>>>"
