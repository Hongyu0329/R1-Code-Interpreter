    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a \"conceptual entity.\" The question provides several clues to pinpoint this entity:\n*   **Source:** It is mentioned by historian Fernand Braudel.\n*   **Origin:** Braudel is quoting another writer, Paul Morand.\n*   **Core Idea:** The entity \"should be inscribed within a sphere.\"\n*   **Context:** This idea is part of Braudel's emphasis on a \"global historical perspective.\"\n*   **Example:** The \"symbol of a nation\" is given as an example of what this entity can be about.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the clues**\n*   **Fernand Braudel and the \"global historical perspective\":** Braudel is famous for his work on the *longue dur√©e* (long-term history) and world-systems. He argued against studying nations or events in isolation, insisting they must be understood within larger, global contexts.\n*   **\"Inscribed within a sphere\":** This is a powerful metaphor. The \"sphere\" represents the globe, the entire world. To \"inscribe\" something within it means to place it, study it, and understand it in its global context, considering all its worldwide connections and influences.\n*   **\"Exemplified by the symbol of a nation\":** A nation is a specific case. Braudel would argue that to understand the history or economy of a single nation (like France or England), one must look at its relationship with the entire world-economy, not just its internal affairs. The \"problem\" of a nation is the subject of study.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the specific quote**\nTo find the precise \"conceptual entity,\" we need to find the passage where Braudel quotes Morand. The quote appears in the introduction to Braudel's *The Perspective of the World* (Volume 3 of *Civilization and Capitalism*). Braudel cites Paul Morand's 1937 book, *Rococo*. The key sentence from Morand is: \"Everything... is a matter of geography, and **every problem** should be inscribed on a sphere.\"\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the information to identify the entity**\nBraudel seizes upon Morand's statement. He agrees that **\"every problem\"** needs a global, geographical context. He then applies this directly to his own historical work, stating that \"the problem of France, the problem of England, the problem of any 'national' economy... must be on the terrestrial globe.\"\n\nTherefore, the \"conceptual entity\" that Morand asserts should be inscribed within a sphere is explicitly stated: it is **a problem**. The nation is the subject or context of a specific type of historical problem that Braudel is interested in analyzing.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe conceptual entity, according to the quote from Paul Morand that Fernand Braudel used to support his global perspective, is \"a problem\" or \"every problem.\"\n\n<<<a problem>>>"
