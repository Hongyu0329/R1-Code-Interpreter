    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. This character is distinguished by a particular feeling: they are ashamed that they miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth. This requires knowledge of the film's plot, characters, and key dialogue.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters**\nLet's consider each character from the answer choices and their role/mindset in the film.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist, a psychologist sent from Earth to the Solaris station. The film begins with him at his father's dacha on Earth, surrounded by nature, including water and trees. This establishes his strong connection to the very things he might later miss. Throughout the film, he grapples with his memories, his humanity, and his separation from his home world.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"guest\" or \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his deceased wife, created by the sentient ocean of Solaris. She has no real memories of Earth, only the ones she has inherited from Kris. Her struggle is existential—about her own nature and reality—not about nostalgia for a place she's never truly been.\n*   **C. Snaut:** One of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He is cynical, world-weary, and philosophical. He often talks about humanity's limitations and the futility of their mission, but his expressions are generally broader and more abstract, rather than specific, personal feelings of shame tied to a sensory memory.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** The other scientist on the station. He is portrayed as cold, detached, and ruthlessly focused on scientific inquiry. He treats the \"visitors\" as mere phenomena to be studied and shows little emotional vulnerability or nostalgia for Earth. Such a sentimental admission would be highly out of character for him.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** A friend of Kris's and the third scientist on the station. He commits suicide before Kris arrives. Kris watches a video message Gibarian left behind, but this message is filled with despair, confusion, and warnings about the station, not reflective nostalgia about Earth.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nThe sentiment in question is very specific. It arises during a poignant conversation between Kris Kelvin and the recreated Hari.\n\n*   Kris is trying to explain his life on Earth to Hari, who has no context for it.\n*   He talks about the seasons, specifically winter and snow. This leads him to think of other natural phenomena.\n*   He mentions the \"rustling of leaves.\" Hari, being a creation of Solaris with no direct experience of Earth, does not know what that sound is.\n*   Her lack of understanding forces Kris to confront his own disconnection from his home. He realizes that through his work and time in space, he has also forgotten this simple, beautiful sound.\n*   This realization brings him a profound sense of loss and shame. He explicitly states his shame for having forgotten something so fundamental to his earthly existence.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\nThe character who is ashamed of missing the sound of rustling leaves is the protagonist, Kris Kelvin. The moment is a critical point in his character arc, highlighting his alienation from his own home and humanity while trapped in the psychological labyrinth of Solaris. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
