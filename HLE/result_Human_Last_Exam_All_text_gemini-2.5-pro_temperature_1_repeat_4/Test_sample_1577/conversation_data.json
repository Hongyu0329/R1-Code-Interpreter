    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with $n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes.\n\n**1. Understanding the Basics**\n\n*   **Toric Code:** A quantum error-correcting code defined on a 2D lattice. Its properties, including the ground space degeneracy (GSD), are determined by the topology of the surface on which the lattice is placed.\n*   **Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD):** The GSD is the number of distinct ground states, which is given by $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of logical qubits encoded by the code.\n*   **Boundaries (Holes):** The toric code can be defined on surfaces with boundaries (holes). These boundaries can be of two types:\n    *   **Smooth (or Z-type) boundary:** At this type of boundary, Z-type string operators can terminate. Excitations corresponding to violated plaquette conditions (m-anyons or vortices) can be absorbed or created at a smooth boundary.\n    *   **Rough (or X-type) boundary:** At this type of boundary, X-type string operators can terminate. Excitations corresponding to violated star conditions (e-anyons or charges) can be absorbed or created at a rough boundary.\n\n**2. The Formula for Logical Qubits**\n\nThe number of logical qubits ($k$) for the toric code on a surface is given by a well-established topological formula:\n\n$k = 2g + N_s + N_r - 1$\n\nwhere:\n*   $g$ is the genus of the surface (the number of \"handles\"). For a plane or a sphere, $g=0$.\n*   $N_s$ is the total number of smooth boundaries.\n*   $N_r$ is the total number of rough boundaries.\n\nThis formula is valid for any surface with at least one boundary ($N_s + N_r \\ge 1$).\n\n**3. Interpreting the Problem Statement**\n\nThe question asks for the GSD on a surface \"with $n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes\". This phrasing usually implies that these holes are punched into a 2D plane.\n\n*   A simple 2D plane can be considered topologically as either:\n    1.  An infinite plane, which is topologically equivalent to a sphere with a point removed (i.e., a puncture). If we have $n+m$ holes, this becomes a sphere with $n+m$ punctures.\n    2.  A finite plane, such as a disk. This is a more common setup in condensed matter physics. A disk itself has one boundary. The holes are then punched *into* this disk.\n\nLet's analyze both interpretations.\n\n**Interpretation 1: Punctured Sphere**\n*   The surface is a sphere with $n$ smooth punctures and $m$ rough punctures.\n*   The genus is $g=0$.\n*   The total number of smooth boundaries is $N_s = n$.\n*   The total number of rough boundaries is $N_r = m$.\n*   Using the formula: $k = 2(0) + n + m - 1 = n+m-1$.\n*   This gives a GSD of $2^{n+m-1}$. However, this is not among the answer choices, suggesting this interpretation is not what the question intends.\n\n**Interpretation 2: Holes in a Disk**\n*   The surface is a disk (which has its own \"outer\" boundary) with $n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes punched inside it.\n*   The genus of a disk with holes is still $g=0$.\n*   The total number of boundaries is the sum of the inner holes ($n+m$) plus the one outer boundary of the disk itself.\n*   We need to consider the type of the outer boundary. However, the final result for $k$ is independent of its type. Let's demonstrate this:\n    *   **Case A: The outer boundary is smooth.**\n        *   Total smooth boundaries: $N_s = n$ (inner holes) + 1 (outer boundary) = $n+1$.\n        *   Total rough boundaries: $N_r = m$.\n        *   Using the formula: $k = 2(0) + (n+1) + m - 1 = n+m$.\n    *   **Case B: The outer boundary is rough.**\n        *   Total smooth boundaries: $N_s = n$.\n        *   Total rough boundaries: $N_r = m$ (inner holes) + 1 (outer boundary) = $m+1$.\n        *   Using the formula: $k = 2(0) + n + (m+1) - 1 = n+m$.\n\nBoth cases yield the same number of logical qubits: $k = n+m$. This interpretation leads to a result that is present in the answer choices.\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\n*   Based on the most plausible interpretation (holes punched in a disk), the number of logical qubits is $k = n+m$.\n*   The ground space degeneracy is GSD = $2^k$.\n*   Therefore, the GSD is $2^{n+m}$.\n\n**5. Verification with Simple Cases**\n\n*   **A disk (no holes):** Here, $n=0, m=0$. The disk has one boundary. Assume it's smooth. $N_s=1, N_r=0$. The formula gives $k=1+0-1=0$. GSD=$2^0=1$. Our result $k=n+m=0$ matches.\n*   **An annulus with two smooth boundaries:** This is a disk with one smooth hole ($n=1, m=0$). The outer boundary is also smooth. Total smooth boundaries $N_s=2, N_r=0$. The formula gives $k=2+0-1=1$. GSD=$2^1=2$. Our result $k=n+m=1+0=1$ matches.\n\nThe result holds for these well-known cases.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of logical qubits is $k = n+m$. The ground space degeneracy is $2^{n+m}$.\n\nFinal Answer Selection: This corresponds to answer choice A."
