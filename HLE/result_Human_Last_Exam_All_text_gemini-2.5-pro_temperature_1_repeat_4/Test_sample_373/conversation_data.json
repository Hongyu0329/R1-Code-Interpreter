    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Graph Structure\nThe problem specifies a barbell graph with 10 nodes. A standard barbell graph is constructed by taking two identical complete graphs and connecting them with a single edge, known as a bridge or bottleneck edge.\n*   **Total Nodes (N):** 10\n*   Since the graph is composed of two identical complete graphs ($K_k$), we have $2k = 10$, which means each complete graph is a $K_5$.\n*   **Structure:** The graph consists of two $K_5$ cliques (let's call them $C_1$ and $C_2$) connected by a single bottleneck edge.\n*   **Bottleneck Edge:** Let this edge connect node $u$ in $C_1$ to node $v$ in $C_2$.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Sampling Process\nThe process is \"randomized uniform gossiping\". This typically means:\n1.  A single node is selected uniformly at random from the set of all $N$ nodes in the graph.\n2.  The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to interact with.\nThe edge connecting the initially selected node and its chosen neighbor is considered \"sampled\" for that round of gossiping.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Node Degrees\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. We need the degrees of the nodes at the ends of the bottleneck edge.\n*   Let's consider node $u$ in clique $C_1$. It is part of a complete graph $K_5$, so it is connected to the other $5-1=4$ nodes within $C_1$.\n*   Additionally, node $u$ is connected to node $v$ via the bottleneck edge.\n*   Therefore, the degree of node $u$ is $d(u) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n*   By symmetry, the degree of node $v$ in clique $C_2$ is also $d(v) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n*   For any other node $w$ not on the bridge, it is only connected to other nodes within its own $K_5$, so its degree is $d(w) = 5-1 = 4$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Probability\nThe bottleneck edge $(u,v)$ is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events occurs in a single gossiping step:\n1.  Node $u$ is selected initially, and it then chooses its neighbor $v$.\n2.  Node $v$ is selected initially, and it then chooses its neighbor $u$.\n\nWe calculate the probability of each event and add them together.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 1:**\n    *   The probability of selecting node $u$ from the 10 total nodes is $P(\\text{select } u) = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n    *   Given that $u$ is selected, the probability that it chooses neighbor $v$ is $P(u \\text{ chooses } v) = \\frac{1}{d(u)} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n    *   The combined probability of Event 1 is $P(\\text{Event 1}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 2:**\n    *   The probability of selecting node $v$ from the 10 total nodes is $P(\\text{select } v) = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n    *   Given that $v$ is selected, the probability that it chooses neighbor $u$ is $P(v \\text{ chooses } u) = \\frac{1}{d(v)} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n    *   The combined probability of Event 2 is $P(\\text{Event 2}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    *   The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n    *   $P(\\text{sample bottleneck}) = P(\\text{Event 1}) + P(\\text{Event 2}) = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nThe probability can be expressed as a fraction or a decimal.\n$1/25 = 0.04$.\n\n<<<0.04>>>"
