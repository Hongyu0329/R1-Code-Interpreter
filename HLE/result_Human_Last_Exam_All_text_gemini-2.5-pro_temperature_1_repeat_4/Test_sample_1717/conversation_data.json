    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Determine the Base Health in Expert Mode:**\n    First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu for a single player in an Expert Mode world. According to the game's data, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of **3640 HP** in Expert Mode.\n\n2.  **Understand the Health Scaling Formula:**\n    In Terraria, boss health increases in multiplayer to provide a challenge for the increased number of players. For Expert Mode, the health of the Eye of Cthulhu is increased by **35%** for each player after the first.\n    Let `N` be the number of players. The formula for the total health multiplier is:\n    `Multiplier = 1 + 0.35 * (N - 1)`\n    Therefore, the total health can be calculated as:\n    `Total Health(N) = Base Health * Multiplier`\n    `Total Health(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Formula for an Infinite Number of Players:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. This means we must evaluate the limit of the health formula as the number of players (`N`) approaches infinity (`∞`).\n    `lim (N -> ∞) [3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))]`\n    As `N` becomes infinitely large, the expression `(1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))` also becomes infinitely large. Mathematically, the function has no upper bound, and the health would approach infinity.\n\n4.  **Consider the Constraints from the Source Code:**\n    The crucial part of the question is the phrase \"According to the source code\". This directs us to consider the game's actual implementation, not just the mathematical formula in isolation. In the Terraria source code (which is written in C#), the health of NPCs (Non-Player Characters), including bosses, is stored in a 32-bit signed integer variable (`int`).\n\n5.  **Identify the Limit of the Data Type:**\n    A 32-bit signed integer has a specific maximum value it can represent. This value is `2^31 - 1`. Any attempt to store a larger number in this variable will result in an overflow, but the highest value that can be correctly stored is this limit.\n    The maximum value is:\n    `2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,648 - 1 = 2,147,483,647`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the health scaling formula implies that the Eye of Cthulhu's health would grow infinitely with an infinite number of players, the game engine itself imposes a hard limit based on the data type used to store health. The `NPC.lifeMax` variable is an `int`, meaning the health cannot exceed the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu can have is the maximum value of this data type.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
