    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **\"first statute\"**: This requires a chronological analysis to find the earliest law that meets the criteria.\n2.  **\"in the modern State of Israel\"**: This limits the scope to laws passed by the Knesset after the state's establishment in 1948. It excludes British Mandatory ordinances unless they were amended by the Knesset to introduce the concept.\n3.  **\"to explicitly introduce\"**: The statute must use the specific term \"good faith\" or its Hebrew equivalent, \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). A law that merely implies a standard of fairness is not sufficient.\n4.  **\"the concept of 'good faith'\"**: The question refers to the legal principle that parties to a legal relationship must act honestly and fairly.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates**\nThe principle of \"good faith\" is most famously associated with the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Sections 12 and 39 of this law made good faith a foundational, \"super-principle\" of Israeli contract law. However, the question asks for the *first* statute, which means we must look for legislation enacted before 1973. This requires examining the major civil law codifications that preceded the Contracts Law.\n\n**Step 3: Chronological Examination of Pre-1973 Legislation**\nWe need to search for the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) in significant civil laws passed by the Knesset in the 1960s.\n\n*   **Sale Law, 1968**: Section 6 of this law states that \"An obligation arising from a contract of sale shall be performed in a customary manner and in good faith.\" This explicitly introduces the concept but was passed in 1968. We must check if there is an earlier instance.\n*   **Land Law, 1969**: Section 10 of this law protects a purchaser who acquired a right in registered land relying \"in good faith\" on the registry. This was passed in 1969, later than the Sale Law.\n*   **Agency Law, 1965**: This law predates both the Sale Law and the Land Law. We need to examine its text. Section 8(a) of the Agency Law states: \"An agent shall be loyal to his principal and shall act in accordance with his instructions and, in the absence of instructions on a particular matter... shall act with the diligence that a reasonable person would exercise and in good faith.\"\n\n**Step 4: Careful Point of Consideration - Pre-State Law**\nOne might consider the Bills of Exchange Ordinance, a holdover from the British Mandate. It contains the concept of a \"holder in due course,\" which requires taking an instrument \"in good faith.\" However, this was not a concept *introduced* by a statute of the modern State of Israel; it was inherited. The question's phrasing \"first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce\" points toward original legislation passed by the Knesset. The new civil codifications of the 1960s represent the first deliberate efforts by the Israeli legislature to introduce such civil law principles into its own body of law.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion of the Analysis**\nComparing the dates of the original Knesset statutes that explicitly use the term \"good faith\":\n*   **Agency Law**: 1965\n*   **Sale Law**: 1968\n*   **Land Law**: 1969\n*   **Contracts (General Part) Law**: 1973\n\nThe earliest among these is the Agency Law of 1965. It is widely recognized in Israeli legal scholarship as the first statute in the new wave of Israeli codification to explicitly incorporate the duty of good faith into a legal relationship.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\nThe question asks for the name of the statute, without \"the\" or the year. The statute identified is the Agency Law.\n\n<<<Agency Law>>>"
