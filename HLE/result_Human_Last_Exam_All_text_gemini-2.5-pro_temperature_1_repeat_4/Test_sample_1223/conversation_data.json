    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.\n\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditarily Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is a well-known example. A key property of any indecomposable continuum is that it has no cut-points (a point whose removal disconnects the space).\n*   **$X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:** We start with a hereditarily indecomposable continuum $X$ and remove a single point $x$. Let's call this space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n    *   Since $X$ is a continuum, it has no isolated points. Thus, $Y$ is non-compact.\n    *   Since $Y$ is an open subset of the compact metric space $X$, it is locally compact.\n    *   Since $X$ is an indecomposable continuum, it has no cut-points. Therefore, removing the single point $x$ does not disconnect the space. So, $Y$ is connected.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification $\\beta(Y)$:** For any Tychonoff space $Y$ (which includes metric spaces), its Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta(Y)$ is the \"largest\" possible compact Hausdorff space that contains $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder $Y^*$:** The remainder is the set of points added to $Y$ to form its Stone-Cech compactification, i.e., $Y^* = \\beta(Y) \\setminus Y$.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $p$ in a continuum $K$, the composant of $p$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. The collection of all composants forms a partition of $K$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the topological nature of the Stone-Cech remainder.\n\nThe space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a connected, locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff space. A standard theorem in topology states that for any such space, its Stone-Cech remainder $Y^*$ is a continuum.\n\nWe must ensure that this continuum is non-degenerate (i.e., not a single point). The remainder $Y^*$ is a single point if and only if $Y$ is pseudocompact. A space is pseudocompact if every continuous real-valued function on it is bounded. Let $d$ be the metric on $X$. The function $f: Y \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(z) = 1/d(z, x)$ is continuous on $Y$. Since $X$ is a continuum, $x$ is not an isolated point, so there exists a sequence of points in $Y$ converging to $x$. For this sequence, $f$ is unbounded. Thus, $Y$ is not pseudocompact, and its remainder $Y^*$ is a non-degenerate continuum.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the properties of the remainder $Y^*$ to the original space $X$.\n\nThis is the most crucial step and relies on a deep result from continuum theory.\n*   The initial space $X$ is a hereditarily indecomposable continuum. This implies that $X$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n*   A theorem by David P. Bellamy (1971) states that if $K$ is any indecomposable continuum and $p \\in K$, then the Stone-Cech remainder of $K \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is also an indecomposable continuum.\n*   Applying this theorem to our situation (with $K=X$ and $p=x$), we can conclude that the remainder $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of composants in the remainder $Y^*$.\n\nNow we need to determine the number of composants in an indecomposable continuum.\n*   A classical theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz states that any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants.\n*   More precisely, the number of composants is $\\mathfrak{c}$, which is the cardinality of the continuum ($2^{\\aleph_0}$). Each composant is a dense subset of the continuum.\n*   Since we established in Step 2 that $Y^*$ is a non-degenerate continuum and in Step 3 that it is indecomposable, it must have exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the maximum possible number.\n\nThe analysis above shows that for *any* hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and for *any* point $x \\in X$, the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is precisely $\\mathfrak{c}$. Since this number is constant for all possible choices, the maximum possible number is also $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximum possible number of composants is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum."
