    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Key Components:**\n    *   **BUD (Beyond-Use Date):** This is the date/time after which a compounded sterile preparation or, in this case, a manipulated commercial product, should not be used. It is assigned based on the risk of microbial contamination.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container:** A container intended for a single use in a single patient. A key characteristic is that it typically lacks antimicrobial preservatives.\n    *   **Ampule:** A specific type of single-dose container made of glass with a neck that is broken to access the medication. Once broken, it is an open system and cannot be resealed.\n    *   **Puncture (or Opening):** In the context of an ampule, this means breaking the glass neck to open it.\n    *   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, such as a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or a biological safety cabinet (BSC), which is designed to minimize microbial contamination.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Standard:**\n    *   The primary standard for sterile compounding and handling of sterile products in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>, \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specifics for an Ampule:**\n    *   The most critical point of this question is that the container is an **ampule**.\n    *   Unlike a vial, which has a rubber stopper that largely reseals after being punctured by a needle, an ampule becomes a completely open container once its neck is snapped.\n    *   This open state leaves the sterile contents continuously exposed to the surrounding environment, creating a high risk of microbial contamination, even within a controlled ISO Class 5 environment.\n\n4.  **Differentiate from Other Single-Dose Containers (e.g., Vials):**\n    *   It is important to distinguish this from the rule for single-dose *vials*. According to the most recent USP <797> guidelines (effective November 1, 2023), a single-dose vial that has been punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture to prepare compounded sterile preparations.\n    *   This 12-hour rule **does not apply** to ampules because they cannot be closed after opening.\n\n5.  **Determine the BUD for an Opened Ampule:**\n    *   Due to the high risk of contamination, an opened ampule cannot be stored for any length of time. Standard aseptic practice and safety guidelines dictate that the contents should be withdrawn immediately after opening.\n    *   Any unused portion of the medication remaining in the ampule must be discarded immediately. It cannot be saved, stored, or used later.\n    *   Therefore, the concept of a storage BUD does not apply to an opened ampule. Its \"use\" period is immediate.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe BUD for a single-dose ampule once opened is effectively zero. It is intended for immediate use only, and any unused contents must be discarded right away.\n\n<<<An opened ampule must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded. It cannot be stored for any period of time."
