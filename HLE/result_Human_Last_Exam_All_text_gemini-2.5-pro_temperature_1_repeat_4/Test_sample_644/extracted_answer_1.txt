To fix the mistake of going to the top of the Leaning Tower before graduation, the student must go to the nearby Pisa Baptistery (Battistero di San Giovanni) in the same square. They must then run around the Baptistery a number of times equal to the final graduation score (out of 110) that they hope to achieve.
