    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the function F₃(x)**\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined recursively. Let's write down the explicit form of F₃(x).\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integral**\nThe integral we need to evaluate is:\nV = ∫₀¹ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx\n\nThis integral is in the form ∫ (f'(x) / f(x)) dx.\nLet u = f(x). Then du = f'(x) dx. The integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du, which evaluates to ln|u| + C.\nIn our specific case, f(x) = F₃(x). So, the antiderivative of the integrand is ln|F₃(x)|.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\nTo evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the values of F₃(x) at the boundaries**\nWe need to find F₃(0) and F₃(1).\n*   **At x = 0:**\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))\n    Since sin(0) = 0 and e⁰ = 1,\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n*   **At x = 1:**\n    F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n    Here, '1' is in radians.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the boundary values into the expression for V**\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\nV = ln|ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))| - ln|ln(2)|\n\n**Step 6: Check the arguments of the logarithms to handle the absolute values**\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.693, which is positive. So, |ln(2)| = ln(2).\n*   For `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`:\n    *   The angle 1 radian is in the first quadrant (0 < 1 < π/2 ≈ 1.57).\n    *   Therefore, sin(1) is positive (sin(1) ≈ 0.841).\n    *   `e^(sin(1))` is greater than `e⁰ = 1`.\n    *   `1 + e^(sin(1))` is greater than 2.\n    *   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` is greater than `ln(2)`, so it is also positive.\n*   Since both `ln(F₃(1))` and `ln(F₃(0))` are positive, we can remove the absolute value signs.\n    V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\n**Step 7: Simplify the expression for V and calculate its numerical value**\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we get:\nV = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerical value:\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.841471\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.841471 ≈ 2.319777\n*   1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.319777\n*   ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.319777) ≈ 1.200000\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.693147\n*   V ≈ ln(1.200000 / 0.693147)\n*   V ≈ ln(1.731245)\n*   V ≈ 0.548835\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the final required value**\nThe question asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548835 = 5488.35\nThe closest integer to 5488.35 is 5488.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
