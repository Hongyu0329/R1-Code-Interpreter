    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step 1: Identify all historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*.\n\nFirst, we must compile a list of all real, geographical mountains that are named or clearly referenced in the epic poem.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The most famous, serving as the home of the gods. It is explicitly excluded by the question but serves as the primary benchmark.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain near Troy (in modern-day Turkey) is frequently mentioned. Zeus, in particular, often observes the Trojan War from its peaks.\n*   **Samothrace:** In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits on the highest peak of the \"wooded isle of Samothrace\" to watch the battle. The highest peak of this island is Mount Fengari.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, the goddess Hera flies from Olympus and her journey takes her \"over the snowy mountains of the Thracian horsemen, till she came to Athos.\"\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned in Book 16 and elsewhere, primarily as the source of the wood for Achilles' famous spear.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as a mountain in Lydia, home to allies of the Trojans.\n*   **Mount Parnassus:** Mentioned indirectly but clearly in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2). The contingent from Phocis is described as holding \"rocky Pytho,\" the site of Delphi, which lies on the slopes of Mount Parnassus.\n*   **Mount Helicon & Mount Cithaeron:** These are also mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) when describing the lands of the Boeotian contingent.\n\n### Step 2: Find the modern elevations of these mountains.\n\nNext, we look up the official elevations of these real-world mountains to compare them.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** ~2,918 meters (9,573 ft) - *Excluded from the final answer*\n*   **Mount Parnassus:** ~2,457 meters (8,061 ft)\n*   **Mount Tmolus (modern Bozdağ):** ~2,159 meters (7,083 ft)\n*   **Mount Athos:** ~2,033 meters (6,670 ft)\n*   **Mount Ida (modern Kaz Dağı):** ~1,774 meters (5,820 ft)\n*   **Mount Helicon:** ~1,749 meters (5,738 ft)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** ~1,624 meters (5,328 ft)\n*   **Samothrace (Mount Fengari):** ~1,611 meters (5,285 ft)\n*   **Mount Cithaeron:** ~1,409 meters (4,623 ft)\n\n### Step 3: Compare the elevations to find the tallest.\n\nBy arranging the mountains from the previous step (excluding Olympus) in order of height, we can identify the tallest.\n\n1.  **Mount Parnassus** (2,457 m)\n2.  **Mount Tmolus** (2,159 m)\n3.  **Mount Athos** (2,033 m)\n4.  **Mount Ida** (1,774 m)\n5.  **Mount Helicon** (1,749 m)\n6.  **Mount Pelion** (1,624 m)\n7.  **Samothrace (Mount Fengari)** (1,611 m)\n8.  **Mount Cithaeron** (1,409 m)\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Definition of \"Mentioned\":** The question requires the mountain to be \"mentioned.\" This includes direct naming (like Ida and Athos) as well as clear geographical references, such as the mention of \"rocky Pytho\" (Delphi) on the slopes of Parnassus in the Catalogue of Ships.\n*   **Historical vs. Mythical:** All the mountains listed are real geographical locations, satisfying the \"historical\" criteria.\n*   **Exclusion of Olympus:** The question specifically asks for the tallest mountain *after* Mount Olympus, making it a ranking problem where the first-place finisher is predetermined and excluded.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation:\n\nBased on the analysis, after the excluded Mount Olympus (2,918 m), the next tallest mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Parnassus**, with an elevation of approximately 2,457 meters.\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
