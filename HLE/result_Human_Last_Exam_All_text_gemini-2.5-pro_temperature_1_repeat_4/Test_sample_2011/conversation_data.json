    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n\nLet's break down the key terms:\n*   **Graph on n = 128 vertices:** A graph `G` with a vertex set `V` such that `|V| = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. A clique with `k` vertices is denoted as `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `W`, the induced subgraph `G[W]` consists of the vertices `W` and *all* the edges from the original graph `G` that have both endpoints in `W`.\n*   **Clique as an Induced Subgraph:** A set of `k` vertices forms a clique if and only if the subgraph induced by these vertices is a complete graph `K_k`. The phrasing \"appear as induced subgraphs\" is a precise way of defining the cliques we are looking for.\n*   **Different Clique Sizes:** We are not counting the number of cliques, but the number of distinct values of `k` for which a `K_k` exists in the graph. For example, if a graph has cliques of size 2, 3, and 5, the number of different clique sizes is 3.\n*   **Simultaneously Appear:** This means all these different-sized cliques must exist as subgraphs within the *same single graph* `G`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Set of Clique Sizes\nLet `S(G)` be the set of integers `k` for which the graph `G` contains a clique of size `k`. The question asks for the maximum possible value of `|S(G)|` over all graphs `G` with 128 vertices.\n\nA crucial observation is about the structure of the set `S(G)`.\n*   Suppose a graph `G` has a clique of size `k`. Let this clique be formed by a set of `k` vertices, `W`.\n*   By definition of a clique, every vertex in `W` is connected to every other vertex in `W`.\n*   Now, consider any integer `j` such that `1 <= j < k`. We can choose any subset of `W`, let's call it `W'`, with size `j`.\n*   Since all vertices in `W` are pairwise connected, it must be that all vertices in its subset `W'` are also pairwise connected.\n*   This means that `W'` forms a clique of size `j`.\n*   Therefore, if a graph contains a clique of size `k`, it must also contain cliques of all sizes `1, 2, ..., k-1`.\n\nThis leads to a fundamental conclusion: The set of clique sizes `S(G)` for any non-empty graph `G` is always an unbroken sequence of integers starting from 1. That is, `S(G) = {1, 2, 3, ..., m}` for some integer `m`.\n\n### Step 3: Simplifying the Problem\nThe integer `m` in the set `S(G) = {1, 2, ..., m}` is the size of the largest clique in the graph `G`. This is known as the **clique number** of `G`, denoted `ω(G)`.\n\nThe number of different clique sizes is the size of the set `S(G)`, which is `|S(G)| = m = ω(G)`.\n\nSo, the original question \"what is the maximum possible number of different clique sizes?\" is equivalent to the simpler question: \"What is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` on 128 vertices?\".\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Simplified Problem\nWe want to find the maximum value of `ω(G)` for a graph `G` with `n=128` vertices.\n*   A clique is a subset of the vertices of the graph.\n*   Therefore, the size of any clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph.\n*   So, `ω(G) <= n = 128`.\n\nThe maximum possible clique number is 128. We must now show that this maximum is achievable.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing the Graph\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, `K_{128}`. In this graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n*   The total number of vertices is `n=128`.\n*   The largest possible clique in this graph is the set of all 128 vertices itself, so `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n*   Based on our analysis in Step 2, the set of clique sizes in `K_{128}` must be `{1, 2, ..., 128}`.\n*   We can verify this: for any integer `k` from 1 to 128, we can simply pick any `k` vertices from `K_{128}`, and they will form a clique of size `k`.\n*   Therefore, the number of different clique sizes in `K_{128}` is 128.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   The wording \"induced subgraphs\" is technically precise but does not change the problem from the standard understanding of cliques.\n*   The word \"simultaneously\" might mislead one into thinking the cliques for each size must be vertex-disjoint. This would lead to a different problem where one tries to find the largest `m` such that the sum `1 + 2 + ... + m <= 128`, which gives an answer of 15. However, this \"disjointness\" constraint is not stated in the problem. The correct interpretation is that the cliques must all exist in the same graph, which is true for `K_{128}` where smaller cliques are sub-cliques of larger ones.\n*   The core of the problem lies in the property that the set of clique sizes is always `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`. This transforms the problem into finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph on `n` vertices, which is simply `n`.\n\nThe maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
