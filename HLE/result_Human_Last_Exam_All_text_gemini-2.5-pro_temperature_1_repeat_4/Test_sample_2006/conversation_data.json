    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Core Question**\n\nThe prompt states that the title of the haiku, \"The Bays\", is a question. The structure of riddles often involves puns or wordplay. \"The Bays\" is phonetically similar to \"Thebes\", the ancient Greek city famous for its tragic myths. This pun is the primary key to solving the riddle. The question being asked is, \"What is the subject of this haiku?\" with the answer being Thebes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Haiku as a Set of Clues**\n\nThe haiku's three lines must serve as clues that confirm the answer is \"Thebes\". We need to interpret each line metaphorically in the context of Theban mythology, particularly the story of Oedipus.\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** \"August\" should be interpreted not as the month, but as the adjective meaning \"majestic, grand, venerable.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This line refers to the majestic and terrible storm of tragedy that engulfs the city of Thebes and the royal family in the story of Oedipus (patricide, incest, plague, and downfall).\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** \"Twice fifteen\" is a calculation: 2 * 15 = 30. This number is a clue.\n    *   **Analysis:** The number 30 can be linked to the age of a person in their prime. In the famous Riddle of the Sphinx (a core part of the Theban myth), the answer is \"Man,\" who walks on two legs at the height of his power, or his \"noon.\" Reaching this stage of life (symbolized here by the age of 30) represents a significant \"wind of change\" from childhood. Oedipus's solving of this riddle brought a massive \"wind of change\" to Thebes, as it freed them from the Sphinx but also led to him becoming king, thus fulfilling the tragic prophecy.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** \"Divine one\" refers to a supernatural or god-like being. \"Yields\" means to give way, surrender, or produce.\n    *   **Analysis:** This directly refers to the Sphinx, a monstrous creature with divine parentage, who \"yields\" (gives up and dies) when Oedipus correctly answers her riddle. It can also refer to the Oracle at Delphi, a divine source, which \"yields\" the prophecy that drives the entire tragedy.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues to Form the Answer**\n\nThe haiku's lines cohesively describe the mythology of Thebes. Therefore, the answer to the question posed by the title (\"The Bays\") is **THEBES**.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Final Instruction**\n\nThe prompt asks for the answer to be put \"in alphabetical order\".\n\n*   The answer is the word: **THEBES**\n*   The letters are: T, H, E, B, E, S\n*   Arranging these letters alphabetically, we get: B, E, E, H, S, T\n\nThus, the final answer is BEEHST.\n\n<<<BEEHST>>>"
