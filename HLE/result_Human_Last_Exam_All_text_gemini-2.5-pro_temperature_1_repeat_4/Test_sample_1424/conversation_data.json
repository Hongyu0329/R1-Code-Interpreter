    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Feynman Path Integral:** This formalism describes quantum mechanics and quantum field theory by summing over all possible \"histories\" or \"paths\" a system can take. Each path is weighted by a phase factor $e^{iS/\\hbar}$, where $S$ is the classical action of that path.\n*   **Green's Function (Propagator):** In this context, the Green's function $G(x, t; x', t')$ gives the probability amplitude for a particle to propagate from a starting spacetime point $(x', t')$ to a final point $(x, t)$.\n*   **Bare Green's Function ($G_0$):** This is a specific case of the Green's function that describes a **non-interacting** particle. It is calculated using the \"free\" or \"bare\" action ($S_0$), which contains no interaction terms.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$):** These are the energy levels of a single, free particle. They are the eigenvalues of the non-interacting Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_0$. For a free particle in space, these are typically dependent on momentum, e.g., $\\epsilon_k = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral**\n\nThe two-point Green's function is defined as the vacuum expectation value of time-ordered fields. Using the path integral, this is expressed as:\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x, t) \\psi^*(x', t') e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]/\\hbar}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]/\\hbar}}$\n\nThe crucial element here is the **non-interacting action, $S_0$**. For a system of non-relativistic particles, $S_0$ has the form:\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x, t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0 \\right) \\psi(x, t)$\nwhere $\\hat{H}_0$ is the free Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues are $\\epsilon_k$. Because $S_0$ is quadratic in the fields $\\psi$ and $\\psi^*$, the path integral is a Gaussian integral and can be solved exactly.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Calculation by Transforming to the Energy-Momentum Basis**\n\nThe calculation becomes much simpler if we switch from the position-time basis $(x, t)$ to the energy-momentum basis $(k, \\omega)$ using a Fourier transform. In this basis, the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$ is diagonal, and its action on a state with momentum $k$ is simply multiplication by the eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The derivative operator $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ also becomes a simple multiplication by $\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe action in this new basis takes on a simple algebraic form:\n$S_0 = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\sum_k \\psi^*(k, \\omega) \\left( \\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k \\right) \\psi(k, \\omega)$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Gaussian Integral**\n\nThe path integral for the Green's function in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is now a standard Gaussian integral. The result of such an integral is simply the inverse of the quadratic operator in the action.\nThe quadratic operator (the kernel) is the term in the parentheses: $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\nTherefore, the Green's function is its inverse. However, to ensure causality and define how to handle the singularity when $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$, a small imaginary part, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), must be included. This arises naturally from the path integral's convergence properties.\n\nThe Feynman (time-ordered) bare Green's function in the energy-momentum basis is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k/\\hbar + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - E_F)}$\n(Setting $\\hbar=1$ and considering the retarded Green's function for simplicity, the form is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Functional Dependence**\n\nFrom the final expression in Step 4, we can directly see the functional dependence. The bare Green's function $G_0$, when represented in the basis of energy eigenstates, is **inversely proportional** to the difference between the energy (frequency) variable $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$\n\nThis inverse relationship means that $G_0$ has a **simple pole** on the complex energy plane at the energy of the single-particle state, $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. This pole is the mathematical signature of a stable, freely propagating particle with that energy.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Interacting:** This analysis is only for the *bare* Green's function ($G_0$) and the *non-interacting* action ($S_0$). The full interacting Green's function ($G$) has a similar structure, but $\\epsilon_k$ is replaced by a complex, energy-dependent quantity that includes the self-energy, which accounts for all interactions.\n2.  **Choice of Basis:** The simple inverse relationship is only evident in the energy-momentum basis where the free Hamiltonian is diagonal.\n3.  **The $i\\eta$ Factor:** This infinitesimal term is crucial for defining the propagator correctly. It enforces causality by dictating how to integrate around the pole, ensuring that effects do not precede their causes.\n4.  **Real vs. Imaginary Time:** The analysis can also be done in the imaginary-time (Matsubara) formalism, common in statistical mechanics. The result is analogous: $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$, where $i\\omega_n$ are discrete Matsubara frequencies. The fundamental inverse dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ remains the same.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ in the energy-momentum representation has a functional form that is **inversely proportional** to the difference between the frequency variable ($\\omega$) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ($\\epsilon_k$). Specifically, for a given momentum $k$ and frequency $\\omega$, the relationship is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta (\\text{prescription})}$\n\nThis means $G_0$ has a simple pole at the energy of the free particle, $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ as an inverse relationship, typically expressed in the form $G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$.>>>"
