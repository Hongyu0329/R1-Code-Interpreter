    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\n*   **\"Historical saints\"**: This term requires careful definition in the context of Milton. It generally refers to figures recognized as saints by major Christian traditions (like the Catholic Church) who lived after the Apostolic Age. However, it can also include the apostles themselves, who are both biblical and historical figures. Milton, being a Protestant with strong anti-Catholic sentiments, is unlikely to mention such figures in a purely venerating way.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: The saint's specific name (e.g., \"Peter,\" \"Francis\") or a direct, unmistakable derivative (e.g., \"Franciscan\") must be present in the text. A general reference to \"saints\" or \"apostles\" is not sufficient.\n*   **\"Milton's Paradise Lost\"**: The search must be confined strictly to the text of this epic poem.\n\n### Step 2: Locating Potential Passages\n\nMilton's most direct engagement with what he considered the corruptions of the post-biblical church occurs in his description of the \"Limbo of Vanity,\" also known as the \"Paradise of Fools,\" in Book III of the epic. This is the most logical place to find references to Catholic saints. Other potential locations, like Michael's prophecy of future history in Books XI and XII, tend to use general terms rather than specific names.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Key Passage (Book III, lines 474-497)\n\nIn this section, Milton describes a \"limbo\" where all vain and foolish things—and people—end up. He explicitly targets Catholic monastic orders and practices.\n\n1.  **Saint Dominic:** In Book III, line 479, Milton describes those who, hoping for an easy path to heaven, choose to be buried in the habit of a monk:\n    > \"Dying put on the weeds of **Dominic**,\"\n    This is a direct and explicit mention of **Saint Dominic de Guzmán** (c. 1170–1221), the founder of the Dominican Order (the \"Black Friars\").\n\n2.  **Saint Francis:** Immediately following the line about Dominic, Milton refers to another major monastic founder in Book III, line 480:\n    > \"Or in **Franciscan** think to pass disguised,\"\n    While the name \"Francis\" is not used, \"Franciscan\" is a direct adjectival reference to **Saint Francis of Assisi** (c. 1181–1226) and his order (the \"Grey Friars\"). The reference is unmistakable and serves the same purpose as naming him directly. It is a mention by name of his established identity.\n\n3.  **Saint Peter:** A few lines later, Milton mocks the same deluded souls who believe they are about to enter Heaven. In Book III, line 484, he writes:\n    > \"And now **Saint Peter** at Heaven's wicket seems / To wait them with his keys...\"\n    This is an explicit mention of the Apostle **Saint Peter**, a foundational figure in both the Bible and Church history, and the first Pope in Catholic tradition. Milton specifically uses the title \"Saint.\"\n\n### Step 4: Searching for Other Candidates\n\nA thorough search of the text of *Paradise Lost* reveals no other figures who fit the category of \"historical saint mentioned by name.\"\n\n*   **The Virgin Mary:** She is alluded to as \"the Virgin\" and \"second Eve\" but is never referred to by the name \"Mary.\"\n*   **Other Apostles:** No other apostles, such as Paul or John, are mentioned by name. (While some critical analyses compare Milton's poetic vision to that of John of Patmos, Milton himself does not name him in the poem).\n*   **Church Fathers and Other Saints:** Figures like Augustine, Jerome, George, or Patrick are not mentioned.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the textual evidence found exclusively within the \"Paradise of Fools\" passage in Book III, Milton mentions exactly three historical saints by name or by a direct, unmistakable derivative of their name. All are mentioned in a critical or satirical context.\n\nThe historical saints are:\n1.  **Dominic**\n2.  **Francis** (as \"Franciscan\")\n3.  **Peter** (as \"Saint Peter\")\n\n<<<3>>>"
