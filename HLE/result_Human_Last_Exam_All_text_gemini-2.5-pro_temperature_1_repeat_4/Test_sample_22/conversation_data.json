    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the key concepts**\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A PGS is a score calculated for an individual that summarizes their estimated genetic predisposition for a particular trait or disease. It is constructed as a weighted sum of their genotypes at many different Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The weights used in this sum are the effect sizes estimated from a large-scale Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n*   **Predictive Ability of a Polygenic Score:** This measures how well the PGS can predict an individual's actual phenotype (the trait or disease status). It is commonly quantified using R-squared (R²), which represents the proportion of the total variance in the phenotype that can be explained by the PGS. This is always evaluated in a sample of individuals that is independent of the GWAS sample used to derive the weights.\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population parameter that represents the proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is explained by the additive effects of all the SNPs being considered, typically all common SNPs on a genotyping array. It is a theoretical upper limit on how much of the trait's variance can be predicted using only SNP information, assuming we knew the *true* effect size of every SNP.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between PGS predictive ability and SNP heritability**\n\nThe core of the question is the relationship between a practical measure (PGS predictive ability) and a theoretical maximum (SNP heritability).\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability is the Ceiling:** SNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the total amount of \"signal\" available in the SNPs for predicting the phenotype. It's the maximum possible R² you could achieve if you had a perfect predictive model. A perfect model would mean knowing the true causal effect of every single SNP.\n\n2.  **Polygenic Scores are Imperfect Models:** A PGS is a practical attempt to build such a predictive model. However, it is inherently imperfect for several reasons:\n    *   **Estimation Error:** The weights (effect sizes) for the PGS are *estimated* from a GWAS with a finite number of participants. These estimates are not the true effect sizes; they contain \"noise\" or estimation error. The smaller the GWAS sample size, the greater this error. This noise directly reduces the predictive accuracy of the resulting PGS.\n    *   **Incomplete Information:** Not all causal SNPs may be included on the genotyping arrays used for the GWAS or the prediction sample.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** GWAS often identifies a \"tag SNP\" that is merely correlated with the true causal SNP. If the LD pattern differs between the GWAS population and the prediction population, the predictive power will decrease.\n\n3.  **Comparing the Practical to the Theoretical:** Because the PGS is built with imperfect (noisy) information, its ability to explain variance (its R²) must be less than the total variance that is theoretically possible to explain (the h²_SNP). The estimation error in the SNP effect sizes guarantees that the predictive power of the PGS will be degraded relative to the theoretical maximum.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the word \"necessarily\"**\n\nThe statement claims the predictive ability is *necessarily* lower. This implies there are no exceptions.\n\n*   Could the PGS predictive ability (R²) ever equal the SNP heritability (h²_SNP)? This would only be possible in a theoretical scenario where the discovery GWAS had an infinite sample size. In that case, the estimated effect sizes would converge to the true effect sizes, and the PGS would become a perfect predictor (within the limits of an additive SNP model).\n*   Since any real-world GWAS has a finite sample size, any real-world PGS will be based on imperfect estimates. Therefore, for any practically constructed PGS, its predictive ability will be lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe SNP heritability sets the theoretical upper bound for prediction based on SNPs. The polygenic score is a practical tool that attempts to reach this bound. Due to unavoidable limitations, most notably the estimation error of SNP effects from finite-sized studies, the PGS will always fall short of this theoretical maximum. Therefore, its predictive ability (variance explained) is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
