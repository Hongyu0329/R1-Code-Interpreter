    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Find the \"rule activation level\".\n    *   **Context:** The system uses an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS).\n    *   **Given Data:**\n        *   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n        *   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n    *   **Operation:** A t-norm operation is used.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Fuzzy Rule:** A fuzzy rule typically has the structure: `IF [antecedent condition] THEN [consequent conclusion]`. For example, `Rule k: IF x is F_k THEN y is G_k`.\n    *   **Rule Activation Level (or Firing Strength):** This is the degree to which the antecedent part (the \"IF\" part) of the rule is satisfied by a given input. It is a value that quantifies the truth of the premise.\n    *   **Antecedent:** The \"IF\" part of the rule. In this case, it involves the input `x'`.\n    *   **Consequent:** The \"THEN\" part of the rule. In this case, it involves the output fuzzy set `G_k`.\n    *   **t-norm:** A function (like `min` or `product`) used to model the logical \"AND\" operator, which combines the membership values of multiple conditions in the antecedent.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Provided Symbols:**\n    *   `Phi_k(x′)`: This notation, `Φ_k(x')`, is standard for representing the **firing strength** or **rule activation level** of the k-th rule for a specific input `x'`. It is the result of evaluating the antecedent part of the rule.\n    *   `μG_k_j(y_j)`: This notation, `μ_{G_{k,j}}(y_j)`, represents the membership degree of a value `y_j` in the **consequent** fuzzy set `G_{k,j}`. This value is used in the later stages of the fuzzy inference process (implication and aggregation), not for calculating the initial rule activation.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"rule activation level\".\n    *   The problem states that `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. By definition, `Phi_k(x′)` *is* the rule activation level.\n    *   The mention of the \"t-norm operation\" describes *how* `Phi_k(x′)` would be calculated if we were given the membership values of the input `x'` in the antecedent fuzzy sets. However, we are already given the final result of this operation.\n    *   The value `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9` relates to the consequent part of the rule and is therefore not relevant to calculating the activation level of the antecedent. It is extraneous information for this specific question.\n    *   The context of \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\" adds complexity to the overall system, but the fundamental definition of rule activation level (the degree to which the antecedent is true) remains the same. The question simplifies this by providing a single, crisp value for the activation level.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguish Antecedent from Consequent:** The most crucial point is to recognize that the rule activation level depends only on the antecedent (\"IF\" part), while `μG_k_j(y_j)` belongs to the consequent (\"THEN\" part).\n*   **Recognize Standard Notation:** Knowing that `Φ_k(x')` is the standard symbol for firing strength or rule activation level directly leads to the answer.\n*   **Identify Extraneous Information:** The value `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9` is designed to be a distractor. It is not needed to answer the question.\n*   **Understand the Role of the t-norm:** The t-norm is the operation used to *calculate* the activation level from its constituent parts. Since the final activation level is already given, we do not need to perform any calculation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rule activation level is the value representing the firing strength of the rule's antecedent. The problem provides this value directly as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. The other information is not needed for this specific calculation.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
