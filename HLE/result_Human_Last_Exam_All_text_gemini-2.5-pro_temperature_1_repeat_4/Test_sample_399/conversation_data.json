    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis equation is a **separable differential equation** because we can group all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other side.\n\n**2. Separate the variables.**\nTo separate the variables, we move all $x$ terms (including $dx$) to one side and all $t$ terms (including $dt$) to the other side.\n$$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt $$\n**Careful Point:** When we divide by $x^2$, we implicitly assume that $x \\neq 0$. We should check if $x(t) = 0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. Plugging this into the original equation gives $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is $0=0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant (or equilibrium) solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the solution we are looking for is not the constant solution $x(t)=0$, and our separation step is valid.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides of the equation.**\nNow we integrate both sides:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   The left-hand side: $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n*   The right-hand side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$\n\nCombining these results and adding a constant of integration, $C$, to one side gives the general solution in implicit form:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C.**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution to solve for $C$.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\n**5. Write the particular solution for the initial value problem.**\nNow that we have the value of $C$, we can write the equation for the particular solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Solve for the required value, x(1).**\nThe problem asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can find this by substituting $t=1$ into our particular solution equation.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo simplify the right-hand side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nNow, we can solve for $x(1)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
