The edges of the image will become smoother and straighter over time. Any edges that form closed loops (i.e., the boundaries of finite objects) will contract and eventually disappear, causing the objects they enclose to vanish. The process will stop when the image becomes uniform (all black or all white) or is partitioned by one or more perfectly straight lines that extend across the entire image.
