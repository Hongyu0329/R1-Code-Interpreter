    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Connection between Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics**\n\nThe question asks to use the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems from Large Deviation Theory (LDT) provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics.\n\n*   **Core Idea of LDT:** LDT describes the probabilities of rare events. For a large number of trials or particles ($N \\to \\infty$), the probability of observing an empirical average or distribution that deviates from the expected one decreases exponentially. This probability is given by $P(\\text{deviation}) \\approx e^{-N \\cdot I(\\text{deviation})}$, where $I$ is the \"rate function\".\n*   **Equilibrium State:** In statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state. According to LDT, this corresponds to the state that minimizes the rate function $I$.\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem deals with the empirical distribution (or \"type\") of a sequence of random variables. It states that the probability of observing an empirical distribution $Q$ when the true underlying distribution is $P$ is approximately $e^{-N \\cdot D_{KL}(Q||P)}$, where $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem deals with the empirical mean of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables. It gives a rate function for the probability that the empirical mean deviates from the true mean. This rate function is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the log-moment generating function.\n*   **Connection to Entropy:** The fundamental insight is that the rate function ($I$) from LDT is directly related to the thermodynamic entropy ($S$). For a system where all microstates are a priori equally likely, the probability of a macrostate is proportional to the number of microstates $\\Omega$ corresponding to it. Since $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$, the probability is proportional to $e^{S/k_B}$. Comparing this to the LDT form $e^{-NI}$, we can identify the rate function with $-S/(N k_B)$. Therefore, **minimizing the rate function subject to physical constraints is equivalent to maximizing the entropy subject to the same constraints.**\n\nThis connection allows us to use the well-established method of maximizing entropy to find the equilibrium state, with the LDT theorems providing the formal justification.\n\n**2. Modeling the System: A Gas of Photons**\n\n*   **Particles:** Photons are bosons, meaning any number of them can occupy the same quantum state. They obey Bose-Einstein statistics.\n*   **Constraint 1: Mean Energy:** The system has a well-defined temperature $T$, which means it is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath. This fixes the average total energy $U$. The constraint is $\\sum_j \\bar{n}_j \\epsilon_j = U$, where $\\bar{n}_j$ is the average number of photons in the state with energy $\\epsilon_j$.\n*   **Constraint 2: Particle Number:** Photons can be created and absorbed by the walls of their container. This means the total number of photons $N = \\sum_j \\bar{n}_j$ is not conserved. In the language of the grand canonical ensemble, this corresponds to a chemical potential $\\mu=0$.\n\n**3. Maximizing Entropy to Find the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nThe entropy for a gas of bosons distributed among energy levels (where $g_j$ is the degeneracy of level $j$) is given by:\n$S = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (n_j + g_j - 1)\\ln(n_j + g_j - 1) - n_j\\ln n_j - (g_j - 1)\\ln(g_j - 1) \\right]$\nUsing Stirling's approximation for large numbers, this simplifies to:\n$S \\approx k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (n_j + g_j)\\ln(n_j + g_j) - n_j\\ln n_j - g_j\\ln g_j \\right]$\n\nWe need to maximize this entropy $S$ subject to the constraint of fixed mean energy $U = \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j$. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers, maximizing the quantity $\\mathcal{L} = S/k_B - \\beta (U - \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j)$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $n_j$ and setting to zero gives:\n$\\frac{\\partial (S/k_B)}{\\partial n_j} - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_j+g_j}{n_j}\\right) - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0 \\implies 1 + \\frac{g_j}{n_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$\nThis yields the equilibrium occupation number $\\bar{n}_j$:\n$\\bar{n}_j = \\frac{g_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. This is the **Planck distribution law**.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**\n\nTo get a concrete value for the total energy $U$, we must sum $\\bar{n}_j \\epsilon_j$ over all possible states. For photons in a 3D box of volume $V$, the states are continuous, so we replace the sum with an integral. The number of states (degeneracy) $g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon$ in an energy interval $d\\epsilon$ is:\n$g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{V \\epsilon^2}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} d\\epsilon$\n(This includes a factor of 2 for the two polarization states of the photon).\n\nThe mean energy $U$ is:\n$U = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot \\bar{n}(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} \\cdot g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon$\n$U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n\nThis is a standard integral. By substituting $x = \\beta \\epsilon$, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi^4}{15 \\beta^4}$.\n$U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15 \\beta^4} = \\frac{V \\pi^2}{15 (\\hbar c)^3 \\beta^4}$\nSubstituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, we get the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**:\n$U(V,T) = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4$\n\n**5. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nWe can calculate the entropy using the thermodynamic relation for a system with $\\mu=0$: $F = U - TS$, where $F$ is the Helmholtz free energy. So, $S = (U-F)/T$.\n\nThe free energy is given by $F = -k_B T \\ln Z_{GC}$, where $Z_{GC}$ is the grand canonical partition function.\n$\\ln Z_{GC} = -\\sum_j g_j \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j})$\nAgain, we convert the sum to an integral:\n$\\ln Z_{GC} = -\\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^2 \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) d\\epsilon$\n\nIntegrating by parts shows that this integral is related to the one for energy, and we find:\n$\\ln Z_{GC} = \\frac{V \\pi^2}{45 (\\hbar c)^3 \\beta^3}$\nSo, the free energy is:\n$F = -k_B T \\ln Z_{GC} = -\\frac{V \\pi^2 k_B T}{45 (\\hbar c)^3 \\beta^3} = -\\frac{V \\pi^2 (k_B T)^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3}$\n\nComparing $F$ and $U$, we see that $F = -U/3$.\nNow we can find the entropy:\n$S = \\frac{U-F}{T} = \\frac{U - (-U/3)}{T} = \\frac{4U}{3T}$\nSubstituting the expression for $U$:\n$S(V,T) = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4 \\right) = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T are:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n    $U(V,T) = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4$\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n    $S(V,T) = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $U(V,T) = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S(V,T) = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\n>>>"
