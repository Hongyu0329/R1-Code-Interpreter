    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify the most probable molecular mechanism that explains two key outcomes after a gene duplication event in eukaryotes:\n1.  **Retention:** The duplicate gene is kept in the genome over evolutionary time instead of being lost.\n2.  **Divergence:** The two gene copies (the original and the duplicate) accumulate mutations and become different from each other in sequence and/or function.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene copy is \"rewritten\" using the other copy as a template. This makes the two genes more similar, or even identical. Gene conversion leads to homogenization, which is the *opposite* of divergence. Therefore, it does not explain how duplicate genes become different.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicate gene. The duplicate copy accumulates mutations that render it non-functional (a pseudogene). While this involves divergence (the sequence changes as it degrades), it represents a *failure* to retain a functional gene. The question implies the retention of functional, diverging genes. So, this is a mechanism of gene loss, not retention in a functional sense.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the original function, while the duplicate copy accumulates mutations that lead to a completely new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Retention:** The new beneficial function is favored by natural selection, ensuring the duplicate gene is kept. The original gene is also kept for its essential role.\n    *   **Divergence:** The accumulation of mutations to create the new function inherently causes the duplicate gene to diverge from the original.\n    *   This is a valid and important mechanism, but it relies on the occurrence of a rare, beneficial, gain-of-function mutation before the duplicate is silenced by more common degenerative mutations.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or expression patterns (subfunctions). After duplication, each copy accumulates different degenerative mutations, causing each to lose a different subset of the original subfunctions.\n    *   **Retention:** Because each copy now only performs a part of the original essential functions, both copies are required to be maintained to carry out the complete ancestral role. This provides a strong selective pressure for retaining both.\n    *   **Divergence:** The degenerative mutations that partition the functions cause the gene copies to diverge in their sequence and regulatory elements.\n    *   This is a highly plausible mechanism because it relies on common, neutral, or slightly deleterious mutations rather than rare beneficial ones. This provides a passive way to preserve both gene copies immediately after duplication, increasing their chances of long-term survival.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern describing the rapid diversification of species to fill new ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a mechanism of gene evolution at the molecular level within a single genome. It describes a consequence, not the cause.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Plausible Mechanisms (C and D)**\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models that explain both the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the \"*most likely*\" mechanism.\n\n*   **Likelihood:** The primary challenge for a newly duplicated gene is to avoid being lost via pseudogenization. Subfunctionalization provides a path to retention based on common degenerative mutations. In contrast, neofunctionalization requires a rare beneficial mutation to occur. From a probabilistic standpoint, it is more likely that common degenerative mutations will occur and partition functions, thus \"locking in\" both copies, than it is for a rare beneficial mutation to arise and create a new function immediately.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Because it provides a more common and passive route to preserving duplicate genes, subfunctionalization is considered by many evolutionary biologists to be a more frequent, and thus \"most likely,\" initial mechanism for the retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the analysis, subfunctionalization is the most likely mechanism because it provides a more common and immediate pathway for the retention of both gene copies following a duplication event, allowing for their subsequent divergence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
