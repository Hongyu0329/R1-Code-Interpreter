    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category from an object $A$ to an object $B$ consists of a pair of 1-morphisms $L: A \\to B$ and $R: B \\to A$, along with 2-morphisms (unit and counit) $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_B$ satisfying the triangle identities.\n\nHere, the 2-category is the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of the category of posets $\\mathsf{Pos}$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Objects and Morphisms in $\\Delta$**:\n    *   **Objects**: The objects are finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. In this problem, the objects are $A = [23]$ and $B = [37]$.\n    *   **1-morphisms**: A 1-morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$. So, $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$ are order-preserving maps.\n    *   **2-morphisms**: For two parallel 1-morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism $f \\Rightarrow g$ exists if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the Adjunction Conditions**:\n    *   The unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ translates to the condition that for all $i \\in [23]$, $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$, which means $i \\le R(L(i))$.\n    *   The counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$ translates to the condition that for all $j \\in [37]$, $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$, which means $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n\n3.  **Connection to Poset Adjunctions (Galois Connections)**:\n    The two conditions $i \\le R(L(i))$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$ are precisely the conditions that define an adjunction between the posets $[23]$ and $[37]$, where $L$ is the left adjoint to $R$ (denoted $L \\dashv R$). This is equivalent to the more common definition of a poset adjunction: for all $i \\in [23]$ and $j \\in [37]$, $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$. The triangle identities for the adjunction are also automatically satisfied given these conditions. Thus, we need to count the number of such adjoint pairs $(L, R)$.\n\n4.  **Characterizing Adjoints between Finite Ordinals**:\n    An adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint.\n    *   A map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (suprema). For totally ordered sets, this is equivalent to preserving the bottom element (the join of the empty set). So, $L$ must map the bottom element of $[23]$ to the bottom element of $[37]$. This means $L(0) = 0$. Any order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ with $L(0)=0$ has a unique right adjoint $R$.\n    *   Dually, a map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all meets (infima). This is equivalent to preserving the top element (the meet of the empty set). So, $R$ must map the top element of $[37]$ to the top element of $[23]$. This means $R(37) = 23$. Any order-preserving map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ with $R(37)=23$ has a unique left adjoint $L$.\n\n    Therefore, the number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is equal to the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ satisfying $L(0)=0$.\n\n5.  **Counting the Maps**:\n    We need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\n    An order-preserving map $L$ is determined by the sequence of its values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$. The condition is that $0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n    The constraint $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. So we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $L(1), L(2), \\dots, L(23)$ of length 23, where each value is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\n    This is a classic stars-and-bars combinatorics problem. We are choosing 23 numbers (the values $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from the set of $37+1=38$ possibilities with replacement, and the order of selection doesn't matter as they will be arranged uniquely into a non-decreasing sequence.\n    This is equivalent to choosing $k=23$ items from $n=38$ types, which is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n    $$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n    Alternatively, we can think of this as counting the number of order-preserving maps from $[22]$ (for the inputs $1, \\dots, 23$) to $[37]$. Using the standard formula for the number of morphisms from $[m]$ to $[n]$ in $\\Delta$, which is $\\binom{n+m+1}{m+1}$, we set $m=22$ and $n=37$:\n    $$ |\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\Delta}([22], [37])| = \\binom{37+22+1}{22+1} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n    As a check, we can use the dual characterization: counting order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ with $R(37)=23$. This requires choosing a non-decreasing sequence $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ from $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$. This is equivalent to counting order-preserving maps from $[36]$ to $[23]$. Using the formula with $m=36, n=23$:\n    $$ |\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\Delta}([36], [23])| = \\binom{23+36+1}{36+1} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\n    Since $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$, both methods yield the same result.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<\"\"\"$\\binom{60}{23}$\"\"\"\n>>>"
