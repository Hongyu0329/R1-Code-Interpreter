    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecular formula and atom count.**\nThe molecule is toluene, and its chemical formula is C₇H₈.\nThis means the molecule contains:\n*   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a type of split-valence basis set developed by Pople's group. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented by basis functions. We need to analyze it separately for heavy atoms (Carbon) and for Hydrogen.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of contracted functions for each Carbon (C) atom.**\nFor a heavy atom like Carbon, the 6-31G notation is interpreted as follows:\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the core orbitals. The 1s core orbital of Carbon is represented by a single **contracted** Gaussian function (CGF). This single function is constructed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   Core functions = 1 CGF\n*   **`-31`**: This part describes the valence orbitals (2s and 2p for Carbon). It indicates that the valence shell is \"split\" into two basis functions for each atomic orbital.\n    *   The first number, `3`, represents the \"inner\" part of the valence shell. This part is described by one set of contracted functions, each built from 3 PGFs. For Carbon, this includes one s-type function and three p-type functions (px, py, pz).\n        *   Inner valence functions = 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = 4 CGFs\n    *   The second number, `1`, represents the \"outer\" part of the valence shell. This part is described by another set of contracted functions, each built from 1 PGF (meaning they are uncontracted primitive functions). This also includes one s-type function and three p-type functions.\n        *   Outer valence functions = 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = 4 CGFs\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:**\n    *   Total CGFs per C = (Core functions) + (Inner valence functions) + (Outer valence functions)\n    *   Total CGFs per C = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 contracted functions.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of contracted functions for each Hydrogen (H) atom.**\nHydrogen atoms only have a 1s valence orbital and no core electrons. Therefore, the `6-` part of the notation does not apply. The basis set for Hydrogen is effectively `31G`.\n*   **`31`**: This indicates the 1s valence orbital is split into two basis functions.\n    *   The `3` means the inner part of the valence 1s orbital is represented by one contracted function made from 3 PGFs.\n        *   Inner valence function = 1 CGF\n    *   The `1` means the outer part of the valence 1s orbital is represented by one function made from 1 PGF.\n        *   Outer valence function = 1 CGF\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Total CGFs per H = 1 + 1 = 2 contracted functions.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of contracted functions for toluene (C₇H₈).**\nNow we combine the results from the previous steps with the atom count.\n*   Total functions from Carbon = (Number of C atoms) × (Functions per C atom)\n    *   7 × 9 = 63 contracted functions\n*   Total functions from Hydrogen = (Number of H atoms) × (Functions per H atom)\n    *   8 × 2 = 16 contracted functions\n*   **Total for C₇H₈:**\n    *   Total CGFs = (Functions from C) + (Functions from H)\n    *   Total CGFs = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Atom Count:** Ensure the correct number of atoms for each element in the molecule (7 C, 8 H for toluene).\n2.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** Correctly interpret the Pople notation `X-YZG`. The hyphen separates the core from the valence description.\n3.  **Heavy vs. Light Atoms:** Remember that the interpretation is different for heavy atoms (like C) and Hydrogen. Hydrogen has no core orbitals, so the `X-` prefix is ignored for it.\n4.  **Valence Shell:** For Carbon, the valence shell includes both 2s and 2p orbitals. The split-valence description (`-31`) applies to all of them (one s-orbital and three p-orbitals).\n5.  **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question asks for the number of **contracted** functions, not the total number of primitive Gaussians. Our calculation correctly counts the final basis functions used in the calculation.\n\n### Final Calculation Summary\n*   Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   Total Contracted Gaussian Functions = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
