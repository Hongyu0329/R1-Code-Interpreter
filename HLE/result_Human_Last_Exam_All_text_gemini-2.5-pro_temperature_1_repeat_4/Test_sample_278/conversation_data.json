    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parametric Curve**\n\nThe curve is defined by the equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b \\sin t$\nfor the interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThe parameter `b` is defined piecewise:\n*   $b = 1$ when $t \\in [0, \\pi]$\n*   $b = 5$ when $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$\n\nThis means the curve is made of two different parts.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Part of the Curve**\n\nFor $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the equations are:\n*   $x = \\cos t$\n*   $y = 1 \\cdot \\sin t = \\sin t$\n\nIn this interval, we can see that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of a unit circle.\n*   At $t=0$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n*   At $t=\\pi/2$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos(\\pi/2), \\sin(\\pi/2)) = (0, 1)$.\n*   At $t=\\pi$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\nSince $\\sin t \\ge 0$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, this part of the curve is the **upper semi-circle** of radius 1, centered at the origin.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Part of the Curve**\n\nFor $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the equations are:\n*   $x = \\cos t$\n*   $y = 5 \\sin t$\n\nIn this interval, we can see that $(\\frac{x}{1})^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a semi-horizontal axis of 1 and a semi-vertical axis of 5.\n*   As $t$ approaches $\\pi$ from the right, the point is $(x, y) \\to (\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n*   At $t=3\\pi/2$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos(3\\pi/2), 5\\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n*   As $t$ approaches $2\\pi$, the point is $(x, y) \\to (\\cos(2\\pi), 5\\sin(2\\pi)) = (1, 0)$.\nSince $\\sin t \\le 0$ for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, this part of the curve is the **lower semi-ellipse**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Bounding Box of the Entire Figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for $x$ and $y$. This will define the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **Range of x:** For the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, the x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$. The maximum value of $\\cos t$ is 1, and the minimum value is -1.\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$\n    *   The total width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Range of y:** We need to consider both parts.\n    *   In the first part ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y = \\sin t$. The maximum value is 1 (at $t=\\pi/2$) and the minimum is 0.\n    *   In the second part ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y = 5\\sin t$. The minimum value is $5 \\times (-1) = -5$ (at $t=3\\pi/2$) and the maximum is 0.\n    *   Combining the ranges, the overall maximum value for y is 1, and the overall minimum value is -5.\n    *   $y_{max} = 1$\n    *   $y_{min} = -5$\n    *   The total height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Smallest Enclosing Square**\n\nThe figure fits inside a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. A square that encloses this rectangle must have a side length at least as large as the longest dimension of the rectangle.\n\n*   Side length of the square, $s \\ge \\text{width}$ (i.e., $s \\ge 2$)\n*   Side length of the square, $s \\ge \\text{height}$ (i.e., $s \\ge 6$)\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible side length for the enclosing square is $s = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Area of the Square**\n\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $A = s^2$.\n*   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The parameter `b` changes, creating a composite figure, not a simple ellipse or circle.\n*   The range of `t` for each piece must be carefully considered to determine which part of the shape is being drawn (e.g., upper vs. lower half).\n*   The side of the smallest enclosing square is determined by the larger of the figure's total width and total height.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n1.  Width of the figure = $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n2.  Height of the figure = $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n3.  Side of the smallest enclosing square = $\\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n4.  Area of the square = $(\\text{side})^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
