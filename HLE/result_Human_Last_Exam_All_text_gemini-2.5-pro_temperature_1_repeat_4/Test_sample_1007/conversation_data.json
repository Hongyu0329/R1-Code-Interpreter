    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends with the same leg position as it began. The \"leg position\" refers to which foot is in front in a closed position like the fifth position. We will assume a standard starting position of the right foot in front in the fifth position (RFF).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position, right foot front (RFF).\n    *   **Movement:** This is a vertical jump from two feet where the legs beat six times. The counting of beats can be complex, but the outcome is standard. An *entrechat* with an even number that is not a multiple of four (like two, six, ten) results in a change of feet.\n        *   The dancer jumps from fifth (RFF).\n        *   The legs open and beat, changing their front/back relationship multiple times.\n        *   The landing occurs in the opposite fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, left foot front (LFF).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position, right foot front (RFF).\n    *   **Movement:** This step has three key parts:\n        *   *Échappé*: \"Escaped.\" A jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second).\n        *   *Battu*: \"Beaten.\" The legs beat together before opening.\n        *   *Changé*: \"Changed.\" This explicitly indicates that the feet will change their position upon closing.\n        *   The dancer jumps from fifth (RFF), beats the legs, opens to the second position, then jumps from the second position and closes in the opposite fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, left foot front (LFF).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The name itself tells us the position changes. The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position, right foot front (RFF).\n    *   **Movement:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble\" or \"join together.\" In its most basic form (*assemblé côté*, or side assemblé), the dancer brushes one foot to the side, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (\"assembles\") both legs together in the air, landing on both feet simultaneously in the fifth position.\n        *   If the front (right) foot brushes to the side, it will return to the front position upon landing.\n        *   If the back (left) foot brushes to the side, it will return to the back position upon landing.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, right foot front (RFF).\n    *   **Conclusion:** In a standard assemblé, the foot that initiates the movement returns to its original place (front or back). Therefore, the starting and ending positions are the same. (Note: While there are variations like *assemblé dessus* or *dessous* that do change the feet, the fundamental step itself does not).\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position, right foot front (RFF).\n    *   **Movement:** *Glissade* means \"to glide,\" and *derrière* means \"behind.\" This is a traveling step.\n        *   The dancer starts in fifth (RFF) and brushes the back (left) foot to the side.\n        *   They transfer their weight onto that foot.\n        *   The front (right) foot then glides to close *behind* the left foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, left foot front (LFF).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The foot that started in front ends in the back. The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position, right foot front (RFF).\n    *   **Movement:** This is a complex, decorative step, similar to a *pas de chat* but with a circular movement (*rond de jambe*) from each leg.\n        *   The dancer jumps, lifting the first leg (right), which performs a quick outward circle (*rond de jambe en dehors*).\n        *   As the first leg moves, the second leg (left) is picked up and performs a quick inward circle (*rond de jambe en dedans*).\n        *   The dancer lands first on the initial leg (right foot), and the second leg (left foot) closes in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, left foot front (LFF).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The step inherently involves the second leg closing in front, thus changing the starting position. The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n### Final Careful Points Summary\n\n*   **Entrechat six:** An even-numbered entrechat that changes feet.\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** The term \"changé\" explicitly means the feet change.\n*   **Assemblé:** The basic form of the step reassembles the feet in their original configuration.\n*   **Glissade derrière:** The term \"derrière\" indicates the front foot closes behind, forcing a change.\n*   **Gargouillade:** A decorative step where the second leg always closes in front, changing the position.\n\nBased on this analysis, Assemblé is the only step among the choices where the fundamental movement results in the same starting and ending leg position.\n\n<<<C>>>"
