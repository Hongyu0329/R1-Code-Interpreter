    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Source:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n    *   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n    *   **Event:** The Junior Prom.\n    *   **Object:** A cardboard cutout.\n    *   **Subject:** A fictional singer represented by the cutout.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the name of this fictional singer.\n\n2.  **Identify the Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" is also known by its title, \"Deets for Deets!\". The plot centers on the four main girls (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attending their junior prom.\n\n3.  **Locate the Scene:** Towards the end of the cartoon, the girls are at the prom. The \"live entertainment\" is announced by the narrator, Strong Bad.\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Entertainment\":** Instead of a live band or DJ, the entertainment is revealed to be a cardboard cutout of a male singer propped up on the stage.\n\n5.  **Identify the Singer's Name:** Strong Bad's narration explicitly names the singer. He says, \"...please put your hands together for the musical stylings of... a cardboard cutout of... THOMPKINS!\". The name \"THOMPKINS\" is also written in all-caps on the base of the cardboard cutout itself.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Fictional Character:** The question asks for a *fictional* singer. \"Thompkins\" is a one-off character created specifically for this joke within the Homestar Runner universe. He is not a real-world singer.\n*   **Spelling:** There is a minor fan debate about the spelling. While the on-screen text clearly says \"Thompkins\" (with a 'p'), the internal Adobe Flash file name for the character asset spells it \"Thomkins\" (without a 'p'). However, for the purpose of answering the question based on what is presented to the viewer in the cartoon, the visible and spoken name is \"Thompkins\".\n*   **Exact Source:** It's crucial to pinpoint the answer to this specific episode (\"Teen Girl Squad #15\") and not confuse it with other musical acts in the Homestar Runner series, such as Limozeen, Taranchula, or Sloshy.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the name of the fictional singer.\n\n<<<Thompkins>>>"
