    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Population Ethics:** This branch of ethics deals with evaluating the goodness of different populations, considering their size and the welfare of the individuals within them.\n*   **Critical-Level Views:** This is a family of theories in population ethics. Their defining feature is the \"critical level,\" a positive level of welfare denoted as *c*. According to these views:\n    *   Adding a person with welfare *u* > *c* makes the world better.\n    *   Adding a person with welfare *u* = *c* makes the world neither better nor worse.\n    *   Adding a person with welfare *u* < *c* (even if *u* is positive) makes the world worse.\n    A common way to formalize this is to say the value of a population is the sum of (welfare - critical level) for every person. Value = Σ(uᵢ - c).\n*   **Arrhenius's Impossibility Theorems:** These are a series of proofs in population ethics showing that it's impossible for any single theory to satisfy a set of conditions that, on their own, all seem highly desirable. A theory must violate at least one condition to be logically consistent. The \"sixth theorem\" refers to a specific combination of such conditions.\n\n### Step 2: List the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem shows the logical incompatibility of the following principles (or very similar formulations):\n1.  **Non-Elitism**\n2.  **Egalitarian Dominance**\n3.  **General Non-Extreme Priority**\n4.  **Weak Non-Sadism**\n5.  A strong version of the **Dominance Principle**\n\nThe question asks which of these conditions is violated by critical-level views. We will analyze the answer choices, which correspond to these conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Answer Choice Against Critical-Level Views\n\nLet's test if a critical-level view (Value = Σ(uᵢ - c)) satisfies or violates each condition.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This condition states that for two populations of the same size N, if everyone in population A has welfare *w* and everyone in population B has welfare *v*, and *w* > *v*, then population A is better than population B.\n    *   Value(A) = N * (w - c)\n    *   Value(B) = N * (v - c)\n    *   Since w > v, it follows that (w - c) > (v - c), and therefore N*(w-c) > N*(v-c).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views *satisfy* Egalitarian Dominance.\n\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This principle is designed to ensure that we prioritize helping the worse-off to some extent. It states that for any welfare level, a benefit of a certain size for someone at that level can be more important than a smaller benefit for someone much better off. In a critical-level view, the value of increasing someone's welfare by an amount Δ is simply Δ, regardless of their starting welfare. A larger gain is always better than a smaller gain. This structure satisfies the condition.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views *satisfy* General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This condition states that adding a person with positive welfare (*u* > 0) is better than adding a person with negative welfare (*v* < 0), all else being equal.\n    *   The change in value from adding the positive-welfare person is (u - c).\n    *   The change in value from adding the negative-welfare person is (v - c).\n    *   Since u > 0 and v < 0, it is always true that u > v. Therefore, (u - c) > (v - c).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views *satisfy* Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This condition states that for *any* positive welfare level *u*, there exists at least one population to which adding a person with welfare *u* would be an improvement.\n    *   Consider a welfare level *u* that is positive but below the critical level (0 < u < c).\n    *   According to the critical-level view, adding a person with this welfare level changes the total value by (u - c), which is a negative number.\n    *   This negative change occurs regardless of the starting population. Therefore, there is *no* population where adding this person is an improvement.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views *violate* Weak Quality Addition. However, Weak Quality Addition is not a condition of the *sixth* impossibility theorem, but rather of others (like the third).\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This condition states that for any two positive welfare levels *u* > *v*, there exists some number *n* such that a population of *n* people at level *v* is better than a population of one person at level *u*. This prevents a single \"elite\" life from being considered better than any number of other very good lives.\n    *   Let's test this with a critical-level view. Choose welfare levels such that *u* is above the critical level *c*, and *v* is below the critical level *c* (i.e., u > c > v > 0).\n    *   Value of one person at level *u* = u - c. This is a positive number.\n    *   Value of *n* people at level *v* = n * (v - c). Since v < c, (v-c) is a negative number. The total value is negative and becomes more negative as *n* increases.\n    *   In this scenario, the positive value (u-c) will *always* be greater than the negative value n*(v-c), no matter how large *n* is.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views *violate* Non-Elitism.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe are looking for the condition *of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem* that critical-level views violate. Based on the analysis:\n*   Critical-level views satisfy Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, and Weak Non-Sadism.\n*   Critical-level views violate Non-Elitism.\n*   Non-Elitism is a core component of the sixth impossibility theorem.\n\nTherefore, to remain a consistent theory, critical-level views escape the paradox of the sixth impossibility theorem by rejecting the Non-Elitism condition.\n\n<<<C>>>"
