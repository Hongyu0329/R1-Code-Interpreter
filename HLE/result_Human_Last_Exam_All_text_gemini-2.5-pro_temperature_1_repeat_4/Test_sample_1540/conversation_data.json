    "This problem requires us to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length. We are also asked to find the total memory `m` in bytes used for variables in the most memory-efficient C program that solves this.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Core Task**: Compare two strings, let's call them `s1` and `s2`.\n2.  **Comparison Rule**: The comparison must be lexicographical, meaning we compare them character by character from left to right.\n3.  **Case Insensitivity**: Uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as the same (e.g., 'A' == 'a').\n4.  **Input**: The two strings are provided on two separate lines. They have the same length, which is between 1 and 100.\n5.  **Output**: Print \"-1\" if `s1 < s2`, \"1\" if `s1 > s2`, and \"0\" if `s1 == s2`.\n6.  **Optimization Goal**: The solution must be the most memory-efficient possible, and we need to calculate the total memory `m` used by its variables.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Memory Efficiency**: This is the key constraint. The naive approach of storing both strings in two character arrays (`char s1[101]; char s2[101];`) is a valid starting point, but we must check if it can be improved.\n2.  **Input Stream Behavior**: In C, standard input (`stdin`) is a stream. The two input strings are on separate lines. This means the entire first line (the first string and a newline character) must be read from the stream before any part of the second line can be accessed. This fact forces us to store the first string in memory completely.\n3.  **Storing the Second String**: While we must store the first string, we can avoid storing the second string. We can process it character by character as it's read from the input stream, comparing each character with the corresponding one from the already stored first string.\n4.  **Data Types for Variables**: To minimize memory, we should choose the smallest possible data type for any auxiliary variables. For example, a loop counter for a string up to length 100 does not need an `int` (4 bytes); a `char` (1 byte) is sufficient.\n5.  **Handling Case Insensitivity**: The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is ideal for converting characters to lowercase before comparison, thus satisfying the case-insensitivity requirement.\n6.  **Null Terminator**: C-style strings require a null terminator (`\\0`). Therefore, to store a string of maximum length 100, the character array must have a size of at least `100 + 1 = 101`.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-step Analysis\n\nBased on the points above, we can design the most memory-efficient C program and calculate its memory usage.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the necessary variables and their sizes.**\n\n*   **First String Storage**: As we must read the first string before the second, we need a buffer to store it. Given the maximum length of 100, we need an array of size 101.\n    *   Variable Declaration: `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory Usage: **101 bytes** (`sizeof(char)` is 1 byte).\n\n*   **Second String Processing**: We will read the second string one character at a time. We need a variable to temporarily hold each character as it is read.\n    *   Variable Declaration: `char c2;`\n    *   Memory Usage: **1 byte**.\n\n*   **Loop Counter**: We need an index to access the characters of the stored first string (`s1`) to compare against the characters of the second string. The index will range from 0 to 99. A `char` type is sufficient to hold these values.\n    *   Variable Declaration: `char i;`\n    *   Memory Usage: **1 byte**.\n\nNo other variables are strictly necessary for the logic. Any intermediate results (like the return value of `tolower()`) can be handled in CPU registers without requiring explicit variable declaration and stack memory allocation.\n\n**Step 2: Outline the Program Logic.**\n\n1.  In `main()`, declare the variables: `char s1[101]`, `char i = 0`, and `char c2`.\n2.  Read the first string from standard input into the `s1` array (e.g., using `scanf(\"%s\", s1);`).\n3.  The `scanf` call leaves a newline character (`\\n`) in the input buffer. This must be consumed before reading the second string. A call to `getchar();` will accomplish this.\n4.  Start a loop that reads characters from the input stream one by one using `c2 = getchar()`. The loop continues as long as the character read is not the newline that marks the end of the second string.\n5.  Inside the loop:\n    a. Compare `tolower(s1[i])` with `tolower(c2)`.\n    b. If `tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2)`, print \"-1\" and terminate.\n    c. If `tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(c2)`, print \"1\" and terminate.\n    d. If they are equal, increment the index `i`.\n6.  If the loop completes without the program terminating, it means all corresponding characters were equal. Print \"0\".\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Memory Usage (`m`).**\n\nWe sum the memory allocated for all the variables defined in our efficient program.\n\n*   Memory for `s1` array: 101 bytes\n*   Memory for `c2` character: 1 byte\n*   Memory for `i` counter: 1 byte\n*   Total memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\nThis represents the minimum memory required on the stack for variables to solve the problem under the given constraints and standard input behavior.\n\n<<<103>>>"
