The final state of the system after measurement is probabilistic. After applying gate Q to ququint A and then measuring ququint A, the system collapses to one of five possible states. The possible outcomes are:
1.  State: $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$ with probability $1/5$.
2.  State: $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$ with probability $1/5$.
3.  State: $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$ with probability $3/10$.
4.  State: $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$ with probability $1/5$.
5.  State: $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$ with probability $1/10$.
