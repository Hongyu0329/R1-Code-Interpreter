    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Observer Dynamics and the Goal**\n\nThe system is given by:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nThe Luenberger observer is defined by:\nx̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - ŷ(k))\nwhere x̂ is the state estimate, ŷ = Cx̂ is the output estimate, and L is the observer gain matrix to be designed.\n\nThe error dynamics are given by e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k), where the error is e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k).\n\nThe goal is to make the error e(k) equal to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is a \"deadbeat observer\" design. This requires the matrix (A - LC) to be nilpotent, meaning `(A - LC)^v = 0` for some integer `v`. The smallest such `v` is the number of steps for the error to vanish.\n\n**Step 2: Check System Observability and Determine the Shortest Time**\n\nThe shortest possible time `v` for the error to converge to zero is the observability index of the pair (A, C). First, we must verify that the system is observable, i.e., the rank of the observability matrix `O` is equal to the number of states, `n=4`.\n\nThe observability matrix is `O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]`.\n`A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]`\n`C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n\nLet's compute the necessary components:\n*   `C` has 2 rows, `c1 = [1, 0, 0, 0]` and `c2 = [1, 0, 0, 1]`. They are linearly independent, so `rank(C) = 2`.\n*   `CA = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] * A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`.\n*   Let's check the rank of `[C; CA]`. The rows are `r1=[1,0,0,0]`, `r2=[1,0,0,1]`, `r3=[-1,0,0,1]`, `r4=[-2,0,1,0]`. We notice that `r3 = -2*r1 + r2`. So the rows are linearly dependent. The rank of `[C; CA]` is the rank of `[r1; r2; r4]`, which is 3. Since the rank is less than 4, the observability index `v` is greater than 2.\n*   `A^2 = A * A = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [-3, 0, 2, -1], [2, 0, -1, 3], [2, 1, -1, -3]]`\n*   `CA^2 = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] * A^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [2, 1, 0, -5]]`. The rows are `r5` and `r6`.\n*   Let's check the rank of `[C; CA; CA^2]`. We can form a 4x4 matrix from a selection of its rows, for example, `M = [r1; r2; r4; r6]`.\n    `M = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0, -5]]`\n    The determinant of M is `det(M) = 1 * det([[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,0,-5]]) = 1 * (1 * det([[0,1],[1,0]])) = -1`.\n    Since `det(M) != 0`, the rank of `M` is 4. This means the rank of `[C; CA; CA^2]` is 4.\n\nThe system is observable. The smallest integer `v` such that `rank([C; CA; ...; CA^(v-1)]) = n` is `v = 3`.\nTherefore, the shortest possible number of steps for the error to become zero is 3. We need to design `L` such that `(A - LC)^3 = 0`.\n\n**Step 3: Design the Observer Gain Matrix L**\n\nWe need to find a 4x2 matrix `L` such that `(A - LC)^3 = 0`. This implies that the characteristic polynomial of `(A - LC)` must be `z^4 = 0`. We will try to find an `L` that gives `A - LC` a simple structure which is nilpotent of order 3.\n\nLet's compute the structure of `A - LC`:\n`L = [[l11, l12], [l21, l22], [l31, l32], [l41, l42]]`\n`LC = [[l11+l12, 0, 0, l12], [l21+l22, 0, 0, l22], [l31+l32, 0, 0, l32], [l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]]`\n`A - LC = [[-1-l11-l12, 0, 0, 1-l12], [1-l21-l22, 0, 0, 2-l22], [-l31-l32, 1, 0, -1-l32], [-1-l41-l42, 0, 1, -1-l42]]`\n\nLet's try to make this matrix, let's call it `A_c`, as simple as possible. A good strategy is to make columns zero. Let's try to make the first and last columns zero.\n`A_c = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]`\n\nEquating `A - LC` to this target `A_c`:\nFrom the last column:\n1.  `1 - l12 = 0`  => `l12 = 1`\n2.  `2 - l22 = 0`  => `l22 = 2`\n3.  `-1 - l32 = 0` => `l32 = -1`\n4.  `-1 - l42 = 0` => `l42 = -1`\n\nNow from the first column:\n5.  `-1 - l11 - l12 = 0` => `-1 - l11 - 1 = 0` => `l11 = -2`\n6.  `1 - l21 - l22 = 0`  => `1 - l21 - 2 = 0`  => `l21 = -1`\n7.  `-l31 - l32 = 0`    => `-l31 - (-1) = 0` => `l31 = 1`\n8.  `-1 - l41 - l42 = 0` => `-1 - l41 - (-1) = 0` => `l41 = 0`\n\nThe other elements of `A-LC` must match the target `A_c` as well.\n*   (3,2) element: `1 = 1` (Consistent)\n*   (4,3) element: `1 = 1` (Consistent)\n*   All other non-zero elements are also consistent.\n\nThis gives us the observer gain matrix `L`:\n`L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]`\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Solution**\n\nWith this gain `L`, the error dynamics matrix is `A_c = A - LC = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]`.\nLet's check if `A_c^3 = 0`.\n`A_c^2 = A_c * A_c = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]] * [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]] = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]]`\n`A_c^3 = A_c^2 * A_c = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]] * [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]] = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]`\nSince `A_c^3 = 0` and `A_c^2 != 0`, the error `e(k) = A_c^k * e(0)` will be identically zero for all `k >= 3`. This matches the shortest possible time.\n\nThe resulting gain matrix is the answer.\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
