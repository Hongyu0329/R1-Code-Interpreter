    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the core components and constraints of the problem.\n*   **The Definition of Knowledge:** We must use the Justified True Belief (JTB) model. This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is true.\n    2.  S believes P.\n    3.  S is justified in believing P.\n*   **The Epistemic States:** The model is simplified to include only two possible states regarding a proposition: **Knowledge** or **Belief**. This is an artificial and crucial constraint. It implies that these are the only two categories available for our mental stance towards a proposition.\n*   **The Exclusion:** We must **ignore Gettier problems**. Gettier problems are scenarios where a person has a justified true belief that fails to be knowledge due to luck. By excluding these, the question forces us to look for more fundamental or structural problems with the JTB theory under the given constraints.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Potential Points of Failure**\n\nGiven the constraints, we must look for logical inconsistencies or paradoxes that arise from combining the JTB definition with the two-state system. The primary areas to investigate are:\n1.  The relationship between the concepts of \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" as defined by the JTB model versus as defined by the problem's constraint.\n2.  The nature of the \"Justification\" condition. What does it mean to be justified in a system that only recognizes Knowledge and Belief?\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing for the First Problem (The Problem of Self-Contradiction)**\n\n1.  **JTB's View:** The JTB definition explicitly states that knowledge is a *type* of belief. Specifically, it is a belief that also has the properties of being true and justified. Therefore, the set of all things known is a *subset* of the set of all things believed. If you know something, you necessarily believe it.\n2.  **The Constraint's View:** The problem states that our \"only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief.\" This phrasing implies that the two states are distinct and mutually exclusive. If your state regarding a proposition P is \"Knowledge,\" it cannot also be \"Belief.\" They are presented as two separate boxes you can be in, not as one being a more specific version of the other.\n3.  **The Conflict:** There is a direct logical contradiction.\n    *   JTB says: Knowledge *is a* Belief (K ⊂ B).\n    *   The constraint implies: Knowledge *is not* Belief (K ∩ B = ø).\n    *   An epistemic framework cannot simultaneously hold that knowledge is a type of belief and that knowledge is a state distinct from belief. This makes the JTB definition incompatible with the premise of the two-state system.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing for the Second Problem (The Problem of Justification Regress)**\n\n1.  **The Nature of Justification:** The \"J\" in JTB requires that a belief be supported by good reasons or evidence. Let's say your belief in proposition P is justified by another proposition, Q.\n2.  **The Status of the Justifier:** We must ask: what is our epistemic state regarding the justifying proposition Q? According to the problem's constraint, our state regarding Q must be either **Knowledge** or **Belief**.\n3.  **Scenario A: The Justifier is a Belief.** If we only need to *believe* Q for it to justify P, then our justification for P could be an unjustified, irrational, or even false belief. This would make the justification condition extremely weak. It would allow for \"knowledge\" to be grounded in falsehoods or mere guesses, which undermines the entire point of requiring justification in the first place.\n4.  **Scenario B: The Justifier is Knowledge.** If the justification Q must be *known*, then we run into an infinite regress. To know P, you must know Q. But to know Q, it must also be a justified true belief, meaning its justification, R, must also be known. To know R, you must know its justification, S, and so on, ad infinitum (P ← Q ← R ← S ← ...). Since one cannot complete an infinite chain of justifications, it becomes impossible for any belief to ever be ultimately justified. This is a classic epistemological dilemma known as the regress problem.\n\nThus, the justification condition of the JTB model becomes paradoxical within the two-state system. It is either too weak to be meaningful (if based on mere belief) or impossible to ever satisfy (if based on knowledge).\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\nBased on the analysis, the two problems are:\n1.  A logical self-contradiction in the definition of knowledge.\n2.  An infinite regress problem in the condition of justification.\n\n<<<\nThe two problems the JTB definition runs into under these constraints are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Self-Contradiction:** The JTB model defines knowledge as a *type* of belief (a belief that is justified and true). This means that if someone knows something, they must also believe it. However, the premise that the only two epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" implies they are mutually exclusive categories. This creates a contradiction: JTB requires knowledge to be a subset of belief, while the problem's constraint implies knowledge is a state separate from belief.\n\n2.  **The Problem of Justification Regress:** For a belief (P) to be justified, it must be supported by a reason or another proposition (Q). Within the given two-state system, one's epistemic state toward the reason (Q) must be either \"Belief\" or \"Knowledge\".\n    *   If the reason (Q) only needs to be a **Belief**, then the justification for knowledge could be based on a false, irrational, or unjustified belief, making the justification condition too weak.\n    *   If the reason (Q) must be **Knowledge**, then that piece of knowledge (Q) would itself require a justification (R) that is also known. This leads to an infinite regress (one must know R to know Q to know P, and so on), making it impossible to ever meet the justification condition.\n>>>"
