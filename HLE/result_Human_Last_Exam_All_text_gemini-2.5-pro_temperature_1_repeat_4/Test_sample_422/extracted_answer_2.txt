The two problems the JTB definition runs into under these constraints are:

1.  **The Problem of Self-Contradiction:** The JTB model defines knowledge as a *type* of belief (a belief that is justified and true). This means that if someone knows something, they must also believe it. However, the premise that the only two epistemic states are "Knowledge" and "Belief" implies they are mutually exclusive categories. This creates a contradiction: JTB requires knowledge to be a subset of belief, while the problem's constraint implies knowledge is a state separate from belief.

2.  **The Problem of Justification Regress:** For a belief (P) to be justified, it must be supported by a reason or another proposition (Q). Within the given two-state system, one's epistemic state toward the reason (Q) must be either "Belief" or "Knowledge".
    *   If the reason (Q) only needs to be a **Belief**, then the justification for knowledge could be based on a false, irrational, or unjustified belief, making the justification condition too weak.
    *   If the reason (Q) must be **Knowledge**, then that piece of knowledge (Q) would itself require a justification (R) that is also known. This leads to an infinite regress (one must know R to know Q to know P, and so on), making it impossible to ever meet the justification condition.
