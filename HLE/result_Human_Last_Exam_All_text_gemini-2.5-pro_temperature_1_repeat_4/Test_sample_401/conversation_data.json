    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space. The parenthetical remark \"(not necessarily metric)\" is crucial, as it tells us we must consider the general topological definition, not just the more common one restricted to metric spaces.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continuum:**\n    *   A continuum `X` is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. (A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to `X` itself).\n    *   An continuum `X` is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable. That is, if `X = A U B` where `A` and `B` are subcontinua, then either `A = X` or `B = X`.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain the point `p`.\n\n### Step 2: Relating Composants to Decomposability\n\nThe number of composants in a continuum is directly related to whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continua:** A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that a continuum is decomposable if and only if it has exactly **one** composant. In a decomposable continuum, for any two points, there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both. This means all points belong to the same composant, so the single composant is the entire space itself.\n\n*   **Indecomposable Continua:** Since an indecomposable continuum is, by definition, not decomposable, it must have more than one composant. This means the smallest possible number of composants must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Number of Composants in Indecomposable Continua\n\nThe question now becomes: What is the minimum number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have? The answer depends critically on whether the continuum is metric or not.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Metric Case**\n    If we were restricted to *metric* continua (which are separable and second-countable), a different set of theorems would apply:\n    1.  In an indecomposable metric continuum, every proper subcontinuum is nowhere dense.\n    2.  Each composant can be expressed as a countable union of proper subcontinua. Therefore, each composant is a set of the first category (a countable union of nowhere dense sets).\n    3.  The Baire Category Theorem states that a complete metric space (and thus a compact metric space) is a Baire space, meaning it is not a set of the first category.\n    4.  Since the continuum is the union of its composants, and each composant is of the first category, there must be an *uncountable* number of them. If there were only countably many, their union (the continuum itself) would be of the first category, a contradiction.\n    5.  A more advanced theorem (by Mazurkiewicz and others) shows that for any indecomposable metric continuum, the number of composants is not just uncountable, but is exactly **`c`**, the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers). Examples include the Knaster bucket-handle continuum and solenoids.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Non-Metric Case**\n    The question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric\". This opens the door to continua that do not have a countable base, where the Baire Category argument outlined above does not necessarily apply (because a composant might not be a countable union of nowhere dense sets).\n\n    We have already established that the number of composants must be greater than 1. So, the question is whether it's possible to construct a (non-metric) indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants.\n\n    The answer is **yes**. This is a classic result in set-theoretic topology. In 1970, David P. Bellamy published a paper titled \"An Indecomposable Continuum with Exactly Two Composants,\" which provides an explicit construction of such a space. This example is necessarily non-metric.\n\n    Furthermore, it has been shown (sometimes depending on set-theoretic axioms like the Continuum Hypothesis) that for any integer `n â‰¥ 2`, there exists a non-metric indecomposable continuum with exactly `n` composants.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant.\n2.  The number 2 is a possible number of composants for a non-metric indecomposable continuum.\n3.  Therefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
