The optimal combination is a single-site catalyst composed of:
1.  **Metal:** Zirconium (Zr).
2.  **Ligand:** A thermally robust, tridentate pincer-type ligand, such as a diarylamido-based bis(phosphino) (PNP) framework with bulky substituents on the phosphorus atoms (e.g., isopropyl or tert-butyl).
3.  **Support:** A high-surface-area, ordered mesoporous silica, such as SBA-15 or MCM-41.

This combination is optimal because Zirconium provides a balance of polymerization and C-C activation reactivity. The pincer ligand offers the extreme thermal stability required for hydrogenolysis while defining an open coordination sphere essential for access by both monomers and polymer chains. The mesoporous silica support immobilizes the catalyst for practical use and provides large pores necessary for the polymer substrate to reach the isolated active sites during the depolymerization step. The catalyst's function can be switched between polymerization and depolymerization simply by controlling the temperature and reactant (olefin vs. hydrogen) pressure.
