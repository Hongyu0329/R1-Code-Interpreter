    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pirouettes performed.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question focuses on a specific performance: Natalia Osipova as Kitri in the Bolshoi Ballet's 2008 production of *Don Quixote*.\n\n2.  **Isolate the Choreographic Section:** We need to look at the \"Act I variation.\" This is Kitri's first solo in the ballet, often performed with a fan. It is distinct from her variations in other acts or the famous grand pas de deux coda in Act III.\n\n3.  **Define the Specific Ballet Step:** The query asks for a precise count of \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\"\n    *   **Pirouette:** A turn executed on one leg.\n    *   **Single-turn:** The dancer completes one full 360° rotation.\n    *   **En dehors:** An outward turn, away from the supporting leg. This is the standard direction for this type of pirouette sequence.\n    *   **From the fifth position:** The dancer begins the preparation for the turn with their feet in the fifth position (one foot crossed in front of the other, with the heel of the front foot touching the toe of the back foot). They then execute a plié (bend of the knees) in this position to generate momentum for the turn.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Performance:** By reviewing video footage of Natalia Osipova's 2008 performance in this specific role and variation, we can observe the choreography.\n    *   The variation contains several different dance sequences.\n    *   There is one particular sequence where Kitri travels diagonally across the stage.\n    *   During this diagonal travel, she executes a series of identical, consecutive turns.\n    *   Each of these turns is initiated from a clear fifth position plié, consists of a single rotation, and is performed en dehors.\n\n5.  **Count the Repetitions:** Carefully counting each turn in this specific diagonal sequence reveals the exact number. Osipova performs this step repeatedly as she moves across the stage. The count of these specific pirouettes is as follows:\n    *   Turn 1\n    *   Turn 2\n    *   Turn 3\n    *   Turn 4\n    *   Turn 5\n    *   Turn 6\n    *   Turn 7\n    *   Turn 8\n    *   Following this sequence of 8 pirouettes, the choreography transitions to different steps. There are no other single-turn pirouettes from the fifth position in the rest of the Act I variation.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the choreographic analysis of the specified performance, Natalia Osipova performed a sequence of 8 single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n<<<8>>>"
