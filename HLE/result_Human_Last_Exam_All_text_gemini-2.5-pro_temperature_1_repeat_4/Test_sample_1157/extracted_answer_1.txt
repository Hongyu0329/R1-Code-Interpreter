**Appropriate Management Procedures:**

**Phase 1: Emergency Management**
1.  **Systemic Stabilization:** The immediate priority is managing the uncontrolled diabetes. This involves a medical consultation, initiation of diabetic treatment (e.g., insulin) to stabilize blood glucose, administration of a tetanus booster, and a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent infection.
2.  **Local Wound Care:** After systemic stabilization, the dental team will perform a gentle debridement and irrigation of the sockets and surrounding soft tissues. Radiographs will be taken to rule out alveolar fractures or retained root tips. Any soft tissue lacerations will be sutured.

**Phase 2: Healing and Pre-Prosthetic Phase**
*   A healing period of at least 8-12 weeks is required, during which the patient's diabetes must be continually managed. Meticulous oral hygiene is enforced. A temporary prosthesis may be fabricated for aesthetics during this time.

**Phase 3: Definitive Prosthetic Rehabilitation**
*   Fabrication of the final prosthesis will begin once the tissues have healed and her diabetes is well-controlled.

**Cells of Interest:**
The key cells of interest are those involved in wound healing and the immune response, as their function is compromised by uncontrolled diabetes:
*   **Neutrophils and Macrophages:** Impaired function of these immune cells increases the risk of infection.
*   **Fibroblasts and Osteoblasts:** Reduced activity of these cells leads to delayed soft tissue healing and poor bone formation in the sockets.

**Denture Replacement Details:**

*   **Type of Denture and Material:** The most appropriate choice is a **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture**. The framework would be made of a **Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy** for strength and hygiene, with acrylic teeth and a pink acrylic base.

*   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
    *   **Abutment Teeth:**
        1.  **Left First Molar:** The tooth posterior to the gap.
        2.  **Left Central Incisor:** The tooth anterior to the gap.
        3.  **Teeth on the Right Side (e.g., Right Canine and Premolar):** For cross-arch stabilization.
    *   **Reasons:**
        *   **Support & Proximity:** The left first molar and central incisor are the closest teeth and can provide direct support and retention for the denture. The molar, being multi-rooted, is a very stro
