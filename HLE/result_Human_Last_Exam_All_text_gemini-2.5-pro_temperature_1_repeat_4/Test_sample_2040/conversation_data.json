    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)**\n    *   SPDC is a nonlinear optical process. In this process, a single high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons).\n    *   This process must conserve both energy and momentum.\n    *   The key material property that enables SPDC is the **second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility**, denoted as **χ⁽²⁾** (chi-two). This coefficient quantifies the material's ability to generate a polarization that is quadratic in the strength of the incident electric field of the light.\n\n2.  **Identify the Requirement for a Non-Zero χ⁽²⁾**\n    *   A fundamental principle of nonlinear optics is that the bulk second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) can only be non-zero in materials that **lack a center of inversion symmetry**.\n    *   A material with inversion symmetry (a centrosymmetric material) looks the same after being inverted through a central point (i.e., for every atom at position **r**, there is an identical atom at -**r**). In such materials, applying an electric field **E** and its inverse -**E** must produce opposite polarizations **P** and -**P**. However, the second-order effect scales with **E²**, meaning `(-E)² = E²`, which would produce the same polarization **P**. The only way for **P** to equal -**P** is if the effect is zero. Therefore, by symmetry, the bulk χ⁽²⁾ of any centrosymmetric material is zero.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Material: Free-standing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n    *   Boron nanosheets, commonly known as borophene, are two-dimensional (2D) allotropes of boron.\n    *   Unlike graphene, borophene is highly polymorphic, meaning it can exist in many different crystal structures.\n    *   The key is to determine the crystal symmetry of the common and stable phases of borophene. The most widely studied and experimentally realized phases include the **β₁₂** phase, the **χ₃** phase, and the **striped** phase.\n    *   Upon examining the crystallographic structures of these common borophene phases, we find:\n        *   The β₁₂ phase has the space group *Pmmn*.\n        *   The χ₃ phase has the space group *Cmcm*.\n        *   The striped phase also has the space group *Pmmn*.\n    *   All of these space groups (*Pmmn* and *Cmcm*) are **centrosymmetric**. This means that the fundamental crystal structure of common borophene phases possesses a center of inversion.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Reach a Conclusion**\n    *   SPDC requires a non-zero second-order susceptibility, χ⁽²⁾.\n    *   A non-zero χ⁽²⁾ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n    *   The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n    *   Therefore, the bulk χ⁽²⁾ of boron nanosheets is zero by symmetry.\n    *   Conclusion: Because boron nanosheets lack the necessary material property (a non-zero χ⁽²⁾), they would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **\"Free-standing\" Condition:** This part of the question is crucial. If the borophene sheet were placed on a substrate, the overall symmetry of the system would be broken at the borophene-substrate interface. This symmetry breaking *could* induce a small, localized χ⁽²⁾, but the question specifically asks about \"free-standing\" sheets, removing this possibility.\n2.  **Edges and Defects:** Real-world nanosheets are finite and have edges, defects, or strain. These imperfections locally break the perfect inversion symmetry of the crystal lattice. Consequently, a very weak χ⁽²⁾ response might be generated at these specific locations. However, this would be an extremely inefficient process, not a characteristic bulk property of the material, and would not lead to the significant SPDC seen in conventional nonlinear crystals.\n3.  **Higher-Order Nonlinearities:** Boron nanosheets, being centrosymmetric, can and do exhibit odd-order nonlinear effects, such as those governed by the third-order susceptibility, χ⁽³⁾. This leads to phenomena like third-harmonic generation (THG) and four-wave mixing. However, the question is specifically about SPDC, which is strictly a χ⁽²⁾ process.\n4.  **Other Polymorphs:** While the most common phases are centrosymmetric, it is theoretically possible that an undiscovered, metastable, non-centrosymmetric phase of borophene could exist. However, based on current knowledge of the stable and synthesized forms, the expectation is for centrosymmetry. The question asks what would be \"expected,\" which points toward the properties of the most common forms.\n5.  **Electric Quadrupole/Magnetic Dipole Effects:** In centrosymmetric media, extremely weak second-order effects can arise from electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole interactions. These are typically many orders of magnitude weaker than the electric dipole effects described by χ⁽²⁾ in non-centrosymmetric materials and are generally considered negligible for practical SPDC generation.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  To exhibit SPDC, a material must have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  A non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾ is forbidden by symmetry in materials with a center of inversion (centrosymmetric materials).\n3.  The common and stable structures of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are all centrosymmetric.\n4.  Therefore, the bulk χ⁽²⁾ of free-standing boron nanosheets is zero.\n5.  Without a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, the process of spontaneous parametric downconversion cannot occur in a significant way.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because the common phases of borophene possess a centrosymmetric crystal structure, which forbids the second-order nonlinear optical process of SPDC by symmetry.>>>"
