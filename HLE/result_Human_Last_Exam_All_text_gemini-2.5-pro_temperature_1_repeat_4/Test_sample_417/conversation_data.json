    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Molecular Structure from the IUPAC Name**\n\nThe molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Central Core:** The core of the molecule is 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, also known as mesitylene. It's a benzene ring with three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6.\n*   **Substituents:** At positions 1, 3, and 5 of the benzene ring, there are three identical, bulky substituents.\n*   **Symmetry:** The 1,3,5-substitution pattern on the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core gives the overall molecule a three-fold rotational axis of symmetry (C3 axis) passing through the center of the benzene ring. This means the three large substituents are chemically equivalent, and the three methyl groups on the central ring are also chemically equivalent. To find the total number of NMR signals, we only need to count the number of unique proton environments in one of the three identical arms and add the signals from the central core.\n*   **The Substituent Arm:** Let's break down one arm: `[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]`.\n    *   `-methyl-`: This is a methylene (`-CH2-`) group that links the central benzene ring to the heterocyclic part.\n    *   `...indazol-2-yl`: This indicates attachment is at the N2 position of an indazole derivative.\n    *   The rest of the name, `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole`, describes a complex heterocyclic system. This is the IUPAC name for a derivative of camphor, a common chiral starting material. The structure is a pyrazole ring fused to a rigid bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (norbornane) skeleton. The stereochemistry `(4S,7R)` is specified, meaning each of the three arms has the same fixed chirality.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count the Chemically Non-Equivalent Protons**\n\nDue to the C3 symmetry, we can analyze the signals from just one \"unit\" of the molecule, which consists of one of the core methyl groups and one of the substituent arms.\n\n1.  **Central Core Protons:**\n    *   The three methyl groups on the mesitylene ring (at C2, C4, C6) are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n    *   Number of signals: **1** (This signal would integrate to 9H).\n\n2.  **Linker Methylene (`-CH2-`) Protons:**\n    *   This `-CH2-` group is attached to the central aromatic ring and to the nitrogen of the chiral indazole substituent.\n    *   Because the adjacent substituent is chiral, the two protons on the methylene carbon are in a chiral environment and are not chemically equivalent. They are diastereotopic.\n    *   Number of signals: **2** (These two protons would typically appear as a pair of doublets, known as an AB quartet, and each signal would integrate to 3H for the whole molecule).\n\n3.  **Protons on the Chiral Substituent (Camphopyrazole Moiety):**\n    *   This part of the molecule is rigid and lacks any internal symmetry plane. Therefore, we must consider each proton's unique environment.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** The pyrazole ring itself has one proton. This will produce a single, distinct signal.\n        *   Number of signals: **1**.\n    *   **Bicyclic Skeleton Protons (from the norbornane part):**\n        *   There is a single proton on one bridgehead carbon (C4 of the indazole system).\n        *   There are two methylene (`-CH2-`) groups (at C5 and C6). In the rigid, chiral bicyclic system, the two protons on each `CH2` group (the *endo* and *exo* protons) are diastereotopic. Furthermore, the C5 and C6 positions are not equivalent.\n        *   Total signals from the skeleton's C-H bonds: 1 (from CH) + 2 (from first CH2) + 2 (from second CH2) = **5** signals.\n    *   **Methyl Group Protons:** The name specifies `7,8,8-trimethyl`.\n        *   There is one methyl group on the other bridgehead carbon (C7).\n        *   There are two methyl groups on the bridge carbon (C8). These two methyl groups are in a chiral environment and are diastereotopic (one is *syn* and one is *anti* relative to the pyrazole ring).\n        *   Therefore, the three methyl groups are all chemically non-equivalent.\n        *   Number of signals: **3**.\n\n**Step 3: Sum the Signals to Get the Total**\n\nLet's sum the number of unique proton environments we have identified:\n\n*   From the central core methyls: 1 signal\n*   From the linker `-CH2-` groups: 2 signals\n*   From the pyrazole ring proton: 1 signal\n*   From the bicyclic skeleton C-H protons: 5 signals\n*   From the three methyl groups on the bicyclic system: 3 signals\n\nTotal number of signals = 1 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n\nEach of these 12 signals corresponds to a unique set of chemically equivalent protons in the molecule.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n*   Central Mesitylene -CH3 groups: 1 signal\n*   Benzylic -CH2- linkers: 2 signals (diastereotopic protons)\n*   Camphopyrazole substituent:\n    *   Pyrazole C-H: 1 signal\n    *   Skeleton CH: 1 signal\n    *   Skeleton CH2 (1): 2 signals (diastereotopic)\n    *   Skeleton CH2 (2): 2 signals (diastereotopic)\n    *   Skeleton -CH3 (1): 1 signal\n    *   Skeleton -CH3 (2,3): 2 signals (diastereotopic)\n*   Total = 1 + 2 + (1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2) = 3 + 9 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 distinct peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
