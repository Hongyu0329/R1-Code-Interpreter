    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Icosahedron**\n*   An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 identical edges, and 12 identical vertices.\n*   A key property of the regular icosahedron is that it is centrally symmetric. This means it has a center point, and for any point on the surface, there is a corresponding point directly opposite it through the center. Any plane that passes through this center of symmetry will divide the icosahedron's volume into two exactly equal halves.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Setup of the Tank**\n*   The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the triangular faces is positioned horizontally at the bottom, serving as the base.\n*   Because the icosahedron is a regular solid, the face directly opposite the base is also an equilateral triangle, and it is oriented parallel to the base.\n*   The water is subject to gravity, so its surface will form a flat, horizontal plane at rest.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the \"Half-Filled\" Condition with the Physics and Geometry**\n*   The tank is \"half-filled,\" meaning the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron tank.\n*   From Step 1, we know that a plane passing through the center of symmetry divides the volume in half.\n*   From Step 2, we know the water surface must be a horizontal plane.\n*   Combining these facts, the water surface must be the specific horizontal plane that passes through the icosahedron's center of symmetry. This plane will be parallel to the triangular base and the triangular top of the tank.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section**\n*   The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by this central, horizontal plane slicing through the icosahedron.\n*   Let's visualize the edges that this plane intersects. The plane lies exactly midway between the top and bottom faces. It will not cut the top or bottom faces, nor the three faces immediately adjacent to the top or bottom. It cuts through the \"belt\" of faces around the middle of the icosahedron.\n*   When an icosahedron is oriented on a face, it has a 3-fold axis of rotational symmetry passing vertically through the center of the base and the center of the top face. The cross-section must also be symmetric with respect to this 3-fold rotation.\n*   This central plane intersects the six edges that connect the \"upper half\" of the icosahedron to the \"lower half\". The points where the plane cuts these six edges form the vertices of the shape of the water surface.\n*   A polygon with six vertices is a hexagon.\n*   Due to the high degree of symmetry of the icosahedron (including the 3-fold rotational symmetry and reflection planes), the six intersection points will be equidistant from the center and equally spaced angularly. This means the resulting shape is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Symmetry is Key:** The central symmetry of the icosahedron is the crucial property for determining that the half-full water level must pass through the geometric center.\n2.  **Orientation Matters:** The fact that the icosahedron stands on a face makes the problem solvable. It establishes the \"horizontal\" direction and ensures the central slicing plane is parallel to the base.\n3.  **Cross-Section Shape:** The question boils down to a geometric problem: what is the shape of the central cross-section of an icosahedron when sliced parallel to two opposite faces? The answer is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nWhen an icosahedron tank standing on a face is half-filled, the water level forms a horizontal plane through the center of the icosahedron. The intersection of this plane with the interior of the tank forms a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
