    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the US city Tommaso moves to in the movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the specific US city that the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, moves to in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo* (Hard Boiled Egg).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the character and his role in the plot.**\nTommaso is the best friend of the film's protagonist, Piero Mansani. The two come from different social backgrounds; Piero is from a working-class family, while Tommaso's family is wealthy and bourgeois. Their differing paths in life are a central theme of the movie.\n\n**Step 3: Examine Tommaso's character arc.**\nThroughout the film, Tommaso is depicted as ambitious and drawn to a more cosmopolitan and materialistic lifestyle, in contrast to Piero who remains rooted in their hometown of Livorno. As part of his journey to achieve success and break away from his provincial life, Tommaso decides to leave Italy.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the specific destination in the film's narrative.**\nIn the latter part of the film, it is established that Tommaso has moved to the United States to pursue a career. The city he moves to is shown to be New York City. He is depicted as having become a successful \"yuppie\" living and working there, which serves as a stark contrast to Piero's life back in Italy.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the information to form the final answer.**\nBy analyzing the plot of *Ovosodo* and the trajectory of the character Tommaso, we can definitively identify his destination in the United States. He moves to New York City to become a successful professional, symbolizing a life path very different from the one chosen by the protagonist.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
