    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group in question.**\nThe generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted by $Q_{128}$. Its order is $2^n=128$, so $n=7$. This group, $Q_{2^n}$, has the following presentation:\n$Q_{128} = Q_{2^7} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{7-1}} = 1, x^{2^{7-2}} = y^2, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \\rangle$\nThis simplifies to:\n$Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nKey properties of $Q_{128}$:\n*   The order of the group is 128.\n*   The element $x$ generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64, which is a normal subgroup of index 2.\n*   All elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ are of the form $yx^k$ for some integer $k$.\n*   Let's find the order of elements of the form $yx^k$:\n    $(yx^k)^2 = yx^k yx^k = y(x^k y)x^k = y(y x^{-k})x^k = y^2 x^{-k} x^k = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    $(yx^k)^4 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n    Thus, every element outside the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ has order 4.\n*   The orders of elements in $Q_{128}$ are divisors of 64 (for elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$) and 4 (for elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$). The exponent of the group, which is the least common multiple of the orders of all elements, is $\\text{lcm}(64, 4) = 64$.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"power subgroup\".**\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it is of the form $H = G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for some integer $k$. Our task is to find how many distinct subgroups of $Q_{128}$ can be formed in this way.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the problem by analyzing the exponent $k$.**\nLet $k$ be any integer. We can write $k = m \\cdot 2^j$ where $m$ is an odd integer and $j \\ge 0$.\nWe want to compute the subgroup $Q_{128}^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in Q_{128} \\rangle$.\n$g^k = g^{m \\cdot 2^j} = (g^m)^{2^j}$.\nA key theorem in group theory states that if $\\gcd(m, |G|) = 1$, then the map $\\phi: G \\to G$ defined by $\\phi(g) = g^m$ is a bijection (a permutation of the elements of $G$).\nIn our case, $G = Q_{128}$, so $|G| = 128 = 2^7$. Since $m$ is odd, $\\gcd(m, 128) = 1$. Therefore, the set $\\{g^m \\mid g \\in Q_{128}\\}$ is the same as the set $Q_{128}$.\nLet $h = g^m$. As $g$ ranges over all elements of $Q_{128}$, so does $h$.\nSo, the set of generators for $Q_{128}^k$ is:\n$\\{ g^k \\mid g \\in Q_{128} \\} = \\{ (g^m)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in Q_{128} \\} = \\{ h^{2^j} \\mid h \\in Q_{128} \\}$.\nThis implies that $Q_{128}^k = Q_{128}^{m \\cdot 2^j} = Q_{128}^{2^j}$.\nThis greatly simplifies the problem: we only need to find the distinct subgroups for exponents that are powers of 2.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the power subgroups for exponents $2^j$.**\nThe exponent of $Q_{128}$ is 64. Any power $g^k$ is equal to $g^{\\gcd(k, 64)}$. Thus, we only need to check exponents $k$ that are divisors of 64, which are powers of 2 from $2^0=1$ to $2^6=64$. We can also include $k=0$, which gives the trivial subgroup.\n\n*   **k = 2<sup>0</sup> = 1**: $Q_{128}^1 = \\langle g^1 \\mid g \\in Q_{128} \\rangle = Q_{128}$. This is the whole group.\n*   **k = 2<sup>1</sup> = 2**: We need to compute $Q_{128}^2 = \\langle g^2 \\mid g \\in Q_{128} \\rangle$.\n    *   If $g = x^i \\in \\langle x \\rangle$, then $g^2 = x^{2i}$. The set of these elements forms the subgroup $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   If $g = yx^i \\notin \\langle x \\rangle$, then $g^2 = x^{32}$.\n    *   The set of all squares is $S_2 = \\{x^{2i}\\} \\cup \\{x^{32}\\} = \\langle x^2 \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{32}\\}$. Since $x^{32} = (x^{16})^2$, $x^{32}$ is already in $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$. So, $S_2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   Thus, $Q_{128}^2 = \\langle S_2 \\rangle = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n*   **k = 2<sup>2</sup> = 4**: We need to compute $Q_{128}^4 = \\langle g^4 \\mid g \\in Q_{128} \\rangle$.\n    *   If $g = x^i$, $g^4 = x^{4i}$. These form the subgroup $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   If $g = yx^i$, its order is 4, so $g^4=1$.\n    *   The set of 4th powers is $S_4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle \\cup \\{1\\} = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   Thus, $Q_{128}^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order 16.\n*   **k = 2<sup>j</sup> for j â‰¥ 2**: The same logic applies. For $g=yx^i$, its order is 4, so $g^{2^j} = (g^4)^{2^{j-2}} = 1$. The set of $2^j$-th powers is just $\\langle x^{2^j} \\rangle$. So, $Q_{128}^{2^j} = \\langle x^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    *   **j = 3 (k=8)**: $Q_{128}^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$, order 8.\n    *   **j = 4 (k=16)**: $Q_{128}^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$, order 4.\n    *   **j = 5 (k=32)**: $Q_{128}^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, order 2.\n    *   **j = 6 (k=64)**: $Q_{128}^{64} = \\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\langle 1 \\rangle = \\{1\\}$, the trivial subgroup.\n\n**Step 5: Count the distinct subgroups.**\nWe have found the following set of power subgroups:\n1.  $Q_{128}^1 = Q_{128}$ (order 128)\n2.  $Q_{128}^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n3.  $Q_{128}^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n4.  $Q_{128}^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n5.  $Q_{128}^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n6.  $Q_{128}^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n7.  $Q_{128}^{64} = \\{1\\}$ (order 1)\n\nThese 7 subgroups all have different orders, so they are all distinct. Any other exponent $k$ will produce one of these subgroups. For example, $Q_{128}^0 = \\{1\\}$, which is the same as $Q_{128}^{64}$. An exponent like $k=6=3 \\cdot 2$ will give $Q_{128}^6 = Q_{128}^2$.\n\nThus, there are exactly 7 distinct power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128."
