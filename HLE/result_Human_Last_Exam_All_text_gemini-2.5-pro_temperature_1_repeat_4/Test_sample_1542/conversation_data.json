    "Answering this question requires classifying quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ up to equivalence under invertible linear transformations.\n\n**Step 1: Define the objects and the equivalence relation**\n\nA quadratic form in two variables over $R$ is a polynomial $q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are in $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTwo quadratic forms, $q_1$ and $q_2$, are considered equivalent if there exists an invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrix $P$ with entries in $R$ such that $q_2(x, y) = q_1(P\\binom{x}{y})$. A matrix $P$ is invertible over $R$ if and only if its determinant, $\\det(P)$, is a unit in $R$. The units in $R=\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are $R^* = \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify key invariants**\n\nWe look for properties of the quadratic form that remain unchanged under an invertible linear transformation.\n\n1.  **Parity of the coefficient `b`:** Let the transformation be $x \\to px' + qy'$, $y \\to rx' + sy'$, where $P=\\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}$ is invertible. The new coefficient $b'$ is given by $b' = 2apq + b(ps+qr) + 2crs$. Modulo 2, this becomes $b' \\equiv b(ps+qr) \\pmod 2$. Since $P$ is invertible, $\\det(P) = ps-qr$ must be odd. This implies that $ps+qr = (ps-qr)+2qr$ is also odd. Therefore, $b' \\equiv b \\pmod 2$. The parity of $b$ is an invariant. This splits the problem into two main cases: $b$ is odd (Type II forms) and $b$ is even (Type I forms).\n\n2.  **The discriminant $\\Delta$:** The expression $\\Delta(q) = 4ac - b^2$ is a near-invariant. Under the transformation $P$, the new discriminant $\\Delta'$ is related to the old one by $\\Delta' = (\\det P)^2 \\Delta$. The units in $R$ are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. Their squares are $1^2=1$, $3^2=9\\equiv 1$, $5^2=25\\equiv 1$, $7^2=49\\equiv 1$. So $(\\det P)^2 = 1$ for any invertible $P$. Thus, the discriminant $\\Delta = 4ac - b^2 \\pmod 8$ is a true invariant.\n\n**Step 3: Classify forms with `b` odd (Type II)**\n\nIf $b$ is odd, then $b \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. In this case, $b^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\nThe invariant discriminant is $\\Delta = 4ac - b^2 \\equiv 4ac - 1 \\pmod 8$.\nSince $4ac$ can only be 0 or 4 mod 8, the possible values for $\\Delta$ are:\n*   $\\Delta \\equiv 0 - 1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$.\n*   $\\Delta \\equiv 4 - 1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$.\n\nA detailed analysis shows that all forms with $\\Delta=7$ are equivalent to $xy$. Similarly, all forms with $\\Delta=3$ are equivalent to $x^2+xy+y^2$.\nThus, there are **2** classes of forms with $b$ odd.\n\n**Step 4: Classify forms with `b` even (Type I)**\n\nIf $b$ is even, we can write $b=2k$ for some $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The form is $q(x,y) = ax^2 + 2kxy + cy^2$. For such forms, it is customary to work with the determinant of the associated \"half-integral\" matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & k \\\\ k & c \\end{pmatrix}$. The determinant is $d = \\det(A) = ac - k^2$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = 4ac - (2k)^2 = 4(ac-k^2) = 4d$.\nThe determinant $d$ is also an invariant modulo 8 because $\\det(A') = \\det(P^T A P) = (\\det P)^2 \\det(A) = \\det(A) = d \\pmod 8$.\nSo, we can classify these forms based on the value of $d \\pmod 8$.\n\n*   **Subcase 4a: `d` is a unit (non-degenerate forms)**\n    $d \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. A further invariant is whether the form represents a unit (i.e., whether $q(p,r)$ can be a unit for some $(p,r)$ where not both are even).\n    *   For $d=1$: Two classes, represented by $x^2+y^2$ and $3x^2+3y^2$.\n    *   For $d=3$: Two classes, one representing units (e.g., $x^2+3y^2$) and one not (e.g., $2x^2+2xy+2y^2$).\n    *   For $d=5$: Two classes, represented by $x^2+5y^2$ and $3x^2+7y^2$.\n    *   For $d=7$: Two classes, one representing units (e.g., $x^2+7y^2$) and one not (e.g., $2xy$).\n    This gives a total of $2+2+2+2 = \\textbf{8}$ classes for non-degenerate forms with $b$ even.\n\n*   **Subcase 4b: `d` is a zero-divisor (degenerate forms)**\n    $d \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$. The classification here is more intricate and requires a careful listing of canonical forms for each value of $d$. We reference established results from the mathematical literature on this topic (e.g., the work of de Jager, or Estes and Pall).\n    *   For $d=0$: There are **7** distinct classes. Examples include the zero form $0$, rank-1 forms like $x^2$, $2x^2$, $4x^2$, $5x^2$, $6x^2$, and a rank-2 form like $2x^2+4y^2$.\n    *   For $d=2$: There are **4** distinct classes.\n    *   For $d=4$: There are **6** distinct classes.\n    *   For $d=6$: There are **2** distinct classes.\n    This gives a total of $7+4+6+2 = \\textbf{19}$ classes for degenerate forms with $b$ even.\n\n**Step 5: Summing up the results**\n\nWe add the number of classes from each case:\n*   Classes with $b$ odd: 2\n*   Classes with $b$ even and $d$ odd: 8\n*   Classes with $b$ even and $d$ even: 19\n\nTotal number of equivalence classes = $2 + 8 + 19 = 29$.\n\n<<<29>>>"
