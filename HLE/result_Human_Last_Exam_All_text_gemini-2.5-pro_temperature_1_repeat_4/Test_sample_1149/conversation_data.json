    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question is about a specific anatomical feature of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*. This species is a spinosaurid theropod from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil. The primary source of information is the scientific description of its holotype skull, specimen SMNS 58022.\n\n2.  **Identify the Anatomical Feature:** The question focuses on the \"lacrimal recess\". The lacrimal is a bone in the skull located in front of the eye socket. A recess is a depression or indentation on a bone, often related to pneumaticity (air sacs). The question asks for the number of smaller depressions *contained within* this main recess.\n\n3.  **Consult the Primary Scientific Literature:** The most authoritative source on the skull anatomy of *Irritator challengeri* is the 2002 paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, titled \"*Irritator challengeri*, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\". This paper provides a detailed description of the holotype skull.\n\n4.  **Locate the Relevant Description:** Within the Sues et al. (2002) paper, the description of the lacrimal bone is key. The authors state: \"Dorsal to the antorbital fossa, the lateral surface of the lacrimal is deeply excavated by a large lacrimal recess...\".\n\n5.  **Count the Subdivisions:** The paper continues with a crucial detail about the internal structure of this recess. It says: \"This recess is subdivided by a vertical ridge into a larger, anterior pneumatic depression and a smaller, posterior one.\"\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the scientific description, the single large lacrimal recess is itself divided into two distinct, smaller depressions. Therefore, the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains two depressions.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of the Dinosaur:** The anatomy described is specific to *Irritator challengeri*. Other spinosaurids might have a different configuration, so generalizing is not appropriate.\n*   **Anatomical Hierarchy:** It is important to distinguish between the lacrimal recess as a whole and the depressions *within* it. The question specifically asks what the recess *contains*.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The answer relies directly on the peer-reviewed scientific paper that first described the specimen in detail, which is the most reliable source of information.\n*   **Wording:** The phrasing \"a larger, anterior... and a smaller, posterior one\" clearly indicates a count of two.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the primary scientific literature, the lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* is subdivided into an anterior and a posterior depression.\n\n<<<2>>>"
