    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d=53599$.\n*   We test for small prime factors. $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$\n*   $53599 = 13 \\times 4123$\n*   $53599 = 19 \\times 2821$\n*   We then factor 2821: $2821 = 31 \\times 91$.\n*   And $91 = 7 \\times 13$.\n*   Putting it all together, we get $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nLet's denote the prime factors as $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$. The conductor $d$ is a square-free integer.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Primitive Characters for a Square-Free Conductor\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo $d$, denoted $\\mathcal{G}_d$, is isomorphic to the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since $d = p_1p_2p_3p_4$, we have:\n$\\mathcal{G}_d \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/p_1\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/p_2\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/p_3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/p_4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n\nThis isomorphism implies that any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\nA character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is **primitive** if it is not induced by a character modulo a proper divisor of $d$. For a square-free conductor $d=p_1p_2...p_k$, this condition simplifies: $\\chi = \\chi_1\\chi_2...\\chi_k$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is non-trivial. A non-trivial character is any character other than the principal character (whose values are all 1 for inputs coprime to the modulus).\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Order of a Character\nThe order of a character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_2), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_3), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\nWe are looking for characters of order 6.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Component Characters\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p_i$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$. The order of any character $\\chi_i$ must divide $p_i - 1$. Let's calculate these values:\n*   For $p_1=7$: $\\phi(7) = 7-1 = 6$\n*   For $p_2=13$: $\\phi(13) = 13-1 = 12$\n*   For $p_3=19$: $\\phi(19) = 19-1 = 18$\n*   For $p_4=31$: $\\phi(31) = 31-1 = 30$\n\nWe need $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_2), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_3), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\nThis has two implications:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  At least one $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)$ must be a multiple of 2, and at least one must be a multiple of 3.\n\nFrom the primitivity condition, each $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial, so $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i) > 1$. Therefore, the possible orders for each $\\chi_i$ are divisors of 6 greater than 1, i.e., $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nWe need to check if these orders are possible for each component. An order $k$ is possible for a character $\\chi_i$ if $k$ divides $p_i-1$.\n*   For $p_1=7, p_1-1=6$: Orders 2, 3, 6 are all possible.\n*   For $p_2=13, p_2-1=12$: Orders 2, 3, 6 are all possible.\n*   For $p_3=19, p_3-1=18$: Orders 2, 3, 6 are all possible.\n*   For $p_4=31, p_4-1=30$: Orders 2, 3, 6 are all possible.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Number of Characters\nWe need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ is non-trivial and $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)) = 6$. We can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-trivial character modulo $p_i$ and its order divides 6.\nThe number of characters modulo $p_i$ whose order divides $k$ (for $k | p_i-1$) is $k$. The number of non-trivial ones is $k-1$. Since 6 divides $p_i-1$ for all our primes, there are $6-1=5$ choices for each $\\chi_i$.\nThe total number of tuples in $S$ is $|S| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we must subtract the tuples from $S$ where the LCM of the orders is not 6. Since all orders divide 6, the LCM must also divide 6. The cases to exclude are when the LCM is a proper divisor of 6, i.e., 1, 2, or 3. As all characters are non-trivial, their orders are greater than 1, so the LCM cannot be 1.\n\n*   **Case 1: The LCM of the orders divides 3.**\n    This occurs if and only if the order of every component character $\\chi_i$ divides 3. Since the characters are non-trivial, their orders must be 3. The number of characters of order 3 modulo $p_i$ is given by $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    The number of such tuples is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   **Case 2: The LCM of the orders divides 2.**\n    This occurs if and only if the order of every component character $\\chi_i$ divides 2. Since the characters are non-trivial, their orders must be 2. The number of characters of order 2 modulo $p_i$ is given by $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    The number of such tuples is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nThe set of tuples where the LCM divides 3 and the set where the LCM divides 2 are disjoint (a character's order cannot be both 2 and 3). Therefore, the number of tuples where the LCM is 6 is:\nNumber = $|S|$ - (Number where LCM divides 3) - (Number where LCM divides 2)\nNumber = $625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\nFinal Answer: There are 608 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6."
