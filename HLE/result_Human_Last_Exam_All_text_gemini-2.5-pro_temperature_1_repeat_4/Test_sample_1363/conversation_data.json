    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing that turns to the left. It's a fundamental building block in most of the dances listed.\n*   **Overturning a Turn:** This means adding more rotation to a figure than is prescribed in the standard technical syllabus. For example, turning a full 360 degrees on a figure that normally calls for a 270-degree (3/4) turn.\n*   **Technique:** This refers to the unique set of rules and principles that define a specific dance's character. This includes elements like posture, footwork, rise and fall, sway, CBM (Contrary Body Movement), and the nature of the movement (e.g., smooth and flowing vs. sharp and staccato).\n*   **The Question's Constraint:** The key phrase is \"impossible... without disregarding the technique.\" This means we are looking for a dance where the fundamental principles are so rigid that attempting to overturn a reverse turn would violate the very essence of how that dance is supposed to be performed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Dance Option**\n\nLet's examine the technique of each dance and how it relates to overturning a reverse turn. The dances listed can be broadly categorized into \"Swing\" dances and \"Non-Swing\" dances.\n\n*   **Swing Dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep):** These dances are characterized by a continuous, flowing motion, momentum, body flight, and often incorporate sway and rise & fall. This continuous momentum is what allows dancers to \"swing\" through turns.\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This dance is defined by continuous rotation. While figures have set amounts of turn, the entire dance is about turning. Modifying the amount of rotation is feasible within its technical framework.\n    *   **B. English Waltz:** Characterized by significant rise and fall and body sway. Overturning a reverse turn is a common and recognized variation used for choreographic purposes, especially for navigating corners. This action uses the principles of sway and momentum and does not violate the core technique.\n    *   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Known for its smooth, gliding, continuous movement. Like the Waltz, an overturned reverse turn is a standard, named variation in the Foxtrot syllabus. It is perfectly compatible with the dance's technique of continuous travel and body flight.\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** A fast, energetic swing dance. Its technique allows for and even encourages dynamic rotational figures. Overturning turns fits well within its lively character.\n\n*   **Non-Swing Dance (European Tango):**\n    *   **C. European Tango:** This dance stands apart from the others. Its technique is fundamentally different.\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dancers maintain a constant, level height.\n        *   **No Sway:** The upper body is held strong and still, without the pendulum-like sway of the swing dances.\n        *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, clipped, and decisive, not flowing.\n        *   **No Body Flight:** The feet are picked up and placed deliberately. There is no sense of \"flying\" or \"swinging\" through the air.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize and Conclude**\n\nNow, let's consider overturning a reverse turn in the context of Tango technique.\n\nTo overturn a turn, a dancer needs to generate and use rotational momentum. This momentum naturally creates a swinging action, which in turn leads to body sway and a tendency to rise. All of these elements—swing, sway, and rise—are explicitly forbidden by the core technique of European Tango.\n\nTherefore, to overturn a Tango reverse turn, one would have to abandon the staccato action, the level body position, and the still frame. You would have to introduce swing and momentum. In doing so, you are no longer dancing Tango; you are applying the technique of a different dance style. It is, therefore, \"impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique\" of the Tango.\n\n<<<C>>>"
