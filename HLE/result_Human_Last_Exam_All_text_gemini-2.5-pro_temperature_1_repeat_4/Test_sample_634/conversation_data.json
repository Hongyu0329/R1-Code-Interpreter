    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of GCRD**\n\nA polynomial matrix $G(s)$ is a greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$ if:\n1.  $G(s)$ is a common right divisor of both $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$. This means there exist polynomial matrices $\\hat{P_1}(s)$ and $\\hat{P_2}(s)$ such that $P_1(s) = \\hat{P_1}(s)G(s)$ and $P_2(s) = \\hat{P_2}(s)G(s)$.\n2.  Any other common right divisor $D(s)$ is a right divisor of $G(s)$. This means there exists a polynomial matrix $H(s)$ such that $G(s) = H(s)D(s)$.\n\nThe GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant).\n\n**Step 2: Set up the Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\n\nThe GCRD can be found by applying elementary row operations to the stacked matrix formed by $P_1$ and $P_2$. The goal is to reduce this stacked matrix to a form where the lower part consists of zero rows, and the upper part is the GCRD.\n\nLet's form the stacked matrix $M(s)$:\n$M(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} P_1(s) \\\\ P_2(s) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nLet the rows be denoted by $R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Perform Elementary Row Operations**\n\nOur strategy is to use the rows with the polynomials of the lowest degree to eliminate the terms in other rows. The degrees in the first column are 2, 2, 1, and 1. We can use $R_3 = [s, 0]$ to simplify $R_1$ and $R_2$.\n\n1.  Replace $R_1$ with $R_1 - (s+1)R_3$:\n    $R_1' = [s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s] = [0, -s]$\n\n2.  Replace $R_2$ with $R_2 + sR_3$:\n    $R_2' = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s[s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2] = [-1, s^2]$\n\n3.  Replace $R_4$ with $R_4 + R_3$:\n    $R_4' = [-s - 1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-s - 1 + s, 1] = [-1, 1]$\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n$M_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -s \\\\ -1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we have a simpler matrix. Let's use the new row $R_4' = [-1, 1]$ (which has constant terms) to simplify the other rows. Let's call the current rows $R_1', R_2', R_3, R_4'$.\n\n4.  Replace $R_2'$ with $R_2' - R_4'$:\n    $R_2'' = [-1, s^2] - [-1, 1] = [0, s^2 - 1]$\n\n5.  Replace $R_3$ with $R_3 + sR_4'$:\n    $R_3' = [s, 0] + s[-1, 1] = [s - s, s] = [0, s]$\n\n6.  Replace $R_1'$ with $R_1' + sR_4'$:\n    $R_1'' = [0, -s] + s[-1, 1] = [-s, 0]$\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n$M_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -s & 0 \\\\ 0 & s^2 - 1 \\\\ 0 & s \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nLet's reorder the rows for clarity and to place the simplest row at the top (this is an elementary operation).\n$M_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s \\\\ 0 & s^2 - 1 \\\\ -s & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, use the new top row $R_1^* = [-1, 1]$ to eliminate the last row.\n\n7.  Replace $R_4^*$ with $R_4^* - sR_1^*$:\n    $R_4^{**} = [-s, 0] - s[-1, 1] = [-s + s, -s] = [0, -s]$\n\nThe matrix is now:\n$M_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s \\\\ 0 & s^2 - 1 \\\\ 0 & -s \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we focus on the last three rows, which have a zero in the first column. Use the row with the lowest degree in the second column, which is $R_2^* = [0, s]$.\n\n8.  Replace $R_4^{**}$ with $R_4^{**} + R_2^*$:\n    $R_4^{***} = [0, -s] + [0, s] = [0, 0]$\n\n9.  Replace $R_3^*$ with $R_3^* - sR_2^*$:\n    $R_3^{**} = [0, s^2 - 1] - s[0, s] = [0, s^2 - 1 - s^2] = [0, -1]$\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n$M_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe now have two zero rows and two non-zero rows. Let's clean up the remaining non-zero rows using the row $R_3^{**} = [0, -1]$.\n\n10. Replace $R_1^*$ with $R_1^* + R_3^{**}$:\n    $R_1^{**} = [-1, 1] + [0, -1] = [-1, 0]$\n\n11. Replace $R_2^*$ with $R_2^* + sR_3^{**}$:\n    $R_2^{**} = [0, s] + s[0, -1] = [0, s - s] = [0, 0]$\n\nThe final matrix is:\n$M_{final} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 4: Identify the GCRD**\n\nBy rearranging the rows, we get the form $\\begin{pmatrix} G(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe non-zero part of the final matrix is the GCRD.\n$G(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix. The matrix we found is unimodular (determinant is 1). Another valid GCRD is the identity matrix $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which can be obtained by left-multiplying our result by $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The matrix obtained directly from the algorithm is a correct answer.\n\n<<<$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$>>>"
