    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The core of the question is to identify a specific \"book of manners\" that was physically preserved in the same manuscript as the poem \"Sir Launfal\". This requires knowledge of the manuscript tradition of this medieval romance.\n\n2.  **Identify \"Sir Launfal\" and its Manuscript(s)**: The name \"Sir Launfal\" can refer to more than one Middle English poem about the same character.\n    *   The most famous version is **Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal***. This poem survives in only one manuscript: **British Library, Cotton Caligula A.ii**.\n    *   An earlier, anonymous version of the story is titled ***Sir Landevale***. This poem is preserved in the manuscript **Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson C. 86**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Contents of Each Manuscript**: To answer the question, we must look at the table of contents for each manuscript.\n    *   **Cotton Caligula A.ii (containing Chestre's *Sir Launfal*)**: This manuscript is a well-known collection of Middle English romances. Its contents include *The Erl of Tolous*, *The Squyr of Lowe Degre*, and *Emare*, among others. It does **not** contain a text that is classified as a book of manners or a courtesy book.\n    *   **MS Rawlinson C. 86 (containing *Sir Landevale*)**: This manuscript is a miscellany containing a variety of texts. Alongside *Sir Landevale*, it also contains the romance *Sir Isumbras* and, crucially, a courtesy poem.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\"**: In the manuscript MS Rawlinson C. 86, the poem *Sir Landevale* is preserved alongside a short instructional poem on moral and social conduct. This text is known as **\"The ABC of Aristotle\"**. It is a classic example of a medieval \"book of manners\" or courtesy book, offering advice framed as a letter from Aristotle to his pupil, Alexander the Great.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Conclusion**: Since the manuscript containing the most famous version of the poem (*Sir Launfal*) does not include a book of manners, the question must be referring to the closely related version (*Sir Landevale*) which *is* preserved alongside one. Therefore, the book of manners preserved alongside the Launfal story is \"The ABC of Aristotle\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Variant Texts**: It is essential to recognize that \"Sir Launfal\" exists in different versions with slightly different titles, preserved in different manuscripts. The answer depends entirely on identifying the correct manuscript.\n*   **Manuscript Contents**: The answer is not found in the text of *Sir Launfal* itself, but in the physical context of the manuscript in which it was copied and bound.\n*   **Genre Identification**: One must correctly identify \"The ABC of Aristotle\" as belonging to the genre of \"book of manners\" or \"courtesy book.\"\n*   **Interpreting the Question**: The question uses the more common name \"Sir Launfal\" but refers to the context of its variant, \"Sir Landevale\". This is a common ambiguity when dealing with medieval texts, and the correct answer requires understanding this relationship.\n\nBased on this analysis, the book of manners preserved alongside the Launfal story is \"The ABC of Aristotle\".\n\n<<<The ABC of Aristotle>>>"
