    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the structure of the semidihedral group and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group in question.**\n\nThe group is the semidihedral group of size 512. The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n$G = SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor our problem, the group size is $512 = 2^9$. So we have $n=9$.\nThe group is $G = SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\nThe group $G$ consists of $512$ elements, which can be divided into two sets:\n1.  The cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle = \\{r^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$, which is isomorphic to $C_{256}$.\n2.  The coset $s\\langle r \\rangle = \\{sr^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the concept of a power subgroup.**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $H = G^k$, where $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the powers of elements in G.**\n\nWe need to compute $g^k$ for an arbitrary element $g \\in G$ and integer $k$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $g$ is in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.**\n    If $g = r^i$, then $g^k = (r^i)^k = r^{ik}$.\n    The set of all such powers is $\\{ (r^i)^k \\mid i=0, ..., 255 \\} = (\\langle r \\rangle)^k$. This forms a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{\\text{gcd}(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $g$ is in the coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$.**\n    If $g = sr^i$, we first need to determine the order of $g$. The order depends on whether $i$ is even or odd. A standard result for semidihedral groups is:\n    $(sr^i)^2 = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}}$. In our case, $n=9$, so $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128i}$.\n    - If $i$ is even (e.g., $i=2j$), then $(sr^{2j})^2 = r^{128(2j)} = r^{256j} = (r^{256})^j = 1$. So, elements of the form $sr^{2j}$ have order 2.\n    - If $i$ is odd (e.g., $i=2j+1$), then $(sr^{2j+1})^2 = r^{128(2j+1)} = r^{256j+128} = r^{128}$. Since $r^{128}$ has order 2, the order of $sr^{2j+1}$ is 4.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the power subgroups $G^k$ for different values of $k$.**\n\nWe can classify the integer $k$ based on its divisibility by 2.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: $k$ is odd.**\n    - For elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$: Since $k$ is odd, $\\text{gcd}(k, 256) = 1$. Thus, $(\\langle r \\rangle)^k = \\langle r^1 \\rangle = \\langle r \\rangle$. The powers generate the entire cyclic subgroup.\n    - For elements in $s\\langle r \\rangle$:\n        - If $g = sr^{2j}$ (order 2) and $k$ is odd, $g^k = g = sr^{2j}$.\n        - If $g = sr^{2j+1}$ (order 4) and $k$ is odd, $g^k$ is either $g$ or $g^3$. In both subcases, the resulting element is in the coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$. All elements of $s\\langle r \\rangle$ are produced.\n    - Combining these results, if $k$ is odd, $G^k = \\langle r \\rangle \\cup s\\langle r \\rangle = G$.\n    This gives us **1** distinct power subgroup: $G$ itself.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: $k$ is even.** We can further divide this into two sub-scenarios.\n\n    *   **Sub-scenario 2a: $k$ is a multiple of 2 but not 4 (i.e., $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$).**\n        - For elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$: Let $k=2m$ with $m$ odd. $\\text{gcd}(k, 256) = \\text{gcd}(2m, 256) = 2 \\cdot \\text{gcd}(m, 128) = 2$. So $(\\langle r \\rangle)^k = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n        - For elements in $s\\langle r \\rangle$:\n            - If $g = sr^{2j}$ (order 2) and $k$ is even, $g^k = 1$.\n            - If $g = sr^{2j+1}$ (order 4) and $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$, $g^k = g^2 = r^{128}$.\n        - Combining these, $G^k = \\langle r^2 \\rangle \\cup \\{1\\} \\cup \\{r^{128}\\}$. Since $r^{128} = (r^2)^{64}$, it is already an element of $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n        - So for any $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$, $G^k = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n        This gives us **1** new distinct power subgroup: $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Sub-scenario 2b: $k$ is a multiple of 4 (i.e., $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$).**\n        - For elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$: The set of powers is $\\langle r^{\\text{gcd}(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n        - For elements in $s\\langle r \\rangle$: All these elements have order 2 or 4. Since $k$ is a multiple of 4, $g^k=1$ for any $g \\in s\\langle r \\rangle$.\n        - Therefore, for $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, $G^k = \\langle r^{\\text{gcd}(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n        The value of $d = \\text{gcd}(k, 256)$ must be a divisor of 256. Since $k$ is a multiple of 4, $d$ must also be a multiple of 4. The divisors of 256 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$. Those that are multiples of 4 are:\n        $4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.\n        For each of these values $d$, we can find a $k$ (e.g., $k=d$) such that $\\text{gcd}(k, 256)=d$. This gives us the following distinct power subgroups:\n        1.  $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$\n        2.  $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$\n        3.  $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$\n        4.  $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$\n        5.  $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$\n        6.  $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$\n        7.  $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n        This gives us **7** new distinct power subgroups.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count.**\n\nSumming up the number of distinct subgroups from all scenarios:\n- From $k$ being odd: 1 subgroup ($G$)\n- From $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$: 1 subgroup ($\\langle r^2 \\rangle$)\n- From $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$: 7 subgroups ($\\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\dots, \\{1\\}$)\n\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is $1 + 1 + 7 = 9$.\n\nThe list of all power subgroups is: $\\{G, \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\{1\\}\\}$.\n\n<<<9>>>"
