    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the sequence and look for a simple pattern.**\nThe sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nLet's find the difference between consecutive terms (first-order differences).\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no simple arithmetic progression.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a multiplicative or more complex relationship.**\nLet's test if each term can be derived from the previous one by multiplication and addition/subtraction.\n*   From 2 to 11: `2 * 5 + 1 = 11`, `2 * 4 + 3 = 11`, `2 * 3 + 5 = 11`, `2 * 2 + 7 = 11`.\n*   From 11 to 23: `11 * 2 + 1 = 23`.\n*   From 23 to 51: `23 * 2 + 5 = 51`.\n*   From 51 to 119: `51 * 2 + 17 = 119`.\nThis `*2 + C` pattern gives a sequence of added numbers {7, 1, 5, 17}, which does not have an obvious pattern.\n\nLet's try a different multiplier, for instance, 3.\n*   From 2 to 11: `3 * 2 + 5 = 11`.\n*   From 11 to 23: `3 * 11 - 10 = 23`.\n*   From 23 to 51: `3 * 23 - 18 = 69 - 18 = 51`.\n*   From 51 to 119: `3 * 51 - 34 = 153 - 34 = 119`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the emerging pattern.**\nThe pattern appears to be `a_n = 3 * a_(n-1) - C` where `a_n` is the current term and `a_(n-1)` is the previous term.\nThe sequence of operations is: `*3 + 5`, `*3 - 10`, `*3 - 18`, `*3 - 34`.\nTo make this uniform, we can write `+5` as `-(-5)`.\nSo, the sequence of numbers being subtracted (let's call it `C_n`) is: `{-5, 10, 18, 34, ...}`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the pattern within the sequence of subtracted numbers `C_n`.**\nLet's find the differences between the terms in the sequence `C_n = {-5, 10, 18, 34}`.\n*   `10 - (-5) = 15`\n*   `18 - 10 = 8`\n*   `34 - 18 = 16`\nThe sequence of differences is `{15, 8, 16, ...}`.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the pattern of the differences.**\nIn the sequence `{15, 8, 16, ...}`, we can observe a clear geometric progression starting from the second term.\n*   8\n*   `8 * 2 = 16`\nThe first term (15) is an anomaly, which is a common feature in more difficult number sequence puzzles. The underlying pattern of the differences is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2.\n\n**Step 6: Predict the next term in the difference sequence.**\nFollowing the pattern, the next term after 16 would be:\n*   `16 * 2 = 32`\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the next term in the `C_n` sequence.**\nWe add the next difference (32) to the last term of `C_n` (34).\n*   Next term in `C_n` = `34 + 32 = 66`.\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the missing number in the original sequence.**\nNow we apply the main pattern `a_n = 3 * a_(n-1) - C_n` to find the missing number `a_6`.\n*   `a_6 = 3 * a_5 - 66`\n*   `a_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`\n*   `a_6 = 357 - 66`\n*   `a_6 = 291`\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
