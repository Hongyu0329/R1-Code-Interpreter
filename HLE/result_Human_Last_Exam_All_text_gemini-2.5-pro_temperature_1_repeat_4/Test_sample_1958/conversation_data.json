    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for two specific pieces of information:\n    *   The first book of the Bible, following the standard canonical order, that is mentioned by its actual name.\n    *   The Shakespeare play in which this mention occurs.\n\n2.  **Establish the Search Criteria:**\n    *   **\"first book... in canonical order\"**: We must proceed through the books of the Bible as they are ordered, starting with Genesis. The Protestant canon is the most relevant for Shakespeare's England.\n    *   **\"mentioned by name\"**: This is the most important constraint. We are not looking for allusions, quotes, or characters (unless the character's name is also the book's title). We need the literal name of the book, such as \"Genesis,\" \"Job,\" or \"Psalms.\"\n\n3.  **Systematic Search Through the Bible:**\n\n    *   **Genesis to Esther:** We begin with the books of the Pentateuch, the historical books, and so on.\n        *   **Genesis:** The word \"Genesis\" does not appear in any play. There are many allusions to stories from Genesis (Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel), but the book is never named.\n        *   **Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy:** These book names do not appear.\n        *   **Numbers:** The word \"numbers\" appears frequently, but always in its common sense, referring to quantity or poetic meter, not the biblical book. For example, \"the numbers of the genders\" in *The Merry Wives of Windsor* refers to grammar.\n        *   **Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, etc.:** The names of these books are not mentioned. The words \"judges,\" \"kings,\" and \"chronicles\" are used, but always in their generic sense (e.g., a legal judge, a monarch, a historical record).\n        *   **Esther:** The name does not appear.\n\n    *   **The Book of Job:** Continuing in canonical order, the next book is Job.\n        *   We search for the name \"Job.\"\n        *   We find a clear mention in **The Merry Wives of Windsor**. In Act 5, Scene 5, a disgraced Falstaff laments his situation, declaring he is \"**as poor as Job... and as patient as Job**.\"\n        *   This is a direct mention of the character whose story is the entire subject of the Book of Job. Since the character's name is the title of the book, this counts as a mention of the book by name. This is our first strong candidate.\n\n    *   **The Book of Psalms:** The next book in the poetic section is Psalms.\n        *   We search for \"Psalm\" or \"Psalms.\"\n        *   We find another clear mention, also in **The Merry Wives of Windsor**. In Act 2, Scene 1, Mistress Ford complains about the mismatch between Falstaff's pious words and his lecherous intentions, comparing it to \"the **Hundredth Psalm** to the tune of ‘Green Sleeves.’\"\n        *   This is an explicit naming of a part of the Book of Psalms, which clearly identifies the book.\n\n    *   **Comparing Job and Psalms:**\n        *   Both \"Job\" and \"Psalms\" are mentioned by name in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.\n        *   The question asks for the *first* book in canonical order.\n        *   In the canonical order of the Old Testament, the Book of Job comes directly before the Book of Psalms.\n        *   Therefore, **Job** is the first one mentioned.\n\n4.  **Checking Later Books (for completeness):**\n    *   **Proverbs:** The word \"proverb\" is used often, but almost always to mean a common saying, not specifically the Book of Proverbs.\n    *   **Corinthians:** In *1 Henry IV*, Falstaff's companions are called \"Corinthians,\" but this is Elizabethan slang for revellers or profligates, derived from the ancient city's reputation. It is an allusion, not a direct naming of the epistle.\n    *   **Revelation:** In *The Comedy of Errors*, Dromio of Syracuse describes Doctor Pinch as having a \"book of revelation\" in some versions, but this is textually debated and likely means a book of prophecies in general, not necessarily the specific biblical book.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Mention vs. Allusion:** It is crucial to distinguish between naming the book and simply alluding to its content. Mentioning \"Adam\" is an allusion to Genesis; saying \"the Book of Genesis\" would be a direct mention.\n2.  **Common Words:** Words that are both book titles and common nouns (Numbers, Judges, Kings, Acts) must be checked in context to ensure they refer to the biblical book, which they do not in Shakespeare.\n3.  **Canonical Order:** The correct biblical order (Job before Psalms) is essential to determining which mention comes \"first.\"\n4.  **Character Name as Book Title:** When a character's name is also the book's title (like Job or Daniel), a clear reference to the character's story as told in that book constitutes a mention of the book by name. Falstaff's reference to the poverty and patience of Job is a direct invocation of the narrative contained within the Book of Job.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on this analysis, the first book of the Bible mentioned by name is Job. It is mentioned in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.\n\n***\n\nThe first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name is the Book of Job. It is mentioned in the play *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.\n<<<The first book is Job, and the play is The Merry Wives of Windsor.>>>"
