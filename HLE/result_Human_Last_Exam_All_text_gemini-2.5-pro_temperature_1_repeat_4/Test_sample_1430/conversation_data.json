    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the objects and the question**\n*   **C:** A compact Riemann surface of genus $g=3$. This is a smooth projective algebraic curve over $\\mathbb{C}$.\n*   **X = C^(15):** The 15th symmetric power of $C$. It is the variety parameterizing effective divisors of degree 15 on $C$. It is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Néron-Severi group NS(X):** The group of algebraic equivalence classes of divisors on $X$. Its rank, denoted $\\rho(X)$, is the Picard number of $X$.\n*   **The Goal:** Find the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(X)$ as $C$ varies over all genus 3 curves. This implies that $\\rho(X)$ depends on the specific geometry of $C$.\n\n**2. Relate the Picard number of X to the curve C**\nA fundamental result in the theory of symmetric products of curves relates the cohomology (and thus the Néron-Severi group) of the symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ to the cohomology of the curve $C$ and its Jacobian variety $J(C)$.\n\nFor a smooth curve $C$ of genus $g$ and an integer $d \\ge g$, there is an isomorphism of rational cohomology groups:\n$H^2(C^{(d)}, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q} \\cdot x \\oplus H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})$\n\nHere:\n*   $J(C)$ is the Jacobian of $C$, a $g$-dimensional abelian variety.\n*   $x$ is the cohomology class of the divisor $\\Theta_{p_0} = \\{D \\in C^{(d)} \\mid p_0 \\in \\text{supp}(D)\\}$ for a fixed base point $p_0 \\in C$. This class is independent of the choice of $p_0$.\n*   The second summand corresponds to the image of the pullback map $u_d^*: H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^2(C^{(d)}, \\mathbb{Q})$, where $u_d: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$ is the Abel-Jacobi map. For $d \\ge g$, this pullback map is injective on cohomology.\n\nIn our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. Since $15 \\ge 3$, this result applies.\n\nThe Picard number $\\rho(X)$ is the dimension of the space of rational (1,1)-classes in $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$. The decomposition above respects the Hodge structure.\n*   The class $x$ is the class of a divisor, so it is an algebraic cycle class. Thus, it is a rational (1,1)-class.\n*   The Abel-Jacobi map $u_d$ is holomorphic, so its pullback $u_d^*$ preserves Hodge types. This means that a class $\\alpha \\in H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})$ is of type (1,1) if and only if $u_d^*(\\alpha)$ is of type (1,1).\n\nFrom this, we deduce a crucial formula for the Picard number:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(d)}) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$, the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**3. Determine the smallest possible rank of NS(J(C))**\n*   $J(C)$ is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety (PPAV).\n*   The Néron-Severi group of any PPAV contains at least one non-trivial class, that of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Therefore, $\\rho(J(C)) \\ge 1$.\n*   For a *generic* curve $C$ of genus 3, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a simple abelian variety whose ring of endomorphisms is just the integers, $\\text{End}(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   In this generic case, the Néron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ is generated by the class of the principal polarization. Thus, for a generic curve $C$, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n\nThis is the minimum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$.\n\n**4. Determine the largest possible rank of NS(J(C))**\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}$. Let's compute $h^{1,1}(J(C))$.\n*   For an abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$, the Betti number $b_2(A) = \\dim H^2(A, \\mathbb{C})$ is $\\binom{2g}{2}$.\n*   The Hodge number $h^{2,0}(A) = \\dim H^0(A, \\Omega^2)$ is $\\binom{g}{2}$.\n*   The Hodge decomposition is $H^2(A, \\mathbb{C}) = H^{2,0}(A) \\oplus H^{1,1}(A) \\oplus H^{0,2}(A)$. So, $b_2(A) = h^{2,0} + h^{1,1} + h^{0,2} = 2h^{2,0} + h^{1,1}$.\n\nFor $J(C)$, we have $g=3$:\n*   $b_2(J(C)) = \\binom{2 \\cdot 3}{2} = \\binom{6}{2} = 15$.\n*   $h^{2,0}(J(C)) = \\binom{3}{2} = 3$.\n*   $h^{1,1}(J(C)) = b_2(J(C)) - 2h^{2,0}(J(C)) = 15 - 2(3) = 9$.\n\nSo, we have the bound $\\rho(J(C)) \\le h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\nThe question is whether this maximum can be achieved. Equality $\\rho(A) = h^{1,1}(A)$ holds for certain special abelian varieties, particularly those with sufficient complex multiplication (CM). We need to know if there exists a genus 3 curve $C$ such that its Jacobian $J(C)$ has $\\rho(J(C))=9$.\n\nSuch curves exist. A prime example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$.\n*   This curve has genus $g = \\frac{(4-1)(4-2)}{2} = 3$.\n*   Its Jacobian, $J(F_4)$, is known to be isogenous to the product $E \\times E \\times E = E^3$, where $E$ is the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$. This elliptic curve has complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n*   The Picard number of a product of CM elliptic curves $E^n$ is given by the formula $\\rho(E^n) = n\\rho(E) + \\binom{n}{2}\\text{rank}(\\text{End}(E))$. For the curve $E$, $\\rho(E)=1$ and $\\text{rank}(\\text{End}(E))=2$.\n*   For $J(F_4) \\sim E^3$, we have $\\rho(J(F_4)) = 3 \\cdot 1 + \\binom{3}{2} \\cdot 2 = 3 + 3 \\cdot 2 = 9$.\n\nSo, the maximum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 9.\n\n**5. Calculate the smallest and largest ranks for X**\n\nNow we substitute the minimum and maximum values of $\\rho(J(C))$ into our formula for $\\rho(X)$.\n\n*   **Smallest Rank:**\n    This occurs for a generic curve $C$, where $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n    $\\rho_{min}(X) = 1 + \\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Largest Rank:**\n    This occurs for a special curve like the Fermat quartic, where $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n    $\\rho_{max}(X) = 1 + \\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$ is given by the formula $\\rho(X) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$.\n*   The smallest possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 1 (for a generic curve).\n*   The largest possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 9 (for a curve with a CM Jacobian, e.g., the Fermat quartic).\n*   Therefore, the smallest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$ is $1+1=2$, and the largest is $1+9=10$.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
