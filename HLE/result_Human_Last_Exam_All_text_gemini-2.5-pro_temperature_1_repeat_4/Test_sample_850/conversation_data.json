    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three specific conditions simultaneously:\n1.  They must be **achiral**.\n2.  They must be **non-polar**.\n3.  They must have the **correct symmetry for optical activity**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Condition Individually\n\n**Condition 1: Correct Symmetry for Optical Activity**\n*   Optical activity (or optical gyration) is the phenomenon where a material rotates the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light.\n*   The fundamental symmetry requirement for a crystal to exhibit optical activity is that its point group must be **chiral**.\n*   A chiral object is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In crystallography, this means the crystal class must not possess any roto-inversion (or improper rotation) symmetry elements.\n*   The roto-inversion elements are:\n    *   A center of inversion ( $\\bar{1}$ )\n    *   A mirror plane ( $m$, which is equivalent to $\\bar{2}$ )\n    *   $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{6}$ roto-inversion axes.\n*   Therefore, any crystal class that is optically active must be one of the 11 chiral point groups: 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, and 432.\n\n**Condition 2: Achiral Crystal Classes**\n*   An achiral crystal class is the direct opposite of a chiral one.\n*   By definition, an achiral class must possess at least one roto-inversion symmetry element ($\\bar{1}, m, \\bar{3}, \\bar{4}, \\text{ or } \\bar{6}$).\n*   The presence of any of these symmetry elements makes the crystal superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n**Careful Point 1: A Fundamental Contradiction**\nThere is a direct and irreconcilable contradiction between Condition 1 and Condition 2.\n*   Condition 1 (\"correct symmetry for optical activity\") requires the crystal class to be **chiral**.\n*   Condition 2 explicitly requires the crystal class to be **achiral**.\nA crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time. A class either has roto-inversion axes (making it achiral and optically inactive) or it does not (making it chiral and optically active).\n\n**Condition 3: Non-polar Crystal Classes**\n*   A polar crystal class has a unique direction (a polar axis) that is not equivalent to its opposite direction due to the crystal's symmetry. Such crystals can exhibit pyroelectricity.\n*   There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n*   A **non-polar** crystal class is any class that is not in this list of 10. The presence of a center of inversion is a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for a class to be non-polar.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesize the Conditions\nTo find the answer, we must find the intersection of the sets of crystal classes defined by each condition.\n*   Set A = {Crystal classes with correct symmetry for optical activity} = {The 11 chiral classes}\n*   Set B = {Achiral crystal classes} = {The 21 non-chiral classes}\n*   Set C = {Non-polar crystal classes} = {The 22 non-polar classes}\n\nThe question asks for the intersection of these three sets: (A ∩ B ∩ C).\n\nLet's first find the intersection of Set A and Set B.\n*   A ∩ B = {Chiral classes} ∩ {Achiral classes}\n*   Since \"chiral\" and \"achiral\" are mutually exclusive properties, their intersection is the empty set: {}.\n\nBecause the intersection of the first two conditions is already the empty set, the intersection of all three conditions must also be the empty set.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe question contains a logical contradiction. The symmetry required for optical activity is chirality. The question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral and possess the symmetry for optical activity (i.e., are chiral). This is impossible by definition. Therefore, there are no crystal classes that satisfy all the stated conditions.\n\n<<<No such crystal classes exist.>>>"
