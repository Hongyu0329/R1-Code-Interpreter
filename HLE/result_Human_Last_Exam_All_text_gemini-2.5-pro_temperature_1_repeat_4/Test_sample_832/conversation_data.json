    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific number of a particular ballet step, performed by a specific dancer, in a specific role, with a specific company, and in a specific year.\n*   **Ballet & Scene:** *La Bayadère*, Death of Nikiya scene (Act 3).\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova.\n*   **Performance Context:** Her debut in the role with the Bolshoi Ballet.\n*   **Year:** 2009.\n*   **Ballet Step:** *Entrelacé* (also known as *tour jeté entrelacé*).\n*   **Task:** Count the total number of *entrelacés* in her solo variation.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Key Elements\n*   **The Variation:** In the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene, Nikiya is given a basket of flowers (secretly containing a venomous snake). She performs a poignant solo variation with this basket before being bitten. We need to analyze the choreography of this specific solo.\n*   **The Step (*Entrelacé*):** This is a turning leap. The dancer throws one leg into the air, jumps, and turns their body 180 degrees mid-air to land on the first leg, with the other leg sweeping into an arabesque. It is a very dynamic and recognizable step, often performed in a traveling sequence.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Performance Footage\nTo answer the question accurately, one must review the video of Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya.\n1.  The variation begins after she receives the flower basket.\n2.  She performs a series of expressive movements and turns.\n3.  The main allegro (jumping) part of the variation consists of a single diagonal sequence traveling from upstage towards downstage.\n4.  We must carefully identify and count the jumps in this sequence.\n5.  Observing the sequence, Osipova performs a series of powerful, turning leaps that perfectly match the definition of an *entrelacé*.\n6.  Counting each individual jump in this traveling sequence is the final task.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Steps and Conclude\nBy carefully watching the diagonal sequence in Osipova's variation, we can count each *entrelacé* she performs.\n*   She executes the first *entrelacé*.\n*   She immediately follows with a second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth.\n*   The sequence is composed of eight consecutive *entrelacés*.\n*   There are no other *entrelacés* performed elsewhere in this specific variation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of *entrelacés* performed is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
