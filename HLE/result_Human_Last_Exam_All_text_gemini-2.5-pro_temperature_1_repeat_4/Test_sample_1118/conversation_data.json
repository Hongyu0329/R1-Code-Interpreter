    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks about a specific painting: a self-portrait by Curt Querner from 1933. It provides crucial context: the painting was made after Querner's escape/release from the Gestapo. The core of the question is to identify the object he holds in his hand and to understand its meaning as a \"symbol of resistance.\"\n\n**Step 2: Research the artist and the specific artwork.**\nA search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933\" leads to the painting titled \"Self-Portrait with Poppy\" (in German: *Selbstbildnis mit Mohnblume*). This confirms the existence and subject of the artwork.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the historical context.**\n*   **Artist's background:** Curt Querner was a German painter associated with the New Objectivity movement and was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).\n*   **Political climate in 1933:** In January 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor. The Nazi party quickly consolidated power. Following the Reichstag Fire in February, political opponents, especially communists and socialists, were arrested en masse.\n*   **Querner's arrest:** As a known communist, Querner was arrested by the Gestapo in March 1933. He was detained for a short period before being released. The painting was created after this experience.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the object in the painting.**\nIn the self-portrait, Querner looks directly at the viewer with a tense, defiant expression. He is holding a single, vibrant red flower. Based on the painting's title and the flower's appearance, this object is a red poppy.\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the symbolism of the object.**\n*   **Careful Point 1: The color.** The color red is the long-established international symbol of communism, socialism, and the labor movement. By holding a distinctly red flower, Querner is making a political statement.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The context of the arrest.** Having just been arrested by the new Nazi regime for his political beliefs, choosing to include a symbol of those very beliefs in a self-portrait is a powerful act of defiance. It signifies that his spirit and convictions have not been broken by his persecution.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The nature of the symbol.** Using a flower is a subtle, almost coded, form of resistance. It's not an overt political banner, which would have been suicidally dangerous in 1933 Germany. Instead, it's a personal and artistic declaration of his unwavering political identity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy holding a red poppy, Curt Querner used the flower's color to symbolize his continued allegiance to his communist ideals. In the context of his recent arrest by the Gestapo, this act transforms the poppy into a potent and personal symbol of resistance against the Nazi regime.\n\n<<<A red poppy>>>"
