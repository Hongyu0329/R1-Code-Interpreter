An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` is a solution to the system of equations:
1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`
2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`
3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`

Sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are:
1.  The spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are non-empty complete metric spaces.
2.  The operator `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))` is a contraction mapping on the product space `X × Y × Z`. This means there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)`, the inequality `d(T(x1, y1, z1), T(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ k * d((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2))` holds, where `d` is a metric on the product space.
