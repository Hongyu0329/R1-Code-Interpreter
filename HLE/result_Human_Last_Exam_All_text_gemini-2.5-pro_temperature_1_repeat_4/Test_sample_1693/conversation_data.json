    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define Key Parameters**\n\n*   **Timeframe:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This means the relevant period is from the start of the war (September 1, 1939) to June 22, 1940.\n*   **Nationality of Ship:** The ship must be French.\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** The loss must be directly attributed to an attack by a German U-boat. Losses to mines (even if laid by U-boats), surface ships, or aircraft do not count.\n*   **Metric for \"Largest\":** The question specifies \"by displacement\". For merchant ships, this is typically measured in Gross Register Tons (GRT), which is a measure of internal volume and the standard for comparing the \"size\" of such vessels in historical records. For warships, displacement is measured in tonnes of mass. We must consider both types of ships.\n\n**Step 2: Research French Warship Losses in the Specified Period**\n\nWe need to check if any major French warships were sunk by U-boats before the armistice.\n\n*   The French Navy (Marine Nationale) did not lose any capital ships (battleships, aircraft carriers) or cruisers to U-boat action during this period.\n*   The largest French warship sunk in this period was the large destroyer (contre-torpilleur) *Bison*, which had a displacement of around 2,400 tons. However, it was sunk by German dive bombers (Stukas) on May 3, 1940, not by a U-boat.\n*   Other destroyers like *Siroco* were sunk by German E-boats (torpedo boats), not U-boats.\n*   Conclusion: No large French warship fits the criteria. The ship in question must therefore be a merchant vessel.\n\n**Step 3: Research French Merchant Ship Losses to U-boats in the Specified Period**\n\nNow we must identify French merchant ships sunk by U-boats between September 1939 and June 22, 1940, and compare their tonnage.\n\n*   **SS *Champollion***: A passenger liner of 12,546 GRT. Sunk on October 1, 1939, by U-boat *U-3*.\n*   **SS *Bretagne***: A passenger liner of 10,108 GRT. Sunk on October 14, 1939, by U-boat *U-45*.\n*   **SS *Sheherazade***: An oil tanker of **13,467 GRT**. Sunk on February 12, 1940, by U-boat *U-53*.\n*   **SS *Brazza***: A passenger-cargo ship of 10,387 GRT. Sunk on May 28, 1940, by U-boat *U-37*.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Candidates and Identify the Largest Ship**\n\nLet's list the largest candidates found in descending order of size (GRT):\n\n1.  **SS *Sheherazade***: 13,467 GRT\n2.  **SS *Champollion***: 12,546 GRT\n3.  **SS *Brazza***: 10,387 GRT\n4.  **SS *Bretagne***: 10,108 GRT\n\nAll these ships were sunk by U-boats within the specified timeframe. The largest among them, by a significant margin, is the tanker **SS *Sheherazade***.\n\n**Step 5: Final Verification**\n\n*   **Ship:** SS *Sheherazade*\n*   **Nationality:** French\n*   **Size:** 13,467 GRT (the largest identified)\n*   **Sinking Date:** February 12, 1940 (before the June 22, 1940 armistice)\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by torpedoes from the German U-boat *U-53*.\n\nThe facts align perfectly with all conditions of the question.\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker **SS *Sheherazade***.\n\n<<<SS Sheherazade>>>"
