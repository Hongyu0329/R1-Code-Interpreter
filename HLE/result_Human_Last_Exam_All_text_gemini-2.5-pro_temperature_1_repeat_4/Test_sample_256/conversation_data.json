    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The question asks for the symmetry group of the most efficient way to pack 1135 identical, non-overlapping circles inside a larger circle. \"Most efficient\" or \"optimal\" means minimizing the radius of the large container circle. The answer should be expressed in Schoenflies notation, which is a standard notation for describing point group symmetries.\n\n2.  **Nature of the Circle Packing Problem:** The problem of finding the optimal packing of `n` circles is a well-known and computationally very difficult problem in mathematics. For most values of `n`, the optimal solution is not mathematically proven but is known through extensive computer simulations and optimization algorithms. These best-known solutions are considered \"conjecturally optimal.\"\n\n3.  **Consulting a Reference Database:** To find the symmetry of a specific packing, one must refer to a database of known solutions. A widely recognized and comprehensive resource for this problem is the website \"Packomania\" by Eckard Specht, which collects and presents the best-known packings for a large range of `n`.\n\n4.  **Finding the Packing for n = 1135:** We look up the entry for `n = 1135` in the Packomania database.\n    *   The database provides an image of the best-known packing configuration.\n    *   It also lists key data about the packing, including the ratio of the container circle's radius to the small circles' radius, the discoverer of the packing, the date, and importantly, the symmetry group of the arrangement.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Symmetry Group:** According to the data for `n = 1135` on Packomania, the best-known packing was found by G. Kres and V. Pirl in 2011. The site explicitly states the symmetry group for this packing.\n\n6.  **Interpreting the Symmetry Group in Schoenflies Notation:**\n    *   The symmetry group provided for the packing of 1135 circles is **D₁**.\n    *   Let's break down what D₁ means in Schoenflies notation:\n        *   **D groups (Dihedral):** These groups possess an `n`-fold principal rotation axis and `n` two-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis. In 2D, this corresponds to an `n`-fold rotation axis and `n` reflection planes.\n        *   **D₁:** For `n=1`, this means there is a 1-fold rotation axis (which is the identity operation, as a 360° rotation leaves any object unchanged) and one reflection plane.\n        *   Therefore, a D₁ symmetry means the object has a single plane of mirror symmetry and no non-trivial rotational symmetry.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Optimality:** The term \"optimal\" should be treated with caution. The solutions in the database are the \"best-known\" and are very likely optimal, but rigorous mathematical proofs of optimality exist for only a very small number of `n` (e.g., n ≤ 13, and n=19). For `n=1135`, the solution is conjectural.\n*   **Symmetry Determination:** The symmetry group is determined by observing the geometric arrangement of the packed circles. A D₁ symmetry implies that if you draw a line through the center of the packing, the arrangement of circles on one side of the line is a mirror image of the arrangement on the other side.\n*   **Schoenflies Notation:** The question specifically requests the answer in Schoenflies notation. Common point groups in 2D are `Cₙ` (cyclic, `n`-fold rotation only) and `Dₙ` (dihedral, `n`-fold rotation and `n` mirror planes). D₁ fits this system.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the best-known computational results for circle packing, the arrangement of 1135 congruent circles in a circle has a single axis of mirror symmetry and no non-trivial rotational symmetry. This corresponds to the dihedral group D₁.\n\n<<<D₁>>>"
