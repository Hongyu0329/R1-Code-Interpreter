    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe need to find the maximum number of fixed points for the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$. So, we want to find the maximum number of real roots of the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Functions f(x) and g(x)**\n*   $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 3. Let's write them as:\n    $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$\n    $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$\n    where $a, p \\neq 0$.\n*   We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$. This means both functions are strictly increasing for all $x$.\n*   Let's analyze the derivatives:\n    $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$\n    $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$\n*   For these quadratic functions to be positive for all $x$, two conditions must be met for each:\n    1.  The leading coefficient must be positive. This means $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$ and $3p > 0 \\implies p > 0$.\n    2.  The discriminant must be negative.\n        For $f'(x)$: $\\Delta_f = (2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 < 3ac$.\n        For $g'(x)$: $\\Delta_g = (2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r) < 0 \\implies 4q^2 - 12pr < 0 \\implies q^2 < 3pr$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Equation for Fixed Points**\n*   We are solving the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n*   Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We need to find the number of roots of $P(x) = h(x) - x = 0$.\n*   Let's determine the degree of the polynomial $h(x)$.\n    $h(x) = f(g(x)) = a(g(x))^3 + b(g(x))^2 + c(g(x)) + d$.\n    The highest degree term in $g(x)$ is $px^3$.\n    The highest degree term in $h(x)$ is $a(px^3)^3 = ap^3x^9$.\n*   Since $a > 0$ and $p > 0$, the coefficient $ap^3$ is positive and not zero.\n*   Therefore, $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n*   The equation for the fixed points is $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$. Since the degree of $h(x)$ is 9, $P(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\n*   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Our goal is to determine if it is possible to achieve this maximum.\n\n**4. Using Calculus to Determine the Number of Roots**\n*   To determine if $P(x)$ can have 9 real roots, we can use Rolle's Theorem. If a differentiable function has $k$ distinct real roots, its derivative must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n*   If $P(x)$ has 9 real roots, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 real roots.\n*   Let's find $P'(x)$:\n    $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n*   Let $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$. The roots of $P'(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $h'(x) = 1$.\n*   We need to determine the maximum possible number of real roots for the equation $h'(x) = 1$.\n\n**5. Analyzing the Derivative h'(x)**\n*   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $f'(y)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $\\deg(f') \\times \\deg(g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $\\deg(f'(g(x))) + \\deg(g'(x)) = 6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   Since $h'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8, the equation $h'(x) = 1$ can have at most 8 real roots.\n*   This means $P'(x)$ can have at most 8 real roots. By Rolle's Theorem, this implies that $P(x)$ can have at most $8+1=9$ real roots. This confirms our earlier finding from the degree of the polynomial.\n\n**6. Can 9 Roots Be Achieved?**\nThe question now is whether we can construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and for which $f(g(x))=x$ has 9 real roots. This requires showing that it's possible for $P'(x)=0$ (or $h'(x)=1$) to have 8 distinct real roots, and for the values of $P(x)$ at these critical points to allow for 9 roots.\n\n*   **Step 6a: Can $h'(x)=1$ have 8 roots?**\n    For the degree 8 polynomial $h'(x)$ to intersect the line $y=1$ eight times, its graph must have enough \"wiggles\". A degree 8 polynomial can have up to 7 local extrema. This requires its derivative, $h''(x)$, to have 7 distinct real roots.\n*   **Step 6b: Can $h''(x)$ have 7 roots?**\n    Let's compute $h''(x)$:\n    $h''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x)) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n    Let's check the degree of $h''(x)$.\n    -   $f''(y)$ is degree 1. $g(x)$ is degree 3. So $f''(g(x))$ is degree 3.\n    -   $g'(x)$ is degree 2. So $(g'(x))^2$ is degree 4.\n    -   The first term, $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$, has degree $3+4=7$.\n    -   $f'(g(x))$ is degree 6.\n    -   $g''(x)$ is degree 1.\n    -   The second term, $f'(g(x))g''(x)$, has degree $6+1=7$.\n    The leading coefficient of the first term is $ (6a)(p x^3) \\cdot (3px^2)^2 = 54ap^3x^7 $.\n    The leading coefficient of the second term is $ 3a(px^3)^2 \\cdot (6px) = 18ap^3x^7 $.\n    Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, the leading coefficients are both positive. They do not cancel. The leading coefficient of $h''(x)$ is $72ap^3$.\n    So, $h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7. A polynomial of degree 7 can be constructed to have 7 distinct real roots.\n*   **Step 6c: Putting it all together.**\n    1.  It is possible to choose $f$ and $g$ such that $h''(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots.\n    2.  This means $h'(x)$ can have 7 local extrema (specifically, 4 local minima and 3 local maxima, since its leading coefficient is positive).\n    3.  By carefully choosing the parameters of $f$ and $g$, we can make the local minima of $h'(x)$ fall below 1 and the local maxima rise above 1. This ensures that the equation $h'(x)=1$ has 8 distinct real roots.\n    4.  These 8 roots are the critical points of $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. Since $P(x)$ is a degree 9 polynomial with a positive leading coefficient, having 8 critical points means it has 4 local maxima and 4 local minima.\n    5.  To get 9 real roots for $P(x)=0$, the values of the local maxima must be positive, and the values of the local minima must be negative.\n    6.  We can adjust the constant term of $f(x)$ (say, $f_C(x) = f(x)+C$). This changes $P(x)$ to $P(x)+C$. This vertical shift does not change $P'(x)$, so the critical points remain the same. By choosing an appropriate value for $C$, we can shift the graph of $P(x)$ up or down to ensure that all local maxima are positive and all local minima are negative. This is possible if the oscillations of $P(x)$ are large enough, which can also be controlled by the parameters of $f$ and $g$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that there is no structural reason preventing $f(g(x))=x$ from having 9 real roots. The degree of the resulting polynomial is 9, and it is possible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and produce a composite function with enough \"wiggles\" to intersect the line $y=x$ at 9 distinct points. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9."
