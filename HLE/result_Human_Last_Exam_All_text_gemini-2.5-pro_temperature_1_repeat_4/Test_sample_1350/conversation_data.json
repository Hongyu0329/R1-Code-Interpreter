    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Event:** A character visits a Roman city.\n    *   **Action:** This character describes the religious practices of the Romans.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The description is a clear reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf, which would be recognizable to the reader but not necessarily to the character's audience within the story.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify this specific character.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters:**\n    The main characters in *The House of the Wolfings* are primarily Goths from the Wolfing clan. We need to consider which character would have had the opportunity to travel to a Roman city and witness their culture firsthand.\n    *   **Thiodolf:** The War-Duke and leader. His experience with Romans is primarily as a military adversary on the frontier, not as a visitor to their cities.\n    *   **The Wood-Sun:** A supernatural being (a valkyrie or daughter of Odin). Her knowledge is mystical and focused on the fate of Thiodolf, not on the mundane details of Roman civic life.\n    *   **Hall-Sun:** Thiodolf's daughter. She has not traveled outside the lands of the Markmen.\n    *   **Otter:** A thrall (a servant or bondsman) of the Wolfings. His backstory is crucial; he was captured by the Romans and lived as a slave in one of their cities before escaping or being freed and returning to his people.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidates:**\n    Based on the backstories, **Otter** is the only character who fits the description of having lived in a Roman city. His role in the story is often to provide intelligence about the Romans—their military tactics, their society, and their beliefs—based on his direct experience as a captive.\n\n4.  **Locate the Specific Passage/Event:**\n    In Chapter IV, \"The Folk-Mote of the Markmen,\" the Goths gather to discuss the impending war with the Romans. Thiodolf calls upon Otter to share what he knows about the enemy. Otter then delivers a speech describing his time among the Romans.\n\n5.  **Analyze Otter's Description:**\n    During his speech, Otter describes the strength and organization of the Romans. He also speaks of their culture and religion, which he finds strange and alien. He describes a specific image he saw that was clearly important to the Romans:\n    *   He tells the assembly that in the Roman city, he saw a prominent image of **\"a she-wolf giving suck to two man-children.\"**\n    *   He presents this from his own perspective as a strange form of worship, noting the irony that his own people are the \"Wolfings\" but they do not worship wolves in such a way. He interprets it as a sign of the Romans' alien and perhaps unnatural character.\n\n6.  **Connect the Description to the Myth:**\n    The image of a she-wolf nursing two male infants is the central icon of the founding myth of Rome. The two infants are the twins **Romulus and Remus**, who were abandoned and then saved and suckled by a she-wolf (Lupa Capitolina). Any reader with a basic knowledge of Roman history or mythology would immediately recognize this reference. Morris uses this device to show the cultural divide between the Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire, as Otter describes a foundational element of Roman identity as something bizarre and incomprehensible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe character who visited a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that refers to Romulus and Remus is the thrall, Otter.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
