    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Subject:** Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟).\n*   **Event:** His \"first major defeat\". This implies we must distinguish it from minor skirmishes or later defeats.\n*   **Location:** The specific site of this defeat, identified by its name as a *current* Vietnamese province.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mu Sheng's military campaigns in Vietnam**\nMu Sheng was involved in two major periods of conflict in Vietnam:\n1.  **The Ming-Hồ War (1406–1407):** Mu Sheng, along with Zhang Fu, led the Ming invasion that successfully overthrew the Hồ dynasty. This campaign was a swift and decisive victory for the Ming forces. Mu Sheng did not experience any major defeats during this initial invasion.\n2.  **The Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427):** After the Ming established their rule (known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination), the Vietnamese, led by Lê Lợi, launched a rebellion. The Ming sent several expeditionary armies to suppress this uprising, and Mu Sheng was a commander in some of these efforts. His first major defeat occurred during this period.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Mu Sheng's first major defeat**\nWe need to look for specific battles involving Mu Sheng during the Lam Sơn Uprising.\n*   **The 1427 Campaign:** Towards the end of the war, Mu Sheng led a large army from Yunnan to relieve the besieged Ming forces in Đông Quan (Hanoi). However, upon hearing that the other relief army under Liu Sheng had been completely annihilated at Chi Lăng, Mu Sheng lost his nerve and retreated without engaging in a major battle. While a strategic failure, this was a retreat, not a direct battlefield defeat where his army was routed.\n*   **The 1425 Campaign:** In 1424, Lê Lợi's forces had moved out of their mountain bases and were having great success in the region of Nghệ An. In 1425, the Ming court dispatched Mu Sheng from Yunnan with 50,000 troops to attack the Lam Sơn army's base in Nghệ An. Lê Lợi's commanders, including Lê Sát, prepared an ambush. This led to the **Battle of Lãnh Câu - Đan Xá** (also referred to as the Battle of Khả Lưu - Bồ Ải).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Battle of Lãnh Câu - Đan Xá (1425)**\n*   **Outcome:** The Ming army under Mu Sheng was decisively defeated in the ambush. The Vietnamese forces killed and captured thousands of Ming soldiers and seized a large amount of weapons and supplies.\n*   **Significance:** This was a major victory for the Lam Sơn rebels and a clear, significant battlefield defeat for Mu Sheng. It marks his first major personal defeat in Vietnam. He was forced to flee the battlefield and retreat.\n\n**Step 5: Pinpoint the modern location of the battle**\n*   Historical records place the battle sites of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá firmly within the historical territory of Nghệ An.\n*   This historical region corresponds directly to the modern-day **Nghệ An Province** in north-central Vietnam. The battle sites are often associated with the areas of modern Con Cuông and Anh Sơn districts within Nghệ An Province.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat was the Battle of Lãnh Câu - Đan Xá in 1425, which took place in the territory that is now the modern Vietnamese province of Nghệ An.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
