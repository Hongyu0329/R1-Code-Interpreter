    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring attached to an amide group (-CONH2).\n*   **N,N-diethyl:** Two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide, giving a tertiary amide group: -C(=O)N(Et)2.\n*   **3-dimethylamino:** A dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) is attached to the benzene ring at position 3, relative to the amide group at position 1.\n\nThe structure is a benzene ring with a -C(=O)N(Et)2 group at position 1 and a -N(CH3)2 group at position 3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Set of Reagents and Reaction**\n*   **Reagents:** sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium) and TMEDA (Tetramethylethylenediamine) in THF (Tetrahydrofuran).\n*   **Function:** This combination is a very strong base system specifically used for a reaction called **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)**.\n    *   **sec-BuLi** is the strong base that removes a proton (deprotonation).\n    *   **TMEDA** is a chelating agent for the lithium ion (Li+). It breaks up the aggregates of sec-BuLi, making it more reactive, and helps to direct the base to a specific location on the aromatic ring.\n*   **Mechanism:** The reaction involves the deprotonation of the most acidic C-H bond on the aromatic ring. The acidity of these protons is greatly increased by the presence of **Directed Metalating Groups (DMGs)**. A DMG is a substituent that can coordinate with the lithium ion, directing the base to remove a proton from the adjacent (*ortho*) position.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Directed Metalating Groups (DMGs) and the Site of Deprotonation**\nThe starting material has two powerful DMGs:\n1.  **-C(=O)N(Et)2 (N,N-diethylamide group):** This is one of the strongest DMGs. The carbonyl oxygen can chelate the lithium ion, directing deprotonation to its *ortho* positions (C-2 and C-6).\n2.  **-N(Me)2 (dimethylamino group):** This is also a strong DMG. The nitrogen's lone pair can chelate the lithium ion, directing deprotonation to its *ortho* positions (C-2 and C-4).\n\nNow we must determine which proton is removed:\n*   The proton at **C-2** is *ortho* to **both** the amide group and the amino group.\n*   The proton at **C-4** is *ortho* only to the amino group.\n*   The proton at **C-6** is *ortho* only to the amide group.\n\nBecause the position at C-2 is activated by both directing groups, its proton is significantly more acidic than the protons at C-4 and C-6. This is a cooperative or synergistic effect. Therefore, the sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the C-2 position.\n\nThis step forms an aryllithium intermediate: N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. The lithium atom replaces the hydrogen at the C-2 position.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to recognize the cooperative effect of the two DMGs. This synergy makes the C-2 position the unequivocal site of reaction, even though the amide is a slightly stronger director than the amine.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Reagent and Reaction**\n*   **Reagent:** Methyl iodide (CH3I).\n*   **Function:** Methyl iodide is an electrophile. The carbon atom of the methyl group is electron-deficient.\n*   **Mechanism:** The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a strong nucleophile (a carbanion at C-2). This carbanion attacks the electrophilic methyl group of CH3I in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The C-Li bond is replaced by a C-CH3 bond, and iodide (I-) acts as the leaving group.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Product**\nThe overall reaction results in the substitution of the hydrogen atom at C-2 with a methyl group.\n\nThe final product's structure has:\n*   The parent benzamide structure.\n*   N,N-diethyl groups on the amide nitrogen.\n*   A dimethylamino group at C-3.\n*   A new methyl group at C-2.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
