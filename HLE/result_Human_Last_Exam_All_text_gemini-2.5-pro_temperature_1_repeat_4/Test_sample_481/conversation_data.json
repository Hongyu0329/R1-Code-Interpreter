    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the product and manufacturer:** The question specifies \"Teva brand fluoxetine\" capsules.\n2.  **Identify the specific dosages:** The question asks for the 10mg and 20mg dosages.\n3.  **Identify the required information:** The question asks for the \"different numbers\" imprinted on the capsules.\n4.  **Identify the excluded information:** The response must not mention color differences, the word \"PLIVA\", or size differences.\n5.  **Research the 10mg capsule:** Using a reliable pill identifier database, we find that the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number **3105**.\n6.  **Research the 20mg capsule:** Using the same reliable resources, we find that the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number **3109**.\n7.  **Synthesize the final answer:** The different numbers imprinted on the specified capsules are 3105 (for the 10mg strength) and 3109 (for the 20mg strength). The answer should present only these numbers as requested.\n\nCareful points:\n*   Ensure the information is for the correct manufacturer (Teva), as different manufacturers use different imprints for the same drug and dosage. Teva acquired Pliva, which is why the \"PLIVA\" marking is often associated with these products, but the question explicitly forbids mentioning it.\n*   Strictly adhere to the negative constraints by only providing the numbers and excluding any details about color, size, or other text on the capsules.\n*   Verify the imprint codes from a reputable source like the FDA's National Drug Code Directory or a trusted pharmaceutical database to ensure accuracy.\n\n<<<The number on the 10mg capsule is 3105, and the number on the 20mg capsule is 3109.>>>"
