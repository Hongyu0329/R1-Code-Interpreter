    "Answering the question requires a step-by-step analysis involving interpreting the question, connecting it to known combinatorial principles, and performing a calculation based on those principles.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Interpreting the Question**\nThe question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\)\" for n = 35. This phrasing is unusual. A standard interpretation in this context is to find the minimum value of the sum of the number of vertices over all graphs in the family.\nLet the family of bipartite graphs be \\( \\mathcal{B} = \\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k\\} \\). Let \\( V(B_i) \\) and \\( E(B_i) \\) be the vertex and edge sets of graph \\( B_i \\).\nThe condition is that the family covers \\( K_n \\), meaning \\( \\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(B_i) = E(K_n) \\).\nThe quantity to minimize is \\( \\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)| \\).\n\n**Step 2: Relating to Separating Families**\nLet's analyze the covering condition. For each bipartite graph \\( B_i \\), its vertex set \\( V(B_i) \\) can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, \\( X_i \\) and \\( Y_i \\), such that every edge in \\( B_i \\) connects a vertex in \\( X_i \\) to a vertex in \\( Y_i \\).\nFor the family \\( \\mathcal{B} \\) to cover all edges of \\( K_n \\), for any pair of distinct vertices \\( \\{u, v\\} \\) in \\( K_n \\), there must be at least one graph \\( B_i \\) in the family that contains the edge \\( (u, v) \\). This implies that for some \\( i \\), both \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are in \\( V(B_i) \\), and they belong to different partitions. For instance, \\( u \\in X_i \\) and \\( v \\in Y_i \\).\n\nThis leads to the concept of a **separating family** of sets. A family of sets \\( \\mathcal{S} = \\{S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_m\\} \\) is a separating family for a ground set \\( V \\) if for any distinct pair of elements \\( \\{u, v\\} \\subseteq V \\), there is a set \\( S_j \\in \\mathcal{S} \\) such that \\( |S_j \\cap \\{u, v\\}| = 1 \\) (i.e., \\( S_j \\) contains exactly one of \\( u \\) or \\( v \\)).\n\nIf we have a covering family of bipartite graphs \\( \\{B_i\\} \\), with partitions \\( (X_i, Y_i) \\), the collection of all partitions \\( \\mathcal{S} = \\{X_1, Y_1, X_2, Y_2, \\dots\\} \\) forms a separating family. The total number of vertices in the family of graphs, \\( \\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)| = \\sum_{i=1}^k (|X_i| + |Y_i|) \\), is the sum of the sizes of the sets in this separating family \\( \\mathcal{S} \\).\n\nA known result in extremal combinatorics (due to F. R. K. Chung) states that the minimum sum of vertices for a bipartite covering of \\( K_n \\) is equal to the minimum sum of sizes of a separating family for an n-element set. Let's denote this minimum sum by \\( s(n) \\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculating \\( s(n) \\)**\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the value of \\( s(n) \\) for \\( n=35 \\).\nWe can construct a separating family using binary codes. We assign a unique binary vector (a \"code\") to each of the \\( n \\) vertices. Let the length of these vectors be \\( k \\). To ensure each vertex gets a unique code, we need \\( 2^k \\ge n \\). To be efficient, we choose the smallest possible \\( k \\), so \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\).\n\nFor each position \\( j \\) from 1 to \\( k \\), we define a set \\( S_j \\) to be the set of all vertices whose binary code has a '1' in the \\( j \\)-th position. The family \\( \\{S_1, \\dots, S_k\\} \\) is a separating family because if two vertices have different codes, their codes must differ in at least one position.\n\nThe sum of the sizes of these sets is \\( \\sum_{j=1}^k |S_j| \\). This is exactly the total number of '1's in all the binary codes assigned to the \\( n \\) vertices. To minimize this sum, we must choose the \\( n \\) unique binary vectors that have the minimum possible total number of '1's (i.e., minimum total Hamming weight). This is achieved by selecting the binary vectors with the lowest Hamming weights first.\n\n**Step 4: Calculation for n = 35**\n1.  **Determine code length (k):**\n    For \\( n = 35 \\), we need \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\).\n    Since \\( 2^5 = 32 < 35 \\) and \\( 2^6 = 64 > 35 \\), the minimum code length is \\( k = 6 \\).\n\n2.  **Select 35 vectors with minimum total weight:**\n    We need to choose 35 distinct binary vectors of length 6. We do this by picking all vectors of weight 0, then all of weight 1, and so on, until we have 35 vectors.\n\n    *   **Weight 0:** There is \\( \\binom{6}{0} = 1 \\) vector (`000000`).\n        *   Vectors chosen: 1.\n        *   Sum of weights for this group: \\( 1 \\times 0 = 0 \\).\n\n    *   **Weight 1:** There are \\( \\binom{6}{1} = 6 \\) vectors (e.g., `100000`, `010000`, etc.).\n        *   Vectors chosen so far: \\( 1 + 6 = 7 \\).\n        *   Sum of weights for this group: \\( 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\).\n\n    *   **Weight 2:** There are \\( \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15 \\) vectors (e.g., `110000`, etc.).\n        *   Vectors chosen so far: \\( 7 + 15 = 22 \\).\n        *   Sum of weights for this group: \\( 15 \\times 2 = 30 \\).\n\n    *   **Weight 3:** There are \\( \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{6} = 20 \\) vectors.\n        *   We need to choose \\( 35 - 22 = 13 \\) more vectors. We take 13 vectors from this group.\n        *   Sum of weights for this group: \\( 13 \\times 3 = 39 \\).\n\n3.  **Calculate the total sum of weights:**\n    The minimum total sum of weights, \\( s(35) \\), is the sum of the weights from each group selected.\n    Total sum = (weight 0 group) + (weight 1 group) + (weight 2 group) + (weight 3 group)\n    Total sum = \\( 0 + 6 + 30 + 39 = 75 \\).\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\) is 75.\n\n<<<75>>>"
