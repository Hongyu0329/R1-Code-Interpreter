    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the components of the question\n\nThe question asks for the determinant of a matrix described as the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". It also provides a matrix \\( A \\). Let's break down each piece of information.\n\n1.  **The Matrix A**:\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    This is a well-known matrix in mathematics. It is the Cartan matrix for the affine Lie algebra of type \\( \\tilde{A}_2 \\). The Dynkin diagram for \\( \\tilde{A}_2 \\) is a cycle of 3 vertices (a triangle). This matrix is not an adjacency matrix in the standard graph theory sense, as adjacency matrices have non-negative entries representing the number of edges. However, it is related to the adjacency matrix of the underlying graph (a 3-cycle, \\(C_3\\)) `a` by the formula \\(A = 2I - a\\), where `a` is the adjacency matrix of the complete graph K3.\n    A key property of `A` is that its determinant is 0.\n    `det(A) = 2(4-1) - (-1)(-2-1) + (-1)(1-2) = 2(3) + (-3) -(-1) = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0`.\n    The role of `A` in the problem is likely to identify the type of quiver we are dealing with, which is the one associated with the \\( \\tilde{A}_2 \\) Dynkin diagram.\n\n2.  **The Markov Quiver**:\n    A quiver is a directed graph. The \"Markov quiver\" is the quiver whose representation theory is related to the Markov equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\). This quiver is known to be of type \\( \\tilde{A}_2 \\), which means it is an orientation of the 3-cycle graph. The most common choice is a directed cycle on 3 vertices, for example, \\(1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1\\).\n\n3.  **Adjacency Matrix of the Markov Quiver**:\n    For a directed graph (quiver) with vertices \\(V=\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\), the adjacency matrix `M` is a 3x3 matrix where the entry \\(M_{ij}\\) is the number of arrows from vertex `i` to vertex `j`. For the cyclic quiver \\(1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1\\), the adjacency matrix is:\n    \\[\n    M = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n    1 & 0 & 0\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The determinant of this matrix is `det(M) = 1`.\n\n4.  **The value \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)**:\n    This piece of information connects the problem to a specific instance related to the Markov numbers. The Markov numbers are integers that are part of integer solutions (Markov triples) to the Markov equation. The first few Markov numbers are 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, ...\n    The number 13 is indeed a Markov number. It belongs to the Markov triple (1, 5, 13), because \\(1^2 + 5^2 + 13^2 = 1 + 25 + 169 = 195\\) and \\(3 \\times 1 \\times 5 \\times 13 = 195\\).\n    The notation \\(m_{1/2}\\) is obscure, but the value `13` points strongly towards using the properties of the associated triple (1, 5, 13).\n\n### Step 2: List careful points and potential interpretations\n\n*   **Is the answer simply det(A)?** This would mean \"adjacency matrix...\" is a misnomer for A. This is unlikely as it ignores the specific information \\(m=13\\). The answer would be 0.\n*   **Is the answer simply det(M)?** This would be the determinant of the unweighted adjacency matrix of the quiver. This interpretation uses the term \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver\" correctly, and uses A to identify the quiver type. However, it ignores \\(m=13\\). The answer would be 1.\n*   **A combined interpretation**: A well-posed problem in a competition usually requires using all the specific numerical data provided. This suggests we need to construct a matrix that depends on the value 13 (and its associated triple) and the quiver structure. This leads to the idea of a **weighted adjacency matrix**.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the final answer with step-by-step analysis\n\nLet's follow the most plausible interpretation that combines all the given information.\n\n1.  The matrix `A` tells us the quiver is a 3-cycle. Let the vertices be \\(v_1, v_2, v_3\\). Let the orientation be \\(v_1 \\to v_2 \\to v_3 \\to v_1\\).\n2.  The value \\(m=13\\) tells us to consider the associated Markov triple, which is (1, 5, 13). Let's associate these numbers as weights to the vertices, for instance, `weight(v_1) = 1`, `weight(v_2) = 5`, `weight(v_3) = 13`.\n3.  We now define the \"adjacency matrix for \\(m=13\\)\" as the weighted adjacency matrix of the quiver. The entry \\(W_{ij}\\) is the weight of the arrow from vertex `i` to `j`. If there is no arrow, the weight is 0. A reasonable definition for the arrow's weight is the weight of the vertex it points to.\n    *   Weight of arrow \\(v_1 \\to v_2\\) is `weight(v_2) = 5`.\n    *   Weight of arrow \\(v_2 \\to v_3\\) is `weight(v_3) = 13`.\n    *   Weight of arrow \\(v_3 \\to v_1\\) is `weight(v_1) = 1`.\n4.  This gives the following weighted adjacency matrix `W`:\n    \\[\n    W = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 5 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 13 \\\\\n    1 & 0 & 0\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n5.  Now, we compute the determinant of this matrix `W`:\n    \\[\n    \\det(W) = 0 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 13 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - 5 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 13 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + 0 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\det(W) = -5(0 \\cdot 0 - 13 \\cdot 1) = -5(-13) = 65\n    \\]\n    Alternatively, using the Leibniz formula for a 3x3 matrix:\n    `det(W) = (0*0*0) + (5*13*1) + (0*0*0) - (1*0*0) - (0*13*0) - (0*0*5) = 65`.\n\n6.  **Robustness Check**:\n    *   What if we assign the weights differently, e.g., `weight(v_1)=5`, `weight(v_2)=1`, `weight(v_3)=13`? The matrix becomes \\(\\begin{bsmallmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 13 \\\\ 5 & 0 & 0 \\end{bsmallmatrix}\\). The determinant is \\(1 \\times 13 \\times 5 = 65\\).\n    *   What if the weight of an arrow is defined by its source vertex? The matrix becomes \\(\\begin{bsmallmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 5 \\\\ 13 & 0 & 0 \\end{bsmallmatrix}\\). The determinant is \\(1 \\times 5 \\times 13 = 65\\).\n    The result is robustly the product of the numbers in the Markov triple: \\(1 \\times 5 \\times 13 = 65\\).\n\nThis interpretation provides a non-trivial answer and uses all the information given in the problem statement in a coherent manner.\n\n<<<65>>>"
