    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Coordinate System and the First Cube\nTo analyze the problem, we first establish a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, with one corner at the origin (0, 0, 0) and its sides aligned with the coordinate axes. Since the side length is 1, Cube A occupies the region defined by the following inequalities:\n*   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the \"Main Diagonal\" and the \"Shift\"\nThe \"main diagonal\" of a cube connects two opposite vertices. For Cube A in our chosen coordinate system, the main diagonal connects the vertex at `(0, 0, 0)` to the vertex at `(1, 1, 1)`. The vector representing this diagonal is `<1, 1, 1>`.\n\nThe problem states that the second cube, Cube B, is shifted by a distance of 1/2 \"along the main diagonal\" relative to the first. This phrasing can be interpreted in a couple of ways.\n*   **Interpretation A:** The magnitude of the shift vector is 1/2.\n*   **Interpretation B:** The shift consists of a displacement of 1/2 along each of the axes that make up the diagonal direction (x, y, and z).\n\nFor geometry problems of this type, Interpretation B is the standard and intended one. It implies the shift vector is `<1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`. This keeps the resulting cube aligned with the coordinate axes and leads to a clean, logical solution. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n**Careful Point:** If we used Interpretation A, the shift vector would be `<1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)>`, which would lead to a far more complex calculation and an irrational answer, which is unlikely for this type of problem.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Second Cube\nCube B is identical to Cube A but shifted by the vector `<1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`. To find the region occupied by Cube B, we add 1/2 to the coordinate ranges of Cube A:\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Region of Intersection\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region in space that satisfies the inequalities for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We find this by finding the intersection of the coordinate ranges for each axis.\n\n*   **For the x-axis:** The region must satisfy `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` (from Cube A) AND `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2` (from Cube B). The common interval is `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n*   **For the y-axis:** The region must satisfy `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` (from Cube A) AND `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2` (from Cube B). The common interval is `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\n*   **For the z-axis:** The region must satisfy `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` (from Cube A) AND `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2` (from Cube B). The common interval is `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection\nThe intersection is a solid defined by `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`. This is the geometric definition of a cube.\n\nTo find the volume of this intersection cube, we first find its side length. The length of each side is the length of the interval for each coordinate:\n*   Side length = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n\nThe volume of a cube is its side length cubed.\n*   Volume = (Side Length)³ = `(1/2)³` = `1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2` = `1/8`.\n\nThe volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
