    "Answering the question requires finding the maximum possible density $c$ for a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ such that the sumset $A+A$ contains no perfect squares.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understanding the problem**\nLet $A$ be a subset of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}$. We are given the condition that for any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ (possibly $a_1=a_2$), their sum $a_1+a_2$ is not a perfect square. Let $S = \\{k^2 \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ be the set of perfect squares. The condition is $(A+A) \\cap S = \\emptyset$. We want to find the largest constant $c$ such that there exists such a set $A$ with size $|A| = (c+o(1))N$. This constant $c$ represents the maximal asymptotic density of such a set.\n\n**2. Finding a lower bound for c (Construction)**\nA powerful method for constructing such sets is to use modular arithmetic. We try to find a modulus $m$ and a set of residues $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\ldots, m-1\\}$ such that if we take $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in R\\}$, the condition is satisfied.\n\nLet's choose the modulus $m=3$. The squares modulo 3 are:\n$0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$\n$1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n$2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\nSo, the set of residues of squares modulo 3 is $S_3 = \\{0, 1\\}$. Notice that 2 is not a residue of a square modulo 3.\n\nNow, let's construct a set $A$ such that all sums $a_1+a_2$ are congruent to 2 modulo 3. This would guarantee that no sum is a square.\nLet's choose the residue set $R=\\{1\\} \\subseteq \\{0,1,2\\}$.\nIf we define $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$, then for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nTheir sum is $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1 = 2 \\pmod 3$.\nSince no square is congruent to 2 modulo 3, $a_1+a_2$ cannot be a square.\nThe size of this set $A$ is approximately $N/3$. More formally, $|A| = \\lfloor (N-1)/3 \\rfloor + 1 = N/3 + O(1)$.\nThe density is $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N} = 1/3$.\nThis construction shows that we can achieve a density of $1/3$, so we must have $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nOther choices of modulus (like $m=4, 5, 8, 9, 16$) do not yield a better density with this method. For example, for $m=9$, we can choose $R=\\{1,4,7\\}$. Then $R+R \\pmod 9 = \\{2,5,8\\}$. The squares mod 9 are $S_9=\\{0,1,4,7\\}$. Since $(R+R)\\cap S_9=\\emptyset$, this works. The density is $|R|/m = 3/9 = 1/3$. This is essentially the same construction, as $R = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_9 \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\n\n**3. Finding an upper bound for c (Proof sketch)**\nTo show that $c \\le 1/3$, we need a more advanced argument, relying on results from additive combinatorics (specifically, Sárközy-type theorems).\n\nLet $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ be a set such that $A+A$ contains no squares, with $|A| = cN$. We partition $A$ based on the residues modulo 3:\n$A_0 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\\}$\n$A_1 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$\n$A_2 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$\nLet their respective densities be $\\alpha_0 = |A_0|/N$, $\\alpha_1 = |A_1|/N$, and $\\alpha_2 = |A_2|/N$. We have $c = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2$.\n\nNow we analyze the sumsets generated by these partitions:\n*   $A_1 + A_1$: Any sum is $\\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 3$. Since no square is $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, this sumset is automatically square-free. This provides no constraint on the size of $A_1$.\n*   $A_2 + A_2$: Any sum is $\\equiv 2+2=4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Since squares can be $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ (e.g., $1^2, 2^2, 4^2, \\dots$), this condition is not empty. A theorem by Sárközy (and its extensions) states that if a set $B \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, M\\}$ has the property that $B+B$ contains no squares, then $|B|=o(M)$. Applying this to $A_2$, we must have $|A_2|=o(N)$, which implies the density $\\alpha_2 = o(1)$.\n*   $A_0 + A_0$: Any sum is $\\equiv 0+0=0 \\pmod 3$. For a sum $a_1+a_2$ to be a square $k^2$, $k^2$ must be divisible by 3, which means $k$ must be divisible by 3, so $k^2$ must be divisible by 9. Let $a_1=3k_1, a_2=3k_2$. Then $3(k_1+k_2)=k^2$, so $k_1+k_2$ must be of the form $3m^2$. Let $A'_0 = \\{a/3 \\mid a \\in A_0\\}$. Then $A'_0+A'_0$ must not contain any number of the form $3m^2$. This is a Sárközy-type problem on a sparse set of squares, which also implies that $|A'_0|=o(N)$, and thus $|A_0|=o(N)$. So, the density $\\alpha_0 = o(1)$.\n*   Sums between different sets: For instance, $A_0+A_2$ gives sums $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, which is fine. However, $A_0+A_1$ gives sums $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, and $A_1+A_2$ gives sums $\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. These conditions also give strong constraints, typically of the form $|A_i||A_j|=o(N^2)$, which are consistent with $\\alpha_0=o(1)$ and $\\alpha_2=o(1)$.\n\nFrom the analysis, we conclude that for the density $c$ to be positive, it must come primarily from $\\alpha_1$.\nWe have $c = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 = o(1) + \\alpha_1 + o(1) = \\alpha_1 + o(1)$.\nThe set $A_1$ is a subset of all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ congruent to 1 modulo 3. The size of this ambient set is $N/3+O(1)$. Therefore, $|A_1| \\le N/3 + O(1)$, which implies $\\alpha_1 \\le 1/3$.\nCombining these, we get $c \\le 1/3 + o(1)$.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe lower bound construction shows $c \\ge 1/3$. The upper bound argument shows $c \\le 1/3$. Therefore, the largest possible value for $c$ is exactly $1/3$."
