    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are looking for the minimum number of points on a 2-torus ($T^2$) where the gradient of any smooth real-valued function $f$ vanishes. The 2-torus is a compact surface, like the shape of a donut.\n\n**Step 2: Basic Existence of Critical Points**\nThe 2-torus $T^2$ is a compact space. By the Extreme Value Theorem, any continuous function on a compact space must attain a global maximum and a global minimum. Since our function $f$ is smooth (and therefore continuous), it must have at least one global maximum and one global minimum. These points are necessarily critical points. This guarantees a minimum of 2 critical points. However, we can find a more precise lower bound using topology.\n\n**Step 3: Applying Morse Theory for a Lower Bound**\nMorse theory provides a powerful connection between the number of critical points of a function on a manifold and the topology of the manifold itself.\n\n*   **Morse Functions:** For a special class of \"nice\" functions called Morse functions, all critical points are non-degenerate. Any smooth function can be slightly perturbed to become a Morse function, so the minimum number of critical points for a smooth function is the same as the minimum for a Morse function.\n*   **Betti Numbers:** The topology of a manifold is captured by its Betti numbers, $b_k$, which count the number of \"k-dimensional holes\". For the 2-torus $T^2$:\n    *   $b_0 = 1$ (it has one connected component).\n    *   $b_1 = 2$ (it has two independent loops: one \"around the hole\" and one \"through the hole\").\n    *   $b_2 = 1$ (it encloses one volume).\n*   **Morse Inequalities:** A fundamental result of Morse theory is that for any Morse function $f$ on a manifold $M$, the number of critical points of index $k$ (denoted $c_k$) must be at least the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k$.\n    *   Index 0 corresponds to local minima.\n    *   Index 1 corresponds to saddle points.\n    *   Index 2 corresponds to local maxima.\n*   **Applying to the Torus:**\n    *   Number of minima: $c_0 \\ge b_0 = 1$.\n    *   Number of saddles: $c_1 \\ge b_1 = 2$.\n    *   Number of maxima: $c_2 \\ge b_2 = 1$.\n*   **Calculating the Lower Bound:** The total number of critical points is $N = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. Based on the inequalities, the minimum possible number is:\n    $N \\ge 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\nThis establishes that any smooth function on the torus must have at least 4 critical points. A stronger version of this result, known as the Morse-Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem, confirms that the number of critical points for *any* smooth function (not just Morse functions) is at least the sum of the Betti numbers, which is $1+2+1=4$.\n\n**Step 4: Constructing an Example to Show the Bound is Achievable**\nTo prove that 4 is indeed the minimum, we need to find an example of a smooth function on the torus that has exactly 4 critical points.\n\n*   **Model of the Torus:** We can think of the torus as a square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$ with opposite sides identified. A function on this space must be periodic in both variables.\n*   **Example Function:** Consider the function $f(x,y) = \\cos(2\\pi x) + \\cos(2\\pi y)$. This function is smooth and periodic, so it is well-defined on the torus.\n*   **Finding Critical Points:** We set its partial derivatives to zero:\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x) = 0 \\implies x = 0$ or $x = 1/2$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi y) = 0 \\implies y = 0$ or $y = 1/2$.\n*   **Identifying the Points:** Within the square $[0,1) \\times [0,1)$, this gives us exactly four distinct critical points:\n    1.  $(0,0)$\n    2.  $(0, 1/2)$\n    3.  $(1/2, 0)$\n    4.  $(1/2, 1/2)$\n*   **Classifying the Points:** We can analyze the Hessian matrix of second derivatives to classify these points:\n    1.  At $(0,0)$: $f(0,0)=2$. This is a local maximum (index 2).\n    2.  At $(0, 1/2)$: $f(0, 1/2)=0$. This is a saddle point (index 1).\n    3.  At $(1/2, 0)$: $f(1/2, 0)=0$. This is also a saddle point (index 1).\n    4.  At $(1/2, 1/2)$: $f(1/2, 1/2)=-2$. This is a local minimum (index 0).\n\nThis function has exactly one minimum, two saddles, and one maximum, for a total of 4 critical points.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nWe have shown from Morse theory that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points. We have also constructed a specific function that has exactly 4 critical points. Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
