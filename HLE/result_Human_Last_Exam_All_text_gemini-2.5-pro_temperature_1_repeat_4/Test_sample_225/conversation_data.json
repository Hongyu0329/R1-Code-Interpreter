    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Curve**\nThe curve is a Lissajous curve. The period of x(t) = cos(9t) is T_x = 2π/9. The period of y(t) = sin(5t) is T_y = 2π/5. The curve completes its full path when t ranges over the least common multiple of the periods, which is LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π. We will analyze the self-intersections for t in the interval [0, 2π).\n\n**Step 2: Condition for Self-Intersection**\nA self-intersection occurs at a point (x, y) if the curve passes through this point at two different times, t1 and t2.\nx(t1) = x(t2)  => cos(9t1) = cos(9t2)\ny(t1) = y(t2)  => sin(5t1) = sin(5t2)\nwhere t1 ≠ t2 and t1, t2 ∈ [0, 2π).\n\nThe self-intersection points can be categorized into three types:\n1.  Intersections in the open quadrants (not on the x or y axes).\n2.  Intersections on the x-axis (where y = 0).\n3.  Intersections on the y-axis (where x = 0).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Non-Axial Intersections**\nFor Lissajous curves of the form x = cos(at), y = sin(bt) where a and b are coprime integers, there is a known formula for the number of self-intersections that do not lie on the coordinate axes.\nThe formula depends on the parity of a and b. Here, a = 9 and b = 5. Since both are odd, the formula is:\nNumber of non-axial intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\nN_non-axial = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2 = (8)(4) / 2 = 16.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Intersections on the x-axis**\nFor a point to be on the x-axis, y(t) = 0.\nsin(5t) = 0 => 5t = kπ => t = kπ/5 for some integer k.\nSince t ∈ [0, 2π), k can be {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n\nFor a self-intersection, we need two different times t1 = k1π/5 and t2 = k2π/5 (with k1 ≠ k2) such that x(t1) = x(t2).\ncos(9 * k1π/5) = cos(9 * k2π/5)\nThis equality holds if 9k1π/5 = ± 9k2π/5 + 2mπ for some integer m.\n9k1 = ±9k2 + 10m => 9(k1 ∓ k2) = 10m.\nSince 9 and 10 are coprime, (k1 ∓ k2) must be a multiple of 10.\n-   Case k1 - k2 = 10j: Since k1, k2 ∈ {0, ..., 9}, the maximum difference is 9. So j must be 0, which means k1 = k2. This doesn't give a self-intersection.\n-   Case k1 + k2 = 10j: Since k1, k2 ∈ {0, ..., 9} and k1 ≠ k2, the sum 1 ≤ k1 + k2 ≤ 17. So the only possibility is k1 + k2 = 10.\n\nThe pairs {k1, k2} that sum to 10 are: {1, 9}, {2, 8}, {3, 7}, {4, 6}.\nEach pair corresponds to one self-intersection point on the x-axis. The x-coordinates are:\n-   cos(9π/5)\n-   cos(18π/5) = cos(8π/5)\n-   cos(27π/5) = cos(7π/5)\n-   cos(36π/5) = cos(6π/5)\nThese four cosine values are distinct. Thus, there are 4 self-intersection points on the x-axis.\nN_x-axial = 4.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Intersections on the y-axis**\nFor a point to be on the y-axis, x(t) = 0.\ncos(9t) = 0 => 9t = (2k + 1)π/2 => t = (2k + 1)π/18 for some integer k.\nSince t ∈ [0, 2π), (2k + 1)π/18 < 2π => 2k + 1 < 36 => k < 17.5. So k can be {0, 1, ..., 17}.\n\nFor a self-intersection, we need t1 = (2k1 + 1)π/18 and t2 = (2k2 + 1)π/18 (with k1 ≠ k2) such that y(t1) = y(t2).\nsin(5t1) = sin(5t2)\nThis equality holds if 5t1 = 5t2 + 2mπ (which implies k1=k2) or 5t1 = π - 5t2 + 2mπ.\n5(t1 + t2) = (2m + 1)π\n5 * [ (2k1 + 1)π/18 + (2k2 + 1)π/18 ] = (2m + 1)π\n5 * (2k1 + 2k2 + 2) / 18 = 2m + 1\n5 * (k1 + k2 + 1) / 9 = 2m + 1\nSince the right side is an integer, 9 must divide 5(k1 + k2 + 1). As 5 and 9 are coprime, (k1 + k2 + 1) must be a multiple of 9.\nPossible values for k1+k2+1, since k1,k2 ∈ {0,...,17}:\n-   k1 + k2 + 1 = 9  => k1 + k2 = 8.  Pairs: {0,8}, {1,7}, {2,6}, {3,5}. (4 pairs)\n-   k1 + k2 + 1 = 18 => k1 + k2 = 17. Pairs: {0,17}, {1,16}, ..., {8,9}. (9 pairs)\n-   k1 + k2 + 1 = 27 => k1 + k2 = 26. Pairs: {9,17}, {10,16}, {11,15}, {12,14}. (4 pairs)\n\nNow we count the number of unique intersection points generated by these pairs. A point is defined by its y-coordinate, y_k = sin(5(2k+1)π/18). Two pairs {k1,k2} and {k3,k4} generate the same point if y_k1 = y_k3. Two y-values y_k and y_k' are equal if k+k'+1 is a multiple of 9.\nLet's find the set of unique y-values generated by all these pairs.\n-   The pairs from k1+k2=8 generate the y-values {y₀, y₁, y₂, y₃}. These are 4 distinct values.\n-   The pairs from k1+k2=17 generate the y-values {y₀, y₁, y₂, y₃, y₄, y₅, y₆, y₇, y₈}. Because yₖ = y₁₇-ₖ (e.g., y₀=y₁₇, y₁=y₁₆), and k+k'=17 gives pairs {k, 17-k}, the value from y(k) and y(17-k) are the same. But the pairs for intersection are from k1+k2=17. Let's check the unique values generated.\n    The unique values from this set are {y₀, y₁, y₂, y₃, y₄}, since y₅=y₁₂ and 5+12=17 gives an intersection pair. No, yₖ=yₖ' if k+k'=8 or k+k'=17-1=16 wrong.. if k+k'+1=9j.\n    From k1+k2=17, we have k-values {0..8}. The unique y-values correspond to k values {0,1,2,3,4} because yₖ = y₈-ₖ (e.g., y₀=y₈). This gives 5 distinct points.\n-   The pairs from k1+k2=26 give k-values {9,10,11,12}. These produce 4 new distinct y-values.\n\nWe check for overlaps between the sets of y-values.\nSet 1 (from k1+k2=8): {y₀, y₁, y₂, y₃}.\nSet 2 (from k1+k2=17): {y₀, y₁, y₂, y₃, y₄}.\nSet 3 (from k1+k2=26): {y₉, y₁₀, y₁₁, y₁₂}.\nThe union of Set 1 and Set 2 is Set 2. We check if Set 2 and Set 3 overlap. This requires yₖ = yₖ' for k∈{0..4} and k'∈{9..12}. This needs k+k'+1=9j. The minimum sum is 0+9+1=10, max is 4+12+1=17. No multiple of 9 exists. So the sets are disjoint.\nThe total number of distinct points is |Set 2| + |Set 3| = 5 + 4 = 9.\nN_y-axial = 9.\n\n**Step 6: Total Number of Self-Intersections**\nThe total number of self-intersection points is the sum of the numbers from each category.\nTotal = N_non-axial + N_x-axial + N_y-axial\nTotal = 16 + 4 + 9 = 29.\n\n<<<29>>>"
