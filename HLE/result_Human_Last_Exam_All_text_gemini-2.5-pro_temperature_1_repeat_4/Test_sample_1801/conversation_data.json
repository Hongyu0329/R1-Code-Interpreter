    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks for two specific individuals who meet the following criteria:\n1.  They are Nobel laureates.\n2.  They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n3.  This commercial was from the year 2000.\n4.  The commercial's campaign had the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Research the Enron \"Ask Why\" campaign**\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major public relations effort by Enron in 2000 and 2001. Its goal was to rebrand Enron from just an energy company to an innovative, world-changing corporation dealing in complex markets like bandwidth and weather derivatives. The commercials featured various thinkers and notable figures posing questions about the future.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the featured individuals who were also Nobel laureates**\nResearching the participants of the \"Ask Why\" campaign reveals that several well-known figures were involved. Specifically looking for Nobel Prize winners leads to two prominent economists.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identities and Nobel status of the individuals**\n*   **Individual 1: Paul Krugman.** He is a renowned economist and columnist. He appeared in one of the \"Ask Why\" commercials.\n    *   *Careful point:* Paul Krugman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008. At the time of the commercial in 2000, he was not yet a Nobel laureate. However, the question asks which two \"Nobel laureates *were* featured,\" which can be interpreted as asking for people who are now laureates and were featured in the past. He fits this description.\n*   **Individual 2: Myron Scholes.** He is an economist famous for the Black-Scholes model for pricing options. He also appeared in an \"Ask Why\" commercial.\n    *   *Careful point:* Myron Scholes won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997. Therefore, he was already a Nobel laureate when he appeared in the commercial in 2000. He also fits the description perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings**\nThe two individuals who are now Nobel laureates and were featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" ad campaign are Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes. Their participation is often cited ironically, given Enron's massive fraudulent collapse just a year or two after the campaign aired.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
