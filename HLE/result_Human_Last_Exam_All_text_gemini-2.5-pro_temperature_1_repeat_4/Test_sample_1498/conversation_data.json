    "Of course. Let's break down the question and find the answer methodically.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Poem and the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the specific range of verses (abyāt, singular: bayt) in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the names of the prophets are listed. *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* (The Creed of the Laymen) is a famous and concise poem by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi that outlines the essential tenets of Islamic belief according to the Ash'ari school of theology. It is structured to be easily memorized and covers topics like the attributes of Allah, the prophets, the revealed books, angels, and the Last Day.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Section on Prophethood (Nubuwwat)**\n\nThe poem follows a logical order. After discussing the necessary, impossible, and possible attributes of Allah, it transitions to the topic of the prophets. This section begins around bayt 24. However, the question is not about the entire section on prophets, but specifically about the verses that *enumerate their names*.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Starting Verse of the Enumeration**\n\nBefore listing the names, the author mentions their total number. In bayt 27, he says:\n\n> تَفْصِيلُهُمْ خَمْسَةٌ مِنْ بَعْدِ عَشْرٍ يَبْقَى ... وَهُمْ رُسُلٌ فَاحْفَظْ لِتَفُزْ بِالرَّشَادِ\n> \"Their detailed number is twenty-five; they are messengers, so preserve this knowledge to attain guidance.\"\n\nThis verse sets the stage but does not start the list. The actual enumeration of the names begins in the verse immediately following the setup. The verse that starts the list of names is **bayt 29**:\n\n> هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ ... صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n> \"They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with Salih and Ibrahim; each is to be followed.\"\n\nThis is the clear starting point of the list.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Concluding Verse of the Enumeration**\n\nWe now need to follow the list of names until it ends. The list continues through the subsequent verses:\n\n*   **Bayt 30:** Mentions Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n*   **Bayt 31:** Mentions Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\nThe list of the 25 prophets concludes in the next verse, which is **bayt 32**:\n\n> إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ... عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n> \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the final one; leave deviance.\"\n\nThis verse contains the last of the names. The following verse (bayt 33) is a prayer for all of them and marks the end of this specific topic, but it does not contain any new names.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Range**\n\nBased on the analysis, the list of the prophets' names begins at **bayt 29** and concludes at **bayt 32**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Verse Numbering:** While the numbering of verses in classical poems can sometimes vary slightly between different manuscripts or printed editions, the range of 29-32 is the standard and most widely accepted numbering for this section in *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam*.\n2.  **Scope of the Question:** The analysis strictly addresses the verses containing the *names* of the prophets, not the verses that discuss the concept of prophethood in general (which begin earlier, around bayt 24).\n3.  **Content of the Verses:** The four verses (29, 30, 31, 32) systematically list the 25 prophets who are generally mentioned by name within the Islamic tradition as derived from the Qur'an.\n4.  **Final Prophet:** The poem refers to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) with the name \"Taha\" (طه), which is one of his appellations derived from the opening letters of Surah Taha in the Qur'an.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n*   **Start of list:** Bayt 29 begins with \"Adam, Idris, Nuh...\"\n*   **End of list:** Bayt 32 ends with \"'Isa and Taha (Muhammad)...\"\n*   **Therefore, the range is from bayt 29 to bayt 32.**\n\n<<<From bayt 29 to bayt 32.>>>"
