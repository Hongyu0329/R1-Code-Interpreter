    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth in 2002.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the candidates**\nThe noble gases are a group of chemical elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n(Note: Oganesson (Og) is also a noble gas, but it is a synthetic element first created in a lab in 2006, so it was not present on Earth in 2002 and does not occur naturally.)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the basis for rarity**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we need to consider the total amount of each gas present on the entire planet (in the atmosphere, crust, mantle, and core) at a given point in time. The year 2002 is specified, but the relative abundances of these natural elements do not change on such short timescales, so data from around that period is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the abundance of the stable noble gases**\nFor the non-radioactive (or very long-lived) noble gases, their primary reservoir on Earth is the atmosphere. Their approximate concentrations in the atmosphere by volume are:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** ~0.934% (or 9,340 parts per million, ppm). It is the third most abundant gas in our atmosphere. Clearly not the rarest.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.2 ppm\n*   **Helium (He):** ~5.2 ppm\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.1 ppm\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion, ppb)\n\nBased on this comparison, Xenon is the rarest among the stable noble gases.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the abundance of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is different from the other noble gases because it is radioactive. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n\n*   **Source:** Radon is not a primordial element from Earth's formation. Instead, it is continuously generated by the radioactive decay of radium, which itself is a decay product of uranium found in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Decay:** Because of its extremely short half-life, radon decays into other elements very quickly after it is formed.\n*   **Equilibrium Amount:** This means that at any given moment, the total amount of radon gas existing on the entire planet is incredibly small. This \"standing inventory\" is a result of the balance between its constant rate of production and its rapid rate of decay. The atmospheric concentration of radon is highly variable but averages around 6 x 10⁻¹⁸ mole fraction, which is many millions of times less than that of Xenon.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the rarest candidates**\nThe final comparison is between Xenon and Radon.\n\n*   **Xenon:** While rare, there is a stable, measurable quantity of it on Earth, primarily in the atmosphere. The total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is estimated to be in the trillions of kilograms.\n*   **Radon:** Due to its rapid decay, the total amount of radon gas across the entire planet at any single moment is estimated to be extremely low, likely only a few tens of kilograms in the whole atmosphere.\n\nTherefore, the total inventory of Radon on Earth at any point in time is vastly smaller than the total inventory of Xenon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nConsidering the total amount present as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, Radon's extremely short half-life ensures that it is, by a very large margin, the rarest of all naturally occurring noble gases. The year 2002 does not change this fundamental fact.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
