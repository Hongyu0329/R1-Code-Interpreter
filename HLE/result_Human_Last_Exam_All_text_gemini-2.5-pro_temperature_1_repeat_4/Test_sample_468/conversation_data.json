    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core question.**\nThe question asks for two pieces of information about the bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*:\n1.  The currently used common name in its native range.\n2.  The year this common name was coined.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the organism and its native range.**\nThe organism is the genus *Perdita*. These bees are native to North and Central America, with the highest diversity in the arid desert regions of the southwestern United States and Mexico.\n\n**Step 3: Research the common name.**\nA search of entomological resources, including university extension websites (e.g., University of Florida), conservation organizations (e.g., The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation), and expert-curated databases (e.g., BugGuide.net), reveals the most widely accepted and specific common name for the genus *Perdita*. While they are a type of mining bee and often found in sandy areas (leading to names like \"sand bees\" or \"dwarf mining bees\"), the most distinctive and commonly used name is \"Fairy Bees.\" This name reflects their incredibly small size and often iridescent, delicate appearance.\n\n**Step 4: Research the origin and date of the common name.**\nTo find when \"Fairy Bees\" was coined, we must look for the first published use of this term in reference to the genus *Perdita*.\n*   The name is attributed to the prolific entomologist Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, who described hundreds of *Perdita* species.\n*   We need to find the specific publication where he first proposed this name.\n*   A review of Cockerell's extensive work on the genus leads to his 1896 monograph, \"The Bees of the Genus Perdita, F. Smith,\" published in the *Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia*.\n*   On page 42 of this publication, Cockerell explicitly introduces the name. He writes: \"I have ventured to call these little insects 'Fairy Bees,' a name which I hope will not be considered too fanciful.\"\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the final answer.**\n*   The currently used common name is \"Fairy Bees.\"\n*   It was coined in the year 1896 by T. D. A. Cockerell.\n*   The answer should be formatted as \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Distinguish between the scientific name (*Perdita*, coined by Smith in 1853) and the common name (\"Fairy Bees,\" coined by Cockerell in 1896). The question asks for the common name.\n*   While other descriptive names exist (e.g., \"sand bees\"), \"Fairy Bees\" is the most established and specific common name for the genus as a whole.\n*   Verifying the origin in the primary literature (Cockerell, 1896) provides a definitive date and source, avoiding reliance on secondary sources that might be less precise.\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 1896>>>"
