    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** Belongs to the Lviv-Warsaw School of philosophy.\n    *   **Specific Contribution:** Decomposed the notion of \"hallmark\" into two sub-categories: \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This was a highly influential Polish school of logic and analytic philosophy that flourished between the World Wars. Its founder was Kazimierz Twardowski, and its prominent members included Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The school was known for its clarity, logical rigor, and focus on epistemology, semantics, and logic.\n    *   **Hallmark (or Sign/Criterion):** In this context, a hallmark is something that indicates the presence of another thing or property. It's a piece of evidence from which one can infer something. The Polish term is often `znak` (sign) or `znamie` (mark/criterion).\n    *   **Symptom vs. Signal:** This is the specific philosophical distinction.\n        *   A **symptom** (Polish: `oznaka` or `symptom`) is a *natural sign*. It has a causal or natural connection to the thing it signifies. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of illness. The connection exists independently of human convention.\n        *   A **signal** (Polish: `sygnał`) is a *conventional sign*. Its meaning is established by agreement, intention, or rule, often for the purpose of communication. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; a ringing bell can be a signal that class is over. The connection is artificial, not natural.\n\n3.  **Identify the Philosopher:**\n    *   The task is to find which philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School introduced or extensively used this distinction.\n    *   A review of the works of the school's major figures reveals that this specific semiotic (theory of signs) distinction is a cornerstone of the philosophy of **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** (1890-1963).\n    *   Ajdukiewicz developed this analysis as part of his work on language, meaning, and logic, particularly in what he called \"pragmatic logic.\" He used this distinction to clarify the nature of inference and how we acquire knowledge from signs. He analyzed how we reason from evidence, categorizing that evidence into natural symptoms or conventional signals. This analysis was crucial to his theories of meaning and his anti-irrationalist stance.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The philosopher who decomposes the general notion of a sign or hallmark into the specific categories of symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. This distinction is a well-known and central part of his contribution to the Lviv-Warsaw School's legacy in semantics and epistemology.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
