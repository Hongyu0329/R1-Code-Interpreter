    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the fields and the extension structure**\n\nLet the base field be $K = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe extension field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\nLet's define intermediate fields to simplify the structure.\nLet $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is the biquadratic field, which is a well-known Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe Galois group $\\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the Klein four-group, $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. Its order is $|F:\\mathbb{Q}|=4$. The automorphisms are determined by their action on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n*   $\\text{id}$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_1$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_3 = \\sigma_1\\sigma_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nLet $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Note that $\\beta$ is an element of $F$.\nThe field $L$ can now be written as $L = F(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\nThe extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a tower of extensions: $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset F \\subset L$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension L/Q**\n\nThe degree of the total extension is given by the tower rule: $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:F] \\cdot [F:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\nWe know $[F:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$.\nThe degree $[L:F]$ is the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{\\beta}$ over $F$, which is $x^2 - \\beta = 0$. This polynomial has degree 2. The degree $[L:F]$ is 2, unless $\\sqrt{\\beta}$ is already in $F$ (i.e., $\\beta$ is a square of an element in $F$).\n\nLet's check if $\\beta$ is a square in $F$. A useful technique is to compute the norm of $\\beta$ to a subfield.\nConsider the norm from $F$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot \\sigma_2((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nIf $\\beta$ were a square in $F$, say $\\beta = \\gamma^2$ for some $\\gamma \\in F$, then its norm must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$: $N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma))^2$.\nSo, we must check if $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is equivalent to checking if 6 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's assume $6 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$6 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $a,b$ are rational, we must have $2ab=0$, which means $a=0$ or $b=0$.\nIf $a=0$, $6=2b^2 \\implies b^2=3 \\implies b=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$, not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $b=0$, $6=a^2 \\implies a=\\pm\\sqrt{6}$, not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo, 6 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This implies that $N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta)$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nTherefore, $\\beta$ cannot be a square in $F$.\nThis means $[L:F]=2$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:F][F:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Show L/Q is a Galois extension**\n\nFor $L$ to be Galois over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it must be a normal extension. This means it must be the splitting field of some polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's find the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The roots of this polynomial are the conjugates of $\\alpha$ under the automorphisms in $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. Any such automorphism $g$ restricts to an automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$. The action of $g$ on $\\alpha$ is $g(\\alpha)^2 = g(\\alpha^2) = g(\\beta) = \\sigma(\\beta)$. Thus, the conjugates of $\\alpha$ are of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{\\sigma(\\beta)}$ for $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe conjugates of $\\beta$ are:\n*   $\\beta_1 = \\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_2 = \\sigma_1(\\beta) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_3 = \\sigma_2(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_4 = \\sigma_3(\\beta) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $P(x) = \\prod_{\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})} (x^2 - \\sigma(\\beta))$.\nThe roots of $P(x)$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_1}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_2}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_3}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_4}$.\nFor $L$ to be normal, all these roots must be in $L = F(\\sqrt{\\beta_1})$.\nWe have $\\sqrt{\\beta_1\\beta_2} = \\sqrt{2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})$, which is in $F \\subset L$. So $\\sqrt{\\beta_2} = \\sqrt{\\beta_1\\beta_2}/\\sqrt{\\beta_1} \\in L$.\nWe have $\\sqrt{\\beta_1\\beta_3} = \\sqrt{6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})$, which is in $F \\subset L$. So $\\sqrt{\\beta_3} = \\sqrt{\\beta_1\\beta_3}/\\sqrt{\\beta_1} \\in L$.\nWe have $\\sqrt{\\beta_1\\beta_4} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$, which is in $F \\subset L$. So $\\sqrt{\\beta_4} = \\sqrt{\\beta_1\\beta_4}/\\sqrt{\\beta_1} \\in L$.\nSince all roots of $P(x)$ are in $L$, $L$ is the splitting field of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and thus a Galois extension.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the Galois group**\n\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8. The possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ (abelian), and $D_4$, $Q_8$ (non-abelian).\n\nWe can determine the group structure using a known criterion for extensions of biquadratic fields. Let $F=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d_1}, \\sqrt{d_2})$ and $L=F(\\sqrt{\\alpha})$. Let $\\sigma_1$ be the automorphism swapping the sign of $\\sqrt{d_1}$ and $\\sigma_2$ be the one for $\\sqrt{d_2}$. The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is:\n*   $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ if $\\alpha, \\alpha\\sigma_1(\\alpha), \\alpha\\sigma_2(\\alpha)$ are all squares times elements of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   $C_4 \\times C_2$ if exactly one of $\\alpha\\sigma_1(\\alpha)$, $\\alpha\\sigma_2(\\alpha)$, $\\alpha\\sigma_3(\\alpha)$ is a square in $F^\\times$.\n*   $D_4$ if none of $\\alpha\\sigma_1(\\alpha)$, $\\alpha\\sigma_2(\\alpha)$, $\\alpha\\sigma_3(\\alpha)$ are squares in $F^\\times$.\n*   $Q_8$ under more specific conditions, including the above for $D_4$.\n\nLet's apply this criterion with $\\alpha = \\beta$, $d_1=2$, $d_2=3$. We need to check if the following products are squares in $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$:\n1.  $\\beta\\sigma_1(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = (4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$.\n    This is a square in $F$ if and only if 2 is a square in $F$. If $2$ were a square in $F$, then $F$ would contain $\\sqrt[4]{2}$, making $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2})$. However, $F$ is a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, while $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2})$ is not (it lacks the root $i\\sqrt[4]{2}$). Thus, 2 is not a square in $F$.\n    So, $\\beta\\sigma_1(\\beta)$ is **not a square** in $F$.\n\n2.  $\\beta\\sigma_2(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n    This is a square in $F$ if and only if 6 is a square in $F$. Since $\\sqrt{6} = \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3}$ is an element of $F$, 6 is indeed a square in $F$.\n    So, $\\beta\\sigma_2(\\beta)$ **is a square** in $F$.\n\n3.  $\\beta\\sigma_3(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (4-2)(9-3) = 12$.\n    This is a square in $F$ if and only if $\\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$ is a square in $F$. Let's assume $2\\sqrt{3} = \\gamma^2$ for some $\\gamma = a+b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{3}+d\\sqrt{6} \\in F$. Then $\\gamma^2 = (a^2+2b^2+3c^2+6d^2) + (2ab+6bd)\\sqrt{2} + (2ac+4cd)\\sqrt{3} + (2ad+2bc)\\sqrt{6}$. Equating this to $2\\sqrt{3}$, we get $a^2+2b^2+3c^2+6d^2=0$, which implies $a=b=c=d=0$ for rational coefficients. This would mean $\\gamma=0$, which is false. Thus, 12 is not a square in $F$.\n    So, $\\beta\\sigma_3(\\beta)$ is **not a square** in $F$.\n\nSince exactly one of the three products is a square in $F$, the criterion tells us that the Galois group is isomorphic to $C_4 \\times C_2$."
