  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The primary goal is to find the maximum possible length (in characters) of the secret message hidden in the Ching book.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Plaintext (The Secret Message):**\n    *   The problem states the secret message is \"written using the letters in the Shu.\"\n    *   The Shu book is composed of a specific set of \"120 most common Chinese characters.\"\n    *   This means the alphabet for the secret message consists of 120 unique characters.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Ciphertext (The Encrypted Message):**\n    *   The Ching book is the source of the encryption. It \"contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing.\"\n    *   The natural interpretation is that this sequence of 9999 symbols *is* the encrypted message.\n\n4.  **Determine the Encoding Scheme:**\n    *   We need to establish the relationship between the symbols in the Ching (ciphertext) and the characters of the message (plaintext).\n    *   The question asks for the *maximum* length of the message. To achieve the maximum possible length from a fixed number of encoded symbols, the encoding must be as efficient as possible.\n    *   The most efficient encoding is a direct substitution where **one symbol from the Ching represents one character of the secret message**.\n\n5.  **Check the Feasibility of the Encoding:**\n    *   The message alphabet has 120 unique characters that need to be represented.\n    *   The Ching provides 9999 symbols. Since 9999 is far greater than 120, we have more than enough symbols to assign a unique representation to each character. For example, we could decide that a 'yin-water' symbol represents character #1, a 'yang-fire' symbol represents character #2, and so on. The same symbol can be used multiple times throughout the 9999-symbol sequence to represent repeated characters in the message.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Message Length:**\n    *   The Ching book contains a sequence of 9999 symbols.\n    *   Based on the most efficient encoding (one symbol per character), each of these 9999 symbols decodes into a single character of the original message.\n    *   Therefore, the total length of the message is equal to the total number of symbols.\n    *   Maximum message length = 9999 characters.\n\n7.  **Identify and Discard Irrelevant Information (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Shu's total characters (~3000):** This is background information. The crucial detail is the alphabet size (120), not the total length of the Shu book.\n    *   **Computer vision and computation times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns):** This information describes the tools and performance of the analysis that was done. It is a \"red herring\" and has no bearing on the information theory aspect of the problem, which is about the relationship between the length of the ciphertext and the plaintext.\n    *   **\"yinyang-wuxing\":** This describes the *type* of symbols, but the important fact is their total count (9999).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is determined by the number of symbols available to encode it. Since the Ching book contains 9999 symbols and the most efficient encoding uses one symbol per character, the maximum possible length of the message is 9999 characters.\n\n<<<9999>>>"
