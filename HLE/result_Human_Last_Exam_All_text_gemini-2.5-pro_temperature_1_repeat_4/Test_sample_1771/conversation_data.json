    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the PIE verb `*seh₂gieti`.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-`. The root means 'to track, seek out, give a sign'.\n*   **Structure:** This is a thematic present tense verb.\n    *   `*s-`: Initial sibilant.\n    *   `-eh₂-`: The root vowel in e-grade (`e`) followed by a laryngeal (`h₂`).\n    *   `-g-`: A voiced velar stop.\n    *   `-ie-`: A suffix used to form present tense stems.\n    *   `-ti`: The 3rd person singular primary active ending.\n\n### **Step 2: Trace from PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\nWe apply the regular sound changes that occurred as PIE evolved into Proto-Germanic.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Laryngeal Effect:** The laryngeal `*h₂` \"colors\" an adjacent `*e` to `*a`. After coloring the vowel, the laryngeal disappears but lengthens the preceding vowel.\n    *   `*seh₂g-` -> `*sāg-` (This happens within late PIE or on the way to Germanic). This reconstructed root `*sāg-` is consistent with the Latin cognate `sāgīre`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Vowel Shift:** PIE long `*ā` regularly becomes PGmc long `*ō`.\n    *   `*sāg-` -> `*sōk-` (The consonant change is explained next).\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Grimm's Law:** This law describes a systematic shift in stop consonants.\n    *   PIE voiced stops become voiceless stops in PGmc. Thus, PIE `*g` -> PGmc `*k`.\n    *   PIE voiceless stops become voiceless fricatives in PGmc. Thus, PIE `*t` (in the ending `*-ti`) -> PGmc `*þ`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Verb Formation:** The PIE suffix `*-ie-` becomes the suffix `*-ja-` for Class 1 weak verbs in Proto-Germanic. The infinitive would be `*sōkijaną`. For the 3rd person singular present, the form is reconstructed as `*sōkiþ`. The `*j` is lost, but its presence is marked by the `*i` vowel.\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:**\n    *   The PIE form `*sāg-ie-ti` becomes PGmc `*sōk-i-þi`, which is typically written as **`*sōkiþ`**.\n\n### **Step 3: Trace from Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages**\n\nNow we trace the PGmc form `*sōkiþ` (and its corresponding infinitive `*sōkijaną`) into Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n#### **A. Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: I-Umlaut:** The `/i/` (or `/j/`) in the verb's stem causes the back root vowel `*ō` to be fronted to `*ø̄`. In Old Norse, this is written as `ǿ` or `œ`.\n    *   `*sō-` -> `sǿ-`\n*   **Careful Point 6: Ending Change:** The PGmc 3rd person singular ending `*-iþ` regularly becomes `-ir` in Old Norse for this class of verbs.\n*   **Old Norse Result:** PGmc `*sōkiþ` -> **`sǿkir`** (meaning 'he seeks').\n\n#### **B. Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 5 (cont.): I-Umlaut:** As in Old Norse, `*ō` is fronted to `*ø̄`. In most Old English dialects (including West Saxon), `*ø̄` then unrounds to become `*ē`.\n    *   `*sō-` -> `*sǿ-` -> `sē-`\n*   **Careful Point 7: Palatalization:** The PGmc consonant `*k` becomes palatalized to `/tʃ/` (written `c`) when it comes before a front vowel like the `ē` that resulted from umlaut.\n    *   `*sēk-` -> `sēc-` (/seːtʃ-/)\n*   **Careful Point 8: Vowel and Ending Retention:** The thematic vowel `i` is generally reduced to `e`. The ending `*-þ` is retained.\n    *   `-iþ` -> `-eþ`\n*   **Old English Result:** PGmc `*sōkiþ` -> **`sēceþ`** (or the contracted form `sēcþ`, meaning 'he seeks').\n\n#### **C. Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 9: OHG Vowel Shift:** PGmc `*ō` becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German.\n    *   `*sō-` -> `suo-`\n*   **Careful Point 10: High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** PGmc voiceless stops are shifted.\n    *   PGmc `*k` becomes the fricative `hh` `/x/` between vowels. In the 3sg form `*sōkiþ`, the shift also applies, resulting in `suohh-` or `suoch-`.\n    *   PGmc `*þ` becomes the voiced stop `d`. In word-final position, this `d` devoices to `t`.\n    *   `-iþ` -> `-it`\n*   **Careful Point 5 (cont.): I-Umlaut in OHG:** I-umlaut also occurs in OHG, turning `uo` into `üe`. This is seen in the 2nd and 3rd person singular forms, giving `süohhit`. However, the spelling without the umlaut diacritic (`suohhit`) is also very common in manuscripts.\n*   **Old High German Result:** PGmc `*sōkiþ` -> **`suohhit`** (or `süohhit`, meaning 'he seeks').\n\n### **Summary of Results**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkiþ`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sǿkir`\n*   **Old English:** `sēceþ`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhit`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkiþ; Old Norse: sǿkir; Old English: sēceþ; Old High German: suohhit>>>"
