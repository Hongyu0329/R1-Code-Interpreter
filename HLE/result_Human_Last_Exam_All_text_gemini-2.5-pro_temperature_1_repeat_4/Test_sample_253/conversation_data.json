    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the binary pattern for Rule 110 after 20 steps, starting from a single '1' cell.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Cellular Automaton Rule 110\n\nA one-dimensional cellular automaton consists of a line of cells, each having a state (in this case, 0 or 1). The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its own state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors. This group of three cells is called the \"neighborhood\".\n\nThe rule number, 110, is the decimal representation of an 8-bit binary number that defines the output for all 8 possible neighborhood patterns.\n\n1.  **Convert the rule number to binary:**\n    110 in decimal is `01101110` in 8-bit binary.\n\n2.  **Create the rule table:**\n    This binary string maps to the 8 possible neighborhood patterns, which are typically ordered from `111` down to `000`.\n\n| Current Neighborhood | Binary Value | Rule `01101110` | New State |\n| :------------------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :-------- |\n| `111`                | 7            | **0**           | 0         |\n| `110`                | 6            | **1**           | 1         |\n| `101`                | 5            | **1**           | 1         |\n| `100`                | 4            | **0**           | 0         |\n| `011`                | 3            | **1**           | 1         |\n| `010`                | 2            | **1**           | 1         |\n| `001`                | 1            | **1**           | 1         |\n| `000`                | 0            | **0**           | 0         |\n\nA careful point here is to ensure the correct mapping. The first bit of `01101110` corresponds to the `111` pattern, the second to `110`, and so on.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Simulation\n\n*   **Initial State (t=0):** A single cell in state 1, on an infinite background of 0s. We represent this as `...0001000...`. The evolving pattern will be the focus.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** We assume the grid is infinite. Any cell outside the visible pattern is treated as a 0. This is the \"quiescent background\" assumption.\n*   **Iterations:** We need to apply the rule 20 times to get the state at t=20.\n\n### Step 3: Evolve the Pattern Step-by-Step\n\nWe will now apply the rule table iteratively. The pattern is shown without the infinite leading/trailing zeros.\n\n*   **t=0:** `1`\n    *   (Padded: ...0**010**... -> next center is 1; ...**001**... -> next left is 1; ...**100**... -> next right is 0)\n*   **t=1:** `11`\n*   **t=2:** `111`\n*   **t=3:** `1101`\n*   **t=4:** `11111`\n*   **t=5:** `110001`\n*   **t=6:** `1110011`\n*   **t=7:** `11010111`\n*   **t=8:** `11111101`\n*   **t=9:** `110000111`\n*   **t=10:** `1110001101`\n*   **t=11:** `11010011111`\n*   **t=12:** `111110110001`\n*   **t=13:** `1100011110011`\n*   **t=14:** `11100110010111`\n*   **t=15:** `110101110111101`\n*   **t=16:** `111111011100111`\n*   **t=17:** `1100001110101101`\n*   **t=18:** `111000110111111111`\n*   **t=19:** `110100111100000001`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Pattern (t=20)\n\nLet's carefully calculate the 20th step from the 19th step.\n\n*   **Pattern at t=19:** `110100111100000001`\n*   We pad it with zeros: `...00`**`110100111100000001`**`00...`\n*   Now we apply the rule to every 3-cell neighborhood of the padded t=19 string to get the t=20 string.\n\n| Neighborhood (from t=19) | New State (for t=20) |\n| :----------------------- | :------------------- |\n| `001`                    | 1                    |\n| `011`                    | 1                    |\n| `110`                    | 1                    |\n| `101`                    | 1                    |\n| `010`                    | 1                    |\n| `100`                    | 0                    |\n| `001`                    | 1                    |\n| `011`                    | 1                    |\n| `111`                    | 0                    |\n| `111`                    | 0                    |\n| `110`                    | 1                    |\n| `100`                    | 0                    |\n| `000`                    | 0                    |\n| `000`                    | 0                    |\n| `000`                    | 0                    |\n| `000`                    | 0                    |\n| `001`                    | 1                    |\n| `010`                    | 1                    |\n| `100`                    | 0                    |\n\nAssembling these new states gives the final pattern.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe binary pattern at step 20 is `111110110010000011`.\n\n<<<111110110010000011>>>"
