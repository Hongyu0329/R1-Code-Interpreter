    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n1.  **Given Information:**\n    *   `x(n)` is a 4-point sequence. Its 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`.\n    *   `h(n)` is a 4-point sequence. Its 4-point DFT is `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`.\n    *   We need to find the 4-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(m)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Sequence:**\n    The new sequence is `y(m) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n    This is an 8-point sequence (`m = 0, 1, ..., 7`). We can express its elements in terms of `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n    *   The even-indexed elements are `y(2n) = x(n)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   The odd-indexed elements are `y(2n+1) = h(n)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n3.  **Objective:**\n    The goal is to compute the 4-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(m)`. Let's call this `Y_4(k)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **DFT Length Mismatch:** The core of the problem is to compute an N-point DFT (N=4) for a sequence of length M (M=8). This is a valid operation, defined by the standard DFT formula, but the sequence is effectively \"aliased\" or \"folded\" in the frequency domain.\n*   **DFT Formula:** The N-point DFT of a sequence `f(m)` of length M is given by `F(k) = Σ_{m=0}^{M-1} f(m) * W_N^{km}`, where `W_N = e^{-j2π/N}`.\n*   **Twiddle Factors:** We need the 4-point DFT twiddle factors: `W_4 = e^{-j2π/4} = -j`. The powers are `W_4^0 = 1`, `W_4^1 = -j`, `W_4^2 = -1`, `W_4^3 = j`.\n*   **Relating to Given DFTs:** The final expression for `Y_4(k)` should be solvable using the provided `X(k)` and `H(k)`, not the time-domain sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`. This requires algebraic manipulation to express the new DFT sum in terms of the original DFT sums.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Write the formula for the 4-point DFT of `y(m)`.**\nThe 4-point DFT, `Y_4(k)`, of the 8-point sequence `y(m)` is:\n`Y_4(k) = Σ_{m=0}^{7} y(m) * W_4^{km}` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n**Step 2: Split the summation into even and odd indexed terms.**\nWe can separate the sum over `m` into a sum over even indices (`m=2n`) and a sum over odd indices (`m=2n+1`).\n`Y_4(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} y(2n) * W_4^{k(2n)} + Σ_{n=0}^{3} y(2n+1) * W_4^{k(2n+1)}`\n\n**Step 3: Substitute `x(n)` and `h(n)` into the formula.**\nUsing `y(2n) = x(n)` and `y(2n+1) = h(n)`:\n`Y_4(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} x(n) * W_4^{2kn} + Σ_{n=0}^{3} h(n) * W_4^{k(2n+1)}`\nFactor out `W_4^k` from the second term:\n`Y_4(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} x(n) * (W_4^2)^{kn} + W_4^k * Σ_{n=0}^{3} h(n) * (W_4^2)^{kn}`\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the twiddle factor `W_4^2`.**\n`W_4^2 = (-j)^2 = -1`.\nSubstitute this back into the equation:\n`Y_4(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} x(n) * (-1)^{kn} + W_4^k * Σ_{n=0}^{3} h(n) * (-1)^{kn}`\n\n**Step 5: Relate the summations to the given DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`.**\nThe definition of the 4-point DFT of `x(n)` is `X(p) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} x(n) * W_4^{pn}`.\nNotice that `(-1)^{kn} = (W_4^2)^{kn} = W_4^{(2k)n}`.\nSo, the first summation `Σ_{n=0}^{3} x(n) * (-1)^{kn}` is exactly the 4-point DFT of `x(n)` evaluated at index `2k`. Due to the 4-point periodicity of the DFT, this is `X(2k mod 4)`.\nSimilarly, the second summation is `H(2k mod 4)`.\nThe formula becomes:\n`Y_4(k) = X(2k mod 4) + W_4^k * H(2k mod 4)`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate `Y_4(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.**\n\n*   **For k = 0:**\n    `Y_4(0) = X(2*0 mod 4) + W_4^0 * H(2*0 mod 4)`\n    `Y_4(0) = X(0) + (1) * H(0)`\n    Given `X(0)=1` and `H(0)=0`,\n    `Y_4(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k = 1:**\n    `Y_4(1) = X(2*1 mod 4) + W_4^1 * H(2*1 mod 4)`\n    `Y_4(1) = X(2) + (-j) * H(2)`\n    Given `X(2)=-1` and `H(2)=1`,\n    `Y_4(1) = -1 - j * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n*   **For k = 2:**\n    `Y_4(2) = X(2*2 mod 4) + W_4^2 * H(2*2 mod 4)`\n    `Y_4(2) = X(4 mod 4) + (-1) * H(4 mod 4)`\n    `Y_4(2) = X(0) - H(0)`\n    Given `X(0)=1` and `H(0)=0`,\n    `Y_4(2) = 1 - 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k = 3:**\n    `Y_4(3) = X(2*3 mod 4) + W_4^3 * H(2*3 mod 4)`\n    `Y_4(3) = X(6 mod 4) + (j) * H(6 mod 4)`\n    `Y_4(3) = X(2) + j * H(2)`\n    Given `X(2)=-1` and `H(2)=1`,\n    `Y_4(3) = -1 + j * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n**Step 7: Assemble the final DFT sequence.**\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is the collection of the values calculated above:\n`Y_4(k) = [Y_4(0), Y_4(1), Y_4(2), Y_4(3)]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
