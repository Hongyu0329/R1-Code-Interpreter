    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the character 謄**\nThe Japanese character 謄 is a compound kanji with a left-right structure (known as *hen-tsukuri*).\n*   The left component is **言**.\n*   The right component is **滕**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the radical (bushu)**\nIn characters with a left-right structure, the left component often serves as the radical, indicating the general meaning or category of the character.\n*   The component **言** means \"words,\" \"to say,\" or \"speech.\"\n*   The character **謄** means \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe\" (e.g., in words like 謄写 *tōsha* - transcription, or 戸籍謄本 *koseki tōhon* - official family register copy).\n*   Since the meaning of 謄 is related to words and documents, **言** is the radical. The right part, 滕, acts as the phonetic component.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the name of the radical**\nJapanese radicals have specific names, which often change depending on their position in the character.\n*   When the radical **言** appears on the left side of a character, it is called **ごんべん (gonben)**. The \"-hen\" (written as 偏, but often transcribed as \"-ben\" due to rendaku) part of the name signifies that it is on the left side.\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe final step is to write the Japanese name ごんべん using the standard Hepburn transcription system.\n*   ごんべん is romanized as **gonben**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Character Structure:** It's essential to correctly identify the character's components. 謄 is clearly divided into 言 on the left and 滕 on the right.\n2.  **Radical vs. Phonetic Component:** Recognize that the left part (言) provides the meaning (the radical) and the right part (滕) provides the sound.\n3.  **Positional Naming:** Be aware that the name of a radical can depend on its position. For the radical 言, its standard name as a standalone character is \"iu\" or \"gen,\" but as a left-side radical, its specific name is \"gonben.\" The example provided in the question (\"Onnahen\" for 媛) confirms that this positional name is required.\n4.  **Accurate Romanization:** Ensure the Hepburn transcription is correct. ごんべん is \"gonben\".\n\nFollowing this analysis, the radical of 謄 is 言, and its name is Gonben.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
