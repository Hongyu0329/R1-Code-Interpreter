    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's components.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian based on four key criteria:\n1.  **Who:** A Christian theologian.\n2.  **What:** They developed \"specialized terminology.\" This means we are looking for a unique or technical set of terms, not just a general discussion of the topic.\n3.  **Concept:** The terminology is used to describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\" This involves the philosophical and theological problem of how God interacts with the world he created, particularly concerning miracles and systemic shifts.\n4.  **Examples:** The terminology must be applicable to two specific cases:\n    *   The virgin birth of Jesus (a singular, miraculous event).\n    *   Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall (a systemic, foundational change in how the world works).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate potential candidates.**\nSeveral major theologians have addressed God's power, miracles, and nature. We must see whose work best fits all the criteria.\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225–1274):** Aquinas is a strong candidate. He famously distinguished between God's \"ordained power\" (*potentia ordinata*)—how God usually acts through the consistent laws of nature—and his \"absolute power\" (*potentia absoluta*)—God's ability to do anything that isn't a logical contradiction. A miracle like the virgin birth would be an act of God's absolute power, outside the ordained laws of biology. A change at the Fall could be seen as God establishing a new \"ordained\" order for the fallen world. While this terminology is relevant, it was a common distinction in scholastic theology and describes God's power *in relation to* the law, rather than a mechanism of change *within* nature itself.\n\n*   **John Calvin (1509–1564) and other Reformers:** The Reformers certainly believed in miracles and the effects of the Fall. However, their primary focus was on soteriology (the doctrine of salvation) and the authority of Scripture. They did not focus on developing a new, specialized philosophical vocabulary for the laws of nature in the way that earlier systematic theologians did.\n\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD):** Augustine is an exceptionally strong candidate. In his works, such as *The Literal Meaning of Genesis* (*De Genesi ad litteram*) and *City of God*, he dealt extensively with creation, providence, and miracles. He wanted to explain how novelties and miracles could occur in a world created by a non-deceiving, consistent God.\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** Augustine developed the doctrine of **_rationes seminales_**, which translates to \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal principles.\"\n    *   **How it Works:** He argued that God, in the initial act of creation, embedded all future potentialities into the world as latent causal principles, or seeds (_rationes seminales_). The regular unfolding of nature is the activation of the most common of these principles.\n    *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** For Augustine, the virgin birth was not a violation of nature. Instead, it was the activation by God of a special _ratio seminalis_ that he had placed in creation from the very beginning, waiting for the right moment in history. It was not contrary to nature, but contrary to *our experience* of nature.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** This framework also elegantly applies to the Fall. The negative changes in the world—such as the ground bringing forth \"thorns and thistles,\" pain in childbirth, and physical decay—can be understood as the activation of dormant, penal _rationes seminales_ as a consequence of human sin. The laws of nature didn't change in the sense of being rewritten, but rather, the system's pre-programmed response to sin was triggered.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude by comparing the candidates.**\nWhile Aquinas's terminology is relevant, Augustine's concept of _rationes seminales_ is more specific and foundational to his thought. It is a highly \"specialized terminology\" that he developed to provide a comprehensive mechanism for how both singular miracles (the virgin birth) and systemic changes (the consequences of the Fall) could occur within the single, coherent plan of God's creation. He is the theologian most famous for this specific intellectual framework.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe theologian who developed this specific terminology is Augustine of Hippo.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
