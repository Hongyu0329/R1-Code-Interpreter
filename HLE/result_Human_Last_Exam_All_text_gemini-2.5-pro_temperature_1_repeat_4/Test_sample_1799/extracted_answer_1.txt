No, it is not true that the 2nd postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the first. The second postulate is a necessary and independent axiom. While Maxwell's equations (a law of physics) predict a constant speed of light `c`, prior to Einstein it was assumed this speed was relative to a preferred reference frame (the "ether"). This would violate the first postulate. Einstein's second postulate was a radical assertion that the speed of light is constant for *all* inertial observers, which, when combined with the first postulate, forces the abandonment of Galilean relativity and leads to the new kinematics of special relativity. Therefore, the second postulate is not a deduction from the first but a foundational pillar of the theory alongside it.
