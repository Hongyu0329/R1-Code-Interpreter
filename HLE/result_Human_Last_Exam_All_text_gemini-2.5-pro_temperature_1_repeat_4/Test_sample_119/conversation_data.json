    "This is a mate-in-2 puzzle.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the position:** The white king is on g5, which is a very exposed and dangerous square. It is surrounded by Black's attacking pieces: a rook on h2, a knight on e5, and a rook on e8. White's own pawns on f3 and g6 restrict the king's movement. Black's goal is to deliver a decisive check.\n\n2.  **Identify Black's first move:** Black should look for the most forcing move, which is a check. The most powerful check available is `...f6+`.\n    *   This pawn move puts the white king in check.\n    *   We must check all of White's possible responses. The king cannot move to h6 or h5 (controlled by the rook on h2), nor to g4 or f5 (controlled by the knight on e5).\n    *   The only legal move for White is to capture the checking pawn.\n\n3.  **Identify White's forced response:** White is forced to play `Kxg6`. Now the white king is on g6.\n\n4.  **Identify Black's second move (the mating move):** With the white king now on g6, Black must find a move that is checkmate.\n    *   Black plays `...Re7#`.\n    *   This move puts the king on g6 in check by the rook on e7.\n    *   Let's verify this is checkmate by checking all the king's escape squares:\n        *   h7 is attacked by the rook on e7.\n        *   f7 is attacked by the knight on e5.\n        *   h5 is attacked by the rook on h2.\n        *   f5 is attacked by the knight on e5.\n    *   The king has no safe squares to move to.\n    *   The checking piece (the rook on e7) cannot be captured.\n    *   The check cannot be blocked.\n    *   Therefore, this is checkmate.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It's crucial to confirm that White's first move (`Kxg6`) is the *only* legal move in response to `...f6+`. All other potential king moves are illegal as they are covered by Black's pieces.\n*   En passant capture (`gxf6`) is not possible. The black pawn on f7 only moved one square to f6, not two from f7 to f5.\n*   In the final position, every escape square for the king on g6 is covered by a different black piece, showcasing excellent coordination.\n\n**Final Mating Sequence:**\n\n1.  Black moves: `f6+`\n2.  White moves: `Kxg6`\n3.  Black moves: `Re7#`\n\n<<<f6+ Kxg6 Re7#>>>"
