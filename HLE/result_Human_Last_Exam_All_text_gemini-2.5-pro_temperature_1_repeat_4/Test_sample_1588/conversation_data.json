    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$, where X and Y are non-commuting variables (like matrices or operators). The formula is an infinite series of nested commutators of X and Y:\n$Z = X + Y + \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y] + \\frac{1}{12}([X,[X,Y]] - [Y,[X,Y]]) + \\dots$\n\nThe *order* (or degree) of a term in this expansion is the total number of X's and Y's it contains. The terms of a specific order $n$, denoted $Z_n$, are all linear combinations of Lie commutators of degree $n$.\n\n**2. Relate Coefficients to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe terms $Z_n(X, Y)$ are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, X and Y. Let's denote this algebra as $L(X, Y)$. The subspace of elements of homogeneous degree $n$ is denoted $L_n(X, Y)$.\n\nThe question asks for the \"number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\". This is equivalent to asking for the number of linearly independent commutators of degree 10 that are present in the expression for $Z_{10}$.\n\nA crucial and non-trivial theorem from the theory of free Lie algebras states that when the BCH series $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ is expressed in any basis of the free Lie algebra $L(X, Y)$ (for example, a Hall basis or a Lyndon basis), all the coefficients are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the problem of counting the number of non-zero coefficients of order $n$ reduces to finding the dimension of the vector space $L_n(X, Y)$.\n\n**3. Use Witt's Formula to Find the Dimension**\n\nThe dimension of the homogeneous subspace of degree $n$ of a free Lie algebra on $k$ generators, denoted $d_n(k)$, is given by Witt's formula:\n$d_n(k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\nwhere:\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n*   $k$ is the number of generators.\n\nIn our case, we are interested in order $n=10$ and the generators are X and Y, so $k=2$.\n\n**4. Apply Witt's Formula for n=10, k=2**\n\nWe need to calculate $d_{10}(2)$:\n$d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identify all divisors of n=10.**\n    The divisors of 10 are $d = 1, 2, 5, 10$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor.**\n    The Möbius function is defined as:\n    *   $\\mu(d) = 1$ if $d$ is a square-free integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    *   $\\mu(d) = -1$ if $d$ is a square-free integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    *   $\\mu(d) = 0$ if $d$ has a squared prime factor.\n\n    Let's calculate the values:\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$ (by definition).\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is prime, one prime factor).\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is prime, one prime factor).\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (two distinct prime factors).\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Substitute the values into the formula and compute each term.**\n    The sum has four terms corresponding to the four divisors:\n    *   For $d=1$: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = 1 \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$\n    *   For $d=2$: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = -1 \\cdot 2^5 = -32$\n    *   For $d=5$: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = -1 \\cdot 2^2 = -4$\n    *   For $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 2$\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Sum the terms and finalize the calculation.**\n    Sum of terms = $1024 - 32 - 4 + 2$\n    Sum = $992 - 4 + 2$\n    Sum = $988 + 2$\n    Sum = $990$\n\n    Now, divide by $n=10$:\n    $d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 990 = 99$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the degree-10 subspace of the free Lie algebra on two generators. This dimension is calculated using Witt's formula to be 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
