    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition of $n$. A partition of an integer $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\dots + \\lambda_k = n$, where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$. The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the Hook-Length Formula.\n\nWe are looking for the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ such that $d_\\lambda < 500,000$.\n\nA key property is that the dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is equal to the dimension of the irrep corresponding to its conjugate partition $\\lambda^*$. The conjugate partition $\\lambda^*$ is obtained by transposing the Young diagram of $\\lambda$. If $\\lambda = \\lambda^*$, the partition is called self-conjugate.\n\nOur strategy will be to systematically list partitions and calculate their dimensions, starting with those most likely to have small dimensions. These are the partitions whose Young diagrams are \"long and thin\" or \"tall and narrow\". These correspond to partitions with a very large first part, or partitions with many parts (i.e., whose conjugate has a very large first part).\n\nLet's list the partitions $\\lambda$ with a large first part $\\lambda_1$ and calculate their dimensions.\n\n**1. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 25$**\n*   $\\lambda = (25)$: This corresponds to the trivial representation. $d_{(25)} = 1$.\n    Its conjugate is $\\lambda^* = (1^{25})$, which also has dimension 1.\n    Both are < 500,000. (2 irreps)\n\n**2. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 24$**\n*   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$: This corresponds to the standard representation. $d_{(24,1)} = n-1 = 24$.\n    Its conjugate is $\\lambda^* = (2, 1^{23})$, with the same dimension 24.\n    Both are < 500,000. (2 irreps)\n\n**3. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 23$**\n*   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n*   $\\lambda = (23, 1, 1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n    Both have dimensions < 500,000. Their conjugates, $(2^2, 1^{21})$ and $(3, 1^{22})$, also have the same dimensions. (4 irreps)\n\n**4. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 22$**\n*   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = 2025$.\n*   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4025$.\n*   $\\lambda = (22, 1, 1, 1)$: $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$.\n    All three and their conjugates have dimensions < 500,000. (6 irreps)\n\n**5. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 21$**\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 4)$: $d=10,350$.\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 3, 1)$: $d=31,350$.\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 2)$: $d=21,000$.\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 1, 1)$: $d=31,625$.\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 1^4)$: $d=\\binom{24}{4}=10,626$.\n    All five and their conjugates have dimensions < 500,000. (10 irreps)\n\n**6. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 20$**\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 5)$: $d=40,480$.\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 4, 1)$: $d=104,775$.\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 2)$: $d=106,250$.\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 1, 1)$: $d=167,200$.\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 2, 1)$: $d=136,500$.\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 1^3)$: $d=126,750$.\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 1^5)$: $d=\\binom{24}{5}=42,504$.\n    All seven and their conjugates have dimensions < 500,000. (14 irreps)\n\n**7. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 19$**\n*   $\\lambda = (19, 6)$: $d=123,970$.\n*   $\\lambda = (19, 5, 1)$: $d=320,320$.\n*   $\\lambda = (19, 4, 2)$: $d=386,100$.\n*   $\\lambda = (19, 3, 3)$: $d=257,600$.\n*   $\\lambda = (19, 1^6)$: $d=\\binom{24}{6}=134,596$.\n    The next partitions, like $(19, 4, 1, 1)$ have dimensions > 500,000 ($d=608,300$). So we have found 5 partitions here. All five and their conjugates have dimensions < 500,000. (10 irreps)\n\n**8. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 18$**\n*   $\\lambda = (18, 7)$: $d=303,600$.\n*   $\\lambda = (18, 1^7)$: $d=\\binom{24}{7}=346,104$.\n    Partitions like $(18, 6, 1)$ have dimensions > 500,000 ($d=817,190$). We have found 2 partitions here. Both and their conjugates have dimensions < 500,000. (4 irreps)\n\n**9. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 17$**\n*   $d_{(17,8)} = 600,875 > 500,000$.\n*   $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471 > 500,000$.\nAny other partition starting with 17 will be \"more central\" and thus have an even larger dimension. So no partitions with $\\lambda_1 \\le 17$ will have a dimension less than 500,000.\n\n**Summary of partitions found:**\nWe have found:\n*   From $\\lambda_1=25$: 1 partition, (25).\n*   From $\\lambda_1=24$: 1 partition, (24,1).\n*   From $\\lambda_1=23$: 2 partitions.\n*   From $\\lambda_1=22$: 3 partitions.\n*   From $\\lambda_1=21$: 5 partitions.\n*   From $\\lambda_1=20$: 7 partitions.\n*   From $\\lambda_1=19$: 5 partitions.\n*   From $\\lambda_1=18$: 2 partitions.\nTotal partitions found: $1+1+2+3+5+7+5+2 = 26$.\n\nEach of these 26 partitions, $\\lambda$, is not self-conjugate. For example, for $\\lambda=(18,7)$, its conjugate is $\\lambda^*=(2^7, 1^{11})$. Since $\\lambda \\neq \\lambda^*$, they correspond to two distinct irreps with the same dimension.\nThe set of 26 partitions we found all have their first part $\\lambda_1 \\ge 18$. Their conjugates will all have a number of parts $\\ge 18$. None of the original 26 partitions have 18 or more parts. Therefore, the set of 26 partitions and the set of their conjugates are disjoint.\n\n**Self-Conjugate Partitions:**\nWhat about self-conjugate partitions? For a self-conjugate partition $\\lambda = \\lambda^*$, it would be counted only once. We need to check if any self-conjugate partitions have a dimension less than 500,000.\nThe self-conjugate partition of $n=25$ with the smallest possible dimension is the \"thinnest\" one, which is the hook shape $\\lambda=(13, 1^{12})$. Its dimension is $d_{(13,1^{12})} = \\binom{24}{12} = 2,704,156$, which is much larger than 500,000. Any other self-conjugate partition will be \"more central\" and have an even larger dimension.\nTherefore, no self-conjugate irreps have a dimension less than 500,000.\n\n**Final Count:**\nWe found 26 partitions. None are self-conjugate. Each corresponds to a distinct conjugate partition with the same dimension.\nSo, the total number of irreps is $26 \\times 2 = 52$.\n\nLet's list the counts:\n*   (25) and its conjugate (1^25): 2\n*   (24,1) and its conjugate: 2\n*   Partitions starting with 23 and their conjugates: 2 * 2 = 4\n*   Partitions starting with 22 and their conjugates: 3 * 2 = 6\n*   Partitions starting with 21 and their conjugates: 5 * 2 = 10\n*   Partitions starting with 20 and their conjugates: 7 * 2 = 14\n*   Partitions starting with 19 and their conjugates: 5 * 2 = 10\n*   Partitions starting with 18 and their conjugates: 2 * 2 = 4\n\nTotal = $2+2+4+6+10+14+10+4 = 52$.\n\n>>>52"
