    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and the Question\n\n*   **System:** A particle confined to a one-dimensional box.\n*   **Box Dimensions:** The box extends from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   **State of the Particle:** The particle is in the second energy level, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   **Objective:** Find the probability of locating this particle within a small interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the Relevant Quantum Mechanics Principles\n\n1.  **Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    `ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n    For the state `n = 2`, the wavefunction is:\n    `ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`\n\n2.  **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle per unit length at a position `x` is the probability density, `P(x)`, which is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    `P(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)`\n    For `n = 2`, this becomes:\n    `P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n\n3.  **Probability over an Interval:** To find the probability of the particle being in the interval `[x₁, x₂]`, we must integrate the probability density function over this interval:\n    `Probability = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx`\n\n### Step 3: Set up the Specific Integral\n\n*   **n = 2**\n*   **Interval:** `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`\n\nThe integral to be solved is:\n`Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Interval and Choose a Method\n\n*   The center of the interval is `(0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a = a/2`.\n*   The width of the interval is `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`.\n*   Let's check the value of the probability density at the center of the interval, `x = a/2`:\n    `P(a/2) = (2/a) * sin²(2π(a/2) / a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = (2/a) * (0)² = 0`\n*   This is a crucial point: the interval is centered on a **node**, a point where the probability of finding the particle is zero.\n*   Because the probability density is zero at the center, a simple approximation like `Probability ≈ P(center) * Δx` would incorrectly yield zero. The probability must be small, but not exactly zero. Therefore, we must perform the integration. Since the interval is very small, we can use an approximation that is valid for a function near a minimum.\n\n### Step 5: Solve the Problem using an Approximation\n\nSince the interval is small and centered around the node at `x = a/2`, we can simplify the calculation by making a substitution.\n\n1.  **Change of variables:** Let `y = x - a/2`. This shifts the origin to the center of the box.\n    When `x = 0.495a`, `y = 0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a`.\n    When `x = 0.505a`, `y = 0.505a - 0.5a = +0.005a`.\n    And `dx = dy`.\n\n2.  **Rewrite the integrand:** Substitute `x = y + a/2` into the `sin²` term:\n    `sin²(2πx / a) = sin²(2π(y + a/2) / a) = sin²(2πy/a + π)`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, we get:\n    `sin²(2πy/a + π) = [-sin(2πy/a)]² = sin²(2πy/a)`\n\n3.  **Approximate for a small angle:** The new integration variable `y` is small within the interval `[-0.005a, 0.005a]`. This means the argument of the sine function, `θ = 2πy/a`, is also small. We can use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    `sin²(2πy/a) ≈ (2πy/a)²`\n\n4.  **Set up and solve the approximate integral:**\n    `Probability ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * (2πy/a)² dy`\n    `Probability ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * (4π²y²/a²) dy`\n    `Probability ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] y² dy`\n\n5.  **Perform the integration:**\n    `∫ y² dy = y³/3`\n    `Probability ≈ (8π²/a³) * [y³/3]` evaluated from `-0.005a` to `0.005a`.\n    `Probability ≈ (8π²/(3a³)) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]`\n    `Probability ≈ (8π²/(3a³)) * [2 * (0.005a)³]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the final value:**\n    `Probability ≈ (16π²/(3a³)) * (0.005)³ * a³`\n    The `a³` terms cancel out.\n    `Probability ≈ (16π²/3) * (5 × 10⁻³)³`\n    `Probability ≈ (16π²/3) * (125 × 10⁻⁹)`\n    `Probability ≈ (2000π²/3) * 10⁻⁹`\n    `Probability ≈ (2π²/3) * 10⁻⁶`\n    Using `π ≈ 3.14159`, so `π² ≈ 9.8696`:\n    `Probability ≈ (2 * 9.8696 / 3) * 10⁻⁶`\n    `Probability ≈ 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶`\n\n### List of Careful Points\n1.  **Correct Wavefunction and State:** Always start with the correct normalized wavefunction `ψn(x)` for the given quantum number `n=2`.\n2.  **Probability Density:** Remember that probability is related to `|ψ|²`, not `ψ`.\n3.  **Node at the Center:** For `n=2`, the center of the box `x=a/2` is a node. This is a critical feature for this specific problem.\n4.  **Approximation Choice:** A simple approximation `P(center) * Δx` fails because `P(center)=0`. A more careful approximation, like a Taylor series or a small-angle approximation around the node, is required.\n5.  **Small Angle Approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`:** This is only valid for small angles `θ` measured in radians. The setup here makes it perfectly suited for this.\n6.  **Integration Limits:** When changing variables (e.g., from `x` to `y`), ensure the integration limits are also transformed correctly.\n7.  **Dimensionality:** The final probability should be a dimensionless number between 0 and 1. The cancellation of the box length `a` in the final step confirms the result is independent of the box size, as expected.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation: `(2 * π² / 3) * 10⁻⁶ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁶`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
