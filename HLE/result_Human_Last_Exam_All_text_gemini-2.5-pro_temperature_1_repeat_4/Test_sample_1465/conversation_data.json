    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\nThe oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acid residues at the core positions of the heptad repeat, denoted as `a` and `d` in the `(abcdefg)n` pattern. These positions pack against each other at the interface between the helices.\n\n### General Rules for Oligomerization:\n*   **Dimers (2-helices):** Often have a mixture of small and large hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions (e.g., `a`=Ile/Val, `d`=Ala/Leu). Polar residues like Asparagine (N) at the `a` position strongly favor dimers by forming specific inter-helix hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Trimers (3-helices):** Often have beta-branched residues (like Ile, Val, Thr) at both the `a` and `d` positions. This creates steric hindrance that is best accommodated in a trimeric arrangement. For example, `a`=Ile and `d`=Thr is a classic trimer-forming pattern.\n*   **Tetramers (4-helices):** Often have bulky hydrophobic residues at both `a` and `d` (e.g., `a`=Ile, `d`=Ile). Polar residues like Asparagine (N) or Glutamine (Q) in the core (especially at `d`) can also drive tetramer formation by creating a polar channel in the center.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Sequence:\n\n**1. Sequence: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **Heptad Repeat Assignment:** The most stable hydrophobic core is formed with the frame `(g) a b c d e f`. We can align the sequence starting from the second residue, `I`.\n    `I(a) A(b) Q/K/W(c) A(d) L(e) K(f) E(g)`\n*   **Core Positions:**\n    *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `d` positions: A, A, A, A (Alanine)\n*   **Analysis:** The `a=I, d=A` pattern is a canonical motif for a **dimeric (2-helix)** coiled-coil. The beta-branched Ile packs well against the small Ala in a dimer.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 2**\n\n**2. Sequence: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Repeat Assignment:** The repeating motif is `EIAALKx`. We use the frame `(g) a b c d e f`.\n    `I(a) A(b) A(c) L(d) K(e) Q/K(f) E(g)`\n*   **Core Positions:** The sequence contains a key substitution in the middle.\n    *   `a` positions: I, I, **N**, I (Isoleucine, with one Asparagine)\n    *   `d` positions: L, L, L, L (Leucine)\n*   **Analysis:** The base pattern is a leucine zipper (`d=L`). The presence of a polar Asparagine (N) at an `a` position is a very strong determinant for a parallel **dimer (2-helix)**, as it forms a stabilizing hydrogen bond across the dimeric interface.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 2**\n\n**3. Sequence: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Repeat Assignment:** The repeating motif is `EIAAIKx`. We use the frame `(g) a b c d e f`.\n    `I(a) A(b) A(c) I(d) K(e) Q/K/W(f) E(g)`\n*   **Core Positions:**\n    *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `d` positions: I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **Analysis:** Having the bulky, beta-branched Isoleucine at both the `a` and `d` positions creates significant steric strain in dimers or trimers. This `a=I, d=I` pattern is optimally packed in a **tetrameric (4-helix)** bundle.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 4**\n\n**4. Sequence: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **Heptad Repeat Assignment:** This sequence is ambiguous and allows for two possible frames.\n    *   **Frame 1:** `I(a) Q(b) K(c) Q(d) L(e) K(f) E(g)`. This yields `a=I` and `d=Q` (Glutamine). Polar `Q` at the `d` position is known to favor tetramers.\n    *   **Frame 2:** `Q(a) K(b) Q(c) L(d) K(e) E(f) I(g)`. This yields `a=Q` and `d=L` (Leucine). This frame places the canonical hydrophobic residue `L` consistently at the `d` position. Polar `Q` at the `a` position is known to stabilize dimers.\n*   **Analysis:** Given the answer choices, we must select the most likely intended structure. The `a=Q, d=L` pattern (Frame 2) is a known motif for forming a **dimeric (2-helix)** coiled-coil, stabilized by inter-chain hydrogen bonds between the `Q` residues. This provides a better explanation in the context of the available options.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 2**\n\n**5. Sequence: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **Heptad Repeat Assignment:** The repeating motif is `EIAxTLK`. We use the frame `(g) a b c d e f`.\n    `I(a) A(b) Q/K/W(c) T(d) L(e) K(f) E(g)`\n*   **Core Positions:**\n    *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `d` positions: T, T, T, T (Threonine)\n*   **Analysis:** Both Isoleucine and Threonine are beta-branched amino acids. Placing them at both the `a` and `d` core positions generates steric clash that is most effectively relieved in a **trimeric (3-helix)** arrangement.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 3**\n\n### Final Compilation:\n1.  Sequence 1: Dimer (2)\n2.  Sequence 2: Dimer (2)\n3.  Sequence 3: Tetramer (4)\n4.  Sequence 4: Dimer (2)\n5.  Sequence 5: Trimer (3)\n\nThe resulting sequence of oligomeric states is **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**. This corresponds to answer choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
