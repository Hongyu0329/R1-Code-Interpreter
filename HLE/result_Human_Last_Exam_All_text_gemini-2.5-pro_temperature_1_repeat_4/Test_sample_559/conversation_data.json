    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the system.\n\n**1. Identify the System and Equilibrium Points**\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{dt} = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u) $$\n$$ \\frac{du}{dt} = u^2(u-1) $$\nWe are interested in the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are found by setting both derivatives to zero.\nFrom $\\frac{du}{dt} = 0$, we have $u^2(u-1) = 0$, which gives $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $\\frac{dd}{dt}=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (5(0)^2 - 3(0))d - 0^3(1-0) = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $\\frac{dd}{dt}=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1-1) = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nSo, the equilibrium points in the half-plane $u \\geq 0$ are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**2. Classify the Equilibrium Points**\n\nTo understand the structure of the phase portrait, we classify these points using linearization. The Jacobian matrix of the system is:\n$$ J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(u^3-u^2) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial d}(u^3-u^2) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(2d^2 + \\dots) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial d}(2d^2 + \\dots) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u - 3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10(1) - 3)(0) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, **(1, 0) is an unstable node (a source)**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10(1) - 3)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7 - 3 + 4 & -4 + 5 - 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=-2$. Since they have opposite signs, **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The linearization is inconclusive. This is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point.\n\n**3. Identify the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. Separatrices are formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. Our system has a saddle point at (1, -1), so its stable and unstable manifolds will form the separatrix.\n\nLet's look for an invariant algebraic curve of the form $d=f(u)$ that passes through the saddle point. If a curve is invariant, a trajectory starting on it will stay on it for all time. The equation for an invariant curve must satisfy the relation derived from the chain rule: $\\frac{dd}{dt} = \\frac{df}{du} \\frac{du}{dt}$.\n$$ \\frac{df}{du} \\cdot [u^2(u-1)] = 2(f(u))^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)f(u) - u^3(1-u) $$\n\nLet's test a simple polynomial curve passing through the saddle point (1, -1). Consider the parabola $d = -u^2$.\n*   It passes through (1, -1) because $-1 = -(1)^2$.\n*   It also passes through the equilibrium point (0, 0).\n\nLet's check if $d = -u^2$ is an invariant curve.\nThe left hand side (LHS) of the condition is:\nLHS $= \\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) \\cdot [u^2(u-1)] = (-2u) \\cdot [u^2(u-1)] = -2u^3(u-1)$.\n\nThe right hand side (RHS) is found by substituting $d=-u^2$ into the expression for $\\frac{dd}{dt}$:\nRHS $= 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4$\n$= (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$\n$= -2u^4 + 2u^3 = 2u^3(1-u) = -2u^3(u-1)$.\n\nSince LHS = RHS, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\n**4. Confirm the Manifold's Identity**\n\nThis invariant curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the saddle point (1, -1). Therefore, it must be either the stable or unstable manifold (or a union of parts of them).\n*   The eigenvalues at the saddle (1,-1) are $\\lambda_1=1$ (unstable) and $\\lambda_2=-2$ (stable).\n*   The eigenvector for the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The slope of the unstable manifold at the saddle is therefore $dd/du = -2/1 = -2$.\n*   The slope of our curve $d=-u^2$ at $u=1$ is $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2)\\big|_{u=1} = -2u\\big|_{u=1} = -2$.\n\nSince the curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the saddle point and its slope matches the slope of the unstable manifold, we conclude that the curve **$d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1)**.\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point is a classic example of a separatrix because it forms a boundary separating trajectories with different long-term behavior.\n\nThe equation of the separatrix is $d = -u^2$, which can be rewritten as $d + u^2 = 0$."
