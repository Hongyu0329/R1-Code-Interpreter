    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific year when an individual, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\".\n\n**Step 2: Verify the individual's full name.**\nThe first and most crucial step is to confirm the full, legal name of the former Nigerian President. His full name is **Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the premise of the question.**\nThe question is phrased in a way that suggests \"Azikiwe\" was a name he adopted or started using at a specific point in time, separate from his commonly known name, \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\".\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the premise based on the verified name.**\nSince \"Azikiwe\" is part of his birth name, he has legally and officially been \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" his entire life. It is not a nickname or an adopted name. He did not need to start identifying with it at a later date; it has always been his name.\n\n**Step 5: Consider what \"publicly identify\" means in this context.**\nA person's full name is used on all official documents, such as birth certificates, school records, passports, and electoral forms. When he entered public life, his full name would have been registered and made public.\n*   **1999:** Became Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State.\n*   **2007:** Became Vice President of Nigeria.\n*   **2010:** Became President of Nigeria.\nIn all these instances, his official documentation would have listed his full name, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. Therefore, he has been \"publicly identified\" by his full name throughout his political career.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Common Usage vs. Official Name:** In media and common conversation, people are often referred to by a shortened version of their name for brevity. For instance, Barack Obama's full name is Barack Hussein Obama, but he was rarely called by his full name. Similarly, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan was most often called \"Goodluck Jonathan\". This common shortening does not mean he ever stopped being \"Azikiwe\".\n2.  **No \"Adoption\" Event:** The question implies an event, like a press conference or a formal declaration, where he \"revealed\" or \"adopted\" the name Azikiwe. There is no historical record of such an event because none was necessary. It has always been his name.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The question is based on a false premise. There is no specific year where he began to identify as Azikiwe because it has always been part of his identity and legal name since birth.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, there is no single year that answers the question as it is framed. The most accurate response is to state that this event never occurred because \"Azikiwe\" has always been part of his name.\n\n<<<There is no record of a specific year when Goodluck Ebele Jonathan began to publicly identify himself as Azikiwe, because \"Azikiwe\" is part of his given name at birth (Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan), not a name he adopted later in life."
