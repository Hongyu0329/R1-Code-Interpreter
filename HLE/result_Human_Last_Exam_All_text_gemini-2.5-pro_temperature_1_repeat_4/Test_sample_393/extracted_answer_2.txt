Let the partition of $n$ be given by the multiset of sizes $A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_r\}$. Let $S = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m\}$ be the set of distinct sizes in $A$, and for each $s_j \in S$, let $k_j$ be its multiplicity (the number of times $s_j$ appears in $A$). The number of Tverberg's partitions of $X$ is given by the formula: $\frac{n!}{\left(\prod_{i=1}^r a_i!\right) \left(\prod_{j=1}^m k_j!\right)}$
