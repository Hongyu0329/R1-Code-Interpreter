    "This problem asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) of spaces that are simultaneously homogeneous, planar, and continua.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstructing the Definitions**\n\nFirst, let's clarify the terms used in the question:\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, and connected metric space.\n*   **Planar Continuum:** A continuum that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means there exists a subspace of $R^2$ that is homeomorphic to the continuum.\n*   **Homogeneous Space:** A topological space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a homeomorphism $h: X \\to X$ such that $h(x) = y$. Intuitively, the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A collection of all topological spaces that are homeomorphic to each other. The question asks for the number of these collections that satisfy the given properties.\n\n### **Step 2: Splitting the Problem into Degenerate and Non-Degenerate Cases**\n\nA continuum can either be a single point (degenerate) or contain more than one point (non-degenerate). It is crucial to analyze both cases to provide a complete answer.\n\n#### **Careful Point 1: The Degenerate Case**\n\nWe must consider if a single point qualifies as a homogeneous planar continuum.\n*   Let $X = \\{p\\}$ be a single-point space.\n*   **Continuum?** Yes. It is non-empty, compact (any finite space is compact), and connected (it cannot be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint open sets).\n*   **Planar?** Yes. It is a subspace of the plane.\n*   **Homogeneous?** Yes, trivially. The only two points to consider are $x=p$ and $y=p$. The identity map $h(p) = p$ is a homeomorphism, satisfying the condition.\n*   All single-point spaces are homeomorphic to each other. Therefore, the degenerate case contributes exactly **one** homeomorphism class.\n\n#### **Careful Point 2: The Non-Degenerate Case**\n\nFor continua with more than one point, we rely on a major classification theorem in topology.\n\n*   **The Classification Theorem:** A profound result by R. H. Bing, F. Burton Jones, James T. Rogers, Jr., and others provides a complete classification of all non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua. The theorem states that any such continuum must be homeomorphic to one of exactly three specific spaces.\n\n### **Step 3: Listing and Analyzing the Non-Degenerate Classes**\n\nThe three non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua identified by the classification theorem are:\n\n1.  **The Circle ($S^1$):**\n    *   **Description:** The familiar simple closed curve.\n    *   **Properties:** It is a continuum and is planar. It is homogeneous because any point can be mapped to any other point via a rotation, which is a homeomorphism of the circle onto itself.\n\n2.  **The Pseudo-arc:**\n    *   **Description:** A pathological but fascinating one-dimensional continuum. It is chainable (can be approximated by chains of open sets) and is both indecomposable (cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua) and hereditarily indecomposable (all of its non-degenerate subcontinua are also indecomposable).\n    *   **Properties:** The pseudo-arc is known to be a planar continuum. A highly non-trivial result by Bing showed that it is also homogeneous.\n\n3.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:**\n    *   **Description:** This continuum is constructed by \"replacing\" each point of a circle with a pseudo-arc in a continuous fashion. It can be formally defined as an inverse limit or a continuous decomposition of a space like a solid torus.\n    *   **Properties:** It is a planar continuum, and it is also homogeneous.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Classes are Distinct**\n\nTo count the number of homeomorphism classes, we must ensure that these three spaces are not homeomorphic to each other. We can distinguish them using topological invariants (properties preserved under homeomorphism).\n\n*   **Circle vs. The Other Two:** The circle is **locally connected**. The pseudo-arc and the circle of pseudo-arcs are famously **not locally connected** at any point. Therefore, the circle is in a distinct homeomorphism class from the other two.\n*   **Pseudo-arc vs. Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** The pseudo-arc is **indecomposable**. The circle of pseudo-arcs, however, is **decomposable** (for example, it can be expressed as the union of two \"semicircles of pseudo-arcs,\" which are proper subcontinua). Therefore, the pseudo-arc and the circle of pseudo-arcs are not homeomorphic.\n\nThis confirms that there are exactly **three** distinct homeomorphism classes of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nWe sum the number of classes from our analysis:\n*   Number of degenerate classes: 1 (the point)\n*   Number of non-degenerate classes: 3 (the circle, the pseudo-arc, the circle of pseudo-arcs)\n\nTotal number of homeomorphism classes = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nFinal Answer: There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua. They are the point, the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs.\n\n<<<4>>>"
