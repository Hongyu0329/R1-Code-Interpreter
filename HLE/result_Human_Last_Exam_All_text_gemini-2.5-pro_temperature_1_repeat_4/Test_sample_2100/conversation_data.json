    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** The man is described by the poet Andrei Voznesensky as \"a joy-discovering sailor.\" This poetic phrase suggests an explorer or someone associated with sea voyages whose story has a significant emotional or positive element.\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** Voznesensky's line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" clearly indicates that at the time the poem was written, the burial place of this man was unknown or lost.\n3.  **Analyze the third clue:** The answer to the question about the grave's location \"emerged in the late 1980s.\" This is a crucial time-specific detail, pointing to a historical or archaeological discovery during that period.\n4.  **Synthesize the clues:** The task is to identify a famous historical figure, likely a Russian (given the poet), associated with sailing, whose lost grave was rediscovered in the late 1980s.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   The connection to Andrei Voznesensky is key. He was a very famous poet, and his works often referenced significant cultural or historical figures. The most famous work he created involving a historical \"sailor\" is the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n*   The phrase \"joy-discovering\" is metaphorical. It likely refers to the famous love story associated with this man's journey rather than a geographical discovery of \"joy.\"\n*   The loss and subsequent rediscovery of a grave is a very specific historical event that narrows down the possibilities considerably.\n\n**Acquiring the final answer with step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  The quotes provided are from Andrei Voznesensky's poem \"Saga,\" which forms part of the libretto for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n2.  The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian statesman, diplomat, and explorer Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n3.  Rezanov's story fits the description of a \"sailor.\" He led an expedition on the ships Juno and Avos to Russian America and then to Spanish California in the early 1800s.\n4.  The \"joy\" he discovered is a reference to his famous romance with Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of San Francisco. This love story is the central theme of the rock opera.\n5.  On his return journey across Siberia, Rezanov fell ill and died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807. He was buried at the Voskresensky Cathedral.\n6.  In the 1930s, the Soviet government demolished the cathedral, and the exact location of Rezanov's grave was lost. This perfectly explains Voznesensky's line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n7.  In the late 1970s and with more public attention in the late 1980s (during Perestroika), the supposed location of Rezanov's grave was rediscovered by local historians in a park in Krasnoyarsk. A memorial was erected on the site. This event matches the clue that the \"answer... emerged in the late 1980s.\"\n8.  Therefore, the man described in the question is Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
