    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **\"HIS work\"**: We are looking for a specific, well-known work attributed to a male figure (\"HE\").\n*   **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: The key passage is located at the conclusion of this work.\n*   **\"separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\"**: This passage is a rule or law concerning coveting, envy, or theft of things belonging to others.\n*   **\"prohibition against representation\"**: This is a crucial clue. It refers to aniconism, the religious prohibition against making images or likenesses of living beings or deities. This is a central tenet in Judaism and Islam.\n*   **\"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: This is the most specific part. The rule about material possessions is phrased in a way that seems to bypass or contradict the rule against making images.\n*   **\"Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: This points to a specific scholar whose analysis explains this apparent contradiction.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Clues to a Specific Text**\n\n*   The combination of a list of fundamental laws, a \"prohibition against representation,\" and a final law about coveting strongly points to the **Ten Commandments** (the Decalogue) from the Hebrew Bible.\n*   The \"prohibition against representation\" is the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth...\"\n*   The law \"at the end\" that addresses \"another's material possessions\" is the Tenth Commandment: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.\"\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Interpretation**\n\n*   According to Veronika Campan's analysis, there is a tension between these two commandments.\n*   The Second Commandment forbids making a \"likeness of anything.\"\n*   However, the Tenth Commandment, in order to be understood, requires the listener to form a mental picture or *representation* of the very things it lists: a house, a wife, a servant, an ox, a donkey.\n*   Therefore, in the act of commanding against covetousness, the text \"naturally ignore[s]\" the aniconic principle of the Second Commandment by forcing the audience to visualize—to mentally represent—the forbidden objects of desire.\n\n**Step 4: Identify \"HE\"**\n\n*   The historical and religious figure who, according to the biblical narrative, received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai and delivered them to the people of Israel is **Moses**. He is considered the lawgiver and the central figure associated with this work (the Torah, which contains the commandments).\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The work is the Ten Commandments. The figure who delivered them is Moses. Veronika Campan's interpretation explains the specific relationship between the Second and Tenth Commandments described in the prompt. Therefore, \"HE\" is Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
