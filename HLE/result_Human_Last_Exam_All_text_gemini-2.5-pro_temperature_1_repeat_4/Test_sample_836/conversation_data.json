    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial Function: The Generalized Pair Correlation Function**\n    *   In the context of nuclear criticality and reactor physics, the system under study is the neutron population within a medium.\n    *   The \"generalized pair correlation function\" refers to the correlation in the detection of neutrons (or neutron-induced events like fissions) at two different points in space-time.\n    *   Mathematically, it is the covariance of the neutron density, $n(\\mathbf{r},t)$. It is denoted as $C(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$ and defined as:\n        $C(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2) = \\langle \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1) \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}_2, t_2) \\rangle$\n        where $\\delta n(\\mathbf{r}, t) = n(\\mathbf{r}, t) - \\langle n(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\rangle$ is the fluctuation of the neutron density around its mean value $\\langle n(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\rangle$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This function is fundamental to all neutron noise analysis techniques, as it describes the statistical fluctuations from which system parameters (like reactivity) are inferred. For systems that are stationary in time and homogeneous in space, this function only depends on the separations $\\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$ and $\\Delta \\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Mathematical Operation: The Space-Time Double Fourier Transform**\n    *   The question specifies a Fourier transform with respect to both the spatial variable ($\\Delta \\mathbf{r}$) and the temporal variable ($\\Delta t$).\n    *   The spatial variable $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}$ is transformed into its conjugate variable, the wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$.\n    *   The temporal variable $\\Delta t$ is transformed into its conjugate variable, the angular frequency $\\omega$.\n    *   The transform is given by the integral:\n        $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d(\\Delta t) \\int_{V} d^3(\\Delta \\mathbf{r}) \\, C(\\Delta \\mathbf{r}, \\Delta t) \\, e^{-i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{r} - \\omega \\Delta t)}$\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to distinguish this from the more common experimental quantity, the Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD), which is typically a Fourier transform over the time variable *only*. The CPSD is a function of frequency and the two detector positions, $CPSD(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\omega)$, not of the single wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Name of the Resulting Function**\n    *   The resulting function, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, represents the spectral density of the neutron population fluctuations as a function of both spatial mode (wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$) and frequency ($\\omega$).\n    *   This exact mathematical entity—the double Fourier transform of the pair correlation function—has a standard name in statistical physics, particularly in the study of liquids, solids, and plasmas using neutron scattering.\n    *   This name has been adopted by the theoretical nuclear reactor physics and criticality community to describe the same quantity for the neutron gas in a reactor.\n    *   The common name for $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$ is the **Dynamic Structure Factor**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While terms like \"Noise Spectrum\" or \"Power Spectral Density\" are used in the field, \"Dynamic Structure Factor\" is the most precise and formal name for the specific quantity resulting from a *double* space-time Fourier transform. It directly links the study of neutron fluctuations in a reactor to the broader field of statistical mechanics.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function of the neutron population is commonly called the **Dynamic Structure Factor** in the nuclear criticality and theoretical reactor physics community.\n\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"
