    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume for squarefree natural numbers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**\n    *   **Squarefree natural numbers (N):** This specifies the context. We are dealing with number fields constructed from squarefree integers $N > 1$. The most natural choice is the set of real quadratic fields $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$.\n    *   **Covolume (V):** In the context of number fields, this refers to the volume of the fundamental domain of a lattice formed by the ring of integers. For a number field $K$, we consider its ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The Minkowski embedding $\\sigma: K \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ maps $\\mathcal{O}_K$ to a lattice $\\Lambda = \\sigma(\\mathcal{O}_K)$. The covolume of this lattice is $V = \\text{covol}(\\Lambda) = \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$, where $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the field $K$.\n        *   For a real quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$, the degree is $n=2$, and the Minkowski embedding maps $x \\in K$ to $(\\sigma_1(x), \\sigma_2(x)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, where $\\sigma_1(x)$ and $\\sigma_2(x)$ are the two real embeddings (the identity and the conjugation map).\n        *   The discriminant $\\Delta_K$ is $N$ if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $4N$ if $N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n        *   Therefore, the covolume is $V = \\sqrt{N}$ if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $V = \\sqrt{4N} = 2\\sqrt{N}$ if $N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n    *   **Maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$):** This notation, while not universally standard, is best interpreted in the context of the geometry of numbers as one of the successive minima of the lattice $\\Lambda$. The subscript '$\\infty$' points towards the $L_\\infty$ (maximum) norm on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, defined as $\\|(x,y)\\|_\\infty = \\max(|x|, |y|)$. The term \"maximum norm\" suggests the largest of the successive minima. For a 2-dimensional lattice, this is the second successive minimum, denoted $\\lambda_{2,\\infty}$.\n\n2.  **Define Successive Minima**\n    The successive minima of a lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ with respect to the $L_\\infty$ norm are:\n    *   $\\lambda_{1,\\infty} = \\min \\{ \\|v\\|_\\infty \\mid v \\in \\Lambda, v \\neq 0 \\}$. This is the norm of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice.\n    *   $\\lambda_{2,\\infty} = \\min \\{ t \\mid \\text{the lattice vectors in the square } [-t,t]^2 \\text{ span } \\mathbb{R}^2 \\}$. This is the smallest value $t$ such that there exist two linearly independent lattice vectors with $L_\\infty$ norm at most $t$.\n\n3.  **Find an Upper Bound for $\\lambda_{2,\\infty}$**\n    We can find an upper bound for $\\lambda_{2,\\infty}$ by considering a specific basis for the lattice $\\Lambda = \\sigma(\\mathcal{O}_K)$. An integral basis for the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is given by $\\{1, \\omega_K\\}$, where:\n    *   $\\omega_K = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}$ if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n    *   $\\omega_K = \\sqrt{N}$ if $N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n\n    The images of this basis under the Minkowski embedding, $v_1 = \\sigma(1)$ and $v_2 = \\sigma(\\omega_K)$, form a basis for the lattice $\\Lambda$. Since these two vectors are linearly independent, the second successive minimum $\\lambda_{2,\\infty}$ must be less than or equal to the maximum of their norms.\n    $\\lambda_{2,\\infty} \\le \\max(\\|v_1\\|_\\infty, \\|v_2\\|_\\infty)$.\n\n4.  **Analyze by Case (based on N mod 4)**\n\n    *   **Case A: $N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$**\n        *   An integral basis is $\\{1, \\sqrt{N}\\}$.\n        *   $v_1 = \\sigma(1) = (1, 1)$, so $\\|v_1\\|_\\infty = 1$.\n        *   $v_2 = \\sigma(\\sqrt{N}) = (\\sqrt{N}, -\\sqrt{N})$, so $\\|v_2\\|_\\infty = \\sqrt{N}$.\n        *   The bound is $\\lambda_{2,\\infty} \\le \\max(1, \\sqrt{N}) = \\sqrt{N}$ (since $N \\ge 2$).\n        *   In this case, the covolume is $V = 2\\sqrt{N}$, which means $\\sqrt{N} = V/2$.\n        *   So, we get the upper bound: $\\lambda_{2,\\infty} \\le V/2$.\n\n    *   **Case B: $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$**\n        *   An integral basis is $\\{1, \\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}\\}$.\n        *   $v_1 = \\sigma(1) = (1, 1)$, so $\\|v_1\\|_\\infty = 1$.\n        *   $v_2 = \\sigma(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}) = (\\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}, \\frac{1-\\sqrt{N}}{2})$, so $\\|v_2\\|_\\infty = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}$.\n        *   The bound is $\\lambda_{2,\\infty} \\le \\max(1, \\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}$ (since $N \\ge 5$).\n        *   In this case, the covolume is $V = \\sqrt{N}$.\n        *   So, we get the upper bound: $\\lambda_{2,\\infty} \\le \\frac{1+V}{2}$.\n\n5.  **Unify the Bounds and Determine the Supremum**\n    We need a single expression in terms of $V$ that is valid for all squarefree $N$. We have two bounds: $\\lambda_{2,\\infty} \\le V/2$ and $\\lambda_{2,\\infty} \\le (1+V)/2$.\n    Since $V/2 < (1+V)/2$ for any positive $V$, the expression $f(V) = (1+V)/2$ serves as a valid upper bound for both cases.\n\n    To confirm this is the best possible upper bound (i.e., the supremum), we must check if this bound is ever attained.\n    Consider the case $N=5$. Here $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n    *   $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$. The covolume is $V = \\sqrt{5}$.\n    *   The upper bound is $\\frac{1+V}{2} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n    *   The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}]$.\n    *   The first successive minimum is $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}=1$, given by the vector $\\sigma(1)=(1,1)$.\n    *   The second successive minimum $\\lambda_{2,\\infty}$ can be shown to be exactly $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, which is the norm of the vector $\\sigma(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})$.\n    *   Since the bound $\\lambda_{2,\\infty} \\le (1+V)/2$ is achieved for $N=5$, it is the sharpest possible upper bound that is a function of $V$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe relationship between the maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$, interpreted as $\\lambda_{2,\\infty}$) and the covolume ($V$) is given by the inequality:\n$k_{k,\\infty} \\le \\frac{1+V}{2}$\n\nThis is the best possible upper bound that is expressed as a function of $V$.\n\n<<< (1+V)/2 >>>"
