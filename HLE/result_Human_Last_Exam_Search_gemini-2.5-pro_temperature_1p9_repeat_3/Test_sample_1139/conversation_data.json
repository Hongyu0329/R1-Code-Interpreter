    "For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the supersymmetric sigma-model provides a powerful theoretical framework. When studying higher moments of transport properties, it becomes necessary to use a version of the model with multiple replicas. For the specific case of two replicas (n=2), the target space of the sigma-model is a symmetric superspace designated as SpO(4,R|4)/U(2|2).\n\nThe variables used to parametrize this space can be divided into standard commuting numbers (bosonic or non-Grassmann variables) and anti-commuting Grassmann numbers (fermionic variables). The question asks for the number of non-Grassmann variables needed for the bosonic sector. This corresponds to the dimension of the purely bosonic submanifold of the target space.\n\nThe bosonic submanifold is given by the coset of the maximal bosonic subgroups, which is (Sp(4,R) × O(4)) / (U(2) × U(2)). The number of variables required to parametrize this space is its dimension, calculated as the difference between the dimension of the group in the numerator and the group in the denominator.\n\nThe dimensions of the relevant Lie groups are:\n*   dim(Sp(4,R)) = 10\n*   dim(O(4)) = 6\n*   dim(U(2)) = 4\n\nThe dimension of the bosonic sector is therefore (10 + 6) - (4 + 4) = 8.\n\nThis can also be understood by considering the block structure of the model's Q-matrix. The non-Grassmann variables parametrize the Bose-Bose (BB) and Fermi-Fermi (FF) blocks. For the n=2 model in class D, the BB sector is the space Sp(4,R)/U(2) and the FF sector is O(4)/U(2).\n*   The dimension of the BB sector is dim(Sp(4,R)) - dim(U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6.\n*   The dimension of the FF sector is dim(O(4)) - dim(U(2)) = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nThe total number of non-Grassmann variables is the sum of these dimensions, 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
