    "In the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q128, there are a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q128 is defined by the presentation:\nQ128 = < a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ >\n\nA power subgroup is a subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in the group for some integer k. The distinct power subgroups of Q128 are as follows:\n\n1.  **Q128 itself**: For any odd integer k, the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements is the entire group Q128.\n2.  **A cyclic subgroup of order 32**: This subgroup is generated by a², and it is the power subgroup for k=2 and other even k where gcd(k, 64) = 2.\n3.  **A cyclic subgroup of order 16**: Generated by a⁴, this is the power subgroup for k=4 and other even k where gcd(k, 64) = 4.\n4.  **A cyclic subgroup of order 8**: Generated by a⁸, this is the power subgroup for k=8 and other even k where gcd(k, 64) = 8.\n5.  **A cyclic subgroup of order 4**: Generated by a¹⁶, this is the power subgroup for k=16 and other even k where gcd(k, 64) = 16.\n6.  **A cyclic subgroup of order 2**: Generated by a³², which is the center of the group, Z(Q128). This is the power subgroup for k=32 and other even k where gcd(k, 64) = 32.\n7.  **The trivial subgroup**: Containing only the identity element, this is the power subgroup for k being any multiple of 64.\n\nThus, there are 1 non-cyclic and 6 cyclic power subgroups, making a total of 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
