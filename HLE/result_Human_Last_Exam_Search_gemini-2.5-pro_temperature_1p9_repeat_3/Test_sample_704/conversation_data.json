    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the combination of yellow and blue produces the color green. Newton associated this color wheel with a musical scale, specifically the Dorian mode starting on D.\n\nNewton's division of the visible spectrum resulted in seven colors, which he aligned with the seven notes of the musical scale. The correspondence is as follows:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   Green - G\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C.\n\nThe range between green and blue on this circle corresponds to the musical note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
