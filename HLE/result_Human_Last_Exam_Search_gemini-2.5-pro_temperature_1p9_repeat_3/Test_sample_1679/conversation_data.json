    "### \"The Life of Emile Zola\" First Best Picture Winner to Feature Luxor Obelisk\n\nThe 1937 film \"The Life of Emile Zola\" was the first Academy Award winner for Best Picture to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The film, a biographical picture about the famed French writer, includes a scene with a view of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, where one of the two Luxor Obelisks has stood since 1836.\n\nThe movie, starring Paul Muni in the titular role, is set primarily in Paris and depicts Zola's life and his involvement in the Dreyfus affair. A stock footage description related to the film explicitly mentions a pan shot of the Place de la Concorde, the public square that is home to the iconic Egyptian monument.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners have also featured Parisian landmarks, \"The Life of Emile Zola\" predates them. For instance, the 1951 Best Picture winner, \"An American in Paris,\" famously features a lavish studio set recreation of the Place de la Concorde. The set for this Gene Kelly musical was inspired by the real location, complete with its fountains.\n\nAnother notable Best Picture winner set partly in Paris, \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956), also features scenes in the French capital. However, many of the European sequences in this film were filmed on studio sets, and there is no evidence to suggest it depicts the Luxor Obelisk.\n\nThe two Luxor Obelisks were originally erected at the Luxor Temple in Egypt. In the 1830s, one of the obelisks was transported to Paris and erected in the Place de la Concorde, where it remains a prominent landmark. The other obelisk remains at the Luxor Temple in Egypt. Searches for Best Picture-winning films shot in Luxor have not revealed any that predate \"The Life of Emile Zola.\"\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
