    "A power subgroup, denoted as $G^k$, of a group $G$ is the subgroup generated by the set of all $k$-th powers of the elements in $G$. Formally, $G^k = \\langle \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\} \\rangle$. To find the number of distinct power subgroups of the semidihedral group of size 512, we first need to understand its structure and the nature of its power subgroups.\n\n### 1. The Semidihedral Group $SD_{512}$\n\nThe semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, has the following presentation:\n$SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs^{-1} = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor a size of 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which implies $n=9$. Therefore, we are considering the group $SD_{512}$ with the presentation:\n$SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$\nThe elements of this group are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$ and $r^i s$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\n\n### 2. Determining the Power Subgroups\n\nWe need to determine the set of distinct subgroups $\\{G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We can analyze the exponent $k$ by considering two cases: when $k$ is odd and when $k$ is even.\n\n#### Case 1: $k$ is an odd number.\nLet $k$ be an odd integer.\nFor any element $g$ in a finite group $G$, if the order of $g$ is coprime to $k$, then the cyclic subgroup generated by $g$, $\\langle g \\rangle$, is the same as the one generated by $g^k$, $\\langle g^k \\rangle$. Since $SD_{512}$ is a 2-group, the order of every element is a power of 2. Any odd number $k$ is coprime to any power of 2. Thus, for any element $g \\in SD_{512}$, $\\langle g \\rangle = \\langle g^k \\rangle$. This implies that the set of elements $\\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ generates the entire group $G$. Therefore, for any odd $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is the group $G$ itself.\nSo, all odd values of $k$ yield one power subgroup: $G^1 = SD_{512}$.\n\n#### Case 2: $k$ is an even number.\nAny even number $k$ can be written as $k=2^m \\cdot q$, where $m \\ge 1$ and $q$ is odd. The power subgroup $G^k$ is then $G^{2^m q} = (G^{2^m})^q$. As we established for odd exponents, raising a 2-group or any of its subgroups to an odd power $q$ does not change the generated subgroup. Thus, $(G^{2^m})^q = G^{2^m}$.\nThis means we only need to identify the distinct subgroups for exponents that are powers of 2, i.e., $G^{2^m}$ for $m \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's compute $G^2$:\nThe elements of $G$ are $r^i$ and $r^i s$. Their squares are:\n*   $(r^i)^2 = r^{2i}$\n*   $(r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (srs) r^{i-1} s = r^i (r^{127}) r^{i-1} s = r^{i+127} s r^{i-1} s$. A more direct calculation is $(r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s^{-1}s^2 = r^i (sr^i s^{-1}) = r^i (srs^{-1})^i = r^i(r^{127})^i = r^{i(1+127)} = r^{128i}$.\n\nThe set of all squares of elements in $G$ is $\\{r^{2i}\\} \\cup \\{r^{128i}\\}$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\nThe subgroup $G^2$ is generated by these elements: $G^2 = \\langle \\{r^{2i}\\} \\cup \\{r^{128i}\\} \\rangle$.\nThe subgroup generated by $\\{r^{2i}\\}$ is $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$. The subgroup generated by $\\{r^{128i}\\}$ is $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$.\nSince $128$ is a multiple of $2$, $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\nTherefore, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n\nNow, we can find the subsequent power subgroups for higher powers of 2:\n*   $G^4 = (G^2)^2 = \\langle (r^2)^2 \\rangle = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$.\n*   $G^8 = (G^4)^2 = \\langle (r^4)^2 \\rangle = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$.\n\nIn general, for $m \\ge 1$, we have:\n$G^{2^m} = \\langle r^{2^m} \\rangle$.\n\nThese subgroups form a chain of strictly nested cyclic subgroups:\n$\\langle r^2 \\rangle \\supset \\langle r^4 \\rangle \\supset \\langle r^8 \\rangle \\supset \\dots$\n\nThe order of $\\langle r \\rangle$ is 256. The order of $\\langle r^{2^m} \\rangle$ is $256 / \\gcd(2^m, 256) = 256/2^m = 2^{8-m}$ for $m \\le 8$.\nThis chain of subgroups continues until the subgroup becomes the trivial group $\\{e\\}$.\n*   $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (order 128)\n*   $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$ (order 64)\n*   $G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n*   $G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$ (order 16)\n*   $G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$ (order 8)\n*   $G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n*   $G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n*   $G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{e\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\nThese are 8 distinct subgroups.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe set of all distinct power subgroups of $SD_{512}$ consists of the subgroups generated by odd powers and the subgroups generated by even powers.\n1.  The subgroup from any odd power $k$: $G^k = SD_{512}$.\n2.  The 8 distinct subgroups from powers of two: $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\{e\\}$.\n\nCombining these, we have a total of $1 + 8 = 9$ distinct power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
