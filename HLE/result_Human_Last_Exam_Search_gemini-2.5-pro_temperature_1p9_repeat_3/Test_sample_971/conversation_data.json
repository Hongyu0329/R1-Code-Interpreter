    "I am unable to determine the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008.\n\nExtensive searches were conducted to locate a video of this specific performance. While it is documented that Osipova, as a member of the Bolshoi Ballet, performed the role of Kitri as a guest artist in Novosibirsk, Siberia in 2008, all identified video links of the Act I variation from this performance are unfortunately no longer active.\n\nMentions of her 2008 performances in other contexts were found, including a performance of the Bridesmaid variation from *Don Quixote* and a portrayal of Dulcinea from the same ballet, but these are different choreographic sequences from the specified Kitri's Act I variation. Without a visual record of the 2008 performance as Kitri, it is impossible to provide an accurate count of the pirouettes in question. Other available videos of Osipova dancing this role are from different years and productions, and choreographic details can vary between performances.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer.>>>"
