    "If a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose goes through glycolysis, **zero** ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules will be released.\n\nGlycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. This process does not produce or release any carbon dioxide (CO₂). All six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are present in the two pyruvate molecules at the end of glycolysis.\n\nThe release of carbon dioxide occurs in subsequent stages of cellular respiration. Specifically, CO₂ is released during pyruvate oxidation (also known as the link reaction or pyruvate decarboxylation) and the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle).\n\nTo elaborate on the fate of the labeled carbons beyond glycolysis:\n*   The 1,4-¹³C glucose would produce two pyruvate molecules. One pyruvate would be labeled at the carboxyl-carbon position (derived from carbon 4 of glucose), and the other would be labeled at the methyl-carbon position (derived from carbon 1 of glucose).\n*   In the next step, pyruvate oxidation, the carboxyl group of pyruvate is removed and released as CO₂. Therefore, the pyruvate molecule with the label at the carboxyl position (from glucose's carbon 4) would release one molecule of ¹³CO₂. The other pyruvate molecule's carboxyl group is unlabeled, so it would release an unlabeled CO₂ molecule.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the process of glycolysis, during which no CO₂ is released.\n\n<<<0>>>"
