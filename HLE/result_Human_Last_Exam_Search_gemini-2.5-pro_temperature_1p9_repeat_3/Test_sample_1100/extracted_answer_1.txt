The "bean salad" diet is important because it is likely rich in fava beans (*Vicia faba*) or velvet beans (*Mucuna pruriens*), which are natural sources of L-DOPA. L-DOPA is a precursor to dopamine. The diet serves as a natural substitute for the withdrawn dopamine agonist medication, helping to control the patient's hyperprolactinemia by increasing dopamine levels, which in turn suppress prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland.
