    "### No Lectures Cited in Einstein's 1905 Brownian Motion Paper\n\nIn his seminal 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures. In fact, the paper is notable for its lack of any citations or a list of references to contemporary scientific literature.\n\nEinstein's approach in this and his other groundbreaking papers of 1905 was to build his arguments from fundamental principles rather than a detailed engagement with the existing literature of the time. This was also the case for his famous paper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies, which introduced the special theory of relativity and was also published without a bibliography.\n\nWhile Einstein attended the Zurich Polytechnic Institute (now ETH Zurich) from 1896 to 1900, historical accounts suggest he was often dissatisfied with the curriculum. He frequently skipped lectures, including those of his physics professors Heinrich Weber and Jean Pernet, and preferred to immerse himself in the works of physicists like James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann, Hermann von Helmholtz, and Gustav Kirchhoff through independent study. His primary influences for the Brownian motion paper are considered to be his work on the kinetic theory of heat and statistical mechanics.\n\nTherefore, the direct answer to the question of whose lectures he cited is that he cited no one's. His revolutionary work was presented on its own theoretical footing.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
