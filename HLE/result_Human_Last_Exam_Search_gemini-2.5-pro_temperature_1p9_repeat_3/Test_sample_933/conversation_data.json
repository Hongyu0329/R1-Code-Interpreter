    "The most efficient and commonly cited method for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) involves the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gases. This reaction is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio within a nickel container.\n\nAccording to multiple scientific sources, the optimal temperature for this reaction is 400°C. This temperature is part of a range between 350°C and 450°C that is effective for the production of XeF4. While other xenon fluorides can be formed under different conditions—Xenon difluoride (XeF2) is favored at lower temperatures and Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) at higher temperatures and excess fluorine—400°C is the established temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride. A flow method for producing XeF4 also utilizes a temperature range of 300-500°C, although this can lead to contamination with XeF2.\n\nConsidering the provided options, 400°C is the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
