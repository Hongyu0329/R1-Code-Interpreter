    "I have determined that toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, meaning it consists of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms. I have also started to research the 6-31G basis set. I need to find the specific number of contracted Gaussian functions that the 6-31G basis set assigns to each carbon and each hydrogen atom. Once I have this information, I can calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire toluene molecule. My next step will be to find this specific information about the 6-31G basis set composition for C and H.I have successfully determined that toluene's chemical formula is C7H8. My research on the 6-31G basis set indicates that for each hydrogen atom, there are two contracted Gaussian functions (one for the 1s orbital, split into two functions). For each carbon atom (a second-period element), there is one function for the 1s core orbital and four for the valence orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz), with each of these five being split into two, resulting in 5 * 2 = 10 functions. However, the search results suggest that s and p functions are grouped, which might affect the total count. Some sources state that a second-period atom like carbon has 5 basis functions in a minimal set (1s, 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) and that a split-valence basis like 6-31G has two functions for each of these, implying 10 functions. Yet other results mention 9 basis functions for carbon and 2 for hydrogen in a similar context. I need to clarify the exact number of contracted functions for carbon in the 6-31G basis set.I have successfully determined that toluene has the chemical formula C7H8. I have also found information about how the 6-31G basis set is constructed. For a hydrogen atom, its 1s orbital is represented by two contracted Gaussian functions. For a carbon atom, which is a second-row element, the 6-31G basis set uses one contracted function for the core 1s orbital, and for the valence shell (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz), it uses a split-valence approach with two sets of functions (an inner and an outer). One set consists of s and p functions, and the other also consists of s and p functions. Specifically, for carbon, there is one contracted function for the core electrons (1s), and for the valence electrons (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz), there are two functions for each, resulting in 1 (core) + 4 * 2 (valence) = 9 contracted functions per carbon atom. This is supported by multiple sources that state that the 6-31G basis set assigns 9 basis functions to each carbon atom and 2 to each hydrogen atom. I am now ready to perform the final calculation.\n\n(7 atoms of Carbon * 9 contracted Gaussian functions/Carbon) + (8 atoms of Hydrogen * 2 contracted Gaussian functions/Hydrogen)\n= 63 + 16\n= 79\nToluene (C7H8) is a molecule composed of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms. In a 6-31G basis set calculation, the number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom type needs to be determined to find the total for the molecule.\n\nThe 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. For hydrogen, its single 1s orbital is represented by two contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nFor a second-row atom like carbon, the 6-31G basis set uses one contracted function for the inner-shell (core) 1s orbital. The valence shell, consisting of the 2s and three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz), is \"split\" into two sets of functions, an inner and an outer. This results in one s-type and three p-type contracted functions for the inner valence region, and another s-type and three p-type functions for the outer valence region. This gives a total of 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted Gaussian functions for each carbon atom. Several sources confirm that the 6-31G basis set assigns 9 basis functions to each carbon atom and 2 to each hydrogen atom.\n\nTherefore, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene can be calculated as follows:\n\n*   **For the 7 carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **For the 8 hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total contracted Gaussian functions:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\n<<<79>>>"
