    "### Free-standing Boron Nanosheets and Spontaneous Parametric Down-conversion: A Promising yet Uncharted Territory\n\n**While theoretically plausible for certain phases, there is currently no direct experimental evidence or specific theoretical prediction confirming that free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light.** However, the fundamental requirements for this quantum optical phenomenon appear to be met in some of the diverse structures of borophene, making it an intriguing candidate for future exploration.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process where a photon from a pump laser interacts with a nonlinear material and is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons, traditionally called the signal and idler photons. A critical prerequisite for a material to exhibit second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC is a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure—a structure that lacks a point of inversion symmetry.\n\nBorophene, the two-dimensional allotrope of boron, exists in a variety of structural phases, known as polymorphs. While many of these phases are metallic, several stable or metastable forms of free-standing borophene have been predicted and, in some cases, experimentally realized. Crucially, some of these phases are predicted to possess the necessary non-centrosymmetric structure.\n\nFor instance, theoretical studies have shown that multilayer δ6-borophene is non-centrosymmetric and, as a result, should exhibit a non-zero first dipole hyperpolarizability, which is a measure of a material's second-order nonlinear optical response. Furthermore, experimental work on free-standing borophene nanosheets has confirmed their non-centrosymmetric nature. This inherent asymmetry is a key factor that opens the door to second-order nonlinear phenomena.\n\nThe investigation of SPDC in 2D materials is a burgeoning field of research. These atomically thin materials are considered promising platforms for quantum optics because the phase-matching conditions required for SPDC are more relaxed compared to bulk crystals. This relaxation could lead to the generation of entangled photon pairs over a broad spectrum. Recent studies have even shown that excitonic effects in some 2D crystals can enhance the probability of SPDC.\n\nDespite these promising fundamentals, the nonlinear optical properties of borophene are still largely unexplored, with most studies focusing on its electronic, mechanical, and third-order nonlinear optical properties. There is a notable absence of research that explicitly models or experimentally searches for SPDC or even its sister process, second-harmonic generation (SHG), in free-standing borophene. While some borophene structures are predicted to be semiconducting, many are metallic, which could hinder SPDC efficiency due to high optical absorption and screening effects from free charge carriers. Functionalization of borophene, for example with hydrogen or oxygen, has been shown to open up a bandgap, which could be beneficial for optical applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the non-centrosymmetric nature of certain borophene phases makes them theoretically capable of exhibiting spontaneous parametric down-conversion. However, without direct experimental observation or specific theoretical models that calculate the efficiency and phase-matching conditions for SPDC in these nanosheets, the expectation of this phenomenon remains speculative. The field awaits further research to bridge the gap between fundamental properties and the realization of borophene-based quantum light sources.\n\n<<<While theoretically possible for specific non-centrosymmetric phases, there is currently no direct experimental or theoretical evidence to definitively expect spontaneous parametric down-conversion from free-standing boron nanosheets.>>>"
