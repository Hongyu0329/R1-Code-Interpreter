The measure for a Grassmann variable integral is defined by the Berezin integration rules: \( \int d\theta = 0 \) and \( \int d\theta \, \theta = 1 \). The Pauli exclusion principle is maintained because Grassmann variables anti-commute (\( \theta_i \theta_j = -\theta_j \theta_i \)), which implies that the square of any Grassmann variable is zero (\( \theta^2 = 0 \)). This algebraic property directly translates to the impossibility of two fermions occupying the same state.
