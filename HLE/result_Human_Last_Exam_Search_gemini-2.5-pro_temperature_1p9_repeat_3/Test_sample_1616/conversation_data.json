    "Trisyllabic laxing, also known as trisyllabic shortening, is a sound change in English where a tense (or long) vowel becomes lax (or short) when it is in the third-to-last syllable of a word. An analysis of the provided words reveals their phonological development in relation to this rule.\n\nHere is an examination of each word:\n*   **Derivative:** This word demonstrates classic trisyllabic laxing. The base word, \"derive\" (/dɪˈraɪv/), has a tense diphthong [aɪ]. When the \"-ative\" suffix is added, the vowel is now in the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable and becomes the lax vowel [ɪ] in \"derivative\" /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/.\n*   **Serenity:** This is also a clear example of the rule. The word comes from \"serene\" (/səˈriːn/), which has a tense vowel [iː]. In \"serenity\" (/səˈrɛnəti/), this vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable and changes to the lax vowel [ɛ].\n*   **Gratitude:** The vowel in \"gratitude\" (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/) is lax [æ]. This laxing is apparent when compared to the related word \"grateful\" (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/), which preserves the tense vowel [eɪ]. The addition of the suffix alters the syllable count and triggers the shortening.\n*   **Southern:** The word \"southern\" (/ˈsʌðərn/) shows a vowel change when compared to its root \"south\" (/saʊθ/). This change from the diphthong [aʊ] to the lax vowel [ʌ] is sometimes cited as an example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **Shadow:** The word \"shadow\" is disyllabic (having two syllables). The vowel change from the tense [eɪ] in \"shade\" to the lax [æ] in \"shadow\" is a different kind of vowel shortening, not caused by the trisyllabic environment.\n*   **Pleasant:** \"Pleasant\" is also a two-syllable word. Therefore, it cannot undergo *trisyllabic* laxing, which requires a word to have at least three syllables for the rule to apply. The related word \"please\" features a tense vowel, but the change to a lax vowel in \"pleasant\" is due to other historical shortening processes.\n\nBoth *pleasant* and *shadow* are two-syllable words and thus could not have undergone laxing caused by a trisyllabic structure.\n\n<<<pleasant, shadow>>>"
