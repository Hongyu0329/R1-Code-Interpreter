The critical amount of correlation, defined as the average covariance (`c`) between neurons of the input populations `v` and `s`, required to balance potentiation and depression is `c = Î¼/N`. At this value, the competitive and cooperative effects of the plasticity rule are perfectly balanced, representing the threshold for the development of synaptic selectivity.
