    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the specific heat C of a system near its critical point is described by the scaling relation C ∝ |t|⁻ᵃ, where α is the critical exponent for the specific heat and t is the reduced temperature. The epsilon (ϵ) expansion is a powerful technique used to calculate critical exponents in a perturbative series around the upper critical dimension, d_c.\n\nFor a system with a scalar order parameter, belonging to the Ising universality class (described by the O(N) model with N=1), the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. The epsilon expansion is performed in terms of the parameter ϵ = d_c - d. Given the spatial dimension d=3, we have ϵ = 1.\n\nThe critical exponent α can be expressed as a series in ϵ. To the first order in ϵ, the formula for α for the O(N) model is:\n\nα = (4 - N) / (2 * (N + 8)) * ϵ\n\nThis formula can be derived using the hyperscaling relation α = 2 - νd, where ν is the critical exponent for the correlation length and d is the spatial dimension.\n\nFor the system in question, we substitute N=1 (for the Ising universality class) and ϵ=1 into the first-order expansion:\n\nα ≈ (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) * 1\nα ≈ 3 / (2 * 9)\nα = 3 / 18\nα = 1/6\n\nThus, to the leading order in the epsilon expansion, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a three-dimensional system is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
