    "I have gathered some initial definitions.\n- The connectivity of a map f: X -> Y is defined by the connectivity of its homotopy fiber Ff. Specifically, f is n-connected if Ff is (n-1)-connected, meaning the homotopy groups of Ff are trivial up to degree n-1.\n- The smash product of two spheres S^m and S^n is S^(m+n).\n- The loop space functor Ω is right adjoint to the suspension functor Σ.\n- The connectivity of a space X is the largest integer n such that all homotopy groups of X up to n are trivial.\n- The connectivity of ΩX is one less than the connectivity of X, and the connectivity of ΣX is one more than the connectivity of X.\n\nThe key to solving this problem seems to be the Hilton-Milnor theorem, which provides a splitting of Ω(X ∨ Y). I have found a result that gives a splitting for Ω(X ∨ Y) as ΩX × ΩY × ΩΣ(ΩX ∧ ΩY). This appears highly relevant.\n\nI need to find out how the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is induced. The prompt states it is \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\". This is the part that is still unclear. I will search for the Hilton-Milnor theorem and its relation to maps of homotopy fibers. I will also search for the connectivity of smash products of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, as ΩS^n is related to K(Z, n-1).I've gathered significant information, particularly regarding the Hilton-Milnor theorem and connectivity properties.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what I know:\n\n*   **Hilton-Milnor Theorem:** This theorem provides a homotopy equivalence for the loop space of a wedge of suspensions. A more general version by Milnor applies to a wedge of connected CW-complexes. The key formula for my problem is the decomposition of the loop space of a wedge sum: $\\Omega(X \\vee Y) \\simeq \\Omega X \\times \\Omega Y \\times \\Omega \\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y)$.\n*   **Connectivity of smash products of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces:** I found that for $K(A,p)$ and $K(B,q)$, their smash product $K(A,p) \\wedge K(B,q)$ is $(p+q-1)$-connected. Since $\\Omega S^n$ is a $K(\\mathbb{Z}, n-1)$ space, this is directly applicable.\n*   **Connectivity of a map:** A map $f: X \\to Y$ is $k$-connected if its homotopy fiber $F_f$ is $(k-1)$-connected, meaning $\\pi_i(F_f) = 0$ for $i \\le k-1$. This is equivalent to saying that $f_* : \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$ is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n*   The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" likely refers to a map arising from a natural construction or a universal property, in this case, the Hilton-Milnor fibration.\n\nHere's the path to the solution:\n\n1.  I will use the specific case of the Hilton-Milnor theorem for the wedge of two spheres, $S^4 \\vee S^6$. This gives a homotopy equivalence for $\\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6)$.\n2.  I need to identify the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ within the context of the Hilton-Milnor theorem. The theorem provides a fibration, and this map will be related to one of the maps in that fibration sequence.\n3.  I will then determine the connectivity of this map by analyzing the connectivity of its homotopy fiber. The Hilton-Milnor decomposition itself will reveal the fiber.\n4.  I will calculate the connectivity of the relevant spaces. Specifically, I'll need the connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is a $K(\\mathbb{Z}, 3)$, so it is 2-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is a $K(\\mathbb{Z}, 5)$, so it is 4-connected.\n    *   The smash product $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is therefore $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n5.  With the connectivity of the fiber known, I can determine the connectivity of the map in question.\n\nI believe I have a clear path forward and don't need additional searches at this time. I will now proceed with the argument.\n\nAn important result in homotopy theory is the Hilton-Milnor theorem, which provides a homotopy decomposition of the loop space of a wedge of suspensions. For two spheres, $S^m$ and $S^n$, the loop space of their wedge sum, $\\Omega(S^m \\vee S^n)$, can be described as the total space of a fibration.\n\nThe Hilton-Milnor theorem gives a homotopy equivalence:\n\n$\\Omega(S^m \\vee S^n) \\simeq \\Omega S^m \\times \\Omega S^n \\times \\Omega \\Sigma (\\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n)$\n\nThis equivalence arises from a tower of fibrations. The map in question, $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, is a key component of this structure. Specifically, it is the map that completes the fibration sequence involving the product of the individual loop spaces. The associated homotopy fibration is:\n\n$\\Omega \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6) \\to \\Omega S^4 \\times \\Omega S^6$\n\nThe map we are interested in is the composition of the inclusion of the fiber with the looping of the canonical map from the smash product to the wedge sum. The connectivity of this map is determined by the connectivity of its homotopy fiber. From the Hilton-Milnor decomposition, the homotopy fiber of the map from the total space $\\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6)$ to the base space $\\Omega S^4 \\times \\Omega S^6$ is precisely $\\Omega \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Therefore, the map of interest, up to homotopy, is the inclusion of the fiber.\n\nA map is defined as being k-connected if its homotopy fiber is (k-1)-connected. In this case, the map itself is a loop space, and its connectivity is determined by the connectivity of its domain, which acts as the fiber.\n\nWe need to determine the connectivity of the space $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. To do this, we first determine the connectivity of the spaces involved:\n\n*   The loop space of a sphere, $\\Omega S^n$, is a $K(\\mathbb{Z}, n-1)$ space. Thus, its first non-trivial homotopy group is in dimension $n-1$.\n*   $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected (first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_3$).\n*   $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected (first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_5$).\n\nFor the smash product of two connected CW complexes X and Y, with conn(X) = p and conn(Y) = q, the connectivity of their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is at least $p + q + 1$.\n\n*   The connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is therefore at least $2 + 4 + 1 = 7$.\n\nThe suspension functor, $\\Sigma$, increases the connectivity of a space by one.\n\n*   The connectivity of $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is therefore at least $7 + 1 = 8$.\n\nFinally, the looping functor, $\\Omega$, decreases the connectivity by one. So the space in the question, being a loop space, has its connectivity determined by the delooped space.\n\nThe map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is (up to homotopy) the inclusion of the fiber in the Hilton-Milnor fibration. The connectivity of an inclusion map is the connectivity of the domain plus one. The connectivity of the space $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is 8. Therefore, the map has connectivity $8+1=9$.\n\nThe question asks for the connectivity of the map, which is given by the connectivity of its homotopy fiber plus one. In the context of the Hilton-Milnor fibration, the map from the fiber to the total space is being considered. The connectivity of this map relates to how the homotopy groups of the fiber are mapped to the homotopy groups of the total space.  The connectivity of the space $\\Omega \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $8-1=7$. The map is 8-connected. The first non-trivial homotopy group of the fiber $\\Omega \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is in dimension 8. This means the map induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups up to dimension 7 and a surjection in dimension 8. Thus, the map is 8-connected.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the connectivity.\nconn($\\Omega S^4$) = 3-1=2\nconn($\\Omega S^6$) = 5-1=4\nconn($\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$) $\\geq$ 2+4+1=7\nconn($\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$) $\\geq$ 7+1 = 8\nconn($\\Omega\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$) $\\geq$ 8-1 = 7.\nThe homotopy fiber of the map in question is contractible, the map is a weak equivalence.\n\nThe map in question is the inclusion of the fiber in the Hilton-Milnor fibration, $\\Omega \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6)$. A map $f: A \\to B$ is k-connected if its homotopy fiber is (k-1)-connected. The homotopy fiber of an inclusion of a fiber F into a total space E is the loop space of the base, $\\Omega B$. Here, the fiber is $F = \\Omega\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, the total space is $E = \\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6)$, and the base space is $B = \\Omega S^4 \\times \\Omega S^6$.\nThe fiber of the map $F \\to E$ is the fiber of the map $E \\to B$, which is again $F$. The question asks for the connectivity of the map whose domain is $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and codomain is $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, not $\\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6)$. This suggests a different context.\n\nHowever, there is a natural map $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Sigma\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6 = S^{10}$. Taking loops gives a map $\\Omega\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Omega S^{10}$. The connectivity of $\\Omega\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is 7. The connectivity of $\\Omega S^{10}$ is 8.\nThe Freudenthal suspension theorem implies that the map $X \\to \\Omega\\Sigma X$ is $(2 \\cdot \\text{conn}(X)+1)$-connected. Let $X = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$, which is 7-connected. The map $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(2 \\cdot 7 + 1) = 15$-connected. The space $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected. The space $\\Omega\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is also 7-connected. The map is a weak equivalence in a range.\n\nLet's re-read the question carefully: `What is the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ induced by a map of homotopy fibers?` The codomain is $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, which is $\\Omega S^{10}$.\nThe connectivity of the domain $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is 8.\nThe connectivity of the codomain $\\Omega S^{10}$ is 8.\nWe have a map between two 8-connected spaces.\nLet's analyze the lowest dimensional non-trivial homotopy group.\n$\\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) = \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ by Hurewicz theorem.\n$H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = H_8(K(\\mathbb{Z},3) \\wedge K(\\mathbb{Z},5))$. Since $H_3(K(\\mathbb{Z},3)) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_5(K(\\mathbb{Z},5)) = \\mathbb{Z}$, the Künneth formula for smash products gives $H_{3+5}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$. So $\\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$\\pi_9(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe map on $\\pi_9$ is likely an isomorphism. To determine the connectivity, we would need to understand the map on higher homotopy groups or have more information about how it is \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\". Without this crucial piece of information, a definitive answer is difficult.\n\nLet's assume the map is the natural one arising from the James construction.\nThe map $\\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$ is not standard. A related map is part of the Hilton-Milnor theorem: $\\Omega \\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\vee Y)$.\nLet's consider the adjoint map $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Omega S^{10}$. This map factors through the James construction on $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$. The space $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $K(\\mathbb{Z},3) \\wedge K(\\mathbb{Z},5)$. As established, this is a $(3+5-1)=7$-connected space. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_8$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}$. This space is a $K(\\mathbb{Z}, 8)$ up to dimension 13.\nThe space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is an 8-connected space. The map is between a 7-connected space and an 8-connected space, so the map is at least 7-connected. To go further, we need the specific definition of the map. If it is induced by the identity on the lowest homotopy group, then the connectivity is 8.\n\nThe map in question, $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Omega S^{10}$ is highly connected.\nThe space $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, with $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\nBy the Freudenthal suspension theorem, the suspension map $\\Sigma: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_{k+1}(\\Sigma X)$ is an isomorphism for $k < 2 \\cdot \\text{conn}(X)+1$.\nHere, $X = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected. The suspension is an isomorphism for $k < 15$.\nSo $\\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe target space is $\\Omega S^{10}$, and $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe map between these two groups of rank $\\mathbb{Z}$ is likely an isomorphism. To find the first non-trivial group in the fiber, one must compare the higher homotopy groups. Given the context of academic-level homotopy theory questions, the answer is often related to the stable range.\n\nThe connectivity of the map is 8.\n\nFinal Answer: The connectivity of the space $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is 8. The connectivity of the space $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Omega S^{10}$ is also 8. The map between them, induced naturally from the inclusions, is an isomorphism on the first non-trivial homotopy group, $\\pi_9$. The connectivity of the map would then be determined by the first dimension in which the map is not an isomorphism. Without a precise definition of the map, it's impossible to proceed, but a common type of question would imply this map is an equivalence in a certain range. Given the spaces, the map is at least 8-connected. Let's assume the question implies the map is the canonical one derived from the composition $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Sigma(\\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6)) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6)$ is not right.\n\nThe map is 8-connected.\n\n<<<8>>>"
