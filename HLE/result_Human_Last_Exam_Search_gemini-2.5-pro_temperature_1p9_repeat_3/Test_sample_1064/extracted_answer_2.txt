**Answer:**
The expected chain quality `Q` depends on the adversary's mining power `β`.

*   **If `β ≥ 1/2`**:
    The adversary's lead over the honest miners will, on average, grow indefinitely. Consequently, any blocks found by honest miners will eventually be orphaned. The main chain will consist solely of blocks published by the adversary.
    Therefore, the chain quality is **0**.

*   **If `β < 1/2`**:
    The system reaches a stationary distribution, and the expected chain quality `Q` is given by the formula:
    `Q = ( (1-2β)(1-β)[1 + β(1-β)(2-p)] ) / ( 1 - β - 2β² + β³ )`

    where:
    *   `β` is the adversary's portion of the mining power.
    *   `p` is the probability that honest miners choose the adversary's block in a tie-breaking situation.
