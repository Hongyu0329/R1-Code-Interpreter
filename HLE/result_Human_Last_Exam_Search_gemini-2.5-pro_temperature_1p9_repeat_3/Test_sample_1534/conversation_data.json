    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions situated immediately posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThese structures are all components of a larger brain division known as the posterior subesophageal mass. The palliovisceral lobe is involved in controlling escape movements and the expulsion of ink. The posterior chromatophore lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores (color-changing cells) and papillae on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass, which are essential for the cuttlefish's remarkable camouflage and communication displays. The fin lobes are tasked with controlling the movements of the fins.\n\nThe entire brain, including these posterior lobes, is enclosed and protected on its posterior side by a rigid structure made of cartilage. Visualizations from the 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish confirm the posterior and somewhat dorsal-lateral positioning of the posterior chromatophore and fin lobes relative to the palliovisceral lobe.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
