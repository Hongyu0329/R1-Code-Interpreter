In summary: While initial data processing may use a coordinate system aligned with the (mostly radial) solar wind flow, a proper physical calculation of the normalized magnetic helicity of AIC waves requires transforming the data into a coordinate system aligned with the local magnetic field. The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial, but follows the Parker spiral. Your physical expectation is correct; the analysis is done using the magnetic components perpendicular to the local magnetic field, not necessarily the radial direction.
