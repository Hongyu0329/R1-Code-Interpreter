    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in a refluxing ether solvent like THF is a multistep process involving nucleophilic substitution on an aromatic ring. Given that phenyl magnesium bromide is a strong nucleophile and the starting material is a polyhalogenated benzene, a series of substitution reactions will occur.\n\n**Reaction Analysis:**\n\nThe reactivity of halogens on an aryl ring towards Grignard reagents generally follows the order of their leaving group ability: I > Br > Cl. This means the iodine atom will be substituted first, followed by the bromine atoms. The reaction is performed under reflux, providing the necessary energy for the substitutions to proceed to completion, especially since an excess of the Grignard reagent is used.\n\n1.  **First Substitution:** The most reactive site is the carbon atom bonded to iodine. The phenyl group from phenyl magnesium bromide will replace the iodine atom.\n    *   Starting Material: 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene\n    *   Intermediate 1: 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene\n\n2.  **Second Substitution:** The resulting product, 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene, still contains two bromine atoms. Since excess phenyl magnesium bromide is present, the reaction will continue. The two bromine atoms are in equivalent positions (meta to the newly added phenyl group). A second phenyl group will replace one of the bromine atoms.\n    *   Intermediate 2: 3-bromo-1,2-diphenylbenzene (or 1-bromo-2,3-diphenylbenzene)\n\n3.  **Third Substitution:** Finally, the last remaining bromine atom will be substituted by another phenyl group from the excess Grignard reagent.\n    *   Final Organic Product: 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene\n\nThe aqueous work-up serves to quench any remaining Grignard reagent and protonate any intermediates, yielding the final stable organic product.\n\n**IUPAC Name of the Product:**\n\nThe final product is a benzene ring substituted with three phenyl groups at positions 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, the IUPAC name is **1,2,3-triphenylbenzene**. This compound is a solid with a melting point of 157-159 Â°C.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
