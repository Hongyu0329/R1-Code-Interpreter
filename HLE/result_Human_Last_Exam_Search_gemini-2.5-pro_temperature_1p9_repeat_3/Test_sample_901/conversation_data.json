    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide results in the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThis reaction is an E2 elimination, a process where a hydrogen and a leaving group (in this case, bromine) are removed from adjacent carbons to form a double bond. The specifics of this reaction are determined by the stereochemistry of the starting material and the nature of the reagents.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reaction mechanism:\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane has the bromine and methyl groups in a *trans* configuration, meaning they are on opposite sides of the cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) is a strong, bulky base. Strong bases favor the one-step E2 mechanism over the two-step E1 mechanism.\n*   **Stereochemical Requirement:** The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The hydrogen to be removed and the leaving group (bromine) must be in a *trans-diaxial* and *anti-periplanar* orientation. This means both groups must be in axial positions, with one pointing up and the other down.\n*   **Conformational Analysis:** Cyclohexane and its derivatives exist primarily in rapidly interconverting chair conformations.\n    *   The more stable chair conformation for the *trans* starting material has both the bulky bromine and methyl groups in equatorial positions. However, in this conformation, the bromine is not axial, so the E2 reaction cannot occur.\n    *   For the reaction to proceed, the molecule must flip into its less stable chair conformation, where both the bromine and the methyl group are in axial positions.\n*   **Product Determination:** Once the bromine is in an axial position, the base will abstract a beta-hydrogen that is also in an axial position.\n    *   The hydrogen on the carbon with the methyl group (C2) is in an equatorial position, so it cannot be removed. Therefore, the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene), which would be the more substituted and typically more stable alkene, cannot be formed.\n    *   The hydrogen on the other adjacent carbon (C6) does have an axial orientation that is *anti-periplanar* to the axial bromine.\n    *   The base abstracts this axial hydrogen from C6, and the elimination occurs to form a double bond between C1 and C6. This product is named **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nTherefore, due to the strict stereoelectronic requirements of the E2 mechanism, the reaction is regioselective and forms 3-methylcyclohexene, which is the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product), instead of the more substituted Zaitsev product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
