    "I have been unable to find a working video of Svetlana Gileva's performance in the Jete Woman solo from the Forsythe production \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for Semperoper Ballett in 2015. While I have found multiple references to this performance and a YouTube link that is now inactive, without being able to view the solo, it is impossible to determine the exact number of \"pas de Balanchine\" (a colloquial term for a specific type of grand pas de chat, or large leap) she performed.\n\nReviews of the Semperoper Ballett's performances of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" from around that time praise Svetlana Gileva's interpretation of the role, but they do not provide a detailed choreographic breakdown of the number of specific steps. Therefore, a definitive count cannot be provided.\n\n<<<Unable to provide a definitive answer.>>>"
