    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community. It is often denoted as S(k, ω) or S(q, ω).\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, which describes the probability of finding a particle at a certain position and time given that another particle was at the origin at time zero, is more specifically known as the Van Hove correlation function, G(r, t). The dynamic structure factor, S(k, ω), is the double Fourier transform of this Van Hove function, with 'k' (or 'q') representing the wave vector (related to the spatial component) and 'ω' representing the angular frequency (related to the temporal component).\n\nThis relationship is fundamental in the analysis of neutron scattering, a key experimental technique in nuclear science. The measured intensity of inelastically scattered neutrons is directly proportional to the dynamic structure factor, providing experimental access to the microscopic structure and dynamics of the material being studied.\n\nIn the context of nuclear reactor physics and criticality safety, this concept is also referred to as the **thermal scattering law**, S(α, β). The variables α and β are dimensionless parameters related to the momentum and energy transfer of the neutron, respectively, and are proportional to q² and ω.\n\nTherefore, both \"dynamic structure factor\" and \"thermal scattering law\" are used to refer to the same fundamental quantity, which is the double Fourier transform of the time-dependent pair correlation function.\n\n<<<Dynamic structure factor>>>"
