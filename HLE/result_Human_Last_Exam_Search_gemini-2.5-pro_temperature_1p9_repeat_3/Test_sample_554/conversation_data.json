    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 20 fluorine atoms on its chassis. This is based on the structure of the original single-molecule nanocar developed by the Tour group at Rice University.\n\nThe structure of this nanocar consists of two main parts: an \"H-shaped\" chassis and four fullerene wheels. Perfluorination is a chemical process where hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nThe components of the nanocar are as follows:\n*   **Wheels**: The wheels are Buckminsterfullerene spheres (C₆₀). These are composed entirely of carbon and have no hydrogen atoms, so no fluorine atoms would be added to them.\n*   **Chassis**: The chassis is an oligo(phenylene ethynylene) structure. Analyzing its specific \"H\" shape reveals:\n    *   A central 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (the \"bridge\" of the H), which has 4 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Four outer 1,4-disubstituted benzene rings that act as spokes for the wheels, each having 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\nTo create a perfluoronanocar, all the hydrogen atoms on the chassis would be replaced with fluorine atoms. The total count is therefore the sum of all hydrogens on the constituent rings: 4 hydrogens from the central ring plus 16 hydrogens from the four outer rings (4 x 4), totaling 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
