    "Let $G$ be a graph with $n = 12345$ vertices. The chromatic number of a graph, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The question asks for the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ given that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n\nA complete graph $K_n$ is a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The chromatic number of a complete graph with $n$ vertices is $n$, because all vertices are adjacent to each other and must therefore all receive a different color. So, for $K_{12345}$, the chromatic number is 12345.\n\nThe problem states that $G$ is **not** the complete graph $K_{12345}$. If a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is not complete, it means there is at least one pair of vertices that are not connected by an edge. Let's call these two non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$. Because they are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color. This means we can color the graph with at most $n-1$ colors (for example, by giving $u$ and $v$ the same color, and every other vertex a unique color). Therefore, the chromatic number of a non-complete graph on $n$ vertices can be at most $n-1$.\n\nFor our specific case, this means $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nTo determine if this maximum is achievable, we need to see if there exists a non-complete graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that requires 12344 colors. Consider the graph formed by taking a complete graph on 12344 vertices, $K_{12344}$, and adding a single, isolated vertex.\n*   This graph has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n*   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertices.\n*   The subgraph $K_{12344}$ requires 12344 colors to be properly colored. The isolated vertex can be colored with any of these colors.\n*   Therefore, the chromatic number of this graph is 12344.\n\nThis construction demonstrates that a non-complete graph on 12345 vertices can have a chromatic number of 12344. Since we have established that the chromatic number cannot exceed 12344, this is the maximum possible value.\n\nAnother way to consider this is with Brooks' Theorem, which states that for a connected graph $G$, the chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In the case of a non-complete graph, this theorem also leads to the same conclusion after analyzing the possible maximum degrees and graph structures.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
