    "The Oscar-nominated film where a character's fate is sealed by a seemingly innocuous gesture is **Inglourious Basterds**. However, the specific detail of the character saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is not accurate.\n\nIn a tense scene in a basement tavern, British officer Lieutenant Archie Hicox (played by Michael Fassbender), who is posing as a German, gives himself away. His true identity is revealed not by something he says, but by a hand gesture. When ordering three drinks, he uses the British manner of counting with his index, middle, and ring fingers, rather than the German method of using the thumb, index, and middle fingers. This seemingly small error confirms the suspicions of a Gestapo officer, leading to a deadly confrontation that seals his and his companions' fates.\n\nThe pivotal scene does not take place on a bus, but in a tavern, and the character's downfall is a result of a non-verbal cue, not the phrase \"Thank you.\"\n\n<<<Inglourious Basterds>>>"
