    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions (specifically in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions), the behavior of the system at criticality is governed by the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. The leading order expression for the coupling constant, u*, at this fixed point can be determined through a perturbative renormalization group analysis.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling u, which describes how the coupling changes with the length scale, is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + Bu²\n\nwhere B is a constant that depends on the normalization of the coupling and the field. The non-trivial fixed point, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, is found by setting the beta function to zero (β(u*) = 0) and solving for u*:\n\n-ϵu* + B(u*)² = 0\n\nThis yields the non-trivial solution:\n\nu* = ϵ / B\n\nThe constant B is typically found to be 3 in the literature, which arises from the combinatorics and integration of the one-loop Feynman diagram for the four-point function. This leads to the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling:\n\nu* = ϵ / 3\n\nIt is important to note that the value of the constant B, and therefore the precise expression for u*, can vary depending on the specific conventions used in the renormalization procedure. However, the proportionality to ϵ is a universal feature at the leading order in the epsilon expansion.\n\n<<<u* = ϵ / 3>>>"
