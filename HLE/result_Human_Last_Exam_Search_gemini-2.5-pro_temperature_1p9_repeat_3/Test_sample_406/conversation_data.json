The existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point for the mappings F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × Z × X → Y, and H: Z × X × Y → Z is guaranteed if the following conditions are met:\n\n**1. Mixed Monotone Property:**\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property. This means that the functions are monotone (either non-decreasing or non-increasing) in each of their arguments. A typical set of mixed monotone properties is as follows:\n\n*   **F** is non-decreasing in its first argument, non-increasing in its second, and non-decreasing in its third. That is, for any x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n    *   x₁ ≤<sub>X</sub> x₂ ⇒ F(x₁, y, z) ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x₂, y, z)\n    *   y₁ ≤<sub>Y</sub> y₂ ⇒ F(x, y₁, z) ≥<sub>X</sub> F(x, y₂, z)\n    *   z₁ ≤<sub>Z</sub> z₂ ⇒ F(x, y, z₁) ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x, y, z₂)\n\n*   **G** is non-decreasing in its first argument, non-increasing in its second, and non-decreasing in its third.

Contractive Condition:**\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive condition. This is a condition that ensures that the distances between the images of points under these functions are smaller than the distances between the original points. A common form of this condition is:\n\nFor all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z with x ≥<sub>X</sub> u, y ≤<sub>Y</sub> v, and z ≥<sub>Z</sub> w, there exist constants k₁, k₂, k₃, l₁, l₂, l₃, m₁, m₂, m₃ ∈ [0, 1) such that:\n\n*   d<sub>X</sub>(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ k₁d<sub>X</sub>(x, u) + k₂d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v) + k₃d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w)\n*   d<sub>Y</sub>(G(y, z, x), G(v, w, u)) ≤ l₁d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v) + l₂d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w) + l₃d<sub>X</sub>(x, u)\n*   d<sub>Z</sub>(H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v)) ≤ m₁d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w) + m₂d<sub>X</sub>(x, u) + m₃d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v)\n\nWith the further condition that the sum of the respective constants is less than 1:\n\n*   k₁ + k₂ + k₃ < 1\n*   l₁ + l₂ + l₃ < 1\n*   m₁ + m₂ + m₃ < 1\n\n**3. Continuity or Regularity of the Space:**\n\nEither the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the partially ordered metric spaces possess a \"regularity\" property. This regularity property ensures that if a non-decreasing sequence {x<sub>n</sub>} converges to x, then x<sub>n</sub> ≤<sub>X</sub> x for all n, and if a non-increasing sequence {y<sub>n</sub>} converges to y, then y ≤<sub>Y</sub> y<sub>n</sub> for all n. This allows the proof to proceed without assuming the continuity of the functions.\n\n**4.

Second, the functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property, meaning they are appropriately non-decreasing or non-increasing in each of their arguments with respect to the partial orders.
