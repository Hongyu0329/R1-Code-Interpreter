An FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z) for the functions F: X*Y*Z→X, G: Y*Z*X→Y, and H: Z*X*Y→Z exists if the following conditions are met. First, (X, ≤X, dX), (Y, ≤Y, dY), and (Z, ≤Z, dZ) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. Second, the functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property, meaning they are appropriately non-decreasing or non-increasing in each of their arguments with respect to the partial orders. Third, a contractive condition must hold for F, G, and H, ensuring that for comparable inputs, the distance between the outputs is reduced by a factor less than 1. Fourth, either the functions F, G, and H must be continuous, or the partially ordered spaces must satisfy a regularity condition ensuring that limits of monotone sequences maintain the order relation. Finally, there must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies specific inequalities with respect to the functions F, G, and H, such as x₀ ≤X F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥Y G(y₀, z₀, x₀), and z₀ ≤Z H(z₀, x₀, y₀). Uniqueness of the fixed point typically requires an additional condition of comparability between any two elements in the space.
