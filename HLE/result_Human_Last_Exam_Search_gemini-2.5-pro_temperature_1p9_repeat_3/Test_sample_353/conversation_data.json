    "For the BDF4 numerical scheme, the region of $A(\\alpha)$-stability is a region in the complex plane that contains a sector symmetric with respect to the negative real axis with a half-angle $\\alpha$. The boundary of this stability region is determined by the characteristic polynomials of the method, $\\rho(\\zeta)$ and $\\sigma(\\zeta)$, through the equation $z(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})}$.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, the first characteristic polynomial is given by $\\rho(\\zeta) = \\frac{25}{12}\\zeta^4 - 4\\zeta^3 + 3\\zeta^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\zeta + \\frac{1}{4}$ and the second characteristic polynomial is $\\sigma(\\zeta) = \\zeta^4$. The stability region boundary is the image of the unit circle under the function $z(\\zeta) = \\frac{\\rho(\\zeta)}{\\sigma(\\zeta)}$.\n\nThe angle $\\alpha$ is the largest value for which the sector $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha\\}$ is contained within the stability region of the method. This angle is determined by the tangent to the stability boundary from the origin. The exact value of this angle for the BDF4 method has been a subject of study.\n\nAccording to research by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, the tangent squared of the $A(\\alpha)$-stability angle for BDF4 is a root of a polynomial equation. Specifically, $\\tan^2(\\alpha)$ is a root of the polynomial $25x^2 - 110x + 4 = 0$. Solving for $x = \\tan^2(\\alpha)$ using the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{110 \\pm \\sqrt{110^2 - 4(25)(4)}}{2(25)} = \\frac{110 \\pm \\sqrt{12100 - 400}}{50} = \\frac{110 \\pm \\sqrt{11700}}{50} = \\frac{110 \\pm 30\\sqrt{13}}{50} = \\frac{11 \\pm 3\\sqrt{13}}{5}$\n\nSince we are looking for the maximum angle, we take the larger root for $\\tan^2(\\alpha)$. Therefore,\n\n$\\tan^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{11 + 3\\sqrt{13}}{5}$\n\nThis gives the exact value of $\\tan(\\alpha)$ as:\n\n$\\tan(\\alpha) = \\sqrt{\\frac{11 + 3\\sqrt{13}}{5}}$\n\nFinally, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is given in terms of $\\arctan()$ as:\n\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{11 + 3\\sqrt{13}}{5}}\\right)$\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{11 + 3\\sqrt{13}}{5}}\\right)$>>>"
