    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, which describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle, has a distinct functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This relationship is most transparent in the energy-frequency domain after a Fourier transform from the time domain.\n\nThe bare Green's function, also known as the free propagator, can be derived from the path integral for a free field theory. For a non-interacting system, the full Green's function is equivalent to the bare Green's function. The functional dependence is typically expressed through the spectral representation of the Green's function.\n\nIn the frequency (ω) and momentum (k) space, the bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k.\n\nFor a system of non-interacting fermions, the retarded bare Green's function is given by:\n\n***G_0<sup>R</sup>(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη)***\n\nand the advanced Green's function is:\n\n***G_0<sup>A</sup>(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k - iη)***\n\nwhere:\n*   **G_0** is the bare Green's function.\n*   **k** represents the momentum or other quantum numbers of the single-particle state.\n*   **ω** is the frequency.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state with quantum number k.\n*   **η** is a positive infinitesimal quantity that ensures causality.\n\nThe poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane correspond directly to the energy eigenvalues of the single-particle states. The structure of the Green's function shows that it diverges when the frequency ω of the particle matches its energy eigenvalue ϵ_k.\n\nThe relationship can also be understood through the spectral function, A(k, ω). For a non-interacting particle, the spectral function is a Dirac delta function centered at the single-particle energy:\n\n***A_0(k, ω) = 2πδ(ω - ϵ_k)***\n\nThe Green's function can then be obtained by integrating the spectral function:\n\n***G_0(k, ω) = ∫ dω' / (2π) * A_0(k, ω') / (ω - ω' + iη sign(ω'))***\n\nSubstituting the expression for A_0(k, ω') directly yields the inverse dependence on (ω - ϵ_k).\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is fundamentally that of an inverse function, with the eigenvalues determining the location of the poles in the complex frequency plane.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (or energy) variable and the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k.  In the energy-momentum representation, the time-ordered bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) takes the form:\n\nG_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ))\n\nwhere ω is the frequency, k is the momentum (or a set of quantum numbers), ϵ_k is the single-particle energy eigenvalue, μ is the chemical potential, and η is a positive infinitesimal. The key functional dependence is of the form (ω - ϵ_k)⁻¹, where the single-particle energy eigenvalues appear as the poles of the Green's function.>>>"
