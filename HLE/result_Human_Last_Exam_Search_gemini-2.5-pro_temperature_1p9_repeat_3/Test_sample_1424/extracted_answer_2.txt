In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (or energy) variable and the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k.  In the energy-momentum representation, the time-ordered bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) takes the form:

G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ))

where ω is the frequency, k is the momentum (or a set of quantum numbers), ϵ_k is the single-particle energy eigenvalue, μ is the chemical potential, and η is a positive infinitesimal. The key functional dependence is of the form (ω - ϵ_k)⁻¹, where the single-particle energy eigenvalues appear as the poles of the Green's function.
