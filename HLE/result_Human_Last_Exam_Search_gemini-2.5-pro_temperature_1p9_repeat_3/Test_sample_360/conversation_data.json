    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed which results in a mixture of two diastereoisomers.\n\nThe ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, acts as a bridging ligand, connecting two ruthenium centers. The starting ruthenium complex, *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), is a chiral molecule, existing in two enantiomeric forms (Δ and Λ).\n\nThe reaction of two equivalents of *cis*-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂] with the thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole ligand yields a dinuclear ruthenium complex. This product can exist as two different stereoisomers:\n\n*   A *meso* form, which has opposite chirality at the two metal centers (Δ/Λ). This isomer possesses a center of inversion.\n*   A *racemic* form, where the two metal centers have the same chirality (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ). This isomer has a two-fold rotation axis.\n\nThese two diastereoisomers are reported to form in a 2:1 ratio and can be separated by cation exchange chromatography.\n\n<<<2>>>"
