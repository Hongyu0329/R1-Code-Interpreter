    "The Christian theologians of the High Middle Ages, particularly during the scholastic period, first developed specialized terminology that can describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall. This terminology centers on the distinction between God's \"ordained power\" and \"absolute power\":\n\n*   ***Potentia Dei ordinata*** (God's ordained power): This refers to the established laws of nature and the orderly way God governs the universe. It is the predictable, consistent operation of the natural world according to the laws God has put in place.\n\n*   ***Potentia Dei absoluta*** (God's absolute power): This refers to God's sheer power to do anything that is not logically impossible, including acting outside of or contrary to the established natural order. This concept allows for miracles and divine interventions.\n\nMedieval theologians used this distinction to explain events that seemingly violated the normal course of nature. While many contributed to this theological framework, the Franciscan philosopher and theologian **John Duns Scotus** (c. 1266–1308) is a prominent figure who utilized this distinction to emphasize God's freedom and omnipotence. Another significant theologian who explored this was Meister Eckhart (c. 1260–c. 1328).\n\nThis terminology is applicable to:\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth**: The conception of Jesus in the womb of the Virgin Mary, without a human father, is considered a miracle. It is an event that suspends the *potentia Dei ordinata* (the natural laws of procreation) through an act of God's *potentia Dei absoluta*.\n\n*   **The Fall**: The theological consequences of the Fall of Adam and Eve are understood to include a fundamental change in the created order, such as the introduction of death, disease, and corruption into the world. This alteration of the original, \"very good\" creation can also be described as an exercise of God's absolute power, changing the operative natural laws for humanity and the world.\n\nTherefore, the distinction between *potentia Dei ordinata* and *potentia Dei absoluta*, developed and refined by scholastic theologians like Duns Scotus, provides a specialized vocabulary for discussing divine actions that alter or transcend the established laws of nature.\n\n<<<John Duns Scotus>>>"
