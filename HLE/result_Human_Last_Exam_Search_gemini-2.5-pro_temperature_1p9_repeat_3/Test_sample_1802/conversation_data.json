    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel `Λ` that transforms a qudit density matrix is **d²**, where `d` is the dimension of the qudit system.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification for this result:\n\n1.  **Qudit and Pauli Channel Definition:** A qudit is a quantum system with `d` levels. A Pauli channel `Λ` acting on a qudit's density matrix `ρ` is a quantum operation that can be expressed as a convex sum of transformations using the generalized Pauli operators `{U_k}`:\n    `Λ(ρ) = Σ_{k=0}^{d²-1} p_k U_k ρ U_k^†`\n    Here, `{U_k}` for `k = 0, ..., d²-1` are the `d²` generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl operators), which form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of `d x d` matrices. The coefficients `p_k` are probabilities, satisfying `p_k ≥ 0` and `Σ p_k = 1`.\n\n2.  **Kraus Operators and Channel Rank:** Any quantum channel can be represented using Kraus operators `{A_i}` such that `Λ(ρ) = Σ_i A_i ρ A_i^†`. The rank of a quantum channel, also known as the Choi rank, is the minimum number of Kraus operators needed for this representation. For the Pauli channel, a valid set of Kraus operators is `A_k = √p_k * U_k` for each `k` where `p_k > 0`.\n\n3.  **Rank of a Pauli Channel:** The `d²` generalized Pauli operators `{U_k}` are linearly independent. Consequently, the rank of the Pauli channel `Λ` is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities `p_k`. To achieve the maximum possible rank for `Λ`, we can consider a channel where all `d²` probabilities are non-zero. An example of such a channel is the completely depolarizing channel, for which all `p_k` are `1/d²`. Therefore, the maximal rank of a Pauli channel `Λ` is `d²`.\n\n4.  **Complementary Channel and its Rank:** Every quantum channel `Λ` with a set of Kraus operators `{A_k}` has a corresponding complementary channel `Λ^c`. The complementary channel describes the information passed to the environment during the operation. A key result in quantum information theory states that the rank of the complementary channel, `rank(Λ^c)`, is equal to the dimension of the vector space spanned by the Kraus operators `{A_k}` of the original channel `Λ`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Maximal Rank:**\n    *   As established, the maximal rank of a Pauli channel `Λ` is `d²`, which occurs when all `d²` probabilities `p_k` are non-zero.\n    *   In this case, we have `d²` Kraus operators `A_k = √p_k * U_k`.\n    *   Since the operators `{U_k}` are linearly independent, this set of `d²` Kraus operators is also linearly independent.\n    *   The dimension of the space spanned by these `d²` linearly independent Kraus operators is `d²`.\n    *   Therefore, the rank of the complementary channel `Λ^c` is `d²`.\n\nSince the rank of any quantum channel acting on a `d`-dimensional system cannot exceed `d²`, the maximal rank for the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is `d²`.\n\n<<<d²>>>"
