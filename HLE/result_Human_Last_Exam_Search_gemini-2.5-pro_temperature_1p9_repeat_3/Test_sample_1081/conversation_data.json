    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is in bijection with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$, especially when $G$ is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The question concerns a reductive group of type $E_8$. The Weyl group of type $E_8$ is denoted by $W(E_8)$. Therefore, the problem is to determine the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a group of order 696,729,600. According to R.W. Carter's work on the conjugacy classes of Weyl groups, the number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$ has been computed.\n\nBased on the established theory of reductive groups and the work of Carter, the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112. This number corresponds to the number of non-isomorphic $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a split group of type $E_8$. For a general reductive group of type $E_8$, which is necessarily quasi-split over a finite field, the number of rational maximal tori is also given by the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group.\n\nTherefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
