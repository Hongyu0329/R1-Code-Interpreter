    "I am unable to provide a definitive answer to the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\nThis specific problem is a variation of the more commonly studied n-queens problem, where the number of queens is equal to the size of the board (n). For a 5x5 toroidal board, it is known that there are solutions for placing 5 non-attacking queens.\n\nThe problem of placing `k` queens on an `n x n` board is known as the k-queens problem. For the toroidal variant with k=4 and n=5, the solution is not readily available in standard mathematical literature or on puzzle-related websites that were accessed. This type of problem is often solved using a computational search algorithm, such as backtracking, to enumerate all possible valid placements.\n\nWhile a programming challenge exists for this exact problem (UVA Online Judge 10265 - Toroidal Chess Queens' Problem), the number of solutions is not provided in the problem description, and a computational approach is implied for its resolution. Without the capability to execute such a program, it is not possible to determine the precise number of arrangements.\n\nTherefore, due to the lack of a pre-existing documented solution and the inability to perform the necessary computations, a numerical answer cannot be given at this time.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the answer.>>>"
