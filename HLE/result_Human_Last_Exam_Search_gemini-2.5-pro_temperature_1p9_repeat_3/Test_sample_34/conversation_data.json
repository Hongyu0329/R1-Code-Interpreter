    "In a 100BB, rake-free cash game, a player on the button has the widest opening range of any position at the table. The combination of guaranteed post-flop position and only two opponents to get through (who are out of position) makes raising a wide variety of hands profitable.\n\nGame Theory Optimal (GTO) strategies for this scenario advocate for an opening range of around 51% of all possible hands. This extensive range includes all suited Ax, Kx, Qx, and Jx hands. The lack of rake further encourages opening a wider range of hands compared to a raked game, as there is no house cut taken when the blinds fold to a pre-flop raise.\n\nThe weakest possible suited jack hand is J2s. Given that standard GTO-based charts include all suited jacks in the button's opening range, J2s represents the bottom, or \"worst,\" of that specific category that is still a standard, profitable open.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
