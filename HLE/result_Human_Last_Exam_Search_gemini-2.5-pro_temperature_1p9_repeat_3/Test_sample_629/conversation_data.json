    "The number of minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, when considered up to translation and rotation, is 5.\n\nThe trefoil knot is the simplest non-trivial knot and is an alternating knot with a crossing number of three. The minimal grid number for an alternating knot is determined by adding two to its crossing number. Therefore, the minimal grid number for the trefoil knot is 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nAt this minimal grid number of 5, there are a total of 10 distinct grid diagrams that represent a trefoil knot. The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it exists in two non-superimposable mirror-image forms: the left-handed and the right-handed trefoil. The grid number for a knot is the same as for its mirror image.\n\nResearch and enumeration have shown that there are 5 unique minimal grid diagrams for the right-handed trefoil knot. Given the symmetry between the two chiral forms, it follows that there are also 5 minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot.\n\n<<<E>>>"
