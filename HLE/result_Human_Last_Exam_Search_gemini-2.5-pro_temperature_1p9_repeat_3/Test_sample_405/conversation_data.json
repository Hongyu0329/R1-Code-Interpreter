    "At least five distinct colors can be observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus: white, yellow, red, violet, and black. These colors correspond to different structural arrangements of phosphorus atoms.\n\nThe primary allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors are:\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This is the most common and reactive allotrope. In its pure form, it is a white, waxy solid. However, upon exposure to light, it transforms into the more stable red phosphorus, which gives it a yellowish appearance. For this reason, it is often referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is much more stable and less reactive than white phosphorus. It has a dark red color and can have an iron-grey luster. Red phosphorus is used on the striking surface of safety matches.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a crystalline form of phosphorus that is obtained by heating red phosphorus in a sealed tube at high temperatures. As its name suggests, it is violet in color. It is sometimes described as red/purple.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most stable and least reactive allotrope of phosphorus. It has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite and is a conductor of electricity.\n\nIn addition to these, other forms have been synthesized, such as blue phosphorus, which exists as a single layer and is named for its electronic properties rather than its observable bulk color. Phosphorus nanorods have also been described as red/brown. However, the most commonly observed and distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are white, yellow, red, violet, and black.\n\n<<<5>>>"
