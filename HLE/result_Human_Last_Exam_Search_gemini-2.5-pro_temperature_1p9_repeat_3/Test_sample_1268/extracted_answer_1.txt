For a Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $f$ of squarefree level $N$ and fixed Laplacian eigenvalue $\lambda$, the upper bound for its sup-norm, denoted as $\|f\|_{\infty}$, in relation to the covolume $V$ is given by $\|f\|_{\infty} \ll_{\lambda, \epsilon} V^{-1/6 + \epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon > 0$. For a holomorphic newform $F$ of weight $k$ and squarefree level $N$, the corresponding bound for $f = y^{k/2}F$ is $\|f\|_{\infty} \ll_{k, \epsilon} V^{-1/6 + \epsilon}$.
