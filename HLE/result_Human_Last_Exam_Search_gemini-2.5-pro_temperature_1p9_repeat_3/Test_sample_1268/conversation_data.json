    "An upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume for squarefree natural numbers is a subject of ongoing research in number theory, specifically within the study of automorphic forms. The notation in the query, $(k_{k,\\infty})$, likely refers to the sup-norm (or $L^\\infty$-norm) of a holomorphic newform of weight $k$, while $(V)$ denotes the covolume of the associated modular curve, and $(N)$ is a squarefree natural number representing the level. The relationship between the covolume $V$ and the level $N$ for a squarefree level is given by $V \\approx N$.\n\nThe problem of determining this upper bound is known as the sup-norm problem. The bounds are typically given for $L^2$-normalized forms. Here are the key results for both holomorphic newforms and Maass cusp forms.\n\n### Holomorphic Newforms\n\nFor a holomorphic newform $F$ of weight $k$ and squarefree level $N$, one often considers the associated function $f = y^{k/2}F$. For such a form, which is $L^2$-normalized, a bound on its sup-norm has been established. Templier improved a previous bound to:\n$ \\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{k} N^{-1/23} $\nwhere the implied constant depends on the weight $k$. More recent results have further improved the exponent. For instance, a bound of the form $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} N^{-1/6 + \\epsilon}$ has been obtained for any $\\epsilon > 0$. Given that $V \\approx N$, this can be expressed in terms of the covolume as:\n$ \\|y^{k/2}F\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6 + \\epsilon} $\n\n### Maass Cusp Forms\n\nFor a Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$ of squarefree level $N$ and Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$, which is $L^2$-normalized, a significant result provides a hybrid upper bound that is uniform in both the level and the eigenvalue. A result by Harcos and Templier gives the bound:\n$ \\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24 + \\epsilon} N^{1/3 + \\epsilon} $\nfor any $\\epsilon > 0$. When considering the level aspect alone (i.e., for a fixed eigenvalue $\\lambda$), bounds of the form $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/6 + \\epsilon}$ have been achieved, which in terms of the covolume $V$ is:\n$ \\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6 + \\epsilon} $\n\nIt's important to note that these bounds represent significant results in the field and have been subject to continuous improvement. The \"trivial\" bound is of the order $V^{1/2}$, and any exponent smaller than $1/2$ is considered a breakthrough.\n\nTo summarize, for a squarefree level $N$ and an $L^2$-normalized newform (either holomorphic or Maass), the upper bound for the sup-norm generally shows a power-saving over the trivial bound in terms of the covolume $V$. The precise exponent in this power-saving relationship is a central topic of modern number theory research.\n\n<<<For a Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $f$ of squarefree level $N$ and fixed Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$, the upper bound for its sup-norm, denoted as $\\|f\\|_{\\infty}$, in relation to the covolume $V$ is given by $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$. For a holomorphic newform $F$ of weight $k$ and squarefree level $N$, the corresponding bound for $f = y^{k/2}F$ is $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6 + \\epsilon}$.>>>"
