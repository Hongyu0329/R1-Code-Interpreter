Based on the evidence, I predict that CAR T cells manufactured with Interleukin-15 will exhibit a significantly increased and more sustained release of effector cytokines, such as IFN-γ, granzyme B, and TNF-α, upon antigen stimulation compared to those manufactured without it. This heightened cytokine production is a direct consequence of IL-15's role in promoting a more potent and persistent effector memory T cell phenotype.
