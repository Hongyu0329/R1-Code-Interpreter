    "There are a total of **13** types of finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. These groups were classified by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their paper \"Small maximal sum-free sets.\" In the context of general groups, the term \"sum-free\" is used interchangeably with \"product-free.\"\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for all elements *a, b, c* in *S* (not necessarily distinct), the relation *ab = c* does not hold. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*.\n\nThe classification of finite groups with a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2, denoted as *S* = {*a*, *b*}, is as follows:\n\n### Groups Where the Product-Free Set Generates a Cyclic Group and has No Involutions\n\nIn this category, the subgroup generated by the product-free set *S* is a cyclic group. The possibilities for the group generated by *S*, denoted `<S>`, are:\n*   **C₄** (the cyclic group of order 4) with *S* = {*a*, *a*⁻¹} where *a* is a generator.\n*   **C₅** (the cyclic group of order 5) with *S* = {*a*, *a*⁻¹} where *a* is a generator.\n*   **C₆** (the cyclic group of order 6) with *S* = {*a*, *a*⁴} where *a* is a generator.\n*   **C₇** (the cyclic group of order 7) with *S* being one of {*a*, *a*⁻¹}, {*a*, *a*³}, or {*a*, *a*⁵} where *a* is a generator.\n*   **C₈** (the cyclic group of order 8) with *S* = {*a*, *a*⁶} where *a* is a generator.\n\n### Groups Where the Product-Free Set Contains an Involution\n\nHere, at least one element in the product-free set *S* has an order of 2 (an involution). The groups generated by *S* in these cases are:\n*   **C₂ × C₂** (the Klein four-group), where *S* consists of any pair of distinct involutions.\n*   **C₆** (the cyclic group of order 6), where *S* consists of the unique involution and any element of order 3.\n*   **D₆** (the dihedral group of order 6, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃), where *S* is comprised of any involution and any element of order 3.\n\n### Groups Where the Product-Free Set Contains Two Involutions\n\nThis case further specifies that both elements in the product-free set *S* are involutions:\n*   **C₂ × C₂**, where *S* is any set of 2 involutions.\n*   **C₄ × C₂**, with *S* being {*x*²,*y*} or {*x*²,*x*²y}, where *x* has order 4 and *y* is an involution.\n*   **C₂ × Q₈**, where Q₈ is the quaternion group of order 8. The set *S* is {*a*, *b*} or {*a*, *ab*} where *a* is the unique involution in Q₈.\n\n### Additional Groups\n\nFinally, there are two specific groups that complete the classification:\n*   **C₈** (the cyclic group of order 8) with the product-free set being *S* = {*x*², *x*⁶}, where *x* is a generator.\n*   **Q₁₂** (the generalized quaternion group of order 12), with the product-free set *S* = {*g*³, *g*²}, where *g* is an element of order 6.\n\nIn summary, the finite groups that can contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are the five cyclic groups (C₄, C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈), the Klein four-group (C₂ × C₂), the dihedral group of order 6 (D₆), the group C₄ × C₂, the group C₂ × Q₈, and the generalized quaternion group of order 12 (Q₁₂). This accounts for 10 specific group structures, with some allowing for multiple distinct product-free sets. Counting the group structures gives 10, while considering the different types of sets within those structures as distinct cases gives the number 13 as listed above. The prompt asks for the number of finite groups, and some groups appear in multiple categories with different types of product-free sets. Consolidating the group structures, there are **10** unique groups.\n\n<<<10>>>"
