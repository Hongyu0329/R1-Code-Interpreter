    "### Hip Placement Differentiates Cambré Derrière in Vaganova and Balanchine Methods\n\nA key distinction between the cambré derrière (backward bend) in the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods lies in the placement of the hip. The Balanchine method is recognized for its signature open hip in arabesque, a position often associated with or integrated into the cambré derrière, which creates the illusion of a higher leg line.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, a strong emphasis is placed on maintaining a squared torso and stable hips. The movement should be initiated from the upper back, with a feeling of lengthening the spine. The waistline remains lifted and long, and the hips are kept square to the front. The head is typically turned to look towards the forearm of the downstage arm. This Russian method prioritizes precision, control, and a harmonious, whole-body movement.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine technique, often described as American-style ballet, allows for a more daring and modern aesthetic. A well-known characteristic of this method is the practice of opening the hip of the lifted leg in arabesque. This lifting of the hip of the working leg is intended to create a more elongated and streamlined look. While a cambré can be performed from various positions, its execution in conjunction with an arabesque highlights this fundamental difference. In the Balanchine style, the traditional \"square\" of the shoulders and hips can be altered to achieve a more dynamic and visually striking line. This contrasts sharply with the Vaganova method's insistence on maintaining that square.\n\nBeyond hip placement, other stylistic differences exist. The Balanchine method often emphasizes speed, athleticism, and energy, with port de bras (arm movements) that can be more open and less curved than in the Vaganova style. However, the deliberate use of the hip to enhance the line of the leg in a backward-bending movement is a more fundamental and defining technical divergence between the two methods.\n\n<<<B>>>"
