    "To determine the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set given `Phi_k(x′)=0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9` using a t-norm operation, one must first understand the components involved. In fuzzy logic, the activation level of a rule, often called the firing strength, is typically calculated by combining the membership degrees of the antecedent and consequent parts of the rule using a t-norm. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical AND operation for fuzzy sets.\n\nThe terms provided, `Phi_k(x′)` and `μG_k_j(y_j)`, likely represent the firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule and the membership grade of the consequent part, respectively. The overall rule activation level is the result of applying a specific t-norm to these two values.\n\nThere are several types of t-norms, and the result will vary depending on which one is used. The most common t-norms include:\n\n*   **Minimum t-norm:** This is the most frequently used t-norm and is defined as the minimum of the two values.\n*   **Product t-norm:** This t-norm is calculated by multiplying the two values.\n*   **Lukasiewicz t-norm:** This t-norm is calculated as the maximum of 0 or the sum of the two values minus 1.\n\nGiven `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`, the rule activation level for each of these t-norms would be:\n\n*   **Using the Minimum t-norm:**\n    min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n*   **Using the Product t-norm:**\n    0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\n*   **Using the Lukasiewicz t-norm:**\n    max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6\n\nSince the query does not specify which t-norm to use, the answer depends on that choice. However, if a t-norm is not specified, the minimum t-norm is often the default.\n\n<<<The rule activation level is 0.7 when using the common minimum t-norm, 0.63 for the product t-norm, and 0.6 for the Lukasiewicz t-norm.>>>"
