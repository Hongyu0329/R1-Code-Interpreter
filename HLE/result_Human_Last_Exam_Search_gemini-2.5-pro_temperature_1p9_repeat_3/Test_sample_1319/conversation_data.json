    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad* is Mount Parnassus. Towering at an elevation of 2,457 meters (8,061 feet), it is a significant peak in central Greece.\n\nSeveral other mountains feature in the epic poem, but none reach the stature of Parnassus. Among them is Mount Ida on the island of Crete, which stands at 2,456 meters, making it a very close second. Another Mount Ida, located in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and also known as Kaz Dagi, has an elevation of 1,774 meters.\n\nOther notable mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* include:\n*   **Mount Othrys**: Located in central Greece, its highest peak is Gerakovouni at 1,726 meters.\n*   **Mount Pelion**: Situated in southeastern Thessaly, it reaches a height of 1,624 meters.\n*   **Mount Sipylus**: Found in what is now Turkey, this mountain has an elevation of 1,513 meters.\n\nWhile the gods observed the Trojan War from the peaks of Mount Olympus, various mythological events and divine interventions in the *Iliad* are associated with these other mountains, firmly embedding them in the epic's historical and mythical landscape.\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
