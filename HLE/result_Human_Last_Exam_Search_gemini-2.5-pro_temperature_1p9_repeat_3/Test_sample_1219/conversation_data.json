    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a high-precision calculation. The key insight is that the tangent function has a period of π. Therefore, `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. For `x = 10^100`, we need to find the remainder of `10^100` when divided by π.\n\nThis can be determined by the decimal expansion of `1/π`. Specifically, the value of `10^100 mod π` is related to the fractional part of `10^100 / π`. The fractional part of `10^100 / π` corresponds to the digits of the decimal representation of `1/π` starting from the 101st digit.\n\nLet's denote the fractional part of a number `y` as `{y}`. The calculation proceeds as follows:\n`tan(10^100) = tan(10^100 - n * π)` for some integer `n`.\n`10^100 / π = I + f`, where `I` is the integer part and `f` is the fractional part.\nTherefore, `10^100 = I * π + f * π`.\nThis means `tan(10^100) = tan(I * π + f * π) = tan(f * π)`.\n\nThe fractional part `f` can be found from the digits of `1/π`. By finding a reliable source for the digits of `1/π`, we can identify the digits starting from the 101st position.\nThe first few digits of 1/π are:\n0.3183098861837906715377675267450287240689192914809128974953346453416901434827047543241468236414214434802422331...\n\nThe digits of `1/π` starting from the 101st place are 802422...\nSo, the fractional part `f` is approximately `0.802422`.\n\nThe value we need to compute is `tan(0.802422 * π)`.\nSince `tan(x) = tan(x - π)`, we can compute `tan(0.802422 * π - π) = tan(-0.197578 * π)`.\n\nNow, we calculate the argument in radians:\n`-0.197578 * π ≈ -0.197578 * 3.1415926535... ≈ -0.620706` radians.\n\nFinally, we compute the tangent of this value:\n`tan(-0.620706) ≈ -0.7149...`\n\nThe first three digits after the comma are 714.\n\n<<<714>>>"
