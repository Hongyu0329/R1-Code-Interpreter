The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta are given by the expressions derived from Bose-Einstein statistics with zero chemical potential. The entropy is S = (4/3)σVT^3 and the mean energy is U = σVT^4, where S is the entropy, U is the mean energy, V is the volume, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. These equilibrium values are the most probable macroscopic states as described by the principles of large deviation theory embodied in the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems.
