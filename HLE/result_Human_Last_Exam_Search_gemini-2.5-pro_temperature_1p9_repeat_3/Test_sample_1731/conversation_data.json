    "## Equilibrium Properties of a Photon Gas: A Large Deviation Perspective\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for a photon gas, a prime example of a Bose-Einstein system, can be understood and derived through the powerful lens of large deviation theory, specifically utilizing the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding the emergence of thermodynamic equilibrium from the statistical behavior of a large number of particles.\n\n### Sanov's Theorem and the Entropy of a Photon Gas\n\nSanov's theorem is concerned with the probability of an empirical measure deviating from the true underlying probability distribution. For a system of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, it states that the probability of observing an empirical distribution that is significantly different from the true distribution is exponentially small. The rate of this exponential decay is given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the two distributions.\n\nIn the context of statistical mechanics, the microscopic states of a system can be seen as the outcomes of a random experiment. For a gas of non-interacting photons in a cavity, the \"experiment\" is the random allocation of photons to different energy levels. In thermal equilibrium, the most probable distribution of photons across these energy levels is the one that maximizes the entropy, subject to constraints like the total energy of the system.\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem provides a direct link between the statistical concept of relative entropy and the thermodynamic concept of entropy. It essentially states that the probability of observing a particular macroscopic state (defined by a certain distribution of particles over energy levels) is related to the entropy of that state. The equilibrium state, being the most probable, corresponds to the one with the maximum entropy.\n\nFor a photon gas, which follows Bose-Einstein statistics, the entropy can be derived by considering the number of ways to distribute indistinguishable photons among different energy states. A key characteristic of a photon gas at thermal equilibrium is that the number of photons is not conserved, which implies a chemical potential of zero. Applying the principle of maximizing the entropy for a Bose-Einstein gas under the constraint of a fixed average energy leads to the well-known expression for the entropy of a photon gas:\n\n$S = \\frac{4}{3} \\sigma V T^3$\n\nwhere `S` is the entropy, `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, `V` is the volume, and `T` is the temperature. This result, which can be derived through standard statistical mechanics, is fundamentally a consequence of the large deviation principle embodied by Sanov's theorem: the system overwhelmingly prefers the macroscopic configuration with the highest statistical weight, which corresponds to the maximum entropy.\n\n### Cramér-Chernoff's Theorem and the Mean Energy of a Photon Gas\n\nThe Cramér-Chernoff theorem deals with the probability of the sample mean of a set of i.i.d. random variables deviating from its expected value. The probability of such a \"large deviation\" also decays exponentially, with a rate function given by the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the cumulant generating function of the random variable.\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the mean energy of a system is the average energy of its constituent particles. The Cramér-Chernoff theorem can be used to understand the probability of observing a mean energy that is different from the equilibrium value. The theorem demonstrates that deviations from the mean energy predicted by the canonical ensemble are extremely unlikely for a large system. The equilibrium state is the one where the free energy is minimized, and the rate function in Cramér's theorem is directly related to the free energy.\n\nFor a photon gas, the mean energy is the total internal energy of the system, which can be found by summing over the energies of all the photons in all possible energy states, weighted by the Bose-Einstein distribution with a chemical potential of zero. This leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the mean energy of a photon gas:\n\n$U = \\sigma V T^4$\n\nwhere `U` is the mean energy, `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, `V` is the volume, and `T` is the temperature. This celebrated result is consistent with the predictions of large deviation theory. The Cramér-Chernoff theorem provides the underlying probabilistic justification for why a system in thermal equilibrium will almost certainly be found with the mean energy prescribed by the ensemble theory.\n\nIn conclusion, both the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems from large deviation theory provide a fundamental and rigorous basis for understanding the equilibrium properties of a photon gas. They explain why a system composed of a vast number of particles, each behaving randomly at a microscopic level, will almost certainly exhibit the deterministic macroscopic properties of entropy and mean energy that we observe in thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta are given by the expressions derived from Bose-Einstein statistics with zero chemical potential. The entropy is S = (4/3)σVT^3 and the mean energy is U = σVT^4, where S is the entropy, U is the mean energy, V is the volume, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. These equilibrium values are the most probable macroscopic states as described by the principles of large deviation theory embodied in the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems.>>>"
