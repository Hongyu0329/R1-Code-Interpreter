    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron with the tagline \"Ask Why\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Paul Krugman.\n\nThe advertising campaign, which encouraged questioning the status quo, ironically preceded the massive corporate scandal that led to Enron's bankruptcy in 2001. One of the commercials featured Nobel laureate physicist Murray Gell-Mann. In a later talk, Gell-Mann confirmed his participation, stating he was asked by a company, which he later identified as Enron, to discuss the importance of asking \"why not?\".\n\nPaul Krugman, who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, also had a paid advisory role with Enron in 1999. While his role was on an advisory panel, his association with the company during the period of the \"Ask Why\" campaign has been noted.\n\nAlthough one of the commercials featured Gell-Mann and an unidentified person of Indian descent, research confirms that both Gell-Mann and Krugman were the two Nobel laureates connected to Enron's \"Ask Why\" campaign.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
