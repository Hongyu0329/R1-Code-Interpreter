The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**, along with the byproduct triphenylphosphine oxide.

Here is the breakdown of the reaction:
*   **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.
*   **Phosphorus Ylide:** The name (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane describes a triphenylphosphine (=PPh₃) double-bonded to a substituted ethylidene group. The substituent is a 2-chlorophenyl group at position 2 of the ethyl chain, leading to the ylide structure: (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃.

In the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde and the triphenylphosphine group of the ylide are exchanged, forming a carbon-carbon double bond.

The reaction is as follows:
(CH₃)₃C-CHO + (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃ → (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl) + O=PPh₃

The systematic name for the resulting alkene product, (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), is 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene. The reaction typically produces a mixture of E and Z stereoisomers, with the Z-isomer often being the major product for non-stabilized ylides like the one used here.
