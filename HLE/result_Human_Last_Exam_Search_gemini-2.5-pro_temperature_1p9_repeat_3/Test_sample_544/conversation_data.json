    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide results in the formation of (phenylthio)acetonitrile, also known as 2-phenylsulfanylacetonitrile. This reaction is a variation of the Pummerer rearrangement.\n\nThe process unfolds in the following steps:\n1.  **Activation of the Sulfoxide**: The oxygen of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This step forms a reactive acyloxysulfonium intermediate, [Ph-S(OTf)Me]⁺.\n2.  **Formation of a Thionium Ion**: The intermediate is highly acidic at the α-carbon (the methyl group). A weak base abstracts a proton, leading to the elimination of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and the formation of a key electrophilic intermediate, the thionium ion ([Ph-S=CH₂]⁺).\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: This thionium ion is then trapped by the nucleophilic cyanide from trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN). This is considered an \"interrupted Pummerer reaction\" because an external nucleophile intercepts the reactive intermediate. The cyanide attacks the methylene carbon, yielding the final product.\n\nThe structure of the final product is Ph-S-CH₂-CN. The IUPAC name for this compound is 2-phenylsulfanylacetonitrile. It is also commonly referred to as (phenylthio)acetonitrile.\n\n<<<2-phenylsulfanylacetonitrile"
