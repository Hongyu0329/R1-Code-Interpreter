    "My plan is to find the museum that acquired Kurt Günther's 1927 painting \"The Radionist\" in 1967. I will conduct a search to identify the museum and the acquisition details. Once I have this information, I will write a Python script to present the answer clearly.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Store the name of the painting, the artist, the year of creation, the year of acquisition, and the name of the museum in variables.\n2.  Use these variables to construct a sentence that answers the user's question directly.\n3.  Print the resulting sentence, making sure to include the numbers 1927 and 1967 as requested.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the museum that acquired the 1927 painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967.\n# Research indicates that the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) acquired the painting in that year.\n\n# Define variables for the key information.\nartist = \"Kurt Günther\"\npainting_title = \"The Radionist\"\ncreation_year = 1927\nacquisition_year = 1967\nmuseum = \"Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden\"\n\n# Create a formatted string to present the answer, including the required numbers.\n# This answers the question of which museum acquired the painting in the specified year.\nanswer_text = (\n    f\"The museum that acquired the {creation_year} tempera painting '{painting_title}' \"\n    f\"by {artist} in {acquisition_year} was the {museum}.\"\n)\n\n# Print the final answer sentence.\nprint(answer_text)\n```\n<<<Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which museum acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
