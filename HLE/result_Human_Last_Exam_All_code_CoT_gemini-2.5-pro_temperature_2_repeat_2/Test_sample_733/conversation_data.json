    "This is a known problem in combinatorial group theory. A product-free set `S` in a group `G` is a subset such that the product of any two elements in `S` (including an element with itself) is not in `S`. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set. The question asks for the number of finite groups `G` that contain at least one maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nThis property has been studied, and it turns out there are exactly 9 such non-isomorphic finite groups. They are:\n1.  **C₄**: The cyclic group of order 4.\n2.  **C₅**: The cyclic group of order 5.\n3.  **C₆**: The cyclic group of order 6.\n4.  **C₂ x C₂**: The Klein four-group (also known as `V₄`).\n5.  **S₃**: The symmetric group on 3 elements (isomorphic to the dihedral group `D₆`).\n6.  **D₈**: The dihedral group of order 8.\n7.  **D₁₀**: The dihedral group of order 10.\n8.  **Q₁₂**: The dicyclic group of order 12 (also denoted `Dic₃`).\n9.  **C₃ ⋊ C₄**: A semidirect product of C₃ by C₄, of order 12.\n\nI will provide a Python script that programmatically verifies this property for this list of 9 groups. The script uses the `sympy` library to generate most of the groups. For the special semidirect product `C₃ ⋊ C₄`, a custom class is implemented since it's not available as a named group in `sympy`.\n\nThe script will define a function that checks if a group has a maximal product-free set of size 2. It will then iterate through the 9 groups, apply the check, and print the names of the verified groups and the final count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import (\n    CyclicGroup, DihedralGroup, SymmetricGroup, DicyclicGroup\n)\n\ndef has_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_2(G):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a group G has a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = list(G.elements)\n    identity = G.identity\n\n    non_identity_elements = [g for g in elements if g != identity]\n\n    # Iterate over all subsets of size 2\n    for s_tuple in itertools.combinations(non_identity_elements, 2):\n        S = set(s_tuple)\n        \n        # 1.
