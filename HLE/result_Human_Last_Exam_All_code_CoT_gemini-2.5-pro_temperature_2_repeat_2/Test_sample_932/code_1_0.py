# The problem asks to identify which insect tribes have immatures
# that are unlikely to be collected using a beat-sheet method.
# This method works by dislodging insects from plant foliage.

# Analysis of each tribe's immature habitat:
# 1) Apis: Larvae live inside beehives, not on plants. Unlikely.
# 2) Melipotini: Caterpillars feed on leaves. Likely.
# 3) Eupholini: Larvae are typically wood/root borers, not on foliage. Unlikely.
# 4) Acritini: Larvae are in decaying matter/dung, not on foliage. Unlikely.
# 5) Oxyptilini: Larvae are often internal stem/leaf borers. Unlikely.
# 6) Dictyophorini: Nymphs live and feed on plant stems/leaves. Likely.
# 7) Acanthocerini: Larvae live in decaying wood/litter. Unlikely.

# The indices of the tribes unlikely to be collected are 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
unlikely_indices = [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]

# Sort the indices in ascending order (they are already sorted).
unlikely_indices.sort()

# Convert the list of numbers to a comma-separated string for printing.
# str.join requires an iterable of strings, so we convert each number to a string first.
output_string = ", ".join(map(str, unlikely_indices))

# Print the final result.
print(output_string)
