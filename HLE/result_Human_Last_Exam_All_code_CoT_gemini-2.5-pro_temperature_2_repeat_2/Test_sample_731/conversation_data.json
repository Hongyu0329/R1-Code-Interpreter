    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct subgroups of the form $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ where $G$ is the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Group**: The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. This is a group of order $2^n$ where $2^n=512$, which implies $n=9$. The group can be represented as $G = SD_{2^9} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Analyze Power Subgroups**: A power subgroup $G^k$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. We will analyze these subgroups based on the exponent $k$.\n\n3.  **Case 1: $k$ is odd**: For any 2-group (a group whose order is a power of 2), like the semidihedral group, the function $f(g) = g^k$ is a bijection if and only if $k$ is odd. This means that if we take the $k$-th power of every element in the group, we get back all the elements of the group. Therefore, for any odd $k$, $G^k = G$. This accounts for one distinct power subgroup.\n\n4.  **Case 2: $k$ is even**: Any even integer $k$ can be written in the form $k = 2^j \\cdot m$, where $j \\ge 1$ and $m$ is odd. For any subgroup $H$, it holds that $(H^{2^j})^m = H^{2^j}$ because $m$ is odd. This simplifies our problem to finding the number of distinct subgroups of the form $G^{2^j}$.\n    *   For $j \\ge 1$, the power subgroup $G^{2^j}$ of the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ is the cyclic subgroup generated by $r^{2^j}$, i.e., $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    *   These subgroups form a chain: $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle \\supset G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle \\supset \\dots$\n    *   Since the order of $r$ is $2^{n-1} = 2^8 = 256$, the distinct subgroups in this chain are $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle$. The last subgroup, $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle$, is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n    *   The possible values for the exponent of $r$ are $2^1, 2^2, \\dots, 2^{n-1}$. This gives $n-1$ distinct subgroups. For $n=9$, this is $9-1 = 8$ subgroups.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total**: By summing the counts from both cases, we get the total number of distinct power subgroups.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and present the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups(group_size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of a given size.\n\n    Args:\n        group_size (int): The order of the semidihedral group, must be a power of 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: The size of the semidihedral group must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n}, the size is 2^n.
