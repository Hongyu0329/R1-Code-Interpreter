    "To determine which ballet step has the same starting and ending leg position, I will analyze the mechanics of each move.\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving three changes of the feet in the air, resulting in six distinct movements. If you start in fifth position with the right foot in front, you will land in fifth position with the left foot in front. The position changes.\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:** The term \"changé\" literally means \"changed.\" This step starts in fifth position, opens to second, and then closes back to fifth position with the feet switched. The position changes.\n3.  **C. Assemblé:** This means \"to assemble.\" It's a jump where the working leg brushes out, and the dancer pushes off the supporting leg to jump, bringing both legs together (\"assembling\" them) in the air and landing in the same fifth position from which they started. The position does not change.\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:** A \"glissade\" is a gliding step. \"Derrière\" means \"behind.\" When performing a glissade derrière, the dancer typically slides one foot out and closes the other foot to the back, which results in the feet switching their front/back orientation in fifth position. The position changes.\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished jump. It involves a `rond de jambe` with each leg while in the air, and the dancer lands with the feet switched from their starting fifth position. The position changes.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Assemblé is the only step among the choices where the starting and ending positions are the same. I will now write a Python script to represent this logic and identify the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_step():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same\n    leg position as it started.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A dictionary representing the ballet steps and whether they change leg position.\n    # True: Starting and ending leg positions are different.\n    # False: Starting and ending leg positions are the same.\n    ballet_steps = {\n        \"A.

Assemblé\": {\n            \"changes_position\": False,\n            \"description\": \"A jump where the legs are assembled in the air to land in the original starting position.\"\n        },\n        \"D.
