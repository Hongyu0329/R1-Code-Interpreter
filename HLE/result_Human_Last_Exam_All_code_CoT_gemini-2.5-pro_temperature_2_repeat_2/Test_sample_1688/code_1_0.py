    # A. Quantum Encryption: Still relies on keys. If keys are known, it's insecure.
    # B. Fast Key Rotation: Limits damage over time, but the communication during the time a key is known is insecure.
    # C. Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS): Protects past sessions from future key compromise, but doesn't protect a session if its specific key is known.
    # D. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD): A method to SECURELY SHARE a key. It's irrelevant if the key is already compromised.
    # E. Quantum Random One-Time-Pad (OTP): An OTP's perfect security relies entirely on its key (the pad) being secret. If the pad is known, the message is plain to see.

    All the proposed cryptographic techniques (A-E) are methods designed to protect, distribute, manage, or generate keys to prevent them from falling into an adversary's hands. They do not, and cannot, offer security if the key itself is already known to the adversary. The very definition of a secure encryption system is one where an adversary without the key cannot feasibly derive the plaintext. If the key is given to the adversary, the system is, by definition, broken.
