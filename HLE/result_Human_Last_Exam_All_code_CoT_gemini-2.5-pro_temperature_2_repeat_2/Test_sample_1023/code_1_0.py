# Step 1 & 2: Define the relationship between the extinction rates.
# The extinction rate for a morphospecies (μ_m) is the sum of the true extinction rate of an evolutionary species (μ_e)
# and the rate of "pseudo-extinction".
# Pseudo-extinction occurs from two sources:
# 1. Anagenesis (rate σ), where one morphospecies is replaced by another.
# 2. Bifurcating speciation (rate 0.5 * λ_e), where the mother species is replaced by two daughters.
#
# Equation for morphospecies extinction rate:
# μ_m = μ_e + (σ + 0.5 * λ_e)
# where the term in parentheses is the total rate of pseudo-extinction.

# Step 3: Apply the key constraint.
# The problem states to "Assume that for both evolutionary species and morphospecies, all the processes that affect them occur at the same rates."
# We interpret this as a simplifying assumption that the rate of true extinction equals the rate of pseudo-extinction.
#
# Constraint:
# μ_e = σ + 0.5 * λ_e

# Step 4: Substitute the constraint into the equation for μ_m.
# μ_m = μ_e + (μ_e)
# μ_m = 2 * μ_e
#
# The question asks for the multiplicative factor, which is μ_m / μ_e.
# Factor = (2 * μ_e) / μ_e = 2

# Step 5: Show the calculation with normalized numbers to fulfill the output requirement.
# Let's normalize the true extinction rate to 1 for clarity.
mu_e = 1

# From our constraint, the pseudo-extinction rate is equal to the true extinction rate.
pseudo_extinction_rate = mu_e

# The morphospecies extinction rate is the sum of true and pseudo extinction rates.
mu_m = mu_e + pseudo_extinction_rate

# The final multiplicative factor is the ratio of the morphospecies extinction rate
# to the evolutionary species extinction rate.
factor = mu_m / mu_e

print("The final equation is: Factor = (True Extinction Rate + Pseudo-Extinction Rate) / True Extinction Rate")
