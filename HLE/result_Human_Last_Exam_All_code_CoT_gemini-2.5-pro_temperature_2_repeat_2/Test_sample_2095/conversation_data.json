    "My plan is to find the exact evaluation of Zhang Ji's seven-character poems by Liu Ban. The answer is a known piece of information in Chinese literary criticism, specifically from Liu Ban's work 《中山诗话》 (Zhongshan Shihua).\n\nI will write a Python script that stores this specific evaluation and its context as a string. The script will then use the `print()` function to display the answer clearly in Chinese. This approach fulfills the user's request for a solution in a code block.\n\n```python\ndef print_evaluation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the exact evaluation of Zhang Ji's seven-character poems\n    by Liu Ban, as recorded in his work 《中山诗话》 (Zhongshan Shihua).\n    \"\"\"\n    evaluation_text = \"\"\"根据北宋学者刘攽在其诗话著作《中山诗话》中的记载，他对唐代诗人张籍的七言诗评价极低。\n\n刘攽的原话是：“张籍乐府、宫词皆杰出，至其七言诗，拙涩不可读，何也？”\n\n这段评价的意思是：刘攽认为张籍的乐府诗和宫词都非常出色，是杰作；然而，一谈到他的七言诗，就变得既笨拙（拙）又艰涩（涩），简直无法阅读。刘攽对此感到非常困惑和惊讶。\n\n因此，刘攽对张籍七言诗的精确评价就是：“拙涩不可读”。\"\"\"\n\n    print(evaluation_text)\n\nprint_evaluation()\n```\n<<<根据北宋刘攽在《中山诗话》中的记载，他对张籍七言诗的评价是：“张籍乐府、宫词皆杰出，至其七言诗，拙涩不可读，何也？”，意即其七言诗写得笨拙艰涩，无法阅读。>>>"
