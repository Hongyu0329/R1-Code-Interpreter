# The problem asks for the smallest number of pieces, k, to cut a square
# such that the pieces can be reassembled into the square in exactly 5 distinct ways.

# Step 1: Define the target number of assemblies, N.
N = 5

# Step 2: The strategy is to create N interchangeable tiling situations.
# This can be done by tiling the square with N congruent regions.
# We then make one of these regions 'special' by having it be composed of multiple pieces.
# The number of 'normal' pieces will be N-1. These are single, solid pieces.
num_atomic_pieces = N - 1

# Step 3: The 'special' region is made from multiple sub-pieces.
# To make it distinct from the single, atomic pieces, it must be composed of
# at least 2 pieces. To find the smallest k, we choose the minimum possible number of sub-pieces.
min_sub_pieces = 2

# Step 4: The smallest total number of pieces, k, is the sum of the
# 'atomic' pieces and the 'composite' sub-pieces.
# This constitutes the final equation for k.
k = num_atomic_pieces + min_sub_pieces

print("This is a geometric puzzle. The solution can be found by constructing a specific set of pieces.")
print("The plan is as follows:")
print(f"1. To get exactly N={N} assemblies, we first tile the square with {N} identical shapes.")
print(f"2. We create the puzzle pieces. {N-1} of them are single, solid pieces matching those identical shapes.")
print(f"3. The final 'piece' is a composite one, made by cutting the {N}th shape into smaller parts.")
print(f"4. To minimize the total number of pieces, we cut the composite shape into the minimum number of parts, which is m={min_sub_pieces}.")
print("\nThe smallest value of k is the sum of these two sets of pieces.")
print("\nThe final equation is:")
print(f"k = (Number of Assemblies - 1) + (Minimum Sub-pieces)")
print(f"k = ({N} - 1) + {min_sub_pieces}")
print(f"k = {num_atomic_pieces} + {min_sub_pieces}")
print(f"k = {k}")
print("\nTherefore, the smallest value of k for which this can be achieved is 6.")
