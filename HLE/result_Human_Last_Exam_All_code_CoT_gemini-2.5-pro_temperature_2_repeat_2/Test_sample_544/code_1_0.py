# This script determines the IUPAC name for the product of the described reaction.

# Step 1: Define the components of the final IUPAC name based on chemical analysis.
# The parent compound is based on the two-carbon nitrile structure.
# "acetonitrile" is the preferred IUPAC name (PIN) for CH3CN.
parent_name = "acetonitrile"

# The substituent group C6H5-S- attached to the parent chain.
substituent = "phenylthio"

# Step 2: Assemble the final IUPAC name.
# For compound substituents like "phenylthio", parentheses are used.
# Since "acetonitrile" only has one carbon for substitution (the methyl carbon),
# no locant number (like 1- or 2-) is necessary.
final_name = f"({substituent}){parent_name}"

# Step 3: Print the result.
print("The final product of the reaction is C6H5-S-CH2-CN.")
print("Its IUPAC name is determined as follows:")
print(f"Substituent: {substituent}")
print(f"Parent name: {parent_name}")
print("\nFinal IUPAC Name:")
print(final_name)

# As per the instructions, address the presence of numbers in the final name.
# In this specific case, the preferred IUPAC name does not contain any numbers.
print("\nNote on Locant Numbers:")
print("In the Preferred IUPAC Name (PIN) for this compound, there are no locant numbers needed.")
