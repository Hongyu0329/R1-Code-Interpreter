    "The question you're asking touches on the intersection of physics, mathematics, and philosophy. It is a fascinating question, but the short answer is no. Here is a step-by-step explanation of why this is the case, followed by a Python script that, instead of attempting an impossible proof, illustrates the logical structure of Gödel's actual argument.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Explain the Disconnect:** I will first clarify why the mathematical tools of quantum mechanics (QM) are not applicable to Gödel's ontological proof. QM's mathematics (based on Hilbert spaces, linear operators, and probability theory) describes the behavior of physical systems. Gödel's proof, on the other hand, exists in the realm of modal logic, a system designed to handle concepts like necessity and possibility in a purely abstract, non-physical way. The two frameworks do not share the necessary axioms or language to influence one another.\n\n2.  **Provide an Illustrative Script:** Since a proof from QM is not possible, I will provide a Python script that is relevant to your question in a different way. The script will outline the logical steps, axioms, and definitions of Gödel's ontological proof. This will make the abstract argument more concrete and demonstrate the kind of logical system in which the proof actually operates, highlighting its distinction from the mathematics of physics.\n\n3.  **Code Output:** The Python code will print each major step of the proof, from axioms to the final conclusion, with explanations. For the final theorem (`□∃x G(x)`), it will print out each symbol of the \"equation\" as requested.\n\nHere is the script.\n\n```python\ndef present_godels_proof():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents a simplified, textual outline of Gödel's ontological proof.\n    It does not formally prove it but illustrates the logical structure, axioms,\n    and definitions involved. The logic used is modal logic, which is distinct from\n    the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- A Textual Outline of Gödel's Ontological Proof ---\")\n    print(\"Note: This script outlines the logical flow of the proof. It does not execute it.\")\n    print(\"Symbols: 'P(φ)' means 'φ has a positive property'. '¬' is NOT. '→' is IMPLIES.\")\n    print(\"'□' is NECESSARILY. '◇' is POSSIBLY.
