    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in `phi^4` theory near four dimensions, we will use the renormalization group method.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce the Beta Function**: The core of the analysis is the beta function, `β(u)`, which describes how the coupling constant `u` changes with the energy scale. For `phi^4` theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the one-loop beta function is `β(u) = -ϵu + (3u^2)/(16π²)`.\n2.  **Define the Fixed Point**: A fixed point `u*` is a specific value of the coupling where the theory becomes scale-invariant. This occurs when the beta function is zero, i.e., `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **Solve for u***: We will solve the equation `-ϵu* + (3(u*)^2)/(16π²) = 0` for the non-trivial coupling `u*`. This non-trivial solution is known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n4.  **Python Script**: I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to perform this derivation symbolically. The script will define the beta function, solve for the fixed point, and print the resulting equation with each numerical part explicitly shown as requested.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_wilson_fisher_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically derives the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variables.
