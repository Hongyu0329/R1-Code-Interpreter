    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the specified Calabi-Yau link, we first need to understand its relationship with the geometry of the algebraic variety it represents. The link is associated with a Calabi-Yau threefold, which is described as a hypersurface $X$ in the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4_{(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)}$.\n\n### **Plan**\n\n1.  **Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition:** A hypersurface in a weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4_{(w_1, \\dots, w_5)}$ is Calabi-Yau if its degree $d$ equals the sum of the weights, i.e., $d = \\sum w_i$. We will calculate this degree. Note: The provided polynomial must contain a typo (the monomial $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has the wrong degree). However, the invariant for a generic quasi-smooth hypersurface depends only on the weights and the degree, not the specific polynomial coefficients. We will proceed under the assumption that the problem intends to describe a generic Calabi-Yau threefold with the given weights.\n\n2.  **Use the Formula for the Invariant:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant is given by `inv(X) = (c_2(X) · H) / 12`, where `c_2(X)` is the second Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$ and `H` is the hyperplane class. For a quasi-smooth orbifold like our hypersurface, this is calculated as:\n    $c_2(X) \\cdot H = \\frac{d \\sum_{i<j} w_i w_j}{\\prod_k w_k} - \\sum_{\\substack{\\{i,j\\} \\\\ g=\\text{gcd}(w_i, w_j)>1}} \\frac{g-1}{g} \\cdot \\frac{d}{\\prod_{k \\ne i,j} w_k}$\n    The first term is the contribution as if the space were smooth, and the summation provides corrections for the orbifold singularities of the ambient space along strata where pairs of coordinates vanish.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Components:**\n    *   Calculate $d$, $\\sum_{i<j} w_i w_j$, and $\\prod_k w_k$.\n    *   Identify all pairs of weights $\\{w_i, w_j\\}$ that are not coprime.\n    *   For each such pair, compute the corresponding correction term.\n    *   Combine all terms to find `c_2(X) · H`.\n    *   Finally, divide by 12 to get the invariant.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** We will use Python with the `fractions` module to ensure all calculations are exact and avoid floating-point errors. The `math.gcd` function will be used to find the common divisors. The final result will be presented as a fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define weights and calculate the degree d\n    w = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    d = sum(w)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The weights are ({}, {}, {}, {}, {}) and the degree d = sum(w) = {}.\".format(*w, d))\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate components for the main term of the formula\n    prod_w = math.prod(w)\n    \n    # Sum of pairwise products of weights: sum_{i<j} w_i*w_j\n    sum_ww = 0\n    for i, j in combinations(w, 2):\n        sum_ww += i * j\n\n    main_term_num = d * sum_ww\n    main_term = Fraction(main_term_num, prod_w)\n    \n    print(f\"Step 2: Calculated main term component.\")\n    print(f\"  Sum of pairwise products of weights = {sum_ww}\")\n    print(f\"  Product of all weights = {prod_w}\")\n    print(f\"  Main term = ({d} * {sum_ww}) / {prod_w} = {main_term}\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the orbifold correction terms\n    total_correction = Fraction(0)\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculating orbifold correction terms.\")\n    \n    for i, j in combinations(range(len(w)), 2):\n        wi, wj = w[i], w[j]\n        g = math.gcd(wi, wj)\n        \n        if g > 1:\n            print(f\"  Found non-coprime pair (w{i+1}, w{j+1}) = ({wi}, {wj}) with gcd = {g}.\")\n            \n            # Product of other weights\n            prod_w_other = 1\n            for k in range(len(w)):\n                if k != i and k != j:\n                    prod_w_other *= w[k]\n            \n            # Correction for this pair\n            d_ij = Fraction(d, prod_w_other)\n            correction = Fraction(g - 1, g) * d_ij\n            \n            print(f\"    Product of other weights = {prod_w_other}\")\n            print(f\"    Correction = ({g}-1)/{g} * ({d}/{prod_w_other}) = {correction}\")\n            \n            total_correction += correction\n\n    print(f\"\\nTotal correction term = {total_correction}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate c2(X).H and the final invariant\n    c2H = main_term - total_correction\n    print(f\"\\nStep 4: Combining terms.\")\n    print(f\"  c2(X).H = Main Term - Total Correction = {main_term} - {total_correction} = {c2H}\")\n    \n    invariant = c2H / 12\n    print(f\"  Invariant = c2(X).H / 12 = {c2H} / 12 = {invariant}\")\n\n    # Step 5: Final Equation Output\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Invariant = ( (({d} * {sum_ww}) / {prod_w}) - {total_correction} ) / 12\")\n    print(f\"Invariant = ( {main_term} - {total_correction} ) / 12\")\n    print(f\"Invariant = ( {c2H} ) / 12\")\n    print(f\"Invariant = {invariant}\")\n    \n    return invariant\n\nfinal_invariant = solve_crawley_nordstrom()\n<<<{}>>>.format(final_invariant)\n```"
