    Clue 1: A shameful condition for a Pope. A Pope is the head of a church
    with holy books, so being unable to read is shameful.
    
    Clue 2: The condition "was written in the 1960s". This refers to the
    fact that global illiteracy became a major topic of reports, initiatives,
    and writing by organizations like UNESCO during the 1960s.
