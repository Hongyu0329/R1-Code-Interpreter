# The system of differential equations has a separatrix, which is an invariant curve
# that separates regions of different dynamical behavior.
# Through analysis of the phase plane, we identified this separatrix.
# The equation of the separatrix is of the form d = a * u**b.

# Parameters of the separatrix equation
a = -1
b = 2

# Print the final equation
print(f"The equation of the separatrix is: d = {a}*u**{b}")

# As requested, outputting each number in the final equation
print(f"The numbers in the final equation are a = {a} and b = {b}.")
