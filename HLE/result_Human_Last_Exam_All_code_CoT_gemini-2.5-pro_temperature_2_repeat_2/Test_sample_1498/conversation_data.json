    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Poem and Section**: I will first identify the specific text, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, and locate the section that deals with the belief in the Prophets (Rusul).\n2.  **Locate the Starting Verse**: I will find the verse that begins the enumeration of the 25 prophets' names. This verse typically starts with \"هُمْ آدَمٌ ادْرِيْسٌ نُوْحٌ...\" (Hum Ādamun, Idrīsun, Nūḥun...). By checking standard editions of the poem, I can determine its number.\n3.  **Locate the Ending Verse**: I will find the verse that concludes the list of names. This verse ends with the mention of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, often referred to as 'Taha', with the line \"...عِيْسَى وَطَهَ\" (...`Īsā wa Ṭāhā`).\n4.  **Formulate the Code**: I will then write a Python script that stores these starting and ending verse numbers and prints a clear statement providing the range. The script will also explicitly print the numbers 30 and 33 to satisfy the request to output each number in the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt)\n    in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' where the names of the 25 prophets are listed.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Verse 29 introduces the topic but does not list names.\n    # The actual enumeration of the names starts from bayt 30.\n    start_bayt = 30\n    \n    # The enumeration concludes at bayt 33.\n    end_bayt = 33\n    \n    print(\"In the famous poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen), the names of the Prophets are mentioned in a specific range of verses (bayt).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe list of the 25 prophets begins at the following bayt:\")\n    print(start_bayt)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe list concludes at the following bayt:\")\n    print(end_bayt)\n\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the names of the Prophets are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the result\nfind_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<From bayt 30 to bayt 33>>>"
