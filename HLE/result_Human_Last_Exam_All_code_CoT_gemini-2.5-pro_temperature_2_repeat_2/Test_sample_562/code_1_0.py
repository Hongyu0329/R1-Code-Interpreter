def find_kanji_radical_name():
    """
    This function provides the name of the radical for the Japanese character 謄.

    1.  Character: 謄
    2.  Decomposition: The character has a left-right structure. The left part is 言, and the right part is 朕.
    3.  Radical Identification: For characters with this structure (known as hen-tsukuri), the left-side component is typically the radical. In this case, the radical is 言.
    4.  Radical Name: The radical 言 is known as "kotoba" or "iu". However, when it's used as the left-side component of a kanji, its common name is "gonben" (ごんべん).
    5.  Hepburn Transcription: The hiragana ごんべん is transcribed to "Gonben" in the Hepburn system.
