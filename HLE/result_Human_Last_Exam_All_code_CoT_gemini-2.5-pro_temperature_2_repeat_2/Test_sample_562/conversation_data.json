    "My plan to solve this request is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the character:** I will first examine the structure of the kanji character 謄.\n2.  **Identify the radical:** Kanji characters are often composed of smaller components, one of which is the primary classifier, known as the radical or \"bushu\" (部首). I will identify this key component in the character 謄.\n3.  **Determine the radical's name:** Each radical has a specific Japanese name, which can sometimes change depending on its position in the character. I will find the correct Japanese name for the identified radical in its specific context.\n4.  **Transcribe to Hepburn:** I will then convert the Japanese name from hiragana or katakana into Hepburn romanization, which is the standard system for transcribing Japanese into the Latin alphabet.\n5.  **Create the Python script:** Finally, I will write a simple Python script that prints the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_kanji_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the radical for the Japanese character 謄.\n\n    1.  Character: 謄\n    2.  Decomposition: The character has a left-right structure. The left part is 言, and the right part is 朕.\n    3.  Radical Identification: For characters with this structure (known as hen-tsukuri), the left-side component is typically the radical. In this case, the radical is 言.\n    4.  Radical Name: The radical 言 is known as \"kotoba\" or \"iu\". However, when it's used as the left-side component of a kanji, its common name is \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n    5.  Hepburn Transcription: The hiragana ごんべん is transcribed to \"Gonben\" in the Hepburn system.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The character in question\n    kanji = \"謄\"\n    \n    # The radical component of the character\n    radical_char = \"言\"\n    \n    # The Japanese name for the radical when it's on the left side\n    radical_name_japanese = \"ごんべん\"\n    \n    # The Hepburn transcription of the radical's name\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n    \n    print(radical_name_hepburn)\n\nfind_kanji_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
