    print("Fact 1: Adult snakeflies are primarily predatory, feeding on a variety of small, soft-bodied insects. Aphids are a common prey item.")

    # Option A: Nectar
    print("A. Nectar: Correct. This is a known supplemental food source.")

    # Option B: Māhoe pollen
    print("B. Māhoe pollen: Plausible but less certain. While they do eat pollen, Māhoe is a New Zealand native tree, and snakeflies are not native to New Zealand. However, pollen is a food source.")

    # Option C: Fungus
    print("C. Fungus: Incorrect. This is not a known food source for snakeflies.")

    # Option D: Karamū leaf tissue
    print("D. Karamū leaf tissue: Incorrect. They are not herbivores; they do not eat leaf tissue.")

    # Option E: Totara Aphids
    print("E. Totara Aphids: Correct. Aphids are a primary predatory food source.")
