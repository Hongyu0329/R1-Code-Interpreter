    "Here is a Python script to analyze the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will outline the known diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) based on entomological knowledge.\n2.  I will then evaluate each of the given answer choices against this information.\n3.  Based on the evaluation, I will determine which choices are correct.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the logical conclusion that combines the correct choices to select the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Provide general information about the adult snakefly diet.\n    print(\"Fact 1: Adult snakeflies are primarily predatory, feeding on a variety of small, soft-bodied insects. Aphids are a common prey item.\")\n    print(\"Fact 2: In addition to being predators, adult snakeflies are also known to supplement their diet with sweet substances like nectar, as well as pollen.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate the provided options based on these facts.\n    print(\"Evaluating the options:\")\n\n    # Option A: Nectar\n    print(\"A. Nectar: Correct. This is a known supplemental food source.\")\n\n    # Option B: Māhoe pollen\n    print(\"B. Māhoe pollen: Plausible but less certain. While they do eat pollen, Māhoe is a New Zealand native tree, and snakeflies are not native to New Zealand. However, pollen is a food source.\")\n\n    # Option C: Fungus\n    print(\"C. Fungus: Incorrect. This is not a known food source for snakeflies.\")\n\n    # Option D: Karamū leaf tissue\n    print(\"D. Karamū leaf tissue: Incorrect. They are not herbivores; they do not eat leaf tissue.\")\n\n    # Option E: Totara Aphids\n    print(\"E. Totara Aphids: Correct.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
