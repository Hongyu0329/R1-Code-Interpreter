    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction.\n\nFirst, I will identify the two reactants: the carbonyl compound (pivalaldehyde) and the phosphorus ylide ((2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane). The Wittig reaction forms an alkene by creating a new carbon-carbon double bond, replacing the C=O bond of the aldehyde and the C=P bond of the ylide.\n\nI will deduce the structure of the product by connecting the carbon skeleton from the aldehyde to the carbon skeleton from the ylide.\n\nNext, I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the resulting alkene. This involves finding the longest carbon chain that includes the new double bond, numbering it to give the double bond the lowest possible locant, and naming and numbering all the substituents.\n\nAn important consideration in the Wittig reaction is the stereochemistry of the resulting double bond (E/Z or trans/cis isomerism). I will assess the ylide's structure to classify it as stabilized or non-stabilized. This classification is key to predicting the major stereoisomer formed. Non-stabilized ylides, like the one in this problem, predominantly yield the Z-alkene.\n\nFinally, I will present a Python script that follows these steps to build the product's name and its chemical structure representation in SMILES format. The script will explicitly print out the chemical logic and the numerical locants used in the final IUPAC name, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the product of a Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and\n    (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane, and prints the detailed derivation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
