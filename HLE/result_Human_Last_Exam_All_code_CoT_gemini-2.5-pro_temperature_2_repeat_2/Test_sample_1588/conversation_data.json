    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  The problem asks for the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. This quantity is equivalent to the dimension of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements (say, X and Y) in degree 10.\n2.  This dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula, which gives the number of basic Lie commutators of degree `n` with `k` generators: `L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`.\n3.  In this case, the order is `n=10`, and we have `k=2` generators. The summation `Σ` is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`. `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n4.  The Python code will implement the following steps:\n    *   Find all divisors `d` of `n=10`. These are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n    *   For each divisor `d`, compute the value of the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n    *   For each divisor `d`, compute the term `μ(d) * 2^(10/d)`.\n    *   Sum these terms together.\n    *   Divide the total sum by `n=10` to get the final answer.\n5.  The final script will print the complete equation, showing all the numbers used in the calculation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n       factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius_mu(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Möbius function mu(n).\n    - mu(1) = 1\n    - mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    - mu(n) = (-1)^k if n is a product of k distinct primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    \n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n            \n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_witt():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients for order 10 in the\n    BCH expansion using Witt's formula and prints the full calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # Order of the term\n    k = 2   # Number of generators (X and Y)\n\n    # Witt's formula: L_n(k) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} mu(d) * k^(n/d)\n    \n    divisors_of_n = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    sum_terms = 0\n    \n    # Store parts of the equation string\n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    for d in divisors_of_n:\n        mu_d = mobius_mu(d)\n        exponent = n // d\n        term = mu_d * (k ** exponent)\n        sum_terms += term\n        \n        # Build the string for each term in the sum, e.g., \"((-1) * 2^5)\"\n        equation_parts.append(f\"(({mu_d}) * {k}^{exponent})\")\n\n    result = sum_terms // n\n    \n    # Construct the final equation string\n    equation_string = f\"(1/{n}) * ( \" + \" + \".join(equation_parts) + f\" ) = {result}\"\n    \n    print(\"The number of nonzero coefficients is calculated using Witt's formula L_n(k) for n=10, k=2.\")\n    print(\"The formula is: L_n(k) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} mu(d) * k^(n/d)\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculation for n={n}, k={k} and divisors {divisors_of_n} is:\")\n    print(equation_string)\n\nsolve_bch_witt()\n```\n<<<99>>>"
