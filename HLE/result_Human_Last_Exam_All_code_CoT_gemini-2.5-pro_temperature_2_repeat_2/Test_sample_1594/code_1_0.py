# The riddle requires identifying the letter formed by the buildings of
# Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa when seen from above.

# Step 1: Locate the schools using an online map service.
# They are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce in Pisa.

# Step 2: Observe the satellite view of the school buildings.
# - The building of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti forms a long vertical shape.
# - The building of the Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini forms another long vertical shape parallel to the first.
# - A connecting structure or building section runs horizontally between the two main buildings, linking them in the middle.

# Step 3: Conclude the shape.
# The two parallel buildings (the vertical strokes) and the connecting part (the horizontal bar)
# clearly form the shape of a letter.

# Step 4: Identify the letter.
letter = "H"

# Step 5: Print the final answer.
print(f"When viewed from above, the buildings of Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini form the letter: {letter}")
