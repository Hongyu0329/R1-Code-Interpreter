    "The pattern in the sequence `ZXXCVYBN` is a combination of two distinct sequences.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Sequence:** The main sequence is formed by the letters on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard, read from left to right.\n2.  **Identify the Insertion Sequence:** A secondary sequence is interleaved with the base sequence. This secondary sequence consists of letters in alphabetical order, starting from 'X'.\n3.  **Determine the Interleaving Pattern:** The final sequence is constructed by taking two letters from the keyboard sequence, followed by one letter from the insertion sequence, and repeating this pattern.\n4.  **Reconstruct the Given Sequence:** We will build the sequence step-by-step according to this pattern.\n5.  **Find the Next Letter:** By following the pattern, we can determine what the next letter should be.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_letter():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the letter sequence puzzle by identifying and combining two patterns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
