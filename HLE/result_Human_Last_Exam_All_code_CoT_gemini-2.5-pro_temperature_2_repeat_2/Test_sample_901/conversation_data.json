    "This is an E2 elimination reaction. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the product is determined:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants**: We have (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane as the substrate and potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base) as the reagent. This combination is characteristic of an E2 elimination reaction.\n\n2.  **E2 Mechanism Requirement**: The E2 mechanism requires a specific stereochemical arrangement for the elimination to occur. The leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed by the base must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means they must both be in **axial** positions and on opposite sides of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substrate's Chair Conformations**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S,2R) configuration indicates that the bromine and the methyl group are *trans* to each other. A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations:\n    *   **Conformation A (diequatorial)**: The bromine atom is in an equatorial position, and the methyl group is also in an equatorial position. This is the more stable conformation because bulky groups prefer the spacious equatorial position.\n    *   **Conformation B (diaxial)**: After a ring flip, the bromine atom moves to an axial position, and the methyl group also moves to an axial position. This is the less stable conformation.\n\n4.  **Determine the Reactive Conformation**: For the E2 reaction to happen, the leaving group (Br) must be in an **axial** position. Therefore, the reaction must proceed through the less stable diaxial conformation (Conformation B). Even though it's less stable and exists in a small concentration at equilibrium, only this conformer can undergo the E2 reaction.\n\n5.  **Identify the Proton to be Removed**: In the reactive diaxial conformation, the Br is axial. The base now looks for an anti-periplanar (i.e., axial) proton on an adjacent carbon.\n    *   **At Carbon 2**: The methyl group is in the axial position. This means the hydrogen on Carbon 2 is in the **equatorial** position. It is *not* anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, so elimination cannot occur here to form 1-methylcyclohexene (the more substituted Zaitsev product).\n    *   **At Carbon 6**: This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial, and one is equatorial. The **axial hydrogen** at C6 is perfectly positioned (anti-periplanar) for elimination with the axial bromine at C1.\n\n6.  **Form the Product**: The bulky base (tert-butoxide) removes the axial proton from C6, a double bond forms between C1 and C6, and the bromide ion leaves. The product formed is **3-methylcyclohexene**. The stereochemistry prevents the formation of the more stable Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef get_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the major product of the reaction between\n    (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide.\n    \n    The reaction is an E2 elimination. Key points:\n    1.  Substrate: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a trans-disubstituted cyclohexane.\n    2.  Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, bulky base, favoring elimination.\n    3.  Mechanism: The E2 reaction requires an anti-periplanar (diaxial) arrangement\n        of the leaving group (Br) and the proton to be eliminated.\n    4.  Reactive Conformer: The reaction must proceed through the less stable conformer where\n        both the Br at C1 and the methyl group at C2 are in axial positions.\n    5.  Regioselectivity: In this axial conformation:\n        - The hydrogen at C2 is equatorial, so it cannot be eliminated. The Zaitsev\n          product (1-methylcyclohexene) cannot form.\n        - The hydrogen at C6 has an axial proton, which is anti-periplanar to the\n          axial bromine. Elimination occurs here.\n    6.  Product: Elimination of H from C6 and Br from C1 results in a double bond\n        between C1 and C6.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The major product of the reaction.\n    # The double bond is formed between C1 and C6, with the methyl group remaining on C3\n    # relative to the new double bond.\n    product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    \n    print(f\"The name of the major product is: {product_name}\")\n\nget_reaction_product()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
