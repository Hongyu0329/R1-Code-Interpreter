    print("Step 1: Define Behaviors and the Goal")
    print("The goal is to maximize plant fitness, which in this context means maximizing successful pollination.")
    print("Pollination requires physical contact between the insect and the flower.\n")
    print("Behavioral Ethogram:")
    print(" - Investigation (events 1-2): Non-contact, low pollination potential.")
    print(" - Interaction (events 3-4): Contact, high pollination potential.")
    print(" - Feeding (events 5-6): A type of interaction, very high pollination potential.\n")

    print("Step 2: Evaluate Each Answer Choice\n")

    # A. 4-3 >> 6-5
    print("Choice A: (Interaction duration) >> (Feeding duration)")
    print("This describes an insect that spends a lot of time on the plant but very little time feeding. While contact is good, this may not be the most effective pattern if feeding is the primary way pollination occurs. Verdict: Plausible but maybe not optimal.\n")

    # B. 6-5 >> 4-3
    print("Choice B: (Feeding duration) >> (Interaction duration)")
    print("This is logically impossible. Feeding (events 5-6) is a subset of interaction (events 3-4). The duration of a part cannot be greater than the duration of the whole. Verdict: Impossible.\n")

    # C. 4-3 >> 2-1
    print("Choice C: (Interaction duration) >> (Investigation duration)")
    print("This describes an efficient pollinator. The insect spends very little time in non-contact investigation and a long time in direct contact with the plant. This maximizes the opportunity for pollen transfer per visit. Verdict: Highly beneficial for the plant.\n")

    # D. n(5)/hour >> n(3)/hour
    print("Choice D: (Frequency of feeding) >> (Frequency of interaction)")
    print("This is logically impossible. Every feeding event requires an interaction event to have started. You cannot have more feeding events than interaction events. Verdict: Impossible.\n")
    
    # E. n(1)/hour >> n(3)/hour
    print("Choice E: (Frequency of investigation) >> (Frequency of interaction)")
    print("This describes a 'window shopper' insect that rarely lands. It investigates often but seldom makes contact. This leads to very few pollination events. Verdict: Not beneficial for the plant.\n")

    # F. n(3)/hour >> n(1)/hour
    print("Choice F: (Frequency of interaction) >> (Frequency of investigation)")
    print("This is logically impossible. An interaction (contact) must be preceded by an investigation (non-contact approach). You cannot have more interactions than investigations. Verdict: Impossible.\n")

    print("Step 3: Conclusion\n")
    print("After eliminating the impossible and ineffective patterns, Choice C emerges as the clear winner.")
    print("The most positive effect on plant fitness comes from an insect that minimizes unproductive, non-contact time and maximizes productive, contact time.")
    print("This behavior is represented by a long interaction duration (time between event 4 and 3) compared to a short investigation duration (time between event 2 and 1).\n")
    print("The numbers in the most beneficial behavioral equation are 4, 3, 2, and 1.")
