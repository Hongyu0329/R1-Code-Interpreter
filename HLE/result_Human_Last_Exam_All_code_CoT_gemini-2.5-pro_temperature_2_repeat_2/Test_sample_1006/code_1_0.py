# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of a space X
# with two specific properties.

# 1. X is a compactification of the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
# 2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends uniquely to a
#    continuous function F: X -> R.

# These two properties, particularly the second one, are the defining
# characteristics of the Stone-Cech compactification of R, denoted as beta(R).

# The Stone-Cech compactification of a Tychonoff space (like R) is unique
# up to a homeomorphism that fixes the original space. This means that any two
# spaces, X1 and X2, that satisfy the given conditions must both be
# homeomorphic to beta(R).

# Since homeomorphism is an equivalence relation, if X1 is homeomorphic to beta(R)
# and X2 is homeomorphic to beta(R), then X1 is homeomorphic to X2.

# Therefore, all such spaces X belong to the same homeomorphism class.
# This leads to the following conclusion:
# Number of distinct homeomorphism classes = 1

number_of_classes = 1

# The final equation is simply the statement of this result.
# We print the number from this final conclusion.
