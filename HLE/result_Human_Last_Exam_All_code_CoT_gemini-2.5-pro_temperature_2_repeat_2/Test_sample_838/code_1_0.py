    # Step 1: Starting Material to Product A
    print("--- Step 1: Formation of Product A ---")
    print("Starting Material: [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, which is named (S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane.")
    print("Reaction: The starting material is reacted with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically bulky base. This promotes an E2 elimination reaction.")
    print("Outcome: Due to the large size of the t-BuOK base, it preferentially removes a proton from the more accessible terminal carbon (C4) instead of the internal carbon (C2). This is known as Hofmann elimination.")
    print("Product A is the resulting less-substituted alkene: 4-phenylbut-1-ene. The original chiral center is removed, making product A an achiral molecule.\n")

    # Step 2: Product A to Product B
    print("--- Step 2: Formation of Product B ---")
    print("Reaction: Product A (4-phenylbut-1-ene) is treated with borane (BH3) in THF, followed by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction.")
    print("Outcome: This reaction adds a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a hydrogen atom across the double bond with anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. The -OH group adds to the less substituted carbon of the double bond.")
    print("Product B is the primary alcohol: 4-phenylbutan-1-ol. This product is also achiral.\n")

    # Step 3: Product B to Product C
    print("--- Step 3: Formation of Product C ---")
    print("Reaction: Product B (4-phenylbutan-1-ol) is treated with phosphorous tribromide (PBr3).")
    print("Outcome: PBr3 is a standard reagent used to convert a primary alcohol into a primary alkyl bromide via an SN2-type substitution reaction.")
    print("Product C is the result of replacing the -OH group with a -Br atom.\n")

    # Final Product Identification
    print("--- Final Product Identification ---")
    print("The final product, C, is the result of the three-step synthesis.")
    print("IUPAC Name: 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.")
    print("Chirality Explanation: The initial stereocenter of the starting material was eliminated in the first reaction. No new stereocenters were created in the following steps. Therefore, the final product C, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is achiral.")
    print("\nFinal Answer:")
    print("<<<1-bromo-4-phenylbutane>>>")
