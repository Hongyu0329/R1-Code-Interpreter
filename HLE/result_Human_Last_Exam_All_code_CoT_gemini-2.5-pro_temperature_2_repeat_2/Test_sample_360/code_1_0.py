# The reaction involves a bridging ligand connecting two ruthenium centers.
# Product: [(bpy)2Ru-(dptt)-Ru(bpy)2]^(4+)
# Each [Ru(bpy)2] unit is a chiral center.
# We label the two possible chiral configurations as Delta (Δ) and Lambda (Λ).

# The resulting dinuclear complex has two such chiral centers, one at each Ru atom.
# We need to find the number of unique stereoisomers by combining the configurations.

# Isomer 1: Both centers have a Delta configuration.
# This is the homochiral (Δ,Δ) isomer.
homochiral_delta_delta_isomer = 1

# Isomer 2: Both centers have a Lambda configuration.
# This is the homochiral (Λ,Λ) isomer. It is the enantiomer (mirror image) of the (Δ,Δ) isomer.
homochiral_lambda_lambda_isomer = 1

# Isomer 3: One center is Delta and the other is Lambda.
# This is the heterochiral (Δ,Λ) isomer. Because the bridging ligand is symmetric,
# the (Λ,Δ) configuration is identical to the (Δ,Λ) configuration. This isomer is a meso compound (achiral).
meso_delta_lambda_isomer = 1

# The total number of isomers is the sum of these distinct stereoisomers.
# We have one (Δ,Δ) isomer, one (Λ,Λ) isomer, and one (Δ,Λ) isomer.
