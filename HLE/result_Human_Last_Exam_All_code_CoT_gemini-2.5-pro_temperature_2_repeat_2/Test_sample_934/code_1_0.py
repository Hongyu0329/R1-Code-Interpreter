    # Patient Information
    print("\n1. Patient Demographics and History:")
    print("- A 53-year-old woman.")
    print("- Major Risk Factors: Heavy smoker (2 packs/day for 20+ years) and alcohol use disorder.")
    print("- This risk profile is critically important for the diagnosis.")

    # Clinical Presentation
    print("\n2. Symptoms and Findings:")
    print("- Presents with 10/10 substernal chest pain and odynophagia (painful swallowing).")
    print("- Lab results show leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein, indicating inflammation.")
    print("- Imaging shows esophageal wall thickening and luminal narrowing, suggesting an infiltrative process.")
    print("- Key Negative Finding: Endoscopy is normal, showing no erythema, ulcers, plaques, or strictures on the mucosal surface.")

    # Evaluating the Options
    print("\n3. Evaluating the Differential Diagnoses:")
    print("- (A) Streptococcal & (E) Herpes esophagitis: Ruled out. Infectious causes characteristically produce visible lesions (ulcers, plaques) on endoscopy. A normal endoscopy makes these diagnoses highly unlikely.")
    print("- (D) GERD: Unlikely. The patient does not report classic GERD symptoms like heartburn. The severe findings on imaging (wall thickening) are not typical for uncomplicated GERD.")
    print("- (B) Esophageal Adenocarcinoma: Less likely. This cancer is strongly associated with a history of chronic GERD and Barrett's esophagus, which the patient does not have.")
    print("- (C) Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC): Most likely diagnosis. The patient's history contains the two strongest risk factors for SCC: heavy smoking and alcohol abuse. The symptoms of chest pain and odynophagia are classic. The wall thickening seen on imaging is consistent with an infiltrative cancer. An infiltrative SCC can grow within the submucosa without initially creating a visible lesion on the surface, explaining the normal endoscopy.")

    # Conclusion
    print("\n4. Conclusion:")
    print("The patient's overwhelming risk factor profile (smoking and alcohol) combined with symptoms and imaging findings strongly points towards Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma. The normal endoscopy, while unusual, does not rule out an infiltrative form of the disease.")
