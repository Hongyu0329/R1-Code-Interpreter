    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a plan to derive the relationship between the maximum norm and the covolume for squarefree natural numbers.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Problem:** This question belongs to the field of Geometry of Numbers, which studies lattices and convex bodies. We'll consider the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ where $N$ is a squarefree natural number. Since $N$ is positive and not a square, this is a real quadratic field. The degree is $n=2$.\n2.  **Define the Terms:**\n    *   We will interpret the **\"maximum norm\" ($k_{k,\\infty}$)** as the length of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice, measured using the $L_\\infty$ (or maximum) norm. This is a standard quantity in this field, often denoted $\\lambda_{1, \\infty}$.\n    *   The **\"covolume\" ($V$)** is the volume of the fundamental domain of the lattice formed by embedding the ring of integers of $K$ into $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This volume is given by $V = \\sqrt{|d_K|}$, where $d_K$ is the discriminant of the field $K$.\n3.  **Apply Minkowski's Theorem:** Minkowski's first theorem on convex bodies provides a relationship between the volume of a centrally symmetric convex set and the covolume of a lattice. It states that if the volume of such a set $C$ is greater than $2^n V$, it must contain a non-zero lattice point.\n4.  **Derive the Bound:**\n    *   We will use a square as our convex body, which corresponds to the $L_\\infty$ norm. A square centered at the origin with side length $2r$ is given by $C = \\{ (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : \\max(|x_1|, |x_2|) < r \\}$. The volume of this square is $(2r)^2 = 4r^2$.\n    *   If we set $r = k_{k,\\infty}$, this open square by definition contains no non-zero lattice points.\n    *   According to Minkowski's theorem, this implies that the volume of our square must be less than or equal to $2^n V$.\n    *   For our quadratic field, $n=2$. So, we get the inequality: $(2 \\cdot k_{k,\\infty})^2 \\le 2^2 \\cdot V$.\n    *   Simplifying this gives the final relationship: $(k_{k,\\infty})^2 \\le V$.\n    *   This provides an upper bound for $k_{k,\\infty}$, which is $k_{k,\\infty} \\le \\sqrt{V}$.\n\nThe Python code below will print the formula representing this relationship.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_upper_bound_relation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function displays the upper bound relationship for the maximum norm\n    in relation to the covolume for orders in real quadratic fields.\n\n    The relationship is derived from Minkowski's convex body theorem.\n    Let k_{k,∞} be the L-infinity norm of the shortest non-zero lattice vector,\n    and V be the covolume of the lattice. For a real quadratic field, the dimension n=2.\n\n    Minkowski's theorem, applied with a hypercube (the ball for the L-infinity norm), gives:\n    (2 * k_{k,∞})^n <= 2^n * V\n    which simplifies to:\n    (k_{k,∞})^n <= V\n\n    For n=2, this becomes:\n    (k_{k,∞})^2 <= V\n    This implies the upper bound for k_{k,∞} is sqrt(V).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The key number in the equation is the exponent.\n    power = 2\n\n    # Print the derived inequality.\n    print(\"The upper bound for the maximum norm (k_{k,∞}) in relation to the covolume (V) is given by the inequality:\")\n    print(f\"k_{{k,∞}} ^ {power} <= V\")\n    print(\"\\nThis means that the maximum norm is bounded above by the square root of the covolume:\")\n    print(f\"k_{{k,∞}} <= sqrt(V)\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    display_upper_bound_relation()\n```\n<<<sqrt(V)>>>"
