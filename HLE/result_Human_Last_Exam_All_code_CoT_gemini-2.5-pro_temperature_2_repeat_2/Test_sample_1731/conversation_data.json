    "This task requires us to derive the formulas for entropy and mean energy for a system of light quanta (photons). Photons are bosons, so they follow Bose-Einstein statistics. The derivation is based on the principles of statistical mechanics, which are deeply connected to large deviation theory.\n\n### Plan and Theoretical Framework\n\n1.  **System Definition**: We consider a system of photons, which are bosonic particles. The system has a set of discrete energy levels `ε_i`. Unlike massive particles, the total number of photons (`N`) is not conserved because they can be created and annihilated. The total energy `E = Σ n_i ε_i` is the primary constraint (for a system in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath, we work with the average energy `U`).\n\n2.  **Connection to Large Deviation Theory**:\n    *   **Boltzmann's Principle**: The entropy `S` of a macrostate is given by `S = k_B * ln(Ω)`, where `Ω` is the number of microstates corresponding to that macrostate.\n    *   **Large Deviation Principle**: The probability of observing a particular macrostate is exponentially proportional to its entropy, `P(macrostate) ∝ Ω = exp(S / k_B)`. In a large system, the equilibrium state is overwhelmingly the most probable one, which is the macrostate that maximizes the entropy `S`.\n    *   The theorems of Sanov and Chernoff provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for these ideas, showing how the probability of deviations from the most likely state (the equilibrium state) decreases exponentially.\n\n3.  **Method**: Our goal is to find the distribution of particles `{n_i}` among energy levels `{ε_i}` that maximizes the entropy `S` for bosons, subject to a fixed mean energy `U`. This procedure yields the Bose-Einstein distribution, from which we can calculate the equilibrium mean energy and entropy.\n\nThe process leads to the following key formulas for a gas of photons (where the chemical potential is zero). The python code below will print these final equilibrium equations and explain their components.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_bose_light_quanta():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and presents the equilibrium values (formulas) for\n    mean energy and entropy for a Bose gas of light quanta (photons), as\n    derived from the principles of statistical mechanics and large deviation theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Equilibrium Energy and Entropy for Light Quanta (Bose Gas) ###\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Theoretical Result: The Bose-Einstein Distribution ---\")\n    print(\"The starting point is the equilibrium distribution, which results from maximizing entropy.\")\n    print(\"The average number of photons, <n_i>, in a state with energy ε_i is:\")\n    print(\"\\n<n_i> = 1 / (exp(β * ε_i) - 1)\\n\")\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(\"  - ε_i: Energy of the i-th state.\")\n    print(\"  - β  : Inverse temperature, defined as 1 / (k_B * T).\")\n    print(\"  - k_B: Boltzmann's constant.\")\n    print(\"  - T  : Absolute temperature.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\\n--- 1.
