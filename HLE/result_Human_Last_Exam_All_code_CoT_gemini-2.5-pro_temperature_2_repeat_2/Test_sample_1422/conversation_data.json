    "To find the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the topological properties of the diagrams.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Establish Relationships:** I will use two fundamental formulas that relate the properties of a Feynman diagram:\n    *   A topological formula relating the number of loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V): `L = I - V + 1`.\n    *   A formula from the interaction type (`φ^n`), relating the number of lines per vertex (n), vertices (V), internal lines (I), and external lines (E): `n * V = 2 * I + E`.\n\n2.  **Combine Formulas:** I will combine these two formulas to get a single equation relating V, n, and E for the specific case of a two-loop diagram (L=2).\n\n3.  **Minimize Vertices:** To find the minimum number of vertices (V), I will analyze the combined formula. This involves considering the simplest interaction type (the standard `φ^4` theory where `n=4`) and the minimum number of external lines (E=0 for a vacuum diagram).\n\n4.  **Solve for V:** I will write a Python script that carries out this calculation step-by-step, printing out the equations and their solutions to find the final minimum value for V.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_diagram_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for a scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We are given the number of loops in the diagram.\n    L = 2\n    print(f\"Goal: Find the minimum vertices (V) for a diagram with {L} loops.\\n\")\n\n    # The standard model for a simple interacting scalar field is the phi-4 theory,\n    # where each vertex has 4 lines connected to it.\n    n = 4\n    print(f\"We will analyze the most common case: φ^{n} theory, where n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # We use two fundamental relationships for Feynman diagrams.\n    print(\"Step 1: Use the topological formula relating Loops (L), Internal Lines (I), and Vertices (V).\")\n    print(\"Formula: L = I - V + 1\")\n    print(f\"For L = {L}, we have: {L} = I - V + 1\")\n    print(\"Rearranging for I, we get: I = V + 1\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Use the vertex rule relating n, V, I, and External Lines (E).\")\n    print(\"Formula: n * V = 2 * I + E\")\n    print(f\"Substituting n = {n}, this becomes: {n} * V = 2 * I + E\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Combine the two formulas.\")\n    print(\"Substitute 'I = V + 1' into the vertex rule:\")\n    print(f\"{n} * V = 2 * (V + 1) + E\")\n    print(f\"{n} * V = 2 * V + 2 + E\")\n    print(f\"({n} - 2) * V = 2 + E\")\n    \n    # Substituting the value of n\n    print(f\"({n-2}) * V = 2 + E\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Solve for the minimum V.\")\n    print(\"To find the minimum number of vertices (V), we must choose the number\")\n    print(\"of external lines (E) that makes V as small as possible.\")\n    print(\"The minimum possible number of external lines is E = 0 (a vacuum diagram).\\n\")\n    \n    E = 0\n    print(f\"Plugging in E = {E}:\")\n    # Equation is (n-2)*V = 2 + E\n    lhs_coeff = n - 2\n    rhs = 2 + E\n    print(f\"{lhs_coeff} * V = {rhs}\")\n    \n    min_V = rhs // lhs_coeff\n    print(f\"V = {rhs} / {lhs_coeff}\")\n    print(f\"V = {min_V}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The minimum number of vertices required for a two-loop diagram is {min_V}.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to the 'figure-eight' vacuum diagram in φ^4 theory.\")\n\nsolve_feynman_diagram_vertices()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
