def calculate_neutrino_asymmetry():
    """
    This function demonstrates how CP violation in neutral kaon decays
    can lead to a neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry.

    The core idea rests on the decay of the long-lived neutral kaon, K_L^0.
    In the Standard Model, this particle exhibits CP violation, meaning it treats
    matter and antimatter differently.

    Specifically, the rate of decay into a positron and a neutrino is slightly
    higher than the rate of decay into an electron and an antineutrino. This
    difference, although small, is sufficient to generate a net asymmetry if a
    large number of such kaons decay, as would be the case in the early universe.

    This script calculates the outcome for a hypothetical sample of 1 billion
    K_L^0 decays, using measured values from particle physics experiments.
