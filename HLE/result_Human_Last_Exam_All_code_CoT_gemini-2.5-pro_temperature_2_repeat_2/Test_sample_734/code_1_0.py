    # Benjamin Breckinridge (B.B.) Warfield, a prominent Princeton theologian
    # from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, wrote extensively to defend
    # miracles in an age of scientific skepticism. He developed specialized
    # terminology, distinguishing between God's 'providential' work through
    # existing natural laws (mediate causation) and God's 'creative' or
    # 'immediate' work which could introduce new realities, like in the
    # virgin birth. This framework could also apply to systemic changes in
    # nature, such as those postulated to have occurred at the Fall, where God
    # would not be 'violating' his laws but rather re-establishing them on a new
    # basis.
