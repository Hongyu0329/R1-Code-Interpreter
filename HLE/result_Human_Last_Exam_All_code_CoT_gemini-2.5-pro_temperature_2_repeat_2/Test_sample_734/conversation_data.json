    "My plan is to first identify the correct theologian by searching for scholars who have written extensively on the intersection of theology, miracles, and the concept of \"laws of nature,\" particularly in the modern era where this concept was formalized. I will then structure the answer within a Python code block, using a print statement to display the name of the theologian as requested by the prompt format.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the theologian\n    who developed a specific framework to account for alterations\n    in natural law.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Benjamin Breckinridge (B.B.) Warfield, a prominent Princeton theologian\n    # from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, wrote extensively to defend\n    # miracles in an age of scientific skepticism. He developed specialized\n    # terminology, distinguishing between God's 'providential' work through\n    # existing natural laws (mediate causation) and God's 'creative' or\n    # 'immediate' work which could introduce new realities, like in the\n    # virgin birth. This framework could also apply to systemic changes in\n    # nature, such as those postulated to have occurred at the Fall, where God\n    # would not be 'violating' his laws but rather re-establishing them on a new\n    # basis.\n    \n    theologian_name = \"Benjamin Breckinridge (B.B.)

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
