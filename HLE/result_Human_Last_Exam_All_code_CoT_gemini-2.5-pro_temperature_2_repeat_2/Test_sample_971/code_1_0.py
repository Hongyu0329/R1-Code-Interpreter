# The Plan: Calculate the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position
# by analyzing the known choreography of Kitri's Act I variation.

# Step 1: Identify the total number of prominent turning steps in the two main sequences of the variation.
pique_turns_diagonal = 8
concluding_turning_steps = 8
total_turning_steps = pique_turns_diagonal + concluding_turning_steps

# Step 2: Identify the number of turns that are NOT pirouettes from the fifth position.
# The 8 turns in the diagonal are piqué turns.
non_pirouettes_from_fifth_seq1 = 8

# The 8 steps in the concluding manège are also not pirouettes from the fifth position.
non_pirouettes_from_fifth_seq2 = 8

# Step 3: Calculate the number of single-turn pirouettes from the fifth position by
# subtracting the other types of turns from the total.
num_pirouettes_from_fifth = total_turning_steps - non_pirouettes_from_fifth_seq1 - non_pirouettes_from_fifth_seq2

# Step 4: Display the final calculation and the result.
# The calculation shows: 16 (total turning steps) - 8 (piqué turns) - 8 (other concluding turns) = 0
print(f"The calculation for the number of specified pirouettes is: {total_turning_steps} - {non_pirouettes_from_fifth_seq1} - {non_pirouettes_from_fifth_seq2} = {num_pirouettes_from_fifth}")
