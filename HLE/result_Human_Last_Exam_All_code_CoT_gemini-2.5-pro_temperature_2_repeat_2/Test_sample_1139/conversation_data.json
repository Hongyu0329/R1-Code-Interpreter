    "To determine the number of non-Grassman variables for the specified physical system, we need to follow a plan based on the theory of supersymmetric sigma-models for disordered systems.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical space:** First, we identify the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model for the given symmetry class. For systems in symmetry class D with `n` replicas, the fields of the sigma-model are parametrized by the supermanifold `G/H = OSp(4n|4n) / (OSp(2n|2n) x OSp(2n|2n))`.\n2.  **Find the dimensionality formula:** The non-Grassman variables are the commuting, or bosonic, degrees of freedom. Their number is given by the dimension of the bosonic part of the supermanifold `G/H`. By calculating the dimensions of the corresponding Lie superalgebras, we find the number of bosonic variables to be `d_B = 8 * n^2`.\n3.  **Compute the result:** We are given `n=2` replicas. We will use a Python script to plug this value into the formula and compute the final number, showing the details of the calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_non_grassman_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with n replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas as specified in the problem\n    n = 2\n\n    # In symmetry class D, the target space is the supermanifold\n    # OSp(4n|4n) / (OSp(2n|2n) x OSp(2n|2n)).\n    # The number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables is given by the formula: 8 * n^2\n    coefficient = 8\n\n    # Calculate the number of variables\n    num_variables = coefficient * (n ** 2)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the calculation\n    print(\"The number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric sigma-model\")\n    print(\"with n replicas for symmetry class D is given by the formula: 8 * n^2.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFor n = {n} replicas, the calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{coefficient} * {n}**2 = {num_variables}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_non_grassman_variables()\n\n```\n<<<32>>>"
