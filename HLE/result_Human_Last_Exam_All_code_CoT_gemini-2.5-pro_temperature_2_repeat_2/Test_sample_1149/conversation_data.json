    "This is a question that requires looking up a specific anatomical fact from the field of paleontology. I will find this information from scientific literature and then present it in the requested Python code format.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the key anatomical feature and species: \"lacrimal recess\" and \"Irritator challengeri\".\n2.  Access paleontological data to find the number of depressions (also known as pneumatic foramina or fenestrae) in this specific area of the skull. The most authoritative source for this is the 2002 paper by Sues et al., \"Irritator challengeri, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\".\n3.  According to this source, the lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains two large pneumatic foramina (depressions).\n4.  Create a Python script that assigns this number to a variable and prints it in a clear, descriptive sentence, fulfilling the user's request.\n\n```python\ndef find_lacrimal_recess_depressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess\n    of the dinosaur Irritator challengeri based on scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Species in question\n    species = \"Irritator challengeri\"\n    \n    # Anatomical feature\n    feature_location = \"lacrimal recess\"\n    \n    # According to the 2002 description by Sues et al.,\n    # there are two large pneumatic foramina (depressions) in this recess.\n    number_of_depressions = 2\n    \n    # The \"equation\" here is simply the assignment of the known value.\n    print(f\"number_of_depressions = {number_of_depressions}\")\n    \n    # Print the final answer in a full sentence.\n    print(f\"The number of depressions the {feature_location} in {species} contains is: {number_of_depressions}\")\n\nfind_lacrimal_recess_depressions()\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
