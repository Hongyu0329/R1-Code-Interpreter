    "To determine the number of grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot with a minimal grid number (which is 3), we need to find all unique 3x3 grid diagrams representing this knot, considering translational and rotational symmetries.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Base Diagrams:** First, we identify the fundamental permutations of markings on a 3x3 grid that can form a trefoil knot. A grid diagram is defined by a permutation `p` and a list of signs `s` for the crossings. For a 3x3 grid, a minimal knot diagram is a trefoil if the signs are all the same (all 'X's or all 'O's). The left-hand trefoil corresponds to having all 'O' crossings (which we'll denote with `-1`).\n    Through combinatorial analysis and knot theory, it can be shown that there are two fundamental types of permutations on a 3x3 grid that yield a trefoil knot with uniform signing:\n    *   **Type A (3-cycle):** The permutation `p = [1, 2, 0]`, which corresponds to markings at `(0,1), (1,2), (2,0)`.\n    *   **Type B (transposition with a fixed point):** The permutation `p = [0, 2, 1]`, corresponding to markings at `(0,0), (1,2), (2,1)`.\n    So we have two candidate diagrams for the left-hand trefoil: `LHT_A = ([1, 2, 0], [-1, -1, -1])` and `LHT_B = ([0, 2, 1], [-1, -1, -1])`.\n\n2.  **Define Symmetries:** The allowed symmetries are translation (horizontal and vertical) and rotation. For an n x n grid, these operations transform a diagram `(p, s)`:\n    *   **Horizontal Translation `T_h(d)`:** `p'[i] = (p[i] + d) % n`. Signs are unchanged.\n    *   **Vertical Translation `T_v(c)`:** `p'[i] = p[(i - c) % n]`, `s'[i] = s[(i - c) % n]`. Note: This operation can change the knot type (e.g., from a knot to a link) and must be handled carefully. An equivalence is only valid if the resulting diagram is also a left-hand trefoil.\n    *   **180-degree Rotation `R_180`:** `p'[i] = (n - 1) - p[(n - 1 - i) % n]`, `s'[i] = s[(n - 1 - i) % n]`.\n    *   90-degree rotations are excluded as they interchange the knot with its mirror image (e.g., left-hand to right-hand trefoil).\n\n3.  **Check for Equivalence:** Two diagrams are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a sequence of these valid symmetry operations. We can check this by generating the entire set of diagrams equivalent to `LHT_A` (its \"orbit\") and seeing if `LHT_B` is in that set. A systematic way is to define a \"canonical form\" for each orbit (e.g., the lexicographically smallest diagram in it) and check if `LHT_A` and `LHT_B` have the same canonical form.\n\n4.  **Execute and Conclude:** We will implement this process to determine if the two types of diagrams belong to the same equivalence class or different ones.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef apply_r180(p, s):\n    \"\"\"Applies a 180-degree rotation to a 3x3 grid diagram.\"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    p_new = [0] * n\n    s_new = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        p_new[i] = (n - 1) - p[(n - 1 - i) % n]\n        s_new[i] = s[(n - 1 - i) % n]\n    return (p_new, s_new)\n\ndef apply_tv(p, s, c):\n    \"\"\"Applies a vertical translation.\"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    p_new = [p[(i - c) % n] for i in range(n)]\n    s_new = [s[(i - c) % n] for i in range(n)]\n    return (p_new, s_new)\n\ndef apply_th(p, s, d):\n    \"\"\"Applies a horizontal translation.\"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    p_new = [(x + d) % n for x in p]\n    # signs are attached to rows, so they don't change with horizontal shift\n    s_new = s[:]\n    return (p_new, s_new)\n\ndef get_orbit(p_start, s_start):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the full orbit of a diagram under translation and R180 rotation.\n    This includes compositions of the operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    orbit = set()\n    to_process = [(p_start, s_start)]\n    processed = set()\n\n    while to_process:\n        p, s = to_process.pop(0)\n        \n        # Using tuple for permutations to make them hashable\n        if (tuple(p), tuple(s)) in processed:\n            continue\n        \n        processed.add((tuple(p), tuple(s)))\n        orbit.add((tuple(p), tuple(s)))\n\n        # Apply R180\n        p_r, s_r = apply_r180(p, s)\n        to_process.append((p_r, s_r))\n\n        # Apply translations\n        for c in range(1, 3):\n            p_v, s_v = apply_tv(p, s, c)\n            to_process.append((p_v, s_v))\n        for d in range(1, 3):\n            p_h, s_h = apply_th(p, s, d)\n            to_process.append((p_h, s_h))\n\n    return orbit\n\n\ndef get_canonical_form(p, s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the canonical representative for a diagram's equivalence class.\n    Note: We only need to generate the set of permutations in the orbit,\n    as the signing [-1, -1, -1] is invariant under these symmetries.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A simplified orbit generation for permutations only\n    # Signatures are constant for these diagrams under the chosen symmetries\n    \n    perms_to_process = [p]\n    perms_in_orbit = {tuple(p)}\n\n    head = 0\n    while head < len(perms_to_process):\n        current_p = perms_to_process[head]\n        head += 1\n\n        # R180\n        p_r, _ = apply_r180(current_p, s)\n        if tuple(p_r) not in perms_in_orbit:\n            perms_in_orbit.add(tuple(p_r))\n            perms_to_process.append(p_r)\n\n        # Translations\n        for c in range(1, 3):\n             p_v, _ = apply_tv(current_p, s, c)\n             if tuple(p_v) not in perms_in_orbit:\n                perms_in_orbit.add(tuple(p_v))\n                perms_to_process.append(p_v)\n        for d in range(1, 3):\n             p_h, _ = apply_th(current_p, s, d)\n             if tuple(p_h) not in perms_in_orbit:\n                perms_in_orbit.add(tuple(p_h))\n                perms_to_process.append(p_h)\n    \n    # Sort and return the lexicographically smallest\n    return sorted(list(perms_in_orbit))[0]\n\n\n# --- Main Logic ---\n\n# Two fundamental types of diagrams for the LHT.\nlht_signing = [-1, -1, -1]\np_type_A = [1, 2, 0] # Represents a 3-cycle permutation\np_type_B = [0, 2, 1] # Represents a transposition\n\nprint(\"Finding equivalence classes for minimal LHT grid diagrams...\")\nprint(\"Two candidate types of diagrams have been identified:\")\nprint(f\"1.
