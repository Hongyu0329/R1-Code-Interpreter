    # A coalition facing "arbitrary opposition" must choose a path that cannot be blocked.

    #   states controlling over 1/3 of the House of Representatives.
    # - Proposal by National Convention (called by 2/3 of states) depends only on the number
    #   of states, not population. This is the guaranteed path.
