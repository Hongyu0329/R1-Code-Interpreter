# Plan:
# 1. Identify the relationship between R=3.57 and the desired equilibrium point X_eq=1.05.
#    R / X_eq = 3.57 / 1.05 = 3.4. This suggests a new rule for the equilibrium point: X_eq = R / 3.4.
# 2. Design a new map that has this equilibrium point and is stable, replacing the chaotic behavior.
#    A simple quadratic map with a superstable fixed point X_eq (where the derivative is 0) can be of the form:
#    X_n+1 = X_eq - R * (X_n - X_eq)^2.
# 3. Substitute X_eq = R / 3.4 into this form to get the final modified logistic map.
# 4. Write Python code to demonstrate this. The code will print the new equation and show that iterating
#    the map from a starting point converges to the new equilibrium point.

# Set the parameter R
