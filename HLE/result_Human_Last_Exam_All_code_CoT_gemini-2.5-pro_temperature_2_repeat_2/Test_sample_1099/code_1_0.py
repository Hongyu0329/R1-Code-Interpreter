# This script calculates the minimal average resources required to simulate
# the correlations of a singlet quantum state using a local hidden variable model.

# Step 1: Define the CHSH values for the different models.
# The classical limit for any local hidden variable (LHV) model.
S_LHV = 2.0
# The quantum mechanical limit (Tsirelson's bound), achieved by a singlet state. This is our simulation target.
S_QUANTUM = 2 * math.sqrt(2)
# The limit for a non-local model using a single PR-Box or 1 bit of communication.
S_NONLOCAL = 4.0

# Step 2: Formulate the simulation as a probabilistic mixture.
# We want to find the minimal probability 'p' of using the non-local resource
# such that the average CHSH value matches the quantum limit.
# The governing equation is: S_QUANTUM = p * S_NONLOCAL + (1 - p) * S_LHV
# Solving for p: p = (S_QUANTUM - S_LHV) / (S_NONLOCAL - S_LHV)

p = (S_QUANTUM - S_LHV) / (S_NONLOCAL - S_LHV)

# Step 3: Display the results for each type of resource.
