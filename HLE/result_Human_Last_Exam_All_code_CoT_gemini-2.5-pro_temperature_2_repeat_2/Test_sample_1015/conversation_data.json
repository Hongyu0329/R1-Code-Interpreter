    "I will create a Python script to solve this. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Store Data**: I'll use Python dictionaries to hold the key characteristics of a *cambré derrière* in both the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n2.  **Analyze and Compare**: The script will print a description of the movement in each style, highlighting the primary points of divergence.\n3.  **Evaluate Options**: By comparing the established differences to the given multiple-choice options, the script will identify the most accurate answer.\n4.  **Print Conclusion**: Finally, the script will print the chosen answer and the reasoning behind it. This approach uses a coding structure to logically arrive at the correct answer for the knowledge-based question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the differences between a cambré derrière\n    in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods to select the correct answer\n    from a list of options.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the characteristics of each style's cambré derrière.\n    vaganova_style = {\n        'name': 'Vaganova',\n        'hip_placement': 'Hips must remain square and level, aligned over the supporting legs.
