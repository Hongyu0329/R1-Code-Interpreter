    "Of course. Here is a plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will identify the specific self-portrait painted by Curt Querner in 1933 after his encounter with the Gestapo. Then, I will research the painting to find what object he is holding and what it symbolizes. Finally, I will use a Python script to present the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n  \"\"\"\n  painting_title = \"Self-Portrait with Thistle\"\n  artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n  year = 1933\n  symbol = \"a thistle\"\n  meaning = \"a symbol of resistance and defiance\"\n\n  print(f\"In his {year} self-portrait, '{painting_title}', Curt Querner holds {symbol} in his hand.\")\n  print(f\"The prickly and resilient plant serves as {meaning} following his escape from the Gestapo.\")\n\nfind_symbol()\n```\n<<<a thistle>>>"
