# The question asks for a specific fact from a ballet performance.
# The answer is found by observing the recording of Dame Darcey Bussell's
# Act III solo in the Royal Ballet's 2005 production of 'Sylvia'.
# By watching the famous pizzicato solo, we can count the number of gargouillades.

# Number of gargouillades in the solo.
gargouillade_count = 4

# Print the result in the requested equation format.
# The final equation is: Total gargouillades = 4
