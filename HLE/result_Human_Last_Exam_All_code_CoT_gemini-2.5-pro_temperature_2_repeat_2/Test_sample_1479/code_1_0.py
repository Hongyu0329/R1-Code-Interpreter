    # --- Type-1 Fuzzy Logic ---
    print("1. Type-1 Membership Function (2-Dimensional Structure)")
    print("   - A Type-1 MF maps a crisp input from the universe of discourse (let's call it 'x')")
    print("     to a crisp membership value between 0 and 1 (let's call it 'primary_membership').")

    print("   - Example: MF(temperature=25Â°C) -> 0.8")
    print("   - This creates a 2D relationship: (Input Axis, Membership Axis)\n")

    # --- Type-2 Fuzzy Logic ---
    print("2. Type-2 Membership Function (3-Dimensional Structure)")
    print("   - A Type-2 MF handles uncertainty about the Type-1 membership value.")
    print("   - For each input 'x', the membership is not a single value but a Type-1 fuzzy set.")

    print("     (x, primary_membership) -> secondary_membership")
    print("   - This creates a 3D structure: (Input Axis, Primary Membership Axis, Secondary Membership Axis)\n")

    # --- Type-3 Fuzzy Logic ---
    print("3. Type-3 Membership Function (4-Dimensional Structure)")
    print("   - A Type-3 MF adds another layer of uncertainty, addressing vagueness in the Type-2 secondary grades.")
    print("   - For each input 'x', the membership is a Type-2 fuzzy set.")
    print("   - This requires the introduction of a new function: the *Tertiary Membership Function*.")
    print("   - This tertiary MF maps each potential 'secondary_membership' value to a 'tertiary_membership' grade.")

    print("The fundamental difference in dimensional structure when moving from Type-2 to Type-3 is not just about")
