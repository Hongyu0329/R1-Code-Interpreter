# The problem involves finding the Chern number of a junction of two Chern insulators.
# The Chern number is an additive topological invariant. When two systems are combined
# without closing the bulk gap, the Chern number of the new system is the sum of the
# individual Chern numbers.

# Chern number of the first insulator
C1 = 1

# Chern number of the second insulator
C2 = 1

# Calculate the Chern number of the junction
C_junction = C1 + C2

# Print the explanation and the final equation
print("The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.")
print(f"C_junction = C1 + C2")
print(f"C_junction = {C1} + {C2} = {C_junction}")
