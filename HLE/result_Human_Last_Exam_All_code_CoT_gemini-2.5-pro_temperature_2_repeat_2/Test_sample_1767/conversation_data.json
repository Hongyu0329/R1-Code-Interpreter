    "The task is to determine the Chern number of a composite system formed by two Chern insulators. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The Chern number is a topological invariant that, for simple cases of joining two systems without closing the bulk energy gap, is additive. When two Chern insulators are joined laterally with a negligible barrier, they effectively form a single, larger system.\n2.  **Define the initial values:** We are given two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number (C) of 1.\n3.  **Calculate the total Chern number:** The Chern number of the combined system (the junction) is the sum of the individual Chern numbers. So, C_junction = C1 + C2.\n4.  **Create a Python script:** The script will perform this simple addition and print the calculation step-by-step, showing the final equation and result as requested.\n\n```python\n# The problem involves finding the Chern number of a junction of two Chern insulators.\n# The Chern number is an additive topological invariant. When two systems are combined\n# without closing the bulk gap, the Chern number of the new system is the sum of the\n# individual Chern numbers.\n\n# Chern number of the first insulator\nC1 = 1\n\n# Chern number of the second insulator\nC2 = 1\n\n# Calculate the Chern number of the junction\nC_junction = C1 + C2\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation\nprint(\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_junction = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_junction = {C1} + {C2} = {C_junction}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 that connects laterally and have negligible tunneling barrier, what is the Chern number of this junction. \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
