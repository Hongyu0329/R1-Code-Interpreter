    "Of course. Here is a plan to answer your question using a Python script.\n\nThis is a biological question, not a computational one. The plan is to use a Python script to store and present the anatomical information clearly.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the main brain region in your question: the palliovisceral lobe.\n2.  Based on cephalopod neuroanatomy, identify the brain regions located posteriorly to it. The primary regions are the Giant Fiber Lobe (from which giant axons originate for jet propulsion) and the Posterior Chromatophore Lobes (which are involved in controlling skin patterns).\n3.  The Python script will store these names in variables.\n4.  The script will then print out the answer in a sentence. To satisfy the request for an \"equation,\" it will also display the relationship in a formulaic way, where \"+\" signifies \"and\".\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions adjacent posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The primary lobe in question\n    main_lobe = \"Palliovisceral Lobe\"\n\n    # The lobes lying posteriorly to the main lobe\n    posterior_adjacent_lobes = [\"Giant Fiber Lobe\", \"Posterior Chromatophore Lobes\"]\n\n    # Print the answer in a descriptive sentence\n    print(f\"In the brain of the dwarf cuttlefish, the key regions lying adjacent posteriorly to the {main_lobe} are:\")\n    for lobe in posterior_adjacent_lobes:\n        print(f\"- {lobe}\")\n\n    # To satisfy the formatting request, we present the relationship as an \"equation\".\n    # This fulfills the \"output each number [component] in the final equation\" instruction.\n    print(\"\\nThis relationship can be shown as:\")\n    equation_string = f\"Regions Posterior to {main_lobe} = {posterior_adjacent_lobes[0]} + {posterior_adjacent_lobes[1]}\"\n    print(equation_string)\n\n# Execute the function\nget_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the Giant Fiber Lobe and the Posterior Chromatophore Lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
