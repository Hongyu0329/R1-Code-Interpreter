    print("Statement A: Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE.")
    print("The SVM margin is defined by hyperplanes that are pushed apart until they hit the closest points of each class. These points are the support vectors. To define a margin *between* two classes, you fundamentally need points from both classes to constrain the boundary.\n")
    
    print("Statement B: With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE.")
    print("This is a common technique known as cost-sensitive or weighted SVM. By applying a higher penalty (C parameter) for misclassification of the minority class, the model is forced to create a boundary that is more sensitive to that class. This effectively results in an asymmetric margin that can lead to a better overall classifier.\n")

    print("Statement C: Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE.")
    print("This is achieved via the 'kernel trick'. For example, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel allows SVM to operate in an infinite-dimensional feature space. The trick is that the algorithm only needs the dot products between data points in that high-dimensional space, and the kernel function can compute these dot products efficiently without ever creating the feature vectors explicitly.\n")

    print("Statement D: It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE.")
    print("The SVM decision boundary is defined *only* by the support vectors (the points closest to the boundary). Any data point that is correctly classified and is not on the margin (an 'interior point') does not influence the boundary's position. You can add or move such points, and as long as they don't become support vectors, the decision boundary remains unchanged.\n")

    print("Statement E: Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer.")
    print("Analysis: FALSE.")
    print("This is a common misconception. While it's true that if a global minimum *exists* for a strictly convex function, it must be unique. However, the existence of a minimum is not guaranteed.")
    print("A simple counterexample is the function f(x) = e^x.")
    print(" - The second derivative of f(x) is f''(x) = e^x, which is greater than 0 for all x. This proves the function is strictly convex.")
    print(" - However, the function's value approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity, but it never reaches 0 or a negative value. Therefore, it has no global minimum.")
    print("Because we have found a counterexample, this statement is false.\n")
