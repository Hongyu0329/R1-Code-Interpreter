    "This problem asks for the connectivity of the map $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. To solve this, we will follow a multi-step plan that relies on fundamental theorems of algebraic topology, specifically those concerning the connectivity of spaces under standard constructions (loop space, suspension, smash product) and the relationship between a map and its adjoint.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Base Spaces and Rules:** We'll start by defining the connectivity of the basic spaces involved, $S^4$ and $S^6$. The connectivity of a space tells us the highest dimension in which all homotopy groups vanish. We'll use the following standard rules:\n    *   The sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n    *   The loop space $\\Omega X$ of a $c$-connected space $X$ is $(c-1)$-connected.\n    *   The suspension $\\Sigma X$ of a $c$-connected space $X$ is $(c+1)$-connected.\n    *   The smash product $X \\wedge Y$ of a $c_1$-connected space $X$ and a $c_2$-connected space $Y$ is $(c_1+c_2+1)$-connected.\n\n2.  **Determine Connectivity of Source and Target:** Using these rules, we will calculate the connectivity of the source space, $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, and the target space, $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, of the map $\\phi$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Adjoint Map:** The map $\\phi$ has an adjoint, which we'll call $\\psi$. The relationship is given by the adjunction $[\\Sigma A, B] \\cong [A, \\Omega B]$. In our case, $\\phi: \\Sigma U \\to \\Omega V$ has an adjoint $\\psi: \\Sigma^2 U \\to V$, where $U = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ and $V = S^4 \\wedge S^6$. This adjoint map $\\psi$ is easier to analyze.\n\n4.  **Find the Connectivity of the Adjoint Map ($\\psi$):** We will determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces of $\\psi$. The map $\\psi$ is constructed from fundamental evaluation maps and is known to be an isomorphism on the lowest-dimensional non-trivial homotopy groups. This allows us to determine its connectivity.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Connectivity:** Finally, we'll use a theorem that relates the connectivity of a map to its adjoint. This involves the connectivity of the adjoint map ($\\psi$) and the connectivity of the domain of the adjoint map ($\\Sigma U$). The formula is that the connectivity of $\\phi$ is one greater than the connectivity of its fiber, which can be determined from the fiber of $\\psi$.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan, calculating the required values step-by-step and printing the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass TopSpace:\n    \"\"\"A class to represent a topological space and its connectivity.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, name, connectivity):\n        self.name = name\n        self.connectivity = connectivity\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Space '{self.name}' (connectivity: {self.connectivity})\"\n\ndef omega(space):\n    \"\"\"Calculates connectivity of the loop space.\"\"\"\n    return TopSpace(f\"Omega({space.name})\", space.connectivity -
