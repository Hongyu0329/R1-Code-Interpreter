    "In a classical Prisoner's Dilemma, the dominant strategy for both players is to \"Defect,\" leading to a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium where both receive a low payoff. However, when the game is played in a quantum setting, this dilemma can be resolved.\n\nBy setting up the game with a maximally entangled initial state and allowing players to use quantum strategies (represented by unitary operations on their respective qubits), a new, superior Nash Equilibrium can emerge.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Model Setup**: We model the game using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. The initial state of the two players' qubits is a maximally entangled Bell state.\n2.  **Define Strategies**: The players' strategies are $SU(2)$ operators.\n    *   **Cooperate (C)**: The identity operator, `I`.\n    *   **Defect (D)**: The quantum `NOT` gate (specifically, `i` times the Pauli-X matrix).\n    *   **Quantum Strategy (Q)**: A special \"miracle move,\" which is `i` times the Pauli-Z matrix.\n3.  **Calculate Equilibrium**: We will show that when both players choose the quantum strategy `Q`, their payoff is maximized to `(5, 5)`.\n4.  **Verify Stability**: We then demonstrate this is a Nash Equilibrium by showing that if a player unilaterally changes their strategy from `Q` to either `C` or `D`, their payoff decreases. Thus, there is no incentive to deviate.\n5.  **Present Equation**: Finally, we will present the explicit calculation for the equilibrium payoff, as requested.\n\nThe Python code below implements this model to calculate the payoffs and demonstrate the stability of the quantum equilibrium.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Prisoner's Dilemma in a quantum setting to find the equilibrium point.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define basis states and Pauli matrices (quantum gates)\n    I = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]], dtype=complex)\n    sx = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=complex)\n    sz = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]], dtype=complex)\n\n    ket00 = np.array([[1], [0], [0], [0]], dtype=complex)\n\n    # Define the players' strategies as unitary operators\n    # Cooperate strategy\n    C = I\n    # Defect strategy\n    D = 1j * sx\n    # Quantum \"miracle move\" strategy\n    Q = 1j * sz\n\n    # Setup the game using the EWL protocol\n    # J is the entangling operator that creates the initial state from |00>\n    J = (1 / np.sqrt(2)) * (np.kron(I, I) + 1j * np.kron(sx, sx))\n    # J_dag is the disentangling operator\n    J_dag = J.conj().T\n\n    # Payoff matrix V = (Alice's payoff, Bob's payoff)\n    # The four outcomes are (Cooperate, Cooperate), (Cooperate, Defect),\n    # (Defect, Cooperate), and (Defect, Defect).\n    payoff_values = {\n        'A': np.array([5, 0, 7, 1]), # Payoffs for Alice\n        'B': np.array([5, 7, 0, 1])  # Payoffs for Bob\n    }\n\n    def calculate_payoffs(U_A, U_B, U_A_name, U_B_name):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates and returns the expected payoffs for Alice and Bob for given strategies.\n        \n        The final state is calculated as: |psi_f> = J_dag * (U_A kron U_B) * J * |00>\n        \"\"\"\n        U = np.kron(U_A, U_B)\n        psi_final = J_dag @ U @ J @ ket00\n\n        # Probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the final state's amplitudes\n        probs = np.abs(psi_final.flatten())**2\n\n        # Expected payoffs are the sum of (probability * payoff) for each outcome\n        payoff_A = np.sum(probs * payoff_values['A'])\n        payoff_B = np.sum(probs * payoff_values['B'])\n\n        return payoff_A, payoff_B, probs\n\n    # --- Analysis ---\n    print(\"Analyzing payoffs for different strategy pairs...\")\n\n    # 1.
