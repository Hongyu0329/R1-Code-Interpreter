    omega_as (float): The detected anti-Stokes frequency.

# --- Example ---
# Let's assume we are using a narrowband Stokes laser with a frequency
# corresponding to a wavelength of 1064 nm.
# Frequency is c / lambda, but let's use wavenumbers (cm^-1) which are
# proportional to frequency and common in spectroscopy.
# Wavenumber = 1 / lambda (in cm)
omega_s_wavenumber = 1e7 / 1064  # Corresponds to 1064 nm in wavenumbers (cm^-1)

# Now, let's say our spectrometer detects an anti-Stokes signal
# at a wavelength of 660 nm.
omega_as_wavenumber = 1e7 / 660 # Corresponds to 660 nm in wavenumbers (cm^-1)

# We can now find the specific vibration (Omega) that created this signal.
# Each different detected omega_as corresponds to a distinguishable Omega.
