    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph Structure**: First, I will define the structure of the specified barbell graph. A barbell graph with 10 nodes is most commonly understood as two equal-sized complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge, which acts as a bottleneck. For 10 nodes, this means we have two cliques of 5 nodes each (`Kâ‚…`).\n\n2.  **Understand the Gossiping Process**: I will analyze the \"randomized uniform gossiping\" process. This process involves two steps:\n    a. A node is selected uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph.\n    b. One of its neighbors is then selected uniformly at random.\n    The edge connecting this pair is the \"sampled\" edge.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability**: My main goal is to calculate the probability that this sampled edge is the bottleneck edge. This can happen in two ways:\n    a. We select the bottleneck node in the first clique and then its neighbor across the bridge.\n    b. We select the bottleneck node in the second clique and then its neighbor across the bridge.\n    I will calculate the probability of each scenario and sum them up to get the total probability.\n\n4.  **Implement the Calculation**: To do this, I need the following values:\n    *   The total number of nodes (`N=10`).\n    *   The degree of each of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge. Each of these nodes is connected to 4 other nodes within its own 5-node clique and 1 node across the bridge, making their degree `4 + 1 = 5`.\n    The probability formula for sampling an edge `(u, v)` is `P(u, v) = (1/N) * (1/degree(u)) + (1/N) * (1/degree(v))`.\n\n5.  **Generate the Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that implements this calculation. The script will define the parameters, compute the probability, and print out the equation with all the numbers, along with the final result.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef calculate_bottleneck_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph\n    with 10 nodes using randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n    The barbell graph is assumed to be two K_5 cliques connected by one edge.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
