# Step 1: Define the core technical elements of the question.
# The question describes a specific preparation for a pirouette (a turn on one leg).
# - Starting Position: Fourth position (feet are apart, one in front of the other).
# - Leg Action: Bent knees (a 'plié'), which is standard for generating power.
# - Arm Position: 'Allongé', which means elongated or outstretched, rather than rounded.

# Step 2: Analyze the schools/methods mentioned.
# We will evaluate which schools are known for this specific arm position during preparation.

# - School of American Ballet (SAB): Teaches the Balanchine Method. This method is famously and uniquely characterized by a pirouette preparation from fourth position with deep bent knees and distinctly outstretched, 'allongé' arms. This is a signature of the Balanchine style. Any correct answer must therefore include the School of American Ballet. This eliminates choices A, C, and D.

# - Vaganova Academy (Russian) and La Scala (Italian/Cecchetti): These methods typically use preparations with rounded arms to create and maintain a strong core "frame" before the turn. They are not known for an 'allongé' preparation.

# - The Royal Ballet School (English): This school's method is a hybrid and does not have the 'allongé' pirouette prep as a defining characteristic.

# - Paris Opera Ballet School (French): The French style places a very high value on elegance, musicality, and elongated lines. The concept of 'allongé' is fundamental to its aesthetic of 'port de bras' (carriage of the arms). Therefore, the use of an outstretched, open arm position in preparation for a turn is very characteristic of the French style.

# Step 3: Evaluate the remaining choices.
# We are left with two options that include the School of American Ballet:
# B. Paris Opera Ballet School and School of American Ballet
# E. The Royal Ballet School and School of American Ballet

# Step 4: Determine the best pairing.
# Based on the analysis, both the Balanchine method (SAB) and the French school (Paris Opera) are characterized by the use of elongated, 'allongé' lines. This specific preparation is a signature of SAB and stylistically consistent and characteristic of the Paris Opera Ballet School. This makes them the best-matched pair.

print("The Paris Opera Ballet School (teaching the French method) also emphasizes elongated lines, and an 'allongé' arm position is a characteristic element of its style, making this pair the most accurate choice.")
