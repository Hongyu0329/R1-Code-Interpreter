    "To determine the number of colors that can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Major Allotropes**: I will list the primary, well-established allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  **Determine Observable Colors**: For each allotrope, I will identify its characteristic color(s) as they are typically observed. This includes variations due to purity or environmental interaction (like light exposure or chemiluminescence).\n3.  **Count Unique Colors**: I will compile a list of all unique colors identified in the previous step.\n4.  **Construct the Final Output**: The code will print an explanation of each allotrope's color(s) and then display the count as a sum, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of observable colors in phosphorus allotropes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify allotropes and their observable colors.\n    # White phosphorus (P4) can appear white or degrade to yellow.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
