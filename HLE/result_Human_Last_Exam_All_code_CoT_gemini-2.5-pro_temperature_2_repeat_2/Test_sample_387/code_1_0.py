# Step 1: Define the generators of the log ideal I.
# The log point P has a log structure given by the monoid N^3.
# The log ideal I is generated by the vectors v1 = (1,0,0) and v2 = (0,1,0).
v1 = np.array([1, 0, 0])
v2 = np.array([0, 1, 0])

print("The log ideal is generated by the following vectors in N^3:")
print(f"v1 = {v1}")
print(f"v2 = {v2}")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 2: Explain the geometric construction of the log blowup.
# The log blowup of a log point is a toric variety. The fan of this variety
# is constructed from the convex hull of the ideal's generators.
# The dimension of the resulting space is the dimension of the maximal cone in this fan.
# The maximal cone is spanned by the generator vectors themselves.
print("The dimension of the log blowup is the dimension of the maximal cone in its associated fan.")
print("This maximal cone is spanned by the ideal generators.")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 3: Calculate the dimension of the space spanned by the generators.
# This is equivalent to finding the rank of the matrix formed by these vectors.
# Let M be the matrix whose rows are the generator vectors.
M = np.array([v1, v2])

print("We form a matrix M with these vectors:")
print(M)
print("-" * 40)

# The rank of matrix M gives the dimension of the cone.
dimension = np.linalg.matrix_rank(M)

# Step 4: Output the final equation and answer.
print("The dimension is the rank of matrix M.")
