    This function identifies the incorrect or inappropriate explanations for the
    increase in university entrants in Japan.
    
    A. The decrease in the 18-year-old population was smaller than predicted: This is factually incorrect.
       The demographic decline was sharp and largely as predicted.
    B. Increase in university enrollment rate: This is a correct and primary explanation.
    C. Increased demand for re-learning by working adults: This is a real but minor trend, not a major cause.
    D. Diversification of higher education: This is an inappropriate characterization. Other institutions
       compete with, rather than primarily feed, four-year universities in a way that would explain growth.
    E. Government policies: This is a correct explanation regarding the supply-side increase in universities.
    
    The incorrect or inappropriate options are A and D.
