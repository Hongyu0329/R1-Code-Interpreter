    print("\nStep 1: Make an Assumption")
    print("Let's assume for a moment that a program `P` that computes `def_superfast(10000)` does exist.")
    print("Let's call the integer value this program `P` computes 'V'. So, V = def_superfast(10000).")
    
    print("\nStep 2: Use the Provided Definition")
    print("According to the pseudo-code, def_superfast(10000) returns 'Huge_int + 1'.")
    print("Here, 'Huge_int' is the largest integer returned by any Python program with a source code shorter than 10000 characters.")
    print("This gives us our first key equation: V = Huge_int + 1.")
    
    print("\nStep 3: Construct a New Program")
    print("Now, let's write a new, very simple Python program. Let's call it 'Q'.")
    print("The source code of program `Q` is just one line: print(V)")
    print("This program is valid and returns the integer V when executed.")

    print("\nStep 4: Analyze Program Q")
    print("The length of program Q's source code is very small. It's just the text 'print()' plus the digits of the number V.")
    print("This length will certainly be less than 10000 characters.")
    print("Therefore, program `Q` is one of the programs that must be considered in the definition of `Huge_int`.")

    print("\nStep 5: The Consequence")
    print("By definition, `Huge_int` is the absolute largest integer that any of these short programs can return.")
    print("Since our program `Q` returns the integer V, the value of `Huge_int` must be at least as large as V.")
    print("This gives us our second key inequality: Huge_int >= V.")

    print("\nStep 6: The Contradiction")
    print("Our assumption has led us to two conflicting statements:")
    print("  1. From Step 2: V = Huge_int + 1")
    print("  2. From Step 5: Huge_int >= V")

    the_number_one = 1
    
    print(f"   {huge_int_variable_name} >= {huge_int_variable_name} + {the_number_one}")

    print("\nThis statement is a logical impossibility. A number cannot be greater than or equal to itself plus 1.")
    
    print("\n--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("Because our initial assumption (that program `P` exists) leads to a clear contradiction, the assumption must be false.")
    print("Therefore, no program P can compute def_superfast(10000).")
