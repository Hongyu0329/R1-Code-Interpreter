    # --- Step-by-Step Reasoning ---
    print("Step 1: Understand the starting material, Ce2@C80.")
    print("         - The '@' symbol indicates that two Cerium (Ce) atoms are trapped inside a C80 fullerene cage.")
    print("         - These are called endohedral metallofullerenes.")
    print()
    print("Step 2: Understand the reaction.")
    print("         - The disilirane reacts on the exterior of the fullerene cage (exohedral functionalization).")
    print("         - The cerium atoms cannot pass through the carbon cage and do not directly interact with the external reagent.")
    print()
    print("Step 3: Analyze the electronic structure changes.")
    print("         - The two cerium atoms each donate electrons to the cage, becoming positive ions (e.g., Ce^3+).")
    print("         - The C80 cage becomes a negative ion (e.g., C80^6-).")
    print("         - The addition of the disilirane derivative to the 'equator' of the C80 cage disrupts the delocalized electrons in that region, creating sp3 carbons and reducing the local negative charge.")
    print()
    print("Step 4: Deduce the new positions of the cerium atoms.")
    print("         - The positively charged cerium ions are attracted to regions of highest negative charge.")
    print("         - Since the 'equator' has become less negative, the cerium ions will be repelled from it.")
    print("         - To reach the most stable, lowest-energy state, the cerium ions will move as far as possible from the equatorial reaction site.")
    print("         - The points furthest from the equator of a sphere are its poles.")
    print()
    print("Conclusion: The reaction on the outside of the cage causes the internal cerium atoms to become fixed in position at the poles.")

    # --- Evaluating the Answer Choices ---
    # A. The disilirane coordinates to the cerium atoms... -> Impossible, atoms are inside, reagent is outside.
    # B. The disilirane coordinates to a cerium atom... -> Impossible for the same reason.
    # C. The cerium atoms continue free random motion... -> Incorrect, their motion becomes highly restricted.
    # D. The cerium atoms are now positioned at the equator... -> Incorrect, they are repelled from the equator.
    # E. The cerium atoms are now positioned at the poles... -> Correct, this is the lowest energy configuration.
