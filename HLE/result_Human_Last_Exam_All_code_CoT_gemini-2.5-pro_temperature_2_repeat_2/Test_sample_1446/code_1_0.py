    Calculates the critical exponent nu for a G₄ (φ⁴) theory in the mean-field regime.

    In the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework for a φ⁴ theory, the behavior of
    critical exponents depends on the system's dimensionality 'd'. The upper
    critical dimension for this theory is d_c = 4.

    For any dimension d ≥ 4, fluctuations become negligible on large scales,
    and the system's critical behavior is accurately described by Mean-Field Theory.
    In this regime, the critical exponent ν, which governs the divergence of the
    correlation length ξ, takes a universal, exact value.
