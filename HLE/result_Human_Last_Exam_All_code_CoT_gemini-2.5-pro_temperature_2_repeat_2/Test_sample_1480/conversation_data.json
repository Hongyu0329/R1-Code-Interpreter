    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm operation, we combine the firing strength of the antecedent part with the membership value of the consequent part. The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the given values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm operation to these values: `activation_level = min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`.\n3.  Calculate the result.\n4.  Print the full equation and the final value.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nphi_k_x_prime = 0.7\nmu_G_k_j_y_j = 0.9\n\n# The t-norm operation is typically the minimum function in this context.\n# The rule activation level is calculated as the t-norm of the given values.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k_x_prime, mu_G_k_j_y_j)\n\n# Print the calculation and the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm:\")\nprint(f\"min({phi_k_x_prime}, {mu_G_k_j_y_j}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
