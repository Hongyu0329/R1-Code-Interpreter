    Yes, if f is a Schwartz function such that the integral of x^k * f(x) is 0 for all non-negative integers k, then it follows that f(x) = 0 for all x.

    Here is the mathematical justification:

    Step 1: The Fourier Transform of a Schwartz Function
    Let f be a Schwartz function. Its Fourier transform, denoted by F(f) or f_hat, is defined as:
    f_hat(xi) = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * exp(-2 * pi * i * x * xi) dx

    A key property of the Schwartz space is that the Fourier transform is an isomorphism from the space onto itself. This means it's a one-to-one and onto mapping. Consequently, if f_hat is the zero function, then f must also be the zero function. Our goal is to prove that f_hat is indeed the zero function.

    Step 2: Derivatives of the Fourier Transform
    Because f is a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform f_hat is infinitely differentiable. We can compute its derivatives by differentiating under the integral sign:
    (d^k / d(xi)^k) f_hat(xi) = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * (d^k / d(xi)^k) [exp(-2 * pi * i * x * xi)] dx
                              = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * (-2 * pi * i * x)^k * exp(-2 * pi * i * x * xi) dx

    Step 3: Connecting Derivatives to Moments
    Let's evaluate these derivatives at xi = 0. The exponential term exp(0) becomes 1:
    (d^k / d(xi)^k) f_hat(0) = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * (-2 * pi * i * x)^k dx
                            = (-2 * pi * i)^k * [integral from -inf to +inf of x^k * f(x) dx]

    The term in the square brackets is the k-th moment of the function f.

    Step 4: Using the Zero Moment Condition
    The problem states that all moments are zero. For every non-negative integer k:
    integral from -inf to +inf of x^k * f(x) dx = 0

    Substituting this into our equation for the derivatives of f_hat at the origin:
    (d^k / d(xi)^k) f_hat(0) = (-2 * pi * i)^k * 0 = 0

    This shows that the Fourier transform f_hat(xi) and all of its derivatives are zero at the point xi = 0.

    Step 5: Conclusion from Analyticity
    Another crucial property of the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is that it is an analytic function. This means it can be represented by its Taylor series in a neighborhood of any point. The Taylor series for f_hat(xi) around xi = 0 is:
    f_hat(xi) = sum for k=0 to inf of [(d^k / d(xi)^k) f_hat(0) / k!] * xi^k

    Since we've shown all derivatives at 0 are zero, all coefficients of the Taylor series are zero. Therefore, the series itself is zero, which means f_hat(xi) = 0 for all xi.

    Step 6: Invertibility of the Fourier Transform
    As stated in Step 1, the Fourier transform is invertible on the Schwartz space. If the transform of a function is zero, the function itself must be zero.
    
    Since f_hat(xi) = 0, we can conclude that the original function f(x) must also be the zero function.

    Final Equation:
    f(x) = 0
