    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Molecule:** First, I need to determine the chemical formula of a standard \"nanocar\". The most famous example is the one developed by the group of Professor James Tour at Rice University.\n2.  **Define the Chemical Term:** I'll define what the prefix \"perfluoro-\" means in organic chemistry. It signifies that all hydrogen atoms on a molecule's carbon backbone have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n3.  **Perform the Substitution:** By applying the \"perfluoro-\" rule to the nanocar's chemical formula, the number of hydrogen atoms will directly tell us the number of fluorine atoms in the hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n4.  **Generate the Code:** I will write a Python script that stores the number of hydrogen atoms in a variable and then prints an explanation and the result, showing that this number is equal to the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the chemical formula for the well-known nanocar.\n    # The original nanocar developed by the Tour group has the formula C38H44.\n    num_hydrogens_in_original_nanocar = 44\n    num_carbons_in_original_nanocar = 38\n    original_formula = f\"C{num_carbons_in_original_nanocar}H{num_hydrogens_in_original_nanocar}\"\n\n    # Step 2: Understand the \"perfluoro-\" prefix.\n    # This prefix means all hydrogen atoms (H) are replaced by fluorine atoms (F).\n    # Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in the new molecule is equal to\n    # the number of hydrogen atoms in the original molecule.\n    num_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogens_in_original_nanocar\n\n    # Step 3: Display the logic and the result.\n    print(f\"The chemical formula for the standard nanocar is {original_formula}.\")\n    print(\"The prefix 'perfluoro-' indicates that every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Number of hydrogens in the original nanocar = {num_hydrogens_in_original_nanocar}\")\n    print(f\"Number of fluorines in the perfluoronanocar = {num_fluorine_atoms}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThus, a perfluoronanocar would hypothetically contain {num_fluorine_atoms} fluorine atoms.\")\n\ncalculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms()\n```\n<<<44>>>"
