    "To determine what the Modern English word for \"sister\" would have been without Norse influence, we need to trace its linguistic development from Old English and see where it would have gone without interference.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Source Words:** The modern word \"sister\" is a blend. It originates from the Old English word \"sweostor\" but was heavily influenced by the Old Norse word \"systir,\" which was brought to England by Viking invaders.\n2.  **Examine the Native Development:** To see what \"sweostor\" would have become naturally, we can look at its development in Middle English in areas with less Norse influence. In Old English, there were two common forms: `sweostor` and `swustor`.\n3.  **Trace the Phonetic Changes:** The `swustor` variant is key. In Middle English, the unstressed `-or` ending was typically reduced. The `u` sound was generally preserved. This leads to the form `suster`, which is found frequently in Middle English texts, like those by Chaucer and in Wycliffe's Bible. This `suster` represents the natural, native evolution of the word.\n4.  **Hypothesize the Modern Form:** If the Norse-derived \"sister\" hadn't become dominant, it is highly probable that `suster` would have continued its evolution into Modern English. Phonetically, it's already very close to a modern spelling and pronunciation.\n5.  **Construct a \"Linguistic Equation\":** I will create a Python script to illustrate this historical-linguistic process. The script will define the original words and present a \"linguistic equation\" that subtracts the Norse influence from the Old English root to arrive at the hypothetical modern word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the linguistic reasoning to determine a hypothetical\n    Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    old_english_word = \"swustor\"\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n    middle_english_native_word = \"suster\"\n    modern_english_word_with_norse_influence = \"sister\"\n    hypothetical_word = \"suster\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the origin of the word 'sister'...\")\n    print(f\"The Modern English word '{modern_english_word_with_norse_influence}' comes from Old English '{old_english_word}' (alternate form 'sweostor').\")\n    print(f\"However, its modern form is heavily influenced by the Old Norse word '{old_norse_word}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nIf we remove the Norse influence, we must follow the word's natural evolution.\")\n    print(f\"The Old English '{old_english_word}' naturally evolved into the Middle English word '{middle_english_native_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"This form was common before '{modern_english_word_with_norse_influence}' became standard.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, without Norse contact, the likely Modern English word would be a direct descendant of the native form.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThis can be represented by the following linguistic equation:\")\n    # Printing each \"term\" of the \"equation\" as requested by the prompt.\n    print(f\"({old_english_word}) - ({old_norse_word} influence) = {hypothetical_word}\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
