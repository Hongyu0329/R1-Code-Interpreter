    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms in the molecule:** Toluene (C7H8) consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine the number of basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** It is a first-row element. The 1s orbital is a valence orbital and is represented by two basis functions (a split-valence representation: one contracted from 3 primitives and one from 1 primitive). So, each H atom has **2** contracted Gaussian functions.\n    *   **For Carbon (C):** It is a second-row element.\n        *   **Core (1s orbital):** Represented by 1 contracted basis function (from 6 primitives).\n        *   **Valence (2s, 2p orbitals):** Represented by two sets of basis functions. One set of 4 functions (s, px, py, pz) is contracted from 3 primitives each, and a second set of 4 functions is contracted from 1 primitive each. This gives 4 + 4 = 8 valence basis functions.\n        *   Total for each C atom = 1 (core) + 8 (valence) = **9** contracted Gaussian functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total for the molecule:**\n    *   Total = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n    *   Total = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n    *   Total = 63 + 16 = 79\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Define the number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Hydrogen (1s orbital): split into 2 basis functions (3G, 1G)\nfunctions_per_H = 2\n# For Carbon (1s core, 2s, 2p valence): 1 core function (6G) + 2 sets of valence functions (4*(3G) + 4*(1G)) = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9\nfunctions_per_C = 9\n\n# Calculate the contribution from carbon and hydrogen atoms\ncarbon_contribution = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_C\nhydrogen_contribution = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_H\n\n# Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions\ntotal_functions = carbon_contribution + hydrogen_contribution\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result\nprint(f\"For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C{num_carbon_atoms}H{num_hydrogen_atoms}):\")\nprint(f\"Number of contracted functions per Carbon (C) atom: {functions_per_C}\")\nprint(f\"Number of contracted functions per Hydrogen (H) atom: {functions_per_H}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"Total contracted functions = ({num_carbon_atoms} * {functions_per_C}) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} * {functions_per_H}) = {carbon_contribution} + {hydrogen_contribution} = {total_functions}\")\n\n<<<79>>>\n```"
