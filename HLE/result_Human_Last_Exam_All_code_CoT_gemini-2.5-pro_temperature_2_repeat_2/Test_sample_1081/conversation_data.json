    "My plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n\n1.  **State the relevant theorem:** I will begin by introducing the key mathematical result needed to solve the problem. This is a theorem by Steinberg, which gives a formula for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a connected reductive group. The formula is $q^N$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots of the group's root system.\n2.  **Identify the root system:** The problem specifies that the group $G$ is of type $E_8$, so the relevant root system is $E_8$.\n3.  **Calculate the number of positive roots (N) for $E_8$:** The number of positive roots can be calculated using the degrees of the fundamental invariants ($d_i$) of the Weyl group for $E_8$. The formula is $N = \\sum_i (d_i - 1)$. The degrees for $E_8$ are well-known: 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30.\n4.  **Construct the final answer:** I will substitute the calculated value of $N$ into the formula $q^N$ to obtain the final answer.\n5.  **Python Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically performs the calculation of $N$ and prints the explanation, the steps of the calculation, and the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of Fq-rational maximal tori for a reductive group\n    of type E_8 and prints a detailed explanation of the solution.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The reductive group G is of type E_8.\n    group_type = \"E_8\"\n\n    # The degrees of the fundamental invariants for the Weyl group of type E_8.\n    degrees = [2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30]\n\n    # The number of positive roots N is calculated by the formula: sum(d_i - 1)\n    # where d_i are the degrees of the fundamental invariants.\n    num_positive_roots = sum(d - 1 for d in degrees)\n\n    # Explanation of the method\n    print(\"To find the exact number of Fq-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G of type E_8,\")\n    print(\"we rely on a theorem from the theory of algebraic groups over finite fields.\")\n    print(\"\\nTheorem (Steinberg): The number of Fq-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group\")\n    print(\"over the finite field Fq is given by q^N, where N is the number of positive roots\")\n    print(\"of the associated root system.\")\n    \n    # Calculation steps\n    print(f\"\\nFor a group of type {group_type}, the number of positive roots N can be found using the\")\n    print(\"degrees (d_i) of the fundamental invariants of its Weyl group.
