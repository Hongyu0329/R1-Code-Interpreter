    "Of course. Here is a plan to find the answer, followed by a Python script that programmatically determines the song.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Music Theory:** The request is for a Beatles song that starts with a specific chord change: from the **tonic** chord (the \"I\" chord, or the chord of the home key) to the **minor fifth** chord (the \"vm\" chord).\n2.  **Translate to an Example:** In the key of C major, the tonic (I) chord is C major. The fifth note is G. The diatonic fifth chord (V) is G major. A *minor* fifth chord (vm) would be G minor. This is a non-diatonic, or \"borrowed,\" chord, which makes it quite distinctive.\n3.  **Create a Small Database:** I will create a small, pre-analyzed database of famous Beatles songs and their opening chord progressions, represented using Roman Numeral Analysis (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, viiÂ°).\n4.  **Implement a Search:** The Python script will iterate through this database. For each song, it will check if the first chord in its progression is the tonic ('I') and the second chord is the minor fifth ('vm').\n5.  **Output the Result:** Once the matching song is found, the script will print its name and a brief explanation of how it fits the criteria. The song \"Michelle\" is famous for this exact progression, starting in F major (tonic chord is F) and immediately moving to C minor (the minor fifth chord).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a Beatles song from a small database that matches a specific\n    opening chord progression: Tonic (I) to minor Fifth (vm).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A small database of Beatles songs with their key and opening chord\n    # progression represented in Roman Numeral Analysis.\n    songs_database = {\n        'A Hard Day\\'s Night': {\n            'key': 'G Major',\n            'opening_progression': ['G11', 'C', 'G']\n        },\n        'Yesterday': {\n            'key': 'F Major',\n            'opening_progression': ['I', 'vii', 'iii7'] # F -> Em7 -> A7\n        },\n        'Help!': {\n            'key': 'A Major',\n            'opening_progression': ['I', 'vii(b)', 'vi'] # A -> G -> F#m (simplified analysis)\n        },\n        'Michelle': {\n            'key': 'F Major',\n            'opening_progression': ['I', 'vm', 'IVm'] # F -> Cm -> Bbm\n        }\n    }\n\n    target_progression_start = ['I', 'vm']\n    found_song = None\n    analysis = {}\n\n    for song_title, song_data in songs_database.items():\n        # Check if the start of the song's progression matches the target\n        if song_data['opening_progression'][:2] == target_progression_start:\n            found_song = song_title\n            analysis = song_data\n            break\n\n    if found_song:\n        print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is: '{found_song}'.\")\n        print(\"\\n--- Analysis ---\")\n        print(f\"Key: {analysis['key']}\")\n        print(\"Progression Breakdown:\")\n        tonic_chord = analysis['key'].split(\" \")[0]\n        # In F major, the fifth note is C.
