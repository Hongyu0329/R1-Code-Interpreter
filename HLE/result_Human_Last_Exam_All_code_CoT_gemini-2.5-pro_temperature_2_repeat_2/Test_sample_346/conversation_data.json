    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression:** The given expression is complex. We will first break it down into smaller, more manageable parts based on its structure `S(I)(...)`.\n2.  **Identify Key Combinators:** The expression contains repeating blocks. We need to determine what mathematical or logical operations these blocks represent. The most prominent block is `S(S(K(S))(K))`. It is highly likely this is a minor variation (or typo) of the standard \"successor\" combinator `succ = S(S(K S)K)`, which takes a Church numeral `n` and returns `n+1`. We will proceed with this assumption.\n3.  **Evaluate Components A and B:** The full expression is of the form `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))(B)))`.\n    *   `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n    *   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n    Assuming the combinator is `succ`, we can evaluate A and B. Church numeral `I` represents `1`. The term `S(I)(I)` is the self-application combinator `Ï‰`, which is not a numeral. It is highly probable it is a typo for `I` as well. With these assumptions, `A` becomes `succ(1) = 2`, and `B` also becomes `succ(1) = 2`.\n4.  **Evaluate the Full Expression:** We will parse the expression `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))(2)))` assuming left-associativity for applications, i.e., `F(X)(Y)` means `((F X) Y)`.\n    *   Let `E = ((S I (S I (S I (K 2)))) 2)`\n    *   We reduce this term by term. The innermost term is `S I (K 2)`, which reduces to a new function. We continue reducing until we get the final Church numeral, `n`.\n5.  **Interpret the Result as Church Exponentiation:** The reduction leads to `n = 2(4)`, where `2` and `4` are Church numerals. The application of one Church numeral to another, `m(n)`, is equivalent to exponentiation: `exp(n, m) = n^m`.\n6.  **Calculate n:** Based on the interpretation `m(n) = n^m`, the expression `2(4)` evaluates to `4^2 = 16`. So `n=16`.\n7.  **Final Answer:** Calculate `log_2(n)`, which is `log_2(16)`.\n\nThe python code will demonstrate the calculation steps based on this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef church_to_int(n_str, n_val):\n    \"\"\"Helper to print the representation of a church numeral.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"{n_str} = {n_val}\")\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Step 1 & 2: Analyze the SKI expression and its components.\")\n    print(\"The expression is of the form 'Op(Op(Op(K(A))(B)))' where Op is S(I).\")\n    print(\"The components A and B involve 'S(S(K(S))(K))'.\")\n    print(\"This is assumed to be a typo for the successor combinator, succ = S(S(KS)K).\")\n    print(\"I (Identity) is the Church numeral for 1.\")\n    print(\"'S(I)(I)' is assumed to be a typo for I=1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluate components A and B.\")\n    print(\"A = succ(I) = succ(1)\")\n    A_val = 1 + 1\n    church_to_int(\"A\", A_val)\n\n    print(\"B = succ(S(I)(I)) = succ(1)\")\n    B_val = 1 + 1\n    church_to_int(\"B\", B_val)\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 4 & 5: Evaluate the full expression by reducing it structurally.\")\n    print(\"The full expression is parsed as: ( (S I (S I (S I (K A)))) B )\")\n    print(\"Let's reduce this from the inside out.\")\n    \n    print(\"Let U = S I (K A).\")\n    print(\"Reducing U B gives: B(A).
