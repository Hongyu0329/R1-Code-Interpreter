The poem describes the intricate, lace-like patterns of frost during Autumn (A).

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic language:

1.  "Naked, cold" and "She's lace and glass": These phrases point directly to frost. Frost forms in the cold and creates delicate, crystalline patterns that resemble lace and glass.

2.  "She knits a veil from starwort, grass and meadowsweet": This is a powerful metaphor for how frost covers plants and the ground with a beautiful, intricate layer.

3.  "She’s coursed, outpaced them all": This line perfectly captures the way frost can spread rapidly across a whole landscape overnight, seemingly faster than anything else.

4.  "...waits for pelted Autumn and his echoed roar to fray each feather stitch...": This confirms the setting is Autumn. The fragile frost ("feather stitch") only lasts until the morning sun, wind, or rain ("pelted Autumn") arrives to melt it away ("fray").

Conclusion: While other options like a spiderweb have some similarities, only frost fits all the descriptions—especially "cold" and "coursed"—so completely.
