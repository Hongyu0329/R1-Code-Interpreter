    "My plan is to solve this problem by following these steps:\n1.  **Define the Supply and Demand Functions**: I will first represent the given supply `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` and demand `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` functions in Python.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium**: The market equilibrium occurs where the supply price equals the demand price (`P_S = P_D`). This gives us the equation `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`. Since this equation is complex and cannot be solved algebraically, I will use a numerical solver (`scipy.optimize.fsolve`) to find the equilibrium quantity (`Q_e`). Once `Q_e` is found, I'll calculate the corresponding equilibrium price (`P_e`).\n3.  **Determine the Integration Bounds**:\n    *   For the demand curve, the integration for total welfare typically starts from `Q=0`.\n    *   For the supply curve, the function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined when its argument `Q^3 - 2` is positive. This means `Q^3 > 2`, or `Q > 2^(1/3)`. I'll calculate this minimum quantity, `Q_min`.\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare**: Total welfare is the total area between the demand and supply curves. I can calculate this by taking the integral of the demand function from `0` to `Q_e` and subtracting the integral of the supply function from its starting point, `Q_min`, to `Q_e`. The formula is:\n    `Total Welfare = ∫[0 to Q_e] D(Q) dQ - ∫[Q_min to Q_e] S(Q) dQ`\n    I will use a numerical integration function (`scipy.integrate.quad`) to compute these definite integrals.\n5.  **Output the Result**: Finally, the script will print the calculated equilibrium quantity and price, the values of the two integrals, and the final total welfare, showing the full equation with the calculated numbers.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
