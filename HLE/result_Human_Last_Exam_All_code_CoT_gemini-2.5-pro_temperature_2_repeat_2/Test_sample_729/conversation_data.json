    "Here is a plan to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group**: The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as $Q_{128}$ or $Q_{2^7}$. Its standard presentation is $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{64}=1, x^{32}=y^2, y^{-1}xy=x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroup**: A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ that can be expressed as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer exponent $k$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Power Subgroups based on the exponent k**: The structure of the power subgroup $Q_{128}^k$ depends on the parity of $k$.\n    *   **Case 1: k is odd.** For any odd integer $k$, the mapping $g \\mapsto g^k$ is a bijection on $Q_{128}$ because the group's order (128) is a power of 2. This means $Q_{128}^k$ contains all elements of the original group. Thus, for any odd $k$, we get only one distinct power subgroup, which is $Q_{128}$ itself.\n    *   **Case 2: k is even.** For any even integer $k$, it can be shown that the power subgroup is a cyclic subgroup of the one generated by $x$. Specifically, $Q_{128}^k = \\langle x^d \\rangle$, where $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$. Since $k$ is even and 64 is even, their greatest common divisor, $d$, must also be even. Therefore, the distinct power subgroups generated by even exponents correspond to the set of subgroups $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d$ is an even divisor of 64.\n\n4.  **Count the Subgroups**: The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from the two cases: 1 (from the odd $k$ case) plus the number of distinct subgroups from the even $k$ case. The latter is equal to the number of even divisors of 64.\n\n5.  **Implementation**: I will write a Python script that calculates the number of even divisors of 64, adds 1, and prints the final calculation, showing how the total is derived.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_q128():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the\n    generalized quaternion group of size 128 (Q_128).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is Q_128.\")\n    print(\"Its power subgroups H = Q_128^k = {g^k | g in Q_128} depend on the integer k.\\n\")\n\n    # Case 1: k is odd\n    # For an odd k, Q_128^k = Q_128.
