    print("2. The MMR machinery initiates a 'repair' process that, paradoxically, leads to the expansion of the repeat tract.")
    
    print("3. This expansion process involves multiple steps: recognition, excision of the original strand, DNA synthesis to fill the gap, and finally, ligation.")
    
    print("4. DNA Ligase I (LIG1) is the enzyme responsible for the final step: sealing the nick in the DNA backbone to complete the process and lock in the expansion.")
    
    print("5. If LIG1 is knocked out or non-functional, this final ligation step is blocked.")
    
    print("6. Consequence: The expansion pathway is interrupted, and the age-dependent increase in repeat length is prevented or significantly suppressed.")
