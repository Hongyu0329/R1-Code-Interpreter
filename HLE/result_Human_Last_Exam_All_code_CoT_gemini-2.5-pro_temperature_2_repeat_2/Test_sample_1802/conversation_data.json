    "The problem asks for the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a $d$-dimensional Pauli channel $\\Lambda$. This maximal rank is obtained by optimizing over all possible Pauli channels (i.e., all valid probability distributions $\\{p_{k,l}\\}$) and all possible input quantum states ($\\rho$).\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Define the Pauli Channel and its Complementary:** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is described by the action $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{k,l} U_{k,l} \\rho U_{k,l}^\\dagger$, where $U_{k,l} = X^k Z^l$ are the generalized Pauli operators, and $\\{p_{k,l}\\}$ is a probability distribution. The complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ describes the information leaking to the environment.\n2.  **Represent the Complementary Channel Output:** The output of the complementary channel, $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)$, is a state on a $d^2$-dimensional environment. The rank of this output state is therefore bounded by $d^2$.\n3.  **Find the Optimal Channel and State:** To achieve the maximum possible rank, we can make specific choices for the channel $\\Lambda$ and the input state $\\rho$.\n    *   We choose a channel where all $d^2$ possible Pauli errors have a non-zero probability. The simplest choice is the one where all probabilities are equal: $p_{k,l} = 1/d^2$ for all $k,l=0, \\dots, d-1$. This corresponds to a completely depolarizing channel.\n    *   We choose the input state to be the maximally mixed state, $\\rho = I/d$, where $I$ is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix.\n4.  **Calculate the Rank:** With these choices, the output state of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(I/d)$ can be calculated. Due to the orthogonality of the Pauli operators ($ \\text{Tr}(U_{m,n}^\\dagger U_{k,l}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{k,m}\\delta_{l,n} $), the resulting matrix is diagonal.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The diagonal entries of the output matrix turn out to be the probabilities $p_{k,l}$. Since we chose all $d^2$ probabilities to be non-zero ($1/d^2$), the resulting $d^2 \\times d^2$ diagonal matrix has $d^2$ non-zero entries. The rank of a diagonal matrix is the number of its non-zero entries, which in this case is $d^2$.\n\nSince the rank cannot exceed $d^2$, we have found the maximum possible rank.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by explicitly constructing the operators and matrices for a user-specified dimension `d` and calculating the rank of the resulting state.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_max_rank(d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the maximal rank of the complementary\n    channel of a d-dimensional Pauli channel.\n\n    The function demonstrates this by:\n    1.
