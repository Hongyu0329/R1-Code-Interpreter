1. The patient's symptoms are characteristic of sciatica. The physical exam described is designed to pinpoint the cause.
2. The piriformis muscle is a major external rotator of the hip. In piriformis syndrome, this muscle irritates the sciatic nerve.
3. The test described involves the patient contracting a muscle against resistance to reproduce the pain.
4. To test the piriformis muscle, the patient must perform its primary action, which is external rotation of the hip.
5. If performing external rotation against the physician's resistance reproduces the patient's specific L4-S1 pain, it strongly supports a diagnosis of piriformis syndrome.
6. Therefore, the action that will confirm the diagnosis in this scenario is External Rotation.
