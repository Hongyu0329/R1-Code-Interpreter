# 1. Define the numbers based on the interpretation of the symbols.
# '小便' is interpreted as the Egyptian hieroglyph for a tadpole, which is 100,000.
num1 = 100000
# '𒌋𒌋𒌋' is interpreted as Cuneiform for 30 (10 + 10 + 10).
num2 = 30
# '𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹' is interpreted as Cuneiform for 23 (10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1).
num3 = 23

# 2. Perform the calculation.
result = num1 / num2 - num3

# 3. Print the equation in modern numbers along with the result.
# The format ensures each number in the final equation is shown.
print(f"The equation is: {num1} / {num2} - {num3}")
print(f"The solution is: {result}")
