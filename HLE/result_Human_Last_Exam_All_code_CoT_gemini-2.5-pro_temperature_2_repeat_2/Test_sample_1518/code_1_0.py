    concepts = {
        "1. The Principle": (
            "'t Hooft anomaly matching states that the anomaly associated with a global "
            "symmetry must be identical in the high-energy (UV) and low-energy (IR) descriptions "
            "of a quantum field theory. It is a condition of UV-IR consistency."
        ),
        "2. Key Context (Non-Abelian Gauge Theories)": (
            "In theories like QCD, the UV degrees of freedom (quarks and gluons) are different "
            "from the IR degrees of freedom (hadrons like pions and protons) due to confinement. "
            "The anomaly matching condition bridges these two descriptions."
        ),
        "3. Distinction from Gauge Anomalies": (
            "This condition applies to GLOBAL symmetries, not GAUGE symmetries. "
            "Gauge anomalies MUST be canceled for a theory to be consistent. Global "
            "anomalies can exist and provide profound physical information."
        ),
        "4. The Main Physical Implication": (
            "Because the IR anomaly must match the known UV anomaly, the condition serves "
            "as a powerful, non-perturbative constraint. Any proposed low-energy theory that fails "
            "to reproduce the anomaly is incorrect. This fundamentally restricts the possibilities "
            "for what can happen at low energies."

        "A": "Incorrect. The anomaly is a breaking of the symmetry; the condition preserves the anomaly, not the symmetry itself.",
        "B": "Correct, but this is the DEFINITION of the condition, not its primary physical implication or use.",
        "C": "This is the most accurate and general statement of the IMPLICATION. The condition's primary role is to constrain possible low-energy effective theories.",
        "D": "Incorrect. This confuses global anomalies with gauge anomalies.",
        "F, H, J": "Correct implications, but they are specific EXAMPLES of the general constraint described in (C). For instance, the constraint on the IR theory (C) manifests as a constraint on the degrees of freedom (J) and their symmetry breaking patterns (H).",
        "G": "Correct, but this is another way of phrasing the implication in (C). We test an IR theory's validity *because* the condition is a constraint.",
        "I": "Correct, but this is another way to state the principle (B)."
