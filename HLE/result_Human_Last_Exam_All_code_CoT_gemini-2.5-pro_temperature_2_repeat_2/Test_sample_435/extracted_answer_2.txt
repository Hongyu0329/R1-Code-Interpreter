Based on the evidence that interleukin-15 (IL-15) promotes T cell survival, persistence, and the development of a potent memory phenotype, one would predict that CAR T cells manufactured with IL-15 would exhibit **increased release of effector cytokines** (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15. This is because IL-15 generates a more functionally robust and persistent T cell product, which would mount a stronger response upon encountering its target.
