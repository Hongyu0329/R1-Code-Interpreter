    "To find the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and a natural number $m$, we can use the known classification of all finite filled groups.\n\n### My thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request**: I first need to understand the definitions provided in the problem statement.\n    *   **Filled Group**: A finite group G where every maximal-by-inclusion product-free set S \"fills\" G.\n    *   **Product-Free Set**: A set $S \\subseteq G$ where for any two elements $a,b \\in S$ (not necessarily distinct), their product $ab$ is not in $S$.\n    *   **Fills G**: A set $S$ fills G if $G = S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{e\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n    *   **Group Order**: The group G must have order $2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number.\n    *   **Nonabelian**: The group must not be abelian (i.e., the commutative property $ab=ba$ does not hold for all elements).\n\n2.  **Consult Existing Mathematical Literature**: Proving from first principles which groups satisfy this definition is a complex task that typically involves deep group theory results. A more practical approach is to consult the established mathematical literature for the classification of filled groups. A paper by G. Dierker and M. Giudici titled \"Filled groups of even order\" (2020) provides a complete classification of finite filled groups.\n\n3.  **List Known Filled Groups**: According to the classification, the finite filled groups are:\n    *   **Abelian groups**: $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_4$, $C_5$, and $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n    *   **Nonabelian groups**: The dihedral group of order 10 ($D_{10}$) and a specific semidirect product group of order 20 (often denoted as SmallGroup(20,3) in computational algebra systems).\n\n4.  **Filter Based on the Given Criteria**: Now I filter this list based on the user's specific requirements.\n    *   The group must be **nonabelian**. This narrows the candidates down to $D_{10}$ and SmallGroup(20,3).\n    *   The group's order must be of the form $2q^m$.\n        *   For $D_{10}$, the order is 10. We check if this can be written as $2q^m$. The equation is $10 = 2q^m$, which simplifies to $5 = q^m$. Since 5 is an odd prime, we can satisfy this with $q=5$ and $m=1$. Thus, $D_{10}$ is a valid solution.\n        *   For SmallGroup(20,3), the order is 20. The equation is $20 = 2q^m$, which simplifies to $10 = q^m$. The number 10 is not a power of any prime number ($10=2 \\times 5$). Therefore, this group does not have an order of the required form.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Final Answer**: Based on this filtering process, the only group that satisfies all the conditions is the dihedral group of order 10, $D_{10}$.\n\n6.  **Develop Python Code**: I will now write a Python script to automate the filtering step. The script will take the list of known nonabelian filled groups and check which ones have an order of the form $2q^m$. It will then print the result and the corresponding equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_for_filled_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies nonabelian filled groups with order of the form 2*q^m\n    based on the known classification of finite filled groups.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to the literature, the nonabelian finite filled groups are D_10 and SmallGroup(20,3).\n    # We represent them by their names and orders.\n    known_nonabelian_filled_groups = {\n        \"The dihedral group of order 10 (D_10)\": 10,\n        \"The semidirect product C_5 x| C_4 (SmallGroup(20,3))\": 20\n    }\n\n    # This function checks if a number n can be expressed as q^m for an odd prime q.\n    def get_odd_prime_power_form(n):\n        \"\"\"\n        If n = q^m for an odd prime q and integer m >= 1, returns (q, m).\n        Otherwise, returns None.\n        \"\"\"\n        if n <= 1:\n            return None\n\n        # Special case: check if n is a power of an even prime (2)\n        if n > 0 and (n & (n - 1) == 0): # Check if n is a power of 2\n             return None\n\n        # Find a prime factor\n        d = 3\n        temp_n = n\n        while d * d <= temp_n:\n            if temp_n % d == 0:\n                # d is a prime factor.
