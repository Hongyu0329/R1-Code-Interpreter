    Explains the predominant factor influencing the declining 13C ratio
    in Chinese pine tree rings from 1886-1990.

    explanation = """
    Step 1: Understand the observation. A 'declining 13C ratio' in tree rings means the tree is incorporating progressively less of the heavy 13C carbon isotope over time. This happens when the tree's photosynthetic process discriminates more strongly against 13C.

    Step 2: Relate discrimination to tree physiology. A plant's ability to discriminate against 13C is highest when its stomata (leaf pores) are wide open, as this provides a plentiful supply of atmospheric CO2 to choose from. Stomata are open when water is abundant and closed during water stress (drought).

    Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on this relationship.
        - A. Tree maturation: Unlikely to be the predominant factor for a consistent trend over 100+ years.
        - B. Periods of drought: Drought would cause stomata to close, leading to LESS discrimination and a HIGHER 13C ratio, which is the opposite of the observed trend.
        - C & D. Starch reserves and wood proportions are secondary factors, not primary drivers of long-term regional trends.
        - E. Changes in the SE Asia monsoon: The monsoon is the primary driver of water availability in the region. A long-term strengthening of the monsoon would lead to greater water availability. This allows trees to keep their stomata open wider and for longer, increasing discrimination against 13C and causing the observed declining 13C ratio. This is a well-established relationship in paleoclimatology.

    Conclusion: The most plausible predominant factor among the choices is the change in the regional climate system governing water availability.
