    "To find the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Obelisks:** There are two famous Luxor Obelisks. One is in Luxor, Egypt, and the other is at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. I will need to check for depictions of either of these.\n2.  **List Best Picture Winners:** I'll chronologically review the list of Academy Award winners for Best Picture.\n3.  **Analyze Film Settings:** I will research the setting and key scenes of each winning film to determine if it was set in Paris or Luxor and if the obelisk was shown on-screen.\n4.  **Pinpoint the First Film:** My research points to several winners set in Paris, such as *An American in Paris* (1951), *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), and *Gigi* (1958). After careful review, the earliest of these films to feature the obelisk is *An American in Paris*. The film's climactic ballet sequence includes a stylized representation of the Place de la Concorde, complete with its famous obelisk.\n\nI will now write a Python script to formally present this finding by iterating through a list of key candidates and identifying the first one that matches the criteria.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \n    The script iterates through a researched list of winning films, checking a flag\n    that indicates whether the film is known to depict one of the Luxor Obelisks\n    (either the one in Paris or the one in Luxor).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A chronological list of key Best Picture winners and whether they depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n    # This data is based on film history research.\n    best_picture_winners = [\n        {\n            'year': 1928, 'title': 'Wings', 'location': 'France/USA', \n            'depicts_obelisk': False\n        },\n        {\n            'year': 1937, 'title': 'The Life of Emile Zola', 'location': 'Paris, France',\n            'depicts_obelisk': False\n        },\n        {\n            'year': 1942, 'title': 'Casablanca', 'location': 'Casablanca, Morocco',\n            'depicts_obelisk': False\n        },\n        {\n            'year': 1951, 'title': 'An American in Paris', 'location': 'Paris, France',\n            'depicts_obelisk': True\n        },\n        {\n            'year': 1956, 'title': 'Around the World in 80 Days', 'location': 'Global (including Paris)',\n            'depicts_obelisk': True\n        },\n        {\n            'year': 1958, 'title': 'Gigi', 'location': 'Paris, France',\n            'depicts_obelisk': True\n        },\n        {\n            'year': 1963, 'title': 'Cleopatra', 'location': 'Ancient Egypt/Rome', 'nominated_only': True,\n            'depicts_obelisk': False # Depicts ancient Egypt, not the modern Luxor temple site.\n        }\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Searching for the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk...\")\n    \n    first_winner = None\n    \n    for film in sorted(best_picture_winners, key=lambda x: x['year']):\n        if film.get('nominated_only', False):\n            # Skip films that were not winners.\n            continue\n            \n        print(f\"\\nChecking: {film['title']} ({film['year']})\")\n        print(f\"Setting: {film['location']}\")\n        \n        if film['depicts_obelisk']:\n            print(\"Result: Found a depiction of a Luxor Obelisk (in the Place de la Concorde, Paris).\")\n            first_winner = film\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Result: No depiction of a Luxor Obelisk found.\")\n\n    if first_winner:\n        print(\"\\n------------------------------------------------------------\")\n        print(\"Final Answer:\")\n        print(f\"The first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk was:\")\n        print(f\"'{first_winner['title']}', which won for the year {first_winner['year']}.\")\n        print(\"------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\nfind_first_winner_with_obelisk()\n<<<An American in Paris>>>\n```"
