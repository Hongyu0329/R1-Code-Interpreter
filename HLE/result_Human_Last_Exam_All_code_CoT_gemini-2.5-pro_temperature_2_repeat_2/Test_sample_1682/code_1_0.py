    print("Statement A: This statement is correct. The iconic 'phoenix crown and robe' (凤冠霞帔) was indeed formalized and popularized during the Ming Dynasty as official attire, which heavily influenced wedding customs for commoners. The red bridal veil is also a quintessential element.")
    print("-" * 50)
    
    print("Statement B: This statement is correct. According to ancient ritual texts like the 'Book of Rites' (礼记), which details Zhou Dynasty customs, the bride was required to cover her face with a covering or veil when leaving her family's home.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Statement C: This statement is incorrect. The key error is the mention of a 'folding fan' (折扇) in the Tang Dynasty. While using a fan to shield the face was a custom, the folding fan was introduced to China from Japan and Korea and only gained popularity during the Song Dynasty and later. In the Tang Dynasty, the common fan was the flat, non-folding 'round fan' (团扇). Therefore, the claim about using a folding fan in the Tang Dynasty is anachronistic.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Statement D: This statement is correct. Following the Song Dynasty, the 'xiapei' (a type of ceremonial shawl) and the 'phoenix crown' (凤冠) became standard, elaborate attire for women of high rank, and their designs heavily influenced bridal wear.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Statement E: This statement is correct. It accurately describes the typical wedding attire for Han Chinese brides during the Qing Dynasty, which preserved many traditions from the Ming Dynasty, including the predominant use of the color red and embroidered phoenix motifs.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("\nConclusion: The incorrect statement is C because the folding fan was not a common item in the Tang Dynasty.")
