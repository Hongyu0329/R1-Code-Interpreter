# Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion, "On the Motion of Small Particles
# Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat",
# was built upon the foundations of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat.
# While Einstein was not known to have attended their lectures in person, his work was
# significantly influenced by the published writings of certain physicists.

# The question refers to "lectures". This most directly points to the influential
# book by Ludwig Boltzmann titled "Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Gastheorie", which translates to
# "Lectures on Gas Theory". This work was a primary source for the kinetic theory
# that underpins Einstein's paper.
