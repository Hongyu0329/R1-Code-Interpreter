    "To answer your question, I will first identify the key scientific figures whose work was foundational to Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. Specifically, I will look for scientists whose work was published in a format that could be described as \"lectures.\" The answer, a historical fact, will then be presented using a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script provides the answer to the user's historical question.\n# Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion, \"On the Motion of Small Particles\n# Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\",\n# was built upon the foundations of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat.\n# While Einstein was not known to have attended their lectures in person, his work was\n# significantly influenced by the published writings of certain physicists.\n\n# The question refers to \"lectures\". This most directly points to the influential\n# book by Ludwig Boltzmann titled \"Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Gastheorie\", which translates to\n# \"Lectures on Gas Theory\". This work was a primary source for the kinetic theory\n# that underpins Einstein's paper.\n\nscientist_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\n# Print the final answer to the console.\nprint(f\"In his work leading to the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein was heavily influenced by and cited the work of {scientist_name}, specifically through his published book 'Lectures on Gas Theory'.\")\n\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
