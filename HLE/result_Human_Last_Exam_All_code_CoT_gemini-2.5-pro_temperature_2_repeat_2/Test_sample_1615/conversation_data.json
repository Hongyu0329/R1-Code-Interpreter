    "This problem can be solved using fundamental principles of graph theory concerning graph coloring.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Identify the properties of the graph:**\n    *   The number of vertices is $n = 12345$.\n    *   The graph is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n    *   We are looking for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring. This quantity is the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph meeting these criteria.\n\n2.  **Recall the upper bounds for the chromatic number:**\n    *   For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is always less than or equal to the number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n    *   The only graph with $n$ vertices that requires exactly $n$ colors is the complete graph, $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n3.  **Apply the constraints from the problem:**\n    *   We are given that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph.\n    *   Therefore, it is not the case that $\\chi(G) = n$. This implies that the chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$.\n    *   So, we must have $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$. In our case, this means $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n4.  **Verify if this maximum is achievable:**\n    *   To show that $12344$ is the maximum possible number of colors, we need to construct a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of $12344$.\n    *   Consider the following graph: Take a complete graph on $12344$ vertices ($K_{12344}$) and add one more vertex that is not connected to any of the other vertices (an isolated vertex).\n    *   This new graph has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\n    *   To color this graph, the $K_{12344}$ subgraph requires $12344$ distinct colors. The isolated vertex can be colored with any of these existing colors. Thus, the chromatic number of this graph is exactly $12344$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The maximum number of colors is bounded above by $12344$.\n    *   We have shown that a chromatic number of $12344$ is achievable for a graph with $12345$ vertices that is not complete.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of colours required is $12344$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and explains this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring\n    of a graph with n vertices, given that it is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of vertices in the graph G\n    num_vertices = 12345\n\n    # For any graph with n vertices, the maximum number of colors needed is n.\n    # This maximum is only achieved by the complete graph K_n.\n    # The problem states that our graph G is not a complete graph.\n    # Therefore, the number of colors must be strictly less than n.\n    # The maximum possible number of colors is n - 1.\n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n    # We can prove this is achievable by constructing a graph.\n    # Consider a graph formed by a complete subgraph on (n-1) vertices (a K_{n-1})\n    # and one additional isolated vertex. This graph has n vertices, is not complete,\n    # and requires (n-1) colors.\n\n    print(f\"The number of vertices in the graph is n = {num_vertices}.\")\n    print(\"A graph on n vertices requires n colors if and only if it is the complete graph K_n.\")\n    print(\"Since the graph G is not the complete graph, it must require fewer than n colors.\")\n    print(\"The maximum possible number of colors for a non-complete graph on n vertices is n - 1.\")\n    print(f\"So, the maximum number of colors needed is {num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}.\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
