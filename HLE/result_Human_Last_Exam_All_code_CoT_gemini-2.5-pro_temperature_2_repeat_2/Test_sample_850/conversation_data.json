    "Here is a breakdown of the logic to find the crystal classes that fit the user's criteria.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Address the Premise:** The user's question contains a contradiction. Optical activity, the rotation of polarized light, is fundamentally a property of *chiral* materials. By definition, an *achiral* object is superimposable on its mirror image and should not exhibit optical activity.\n2.  **Re-interpret the Question:** The underlying property that gives rise to optical activity is called gyrotropy. For the gyrotropy tensor to be non-zero, a crystal only needs to lack a center of inversion (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric). Some non-centrosymmetric crystal classes are, in fact, achiral (they possess other symmetry elements like mirror planes or rotoinversion axes). In these specific achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes, optical rotation can be observed, but only when light propagates along specific high-symmetry directions (optic axes).\n3.  **Refine the Criteria:** Based on this understanding, the task is to find crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n    *   **Achiral:** They possess an improper rotation axis (like a mirror plane or rotoinversion axis).\n    *   **Non-centrosymmetric:** They do not have a center of inversion. This is the requirement for gyrotropy.\n    *   **Non-polar:** They do not have a unique directional axis, meaning they don't exhibit properties like pyroelectricity.\n4.  **Execute the Search:** A Python script will be used to systematically filter the 32 crystal classes based on these three properties to find the answer. The script will define all classes and their relevant symmetries, then apply the filters to derive the final list.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_special_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies crystal classes that fit a unique set of symmetry criteria\n    related to optical phenomena.\n\n    The user asks for crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit\n    optical activity.\n\n    There is a fundamental contradiction in this request:\n    1.  Optical Activity is a hallmark of chirality.\n    2.  A chiral structure, by definition, cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.\n    3.  An achiral structure CAN be superimposed on its mirror image.\n\n    Therefore, a crystal class cannot be both achiral and optically active in the conventional sense.\n\n    However, we can interpret the question in a more nuanced way. The physical property\n    underlying optical activity is gyrotropy. A crystal class can be gyrotropic (allowing\n    for a non-zero gyration tensor) if it lacks a center of inversion. Some of these\n    non-centrosymmetric classes are indeed achiral. In such classes, optical rotation\n    can be observed, but only for light traveling along specific directions (optic axes).\n\n    This script identifies the crystal classes that are:\n    (1) Non-centrosymmetric (the condition for gyrotropy)\n    (2) Achiral (possessing an improper axis of rotation, like a mirror plane)\n    (3) Non-polar (lacking a unique vector direction)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 32 crystal classes (point groups) using Hermann-Mauguin notation\n    # -n denotes a rotoinversion axis n-bar.\n    all_classes = {\n        '1', '2', 'm', '2/m',\n        '222', 'mm2', 'mmm',\n        '4', '-4', '4/m',\n        '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm',\n        '3', '-3',\n        '32', '3m', '-3m',\n        '6', '-6', '6/m',\n        '622', '6mm', '-6m2', '6/mmm',\n        '23', 'm-3',\n        '432', '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # Classes with a center of inversion (centrosymmetric).
