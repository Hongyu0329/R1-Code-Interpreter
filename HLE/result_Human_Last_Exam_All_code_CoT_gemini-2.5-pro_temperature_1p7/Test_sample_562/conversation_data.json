    "To identify the bushu (radical) in the Japanese character 謄, we need to break it down.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Character**: The character 謄 can be visually separated into two parts: the left side and the right side.\n2.  **Identify the Radical**: The left part of the character is 月. This is a common radical in Japanese kanji.\n3.  **Find the Radical's Name**: When the radical 月 appears on the left side of a character (a position known as \"hen\"), it is called つきへん (tsukihen).\n4.  **Transcribe to Hepburn**: The Hepburn transcription of つきへん is \"Tsukihen\".\n\nTherefore, the bushu for 謄 is Tsukihen. I will now provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the radical for the Kanji character 謄 and prints its name.\n# The character is 謄.\n# The radical is the left part, which is 月.\n# When 月 is on the left side (hen), it is called \"tsukihen\".\n\nradical_name_hepburn = \"Tsukihen\"\nprint(radical_name_hepburn)\n```\n<<<Tsukihen>>>"
