    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a long vowel or diphthong becomes a short (lax) vowel when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of a word). This often happens when a suffix is added to a base word. For example, the long vowel /eɪ/ in `sane` becomes the short vowel /æ/ in the trisyllabic word `sanity`.\n\nMy plan is to analyze each word from the list to see if it fits this pattern:\n1.  Check if the word is at least three syllables long.\n2.  Check if there is a related English base word with a long vowel.\n3.  Determine if the vowel in the antepenultimate syllable of the target word is the shortened version of the vowel in the base word.\n4.  A word has *not* undergone trisyllabic laxing if it fails these conditions, for example, by not being three syllables long, or by not having a clear derivational history in English that shows the change.\n\nI will use a Python script to present this analysis and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_linguistic_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to determine which has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Dictionary to store the analysis of each word.\n    word_analysis = {\n        'southern': {\n            'syllables': 2,\n            'base_word_info': \"Related to 'south' (/aʊ/).
