    "To identify the small molecules that interact with the protein `CHEMBL4803817` (SARS-CoV-2 main protease), I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Install Library**: I will use the `chembl_webresource_client` library to programmatically access the ChEMBL database. I will include the installation command in the code comments.\n2.  **Connect to ChEMBL**: I will connect to the ChEMBL API.\n3.  **Query for Activities**: I will query the database for all bioactivity data associated with the target `CHEMBL4803817`.\n4.  **Filter Results**: To find potent binders, I will filter these activities to only include those with a pChEMBL value of 5.0 or greater. The pChEMBL value is a standardized measure of potency (like IC50, Ki, etc.), and a value >= 5 corresponds to an activity concentration of 10 ÂµM (10,000 nM) or better.\n5.  **Extract Molecule IDs**: From the filtered results, I will extract the unique ChEMBL IDs of the small molecules (`molecule_chembl_id`).\n6.  **Print Results**: Finally, I will print the list of these molecule IDs.\n\n```python\n# First, you may need to install the ChEMBL web resource client library\n# pip install chembl_webresource_client\n\nfrom chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\n\ndef find_interacting_molecules(target_chembl_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints small molecules that interact with a given ChEMBL target ID.\n    The search is filtered for potent binders (pChEMBL value >= 5.0).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Searching for small molecule ligands for target: {target_chembl_id}\\n\")\n    \n    try:\n        # Initialize the client for accessing bioactivities\n        activity = new_client.activity\n\n        # Query for activities related to the target ID\n        # Filter for pChEMBL value >= 5 to get reasonably potent compounds\n        # (pChEMBL of 5 corresponds to an IC50/EC50/Ki of 10,000 nM or 10 uM)\n        res = activity.filter(target_chembl_id=target_chembl_id, pchembl_value__gte=5).only(['molecule_chembl_id', 'pchembl_value', 'standard_type'])\n\n        if not res:\n            print(f\"No interacting molecules found for {target_chembl_id} with a pChEMBL value >= 5.0.\")\n            return\n\n        # Use a set to store unique molecule IDs to avoid duplicates\n        interacting_molecule_ids = set()\n        for item in res:\n            if item['molecule_chembl_id']:\n                interacting_molecule_ids.add(item['molecule_chembl_id'])\n\n        print(f\"Found {len(interacting_molecule_ids)} unique small molecules interacting with {target_chembl_id}:\")\n        \n        # Print each molecule ID\n        for molecule_id in sorted(list(interacting_molecule_ids)):\n            print(molecule_id)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please ensure the 'chembl_webresource_client' library is installed (`pip install chembl_webresource_client`) and you have an internet connection.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    target_id = \"CHEMBL4803817\"\n    find_interacting_molecules(target_id)\n```"
