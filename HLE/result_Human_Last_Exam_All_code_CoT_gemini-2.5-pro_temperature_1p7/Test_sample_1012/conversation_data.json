    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the required symmetric key length for quantum resistance:\n\n1.  **Establish the Baseline:** The current standard for strong symmetric encryption (like AES) is a 128-bit key. This means that for a classical computer, it would take approximately 2^128 operations to brute-force the key, which is considered computationally infeasible. This is our target security level.\n\n2.  **Understand the Quantum Threat:** For breaking symmetric encryption, the most effective known quantum algorithm is Grover's algorithm. It provides a quadratic speedup over classical brute-force attacks.\n\n3.  **Quantify the Speedup:** A classical brute-force attack on a key of length 'k' takes roughly 2^k operations. Grover's algorithm on a quantum computer can perform the same task in roughly sqrt(2^k) operations, which is equal to 2^(k/2) operations.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Equation:** We want the security level against a quantum computer to be equivalent to our 128-bit classical security level. Therefore, we need to find a new key length, 'k', such that the number of quantum operations is at least 2^128. This gives us the equation:\n    `2^(k/2) >= 2^128`\n\n5.  **Solve for 'k':** By comparing the exponents in the equation, we get:\n    `k/2 >= 128`\n    Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n    `k >= 256`\n\nTherefore, to achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, the symmetric key must be at least 256 bits long.\n\nHere is a Python script that demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quantum_resistant_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure\n    against a quantum computer, based on a classical security standard.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
