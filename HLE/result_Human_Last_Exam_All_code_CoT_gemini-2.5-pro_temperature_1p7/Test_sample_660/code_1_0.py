    Analyzes the auditor choice for firms and derives the condition required by the user.

    The problem asks for the set of values theta for which more truthful firms (theta=1)
    choose more lenient auditors (x=0), which implies less truthful firms (theta=0)
    choose stricter auditors (x=1).

    We define the cost function C(theta, x) for a firm of type theta hiring an
    auditor of type x.
    C(theta, x) = Tax_Liability + Expected_Penalty
                = t(theta) + P(refusal|theta,x) * P(RS_audit|x) * Penalty(theta)

    Let's analyze the choice for each firm type.
