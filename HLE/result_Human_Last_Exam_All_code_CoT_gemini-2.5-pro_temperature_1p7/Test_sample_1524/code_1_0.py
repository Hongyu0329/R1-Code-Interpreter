    # 1. The Bose-Einstein Distribution
    # The average number of bosons, n(ε), in a state with energy ε is given by:
    # n(ε) = 1 / (exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1)
    # where μ is the chemical potential.
    print("Step 1: The Bose-Einstein distribution is n(ε) = 1 / (exp((ε - μ) / k_B*T) - 1).")
    print("Let's analyze the terms in the denominator of this equation.")

    # 2. The Physical Constraint
    # For n(ε) to be a positive number, its denominator must be positive.
    # So, exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1 > 0.
    # Let's print out the numbers in this inequality to fulfill the request.
    print(f"\nStep 2: For a positive occupation number n(ε), the denominator must be > 0.")
    print(f"   => exp((ε - μ) / k_B*T) - 1 > 0")
    print(f"   => exp((ε - μ) / k_B*T) > 1")


    # 3. Deriving the Limit on μ
    # Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: (ε - μ) / (k_B * T) > 0.
    # Since temperature T > 0, this means ε - μ > 0, or μ < ε.
    # This must hold for ALL energy states ε. Therefore, μ must be less than
    # the lowest possible energy, the ground state energy ε₀.
    print("\nStep 3: This inequality leads to the fundamental limit μ < ε for all states.")
    print("   Therefore, μ must be less than the ground state energy: μ < ε₀.")

    # 4. Relating to Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC)
    # BEC is the macroscopic occupation of the ground state (ε₀). For n(ε₀) to be large,
    # its denominator must be a very small positive number.
    # This means (ε₀ - μ) must be a very small positive number, or μ must approach ε₀ from below.
    # In the condensed phase, the chemical potential is effectively clamped at μ = ε₀.
    print("\nStep 4: For BEC to occur, n(ε₀) must be large.")
    print("   This happens when the denominator approaches 0, so μ gets infinitesimally close to ε₀.")
    print("   In the condensed phase, the chemical potential is effectively clamped: μ = ε₀.")


    # 5. Evaluating the Answer Choices
    # Choice C: "μ must be equal to the chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at zero temperature."
    # At absolute zero (T=0), a non-interacting Bose gas has all its particles in the ground state.
    # The chemical potential at T=0 is defined as the energy required to add one more particle to the system,
    # which would be added to the ground state. Therefore, the chemical potential at T=0 is exactly ε₀.
    # This matches our derived condition for the condensed phase.
    print("\nStep 5: Evaluating the choices, Choice C is the most accurate.")
    print("   The chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at T=0 is exactly ε₀.")
    print("   This matches our conclusion that in the BEC phase, μ = ε₀.")
