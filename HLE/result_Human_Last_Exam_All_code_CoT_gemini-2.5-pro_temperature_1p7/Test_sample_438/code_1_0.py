# --- Plan ---
# 1. State the core biological principle: The risk of many autoimmune diseases is directly linked to how well HLA molecules present specific "self-antigens". Increased presentation leads to increased risk.
# 2. Define the variables based on the problem: a baseline risk and the fold increase in antigen presentation.
# 3. Calculate the new relative risk to demonstrate the effect of the fold increase.
# 4. Print the reasoning and the final calculation to explain why the risk increases.
