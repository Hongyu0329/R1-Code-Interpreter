    "Of course. Let's break down this classic poker problem on the money bubble.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** We have a 16 big blind (bb) stack in early position (UTG+1) near the money bubble. This specific situation is governed by the Independent Chip Model (ICM), which means survival has a high monetary value. We need a much stronger hand to go all-in than we would in a regular chip EV (cEV) situation. Our goal is to risk our tournament life only when the potential reward is very high.\n\n2.  **Establish a Model:** We can determine the profitability of shoving each hand by calculating its Expected Value (EV). The formula for the EV of a shove is:\n    `EV = (P_fold * pot_pre) + (P_call * (equity_vs_calling_range * pot_if_called - our_investment))`\n\n3.  **Define Assumptions:** To perform the calculation, we need to make some reasonable assumptions:\n    *   **Table Size:** 8-handed table.\n    *   **Antes:** 12.5% of the big blind from each player. The starting pot (`pot_pre`) is 1.5bb (blinds) + 8 * 0.125bb (antes) = 2.5bb.\n    *   **Our Investment:** Our entire stack, 16bb.\n    *   **Opponent's Calling Range:** Due to extreme bubble pressure, our opponents will only call our shove with a very strong range. A realistic range is `TT+` (pocket tens or better) and `AK` (Ace-King). This constitutes about 2.7% of all possible hands.\n    *   **Probabilities:** With 7 players behind us, the probability of everyone folding (`P_fold`) can be calculated. The probability of getting at least one call (`P_call`) is `1 - P_fold`.\n    *   **Equity:** We'll use standard equity calculations to find out how our hand fares against the tight calling range (`TT+, AK`).\n\n4.  **Code the Solution:** I will write a Python script to perform this EV calculation for each of the answer choices (`QJs`, `99`, `AJo`, `AKo`). The script will print out the full equation and the final EV for each hand, making the profitability clear.\n\n5.  **Interpret and Conclude:** Based on the results, we will see which hands are profitable to shove. Because of ICM pressure, only shoves with a significant positive EV should be considered. This will allow us to identify the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the analysis:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_shove_ev():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the Expected Value (EV) of shoving different poker hands\n    in a specific tournament scenario.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
