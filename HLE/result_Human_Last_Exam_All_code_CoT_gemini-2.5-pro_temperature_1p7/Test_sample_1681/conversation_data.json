    "When a quantum dimension is introduced to the classic Prisoner's Dilemma, new strategic possibilities arise that can lead to outcomes different from the classical Nash Equilibrium of mutual defection. We will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, a standard model for quantum games.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Model Setup**: I'll model the quantum game using the EWL protocol. The initial state will be a maximally entangled Bell state, created by an entangling operator `J` acting on the base state `|00>`. This is the \"optimal\" initial state design mentioned in the problem.\n2.  **Define Strategies**: The players' strategies (Cooperate, Defect, and now Quantum) are represented by 2x2 unitary matrices acting on their respective qubits.\n    *   Classical Cooperate (C): The Identity matrix `I`.\n    *   Classical Defect (D): A specific unitary matrix, often equivalent to a Pauli spin flip.\n    *   Quantum (Q): A \"miracle\" strategy `Q` that has no classical counterpart. In the standard EWL setup, a particular `Q` has been shown to be the key to the new equilibrium.\n3.  **State Evolution**: The initial state `|psi_0>` evolves based on the players' chosen strategies `U_A` and `U_B`. The final state `|psi_f>` is calculated as `|psi_f> = J_dag * (U_A ⊗ U_B) * J * |psi_0>`, where `⊗` is the tensor product and `J_dag` is the disentangling operator.\n4.  **Calculate Payoffs**: The probabilities of the four classical outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD) are determined by measuring the final state `|psi_f>`. The expected payoff for each player is then calculated using these probabilities and the given payoff matrix.\n5.  **Find the Equilibrium**: In this quantum setup, a new Nash Equilibrium emerges where both players choose the quantum strategy `Q`. This `(Q, Q)` equilibrium yields a higher payoff than the classical `(D, D)` outcome, resolving the dilemma. I will write a Python script to compute the probabilities and the resulting payoff for this new equilibrium point.\n\nThe script will perform the necessary linear algebra to simulate the quantum game and calculate the final equilibrium payoff for a player. It will then print the equation showing how this payoff is derived from the outcome probabilities and the game's rewards.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import expm\n\ndef solve_quantum_pd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n    using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
