    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the problem**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product of component characters $\\chi = \\prod_{p^a || N} \\chi_{p^a}$, where each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character modulo the prime power $p^a$ that exactly divides $N$. The conductor of such $\\chi$ is $N$, and its order is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its component characters.\n\n2.  **Prime Factorization**: We start by finding the prime factorization of the conductor $N=36036$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Prime Power Component**: For each prime power factor $p^a$ in the factorization of $N$, we need to find the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ whose order divides 6. Let's call this number $C_{p^a}$.\n    *   For each $p^a$, we'll identify the structure of the group of characters modulo $p^a$.\n    *   We'll determine which of these characters are primitive.\n    *   From the primitive characters, we'll count how many have an order that divides 6.\n\n4.  **Verify the Order Condition**: After finding the possible orders for each component character, we must verify that the LCM of the orders of any combination of these chosen characters is exactly 6.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Count**: The total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 will be the product of the number of choices for each component, i.e., $\\prod C_{p^a}$.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the Python code below.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef solve_character_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N=36036 and order 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order 6.\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Prime factorization of N\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Prime factorization of N\")\n    factorization = \"2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13\"\n    print(f\"N = 36036 = {factorization}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nA character chi mod N is primitive if it's a product of primitive characters for each prime power factor.\")\n    print(\"The order of chi is the lcm of the orders of its component characters.\")\n    print(\"The order of each component character must divide 6.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Analyze each prime power factor\n    \n    # For N = 4 = 2^2\n    print(\"--- Component for conductor 4 (2^2) ---\")\n    group_structure_4 = \"C_2\"\n    num_prim_4 = 1 # The non-trivial character mod 4\n    order_4 = 2\n    print(f\"The group of characters mod 4 is isomorphic to {group_structure_4}.
