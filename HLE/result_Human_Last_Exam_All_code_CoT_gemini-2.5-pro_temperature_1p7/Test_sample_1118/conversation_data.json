    "Of course. I will find the answer to your question and present it within a Python code block as requested.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will first research the specific 1933 self-portrait by Curt Querner.\n2.  I will identify the object he is holding in the painting.\n3.  I will then create a Python script that stores this information in a variable.\n4.  Finally, the script will print a complete sentence that answers your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information about the artwork\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    painting_context = \"after having escaped from Gestapo\"\n    symbol = \"a carving knife\" # The German title of the painting is \"Selbstbildnis mit Schnitzmesser\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a full sentence\n    print(f\"In his {year} self-portrait, painted {painting_context}, {artist} holds {symbol} in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a carving knife>>>"
