def solve_dual_topology_problem():
    """
    This program calculates the maximum number of distinct topologies that can
    arise from iterating the dual operator. The solution is based on a known
    theorem in general topology.

    Let T_0 be the initial topology and T_n = d^n(T_0) be the topology
    after n iterations of the dual operator 'd'.

    A key mathematical result shows that there is a space for which the
    topologies T_0, T_1, ..., T_9 are all distinct, and the sequence becomes
    periodic due to the identity: T_10 = T_8. This means d^10(T) = d^8(T).

    This program simulates the generation of these topologies symbolically
    to count the number of unique topologies in this maximal sequence.
