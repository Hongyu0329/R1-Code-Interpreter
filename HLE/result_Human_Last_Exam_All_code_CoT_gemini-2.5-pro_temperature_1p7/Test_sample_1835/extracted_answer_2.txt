Yes. Based on the Generality Constraint, if you understand 'Fa' (and thus possess the concept 'F') and also understand universal quantification (possess the concept '∀'), you have all the necessary conceptual parts to understand '∀x Fx'. The constraint is precisely about this ability to recombine existing concepts to form new, intelligible thoughts.
