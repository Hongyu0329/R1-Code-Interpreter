    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Riddle:** The riddle provides a visual description of a character's components.\n    *   \"A wooden stick, hanging a square box...\": This describes the outer frame of the character. The \"square box\" is the radical `囗` (wéi). The \"wooden stick, hanging\" part is a poetic flourish to describe the frame.\n    *   \"...a ladder placed in the center.\": This describes the inner strokes of the character. The component `儿` (ér), which consists of two strokes, is creatively described as a \"ladder\".\n\n2.  **Assemble the Character:** By placing the \"ladder\" (`儿`) inside the \"square box\" (`囗`), we form the Chinese character `四` (sì).\n\n3.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will first print out the components of the riddle, as requested, and then print the final character that is formed by combining these components.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down into its visual components.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The riddle provides a visual breakdown of the character's strokes.\n    # Let's define the parts of the \"equation\".\n    part_1_description = \"A square box\"\n    part_1_component = \"囗\"\n\n    part_2_description = \"a ladder placed in the center\"\n    part_2_component = \"儿\"\n\n    print(\"Breaking down the riddle into its 'equation' components:\")\n    # The prompt requires outputting each part of the final equation.\n    print(f\"'{part_1_description}' refers to the outer frame: {part_1_component}\")\n    print(f\"'{part_2_description}' refers to the inner strokes: {part_2_component}\")\n\n    # Combining these components reveals the final character.\n    final_character = \"四\"\n\n    print(f\"\\nWhen you combine these parts, you get the final character: {final_character}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n<<<四>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center.
