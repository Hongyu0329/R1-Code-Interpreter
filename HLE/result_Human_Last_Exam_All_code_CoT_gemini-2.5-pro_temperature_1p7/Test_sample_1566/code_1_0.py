    # --- Introduction to the properties ---
    # Let X be a continuum (a compact, connected metric space).
    # Property (1): X has n end points, where 1 < n < infinity.
    # Property (2): X has exactly 2 orbits under its group of auto-homeomorphisms.

    # Step 1: Interpret the relationship between end points and orbits.
    print("\nStep 1: Relating end points to orbits.")
    print("The property of being an 'end point' is topological. This means the set of all end points, E, must be preserved by any homeomorphism.")
    print("Given that there are exactly two orbits (O1, O2), the set E must be one of them. Consequently, the set of all other points (non-end points, X\E) must be the other orbit.")
    print("This implies all end points are topologically identical, and all non-end points are topologically identical.")

    # Step 2: Use a local topological invariant: the order of a point.
    print("\nStep 2: Using the 'order' of a point.")
    print("A point's 'order' is a local topological property, so all points in an orbit must have the same order.")

    order_of_endpoints = 1

    print("Therefore, one orbit consists of points of order 1.")
    print("The second orbit (non-end points) must consist of points all having the same order, let's call it 'k'.")

    # Step 3: Determine the order 'k' for non-end points.
    print("\nStep 3: Determining the order of non-end points.")
    print("If k >= 3, the continuum would have 'branch points'. Any path leading to a branch point would consist of points of order 2.")
    print("This would mean the non-end points have different orders (2 and k), which contradicts them being in a single orbit.")
    print("Therefore, k cannot be 3 or higher. k also cannot be 1, as those are the end points.")
    order_of_non_endpoints = 2
    print(f"The only possibility is that the order of all non-end points is k = {order_of_non_endpoints}.")

    # Step 4: Identify the continuum's structure.
    print("\nStep 4: Identifying the continuum.")

    print("There are only two such topological structures:")

    print("  b) A simple arc (like the interval [0,1]): It has two end points of order 1, and all its other points are of order 2.")

    # Step 5: Verify the simple arc.
    print("\nStep 5: Verifying the simple arc against the properties.")
    # Check Property (1):
    num_endpoints_in_arc = 2
    print(f"An arc has exactly {num_endpoints_in_arc} end points. Since 1 < 2 < infinity, Property (1) is satisfied.")

    # Check Property (2):
    num_orbits_in_arc = 2
    print(f"An arc has exactly {num_orbits_in_arc} orbits: the set of its two end points, and the set of its interior points. Property (2) is satisfied.")

    print("\n" + "=" * 50)

    print("The simple arc is the only topological structure that satisfies both properties.")
