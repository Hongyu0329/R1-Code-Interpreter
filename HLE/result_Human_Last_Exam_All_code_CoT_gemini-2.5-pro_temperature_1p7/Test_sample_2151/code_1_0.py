# Plan Step 5 & 6: Determine the parameters k, c, and d.
# From the problem statement, we evaluate the initial conditions at x=0.
# u(0,0) = -2 + (1 - tanh(0)) / (e^0 + 1) = -2 + 1/2 = -1.5
# u_t(0,0) = 1/4 * (tanh(0)-1) * sech^2(0/2) * (tanh(0)-sech(0)-2)
#          = 1/4 * (-1) * 1^2 * (0 - 1 - 2) = 1/4 * (-1) * (-3) = 0.75

# We assume a solution u(x,t) = -1 - tanh(k*(x-c*t) + d).
# At (x,t)=(0,0), this gives u(0,0) = -1 - tanh(d).
# Equating gives: -1 - tanh(d) = -1.5  => tanh(d) = 0.5.
tanh_d = 0.5

# The time derivative is u_t(x,t) = k*c*sech^2(k*(x-c*t) + d).
# At (x,t)=(0,0), this gives u_t(0,0) = k*c*sech^2(d).
# We know sech^2(d) = 1 - tanh^2(d) = 1 - 0.5^2 = 0.75.
# Equating gives: k*c*(0.75) = 0.75 => k*c = 1.

# Substituting the solution form into the PDE yields the condition k*(c+1) = 2.
# We now solve the system of equations:
# 1) k*c = 1
# 2) k*(c+1) = 2
# From (1), c = 1/k. Substitute into (2): k*(1/k + 1) = 2 => 1 + k = 2 => k = 1.
# Then c = 1/k = 1.
k = 1
c = 1

# Plan Step 7: Define the specific solution.
# The solution is u(x,t) = -1 - tanh(x - t + d), with tanh(d)=0.5.

# Plan Step 8: Calculate the final quantity.
# We need to find -u(0,1)/2.
# First, find u(0,1).
# u(0,1) = -1 - tanh(0 - 1 + d) = -1 - tanh(d-1).

# We use the identity tanh(a-b) = (tanh(a)-tanh(b))/(1-tanh(a)tanh(b)).
# Here, a=d and b=1.
tanh_1 = math.tanh(1)
tanh_d_minus_1 = (tanh_d - tanh_1) / (1 - tanh_d * tanh_1)

# Now compute u(0,1).
u_0_1 = -1 - tanh_d_minus_1

# Finally, compute the required quantity -u(0,1)/2.
result = -u_0_1 / 2

# Output the components of the final calculation and the result.
