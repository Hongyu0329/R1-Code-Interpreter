    "Of course. To determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners, we first need to define what a Triple Crown is and compile a list of all the players who have achieved it.\n\nA batter wins the Triple Crown by leading their respective league (American or National) in three key statistics in the same season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI).\n\nRecords from early baseball history, particularly before the 20th century, can be inconsistent, leading to some sources citing different lists. The code below uses a comprehensive list that includes these earlier winners to identify each unique player who has won the award.\n\nThe Python script will:\n1.  Store a list of all Triple Crown-winning seasons.\n2.  Identify the unique players from this list.\n3.  Display each unique player, representing them as a '1' in a sum.\n4.  Calculate and print the total number of unique winners by adding them up.\n\n```python\ndef count_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the number of unique MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This list represents all recognized batting Triple Crown winning seasons in\n    # MLB history, including the American Association (AA), which was a major\n    # league in the 19th century.\n    triple_crown_seasons = [\n        {'player': 'Paul Hines', 'year': 1878, 'league': 'NL'},\n        {'player': 'Tip O\\'Neill', 'year': 1887, 'league': 'AA'},\n        {'player': 'Hugh Duffy', 'year': 1894, 'league': 'NL'},\n        {'player': 'Nap Lajoie', 'year': 1901, 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'player': 'Ty Cobb', 'year': 1909, 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'player': 'Heinie Zimmerman', 'year': 1912, 'league': 'NL'},\n        {'player': 'Rogers Hornsby', 'year': 1922, 'league': 'NL'},\n        {'player': 'Rogers Hornsby', 'year': 1925, 'league': 'NL'},\n        {'player': 'Jimmie Foxx', 'year': 1933, 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'player': 'Chuck Klein', 'year': 1933, 'league': 'NL'},\n        {'player': 'Lou Gehrig', 'year': 1934, 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'player': 'Joe Medwick', 'year': 1937, 'league': 'NL'},\n        {'player': 'Ted Williams', 'year': 1942, 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'player': 'Ted Williams', 'year': 1947, 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'player': 'Mickey Mantle', 'year': 1956, 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'player': 'Frank Robinson', 'year': 1966, 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'player': 'Carl Yastrzemski', 'year': 1967, 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'player': 'Miguel Cabrera', 'year': 2012, 'league': 'AL'}\n    ]\n\n    # Use a set to get a list of unique players, then sort it alphabetically.\n    # The question asks for the number of \"winners\", which implies unique people.\n    unique_winners = sorted(list(set(season['player'] for season in triple_crown_seasons)))\n    num_winners = len(unique_winners)\n\n    print(\"To find the total number of unique MLB Triple Crown winners, we add each player who has won the award:\")\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    # Display each unique player as '1' in our count.\n    for winner in unique_winners:\n        # Each player counts as 1 winner, regardless of how many times they won.\n        print(f\"1 ({winner})\")\n        equation_parts.append('1')\n        \n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_winners}\")\n\n# Run the function to display the result.\ncount_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<16>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
