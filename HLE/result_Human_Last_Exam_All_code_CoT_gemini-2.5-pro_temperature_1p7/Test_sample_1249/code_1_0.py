    Solves the abstract algebra problem based on the derived formulas.

    The derivation hinges on interpreting the setup within the standard framework of
    Hopf module algebras. Key derived results are that the group-like element g acts
    as zero (g · r = 0) and the action of x is given by left multiplication
    by w (x · r = wr), which generalizes to x^n · r = w^n r.
    """

    # Part (a): Find the condition for x^d a · r = 0.
    # The action is (x^d a) · r = x^d · (a · r).
    # Using our formula x^n · s = w^n s with n=d and s = a · r, we get:
    # x^d · (a · r) = w^d (a · r).
    # For this to be 0 for all a in A and r in R (assuming a non-trivial action),
    # the element w^d must be 0.
    part_a = "w^d = 0"

    # Part (b): Derive the expression for x^d · r.
    # Our inductive proof showed that x^n · r = w^n r for any n.
    # For n = d, the expression is w^d r.
    part_b = "w^d r"

    # Part (c): State whether x^j a · r for j >= M can be zero.
    # The expression is x^j a · r = w^j (a · r).
    # This expression can be zero under various conditions. A straightforward one
    # is if w is a nilpotent element. For instance, if w^M = 0, then for any
    # j >= M, w^j = w^(j-M) * w^M = w^(j-M) * 0 = 0.
    # Since nilpotency is a valid algebraic property, it is possible for the
    # expression to be zero.
