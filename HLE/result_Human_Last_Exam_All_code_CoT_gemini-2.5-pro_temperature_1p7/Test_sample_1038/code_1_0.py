    # --- Evaluation of Each Strategy ---

    # Strategy A
    print("Analysis of [A]: Minimum-length transistors with a small (~1 pF) capacitor.")
    print("  - PRO: A small capacitor allows for a very fast reset time (< 5 us), addressing the speed requirement.")
    print("  - CON: Extremely sensitive to charge injection from reset switches. This creates a large, unpredictable voltage error on the gate, which compromises the ability to handle sensor offsets accurately. Fails to balance reset speed with offset tolerance.")

    # Strategy B
    print("Analysis of [B]: Segmented gate capacitor refreshed by non-overlapping clocks.")
    print("  - PRO: Directly attempts to combat gate capacitor leakage over long periods.")
    print("  - CON: Introduces significant complexity and new problems. The clocking and switching action injects periodic noise, ripple, and charge errors onto the gate, degrading the amplifier's performance. The solution is worse than the original problem.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # Strategy C
    print("Analysis of [C]: On-chip body-bias generator.")
    print("  - PRO: Modifying the body bias can change the transistor's threshold voltage (Vt).")
    print("  - CON: The proposed implementation (forward biasing the body) would turn on parasitic diodes, leading to massive leakage and severely limiting the signal swing. This defeats the core goals of low leakage and handling a +/-100mV signal. It is fundamentally flawed for this application.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # Strategy D
    print("Analysis of [D]: Replacement with high-impedance current mirrors.")
    print("  - PRO: Eliminates the gate capacitor and its associated leakage entirely.")
    print("  - CON: This fundamentally changes the circuit's principle of operation. By fixing the gate voltage, it is no longer a 'bootstrapped' resistor with high AC impedance. The resistance becomes highly non-linear and dependent on the DC offset, failing the offset tolerance and high-resistance requirements.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # Strategy E
    print("Analysis of [E]: A single split-gate transistor.")
    print("  - PRO: This is an elegant and effective solution. The two halves of the split gate are inherently matched, mitigating a key source of error. The bootstrap principle is maintained for high impedance. The static gate adds a stable reference and tuning capability. Reset can be made fast and clean by controlling both gate halves.")
    print("  - CONCLUSION: This strategy best balances all conflicting needs. It provides a robust path for fast reset, preserves the high-impedance characteristic needed for the filter, and handles offset and mismatch more effectively than the other options.")
