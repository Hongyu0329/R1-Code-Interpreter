print("Riddle Analysis:")
print("1. The riddle mentions 'smoky cities' in 19th century Northern Europe, where visibility was poor. This points to an atmospheric or astronomical phenomenon.")
print("2. It contrasts this with Milan, implying 'THEM' were visible from there. This is a key geographical clue.")
print("3. It mentions Kasimir Graf, a German astronomer, and the need for 'imagination.' This strongly suggests a controversial astronomical observation.")
print("\nConnecting the Clues:")
print("- In 1877, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, observing from the Brera Observatory in Milan, reported seeing a network of lines on Mars.")
print("- He called these lines 'canali', which is Italian for 'channels'.")
print("- This was famously mistranslated into English as 'canals', fueling speculation about intelligent life on Mars.")
print("- These features were extremely difficult to see, and many other astronomers could not confirm them, especially from the smoggy, atmospherically-unstable cities of Northern Europe.")
print("- The inability to see them led many to believe they were an optical illusion or a product of the observer's 'imagination'.")

print("\nConclusion:")
print("Therefore, 'THEM' are the famous, controversial, and ultimately illusory:")
