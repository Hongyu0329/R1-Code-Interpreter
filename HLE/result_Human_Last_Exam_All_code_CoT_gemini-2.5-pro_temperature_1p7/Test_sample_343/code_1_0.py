    print("  - PDecide asks for the existence of a k-clique, an induced k-matching, or an induced k-by-k-biclique.")
    print("  - All three of these underlying decision problems are known to be W[1]-hard.")
    print("  - A problem that is a disjunction of several problems, one of which is W[1]-hard, is itself W[1]-hard.")
    print("  - Therefore, PDecide is W[1]-hard. Statement B is TRUE, and A is FALSE.")

    print("\n2. Analyzing PCount:")
    print("  - PCount asks for the total number of these three structures.")
    print("  - The corresponding counting problems (#k-clique, etc.) are all #W[1]-hard.")
    print("  - It can be shown that #k-CLIQUE is reducible to PCount via a parameterized reduction.")
    print("  - For instance, using a 'thickening' graph transformation G -> G_m, we get a relation:")
    k, m = 'k', 'm' # Symbolic variables
    print(f"    PCount(G_m, k) = C_clique(G,k)*{m}^{k} + (C_im(G,k) + C_ib(G,k))*{m}^{2*k}")
    print("  - By querying PCount for different values of m, we can solve for the coefficients, including the #k-clique count.")
    print("  - This reduction proves that PCount is #W[1]-hard. Statement D is TRUE, and C is FALSE.")

    print("\n3. Conclusion:")
    print("  - Both statements B and D are true.")
    print("  - The #W[1]-hardness of PCount (D) implies the W[1]-hardness of PDecide (B).")
    print("  - Thus, D is the stronger and more specific correct statement.")
