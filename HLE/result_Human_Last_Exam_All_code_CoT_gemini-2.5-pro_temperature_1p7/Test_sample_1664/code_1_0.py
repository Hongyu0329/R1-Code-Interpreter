        "2. **Deconstruct the Key Phrase:** The phrase 'that strange tarnished logic of their discipline' provides the poem's core meaning.",
        "   - **'Discipline'**: Refers to the human practice of specimen collection, likely the scientific discipline of entomology.",
        "   - **'Logic'**: The rationale of this discipline is to preserve an organism to study it.",
        "   - **'Tarnished'**: This logic is flawed or has degraded. The method of preservation is imperfect and ultimately leads to the decay ('dust') of the very thing it aims to preserve. The knowledge gained is from a 'tarnished' or imperfect version of the real thing.",
        "   - **'Strange'**: It points to the paradox of destroying life and removing it from its context in the name of studying it.",
        "3. **Conclusion:** The phrase suggests that the scientific practice of collecting specimens is paradoxical. While its logic is to preserve, the outcome is degradation. This directly points to choice B.",
        "4. **Evaluate Choices:**",
        "   - A, C, D focus on the behavior of living moths, but the poem is about dead specimens.",
        "   - E incorrectly assigns the 'logic' to the insects, when it belongs to the human collectors.",
        "   - B ('scientific specimen preservation can lead to degradation') perfectly captures the concept of a 'tarnished logic' within a scientific 'discipline'."
