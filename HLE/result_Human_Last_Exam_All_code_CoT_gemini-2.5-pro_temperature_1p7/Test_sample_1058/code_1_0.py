# Step 1: Analyze Neuronal Activity
print("\n1. Analysis of Neuronal Activity in the Amygdala:")
print(f"The PS amplitude in alcohol-preferring rats is {ps_amplitude_alcohol_pref} mV.")
print(f"The PS amplitude in sucrose-preferring rats is {ps_amplitude_sucrose_pref} mV.")
# In electrophysiology, the absolute amplitude of the population spike reflects the number of neurons firing synchronously.
if abs(ps_amplitude_alcohol_pref) > abs(ps_amplitude_sucrose_pref):
    print(f"Since |{ps_amplitude_alcohol_pref}| > |{ps_amplitude_sucrose_pref}|, the alcohol-preferring rats show increased neuronal responsiveness/excitability in the amygdala.")
    print("Conclusion 1: The statement 'Alcohol-preferring rats show increased neuronal activity' is correct.")
else:
    print(f"Since |{ps_amplitude_alcohol_pref}| <= |{ps_amplitude_sucrose_pref}|, the alcohol-preferring rats do not show increased neuronal responsiveness/excitability in the amygdala.")

# Step 2: Analyze the Slc6a11 Knockdown Experiment
print("\n2. Analysis of the Gene Knockdown Experiment:")
print("The gene Slc6a11 codes for a GABA transporter (GAT-3), which removes GABA from the synapse.")
print("Knocking down this gene leads to an increase in extracellular GABA.")
print(f"Sucrose-preferring rats with Slc6a11 knocked down have a PS amplitude of {ps_amplitude_shRNA_knockdown} mV.")
print(f"This is very similar to the PS amplitude of alcohol-preferring rats ({ps_amplitude_alcohol_pref} mV).")
print("Conclusion 2: Since mimicking a state of high extracellular GABA in sucrose-preferring rats replicates the phenotype of alcohol-preferring rats, it is highly likely that alcohol-preferring rats have a higher level of extracellular GABA.")

# Step 3: Infer Tonic Inhibition
print("\n3. Inference on Tonic Inhibition:")
print("Tonic inhibition is persistent inhibition caused by ambient, extracellular GABA acting on GABA receptors.")
print("Based on Conclusion 2, since alcohol-preferring rats likely have higher extracellular GABA, they will also experience increased tonic inhibition.")
print("Conclusion 3: The statement 'Alcohol-preferring rats have increased tonic inhibition in the amygdala' is correct.")

# Step 4: Evaluate Potential Treatment
print("\n4. Evaluation of Therapeutic Strategy:")
print("The core issue appears to be excessive GABAergic signaling (higher extracellular GABA, increased tonic inhibition).")
print("A GABA receptor agonist would mimic or enhance the effect of GABA, likely worsening the condition.")
print("A GABA receptor antagonist would block or reduce the effect of GABA, and therefore might counteract the observed phenotype and reduce alcohol self-administration.")
print("Conclusion 4: The statement 'GABA receptor antagonists may decrease the self-administration of alcohol' is a logical therapeutic hypothesis.")

# Step 5: Evaluate Answer Choices and Final Selection
print("\n5. Final Evaluation:")
print("Let's evaluate the answer choices based on our conclusions:")
print("- Conclusion 1 (Increased activity) eliminates options that state decreased activity (e.g., Choice B).")
print("- Conclusion 2 (Higher GABA) eliminates options that state lower GABA (e.g., Choice E).")
print("- Conclusion 3 (Increased tonic inhibition in alcohol-preferring rats) eliminates options that state the opposite (e.g., Choice F and H).")
print("- Conclusion 4 (Antagonist, not agonist) eliminates options suggesting an agonist would be helpful (e.g., Choices C, D, F).")
print("\nChoice G states:")
print(" - Alcohol-preferring rats show incresed neuronal activity in the amygdala. (Matches Conclusion 1)")
print(" - GABA receptor antagonists may decrease the self-administration of alcohol... (Matches Conclusion 4)")
print(" - The level of extracellular GABA is higher in the alcohol-preferring rats. (Matches Conclusion 2)")
print(" - Alcohol-preferring rats have increased tonic inhibition... (Matches Conclusion 3)")
print("\nAll statements in Choice G are consistent with our analysis of the provided data.")
