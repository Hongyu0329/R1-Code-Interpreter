    # Step 1: Define the core clinical problem.
    # The patient received a stent in the Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA).
    # The primary risk after this procedure is in-stent restenosis (the artery re-narrowing).
    # The goal of surveillance is to detect this early.
    print("Clinical Problem: Determining the best surveillance after SFA stenting.")
    print("Key Consideration: High risk of in-stent restenosis, especially in the first year.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 2: Compare surveillance methods: ABI vs. Arterial Duplex Ultrasound.
    print("Comparing Surveillance Tools:")
    print(" - Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI): Good for initial diagnosis, but not sensitive enough for detecting early, focal restenosis inside a stent.")
    print(" - Arterial Duplex Ultrasound: The gold standard. It directly visualizes the stent and measures blood flow velocities, allowing for early detection of restenosis before symptoms recur.")
    print("Conclusion: Arterial duplex is the superior method for this type of surveillance.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 3: Evaluate the surveillance schedules provided in the options.
    # Restenosis occurs most frequently within the first year.
    print("Evaluating Surveillance Schedules:")
    print(" - Schedules must be more frequent in the first year.")
    print(" - A schedule of follow-ups at 3, 6, and 12 months is standard practice.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 4: Analyze the options based on the above criteria.
    print("Analyzing the Choices:")
    print("A & C: Inadequate. They rely on ABI, not the more sensitive duplex ultrasound.")
    print("E: Inadequate. Annual surveillance is not frequent enough for the first year.")
    print("B: Uses duplex, but the schedule (1, 3, 12 months) has a long gap where restenosis could be missed.")
    print("D: Optimal. Uses the correct tool (arterial duplex) with a standard, robust schedule (3, 6, 12 months, and 2 years) that covers the critical first year effectively and provides long-term follow-up.")
    print("-" * 30)
