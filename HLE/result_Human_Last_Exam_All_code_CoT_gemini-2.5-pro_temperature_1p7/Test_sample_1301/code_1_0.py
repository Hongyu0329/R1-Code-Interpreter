    This function solves the molecular design puzzle and prints the final molecule in SMILES format.
    The process involves:
    1.  Deducing the molecular formula (C12H18O6) from the given constraints.
    2.  Verifying the degrees of unsaturation (3 rings + 1 double bond = 4).
    3.  Constructing a molecule that fits all structural constraints (tricyclic, rigid, specific functional groups).
    4.  The final structure is a complex polycyclic ether and ketone.
