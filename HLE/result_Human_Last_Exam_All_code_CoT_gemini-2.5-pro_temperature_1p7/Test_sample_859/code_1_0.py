    This function calculates the minimal number of new edges to make the graph G' 2-edge-connected.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Let G be an undirected graph with edge connectivity 2.
    2. Let v1, v2, v3 be three vertices forming an independent set with degrees d, d+1, d+1, where d is an even integer.
    3. Let G' be the graph G - {v1, v2, v3}.
    4. We want to find the minimal number of edges to add to G' to make it 2-edge-connected.

    The solution can be found by simplifying the problem.
    Since deg(v1) = d is even, we can apply a "splitting" operation on v1. This operation removes v1 and adds d/2 edges between its neighbors, creating a new graph G0 that is still 2-edge-connected.
    The problem then becomes finding the number of edges to add to G0 - {v2, v3}.
    The number of edges to add to the original G' (N) is the sum of the edges from splitting v1 and the edges needed to fix the graph after removing v2 and v3 (N0).
    So, N = d/2 + N0.

    It is a known result that if we remove two non-adjacent vertices (v2 and v3 are non-adjacent) from a 2-edge-connected graph (G0), the resulting graph needs at least 1 edge to be made 2-edge-connected again. So, N0 >= 1.
    
    Therefore, the minimal number of edges required is d/2 + 1.
    
    This script will take the value of d as input and calculate this result.
