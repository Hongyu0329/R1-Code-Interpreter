# Step 1: Calculate the number of arrangements for the large package
# There are 9 distinct red candles for 9 horizontal positions (9!) and
# 9 distinct green candles for 9 vertical positions (9!).

# Step 2: Calculate the number of arrangements for the small package
# There are 16 distinct candles (8 red, 8 green) for 16 horizontal positions.
small_pkg_arrangements = math.factorial(16)

# Step 3: Calculate the ratio
# Using floating-point division to get the ratio
