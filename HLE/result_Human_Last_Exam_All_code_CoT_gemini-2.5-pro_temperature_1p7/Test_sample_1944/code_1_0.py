    # In JavaScript:
    # ! ![] represents `true`, which is 1 in numeric context.

    # +[] represents 0.
    
    # The obfuscated code constructs a very long string. Let's see how it starts.
    # The expression starts with a series of `!![]` additions.
    first_part = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
    
    # Then it concatenates it with an array containing the same sum.
