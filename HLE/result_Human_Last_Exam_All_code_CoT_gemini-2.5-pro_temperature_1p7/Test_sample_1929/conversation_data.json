    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to present the solution.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze Reactants and Reaction Type**: The reaction involves 1,3-butadiene (CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂). Butadiene is a conjugated diene, and the substituted ethene is a dienophile. This combination is set up for a Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n2.  **Describe the Mechanism**: The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The four pi electrons from the diene and the two pi electrons from the dienophile rearrange to form a new six-membered ring containing one double bond.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product**:\n    *   The four carbons from butadiene and the two carbons from the dienophile form a cyclohexene ring.\n    *   A new double bond forms between carbons 2 and 3 of the original butadiene molecule.\n    *   The two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms from the dienophile remain attached to their respective carbons, which are now part of the saturated portion of the new ring.\n    *   The final product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Chemical Equation**:\n    *   Butadiene: C₄H₆\n    *   1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene: C₂Cl₂F₂\n    *   Since this is an addition reaction, the product's formula is the sum of the reactants' formulas: C₆H₆Cl₂F₂.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that defines the chemical formulas of the reactants, calculates the formula of the product, and prints the full chemical equation. This will display all the numerical subscripts present in the reaction equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# Define the molecular formulas of the reactants\nbutadiene_formula = \"C4H6\"\ndienophile_formula = \"C2Cl2F2\"\n\n# In a Diels-Alder reaction, the atoms of the reactants combine to form a single product.\n# We can determine the product's formula by summing the atoms.\nreactant1_atoms = {'C': 4, 'H': 6}\nreactant2_atoms = {'C': 2, 'Cl': 2, 'F': 2}\n\n# Calculate the atoms in the product\nproduct_atoms = {\n    'C': reactant1_atoms.get('C', 0) + reactant2_atoms.get('C', 0),\n    'H': reactant1_atoms.get('H', 0) + reactant2_atoms.get('H', 0),\n    'Cl': reactant1_atoms.get('Cl', 0) + reactant2_atoms.get('Cl', 0),\n    'F': reactant1_atoms.get('F', 0) + reactant2_atoms.get('F', 0),\n}\n\n# Construct the product formula string\nproduct_formula = (\n    f\"C{product_atoms['C']}\"\n    f\"H{product_atoms['H']}\"\n    f\"Cl{product_atoms['Cl']}\"\n    f\"F{product_atoms['F']}\"\n)\n\n# The name of the product\nproduct_name = \"4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene\"\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation\nprint(f\"The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a Diels-Alder reaction.\")\nprint(f\"The product is {product_name}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{butadiene_formula} + {dienophile_formula} -> {product_formula}\")\n```\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
