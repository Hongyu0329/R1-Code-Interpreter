    "Yes, if a Schwartz function $f$ satisfies $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$, it must be that $f(x)=0$ for all $x$.\n\nThe standard proof for this involves the Fourier transform. The plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, of the function $f(x)$.\n2.  Show that the given condition on the moments of $f(x)$ implies that all derivatives of its Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi)$, are zero at $\\xi=0$.\n3.  A key property is that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is analytic. An analytic function whose derivatives are all zero at a point must be identically zero in its domain. Therefore, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)=0$ for all $\\xi$.\n4.  The Fourier transform is an invertible operation on the space of Schwartz functions. If the transform of a function is zero, the function itself must be zero.\n5.  Conclude that $f(x) = 0$.\n\nHere is a Python script that prints out the detailed reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef explain_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the proof that if all moments of a Schwartz function f are zero,\n    then f must be the zero function.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Yes, it follows that f = 0.
