    "Of course. Here is the thinking process and the Python script to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Plan Breakdown\n\n1.  **Identify Base Values:** First, I need to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu and its specific health multiplier for Expert Mode. According to the official Terraria Wiki, which references the game's source code:\n    *   Base Health: 2800\n    *   Expert Mode Health (for 1 player): 3640. This means the Expert Mode multiplier is 3640 / 2800 = 1.3.\n\n2.  **Identify the Multiplayer Scaling Formula:** Next, I'll find the formula for how enemy health scales with the number of players. For Expert Mode, the formula is:\n    *   `PlayerHealthMultiplier = 1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1)`\n\n3.  **Combine Formulas:** I will combine these values into a single equation to calculate the total health for a given number of players (`n`):\n    *   `TotalHealth(n) = BaseHealth * ExpertMultiplier * PlayerHealthMultiplier`\n    *   `TotalHealth(n) = 2800 * 1.3 * (1 + 0.35 * (n - 1))`\n\n4.  **Analyze for Infinite Players:** The request asks for the theoretical maximum health with an *infinite* number of players. This is a limit problem where we find what happens as `n` approaches infinity.\n    *   I will simplify the combined formula into the linear form `y = mx + c`, which will clearly show how health changes as the number of players (`n`) increases.\n    *   As the formula is linear with a positive slope, the health will increase indefinitely with the number of players. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health is infinite.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that performs and explains these steps, printing the final simplified equation and stating the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_eoc_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the base constants from the game's code.\n    base_health = 2800\n    expert_mode_health_solo = 3640\n\n    # The Expert Mode multiplier is the ratio of solo expert health to base health.\n    expert_multiplier = expert_mode_health_solo / base_health\n\n    # Step 2: Define the multiplayer health scaling factor per player (after the first).\n    player_scaling_factor = 0.35\n\n    print(\"The formula for boss health in Expert Mode multiplayer is:\")\n    print(\"Total Health = Base Health * Expert Multiplier * (1 + Player Scaling Factor * (n - 1))\\n\")\n\n    print(\"For the Eye of Cthulhu:\")\n    print(f\"Base Health = {base_health}\")\n    print(f\"Expert Multiplier = {expert_mode_health_solo} / {base_health} = {expert_multiplier}\")\n    print(f\"Player Scaling Factor = {player_scaling_factor}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Let 'n' be the number of players.\")\n    print(\"The formula is: Health(n) = 2800 * 1.3 * (1 + 0.35 * (n - 1))\")\n    print(\"Simplifying the expression:\")\n    print(\"Health(n) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35n - 0.35)\")\n    print(\"Health(n) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35n)\")\n    print(\"Health(n) = (3640 * 0.65) + (3640 * 0.35)n\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the final simplified linear equation terms.\n    # This is the y = mx + c form, where x is n.\n    health_intercept = base_health * expert_multiplier * (1 - player_scaling_factor)\n    health_slope = base_health * expert_multiplier * player_scaling_factor\n\n    print(\"This gives us the final simplified linear equation:\")\n    print(f\"Health(n) = {int(health_slope)}n + {int(health_intercept)}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"As you can see, the health of the Eye of Cthulhu is a linear function of 'n', the number of players.\")\n    print(\"As 'n' approaches infinity, the total health also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, there is no finite theoretical maximum health.\")\n\ncalculate_eoc_health()\n```\n<<<infinity>>>"
