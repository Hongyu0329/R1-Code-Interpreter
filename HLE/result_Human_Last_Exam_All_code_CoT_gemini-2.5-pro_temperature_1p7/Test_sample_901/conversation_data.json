    "My plan to solve this organic chemistry problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:** I will identify the substrate, ((1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane), and the reagent, (potassium tert-butoxide). The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring, and the reagent is a strong, bulky base. This combination strongly suggests an E2 elimination reaction.\n2.  **Recall the E2 Mechanism Requirements:** The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed (the β-hydrogen) must be in an *anti-periplanar* arrangement. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means they must both be in axial positions and on opposite sides of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down). This is often called a *trans-diaxial* arrangement.\n3.  **Draw and Analyze the Chair Conformations:** The substrate, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, has its two substituents (Br and methyl) in a *trans* relationship. A 1,2-trans disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations: one where both substituents are equatorial (diequatorial) and another where both are axial (diaxial).\n4.  **Determine the Reactive Conformation:** E2 elimination can only proceed from the conformer where the leaving group (Br) is axial. Therefore, the reaction must happen via the less stable diaxial conformer, even though the more stable diequatorial conformer is more populated at equilibrium.\n5.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways:** From the reactive diaxial conformer (Br is axial), I will look at the two adjacent carbons (β-carbons) for anti-periplanar protons.\n    *   **β-carbon 2:** This carbon has the methyl group. In the diaxial conformation, if Br is axial, the *trans* methyl group must also be axial. This means the proton on C2 is in an *equatorial* position. It is not anti-periplanar to the axial Br, so elimination to form the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene) cannot occur.\n    *   **β-carbon 6:** This carbon has two protons, one of which is axial. This axial proton *is* anti-periplanar to the axial Br on C1.\n6.  **Conclude the Product:** Since elimination is only stereochemically possible by removing a proton from C6, only one product can be formed. The double bond will form between C1 and C6. The resulting alkene is named 3-methylcyclohexene. The bulky nature of the base is consistent with this outcome, but the stereochemistry of the substrate is the deciding factor.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the E2 reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and identifies the product.\n    \"\"\"\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 elimination\"\n\n    print(f\"Reaction Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"Substrate: {substrate}\")\n    print(f\"Reagent: {reagent} (a strong, bulky base)\")\n    print(f\"This is an {reaction_type} reaction.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the stereochemical requirement for E2 reactions on a cyclohexane ring.\")\n    print(\"The E2 mechanism requires the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton (a proton on an adjacent carbon) to be anti-periplanar.\")\n    print(\"In a chair conformation, this means both the leaving group and the beta-proton must be in AXIAL positions (trans-diaxial).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the conformations of the substrate.\")\n    print(f\"In {substrate}, the bromo group at C1 and the methyl group at C2 are 'trans' to each other.\")\n    print(\"This 'trans' arrangement can exist in two chair conformations in equilibrium:\")\n    print(\"  a) Diequatorial Conformer: Br is equatorial, and the methyl group is equatorial.
