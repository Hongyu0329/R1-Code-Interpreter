    "In a film's dance scene, the sound elements are mixed to emphasize the core components of the scene: rhythm, movement, and emotion. My plan is to first establish the hierarchy based on the function of each sound element and then write a Python script to present this ranking clearly.\n\n1.  **Music:** This is the most important element. It provides the rhythm, tempo, and emotional foundation for the dance. The choreography is almost always created specifically for the music, making it the central pillar of the scene.\n2.  **Sound Effects:** These are next in importance. Sound effects include footsteps, the rustle of clothing, taps in a tap dance, and ambient sounds of the location. They ground the scene in reality, add texture, and emphasize the physicality of the dancers' movements.\n3.  **Speech:** This is the least important element in a typical dance scene. Dialogue is often minimal or entirely absent because it can distract from the music and the visual storytelling of the dance. When present, it is usually mixed lower than the music.\n\nFollowing this logic, I will now provide a Python script that outputs the determined hierarchy.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sound_hierarchy():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the hierarchy of sound importance in film dance scenes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The hierarchy is established based on the primary role of each sound element in a dance scene.\n    # 1. Music is the foundation for rhythm and emotion.\n    # 2. Sound Effects provide texture and realism to the movement.\n    # 3. Speech is typically minimized to not distract from the dance.\n    sound_hierarchy = {\n        1: \"Music\",\n        2: \"Sound Effects\",\n        3: \"Speech\"\n    }\n\n    # To satisfy the prompt's instruction to \"output each number in the final equation\",\n    # we will format the output to present each element with its rank number.\n    ranked_list = []\n    for rank in sorted(sound_hierarchy.keys()):\n        element = sound_hierarchy[rank]\n        # We create a string \"Rank. Element\" for each item.\n        ranked_list.append(f\"{rank}. {element}\")\n\n    # The final string represents the hierarchy \"equation\".\n    final_output = \", \".join(ranked_list)\n\n    print(f\"The hierarchy of sound importance is: {final_output}\")\n\nsolve_sound_hierarchy()\n```\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"
