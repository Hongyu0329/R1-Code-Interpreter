    This function calculates the k-th element of the recursively defined sequence S_n.
    It uses the optimal method based on the sequence's mathematical properties.

    The problem states that n and k are very large ( > INT_MAX/2), so we represent
    them as strings and convert them to Python's arbitrary-precision integers.

    # and the memory-intensive generation of the sequence.

    # The exponent, 2, is the number of trailing zeros.
