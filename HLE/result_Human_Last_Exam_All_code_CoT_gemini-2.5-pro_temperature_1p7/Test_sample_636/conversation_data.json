    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to calculate the state feedback gain matrix F:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The objective is to find a matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial:** For a 2x2 system, the characteristic polynomial is `det(sI - A_cl) = 0`. If the roots (eigenvalues) are `p1` and `p2`, the polynomial is `(s - p1)(s - p2) = s^2 - (p1 + p2)s + p1*p2 = 0`.\n    *   `p1 + p2 = (-1 + j) + (-1 - j) = -2`\n    *   `p1 * p2 = (-1 + j)(-1 - j) = (-1)^2 - j^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2`\n    *   So, the desired characteristic polynomial is `s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\n\n3.  **Construct a Target Closed-Loop Matrix (`A_cl`):** We can choose a target matrix `A_cl` that has this characteristic polynomial. A standard choice is the \"controller companion form\":\n    `A_cl = [[0, 1], [-a0, -a1]]` where the polynomial is `s^2 + a1*s + a0`.\n    In our case, `a0 = 2` and `a1 = 2`, so our target matrix is `A_cl = [[0, 1], [-2, -2]]`.\n\n4.  **Solve for F:** Now we solve the matrix equation `A + BF = A_cl`.\n    *   Rearranging gives `BF = A_cl - A`.\n    *   In this specific problem, the matrix `B` is square and invertible. This allows us to find a unique solution for `F` for our chosen `A_cl` by pre-multiplying by the inverse of `B`: `F = B_inv * (A_cl - A)`.\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script using the `numpy` library to perform these matrix calculations, print the resulting matrix `F`, and verify that the eigenvalues of `A + BF` are correct.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set print options for better readability\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)\n\n# Step 1: Define the system and input matrices A and B.\nA = np.array([[-1, 1],\n              [1, 0]])\nB = np.array([[1, 2],\n              [1, 0]])\n\n# Step 2: Define the desired eigenvalues and find the target closed-loop matrix.\n# The desired characteristic polynomial for eigenvalues -1 Â± j is s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0.\n# We choose a target matrix A_cl (in companion form) with this polynomial.\nA_cl_desired = np.array([[0,   1],\n                         [-2, -2]])\n\n# Step 3: Solve the equation A + B*F = A_cl for F.\n# This becomes F = inv(B) * (A_cl - A)\ntry:\n    F = np.linalg.inv(B) @ (A_cl_desired - A)\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"Matrix B is not invertible. This specific method fails.\")\n    F = None\n\nif F is not None:\n    # Step 4: Print all the matrices and the final verification.\n    print(\"--- System Matrices ---\")\n    print(f\"A =\\n{A}\\n\")\n    print(f\"B =\\n{B}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"The calculated state feedback gain matrix F is:\")\n    print(F)\n    print(\"\\nThis F is the solution to the equation A + B*F = A_cl, where A_cl is:\")\n    print(A_cl_desired)\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Verification ---\")\n    # The resulting closed-loop system from A + B*F\n    A_cl_final = A + B @ F\n\n    # Calculate the eigenvalues of the final closed-loop system\n    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_cl_final)\n    \n    print(\"The resulting closed-loop matrix A + B*F is:\")\n    print(A_cl_final)\n    print(\"\\nThe eigenvalues of the final closed-loop system A + B*F are:\")\n    print(eigenvalues)\n    print(\"\\nThese match the desired eigenvalues: [-1.+1.j, -1.-1.j]\")\n\n```\n<<<[[-3., -2.], [ 2.,  1.]]>>>"
