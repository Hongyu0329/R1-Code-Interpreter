# Step 1: Establish the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution.
# Any real-world political map graph is planar, and by the Four-Color Theorem, requires at most 4 colors.
# The Asian map, with its complex set of borders, is known to require exactly 4 colors.
chromatic_number_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph before 1991 (chi_before) = {chromatic_number_before}")

# Step 2: Establish the chromatic number of the Asian country graph after the Soviet dissolution.
# The new graph is still a planar map, so its chromatic number cannot exceed 4.
# The dissolution added nodes and edges, creating a more complex graph. A more complex graph cannot have a lower chromatic number.
# Therefore, chi_before <= chi_after. Since chi_before = 4 and chi_after <= 4, the new number must also be 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph after 1991 (chi_after) = {chromatic_number_after}")

# Step 3: Calculate the incremental change, delta_soviet.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The change in chromatic number (delta_soviet) is {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}")

# Step 4: Determine beta based on the change in planarity.
# A graph of bordering countries is inherently planar. This property did not change with the creation of new countries.
# The problem states beta=1 if planarity did not change.
beta = 1
print(f"The property of planarity did not change, so beta = {beta}")

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final answer is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")
