    "Here is a plan to calculate the total welfare:\n\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** The first step is to find the equilibrium point where the supply and demand curves intersect. This is achieved by setting the supply price equal to the demand price (`P_S = P_D`) and solving for the equilibrium quantity (`Q_e`).\n    *   `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`\n    *   This equation is complex and will be solved numerically using a Python function.\n    *   Once `Q_e` is found, the equilibrium price `P_e` can be calculated by substituting `Q_e` into either the supply or demand function.\n\n2.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):** Consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from Q=0 to Q=Q_e. It represents the total benefit to consumers.\n    *   `CS = ∫[0 to Q_e] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - P_e * Q_e`\n    *   This definite integral will be calculated numerically.\n\n3.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):** Producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price, from the minimum production quantity to Q=Q_e. It represents the total benefit to producers.\n    *   Note that the supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined for `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. This is the minimum quantity.\n    *   `PS = P_e * Q_e - ∫[2^(1/3) to Q_e] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n    *   This definite integral will also be calculated numerically.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.\n    *   `Total Welfare = CS + PS`\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps to find the total welfare.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_and_print_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the market equilibrium, consumer surplus,\n    producer surplus, and total welfare based on the given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
