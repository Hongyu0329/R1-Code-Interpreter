# Plan:
# 1. Count the total number of knot types with 7 crossings, including both prime and composite knots.
# 2. Count how many of these knot types are hyperbolic.
# 3. Calculate the proportion of hyperbolic knots.

# Step 1: Count all knot types with 7 crossings.
# According to the Rolfsen knot table, there are 7 prime knots with 7 crossings.
num_prime_knots = 7

# Composite knots with 7 crossings must be a sum of knots with fewer crossings.
# The only partition of 7 into two integers >= 3 (the smallest crossing number) is 3 + 4.
# There is one knot with 3 crossings (3_1) and one with 4 crossings (4_1).
# So there is 1*1 = 1 composite knot with 7 crossings (3_1 # 4_1).
num_composite_knots = 1

# The total number of knot types is the sum of prime and composite knots.
total_knot_types = num_prime_knots + num_composite_knots

print(f"Total number of prime knots with 7 crossings: {num_prime_knots}")
print(f"Total number of composite knots with 7 crossings: {num_composite_knots}")
print(f"Total number of knot types with 7 crossings = {num_prime_knots} + {num_composite_knots} = {total_knot_types}")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 2: Count the hyperbolic knots among them.
# A prime knot is either a torus knot or hyperbolic.
# The only torus knot with 7 crossings is 7_1.
# So, the number of hyperbolic prime knots is the total number of prime knots minus 1.
num_hyperbolic_prime_knots = num_prime_knots - 1

# Composite knots are never hyperbolic.
num_hyperbolic_composite_knots = 0

# The total number of hyperbolic knots is the sum from both categories.
total_hyperbolic_knots = num_hyperbolic_prime_knots + num_hyperbolic_composite_knots

print(f"Number of hyperbolic prime knots with 7 crossings: {num_hyperbolic_prime_knots}")
print(f"Number of hyperbolic composite knots with 7 crossings: {num_hyperbolic_composite_knots}")
print(f"Total number of hyperbolic knots with 7 crossings = {num_hyperbolic_prime_knots} + {num_hyperbolic_composite_knots} = {total_hyperbolic_knots}")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 3: Calculate the proportion.
proportion = total_hyperbolic_knots / total_knot_types

print("The proportion of hyperbolic knots is the ratio of hyperbolic knots to the total number of knots.")
print(f"Proportion = {total_hyperbolic_knots} / {total_knot_types} = {proportion}")
