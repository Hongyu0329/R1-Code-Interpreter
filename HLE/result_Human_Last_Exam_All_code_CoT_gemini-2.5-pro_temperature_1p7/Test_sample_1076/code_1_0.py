    This function provides the answer to a specific question about
    Rudolf Nureyev's performance in the 1966 production of Swan Lake.
    
    The question is: how many double cabriole derrières did Nureyev
    (as Prince Siegfried) perform during Act III, before Fontyen's
    solo as Odile?
    
    This information is based on analysis of the historical film of
    the performance. Nureyev's Act III variation is legendary for its
    technical difficulty. A key part of this solo is a diagonal sequence
    of powerful jumps.
