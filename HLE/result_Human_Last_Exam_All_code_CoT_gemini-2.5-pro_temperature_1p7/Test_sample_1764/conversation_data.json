    "My plan to solve this problem is to analyze the set of isometric embeddings from a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$. The goal is to find the minimum possible size of this set, given that it is non-empty.\n\nHere are the steps of my reasoning:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: An isometric embedding is a function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, i.e., $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d_X(x, y)$ for all $x, y \\in X$. We are looking for the minimum size of the set of all such functions, $\\text{Isom}(X, B)$, by choosing appropriate $X$ and $B$. The problem statement implies we only consider pairs $(X, B)$ for which at least one such embedding exists.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Impact of Isometries of B**: A key property of a Banach space $B$ is that it is a vector space, and thus has translational symmetry. If $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding, then for any vector $b \\in B$, the translated function $g_b(x) = f(x) + b$ is also an isometric embedding. This is because $\\|g_b(x) - g_b(y)\\| = \\|(f(x)+b) - (f(y)+b)\\| = \\|f(x)-f(y)\\| = d(x,y)$.\n\n3.  **Case 1: Non-trivial Banach Space**: Let's consider any non-trivial Banach space, i.e., $B \\ne \\{0\\}$. In this case, there exists at least one non-zero vector $b \\in B$. If there is at least one embedding $f$, then the translation $g_b(x) = f(x)+b$ is a *different* embedding because $g_b(x) \\neq f(x)$. If the base field is $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, there are infinitely many such translations, leading to infinitely many embeddings. If we consider Banach spaces over finite fields (which are also valid), the smallest non-trivial space has at least two elements (e.g., $\\mathbb{F}_2$). Therefore, if $B$ is non-trivial, and an embedding exists, the number of embeddings must be at least $|B| \\ge 2$. We can find an example with exactly 2 embeddings: take $X=\\{p_1,p_2\\}$ with $d(p_1,p_2)=1$ and $B=\\mathbb{F}_2$ with the discrete norm ($\\|0\\|=0, \\|1\\|=1$). The two embeddings are $f_1(p_1)=0, f_1(p_2)=1$ and $f_2(p_1)=1, f_2(p_2)=0$. So, the minimum for this case is 2.\n\n4.  **Case 2: Trivial Banach Space**: The only way to avoid having multiple embeddings via translation is if there are no non-zero vectors to translate by. This happens only if $B$ is the trivial Banach space $B = \\{0\\}$. This space has cardinality $K=1$.\n\n5.  **Embedding into the Trivial Space**: Let's check if an embedding can exist into $B = \\{0\\}$. An embedding $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$ must satisfy $d(x,y) = \\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = \\|0-0\\| = 0$ for all $x,y \\in X$. This condition implies that the distance between any two points in $X$ must be zero. This is only possible if $X$ contains exactly one point. A one-point space, say $X=\\{p\\}$, with $d(p,p)=0$, is a valid finite ultrametric space.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Number of Embeddings**: We now determine the number of embeddings from $X=\\{p\\}$ to $B=\\{0\\}$. There is only one possible function between these two sets: $f(p)=0$. We must check if it is isometric: $\\|f(p)-f(p)\\| = d(p,p)$. This becomes $\\|0-0\\| = 0$, which is true. So, there is exactly one isometric embedding.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: We have found that for any non-trivial Banach space, the number of embeddings is at least 2. For the trivial Banach space $B=\\{0\\}$, an embedding is only possible if $X$ is a one-point space, in which case there is exactly 1 embedding. Since the problem asks for the smallest possible number (given that embeddings exist), the minimum is 1.\n\nThe python code below formalizes this reasoning to arrive at the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings\n    of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let N be the number of isometric embeddings.
