    # Let N be the number of isometric embeddings. We want to find the minimum
    # possible value of N, given that at least one embedding exists.

    # We consider two cases for the Banach space B.

    # Case 1: B is a non-trivial Banach space (B is not just {0}).
    # Let f be an isometric embedding from X to B. For any vector b in B, the
    # function g(x) = f(x) + b is also an isometric embedding.
    # If B is non-trivial, it contains at least one non-zero vector.
    # The smallest non-trivial Banach spaces have cardinality 2 (e.g., the field F_2).
    # Thus, if an embedding exists for a non-trivial B, there must be at least 2 embeddings.
    # For example, for X={p1, p2} with d(p1,p2)=1 and B=F_2, there are 2 embeddings.

    # Case 2: B is the trivial Banach space, B = {0}. Its cardinality is 1.
    # An isometric embedding f: X -> {0} must satisfy d(x,y) = ||f(x)-f(y)|| = ||0-0|| = 0.
    # This means embeddings exist only if all distances in X are 0, which requires X to
    # be a single-point space.
    # Let X = {p}. This is a valid finite ultrametric space.
    # The only function f: {p} -> {0} is f(p) = 0.
    # This function is an isometric embedding since ||f(p)-f(p)|| = 0 = d(p,p).
    # Therefore, for this choice of X and B, there is exactly one embedding.
