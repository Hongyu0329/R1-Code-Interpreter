# Based on the analysis of the system of differential equations, the set of
# initial values (x0, y0, z0) for which solutions exist forms a sphere
# defined by the equation: x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2 = R^2.

# From the problem statement and solvability conditions, we determined R^2.
# The given value C in the constraint is 10^25.
val_given = 10**25
r_squared = val_given / 2

# The problem asks for the surface area of this sphere.
# The formula for the surface area of a sphere is A = 4 * pi * R^2.
# Substituting our R^2, we get: A = 4 * pi * (10^25 / 2), which simplifies to A = 2 * pi * 10^25.

# Constants for the final calculation
factor = 2
pi_value = math.pi

# Calculate the area
area = factor * pi_value * val_given

print(f"The equation with numerical values is: A = {factor} * {pi_value} * {float(val_given)}")
