         "The first postulate (the Principle of Relativity) states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. This principle, by itself, is also the foundation of Galilean relativity (the physics of Newton). In Galilean relativity, velocities simply add up. If you are on a train moving at speed 'u' and you throw a ball forward at speed 'v', an observer on the ground sees the ball moving at 'u + v'. There is no universal maximum speed."),

        ("The Conflict with Electromagnetism",
         "A key 'law of physics' is Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism. These equations predict that light travels at a constant speed, 'c'. If we use the Galilean rules for adding velocities, the speed of light would have to be different for different observers. This would mean that Maxwell's equations (the laws of physics) would have a different form in different frames, which violates the first postulate."),

        ("Einstein's Resolution",
         "Einstein was faced with a choice: either the Principle of Relativity was wrong, or the Galilean velocity-addition rule was wrong. He chose to trust the Principle of Relativity."),

        ("The Role of the Second Postulate",
         "To create new transformation rules that keep Maxwell's equations the same for all observers, a new assumption is needed. The first postulate allows for a universe where the invariant speed is infinite (Galilean) or a universe where it's a finite value. The second postulate *specifies* that this finite invariant speed exists and its value is 'c', the speed of light. It's the critical piece of information that singles out Einstein's theory from other possibilities."),

        ("Conclusion",
         "Therefore, the second postulate isn't derived from the first. Instead, it's an additional, independent statement required to resolve the conflict between the Principle of Relativity and electromagnetism, leading to the unique structure of special relativity.")
