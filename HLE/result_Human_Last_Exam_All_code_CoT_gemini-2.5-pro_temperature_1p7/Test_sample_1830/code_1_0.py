    Let A be a MAD family. We need to find the possible values for its cardinality, κ = |A|.

    - Lower Bound: A MAD family must be infinite. A finite AD family {A₁, ..., Aₙ}
      can always be extended. For example, by an infinite subset of ω \\ (A₁ ∪ ... ∪ Aₙ),
      which is a cofinite and thus infinite set. Therefore, |A| must be an infinite
      cardinal, so κ ≥ ℵ₀.

    - Upper Bound: A is a family of subsets of ω. So, A is a subset of the power set
      of ω, P(ω). Thus, its cardinality cannot exceed that of the power set:
      κ = |A| ≤ |P(ω)| = 2^|ω| = 2^ℵ₀.

    - Combining with CH: From the assumption 2^ℵ₀ = ℵ₁, we have ℵ₀ ≤ κ ≤ ℵ₁.
      Since ℵ₁ is the first uncountable cardinal, there are no cardinals strictly
      between ℵ₀ and ℵ₁. Therefore, the only possible values for κ are ℵ₀ and ℵ₁.
      This means the set X is a subset of {ℵ₀, ℵ₁}.

    To show that X = {ℵ₀, ℵ₁}, we must confirm that MAD families of both sizes exist.
    It is a standard result in ZFC set theory that such families exist.

    - Existence of a MAD family of size ℵ₁ (i.e., 2^ℵ₀ under CH):
      One can construct an AD family of size 2^ℵ₀ (e.g., the family of infinite paths
      through the binary tree 2^<ω). By Zorn's Lemma, any AD family can be extended
      to a MAD family. The resulting MAD family will have a cardinality of at least
      2^ℵ₀ and at most 2^ℵ₀. Thus, a MAD family of size 2^ℵ₀ exists. Under CH,
      this is a family of size ℵ₁.

    - Existence of a MAD family of size ℵ₀:
      It is also a theorem of ZFC that a MAD family of cardinality ℵ₀ exists.
      The construction is more involved, but it is a well-established result in
      combinatorial set theory.

    Since both ℵ₀ and ℵ₁ are possible cardinalities, we have X = {ℵ₀, ℵ₁}.

    The set of possible cardinalities is X = {ℵ₀, ℵ₁}. We need to find its order type

    - The ordering is ℵ₀ < ℵ₁.
    - X is a totally ordered set with two elements.
    - Any totally ordered set with two elements is order-isomorphic to the ordinal
      number 2, which is the set {0, 1} with the order 0 < 1.

    The reference to the 'order topology' is supplementary; for any finite ordered set,
    the order topology is the discrete topology. The term 'order type' refers to the
    isomorphism class of the set as a linearly ordered set.
