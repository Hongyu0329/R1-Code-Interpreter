    This function prints a step-by-step explanation to answer the user's question.
    The question is:
    Consider a simple random walk in Z^d, d>=3. Let's call a set A transient if it is a.s. visited
    finitely many times. Assume A has the property: P_x(tau_A < infinity) = 1 for infinitely many x.
    In this situation, can A be transient?

    The function will print out a logical argument showing why the answer is 'No'.

    # --- Introduction ---
    print("The answer is No, the set A cannot be transient.\n")
    print("Here is a step-by-step argument to prove this statement.")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------\n")

    # --- Definitions and Setup ---
    print("Step 1: Define terms and state the core principles.")
    print("Let S_n be a simple random walk in Z^d (d >= 3).")
    print("A set A is transient if, starting from the origin, the walk visits A only a finite number of times almost surely (a.s.).")
    print("A set A is recurrent if it is not transient.")
    print("A key theorem states that A is recurrent if and only if for every point 'a' in A, the probability of returning to A is 1.")
    print("    - A is recurrent <=> P_a(tau_A^+ < infinity) = 1 for all a in A (where tau_A^+ is the first return time).")
    print("    - A is transient <=> There exists at least one 'a' in A such that P_a(tau_A^+ < infinity) < 1.\n")
    
    print("The given condition is that the hitting probability P_x(tau_A < infinity) = 1 for an infinite set of points X.\n")

    # --- Proof by Contradiction ---
    print("Step 2: Assume for contradiction that A is a transient set.")
    print("We analyze two possible cases for the infinite set X where the hitting probability is 1.\n")

    # --- Case 1 ---
    print("Case 1: The infinite set X contains at least one point 'x_0' that is NOT in A.")
    print("Let h_A(x) = P_x(tau_A < infinity). This function is harmonic on the set Z^d \\ A.")
    print("The Maximum Principle for harmonic functions states that a non-constant harmonic function on a connected domain attains its maximum only on the boundary.")
    print("Our function h_A(x) is bounded by 1. The condition h_A(x_0) = 1 means it attains its maximum value at x_0, which is an interior point of Z^d \\ A (assuming Z^d \\ A is connected).")
    print("This forces h_A(y) = 1 for all neighbors 'y' of 'x_0', and by extension, for all points 'y' in the same connected component of Z^d \\ A.")
    print("For d >= 3, a transient set A cannot disconnect Z^d, so the complement Z^d \\ A has only one unbounded connected component.")
    print("Therefore, h_A(y) = 1 for ALL y not in A.\n")

    print("Now, let's see if A can be transient under this condition.")
    print("For any point 'a' in A, the probability of returning is given by averaging over its neighbors:")
    print("  P_a(tau_A^+ < infinity) = (1/2d) * sum_{y:|y-a|=1} P_y(the walk hits A)")
    print("If a neighbor 'y' is in A, P_y(the walk hits A) = 1.")
    print("If a neighbor 'y' is not in A, P_y(the walk hits A) = h_A(y), which we just showed is 1.")
    print("So, every term in the sum is 1. The equation becomes:")
    print("  P_a(tau_A^+ < infinity) = (1/2d) * sum(1) = 1")
    print("Since this holds for ANY 'a' in A, the set A must be recurrent. This contradicts our assumption that A is transient.\n")
    
    # --- Case 2 ---
    print("Case 2: The infinite set X is entirely contained within A (X is a subset of A).")
    print("The condition P_x(tau_A < infinity) = 1 for x in A is equivalent to P_x(tau_A^+ < infinity) = 1.")
    print("So, we have an infinite subset of A, let's call it A_R = X, where the return probability is 1 for every point in it.\n")

    print("Let's consider the expected number of visits to A, starting from the origin, E_0[N_A]. A is transient if and only if E_0[N_A] is finite.\n")

    print("The set A_R is an infinite subset of Z^d. For a transient random walk (d>=3), the probability of ever hitting ANY infinite set is greater than 0.")
    print("Therefore, P_0(tau_{A_R} < infinity) > 0. There is a non-zero chance the walk hits the 'recurrent part' of A.\n")

    print("Let's calculate the expected number of visits:")
    print("  E_0[N_A] >= P_0(tau_{A_R} < infinity) * E_0[N_A | walk hits A_R]")
    print("If the walk hits A_R at a point 'a', it is guaranteed to return to A with probability 1 (since 'a' is in A_R). From the point it returns to, it will again return, and so on, infinitely.")
    print("This means the expected number of visits, conditioned on hitting A_R, is infinite. So, E_0[N_A | walk hits A_R] = infinity.\n")

    print("Since P_0(tau_{A_R} < infinity) > 0 and the conditional expectation is infinite, the total expected number of visits must be infinite:")
    print("  E_0[N_A] = infinity")
    print("But this means A is a recurrent set, which again contradicts our initial assumption that A is transient.\n")

    # --- Conclusion ---
    print("Step 3: Conclusion.")
    print("Both cases lead to a contradiction. The assumption that A is transient must be false.")
    print("Therefore, any set A satisfying the given property must be recurrent.")
