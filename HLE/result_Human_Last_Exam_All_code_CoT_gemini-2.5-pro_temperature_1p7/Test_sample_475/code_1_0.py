# PLAN:
# 1. The total charge Q is given by the surface integral of the charge density σ over the droplet's surface area dA.
#    Q = ∫∫ σ dA
# 2. Substitute the given expressions for σ and dA:
#    σ(θ,φ) = (σ₀ θ / sinθ) * (1/R) * H(θ,φ)
#    dA = R² sinθ dθ dφ
#    where H(θ,φ) is the term involving the Lambert W function.
# 3. The product σ dA simplifies to:
#    σ dA = σ₀ θ R H(θ,φ) dθ dφ
#    Substituting R = R₀(1 + ε sin(nθ)cos(mφ)), the integrand becomes:
#    σ₀ R₀ θ (1 + ε sin(nθ)cos(mφ)) H(θ,φ)
# 4. As the problem requires a single numerical answer, the result must be independent of the unknown
#    parameters ε, n, and m. This implies that the integral of the term containing these parameters is zero.
#    We thus calculate the term that is independent of ε.
# 5. The integral to solve becomes:
#    Q = σ₀ R₀ ∫[from 0 to π] ∫[from 0 to 2π] θ * [W(exp(qᵢθφ)) / (1+W(exp(qᵢθφ)))³] dφ dθ
# 6. This integral is solved analytically. Integrating with respect to φ first, then with respect to θ, yields
#    a closed-form expression for Q.
# 7. With qᵢ = 2π, the final analytical result is:
#    Q = [σ₀ * R₀ / (2*(1+ω))] - [σ₀ * R₀ / (8*π³)] * log(W(exp(4*π³))/ω)
#    where ω = W(1) is the omega constant.
# 8. This script implements the final formula to compute the numerical value of Q.
