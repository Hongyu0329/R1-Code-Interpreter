    "According to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards, a single-dose container like an ampule is designed for one-time use. Once an ampule is opened by snapping its neck, it becomes an open system and cannot be resealed, posing a risk of microbial and particulate contamination.\n\nTherefore, the contents must be used immediately for a single patient or a single compounding procedure. Any unused portion must be discarded. There is no allowable storage time or Beyond-Use Date (BUD) after the ampule has been opened.\n\nThe following Python code will print this information.\n\n```python\ndef get_ampule_bud_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) information for a single-dose ampule.\n    \"\"\"\n    rule = \"Immediate use\"\n    explanation = \"According to USP <797> guidelines, once a single-dose ampule is opened, it is exposed to the environment and cannot be resealed.\"\n    disposal_instruction = \"The contents must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded.\"\n    conclusion = \"There is no permissible storage time, so the Beyond-Use Date is effectively immediate.\"\n\n    print(f\"BUD Information for an opened Single-Dose Ampule:\\n\")\n    print(f\"Guideline: {rule}\")\n    print(f\"Reason: {explanation}\")\n    print(f\"Action: {disposal_instruction}\")\n    print(f\"Conclusion: {conclusion}\")\n\nget_ampule_bud_information()\n```\n<<<Immediate use>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
