def solve_cost_puzzle():
    """
    Calculates the minimum cost for computing 2A - 3B on a twisted Edwards curve.

    The cost is measured in the number of field multiplications.
    Inputs: A, B in affine coordinates.
    Output: 2A - 3B in extended coordinates.

    Strategy:
    The computation is rewritten as 2(A - B) - B.
    Let B' = -B. Negation is free in affine coordinates. The operation becomes 2(A + B') + B'.

    We calculate the cost step-by-step.
