# The problem is a theoretical question from the algebraic theory of quadratic forms.
# The question is to find the smallest natural number N such that for every anisotropic quadratic form
# Q(X_1, ..., X_N) over a specific field K, the map Q is surjective (represents all elements of K).

# Let's outline the reasoning.
# 1. The field K is a 2-dimensional local field of characteristic 2,
#    for instance K = F_2((t))((u)).
# 2. The u-invariant of a field, u(F), is the maximum dimension of an anisotropic
#    quadratic form over F.
# 3. For the given field K, a known result states that its u-invariant is 8.
#    This means there exist anisotropic quadratic forms of dimension 8, but none of higher dimension.
#
# 4. Let's test N = 8.
#    Let Q be an anisotropic quadratic form in 8 variables. For any element c in K,
#    we can form a new quadratic form Q_c = Q - c*Z^2 in 9 variables.
#    Since the dimension of Q_c is 9, which is greater than u(K) = 8, Q_c must be isotropic.
#    This means there is a non-trivial solution to Q(x_1,...,x_8) - c*z^2 = 0.
#    If z was 0 for all solutions, it would imply Q is isotropic, a contradiction.
#    So, there is a solution with z != 0.
#    This implies Q(x_1/z, ..., x_8/z) = c, meaning Q can represent any element c.
#    So, any anisotropic 8-dimensional form is surjective. Thus N=8 works.
#
# 5. Let's test N = 7.
#    We need to check if *every* anisotropic 7-dimensional form is surjective.
#    If we can find even one that is not, then N=7 does not work, and 8 must be the smallest.
#    A 7-dimensional form Q_7 is not surjective if there is an element c such that Q_7 - c*Z^2 is anisotropic.
#    This new form has dimension 8.
#    The existence of a non-surjective anisotropic 7-dimensional form is equivalent to the existence of
#    an anisotropic 8-dimensional form of a specific structure (a direct sum of a 7-dim form and a 1-dim form).
#    Deeper results in the theory of quadratic forms show that such forms, called singular anisotropic forms of
#    dimension 8, do exist over K.
#    Let Q_8 be such a singular anisotropic form. It can be written as Q_8 = Q_7 + d*Z^2.
#    The subform Q_7 is anisotropic.
#    By an argument similar to the one in step 4, one can show that Q_7 cannot represent the element d.
#    Hence, Q_7 is not surjective.
#    Therefore, the property fails for N=7.
#
# Conclusion: The property holds for N=8, but not for N=7.
# The smallest such natural number is 8.
