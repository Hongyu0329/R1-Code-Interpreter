    "Of course. Designing a secure threshold signature scheme from scratch is a highly complex task best left to professional cryptographers. However, I can explain and demonstrate the core concepts of a state-of-the-art scheme that meets your requirements.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Choose the Right Scheme:** We will model our design on **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)**. This scheme is an excellent choice because, as its name suggests, it is specifically designed to be efficient and use a minimal number of rounds. The signing protocol consists of exactly two rounds.\n2.  **Explain the Core Concepts:** Before the code, I'll briefly touch on the building blocks:\n    *   **Schnorr Signatures:** The underlying digital signature algorithm, known for its simplicity and provable security.\n    *   **Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS):** The method used to split the single private key into `n` shares, where any `t` shares can reconstruct it.\n    *   **Commitment Scheme:** A crucial step to prevent malicious signers from choosing their contribution after seeing others' contributions.\n3.  **Simulate the Two-Round Protocol:**\n    *   **Setup:** A dealer will simulate a secure Distributed Key Generation (DKG) to create and distribute key shares to `n` parties.\n    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** A subset of `t` participants who want to sign will each generate a secret nonce (a random number) and broadcast a *commitment* to that nonce. This \"locks in\" their contribution.\n    *   **Round 2 (Signing):** After receiving all commitments, each participant reveals their nonce. They then compute a partial signature using their key share, their nonce, and the message. These partial signatures are sent to a signature aggregator.\n    *   **Aggregation:** The aggregator combines the `t` partial signatures into a single, valid Schnorr signature.\n4.  **Provide Python Code:** I will write a Python script that simulates this entire process. For simplicity, it will use basic modular arithmetic instead of real elliptic curve cryptography, but it will accurately model the logical flow of FROST. The code will print out the intermediate values and the final signature verification equation to show how it works.\n\nHere is the Python code that simulates the FROST two-round signing protocol.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport hashlib\n\n# --- Cryptographic Primitives (Simplified) ---\n\n# This is a large prime number for our finite field operations.\n# In a real implementation, this would be the order of an elliptic curve group.\nQ = 2**256 - 2**32 - 977 \n\n# A generator for our group.
