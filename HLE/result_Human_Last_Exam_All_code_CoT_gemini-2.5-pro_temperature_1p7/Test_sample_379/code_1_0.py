    """
    Solves the described geometry problem about the locus of points on a cube's surface.
    
    The detailed geometric analysis reveals the following:
    The locus C is composed of 6 identical circular arcs.
    Let r be the side length of the cube.
    - Two arcs are on the two faces adjacent to the point P.
    - Four arcs are on the four faces that are 'one edge away' from P (the 'top', 'bottom', and their counterparts).
    - By unfolding the cube, each of these arcs is found to be part of a circle of radius r.
    - The angle subtended by each arc is pi/3 radians (or 60 degrees).
