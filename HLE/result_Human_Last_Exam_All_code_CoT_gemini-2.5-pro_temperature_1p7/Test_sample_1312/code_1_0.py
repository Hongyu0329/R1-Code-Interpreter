    print("1. Populations with limited recombination cannot easily purge deleterious mutations, a process called 'Muller's Ratchet', which leads to genetic deterioration.")
    print("2. A compensatory mechanism would need to provide a buffer against the harmful effects of these accumulating mutations.")
    print("3. Let's analyze the options:")
    print(f"   - '{options['B']}': This feature suppresses recombination, which would worsen the problem.")
    print(f"   - '{options['A']}' and '{options['C']}': These can introduce genetic variation but are not primary mechanisms for protecting the entire genome's function from mutation.")
    print(f"   - '{options['D']}' and '{options['E']}' both provide redundancy. A duplicated gene can tolerate a mutation if another functional copy exists.")
    print("4. Conclusion: Polyploidy is a whole-genome duplication event. It provides massive, genome-wide redundancy, offering a powerful buffer against the accumulation of deleterious mutations. It is a classic example of an architectural feature that allows lineages with limited recombination (like many asexual plants) to thrive.")
