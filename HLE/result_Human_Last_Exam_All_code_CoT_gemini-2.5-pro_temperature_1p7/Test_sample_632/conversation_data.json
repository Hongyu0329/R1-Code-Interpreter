    "This is a historical question that cannot be solved with a script. My plan is to research the history of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" and look for architectural or infrastructure changes that took place around the year 1950. I will then present the answer based on historical facts.\n\nThe unique feature that was removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950 was the network of **tram lines**. Tram tracks ran through the square, circling the central fountain and connecting the area to Rome's public transport system. Their removal was part of a larger plan in post-war Rome to modernize the city's transport by prioritizing buses and private cars, which dramatically changed the sound and appearance of the historic piazza.\n\n<<<The tram lines>>>"
