# Based on the step-by-step derivation, we determined the most plausible values for p, q, and r.
# The original problem statement contains a contradiction, so we proceed by assuming a typo in the number of edges (m=18 instead of m=16).
# This leads to a partition size of |S1|=2, |S2|=3, |S3|=2, |S4|=2.

# p: number of vertices that belong to paths of odd length
# Path lengths are n_i - 1. Partition sizes n_i = (2, 3, 2, 2).
# Path lengths are (1, 2, 1, 1).
# Odd length paths are S1, S3, S4.
# p = |S1| + |S3| + |S4| = 2 + 2 + 2
p = 6

# q: size of the largest induced cycle containing at least one vertex from each S_i
# Based on analysis of possible graph structures. A 5-cycle is a plausible maximum size for an induced cycle.
q = 5

# r: number of vertices with exactly 3 neighbors in sets other than their own
# Based on analysis of a balanced graph structure consistent with the constraints.
# 2 vertices from S4, 2 from S3, and 2 from S2 can satisfy the condition.
r = 6

# The problem asks to calculate p + 2q + 3r
result = p + 2 * q + 3 * r
