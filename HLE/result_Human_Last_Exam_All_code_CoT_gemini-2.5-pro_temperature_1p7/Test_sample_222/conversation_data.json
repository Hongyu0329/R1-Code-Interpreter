    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  The problem asks for the 8-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence `y(n)` which is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We are given the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n2.  Instead of finding `x(n)` and `h(n)` via Inverse DFT, we can use a more direct and efficient property of the DFT. The structure of `y(n)` allows us to use the decimation-in-time approach (which is the basis of the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm).\n3.  This approach relates the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to the given 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` with the following formulas:\n    *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    where `W_8 = exp(-j*2*pi/8)` is the DFT twiddle factor.\n4.  I will write a Python script that implements these formulas. The script will use the `numpy` library for easy handling of complex numbers.\n5.  As requested, the code will print out each step of the calculation, showing the numbers used in the equations to derive each element of the final `Y(k)` vector.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 8-point DFT for an interleaved sequence using the\n    given 4-point DFTs of the original sequences.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\n    H = np.array([0, 1+1j, 1, 1-1j])\n\n    N = 8  # Length of the final DFT\n    M = 4  # Length of the original DFTs\n\n    # Initialize the 8-point DFT Y(k)\n    Y = np.zeros(N, dtype=complex)\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the 8-point DFT Y(k) for the interleaved sequence.\")\n    print(\"y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}\")\n    print(\"\\nWe use the following formulas based on the decimation-in-time FFT property:\")\n    print(\"  Y(k)     = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)\")\n    print(\"  Y(k+4)   = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)\")\n    print(\"for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, where W_8 = exp(-2j*pi/8).\\n\")\n\n    def format_complex(c):\n        \"\"\"Helper function to format complex numbers for clean printing.\"\"\"\n        real, imag = c.real, c.imag\n        if np.isclose(real, 0) and np.isclose(imag, 0): return \"0\"\n        if np.isclose(real, 0): return f\"{imag:.4f}j\"\n        if np.isclose(imag, 0): return f\"{real:.4f}\"\n        return f\"({real:.4f} {'+' if imag >= 0 else '-'} {abs(imag):.4f}j)\"\n\n    for k in range(M):\n        # Calculate the twiddle factor W_N^k\n        W_N_k = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k / N)\n        \n        # Calculate the product term for the equations\n        term = W_N_k * H[k]\n        \n        # Calculate Y(k) and Y(k+4)\n        Y[k] = X[k] + term\n        Y[k+M] = X[k] - term\n\n        # Print the equations with the specific numbers for this step\n        print(f\"--- For k = {k} ---\")\n        print(f\"  Y({k}) = X({k}) + (W_8^{k} * H({k}))\")\n        print(f\"       = {format_complex(X[k])} + ({format_complex(W_N_k)} * {format_complex(H[k])})\")\n        print(f\"       = {format_complex(X[k])} + {format_complex(term)}\")\n        print(f\"       = {format_complex(Y[k])}\\n\")\n\n        print(f\"  Y({k+M}) = X({k}) - (W_8^{k} * H({k}))\")\n        print(f\"         = {format_complex(X[k])} - ({format_complex(W_N_k)} * {format_complex(H[k])})\")\n        print(f\"         = {format_complex(X[k])} - {format_complex(term)}\")\n        print(f\"         = {format_complex(Y[k+M])}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Final Result ---\")\n    print(\"The complete 8-point DFT vector Y(k) is:\")\n    result_str = f\"Y = [{', '.join([format_complex(c) for c in Y])}]\"\n    print(result_str)\n\nsolve_dft()\n<<<[1.0000, (1.4142 + 1.0000j), (-1.0000 - 1.0000j), (-1.4142 - 1.0000j), 1.0000, (-1.4142 + 1.0000j), (-1.0000 + 1.0000j), (1.4142 - 1.0000j)]>>>\n```"
