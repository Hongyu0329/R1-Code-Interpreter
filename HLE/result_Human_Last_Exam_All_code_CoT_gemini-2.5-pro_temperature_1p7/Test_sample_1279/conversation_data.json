    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify the relevant diagrams**: First, I will identify all the unique, connected, second-order vacuum bubble Feynman diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory. Second-order means the diagrams contain two vertices, and vacuum bubbles mean they have no external lines.\n2.  **Calculate symmetry factors**: For each diagram identified, I will calculate its symmetry factor. The symmetry factor, S, is the order of the automorphism group of the diagram, which means it's the number of ways its internal lines and vertices can be permuted without changing the diagram's topology.\n3.  **Sum the factors**: Finally, I will sum the symmetry factors of all the diagrams.\n4.  **Code implementation**: I will provide a Python script that performs these calculations and prints out the reasoning for each step, the individual symmetry factors, and the final sum as requested.\n\nThe two relevant diagrams are:\n1.  **The \"Figure-eight\" diagram**: This diagram consists of two vertices, each with a single loop (a propagator starting and ending on the same vertex), and two propagators connecting the two vertices.\n2.  **The \"Setting-sun\" diagram**: This diagram consists of two vertices connected directly by four parallel propagators.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the calculations implemented in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_phi4_vacuum_bubbles():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for the two second-order vacuum bubble\n    diagrams in phi^4 theory and prints the sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"In phi^4 theory, there are two distinct connected second-order vacuum bubble diagrams.\")\n    print(\"Let's calculate the symmetry factor (S) for each.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: Figure-eight Diagram ---\n    print(\"1.
