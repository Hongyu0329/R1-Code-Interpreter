    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  **Analyze the Poet and the Quote:** The poet is Andrei Voznesensky, a prominent Soviet/Russian poet. The quote \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and the question \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" point towards his famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\").\n2.  **Identify the Subject:** The rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" is about the life and tragic love story of Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer. This makes him the primary candidate.\n3.  **Verify the Clues:**\n    *   Rezanov led expeditions for the Russian-American Company, which fits the description of a \"sailor\" or explorer.\n    *   He died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807 while returning from his travels. His grave at a local cathedral was destroyed by the Soviets in the 1930s, making its location a mystery for a long time, which fits the poem's question.\n    *   The \"late 1980s\" clue corresponds to the era of *glasnost* in the Soviet Union. During this time, historical figures and stories suppressed or ignored by the state were re-examined. The massive popularity of the rock opera (premiered in 1981) brought Rezanov's story to the forefront, and the question of his final resting place became a topic of public interest, leading to new efforts to properly memorialize him. The \"answer\" that emerged was a renewed national recognition and a plan for a new monument.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that states the last name. To satisfy the unusual constraint of providing an equation, I will calculate his age at death using his birth (1764) and death (1807) years and print the full equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    # The man in question is Nikolai Rezanov, the subject of Andrei Voznesensky's rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n    # All the clues from the prompt point to him.\n\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n    year_of_death = 1807\n    year_of_birth = 1764\n\n    print(f\"The poet Andrei Voznesensky wrote about this man in the famous rock opera 'Juno and Avos'.\")\n    print(f\"The man's grave was lost, and his story was revived in the public consciousness during the late 1980s.\")\n    print(f\"The man's last name is: {last_name}\")\n\n    # To fulfill the request for an equation, we can calculate his age at death.\n    age_at_death = year_of_death - year_of_birth\n    \n    print(\"\\nHere is an equation related to his life, showing his age at death:\")\n    print(f\"{year_of_death} - {year_of_birth} = {age_at_death}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
