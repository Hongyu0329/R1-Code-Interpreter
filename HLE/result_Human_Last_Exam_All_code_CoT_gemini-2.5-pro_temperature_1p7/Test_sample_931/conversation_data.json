    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) eat, I will follow these steps:\n1.  Research the general diet of adult Raphidioptera using established entomological knowledge.\n2.  Evaluate each answer choice based on the research. Adult snakeflies are known predators of small, soft-bodied insects. They are also known to supplement this diet.\n3.  I will look for evidence of them consuming nectar, pollen, fungus, leaf tissue, and aphids.\n4.  I will write a Python script that programmatically lays out this information, analyzes the choices, and prints the conclusion. The script will identify the most comprehensive and correct answer from the list.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_raphidoptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define known dietary facts for adult Raphidiopterans.\n    primary_diet = \"Predators of small, soft-bodied arthropods (e.g., aphids, psyllids, small caterpillars, insect eggs).\"\n    supplementary_diet = \"Pollen and nectar.\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the provided choices for the diet of adult Raphidiopterans:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate each choice.\n    choices = {\n        'A': \"Nectar\",\n        'B': \"Māhoe pollen\",\n        'C': \"Fungus\",\n        'D': \"Karamū leaf tissue\",\n        'E': \"Totara Aphids\",\n        'F': \"A and E\",\n        'G': \"D and E\"\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Choice A: {choices['A']}\")\n    print(f\"Analysis: Correct. Adult snakeflies are known to supplement their diet with nectar. It provides a source of energy.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(f\"Choice E: {choices['E']}\")\n    print(f\"Analysis: Correct. Adult snakeflies are primarily predators, and aphids are a common food source. The type of plant the aphid is on (Totara) is irrelevant to the snakefly.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(f\"Choice B, C, D:\")\n    print(f\"Analysis: Incorrect. Snakeflies are not found in New Zealand (where Māhoe, Karamū, and Totara are native). More importantly, they do not feed on fungus or leaf tissue.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the best fit.\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"Since both A (Nectar) and E (Aphids) have been recorded as food sources for adult Raphidiopterans, the most complete and accurate answer is the one that includes both.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final choice is F, which combines A and E.\")\n\nanalyze_raphidoptera_diet()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
