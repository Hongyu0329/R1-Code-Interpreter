    This script verifies a 4-piece solution to the posed chess problem.
    The problem asks for the minimum number of white pieces to attack all squares but one,

    Our solution uses 4 pieces: 3 Queens and 1 Rook.
    - White Pieces: Queens on b3, c6, f1; Rook on h7.
    - Black Piece: King on e8.
