    "The problem asks for `a(3)`, where `a(n)` is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics. This quantity is calculated by the formula `a(n) = (2n-1)!!`, where `!!` denotes the double factorial.\n\nThe double factorial of an odd number `k`, denoted `k!!`, is the product of all odd integers from `k` down to 1.\n\nHere is the plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Set the value of `n` to 3.\n2.  Calculate the argument for the double factorial, which is `k = 2*n - 1`.\n3.  Implement the double factorial calculation for `k`. This involves multiplying all odd integers from `k` down to 1.\n4.  While calculating the product, we will also construct the equation string to display the full calculation as requested.\n5.  Print the final equation showing the calculation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_a(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n) = (2n-1)!!, the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams\n    of order 2n.\n\n    This function calculates the double factorial of (2n-1) and also\n    prints the equation representing the calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The value to take the double factorial of\n    k = 2 * n - 1\n\n    # Initialize the result and the list to build the equation string\n    result = 1\n    equation_parts = []\n\n    # Loop from k down to 1, with a step of -2 to get all odd numbers\n    for i in range(k, 0, -2):\n        result *= i\n        equation_parts.append(str(i))\n\n    # Join the numbers with \" * \" to form the multiplication string\n    calculation_str = \" * \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    # Print the final equation with the result\n    print(f\"a({n}) = (2*{n}-1)!! = {k}!! = {calculation_str} = {result}\")\n    return result\n\n# The problem asks for a(3)\nn_value = 3\nfinal_answer = calculate_a(n_value)\n```\n<<<15>>>"
