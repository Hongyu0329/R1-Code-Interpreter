    print("   - However, is transitivity sufficient? No. A network can be transitive, but the statistical results might show that direct evidence (from A-C trials) conflicts with the indirect evidence (from A-B and B-C trials). This is 'inconsistency', a separate major problem.\n")

    print("   - Consistency is a critical assumption that is checked statistically. It means the direct and indirect evidence tell the same story.")
    print("   - Is it sufficient? No. A network might be 'consistent' by chance, even if it's not truly 'transitive'. For example, if biases in the A-B and B-C trials happen to create an indirect estimate that coincidentally matches the direct A-C evidence. The underlying logic of the comparison is still flawed.\n")
