# The reasoning behind the solution is based on graph theory concepts applied to the planar set S.
# We are looking for the number of cut vertices whose removal splits the graph S into 3 or more connected components.

# From the analysis, we identified two such points (cut vertices):
# 1. p_1 = (-1, 0): Removing this point results in 3 components.
# 2. p_2 = (0, 1): Removing this point results in 5 components.

# Count the number of points found.
num_point_1 = 1 # for the point (-1, 0)
num_point_2 = 1 # for the point (0, 1)

# Calculate the total number of points.
total_points = num_point_1 + num_point_2

# The final answer is the total number of points.
# The prompt requests to output each number in the final equation.
# The equation for the total count is 1 + 1 = 2.
print(f"Number of components when removing p1=(-1,0): 3")
print(f"Number of components when removing p2=(0,1): 5")
print(f"Total number of points is the sum of the counts for each identified point.")
print(f"Final calculation: {num_point_1} + {num_point_2} = {total_points}")
print(f"The numbers in the final equation are: {num_point_1}, {num_point_2}, {total_points}")

# The question is "How many points are there", so the answer is the total count.
