    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will identify the physicist based on the clues provided: work in microscopy and the specific anecdote about an observation by a custodial worker with concave mirrors. The story is famously associated with Ernst Abbe and his work at the Zeiss company.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to print the name of the physicist.\n\n```python\ndef find_physicist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the physicist based on historical facts.\n    - Known for work in microscopy.\n    - Associated with an anecdote where a cleaner's observation on dusty concave mirrors\n      led to insights into optical effects (image formation/diffraction).\n    This description points to Ernst Abbe.\n    \"\"\"\n    physicist_name = \"Ernst Abbe\"\n    print(physicist_name)\n\nfind_physicist()\n```\n<<<Ernst Abbe>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
