    "My plan is to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent proton environments in the molecule, which corresponds to the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall symmetry of the molecule.** The core of the molecule is a benzene ring substituted at positions 1, 3, and 5 with three identical large groups, and at positions 2, 4, and 6 with three methyl groups. This substitution pattern gives the molecule a C3 axis of rotational symmetry. Due to this symmetry, we only need to count the unique proton signals from one of the large substituents and one of the methyl groups on the central ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the protons on the central benzene core.** The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single signal. There are no protons directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the protons in one of the identical substituent arms.** The name of the arm is `[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]`. The stereochemistry `(4S,7R)` indicates that this substituent is chiral. In a chiral molecule, protons or groups that are diastereotopic will be chemically non-equivalent and give rise to separate NMR signals.\n\n    *   **Benzylic -CH2- group:** This methylene group is attached to the chiral indazole system. Therefore, its two protons are diastereotopic and will produce two distinct signals.\n    *   **Protons on the bicyclic indazole system:**\n        *   The system is rigid and chiral, so there is no local symmetry to make protons equivalent unless they are part of a freely rotating methyl group.\n        *   **C3-H:** There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole, which is in a unique environment. (1 signal)\n        *   **C4-H:** This is a bridgehead proton and is unique. (1 signal)\n        *   **C5-H2 and C6-H2:** Each of these is a methylene group in the rigid bicyclic frame. The two protons of each group are diastereotopic (endo and exo). This results in 2 signals for C5-H2 and 2 signals for C6-H2. (4 signals total)\n    *   **Methyl groups on the arm:**\n        *   **C7-CH3:** This methyl group is in a unique position. (1 signal)\n        *   **C8,8-(CH3)2:** This is a gem-dimethyl group on the bridge of the chiral bicyclic system. The two methyl groups are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. (2 signals)\n\n4.  **Sum the signals.** Finally, I will sum the number of signals from the central core and from one substituent arm to get the total number of expected peaks. I will present this calculation in a Python script that explains each step.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the expected number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of\n    1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n    by analyzing its structure for chemically non-equivalent protons.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Determining the number of 1H NMR signals based on molecular structure:\")\n\n    # Using an ordered dictionary to maintain the order of analysis\n    signal_sources = collections.OrderedDict()\n\n    # 1.
