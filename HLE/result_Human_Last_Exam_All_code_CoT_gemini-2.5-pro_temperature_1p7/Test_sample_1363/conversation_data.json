    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to determine the answer.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the core techniques of each dance listed in the options, specifically focusing on how rotation is generated. The key concepts to consider are Contra Body Movement (CBM), sway, and rise and fall.\n\n1.  **Analyze Swing Dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep):** These dances are categorized as \"swing\" dances. Their rotational figures, like the Reverse Turn, are heavily dependent on CBM (turning the body against the moving leg), body sway, and, in most cases, rise and fall. These techniques allow for fluid, continuous rotation, which can be increased (\"overturned\") for choreographic or navigational purposes without necessarily \"breaking\" the dance's core character.\n\n2.  **Analyze Tango:** The European Tango stands apart. Its technique is fundamentally different. It is a \"walking\" dance with no body sway and no rise and fall. Turns are executed with a sharp, staccato action and a different body mechanic that does not use CBM in the same way as the swing dances.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the \"Impossible to Overturn\" Constraint:** To \"overturn\" a Reverse Turn means to add more rotation. In swing dances, this is achieved by exaggerating the CBM and sway. If one were to attempt this in a Tango Reverse Turn, they would have to introduce CBM and sway. Introducing these elements fundamentally violates the defining characteristics of the Tango. The figure would cease to be a Tango figure and would look like a poor attempt at a Waltz or Foxtrot turn.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Reverse Turn in the European Tango without completely disregarding its core technique.\n\nI will now generate a Python script that formalizes this analysis and presents the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_the_dance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes a technical ballroom dance question to determine the correct answer.\n    It prints the question, the options, and a detailed explanation for the correct choice.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"In which dance is it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique?\"\n\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrott',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    correct_answer = 'C'\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThe correct answer is European Tango. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Swing vs. Staccato:** The Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep are 'swing' dances. They use Contra Body Movement (CBM), sway, and rise & fall to create continuous, flowing rotation. In these dances, a Reverse Turn can be overturned by skilled dancers by increasing the CBM and sway.\n\n2.  **Tango's Unique Technique:** The European Tango is fundamentally different. It is a 'staccato' dance with no sway and no rise & fall. Turns are sharp and executed without the swinging CBM characteristic of the other dances.\n\n3.  **The Impossibility of Overturning:** To add more rotation (overturn) to a Reverse Turn, one would need to introduce sway and a powerful CBM. Doing so in Tango would completely violate its core technical principles (no sway, staccato action). The figure would no longer be recognizable as a Tango turn.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to overturn a Reverse Turn in the Tango without disregarding the dance's fundamental technique.\n\"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Question ---\")\n    print(question)\n    print(\"\\n--- Options ---\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}. {value}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Analysis and Answer ---\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is: {correct_answer}\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_the_dance()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
