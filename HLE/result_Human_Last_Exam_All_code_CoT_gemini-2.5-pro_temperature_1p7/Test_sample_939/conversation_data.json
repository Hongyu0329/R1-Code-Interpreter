    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand Color Spaces and Gamuts**: The problem asks which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented in sRGB. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a wider \"gamut\" (range of colors) than sRGB, which is the standard for web browsers and most displays. This means some colors in ROMM RGB, especially highly saturated ones, fall outside the sRGB gamut.\n\n2.  **Define the Conversion Process**: To determine if a color is in the sRGB gamut, we must convert it from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. This involves three main steps:\n    *   **Linearization (Inverse Gamma Correction)**: The input RGB values are non-linear (gamma-corrected). They must first be converted to linear values. For ROMM RGB, this involves a specific formula (if `v >= 0.03125`, linear = `v^1.8`; otherwise, linear = `v/16`).\n    *   **Matrix Transformation**: Linear ROMM RGB values are converted to linear sRGB values using a standard 3x3 transformation matrix. This matrix accounts for the different color primaries and white points of the two color spaces.\n    *   **Gamut Check**: A color can be represented in sRGB if and only if its converted linear R, G, and B components are all between 0.0 and 1.0. If any component is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, it is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\n3.  **Execute for Each Color**: I will apply this conversion process to each of the five colors provided.\n    *   For the white point `RGB(1, 1, 1)`, conversion may result in values slightly greater than 1.0 due to rounding in standard matrix coefficients. These are considered representable as they should map to sRGB's white point `(1, 1, 1)`.\n    *   For other colors, if the resulting values are significantly outside the `[0, 1]` range (e.g., negative or much larger than 1), they are definitively out of gamut.\n\n4.  **Format the Output**: I will collect the numbers of the colors that are out-of-gamut and present them in ascending order, separated by commas.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef romm_to_srgb_check():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\n    This function converts a list of ROMM RGB colors to the sRGB color space\n    and checks if they fall within the sRGB gamut [0, 1].\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Standard transformation matrix from linear ROMM RGB (D50) to linear sRGB (D65)\n    # using the Bradford chromatic adaptation method.\n    M_ROMM_TO_SRGB = np.array([\n        [1.2536831, -0.0768913, -0.1537234],\n        [-0.2435749,  1.1784381,  0.0652576],\n        [-0.0093836, -0.2941544,  1.3094896]\n    ])\n\n    colors = {\n        1: (0, 0, 1),\n        2: (0, 1, 0),\n        3: (0, 0.5, 0.6),\n        4: (0.4, 0.5, 0.6),\n        5: (1, 1, 1)\n    }\n    \n    cannot_represent = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB values are outside the sRGB gamut...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    for number, rgb_nl in colors.items():\n        # Step 1: Convert non-linear ROMM RGB to linear values\n        # The transfer function for ROMM RGB (inverse gamma) is applied.\n        romm_lin = []\n        for val_nl in rgb_nl:\n            if val_nl >= 0.03125:\n                romm_lin.append(val_nl ** 1.8)\n            else:\n                romm_lin.append(val_nl / 16.0)\n        \n        romm_lin_vec = np.array(romm_lin)\n\n        # Step 2: Apply the transformation matrix\n        srgb_lin_vec = M_ROMM_TO_SRGB @ romm_lin_vec\n\n        # Step 3: Check if the resulting sRGB color is in gamut [0, 1]\n        # We use a small tolerance for the upper bound to account for\n        # floating point inaccuracies, especially for the white point (1,1,1).\n        # Any negative value is definitively out of gamut.\n        is_in_gamut = all(component >= -1e-5 and component <= 1.0 + 1e-2 for component in srgb_lin_vec)\n        \n        # Format for clear output\n        romm_str = f\"ROMM RGB({rgb_nl[0]}, {rgb_nl[1]}, {rgb_nl[2]})\"\n        srgb_str = f\"sRGB(R={srgb_lin_vec[0]:.3f}, G={srgb_lin_vec[1]:.3f}, B={srgb_lin_vec[2]:.3f})\"\n        \n        if is_in_gamut:\n            print(f\"{number}) {romm_str} -> {srgb_str} -> Can be represented.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{number}) {romm_str} -> {srgb_str} -> CANNOT be represented.\")\n            cannot_represent.append(number)\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    if not cannot_represent:\n        result = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        result = \", \".join(map(str, sorted(cannot_represent)))\n        \n    print(\"Numbers of the colors that cannot be represented:\")\n    print(result)\n    \n    # Final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    romm_to_srgb_check()\n```"
