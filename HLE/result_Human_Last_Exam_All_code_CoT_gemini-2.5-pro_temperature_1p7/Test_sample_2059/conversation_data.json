    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by finding a recurrence relation for the desired sum.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\nLet $P_n(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) = \\sum_k a_{n,k}x^k$.\nWe are looking for the value of $A_{20} = \\sum_k a_{20,k}^2$.\n\nThe sum of the squares of the coefficients can be found by taking the constant term of the Laurent polynomial $P_n(x)P_n(x^{-1})$.\nLet's analyze the term $P_n(x)P_n(x^{-1})$.\n$P_n(x)P_n(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\left( (1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i})(1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}) \\right)$.\nLet $Q_i(x) = (1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i})(1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i})$.\nBy pairing terms $x^k \\cdot x^{-k}$, the constant term of $Q_i(x)$ is $1+1+1+1=4$.\nExpanding $Q_i(x)$ gives a Laurent polynomial symmetric in its coefficients:\n$Q_i(x) = 4 + 3(x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i}) + 2(x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) + (x^{3\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i})$.\nLet $W(d)=4-|d|$, then $Q_i(x) = \\sum_{d=-3}^3 W(d)x^{d \\cdot 3^i}$.\n\nThe desired sum $A_n$ is the constant term of the product $\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} Q_i(x)$.\nThis constant term is the sum of products of coefficients whose exponents sum to zero. Specifically, $A_n = \\sum \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} W(d_i)$ over all integer sequences $(d_0, \\dots, d_{n-1})$ with $d_i \\in \\{-3, \\dots, 3\\}$ such that $\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i 3^i = 0$.\n\nWe can establish a recurrence relation for $A_n$. Based on calculations for small $n$:\n$A_0 = 1$ (for an empty product)\n$A_1 = 4$\n$A_2 = 22$\n$A_3 = 124$\n\nWe can observe that the sequence seems to follow the linear recurrence relation $A_n = 6A_{n-1} - 2A_{n-2}$ for $n \\ge 2$.\nLet's verify:\nFor $n=2$: $6A_1 - 2A_0 = 6(4) - 2(1) = 22 = A_2$.\nFor $n=3$: $6A_2 - 2A_1 = 6(22) - 2(4) = 132 - 8 = 124 = A_3$.\nThe recurrence holds.\n\nThe characteristic equation of the recurrence is $r^2 - 6r + 2 = 0$. The roots are $r = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\nThe general solution is $A_n = c_1(3+\\sqrt{7})^n + c_2(3-\\sqrt{7})^n$.\nUsing the initial conditions $A_0=1$ and $A_1=4$:\n$c_1 + c_2 = 1$\n$c_1(3+\\sqrt{7}) + c_2(3-\\sqrt{7}) = 4$\nSolving this system yields:\n$c_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right)$\n$c_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right)$\n\nHowever, since we need to compute $A_n$ where $n=20$, which is an integer, we can simply use the recurrence relation to compute the value iteratively. We need to find $A_{20}$.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Let P(x) = product_{i=0 to 19} (1 + x^(3^i) + x^(2*3^i) + x^(3*3^i)) = sum_k a_k * x^k.\n    We need to find sum_k a_k^2.\n\n    Let A_n be the sum of squares of coefficients for the product up to n-1.\n    A_n = sum_k a_{n,k}^2.\n\n    The sum of squares can be calculated as the constant term of P_n(x) * P_n(x^(-1)).\n    Let Q_i(x) = (1+x^(3^i)+x^(2*3^i)+x^(3*3^i)) * (1+x^(-3^i)+x^(-2*3^i)+x^(-3*3^i)).\n    The desired sum A_n is the constant term of the product of Q_i(x) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n    The constant term of Q_i(x) can be found by expanding it.\n    Q_i(x) = 4 + 3(x^(3^i) + x^(-3^i)) + 2(x^(2*3^i) + x^(-2*3^i)) + (x^(3*3^i) + x^(-3*3^i)).\n\n    By computing the first few terms of the sequence A_n, we find:\n    A_0 = 1 (empty product)\n    A_1 = 4\n    A_2 = 22\n    A_3 = 124\n\n    This sequence satisfies the linear recurrence relation:\n    A_n = 6 * A_{n-1} - 2 * A_{n-2} for n >= 2.\n\n    We need to compute A_20.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize the first two terms of the sequence\n    # A_0 represents the sum of squares for n=0 (product up to -1) which is P_0(x)=1. sum a_k^2 = 1^2=1\n    # A_1 represents the sum for n=1 (product up to 0).
