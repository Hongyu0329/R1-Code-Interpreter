    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the range of verses.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  First, I will access the text of the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi.\n2.  Next, I will locate the specific section dedicated to listing the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an. This is a fundamental part of the poem dealing with the articles of faith.\n3.  I will identify the precise *bayt* (verse number) where the list of prophets begins and the *bayt* where it ends.\n4.  Finally, I will create a Python script to state this range clearly. The script will define the start and end verse numbers and use the `print()` function to display the answer and the relevant verses for context.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses_in_aqeedat_al_awaam():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt) in the poem\n    'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The enumeration of the 25 prophets starts after the introductory verse (bayt 28).\n    # The list itself begins at bayt 29 and concludes at bayt 32.\n    \n    start_bayt = 29\n    end_bayt = 32\n    \n    print(f\"The names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe specific bayts are:\")\n    \n    # Bayt 29 lists Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Salih, and Ibrahim\n    print(f\"Bayt {29}: They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each to be followed.\")\n    \n    # Bayt 30 lists Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub\n    print(f\"Bayt {30}: Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq, as well as Jacob, Joseph, and Ayyub followed suit.\")\n\n    # Bayt 31 lists Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman\n    print(f\"Bayt {31}: Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa and al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.\")\n\n    # Bayt 32 lists Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and concludes with Prophet Muhammad (Taha)\n    print(f\"Bayt {32}: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (Prophet Muhammad), the seal; leave misguidance.\")\n\nfind_prophet_verses_in_aqeedat_al_awaam()\n```\n<<<From bayt 29 to bayt 32>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
