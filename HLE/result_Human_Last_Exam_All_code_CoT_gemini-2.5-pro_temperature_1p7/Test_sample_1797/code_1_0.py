# The plan is to evaluate each statement about attack graph analysis.
# A: Correct. Describes the basic graph structure and application of graph theory.
# B: Correct. Describes the state explosion problem, a key challenge.
# C: Incorrect. The problem's complexity is generally characterized by the state explosion (EXPTIME), not NP-hardness.
#    While some related problems can be NP-hard, the generation of exploit-dependency graphs itself is often in P.
# D: Correct. Real systems are dynamic, requiring incremental updates to attack graphs.
# E: Correct. Model checking is a valid formal verification technique used on attack graphs.
# The only incorrect statement is C.
# The script will print the letter corresponding to the incorrect statement.
