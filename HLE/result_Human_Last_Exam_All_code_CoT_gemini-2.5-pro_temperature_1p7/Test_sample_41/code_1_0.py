    This script analyzes meteorological data to find the single numerical value
    most detrimental to tornado formation.
    
    The provided data shows an environment with extremely strong dynamics for tornadoes:
    - SFC-1km SRH (Storm-Relative Helicity) is 361 m^2/s^2, which is very high and indicates strong low-level rotation.
    - SFC-6km Shear is 66 kts, which is more than sufficient for organized supercells.
    - Multiple CAPE (instability) values are high, with MUCAPE at 2136 J/kg.
    - The Significant Tornado Parameter (STP) is 4.7, indicating a very favorable setup.

    However, we must find the greatest inhibitor. A critical factor for tornadogenesis is the LCL (Lifting Condensation Level) height, which corresponds to the cloud base height. While the initial surface LCL is very low and favorable (228 m), the forecast (FCST) parcel, which simulates conditions during peak daytime heating, shows a much different picture.
    
    The FCST LCL is 1211 meters.
    
    A high cloud base (typically >1000m) significantly hinders tornadogenesis because it increases the vertical distance that developing rotation must travel and be stretched to reach the ground. This makes the process much less efficient and more prone to failure. Even with immense rotation present in the storm's mid-levels, a high base can prevent a tornado from forming.
    
    Therefore, the forecast for a high cloud base is the most significant negative factor in this otherwise volatile atmospheric setup.
