    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pieces required to construct a Red-Blue Hackenbush game whose value is $\\frac{13}{16}$. For dyadic rational numbers (fractions where the denominator is a power of 2), the representation in Hackenbush is a simple stack of colored pieces.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Decomposition:** First, we separate the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ into its integer part and its fractional part.\n2.  **Integer Part:** The integer part determines the number of initial blue pieces (for a positive integer). For $\\frac{13}{16}$, the integer part is 0, so there are 0 pieces for this part.\n3.  **Fractional Part:** The representation of the fractional part is determined by its binary expansion. The number of pieces needed for the fractional part is equal to the number of digits after the binary point.\n4.  **Binary Conversion:** We convert the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ to its binary form. Since $16 = 2^4$, the binary representation will have exactly 4 digits after the point. Specifically, $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} = 1 \\cdot 2^{-1} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-2} + 0 \\cdot 2^{-3} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-4}$, which is $0.1101$ in binary.\n5.  **Counting Pieces:** The binary representation $0.1101$ has 4 digits. According to the rules of Hackenbush representation, this corresponds to a stack of 4 pieces.\n6.  **Total:** The total number of pieces is the sum of pieces for the integer and fractional parts.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces needed to represent a fraction in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n    \"\"\"\n    numerator = 13\n    denominator = 16\n\n    # Step 1: Decompose into integer and fractional parts\n    integer_part = numerator // denominator\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate pieces for the integer part\n    # A positive integer I is represented by a stack of I blue pieces.\n    integer_pieces = integer_part\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate pieces for the fractional part\n    # The number of pieces for the fraction is determined by the power of 2 in the denominator.\n    # For a fraction p/q where q = 2^k, k pieces are needed. k = log2(q).\n    if (denominator > 0) and (denominator & (denominator - 1) == 0):\n        # Denominator is a power of 2\n        fractional_pieces = int(math.log2(denominator))\n    else:\n        # If the denominator is not a power of two, it cannot be represented by a finite stack.\n        print(f\"The fraction {numerator}/{denominator} cannot be represented by a finite Hackenbush stack.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate total pieces\n    total_pieces = integer_pieces + fractional_pieces\n    \n    # Explain the result\n    print(f\"To find the number of pieces to represent the fraction {numerator}/{denominator}:\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
