    Solves the problem of finding the number of sequences and the parameters of the largest term.
    
    The logic proceeds in four main steps:
    1.  The structure of the terms `tet(2, a) * pow(2, b)` is analyzed. Each term is shown to be equivalent to a unique power of 2, `2^k`, where k >= 1.
    2.  The problem is interpreted as representing 10^100 as a sum of distinct powers of two. This leads to the conclusion that the representation is unique (it's the binary expansion), so the count of sequences is 1.
    3.  The largest term in this unique sequence is identified. It corresponds to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 10^100. The exponent `k1` of this term is calculated.
    4.  The parameters `a1` and `b1` for this largest term are calculated from `k1` based on the given formula `k1 = 2^(a1-1) + b1`.
    """

    # Based on the reasoning that the representation as a sum of distinct powers
    # of two is unique, the number of such sequences is 1.
    count_of_sequences = 1

    # The target number is N = 10^100.
    # The largest term t1 = tet(2, a1) * pow(2, b1) corresponds to the largest power of 2 <= N.
    # Let t1 = 2^k1. We find k1 by taking the floor of log2(N).
    # k1 = floor(log2(10^100)) = floor(100 * log2(10))
    k1 = math.floor(100 * math.log2(10))

    # From the relation k1 = 2^(a1-1) + b1, where b1 < 2^(a1-1),
    # it follows that a1-1 is the exponent of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to k1.
    # So, a1-1 = floor(log2(k1)).
    m = math.floor(math.log2(k1))
    a1 = m + 1

    # The value of 2^(a1-1) is 2^m.
    power_of_2_component = 2**m

    # We can now calculate b1 as the remainder.
    b1 = k1 - power_of_2_component

    # The final output should contain the count, a1, and b1.
