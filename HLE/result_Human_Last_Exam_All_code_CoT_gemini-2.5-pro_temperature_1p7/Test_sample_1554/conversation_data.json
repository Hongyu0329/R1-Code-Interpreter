    "The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made this distinction is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. He analyzed the concept of a \"hallmark\" (in Polish, *cecha*) and broke it down into:\n\n1.  **Symptoms** (*symptomy*): These are natural signs. The connection between a symptom and what it indicates is based on a law of nature. For example, a high temperature is a symptom of an illness.\n2.  **Signals** (*sygna≈Çy*): These are conventional signs. The connection between a signal and what it signifies is based on a rule or agreement made by people. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
