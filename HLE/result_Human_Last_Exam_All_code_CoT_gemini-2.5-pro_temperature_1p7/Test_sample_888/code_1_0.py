# Step 1-6: Define the relationships between the constants and find their values based on normalization.
# From comparing the calculated denominator with the given one:
# K_1 = 2 * K_2
# K_1 = -4 * K_3
# K_4 = 2
# We choose a normalization convention by setting K_2 = 1.

K_2 = 1
K_1 = 2 * K_2
K_3 = -K_1 / 4
K_4 = 2

# Step 7: Determine the value of K.
# We hypothesize a relationship between K and K_3, K = -K_3, as a plausible interpretation for an otherwise undefined constant.
K = -K_3

# Step 8: Calculate the final product.
product = K * K_1 * K_2 * K_3 * K_4
