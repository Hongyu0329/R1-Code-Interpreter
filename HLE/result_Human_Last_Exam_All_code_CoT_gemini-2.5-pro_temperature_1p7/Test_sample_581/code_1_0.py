# The cap set problem asks for the maximum number of points in an n-dimensional
# affine space over the field with 3 elements, F_3^n, with no three points on a line.
# This maximum size is denoted by r_3(n).

# We are looking for the best-known lower bound for r_3(8).

# A common method to find a lower bound is the product construction.
# If we have known cap set sizes for smaller dimensions, we can multiply them.
# The inequality is: r_3(n + m) >= r_3(n) * r_3(m).

# To find a lower bound for r_3(8), we can try different combinations, for example:
# 8 = 4 + 4  --> r_3(8) >= r_3(4) * r_3(4)
# 8 = 5 + 3  --> r_3(8) >= r_3(5) * r_3(3)
# 8 = 6 + 2  --> r_3(8) >= r_3(6) * r_3(2)

# The known exact values for smaller dimensions are:
# r_3(2) = 4
# r_3(3) = 9
# r_3(4) = 20
# r_3(5) = 45
# r_3(6) = 112

# The best product construction uses the values for n=6 and n=2.
r3_of_6 = 112
r3_of_2 = 4

# Calculate the lower bound using the product of r_3(6) and r_3(2).
lower_bound_product = r3_of_6 * r3_of_2
