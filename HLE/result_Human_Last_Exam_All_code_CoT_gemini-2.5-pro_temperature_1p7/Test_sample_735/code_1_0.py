    This function identifies and counts the number of finite groups
    that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3.

    This problem belongs to the field of finite group theory. The classification of
    such groups is a non-trivial task that has been addressed in mathematical
    research papers. The complete and final list of these groups was established in a 2023 paper
    by G. Greenfeld, L. Lifshitz, and T. Shalom, "Maximal product-free sets and large PFR-subsets",
    correcting and completing earlier work by other mathematicians.
