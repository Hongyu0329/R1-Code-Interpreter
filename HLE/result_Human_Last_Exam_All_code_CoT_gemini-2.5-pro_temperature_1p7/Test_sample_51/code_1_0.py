    Analyzes the inconsistency in dependent type theory based on the user's prompt.
    The prompt describes a dependent type theory with a non-standard subterm relation
    for its structural recursion, which makes the system computationally and logically unsound.
    The goal is to identify which axiom from the list becomes inconsistent with this system.
    """

    explanation = """
The core of the problem is that the specified subterm relation is not well-founded. Specifically, the rule that 'a lambda (Î» x. f) is a subterm of X whenever X is a subterm of X' means any lambda is a valid recursive argument, regardless of the original input. This breaks termination checking and allows for general recursion.

This newfound computational power can be seen as giving the system the ability to 'observe' the syntactic structure of terms in ways normally impossible. The question then becomes: which axiom clashes with this observational power?

The answer is Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP).

1.  UIP states that all proofs of a given equality (e.g., all proofs that x = y) are themselves equal. It is a 'semantic' axiom that says the reasoning behind an equality doesn't matter, only the result.
2.  The observational power from the flawed recursion is 'syntactic'. It might allow the definition of a function that distinguishes two proofs of the same equality based on their different constructions.
3.  The contradiction arises here: The system has a computational, syntactic way to tell two proofs apart, while UIP axiomatically asserts that they are equal. This leads to inconsistency.
