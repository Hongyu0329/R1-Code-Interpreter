    "To find the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations of the independent variables (time $t$ and space $\\mathbf{x}$) and dependent variables (velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ and pressure $p$) that leave the equations invariant. The dimension of the group is the total number of independent parameters in these transformations.\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$\n$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine the dimension:\n1.  **Identify Symmetry Groups**: The full symmetry group is composed of several smaller, well-known groups of transformations. We will identify each one.\n2.  **Determine Dimension of Each Group**: For each group of transformations, we will count the number of independent parameters, which corresponds to the dimension of that subgroup.\n3.  **Sum the Dimensions**: The dimension of the full Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of these independent symmetry subgroups.\n\nThe symmetry transformations and their dimensions are as follows:\n\n*   **Time Translation**: The equations are invariant under a shift in time ($t \\rightarrow t + s$). This is a one-parameter group, adding **1** to the total dimension.\n*   **Space Translations**: The equations are invariant under a shift in spatial coordinates ($\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$). Since space is 3-dimensional, this is a three-parameter group, adding **3** to the total dimension.\n*   **Space Rotations**: The equations are invariant under rotations of the spatial coordinates ($\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{x}$, where $R \\in SO(3)$). The velocity field transforms as a vector ($\\mathbf{v} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{v}$). The group of rotations in 3D, $SO(3)$, is a three-parameter group, adding **3** to the total dimension.\n*   **Galilean Boosts**: These transformations represent a shift to a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity ($\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}t$, $\\mathbf{v} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{c}$). This is a three-parameter group (one for each direction of the boost velocity $\\mathbf{c}$), adding **3** to the total dimension. The pressure field also transforms to maintain invariance.\n*   **Scaling Transformation**: The Navier-Stokes equations possess a specific scaling symmetry. If we scale time, space, velocity, and pressure according to $t \\rightarrow \\lambda^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\lambda \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{v} \\rightarrow \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{v}$, and $p \\rightarrow \\lambda^{-2} p$, the equations remain invariant. This is a one-parameter group (parameterized by $\\lambda$), adding **1** to the total dimension.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the sum of these dimensions and presents the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The dimension is found by summing the dimensions of the independent\n    # symmetry subgroups that leave the equations invariant.\n\n    # 1.
