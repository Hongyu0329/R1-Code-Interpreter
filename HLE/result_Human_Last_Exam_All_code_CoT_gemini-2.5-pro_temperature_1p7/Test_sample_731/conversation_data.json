    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. In the standard notation for this family of groups, $SD_{2^n}$, the size is $2^n$. So, we have $2^n = 512$, which gives $n = \\log_2(512) = 9$. We are dealing with the group $SD_{2^9}$.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a set of the form $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. For the groups we are considering (which are p-groups), these sets are always subgroups.\n\n3.  **Identify Distinct Power Subgroups:**\n    *   The group $SD_{2^n}$ is a 2-group (its order is a power of 2). For any 2-group $G$ and any integer $k$, we can write $k = m \\cdot 2^j$ where $m$ is odd. The power subgroup $G^k$ will be identical to $G^{2^j}$. Therefore, we only need to count the number of distinct subgroups we get by taking powers of 2.\n    *   Let $G = SD_{2^n}$. We need to list the distinct subgroups in the sequence $G^1, G^2, G^4, G^8, \\dots, G^{2^j}, \\dots$.\n    *   For $j=0$, we have $G^1 = G = SD_{2^n}$. This is the first distinct power subgroup.\n    *   For $j=1$, the subgroup is $G^2$. It can be shown that this is a cyclic subgroup of order $2^{n-2}$. For $n=9$, this is a cyclic group of order $2^7=128$.\n    *   For $j \\ge 2$, the power subgroup $G^{2^j}$ is a cyclic subgroup of order $2^{n-1-j}$.\n    *   As we increase $j$, we get a sequence of strictly smaller cyclic subgroups:\n        *   $G^1 = SD_{2^9}$ (non-cyclic)\n        *   $G^2 \\cong C_{128}$ (Cyclic group of order 128)\n        *   $G^4 \\cong C_{64}$\n        *   $G^8 \\cong C_{32}$\n        *   $G^{16} \\cong C_{16}$\n        *   $G^{32} \\cong C_{8}$\n        *   $G^{64} \\cong C_{4}$\n        *   $G^{128} \\cong C_2$\n        *   $G^{256} = \\{1\\}$ (The trivial subgroup)\n    *   These subgroups are all distinct. The first one is non-cyclic, while the rest are cyclic subgroups of different orders.\n\n4.  **Count the Subgroups:** By listing the distinct subgroups, we have 1 non-cyclic subgroup ($SD_{512}$ itself) and 8 distinct cyclic subgroups (including the trivial group). The total count is $1 + 8 = 9$.\n\nIn general, for the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$, there are exactly $n$ power subgroups. Here, since $n=9$, the number is 9.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result based on the explained logic.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 512\n\n    # The semidihedral group is of the form SD_{2^n}.\n    # We find n such that 2^n = group_order.\n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n\n    # For the semidihedral group SD_{2^n}, the number of distinct power subgroups is n.\n    # This comes from the set of subgroups {G, G^2, G^4, ..., G^{2^(n-1)}}.\n    # The subgroups are:\n    # 1. The group G = SD_{2^n} itself.\n    # 2. A set of n-1 distinct cyclic subgroups.\n    num_non_cyclic = 1\n    num_cyclic = n - 1\n    total_subgroups = num_non_cyclic + num_cyclic\n\n    print(\"The semidihedral group is of order 512 = 2^n.\")\n    print(f\"Here, n = log2(512) = {n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe number of power subgroups in SD_{2^n} is n.\")\n    print(\"This is composed of the group itself (non-cyclic) and n-1 distinct cyclic subgroups.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"Number of non-cyclic power subgroups = {num_non_cyclic}\")\n    print(f\"Number of cyclic power subgroups = n - 1 = {n} - 1 = {num_cyclic}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of power subgroups = {num_non_cyclic} + {num_cyclic} = {total_subgroups}\")\n    \nsolve_power_subgroups()\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"
