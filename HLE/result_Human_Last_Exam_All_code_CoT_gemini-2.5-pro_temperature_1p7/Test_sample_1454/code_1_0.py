# The problem is to find the smallest possible number of nondegenerate, locally connected components
# of a closed set F in the unit square that satisfies a given self-similarity equation.
#
# 1. The equation for F is F = union_{d in D} (F+d)/4.
#    This is a fixed-point equation F = T(F).
#
# 2. We look for closed sets F within the unit square [0,1]^2 that are solutions.
#    There are two such solutions:
#    a) The empty set: F = {}. T({}) = {} is a valid solution.
#    b) The non-empty attractor of the Iterated Function System (IFS), let's call it A.
#
# 3. We analyze the number of components for each solution.
#    a) For F = {}, the number of components is 0. Since there are no components, the
#       conditions (nondegenerate, locally connected) are vacuously satisfied.
#    b) For F = A, the set is the product of a Cantor set and the unit interval, A = C_x x [0,1].
#       Its components are vertical line segments {c} x [0,1] for each c in the Cantor set C_x.
#       There are uncountably many such components. Each is a line segment, so it is
#       nondegenerate and locally connected. The number of components is infinite.
#
# 4. The question asks for the "smallest possible number". Comparing the number of components
#    from the possible solutions {0, infinity}, the smallest value is 0.
