The experimentally observed Si-N bond distance is shorter than the value calculated from covalent radii due to a phenomenon called pπ-dπ back-bonding.

1.  **Nitrogen's Role**: In a molecule like Me3Si-NHMe, the nitrogen atom has a lone pair of electrons residing in a p-orbital (specifically, a 2p orbital).

2.  **Silicon's Role**: Silicon is in the third period of the periodic table, which means it has vacant and energetically accessible 3d orbitals.

3.  **The Interaction (Back-bonding)**: A dative bond can form where the electron density from the filled 2p orbital of nitrogen is donated back into one of the empty 3d orbitals of silicon. This is called a pπ-dπ interaction.

4.  **The Result**: This interaction creates additional π-bond character on top of the existing σ-bond. The Si-N bond is therefore not a pure single bond but has partial double bond character. A bond with a higher order (greater than 1) is stronger and shorter.

This mechanism correctly explains why the Si-N bond is shorter and stronger than expected for a simple single bond.
