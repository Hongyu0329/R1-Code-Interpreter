    Solves the Capablanca chess puzzle presented.

    The solution is a forced mate in 3 moves for White.
    The main line of play, assuming optimal defense from Black, is as follows:

    1. Af4+ Ki8
       White's Archbishop moves as a bishop to f4, checking the black King.
       Black's best move is to move the King to i8, as other moves like blocking with
       the Chancellor lead to a faster mate.

    2. Qd6!
       A quiet but deadly move. White's Queen repositions to d6, creating
       unstoppable mating threats. Black must defend. Black's two primary
       defenses involve moving the Chancellor.

       a) If Black plays 2... cj7 (Chancellor to j7 to guard j6):
          White responds with 3. Qxc7#, which is checkmate.
          The Queen on j7 checks the King, which has no escape squares.

       b) If Black plays 2... ch6 (Chancellor to h6 to guard j6):
          White responds with 3. Qe5#, which is also checkmate.
          The Queen on e5 checks the King, which again has no escape squares.

    Since all of Black's optimal defenses lead to a mate on White's 3rd move,
    the minimum number of moves to win is 3.
