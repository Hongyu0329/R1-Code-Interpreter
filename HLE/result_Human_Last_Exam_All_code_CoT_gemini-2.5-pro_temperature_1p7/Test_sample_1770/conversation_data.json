    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in engineered *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you should knock out the gene responsible for the first step in its catabolic pathway. When a desired chemical is produced, it can often be consumed by the host organism as a carbon source. Identifying and deleting the gene that initiates this consumption is a common metabolic engineering strategy to increase product yield.\n\nIn *C. glutamicum*, the degradation of p-coumaric acid begins with its activation into p-coumaroyl-CoA. This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme called phenolic acid CoA ligase (or coumarate-CoA ligase). The gene encoding this enzyme is the ideal target for knockout. By deleting this gene, p-coumaric acid cannot enter the degradation pathway and will accumulate in the cell.\n\nBased on scientific literature, the gene for this enzyme in *C. glutamicum* ATCC 13032 is `cg2921` (also referred to by the gene name `phdL`).\n\nThe following Python script demonstrates how you might query a simplified database to identify this target gene.\n\n```python\ndef find_knockout_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a query to a biological database to find the best gene\n    knockout target to prevent p-coumaric acid degradation in C. glutamicum.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A simplified database representing genes in C. glutamicum related to p-coumaric acid.\n    # In a real-world scenario, this data would come from databases like KEGG, BioCyc, or NCBI.\n    gene_database = {\n        \"cg2921\": {\n            \"name\": \"phdL\",\n            \"function\": \"Phenolic acid CoA ligase\",\n            \"pathway\": \"p-coumaric acid degradation\",\n            \"notes\": \"Catalyzes the first committed step in the p-coumaric acid degradation pathway.
