    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule:** The starting material is `di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide`. A chemical reduction of a disulfide bond (R-S-S-R) breaks the central sulfur-sulfur bond to produce two identical thiol molecules (2 x R-SH). Therefore, the major reduction product to be analyzed is **perylene-3-thiol**.\n\n2.  **Define Topological Indices:**\n    *   **Wiener Index (W):** This is the sum of the shortest path lengths between all possible pairs of atoms (nodes) in the molecular graph. The formula is `W = 1/2 * Σ d(u,v)` for all pairs of nodes `u` and `v`, where `d(u,v)` is the shortest path distance.\n    *   **Szeged Index (Sz):** This index is calculated based on the edges (bonds) of the graph. For each bond `e = (u,v)`, we determine `n_u`, the number of atoms closer to atom `u` than to `v`, and `n_v`, the number of atoms closer to atom `v` than to `u`. The index is the sum of the products `n_u * n_v` over all bonds in the molecule: `Sz = Σ (n_u * n_v)`.\n\n3.  **Computational Strategy:**\n    *   I will use the cheminformatics library `RDKit` to correctly represent the perylene-3-thiol molecule. I will obtain its structure using its canonical SMILES string from a chemical database (PubChem).\n    *   As the problem specifies \"including H\", I will ensure all hydrogen atoms are explicitly included in the molecular model. The correct molecular formula is C₂₀H₁₂S.\n    *   I will convert this molecular structure into a graph using the `networkx` library, where atoms are the graph's nodes and bonds are its edges.\n    *   Using this graph, I will first compute the shortest path distances between all pairs of atoms, which is required for both indices.\n    *   Then, I will implement the formulas for the Wiener and Szeged indices as described above.\n    *   Finally, I will calculate the required ratio (Sz / W) and print the results.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"RDKit is not installed. Please install it using 'pip install rdkit-pypi'\")\n    sys.exit(1)\ntry:\n    import networkx as nx\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"NetworkX is not installed.
