    "My plan is to find the parameters that generate the sides of the rational right triangle. A right triangle with rational sides `a, b, c` and area `A` can be constructed from a primitive Pythagorean triple `(x_p, y_p, z_p)` scaled by a rational factor `d`. A primitive Pythagorean triple is generated by two coprime integers `m, n` of opposite parity, with `m > n`. The sides are `x_p = m^2 - n^2`, `y_p = 2mn`, and `z_p = m^2 + n^2`.\n\nThe area of this primitive triangle is `A_p = (1/2)x_p y_p = mn(m^2 - n^2)`.\nOur triangle with sides `(a, b, c) = (d*x_p, d*y_p, d*z_p)` has area `A = d^2 * A_p`.\nGiven `A = 263`, we have `d^2 * mn(m^2 - n^2) = 263`.\nSince `d` is a rational number, let `d = k/w` for integers `k, w`.\n`(k/w)^2 * mn(m^2 - n^2) = 263`\n`k^2 * mn(m^2 - n^2) = 263 * w^2`\n\nThis implies that the square-free part of the integer `mn(m^2 - n^2)` must be 263. `m, n` are the generators of a primitive Pythagorean triple. The product can be factored as `mn(m-n)(m+n)`. For such generators `m, n`, the factors `m`, `n`, `m-n`, `m+n` are pairwise coprime.\nFor their product to have a square-free part of 263, one of these four factors must have a square-free part of 263, and the other three must be perfect squares (square-free part of 1).\n\nThis gives four cases to check:\n1.  `m = 263u^2`, `n=v^2`, `m-n=x^2`, `m+n=y^2`. This implies `x^2+y^2 = 2m = 2 \\cdot 263 u^2`, and `v^2+x^2=m=263u^2`. `v^2+x^2=263u^2` has no integer solutions because 263 is a prime of the form `4k+3`, and such a number cannot be a sum of two squares unless both are zero.\n2.  `n = 263u^2`, `m=v^2`, `m-n=x^2`, `m+n=y^2`. This requires `m, n` to have opposite parity. `v` and `u` must be chosen accordingly. This case leads to a Diophantine equation that is difficult to solve and corresponds to finding rational points on an elliptic curve. While this case does lead to a solution, the numbers involved are known to be enormous.\n3.  `m-n = 263u^2`, `m=v^2`, `n=x^2`, `m+n=y^2`. This implies `y^2-v^2=n=x^2`, and `v^2-x^2=m-n=263u^2`. From `y^2=v^2+x^2`, we know `(x,v,y)` is a Pythagorean triple. The other equation is `v^2-x^2=1`, which has only the integer solution `v=1, x=0`, making `n=0`, which is not allowed.\n4.  `m+n = 263u^2`, `m=v^2`, `n=x^2`, `m-n=y^2`. This implies `x^2+y^2=v^2`, which is a Pythagorean triple. Then `v^2+x^2 = m+n = 263u^2`. This leads to `2(p^4+q^4)=263a^2` for integers `p, q, a`, which can be shown to have no solution using modular arithmetic.\n\nThe simplest case that doesn't immediately lead to a contradiction is Case 2, but it's very hard. Let's reconsider the case where `m, n` can be both odd. This gives a non-primitive triple, but a valid rational-sided triangle.\nIf `m, n` are odd, the area of the corresponding primitive triangle is `A_p' = mn(m^2-n^2)/4`.\nThe condition becomes `sf(mn(m^2-n^2)/4) = 263`. This means `sf(mn(m-n)(m+n)) = 263`.\nThe pairwise coprime factors are now `m, n, (m-n)/2, (m+n)/2`. One of these must have a square-free part of 263. This leads to a new set of cases which are similar to the original ones and also very difficult to solve for small numbers.\n\nThe problem of finding the smallest solution is computationally intensive and relies on advanced number theory related to elliptic curves. I will provide a Python script to search for a solution based on one of the more plausible scenarios. We are looking for integers `p, q` that generate a Pythagorean triple `(c,d,b)`, which then relates to our problem generators `m, n`. This chain of relations leads to needing `|p^4-6p^2q^2+q^4|` to be `263` times a perfect square. The hypotenuse of the final triangle can be computed from `m, n`. Let's search for the smallest `p, q` that satisfy the condition and compute the corresponding hypotenuse.\n\nLet's trace the hypotenuse calculation from `p, q`.\nFrom Case B' in my thoughts (`m=b^2`, `n=263a^2`, both odd): `b^2=c^2+d^2`. We set `b=p^2+q^2`. Then we found `|d^2-c^2| = 263a^2`.\nThe area `A=263` is `d^2 A_p'`, where `A_p' = mn(m^2-n^2)/4` and `d` is the rational scaling factor.\n`263 = d^2 * m*n*((m+n)/2)*((m-n)/2)`. `m=b^2=(p^2+q^2)^2, n=263a^2`.\nThe hypotenuse `z_side = (m^2+n^2)/2` (primitive). Our hypotenuse `c = d * z_side`.\n`d = \\sqrt{263/A_p'}`.\nSo `c = \\sqrt{263/A_p'} * (m^2+n^2)/2 = \\sqrt{263*A_p'}/A_p' * (m^2+n^2)/2`.\n`A_p' = 263*s^2`. `d=1/s`. `c = (m^2+n^2)/(2s)`. `s` here is `a`.\nSo, `c = ((p^2+q^2)^4 + (263a^2)^2)/(2a)`.\nThe script will find `p, q, a`, then calculate the numerator and denominator of `c`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.\"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef find_smallest_denominator():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function searches for integer parameters (p, q) that generate a right\n    triangle with area 263. It's based on analyzing the structure of such\n    triangles, which leads to a Diophantine equation. The equation being solved is\n    abs(p**4 - 6*p**2*q**2 + q**4) == 263 * a**2 for some integer a.\n    Once a solution (p, q, a) is found, it is used to construct the generators (m, n)\n    of a Pythagorean triple, which in turn gives the sides of the triangle.\n    The hypotenuse is then calculated and its denominator is determined.\n    \"\"\"\n    limit = 2000 # Search limit for p\n    for p in range(1, limit):\n        for q in range(1, p):\n            # p,q must be coprime and have opposite parity to generate a\n            # primitive Pythagorean triple (c,d,b).\n            if (p + q) % 2 == 1 and gcd(p, q) == 1:\n                val = abs(p**4 - 6 * p**2 * q**2 + q**4)\n                # We need val to be 263 times a perfect square\n                if val % 263 == 0:\n                    a_sq = val // 263\n                    if a_sq > 0 and math.isqrt(a_sq) ** 2 == a_sq:\n                        a = math.isqrt(a_sq)\n                        \n                        # We have found a solution (p, q, a).
