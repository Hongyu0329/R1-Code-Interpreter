    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`. For any electron, the spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, arises from the coupling of orbital and spin angular momenta ($\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{S}$). The possible values of `j` are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series: $j = |l - s|, |l - s| + 1, \\dots, l + s$.\n3.  **Determine Magnetic Quantum Number (m_j):** For each value of `j`, the total magnetic quantum number, `m_j`, can take on `2j + 1` values, from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:**\n    *   The eigenvalues of the operator $J^2$ are given by the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the operator $J_z$ are given by the formula $\\hbar m_j$.\n5.  **Develop Python Script:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations systematically. The script will iterate through all possible `j` values and their corresponding `m_j` values, and then print the eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$ in units where $\\hbar = 1$. The output will explicitly show the numbers used in the eigenvalue equations.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z\n    for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 1.\n    l = 1\n    # For an electron, the spin quantum number s is 1/2.\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(\"For a p-electron, we have orbital quantum number l = 1 and spin quantum number s = 1/2.\")\n    print(\"The total angular momentum J is the sum of orbital (L) and spin (S) angular momentum.\")\n    print(\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j, range from |l-s| to l+s.\")\n    print(f\"So, for l=1 and s=0.5, j can be |{l} - {s}| = {abs(l-s)} or {l} + {s} = {l+s}.\\n\")\n\n    # The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n    j_values = [l + s, abs(l - s)]\n\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of the J^2 operator are j(j+1)*hbar^2.\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of the J_z operator are m_j*hbar.\")\n    print(\"We will calculate these eigenvalues for each possible j (in units where hbar = 1).\\n\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Loop through each possible j value, starting from the largest\n    for j in sorted(j_values, reverse=True):\n        # Calculate the eigenvalue for J^2\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        # Determine the possible m_j values for the current j\n        # m_j ranges from -j to +j in integer steps.\n        m_j_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1.0)\n        \n        print(f\"For the state with total angular momentum quantum number j = {j}:\")\n        \n        # Print the J^2 eigenvalue equation and result\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue of J^2 = j(j+1) = {j} * ({j} + 1) = {j2_eigenvalue:.2f}\")\n        \n        # Print the J_z eigenvalues for all possible m_j\n        print(f\"  For this j, the magnetic quantum number m_j can be: {', '.join(map(str, m_j_values))}.\")\n        print(\"  The corresponding eigenvalues of J_z are m_j:\")\n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            print(f\"    m_j = {m_j: >4.1f}  =>  Eigenvalue of J_z = {m_j: >4.1f}\")\n            \n        print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# Run the function to display the solution\nsolve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n```\n<<<The common eigenvalues are: for j=3/2, the J^2 eigenvalue is 3.75 (in units of hbar^2) and the J_z eigenvalues are -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5 (in units of hbar).
