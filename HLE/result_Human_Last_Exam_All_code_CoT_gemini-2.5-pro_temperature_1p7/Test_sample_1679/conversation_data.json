    "To find the first Best Picture winner that depicts a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Obelisk Locations:** First, I'll establish the locations of the two famous Luxor Obelisks. One remains at the Luxor Temple in Egypt, while the other is at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **List Relevant Films:** I will consider the list of Academy Award for Best Picture winners and filter for those set in either Paris or Egypt, as they are the only potential candidates.\n3.  **Confirm Depiction:** I will use film history knowledge to check which of these candidates actually depicts an obelisk on-screen. A film simply being set in Paris is not sufficient; it must visually feature the Place de la Concorde.\n4.  **Find the Earliest Winner:** By checking the confirmed films chronologically, I will identify the first one to win the award.\n5.  **Code the Logic:** I will write a Python script to automate this search. The script will use a data structure containing key film candidates and a flag indicating a confirmed obelisk sighting. It will then iterate through this data to find and print the answer. Based on research, the key candidates are *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), *An American in Paris* (1951), *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), and *Gigi* (1958). *An American in Paris* is the first confirmed case.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_movie_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner\n    to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This list represents film research.
