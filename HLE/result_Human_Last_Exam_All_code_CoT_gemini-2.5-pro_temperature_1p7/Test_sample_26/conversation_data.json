    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we will follow a multi-step plan that combines classical algebraic topology with results from rational homotopy theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine Topological Invariants of X**: We will first calculate the fundamental topological invariants of the surface $X$, specifically its Betti numbers ($b_k$). This will rely on standard formulas for hypersurfaces in complex projective space.\n2.  **Invoke Rational Homotopy Theory**: Since we are interested in the *rank* of an abelian group, we can study its rationalization, $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. For a certain class of \"nice\" topological spaces, called *formal spaces*, the dimension of rational homotopy groups can be computed directly from the cohomology algebra. A smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected and Kähler, which is sufficient for it to be formal.\n3.  **Apply the Formula for $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3)$**: For a simply connected formal space $X$ with $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, the rank of its third homotopy group is given by the dimension of the kernel of the cup product map on the second cohomology group:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim(\\ker(\\cup: \\Lambda^2 H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q}))) $$\n4.  **Calculate the Final Rank**: Using the Betti numbers calculated in step 1, we will determine the dimensions of the vector spaces in the formula above and use the rank-nullity theorem to find the dimension of the kernel, which gives us the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\nThe Python code below implements these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_pi3_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic\n    hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define parameters and compute the Euler characteristic.\n    # X is a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n    # d is the degree of the hypersurface.\n    # n is the complex dimension of the hypersurface.\n    d = 5\n    n = 2\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Compute the topological invariants of the quintic hypersurface X.\")\n    # The formula for the Euler characteristic chi of a smooth hypersurface of\n    # degree d in CP^3 is given by d * (d^2 - 4*d + 6).\n    chi = d * (d**2 - 4*d + 6)\n    \n    print(f\"The degree of the hypersurface is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The Euler characteristic is chi = {d} * ({d}^2 - 4*{d} + 6) = {chi}.\")\n\n    # By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, X is simply connected, so b1 = 0.\n    # By Poincare duality, b3 = b1, so b3 = 0.\n    # X is connected, so b0 = 1.
