The function `f` is defined as `f(w) = (Aʷ)⊥ = (A ⊗ ... ⊗ A) ⊸ ⊥`, where `w` is the input natural number, `A` is a fixed formula without literals (e.g., `A=⊥`), and `Aʷ` denotes the tensor product of `w` copies of `A`.

The formula `C` is defined as `C(W, m, b) = Pᵐ = P ⊗ ... ⊗ P`, where `m` is the number of partitions, and `P` is the formula `(Aᵇ)⊥ = (A ⊗ ... ⊗ A) ⊸ ⊥`, with `b` being the target sum for each partition. Note that `C` does not depend on the set `W`.
