    print("A. a8=Q: Promotes the pawn immediately. Black must respond with 1... Nxa8. White trades the winning pawn for a knight, significantly reducing the advantage and likely leading to a draw.")
    
    print("\nB. Nc5: An excellent positional move. The knight attacks the e6-pawn and, more importantly, prevents the black king from moving to the e5 square. This restricts Black's most active piece and systematically builds pressure. This is a clear path to a winning position.")
    
    print("\nC. Kd4: A good, active king move. However, it allows Black to respond with 1... Ke4, creating complications as the black king also becomes very active. It is less precise than Nc5.")
    
    print("\nD. Kf2: A passive move. The king moves away from the queenside where the main action is. This gives Black time to organize their defense.")

    print("\nE. Nf4: A tactical error. It allows the powerful response 1... Ke4!, where the black king attacks the white knight and takes control of the center, leaving White in a worse position.")

    print("\nF. b4: Another very strong move. It challenges Black's pawn structure and creates tactical problems. This is also a winning move, comparable in strength to Nc5.")

    print("\n---")
    print("Conclusion: Both Nc5 and b4 are decisive, but Nc5 is arguably the most precise. It improves White's position while severely restricting Black's options, which is a classic method for converting an advantage.")
