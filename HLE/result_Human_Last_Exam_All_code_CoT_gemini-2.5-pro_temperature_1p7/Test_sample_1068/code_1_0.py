# The problem asks for the value of l(p) for p=14.
# Based on the step-by-step derivation, the function l(p) simplifies to 2 * p * ln(2).
p = 14

# The final equation for l(14) is 2 * 14 * ln(2).
# The numbers in this equation are:
num1 = 2
num2 = p
log_of_2 = math.log(2)

# Calculate the final result.
result = num1 * num2 * log_of_2

# Print the components of the equation and the final answer.
