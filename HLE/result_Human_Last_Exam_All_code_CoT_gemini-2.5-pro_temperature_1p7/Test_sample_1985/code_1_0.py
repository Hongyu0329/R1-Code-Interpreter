    Solves the boundary value problem to find ||x(1)||^2.

    The solution proceeds by first noting that the problem is decoupled.
    For any index n other than k=2^2024, the solution x_n(t) is identically zero.
    Thus, we only need to find x_k(1) for k=2^2024.

    The problem provides two boundary conditions:
    1) M*x(0) - N*x(1) = alpha
    2) x(0) = 1/2 * alpha

    These two algebraic conditions are sufficient to determine x_k(1) without
    integrating the differential equation (which contains inconsistent information).
