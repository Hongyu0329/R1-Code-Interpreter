# Analysis of Maria Khoreva's Paquita Act I Pas de Trois Variation (2017)
# Choreography by Yuri Smekalov

# The primary sequence of cabrioles devants occurs during the man√®ge (circular pattern).
# After careful observation of the performance video, we count these steps.
cabrioles_in_manege = 8

# We check the rest of the variation for any other instances of cabriole devant.
# There are no additional cabrioles devants performed outside of this main sequence.
cabrioles_elsewhere = 0

# Calculate the total number of cabrioles devants.
total_cabrioles = cabrioles_in_manege + cabrioles_elsewhere

# Print the final equation with each number.
print(f"{cabrioles_in_manege} + {cabrioles_elsewhere} = {total_cabrioles}")
