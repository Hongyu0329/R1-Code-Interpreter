    "To find the degrees of all possible intermediate normal field extensions, we first need to determine the Galois group of the given polynomial. The degrees we are looking for are the indices of the proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of this Galois group.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Factor the polynomial**: The given polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ can be factored. We will do this first.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group**: The Galois group of $P(x)$ will be the direct product of the Galois groups of its irreducible factors, provided the splitting fields of these factors have a trivial intersection (which is just $\\mathbb{Q}$).\n    *   We will analyze the Galois group of each factor. For the quintic factor, we will determine its irreducibility, find the number of real roots, and use these facts to identify its Galois group as $S_5$. For the quadratic factor, the group is simply $C_2$.\n    *   We will verify that the splitting fields' intersection is trivial by checking the discriminant of the quintic factor.\n3.  **Find Normal Subgroups and their Indices**: Normal sub-extensions correspond to normal subgroups of the Galois group. We will list all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of the full Galois group $G$.\n4.  **Calculate Degrees**: The degree of a normal sub-extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the index of the corresponding normal subgroup $H$ in $G$. We will calculate these indices, which will give us the set of all possible degrees.\n\nThe following Python code carries out these steps. It uses the `sympy` library for polynomial manipulations and prints the reasoning and final result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_polynomial_extension_degrees():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the possible degrees of intermediate normal field extensions\n    for the splitting field of the polynomial x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6 over Q.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    P = x**7 - 2*x**5 - 9*x**3 + 3*x**2 + 18*x - 6\n\n    print(f\"Original Polynomial P(x) = {P}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Factor the polynomial\n    factors = sympy.factor(P, domain='Q')\n    print(f\"Step 1: The polynomial P(x) factors over Q into: {factors}\")\n\n    # The factors are (x**2 - 2) and (x**5 - 9*x + 3)\n    g, f = factors.args\n    if g.degree() > f.degree():\n        f, g = g, f\n\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    # Step 2: Determine the Galois Group\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the Galois Group of P(x).\")\n    \n    # Analysis of g(x)\n    print(f\"\\nAnalysis of the first factor, g(x) = {g}:\")\n    print(\"The roots are +/- sqrt(2).
