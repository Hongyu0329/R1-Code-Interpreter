    # Question (1): What is the cohomological dimension of H?
    # H has elements of finite order (e.g., 'a' and 'b' have order 2).
    # Any group with torsion has infinite cohomological dimension over the integers Z.
    # Therefore, cd(H) = infinity.

    # Question (2): What is the cohomological dimension of G?
    # G = H * H. Since H has torsion, G also has torsion.
    # For the same reason as for H, cd(G) is infinite.

    # Question (3): What is the virtual cohomological dimension of H?
    # The virtual cohomological dimension (vcd) is the minimal cohomological dimension
    # among all finite-index subgroups.
    # H = D_infty contains the subgroup K = <ab>, which is isomorphic to the infinite
    # cyclic group Z. K has index 2 in H.
    # Z is a free group of rank 1, so its cohomological dimension is 1.
    # Thus, vcd(H) = cd(Z) = 1.

    # Question (4): What is the virtual cohomological dimension of G?
    # G = C_2 * C_2 * C_2 * C_2, a free product of four finite groups.
    # A free product of finite groups is virtually free (i.e., it has a free group
    # as a subgroup of finite index).
    # Let K be a torsion-free, finite-index subgroup of G. For instance, the commutator
    # subgroup [G,G] is a torsion-free subgroup of index 16.
    # By the Kurosh Subgroup Theorem, K is a free group.
    # G is not virtually cyclic (it has infinitely many ends, see Q6), so K must
    # be a non-trivial, non-cyclic free group.
    # The cohomological dimension of any non-trivial free group is 1.
    # Thus, vcd(G) = 1.
    ans4 = 1

    # Question (5): How many ends does H have?
    # Stallings' theorem about ends of groups states that a group has 2 ends
    # if and only if it has an infinite cyclic subgroup (Z) of finite index.
    # As established for Q3, H has a subgroup isomorphic to Z with index 2.
    # Thus, H has 2 ends.
    ans5 = 2

    # Question (6): How many ends does G have?
    # G = H * H, which is a free product of two infinite groups.
    # A free product of two non-trivial groups, where not both have order 2, has
    # infinitely many ends. Since H is infinite, G has infinitely many ends.
    # Alternatively, G = C_2*C_2*C_2*C_2. A free product of n > 2 finite groups
    # always has infinite ends. Here n=4.

    # Question (7): What is the cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
    # P is the pro-p completion of G, where p is an odd prime.
    # The pro-p completion is the inverse limit of all finite p-group quotients of G.
    # A homomorphism from G to a p-group must map the generators of G (of order 2)
    # to elements whose order divides 2.
    # In a p-group with p odd, the only element whose order divides 2 is the identity.
    # Therefore, any homomorphism from G to a p-group is trivial.
    # This means the pro-p completion P is the trivial group {1}.
    # The cohomological dimension of the trivial group is 0.
    ans7 = 0
    answers.append(ans7)

    # Question (8): What is the virtual cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
    # Since P is the trivial group, its only subgroup is itself.
    # Thus, the virtual cohomological dimension is the same as the cohomological dimension.
    # vcd(P) = 0.

    answers.append(ans8)

    # Question (9): What is the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(G,F_p)?
    # For a trivial G-module M, H^1(G, M) is isomorphic to the group of homomorphisms Hom(G, M).
    # Here, M = F_p, the field with p elements.
    # A homomorphism phi: G -> F_p must map generators g_i of G (with g_i^2 = 1)
    # to elements x in F_p such that 2*x = 0.
    # Since p is an odd prime, 2 is non-zero and invertible in F_p.
    # So, 2*x = 0 implies x = 0.
    # Thus, all generators must be mapped to 0, which means the only homomorphism is the trivial one.
    # Hom(G, F_p) = {0}. As a vector space over F_p, its dimension is 0.
