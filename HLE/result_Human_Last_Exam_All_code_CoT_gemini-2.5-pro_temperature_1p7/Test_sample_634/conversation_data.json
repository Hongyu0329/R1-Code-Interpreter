    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the polynomial matrix version of the Euclidean algorithm. This method involves stacking the matrices to form a single larger matrix and then applying elementary row operations to reduce it to its row-echelon form. The non-zero rows of this final reduced matrix form a GCRD. A GCRD is unique up to multiplication on the left by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the row reduction:\n1.  Construct a 4x2 matrix `M` by stacking P1 on top of P2.\n2.  Systematically perform elementary row operations (swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, and adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another) to simplify the matrix. The goal is to create zero entries and reduce the polynomial degrees of the elements, similar to Gaussian elimination.\n3.  We will use rows with lower-degree polynomials as pivots to simplify rows with higher-degree polynomials. For instance, we'll use the row `[s, 0]` from P2 to eliminate the `s^2` terms in P1.\n4.  This process results in simpler rows, some with constant entries, which are then used as new pivots to continue the reduction.\n5.  This process continues until the matrix is in a row-echelon form, where some rows might have become entirely zero.\n6.  The remaining non-zero rows are collected to form the GCRD matrix. The resulting matrix is normalized to a standard form where pivot elements are 1.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two\n    given polynomial matrices P1 and P2 by performing elementary row operations\n    on their stacked form.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n    \n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # 1.
