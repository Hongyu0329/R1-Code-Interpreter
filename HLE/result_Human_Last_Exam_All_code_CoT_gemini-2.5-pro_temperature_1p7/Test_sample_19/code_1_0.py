    Analyzes whether Kant's account in the Critique of Judgment is purely descriptive or also normative.

    Kant's account is descriptive in that it details the cognitive mechanics of aesthetic judgment,
    analyzing the "free play" of the faculties of imagination and understanding.

    However, it is also normative. Kant argues that a true judgment of beauty ("This is beautiful")
    is distinct from a mere statement of preference ("This is agreeable to me"). The judgment of beauty
    carries with it a claim to universal assentâ€”a demand that everyone else ought to agree. This "ought"
    introduces a standard or norm for what constitutes a valid aesthetic judgment. Kant sets forth the
    conditions (e.g., disinterestedness) that a judgment must meet to legitimately make this claim to
    universality.

    Therefore, the account is not purely descriptive; it also prescribes the conditions for a valid judgment.
