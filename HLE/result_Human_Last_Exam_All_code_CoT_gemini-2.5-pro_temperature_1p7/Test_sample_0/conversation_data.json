    "To determine which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views, let's first understand the core concepts.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Critical-Level Views:** This theory in population ethics suggests that adding a person to the world is a net positive only if their welfare is above a certain positive \"critical level\" (c). If their welfare is below this level (but still positive), their existence is considered a net negative. The value contributed by a person with welfare `w` is `w - c`.\n2.  **Define the Non-Elitism Condition:** This principle states that for any single life with a very high level of welfare, there is some very large number of lives at a very low (but still positive) level of welfare that, taken together, would be better. It is designed to prevent a view where one \"super-life\" is considered more valuable than any number of \"mediocre\" lives.\n3.  **Create a Demonstration:** We will use a Python script to model this. We will define a utility function for a critical-level view.\n4.  **Test the Condition:** We will compare two populations:\n    *   Population A: One person with a very high welfare level.\n    *   Population B: A very large number of people with a low but positive welfare level that is *below* the critical level.\n5.  **Analyze the Result:** The script will show that according to the critical-level view, Population A is always better than Population B, no matter how large we make Population B. This directly violates the Non-Elitism condition.\n\nThe script below will carry out this demonstration.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates how Critical-Level Views violate the\n    Non-Elitism condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define parameters for our model ---\n    # The critical level: any life below this has negative value.\n    critical_level = 20\n    # A low but positive welfare level, chosen to be below the critical level.\n    low_positive_welfare = 5\n    # A very high welfare level for one person.\n    high_welfare = 1000\n    # A large number of people for the Non-Elitism test.\n    large_number_of_people = 100000\n\n    # --- Step 2: Define the utility calculation for critical-level views ---\n    def critical_level_value(welfare):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the value of a single person's life.\"\"\"\n        return welfare - critical_level\n\n    # --- Step 3: Analyze the two populations ---\n\n    print(\"--- The Setup ---\")\n    print(f\"Critical Level (c): {critical_level}\")\n    print(f\"High Welfare level (h): {high_welfare}\")\n    print(f\"Low Positive Welfare level (w): {low_positive_welfare} (note: w > 0, but w < c)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Population A: One person with very high welfare\n    print(\"Population A: One person with high welfare.\")\n    value_A = critical_level_value(high_welfare)\n    print(f\"The value equation is: h - c\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {high_welfare} - {critical_level} = {value_A}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Population B: Many people with low, positive welfare\n    print(f\"Population B: {large_number_of_people:,} people with low positive welfare.\")\n    # First, calculate the value contributed by a single person in this population.\n    value_per_person_B = critical_level_value(low_positive_welfare)\n    print(f\"The value equation for each person is: w - c\")\n    print(f\"The final equation for each person is: {low_positive_welfare} - {critical_level} = {value_per_person_B}\")\n\n    # Now, calculate the total value of Population B.\n    total_value_B = large_number_of_people * value_per_person_B\n    print(f\"The total value equation for Population B is: number_of_people * (w - c)\")\n    print(f\"The final equation for total value is: {large_number_of_people} * ({low_positive_welfare} - {critical_level}) = {total_value_B}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # --- Step 4: Conclusion ---\n    print(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"Non-Elitism requires that for some large number of people, Population B should be better than Population A.\")\n    print(f\"Is Population B's value ({total_value_B}) greater than Population A's value ({value_A})?\")\n    print(f\"Result: {total_value_B > value_A}\")\n    print(\"\\nBecause the welfare of people in Population B is below the critical level, each person adds negative value.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, adding more people only makes the total value worse.
