    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to derive the expression for the grand canonical partition function using path integrals.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Start with the Definition:** I will begin with the standard statistical mechanics definition of the grand canonical partition function, `Z`, which involves the trace of an operator containing the Hamiltonian `H`, the number operator `N`, the chemical potential `μ`, and the inverse temperature `β`. The operator is `exp(-β(H - μN))`.\n\n2.  **Introduce the Path Integral:** I will explain how this trace can be represented as a path integral. This involves breaking the imaginary time interval `β` into many small slices and inserting complete sets of states, which in the continuum limit becomes an integral over all possible field configurations `φ` in spacetime.\n\n3.  **Relate to the Canonical Ensemble:** I will first state the well-known path integral expression for the canonical partition function (where `μ=0`), which is `Z_C = ∫ D[φ] exp(-S_E[φ])`. Here, `S_E[φ]` is the Euclidean action corresponding to the Hamiltonian `H`.\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Chemical Potential:** I will then show how introducing the chemical potential term (`-μN`) modifies the Hamiltonian. This change carries through to the Euclidean action. The new effective Hamiltonian `H' = H - μN` leads to a new effective Euclidean action `S'_E`.\n\n5.  **Derive the Final Formula:** I will derive the expression for this new action `S'_E` in terms of the original action `S_E` and the number operator `N`. This will result in the final formula for the grand canonical partition function `Z`.\n\n6.  **Code the Output:** Finally, I will write a Python script that prints out the derived formula in a clear and readable format, ensuring all symbols and the numbers in the integration limits (`0` and `β`) are explicitly shown.\n\nHere is the Python code that formats and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script will derive and print the formula for the grand canonical partition function Z\n# using the path integral formalism.\n\n# --- Define the symbols used in the formula as string variables for clarity ---\n\n# Z: The Grand Canonical Partition Function\nZ = \"Z\"\n\n# ∫ D[φ]: The path integral over all field configurations φ\npath_integral_symbol = \"∫ D[φ]\"\n\n# exp(...): The exponential function\nexponential_function = \"exp\"\n\n# S_E[φ]: The Euclidean action for the system with Hamiltonian H\neuclidean_action = \"S_E[φ]\"\n\n# μ: The chemical potential\nchemical_potential = \"μ\"\n\n# ∫[0 to β] dτ: Integral over imaginary time τ from 0 to β\nimaginary_time_integral = f\"∫[0 to {chr(946)}] dτ\" # chr(946) is the unicode for beta (β)\n\n# N[φ]: The number operator as a functional of the fields φ\nnumber_operator = \"N[φ]\"\n\n# --- Construct the terms inside the exponential ---\n# The term originating from the Euclidean action\naction_term = f\"-{euclidean_action}\"\n\n# The term originating from the chemical potential coupling to the number operator\n# This includes the numbers 0 and β as the integration limits.\nchemical_potential_term = f\"{chemical_potential} {imaginary_time_integral} {number_operator}\"\n\n# Combine the terms for the full expression in the exponent\nexponent_expression = f\"({action_term} + {chemical_potential_term})\"\n\n# --- Assemble the final equation ---\nfinal_equation = f\"{Z} = {path_integral_symbol} {exponential_function}{exponent_expression}\"\n\n# --- Print the explanation and the final formula ---\nprint(\"The grand canonical partition function (Z) is derived from the canonical one by replacing the Hamiltonian H with H' = H - μN.\")\nprint(\"This modifies the Euclidean action S_E in the path integral exponent.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe original Euclidean action is:\")\nprint(f\"  {euclidean_action} = ∫[0 to {chr(946)}] dτ L_E   (where L_E is the Euclidean Lagrangian)\")\nprint(\"\\nThe new effective action becomes:\")\nprint(f\"  S'_E = {euclidean_action} - {chemical_potential} {imaginary_time_integral} {number_operator}\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting this into the path integral Z = ∫ D[φ] exp(-S'_E) gives the final result:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\nprint(\"Final Formula:\")\nprint(final_equation)\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\n```\n<<<Z = ∫ D[φ] exp(-S_E[φ] + μ ∫[0 to β] dτ N[φ])>>>"
