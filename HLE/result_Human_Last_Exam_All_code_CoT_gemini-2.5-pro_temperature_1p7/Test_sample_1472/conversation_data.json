    "To determine the symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper, we need to analyze its 3D structure and the symmetry elements it possesses. The following Python script systematically walks through the decision-making process used in molecular symmetry analysis to arrive at the correct point group.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Components:** Break down the name to understand the central atom (Copper) and the ligand structure (2,5-dithiahexane).\n2.  **Determine Likely Geometries:** Based on the metal and the two bidentate ligands, consider the most probable coordination geometries (tetrahedral or square planar).\n3.  **Apply Symmetry Flowchart:** Systematically check for the presence of key symmetry elements:\n    *   High-symmetry groups (like Td, Oh)\n    *   A principal axis of rotation (Cn)\n    *   Perpendicular C2 axes\n    *   Mirror planes (horizontal or vertical)\n    *   An inversion center (i)\n4.  **Synthesize Findings:** Combine the presence or absence of these symmetry elements to assign the final point group. The script will print out each logical step.\n\n```python\ndef find_point_group_of_complex():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper by systematically\n    analyzing its structure and symmetry elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Determining the point group for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the molecular structure\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the molecular structure.\")\n    print(\"Molecule: bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper, or [Cu(CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3)2]\")\n    print(\"Central atom: Copper (Cu)\")\n    print(\"Ligand: 2,5-dithiahexane.
