    "Of course. The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts is not a single fixed number, as it heavily depends on the synthesis method, reaction conditions (temperature, pressure), and the specific performance metric being optimized (e.g., activity, stability, selectivity).\n\nHowever, based on numerous scientific studies, a consensus has emerged. A low Ni loading is generally preferred to ensure high dispersion of Ni nanoparticles and prevent sintering (clumping) at high temperatures, which deactivates the catalyst. The ceria (CeOâ‚‚) is not just a passive support but actively participates in the reaction through its oxygen storage capacity.\n\nAn optimal **atomic ratio of Ni/Ce is frequently found to be in the range of 0.1 to 0.2**. This provides a high density of active Ni sites at the interface with the ceria support, maximizing the synergistic effect.\n\nHere is a Python script that takes a commonly cited optimal atomic ratio within this range (0.15) and calculates the corresponding weight percentage of Ni. This is a practical calculation needed when preparing the catalyst in a lab.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_catalyst_composition():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the weight percentage of Ni in a Ni-Ceria catalyst\n    for a given optimal atomic ratio based on scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define Constants ---\n    # Atomic masses (g/mol) are fundamental constants for this calculation.\n    ATOMIC_MASS_NI = 58.69\n    ATOMIC_MASS_CE = 140.12\n\n    # From literature, a highly effective atomic ratio (Ni/Ce) is around 0.15.\n    # This value represents a balance between active sites and catalyst stability.\n    optimal_atomic_ratio_ni_ce = 0.15\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Optimal Ni/Ce Ratio in Ni-Ceria Catalysts ---\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe target optimal atomic ratio (Ni atoms / Ce atoms) is: {optimal_atomic_ratio_ni_ce}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Mass Components based on the Atomic Ratio ---\n    # To convert an atomic ratio to a weight ratio, we imagine having a certain number of atoms.\n    # Let's assume we have 1 mole of Cerium (Ce) atoms.\n    moles_ce = 1.0\n    # Based on the ratio, the moles of Nickel (Ni) would be:\n    moles_ni = moles_ce * optimal_atomic_ratio_ni_ce\n\n    # Now, calculate the mass of each component for these mole amounts.\n    # Mass = moles * atomic mass\n    mass_ni = moles_ni * ATOMIC_MASS_NI\n    mass_ce = moles_ce * ATOMIC_MASS_CE\n    \n    print(\"--- Equation for Mass Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Based on a composition of {moles_ni:.2f} moles of Ni and {moles_ce:.1f} mole of Ce:\")\n    print(f\"Mass of Ni = {moles_ni:.2f} * {ATOMIC_MASS_NI} = {mass_ni:.2f} g\")\n    print(f\"Mass of Ce = {moles_ce:.1f} * {ATOMIC_MASS_CE} = {mass_ce:.2f} g\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Total Mass and Final Weight Percentage ---\n    # The weight percentage (wt%) of Ni is a common way to describe catalyst composition in practice.\n    # wt% Ni = (mass of Ni / (mass of Ni + mass of Ce)) * 100\n    total_mass = mass_ni + mass_ce\n    weight_percent_ni = (mass_ni / total_mass) * 100\n\n    print(\"--- Final Equation for Ni Weight Percentage (wt%) ---\")\n    print(f\"Total Mass = {mass_ni:.2f} (Mass Ni) + {mass_ce:.2f} (Mass Ce) = {total_mass:.2f} g\")\n    print(f\"Ni wt% = ({mass_ni:.2f} / {total_mass:.2f}) * 100 = {weight_percent_ni:.2f} %\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Conclusion: An optimal atomic Ni/Ce ratio of {optimal_atomic_ratio_ni_ce} corresponds to roughly {weight_percent_ni:.2f} wt% Nickel in the catalyst.\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_catalyst_composition()\n```\n<<<0.15>>>"
