    "This is a \"mate in X\" chess puzzle. To solve it, I need to find the shortest forced checkmate sequence for White, assuming Black plays the best defensive moves.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position (FEN: `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`):**\n    *   **White's key pieces:** Queen on d5, Knight on e5, Bishop on h5. These pieces are creating strong pressure on Black's kingside, particularly on the f7 and g7 squares.\n    *   **Black's key pieces:** Rook on e1, Queen on g5. The rook on e1 puts White's King in jeopardy by pinning the White f1-Rook to the King. The Queen on g5 threatens `...Qxg2#`.\n    *   **The core problem for White:** The Rook on f1 is pinned and cannot move, which severely limits White's defensive and attacking options. White's own king is in a precarious situation. White must act decisively.\n\n2.  **Finding the key move:**\n    *   Standard attacking moves like `1. Qxf7+` or `1. Ng6+` seem promising but ultimately fail because the White Rook on f1 remains pinned, and Black can create counter-threats that are too strong.\n    *   The solution must address the pin directly. The brilliant, counter-intuitive move is a queen sacrifice: `1. Qxe1!`.\n    *   By capturing the threatening rook on e1, White sacrifices their most powerful piece, but crucially, this unpins the Rook on f1, freeing it to join the attack. Black is forced to recapture with `1... Rxe1`, or else be down a Queen for a Rook with no compensation.\n\n3.  **Calculating the forced mate sequence:**\n    After `1. Qxe1 Rxe1`, the attack proceeds with a series of forced checks. Black can choose to move the king to h8 or h7, but both paths lead to a mate in the same number of moves. Here is the main line:\n\n    *   `1. Qxe1 Rxe1`\n    *   `2. Bxf7+` (Check. Forces the king to move.) `... Kh8` (If Black plays `2... Kh7`, the mate follows a similar path: `3. Nf7+ Kg6 4. Ne5++ Kh7 5. Bg6#`)\n    *   `3. Nf7+` (Check.) `... Kg8` (Forced.)\n    *   `4. Nh6++` (A beautiful double check from the Knight and Bishop. The King must move.) `... Kh8` (The only legal move.)\n    *   `5. Rf8#` (Checkmate. The now-unpinned Rook delivers the final blow.)\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    White forces checkmate in 5 moves.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the solution to the chess puzzle.\n    \"\"\"\n    winning_line = [\n        \"1.
