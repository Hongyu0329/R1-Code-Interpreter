1.  The Berkovich projective line over the field Cp, denoted P^1_Berk, contains four types of points:
    - Type 1: The classical points, corresponding to points in C_p U {infinity}.
    - Type 2: Points corresponding to closed disks D(a, r) with radius r in the value group |C_p^x|_p = p^Q (r > 0).
    - Type 3: Points corresponding to closed disks D(a, r) with radius r in R_{>0} but not in p^Q.
    - Type 4: Points corresponding to nested sequences of disks with an empty intersection.

2.  The problem describes a space built from C_p^x x C_p. The points (z0, z) in this space correspond to the points z/z0 in the classical affine line A^1(C_p) = C_p.

3.  The equivalence relation given is a standard construction in Berkovich geometry. The resulting quotient space is known to be isomorphic to the Berkovich affine line minus its classical points. This space is written as A^1_Berk \\ C_p.

4.  The space A^1_Berk consists of all points in P^1_Berk except for the point at infinity. Its type 1 points are precisely the points of C_p.

5.  Therefore, the subset A^1_Berk \\ C_p consists of all points in the affine Berkovich line that are not of type 1. This means the subset includes all points of type 2, type 3, and type 4.
