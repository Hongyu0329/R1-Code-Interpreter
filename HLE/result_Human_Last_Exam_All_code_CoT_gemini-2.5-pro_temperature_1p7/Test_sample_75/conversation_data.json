    "Here is the plan to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore:\n1.  Establish the start and end years of the conflict based on the official game lore. The war begins with the events of *Wings of Liberty* in 2504. It concludes with the final defeat of Amon in the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue, which takes place in 2508.\n2.  Calculate the difference between the end year and the start year to find the total duration.\n3.  Use Python's `math.ceil()` function to round the result up, as requested, even though the result will be a whole number.\n4.  Print the entire calculation process and the final result clearly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore begins with the events of Wings of Liberty\n# and concludes with the epilogue of Legacy of the Void.\nstart_year = 2504\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration in years\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The request is to round up the result.\n# math.ceil() is used to round a number up to the nearest integer.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\nprint(\"The Second Great War began in {} and concluded in {}.\".format(start_year, end_year))\nprint(\"Calculating the duration: {} - {} = {} years.\".format(end_year, start_year, duration))\nprint(\"Rounding up, the war lasted for a total of {} years.\".format(final_duration))\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
