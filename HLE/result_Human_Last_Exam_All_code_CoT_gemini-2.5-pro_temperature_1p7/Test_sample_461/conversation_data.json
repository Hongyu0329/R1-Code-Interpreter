    "The polycyclic hydrocarbon you're referring to is **Dinosaurane**. It is a chemical fossil, or biomarker, found in crude oil and ancient rock sediments. It is a type of sterane, a saturated polycyclic hydrocarbon, and its presence in geological samples is often associated with the Mesozoic Era, the age of dinosaurs.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the molar mass of Dinosaurane based on its chemical formula, C₂₉H₅₂. The code breaks down the calculation step-by-step and prints the final equation and result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_molar_mass():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molar mass of the polycyclic hydrocarbon Dinosaurane (C29H52).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define atomic masses (g/mol)\n    atomic_mass_carbon = 12.011\n    atomic_mass_hydrogen = 1.008\n\n    # Define the number of atoms in Dinosaurane (C29H52)\n    num_carbon = 29\n    num_hydrogen = 52\n\n    # Calculate the molar mass\n    molar_mass = (num_carbon * atomic_mass_carbon) + (num_hydrogen * atomic_mass_hydrogen)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the full calculation equation\n    print(\"The chemical formula for Dinosaurane is C29H52.\")\n    print(\"To find its molar mass, we sum the masses of its constituent atoms.\")\n    print(f\"Molar Mass = (Carbon Atoms * Carbon Mass) + (Hydrogen Atoms * Hydrogen Mass)\")\n    # The final print statement includes each number used in the calculation, as requested.\n    print(f\"Molar Mass = ({num_carbon} * {atomic_mass_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen} * {atomic_mass_hydrogen}) = {molar_mass:.4f} g/mol\")\n\ncalculate_molar_mass()\n```\n<<<Dinosaurane>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
