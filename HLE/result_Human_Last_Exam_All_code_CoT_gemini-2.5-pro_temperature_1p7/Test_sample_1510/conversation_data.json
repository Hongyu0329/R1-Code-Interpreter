    "To find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Point Groups of Order 2:** First, we need to know which of the crystallographic point groups have an order of 2 (meaning they contain two symmetry operations). The two point groups that fit this criterion are:\n    *   **C₂:** The cyclic group of order 2, which contains an identity operation and one 2-fold rotation (180°).\n    *   **D₁:** The dihedral group of order 2, which contains an identity operation and one mirror reflection. (This is mathematically isomorphic to C₂).\n\n2.  **List Wallpaper Groups for Each Point Group:** Next, we need to list the wallpaper groups that correspond to each of these point groups.\n    *   For point group **C₂**, there is 1 wallpaper group: `p2`.\n    *   For point group **D₁**, there are 3 wallpaper groups: `pm`, `pg`, and `cm`.\n\n3.  **Sum the Counts:** Finally, we add the number of groups from each category to get the total.\n\nThe following Python code automates this process. It categorizes the 17 wallpaper groups by their point group, filters for those with a point group of order 2, prints the matching groups, and then calculates the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each wallpaper group to its point group and the order of that point group.\n    wallpaper_groups_info = {\n        'p1': ('C1', 1),\n        'p2': ('C2', 2),\n        'pm': ('D1', 2),\n        'pg': ('D1', 2),\n        'cm': ('D1', 2),\n        'p2mm': ('D2', 4),\n        'p2mg': ('D2', 4),\n        'p2gg': ('D2', 4),\n        'c2mm': ('D2', 4),\n        'p3': ('C3', 3),\n        'p3m1': ('D3', 6),\n        'p31m': ('D3', 6),\n        'p4': ('C4', 4),\n        'p4mm': ('D4', 8),\n        'p4gm': ('D4', 8),\n        'p6': ('C6', 6),\n        'p6mm': ('D6', 12)\n    }\n\n    groups_with_c2 = []\n    groups_with_d1 = []\n\n    # Iterate through the groups and categorize them\n    for group, (point_group, order) in wallpaper_groups_info.items():\n        if order == 2:\n            if point_group == 'C2':\n                groups_with_c2.append(group)\n            elif point_group == 'D1':\n                groups_with_d1.append(group)\n\n    num_c2 = len(groups_with_c2)\n    num_d1 = len(groups_with_d1)\n    total_count = num_c2 + num_d1\n    \n    print(f\"Wallpaper groups with point group C2 (order 2): {', '.join(groups_with_c2)}\")\n    print(f\"Number of C2 groups: {num_c2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Wallpaper groups with point group D1 (order 2): {', '.join(groups_with_d1)}\")\n    print(f\"Number of D1 groups: {num_d1}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The total number of wallpaper groups with point group of order 2 is calculated by summing the counts from each type.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {num_c2} (from C2) + {num_d1} (from D1) = {total_count}\")\n\ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
