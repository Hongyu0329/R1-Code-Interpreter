    "Answering this question requires combining a principle from algebraic geometry with a combinatorial enumeration problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Translate the Algebraic Geometry Problem:** The condition that a curve's Jacobian has \"good reduction\" is a strong constraint on its stable reduction. Specifically, it implies that the special fiber of the stable model must be a curve of \"compact type\". A curve of compact type is one whose dual graph is a tree. The dual graph has a vertex for each irreducible component of the curve and an edge for each node connecting two components.\n2.  **Use the Genus Formula:** For a stable curve of compact type, its arithmetic genus `g` is simply the sum of the genera of its irreducible components, `g = Σgᵢ`. In our case, `g=4`.\n3.  **Incorporate the Stability Condition:** For a stable curve, any irreducible component with genus `gᵢ=0` (a rational curve) must have at least 3 special points (nodes in this case). In the dual graph, this means any vertex corresponding to a `g=0` component must have a degree of at least 3.\n4.  **Define a \"Type\":** A \"type\" of stable reduction is determined by the combinatorial structure of the special fiber. This consists of the multiset of genera of the components `{g₁, g₂, ...}` and the isomorphism class of the dual tree, with vertices \"weighted\" by their corresponding genera.\n5.  **Enumerate the Types:** The task is now a combinatorial one: find all non-isomorphic weighted trees that satisfy the conditions.\n    *   The sum of the weights (genera) must be 4.\n    *   Any vertex with weight 0 must have a degree of at least 3.\n6.  **Code the Enumeration:** I will write a Python script that walks through this enumeration case by case, explaining the logic for each partition of the number 4, and summing up the resulting types.\n\nThe following Python script implements this step-by-step enumeration and prints the final count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve\n    with a good reduction Jacobian.\n\n    This is equivalent to counting the number of non-isomorphic \"stable curves of compact type\"\n    of genus 4. A stable curve is of \"compact type\" if its dual graph (components as vertices,\n    nodes as edges) is a tree.\n\n    Key conditions for a type:\n    1. The sum of the genera of its irreducible components must be 4 (g_1 + ... + g_c = 4).\n    2. Any component with genus 0 must connect to at least 3 other components (i.e., its vertex\n       in the dual graph must have degree >= 3).\n\n    A \"type\" is a non-isomorphic tree with vertices weighted by component genera that meets these conditions.\n    The script enumerates these types based on the possible partitions of the genus 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_types = 0\n    print(\"Calculating the number of types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve with good reduction Jacobian.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to counting non-isomorphic weighted trees representing stable curves of compact type.\\n\")\n\n    # Cases with no genus 0 components\n    # ---------------------------------\n    # For these cases, any tree structure is valid.
