# This part of the code simulates the thought process for naming the final product.
# The chemical reaction is a thermal sulfoxide elimination followed by a Claisen rearrangement.
# The final product has the structure: OHC-CH2-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

# Deconstructing the IUPAC name of the final product:
# The principal functional group is an aldehyde (-CHO), so its carbon is C1 and the suffix is "-al".
# The longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde and the double bond is 6 carbons long.
parent_chain_length = 6

# The double bond starts at carbon 4.
double_bond_position = 4
unsaturation_suffix = "en"

# There is a methyl group substituent at carbon 5.
substituent_position = 5
substituent_name = "methyl"

# Assemble the final IUPAC name from its components.
