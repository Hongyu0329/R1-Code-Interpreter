# Based on the derivation, the infimum is found when the constant C=1.
# The expression for the infimum is: C * pi / ((pi + 1) * log(pi + 1))
C = 1
pi = math.pi

# Calculate the value of the expression
result = (C * pi) / ((pi + 1) * math.log(pi + 1))

# The problem requires outputting the numbers in the final equation.
# The equation is: (1 * pi) / ((pi + 1) * log(pi + 1))
