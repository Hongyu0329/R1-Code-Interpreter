    "Here is a plan to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n1.  **Identify the main allotropes of phosphorus:** Research and list the known stable or well-characterized allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  **Determine the color of each allotrope:** For each allotrope identified, find its characteristic color.\n3.  **Count the unique colors:** Tally the distinct colors from the list. Note that some allotropes might have variations in color (e.g., pure white phosphorus turning yellow), but these can be grouped into a single primary color category.\n4.  **Construct the code:** Write a Python script that:\n    *   Stores the allotropes and their colors in a data structure (like a dictionary).\n    *   Prints each allotrope and its color.\n    *   Calculates the total number of unique colors.\n    *   Displays the final count as a simple addition equation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the unique colors of phosphorus allotropes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping phosphorus allotropes to their observed colors.\n    # White phosphorus is often considered white/yellow.\n    # Violet phosphorus is also known as Hittorf's phosphorus.\n    # Blue phosphorus is a more recently discovered 2D allotrope.\n    allotropes = {\n        \"White (or Yellow) Phosphorus\": \"white\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"black\",\n        \"Blue Phosphorus\": \"blue\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The primary colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    \n    # Extract the unique colors\n    colors = list(allotropes.values())\n    \n    # Print each color found\n    for color in colors:\n        print(f\"- {color.capitalize()}\")\n\n    # Build the equation string as requested\n    num_colors = len(colors)\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * num_colors\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"\\nCounting each unique color gives the equation:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
