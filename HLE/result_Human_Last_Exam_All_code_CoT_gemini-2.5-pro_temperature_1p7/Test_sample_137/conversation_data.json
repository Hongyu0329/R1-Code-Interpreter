    "To solve this problem, we will calculate the Hurwitz number using a formula from the representation theory of the symmetric group. This formula counts connected, ramified covers of the sphere by the sphere ($\\mathbb{P}^1 \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$).\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the parameters:** The degree of the cover is $d=7$. There are $k=4$ branch points with ramification profiles given by the partitions $\\mu_1=(4,3)$, $\\mu_2=(5,2)$, $\\mu_3=(2,1^5)$, and $\\mu_4=(2,1^5)$.\n2.  **Use the Hurwitz Number Formula:** The formula for the genus-0 connected Hurwitz number $H_0$ is:\n    $H_0 = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^k |C_{\\mu_i}|}{d!} \\sum_{\\chi} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^k \\chi(\\mu_i)}{(\\deg \\chi)^{k-2}}$\n    where the sum is over all irreducible characters $\\chi$ of the symmetric group $S_d$.\n    *   $|C_{\\mu_i}|$ is the size of the conjugacy class in $S_d$ corresponding to the partition $\\mu_i$.\n    *   $\\chi(\\mu_i)$ is the value of the character $\\chi$ on that conjugacy class.\n    *   $\\deg \\chi$ is the degree of the character $\\chi$.\n3.  **Utilize Python for Calculation:** We will use the `sympy` library in Python, which has built-in capabilities to handle the symmetric group, its conjugacy classes, and its character table.\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   Instantiate the symmetric group $S_7$.\n    *   For each ramification profile (partition), determine the size of its conjugacy class.\n    *   Obtain the character table of $S_7$.\n    *   Iterate through each irreducible character $\\chi$ (each row of the table) and compute the corresponding term in the sum: `(χ(μ₁) * χ(μ₂) * χ(μ₃) * χ(μ₄)) / (deg χ)²`.\n    *   Sum up these terms. For precision, we will use `sympy.Rational` for all calculations.\n    *   Multiply the sum by the pre-factor `(|C(μ₁)| * |C(μ₂)| * |C(μ₃)| * |C(μ₄)|) / 7!`.\n5.  **Present the Final Result:** The final output will show the values of the components in the formula and the resulting Hurwitz number.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import Rational\nfrom math import factorial\n\ndef solve_hurwitz_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hurwitz number for a ramified cover of P^1 by P^1\n    with degree 7 and four specified ramification profiles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
