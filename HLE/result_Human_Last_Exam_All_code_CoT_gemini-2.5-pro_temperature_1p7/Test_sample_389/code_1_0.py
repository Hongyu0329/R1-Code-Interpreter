        "3. These two Ajnas (tetrachords) are very closely related. They share the first three notes (D, E-quarter-flat, F).",
        "4. The only difference is the fourth note: G in Bayati and Gb in Saba.",
        "5. In a traditional taqsim (improvisation), this slight change—lowering the G to Gb—is a classic and very common way to introduce melodic and emotional color.",
        "6. This is often described as 'Bayati showing the character of Saba'.",
        "7. The other options represent modulations that are far less common, and in many cases, would sound quite unusual or jarring from a Bayati base.",
        f"8. Therefore, the most common modulation listed is to Jins Saba on D."
