    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), is called the **dynamic structure factor**, denoted as S(k, ω).\n\nIn nuclear reactor physics and criticality analysis, this function describes the spectrum of neutron density fluctuations in both space (via wave number k) and time (via frequency ω). A common theoretical model for S(k, ω) in a subcritical system is derived from the one-group neutron diffusion equation, which gives the following relationship:\n\nS(k, ω) ∝ 1 / [ (α + Dk²)² + ω² ]\n\nwhere:\n*   **α** is the prompt neutron decay constant (Rossi-alpha), which depends on the system's reactivity.\n*   **D** is the neutron diffusion coefficient.\n*   **k** is the wave number, the Fourier variable conjugate to space.\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency, the Fourier variable conjugate to time.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the denominator of this expression for a set of typical parameters for a subcritical nuclear assembly. It demonstrates how the system parameters and the transform variables (k and ω) combine to determine the value of the dynamic structure factor.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_dynamic_structure_factor_denominator():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the denominator of the dynamic structure factor S(k, ω)\n    for a given set of nuclear parameters and transform variables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- System Parameters for a hypothetical subcritical system ---\n\n    # Reactivity (ρ), a measure of criticality.
