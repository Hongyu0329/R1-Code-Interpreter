    """
    Identifies and reports the erroneous line numbers in the triangle.py file.
    The analysis is based on the file being a standard Python module imported into Sage,
    where the Sage preparser is not active.

    The erroneous lines are:
    - 1: Incorrect import location for `sqrt`.
    - 11: Use of `^` for exponentiation; in Python this is bitwise XOR.
    - 18: Use of `/` for division, which results in floating-point numbers, violating the "precise arithmetic" requirement.
    - 22: Same floating-point division error as line 18.
    - 23: Same floating-point division error as line 18.
    - 29: Use of `^` on a Sage object; this attempts `__xor__` and would raise a TypeError.
    - 30: Same `TypeError` as line 29.
    - 31: Same `TypeError` as line 29.
