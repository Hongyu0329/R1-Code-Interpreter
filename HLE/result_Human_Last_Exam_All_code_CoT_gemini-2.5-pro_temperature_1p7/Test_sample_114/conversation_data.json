    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this Chaucer puzzle.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I need to get the full text of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Book of the Duchess\". I will retrieve it from a reliable public domain source like Project Gutenberg.\n2.  The question asks which word Chaucer does *not* make a rhyme with in the poem. The most definitive way to prove a word isn't rhymed is to show that the word doesn't appear in the text at all. If the word isn't present, it's impossible for it to be part of a rhyme.\n3.  I will write a Python script that downloads the text of the poem.\n4.  The script will then systematically search for each word from the answer choices: \"Wente\", \"Here\", \"Fool\", \"Hool\", and \"Countour\".\n5.  To ensure accuracy, I will search for the words as whole words (e.g., matching \"here\" but not \"t**here**fore\").\n6.  The script will print whether each word was found in the poem.\n7.  The word that is not found in the text is the correct answer, as Chaucer could not have used a word he didn't write.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport requests\n\ndef find_unrhymed_chaucer_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds which word from a given list does not appear in\n    Chaucer's \"The Book of the Duchess\", and therefore cannot be rhymed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Fetch the text of \"The Book of the Duchess\".\n    # We will use the Project Gutenberg plain text file.\n    url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2245/pg2245.txt\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # This will raise an error for a bad response\n        full_text = response.text\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Could not retrieve the poem from the internet. Error: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # 2. Isolate just the text of \"The Book of the Duchess\" from the file.\n    # The file contains multiple works. We'll find the start and end markers.\n    try:\n        start_marker = \"THE BOOK OF THE DUCHESS\"\n        end_marker = \"Explicit the Boke of the Duchesse.\"\n        start_index = full_text.index(start_marker)\n        end_index = full_text.index(end_marker, start_index)\n        poem_text = full_text[start_index:end_index]\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Could not isolate 'The Book of the Duchess' from the text file.\")\n        print(\"Analysis will run on the full downloaded text, which might be less accurate.\")\n        poem_text = full_text\n    \n    # Use a lowercase version for case-insensitive search\n    poem_text_lower = poem_text.lower()\n\n    # 3. Define the words to check from the answer choices.\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'wente',\n        'B': 'here',\n        'C': 'fool',\n        'D': 'hool',\n        'E': 'countour'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Checking for the presence of each word in 'The Book of the Duchess'...\\n\")\n    \n    not_found_choice = None\n\n    # 4. Search for each word in the text.\n    for key, word in choices.items():\n        # We use \\b for word boundaries to match the whole word only.\n        pattern = r'\\b' + re.escape(word) + r'\\b'\n        if re.search(pattern, poem_text_lower):\n            print(f\"Result for '{word}' (Choice {key}): Found in the text.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Result for '{word}' (Choice {key}): NOT found in the text.\")\n            not_found_choice = key\n    \n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    if not_found_choice:\n        print(f\"Conclusion: The word '{choices[not_found_choice]}' (Choice {not_found_choice}) does not appear in the poem.\")\n        print(\"Therefore, Chaucer could not have made a rhyme with it.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Conclusion: All words were found.
