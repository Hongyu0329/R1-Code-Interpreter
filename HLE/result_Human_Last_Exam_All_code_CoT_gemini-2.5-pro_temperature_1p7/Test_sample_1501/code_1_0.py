    # Part (a) reasoning:
    # An element (x, i) in Q x {0, 1} can form pairs with (v-1) other elements (y, i)
    # and v other elements (y, 1-i). The number v-1 in the question points to
    # ND-pairs being pairs of the form {(x, i), (y, i)}.

    # Part (b) reasoning:
    # In an SQS(v), a pair's multiplicity is mu = (v-2)/2.
    # In an SQS(2v), a pair's multiplicity is lambda' = (2*v - 2) / 2 = v - 1.
    # We need to express (v-1) in terms of mu.
    # From mu = (v-2)/2, we get v = 2*mu + 2.
    # So, v - 1 = (2*mu + 2) - 1 = 2*mu + 1.
    # The question asks for the expression and to output each number in the equation.
    # The final equation is: multiplicity = 2 * mu + 1

    # Part (c) reasoning:
    # The multiplicity of any pair (including ND-pairs) in the SQS(2v) is v-1.

    # Therefore, no pair can have multiplicity v.
