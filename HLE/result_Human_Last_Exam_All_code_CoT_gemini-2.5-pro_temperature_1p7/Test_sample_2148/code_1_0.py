# This script calculates (X1*X2)^-1 based on the provided physics problem.
# It uses the symbolic results derived from the problem's equations.

# Define the values of X1 and X2 in their symbolic (string) form for printing.
# Based on the derivation, for c_V=c_A=1/2:
# X1 = sqrt(2)/3
# X2 = 1/(24*sqrt(2)*pi)
X1_symbolic = "sqrt(2)/3"
X2_symbolic = "1/(24*sqrt(2)*pi)"

# The symbolic calculation for the product and its inverse:
# X1 * X2 = (sqrt(2)/3) * (1/(24*sqrt(2)*pi)) = 1 / (3 * 24 * pi) = 1/(72*pi)
# (X1 * X2)^-1 = 72*pi
final_symbolic_result = "72*pi"

# Calculate the final numerical result using the math library.
final_numerical_result = 72 * math.pi

# Print the final results, showing each component of the equation as requested.
