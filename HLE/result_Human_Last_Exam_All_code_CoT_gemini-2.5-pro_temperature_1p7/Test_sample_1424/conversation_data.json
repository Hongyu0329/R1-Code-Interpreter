    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single particle in a system without any interactions. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is fundamental to many-body theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **State the Relationship:** I will first state the mathematical formula that defines the relationship between the bare Green's function $G_0$ and the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  **Explain the Components:** I will break down the formula and explain each term ($\\omega$, $\\epsilon_k$, $\\mu$, and the infinitesimal $i\\delta$) to provide physical context.\n3.  **Provide a Concrete Example:** I will write a Python script that calculates the value of $G_0$ for a specific set of parameters. This script will demonstrate the relationship by taking user-defined inputs for the particle's frequency ($\\omega$) and energy ($\\epsilon_k$) and then printing the full equation with these values substituted in, along with the final result.\n\n### Explanation of the Relationship\n\nThe bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum space, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is given by the following expression:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nHere is a breakdown of the terms:\n*   **$G_0(k, \\omega)$**: The bare Green's function for a particle with momentum `k` and frequency `ω`.\n*   **$\\omega$**: The frequency (often interpreted as the energy) of the propagating particle being described.\n*   **$\\epsilon_k$**: This is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with quantum number `k` (e.g., momentum). This is the key term you asked about. The formula shows that $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between `ω` and `ϵ_k`. The poles of the Green's function (where the denominator approaches zero) occur when $\\omega \\approx \\epsilon_k$, indicating that the excitations of the non-interacting system are precisely the single particles with energies $\\epsilon_k$.\n*   **$\\mu$**: The chemical potential, which determines the Fermi energy at zero temperature. It acts as the threshold separating occupied states ($\\epsilon_k < \\mu$) from unoccupied states ($\\epsilon_k > \\mu$).\n*   **$i\\delta$**: An infinitesimal imaginary term ($i$ is the imaginary unit and $\\delta$ is a small positive real number). This term is crucial for enforcing causality. Its sign is determined by the `sgn` function, ensuring that particles (in unoccupied states) propagate forward in time, while holes (in occupied states) propagate backward in time.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates how to calculate the bare Green's function for a given set of physical parameters. It specifically prints out the final equation with all the numbers substituted, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, mu=0.0, delta=1e-6):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0(k, omega).\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float): The frequency of the particle.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        mu (float): The chemical potential.\n        delta (float): A small positive infinitesimal.\n\n    Returns:\n        complex: The value of the bare Green's function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Determine the sign of the imaginary part based on the position relative to the chemical potential\n    sign = np.sign(epsilon_k - mu)\n    \n    # Handle the case where epsilon_k is exactly at the chemical potential\n    if sign == 0:\n        sign = 1 # Conventionally, states at the chemical potential are treated as unoccupied\n\n    # The denominator of the Green's function\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * delta * sign\n\n    # The Green's function is the inverse of the denominator\n    G0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    return G0, sign\n\n# --- Example Calculation ---\n# You can change these values to see how the result changes.\n# This example considers a particle in an unoccupied state (epsilon_k > mu).\nomega_val = 2.5  # Energy/frequency of the propagator\nepsilon_k_val = 2.0  # Energy of the single-particle state\nmu_val = 1.0     # Chemical potential (Fermi level)\ndelta_val = 1e-6 # Small infinitesimal for causality\n\n# Perform the calculation\nG0_result, sign_val = calculate_bare_greens_function(omega_val, epsilon_k_val, mu_val, delta_val)\n\n# --- Print the results ---\nprint(\"--- Bare Green's Function Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"Inputs:\")\nprint(f\"  Particle Frequency (ω): {omega_val}\")\nprint(f\"  Single-Particle Energy (ϵ_k): {epsilon_k_val}\")\nprint(f\"  Chemical Potential (μ): {mu_val}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\nprint(\"Formula:\")\nif sign_val > 0:\n    print(\"  G_0 = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)\")\n    sign_str = '+'\nelse:\n    print(\"  G_0 = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k - iδ)\")\n    sign_str = '-'\n\nprint(\"\\nCalculation with substituted values:\")\n# Print the final equation with the numbers filled in\nimaginary_part_str = f\"i*{delta_val}\"\nif sign_val < 0:\n    imaginary_part_str = f\"-i*{delta_val}\"\n    \nprint(f\"  G_0 = 1 / ({omega_val} - {epsilon_k_val} {sign_str} {imaginary_part_str})\")\nprint(f\"  G_0 = 1 / ({(omega_val - epsilon_k_val)} + {1j*delta_val*sign_val})\")\n\n\nprint(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\nprint(f\"  G_0(k, ω) = {G0_result}\")\n\n```\n<<<G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}>>>"
