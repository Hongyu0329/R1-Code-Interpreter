    "This is a factual question about the plot of a novel. A direct computation is not possible. I will provide a Python script that stores the answer in a variable and prints it to the console, fulfilling your request for a code-based solution.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" which is Adam Zamoyski.\n2.  Recall or look up the name of the character he marries or forms a marriage-like bond with. This character is Angelika, an *inkub* (a type of artificial being).\n3.  Create a Python script that assigns this name to a variable.\n4.  Print the variable to the console in a human-readable sentence.\n\n```python\n# This script answers the question about Jacek Dukaj's novel.\n\n# The name of the character that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries.\ncharacter_name = \"Angelika\"\n\nprint(f\"In Jacek Dukaj's 'Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość', the main character marries a being named: {character_name}\")\n```\n<<<Angelika>>>"
