    "To find the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (Γ), we can classify the subgroups based on their structure. The number of subgroups of a given index in a group can be determined by analyzing its homomorphisms onto transitive permutation groups of that degree. For index 4, the relevant permutation group is the symmetric group S₄.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Any subgroup H of index 4 in Γ determines a homomorphism φ: Γ → S₄ whose image is a transitive subgroup. Since Γ is a 2-group (every element has order a power of 2), its homomorphic images must also be 2-groups. The transitive 2-subgroups of S₄ are the Klein four-group V₄ (isomorphic to C₂ × C₂) and the dihedral group D₄ (of order 8).\n2.  We can partition the subgroups of index 4 into two types:\n    a. Normal subgroups H, for which Γ/H is a group of order 4. This must be V₄.\n    b. Non-normal subgroups H. For these, Γ/Core(H) is isomorphic to D₄, where Core(H) is the largest normal subgroup of Γ contained in H.\n3.  **Count the normal subgroups:** The number of normal subgroups H with Γ/H ≅ V₄ is determined by the number of surjective homomorphisms (epimorphisms) from Γ to V₄. Since V₄ is abelian, these homomorphisms factor through the abelianization of Γ, which is Γ_ab ≅ C₂ × C₂ × C₂. We will calculate the number of these subgroups.\n4.  **Count the non-normal subgroups:** These arise from quotients isomorphic to D₄. For each normal subgroup N with Γ/N ≅ D₄, we can find corresponding subgroups of index 4 in Γ by taking preimages of the index 4 subgroups of D₄. A D₄ group has 4 non-normal subgroups of index 4. It is a known (but non-trivial) result from the study of the Grigorchuk group that there are exactly 6 such distinct normal subgroups N with Γ/N ≅ D₄.\n5.  **Sum the counts:** The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the number of normal subgroups and the number of non-normal subgroups.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport itertools\n\ndef calculate_and_print_subgroup_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Calculate the number of normal subgroups of index 4.\n    # These correspond to epimorphisms from Gamma to V4 = C2 x C2.\n    # Since V4 is abelian, this is equivalent to counting epimorphisms from\n    # the abelianization of Gamma, Gamma_ab = C2 x C2 x C2, to V4.\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the number of normal subgroups of index 4.\")\n    \n    # An epimorphism phi: C2^3 -> C2^2 is a linear map of vector spaces over F_2.\n    # A map is defined by the images of the 3 basis vectors of C2^3.\n    # Each can map to any of the 4 elements of C2^2.
