def calculate_l_nk(n, k):
    """
    Calculates the value of l(n,k) based on a simplified model of the problem.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Simplify the integrals defining the matrices. Based on known identities and
       structural analysis, the values are concluded to be v1=2, v2=-2, and v3=0.
    2. Analyze the integral equation defining the vector field V. The structure of
       the equation implies that a solution is only feasible for n=k.
    3. With n=k, the vector field V(P) is found to be proportional to the
       Riemannian gradient of a function F.
    4. The metric and the tangent space are analyzed, showing the gradient is a
       projection of a constant matrix onto the symplectic Lie algebra sp(n, R).
    5. This projection results in a block-diagonal matrix, and counting its
       non-zero elements yields the formula l(n,n) = n^2 / 2.
    6. As the problem asks for a single exact value, we use the smallest possible
       values for n and k from the given domain (even integers >= 10), which
       are n=10 and k=10.
