    "To solve this problem, we need to find the natural density of primes $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is irreducible modulo $p$.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ that act as a single cycle on the 7 roots of the polynomial. In other words, we need to find the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in $G$ to the total number of elements in $G$.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Since $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (which can be proven, for instance, by observing it is irreducible modulo 13 as we'll see below), its Galois group $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_7$.\n2.  We will constrain the possibilities for $G$ by examining the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo several small primes. By a theorem of Dedekind, the cycle structure of the permutation corresponding to the Frobenius element at $p$ (for unramified primes $p$) is given by the degrees of the irreducible factors of $f(x) \\pmod p$.\n3.  We will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform this factorization.\n4.  Once we have a small set of candidate groups for $G$, we will compute the proportion of 7-cycles for each candidate.\n5.  If the proportion is the same for all candidates, we will have our answer.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan. It will factor the polynomial for several primes and then print the deduction and the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.polys.domains import FF\nfrom sympy.polys.polytools import factor_list, Poly\n\ndef analyze_polynomial_mod_p():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the factorization of f(x) mod p for various primes to deduce properties of its Galois group.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    f = x**7 - 14*x**5 + 56*x**3 - 56*x + 22\n\n    print(\"Analyzing factorization of f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 mod p:\")\n    \n    primes_to_check = [3, 5, 11, 13]\n    for p in primes_to_check:\n        poly_mod_p = Poly(f, x, domain=FF(p))\n        try:\n            factors = factor_list(poly_mod_p)[1] # Get the list of (poly, power)\n            degrees = sorted([poly.degree() for poly, power in factors for _ in range(power)])\n            print(f\"p={p}: f(x) factors into irreducible polynomials of degrees {degrees}.
