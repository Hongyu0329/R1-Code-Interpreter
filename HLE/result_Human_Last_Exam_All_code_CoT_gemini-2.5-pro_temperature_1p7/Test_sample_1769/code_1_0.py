    print("   - The Old English vowel combination 'eo' (pronounced /eo/) typically simplified to 'e' (/ɛ/) in Middle English. For example, 'heorte' became 'herte' (heart).")
    print("   - The unstressed ending '-or' commonly reduced to '-er', a pattern seen in words like 'modor' becoming 'mother' and 'fæder' becoming 'father'.")
