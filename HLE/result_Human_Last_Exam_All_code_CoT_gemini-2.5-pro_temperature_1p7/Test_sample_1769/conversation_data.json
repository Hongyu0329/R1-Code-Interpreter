    "Of course, here is the explanation and the resulting word presented in a Python script.\n\nMy plan is to trace the linguistic path of the original, native English word for \"sister\" to its hypothetical modern-day equivalent, had it not been replaced by a word from another language.\n\n1.  **Identify the Source of \"Sister\"**: The current word \"sister\" is not originally English. It is a loanword from the Old Norse \"systir,\" which became common due to the Viking invasions and settlement in England.\n2.  **Find the Native Old English Word**: Before the Norse influence, the word used by the Anglo-Saxons for \"sister\" was \"sweoster.\"\n3.  **Trace Linguistic Evolution**: I will apply the known sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English to the word \"sweoster.\" For example, the Old English vowel cluster \"eo\" typically simplified to \"e\" (as in *heorte* -> heart), and unstressed word endings like \"-or\" often reduced to \"-er\" (as in *modor* -> mother).\n4.  **Determine the Modern Form**: By applying these changes, \"sweoster\" would have naturally evolved into a different Modern English word.\n\nThis script will now print out this line of reasoning to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and determines what the modern English word for 'sister'\n    would be without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Thinking Process:\")\n    print(\"1. The modern English word 'sister' originates from the Old Norse word 'systir'. This word was adopted into English during the period of Norse invasions and settlement (Danelaw) between the 8th and 11th centuries.\")\n    print(\"\\n2. The native Old English word that 'sister' replaced was 'sweoster'.\")\n    print(\"\\n3. To find its hypothetical modern form, we trace the likely linguistic evolution of 'sweoster':\")\n    print(\"   - The Old English vowel combination 'eo' (pronounced /eo/) typically simplified to 'e' (/ɛ/) in Middle English. For example, 'heorte' became 'herte' (heart).\")\n    print(\"   - The unstressed ending '-or' commonly reduced to '-er', a pattern seen in words like 'modor' becoming 'mother' and 'fæder' becoming 'father'.\")\n    print(\"\\n4. Applying these changes, Old English 'sweoster' would have become Middle English 'swester'. This word did exist in some dialects but was ultimately displaced by 'sister'.\")\n    print(\"\\n5. If it had survived and followed a regular path into Modern English, it would have retained this form, similar to its German cognate, 'Schwester'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Conclusion: Had the Norse never influenced the English language in this way, the Modern English word derived from the original Old English 'sweoster' would be:\")\n    print(\"\\nswester\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<swester>>>"
