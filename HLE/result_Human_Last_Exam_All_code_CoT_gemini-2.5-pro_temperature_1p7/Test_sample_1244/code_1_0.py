    # Part (a)
    # A theorem states that the rank of an even unimodular lattice must be a multiple of 8.
    # The given rank is 12, which is not a multiple of 8.
    # 12 % 8 = 4
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b)
    # An indefinite integral quadratic form in n >= 5 variables represents all integers.
    # A unimodular lattice of rank 14 is indefinite. Thus, it contains a vector x with x.x = 6.
    # We check if this vector is 3-primitive, i.e., x/3 is not in the lattice L.
    # If y = x/3 were in L, its norm y.y would be (x.x)/9 = 6/9 = 2/3.
    # This is not an integer, but norms in an integral lattice must be integers.
    # This is a contradiction, so x must be 3-primitive.
    answer_b = "yes"

    # Part (c)
    # The Niemeier lattice L with root system D_24 is a 2-neighbor of Z^24.
    # This is because L intersects Z^24 at D_24, which has an index of 2 in both L and Z^24.
    # [Z^24 : D_24] = 2
    # [L : D_24] = 2
    # This implies far(L) <= 2.
    # far(L) = 1 if and only if L is isometric to Z^24.
    # The minimum norm of L is 2 (from its roots), while the minimum norm of Z^24 is 1.
    # Since they have different minimum norms, they are not isometric, so far(L) is not 1.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible value for the farness d is 2.
    answer_c = 2

    print(f"(a) Is it true that an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can have farness exactly 2?")
    print(f"The rank of an even unimodular lattice must be a multiple of 8. Since 12 is not a multiple of 8, no such lattice exists.")

    print(f"(b) Suppose L is an odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 with far(L) = 3. Can L have a vector x such that x.x is a multiple of 6 and x is a 3-primitive vector?")
    print(f"An indefinite lattice of rank n>=5 represents all integers. A rank 14 unimodular lattice is indefinite. So there is an x in L where x.x = 6.")
    print(f"If x were not 3-primitive, then y=x/3 would be in L, and its norm would be y.y = (x.x)/9 = 6/9 = 2/3. This is not an integer, which is a contradiction.")

    print(f"(c) If an even unimodular lattice L in R^24 has a visible root system of type D_24, what is the smallest d for which L can be a d-neighbor of Z^24?")
    print(f"The lattice L is a 2-neighbor of Z^24. This implies d<=2.")
    print(f"The minimum norm of L is 2, while for Z^24 it's 1, so L is not isometric to Z^24, hence d is not 1.")
    print(f"The smallest d is therefore 2.")
