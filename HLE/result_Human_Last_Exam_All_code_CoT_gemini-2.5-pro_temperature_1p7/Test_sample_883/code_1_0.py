    print(f"With CaCl2, kcat remains {kcat_ca}/second, showing no effect.")
    print(f"With CuCl2, kcat decreases from {kcat_control} to {kcat_cu}/second, indicating Cu2+ is an inhibitor.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the role of Al1 and Al2
    print("\n2. Analysis of Al1 and Al2:")
    print(f"With Al1, kcat increases from {kcat_control} to {kcat_al1}/second. Al1 is a strong activator, likely an allosteric modulator.")
    print(f"With Al2, kcat decreases from {kcat_control} to {kcat_al2}/second. Al2 is an inhibitor, likely an allosteric modulator.")
    print(f"With both Al1 and Al2, the kcat is {kcat_al1_al2}/second, which is the same as with Al2 alone.")
    print("This result, along with the fact that Al1 and Al2 have identical Kd values (2nM), strongly suggests they compete for the same binding site on the enzyme Zma1.")

    # Step 3: Analyze the role of XAG1
    print("\n3. Analysis of XAG1:")
    print(f"With XAG1, kcat drops from {kcat_control} to {kcat_xag1}/second, so it is a potent inhibitor.")
    print(f"When high concentrations of substrate (molecule A) are added with XAG1, the kcat is restored from {kcat_xag1} to {kcat_xag1_high_A}/second, which is near the control level.")
    print("This rescue of activity by adding more substrate is the classic behavior of a competitive, reversible inhibitor.")

    # Step 4: Analyze the role of Rga1
    print("\n4. Analysis of Rga1:")
    print(f"With Rga1, kcat drops from {kcat_control} to {kcat_rga1}/second, so it is also a potent inhibitor.")
    print(f"When high concentrations of substrate are added with Rga1, the kcat remains at {kcat_rga1_high_A}/second.")
    print("The inability of excess substrate to rescue enzyme activity is characteristic of an irreversible inhibitor or a non-competitive reversible inhibitor. 'Irreversible inhibitor' is a strong explanation for this observation.")
    
    # Step 5: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis
    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Based on the analysis:")
    print("- Al1 and Al2 are allosteric modulators that bind to the same site.")
    print("- Rga1's inhibition cannot be overcome by substrate, which is consistent with irreversible inhibition.")
    print("- XAG1 is a reversible competitive inhibitor, not irreversible.")
    print("- Mg2+ is a cofactor, but CaCl2 is not.")
    print("\nEvaluating the choices, option C is the most accurate and complete description of the results.")
    print("C. Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators for Zma1. Al1 and Al2 bind to the same site on Zma1. Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor.")
