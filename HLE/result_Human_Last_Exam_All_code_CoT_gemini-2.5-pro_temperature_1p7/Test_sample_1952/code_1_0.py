    This function solves the set theory problem and prints the result.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of max({lambda, mu}) \ lambda.
    Our analysis shows this value is mu, under the condition that mu > lambda.
    The task is to find the maximum possible value of mu.

    - mu = max(kappa^+, 2^kappa)
    - The supremum of mu over all consistent models of set theory is 2^(kappa^+).

    We formulate the result as a final equation and print the numbers involved
    as requested by the prompt.
