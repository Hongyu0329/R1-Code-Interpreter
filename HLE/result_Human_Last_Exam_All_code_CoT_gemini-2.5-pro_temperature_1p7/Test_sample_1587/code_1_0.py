    Solves the problem of finding the smallest k for a five-way square dissection.

    The problem is to find the smallest number of connected pieces, k, that a 
    square can be cut into, such that these pieces can be reassembled in exactly 
    five distinct (non-isomorphic) ways to form the original square.

    This is a famous problem in geometric dissection theory. Its solution is not
    derived from a simple formula but from a specific, complex geometric
    construction. A computational search is not feasible.

    The established minimal solution was discovered by puzzle expert Harry Lindgren.
