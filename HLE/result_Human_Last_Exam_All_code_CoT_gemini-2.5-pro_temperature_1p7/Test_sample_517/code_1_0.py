# The problem asks for the limit of a probability p_n related to a specific random walk.
# Our step-by-step derivation concluded that p_n = 1 for all relevant n.

# Step 1: Define the process and state space
# The process is a simple random walk on the 2D grid, conditioned to never visit the origin.
# The state space S is the set of all points on the grid except the origin, i.e., S = Z^2 \ {0}.

# Step 2: State the key property of the process
# It is a known result in probability theory that this specific conditioned random walk is recurrent
# on the state space S. For an irreducible process, recurrence on S implies that for any
# starting state x in S and any target state y in S, the walk starting at x will
# visit y with probability 1.

# Step 3: Apply this property to the problem at hand
# The walk starts at x = (0,1). This point is in S.
# The probability p_n is the probability of eventually hitting the set B_n,
# where B_n is a disk of radius n^(1/3) centered at (n,0).

# For any integer n >= 1, the point y = (n,0) is in the state space S.
# The point y = (n,0) is also in the set B_n, since the distance from (n,0) to the center
# of B_n is 0, which is less than n^(1/3).

# Step 4: Formulate the probability inequality
# The probability of hitting the set B_n must be at least the probability of hitting
# the single point (n,0) contained within B_n.
# So, p_n >= P(walk starting at (0,1) eventually visits (n,0)).

# From the recurrence property in Step 2, we know this probability is 1.
# P(walk starting at (0,1) eventually visits (n,0)) = 1.

# Therefore, p_n >= 1.

# Step 5: Conclude the value of p_n
# Since p_n is a probability, it cannot be greater than 1.
# This forces p_n to be exactly 1 for all n >= 1.

# Step 6: Calculate the final limit
# We need to find the limit of p_n as n approaches infinity.
# lim_{n->inf} p_n = lim_{n->inf} 1

final_answer = 1

# Final equation is: lim (p_n) = 1
# The number in the equation is 1.
