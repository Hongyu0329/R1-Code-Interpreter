def solve_graph_orientation():
    """
    This function explains the logical steps to determine the valid orientation
    number of the graph H and prints the resulting number.

    The valid orientation number is the smallest maximum indegree (k)
    among all valid orientations. A valid orientation requires adjacent
    vertices to have different indegrees.

    Argument steps:
    1. A lower bound is established for k. The indegrees of the four central
       vertices (v1, v2, v3, v4) must be distinct. It can be shown that
       none of these indegrees can be 1, 2, or 3. One can be 0.
       Therefore, the four indegrees must be chosen from {0, 4, 5, 6, ...}.
       This implies the maximum indegree must be at least 6. So, k >= 6.

    2. An orientation is constructed that achieves k = 6. This shows k <= 6.
       - The central K4 is oriented to give indegrees (p_i) of {0, 1, 2, 3}.
       - The edges to peripheral K3s are oriented to create contributions (n_i)
         to the central indegrees.
       - Target central indegrees (d_i = p_i + n_i) are set to {0, 4, 5, 6}.
