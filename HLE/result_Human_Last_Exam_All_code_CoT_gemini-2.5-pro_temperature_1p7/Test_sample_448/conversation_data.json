    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the rarest noble gas and present the information.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  I will first identify all the noble gases.\n2.  I will research the abundance of each noble gas on Earth. The primary source for these gases in a comparable state is the atmosphere.\n3.  I will note a special case for Radon (Rn). Radon is a noble gas, but it is highly radioactive and has a very short half-life. It is constantly decaying, which means that at any given moment, its total quantity on Earth is extremely small, making it the rarest noble gas.\n4.  For comparison, I will also find the rarest *stable* noble gas, which is Xenon (Xe), and present its abundance in parts per million (ppm).\n5.  I will write a Python script that explains these facts and converts the abundance of Xenon from ppm to a percentage to illustrate the scarcity. The script will clearly state Radon is the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the rarest noble gas on Earth and provides context\n    by showing the abundance of the rarest stable noble gas, Xenon.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The noble gases are Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon.\n    # Radon (Rn) is radioactive with a short half-life (3.8 days for its most stable isotope).\n    # It is continuously produced by the decay of uranium in the Earth's crust,\n    # but it decays so quickly that its overall abundance at any moment is extremely low.\n    # This makes Radon the rarest of all noble gases on Earth.\n    \n    rarest_gas = \"Radon (Rn)\"\n    \n    # For context, we can look at the rarest STABLE noble gas, which is Xenon (Xe).\n    # Its atmospheric abundance provides a stable, measurable value for scarcity.\n    xenon_abundance_ppm = 0.087  # parts per million\n    \n    # Convert Xenon's ppm to a percentage to show the final number.\n    # percentage = ppm / 1,000,000 * 100 which is ppm / 10,000\n    xenon_abundance_percentage = xenon_abundance_ppm / 10000\n    \n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {rarest_gas}.\")\n    print(\"Due to its high radioactivity and very short half-life, its atmospheric concentration is infinitesimally small.\")\n    print(\"\\nFor comparison, the rarest STABLE noble gas is Xenon (Xe).\")\n    print(f\"Its abundance in the atmosphere is approximately {xenon_abundance_ppm} parts per million.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the equation to convert Xenon's abundance to a percentage of the atmosphere:\")\n    # The prompt requests each number in the final equation be printed.\n    print(f\"{xenon_abundance_ppm} ppm / 10000 = {xenon_abundance_percentage:.7f}%\")\n\nfind_rarest_noble_gas()\n\n<<<Radon>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
