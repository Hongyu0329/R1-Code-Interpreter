# Step 1: Define m, the number of stable equilibrium points.
# Based on the analysis of the differential equation x'(t) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x,
# we found one stable equilibrium point at x=0. So, m = 1.
m = 1

# Step 2: Define the other numbers in the expression to be calculated.
base = 2
exponent = 4048

# Step 3: Calculate the final result.
# Python can handle very large integers automatically.
result = m - base**exponent

# Step 4: Print the equation with all the numbers and the final answer.
print(f"The number of stable equilibrium points is m = {m}")
print(f"The expression to calculate is: m - {base}^{exponent}")
print(f"Plugging in the values, we get: {m} - {base}^{exponent}")
print("The final result is:")
print(result)
