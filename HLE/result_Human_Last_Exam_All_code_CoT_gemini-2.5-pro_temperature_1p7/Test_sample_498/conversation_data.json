    "The user wants me to find the next letter in the sequence `ZXXCVYBN_`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the sequence:** The letters `Z, X, C, V, B, N` are all present and largely in order, which strongly suggests the pattern is related to the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard (`ZXCVBNM`).\n2.  **Identify the Pattern:** The sequence `ZXXCVYBN` does not perfectly match the keyboard row. There are extra letters (`X`, `Y`). This suggests there might be more than one pattern at play. A common technique for such puzzles is to look for interleaved sequences.\n    *   Sequence A (odd positions): `Z, X, V, B, _`\n    *   Sequence B (even positions): `X, C, Y, N`\n3.  **Solve for Sequence A:** Let's focus on Sequence A, as the blank is in its position.\n    *   The letters `Z, X, V, B` are all on the QWERTY bottom row.\n    *   Keyboard Row: `Z X C V B N M`\n    *   The pattern appears to be: take the first two letters (`Z`, `X`), skip the next letter (`C`), take the next two letters (`V`, `B`).\n    *   Following this \"take two, skip one\" pattern, the next step would be to skip the next letter (`N`).\n    *   After skipping `N`, the next letter to take would be `M`.\n4.  **Codify the Logic:** I will write a Python script to formalize this logic. The script will:\n    *   Define the keyboard bottom row.\n    *   Extract the relevant interleaved sequence (`Z, X, V, B`).\n    *   Demonstrate the \"take two, skip one\" pattern by finding the position (index) of the letters.\n    *   Calculate the index of the next letter based on the pattern and reveal the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the letter sequence puzzle by identifying an interleaved pattern\n    related to the QWERTY keyboard layout.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n    keyboard_bottom_row = \"ZXCVBNM\"\n    \n    # The sequence provided in the puzzle.\n    puzzle_sequence = \"ZXXCVYBN\"\n\n    # The puzzle can be solved by analyzing the letters at odd positions (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.).\n    # This forms an interleaved sequence.\n    # Python slicing `[::2]` extracts elements from the start to the end with a step of 2.\n    interleaved_sequence = puzzle_sequence[::2]\n\n    print(f\"The original sequence is: {''.join(list(puzzle_sequence))}\")\n    print(f\"We can find a pattern in the interleaved sequence: {', '.join(list(interleaved_sequence))}, _\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"This pattern is based on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard.\")\n    print(f\"Keyboard Row: {', '.join(list(keyboard_bottom_row))}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe pattern is 'take two letters, skip one letter'.\")\n    print(\"1.
