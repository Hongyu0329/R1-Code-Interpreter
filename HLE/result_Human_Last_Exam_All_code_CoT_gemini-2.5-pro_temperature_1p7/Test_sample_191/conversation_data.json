    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the protein and provide the answer in the requested format.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Question:** The user is asking to identify a specific protein involved in a biological process. The key features are: the protein is \"broken down,\" and this event allows macrophages to \"engulf\" amyloid material. This points to an immune system pathway.\n2.  **Identify the Biological Pathway:** The process described is \"opsonization,\" where a target (amyloid) is tagged by an immune molecule to mark it for destruction by a phagocytic cell (macrophage or, in the brain, microglia). The primary system responsible for this in the innate immune response is the complement system.\n3.  **Identify the Key Protein:** The central protein in the complement cascade is **Complement component 3 (C3)**. This protein is proteolytically cleaved, or \"broken down,\" into smaller, active fragments.\n4.  **Identify the Active Fragment:** When C3 is broken down, it produces fragments C3a and C3b. The **C3b** fragment is the one that physically binds to the surface of targets like amyloid plaques, acting as the \"tag\" for engulfment.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will create a Python script that stores the name of the protein and its key fragment in variables. The script will then print a clear, descriptive sentence that answers the user's question, incorporating the names of the protein and its components.\n6.  **Provide the Final Answer:** After the code block, I will provide the name of the protein in the requested `<<<answer>>>` format.\n\n```python\ndef identify_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and describes the protein that, upon breakdown,\n    facilitates the macrophage engulfment of amyloid plaques.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The central protein in the complement cascade responsible for tagging targets.\n    main_protein = \"Complement component 3\"\n    protein_abbreviation = \"C3\"\n\n    # The active fragment produced when the main protein is broken down.\n    # This fragment acts as the \"tag\" for engulfment.\n    active_fragment = \"C3b\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a clear, step-by-step sentence.\n    print(f\"The protein that is broken down to facilitate amyloid engulfment is {main_protein} (often abbreviated as {protein_abbreviation}).\")\n    print(f\"When {protein_abbreviation} is cleaved, it produces the active fragment {active_fragment}, which tags the amyloid for destruction by macrophages.\")\n\nidentify_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment()\n```\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
