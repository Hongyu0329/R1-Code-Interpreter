    This function formats and prints the solution to the Hopf algebra problem.
    
    The solutions are derived as follows:
    (a) The claim is not true in general. A counterexample can be built with q=1 and a trivial g-action,
        which satisfies the premises but fails a reasonable interpretation of "symmetric" for j=3.
    (b) For q=-1, the q-binomial coefficient (2,1) becomes 0. The expression for x^2 a . 1_R simplifies to
        (x . 1_R)^2 (a . 1_R) - (g^2 a . 1_R) (x . 1_R)^2. Assuming the condition g . 1_R = 0 implies
        (g^k h . 1_R) = 0 for k>=1 and any h in H, the second term vanishes.
    (c) Using the same assumption from (b), the terms for k=1, 2, 3 in the summation vanish because they
        all contain a factor of (g^k a . 1_R). Only the k=0 term remains.
