    # 1. State the energy inequality
    # From standard PDE analysis (using energy methods with Holder and Gagliardo-Nirenberg
    # inequalities), one can derive the following inequality for E(t) = ||∇u(t)||^2:
    #
    # dE/dt <= K * E^3 / (1+t)^3
    #
    # where K is a positive constant. Blow-up occurs if E(t) goes to infinity
    # in finite time. We analyze the corresponding ODE to see if this is possible.
