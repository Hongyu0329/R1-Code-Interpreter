    This function provides the answer to the user's question about the 2D Navier-Stokes equation.
    The answer is based on established mathematical theorems.
    """
    answer_and_explanation = """
    The question is whether a smooth, divergence-free, and periodic initial data u_0 can lead to a finite-time blow-up for the solution u of the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation.

    The definitive answer to this question is: No.

    For the Navier-Stokes equation in two spatial dimensions (T^2), it is a well-established mathematical theorem that for any smooth initial data (like the one described), there exists a unique smooth solution that is defined for all time t >= 0. This property is known as "global regularity" or "global well-posedness".

    This means that finite-time blow-up is impossible in the 2D case. The solution will remain smooth and bounded forever. The mathematical reason for this is related to the control one has over the vorticity of the fluid in 2D, which prevents the nonlinear term (u ⋅ ∇u) from becoming pathologically large.

    It is important to note that this is in stark contrast to the three-dimensional case. The question of whether blow-up can occur for the 3D Navier-Stokes equation is a major unsolved problem in mathematics and is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems.

    The final governing equations with all their terms are:
    Equation 1: ∂_t u + u⋅∇u = Δu - ∇p
    Equation 2: ∇⋅u = 0
