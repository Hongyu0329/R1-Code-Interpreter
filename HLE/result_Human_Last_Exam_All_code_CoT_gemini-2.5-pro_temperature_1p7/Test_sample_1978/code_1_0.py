# --- Main analysis and calculation ---

# 1. Determine the dimension of the system, n.
# The state vector is given as x(t) = (x1(t), ..., x2024(t)).
# This implies the system has 2024 components.
n = 2024

# 2. Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions, k.
# The given conditions are:
# (1) x1(T) - x1(0) = 0
# (2) x2(T) - x2(0) = 0
# (3) 5*x2(T) - 5*x2(0) = 0
# (4) 100*x2(T) - 100*x2(0) = 0
# (5) 1000*x2(0) - 1000*x2(T) = 0
# (6) 100*x2024(T) - 100*x2024(0) = 0
# Conditions (2), (3), (4), and (5) are all linearly dependent,
# as they represent the same constraint: x2(T) = x2(0).
# The independent constraints apply to components x1, x2, and x2024.
# Therefore, the number of linearly independent conditions is 3.
k = 3

# 3. Calculate the index of the boundary-value problem.
# The index is defined as n - k.
index = n - k

# 4. Print the final result including the equation.
