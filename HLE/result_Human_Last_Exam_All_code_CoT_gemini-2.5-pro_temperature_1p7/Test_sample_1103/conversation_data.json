    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of specific integer solutions to a problem in algebraic number theory. The \"Gauss class number problem\" broadly refers to classifying quadratic imaginary fields by their class number. A negative fundamental discriminant `d` corresponds to such a field `Q(âˆšd)`. We are looking for the count of these discriminants `d < 0` for which the class number `h(d)` is exactly 48.\n\nThis problem has been solved computationally by number theorists. The definitive lists for class numbers up to 100 were published by M. Watkins. Based on these established results, the answer is known.\n\nHowever, we can write a script to verify this result. We will use the `cypari2` Python library, which provides access to the powerful PARI/GP computer algebra system specialized for number theory.\n\nHere is the plan for the script:\n1.  Import the necessary `cypari` object from the `cypari2` library.\n2.  Initialize a counter to zero. This counter will store the number of discriminants we find.\n3.  We need to iterate through negative integers and check their properties. We need an upper bound for our search. From Watkins's tables, we know the largest discriminant (in absolute value) with class number 48 is `-405283`. To be safe, we will search up to `-410000`.\n4.  For each integer `D` in our range:\n    a. Check if `D` is a fundamental discriminant using PARI/GP's `isfundamental` function.\n    b. If it is, calculate its class number using `quadclassunit(D)[0]`.\n    c. If the calculated class number is 48, we increment our counter.\n5.  Finally, after the loop finishes, we print the total count.\n\nThis script requires the `cypari2` library to be installed (`pip install cypari2`).\n\n```python\nimport cypari2\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_class_number_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of negative fundamental discriminants with a given class number.\n\n    This function iterates through negative integers up to a reasonable search bound,\n    checks if each is a fundamental discriminant, computes its class number, and\n    counts how many have a class number of 48.\n\n    NOTE: This computation can be slow and may take a few minutes to complete.\n    The cypari2 library is required (pip install cypari2).\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        pari = cypari2.Pari()\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"Error: The 'cypari2' library is not installed.\")\n        print(\"Please install it using: pip install cypari2\")\n        return\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred while initializing PARI/GP: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    target_class_number = 48\n    count = 0\n    # Based on Watkins' tables, the largest absolute value of a discriminant\n    # for h=48 is 405283. We search a little beyond that to be safe.\n    search_limit = 410000\n    \n    print(f\"Searching for negative fundamental discriminants with class number {target_class_number}...\")\n    print(f\"Search range is from D = -1 to D = -{search_limit}.\")\n\n    for D in range(-search_limit, 0):\n        # isfundamental() checks if D is a fundamental discriminant.\n        if pari.isfundamental(D):\n            # quadclassunit(D)[0] returns the class number of the quadratic field Q(sqrt(D)).\n            # The full output is [h, U, R] where h=class no, U=fundamental unit, R=regulator.\n            class_no = pari.quadclassunit(D)[0]\n            if class_no == target_class_number:\n                count += 1\n                # Optional: print progress\n                # sys.stdout.write(f\"\\rFound {count} discriminants so far...
