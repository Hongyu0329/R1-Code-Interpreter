    Explains the reasoning for classifying the conceptual metaphor
    in "my love for humanity".
    """
    explanation = """
1. The phrase "my love for humanity" discusses the abstract concept of "love". In theories of conceptual metaphor, we understand abstract ideas by mapping them onto more concrete experiences.

2. In this phrase, "love" is treated as a discrete substance or object. The word "my" implies it is something that can be possessed, and "for humanity" implies it can be directed.

3. The act of viewing an abstract concept (like an emotion) as a physical object or substance is known as an **ontological metaphor**. This allows us to talk about it, quantify it, and see it as a cause. For example, we can have "a lot of love" or "give our love". This is the most precise classification.

4. However, "ontological metaphor" is not one of the provided options. We must select the best fit from the list. Let's analyze the options:
   - A. Conceptual metaphor: Too general; it's the name of the entire phenomenon.
   - C. Orientational metaphor: Incorrect; this relates to spatial orientations like up/down (e.g., 'feeling up').
   - D. Structural metaphor: This is the best fit. A structural metaphor occurs when one concept is structured in terms of another. Here, the abstract concept of LOVE is being structured in terms of a POSSESSABLE OBJECT/SUBSTANCE. This framework allows us to understand that love can be held, directed, and quantified, thereby giving it structure. Ontological metaphors are often the foundation for more elaborate structural ones.

5. Therefore, among the given choices, "Structural metaphor" is the most fitting answer because the phrase is part of a system that structures our understanding of love.
