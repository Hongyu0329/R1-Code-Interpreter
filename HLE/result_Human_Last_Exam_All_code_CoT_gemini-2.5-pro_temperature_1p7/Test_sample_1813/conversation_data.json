    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the rational number p/q**: We are given the rational number \\(4/7\\).\n2.  **Find the continued fraction of 4/7**: I'll use the Euclidean algorithm to find the integer coefficients \\(a_i\\) of the continued fraction for \\(4/7 = [a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_n]\\).\n3.  **Construct the characteristic matrix K**: For a rational number with continued fraction coefficients \\([a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n]\\), the associated matrix is \\(K = M(a_0) M(a_1) \\cdots M(a_n)\\), where \\(M(a) = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n4.  **Calculate the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\)**: This number is given by the formula \\(m_{p/q} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\text{tr}(K)^2 - 4\\det(K)}}{q}\\). Since \\(\\det(K) = (-1)^{n+1}\\), this simplifies the calculation. The result is a quadratic irrational number.\n5.  **Compute the continued fraction of \\(m_{4/7}\\)**: Since \\(m_{4/7}\\) is a quadratic irrational, its continued fraction is periodic. I will use the standard algorithm for finding the continued fraction of numbers of the form \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{D}+P}{Q}\\). This involves an iterative process that will eventually reveal a repeating cycle of coefficients.\n6.  **Present the result**: I will print the final continued fraction in standard notation, showing the non-repeating part and the repeating period, e.g., \\([c_0; c_1, \\dots, \\overline{p_1, \\dots, p_l}]\\).\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the Python code below.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_markov_cf():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{4/7}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the rational number\n    p_rat, q_rat = 4, 7\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the continued fraction of p/q\n    def get_rational_cf(p, q):\n        coeffs = []\n        temp_p, temp_q = p, q\n        while temp_q != 0:\n            a = temp_p // temp_q\n            coeffs.append(a)\n            temp_p, temp_q = temp_q, temp_p % temp_q\n        return coeffs\n\n    cf_rat = get_rational_cf(p_rat, q_rat)\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the matrix K\n    def multiply_matrices(A, B):\n        C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n        C[0][0] = A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0]\n        C[0][1] = A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]\n        C[1][0] = A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0]\n        C[1][1] = A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]\n        return C\n\n    M = lambda a: [[a, 1], [1, 0]]\n    K = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Start with identity matrix\n    for a in cf_rat:\n        K = multiply_matrices(K, M(a))\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the value of the generalized Markov number m_{4/7}\n    trace_K = K[0][0] + K[1][1]\n    det_K = K[0][0] * K[1][1] - K[0][1] * K[1][0]\n    D_m = trace_K**2 - 4 * det_K\n\n    # Step 5: Compute the continued fraction for m_{4/7} = sqrt(D_m)/q_rat\n    # To use the integer algorithm, we express m as (sqrt(D_m*q_rat^2) + 0) / q_rat^2\n    D = D_m * q_rat**2\n    P = 0\n    Q = q_rat**2\n\n    coeffs_m = []\n    history = {}  # Store (P, Q) states to detect the cycle\n\n    # Loop to find the coefficients and the period\n    for i in range(50):  # Safety limit\n        state = (P, Q)\n        if state in history:\n            pre_period_start_index = history[state]\n            pre_period = coeffs_m[:pre_period_start_index]\n            period = coeffs_m[pre_period_start_index:]\n            break\n        history[state] = i\n        \n        a = int((math.sqrt(D) + P) / Q)\n        coeffs_m.append(a)\n        \n        P_next = a * Q - P\n        Q_next = (D - P_next**2) // Q\n        \n        P, Q = P_next, Q_next\n    else: # Should not be reached for quadratic irrationals\n        pre_period = coeffs_m\n        period = []\n\n    # Step 6: Format and print the final result in a human-readable equation.\n    print(f\"The continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{p_rat}/{q_rat} is:\")\n    \n    # Construct the output string\n    output_str = f\"m_{p_rat}/{q_rat} = [{pre_period[0]};\"\n\n    # Add non-repeating part (if any)\n    if len(pre_period) > 1:\n        output_str += \" \" + \", \".join(map(str, pre_period[1:]))\n        if period:\n            output_str += \",\"\n    \n    # Add repeating part using overline notation\n    if period:\n        output_str += \" \" + \"overline(\" + \", \".join(map(str, period)) + \")\"\n\n    output_str += \"]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    compute_markov_cf()\n```\n<<<'[0; 1, overline(4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 2)]'>>>"
