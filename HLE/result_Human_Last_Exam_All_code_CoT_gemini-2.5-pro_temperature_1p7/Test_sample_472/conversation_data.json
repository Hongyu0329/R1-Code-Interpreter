    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to scan the provided Latin line:\n\n1.  **Identify the Meter:** The line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" is from the Roman playwright Plautus. His works commonly use meters based on dialogue, such as the Iambic Septenarius, which consists of seven iambic (S L) feet, often with substitutions. The line's length after accounting for elision fits this meter.\n2.  **Syllabification and Elision:** I will first break the line into syllables. A key rule of Latin poetry, elision, occurs when a word ending in a vowel is followed by a word beginning with a vowel. Here, `bene esse` will elide to `ben'esse`.\n3.  **Determine Syllable Weight:** I will determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on the rules of Latin prosody:\n    *   A syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel or diphthong.\n    *   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants.\n    *   Otherwise, a syllable is generally short.\n4.  **Group into Feet:** Based on the Iambic Septenarius meter (`S L` | `S L` | `S L` | `S L` || `S L` | `S L` | `S L`), I will group the sequence of long and short syllables into seven feet, allowing for common metrical substitutions like a trochee (`L S`), a spondee (`L L`), or a pyrrhic (`S S`).\n5.  **Final Code:** I will provide a Python script that prints the final scansion, with each foot separated by a space as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to display the scansion:\n```python\n# This script prints the scansion of the Latin line:\n# \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n# L = Long syllable, S = Short syllable.\n\n# My analysis shows the meter is Iambic Septenarius, and the scansion is as follows:\nfoot1 = \"L S\"  # et ti (Trochee substitution)\nfoot2 = \"S L\"  # bi ben (Iamb)\nfoot3 = \"L S\"  # es se (Trochee substitution)\nfoot4 = \"L L\"  # so li (Spondee substitution)\nfoot5 = \"L S\"  # quom si (Trochee substitution)\nfoot6 = \"S L\"  # bi sit (Iamb)\nfoot7 = \"S S\"  # ma le (Pyrrhic substitution)\n\n# Joining the feet with a space in between to form the complete line's scansion.\n# The instruction to \"output each number\" is interpreted as providing the\n# final sequence of L and S characters that make up the scansion.\nfull_scansion = \" \".join([foot1, foot2, foot3, foot4, foot5, foot6, foot7])\n\n# Print the final result.\nprint(full_scansion)\n```\n<<<L S S L L S L L L S S L S S>>>"
