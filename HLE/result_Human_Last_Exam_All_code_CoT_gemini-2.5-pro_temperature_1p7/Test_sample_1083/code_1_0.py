    This function determines and prints the classes for the arboricity bounds.
    
    Analysis details:
    Let f1(n) be the arboricity bound for c=1 and f2(n) for c=2.
    
    For c=1 (sampling probability p_u = 1/d_u):
    - Standard results show the arboricity is O(log n) for any graph.
    - A lower bound of Omega(log n / log(log n)) can be shown using G = K_n.
    - This places the function in class 4 or 5. We select 5, representing Theta(log n),
      as this is a common tight bound for similar problems.
      f1_class = 5
      
    For c=2 (sampling probability p_u = 1/d_u^2):
    - The sampling probability for high-degree vertices is very low, effectively destroying dense subgraphs.
    - For a graph of disjoint triangles, the resulting arboricity is 2 with high probability.
    - It's not possible to construct graphs that yield a non-constant arboricity.
    - Thus, the arboricity is bounded by a constant, O(1).
      f2_class = 1
