    "Of course, I can help with that. The number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold is not a single fixed number; it depends on the dimension of the manifold.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I'll explain that a Kähler manifold has an even real dimension, `n`, which is twice its complex dimension, `m` (i.e., `n = 2m`).\n2.  The special symmetries of a Kähler manifold significantly reduce the number of independent components of its Riemann tensor compared to a general Riemannian manifold.\n3.  I will provide the general formula for the number of independent *real* components, which is a function of the complex dimension `m`:\n    $$ \\text{Number of Components} = \\left( \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} \\right)^2 $$\n4.  Then, I'll provide a Python script that calculates this number for a user-specified complex dimension `m`. The script will demonstrate the calculation step-by-step for a clear example (let's use `m=4`).\n5.  The script will output the final equation with all numbers substituted, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation. You can change the value of `complex_dimension_m` at the top of the script to calculate the result for a manifold of any dimension.\n\n```python\n# The number of independent components depends on the complex dimension of the manifold.\n# Please set the complex dimension 'm' for the calculation.\n# Note: The real dimension will be n = 2m.\ncomplex_dimension_m = 4\n\nprint(f\"The number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold\")\nprint(f\"is not a fixed number, but depends on its complex dimension, denoted by 'm'.\")\nprint(f\"The formula to calculate this is: (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"Here is the calculation for a manifold with complex dimension m = {complex_dimension_m}:\")\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses\nm_plus_1 = complex_dimension_m + 1\nnumerator = complex_dimension_m * m_plus_1\nbase_value = numerator // 2\n\nprint(f\"1.
