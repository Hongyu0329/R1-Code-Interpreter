    print("Step 1: The contract is for the sale of a good.")
    print("The primary object of the contract is a physical painting, not just the artist's labor. Therefore, the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) applies. This eliminates option B.")
    print("\nStep 2: The implied condition of 'fitness for purpose' under the SGA applies.")
    print("This condition applies because:")
    print("  - The buyer (Lewis) made the specific purpose known (a large, detailed centrepiece of a specific location).")
    print("  - The buyer (Lewis) relied on the seller's (Marcel's) skill as a 'highly regarded artist'.")
    print("  - The goods (paintings) are what the seller (Marcel) supplies in the course of his business.")
    print("\nStep 3: Marcel breached the implied condition.")
    print("The painting delivered was small, hastily done, and of the wrong location. It was not fit for the specific purpose communicated by Lewis. This eliminates options A and C.")
    print("\nStep 4: Implied conditions apply to oral contracts.")
    print("SGA conditions are implied by law unless expressly excluded. They do not need to be mentioned to be included in an oral agreement. This eliminates option E.")
    print("\nStep 5: Lewis's remedy for breach of a condition.")
    print("A breach of a fundamental condition allows the buyer to repudiate the contract, reject the goods, and demand the return of the purchase price.")
    print("\nConclusion: Based on this analysis, the lawyer will confirm Lewis's interpretation is correct and that he can recover his money.")
