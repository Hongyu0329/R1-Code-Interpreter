    This function presents the fixed C code.
    The original C code prints an unstable memory address.
    The fix is to add a single dereference operator '*' to the second argument of printf.
    Original: printf(s, s);
    Fixed:    printf(s, *s);
    This change makes printf print the value of the first byte pointed to by 's' (which is 37)
    instead of the unstable address 's'. The output is now a stable "37".
