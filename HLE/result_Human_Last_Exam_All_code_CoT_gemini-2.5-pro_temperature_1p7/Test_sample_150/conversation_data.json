    "The Java program provided is not correct because it fails to account for all possible valid statements. The problem description states that the operation (`++` or `--`) and the variable (`X`) can appear in any order. The Java code checks for `test.contains(\"++X\")` and `test.contains(\"--X\")`, but it does not handle the cases `X++` and `X--`. Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results if the input contains these statements.\n\nA correct and efficient approach, regardless of the language, is to simply check for the presence of either a `+` or a `-` character within the input string for each statement. If a `+` is found, the variable `x` is incremented. If a `-` is found, it's decremented.\n\nHere is a Python program that correctly solves the problem based on this logic.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Initialize a variable, `x`, to 0. This variable will hold the final value.\n2. Read the first line of input to get the number of statements, `n`.\n3. Loop `n` times to process each statement.\n4. In each loop iteration, read the statement as a string.\n5. Check if the `+` character is present in the string.\n6. If `+` is present, increment `x` by 1.\n7. Otherwise, the string must contain `-`, so decrement `x` by 1.\n8. After the loop finishes, print the final value of `x`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bit_plus_plus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Bit++ programming problem.\n    The initial value of x is 0.
