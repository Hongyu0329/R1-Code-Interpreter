The mathematical formulation for the vertical cross-section, represented by the interval [μ_L(x,u), μ_U(x,u)], is given by: Lower Bound μ_L(x,u) = exp(-0.5 * ((x-c)/σ_L(u))^2) and Upper Bound μ_U(x,u) = exp(-0.5 * ((x-c)/σ_U(u))^2), where σ_L(u) and σ_U(u) are the u-dependent standard deviations defined as σ_L(u) = (σ_l+σ_u)/2 - u*(σ_u-σ_l)/2 and σ_U(u) = (σ_l+σ_u)/2 + u*(σ_u-σ_l)/2 for a primary uncertainty interval [σ_l, σ_u].
