    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the equation, are left coprime, and where $D(s)$ is non-singular. The term \"coprime factorization\" can sometimes imply that $D(s)$ must be a stable matrix (i.e., $\\det(D(s))$ has all its roots in the left-half of the complex plane). However, if the transfer function $H(s)$ itself has unstable poles, it's impossible to find such a polynomial matrix $D(s)$. In such cases, the factorization is sought over a ring of stable rational functions, or the stability requirement for $D(s)$ is dropped. Given the context, we will find a factorization using polynomial matrices, which is a standard algebraic approach.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Set up the equation**: Start with the equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$, where $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n2.  **Enforce polynomial condition**: For $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all its elements must be polynomials. This will impose certain conditions on the elements of $D(s)$. The denominators in $H(s)$ are $(s+1)$ and $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$.\n    *   $N_{11} = d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. Multiplying by the common denominator $s^2-1$, we find that $d_{11}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}$ must be divisible by $s^2-1$. This implies that the expression must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n        *   At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(0)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1) = 0$.\n        *   At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-2)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n    *   Similarly, for $N_{21} = d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$ to be a polynomial:\n        *   $d_{22}(1) = 0$.\n        *   $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n    *   The other elements, $N_{12} = d_{11}$ and $N_{22} = d_{21}$, are polynomials by definition of $D(s)$.\n3.  **Construct D(s)**: Find the simplest, non-singular polynomial matrix $D(s)$ that satisfies these four conditions. A good strategy is to try a triangular form. Let's try a lower triangular matrix, so $d_{12}(s) = 0$.\n    *   $d_{12}(s) = 0$ satisfies the first condition.\n    *   The second condition becomes $2d_{11}(-1) + 0 = 0 \\implies d_{11}(-1) = 0$. The simplest polynomial for $d_{11}(s)$ is $s+1$.\n    *   The third condition is $d_{22}(1) = 0$. The simplest polynomial for $d_{22}(s)$ is $s-1$.\n    *   The fourth condition is $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$. With $d_{22}(s)=s-1$, we get $2d_{21}(-1) + (-1-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{21}(-1) - 2 = 0 \\implies d_{21}(-1) = 1$. The simplest polynomial for $d_{21}(s)$ is the constant $1$.\n    *   This gives us $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$. Note that $\\det(D(s)) = (s+1)(s-1) = s^2-1 \\neq 0$, so it is non-singular.\n4.  **Calculate N(s)**: Compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$.\n    $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} (s+1)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} & (s+1)(1) \\\\ (1)\\frac{s-1}{s+1}+(s-1)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & (1)(1) \\end{bmatrix}$\n    $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ \\frac{(s-1)^2+2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ \\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n5.  **Verify Coprimeness**: The matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime if the composite matrix $[D(s) \\ N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex $s$.\n    $[D(s) \\ N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. The rank drops if one row is a multiple of the other. The determinant of any $2 \\times 2$ submatrix being zero for some common $s$ would indicate loss of rank. For example, considering columns 2 and 3, the determinant is $0 \\cdot 1 - (s-1)(s-1) = -(s-1)^2$. Considering columns 1 and 4, the determinant is $(s+1)(1) - (s+1)(1) = 0$. Let's try columns 1 and 2: $\\det = (s+1)(s-1)$. Columns 3 and 4: $\\det = (s-1) - (s+1) = -2$. Since there's a $2 \\times 2$ minor that is a non-zero constant (-2), the rank is always 2. Thus, they are left coprime.\n\nThe resulting factorization is $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints a left coprime factorization for the given transfer function H(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable s\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # The transfer function matrix H(s)\n    # H = sympy.Matrix([[(s-1)/(s+1), 1], [2/(s**2-1), 0]])\n\n    # A left coprime factorization is H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s).\n    # We found the following polynomial matrices D(s) and N(s).\n    \n    # Define the matrix D(s)\n    D = sympy.Matrix([[s + 1, 0],\n                      [1, s - 1]])\n\n    # Define the matrix N(s)\n    N = sympy.Matrix([[s - 1, s + 1],\n                      [1, 1]])\n\n    # Print the results in a structured format\n    print(\"A left coprime factorization of the transfer function H(s) is given by:\")\n    print(\"H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nwhere D(s) is:\")\n    sympy.pprint(D, use_unicode=False)\n    \n    print(\"\\nand N(s) is:\")\n    sympy.pprint(N, use_unicode=False)\n    \n    # As requested, outputting each polynomial element of the matrices\n    print(\"\\n--- Details of each element in the final equation ---\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nMatrix D(s):\")\n    print(f\"D_11(s) = {D[0,0]}\")\n    print(f\"D_12(s) = {D[0,1]}\")\n    print(f\"D_21(s) = {D[1,0]}\")\n    print(f\"D_22(s) = {D[1,1]}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nMatrix N(s):\")\n    print(f\"N_11(s) = {N[0,0]}\")\n    print(f\"N_12(s) = {N[0,1]}\")\n    print(f\"N_21(s) = {N[1,0]}\")\n    print(f\"N_22(s) = {N[1,1]}\")\n\nsolve_factorization()\n```\n<<<A left coprime factorization is $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ with $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.>>>"
