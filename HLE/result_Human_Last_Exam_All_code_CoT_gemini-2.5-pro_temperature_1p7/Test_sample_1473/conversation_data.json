    "My plan to solve the integral is as follows:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Integrand**: The expression within the integral, $(\\csc x)(\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x})$, can be greatly simplified. The term $\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x}$ is the key. Let's set $y = \\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x}$. By definition of the arccsc function, this means $\\csc y = \\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x}$. Squaring both sides gives $\\csc^2 y = 1+\\csc^2 x$. Using the trigonometric identity $\\csc^2 y = 1+\\cot^2 y$, we can substitute to get $1+\\cot^2 y = 1+\\csc^2 x$, which simplifies to $\\cot^2 y = \\csc^2 x$. For the given interval $x \\in (0, \\pi)$, $\\csc x$ is positive. Also, the principal value range of $y$ for a positive argument is in $(0, \\pi/2]$, where $\\cot y$ is also positive. Therefore, we can take the positive square root of both sides, yielding $\\cot y = \\csc x$. This relationship can be rewritten as $\\tan y = \\frac{1}{\\cot y} = \\frac{1}{\\csc x} = \\sin x$. From this, we find that $y = \\arctan(\\sin x)$.\n\n2.  **Rewrite the Integral**: Substituting this simplified form back into the integral, we get:\n    $I = \\int_0^{\\pi} \\csc x \\arctan(\\sin x) dx = \\int_0^{\\pi} \\frac{\\arctan(\\sin x)}{\\sin x} dx$.\n\n3.  **Solve using Symbolic Computation**: This definite integral is now in a form that is more amenable to standard integration techniques. While it can be solved manually (e.g., using Feynman's trick of differentiation under the integral sign), it is also well-suited for a symbolic mathematics library like SymPy in Python. I will write a Python script that uses SymPy to compute the exact value of this simplified integral.\n\n4.  **Implementation**: The Python code will define the necessary symbolic variable and functions, then use SymPy's `integrate` function to compute the definite integral over the interval $[0, \\pi]$. The script will then print the final, exact symbolic result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import sin, csc, atan, integrate, pi, log, sqrt, pprint\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the value of the definite integral\n    I = ∫[0, π] (csc(x) * arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)^2))) dx\n    using symbolic computation with the sympy library.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the variable of integration\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n\n    # The original integrand is (csc(x)) * arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)**2)).\n    # As derived in the plan, the term arccsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)**2)) simplifies to atan(sin(x)).\n    # We define the simplified integrand for computation.\n    # I = ∫[0, π] csc(x) * atan(sin(x)) dx\n    integrand = csc(x) * atan(sin(x))\n\n    # Calculate the definite integral from 0 to π.\n    # Note: The integrand has removable singularities at x=0 and x=π,\n    # where the limit exists (it is 1).
