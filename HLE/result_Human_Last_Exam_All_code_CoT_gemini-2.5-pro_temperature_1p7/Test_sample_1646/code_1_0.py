# Based on the mathematical derivation, the function f(z) that satisfies the
# given functional equation and initial condition is determined.

# The final explicit formula is: f(z) = sqrt(pi) / Gamma(z)
# The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.
# The primary numerical constant in this equation is pi.
