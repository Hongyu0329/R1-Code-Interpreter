  This function analyzes the statements about attack graphs and identifies the incorrect one.
  A. Both the worst-case time complexity for SEG and LAG generation is exponential. (Correct)
  B. There are attack paths representable by SEG but not LAG. (Correct, e.g., non-monotonic paths)
  C. The compactness of LAG compared to SEG is due to the monotonicity assumption. (Correct, this is the key enabler)
  D. Neither can calculate probabilities in graphs with loops. (Incorrect, methods like Markov Chains for SEG and DBNs for LAG exist)
  E. LAG struggles with negation while SEG does not. (Correct, due to logic-based vs state-based representation)
  
  The only incorrect statement is D.
