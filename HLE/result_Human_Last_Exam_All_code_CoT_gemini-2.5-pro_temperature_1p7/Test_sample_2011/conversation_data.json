    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the maximum number of different clique sizes that can appear as *induced subgraphs* in a single graph with `n = 128` vertices. An induced subgraph `G[S]` contains the vertices `S` and *all* edges from the original graph `G` that connect vertices within `S`. A clique is a subgraph where all vertices are connected to each other.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Property of Induced Cliques:** Let's consider a graph `G` that contains an induced clique of size `k`. Let this clique be formed by a set of vertices `S`, where `|S| = k`. By definition, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a complete graph `K_k`. Now, consider any smaller integer `j` where `1 <= j < k`. If we take any subset `S'` of `S` with size `j`, the induced subgraph `G[S']` will also be a complete graph (`K_j`), because all vertices in `S'` are also in `S` and are therefore all connected to each other.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Set of Clique Sizes:** This insight reveals a crucial property: if a graph `G` has an induced clique of size `k_{max}`, it must also have induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to `k_{max}`. Therefore, the set of all possible induced clique sizes for any given graph `G` will always be of the form `{1, 2, 3, ..., k_{max}}`, where `k_{max}` is the size of the largest induced clique in `G`.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Problem:** To maximize the number of different clique sizes, we simply need to maximize `k_{max}`. The problem is now equivalent to: What is the maximum possible size of an induced clique in a graph with `n=128` vertices?\n\n5.  **Construct the Optimal Graph:** For a graph with `n` vertices, the largest possible size for an induced clique is `n`. We can achieve this by constructing the **complete graph** `K_n`, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For `n = 128`, we consider the graph `K_{128}`.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Answer:** In the `K_{128}` graph, any subset of `k` vertices forms an induced clique of size `k`. Therefore, we can find induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., all the way up to 128. The set of different clique sizes is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, and the number of these sizes is 128. Since no clique can be larger than the total number of vertices, this is the maximum possible.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single\n    graph with n = 128 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of vertices in the graph\n    n = 128\n\n    # The problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can\n    # exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph G with n vertices.\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the nature of induced cliques.\n    # If a graph has an induced clique of size k (a K_k), then any subset of\n    # j < k vertices from that clique will form an induced clique of size j.\n    # This means the set of achievable clique sizes is always {1, 2, ..., k_max},\n    # where k_max is the size of the largest induced clique in the graph.\n    \n    # Step 2: Maximize the number of sizes.\n    # To maximize the number of different clique sizes, we must maximize k_max.\n    \n    # Step 3: Find the maximum possible k_max.\n    # For a graph on n vertices, the maximum size of any induced clique is n.\n    # This maximum is achieved by the complete graph, K_n.\n    \n    # Step 4: Construct the solution for n = 128.\n    # We choose the graph to be the complete graph on 128 vertices, K_128.\n    # In K_128, for any integer k from 1 to 128, any set of k vertices\n    # forms an induced clique of size k.\n    \n    # The maximum number of different clique sizes is therefore n.\n    max_sizes = n\n    \n    # Output the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(f\"Let the number of vertices be n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"To maximize the number of different induced clique sizes, we must maximize the size of the largest induced clique.\")\n    print(f\"The largest possible induced clique in a graph with {n} vertices is of size {n}.\")\n    print(f\"This is achieved by the complete graph K_{n}, which has induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, ..., {n}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the final equation for the maximum number of different clique sizes is: maximum_sizes = {max_sizes}\")\n    \n    # For the final answer extraction format.\n    # Suppress all other prints when run in a specific environment for answer extraction.\n    if 'ANSWER_ONLY' in sys.argv:\n        # Clear previous prints if running in a real environment is complex.\n        # For this script, just printing the answer is fine.\n        print(f\"<<<{max_sizes}>>>\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<128>>>"
