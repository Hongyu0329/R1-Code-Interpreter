    # The problem defines two cardinal characteristics, lambda and mu.
    # A simple argument shows that mu <= lambda in ZFC.
    # The quantity to maximize is the cardinality of lambda \ mu, which is lambda itself
    # when mu < lambda. So we need to find the maximum possible value of lambda.

    # A theorem by Saharon Shelah from pcf theory states that lambda <= (2^kappa)^+.
    # This provides a ZFC upper bound on lambda.

    # Further results show this bound is sharp, meaning it's consistent with ZFC
    # to have lambda = (2^kappa)^+ while mu is a smaller cardinal.

    # Therefore, the maximum possible value for the cardinality in question is (2^kappa)^+.
    # The following code prints this symbolic result, showing its components as requested.

    base = 2
    exponent = "Îº"
    successor_op = "+"

    # The result is (2^kappa)^+
    print(f"The maximum possible cardinality is ({base}^{exponent})^{successor_op}")
