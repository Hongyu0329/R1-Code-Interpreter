# Step 1: Solving for k_Yuk
# The N=4 Yukawa term coupling the N=1 gaugino and matter multiplets simplifies to
# L_N4_Yuk = 2 * k_Yuk * f_abc * phi_i4 * psi * lambda + c.c.
# The N=1 Yukawa term is given as
# L_N1_Yuk = sqrt(2) * f_abc * phi_i* * psi * lambda + c.c.
# We express the complex scalar phi_i in terms of real component fields S_i and P_i
# which are canonically normalized: phi_i = (S_i + i*P_i)/sqrt(2).
# The real part S_i is identified with the N=4 scalar phi_i4.
# So, phi_i* = (S_i - i*P_i)/sqrt(2) = (phi_i4 - i*P_i)/sqrt(2).
# Substituting this into the N=1 Lagrangian gives:
# L_N1_Yuk = sqrt(2) * f_abc * (1/sqrt(2)) * (phi_i4 - i*P_i) * psi * lambda + c.c.
# L_N1_Yuk = 1 * f_abc * phi_i4 * psi * lambda + ...
# We match the coefficient of the (f_abc * phi_i4 * psi * lambda) term.
# From N=4, the coefficient is 2*k_Yuk.
# From N=1, the coefficient is 1.
# So, 2 * k_Yuk = 1
k_Yuk = sympy.Rational(1, 2)

# Step 2: Solving for k_D+F
# The N=1 D-term potential is given as
# L_D = (1/2) * (f_abc * phi_i* * phi_i)^2
# The N=4 scalar potential is given as
# L_F+D = k_D+F * (f_abc * phi_IJ * phi_KL) * (f_ade * phi^IJ * phi^KL)
# The full N=4 potential decomposes into the N=1 D-term and F-term potentials.
# The problem asks to fix k_D+F by matching L_D to the corresponding terms in L_F+D.
# This means that the coefficient of the D-term part of the potential should be 1/2.
# So we identify k_D+F directly with the coefficient from L_D.
k_D_plus_F = sympy.Rational(1, 2)

# The task is to calculate the final values, let's represent them and the equation.
