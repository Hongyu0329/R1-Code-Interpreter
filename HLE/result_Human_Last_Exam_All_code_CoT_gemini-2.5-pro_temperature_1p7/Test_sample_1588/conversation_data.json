    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we need to calculate the dimension of the 10th-degree homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on two generators (let's call them X and Y). This value corresponds to the number of linearly independent nested commutators of degree 10, which forms a basis for the terms of that order.\n\nThe dimension is given by Witt's formula:\n`Dimension = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} [μ(d) * k^(n/d)]`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order, which is 10.\n*   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2 (X and Y).\n*   The sum is over all positive integers `d` that are divisors of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Define the order `n=10` and number of generators `k=2`.\n2.  Find all divisors of `n`.\n3.  For each divisor `d`, calculate the value of the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n4.  Calculate each term in the sum: `μ(d) * k^(n/d)`.\n5.  Sum all the terms and divide by `n` to get the final result.\n6.  The script will print out each step of this calculation, including the final equation with all numbers involved.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bch_coefficients(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients for a given order in the BCH expansion\n    using Witt's formula and prints the detailed calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def get_divisors(num):\n        \"\"\"Finds all positive divisors of a number.\"\"\"\n        divs = set()\n        for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                divs.add(i)\n                divs.add(num // i)\n        return sorted(list(divs))\n\n    def mobius(num):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Möbius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n        if num == 1:\n            return 1\n        \n        p_count = 0\n        temp_n = num\n        i = 2\n        # Check for factors up to sqrt(temp_n)\n        while i * i <= temp_n:\n            if temp_n % i == 0:\n                p_count += 1\n                temp_n //= i\n                # Check for square factors\n                if temp_n % i == 0:\n                    return 0\n            i += 1\n        \n        # If temp_n is still > 1, it's a prime factor itself\n        if temp_n > 1:\n            p_count += 1\n            \n        # Return based on parity of prime factors count\n        return -1 if p_count % 2 != 0 else 1\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    divisors_of_n = get_divisors(n)\n    sum_of_terms = 0\n    calculation_steps = []\n\n    for d in divisors_of_n:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        exponent = n // d\n        term = mu_d * (k ** exponent)\n        sum_of_terms += term\n        calculation_steps.append({\n            'd': d,\n            'mu': mu_d,\n            'exp': exponent,\n            'term': term\n        })\n\n    result = sum_of_terms // n\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero BCH coefficients of order n={n} for k={k} generators.\")\n    print(\"Using Witt's Formula: (1/n) * sum over d|n of [mu(d) * k^(n/d)]\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: The divisors 'd' of n={n} are: {divisors_of_n}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate each term of the sum:\")\n    for step in calculation_steps:\n        print(f\"  For d={step['d']:<2}: term = mu({step['d']}) * {k}^({n}/{step['d']}) = ({step['mu']}) * {k}^{step['exp']} = {step['term']}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nStep 3: Sum the terms and divide by n.\")\n\n    # --- Final Equation Breakdown ---\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    \n    # Line 1: Formula with symbolic values\n    line1_parts = [f\"({step['mu']})*({k}^{step['exp']})\" for step in calculation_steps]\n    line1 = f\"(1/{n}) * [ \" + \" + \".join(line1_parts) + \" ]\"\n    print(line1.replace(\"+ (-\", \"- \"))\n\n    # Line 2: Evaluated terms\n    line2_parts = [str(step['term']) for step in calculation_steps]\n    line2 = f\"= (1/{n}) * [ \" + \" + \".join(line2_parts) + \" ]\"\n    print(line2.replace(\"+ (\", \"\").replace(\")\", \"\").replace(\"+ -\", \"- \"))\n\n    # Line 3: Sum inside the brackets\n    line3 = f\"= (1/{n}) * [ {sum_of_terms} ]\"\n    print(line3)\n\n    # Line 4: Final result\n    line4 = f\"= {result}\"\n    print(line4)\n\n# Execute the calculation for the specific problem\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    order_n = 10\n    generators_k = 2\n    calculate_bch_coefficients(order_n, generators_k)\n```\n<<<99>>>"
