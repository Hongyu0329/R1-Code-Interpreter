    "To find the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Outer Hull:** The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its \"outer-hull,\" or more formally its convex hull, is the smallest convex shape that contains all its vertices. The vertices of a great icosahedron are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, the outer hull is a **regular icosahedron**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Outer Hull's Surface:** The question asks for the number of visible triangles from the outside, which corresponds to the number of triangles on the surface of this regular icosahedron.\n\n3.  **Use the Triangulation Formula:** For any convex polyhedron (which is topologically equivalent to a sphere), the number of triangles (T) in any triangulation of its surface is related to the number of its vertices (V) by the formula `T = 2V - 4`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula:** A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices (V = 12). We can use this in the formula to find the number of triangles. This confirms the number of faces, as an icosahedron's surface is already a minimal triangulation composed of 20 triangles.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value and prints the steps of the equation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the number of vertices for the outer hull.\n# The outer hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices.\nnum_vertices = 12\n\n# Step 2: Use the formula for triangulating a convex polyhedron.\n# The number of triangles (T) required to triangulate a convex polyhedron\n# with V vertices is given by the formula T = 2*V - 4.\n# This formula is derived from Euler's characteristic (V - E + F = 2).\n# Since a regular icosahedron is already made of triangles, this will give us its number of faces.\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of triangles.\nnum_triangles_part1 = 2 * num_vertices\nnum_triangles = num_triangles_part1 - 4\n\n# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final equation step-by-step.\nprint(f\"The outer hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron, which has {num_vertices} vertices.\")\nprint(\"The formula for the number of triangles (T) in a triangulation of a convex polyhedron with V vertices is: T = 2 * V - 4\")\nprint(\"\\nApplying the formula:\")\nprint(f\"T = 2 * {num_vertices} - 4\")\nprint(f\"T = {num_triangles_part1} - 4\")\nprint(f\"T = {num_triangles}\")\nprint(\"\\nSo, the minimal number of triangles needed is 20.\")\n\n```\n<<<20>>>"
