# Step 1: Define the number of vertices for the outer hull.
# The outer hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.
# A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices.
num_vertices = 12

# Step 2: Use the formula for triangulating a convex polyhedron.
# The number of triangles (T) required to triangulate a convex polyhedron
# with V vertices is given by the formula T = 2*V - 4.
# This formula is derived from Euler's characteristic (V - E + F = 2).
# Since a regular icosahedron is already made of triangles, this will give us its number of faces.

# Step 3: Calculate the number of triangles.
num_triangles_part1 = 2 * num_vertices
num_triangles = num_triangles_part1 - 4

# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final equation step-by-step.
