    "Of course, I can help you with this programming problem.\n\nHere is my plan to solve the task:\n1.  First, I will provide a Python script to solve the string comparison problem as requested. The script will read the two input strings, convert them both to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive, and then perform a lexicographical comparison.\n2.  Next, I will address the specific sub-task about writing a memory-efficient C program and calculating its memory usage.\n3.  For the C program, the most memory-efficient approach would be to avoid storing the second string in memory entirely. We can read the first string into a buffer, and then read the second string one character at a time, comparing it on-the-fly with the corresponding character from the first string.\n4.  Finally, I will calculate the total memory (`m`) in bytes used for the variables in this optimal C program and provide the answer in the requested format.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads two strings, compares them lexicographically ignoring case,\n    and prints -1, 1, or 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the first string from standard input\n        s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        # Read the second string from standard input\n        s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n        # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n        s1_lower = s1.lower()\n        s2_lower = s2.lower()\n\n        # Perform the comparison and print the result\n        if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n            print(\"-1\")\n        elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n            print(\"1\")\n        else:\n            print(\"0\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n### C Program Memory Analysis\n\nAs per your request, I will now analyze the memory usage of the most memory-efficient C program for this task.\n\nThe C program would operate as follows:\n1.  Read the first string into a character array buffer.\n2.  Read the second string one character at a time using `getchar()`. This avoids allocating a second buffer.\n3.  In a loop, compare each character of the first string (after converting to lowercase) with the character just read from the second string (also converted to lowercase).\n4.  Print the result and exit as soon as a difference is found. If the loop completes, the strings are equal.\n\nThe variables required for this C program and their memory consumption (assuming a standard 32/64-bit architecture where `char` is 1 byte and `int` is 4 bytes) would be:\n\n1.  `char str1[101];` A buffer to store the first string. The maximum length is 100, plus one byte for the null terminator `\\0`.\n    *   Memory: 101 * `sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 = **101 bytes**.\n2.  `int i;` An integer variable to serve as an index for `str1`.\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n3.  `int c;` An integer variable to store the return value of `getchar()`, which is an `int` to handle `EOF`.\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\nThe total memory `m` used for these variables is the sum:\nm = 101 (for the string buffer) + 4 (for the index) + 4 (for the input character) = 119 bytes.\n\nUpon re-evaluating the approach, an even more concise C code can be written using string functions which may be more readable, but the character-by-character `getchar()` approach remains the most frugal in terms of declared variables on the stack. My calculation is based on that optimal approach.\n\nWait, my calculation `101 + 4 + 4` is `109`, not `119`. Let me correct that.\n\nm = 101 bytes + 4 bytes + 4 bytes = 109 bytes.\n\n<<<109>>>"
