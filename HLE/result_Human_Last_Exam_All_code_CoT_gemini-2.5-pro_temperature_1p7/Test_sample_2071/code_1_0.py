    # Analysis of the scene:
    # The choreography is cyclical and aligns with the rhyming words at the end of the song's lines.
    # We are looking for the word where Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) exaggerates her right leg movement for the second time.

    # First instance:
    # Lyric: "It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well"
    # On the word "well", Mia performs the first exaggerated right leg movement.
    first_instance_word = "well"

    # Second instance:
    # The dance pattern repeats. After shifting focus, Mia returns to the same move.
    # Lyric: "And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell"
    # On the word "bell", Mia performs the second exaggerated right leg movement.
    second_instance_word = "bell"

    # Answer choices given:
    # A. well, B. mademoiselle, C. truly, D. bell, E. tell, F. chapel
