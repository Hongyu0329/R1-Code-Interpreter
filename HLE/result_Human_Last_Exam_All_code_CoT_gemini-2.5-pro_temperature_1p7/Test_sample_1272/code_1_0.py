# The historical event in question is the Battle of Tốt Động-Chúc Động.
# This battle took place in late 1426 during the Lam Sơn uprising against Ming rule in Vietnam.
# Ming General Mu Sheng was leading a reinforcement army to support the main Ming forces commanded by Wang Tong.
# The combined Ming forces were lured into an ambush by the Vietnamese forces led by Lê Lợi.
# The result was a decisive and catastrophic defeat for the Ming army.

# The battlefields of Tốt Động and Chúc Động are located in the present-day Chương Mỹ District.
# Chương Mỹ District is part of the capital city of Hanoi, which is a municipality with the same status as a province.

# Therefore, the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced this major defeat is Hanoi.
