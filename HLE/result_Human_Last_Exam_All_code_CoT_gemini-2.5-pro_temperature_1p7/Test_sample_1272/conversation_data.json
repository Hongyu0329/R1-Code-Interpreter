    "My plan is to first research the military campaigns of the Ming General Mu Sheng in Vietnam. I will focus on the Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi. I will then identify the specific battle that is considered his first significant defeat. Finally, I will determine the modern-day Vietnamese province where this battle took place and write a Python script to print the name of that province.\n\n```python\n# The historical event in question is the Battle of Tốt Động-Chúc Động.\n# This battle took place in late 1426 during the Lam Sơn uprising against Ming rule in Vietnam.\n# Ming General Mu Sheng was leading a reinforcement army to support the main Ming forces commanded by Wang Tong.\n# The combined Ming forces were lured into an ambush by the Vietnamese forces led by Lê Lợi.\n# The result was a decisive and catastrophic defeat for the Ming army.\n\n# The battlefields of Tốt Động and Chúc Động are located in the present-day Chương Mỹ District.\n# Chương Mỹ District is part of the capital city of Hanoi, which is a municipality with the same status as a province.\n\n# Therefore, the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced this major defeat is Hanoi.\n\nprovince_name = \"Hanoi\"\nprint(f\"The current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat is: {province_name}\")\n```\n<<<Hanoi>>>"
