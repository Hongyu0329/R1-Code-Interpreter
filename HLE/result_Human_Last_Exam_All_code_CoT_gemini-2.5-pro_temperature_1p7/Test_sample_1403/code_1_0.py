    Solves the hat puzzle by calculating N, M, and their difference.

    This solution is based on the following interpretations:
    - The phrasing "Each hat is either black and yellow or blue and white" implies
      there are two distinct types of hats. This is a 2-color problem.
    - The strategies employed are standard for modular arithmetic-based hat puzzles.
