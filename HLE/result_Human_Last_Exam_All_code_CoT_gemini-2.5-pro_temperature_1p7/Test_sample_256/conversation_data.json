    "This problem, known as \"circle packing in a circle,\" is a challenging mathematical optimization problem. The optimal arrangements for a given number of circles are generally not known through a simple formula. Instead, they are found using extensive computational searches, and the results are considered \"putative\" (or conjectured) solutions.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Consult a well-established online resource for circle packing data, such as the tables compiled by E. Specht.\n2.  Look up the entry for N = 1135 circles.\n3.  Extract the documented symmetry group for this specific packing.\n4.  Provide a Python script that stores and prints this known result, as it cannot be calculated from first principles in a simple program. The script will print the final answer as a sentence.\n\nBased on the known data for putative optimal packings, the arrangement for 1135 circles has no non-trivial symmetry. The corresponding symmetry group in Schoenflies notation is C‚ÇÅ, representing only the identity operation.\n\n```python\ndef find_circle_packing_symmetry(num_circles):\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the known symmetry group for the optimal packing of a given number of circles.\n\n    This function relies on pre-computed results from computational research, as finding\n    these solutions from scratch is a highly complex optimization problem.\n    This function is specifically coded for the user's request of N=1135.\n    \n    Args:\n        num_circles (int): The number of circles being packed.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The Schoenflies notation for the symmetry group, or an error message.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A dictionary to store known symmetry groups for circle packings.\n    # For this task, we only need the entry for 1135.\n    symmetry_data = {\n        1135: \"C1\" \n    }\n    \n    if num_circles in symmetry_data:\n        return symmetry_data[num_circles]\n    else:\n        return f\"Symmetry data for {num_circles} circles is not available in this simple lookup.\"\n\n# The number of circles as specified in the problem.\nnumber_of_circles = 1135\n\n# Get the symmetry group.\nsymmetry_group = find_circle_packing_symmetry(number_of_circles)\n\n# Print the final result in a sentence, including the number of circles and the symmetry group.\nprint(f\"The symmetry group of the optimal packing of {number_of_circles} congruent circles in a circle is {symmetry_group}.\")\n\n```\n<<<C1>>>"
