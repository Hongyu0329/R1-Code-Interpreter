# From the analysis, the singularities are at z=1 and z=2.

# Step 2: Identify the singularities from the B(z) field equation.
# These are the roots of the polynomial P(z) = 4z^4 - z^3 + z^2 + 1 and their reciprocals.
# We don't need to find the roots, only their sum, using Vieta's formulas.
# P(z) = a4*z^4 + a3*z^3 + a2*z^2 + a1*z + a0
p_coeffs = [4, -1, 1, 0, 1]  # Coefficients of P(z)
a4, a3, a2, a1, a0 = p_coeffs

# Number of roots of P(z)

# The sum of the roots of P(z) is -a3/a4
sum_roots_p = -a3 / a4

# The sum of the reciprocals of the roots of P(z) is -a1/a0
sum_reciprocal_roots_p = -a1 / a0

# The total number of singularities from B(z) is the number of roots of P(z) plus their reciprocals.
num_singularities_B = num_roots_p * 2
# The sum of singularities from B(z) is the sum of roots plus the sum of reciprocal roots.
sum_singularities_B = sum_roots_p + sum_reciprocal_roots_p

# Step 3: Calculate the average of all identified singularities.
total_num_singularities = num_singularities_E + num_singularities_B
total_sum_singularities = sum_singularities_E + sum_singularities_B
average_value = total_sum_singularities / total_num_singularities
