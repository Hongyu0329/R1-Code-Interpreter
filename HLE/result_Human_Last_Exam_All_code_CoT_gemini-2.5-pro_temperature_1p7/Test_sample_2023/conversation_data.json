    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the recursive function `f(a,b,c)`**: I will first find a closed-form expression for the function `f(a,b,c)`. This can be done by setting up its generating function `G(x,y,z)`. The recurrence relation translates into an algebraic equation for `G`, from which we can identify the coefficients, which are `f(a,b,c)`. This reveals that `f(a,b,c)` is a multinomial coefficient.\n\n2.  **Analyze the parameters `α_p, β_p, γ_p`**: These are defined as sums of geometric series. I will express them as polynomials in the prime `p`. This form will turn out to be the base-`p` expansion of the numbers `A = α_p`, `B = β_p/2`, and `C = γ_p/3`.\n\n3.  **Apply Lucas's Theorem for multinomial coefficients**: The problem asks for `f(α_p, β_p, γ_p) mod p`, which is `C(A+B+C, A, B, C) mod p`. Since the base-`p` expansions of `A, B, C` are known and there are no \"carries\" when they are added in base `p`, I can use the multinomial extension of Lucas's Theorem. This powerful theorem simplifies the calculation of a large multinomial coefficient modulo a prime `p` into a product of smaller multinomial coefficients, one for each \"digit\" in the base-`p` representation.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the product**: The base-`p` digits of `A, B, C` are periodic. This means the resulting product consists of a few small multinomial coefficients repeated many times. I will calculate these small coefficients and simplify the product into the form `K^E \\mod p`.\n\n5.  **Perform modular exponentiation**: The exponent `E` will depend on `p`. Using Fermat's Little Theorem (`a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p`), I will simplify this expression. The calculation will involve evaluating a Legendre symbol.\n\n6.  **Final computation and code**: After simplifying the expression, the final result will be a straightforward calculation. I will provide a Python script to compute this final numerical value, displaying the main numbers involved in the calculation as requested by the user.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the values of the small multinomial coefficients derived from the base-p expansion.\n# The base-p digits of the arguments of the function f lead to a repeating pattern of three\n# multinomial coefficients.\n# C1 = C(6, 1, 4, 1) = 6! / (1! * 4! * 1!)\n# C2 = C(8, 3, 2, 3) = 8! / (3! * 2! * 3!)\n# C3 = C(10, 4, 2, 4) = 10! / (4! * 2! * 4!)\n\nC1 = math.factorial(6) // (math.factorial(1) * math.factorial(4) * math.factorial(1))\nC2 = math.factorial(8) // (math.factorial(3) * math.factorial(2) * math.factorial(3))\nC3 = math.factorial(10) // (math.factorial(4) * math.factorial(2) * math.factorial(4))\n\n# Step 2: The final value modulo p is congruent to -(C1 * C2 * C3)^2.\n# Let's calculate K = C1 * C2 * C3.\nK = C1 * C2 * C3\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final result, which is -K^2.\nresult = -(K**2)\n\n# Step 4: Print the components of the final equation and the result.\n# The prompt requires showing each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"The calculation boils down to evaluating an expression of the form K^E mod p.\")\nprint(f\"The base K is a product of three multinomial coefficients C1, C2, and C3.\")\nprint(f\"C1 = C(6,1,4,1) = {C1}\")\nprint(f\"C2 = C(8,3,2,3) = {C2}\")\nprint(f\"C3 = C(10,4,2,4) = {C3}\")\nprint(f\"The final result is -( ({C1}) * ({C2}) * ({C3}) )^2 = -({K})^2 = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<-2790126400000000>>>"
