  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school.

To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia.

    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan and the final Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Read the Input:** The program will read the sum as a single string from the user. For example, `3+2+1+4`.\n2.  **Extract Numbers:** The numbers in the sum are separated by `+`. We can split the string by the `+` character to get a list of the numbers as strings: `['3', '2', '1', '4']`.\n3.  **Sort the Numbers:** The list of numbers needs to be sorted in non-decreasing (ascending) order. Sorting the list of strings directly works correctly because the numbers are all single digits. The sorted list will be `['1', '2', '3', '4']`.\n4.  **Reconstruct the Sum:** Join the sorted numbers back together into a single string, using `+` as the separator. This will produce the final string: `'1+2+3+4'`.\n5.  **Print the Result:** Display the final, rearranged sum to the user.\n\nFollowing this plan, here is the Python code to accomplish the task.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), sorts the numbers,\n    and prints the new sum in non-decreasing order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Read the input sum from a single line\n    s = input()\n\n    # 2. Extract the numbers by splitting the string at the '+' signs\n    summands = s.split('+')\n\n    # 3. Sort the list of numbers. Since they are single digits,\n    # alphabetical sorting is equivalent to numerical sorting.\n    summands.sort()\n\n    # 4. Join the sorted numbers back into a string with '+'\n    new_sum = \"+\".join(summands)\n\n    # 5. Print the final result. The output format is the full equation.\n    print(new_sum)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n### C Program Memory Analysis\n\nFor the second part of your request, here is the analysis of the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem.\n\nTo achieve maximum memory efficiency, we should avoid creating any extra arrays to store the numbers. The best approach is to sort the numbers *in-place* within the input string itself. The numbers are always at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). We can use a simple sorting algorithm like Selection Sort that only operates on these specific characters of the string.\n\nA C program implementing this would require the following variables:\n\n1.  `char s[1001]`: An array to store the input string. The maximum length is 1000 characters, plus 1 for the null terminator (`\\0`).\n    *   Size: `1001 * sizeof(char)` = `1001 * 1` = **1001 bytes**.\n2.  `int i, j`: Two integer variables to act as loop counters for the nested loops of the sorting algorithm.\n    *   Size: `2 * sizeof(int)` = `2 * 4` = **8 bytes** (assuming a standard 32/64-bit system where int is 4 bytes).\n3.  `char temp`: A character variable needed to swap two numbers during the sort.\n    *   Size: `1 * sizeof(char)` = `1 * 1` = **1 byte**.\n\nThe total memory `m` used for these variables is the sum of their sizes.\n\nm = 1001 (for the string) + 8 (for loop counters) + 1 (for the swap variable) = 1010 bytes.\n\n<<<1010>>>"
