    "This problem asks for the maximum chromatic number ($\\chi(G)$) of a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph ($K_n$).\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Upper Bound on Chromatic Number:** For any simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is always less than or equal to the number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n\n2.  **Condition for Maximum Chromatic Number:** The maximum chromatic number $\\chi(G) = n$ is achieved if and only if the graph $G$ is a complete graph ($G = K_n$). A complete graph is one where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Coloring a $K_n$ requires $n$ distinct colors, as every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex.\n\n3.  **Applying the Constraint:** The problem states that our graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number cannot be $n$. This implies that $\\chi(G) < n$, so the number of colors required must be at most $n-1$. For our case, $n = 12345$, so $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\n4.  **Achievability of the Upper Bound:** We need to check if this maximum value of $n-1$ is actually achievable for some graph that is not a complete graph. Let's construct such a graph:\n    *   Consider a graph $G'$ which is a complete graph on $n-1 = 12344$ vertices. Let's call this subgraph $K_{12344}$. The chromatic number of this subgraph is $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n    *   Now, let's create our graph $G$ by adding one more vertex, say $v$, to $G'$. We don't add any edges connected to $v$. So, $v$ is an isolated vertex.\n    *   The resulting graph $G$ has $(n-1) + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   This graph $G$ is not a complete graph $K_{12345}$ because the vertex $v$ is not connected to any other vertex.\n    *   The chromatic number of this disconnected graph $G$ is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. The components are the $K_{12344}$ and the single vertex $v$.\n    *   $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(\\{v\\})) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We have shown that the number of colors cannot exceed $12344$, and we have constructed a valid graph that requires exactly $12344$ colors. Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is $12344$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors for a graph with n vertices\n    that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n\n    # A graph on n vertices has a chromatic number of n if and only if it is the complete graph Kn.\n    # Since the graph G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than n.\n    # The maximum possible chromatic number is therefore n - 1.\n    # This maximum is achievable, for example, by a graph consisting of a K_{n-1}\n    # and one isolated vertex. This graph has n vertices, is not complete, and\n    # requires n - 1 colors.\n    max_colors = n - 1\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(f\"Let n be the number of vertices, n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The maximum number of colors for a graph on n vertices is n, achieved only by the complete graph Kn.\")\n    print(\"Since our graph is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be at most n - 1.\")\n    print(\"This maximum is achievable for a graph like K_{n-1} with an additional isolated vertex.\")\n    print(\"Thus, the maximum number of colors is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"{n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
