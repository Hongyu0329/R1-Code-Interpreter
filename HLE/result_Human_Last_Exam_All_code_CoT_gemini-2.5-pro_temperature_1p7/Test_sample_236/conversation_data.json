    "To determine the number of homology cobordism group elements representable by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knots:** First, we list all knots with four or fewer crossings. These are the unknot ($0_1$), the trefoil knot ($3_1$), and the figure-eight knot ($4_1$). Since the trefoil knot is chiral (not equivalent to its mirror image), we must consider both the right-handed ($+3_1$) and left-handed ($-3_1$) versions. The unknot and figure-eight knot are amphichiral, so they are equivalent to their mirror images.\n\n2.  **Consider Integral Surgeries:** An integral surgery on a knot $K$ in the 3-sphere $S^3$ produces a new 3-manifold. For this manifold to be a homology 3-sphere (i.e., having the same integer homology groups as $S^3$), the surgery coefficient must be either $+1$ or $-1$. Thus, for each knot, we will consider these two surgeries.\n\n3.  **Use Homology Cobordism Invariants:** To distinguish the resulting homology spheres up to homology cobordism, we use established invariants. A powerful set of such invariants includes:\n    *   The **Rokhlin invariant**, $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   The **Heegaard Floer d-invariant**, $d \\in 2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Two homology spheres representing the same element in the homology cobordism group must have the same values for these invariants.\n\n4.  **Connect Invariants to Knots:** Fortunately, there are direct formulas that relate these manifold invariants to invariants of the knot being surgered:\n    *   The Rokhlin invariant of the surgered manifold is given by the Arf invariant of the knot: $\\mu = \\text{Arf}(K) \\pmod 2$.\n    *   The d-invariant is related to the Ozsváth-Szabó tau-invariant ($\\tau$) of the knot:\n        *   For $+1$ surgery: $d = -2 \\cdot \\tau(K)$\n        *   For $-1$ surgery: $d = 2 \\cdot \\tau(K)$\n\n5.  **Calculate and Count:** We will systematically calculate the invariant pair $(d, \\mu)$ for $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on each of the identified knots. By counting the number of unique pairs, we find the number of distinct homology cobordism elements we can represent.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_cobordism_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of distinct homology cobordism elements\n    representable by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define knots with at most 4 crossings and their invariants.\n    # Knots: 0_1 (unknot), 3_1 (trefoil), 4_1 (figure-eight).\n    # The trefoil (3_1) is chiral, so we consider both right-handed and left-handed versions.\n    # The unknot and figure-eight are amphichiral.\n    # We need the Arf invariant and the Tau (τ) invariant for each.\n    # Arf(-K) = Arf(K), τ(-K) = -τ(K).\n    Knot = collections.namedtuple('Knot', ['name', 'Arf', 'tau'])\n    knots = [\n        Knot(\"0_1 (Unknot)\", 0, 0),\n        Knot(\"3_1 (Right-handed Trefoil)\", 1, 1),\n        Knot(\"-3_1 (Left-handed Trefoil)\", 1, -1),\n        Knot(\"4_1 (Figure-Eight Knot)\", 0, 0),\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing homology cobordism elements from integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"The knots considered are the unknot (0_1), trefoil (3_1), and figure-eight (4_1).\")\n    print(\"Integral surgery on a knot K gives a homology sphere for surgery coefficients +1 and -1.\")\n    print(\"We compute the invariants (d, μ) for each resulting homology sphere.\")\n    print(\"  - Rokhlin invariant: μ = Arf(K) mod 2\")\n    print(\"  - d-invariant for +1 surgery: d = -2 * τ(K)\")\n    print(\"  - d-invariant for -1 surgery: d = 2 * τ(K)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    # Use a set to store the unique invariant pairs (d, μ), which identify the elements.\n    represented_elements = set()\n\n    # Step 2-4: Iterate through knots, calculate invariants for +/- 1 surgery.\n    for knot in knots:\n        print(f\"Knot: {knot.name}\")\n        print(f\"  Properties: Arf = {knot.Arf}, τ = {knot.tau}\")\n        \n        # +1 Surgery\n        mu_plus_1 = knot.Arf % 2\n        d_plus_1 = -2 * knot.tau\n        element_plus_1 = (d_plus_1, mu_plus_1)\n        represented_elements.add(element_plus_1)\n        print(f\"  +1 Surgery: μ = {knot.Arf} mod 2 = {mu_plus_1}\")\n        print(f\"              d = -2 * {knot.tau} = {d_plus_1}\")\n        print(f\"              Generated element (d, μ): {element_plus_1}\")\n        \n        # -1 Surgery\n        mu_minus_1 = knot.Arf % 2\n        d_minus_1 = 2 * knot.tau\n        element_minus_1 = (d_minus_1, mu_minus_1)\n        represented_elements.add(element_minus_1)\n        print(f\"  -1 Surgery: μ = {knot.Arf} mod 2 = {mu_minus_1}\")\n        print(f\"              d = 2 * {knot.tau} = {d_minus_1}\")\n        print(f\"              Generated element (d, μ): {element_minus_1}\")\n        print()\n\n    # Step 5: Count and display the unique elements.\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"The unique (d, μ) invariant pairs found are:\")\n    # Sort for deterministic output\n    for elem in sorted(list(represented_elements)):\n        description = \"\"\n        if elem == (0, 0):\n            description = \"(This is the trivial element, the class of S^3)\"\n        elif elem == (2, 1) or elem == (-2, 1):\n            description = \"(These are non-trivial elements of infinite order)\"\n        print(f\"  Element: (d={elem[0]}, μ={elem[1]}) {description}\")\n\n    count = len(represented_elements)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\" * 80)\n    print(f\"The total number of distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented is {count}.\")\n    print(\"=\" * 80)\n\nsolve_cobordism_elements()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
