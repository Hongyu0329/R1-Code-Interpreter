    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct patterns (equivalence classes) of minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, where equivalence is defined by translation and rotation of the grid.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Determine the minimal grid size:** The minimal grid number for a knot is related to its properties, like the crossing number. For the trefoil knot (crossing number 3), the minimal grid number is 3. Thus, we are considering diagrams on a 3x3 grid.\n2.  **Define Equivalence:** The problem states equivalence is \"up to translation and rotation\".\n    *   **Translation:** On a finite grid, this corresponds to cyclic shifts of rows and columns.\n    *   **Rotation:** This refers to the rotational symmetries of the square (90, 180, 270 degrees). However, we must be careful, as some symmetries can change a knot into its mirror image. It is a known property of grid diagrams that 180-degree rotation transforms a knot diagram into a diagram of its mirror image. Since the trefoil is chiral (not equivalent to its mirror image), we cannot use 180-degree rotation as an equivalence operation for this problem. We are left with 90-degree and 270-degree rotations.\n3.  **Classify Diagrams:** According to the classification of minimal grid diagrams in knot theory literature, all minimal grid diagrams for the trefoil knot fall into two distinct families that are inequivalent under translation and valid rotations.\n    *   **Class 1 (Diagonal type):** These are diagrams where the 'X' markers can be arranged along one of the two main diagonals. All such diagrams for the left-hand trefoil are equivalent to each other. For example, a diagram with Xs on the main diagonal can be rotated by 90 degrees to have Xs on the anti-diagonal, but both are considered part of the same equivalence class under our rules. This constitutes one class.\n    *   **Class 2 (Non-diagonal type):** These are diagrams where the 'X' markers are placed in a pattern that cannot be made diagonal through any combination of allowed translations and rotations. All such diagrams for the left-hand trefoil form another single, distinct equivalence class.\n4.  **Count the Classes:** The total number of unique diagrams is the sum of these distinct equivalence classes.\n\nThe Python code below formalizes this reasoning to arrive at the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trefoil_grid_diagrams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot\n    up to translation and rotation.\n\n    Based on the classification of minimal (3x3) grid diagrams, there are two\n    fundamental types of diagrams for the trefoil knot that are not equivalent\n    under the operations of cyclic grid translation and chirality-preserving rotation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The first equivalence class is characterized by having its 'X' markers\n    # arranged on a generalized diagonal.\n    # A representative diagram has X's at (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) and O's at\n    # (1,3), (2,1), (3,2).\n    # All other \"diagonal\" type diagrams for the left-hand trefoil can be reached\n    # from this one via allowed transformations.\n    num_diagonal_classes = 1\n\n    # The second equivalence class is characterized by its 'X' markers\n    # being in a \"mixed\" or non-diagonal pattern.\n    # A representative diagram has X's at (1,1), (2,3), (3,2) and O's at\n    # (1,2), (2,1), (3,3).\n    # This pattern cannot be transformed into the diagonal pattern.\n    num_non_diagonal_classes = 1\n\n    # The total number of diagrams is the sum of these distinct classes.\n    total_diagrams = num_diagonal_classes + num_non_diagonal_classes\n\n    print(\"The total number of unique minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot is the sum of distinct equivalence classes.\")\n    print(f\"Number of 'diagonal' type classes: {num_diagonal_classes}\")\n    print(f\"Number of 'non-diagonal' type classes: {num_non_diagonal_classes}\")\n    print(f\"Final equation: {num_diagonal_classes} + {num_non_diagonal_classes} = {total_diagrams}\")\n\n\nsolve_trefoil_grid_diagrams()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
