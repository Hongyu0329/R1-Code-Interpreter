    This function identifies and prints the correct triplets from the provided list.
    Based on biological analysis:
    - Triplet 3 is correct: Batesian mimicry is a valid mode. Eristalini (hoverflies) are classic Batesian mimics that use color. It is plausible that a species of Melipotini (moths) serves as a colorful, unpalatable model.
    - Triplet 5 is correct: MÃ¼llerian mimicry is a valid mode. Heliconiini (butterflies) and other Lepidoptera like moths (plausibly including some Melipotini) form mimicry rings where multiple unpalatable species share a warning color pattern.
    - Triplet 8 is correct: Aposematism is a valid mode of warning signaling. Danaus plexippus (monarch butterfly) uses its colored wings, and Cycnia tenera (tiger moth) uses its sound-producing tymbals to warn predators of their toxicity.
    
    The other triplets contain clear inaccuracies in their definitions or examples.
    The correct triplets are identified as 3, 5, and 8.
