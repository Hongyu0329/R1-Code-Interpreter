    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of independent logical qubits for the toric code on a surface with `n` smooth and `m` rough holes. The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is then 2 raised to the power of the number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Understanding the System**: We consider the toric code defined on a 2D surface, which we can assume to be an infinite plane for simplicity. On this plane, there are `n` holes with \"smooth\" boundaries and `m` holes with \"rough\" boundaries.\n2.  **Anyons and Boundaries**: In the toric code, there are two types of fundamental anyonic excitations: electric charges (`e`) and magnetic fluxes (`m`).\n    *   A **smooth boundary** (also called an electric or open boundary) is a boundary where `e`-charges can terminate without costing any energy.\n    *   A **rough boundary** (also called a magnetic or hole boundary) is a boundary where `m`-fluxes can terminate without costing any energy.\n3.  **Ground States**: The ground states of the system are configurations with no excitations in the bulk. However, anyons can exist at the boundaries (the holes) without any energy penalty. The different configurations of these boundary anyons correspond to the different degenerate ground states.\n4.  **Counting States for Smooth Holes**: Each of the `n` smooth holes can either have an `e`-charge or not. Since we are on an infinite plane, the boundary at infinity can act as a reservoir for charges. This means the charge configuration at each hole is independent of the others. For each of the `n` smooth holes, there are 2 possibilities (charge or no charge). This gives `2^n` possible configurations for the `e`-charges. This corresponds to `n` logical qubits associated with the smooth holes.\n5.  **Counting States for Rough Holes**: Similarly, each of the `m` rough holes can either have an `m`-flux or not. The boundary at infinity can also serve as a reservoir for fluxes. The flux configuration at each hole is independent. For each of the `m` rough holes, there are 2 possibilities (flux or no flux). This gives `2^m` possible configurations for the `m`-fluxes, corresponding to `m` logical qubits.\n6.  **Total Degeneracy**: The electric charge configurations and magnetic flux configurations are independent of each other (the corresponding logical operators commute). Therefore, the total number of degenerate ground states is the product of the number of states from each sector.\n    *   GSD = (Degeneracy from smooth holes) Ã— (Degeneracy from rough holes)\n    *   GSD = `2^n * 2^m = 2^(n + m)`\n\nThis means there are `k = n + m` logical qubits in total. The final formula for the ground space degeneracy is `2^(n + m)`.\n\nThe following Python code prints this resulting formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_toric_code_degeneracy():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the formula for the ground space\n    degeneracy of the toric code with n smooth and m rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The base of the exponent in the degeneracy formula is 2.\n    base = 2\n    \n    # The components of the exponent are the number of smooth holes 'n'\n    # and the number of rough holes 'm'. We treat them as symbolic characters.\n    n_holes = 'n'\n    m_holes = 'm'\n    \n    # The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is 2^k, where k\n    # is the number of logical qubits.\n    # Each smooth hole contributes one 'electric' qubit, giving n qubits.\n    # Each rough hole contributes one 'magnetic' qubit, giving m qubits.\n    # The total number of qubits is k = n + m.\n    # Therefore, the GSD = 2^(n + m).\n    \n    print(\"The ground space degeneracy of the toric code with n smooth holes and m rough holes is given by the formula:\")\n    \n    # Print the formula showing each component part.\n    print(f\"{base}^({n_holes} + {m_holes})\")\n\nsolve_toric_code_degeneracy()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
