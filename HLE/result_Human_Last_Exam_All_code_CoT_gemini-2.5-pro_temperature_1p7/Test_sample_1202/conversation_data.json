    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request**:\n    *   **Primary Goal**: Answer a multiple-choice question about the fates of duplicated genes.\n    *   **Constraint**: The answer must be delivered via a Python or shell script.\n    *   **Constraint**: The script should use a `print` function for its output.\n    *   **Constraint**: Only a single code block is allowed.\n    *   **Constraint**: A step-by-step plan or thinking process should be outlined first.\n    *   **Constraint**: The final output should include the chosen letter in the format `<<<ANSWER>>>`.\n    *   **Odd Constraint**: \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\" This seems like a template mismatch. I will interpret this as a need to clearly explain the reasoning for each answer choice (A, B, C, D, E) within the code's output.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Biological Question**:\n    *   **Topic**: Retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotes.\n    *   **\"Gene Duplication\"**: An event where a region of DNA containing a gene is copied. Initially, the two copies are identical.\n    *   **\"Retention\"**: The duplicate gene must not be lost over evolutionary time. The most common fate for a duplicate is to be lost through disabling mutations (becoming a pseudogene) because it is redundant. Retention implies a selective pressure to keep it.\n    *   **\"Divergence\"**: The two copies must accumulate different mutations over time, causing their sequences and potentially their functions to become different.\n    *   **The Core Task**: Identify the mechanism *most likely* to cause both retention *and* divergence.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices**:\n    *   **A. Gene conversion**: This is a process that makes two similar DNA sequences identical. It actively works *against* divergence. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization**: This is when one copy accumulates mutations that make it non-functional. While this is the *most common fate* of a duplicated gene, it is a mechanism of *loss of function*, not retention of two functional genes. The question implies the retention of functionality. So, this is incorrect in this context.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization**: This model proposes that one gene copy keeps the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations and evolves a brand-new function. This explains both retention (as both the old and new functions are beneficial) and divergence (the sequences change to produce the new function). This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization**: This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions (subfunctions). After duplication, each copy loses different subfunctions through mutation. As a result, both genes are now required to perform the complete set of functions of the original ancestral gene. This explains retention (both copies are needed) and divergence (they accumulate different inactivating mutations). This is also a very strong candidate.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation**: This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of species from a common ancestor to fill different ecological niches. It is a pattern of evolution, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level. It operates at the wrong scale. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Compare the Strong Candidates (C vs. D)**:\n    *   The question asks for the \"*most likely*\" mechanism. Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models for the preservation of gene duplicates.\n    *   Neofunctionalization requires a relatively rare event: a gain-of-function mutation that creates a new, beneficial role for the gene.\n    *   Subfunctionalization, however, can occur through much more common loss-of-function mutations. By randomly knocking out different subfunctions in each copy, the two genes become mutually dependent. This provides a passive and therefore more probable pathway to preserve both copies from being lost. Once preserved, they have more evolutionary time to potentially evolve a new function later.\n    *   Because subfunctionalization relies on more frequent mutation types (degeneration/loss) to ensure retention, many evolutionary biologists consider it a more common or \"likely\" pathway for the initial preservation of duplicated genes than neofunctionalization.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Code**:\n    *   I will write a Python script as requested.\n    *   The script will define a dictionary containing each answer choice (A-E) and a detailed explanation of why it is or is not the correct mechanism.\n    *   The code will then iterate through this dictionary and print the evaluation for each option, satisfying the interpreted \"equation\" constraint.\n    *   Finally, the script will print a concluding statement explaining the choice of D as the most likely mechanism based on the reasoning above.\n    *   The entire response will end with the final answer formatted as `<<<D>>>`.\n\nThis structured approach ensures all constraints are met while providing a clear, well-reasoned answer to the biological question.\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_gene_duplication_mechanisms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates different mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes\n    to determine the most likely one.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Gene conversion',\n            'explanation': 'Incorrect.
