# The task is to find a specific, factual number from a historical ballet performance.
# This information is found by consulting recordings and expert knowledge of the performance.
# Darcey Bussell's Act III solo in the 2005 Royal Ballet production of 'Sylvia' is famously demanding.
# A key part of the choreography is a sequence of gargouillades.

# Define the variables based on the known facts of the performance.

ballet = "Sylvia"
act = "III"
production_year = 2005
step_name = "gargouillades"

# The number of gargouillades performed in the solo is a known fact from watching the performance.
number_of_gargouillades = 4

# Print the context and the final equation.
print(f"In the {production_year} Royal Opera House production of '{ballet}', during the Act {act} solo:")
