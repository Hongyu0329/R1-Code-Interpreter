def calculate_gate_capacitance():
    """
    This function derives and prints the formula for the gate capacitance (C_g)
    based on the principles of the Quantum Hall Effect.

    The key steps in the derivation are:
    1. The change in gate voltage (dV_bg) to fill one Landau level is determined
       from the given sequence of voltages (V1, 3*V1, 5*V1) to be 2*V1.
    2. The charge density (d_sigma) required to fill one Landau level is calculated,
       considering a total degeneracy (spin and valley) of g = 4.
       d_sigma = g * e^2 * B / h = 4 * e^2 * B / h.
    3. The capacitance is C_g = d_sigma / dV_bg.
