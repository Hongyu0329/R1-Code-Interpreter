def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function prints the cardinality of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R
    that satisfy the equation f(f(x)) = exp(x).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Any such function f must be strictly increasing and satisfy x < f(x) < exp(x).
    2. A solution f is uniquely determined by choosing a value c = f(0) in (0,1)
       and a continuous, strictly increasing function h from [0, c] to [c, 1].
    3. The number of choices for c is the cardinality of the continuum, c.
    4. For each choice of c, the number of choices for h is also c.
    5. The total number of solutions is c * c = c.
    6. The cardinality of the continuum, c, is equal to 2 raised to the power of aleph_0.

    The final python code will print the result in the format |S| = 2^(aleph_0).
