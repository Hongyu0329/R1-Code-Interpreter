    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We want to find the cardinality of this set, $|S|$.\n\n1.  **Analyze the properties of $f$.**\n    *   **Injectivity:** If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is injective, $x_1 = x_2$. Thus, $f$ must be an injective function.\n    *   **Monotonicity:** Since $f$ is continuous and injective on $\\mathbb{R}$, it must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n        *   If $f$ were strictly decreasing, then $f(f(x))$ would be strictly increasing. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, which is strictly increasing. However, a strictly decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have exactly one fixed point (i.e., a point $x_0$ where $f(x_0)=x_0$). If $f$ had a fixed point $x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This would mean $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. But the equation $e^x=x$ has no real solutions (since $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$). Therefore, $f$ cannot have a fixed point and cannot be strictly decreasing.\n        *   Thus, $f$ must be strictly increasing.\n    *   **Behavior relative to $y=x$:** Since $f$ has no fixed points, the continuous function $g(x) = f(x) - x$ is never zero. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, $g(x)$ must be either always positive or always negative.\n        *   If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. This would imply $\\exp(x) < f(x) < x$. But $\\exp(x) < x$ is false for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So this case is impossible.\n        *   Therefore, it must be that $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   From these properties, we can conclude that for any solution $f$, it must be strictly increasing and satisfy $x < f(x) < f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Constructing the solutions.**\n    The solutions to this equation can be constructed by defining the function on a \"seed\" interval and then uniquely extending it to the entire real line.\n    *   Let's pick an arbitrary starting point, say $x_0=0$. Let $f(0)=c$. From the inequality above, $0 < f(0) < \\exp(0)$, so $0 < c < 1$. The choice of $c \\in (0,1)$ is a parameter that defines a family of solutions.\n    *   We also know $f(c) = f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\n    *   Now, we must define $f$ on the interval $[0, c]$. Since $f$ is continuous and strictly increasing, it must map the interval $[0, c]$ to the interval $[f(0), f(c)] = [c, 1]$. Any continuous, strictly increasing function $h: [0,c] \\to [c,1]$ is a possible candidate for the behavior of $f$ on this seed interval.\n    *   Once we have chosen $c \\in (0,1)$ and a continuous strictly increasing function $h: [0, c] \\to [c, 1]$ (let's set $f(x)=h(x)$ for $x\\in[0,c]$), the function $f$ is uniquely determined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   **Extension to $\\mathbb{R}$:**\n        *   For $x \\in [c, 1]$, $x$ can be written as $x=h(u)$ for a unique $u \\in [0,c]$. We must define $f(x) = f(h(u)) = f(f(u)) = e^u = e^{h^{-1}(x)}$.\n        *   For $x \\in [1, e^c]$, $x$ can be written as $x=f(u)$ for a unique $u \\in [c,1]$. We must define $f(x) = f(f(u)) = e^u$. This process can be continued to extend $f$ to $[0, \\infty)$.\n        *   For $x < 0$, we use the relation $f(y) = e^x \\implies y = f^{-1}(e^x)$. If we set $f(x)=y$, then $x = f^{-1}(y)$. So $f(x)=y$ can be found by solving for $y$ in $x = \\ln(f(y))$. This extends the definition to $(-\\infty, 0)$.\n    *   This construction shows that a unique solution $f$ is determined by the choice of a pair $(c, h)$, where $c \\in (0,1)$ and $h$ is any continuous, strictly increasing function from $[0,c]$ to $[c,1]$.\n\n3.  **Counting the solutions.**\n    We need to find the number of possible pairs $(c, h)$.\n    *   The number of choices for $c \\in (0,1)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   For any fixed $c$, we need to find the number of continuous, strictly increasing functions $h: [0,c] \\to [c,1]$. Such a function is a homeomorphism between the two intervals. The set of such homeomorphisms has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. For instance, one can construct such functions by modifying the straight line $y=c + \\frac{1-c}{c}x$ with another continuous function, and there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ ways to do this.\n    *   Since for each of the $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices of $c$, there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $h$, the total number of distinct solutions is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the cardinality of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R\n    that satisfy the equation f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n\n    The reasoning is as follows:\n    1. Any such function f must be strictly increasing and satisfy x < f(x) < exp(x).\n    2. A solution f is uniquely determined by choosing a value c = f(0) in (0,1)\n       and a continuous, strictly increasing function h from [0, c] to [c, 1].\n    3. The number of choices for c is the cardinality of the continuum, c.\n    4. For each choice of c, the number of choices for h is also c.\n    5. The total number of solutions is c * c = c.\n    6. The cardinality of the continuum, c, is equal to 2 raised to the power of aleph_0.\n\n    The final python code will print the result in the format |S| = 2^(aleph_0).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let S be the set of the functions.\n    set_name = \"S\"\n    \n    # The cardinality of S is denoted as |S|.\n    cardinality_of_S = f\"|{set_name}|\"\n\n    # The cardinality is 2 to the power of aleph-null.\n    # The numbers in this expression are 2 and 0.\n    base = 2\n    \n    # We use unicode for the symbol aleph (ℵ).\n    aleph_char = '\\u2135'\n    \n    # The subscript for 0.\n    subscript_zero = '₀'\n    \n    power = f\"{aleph_char}{subscript_zero}\"\n\n    # Print the final equation for the cardinality.\n    print(f\"The cardinality of the set of functions is:\")\n    print(f\"{cardinality_of_S} = {base}^({power})\")\n\nsolve_cardinality_problem()\n\n```\n<<<The cardinality of the set of functions is:\n|S| = 2^(ℵ₀)\n>>>"
