    "Of course. I will answer your question about cuttlefish neuroanatomy.\n\nBased on your request, I will provide a Python script to present the answer. My plan is to store the names of the relevant brain regions in a list and then use a `print` function to display them in a clear and readable format.\n\n```python\ndef find_posterior_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions located posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \n    The palliovisceral lobe is a part of the posterior subesophageal mass\n    of the cephalopod brain. The structures lying adjacent and posterior to it\n    are critical for locomotion and escape responses.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the brain regions posterior to the palliovisceral lobe\n    posterior_regions = [\"Fin lobes\", \"Giant fiber lobe\"]\n    \n    print(\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are:\")\n    \n    # Print each region\n    for region in posterior_regions:\n        print(f\"- {region}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer\nfind_posterior_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the fin lobes and the giant fiber lobe.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
