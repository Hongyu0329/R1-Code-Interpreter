    "Of course, I can help with that. To find the first 3 digits after the decimal point of tan(10^100), we need to handle a very large number. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Use Periodicity:** The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. This means `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. We can simplify the problem by finding the remainder of `10^100` divided by π.\n2.  **High-Precision Arithmetic:** The number `10^100` (a googol) is far too large for standard floating-point numbers. I will use Python's built-in `decimal` module, which allows for user-defined, high-precision calculations.\n3.  **Set Precision:** To accurately calculate `10^100 mod π`, the value of π we use must have a very high precision. A precision of 115 digits will be sufficient to ensure the remainder is accurate.\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Set the precision for the `decimal` module.\n    *   Define `10^100` and a high-precision value of π as `Decimal` objects.\n    *   Compute the remainder `r = 10^100 % π`.\n    *   Calculate `tan(r)` using the `decimal` module's `tan()` function.\n    *   Extract and print the first three digits following the decimal point from the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef solve_tan_googol():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100).\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Set a high precision for the decimal calculations.\n    # 10^100 has 101 digits. The number of integer multiples of pi in it\n    # is about 100 digits long. We need precision greater than that.\n    # 115 digits is a safe level of precision for this task.\n    decimal.getcontext().prec = 115\n\n    # 2. Define the number N = 10^100 and a high-precision value of pi.\n    N = decimal.Decimal(10) ** 100\n    \n    # A high-precision string representation of pi.\n    pi_str = \"3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679\"\n    pi = decimal.Decimal(pi_str)\n\n    # 3. Calculate the remainder of N divided by pi.\n    # This leverages the periodicity of tan(x), where tan(x) = tan(x mod pi).\n    remainder = N % pi\n\n    # 4. Calculate the tangent of the remainder.\n    result = remainder.tan()\n\n    # 5.
