    # --- Explanation ---
    print("The task is to determine the minimal average resources required for a Local Hidden Variable (LHV) model")
    print("to simulate the measurement correlations of a bipartite singlet quantum state.")
    print("The allowed resources are classical communication (C) and non-signaling PR-Boxes (N).\n")

    print("1. Understanding the Resources:")
    print("   - An LHV model uses shared randomness (a 'hidden variable') that is distributed before the measurements.")
    print("   - By Bell's Theorem, LHV models alone cannot reproduce all quantum correlations.")
    print("   - To succeed, the model needs additional resources like classical communication (measured in bits) or")
    print("     access to non-local resources like the Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) Box.\n")

    print("2. Resource Equivalence:")
    print("   - In the study of non-local correlations, it's a known result that communication and PR-Boxes are")
    print("     equivalent and interconvertible resources. For simulation purposes:")
    print("     1 bit of communication <=> 1 PR-Box\n")

    print("3. The Key Result:")
    print("   - Research in quantum foundations (specifically, by Masanes, AcÃ­n, and Gisin in 2007) has shown")
    print("     that any entangled two-qubit state, including the singlet state, can be perfectly simulated using an")
    print("     LHV model augmented with exactly ONE bit of classical communication per measurement round.")
    print("   - It has also been shown that this is the minimum amount required; it is both necessary and sufficient.\n")

    print("4. The Trade-off Equation:")
    print("   - Since 1 bit of communication is the required amount, and this resource is equivalent to 1 PR-Box,")
    print("     we can express the minimal required resources as a trade-off equation.")
    print("   - Let C be the average communication in bits and N be the average number of PR-Boxes used.")
    print("   - The total 'non-local resource' value must equal 1.\n")

    # --- Final Equation ---
    # Coefficients for the equation C + N = 1
    coeff_C = 1.0
    coeff_N = 1.0
    total_resource = 1.0

    print("-------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The minimal resources are described by the following equation:")
    # Using sys.stdout.write to prevent print's default newline for constructing the equation line
    sys.stdout.write(f"({coeff_C}) * C   +   ({coeff_N}) * N   =   {total_resource}\n")
    print("-------------------------------------------------------------------------")

    print("\nWhere:")
    print("  C: Average bits of communication (C >= 0)")
    print("  N: Average number of PR-Boxes (N >= 0)\n")

    print("This means you can use:")
    print("- 1 full bit of communication and 0 PR-Boxes, OR")
    print("- 1 full PR-Box and 0 bits of communication, OR")
    print("- Any combination, such as 0.5 bits of communication and 0.5 PR-Boxes.")
