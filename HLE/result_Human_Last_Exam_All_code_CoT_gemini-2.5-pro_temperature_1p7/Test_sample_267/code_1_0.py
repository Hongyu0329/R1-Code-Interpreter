# The task is to translate "If XPPX, then it is impossible that RNFG"
# into a modal propositional statement.

# Based on the step-by-step analysis, the correct formula is (XPPX ü†ö ‚òê~RNFG).
# This corresponds to option D.

# The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation!".
# As there are no numbers, I will print each logical component of the statement instead.
