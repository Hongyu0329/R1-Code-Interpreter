# This problem is about the representation theory of a quantum group at a root of unity.
# The answer is derived from the classification of indecomposable modules, which is a known
# result in mathematics. The code will outline the logic.

# 1. Define the context
q_root_order = 3
algebra_name = f"u_q(sl_2) at a primitive {q_root_order}rd root of unity"

# 2. Classification of indecomposable modules
# The algebra is of "tame" representation type. Its indecomposable modules are classified
# into discrete and continuous families.

# Discrete family:
# There is a countably infinite set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules.
# Let's represent this abstractly.
num_discrete_indecomposables = float('inf') # Countably infinite
# This family contains 3 simple (irreducible) modules: L(0), L(1), L(2).
num_discrete_irreducibles = 3

# Continuous family:
# There is a continuous family of indecomposable modules of dimension 3,
# parameterized by the complex projective line (a continuum).
# Let's represent the "size" of this set.
size_continuum_indecomposables = "continuum"
# All modules in this family are indecomposable. Almost all of them are irreducible.
# The number of non-irreducible modules in this family is finite.
num_non_irreducible_in_continuum = "finite"

# 3. Formulate the percentage calculation
# To calculate a percentage, we compare the "size" or "measure" of the set of
# irreducible modules to the set of all indecomposable modules.

# In a context with both countable sets and a continuum, the standard approach is
# measure-theoretic. The measure of any finite or countable set is 0 compared to
# the measure of a continuum.
measure_of_countable_or_finite_set = 0
# We can normalize the measure of the continuum to 1.
measure_of_continuum = 1.0

# 4. Calculate the measure of each set

# Measure of the set of all indecomposable modules:
# This set is the union of the discrete family (countable) and the continuous family (continuum).
# Its measure is the sum of their measures.
measure_of_all_indecomposables = measure_of_countable_or_finite_set + measure_of_continuum
num1 = measure_of_all_indecomposables

# Measure of the set of irreducible modules:
# This set consists of the 3 discrete irreducibles (a finite set) and the irreducibles
# from the continuous family. The irreducibles from the continuum are the whole
# continuum minus a finite number of exceptions.
measure_of_discrete_irreducibles = measure_of_countable_or_finite_set
measure_of_continuum_exceptions = measure_of_countable_or_finite_set
measure_of_continuum_irreducibles = measure_of_continuum - measure_of_continuum_exceptions

measure_of_all_irreducibles = measure_of_discrete_irreducibles + measure_of_continuum_irreducibles
num2 = measure_of_all_irreducibles

# 5. Calculate the final percentage
percentage = (measure_of_all_irreducibles / measure_of_all_indecomposables) * 100

# 6. Print the explanation and result
