    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mathematical Object:** The user is asking about the representation theory of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. We need to understand the structure of the category $C$ of its finite-dimensional indecomposable modules.\n\n2.  **Classify Indecomposable Modules:** The algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$ is of \"tame\" representation type. This means its indecomposable modules can be classified. They fall into two main categories:\n    *   A countably infinite set of \"discrete\" modules, often organized into structures called \"tubes\". These include the standard simple modules $L(0)$ and $L(1)$, and an infinite series of other non-simple indecomposable modules of increasing dimension. The module $L(2)$ also belongs to this class, forming a tube by itself.\n    *   A \"continuous\" family of indecomposable modules. This family consists of modules of dimension 3, parameterized by a continuous variable $\\lambda$ from the complex projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$. Let's call these modules $V_\\lambda$.\n\n3.  **Classify Irreducible Modules:** An irreducible module is one that has no proper non-zero submodules. By definition, irreducible modules are also indecomposable. We need to identify which of the modules from Step 2 are irreducible.\n    *   From the discrete set, there are exactly three irreducible modules: $L(0)$ (dimension 1), $L(1)$ (dimension 2), and $L(2)$ (dimension 3).\n    *   From the continuous family $\\{V_\\lambda\\}$, a module $V_\\lambda$ is irreducible for almost all values of the parameter $\\lambda$. The modules are non-irreducible only for a finite number of special values of $\\lambda$.\n\n4.  **Compare the Sets:** The set of all indecomposable modules is the union of the countably infinite discrete set and the continuous family (a continuum). The set of irreducible modules is the union of a finite set (3 modules, $\\{L(0), L(1), L(2)\\}$) and the continuous family minus a finite subset. Note that one of the discrete simples, $L(2)$, is also an element of the continuous family.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Percentage:** To find the percentage, we need to compare the \"size\" of the set of irreducible modules to the \"size\" of the set of all indecomposable modules. Since both sets are infinite and one contains a continuum, the standard way to approach this is using a measure-theoretic argument.\n    *   The parameter space for all indecomposable modules is the union of a countable set (for the discrete modules) and a continuum, $\\mathbb{P}^1$ (for the continuous family).\n    *   The parameter space for the non-irreducible modules is a countable set (for the discrete non-simples) plus a finite set of points in $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n    *   In measure theory, any countable or finite set of points has a measure of zero. The set of non-irreducible modules is therefore a set of measure zero.\n    *   This implies that the set of irreducible modules has a measure equal to the total measure of the parameter space.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The ratio of the measure of the irreducible modules to the measure of all indecomposable modules is 1. Therefore, 100% of the objects of $C$ are irreducible. I will write a Python script to lay out this reasoning and compute the final percentage.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This problem is about the representation theory of a quantum group at a root of unity.\n# The answer is derived from the classification of indecomposable modules, which is a known\n# result in mathematics.

Classification of indecomposable modules\n# The algebra is of \"tame\" representation type. Its indecomposable modules are classified\n# into discrete and continuous families.\n\n# Discrete family:\n# There is a countably infinite set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules.\n# Let's represent this abstractly.\nnum_discrete_indecomposables = float('inf') # Countably infinite\n# This family contains 3 simple (irreducible) modules: L(0), L(1), L(2).\nnum_discrete_irreducibles = 3\n\n# Continuous family:\n# There is a continuous family of indecomposable modules of dimension 3,\n# parameterized by the complex projective line (a continuum).\n# Let's represent the \"size\" of this set.\nsize_continuum_indecomposables = \"continuum\"\n# All modules in this family are indecomposable. Almost all of them are irreducible.\n# The number of non-irreducible modules in this family is finite.\nnum_non_irreducible_in_continuum = \"finite\"\n\n# 3. Formulate the percentage calculation\n# To calculate a percentage, we compare the \"size\" or \"measure\" of the set of\n# irreducible modules to the set of all indecomposable modules.\n\n# In a context with both countable sets and a continuum, the standard approach is\n# measure-theoretic. The measure of any finite or countable set is 0 compared to\n# the measure of a continuum.\nmeasure_of_countable_or_finite_set = 0\n# We can normalize the measure of the continuum to 1.\nmeasure_of_continuum = 1.0\n\n# 4.
