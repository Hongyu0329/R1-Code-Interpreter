    "The Justified True Belief (JTB) model of knowledge posits that for one to \"know\" a proposition, one must (1) believe it, (2) it must be true, and (3) one must be justified in believing it. Given only the epistemic states of Knowledge and Belief, and ignoring Gettier-style problems, the JTB framework still faces significant challenges. Here is a step-by-step plan to identify two of them.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the \"Justification\" condition (J):** The definition requires justification, but it doesn't state what counts as justification or how the chain of justification should terminate. This immediately brings up a classic epistemological problem.\n2.  **Problem 1: The Infinite Regress Problem.** If every justified belief must be justified by another belief, we are forced into an infinite chain. For example, my belief that P is justified by my belief that Q. But then my belief that Q must also be justified, perhaps by my belief that R, and so on forever. The JTB model itself does not provide a stopping point for this regress, leaving any belief without an ultimate foundation.\n3.  **Analyze the relationship between Justification (J) and Truth (T):** The JTB model treats these as separate, independent criteria. A belief can be very well-justified but still false. This points to the second problem.\n4.  **Problem 2: The Fallibility of Justification.** Since justification and truth are independent, one can be perfectly rational and have compelling evidence for a belief that turns out to be false. For example, before the discovery of black swans, a European was justified in believing \"all swans are white.\" This belief was justified but false. JTB accounts for this not being knowledge (because it fails the \"Truth\" condition), but it raises a deeper problem: if our best justification can still lead to falsehood, it seems disconnected from the truth-seeking goal of knowledge. It questions how strong a justification must be and highlights a gap between our internal state of being justified and the external state of reality.\n\nBased on these steps, the following Python script will print the two problems.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains two problems with the Justified True Belief (JTB)\n    definition of knowledge, excluding Gettier problems.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Assuming the JTB definition of Knowledge (Justified True Belief) and ignoring Gettier problems, here are two major issues:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    # Problem 1: The Infinite Regress of Justification\n    problem1_title = \"1.

The Infinite Regress Problem of Justification:\nThe JTB theory requires a belief to be justified, but does not specify how this process of justification works. If every belief requires another belief to justify it, this creates an infinite regress. For example, to know P, you must have a justified belief in P. If that justification is another belief, Q, then Q must also be justified by another belief, R, and so on, ad infinitum.

This means a person can have a very strong, rational justification for a belief that is ultimately false. For centuries, people were justified in believing the sun orbited the Earth based on all available observational evidence. This was a 'Justified False Belief.' While JTB correctly states this is not knowledge, it highlights a weakness: justification provides no guarantee of truth.
