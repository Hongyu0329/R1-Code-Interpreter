Assuming the JTB definition of Knowledge (Justified True Belief) and ignoring Gettier problems, here are two major issues:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The Infinite Regress Problem of Justification:
The JTB theory requires a belief to be justified, but does not specify how this process of justification works. If every belief requires another belief to justify it, this creates an infinite regress. For example, to know P, you must have a justified belief in P. If that justification is another belief, Q, then Q must also be justified by another belief, R, and so on, ad infinitum. The JTB model itself does not provide a mechanism to stop this chain, meaning no belief could ever be fundamentally justified.

2. The Problem of Fallible Justification:
The JTB model treats justification and truth as completely independent conditions. This means a person can have a very strong, rational justification for a belief that is ultimately false. For centuries, people were justified in believing the sun orbited the Earth based on all available observational evidence. This was a 'Justified False Belief.' While JTB correctly states this is not knowledge, it highlights a weakness: justification provides no guarantee of truth. This creates a gap between our rational processes and reality, raising the question of how useful or strong the 'justification' condition really is if it can be so disconnected from truth.
