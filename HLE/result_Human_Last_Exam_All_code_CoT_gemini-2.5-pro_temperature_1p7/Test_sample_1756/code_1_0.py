    This function analyzes the statements about transformer model inference and identifies the correct ones.
    
    The reasoning for each statement is as follows:
    - A: Correct. When both top-k and nucleus sampling are used, the pool of candidates is the intersection of the tokens selected by each method. Thus, the effective pool is determined by whichever is more restrictive.
    - B: False. Beam search with b=1 is functionally equivalent to greedy search. Tie-breaking is an implementation detail for both, not a differentiator of the algorithms themselves.
    - C: Correct. Temperature τ > 1 flattens the probability distribution. This means more tokens are needed to sum up to the cumulative probability 'p' in nucleus sampling, potentially including tokens that were outside the original (τ=1) nucleus.
    - E: Correct. When truncating a distribution and renormalizing, all kept probabilities are divided by the same constant (the sum of the kept probabilities). This preserves their relative ratios.
    - F: Correct. The claim is that for any nucleus sampling, one can find a "properly tuned" top-k sampling that excludes at least as much probability mass. If we choose k to be the size of the nucleus set (or smaller), the top-k set's probability mass will be equal to (or less than) the nucleus set's mass, thus the excluded mass for top-k will be greater than or equal to that of the nucleus.
    - G: Correct. The standard application of sequential top-k and nucleus sampling is as a set of filters. The final set of tokens is the intersection of the set from top-k and the set from nucleus. Set intersection is a commutative operation.
    - H: False. Greedy decoding produces a single deterministic output (zero diversity). Beam search produces 'b' outputs, which is inherently more diverse. Diverse beam search further increases this diversity.
    - I: False. Temperature τ < 1 sharpens the distribution, making the model more confident in its top choice. This makes it *more* likely for different beams to converge on the same high-probability path, not less.
    - J: False. The claim "completely eliminated" is too strong. While length normalization can mitigate the bias towards short sentences, it cannot guarantee that the beams won't converge if one path is overwhelmingly probable.
    - K: False. A repetition penalty typically divides a token's logit by a penalty factor > 1. This is equivalent to applying a *high* temperature (τ > 1) to that specific logit to reduce its probability. A *low* temperature (τ < 1) would have the opposite effect.
    - L: False. Nucleus sampling with p=1 considers all tokens in the vocabulary (as their probabilities sum to 1). This is equivalent to standard multinomial sampling regardless of ties. The "only if" condition is unnecessary and makes the statement false.
    - M: False. `torch.manual_seed()` is not sufficient to guarantee determinism on GPUs, especially for complex operations in MoE models. One typically needs to enable deterministic algorithms (e.g., `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`), which can come with a performance cost.
    - N: False. The term "monotonically" is incorrect. As models are trained (and depth often helps), they tend to become more confident, leading to lower-entropy predictions and thus *less* variance in outputs, not more.
    - O: Correct. Different GPU architectures (e.g., A100 vs. V100) have different hardware for floating-point math. This can lead to tiny numerical differences that get amplified over a whole forward pass, causing different outcomes in sensitive algorithms like beam search.
    - P: Correct. In MoE models, mechanisms to handle expert capacity limits can be non-deterministic (e.g., depending on the specific tokens in a batch). This leads to different experts processing tokens across runs, yielding different logits and thus different nucleus sampling sets.
    - R: Correct. Batches with variable sequence lengths require padding. The resulting tensor shape can influence which low-level GPU kernels (e.g., from cuDNN) are used for operations like matrix multiplication. These kernels may not be bit-wise identical, leading to non-determinism.
    - S: False. The entropy of a mixture of distributions can be greater than the entropy of any of its individual components. A simple counterexample is mixing two zero-entropy distributions (delta peaks at different tokens), which results in a distribution with positive entropy.
    - T: False. Quantization, the process of reducing numerical precision, can change the relative order of values that are very close to each other. Therefore, it does not guarantee preservation of token rankings.
    - W: False. The word "always" makes this false. If all experts in an MoE model produce the exact same distribution, the final mixed distribution will be identical, and thus have the same "effective temperature", not a higher one.
    - X: Correct. This is a fundamental reason for non-reproducibility. The order of summation in floating-point arithmetic affects the result (e.g., `(a+b)+c != a+(b+c)`). Parallel algorithms for attention scores don't guarantee a fixed order of operations.
    - Y: Correct. Activation checkpointing involves recomputing activations. This recomputation is subject to the same floating-point numerical variations as any other computation, so the recomputed value may not be bit-wise identical to the original, which changes the final distribution.
