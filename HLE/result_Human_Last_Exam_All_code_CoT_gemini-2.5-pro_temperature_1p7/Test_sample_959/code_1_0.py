# The problem asks for the sum of orders of outer automorphism groups of
# central extensions of a group G by C_31.

# Step 1: Identify the group G.
# G is given by the presentation:
# <a, b, c, d | a*b*a^-1 = b^2, b*c*b^-1 = c^2, c*d*c^-1 = d^2, d*a*d^-1 = a^2>
# This is a known Higman group which is proven to be the trivial group, G = {1}.

# Step 2: Determine the set of central extensions.
# The set of central extensions E of G by a cyclic group C is given by the
# second cohomology group H^2(G, C).
# Since G = {1}, H^2({1}, C_31) is the trivial group {0}.
# This means there is only one such central extension, up to isomorphism.

# Step 3: Identify the unique extension E.
# The extension is described by the short exact sequence 1 -> C -> E -> G -> 1.
# With C = C_31 and G = {1}, this becomes 1 -> C_31 -> E -> {1} -> 1,
# which implies E is isomorphic to C_31.

# Step 4: Compute the order of the outer automorphism group of E = C_31.
# The order is o(E) = |Out(E)| = |Aut(E) / Inn(E)|.
# For C_31 (an abelian group), the inner automorphism group Inn(C_31) is trivial.
# So, Out(C_31) is isomorphic to Aut(C_31).
# The order of the automorphism group of C_n is Euler's totient function, phi(n).

# Step 5: Calculate phi(31).
p = 31
# For any prime number p, phi(p) = p - 1.
order_of_out_E = p - 1

# Step 6: Compute the sum.
# Since there is only one extension E in the collection E, the sum is just o(E).
the_sum = order_of_out_E
