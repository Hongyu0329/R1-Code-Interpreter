    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction above 2, we first need to understand the conditions.\n\n1.  **Good Reduction**: A hyperelliptic curve of the form `z^2 = P(x)` has good reduction at a prime `p` if the reduced curve modulo `p` is non-singular. For primes `p` that do not divide the leading coefficient of `P(x)` (which is true for all primes `p>2` for all given options), this is equivalent to the condition that `p` does not divide the discriminant of the polynomial `P(x)`. The condition \"good reduction above 2\" means that the discriminant must not be divisible by any prime `p > 2`. In other words, the only possible prime factor of the discriminant is 2.\n\n2.  **Ordinary Reduction**: This is a more technical condition related to the structure of the Jacobian of the curve after reduction modulo `p`. A curve is ordinary at `p` if its `p`-rank is maximal (equal to the genus `g`).\n\nWe can first use the \"good reduction\" condition to eliminate choices. This condition is much easier to check. We will calculate the discriminant for each polynomial and inspect its prime factors. If a polynomial's discriminant has any prime factor other than 2, it fails the \"good reduction above 2\" condition and can be eliminated.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this analysis for each of the given curves.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef get_prime_factors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a set of prime factors of a given integer n.\n    The absolute value of n is used.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = abs(n)\n    if n in [0, 1]:\n        return set()\n    # sympy.factorint returns a dictionary of {prime: exponent}\n    return set(sympy.factorint(n).keys())\n\ndef analyze_curves():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given curves to find which one has good reduction for all primes > 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable x\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n\n    # Define the polynomials from the answer choices\n    # The polynomials are represented as a dictionary where the key is the choice letter\n    # and the value is the sympy expression for the polynomial P(x).\n    polynomials = {\n        'A': x**5 + 3,\n        'B': x**5 - 1,\n        'C': x**6 - 1,\n        'D': 2*x**5 + 2*x**3 + 1,\n        'E': 4*x**5 + 4*x**3 + x**2 + 4*x\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing which curve has good reduction for all odd primes (p > 2).\")\n    print(\"This requires the discriminant of the polynomial P(x) to only have 2 as a prime factor.\\n\")\n\n    correct_choice = None\n    correct_poly = None\n\n    # Iterate through each choice and its corresponding polynomial\n    for choice, p_poly in polynomials.items():\n        print(f\"--- Analyzing Choice {choice}: z^2 = {p_poly} ---\")\n\n        # Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial\n        disc = sympy.discriminant(p_poly, x)\n        print(f\"Discriminant: {disc}\")\n\n        # Get the prime factors of the absolute value of the discriminant\n        prime_factors = get_prime_factors(disc)\n        print(f\"Prime factors of discriminant: {prime_factors}\")\n\n        # Check if there are any odd prime factors\n        odd_prime_factors = {f for f in prime_factors if f != 2}\n\n        if not odd_prime_factors:\n            print(f\"Result: The discriminant is only divisible by 2.\")\n            print(f\"Choice {choice} has good reduction for all primes p > 2.\")\n            if correct_choice is None: # Store the first one found\n                correct_choice = choice\n                correct_poly = p_poly\n        else:\n            print(f\"Result: The discriminant is divisible by odd prime(s) {odd_prime_factors}.\")\n            print(f\"Choice {choice} has bad reduction at these primes and is eliminated.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 35 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Since only one option can be correct, the one that passes the good reduction test\n    # must also be ordinary for all p > 2.\n    if correct_choice:\n        print(f\"Conclusion: The only curve that has good reduction for all primes p > 2 is Choice {correct_choice}.\")\n        print(f\"The equation for this curve is:\")\n        # To satisfy the prompt \"output each number in the final equation\"\n        # we will print the equation's polynomial components.\n        p_coeffs = sympy.Poly(correct_poly, x).all_coeffs()\n        p_str = \" + \".join([f\"{coeff}*x^{deg}\" for deg, coeff in reversed(list(enumerate(reversed(p_coeffs)))) if coeff != 0])\n        print(f\"z^2 = {p_str.replace('*x^0', '').replace('*x^1', '*x')}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    analyze_curves()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
