# The user wants to find the second critical exponent for a decoupling
# inequality for the cone in R^3.

# One critical exponent is given as p=4, which is the Stein-Tomas exponent.
# The other critical exponent in restriction and decoupling theory for dimension d
# is given by the formula p = 2d / (d-1).
# This exponent arises from multilinear restriction theory and is related to the
# Kakeya conjecture.

# We are in R^3, so the dimension d is 3.
d = 3

# Calculate the critical exponent p using the formula.
p_numerator = 2 * d
p_denominator = d - 1
p = p_numerator / p_denominator

# Print the calculation and the result.
# The final output will be formatted as requested.
print(f"The dimension is d = {d}.")
print(f"The formula for the critical exponent is p = 2d / (d - 1).")
print(f"Plugging in d = {d}, we get:")
print(f"p = (2 * {d}) / ({d} - 1)")
print(f"p = {p_numerator} / {p_denominator}")
print(f"p = {p}")

print("\nThe other critical exponent is 3.")
