    "This is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation. I will solve it step-by-step.\n\n**1. Separate the variables:**\nThe given equation is $x'(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$.\nWe can separate the variables $x$ and $t$ by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side.\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n\n**2. Integrate both sides:**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation.\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nThe integration results in:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\n**3. Apply the initial condition:**\nWe use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to find the value of C. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\n**4. Find the particular solution:**\nNow we substitute the value of C back into the integrated equation to get the particular solution for this initial value problem.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo solve for $x(t)$, we can first get a common denominator on the right side:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{4t^2 - 8t + 1}{8} $$\nAnd then solve for $x(t)$:\n$$ x(t) = -\\frac{8}{4t^2 - 8t + 1} $$\n\n**5. Calculate x(1):**\nFinally, we substitute $t=1$ into the expression for $x(t)$ to find $x(1)$.\n$$ x(1) = -\\frac{8}{4(1)^2 - 8(1) + 1} $$\nThis final calculation will be performed by the Python script below.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# We are calculating x(1) using the derived formula:\n# x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1)\nt = 1\n\n# Define the components of the formula\nnumerator = -8\n# Calculate the denominator by substituting t=1\nterm1 = 4 * (t**2)\nterm2 = -8 * t\nterm3 = 1\ndenominator = term1 + term2 + term3\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = Fraction(numerator, denominator)\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation\nprint(f\"We need to find x(1) using the equation x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1).\")\nprint(f\"Substituting t = 1:\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / (4*({t})^2 - 8*({t}) + 1)\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({term1} - 8 + {term3})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({denominator})\")\nprint(f\"The final result is: x(1) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
