    Calculates the n-compactness value [X] for the space X = [0,1]^3.

    The value [X] represents the minimum n such that there exists an open
    sub-basis for X where every cover by sub-basis elements has a subcover
    of size n or fewer. This is known as the sub-basis compactness number.

    The solution proceeds in two steps:
    1.  Recall the known result for the n-dimensional cube, [0,1]^n. The
        formula is [[0,1]^n] = n + 1.
    2.  Apply this formula to the specific case of the 3-cube, where n=3.
