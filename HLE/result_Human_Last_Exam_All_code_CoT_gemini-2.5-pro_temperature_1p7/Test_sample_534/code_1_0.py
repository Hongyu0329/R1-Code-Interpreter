    Solves the problem of finding the number of components of the specified set.

    The problem asks for the number of connected components of the set K, which is
    the intersection of all compact connected neighborhoods of the point a = (0,1,0)
    in the space X.

    Let's analyze the topology of the space X at point a.

    1.  The space X consists of a handle [0,1] on the x-axis and several copies
        of a shape P attached at specific x-coordinates given by a set S.
        The point a = (0,1,0) is located on the copy of P at x=0. It is an
        endpoint of a line segment within this copy of P.

    2.  We consider two cases for the set S = {0, ..., 1/4, 1/2, 1}:
        a) S is a finite set {0, 1/4, 1/2, 1}. In this case, the space X is
           locally connected at point a. This allows for the construction of
           arbitrarily small compact connected neighborhoods around a. The
           intersection of all such neighborhoods is just the point {a}.

        b) S is an infinite set with 0 as a limit point (e.g., S = {1/2^n} U {0}).
           In this case, the space is not locally connected at a. Any neighborhood
           of 'a' contains points from other copies of P that are arbitrarily
           close. Any *connected* neighborhood must therefore contain paths linking
           'a' to these other points. Any such path must go down to the "handle"
           on the x-axis and back up. This forces every connected neighborhood
           to contain the entire base segment of the P-shape at x=0, on which 'a'
           lies. The intersection of all such neighborhoods is this base segment,
           which is {(0, y, 0) | y in [0, 1]}.

    3.  In Case (a), the resulting set K is a single point, {a}.
    4.  In Case (b), the resulting set K is a line segment.

    Both a single point and a line segment are connected sets. Therefore, in either
    case, the set K has exactly one connected component.
