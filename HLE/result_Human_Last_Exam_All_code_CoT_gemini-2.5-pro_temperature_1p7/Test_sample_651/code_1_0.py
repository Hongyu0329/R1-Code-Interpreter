    # The problem is solved by analyzing the geometry for a small angle theta.
    # The final value is derived analytically.

    # Let M(theta) be the supremum of the angle alpha.
    # Our analysis shows that for small theta > 0, M(theta) can be calculated as follows:

    print("Step 1: Define the relationship between the angle alpha and the trajectory direction psi.")
    print("   - The trajectory direction is psi, ranging from approximately -theta/4 to 5*theta/4 for small theta.")
    print("   - The direction of the inner normal to side A is pi + theta/2.")

    print("     alpha = pi - alpha_phys")
    print("   - alpha_phys is given by |psi - theta/2|.")
    print("   - Therefore, alpha(psi) = pi - |psi - theta/2|")

    print("Step 2: Express the supremum M(theta) in terms of alpha_phys.")
    print("   - To find the supremum of alpha, we must find the infimum (minimum) of alpha_phys.")
    print("   - M(theta) = sup(alpha) = sup(pi - |psi - theta/2|) = pi - inf(|psi - theta/2|)")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 3: Find the infimum of alpha_phys.")
    print("   - The range of possible trajectory directions psi is [-theta/4, 5*theta/4] for small theta.")
    print("   - The expression to minimize is |psi - theta/2|.")
    print("   - Since theta/2 is within the interval [-theta/4, 5*theta/4], the minimum value is achieved when psi = theta/2.")
    min_val = 0
