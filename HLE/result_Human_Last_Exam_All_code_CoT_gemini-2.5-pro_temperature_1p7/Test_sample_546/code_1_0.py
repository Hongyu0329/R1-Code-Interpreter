# The problem, after extensive simplification using number theory (specifically modular arithmetic and the Chinese Remainder Theorem),
# reduces to calculating 2 raised to the power of 81.
# The large prime number p and the complex expressions are structured in a way that the result is independent of p.

# Final equation to compute is f(p) = 2^81

base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result
result = base ** exponent

# Per the instructions, we output the numbers in the final equation.
# The final simplified form of f(p) is 2^81.
# The result is this value.
