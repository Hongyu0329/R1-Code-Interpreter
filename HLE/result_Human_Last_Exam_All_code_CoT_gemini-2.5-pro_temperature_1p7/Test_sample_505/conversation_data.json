    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits, we first need to understand how they are encoded in a surface code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Establish the Rule:** The number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a single, contiguous planar patch of surface code is equal to the number of holes within that patch. A patch with no holes functions as a quantum memory but does not encode a logical qubit on its own (`k=0`).\n2.  **Sum the Qubits:** For multiple, separate patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each individual patch.\n3.  **Apply to the Problem:** We are given two patches and a total of two holes to distribute among them. Let `h1` be the number of holes in the first patch and `h2` be the number of holes in the second.\n    *   Logical qubits in patch 1 = `k1 = h1`\n    *   Logical qubits in patch 2 = `k2 = h2`\n    *   Total logical qubits = `k_total = k1 + k2 = h1 + h2`\n4.  **Use the Constraint:** We know that the total number of holes is two: `h1 + h2 = 2`.\n5.  **Calculate the Maximum:** By substituting the constraint into our equation for total qubits, we find `k_total = 2`. Since the total number of holes is constant, the total number of logical qubits is also constant regardless of how the holes are distributed. The maximum is therefore simply this total.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to formalize this calculation and explicitly show the outcomes for all possible distributions of the two holes.\n\n```python\ndef solve_surface_code_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for a given number\n    of surface code patches and holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_patches = 2\n    total_holes = 2\n\n    # The number of logical qubits (k) encoded in a single planar patch\n    # is equal to the number of holes (h) in it. k = h.\n    # For multiple patches, the total logical qubits is the sum of the\n    # qubits from each patch.\n    # k_total = h1 + h2 + ...\n    #\n    # Given h1 + h2 = total_holes, it follows that k_total = total_holes.\n    # Therefore, the number of logical qubits is fixed by the total number of holes,\n    # regardless of their distribution.\n\n    max_logical_qubits = total_holes\n\n    print(f\"Configuration: {num_patches} patches of surface code and a total of {total_holes} holes.\")\n    print(\"Rule: The number of logical qubits encoded in a patch is equal to its number of holes.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's check all possible distributions of holes:\")\n\n    # Iterate through all possible ways to distribute the holes in the first patch\n    for h1 in range(total_holes + 1):\n        h2 = total_holes - h1\n        \n        # Calculate the total logical qubits for this distribution\n        k1 = h1\n        k2 = h2\n        k_total = k1 + k2\n        \n        print(f\"\\n  Distribution:\")\n        print(f\"    - Patch 1 has {h1} holes, encoding {k1} logical qubits.\")\n        print(f\"    - Patch 2 has {h2} holes, encoding {k2} logical qubits.\")\n        print(f\"  Equation for total logical qubits:\")\n        # Final equation with numbers, as requested\n        print(f\"    Total = {k1} + {k2} = {k_total}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40)\n    print(f\"As shown, the total number of logical qubits is always {max_logical_qubits}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits is {max_logical_qubits}.\")\n\nsolve_surface_code_qubits()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
