    The solution to this problem is derived from the topological properties of the Stone-Cech remainder N*.

    1.  The number of accumulation points must be at least 2.
        - If there were only one accumulation point, the sequence of ultrafilters {u_i} would have to converge.
        - The condition P_i in u_i for a disjoint partition {P_i} forces all the ultrafilters u_i to be distinct.
        - A fundamental theorem states that no sequence of distinct points can converge in N*.
        - This is a contradiction, so there cannot be only one accumulation point.

    2.  It is possible to construct a case with exactly 2 accumulation points.
        - This is done by carefully choosing the partition {P_i} and the ultrafilters {u_i} based on two
          target accumulation points, say v1 and v2.
        - The construction ensures that one infinite subsequence of {u_i} is "guided" towards v1 and another
          disjoint infinite subsequence is "guided" towards v2.
        - This results in a set of accumulation points of size 2.

    Combining these facts, the smallest possible number of accumulation points is 2.
