    # Let S be the number of compactifications for a given space X.
    # We want to find the minimum possible value of S.

    # Step 1: Analyze the structure of X.
    # X is a non-degenerate, locally-connected, compact metric space.
    # A known theorem states that such a space is a finite union of its
    # connected components, which are Peano continua.

    # Step 2: Consider the case where X is connected (a Peano continuum).
    # If X is a non-degenerate Peano continuum, it contains infinitely many
    # subcontinua. For example, if X is an interval [0,1], its subcontinua
    # are all closed intervals [a,b] within it.
    # A theorem by Whyburn states that the number of compactifications S is
    # equal to the number of subcontinua of X.
    # Thus, for a non-degenerate connected X, S is infinite.

    # Step 3: Deduce the structure of X for S to be finite.
    # To have a finite number of compactifications, X must have a finite
    # number of subcontinua. This implies that all of its connected
    # components must be single points (degenerate Peano continua).
    # Therefore, X must be a finite set of points.
    # Let n be the number of points in X.
    
    # Step 4: Use the non-degenerate property of X.
    # X is non-degenerate, meaning it has more than one point.
    # So, the number of points n must be at least 2.
    n_lower_bound = 2
    
    # Step 5: Find the number of compactifications for an n-point space.
    # A 1998 theorem by Bellamy and Diamond shows that for an n-point space X,
    # the number of compactifications S is exactly n.
    # Equation: S = n

    # Step 6: Find the minimum value for S.
    # We need to find the minimum value of S, which is the minimum value of n,
    # subject to the constraint n >= n_lower_bound.
    # The final equation is min(S) = min(n) for n >= 2.
    
    min_n = n_lower_bound
    min_S = min_n
