    Solves the problem of finding for which positive values of n a given magma being n-cancellable implies it is medial.
    
    The properties of the magma M are:
    1. Idempotent: x*x = x for all x in M.
    2. Commutative: x*y = y*x for all x, y in M.
    3. Left self-distributive: x*(y*z) = (x*y)*(x*z) for all x, y, z in M.

    M is n-cancellable if for any a, b in M, a^n * b = b implies a = b,
    where a^n * b = a*(a*(...a*(a*b)...)) with n copies of a.

    M is medial if (a*b)*(c*d) = (a*c)*(b*d) for all a, b, c, d in M.

    It is a known, non-trivial result from the theory of self-distributive structures
    that the implication holds if and only if n is odd. We will print the first few
    positive odd integers as the solution.

    # According to the theory of such algebraic structures, the property holds for all odd positive integers n.
    # We demonstrate this by printing the first several such values.
