    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts**:\n    *   A **binary operation** on a set S is a function that takes any two elements from S (say, `x` and `y`) and returns an element of S. For a set with 3 elements, S = {0, 1, 2}, this can be represented by a 3x3 multiplication table (also known as a Cayley table).\n    *   A **commutative** operation means that for any `x` and `y`, `x * y = y * x`. This implies the multiplication table is symmetric about its main diagonal.\n    *   An **associative** operation means that for any `x`, `y`, and `z`, `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)`.\n\n2.  **Count the Commutative Operations**:\n    *   Because of the symmetry from the commutative property, we only need to define the values on and above the main diagonal of the 3x3 table. These are 6 unique entries: (0\\*0), (0\\*1), (0\\*2), (1\\*1), (1\\*2), and (2\\*2).\n    *   Each of these 6 entries can be any of the 3 elements in the set {0, 1, 2}.\n    *   This gives a total of 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3‚Å∂ = 729 possible commutative operations.\n\n3.  **Check for Associativity**:\n    *   Counting the associative operations directly with a simple formula is very difficult. A more practical approach is to check each of the 729 commutative operations to see if it also satisfies the associative property.\n    *   I will write a Python script to perform this exhaustive check.\n\n4.  **Algorithm**:\n    *   The script will loop through all 729 possible commutative operations.\n    *   For each operation, it will test the associativity rule `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)` for all 27 possible triplets of (x, y, z) where x, y, and z can be 0, 1, or 2.\n    *   A counter will be initialized to zero. It will be incremented only for those operations that satisfy the associativity test for all 27 triplets.\n    *   Finally, the script will print the total count.\n\nThis method will systematically find the exact number of operations that meet both criteria.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of binary operations on a set of 3 elements\n    that are both associative and commutative.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    elements = (0, 1, 2)\n    num_elements = len(elements)\n\n    # A commutative operation on 3 elements is defined by 6 values in the\n    # upper triangle of its Cayley table: (0*0, 0*1, 0*2, 1*1, 1*2, 2*2).\n    # We iterate through all 3^6 = 729 possibilities.\n    # The variable 'p' will hold a tuple representing one such possibility.\n    # e.g., p = (v00, v01, v02, v11, v12, v22)\n    for p in itertools.product(elements, repeat=6):\n\n        # Create the full 3x3 commutative Cayley table from the 6 values.\n        table = [\n            [p[0], p[1], p[2]],\n            [p[1], p[3], p[4]],\n            [p[2], p[4], p[5]]\n        ]\n\n        # Define the operation using the generated table.\n        def op(a, b):\n            return table[a][b]\n\n        # Check for associativity: (x*y)*z must equal x*(y*z) for all x, y, z.\n        is_associative = True\n        for x in elements:\n            for y in elements:\n                for z in elements:\n                    # If we find even one case where associativity fails,\n                    # we can stop checking this operation and move to the next.\n                    if op(op(x, y), z) != op(x, op(y, z)):\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n\n        # If the operation passed all associativity checks, we increment our counter.\n        if is_associative:\n            count += 1\n\n    print(f\"Number of associative and commutative binary operations: {count}\")\n\n# Run the calculation and print the result.\ncount_associative_commutative_operations()\n```\n<<<74>>>"
