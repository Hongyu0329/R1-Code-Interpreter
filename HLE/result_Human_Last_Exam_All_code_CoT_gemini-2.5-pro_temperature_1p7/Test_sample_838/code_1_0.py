    # --- Step 1 ---
    print("Step 1: [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene + Potassium tert-butoxide -> Product A")
    print("Reaction Type: E2 Elimination")
    print("Explanation: The starting material, [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, is a secondary alkyl halide. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 elimination reaction.")
    print("Regioselectivity: A bulky base prefers to abstract the most accessible proton. This leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product.")
    print("The two possible products are 1-phenylbut-2-ene (Zaitsev) and 4-phenylbut-1-ene (Hofmann). The major product will be the Hofmann product.")
    print("Outcome: The reaction forms a double bond at the end of the chain, and the chiral center at carbon 3 is destroyed.")
    print("\nProduct A is: 4-phenylbut-1-ene\n")
    
    # --- Step 2 ---
    print("--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n")
    print("Step 2: Product A (4-phenylbut-1-ene) + 1. BH3/THF, 2. H2O2/NaOH -> Product B")
    print("Reaction Type: Hydroboration-Oxidation")
    print("Explanation: This is a two-step process that adds water across a double bond.")
    print("Regioselectivity: The reaction proceeds with anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. This means the hydroxyl (-OH) group adds to the less substituted carbon of the double bond, and a hydrogen atom adds to the more substituted carbon.")
    print("Outcome: The -OH group is added to carbon 1 of the butene chain.")
    print("\nProduct B is: 4-phenylbutan-1-ol\n")
    
    # --- Step 3 ---
    print("--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n")
    print("Step 3: Product B (4-phenylbutan-1-ol) + PBr3 -> Product C")
    print("Reaction Type: Alcohol to Alkyl Bromide Conversion")
    print("Explanation: Phosphorous tribromide (PBr3) is a standard reagent used to convert primary and secondary alcohols into alkyl bromides. The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism for primary alcohols like 4-phenylbutan-1-ol.")
    print("Outcome: The hydroxyl group (-OH) at carbon 1 is replaced by a bromine atom (-Br).")
    print("\nProduct C is: 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane\n")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n")
    print("Identity of the Final Product, C:")
    print("\nThe IUPAC name for product C is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.")
    print("\nChirality Explanation:")
    print("The molecule 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane has no chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, no carbon atom meets that criterion.")
    print("The original stereocenter in the starting material, (3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, was located at carbon 3. This stereocenter was eliminated during the first step (E2 elimination) to form the achiral alkene, 4-phenylbut-1-ene. Since all subsequent intermediates and reactions did not introduce a new chiral center, the final product C is achiral.")
