    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to rely on the classification theorem of finite Coxeter groups. This theorem states that any finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the direct product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nOur task, therefore, boils down to a combinatorial problem: we must find all the ways to write the number 4 as a sum of positive integers (i.e., find all integer partitions of 4). For each partition, we then count how many distinct combinations of irreducible Weyl groups correspond to it.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  List the irreducible Weyl groups of rank up to 4. The types are A, B, D, F, G.\n    *   Rank 1: A₁\n    *   Rank 2: A₂, G₂\n    *   Rank 3: A₃, B₃ (note: D₃ is isomorphic to A₃, and C₃ to B₃)\n    *   Rank 4: A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄ (note: C₄ is isomorphic to B₄)\n2.  List all integer partitions of 4:\n    *   4\n    *   3 + 1\n    *   2 + 2\n    *   2 + 1 + 1\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n3.  For each partition, we will find all possible products of irreducible Weyl groups and sum the counts. The Python code below will systematically enumerate and count these combinations.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and lists all non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups by rank.\n    # Note: B_n and C_n are isomorphic.
