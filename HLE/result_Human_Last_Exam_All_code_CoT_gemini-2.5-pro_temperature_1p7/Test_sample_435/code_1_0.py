    line_1 = "Based on its known biological roles, culturing CAR T cells with Interleukin-15 (IL-15) would be predicted to **increase** cytokine release upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15."
    
    reasoning_title = "\nReasoning:"
    
    reason_1 = "1. **Enhanced Survival and Proliferation:** IL-15 is a potent survival factor for T cells. It promotes robust proliferation and persistence. CAR T cells manufactured with IL-15 are therefore more numerous, healthier, and have a greater capacity to persist after infusion, leading to a larger population of cells available to respond to target antigens."
    
    reason_2 = "2. **Favorable Phenotype:** Manufacturing with IL-15 tends to push T cells towards a less differentiated, central memory (Tcm) or memory stem cell (Tscm) phenotype. These memory cells have a superior capacity for self-renewal and can mount a more potent and sustained response upon re-encountering an antigen, which includes vigorous cytokine production."
    
    reason_3 = "3. **Potent Effector Function:** The combination of better survival and a memory-like phenotype results in a CAR T cell product that is more functionally potent. When these cells are activated by their target antigen, this heightened potential translates directly into a more robust effector response, a key component of which is the release of cytokines like Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), TNF-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-2."
    
    conclusion = "\nConclusion: Therefore, the overall effect of IL-15 is an enhancement of the CAR T cells' functional fitness, which would manifest as a greater magnitude of cytokine release when the cells perform their designated anti-tumor activity."
