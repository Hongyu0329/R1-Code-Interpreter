    "In poker, particularly in No-Limit Texas Hold'em, the decision to open-raise a hand depends heavily on your position at the table, the stack sizes, and the action before you.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Position:** The \"button\" is the last position to act post-flop, which is a massive strategic advantage. This allows you to play a much wider range of hands profitably compared to any other position.\n2.  **Consult GTO (Game Theory Optimal) Strategy:** For a 100 big blind, rake-free cash game, standard GTO pre-flop charts are the industry standard for defining which hands are profitable to open. These charts show that the button should be opening a very wide range, often between 45% and 50% of all possible hands.\n3.  **Rank the Suited Jacks:** Suited hands containing a Jack (JXs) are ranked by their second card (the kicker). The order from best to worst is JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n4.  **Identify the Cutoff:** According to GTO solvers, the positional advantage of the button is so significant that *all* suited Jack combinations are considered profitable opens. Even J2s, the weakest of the bunch, has enough equity and playability (the potential to make flushes, straights, and top pairs) to be a standard open-raise.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since all suited Jacks are profitable to open, the \"worst\" one that you should still include in your opening range is the one with the lowest rank, which is J2s.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to formally state this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button in a 100BB cash game.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Explain the poker context ---\n    print(\"In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the player on the Button has a significant positional advantage.\")\n    print(\"This advantage means they can profitably play a very wide range of hands (around 45-50%).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Rank the hands in question ---\n    print(\"Suited Jack hands are ranked by their kicker.
