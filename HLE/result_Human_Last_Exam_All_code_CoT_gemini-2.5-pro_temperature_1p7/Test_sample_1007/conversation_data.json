    "To determine which ballet step ends in the same leg position as it starts, I will analyze the mechanics of each option based on standard ballet terminology. My plan is to encode this analysis into a Python script. The script will define each step and its properties, then programmatically identify the step that can be performed without changing the feet from the starting to the ending fifth position. Finally, it will print a summary of the analysis and the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same\n    starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the properties of each step.\n    # The key property is 'changes_feet'.
