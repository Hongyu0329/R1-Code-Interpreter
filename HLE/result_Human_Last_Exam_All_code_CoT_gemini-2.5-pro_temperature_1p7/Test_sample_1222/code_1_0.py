    Analyzes the condition on d for the quiver-Taft map property.

    The property that `sigma(a) != 0` must hold for all arrows `a` (for any non-zero sigma)
    is a strong condition. A necessary requirement is to avoid any situation where `sigma(a)`
    is forced to be 0 for some `a`.

    This can happen if the reflection `g` fixes an arrow `a` (i.e., g.a = a).
    Assuming lambda is not 1, this forces sigma(a) = 0.
    A sufficient condition to prevent any arrow from being fixed is for `g` to have no fixed vertices.

    A vertex `i` is fixed by `g` if `i = (n - d - i) % n`, which is `2i = (n - d) % n`.
    If `n` is assumed to be even, this equation has no solution for `i` if and only if `n - d` is odd.
    Since `n` is even, this means `d` must be odd.

    Therefore, the condition on `d` is that d must be odd (assuming n is even).
