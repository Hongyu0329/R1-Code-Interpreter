    "This task requires tracing the etymological development of a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) word through several stages into its descendants in old Germanic languages. This involves applying a series of historical sound change rules. I will model this process in a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Start with the given PIE form, `*seh₂gieti`.\n2.  **Proto-Germanic:** Apply the sound changes that occurred between PIE and Proto-Germanic. This includes laryngeal coloration (`*eh₂ > *ā`), Grimm's Law (`*g > *k` and `*t > *þ`), the shift of PIE `*ā` to PGmc `*ō`, and the remodeling of the PIE yod-present verb into a Germanic Class 1 weak verb.\n3.  **Old Norse:** Start from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic form and apply sound changes specific to the history of North Germanic, such as i-umlaut (`*ō > œ`) and the development of the 3rd person singular verb ending.\n4.  **Old English:** Start from the Proto-Germanic form and apply changes specific to West Germanic and Old English, including i-umlaut (`*ō > ē`), the palatalization of velar consonants (`*k > ċ`), and the development of the verb ending.\n5.  **Old High German:** Start from the Proto-Germanic form and apply changes specific to Old High German, including the High German Consonant Shift, diphthongization of long vowels (`*ō > uo`), and the development of its verb endings.\n\nThe Python code will print out each step of these transformations.\n\n```python\ndef trace_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the PIE word *seh₂gieti to Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n    \"\"\"\n    pie_form = \"*seh₂gieti\"\n    print(f\"Starting with the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form: {pie_form}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Proto-Germanic ---\n    print(\"--- 1.
