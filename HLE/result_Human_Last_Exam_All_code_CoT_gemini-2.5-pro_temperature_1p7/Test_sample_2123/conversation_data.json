    "This is a classic logic and language puzzle that can be solved by tracing a chain of associations. The Python code below will simulate the thought process to arrive at the solution. The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** The core clues are \"wide boulevards of Vienna,\" \"Russian translation,\" and \"English poet's surname.\"\n2.  **Form a Hypothesis:** The solution likely lies in a pun or a phonetic similarity between a word related to the Vienna boulevards (potentially a loanword used in Russian) and a poet's name.\n3.  **Trace the Connection:** The magnificent buildings on Vienna's boulevards are famous for their ornate, sometimes ostentatious, decorative style. The German term for this, which is also used in Russian, is \"Kitsch.\"\n4.  **Find the Phonetic Match:** We will search for a famous English poet whose surname sounds similar to \"Kitsch.\"\n5.  **Identify the Poet:** The surname \"Keats\" is a very close phonetic match.\n\nThe script will walk through these steps to find the name.\n\n```python\nimport unicodedata\n\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a riddle by simulating a chain of linguistic and cultural deductions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the key concepts from the riddle.\n    location = \"wide boulevards of Vienna\"\n    language_context = \"Russian\"\n    target = \"English poet's surname\"\n\n    print(f\"Starting analysis with the clue: '{location}'.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Deduce a key term associated with the location's notable features.\n    # The architecture on Vienna's boulevards from the late 19th century is often described with a specific term.\n    print(\"Deduction 1: Vienna's boulevards are lined with ornate, grand buildings.\")\n    key_artistic_term = \"Kitsch\"\n    print(f\"Deduction 2: A German artistic term to describe this, also used in {language_context}, is '{key_artistic_term}'.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find a phonetic match among English poets.\n    # The surname \"Keats\" is phonetically very similar to \"Kitsch\", especially considering\n    # how loanwords are adapted and pronounced.\n    poets_surnames = [\"Shelley\", \"Byron\", \"Wordsworth\", \"Keats\", \"Auden\"]\n    target_surname = \"Keats\"\n\n    print(f\"Deduction 3: Searching for an English poet's surname in {poets_surnames} that sounds like '{key_artistic_term}'.\")\n    \n    # We can use a simple phonetic comparison for this demonstration.\n    # In a real-world scenario, a more complex phonetic algorithm like Soundex or Metaphone would be used.\n    # For this riddle, the connection is direct.\n    if target_surname in poets_surnames:\n        print(f\"Match found: The surname '{target_surname}' is phonetically similar to '{key_artistic_term}'.\")\n        print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n        print(target_surname)\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not find a matching poet.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n<<<Keats>>>"
