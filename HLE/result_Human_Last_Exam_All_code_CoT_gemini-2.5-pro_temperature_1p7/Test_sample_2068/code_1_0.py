# Define the constants from the problem description
# Number of interconnected systems

# As derived in the explanation, the solvability condition for the system
# leads to a set of n ellipses that define the valid initial conditions.
# Based on the plausible assumption that the inhomogeneous term in the solvability
# condition simplifies to 1, the area of each of these ellipses is given by
# Area_j = pi * A_j * B_j / (n - 1).

# S is the sum of the areas for all j from 1 to n.
# S = n * pi * A_j * B_j / (n - 1)

# The final value to be computed is S / (2025 * pi), which is equivalent to
# S / (n * pi).
# Final_Value = (n * pi * A_j * B_j / (n - 1)) / (n * pi)
# Final_Value = (A_j * B_j) / (n - 1)

# Calculate the result
final_value = (A_j * B_j) / (n - 1)

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# Here is the calculation using the given numbers.
