# The riddle is solved by interpreting the haiku as a number base problem.
# 1. The title "The Bays" is a pun on "The Base".
# 2. The haiku provides two numbers: 8 (from "August") and 30 (from "Twice fifteen").
# 3. "winds of change" implies a base conversion.
# 4. "A divine one yields" sets the condition that the number in the new base is represented as '10',
#    since the sum of its digits (1 + 0) is 1.
# 5. The equation to find the base B for a number N is: N (base 10) = 10 (base B).
#    This resolves to N = 1 * B + 0, which means N = B.

# Numbers derived from the haiku
num_from_line1 = 8
num_from_line2 = 30

# Based on the logic N = B, the bases are the numbers themselves.
base1 = num_from_line1
base2 = num_from_line2

# The riddle asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# The equation is N = 1 * B + 0.
print(f"Finding the base for the first number, {num_from_line1}:")
print(f"{num_from_line1} = 1 * {base1} + 0")

print(f"\nFinding the base for the second number, {num_from_line2}:")
print(f"{num_from_line2} = 1 * {base2} + 0")

# The final step is to provide the answers (the names of the bases) in alphabetical order.
answer_words = ["eight", "thirty"]
answer_words.sort()

print("\nThe final answer is the names of the bases, in alphabetical order:")
print(", ".join(answer_words))
