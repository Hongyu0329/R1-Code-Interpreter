    "This is an advanced question from algebraic geometry. The \"different types of stable reduction\" for curves of a given genus correspond to the combinatorial types of stable nodal curves of that same arithmetic genus. These types are classified by their dual graphs, which are decorated with the geometric genera of the components.\n\nI will provide a Python script that enumerates these types for genus 2. The script will explain the mathematical rules for this classification and then print out each valid type with the calculations that confirm its validity.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **State the Rules**: The script will first define the two main conditions a curve's dual graph must satisfy:\n    *   **Arithmetic Genus Formula**: The curve's total arithmetic genus must be 2. This is calculated using the formula: `p_a = sum of component genera + number of loops/cycles in graph`. A more formal way is `p_a = sum(g_v) + |E| - |V| + 1`, where `g_v` is the genus of a component `v`, `|V|` is the number of components, and `|E|` is the number of nodes.\n    *   **Stability Condition**: Each component of the curve must be stable. For a component with geometric genus `g_v` and `n_v` nodes on it (which corresponds to the valence of the vertex `v` in the dual graph), the condition is `2*g_v - 2 + n_v > 0`.\n\n2.  **Enumerate Cases**: The script will then systematically check for all possible graph configurations (number of components, their genera, and how they are connected by nodes) that satisfy these two rules.\n\n3.  **Display Results**: For each valid type found, the script will print a description of the curve and the explicit calculations for its arithmetic genus and stability, showing how the numbers fit the formulas.\n\n4.  **Count and Conclude**: Finally, the script will provide a total count of the distinct types found.\n\n```python\ndef solve_genus_2_reduction_types():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function enumerates and explains the different types of stable reduction\n    for curves of genus 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script enumerates the types of stable nodal curves of arithmetic genus 2.\")\n    print(\"These correspond to the boundary strata of the Deligne-Mumford compactification M_2_bar.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"A curve is a stable curve of arithmetic genus 2 if:\")\n    print(\"1.
