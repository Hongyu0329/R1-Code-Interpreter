# The problem involves transfinite cardinals, which we represent as strings for demonstration.

# From the set-theoretic analysis, under the assumption 2^omega_1 = omega_2:
# delta_1 is the supremum of the set of regular cardinals lambda for which a tower of length lambda exists.
# We found that the set X of such lambda is {omega_2}.
# Therefore, delta_1 = sup({omega_2}) = omega_2.
delta_1 = "omega_2"

# delta_2 is the infimum of the set X.
# delta_2 = inf({omega_2}) = omega_2.
delta_2 = "omega_2"

# We need to calculate delta_1 + delta_2.
# In cardinal arithmetic, for any infinite cardinal kappa, kappa + kappa = kappa.
# Thus, omega_2 + omega_2 = omega_2.
result = "omega_2"

# Print the final equation with each term.
print(f"Let delta_1 be the supremum and delta_2 be the infimum of X.")
print(f"We have found that delta_1 = {delta_1} and delta_2 = {delta_2}.")
print(f"The calculation is: {delta_1} + {delta_2} = {result}")
