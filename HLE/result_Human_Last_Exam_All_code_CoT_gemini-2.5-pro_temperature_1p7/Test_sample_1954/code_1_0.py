# The problem is to find the minimax risk for estimating theta from n i.i.d.
# observations of X_i ~ Bin(n, theta) with squared error loss.
# As derived in the explanation, the minimax risk R is given by a formula
# dependent on 'n'. This script will define the components of this formula
# and print it out.

# The final formula is: R = 1 / (4 * (n + 1)^2)

# Define the numerical constants in the equation.
numerator = 1
coefficient = 4
constant_in_sum = 1
power = 2

# Print the final formula for the minimax risk R.
print("The formula for the minimax risk R in terms of n is:")
print(f"R = {numerator} / ({coefficient} * (n + {constant_in_sum})**{power})")
print("\nWhere:")
print(f"- {numerator} is the numerator of the fraction.")
print(f"- {coefficient} is the coefficient multiplying the parenthesis in the denominator.")
print(f"- 'n' is the number of i.i.d. observations.")
print(f"- {constant_in_sum} is the constant added to n inside the parenthesis.")
print(f"- {power} is the exponent to which the sum is raised.")

# Note: This code does not compute a numerical value because 'n' is a variable
# in the problem statement. It prints the derived symbolic formula.
