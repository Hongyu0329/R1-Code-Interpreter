    "Based on the described scene, the most iconic and fitting movie is **Footloose** (1984), produced by Paramount Pictures.\n\nIn a famous scene, the teenage protagonist, Ren McCormack (played by Kevin Bacon), engages in a game of \"chicken.\" While he is riding a tractor, not a pink bike, the core elements of your description match perfectly: a teenager defiantly pilots a vehicle directly toward another oncoming vehicle driven by a rival. It is a classic Hollywood scene, and it's possible the memory of a tractor has been conflated with a bike, a common vehicle in other teen films of that era.\n\n<<<Footloose>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
