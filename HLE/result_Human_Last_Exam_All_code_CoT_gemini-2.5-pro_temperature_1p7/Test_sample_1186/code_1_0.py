# Step 1: Define the parameters based on the problem description.
p = 43
n = 18
e = 3

# Step 2: Calculate the residue field degree f.
f = n // e

# Step 3: Calculate the size of the residue field, q = p^f.
# This value will be used in the formula for the number of classes.
q = p**f

# Step 4: The total number of equivalence classes is given by the formula q^7 * (q-1).
# We can also express this in terms of p directly: (p^f)^7 * (p^f - 1) = p^(7f) * (p^f - 1).
# With f=6, this is p^42 * (p^6 - 1).

# Let's define the components of the final equation: 43^42 * (43^6 - 1)
base = p
exp1 = 42
exp2 = 6

# Step 5: Calculate each part of the expression.
# First term: 43^42
term1 = base**exp1

# The term inside the parenthesis: 43^6
term_in_paren = base**exp2

# The second term: (43^6 - 1)
term2 = term_in_paren - 1

# Step 6: Calculate the final total number of classes.
total_classes = term1 * term2

# Step 7: Print the components of the equation and the final answer as requested.
