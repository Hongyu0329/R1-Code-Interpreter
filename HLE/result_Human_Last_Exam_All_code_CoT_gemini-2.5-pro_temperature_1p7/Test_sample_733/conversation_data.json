    "To solve this problem, I will determine which finite groups contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2. I'll first lay out the definitions, then formulate a plan to test candidate groups, and finally provide a Python script that implements this test. The script will systematically check groups and count how many satisfy the condition.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Define a \"Product-Free Set\"**: A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (including the case `x=y`), their product `x*y` is not in `S`. In other words, the intersection of `S` and `S*S` is empty.\n\n2.  **Define \"Maximal by Inclusion\"**: A product-free set `S` is maximal if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g` in `G` that is not in `S`, the new set `S âˆª {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n3.  **The Task**: We are looking for finite groups `G` that have a maximal product-free set `S` where the size of `S` is exactly 2.\n\n4.  **Verification Strategy**: I will write a Python script to perform the check.\n    *   The script will represent groups using their Cayley tables (multiplication tables).\n    *   For each group, the script will iterate through all subsets of size 2.\n    *   For each subset, it will first check if it's product-free.\n    *   If a subset is product-free, the script will then check if it's maximal by trying to add every other element from the group and verifying that the resulting set is no longer product-free.\n    *   If a group is found to have such a set, its name will be printed and a counter for unique groups will be incremented.\n\n5.  **Groups to Test**: Based on mathematical literature and my own analysis, the candidate groups to check are:\n    *   Cyclic groups: `C3`, `C4`, `C5`\n    *   Other Abelian groups: `C2 x C2` (Klein four-group)\n    *   Non-Abelian groups: `D10` (Dihedral group of order 10) and `Q12` (Dicyclic group of order 12).\n    I will include `C3` as a negative control to ensure the code correctly identifies groups that do *not* have the property.\n\nThe final Python code will construct the Cayley tables for these groups and run the verification logic. The number of groups for which the condition holds will be the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_product_free(s, cayley_table):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a set s is product-free given a cayley_table.\"\"\"\n    s_set = set(s)\n    for x in s:\n        for y in s:\n            product = cayley_table[x][y]\n            if product in s_set:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef find_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_2(group_name, cayley_table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds if a group contains a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n    The group elements are represented as integers from 0 to n-1.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(cayley_table)\n    elements = list(range(n))\n    \n    # Iterate through all subsets of size 2\n    for s in itertools.combinations(elements, 2):\n        s_list = list(s)\n        \n        # 1.
