    "Of course. Here is the plan and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to find the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice (Manhattan lattice), which is denoted as `a(10)`. A self-avoiding walk is a path on the lattice, starting from the origin, that never visits the same point more than once.\n\n2.  **Choose the Method:** There's no simple mathematical formula for `a(n)`. The most direct way to solve this for a small number of steps like 10 is to computationally enumerate all possible valid walks. We will use a recursive algorithm, also known as backtracking, to explore all potential paths.\n\n3.  **Implement the Algorithm:**\n    *   We'll create a recursive function, let's call it `count_walks(steps_remaining, current_position, visited_path)`.\n    *   The `visited_path` will be stored as a `set` for efficient lookups to check if a point has already been visited.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when `steps_remaining` is 0. This means we have successfully found one complete walk, so the function returns 1.\n    *   In the recursive step, the function will try to move in all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the `current_position`. For each potential move, it checks if the new position is in the `visited_path`.\n    *   If the new position is not yet visited, the function calls itself with the updated `steps_remaining`, the `new_position`, and the `visited_path` including the new point.\n    *   The function sums the results from all valid moves to get the total number of walks from the current state.\n\n4.  **Apply an Optimization:** The lattice has rotational symmetry. The number of walks starting with a move to the right is the same as the number of walks starting with a move up, down, or left. We can leverage this to reduce the computation.\n    *   Instead of starting at (0,0) and exploring 4 initial moves, we will calculate the number of walks for just one initial direction (e.g., right, to position (1,0)) and multiply the final result by 4.\n    *   This means we will be looking for the number of 9-step walks starting from (1,0), with the constraint that the path cannot revisit (0,0).\n\n5.  **Final Output:** The script will execute this plan, calculate the result, and print the final equation showing how the total number was computed.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice,\n    using a recursive backtracking algorithm with a symmetry optimization.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The total number of steps for the walk.\n    total_steps = 10\n\n    def count_walks_recursive(steps_remaining, current_pos, path):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts valid self-avoiding walks from a given state.\n\n        Args:\n            steps_remaining: Number of steps left to take.\n            current_pos: The current (x, y) coordinates of the walk.\n            path: A set of (x, y) tuples representing the visited points.\n\n        Returns:\n            The total number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If there are no steps left, we have found one valid walk.\n        if steps_remaining == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        x, y = current_pos\n        count = 0\n\n        # Explore the 4 possible moves: right, left, up, down.\n        for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:\n            next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)\n            \n            # Check if the next position has already been visited.\n            if next_pos not in path:\n                # If the position is new, continue the walk from there.\n                # We pass a new set `path | {next_pos}` to the recursive call.\n                count += count_walks_recursive(\n                    steps_remaining - 1, \n                    next_pos, \n                    path | {next_pos}\n                )\n        \n        return count\n\n    # Optimization: Due to lattice symmetry, we can calculate the number of walks\n    # for one initial direction (e.g., right) and multiply the result by 4.\n    # The walk starts at (0,0), and the first step is to (1,0).\n    # We then need to count the number of (total_steps - 1) walks from (1,0).\n    \n    # The starting point of the walk.\n    origin = (0, 0)\n    # The position after the first fixed step to the right.\n    first_step_pos = (1, 0)\n    \n    # The initial path for the recursion already contains the origin and the first step.\n    initial_path = {origin, first_step_pos}\n    \n    # Number of steps remaining after the first one.\n    steps_after_first = total_steps - 1\n\n    # Calculate the number of walks for one starting direction.\n    count_one_direction = count_walks_recursive(\n        steps_after_first, \n        first_step_pos, \n        initial_path\n    )\n    \n    # The total number of walks is 4 times the count for one direction.\n    total_walks = 4 * count_one_direction\n    \n    print(f\"To find a({total_steps}), we calculate the number of walks for one initial direction and multiply by 4.\")\n    print(f\"Number of {total_steps}-step walks starting with a move to the right: {count_one_direction}\")\n    print(f\"a({total_steps}) = 4 * {count_one_direction} = {total_walks}\")\n\n# Execute the solver function\nsolve()\n<<<44100>>>\n```"
