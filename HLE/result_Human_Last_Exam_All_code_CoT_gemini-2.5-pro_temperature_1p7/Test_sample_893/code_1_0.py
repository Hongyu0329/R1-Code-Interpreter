Let X(H) be the set of graphs that do not contain a given connected graph H as a subgraph. The order is the subgraph relation. We need to decide if for every choice of connected H, the set X(H) has a maximal element.

- If we choose H = K_1 (a graph with one vertex and no edges), then X(K_1) contains graphs with no vertices. Assuming the null graph (with no vertices or edges) is a valid graph, X(K_1) = {null graph}. This set has a single element, which is therefore maximal.
- If we choose H = K_2 (a graph with two vertices and one edge), then X(K_2) is the set of all graphs with no edges (i.e., empty graphs E_n). For any graph E_n in X(K_2), the graph E_{n+1} (disjointly adding one vertex) is also in X(K_2) and is a proper supergraph of E_n. This forms an infinite ascending chain E_1 < E_2 < E_3 < ..., meaning no element is maximal.

Since the existence of a maximal element depends on the choice of H, the answer is D (Depends).

Let X = S, where S is a finite, discrete subset of R. The order is the standard one on R.

- If S is non-empty, for example S = {1, 2, 5}, it is a finite set of real numbers and has a maximum element (5), which is also a maximal element.
- However, the empty set S = {} is also a finite and discrete subset of R. The empty set contains no elements, and thus has no maximal element.

Since some sets in this class have maximal elements and at least one does not, the answer is D (Depends).

- Consider the set S_2 = Z (the set of all integers). This set is also countable and discrete. It has no maximal element, because for any integer n, n+1 is also in S_2 and n < n+1.

Let X = S, where S is an uncountable, discrete subset of R. A fundamental property of the real numbers is that any discrete subset must be countable. This is because for each point in a discrete set, we can find a disjoint open interval around it. Each of these intervals must contain a unique rational number, establishing an injection from the set to the countable set Q.

Therefore, the class of "uncountable, discrete subsets of R" is empty.

The question asks whether *all* sets in this class have a maximal element. In formal logic, a universal statement ("for all x in C...") over an empty class C is considered vacuously true. So, it is true that all sets in this empty class have a maximal element. The answer is Y (Yes).

Let X be the set of sequences of natural numbers. The order is a <= b if b is a subsequence of a.
We need to determine if this single set X has any maximal elements. An element M is maximal if for any S, M <= S implies S <= M.

- Let's test a constant sequence, for example M = (1, 1, 1, ...).
- The condition M <= S means S must be a subsequence of M. Any subsequence of M must be of the form (1, 1, 1, ...), so S = M.
- The maximality condition becomes: "if S=M, is S <= M?". This is true, as M is a subsequence of itself (S=M, so S<=M means M<=M).
- Thus, any constant sequence is a maximal element.

Let X be the set of sequences of natural numbers. The order is a <= b if a is a subsequence of b. This is the standard subsequence ordering.
A sequence M is maximal if any sequence S that contains M as a subsequence is itself a subsequence of M.

It is a known (and non-trivial) result that this ordering has no maximal elements. For any sequence M, one can construct a sequence S that is strictly greater in this order.
Let's construct one such S for any given M = (m_1, m_2, ...).
- Define S = (m_1+1, m_1, m_2+1, m_2, m_3+1, m_3, ...).
- M is a subsequence of S, by taking the elements at even positions (s_2, s_4, s_6, ...). So M <= S.
- However, S is not a subsequence of M. For example, if M=(1, 2, 3,...), then S=(2,1, 3,2, ...). A subsequence of the increasing sequence M must be increasing, but S is not. More generally, it can be proven that S cannot be a subsequence of M.

Since for any sequence M, we can find a sequence S such that M < S, no sequence is maximal. The answer is N (No).
