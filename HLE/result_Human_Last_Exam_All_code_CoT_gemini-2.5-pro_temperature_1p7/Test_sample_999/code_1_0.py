This is often sufficient to leverage hardware acceleration (e.g., Tensor Cores) and achieve significant wall-clock speed-up."

Applying scaling factors per-token for activations (input X) and per-channel for weights (W) allows the core `X*W` operation to be a pure INT8 matrix multiplication, which is heavily accelerated by Tensor Cores on Turing and later GPUs."

For compute-bound large models, quantizing both weights and activations to INT4 can offer significant speed-ups over FP32 due to higher throughput. The newer H100 is architecturally superior and faster than the A100, making the performance comparison plausible."

            "reasoning": "This statement is incorrect. INT8 GEMM kernels on NVIDIA GPUs require uniform quantization so that a single scaling factor can be applied across a whole row/column, enabling a pure integer matrix multiply. Non-uniform quantization would require an element-wise dequantization (e.g., via a slow table-lookup) inside the compute kernel. This operation is highly inefficient on GPUs and would disrupt the massive parallelism. The resulting computational overhead would almost certainly negate any memory bandwidth savings, leading to a net SLOWDOWN, not a 'substantial speed-up', compared to optimized FP16."

            "verdict": "Correct",
            "reasoning": "Quantization is fundamentally about reducing precision. While integers (INT8, INT4) are common, low-precision floating-point formats are also a form of quantization. For example, FP8 is supported on NVIDIA's Hopper architecture (H100), and BF16 is widely used. Therefore, quantization is not exclusive to integers."
