    "My plan is to determine the smallest number `n` for which we can define a set `G` of size `n` and a binary operation that does not form a group.\n\n1.  **Recall the definition of a group**: A group `(G, ·)` is a set `G` with a binary operation `·` that satisfies four axioms: Closure, Associativity, Identity Element, and Inverse Element. A binary operation by definition satisfies the closure property. Most standard definitions also require the set `G` to be non-empty.\n\n2.  **Examine n=0**: If we allow empty sets, `G = {}`. There is only one binary operation possible (the empty function). This structure fails the \"Identity Element\" axiom because the axiom requires the *existence* of an identity element in `G`, but `G` has no elements. So, `n=0` would be the answer. However, the standard convention in abstract algebra is to define groups on non-empty sets. I will follow this convention.\n\n3.  **Examine n=1**: Let `G = {a}`. The only possible binary operation is `a · a = a`.\n    *   **Closure**: `a · a = a`, which is in `G`. (Satisfied by definition).\n    *   **Associativity**: `(a · a) · a` must equal `a · (a · a)`. This becomes `a · a = a · a`, which is true.\n    *   **Identity Element**: The element `a` acts as the identity since `a · a = a`.\n    *   **Inverse Element**: The inverse of `a` is `a` itself, since `a · a = a` (the identity).\n    All axioms are satisfied. Therefore, any set of size 1 with a binary operation must be a group.\n\n4.  **Examine n=2**: Let `G = {0, 1}`. We need to check if we can define a binary operation `·` on `G` that fails at least one of the group axioms. If we can find such an operation, then `n=2` is our answer. A failure in associativity is a good candidate, as it leads to a clear failing equation.\n\n5.  **Construct a counterexample for n=2**: I will define a binary operation using a Cayley table and show that it is not associative. This proves that `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation**: The Python code will present this step-by-step reasoning, define the counterexample for `n=2`, demonstrate the failure of the associativity axiom with a specific equation, and print the numbers in that equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_smallest_non_group_size():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and demonstrates the solution to find the smallest n\n    for which a set of n elements can have a binary operation that is not a group.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program finds the smallest number n such that a set of n elements with a binary operation is not a group.\")\n    print(\"A group (G, ·) must satisfy: associativity, have an identity element, and every element must have an inverse.\")\n    print(\"By convention, a group's set must be non-empty, so we start our search from n=1.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze n=1\n    print(\"--- Analyzing n=1 ---\")\n    print(\"Let G = {a}.
