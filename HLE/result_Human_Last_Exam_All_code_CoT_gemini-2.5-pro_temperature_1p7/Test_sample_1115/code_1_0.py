# The atom starts and ends in a state with total angular momentum J=0.
# Therefore, the total angular momentum of the two emitted photons must be 0.
total_angular_momentum = 0

# Photons have spin 1. Circular polarization corresponds to spin projections
# of +1 or -1 along the direction of motion.
# Right-handed polarization corresponds to spin +1.
# Left-handed polarization corresponds to spin -1.

# One photon is measured to be right-handed.

# From the conservation law: spin_photon1 + spin_photon2 = 0
# We can calculate the spin of the companion photon.
companion_photon2_spin = total_angular_momentum - measured_photon1_spin
