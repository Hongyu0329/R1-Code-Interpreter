    "This is a challenging sequence problem because it does not follow a simple mathematical rule and appears to have internal inconsistencies, suggesting it might be a trick question or from a specific context (like a puzzle competition with a very specific rule).\n\nHowever, after analyzing various possibilities, one interesting mathematical relationship emerges for some of the numbers, which is the \"sum of proper divisors\". A proper divisor of a number is a divisor other than the number itself. Let's call this function `spd(n)`.\n\nFor example, let's test this on a number from the sequence: 111.\nThe divisors of 111 are 1, 3, 37, and 111. The proper divisors are 1, 3, and 37.\n`spd(111) = 1 + 3 + 37 = 41`.\nWe can see that the sequence contains the transition `..., 111, 41, ...` (this happens if we view the sequence as a graph of numbers rather than a linear progression).\n\nAlthough this rule does not generate the entire sequence in order, it is a plausible candidate for the intended operation. The question asks for the \"next number\", which implies applying the hidden rule to the last number in the sequence, which is 124.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define a function to find all proper divisors of a number.\n2.  Sum these proper divisors.\n3.  Apply this function to the last number of the sequence, 124, to find the next number.\n4.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef sum_proper_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of the proper divisors of a number n.\n    A proper divisor is a positive divisor of n other than n itself.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Start with 1 as every number > 1 has 1 as a proper divisor\n    total = 1\n    divisors = [1]\n    \n    # Iterate from 2 up to the square root of n\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # i is a divisor\n            total += i\n            divisors.append(i)\n            # n/i is also a divisor\n            pair = n // i\n            if pair != i:\n                total += pair\n                divisors.append(pair)\n    \n    divisors.sort()\n    return total, divisors\n\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the next number in the sequence based on the\n    sum of proper divisors rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    last_number = 124\n    \n    next_number, proper_divs = sum_proper_divisors(last_number)\n    \n    # Format the equation string\n    equation_parts = [str(d) for d in proper_divs]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"The rule is to find the sum of the proper divisors of the last number.\")\n    print(f\"The last number is {last_number}.\")\n    print(f\"The proper divisors of {last_number} are: {proper_divs}\")\n    print(f\"The equation is: {equation_str} = {next_number}\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the next number in the sequence is {next_number}.\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n<<<100>>>\n```"
