def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    Solves the topology problem by analyzing the properties of the space X.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Let X be a space satisfying the given properties.
        - X is a metric space.
        - X is locally compact.
        - X is a one-to-one continuous image of the real line R. Let f: R -> X be this map.
        - Separation property: For any distinct x, y in X, there is a closed, connected set K
          such that x is in the interior of K and y is not in K.

    2.  Analyze the condition "one-to-one continuous image of R".
        - This means f: R -> X is a continuous bijection.
        - Let x be any point in X. There is a unique t in R such that f(t) = x.
        - The space R \\ {t} has exactly two connected components.
        - Since f is a continuous bijection, it maps the two components of R \\ {t} to
          two disjoint connected sets whose union is X \\ {x}.
        - This implies that for any point x in X, the space X \\ {x} is disconnected and
          has exactly two connected components. A space where every point separates it
          into two components cannot have "branch points" or "endpoints".

    3.  Classify X based on these properties.
        - As a continuous image of R, X is connected and separable.
        - A separable, connected, locally compact metric space in which every point
          is a cut-point that separates the space into exactly two components
          is known to be homeomorphic to the real line, R.

    4.  Conclude the number of homeomorphism classes.
        - All spaces X satisfying the conditions must be homeomorphic to R.
        - We must check if R itself satisfies the conditions, which it does.
        - Therefore, all such spaces X lie in a single homeomorphism class.
    """

    # Based on the topological analysis, there is only one possible homeomorphism class.
    number_of_classes = 1

    # The problem asks to output the number. There is no equation.
    print(f"The number of different homeomorphism classes is: {number_of_classes}")
    # Printing the raw number for the final answer.
    # The 'equation' is simply: Result = 1. We will output the number 1.
