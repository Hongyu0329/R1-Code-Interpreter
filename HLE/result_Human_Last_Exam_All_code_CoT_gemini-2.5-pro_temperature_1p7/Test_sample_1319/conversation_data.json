    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  First, I will compile a list of historical mountains that are explicitly mentioned in Homer's Iliad. These include Mount Ida (where Zeus observed the Trojan War), Mount Samothrace (where Poseidon watched the battle), Mount Athos (which Hera flew over), Mount Pelion (the source of Achilles' spear), and Mount Tmolus (mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships). Mount Olympus is excluded as per the user's request.\n2.  Next, I will find the modern-day elevations for each of these mountains.\n3.  I will then write a Python script to store these mountains and their elevations in a dictionary.\n4.  The script will sort the mountains by elevation in descending order.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the name and elevation of the tallest mountain and then display a comparison of all the identified mountains' heights to show the final ranking.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of historical mountains from the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    # Mount Olympus (2918m) is excluded as per the request.\n    iliad_mountains = {\n        'Mount Tmolus': 2159,\n        'Mount Athos': 2033,\n        'Mount Ida (near Troy)': 1774,\n        'Mount Pelion': 1624,\n        'Mount Samothrace (Fengari)': 1611\n    }\n\n    # Find the mountain with the highest elevation\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(iliad_mountains, key=iliad_mountains.get)\n    tallest_mountain_height = iliad_mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    print(f\"The tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus is {tallest_mountain_name}.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a comparison of their heights in meters:\")\n\n    # Sort the mountains by height in descending order for the final comparison\n    sorted_mountains = sorted(iliad_mountains.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Create the comparison string, including each number\n    comparison_string = \" > \".join([f\"{name} ({height}m)\" for name, height in sorted_mountains])\n    \n    print(comparison_string)\n\nfind_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
