    "Of course. Here is the plan to identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid:\n1.  First, I will compile a list of major rivers that are explicitly mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n2.  Next, I will find the accepted modern-day lengths of these rivers.\n3.  I will then sort these rivers based on their length in descending order.\n4.  Finally, I will select the top three from the sorted list and present them as the answer, displaying their names and lengths.\n\n```python\nimport operator\n\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n\n    This function contains a predefined dictionary of rivers mentioned in the text\n    and their corresponding lengths.
