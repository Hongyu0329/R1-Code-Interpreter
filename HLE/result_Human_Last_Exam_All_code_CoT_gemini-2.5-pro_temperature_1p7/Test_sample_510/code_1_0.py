    This function solves the queueing theory problem described.
    1. It defines the parameters of the M/G/1-SRPT system.
    2. It uses SymPy to symbolically calculate the optimal mean response time, x.
    3. It prints the components of the calculation, including the numbers in the final equation for x.
    4. It determines the remaining term after removals, based on a specific interpretation
       of the problem statement.
