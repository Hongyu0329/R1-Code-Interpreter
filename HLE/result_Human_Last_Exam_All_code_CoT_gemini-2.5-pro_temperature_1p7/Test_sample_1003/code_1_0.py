    This function solves the problem of finding the ratio of star angle differences
    in a different reference frame.

    The steps are:
    1. Define the relationship between angles in the two frames using Doppler factors D_i.
    2. Use data from the first frame (tetrahedral symmetry) to find the constant term 1-cos(phi).
    3. Set up equations for the Doppler factors using the data from the second frame.
    4. Simplify the target expression to a ratio of Doppler factors (D3/D1).
    5. Solve for this ratio and print the simplified result.
