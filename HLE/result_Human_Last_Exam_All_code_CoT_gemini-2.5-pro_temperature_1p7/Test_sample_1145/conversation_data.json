    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Probability Density Function:** The probability of finding a particle in a 1D box is given by the square of its wave function, `|Ψn(x)|²`. For a box of length `a`, the normalized probability density is `P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)`.\n2.  **Set Up the Definite Integral:** To find the probability over a specific interval `[x1, x2]`, we need to integrate the probability density function over that range: `Probability = ∫[from x1 to x2] P(x) dx`.\n3.  **Substitute the Given Values:** In this problem, the quantum number `n = 2`, and the interval is from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`. The integral is:\n    `Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will write a Python script to solve this integral numerically. The `scipy.integrate.quad` function is ideal for this task as it provides a highly accurate result. For the calculation, the length of the box `a` can be set to 1, as it mathematically cancels out from the final probability. The code will then print the final equation with the specific numbers plugged in and the final computed probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# --- Parameters for the problem ---\n# Quantum number\nn = 2\n# Length of the box (can be set to 1.0 as it cancels out)\na = 1.0\n# Start of the interval\nx1 = 0.495 * a\n# End of the interval\nx2 = 0.505 * a\n\n# --- Probability Density Function ---\n# P(x) = (2/a) * sin^2(n*pi*x / a)\n# This is the function we will integrate.\ndef probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the probability density for a particle in a 1D box.\"\"\"\n  return (2 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n# --- Numerical Integration ---\n# Use scipy.integrate.quad to calculate the definite integral.\n# quad returns two values: the result of the integration and an estimate of the error.\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# --- Output the Final Result ---\n# As requested, we print the final equation with the numbers and the result.\n# The 'a' is left symbolically in the printout for clarity.\nprint(\"The probability P is found by solving the definite integral of the probability density function:\")\nprint(f\"P = Integral from {x1:.3f}a to {x2:.3f}a of (2/a) * sin^2({n}*pi*x/a) dx\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating this integral gives the probability:\")\nprint(f\"P = {probability}\")\n```\n<<<0.000328991823614834>>>"
