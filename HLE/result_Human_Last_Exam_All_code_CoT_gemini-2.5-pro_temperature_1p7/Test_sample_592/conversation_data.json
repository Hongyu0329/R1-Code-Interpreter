    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the answer and present it.\n\n1.  I will first search for the plot summary of the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n2.  I will specifically look for information regarding the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci.\n3.  I will identify the part of the plot that describes his move to the United States and find the name of the city.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print this information in a clear sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_in_ovosodo():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the answer to the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information found from plot summaries of the movie 'Ovosodo'.\n    character_name = \"Tommaso\"\n    us_city = \"San Francisco\"\n    movie_title = \"Ovosodo (Hard Boiled Egg)\"\n    year = 1997\n\n    # Print the answer in a descriptive sentence.\n    print(f\"In the {year} movie '{movie_title}', the character {character_name} moves to the US city of {us_city}.\")\n\nfind_city_in_ovosodo()\n```\n<<<San Francisco>>>"
