    "An elegant explanation of the method to solve the problem is as follows:\n1.  Let the given tensor be $T_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n(x_i+y_i+z_i) - 1$. We want to find its slice rank, which is given in the asymptotic form $S_n = (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. Our goal is to determine the value of $K$.\n2.  We will find the exact slice rank of the tensor $T_n$. The slice rank of a 3-tensor $T$, denoted $SR(T)$, is the smallest integer $r$ such that $T$ can be written as a sum of $r$ slice tensors. A slice tensor is a tensor of the form $u(x) \\otimes A(y,z)$ or $v(y) \\otimes B(x,z)$ or $w(z) \\otimes C(x,y)$.\n3.  We establish upper and lower bounds on the slice rank, which will turn out to be identical.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nA decomposition of $T$ into a sum of $r$ slices of the first type (i.e., $T(x,y,z) = \\sum_{i=1}^r u_i(x) A_i(y,z)$) gives an upper bound $SR(T) \\le r$. The minimal such $r$ for slices of the first type is the dimension of the vector space spanned by the functions $f_x(y,z) = T(x,y,z)$ for all $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$. Let's try the other way around due to symmetry, by fixing $(y,z)$.\nLet $d_x$ be the dimension of the space of functions spanned by $\\{ x \\mapsto T_n(x,y,z) \\}_{y,z \\in \\{0,1\\}^n}$. The slice rank is at most this dimension, $SR(T_n) \\le d_x$.\nThe functions are of the form $f_{y,z}(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$. Let $c_i = y_i+z_i$. For $(y_i,z_i) \\in \\{0,1\\}^2$, $c_i$ can take values in $\\{0,1,2\\}$. Any vector $c \\in \\{0,1,2\\}^n$ can be realized by some pair $(y,z)$.\nSo, the space of functions is spanned by $\\{ f_c(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^n(x_i+c_i) - 1 \\}_{c \\in \\{0,1,2\\}^n}$.\nThe dimension of this space is the same as the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{ g_c(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^n(x_i+c_i) \\}_{c \\in \\{0,1,2\\}^n}$, as the constant function $1$ is contained in this span (e.g. for $c=(1,\\dots,1)$, $g_c(x) = \\prod(x_i+1) = \\sum_{S\\subseteq [n]} \\prod_{i\\in S} x_i$; the function 1 is just the monomial for $S=\\emptyset$ and these can be separated).\nWe expand $g_c(x)$ in the monomial basis of functions on $\\{0,1\\}^n$, which is $\\{m_S(x) = \\prod_{i \\in S} x_i \\}_{S \\subseteq [n]}$.\n$g_c(x) = \\sum_{S \\subseteq [n]} \\left(\\prod_{j \\in [n]\\setminus S} c_j\\right) m_S(x)$.\nThe space of functions $\\{g_c(x)\\}$ is spanned by $2^n$ basis functions $m_S(x)$. The coefficient vectors are $v_S(c) = \\prod_{j \\in [n]\\setminus S} c_j$. These are $2^n$ distinct monomials in variables $c_j$ over the domain $\\{0,1,2\\}$, and are thus linearly independent.\nThis means that the functions $\\{g_c(x)\\}$ span the entire $2^n$-dimensional space of multilinear polynomials in $x$.\nThus, $d_x = 2^n$, which gives an upper bound $SR(T_n) \\le 2^n$.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nThe slice rank of a tensor $T$ is lower-bounded by the rank of any of its matricizations. Let's consider the matricization $M_x$ where rows are indexed by $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ and columns by pairs $(y,z) \\in \\{0,1\\}^n \\times \\{0,1\\}^n$. The entries are $M_{x, (y,z)} = T_n(x,y,z)$.\nThe rank of this matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by its rows, which are functions $h_x(y,z) = T_n(x,y,z)$ for each fixed $x$.\nThe space is spanned by $\\{ h_x(y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n(x_i+y_i+z_i)-1 \\}_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n}$.\nSimilar to the upper bound calculation, we expand these functions in a monomial basis, this time in variables $y_i,z_i$.\nLet $q_S(y,z) = \\prod_{i \\in S} (y_i+z_i)$. These functions are linearly independent.\n$h_x(y,z)+1 = \\prod_{i=1}^n(x_i+y_i+z_i) = \\sum_{A \\subseteq [n]} \\left(\\prod_{i \\in A}x_i\\right) q_{[n]\\setminus A}(y,z)$.\nThe functions $\\{h_x(y,z)+1\\}$ are linear combinations of the basis functions $\\{q_S(y,z)\\}_{S \\subseteq [n]}$. The coefficient matrix $C_{X,A} = \\prod_{i \\in A}x_i$ (where $X$ is the support of $x$) is a $2^n \\times 2^n$ matrix. This is the matrix for the subset inclusion relation, which is full rank ($2^n$).\nTherefore, the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{h_x(y,z)\\}$ is $2^n$.\nThis gives $\\text{rank}(M_x) = 2^n$. So, $SR(T_n) \\ge \\text{rank}(M_x) = 2^n$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince $2^n \\le SR(T_n) \\le 2^n$, the slice rank is exactly $SR(T_n) = 2^n$.\nWe are given that the slice rank is asymptotically $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The term $e^{o(n)}$ accounts for sub-exponential factors (e.g., polynomial in $n$), and for large $n$, $(e^{o(n)})^{1/n} \\to 1$.\nEquating the two expressions for the slice rank:\n$2^n = (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$\nTaking the $n$-th root and the limit as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$2 = 3/2^K$\n$2^{K+1} = 3$\n$K+1 = \\log_2(3)$\n$K = \\log_2(3) - 1 = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the value of $K$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find K, where the slice rank of a tensor is given by the formula (3/2^K)^n * e^(o(n)).\n# Our analysis shows that the slice rank of the given tensor is exactly 2^n.\n# By equating the asymptotic formula with our derived slice rank, we find the value for K.\n# 2^n = (3 / (2^K))^n * e^(o(n))\n# Taking the n-th root of both sides gives:\n# 2 = (3 / (2^K)) * (e^(o(n)))^(1/n)\n# As n -> infinity, the term (e^(o(n)))^(1/n) = e^(o(n)/n) -> e^0 = 1.\n# So we have the equation:\n# 2 = 3 / (2^K)\n# 2 * 2^K = 3\n# 2^(K+1) = 3\n# K + 1 = log2(3)\n# K = log2(3) - 1\n# This is equivalent to K = log2(3/2).\n\nK = math.log2(3.0) - 1.0\nprint(K)\n```\n<<<0.5849625007211562>>>"
