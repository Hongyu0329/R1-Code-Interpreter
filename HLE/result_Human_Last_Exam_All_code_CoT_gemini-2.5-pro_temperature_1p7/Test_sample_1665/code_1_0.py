    print("  - Effect: The magnetic field spreads out and weakens significantly over the long distance. This is our reference for comparison.\n")

    print("Scenario 1: Cylinder is made of a ferromagnetic material.")
    print("  - Effect: The cylinder concentrates the magnetic field lines and channels them along its length. This results in a much STRONGER field at the other end compared to air.\n")

    print("Scenario 2: Cylinder is a hollow ideal superconducting tube.")
    print("  - Effect: The superconductor expels the magnetic field, forcing it to go around the tube. This shields the area at the far end, resulting in a WEAKER field compared to air.\n")

    print("Scenario 3: Cylinder has a ferromagnetic core surrounded by an ideal superconducting shell.")
    print("  - Effect: This is the most effective configuration. The ferromagnetic core gathers the field, and the superconducting shell prevents any magnetic flux from leaking out the sides. This 'magnetic pipe' is highly efficient, leading to the STRONGEST possible field at the far end.\n")

    print("Scenario 4: Cylinder has an ideal superconducting core surrounded by a ferromagnetic shell.")
    print("  - Effect: The ferromagnetic shell guides the magnetic field. However, the superconducting core actively expels the field from the center. While this still results in a STRONGER field than air, it's less effective than Scenario 1 because part of the volume repels the field.\n")
