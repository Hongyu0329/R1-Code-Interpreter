    "This is a classic mycology question with a fun, nuanced answer. While the premise of a *distinctly blue spore print* is a common misconception, there is one genus famously known for a vibrant blue mushroom, and it's almost always the intended answer to this question.\n\nMy plan is to write a simple Python script that will store the name of this genus in a variable and then print it to the console.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking for the name of a mushroom genus known for the color blue.\n# While no genus actually produces a truly blue spore print, the genus Lactarius\n# is famous for the species Lactarius indigo, a mushroom that is blue\n# through-and-through and exudes a blue latex \"milk\" when cut.\n# For this reason, it is the common answer to this classic question.\n\ngenus_name = \"Lactarius\"\n\nprint(genus_name)\n```\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
