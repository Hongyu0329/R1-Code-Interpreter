    # Step-by-step derivation of the limit
    #

    # 1. The Process and Transience:
    # The process X_t is a standard complex Brownian motion with an added drift
    # resulting from the conditioning never to hit the unit disk. The h-transform
    # with h(z) = ln|z| results in a drift b(z) = grad(ln(h(z))) = z / (|z|^2 * ln|z|).
    # This drift is always directed radially outwards.
    # A process with a persistent outward drift is transient, which means that |X_t| -> infinity
    # almost surely as t -> infinity. The process moves away from the origin forever.

    # 2. Local Behavior of the Process:
    # We are examining the sausage density in the disk B_n, which is centered at n
    # and has a radius of R_n = n/3. For large n, this disk is far from the origin.
    # When the process X_t is inside B_n, its distance from the origin is roughly n.
    # The magnitude of the drift there is approximately 1/(n * ln(n)), which is very small for large n.
    # Therefore, inside B_n, the process behaves almost identically to a standard Brownian motion.

    # 3. Sausage of a Finite Path:
    # Because X_t is transient, it can only spend a finite amount of time inside B_n.
    # The path of X_t within B_n is therefore a finite path, statistically equivalent
    # to a standard Brownian motion that is started at the boundary of B_n and stopped when it exits.
    # The duration T_n of this path is the time it takes for a Brownian motion to cross
    # a disk of radius R_n. This exit time is proportional to the square of the radius.
    # T_n is proportional to R_n^2 = (n/3)^2.

    # 4. Asymptotic Volume of the Sausage:
    # A classic result in probability theory (by Spitzer, Le Gall) states that the
    # area of a sausage of radius 1 generated by a 2D Brownian motion over a long
    # time T is asymptotically |S_T| ~ 2 * pi * T / ln(T).
    # We apply this to the path inside B_n with duration T_n.
    
    # 5. Calculating the Limit of V_n:
    # The relative area V_n is the ratio of the sausage volume inside B_n to the area of B_n.
    #   Sausage volume |S_T_n| ~ (2 * pi * T_n) / ln(T_n)
    #   Disk area |B_n| = pi * R_n^2
    #
    # Let T_n = k * R_n^2 for some constant k.
    #   V_n = |S_T_n| / |B_n|
    #       ~ [ (2 * pi * k * R_n^2) / ln(k * R_n^2) ] / [ pi * R_n^2 ]
    #       = (2 * k) / ln(k * R_n^2)
    #       = (2 * k) / (ln(k) + 2 * ln(R_n))
    #
    # Since R_n = n/3, as n -> infinity, R_n -> infinity.
    # The denominator ln(k) + 2 * ln(R_n) goes to infinity.
    # Thus, the limit of V_n as n -> infinity is 0.

    # 6. Conclusion:
    # V_n converges to 0 in probability. Therefore, for any positive constant c,
    # the probability P(V_n > c) must approach 0 as n -> infinity.
    
    # The problem asks for the limit of P[V_n > 2/3].
    
    # The numbers in the final equation lim P[V_n > 2/3] = 0 are:
    constant_in_inequality = "2/3" # The fraction 2/3
    value_of_limit = 0            # The result of the limit
    
    # We use float representation for printing.
    print(f"The equation is: lim_{{n->inf}} P[V_n > {float(2/3):.2f}] = {value_of_limit}")
    print("The numbers in the final equation are:")
    print(f"Constant c in P[V_n > c]: {float(2/3):.4f}")
    print(f"Value of the limit: {value_of_limit}")
