    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThis is a fun music theory question. The progression you're describing, moving from the tonic chord (the \"I\") to a minor fifth chord (written as \"vm\"), is a very distinctive sound. It's a classic example of \"modal mixture,\" where a chord is borrowed from the parallel minor key. In this case, the dominant chord (V), which is normally major, is made minor.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the famous Beatles song that uses this exact chord change in its introduction.\n2.  Write a Python script that states the name of the song and clarifies the specific chords used in the progression.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the Beatles song that starts with a\n    tonic to minor fifth chord progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Magical Mystery Tour\"\n    key = \"E Major\"\n    tonic_chord = \"E Major (the tonic, or I chord)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"B minor (the minor fifth, or vm chord)\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe song is in the key of E Major.\")\n    print(\"The chord 'equation' or progression is:\")\n    print(f\"1. Tonic Chord: {tonic_chord}\")\n    print(f\"2. Minor Fifth Chord: {minor_fifth_chord}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Magical Mystery Tour>>>"
