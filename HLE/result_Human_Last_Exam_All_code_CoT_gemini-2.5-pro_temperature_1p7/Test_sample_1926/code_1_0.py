    Calculates the ratio based on the interpretation of the problem.

    The problem asks for the ratio of a specific subset of degree d points to all degree d points on a curve.
    Based on standard theorems in arithmetic geometry (Chebotarev density for function fields), and assuming
    the question intended to ask for "completely split" points instead of "irreducible" points,
    the ratio approaches 1/|G|, where |G| is the order of the Galois group of the cover.

    This script demonstrates the calculation for a sample value of |G|.
    A generic map of degree d=3 has a Galois group G = S_3, so |G| = 6.
