    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by a Python script that carries out the plan.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the System**: The problem asks for the separatrix of a 2D system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) on the `u >= 0` half-plane. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. These are often associated with saddle points.\n2.  **Find Equilibrium Points**: I will first find the system's equilibrium points by solving for `(d, u)` where `d'(t) = 0` and `u'(t) = 0`.\n3.  **Classify a Saddle Point**: I will then classify these points by linearizing the system (using the Jacobian matrix) and examining the eigenvalues. The goal is to identify a saddle point, which has both positive and negative real-part eigenvalues.\n4.  **Find the Separatrix Equation**: The separatrix is an invariant curve (i.e., a trajectory) that passes through the saddle point. I will determine the equation of this curve, which turns out to be a simple polynomial `d = f(u)`.\n5.  **Verify the Solution**: I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to perform the equilibrium analysis and then programmatically verifies that the found curve `d = f(u)` is indeed an invariant manifold that passes through the saddle point, confirming it is a separatrix. The script will print out all steps of this verification.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and verifies the separatrix for the given system of differential equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables\n    d, u = sympy.symbols('d u')\n\n    # Define the system of ODEs\n    # d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)\n    # u'(t) = u^2(u-1)\n    d_prime = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1-u)\n    u_prime = u**2 * (u - 1)\n\n    print(\"System of ODEs:\")\n    print(f\"d'/dt = {d_prime}\")\n    print(f\"u'/dt = {u_prime}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Find and classify equilibrium points ---\n    print(\"--- Finding and Classifying Equilibrium Points (for u>=0) ---\")\n    \n    # Solve for equilibrium points where d'=0 and u'=0\n    equilibria = sympy.solve([d_prime, u_prime], (d, u), dict=True)\n    \n    saddle_point = None\n    for eq in equilibria:\n        # Per problem statement, we are on the u >= 0 half-plane\n        if eq[u] >= 0:\n            print(f\"Found equilibrium point: (d, u) = ({eq[d]}, {eq[u]})\")\n            \n            # Linearize the system by computing the Jacobian matrix\n            F = sympy.Matrix([d_prime, u_prime])\n            var_vec = sympy.Matrix([d, u])\n            J = F.jacobian(var_vec)\n            \n            # Evaluate the Jacobian at the equilibrium point\n            J_eq = J.subs(eq)\n            eigenvals = J_eq.eigenvals()\n\n            # Classify the point based on eigenvalues\n            print(f\"  Eigenvalues at this point: {list(eigenvals.keys())}\")\n            if J_eq.is_zero:\n                print(\"  Classification: Non-hyperbolic (degenerate)\")\n            else:\n                real_parts = [sympy.re(ev) for ev in eigenvals.keys()]\n                if any(r > 0 for r in real_parts) and any(r < 0 for r in real_parts):\n                    saddle_point = eq\n                    print(\"  Classification: Saddle Point\")\n                elif all(r > 0 for r in real_parts):\n                    print(\"  Classification: Unstable Node (Source)\")\n                else: # Covers stable nodes, spirals, etc.\n                     print(\"  Classification: Other/Stable\")\n\n\n    if not saddle_point:\n        print(\"\\nNo saddle point found.
