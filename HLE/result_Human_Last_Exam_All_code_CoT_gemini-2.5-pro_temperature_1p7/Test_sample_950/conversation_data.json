    "Of course. Here is the solution to your problem.\n\nThe problem asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$. This space is the real Grassmannian manifold $Gr(3, 5)$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the space and duality:** The space is the real Grassmannian $Gr(3, 5)$. Due to a standard diffeomorphism, we have $Gr(k, n) \\cong Gr(n-k, n)$. Thus, $Gr(3, 5) \\cong Gr(2, 5)$. It is often simpler to work with the smaller of the two indices, so we'll use the parameters for $Gr(2, 5)$.\n\n2.  **State the relevant mathematical formula:** The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology $H^*(Gr_k(\\mathbb{R}^n); \\mathbb{Z})$ can be calculated using a formula by A. T. Fomenko. The torsion part consists entirely of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ components. To avoid ambiguity from the duality, we will define $k' = \\min(k, n-k)$ and $m' = n-k' = \\max(k, n-k)$. The formula for the rank is:\n    $$ \\text{Rank} = \\sum_{j=1}^{k'} N(m', j) $$\n    where $N(m', j)$ is the number of integers $s$ in the range $m' < s \\le m' + j$ for which the binomial coefficient $\\binom{s-1}{j}$ is odd.\n\n3.  **Implement the calculation in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation for $Gr(3, 5)$. The script will:\n    *   Determine the correct parameters $k'$ and $m'$.\n    *   Iterate through $j$ from $1$ to $k'$.\n    *   For each $j$, iterate through the corresponding range of $s$ to find the count $N(m', j)$.\n    *   Sum these counts to get the total rank.\n    *   The script will print the steps of the calculation and the final equation for the rank.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_torsion_rank(k_orig, n_orig):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology\n    of the real Grassmannian Gr(k, n).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Use the duality Gr(k, n) = Gr(n-k, n) to simplify.\n    # The formula is stated most easily for k <= n-k.\n    k = min(k_orig, n_orig - k_orig)\n    n = n_orig\n    m = n - k # m = max(k_orig, n_orig - k_orig)\n\n    print(f\"The space is the Grassmannian Gr({k_orig}, {n_orig}).\")\n    print(f\"Using the duality Gr({k_orig}, {n_orig}) ~ Gr({k}, {n}), we will use parameters k={k} and n={n}.\")\n    print(\"The rank of the torsion subgroup is calculated using Fomenko's formula:\")\n    print(\"Rank = Sum_{j=1 to k} N(n-k, j)\")\n    print(\"where N(m, j) is the count of integers s such that m < s <= m+j and C(s-1, j) is odd.\")\n    print(f\"For this problem, k = {k} and m = n-k = {m}.\\n\")\n\n    total_rank = 0\n    N_values = []\n    \n    # j ranges from 1 to k\n    for j in range(1, k + 1):\n        N_j = 0\n        print(f\"--- Calculating N_{j} for j={j} ---\")\n        # s ranges from m+1 to m+j\n        for s in range(m + 1, m + j + 1):\n            # C(n, k) is 0 if k > n\n            if s - 1 < j:\n                comb = 0\n            else:\n                comb = math.comb(s - 1, j)\n\n            # Check if the binomial coefficient is odd\n            if comb % 2 == 1:\n                print(f\"s={s}: C({s-1}, {j}) = {comb}, which is odd.
