    "This problem asks for the number of true boolean expressions of a specific length (5), formed from a given set of symbols, considering standard operator precedence. A simple counting of all possible strings would be incorrect, as many would be syntactically invalid. Counting parse trees of a simple but ambiguous grammar (like `E -> E op E`) is also wrong because it can overcount expressions that have multiple parse trees.\n\nThe best approach is to use dynamic programming based on an unambiguous grammar that correctly models the specified operator precedence (`! > & > |`).\n\nHere is the unambiguous grammar I will use:\n1.  `E -> E | T` or `T` (An Expression is a chain of Terms connected by `|`, the lowest precedence)\n2.  `T -> T & F` or `F` (A Term is a chain of Factors connected by `&`, the middle precedence)\n3.  `F -> !F` or `(E)` or `T` or `F` (A Factor is the highest precedence unit: a negated Factor, a parenthesized Expression, or a literal True/False value)\n\nLet's define `e_t[n]`, `t_t[n]`, `f_t[n]` as the number of \"true\" expressions, terms, and factors of length `n`, respectively. Similarly, `e_f[n]`, `t_f[n]`, `f_f[n]` will be the counts for \"false\" ones. `e_total[n]`, `t_total[n]`, `f_total[n]` will be the total counts for each category.\n\nThe plan is to:\n1.  Initialize arrays to store these counts for lengths from 1 to 5.\n2.  Set the base cases for length `n=1`. The only valid expressions are the literals `T` and `F`, which are Factors.\n3.  Iteratively compute the counts for lengths `n` from 2 to 5 using the grammar rules.\n    -   For a Factor `F` of length `n`, it can be `!F'` (where `F'` has length `n-1`) or `(E')` (where `E'` has length `n-2`).\n    -   For a Term `T` of length `n`, it can be a simple `F` of length `n`, or `T' & F'` where the lengths of `T'` and `F'` sum to `n-1`.\n    -   For an Expression `E` of length `n`, it can be a simple `T` of length `n`, or `E' | T'` where the lengths of `E'` and `T'` sum to `n-1`.\n4.  The value `e_t[5]` will be our answer.\n5.  The final Python code will perform this calculation and print a detailed breakdown of the components that sum up to the final answer, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_boolean_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of true boolean expressions of length 5 using dynamic programming\n    based on an unambiguous grammar that respects operator precedence.\n    \"\"\"\n    max_len = 5\n    \n    # DP tables for counts of true, false, and total expressions/terms/factors\n    e_t, e_f, e_total = ([0] * (max_len + 1) for _ in range(3))\n    t_t, t_f, t_total = ([0] * (max_len + 1) for _ in range(3))\n    f_t, f_f, f_total = ([0] * (max_len + 1) for _ in range(3))\n\n    # Base case: n = 1\n    # Factors can be 'T' or 'F'\n    f_t[1] = 1  # 'T'\n    f_f[1] = 1  # 'F'\n    f_total[1] = f_t[1] + f_f[1]\n\n    # A Term of length 1 is just a Factor of length 1\n    t_t[1], t_f[1], t_total[1] = f_t[1], f_f[1], f_total[1]\n    # An Expression of length 1 is just a Term of length 1\n    e_t[1], e_f[1], e_total[1] = t_t[1], t_f[1], t_total[1]\n\n    # DP for n from 2 to max_len\n    for n in range(2, max_len + 1):\n        # 1.
