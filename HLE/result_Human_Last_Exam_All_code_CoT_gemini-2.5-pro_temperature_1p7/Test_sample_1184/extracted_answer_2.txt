1) The exact residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit are primarily those forming the hydrophobic core of the Beta Interaction Domain (BID). Based on structural and mutagenesis data, these key residues are: Tyrosine-259 (Y259), Tryptophan-313 (W313), Leucine-315 (L315), Isoleucine-317 (I317), Valine-349 (V349), and Tyrosine-352 (Y352).

2) The exact residues and regions from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for the fine-tuning of gating properties include the N-terminal domain and the SH3 domain. The entire N-terminal region (residues 1-48 in the common 'b' isoform) acts as a critical modulatory domain, particularly for inactivation kinetics. Specific residues within the SH3 domain, such as the surface-exposed cluster of Arginine-108 (R108), Lysine-109 (K109), and Glutamate-110 (E110), are also key hotspots for allosteric modulation of the channel.
