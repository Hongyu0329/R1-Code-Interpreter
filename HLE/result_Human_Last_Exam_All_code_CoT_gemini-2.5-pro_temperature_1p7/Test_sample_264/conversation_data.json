    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Cubes:** I will represent the two cubes in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let the first cube, C1, occupy the space defined by `0 <= x <= 1`, `0 <= y <= 1`, and `0 <= z <= 1`. This is a standard unit cube.\n\n2.  **Model the Shift:** The second cube, C2, is identical to C1 but is \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n    *   The main diagonal of C1 can be represented by the vector from `(0, 0, 0)` to `(1, 1, 1)`. The length of this vector is `sqrt(1² + 1² + 1²) = sqrt(3)`.\n    *   A shift \"by 1/2 along this diagonal\" means a displacement by a vector of length 1/2 in the direction `(1, 1, 1)`.\n    *   I will calculate the components of this shift vector along the x, y, and z axes. This component, which I'll call `s`, will be `(1/2) / sqrt(3)`.\n\n3.  **Find the Intersection:** Since both cubes are axis-aligned, their intersection is also an axis-aligned rectangular prism.\n    *   C1 is `[0, 1]³`.\n    *   C2 is `[s, 1+s]³`.\n    *   The intersection is `[s, 1]³`, which is a smaller cube.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Volume:** The side length of the intersection cube is `1 - s`. The volume is simply the cube of this side length: `(1 - s)³`.\n\nMy Python script will perform these calculations, explain each step, and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_cube_intersection_volume():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two unit cubes\n    shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the initial parameters.\n    side_length = 1.0\n    shift_distance = 0.5\n    print(\"This script calculates the volume of the intersection of two shifted cubes.\")\n    print(f\"The side length of each cube is L = {side_length}.\")\n    print(f\"The shift distance along the main diagonal is d = {shift_distance}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the properties of the main diagonal.\n    # The main diagonal vector of a unit cube is (1, 1, 1).\n    # Its length is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(3).\n    diagonal_length = math.sqrt(3)\n    print(\"The shift is along the main diagonal, which has a direction vector of (1, 1, 1).\")\n    print(f\"The length of this diagonal is sqrt(3) ≈ {diagonal_length:.6f}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the shift component along each axis.\n    # The total shift distance 'd' is distributed equally among the x, y, and z axes.\n    # The shift component 's' along each axis is the total distance divided by the diagonal length.\n    s = shift_distance / diagonal_length\n    print(\"The shift component 's' along each axis is calculated as s = d / sqrt(3).\")\n    print(f\"s = {shift_distance} / sqrt(3) ≈ {s:.6f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Determine the side length of the intersection volume.\n    # If the first cube is at [0, 1] on each axis, the shifted cube is at [s, 1+s].\n    # The intersection on each axis is [s, 1].\n    # The side length of the resulting intersection cube is (1 - s).\n    intersection_side_length = side_length - s\n    print(\"The intersection of the two cubes is a smaller cube.\")\n    print(\"Its side length is L_int = L - s.\")\n    print(f\"L_int = {side_length} - {s:.6f} ≈ {intersection_side_length:.6f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the final volume and print the equation.\n    volume = intersection_side_length ** 3\n    print(\"The volume of the intersection is V = (L - s)³.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Volume = ( {side_length} - ( {shift_distance} / sqrt(3) ) )³\")\n    print(f\"Volume = ( {side_length} - {s:.6f} )³\")\n    print(f\"Volume = ( {intersection_side_length:.6f} )³\")\n    print(f\"Volume ≈ {volume:.6f}\")\n\nsolve_cube_intersection_volume()\n<<<0.359914>>>\n```"
