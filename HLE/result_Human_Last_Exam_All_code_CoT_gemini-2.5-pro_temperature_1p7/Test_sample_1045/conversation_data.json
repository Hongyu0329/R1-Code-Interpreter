    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecule:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8. This means it contains 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set (6-31G):** I will determine the number of contracted basis functions this standard basis set assigns to each type of atom.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** Hydrogen's 1s electron is its valence electron. The `31` in `6-31G` signifies a split-valence shell described by two functions: one is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian. So, each H atom gets **2** contracted functions.\n    *   **For Carbon (C):** Carbon is a second-row element with core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) electrons.\n        *   The `6` describes the core 1s orbital, which is represented by a single contracted function.\n        *   The `31` describes the split-valence 2s and 2p orbitals. Each of these (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) is represented by two functions.\n        *   Total for Carbon = 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 2 (for 2px) + 2 (for 2py) + 2 (for 2pz) = **9** contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the Total:** I will multiply the number of atoms of each type by their respective number of basis functions and sum the results.\n    *   Total = (Number of Carbons × Functions per Carbon) + (Number of Hydrogens × Functions per Hydrogen)\n\nNow, I will execute this plan using Python.\n\n```python\n# Toluene molecule formula: C7H8\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set.\n\n# For Carbon (a second-row atom):\n# Core (1s orbital): Represented by 1 contracted function (from the '6' in 6-31G).\n# Valence (2s, 2p orbitals): Are split-valence (from the '31' in 6-31G).\n# This means the 2s orbital gets 2 functions, and the three 2p orbitals also get 2 functions each.\n# Total for one Carbon = 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 3*2 (for 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n\n# For Hydrogen (a first-row atom):\n# It only has a valence 1s orbital, which is split-valence.\n# This means the 1s orbital gets 2 functions.\n# Total for one Hydrogen = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions for the whole molecule\ntotal_carbon_functions = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_hydrogen_functions = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\ntotal_functions = total_carbon_functions + total_hydrogen_functions\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final equation\nprint(f\"Molecule: Toluene (C{num_carbon_atoms}H{num_hydrogen_atoms})\")\nprint(\"Basis Set: 6-31G\\n\")\nprint(f\"Number of functions for each Carbon atom: {functions_per_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Number of functions for each Hydrogen atom: {functions_per_hydrogen}\\n\")\nprint(\"The final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = ({num_carbon_atoms} Carbon atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/atom) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} Hydrogen atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/atom)\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = ({total_carbon_functions}) + ({total_hydrogen_functions})\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
