    "To solve this problem, we need to find the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers and then count the number of double points on the resulting reduced curve.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Reduction:** We'll start by reducing the given equation modulo 2 to see the initial form of the special fiber. As we will see, this initial reduction is not stable.\n2.  **Find a Stable Model:** Through a sequence of algebraic transformations (changes of variables), we will transform the original equation into a new \"model.\" The goal is to find a model whose reduction modulo 2 is a stable curve (i.e., a curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points, also called nodes).\n3.  **Count the Double Points:** Once we have the stable reduction, we will identify its irreducible components and find their intersection points. The number of these intersection points will give us the number of double points.\n\nHere is the step-by-step implementation in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef count_double_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script performs a step-by-step analysis to find the number of\n    double points in the stable reduction of the given curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Coefficients of the polynomial f(x) in y^2 = f(x)\n    coeffs = {'x^5': 8, 'x^4': 4, 'x^3': 4, 'x^2': 1, 'x': 8}\n    a5, a4, a3, a2, a1 = coeffs['x^5'], coeffs['x^4'], coeffs['x^3'], coeffs['x^2'], coeffs['x']\n    \n    print(f\"The given curve is y^2 = {a5}*x^5 + {a4}*x^4 + {a3}*x^3 + {a2}*x^2 + {a1}*x.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the number of double points in its stable reduction over the 2-adic numbers.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Initial Reduction Modulo 2 ---\")\n    print(f\"Reducing the coefficients modulo 2 gives:\")\n    print(f\"y^2 = ({a5 % 2})*x^5 + ({a4 % 2})*x^4 + ({a3 % 2})*x^3 + ({a2 % 2})*x^2 + ({a1 % 2})*x  (mod 2)\")\n    print(\"This simplifies to: y^2 = 1*x^2 (mod 2)\")\n    print(\"In characteristic 2, this is equivalent to (y - x)^2 = 0.
