    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The problem asks for the \"fixed point\" coupling `u*` in ϕ⁴ theory. In quantum field theory, a fixed point is a value of a coupling constant where its running with energy scale, described by the beta function `β(u)`, stops. In other words, we need to find `u*` such that `β(u*) = 0`.\n2.  **State the Beta Function:** For the ϕ⁴ theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling `u` is a standard result:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + (3u²)/(16π²)`\n3.  **Formulate the Equation:** To find the fixed point `u*`, we set the beta function to zero:\n    `-ϵu* + (3(u*)²)/(16π²) = 0`\n4.  **Solve for the Fixed Point:** This equation has a trivial solution `u* = 0` (the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial one, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We are interested in the non-trivial solution.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics. The script will:\n    *   Define the symbolic variables `u`, `ϵ`, and `π`.\n    *   Construct the beta function expression.\n    *   Solve the equation `β(u) = 0` for `u`.\n    *   Extract and display the non-trivial solution, which represents the leading-order expression for `u*`.\n    *   The final output will be formatted to clearly show the numerical components of the expression.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the symbols we will use in our equation.\nu_star, epsilon, pi = sp.symbols('u* epsilon pi')\n\n# The leading order beta function for the phi^4 theory coupling 'u' in\n# d = 4 - epsilon dimensions is given by:\n# β(u) = -ε*u + (3*u^2) / (16*π^2)\n#\n# A fixed point u* is found by solving the equation β(u*) = 0.\nbeta_function_equation = sp.Eq(-epsilon * u_star + (3 * u_star**2) / (16 * pi**2), 0)\n\nprint(\"To find the fixed point coupling u*, we must solve the equation β(u*) = 0:\")\nprint(\"The equation is: -ε*u* + (3 * (u*)^2) / (16 * π^2) = 0\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n\n# Use sympy's solver to find the values of u* that satisfy the equation.\nsolutions = sp.solve(beta_function_equation, u_star)\n\n# The solver returns two solutions:\n# 1. The trivial Gaussian fixed point (u* = 0)\n# 2. The non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n# We are interested in the non-trivial solution.\nwilson_fisher_fixed_point = [s for s in solutions if s != 0][0]\n\n# To meet the requirement of outputting each number, we can extract\n# the numerator and denominator of the coefficient.\ncoeff = wilson_fisher_fixed_point / epsilon\nnum_coeff, den_coeff = coeff.as_numer_denom()\n\n# Print the final result in a clear, readable format.\nprint(\"The non-trivial solution for the fixed point coupling (the Wilson-Fisher fixed point) is:\")\nprint(f\"u* = ({num_coeff} * π**2 / {den_coeff}) * ε\")\n\n```\n<<<(16 * pi**2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
