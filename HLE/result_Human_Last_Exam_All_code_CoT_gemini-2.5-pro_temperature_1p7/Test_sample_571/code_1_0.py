# Define symbolic variables
# q_param and z_param are parameters for the Ocneanu trace on the Hecke algebra
# x_poly and y_poly are variables for the HOMFLY polynomial
q_param, z_param, x_poly, y_poly = sympy.symbols('q z x y')

# The problem states that the mapping q -> x^a, z -> x^b*y
# takes the trace tr(f(beta)) to the HOMFLY polynomial P(x,y).
# We are asked to find the values of a and b.

# Based on a standard convention for relating the trace to the HOMFLY polynomial
# (e.g., as in Kassel's "Quantum Groups"), we have the following relations
# between the Hecke parameters (q, z) and the HOMFLY variables (x, y):
# 1. q = x^2
# 2. z = y (or more generally, z is a function of y alone).

# From the problem statement, we have the substitutions:
# 1. q = x^a
# 2. z = x^b * y

# By comparing the two sets of relations, we can solve for a and b.
# From q = x^a and q = x^2, we get:
a = 2

# From z = x^b*y and z = y, we get x^b*y = y, which implies x^b = 1.
# For this to hold for any x, the exponent b must be 0.
b = 0

# Print the results in the requested format.
# The final mapping is q -> x^2, z -> y
