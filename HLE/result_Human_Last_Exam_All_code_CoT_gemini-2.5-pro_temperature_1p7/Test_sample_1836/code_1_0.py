    This function explains the solution to the problem step-by-step.
    Since the problem involves large cardinals like kappa, it cannot be computed directly.
    The function prints the reasoning to arrive at the answer.
    The final equation is symbolic, and the numbers referred to in the prompt are
    the small integers used in the derivation of the form of the sets X_n.
