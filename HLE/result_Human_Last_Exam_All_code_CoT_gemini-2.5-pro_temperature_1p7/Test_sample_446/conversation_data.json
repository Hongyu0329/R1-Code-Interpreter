    "This is a knowledge-based question from the field of biochemistry and cell biology. The task is to identify which of the given peptides is most famously known or highly likely to bind to an integrin receptor. All peptides share the core 'RGD' (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic Acid) motif, which is the primary recognition site for many integrins. The binding specificity and affinity are often determined by the amino acids flanking this core motif.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to:\n1.  Store the list of peptide options.\n2.  Provide a stored explanation for each peptide's likelihood of binding, based on established biological knowledge.\n3.  Focus on identifying the most well-characterized and commonly cited sequence in scientific literature. The 'RGDSP' sequence, derived from fibronectin, is a classic example used extensively in *in vitro* assays.\n4.  Print the analysis for all options and conclude with the most likely candidate.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_integrin_binding_peptides():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of RGD-containing peptides to determine which is the most\n    well-established binder of integrin receptors.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Dictionary of the peptide choices\n    peptides = {\n        'A': 'RGDMAA',\n        'B': 'RGDSPSS',\n        'C': 'RGDLTTP',\n        'D': 'RGDQVSK',\n        'E': 'RGDARGG'\n    }\n\n    # Stored knowledge about the flanking sequences' effects on integrin binding\n    reasoning = {\n        'A': \"The flanking sequence 'MAA' is not a widely recognized or classic motif for promoting RGD-integrin binding.\",\n        'B': \"The sequence 'RGDSP' is a well-known binding motif derived from fibronectin, a major extracellular matrix protein.
