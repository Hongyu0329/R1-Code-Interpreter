# Plan:
# 1. Evaluate each of the 10 geological statements.
# 2. Assign "C" for a consensus view and "D" for a debated statement.
# 3. Concatenate the results into a single string.
# 4. Print the final string.

# Statement analysis:
# (1) Morrison formation as foredeep deposit: Consensus. Result: C
# (2) Metamorphic core complexes from slab window: Debated. There are multiple competing hypotheses. Result: D
# (3) "Nevadaplano" plateau existence: Widely accepted, a consensus model. Result: C
# (4) "Arizonaplano" via magmatic thickening: A specific, non-consensus hypothesis. Result: D
# (5) Laramide structures are inboard of Sevier structures: A fundamental, consensus observation. Result: C
# (6) Sierra Nevada & Idaho batholiths from arc magmatism: Foundational, consensus concept. Result: C
# (7) Southwestward propagation of ignimbrites: A well-documented, consensus observation. Result: C
# (8) Colorado Plateau uplift timing: A classic, long-running debate. Result: D
# (9) Cascades Arc uplift timing: Highly debated, especially the timing of achieving modern elevation. Result: D
# (10) Laramide deformation from Shatsky conjugate: A leading but debated hypothesis among others. Result: D

# Combine the results into a single string
final_answer_string = "CDCDCCCDDD"
