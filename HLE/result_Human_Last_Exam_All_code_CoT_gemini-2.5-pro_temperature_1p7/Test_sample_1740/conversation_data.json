    "To determine the number of let-7 family members in humans, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Scope:** The \"let-7 family\" in humans classically refers to a specific group of microRNAs that share a highly conserved seed sequence. I will identify the canonical members of this family.\n2.  **List the Members:** Based on established microRNA databases like miRBase and NCBI, the core members are: let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98. Although some of these members are encoded by multiple genes, they produce the same mature microRNA and are counted as single members.\n3.  **Code to Count and Display:** I will write a Python script that stores these members in a list, prints an equation representing the count, and outputs the final number.\n\n```python\ndef count_let7_family_members():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts and displays the number of canonical members\n    of the let-7 microRNA family identified in humans.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The canonical members of the human let-7 family\n    let7_family_members = [\n        \"let-7a\", \"let-7b\", \"let-7c\", \"let-7d\", \"let-7e\",\n        \"let-7f\", \"let-7g\", \"let-7i\", \"miR-98\"\n    ]\n\n    count = len(let7_family_members)\n\n    # Build and print the equation string\n    equation_parts = []\n    for member in let7_family_members:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"1\")\n\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"The number of human let-7 family members can be calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {count}\")\n    print(\"\\nThese members are:\")\n    for member in let7_family_members:\n        print(f\"- {member}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTo date, {count} members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans.\")\n\ncount_let7_family_members()\n```\n<<<9>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
