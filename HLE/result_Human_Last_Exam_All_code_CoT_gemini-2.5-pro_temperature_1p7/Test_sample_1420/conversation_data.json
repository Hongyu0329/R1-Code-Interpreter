    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat, we will use the epsilon (ϵ) expansion, a cornerstone of renormalization group theory. This method calculates critical exponents as a series in ϵ = d_c - d, where d_c is the upper critical dimension and d is the spatial dimension.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Identify the upper critical dimension (d_c) for the relevant universality class (the n-vector model, which includes the standard Ising model).\n2.  Calculate ϵ = d_c - d for our case where d=3.\n3.  Use the well-established formula for the specific heat exponent α, calculated to the first order in ϵ. This formula is α = (4 - n) * ϵ / (2 * (n + 8)), where 'n' is the number of components of the order parameter. We will assume the Ising model case (n=1), which is standard unless specified otherwise.\n4.  Substitute the values of n and ϵ into the formula to calculate α.\n5.  The Python code below will perform this calculation and print each step, showing how the final value is obtained.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the first-order epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Spatial dimension\n    d = 3\n    \n    # Upper critical dimension for the n-vector model\n    d_c = 4\n    \n    # Number of components of the order parameter (n=1 for Ising model)\n    n = 1\n    \n    # Calculate epsilon (ϵ)\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n    \n    # Calculate the terms for the first-order alpha formula\n    # Formula: α = (4 - n) * ϵ / (2 * (n + 8))\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    denominator_term_1 = 2\n    denominator_term_2 = n + 8\n    \n    # Calculate the final value of alpha\n    alpha = (numerator * epsilon) / (denominator_term_1 * denominator_term_2)\n    \n    # --- Outputting the explanation and calculation ---\n    print(\"Calculating the specific heat exponent α for d=3 using the first-order epsilon expansion.\")\n    print(f\"The upper critical dimension is d_c = {d_c}.\")\n    print(f\"The spatial dimension is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, epsilon is ϵ = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}.\")\n    print(f\"The universality class is assumed to be the Ising model, so n = {n}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe first-order expansion formula for α is: α = (4 - n) * ϵ / (2 * (n + 8))\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\")\n    print(f\"α = (4 - {n}) * {epsilon} / (2 * ({n} + 8))\")\n    print(f\"α = ({numerator}) * {epsilon} / ({denominator_term_1} * {denominator_term_2})\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator * epsilon} / {denominator_term_1 * denominator_term_2}\")\n    print(f\"α = 1/6\")\n    print(f\"The numerical value is α ≈ {alpha}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_alpha_exponent()\n\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
