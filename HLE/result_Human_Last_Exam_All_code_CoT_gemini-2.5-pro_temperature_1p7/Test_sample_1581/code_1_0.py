# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes
# for a compact connected metric space X where the configuration space of n distinct points
# F_n(X) is disconnected for some n >= 2.
#
# Our analysis concludes that the properties of the disconnection
# implicitly single out a unique structure. The simple and uniform nature of the
# disconnection in the case of a linear ordering points to the closed interval [0,1].
#
# Let C be the number of distinct homeomorphism classes.
# The reasoning leads to the conclusion that C = 1.
# The final equation is C = 1. We will print the number in this equation.

c = 1
