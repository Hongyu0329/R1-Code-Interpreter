    # 1. Define the unexpected offspring based on the problem description.

    # Bridges' experiments were designed to trace chromosome inheritance. A cross between a
    # homozygous recessive female (e.g., white-eyed, XwXw) and a dominant male (e.g., red-eyed, Xw+Y)
    # showed that exceptional red-eyed males (Xw+0) must get their X from the father.
    # This implies the mother must have contributed a gamete with no X chromosome.

    # 4. Show the fertilization "equation" that creates the offspring.
    # In this context, "equation" means showing the gametes that combine.

    # 5. Conclude based on the evidence.
    # The evidence clearly points to non-disjunction in the female. Choices A and B both describe this.
    # However, Meiosis I non-disjunction is the failure of homologous chromosomes to segregate,
    # which is the primary mechanism demonstrated by Bridges' discovery of primary non-disjunction.
