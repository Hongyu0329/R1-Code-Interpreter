# The problem asks for the fewest random bits required to generate a uniform
# random n-bit floating-point number over the unit interval [0, 1].
# Our step-by-step derivation shows that this value is given by the
# formula m + log_2(B), where m is the number of mantissa bits and B is the bias.

# This code will print the derived formula.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as
# printing the final derived expression itself.

final_formula = "m + log_2(B)"
