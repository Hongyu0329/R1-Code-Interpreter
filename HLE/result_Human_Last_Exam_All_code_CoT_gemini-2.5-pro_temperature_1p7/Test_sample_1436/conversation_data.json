    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script to calculate the symmetry factor for the described Feynman diagram.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Diagram:** The Feynman diagram described has two vertices and four field contractions (propagators) connecting them. This means we have two points, and four identical lines running between these two points.\n2.  **Sources of Symmetry:** The symmetry factor `S` of a diagram is the number of ways its components (vertices and lines) can be rearranged without changing the diagram's structure. We identify two sources of symmetry here:\n    *   **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are identical. Swapping them results in the same diagram. This contributes a factor of `2!`.\n    *   **Propagator Permutations:** The four propagators connecting the vertices are also identical. They can be permuted among themselves in any way, leaving the diagram unchanged. This contributes a factor of `4!`.\n3.  **Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the symmetry factors from all independent sources.\n    *   `S = (Vertex Permutations) * (Propagator Permutations)`\n    *   `S = 2! * 4!`\n4.  **Implementation:** The Python script will define the number of vertices and propagators, calculate the factorial for each, multiply them, and print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_feynman_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram\n    with two vertices connected by four propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the characteristics of the diagram\n    num_vertices = 2\n    num_propagators = 4\n\n    print(\"Calculating the symmetry factor (S) for a Feynman diagram with two vertices connected by four identical propagators.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Explain the sources of symmetry\n    print(f\"There are two sources of symmetry in this diagram:\")\n    print(f\"1.
