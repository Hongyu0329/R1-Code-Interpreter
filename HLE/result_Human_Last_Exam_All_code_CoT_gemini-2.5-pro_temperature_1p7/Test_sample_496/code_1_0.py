# The problem reduces to calculating the total rank of H_T^*(T_reg) for T=S^1 x S^1,
# which is the sum of ranks of H^*(T_reg) tensor H^*(BT) up to degree 100.
# The rank of H^k(A) for k=2m is given by the formula: rank(A^{2m}) = 4 * (m+1).
# We need to sum this from m=0 to m=50 (since 2*50=100).
# The total rank is given by the summation: sum_{m=0 to 50} 4*(m+1).

# Let's perform the calculation.
# The summation can be rewritten as 4 * sum_{j=1 to 51} j.

# Calculate the sum of the first 51 integers, which is n*(n+1)/2 for n=51.
n = 51
sum_of_integers = n * (n + 1) // 2

# The formula for the total rank is 4 * sum_of_integers.
total_rank = 4 * sum_of_integers

# Output the components of the final calculation as requested.
print(f"The calculation for the total rank is based on the summation of ranks for even degrees up to 100.")
print(f"The rank in degree 2m is 4*(m+1). We sum this from m=0 to 50.")
print(f"This is equivalent to the expression: 4 * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 51)")
print(f"The sum of the integers from 1 to 51 is: {sum_of_integers}")
print(f"The final equation for the total rank is: 4 * {sum_of_integers} = {total_rank}")

# Final Answer
print("\nThe total rank of A as an abelian group in degree * <= 100 is:")
