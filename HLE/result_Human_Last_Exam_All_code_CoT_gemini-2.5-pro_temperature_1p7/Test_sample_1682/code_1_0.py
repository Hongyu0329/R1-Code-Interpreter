# The user wants me to identify the incorrect statement among the given options.
# My task is to evaluate the historical accuracy of each statement about Chinese wedding traditions.

# Statement A: Mentions Ming Dynasty attire including the dragon and phoenix robe and phoenix crown. This is largely accurate as Ming dynasty formalized many aspects of wedding attire, with the phoenix crown being a key element for brides.
# Statement B: Describes brides in the Zhou Dynasty using a silk veil. This is a well-documented ancient custom.
# Statement C: Claims brides used folding fans to cover their faces in the Tang and Song dynasties. This is incorrect. The folding fan was not common in China during the Tang Dynasty; they used rigid, round fans. Folding fans were introduced later and became popular in the Ming Dynasty.
# Statement D: Discusses the xiapei and phoenix crown post-Song Dynasty. This is accurate; these items were standard formal attire for married women of status.
# Statement E: Describes typical Qing Dynasty Han bridal wear. The red robe, red skirt, and embroidered shoes are a classic and accurate depiction.

# The incorrect statement is C because the folding fan was not customary in the Tang Dynasty.
