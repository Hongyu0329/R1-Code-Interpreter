# 1. Calculate the decay constant (Î») for Indium-111
lambda_val = math.log(2) / T_HALF_HOURS

# 2. Calculate the required activity at the time of compounding (A_needed)
# This accounts for the decay between compounding and injection.

A_needed = A_dose * math.exp(lambda_val * time_decay_hours)

# 3. Calculate the activity of the stock vial at compounding time (A_stock_now)
# This accounts for the decay from compounding time until the future calibration time.

time_to_cal_hours = time_to_cal_td.total_seconds() / 3600
A_stock_now = A_calibrated * math.exp(lambda_val * time_to_cal_hours)

# 4. Calculate the concentration of the stock vial at compounding time
concentration_now = A_stock_now / V_calibrated

# 5. Calculate the final volume to be drawn
volume_to_draw = A_needed / concentration_now

# --- Output the Result ---
