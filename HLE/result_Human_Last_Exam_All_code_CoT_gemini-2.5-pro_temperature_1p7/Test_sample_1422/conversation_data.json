    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we will use the topological relations of Feynman graphs.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Key Formulas:** The structure of any connected Feynman diagram is governed by two main topological rules:\n    *   The loop formula: `L = I - V + 1`, where `L` is the number of loops, `I` is the number of internal lines (propagators), and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   The vertex-line counting rule: `n * V = 2 * I + E`, where `n` is the number of lines meeting at each vertex (determined by the interaction term, e.g., `n=4` for a $\\phi^4$ theory), and `E` is the number of external lines.\n2.  **Set Up the Problem:** We are given that the diagram must have two loops, so `L=2`. We want to find the minimum possible integer value for `V`. To find the topological minimum, we can consider the simplest class of diagrams, which are vacuum diagrams (those with no external lines), so we can set `E=0`.\n3.  **Analyze Common Theories:** I will solve this system of equations for the two most common types of interacting scalar field theories:\n    *   $\\phi^4$ theory, where `n=4`.\n    *   $\\phi^3$ theory, where `n=3`.\n4.  **Solve and Compare:** For each case, I will calculate the required number of vertices `V`. The overall minimum will be the smaller of these results.\n5.  **Final Code:** The Python script will perform these calculations, explaining each step and printing the final answer along with the simple equation that leads to it.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_for_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in an interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # L is the number of loops\n    L = 2\n    # E is the number of external lines.
