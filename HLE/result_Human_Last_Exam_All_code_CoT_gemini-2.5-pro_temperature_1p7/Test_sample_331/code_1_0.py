# Let's compute the pair (m(X), M(X)) for each of the four varieties.
# The final result is a tuple of four pairs.

# Case 1: X_1, a genus 2 curve.
# A curve of genus g=2 is always hyperelliptic.
# For a hyperelliptic curve of genus g=2, the minimum value m(X_1) is achieved
# at its 2g+2=6 Weierstrass points, and this value is 2.
# The maximum value M(X_1) is attained at any other point and is g+1 = 2+1 = 3.
m_X1 = 2
M_X1 = 2 + 1

# Case 2: X_2, a general genus 7 curve.
# For a general (non-special) curve C of genus g, the Euclidean degree is
# constant for all points p in C and is equal to g+1.
# For X_2, the genus is g=7.
# Therefore, m(X_2) = M(X_2) = g+1 = 7+1 = 8.
g_X2 = 7
m_X2 = g_X2 + 1
M_X2 = g_X2 + 1

# Case 3: X_3, an Enriques surface.
# An Enriques surface X has h^1(X, O_X) = h^2(X, O_X) = 0.
# A theorem of Bloch-Srinivas implies that for such varieties, the Chow group
# of 0-cycles, CH_0(X), is isomorphic to the integers Z.
# This means for any two points p,q, we have [p] = [q] in CH_0(X).
# The defining equation for edeg(X,p) holds for d=1, making edeg(X,p)=1 for all p.
# Thus, m(X_3) = M(X_3) = 1.
m_X3 = 1
M_X3 = 1

# Case 4: X_4=G(3,6), a Grassmannian.
# Grassmannians are rationally connected varieties.
# For any rationally connected variety X, CH_0(X) is isomorphic to Z.
# The reasoning is the same as for the Enriques surface.
# edeg(X,p)=1 for all p. Thus, m(X_4) = M(X_4) = 1.
m_X4 = 1
M_X4 = 1

# We now format the final result as a single string.
# The numbers in the "final equation" are displayed in the print statements.
