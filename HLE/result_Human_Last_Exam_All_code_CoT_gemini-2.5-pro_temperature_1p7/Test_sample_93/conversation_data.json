    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$. This means we need to count all the unique ordered tuples $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that satisfy the equation, where each $x_i \\ge 0$.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Approach:** A naive brute-force method would involve five nested loops, iterating through all possible values for each variable. The maximum value for any $x_i$ is $\\lfloor\\sqrt{2024}\\rfloor = 44$. Five nested loops up to 44 would be computationally very expensive ($45^5$ iterations), so a more efficient method is needed.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Programming Strategy:** I will use a dynamic programming approach. Let's define `dp[k][n]` as the number of ways to express the integer `n` as a sum of `k` squares of non-negative integers. Our goal is to find `dp[5][2024]`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:** The value of `dp[k][n]` can be calculated based on the values for `k-1`. If we fix the value of the k-th variable, say $x_k = j$, then the remaining `k-1` variables must sum up to $n - j^2$. So, we can sum over all possible values of `j`:\n    \\[ dp[k][n] = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor} dp[k-1][n - j^2] \\]\n\n5.  **Establish the Base Case:** For `k=1`, the equation is $x_1^2 = n$. This has exactly one non-negative integer solution ($x_1 = \\sqrt{n}$) if `n` is a perfect square, and zero solutions otherwise. So, `dp[1][n]` is 1 if `n` is a perfect square, and 0 otherwise.\n\n6.  **Implement Iteratively:** I will implement this by calculating the counts for `k=1`, then using those to calculate the counts for `k=2`, and so on, up to `k=5`.\n\n7.  **Optimize for Space:** To compute the counts for `k` variables, we only need the counts from `k-1` variables. This means we don't need to store the entire `dp` table. We can optimize memory by only keeping two arrays: one for the previous step's counts (`k-1`) and one for the current step's counts (`k`).\n\n8.  **Final Code:** The Python script will execute this DP plan. It will initialize the counts for one variable, then loop from 2 to 5, updating the counts at each step. Finally, it will print the calculated number of solutions for 5 variables and the target value of 2024, also printing the equation itself as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_sum_of_squares_solutions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation\n    x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024 using dynamic programming.\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    num_vars = 5\n\n    # Let prev_counts[i] be the number of ways to write integer 'i' as a sum of k-1 squares.\n    # Initialize for k=1.\n    # The number of ways to write 'i' as one square is 1 if i is a perfect square, else 0.\n    prev_counts = [0] * (target + 1)\n    limit = math.isqrt(target)\n    for j in range(limit + 1):\n        prev_counts[j*j] = 1\n\n    # Iterate from k=2 to num_vars (5)\n    for k in range(2, num_vars + 1):\n        # Let current_counts[i] be the number of ways to write 'i' as a sum of k squares.\n        current_counts = [0] * (target + 1)\n        for i in range(target + 1):\n            limit_j = math.isqrt(i)\n            # dp[k][i] = sum(dp[k-1][i - j*j])\n            for j in range(limit_j + 1):\n                current_counts[i] += prev_counts[i - j*j]\n        # The results for k squares become the previous results for the next iteration (k+1).\n        prev_counts = current_counts\n\n    # The final result is the number of ways to write the target as a sum of 5 squares.\n    result = prev_counts[target]\n\n    # Format the output to display the equation and the solution.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join([f\"x_{i}^2\" for i in range(1, num_vars + 1)])\n    final_equation = f\"{equation_str} = {target}\"\n    \n    print(f\"The equation is: {final_equation}\")\n    print(f\"Each number x_i is a non-negative integer.\")\n    print(f\"The number of solutions is: {result}\")\n\ncount_sum_of_squares_solutions()\n```\n<<<21440>>>"
