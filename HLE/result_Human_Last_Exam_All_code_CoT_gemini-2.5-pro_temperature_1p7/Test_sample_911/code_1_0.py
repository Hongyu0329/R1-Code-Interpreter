    # Explanation of the Derivation
    explanation = """
    Step-by-step derivation:
    1.  The physics problem describes a scenario with a superconductor slab. The governing equations provided in the problem description are dimensionally inconsistent. Therefore, a standard physical model (London theory for superconductors) is used instead.
    2.  For a low-frequency wave in a superconductor, the magnetic field H is governed by d^2(H)/dx^2 - k^2*H = 0, with k = omega_p/c.
    3.  Solving this equation with the boundary condition H(x=0) = K_0*cos(omega*t) and the perfect conductor condition at x=d (which implies dH/dx = 0) yields the magnetic field at the x=d plane:
        H(d, t) = (K_0 / cosh(k*d)) * cos(omega*t).
    4.  The force per unit area on the perfect conductor is the magnetic pressure P_m = (1/2)*mu_0*H(d, t)^2.
    5.  Substituting H(d,t) gives the force:
        vec(f) = i_x * (1/2) * mu_0 * K_0**2 * cos**2(omega*t) / cosh**2(omega_p*d/c).
    6.  This result does not exactly match any answer choices. However, options B and E have the same core structure but with an additional factor of exp(Â±omega*d/c). Such a factor cannot be derived from standard theory or the flawed problem statement.
    7.  Choosing between the plausible options, an attenuation factor (negative exponential) is more physically realistic than an amplification factor (positive exponential). Thus, option E is selected as the most likely intended answer.
