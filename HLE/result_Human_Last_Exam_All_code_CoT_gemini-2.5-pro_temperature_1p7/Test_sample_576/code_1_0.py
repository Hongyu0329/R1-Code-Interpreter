    # Step 3: Analyze the Day Convolution
    # The set of elements of [F * G](.) is the quotient of F(.) x G(.) x A by an equivalence relation ~.
    # An element is a triple (x, f, h) where x is in F(.), f is in G(.), and h is in A.
    # With our findings, the elements are of the form (b, f_inf, h) for b, h in A.
    # The equivalence relation is generated by:
    # 1. (a.x, f, h) ~ (x, f, gcd(h,a))
    # 2. (x, a.f, h) ~ (x, f, gcd(h,a))
    #
    # Let's analyze the relation on (b, f_inf, h):
    # Relation 2: The action a.f_inf = f_inf for all a. So the relation becomes
    # (b, f_inf, h) ~ (b, f_inf, gcd(h,a)). Taking a=1, we have (b, f_inf, h) ~ (b, f_inf, 1).
    # Every element is equivalent to one where h=1.
    #
    # Relation 1 on these representatives: (a.b, f_inf, 1) ~ (b, f_inf, gcd(1, a)).
    # Since a.b = gcd(a,b), this is (gcd(a,b), f_inf, 1) ~ (b, f_inf, 1).
    # This creates an equivalence on the first component: b is equivalent to any of its divisors d = gcd(a,b).
    # By transitivity, if d|b, then d~b.
    # Since 1 divides all k in {1,...,8}, they are all equivalent to 1.
    # And since 'a' divides 'inf' for all a in A (as gcd(a,inf)=a), 'inf' is equivalent to all other elements.
    # Therefore, all elements of A fall into a single equivalence class.
    # This means the entire set of triples collapses into a single equivalence class.
