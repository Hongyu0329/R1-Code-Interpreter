    "My plan to answer this question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the key concepts in the user's question: a Christian theologian, specialized terminology, changes in laws of nature, the virgin birth, and the Fall.\n2.  I will access my knowledge base of theology and philosophy to find a theologian who fits this description. The question asks for the *first* to develop such terminology, which points toward a foundational figure in Christian thought.\n3.  I will identify Augustine of Hippo as the correct theologian. His concepts, particularly the *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons), provide a framework for understanding how God can act outside the usual course of nature without violating the order He established. This framework is applicable to both miracles like the virgin birth and potential changes to the natural world at the Fall.\n4.  Finally, as per the instructions, I will create a simple Python script to print the name of the theologian.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology\n  to describe potential changes in the laws of nature.\n  \"\"\"\n  theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n  \n  # Augustine developed concepts like the \"rationes seminales\" (seminal reasons)\n  # to explain that God embedded all future possibilities into creation from the beginning.\n  # A miracle like the virgin birth, therefore, is not God changing the laws of nature,\n  # but rather activating a potentiality that was always present but outside the\n  # normal chain of cause and effect. This framework could also apply to changes\n  # in the natural world's operation after the Fall.\n\n  print(theologian_name)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
