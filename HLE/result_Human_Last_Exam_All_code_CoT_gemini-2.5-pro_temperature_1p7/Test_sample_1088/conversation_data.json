    "Of course. To determine the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set, we first need to understand the notation and know the molecule in question, as the total number depends on the specific atoms involved. Since no molecule was provided, I will write a Python script that calculates this for a given molecular formula. I will use chloromethane (`CH3Cl`) as a specific example in the code, which you can easily change.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name:** I will first explain what `6-311G**` means for different types of atoms.\n    *   The `6-311G` part describes how core and valence atomic orbitals are represented. This is a \"triple-split valence\" basis set. The representation differs for atoms in different rows of the periodic table.\n    *   The `**` part indicates the addition of \"polarization functions\", which improve the description of chemical bonding. The first `*` adds d-type functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms, and the second `*` adds p-type functions to hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Count Primitives per Atom:** I will determine the number of primitive Gaussians for atoms based on their period (row in the periodic table).\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 8 primitives.\n    *   **2nd Period Heavy Atoms (B, C, N, O, F):** 32 primitives.\n    *   **3rd Period Heavy Atoms (Al, Si, P, S, Cl):** 48 primitives.\n3.  **Develop a Python Script:** The script will:\n    *   Take a molecular formula string (e.g., \"CH3Cl\").\n    *   Parse the formula to count the number of each type of atom.\n    *   Use the pre-determined primitive counts to calculate the total for the molecule.\n    *   Print the final calculation, showing each term in the sum, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_6_311G_star_star_primitives():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of primitive Gaussian functions\n    for a given molecule with the 6-311G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- You can change the molecular formula here ---\n    # Examples: \"H2O\", \"CH4\", \"C6H6\", \"NH3\"\n    molecular_formula = \"CH3Cl\"\n\n    # Number of primitive Gaussians for different elements in the 6-311G** basis set.\n    # This is derived from the standard definition of the basis set.\n    # H: 5s (from 3,1,1 split) + 3p (from **) = 8\n    # Period 2 (C,N,O..): 6s(core) + 20sp(valence) + 6d(**) = 32\n    # Period 3 (Si,P,S..): Have a more complex core structure, summing to 48 primitives.\n    primitives_per_atom = {\n        # Period 1\n        'H': 8,\n        # Period 2\n        'Li': 32, 'Be': 32, 'B': 32, 'C': 32, 'N': 32, 'O': 32, 'F': 32, 'Ne': 32,\n        # Period 3\n        'Na': 48, 'Mg': 48, 'Al': 48, 'Si': 48, 'P': 48, 'S': 48, 'Cl': 48, 'Ar': 48,\n    }\n\n    # Parse the molecular formula into a dictionary of atom counts.\n    # e.g., \"CH3Cl\" -> {'C': 1, 'H': 3, 'Cl': 1}\n    tokens = re.findall('([A-Z][a-z]?)(\\d*)', molecular_formula)\n    atom_counts = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    for element, count in tokens:\n        if not element in primitives_per_atom:\n            print(f\"Warning: Element '{element}' is not supported by this script. It will be ignored.\")\n            continue\n        atom_counts[element] += int(count) if count else 1\n\n    if not atom_counts:\n        print(\"No supported atoms found in the formula.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the total number of primitives and create the equation string.\n    total_primitives = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    # Process atoms in a canonical order (C, H, then alphabetically)\n    element_order = sorted(atom_counts.keys(), key=lambda x: ('CH'.find(x), x))\n\n    for element in element_order:\n        count = atom_counts[element]\n        prims = primitives_per_atom[element]\n        total_primitives += count * prims\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{count} * {prims} ({element})\")\n\n    # Print the final result\n    print(f\"Calculation for {molecular_formula} with 6-311G** basis set:\")\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts) + f\" = {total_primitives}\"\n    print(final_equation)\n    print(f\"\\nTotal primitive Gaussians = {total_primitives}\")\n\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_6_311G_star_star_primitives()\n```\n<<<104>>>"
