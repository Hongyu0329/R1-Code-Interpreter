    Analyzes the correctness of seven statements related to the rational closure
    of the cone of positive definite matrices and its decompositions.

    The analysis for each statement is as follows:
    a) True. The quotient space is the Satake compactification, which is Hausdorff.
    b) True. The barycentric subdivision of any polyhedral complex is simplicial by definition.
    c) True. Admissible decompositions like the Voronoi decompositions are locally finite.
    d) True. The number of orbits of perfect forms for g=7 is a known result, and the statement correctly refers to "maximal" cones.
    e) True. A cone intersecting the interior space of positive-definite matrices has a finite stabilizer, a classic result from reduction theory.
    f) False. The number 222 is for the orbits of *maximal* cones (Delaunay types) in dimension 5. The total number of orbits of cones of all dimensions is larger.
    g) False. The stabilizer of a face is generally larger than, not a subset of, the stabilizer of the cone.
