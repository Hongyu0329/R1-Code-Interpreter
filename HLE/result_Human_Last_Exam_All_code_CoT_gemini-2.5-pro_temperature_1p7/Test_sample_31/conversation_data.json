    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the absolute minimum number of side-sticker colors a person must look at to have enough information to uniquely distinguish any of the 21 PLL cases from each other.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to find the minimum number of stickers on the vertical faces of the last layer that must be inspected to identify which one of the **21** possible PLL cases you have. The top-face colors are all the same, so they provide no useful information.\n\n2.  **Information Theory:** From an information theory perspective, we need to distinguish 21 states. If each sticker could be one of 4 colors, we would need `log4(21)` stickers. Since `4^2 = 16` (too small) and `4^3 = 64` (plenty), it might seem that 3 stickers are enough. However, the sticker colors are not independent; they are linked by the geometry of the cube and the limited permutations of the pieces. A more practical approach is to find the \"worst-case scenario\" – the most similar pair of PLLs – and see what it takes to tell them apart.\n\n3.  **Find the Hardest Case:** The most complex and similar PLLs are the four G-permutations. Let's analyze what it takes to distinguish between two of the most similar G-perms, for example, the **Ga** and **Gd** perms.\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Worst Case\":**\n    *   Both the Ga and Gd perms can be oriented so they have \"headlights\" on the same face. \"Headlights\" occur when the two corner pieces on a side have matching side-stickers. Let's say we orient the cube so the headlights for both cases are on the Right face. To confirm you have headlights, you must look at the **2** corresponding corner stickers.\n    *   At this point, you've seen 2 stickers, but you still can't tell if you have a Ga or a Gd perm because they both look identical from the right side.\n    *   The feature that distinguishes them is the location of a 1x2 \"block\" (a correctly placed edge-corner pair). In this orientation, Ga has its block on the back-left, while Gd has its block on the front-left.\n    *   To find which one you have, you must inspect the left side of the cube. To confirm the presence and location of the block, you need to see the sticker on the edge piece and the sticker on the adjacent corner piece. This requires looking at another **2** stickers.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum:** To reliably distinguish between these two specific cases, you must see the 2 stickers that form the headlights and the 2 stickers that form the distinguishing block.\n\n    *   Number of stickers for headlights = 2\n    *   Number of stickers for the distinguishing block = 2\n    *   Total stickers = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSince there exists a pair of cases that requires inspecting 4 stickers to be told apart, the minimum number needed to guarantee identification for *any* case cannot be lower than 4. Therefore, the minimum number is 4.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_stickers():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers\n    required to identify a PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # There are 21 distinct PLL cases to differentiate.\n    num_pll_cases = 21\n\n    # The analysis focuses on the \"worst-case scenario\" - distinguishing the most\n    # similar PLL cases, which are typically found within the four G-perms.\n    \n    # Let's consider distinguishing two similar G-perms (e.g., Ga and Gd).\n    # Both can be oriented to show \"headlights\" on one face (e.g., the right face).\n    # \"Headlights\" are when the side stickers of the two corners on a face match.\n    # To confirm you have headlights, you must observe these two stickers.\n    stickers_for_headlights = 2\n    \n    # After observing the headlights, the two G-perms can still appear identical.\n    # The feature that distinguishes them is the location of a 1x2 \"block\"\n    # (an adjacent edge and corner whose side stickers match).\n    # To find this block, you need to look at a different face.
