    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  First, I need to identify the formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface. The formula is $c = d - \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i$, where $d$ is the degree of the defining polynomial and $w_i$ are the weights of the variables.\n2.  Next, I'll determine the degree, $d$, of the polynomial. A polynomial defining a hypersurface in a weighted projective space must be weighted-homogeneous. This means every term in the polynomial must have the same total weighted degree. I will calculate the degree for each term using the provided weights $w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n3.  The polynomial is $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$. Let's check the weighted degree of each term:\n    *   $z_1^8z_3$: $8 \\times 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$\n    *   $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$: $4 \\times 22 + 3 \\times 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$\n    *   $z_1z_2^7$: $1 \\times 22 + 7 \\times 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$\n    *   $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$: $22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$\n    *   $z_2z_3^4$: $29 + 4 \\times 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$\n    *   $z_4^3z_5$: $3 \\times 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$\n    *   $z_5^3$: $3 \\times 75 = 225$\n4.  As you can see, all terms except one have a degree of 225. This strongly suggests a typo in the polynomial's second term, and the intended degree for the well-defined Calabi-Yau hypersurface is $d = 225$. This is also a necessary condition for a manifold to be Calabi-Yau ($d=\\sum w_i$).\n5.  Then, I will calculate the sum of the weights, $\\sum w_i$.\n6.  Finally, I will substitute these values into the formula to find the invariant, $c$. The Python code will perform these calculations and print the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_cn_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau Link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights for the variables (z1, z2, z3, z4, z5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # The polynomial equation is F = 0, where F is a weighted-homogeneous polynomial.\n    # The degree 'd' of the polynomial is the weighted degree of any of its terms.\n    # From the problem description, almost all terms have a weighted degree of 225.\n    # For a hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau, its degree must equal the sum of the weights.\n    # We will assume the intended degree is 225.\n    degree = 225\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the weights\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n\n    # The Crawley-Nordström invariant is given by the formula: c = d - Σw_i\n    cn_invariant = degree - sum_of_weights\n\n    # Format the output to show the full equation as requested\n    weight_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights))\n\n    print(f\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant 'c' is calculated using the formula: d - Σw_i\")\n    print(f\"The degree of the polynomial 'd' is {degree}.\")\n    print(f\"The sum of the weights 'Σw_i' is {sum_of_weights}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{degree} - ({weight_sum_str}) = {cn_invariant}\")\n\ncalculate_cn_invariant()\n<<<0>>>\n```"
