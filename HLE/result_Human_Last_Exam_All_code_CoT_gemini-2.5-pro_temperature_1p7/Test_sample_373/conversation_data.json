    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Model the Graph:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes and uniform weights is best represented as two identical, fully connected graphs (cliques), connected by a single edge. To keep it symmetric, we'll model it as two 5-node cliques (K5). The edge connecting one node from each clique is the \"bottleneck\" edge.\n\n2.  **Understand the Process:** Randomized uniform gossiping means a node is selected uniformly at random from the entire graph, and then that node selects one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to interact with.\n\n3.  **Calculate Key Values:**\n    *   **Total Nodes (N):** 10.\n    *   **Probability of selecting any node:** `1 / N = 1 / 10`.\n    *   **Degree of a bottleneck node:** Let the bottleneck edge connect nodes `u` and `v`. Node `u` is in a 5-node clique, so it's connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique. It's also connected to `v`. Therefore, its degree is `d(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`. By symmetry, `d(v) = 5`.\n    *   **Probability of a bottleneck node selecting its counterpart:** The probability of node `u` selecting `v` from its neighbors is `1 / d(u) = 1 / 5`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Probability:** The bottleneck edge is \"sampled\" if either (a) node `u` is chosen and it selects `v`, or (b) node `v` is chosen and it selects `u`. Since these are mutually exclusive events, we can add their probabilities.\n    *   `P(u is chosen AND u selects v) = P(u is chosen) * P(u selects v) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`\n    *   `P(v is chosen AND v selects u) = P(v is chosen) * P(v selects u) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`\n    *   **Total Probability** = `1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic and prints the detailed calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the parameters for a 10-node barbell graph.\n#    This consists of two 5-node cliques connected by a single edge.\n# 2. Determine the degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n# 3. Model the randomized uniform gossiping process. This involves two steps:\n#    a. Select a node uniformly at random from the whole graph.\n#    b. The selected node picks a neighbor uniformly at random.\n# 4. Calculate the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge. This can happen in two ways:\n#    a. Node `u` at one end of the bottleneck is chosen, and it picks node `v`.\n#    b. Node `v` is chosen, and it picks node `u`.\n# 5. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events.\n\n# Parameters of the barbell graph\ntotal_nodes = 10\n# The most symmetric structure is two cliques of equal size.\nclique_size = 5\n\n# Let the bottleneck edge connect nodes 'u' and 'v'.\n# Node 'u' is in the first clique, and node 'v' is in the second.\n\n# The degree of a node in a clique of size `m` is `m-1`.\n# The nodes 'u' and 'v' also have one additional connection, the bottleneck edge.\n# So, their degree is (clique_size - 1) + 1.\ndegree_of_bottleneck_node = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n# --- Probability Calculation ---\n\n# In uniform gossiping, any node is chosen with probability 1 / N.\nprob_choose_any_node = 1 / total_nodes\n\n# If a bottleneck node (e.g., 'u') is chosen, the probability it selects its\n# neighbor across the bottleneck ('v') is 1 / degree(u).\nprob_bottleneck_node_selects_neighbor = 1 / degree_of_bottleneck_node\n\n# The probability of sampling the edge in the direction u -> v is:\n# P(choose u) * P(u selects v)\nprob_path_u_to_v = prob_choose_any_node * prob_bottleneck_node_selects_neighbor\n\n# By symmetry, the probability of sampling the edge in the direction v -> u is the same.\nprob_path_v_to_u = prob_choose_any_node * prob_bottleneck_node_selects_neighbor\n\n# The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of these two events.\ntotal_probability = prob_path_u_to_v + prob_path_v_to_u\n\n# --- Output the result ---\n\nprint(\"This script calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping.\")\nprint(f\"\\n1.
