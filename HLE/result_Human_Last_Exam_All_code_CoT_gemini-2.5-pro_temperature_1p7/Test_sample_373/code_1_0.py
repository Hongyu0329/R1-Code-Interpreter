# Plan:
# 1. Define the parameters for a 10-node barbell graph.
#    This consists of two 5-node cliques connected by a single edge.
# 2. Determine the degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.
# 3. Model the randomized uniform gossiping process. This involves two steps:
#    a. Select a node uniformly at random from the whole graph.
#    b. The selected node picks a neighbor uniformly at random.
# 4. Calculate the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge. This can happen in two ways:
#    a. Node `u` at one end of the bottleneck is chosen, and it picks node `v`.
#    b. Node `v` is chosen, and it picks node `u`.
# 5. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events.

# Parameters of the barbell graph
total_nodes = 10
# The most symmetric structure is two cliques of equal size.
clique_size = 5

# Let the bottleneck edge connect nodes 'u' and 'v'.
# Node 'u' is in the first clique, and node 'v' is in the second.

# The degree of a node in a clique of size `m` is `m-1`.
# The nodes 'u' and 'v' also have one additional connection, the bottleneck edge.
# So, their degree is (clique_size - 1) + 1.
degree_of_bottleneck_node = (clique_size - 1) + 1

# --- Probability Calculation ---

# In uniform gossiping, any node is chosen with probability 1 / N.
prob_choose_any_node = 1 / total_nodes

# If a bottleneck node (e.g., 'u') is chosen, the probability it selects its
# neighbor across the bottleneck ('v') is 1 / degree(u).
prob_bottleneck_node_selects_neighbor = 1 / degree_of_bottleneck_node

# The probability of sampling the edge in the direction u -> v is:
# P(choose u) * P(u selects v)
prob_path_u_to_v = prob_choose_any_node * prob_bottleneck_node_selects_neighbor

# By symmetry, the probability of sampling the edge in the direction v -> u is the same.
prob_path_v_to_u = prob_choose_any_node * prob_bottleneck_node_selects_neighbor

# The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of these two events.
total_probability = prob_path_u_to_v + prob_path_v_to_u

# --- Output the result ---
