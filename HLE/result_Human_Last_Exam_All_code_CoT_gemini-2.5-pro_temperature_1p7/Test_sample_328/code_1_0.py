# --- Analysis ---
# Species 1: Tridactylophagus tartari (a Strepsipteran)
# The adult male Strepsipteran has a very short life, typically lasting only a few hours.
# Its sole purpose after eclosing from its host is to find a female and mate.
# A reasonable estimate for its age at mating is in the range of a few hours.
male_strepsipteran_mating_age_estimate = "6 hours"
male_strepsipteran_mating_age_hours = 6

# Species 2: Periplaneta americana (American cockroach)
# After the final molt (eclosion), the male American cockroach needs time to become sexually mature.
# Scientific literature indicates this period is typically a few days (e.g., 2 to 7 days).
# An estimate of a couple of days is biologically sound for an early mating event.
male_cockroach_mating_age_estimate = "two days"
male_cockroach_mating_age_days = 2

# --- Conclusion ---
# We need to find the answer choice that best matches these estimates.
# Let's review the options:
# A. three weeks, three days
# B. one day, one day
# C. three days, six months
# D. three days, one day
# E. one week, one month
# F. three months, three months
# G. one day, one month
# H. 1 hour, six months
# I. 16 hours, one month
# J. one month, six months
# K. 6 hours, two days

# Choice K provides "6 hours" for the first species and "two days" for the second.
# This aligns perfectly with our biological analysis. The male Tridactylophagus tartari
# would likely mate very shortly after emerging, making 6 hours a strong estimate.
# The male Periplaneta americana becomes mature a few days after eclosion, making two days
# a reasonable estimate for a first mating.
