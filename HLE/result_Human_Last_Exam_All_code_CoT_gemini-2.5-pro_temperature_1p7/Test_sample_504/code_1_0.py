    This problem is a mathematical question about the maximum size of a set of vectors in C^6
    with specific angular properties. The solution relies on knowledge of advanced geometry and
    discrete mathematics, specifically the theory of root systems for Lie algebras.

    Let V be a set of unit vectors in C^6. The conditions on the angle between any two
    distinct vectors v, w in V are that it is pi/2 or pi/3. This translates to the
    magnitude of their inner product |(v, w)| being 0 or 1/2.
    The set must also contain at least one orthogonal pair, so |(v, w)| = 0 for some pair.

    We can construct such sets of vectors using root systems of Lie algebras. The vectors
    of a (normalized) root system often have a small number of possible inner products.

    1. A_6 root system: The roots are e_i - e_j for 1 <= i < j <= 7, projected to a
       6D subspace. This gives a set of 21 vectors that satisfy the conditions.

    2. D_6 root system: The roots are e_i +/- e_j for 1 <= i < j <= 6. After normalization
       and removing antipodal pairs, this gives a set of 30 vectors in R^6 (and thus in C^6)
       that satisfy the conditions.

    3. E_6 root system: This is an exceptional Lie algebra in 6 dimensions. Its root system
       consists of 72 vectors. Taking one vector from each antipodal pair {v, -v} gives a
       set of 36 vectors. When normalized, the inner product between any two distinct
       vectors from this set has a magnitude of 0, 1/2, or 1. The inner product of 1
       only occurs between a vector and itself, so for distinct vectors the condition
       is satisfied. This gives a set of 36 vectors meeting the criteria.

    These known constructions provide sets of size 21, 30, and 36. The problem asks for
    the largest possible number. Based on the theory of root systems and line packing,
    the set derived from the E_6 root system is known to be a maximal configuration
    for closely related problems.
