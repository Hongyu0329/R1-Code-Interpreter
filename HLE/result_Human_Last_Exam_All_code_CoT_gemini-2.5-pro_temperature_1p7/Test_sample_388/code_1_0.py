Hello Allison, I have your prescriptions for {medication1}, {medication2}, and {medication3} ready.
I noticed you were buying Excedrin and wanted to provide an important counseling point.

The {interacting_drug_1} you are taking can have a serious interaction with the {interacting_drug_2}.
When taken together, these two medications can increase your {risk}.

For future headaches, I would recommend a safer alternative that doesn't contain aspirin, such as a product with just {safer_alternative}.
Of course, if your headaches become frequent or severe, it would be best to follow up with your doctor.
