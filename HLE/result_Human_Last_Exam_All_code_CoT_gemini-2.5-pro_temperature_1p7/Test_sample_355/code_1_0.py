# Step 1: Define constants and givens
delta_m = 0.01  # Magnitude accuracy
mag = 20.0        # Apparent B-band magnitude of the star
D = 1.0         # Telescope diameter in meters

# B-band zero-point flux (photons/s/m^2) for a magnitude 0 star.
# This value is derived from standard astrophysical references (e.g., Bessell et al.)
F_B0 = 1.3e10

# Step 2: Calculate the required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
# The relation is delta_m is approx. (2.5 / ln(10)) * (1/SNR)
snr = (2.5 / math.log(10)) / delta_m
print(f"Given a magnitude uncertainty of {delta_m}, the required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is: {snr:.2f}")

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of photons (N) required
# For photon counting (Poisson statistics), SNR = sqrt(N)
N = snr**2
print(f"To achieve this SNR, the total number of photons to be collected (N) is: {N:.2f}")

# Step 4: Calculate the photon flux from the star
# F = F_0 * 10^(-m/2.5)
F_B20 = F_B0 * (10**(-mag / 2.5))
print(f"The photon flux from a magnitude {mag} star is: {F_B20:.2f} photons/s/m^2")

# Step 5: Calculate the photon detection rate of the telescope
# Telescope collecting area A = pi * (D/2)^2
A = math.pi * (D / 2)**2
# Photon detection rate R = F * A
R = F_B20 * A
print(f"A {D}m telescope has a collecting area of {A:.2f} m^2 and detects photons at a rate (R) of: {R:.2f} photons/s")

# Step 6: Calculate the required exposure time (t)
# t = N / R
t_seconds = N / R
print("\nFinal Calculation:")
print(f"Exposure Time = Total Photons / Photon Rate")
print(f"Exposure Time = {N:.2f} / {R:.2f}")
print(f"Exposure Time = {t_seconds:.2f} seconds")

# Round to the nearest integer
rounded_t = round(t_seconds)
print(f"\nThe required exposure time, rounded to the nearest integer, is {rounded_t} seconds.")
