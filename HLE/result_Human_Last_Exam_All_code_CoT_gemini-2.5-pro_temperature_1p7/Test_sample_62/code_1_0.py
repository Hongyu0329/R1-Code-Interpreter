# The riddle describes a category of items ("THEM") where some have "correct" shapes
# and others have "peculiar" shapes. This is characteristic of cheeses, which can be
# standard wheels or unique, artisanal forms.

# The clue that the name begins with "Cafi" is phonetic.
# It sounds like the beginning of "Caerphilly," a famous Welsh cheese.

# Therefore, the correct name is Caerphilly.
correct_name = "Caerphilly"

# We print the correctly spelled name as requested.
