# This is a factual research question. The steps to find the answer are:
# 1. Identify the organism: The genus "Perdita" is a large group of small bees native to North and Central America.
# 2. Research the common name: Searching entomological sources reveals the common name is "Fairy bees", owing to their tiny size and often metallic coloration.
# 3. Research the coining year: Pinpointing the exact moment a common name is coined is difficult. However, we can find its earliest known use in a major, widely-circulated publication. The "Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Insects and Spiders," published in 1980, refers to them as "fairy bees," indicating the name was in use by that time. It is the earliest prominent publication found to use this term.
# 4. Format the answer: The final answer is constructed based on this research.

common_name = "Fairy bees"
year_coined = 1980

# The problem requires the output to be in the format "<name>, <year>"
print(f"{common_name}, {year_coined}")

# Restore stdout and get the captured output
sys.stdout = old_stdout
output = captured_output.getvalue()

# Print the captured output to the actual console
print(output.strip())
