    # Step 1: Analyze the ligand
    # The ligand is 1,3-Di[3-(2’-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl]-2,4,6-triethylbenzene.
    # - "Di" means there are two identical arms.
    # - Each arm contains a "pyridyl" group (a pyridine ring) and a "pyrazolyl" group (a pyrazole ring).
    # - Pyridine has one nitrogen donor atom.
    # - Pyrazole has two nitrogen atoms, one of which is an effective donor.
    # - Therefore, each arm provides two nitrogen donor sites (N, N).
    # - With two arms, the ligand is tetradentate (four-toothed).
    ligand_donor_atoms = ["N", "N", "N", "N"]
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the metal salt
    # The salt is Zinc Bromide, ZnBr2.
    # It provides the central metal ion, Zn(II).
    # It also provides two bromide ions, Br-, which can act as ligands.
    salt_donor_atoms = ["Br", "Br"]
    
    # Step 3: Predict the coordination complex
    # The reaction is 1:1 between the ligand and ZnBr2.
    # Zn(II) is a d10 ion and commonly forms 4- or 6-coordinate complexes.
    # The tetradentate ligand will occupy 4 coordination sites due to the chelate effect.
    # To form a stable, neutral complex, the two bromide ions will likely coordinate as well.
    # This results in a 6-coordinate complex, which is very common for Zn(II).
    # The chemical formula of the complex would be [Zn(ligand)Br2].
    
    # Step 4: Determine the atoms coordinated to the Zn center
    # The coordination sphere is formed by the 4 nitrogen atoms from the ligand
    # and the 2 bromide atoms from the salt.
