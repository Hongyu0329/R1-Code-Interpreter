    # Historical Context
    # Blanche of Lancaster died in 1368 in England.
    # During this period, Geoffrey Chaucer was a member of the English royal court,
    # serving as an esquire to King Edward III.
    # His famous poem, "The Book of the Duchess," is an elegy for Blanche,
    # which strongly indicates he was in England and part of the court circle
    # when she passed away.
