I will establish Geoffrey Chaucer's location and occupation during that year.\n3.  Based on these facts, I will determine the correct answer choice.\n4.

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
