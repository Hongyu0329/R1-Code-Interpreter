    This function identifies the error in the provided C code and calculates the fix.

    The C code fails because it tries to read a full integer into a single character variable,
    leading to a buffer overflow on the stack.

    - C Code Line with Error: Line 5
      char c;

    - Reason: The scanf function is called with the format string "%d", which expects a pointer to
      an integer (int*). However, it is passed the address of 'c' (&c), which is a pointer
      to a character (char*). This type mismatch causes scanf to write sizeof(int) bytes (usually 4)
      into a memory location that is only sizeof(char) byte (1) long. This is undefined behavior.

    - The Fix: The variable 'c' should be declared as an 'int' to correctly store the numbers
      read from the input.
      Corrected Line 5: int c;

    - Edit Analysis: The error is on line 5. The fix involves changing one token ('char' to 'int').
      This is considered 1 edit operation.
