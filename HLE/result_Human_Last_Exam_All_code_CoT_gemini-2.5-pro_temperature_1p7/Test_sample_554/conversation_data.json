    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar\", we first need to understand the structure of the base \"nanocar\" molecule and the meaning of the chemical prefix \"perfluoro-\".\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Nanocar Molecule:** The \"nanocar\" is a real molecule developed for nanotechnology research. Its chemical formula is C138H98. The important part of this formula for our task is the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 98.\n2.  **Understand \"Perfluoro-\":** In organic chemistry, the prefix \"perfluoro-\" means that all hydrogen atoms on the parent molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Fluorine Atoms:** Since the original nanocar has 98 hydrogen atoms, a \"perfluoronanocar\" would have all 98 of these hydrogens replaced by 98 fluorine atoms.\n4.  **Python Script:** The Python code will define the number of hydrogen atoms in a nanocar and then use that value to state the number of fluorine atoms in its perfluorinated version, explaining the logic.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \n    This is based on the chemical formula of the known nanocar molecule (C138H98)\n    and the definition of the \"perfluoro-\" prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The chemical formula for a nanocar is C138H98.\n    # We are interested in the number of hydrogen atoms.\n    num_hydrogen_in_nanocar = 98\n\n    # The prefix \"perfluoro-\" means every hydrogen (H) atom is replaced\n    # by a fluorine (F) atom. This is a one-to-one replacement.\n    num_fluorine_in_perfluoronanocar = num_hydrogen_in_nanocar\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The chemical formula for a standard nanocar is C138H98.\")\n    print(f\"   - Number of Hydrogen atoms in nanocar = {num_hydrogen_in_nanocar}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The prefix 'perfluoro-' signifies that all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\n    print(\"   - For every 1 Hydrogen atom, there will be 1 Fluorine atom.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\n    print(f\"The number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar is therefore equal to the original number of hydrogen atoms.\")\n    print(f\"Equation: Number of Fluorine Atoms = {num_fluorine_in_perfluoronanocar}\")\n    print(f\"\\nA perfluoronanocar would contain {num_fluorine_in_perfluoronanocar} fluorine atoms.\")\n\ncalculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms()\n```\n<<<98>>>"
