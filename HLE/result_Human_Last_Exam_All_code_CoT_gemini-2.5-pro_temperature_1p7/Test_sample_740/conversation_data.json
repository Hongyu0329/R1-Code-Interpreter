    "This problem asks for the values of `λ` for which the given integral equation has no solutions. This is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind with a separable (or degenerate) kernel.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Kernel**: First, I will simplify the kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. This is a known identity and can be expressed as a sum: `K(x, y) = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n\n2.  **Convert to a Linear System**: Substituting the simplified kernel into the integral equation reveals that the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. By representing `u(x)` in terms of its moments `c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy`, the integral equation can be transformed into a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown coefficients `c_j`. This system can be written in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where `I` is the identity matrix, `A` is an `n x n` matrix, and `b` is a known vector.\n\n3.  **Apply Fredholm's Alternative Theorem**: According to this theorem, the linear system `(I - λA)c = b` (and thus the original integral equation) has a unique solution if `det(I - λA) ≠ 0`. If `det(I - λA) = 0`, the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions. This determinant is zero when `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. Let's call these special values of `λ` characteristic values.\n\n4.  **Derive the Condition for No Solution**: For a characteristic value `λ_i = 1/μ_i` (where `μ_i` is an eigenvalue of `A`), the equation has no solution if the vector `b` is not orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator `(I - λ_i A)ᵀ`. This null space is spanned by the eigenvectors of `Aᵀ`. A careful analysis shows that this condition simplifies to checking whether a specific component of the eigenvector `d` of `Aᵀ` is non-zero. The condition for no solution turns out to be `d_{n-1} ≠ 0`.\n\n5.  **Implement a Numerical Solution**: I will write a Python script that implements this logic for a given integer `n`. The script will:\n    *   Construct the matrix `A`.\n    *   Compute the eigenvalues of `A` and the eigenvectors of `Aᵀ`.\n    *   For each eigenvalue `μ_i`, check if the last component of the corresponding eigenvector `d_i` is non-zero.\n    *   If the condition holds, the value `λ_i = 1/μ_i` is a value for which no solution exists.\n\nBased on analysis for small `n` (like `n=1, 2`), it appears that the condition `d_{n-1} ≠ 0` holds for all eigenvectors. Thus, the equation has no solutions for all characteristic values `λ = 1/μ`. The code will verify this for a chosen `n`.\n\nHere is the Python code to find these values of `λ`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the values of lambda for which the integral equation has no solution\n    for a given integer n >= 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 1: Define the matrix A based on the discretized integral equation.\n    # The elements are A[j, k] = 1 / (j + n - k) for 0-indexed j and k.\n    A = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=float)\n    for j in range(n):\n        for k in range(n):\n            # Using 1-based indexing for clarity in the formula, then convert to 0-based.\n            # j_one, k_one = j + 1, k + 1\n            # Denominator: (j+1) + n - (k+1) -> j + n - k, which is correct for 0-based.\n            A[j, k] = 1.0 / (j + n - k)\n\n    # Step 2: Find eigenvalues of A and eigenvectors of A^T.\n    # The characteristic values of lambda are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of A.\n    # No solution exists if the solvability condition is not met.
