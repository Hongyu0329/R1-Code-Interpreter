    # A Gödel number G(φ) for any formula φ is created by encoding its constituent symbols
    # (like '∀', '∃', '(', ')', '+', '=', variables, etc.) and their sequence.
    # Standard constructions (e.g., using prime factorization) result in very large numbers
    # for any syntactically correct formula. A statement complex enough to be a
    # "true Π₁ statement about prime twins" would be composed of many symbols,
    # leading to an astronomically large Gödel number under any reasonable G.
    #
    # The smallest Gödel numbers are typically not assigned to well-formed formulas at all,
    # or at best, to the most basic symbols in isolation.
    #
    # Therefore, no Gödel number corresponding to a complete, meaningful statement
    # could possibly fall within the tiny range [1, 5].
