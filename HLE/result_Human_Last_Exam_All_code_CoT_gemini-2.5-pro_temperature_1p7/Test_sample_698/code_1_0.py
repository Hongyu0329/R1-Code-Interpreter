    Analyzes the Word Avalanche problem to find the correct answer.

    A True Avalanche requires repeating a syllable pattern. The description is:
    "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."
    The key word is "computer".

    We analyze the choices:
    A. Computers comp few urns - No clear syllable repetition.
    B. Computer: "Come poo, tern!" - Syllables in "Computer" (com-pu-ter) are phonetically repeated in "Come poo, tern!" (come-poo-tern). The meaning fits the description: a computer tells a tern (a bird) to poo.
    C. Computer: "Come, pee you turkey!" - The syllables in "computer" do not match "come, pee you turkey".
    D. Comb pewter computer - This is a true avalanche ("comb-pew-ter" repeats as "com-pu-ter"), but the meaning ("searching through pewter alloy items") does not match the description.
    E. Computer needs bird relieves - No syllable repetition.

    Choice B is the only one that is both a true avalanche and fits the description.
