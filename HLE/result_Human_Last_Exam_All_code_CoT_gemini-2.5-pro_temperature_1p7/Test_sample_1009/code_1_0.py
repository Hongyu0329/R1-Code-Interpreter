# We are asked to find the largest possible weight of a topological group G with certain properties.
# The properties are:
# 1. G is compact.
# 2. G is first-countable.
# 3. |G| = 2^(2^c), where c is the cardinality of the continuum (2^aleph_0).
# 4. G might not be Hausdorff.

# Let's denote the weight as w(G), cardinality as |G|, and character as chi(G).
# We are given chi(G) <= aleph_0 (first-countable).
# We are given |G| = 2^(2^c).

# A general theorem for any topological group states that its weight is at most its cardinality.
# w(G) <= |G|
# This gives an upper bound on the weight:
# w(G) <= 2^(2^c)

# The question is about the *largest possible* weight. This suggests we should check if this
# upper bound is attainable.
# It is a known result in the theory of topological groups that for any infinite
# cardinal k, there exists a compact, first-countable (non-Hausdorff) topological
# group G such that |G| = k and w(G) = k.

# This means it is possible to construct a group that satisfies the conditions of the problem
# and has its weight equal to its cardinality.

# Therefore, the largest possible weight is the cardinality of the group itself.

# In set theory notation, c is Fraktur c.
# So, the cardinality of the group is 2^(2^Fraktur c).
# The largest possible weight is also 2^(2^Fraktur c).

print("For any topological group, its weight w(G) is bounded by its cardinality:")
print("w(G) <= |G|")
print("This gives an upper bound: w(G) <= 2^(2^c)")
print("It is a known result that this upper bound is sharp. There exist compact, first-countable topological groups G for which w(G) = |G|.")
print("Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is its cardinality.")
print("Final Answer: 2^(2^c)")
