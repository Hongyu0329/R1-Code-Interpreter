No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial due to the Parker spiral structure of the interplanetary magnetic field. A radial-based coordinate system is often used for data analysis as a matter of convenience and standardization because the solar wind *flow* is nearly radial. This provides a stable reference frame. However, for a physically accurate calculation of wave properties like helicity, the magnetic field data should be rotated into a local Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system, where the true directions perpendicular to the average magnetic field are used.
