    "This is a classic question in point-set topology. The solution relies on understanding the definitions of an indecomposable continuum and its composants, and a key theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first define the terms \"indecomposable continuum\" and \"composant\" to establish the context.\n2.  I will then state Mazurkiewicz's Theorem, which directly addresses the number of composants in such a space.\n3.  Based on the theorem, I will conclude the smallest possible number of composants.\n4.  Since the question requires a Python script, I will present this explanation and the final answer using `print` statements within a Python code block. The answer is a mathematical concept (a cardinality), not a result of a numerical calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to the question about the smallest\n    number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"To find the smallest number of 'composants' an 'indecomposable continuum' can have, we turn to a key result in topology.\")\n    print(\"\\nFirst, let's clarify the terms:\")\n    print(\" - An indecomposable continuum is a compact, connected space that cannot be broken down into the union of two smaller, proper subcontinua.\")\n    print(\" - A composant is a specific type of maximal subset within an indecomposable continuum.
