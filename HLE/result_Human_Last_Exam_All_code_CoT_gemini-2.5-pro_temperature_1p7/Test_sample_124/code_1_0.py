    Analyzes statements about probabilistic graphical models and identifies the correct ones.
    
    A: False. Approximate inference can be more efficient.
    B: False. The algorithm is sensitive to, not resilient to, high treewidth.
    C: True. The nodes of the junction tree are cliques, and the algorithm uses potentials representing joint distributions over them.
    D: False. The premise is false.
    E: True. High treewidth makes the algorithm's memory and time requirements impractical.
    F: False. Identical to D.
    G: True. The need to handle joint distributions over large cliques is precisely why high treewidth is a problem.
    H: False. The relationship is exponential, not linear.
    I: True. The cost is exponential in the largest clique size, so efficiency diminishes exponentially.
    J: False. Efficiency is highly dependent on clique size.
    L: False. This is a consequence of the Running Intersection Property, but not its most precise definition, as it doesn't cover all cases.
