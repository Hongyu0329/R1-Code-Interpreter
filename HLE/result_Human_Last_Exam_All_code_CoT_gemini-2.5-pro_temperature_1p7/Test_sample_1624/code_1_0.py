    print("We are given the following premises:")
    print("  1. X is a connected metric space.")
    print("  2. U is a dense open subset of X.")
    print("  3. Each point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the real line, R.")
    
    print("\n--- Step 1: Analyze the properties of the subset U ---")
    print("The real line R is a separable space (e.g., the set of rational numbers Q is a countable dense subset).")
    print("Premise 3 states that every point in U has a neighborhood that is separable. This means U is a 'locally separable' space.")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Prove that U is a separable space ---")
    print("U is an open subset of the metric space X, so U itself is a metric space.")
    print("A theorem in topology states that a locally separable metric space is also separable.")
    print("Therefore, U is a separable space, which means it contains a countable dense subset. Let's call this subset D.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: Prove that X is also a separable space ---")
    print("We know D is a countable set and is dense in U. We will show that D is also dense in X.")
    print("  - Let x be any point in X and let N be any open neighborhood of x.")
    print("  - Because U is dense in X (Premise 2), the intersection N ∩ U is a non-empty open set.")
    print("  - Because D is dense in U, this open set must contain a point from D. So, (N ∩ U) ∩ D is non-empty.")
    print("  - This implies that N ∩ D is non-empty.")
    print("Since for any point x in X, any neighborhood of x intersects D, D is a dense subset of X.")
    print("Since D is countable, we have proved that X is a separable metric space.")

    print("\n--- Step 4: Determine the cardinality of a separable metric space ---")
    print("A fundamental result states that any separable metric space has a cardinality of at most 'c', the cardinality of the continuum.")
    print("This is because a separable metric space is second-countable (has a countable basis for its topology).")
    print("For any second-countable Hausdorff space (which a metric space is), its cardinality |X| is less than or equal to the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers, |P(N)|.")
    
    print("\n--- Numbers and Equation in the Final Argument ---")
    print("The final conclusion on cardinality rests on the following inequality:")
    print("  |X| ≤ 2^ℵ₀")
    print("In this expression:")
    print("  - The number '2' is the base of the exponentiation.")
    print("  - The symbol 'ℵ₀' (aleph-null) represents the cardinality of a countably infinite set (like the natural numbers).")
    print("  - The expression 2^ℵ₀ is the cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by 'c'.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of X. This upper bound is c = 2^ℵ₀.")
    print("This bound is achievable, for example, if X is the real line R itself.")
