    "My plan is to provide a Python script that prints the logical proof for the existence of an upper bound on the cardinality of X. The proof proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze U's properties:** The condition on `U` (every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to `R`) means that `U` is \"locally separable\", since `R` itself is a separable space.\n2.  **Separability of U:** For metric spaces, a key theorem states that being locally separable implies being separable. Since `U` is an open subset of the metric space `X`, `U` is itself a metric space. Therefore, `U` must be a separable space, which means it contains a countable dense subset.\n3.  **Separability of X:** I will then show that if a dense subset `U` of a space `X` is separable, then `X` itself must also be separable. A countable dense subset of `U` is also a countable dense subset of `X`.\n4.  **Cardinality of Separable Metric Spaces:** A fundamental result in topology is that any separable metric space (which `X` now is) has a cardinality no greater than `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (`c = 2^ℵ₀`). This is because separable metric spaces are second-countable.\n5.  **Conclusion:** This establishes that `c` is an upper bound on the cardinality of `X`. The script will print these steps and conclude with the final answer. To satisfy the prompt's requirement of including numbers, the script will also explicitly mention the numbers and symbols in the final cardinality inequality, `|X| ≤ 2^ℵ₀`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the properties of a metric space X to determine if its cardinality has an upper bound\n    by printing a step-by-step logical deduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step reasoning for the upper bound on the cardinality of X:\")\n    print(\"===================================================================\")\n    print(\"We are given the following premises:\")\n    print(\"  1.
