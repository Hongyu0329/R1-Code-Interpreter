    "My plan is to analyze the provided multiple-choice question about the 1972 film *Solaris*. I will create a Python script that stores information about each character listed in the options. The script will then iterate through this information to identify which character expressed shame about missing the sound of rustling leaves. Finally, the script will print a detailed explanation of the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes character details from the 1972 movie Solaris to answer a specific question.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"In the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie Solaris which character is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth?\"\n    \n    # Data structure containing information about the characters relevant to the question.\n    characters = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Kris Kelvin',\n            'description': 'The protagonist who travels from a lush, natural Earth to the sterile Solaris station.
