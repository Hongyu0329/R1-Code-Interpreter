    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integrand**: The expression to integrate is `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This is a standard integral form.\n2.  **Apply Integration Rule**: The integral of `u'(x)/u(x)` with respect to `x` is `ln|u(x)| + C`. In our case, `u(x) = F₃(x)`. So, the indefinite integral is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n3.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: We need to evaluate the integral from 0 to 1. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the value `V` is:\n    `V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1\n    `V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n4.  **Calculate `F₃(0)`**:\n    *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e^0 = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n5.  **Calculate `F₃(1)`**:\n    *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)`\n    *   `F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n6.  **Calculate Final Value**:\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` into the equation for `V`.\n    *   `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n    *   Since both `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` are positive, the absolute value is not needed.\n7.  **Compute Numerically**: Use Python to calculate the numerical value of `V` and then compute `10000 * V`, rounding the result to the nearest integer. The code will print out the intermediate values as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef F0(x):\n    \"\"\"Calculates F0(x) = x\"\"\"\n    return x\n\ndef F1(x):\n    \"\"\"Calculates F1(x) = sin(F0(x))\"\"\"\n    return math.sin(F0(x))\n\ndef F2(x):\n    \"\"\"Calculates F2(x) = e^(F1(x))\"\"\"\n    return math.exp(F1(x))\n\ndef F3(x):\n    \"\"\"Calculates F3(x) = ln(1 + F2(x))\"\"\"\n    return math.log(1 + F2(x))\n\n# The integral of F3'(x)/F3(x) dx from 0 to 1 is V = ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0)).\n# We need to find the values for the final equation.\n\n# Calculate F3(0) and F3(1)\nf3_at_0 = F3(0)\nf3_at_1 = F3(1)\n\n# The final equation is V = ln(f3_at_1) - ln(f3_at_0)\n# We print each number in this final equation.\nprint(\"The definite integral V is calculated using the equation: ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\")\nprint(f\"Value of F3(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))): {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"Value of F3(0) = ln(2): {f3_at_0}\")\n\n# Calculate the value of the integral, V\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\nprint(f\"The value of the integral V is: {V}\")\n\n# Calculate 10000 * V\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nprint(f\"The value of 10000 * V is: {final_value}\")\n\n# Find the closest integer\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\nprint(f\"The final answer (closest integer to 10000 * V) is: {closest_integer}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<{}>>>\".format(closest_integer))\n```"
