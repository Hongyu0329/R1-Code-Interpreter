    "To answer your question, I will first identify the specific paper you're referring to, which is one of Albert Einstein's 1905 \"Annus Mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers. Then, I will research the citations within that paper to find a specific reference to someone's lectures. Finally, I will write a simple Python script to print out the name of the person whose lectures were cited.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# In his 1905 paper \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung\n# von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles\n# Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat),\n# Albert Einstein builds upon the principles of the kinetic theory of heat.\n\n# In section 4 of the paper, he explicitly cites a specific work.\ncited_scientist = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\ncited_work = \"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"\nenglish_translation = \"Lectures on Gas Theory\"\n\n# The script will now print the answer clearly.\nprint(f\"In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of: {cited_scientist}\")\nprint(f\"The specific work mentioned was '{cited_work}' ({english_translation}).\")\n\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
