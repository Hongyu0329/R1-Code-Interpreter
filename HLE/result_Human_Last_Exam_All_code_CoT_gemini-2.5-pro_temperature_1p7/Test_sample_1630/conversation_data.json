    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the question.** We are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of a composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n2.  **Determine the nature of the function.** $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both cubic polynomials. The composition $h(x)=f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n3.  **Set up the equation.** The fixed points are the roots of the equation $f(g(x)) = x$, which can be rewritten as $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n4.  **Find the theoretical maximum.** Since $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, it can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n5.  **Check if the maximum is achievable.** The main constraint is that the derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, must be positive for all real numbers $x$. This means both $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions. Their composition $h(x)$ is therefore also strictly increasing. An increasing function can intersect the line $y=x$ multiple times if it \"wiggles\" enough (i.e., its derivative oscillates around 1).\n6.  **Construct an example.** To show that 9 fixed points are possible, we need to find an example pair of polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the conditions and for which $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ has 9 distinct real roots. Proving that such polynomials exist is complex, but it is a known mathematical result. For this task, I will use Python to construct specific polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the positive derivative conditions. By carefully choosing the coefficients to make the derivatives get close to zero but not touch it, we can induce the necessary \"wiggles\" in the composite function.\n7.  **Write the Python code.** The code will:\n    *   Define the coefficients for $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ based on my construction.\n    *   Verify that these polynomials meet the $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ criteria.\n    *   Use the `numpy` library to represent the polynomials and find the roots of $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n    *   Print the coefficients of the resulting degree-9 polynomial equation.\n    *   Print the number of real roots found. This demonstrates that a large number of fixed points is possible, supporting the theoretical maximum of 9.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.polynomial import Polynomial\n\ndef solve_fixed_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs two cubic polynomials f(x) and g(x) with f'(x)>0 and g'(x)>0,\n    then finds the number of fixed points for the composite function f(g(x)).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let's define the derivatives first to ensure they are always positive.\n    # Let's choose g'(x) to be a parabola with a minimum value > 0.\n    # For instance, g'(x) = A*((x-x0)^2 + eps).
