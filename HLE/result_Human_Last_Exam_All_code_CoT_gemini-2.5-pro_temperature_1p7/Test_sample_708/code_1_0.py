    passage = "Experience will be a decisive factor in this battle. The ships will outmaneuver the enemy fleet because the old man the boats."

    # Explanation of the linguistic analysis:
    # The critical phrase is "...the old man the boats."
    # The word "man" is ambiguous. It can be a noun (part of the Noun Phrase "the old man")
    # or a verb ("to man the boats").
    # A garden path occurs if the reader assumes "man" is a noun, as the following word "the"
    # makes that interpretation ungrammatical.
    # The question specifies that this garden path is successfully avoided. This means the
    # reader correctly interprets "man" as a verb. However, the conflict between the
    # highly frequent noun interpretation and the less frequent verb interpretation still
    # causes processing difficulty. This difficulty leads to elevated reading time on the
    # ambiguous word itself.
    # Our goal is to find the ordinal position of this ambiguous word, "man".

    # Step 1: Prepare the passage for word counting by removing punctuation and splitting it.
    # We replace the period with a space to separate words correctly.
    processed_passage = passage.replace('.', ' ').replace(',', ' ')
    word_list = processed_passage.split()

    # Step 2: Find the 1-based position of the critical word "man".
    critical_word = "man"
    # The `index()` method returns the 0-based index. We add 1 for the ordinal position.
    try:
        position_number = word_list.index(critical_word) + 1
    except ValueError:
        print(f"Error: The critical word '{critical_word}' was not found in the passage.")
        return

    # Step 3: Convert the numerical position to its word form as requested.
    # For the number 20, the ordinal word is "twentieth".
    position_word = "twentieth"

    print(f"The full passage is: \"{passage}\"")
    print(f"The list of words has a total of {len(word_list)} words.")
    print(f"The ambiguous word causing processing difficulty is '{critical_word}'.")
    print(f"The numerical position of '{critical_word}' is: {position_number}")
    print(f"Therefore, the ordinal word position is '{position_word}'.")
