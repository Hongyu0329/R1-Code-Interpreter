def find_possible_n_values():
    """
    Finds and prints the values of n for which it is possible to
    reach a state with a single gift in the hypercube puzzle.

    The condition for possibility in an n x n x n x n x n hypercube with 7-position
    flips is that n modulo 7 must be either 1 or 6. This is derived from a
    linear algebra analysis over the finite field F_2.

    The script iterates through n from 7 to 55 and prints the values
    that satisfy this condition, along with the corresponding equation.
