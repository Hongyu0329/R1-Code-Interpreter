    "Answering this question requires knowledge of ballet pedagogy rather than computational processing. The core differences lie in the foundational principles of each ballet method. I will use a Python script to lay out the analysis of each option and determine the most accurate answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the options provided in the multiple-choice question.\n2.  Analyze each option based on the known principles of the Vaganova and Balanchine methods for a *cambré derrière* (back bend).\n    *   **Vaganova Method:** Emphasizes strict alignment, core strength, and keeping the hips square to the front to create a stable base for a deep, controlled upper back bend.\n    *   **Balanchine Method:** Often prioritizes dynamic shapes, speed, and creating long lines, which can involve \"breaking\" the academic line. In a cambré derrière, this often manifests as allowing the hip of the working leg to lift and open slightly to achieve a more expansive and dramatic backbend.\n3.  Based on this analysis, the script will identify the most significant and defining difference from the given choices.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the explanation and the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and\n    Balanchine methods to select the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the options for the difference in cambré derrière between Vaganova and Balanchine methods:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Analysis of each option\n    print(\"Option A (Arm placement): While arm styling can differ, it's not the most fundamental technical distinction. Both methods can utilize various arm positions.\")\n    print(\"Option C (Speed): Balanchine's style is generally faster, but speed is a quality of performance, not a core positional difference. A Balanchine cambré can be done slowly.\")\n    print(\"Option D (Degree of backbend): Dancers in both methods can achieve very deep backbends. The degree is more dependent on individual flexibility than a prescribed technical difference.\")\n    print(\"Option E (Placement of head): Head placement is an important part of épaulement in both, but it follows from the mechanics of the torso and hips.

The stability of the pelvis is paramount, and the bend comes purely from the spine, primarily the upper back.\")\n    print(\"  - Balanchine Method: Often encourages allowing the hip of the gesturing leg to lift and rotate slightly.
