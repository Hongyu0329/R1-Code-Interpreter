    print("Option A (Arm placement): While arm styling can differ, it's not the most fundamental technical distinction. Both methods can utilize various arm positions.")
    print("Option C (Speed): Balanchine's style is generally faster, but speed is a quality of performance, not a core positional difference. A Balanchine cambré can be done slowly.")
    print("Option D (Degree of backbend): Dancers in both methods can achieve very deep backbends. The degree is more dependent on individual flexibility than a prescribed technical difference.")
    print("Option E (Placement of head): Head placement is an important part of épaulement in both, but it follows from the mechanics of the torso and hips. It's a resulting difference, not the primary cause.")

    print("Option B (Placement of hip): This is the key structural difference.")
    print("  - Vaganova Method: Insists on maintaining two square hips facing forward. The stability of the pelvis is paramount, and the bend comes purely from the spine, primarily the upper back.")
    print("  - Balanchine Method: Often encourages allowing the hip of the gesturing leg to lift and rotate slightly. This 'breaks' the strict frontal alignment to create a more dynamic, visually striking line and can allow for a different quality of backbend.")
