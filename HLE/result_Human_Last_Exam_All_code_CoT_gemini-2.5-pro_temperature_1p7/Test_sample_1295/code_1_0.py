    """
    This function solves the chemical puzzle by constructing a molecule that fits the given constraints
    and prints its SMILES representation.

    The constraints are:
    - Total valence electrons: 80
    - Formal charge: 0
    - Molecular weight: 198.159 g/mol
    - Heavy atoms: 14
    - Heteroatoms: 6 (all Nitrogen)
    - Total NH or OH groups: 6 (interpreted as N-H bonds after analysis, but constraints are contradictory)
    - Hydrogen bond acceptors: 4
    - Hydrogen bond donors: 4 (implying 4 N-H bonds)
    - Amine types: 2 tertiary, 2 secondary, 2 primary
    - Functional groups: 2 amidine groups, 1 azo group
    - Structure: No rings
    - Rotatable bonds: 4
    """

    # Step 1: Determine Molecular Formula
    # C = 8, N = 6 from heavy/heteroatom counts.
    # Valence electrons: 8*4 (C) + 6*5 (N) + x*1 (H) = 80 => 32 + 30 + x = 80 => x = 18.
    # Formula is C8H18N6.
    # MW Check (monoisotopic): 8*12.00000 + 18*1.007825 + 6*14.003074 = 198.159294. Matches.
    
    # Step 2: Assemble the molecule.
    # The combination of constraints (especially amine types vs functional groups, H-bond acceptors, and rotatable bonds)
    # is highly contradictory under standard chemical definitions.
    # The following structure is a reasoned compromise that satisfies the most critical constraints:
    # - Molecular Formula (C8H18N6)
    # - Acyclic structure
    # - Presence of 1 azo and 2 amidine groups
    # - 4 H-bond donors (4 N-H bonds)
    # - 2 primary, 2 secondary, 2 tertiary N atoms (Requires interpreting azo nitrogens as "tertiary" for this puzzle's context).
    #
    # The structure is: N,N'-bis(1-imino-1-(isopropylamino)methyl)diazene
    # Or, systematically: (1Z,1'Z)-1,1'-(diazene-1,2-diyl)bis(N-isopropylmethanimidamide)
    
    # SMILES representation of the proposed molecule: CC(C)NC(=N)N=NC(=N)NC(C)C
    # Let's break down this SMILES string:
    # CC(C)      : An isopropyl group, CH(CH3)2
    # N           : The secondary amine nitrogen, -NH-
    # C(=N)       : The amidine group, with one N being a primary imine (=NH)
    # N=N         : The central azo group
    # C(=N)       : The second amidine group
    # NC(C)C      : The second isopropyl-amine group
    
    smiles_representation = "CC(C)NC(=N)N=NC(=N)NC(C)C"
    
    # The prompt requests outputting the numbers from the final equation. As there is no equation,
    # the key numerical constraints are printed here for context.
