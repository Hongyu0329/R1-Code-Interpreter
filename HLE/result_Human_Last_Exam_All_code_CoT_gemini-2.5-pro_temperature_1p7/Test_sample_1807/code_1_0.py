    The question asks for a potential explanation for high genetic differentiation (Fst) at some markers between males and females of the same population.

    The most direct explanation is the presence of sex chromosomes, which differ between males and females.

    1.  In XY systems (e.g., mammals), males are XY and females are XX.
        - Markers on the Y chromosome are exclusive to males.
        - Markers on the X chromosome have different copy numbers (1 in males, 2 in females).
        These differences create large allele frequency discrepancies for markers on sex chromosomes, resulting in high Fst values.

    2.  In ZW systems (e.g., birds), females are ZW and males are ZZ.
        - Markers on the W chromosome are exclusive to females, leading to high Fst.

    Other options like reproductive isolation, local adaptation, or hybrid zones typically explain differentiation between separate populations, not between the sexes within a single interbreeding population.
