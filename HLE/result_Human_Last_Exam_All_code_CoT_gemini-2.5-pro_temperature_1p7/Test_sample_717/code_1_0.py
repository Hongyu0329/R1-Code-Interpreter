# Plan:
# The problem asks for the value of n, where a "tame functor F" is "n-resolvable".
# Based on standard interpretations in representation theory:
# 1. A "tame functor" F refers to an indecomposable regular representation in a tame category.
# 2. "n-resolvable" refers to the projective dimension of F being n.
# 3. The other conditions on the functor f are assumed to establish a "nice" setting, specifically a tame hereditary category.
# In a tame hereditary algebra, indecomposable regular modules have a projective dimension of exactly 1.
# Therefore, n must be 1.

# The final equation is n = 1.
# The code will output the numbers in this equation as requested.

def solve_for_n():
  """
  Calculates the value of n based on the properties of the functor F.

  # As requested, printing the number from the final equation 'n = 1'.
