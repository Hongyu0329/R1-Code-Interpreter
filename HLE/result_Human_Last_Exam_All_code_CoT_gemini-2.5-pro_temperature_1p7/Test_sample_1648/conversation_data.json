    "My approach to solving this problem involves analyzing the structure of the algebraic K-groups of the ring `Z/27`. I will handle the case for the second K-group (`n=1`) separately from the higher even K-groups (`n >= 2`), as the K-theory for low dimensions has specific results that need to be considered.\n\n1.  **Analyze `K_2(Z/27)` (the case `n=1`):** I will consult established computational results for the second K-group of rings of the form `Z/m`.\n2.  **Analyze `K_{2n}(Z/27)` for `n >= 2`:** For the higher even K-groups, I will use general structural theorems from algebraic K-theory. This involves breaking down the group into its primary components and analyzing each one.\n    *   The `3`-primary component will be analyzed using results from Hesselholt and Madsen on the `p`-adic K-theory of `Z/p^k`.\n    *   The `l`-primary components for primes `l != 3` will be analyzed using Gabber's rigidity theorem, which relates the K-theory of `Z/p^k` to that of the field `Z/p`.\n    *   The K-groups of the finite field `Z/3` are known from Quillen's work.\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** I will combine these results to determine the set of all natural numbers `n` for which `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is non-zero. The largest number in this set will be the answer.\n\nThis plan will reveal that only for `n=1` is the group non-zero, making `1` the largest such natural number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_k_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest natural number n such that the (2n)-th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero.\n    This function explains the steps based on known results in algebraic K-theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    p = 3\n    k = 3\n    m = p**k\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the largest natural number n such that the group K_{{2*n}}(Z/{m}) is non-zero.\")\n    print(\"We analyze the group for different n.\")\n    \n    # Case n = 1\n    n_case_1 = 1\n    print(f\"\\n--- Case n = {n_case_1} ---\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n_case_1}, we examine the group K_{{2*n_case_1}}(Z/{m}), which is K_2(Z/{m}).\")\n    print(\"There are specific computational results for the second K-group.\")\n    print(f\"For an odd prime p, it is a known result (from works of Dennis, Stein, Loday, and Zha) that K_2(Z/p^k) is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2.\")\n    print(f\"Our ring is Z/{m} = Z/({p}^{k}), with p={p} being an odd prime.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, K_2(Z/27) = Z/2.\")\n    print(\"The group Z/2 is non-zero.
