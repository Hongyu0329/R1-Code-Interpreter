    print("1. The BOOP machine's capabilities depend on its instruction set and memory model.")
    print("2. The definition of a 'boopable' function allows the machine resources (R, A, W) to be arbitrarily large for any computation. This gives the machine access to what is effectively unbounded memory.")
    print("3. The program itself resides in memory that the CPU can write to. This enables self-modifying code.")
    print("4. With self-modifying code, the machine can simulate complex instructions not present in its base instruction set, such as indirect addressing (e.g., loading from an address stored in a register).")
    print("5. A machine with arithmetic (ADD), universal logic (BITWISENAND), conditional branching (BRANCHIFZERO), and access to unbounded memory is a model of computation known as a Random Access Machine (RAM), which is Turing-equivalent.")
