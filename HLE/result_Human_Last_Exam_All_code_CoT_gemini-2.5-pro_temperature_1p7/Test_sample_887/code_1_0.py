    The problem asks about the reaction between a fluorine atom (F) and a methane molecule with one hydrogen and three deuterium atoms (CHD3).
    A key detail is that the C-H bond is selectively excited with an infrared laser, meaning vibrational energy is pumped specifically into that bond.
    There are two possible outcomes:
    1. H-abstraction: F + CHD3 -> HF + CD3
    2. D-abstraction: F + CHD3 -> DF + CHD2

    This scenario is a classic example of mode-specific chemistry. The central idea is that energy isn't always distributed randomly within a molecule before it reacts.
    By exciting a specific vibrational mode (the C-H stretch), we can directly influence the bond involved in the reaction.
    Adding energy to the C-H bond makes it vibrate with a larger amplitude, effectively 'pre-stretching' it and lowering the energy needed from the collision with fluorine to break it.

    Experimental studies have shown that exciting the C-H bond has a dramatic effect:
    - The rate of the H-abstraction reaction increases significantly.
    - The rate of the D-abstraction reaction remains largely unaffected.
    This means the overall reaction accelerates, and the outcome becomes highly selective, strongly favoring the cleavage of the excited C-H bond.

    A. 'Increases the reactivity... faster bond cleavage.' - This is true, but it doesn't mention the crucial effect on selectivity between H and D.
    B. 'Decreases the reactivity...' - Incorrect.
    C. '...react equally...' - Incorrect. The excitation is bond-specific and increases selectivity.
    D. 'accelerates the reaction by enhancing the likelihood of H atom removal over D atoms.' - This is the most complete and accurate description. It correctly states that the reaction speeds up and that the selectivity for H vs. D removal is enhanced.
    E. 'has no effect...' - Incorrect. Experiments show a strong effect.
