    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  First, I'll determine the total number of squares on the edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n2.  Next, I'll calculate the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these edge squares without any of them attacking each other. To do this, I will consider that bishops on white squares do not attack bishops on dark squares, so I can analyze the two colors separately.\n3.  For each color, I will determine the maximum number of bishops that can be placed. This is limited by the fact that no two bishops can share a diagonal.\n4.  Finally, I will subtract the total number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares to find out how many squares are left empty.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of edge squares lacking bishops when the maximum number\n    of non-attacking bishops are placed on the edge of an 8x8 chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define board size and calculate total edge squares.\n    board_size = 8\n    total_squares = board_size * board_size\n    inner_squares = (board_size - 2) * (board_size - 2)\n    edge_squares = total_squares - inner_squares\n\n    print(f\"A standard {board_size}x{board_size} chessboard has {edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n    print(\"These edge squares are composed of 14 light-colored squares and 14 dark-colored squares.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of bishops that can be placed.\n    # Bishops on light squares don't attack bishops on dark squares.\n    # The 14 squares of each color form 7 pairs that lie on the same diagonals.\n    # Therefore, we can only place one bishop for each of these 7 diagonals for each color.\n    max_bishops_per_color = 7\n    total_bishops = max_bishops_per_color * 2\n\n    print(f\"On the 14 light squares, a maximum of {max_bishops_per_color} non-attacking bishops can be placed.\")\n    print(f\"On the 14 dark squares, a maximum of {max_bishops_per_color} non-attacking bishops can be placed.\")\n    print(f\"The total number of bishops placed on the edge is {max_bishops_per_color} + {max_bishops_per_color} = {total_bishops}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the number of empty squares.\n    lacking_bishops = edge_squares - total_bishops\n\n    print(\"The number of edge squares that would lack bishops is calculated as follows:\")\n    # The final print statement shows the equation with the actual numbers.\n    print(f\"{edge_squares} (total edge squares) - {total_bishops} (placed bishops) = {lacking_bishops}\")\n\nsolve_bishops_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
