    "My plan is to use a Python script to solve this problem. I will first create a data structure, specifically a dictionary, to hold the information about each ballet school and its known training style, particularly concerning pointe work at the barre. The script will then iterate through this data to find the school most strongly associated with the practice of extensive barre work on pointe. Finally, it will print out the reasoning and identify the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_ballet_school_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes information about ballet schools to answer a specific question\n    about their training methods.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The question is: Which of the following ballet schools are female dancers\n    # known to train on the barre with mostly pointe shoes?\n\n    # We will store known facts about each school's training methodology\n    # in a dictionary.\n    schools_info = {\n        \"A\": {\n            \"name\": \"La Scala\",\n            \"methodology\": \"Associated with the Italian Cecchetti method, which is known for its systematic and gradual approach to building strength for pointe work.\"\n        },\n        \"B\": {\n            \"name\": \"Vaganova\",\n            \"methodology\": \"The Vaganova method is highly structured.
