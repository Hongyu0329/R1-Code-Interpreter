    This function analyzes the provided medical case to determine the best next diagnostic step.

    The case details a 43-year-old man with a rash consistent with allergic contact dermatitis from clothing.
    The question asks for the best next step in diagnosis. Let's review the options:

    A. Skin biopsy: This is an invasive procedure, usually reserved for when the diagnosis is uncertain or to rule out more serious conditions. It's not the initial test for suspected contact dermatitis.
    B. KOH preparation: This test is used to identify fungal infections. While possible in skin folds, the primary suspicion here is allergic, based on the history and rash pattern.
    C. Topical steroid: This is a form of treatment, not a diagnostic test. While a response to steroids would support an inflammatory cause, it doesn't identify the specific allergen.
    D. Patch test: This is the gold standard for diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis. It helps identify the specific substance (allergen) causing the type IV hypersensitivity reaction. The case text itself states this was done to confirm the diagnosis.
    E. None of the above.

    Conclusion: The patch test is the correct diagnostic tool to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative agent.
