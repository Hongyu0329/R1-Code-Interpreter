    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the sequence:** We will examine the relationship between each number and the one following it to find a consistent pattern.\n2.  **Identify the primary pattern:** We'll test for common patterns like addition, multiplication, or a combination. The pattern seems to be `Next Number = 2 * Current Number + Added Number`, which we will verify.\n3.  **Identify the secondary pattern:** The \"Added Number\" itself forms a new sequence. We will analyze this new sequence to find its underlying rule.\n4.  **Calculate the next \"Added Number\":** Using the rule found in step 3, we will determine the next number in the sequence of added numbers.\n5.  **Calculate the final answer:** We will use the primary pattern from step 2 and the next \"Added Number\" from step 4 to calculate the missing term in the original sequence.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes the plan:\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by identifying a multi-layered pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"Original sequence: {', '.join(map(str, sequence))}, ...\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify the primary pattern (applies from the 2nd term onwards)\n    print(\"Let's analyze the relationship between the numbers, starting from the second term (11):\")\n    # x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + C_n\n    # C_n = x_n - 2 * x_{n-1}\n    added_numbers = []\n    \n    # Calculate the added numbers for the pattern: Next = 2 * Current + C\n    for i in range(2, len(sequence)):\n        current_term = sequence[i]\n        previous_term = sequence[i-1]\n        added_number = current_term - 2 * previous_term\n        added_numbers.append(added_number)\n        print(f\"{previous_term} * 2 + {added_number} = {current_term}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe sequence of 'Added Numbers' is: {', '.join(map(str, added_numbers))}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Identify the secondary pattern in the added_numbers sequence\n    print(\"Now, let's find the pattern in this new sequence of added numbers:\")\n    differences = []\n    for i in range(1, len(added_numbers)):\n        diff = added_numbers[i] - added_numbers[i-1]\n        differences.append(diff)\n        print(f\"{added_numbers[i]} - {added_numbers[i-1]} = {diff}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe differences are increasing by a factor of 3.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the next 'Added Number'\n    next_difference = differences[-1] * 3\n    print(f\"The next difference will be: {differences[-1]} * 3 = {next_difference}\")\n    \n    next_added_number = added_numbers[-1] + next_difference\n    print(f\"So, the next 'Added Number' in the sequence will be: {added_numbers[-1]} + {next_difference} = {next_added_number}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Calculate the final answer\n    last_term = sequence[-1]\n    final_answer = 2 * last_term + next_added_number\n\n    print(\"Finally, we apply the main rule to find the missing number in the sequence:\")\n    print(f\"2 * {last_term} + {next_added_number} = {final_answer}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n<<<A>>>"
