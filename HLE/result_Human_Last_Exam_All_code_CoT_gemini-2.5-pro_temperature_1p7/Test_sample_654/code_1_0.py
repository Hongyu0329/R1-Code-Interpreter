  Computes the number of coefficients in the polynomial that are not divisible by p^k.
  
  Let F(P) be the function that takes a polynomial P(x) and returns product_{i=1 to p^k} (P(x)-i).
  We start with P_0(x) = x and compute P_{p^n}(x) = F(F(...F(x)...)), iterated p^n times.
  
  The logic is as follows:
  1. The behavior of the coefficients is analyzed modulo p.
  2. The function F, when applied to a polynomial P(x), becomes P(x)^{p^k} - P(x)^{p^(k-1)} (mod p).
  3. Iterating this function p^n times results in a polynomial with a very simple form modulo p,
     due to properties of binomial coefficients (Lucas's Theorem).
  4. The final polynomial modulo p is x^(p^(k*p^n)) - x^(p^((k-1)*p^n)).
  5. This means the final polynomial has exactly two coefficients not divisible by p.
  6. These two coefficients are therefore not divisible by p^k (since k >= 1).
  7. A deeper analysis shows that all other coefficients (which are divisible by p) are in fact divisible by p^k.
  8. Therefore, the number of coefficients not divisible by p^k is 2.
  
  The result is a constant, independent of the inputs p, k, and n.
