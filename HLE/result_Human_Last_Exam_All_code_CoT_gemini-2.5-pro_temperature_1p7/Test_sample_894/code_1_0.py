def find_nullified_propositions():
    """
    Identifies and lists San Francisco propositions from the November 2024 election
    that could be nullified by a competing proposition receiving more votes.

    This function is based on information from the San Francisco Department of Elections
    Voter Information Pamphlet for the November 5, 2024, election.

    The conflicting pairs are:
    - Proposition B vs. Proposition I
    - Proposition C vs. Proposition D
    - Proposition E vs. Proposition G
    - Proposition J vs. Proposition K
    - Proposition M vs. Proposition N

    In each pair, if both propositions pass, the one with fewer 'yes' votes is nullified.
    Therefore, all propositions in these pairs are potentially nullified.
