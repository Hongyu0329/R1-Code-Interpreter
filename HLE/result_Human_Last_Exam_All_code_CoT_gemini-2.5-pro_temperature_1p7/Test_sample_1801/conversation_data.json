    "Of course. Here is the plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will identify the two Nobel laureates who were featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial from the year 2000. This is a known historical fact.\n\nSecond, I will write a Python script that stores these two names in variables.\n\nFinally, the script will print a formatted string that clearly states the names of the two individuals as the answer to the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_enron_commercial_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of the two Nobel laureates\n    featured in the 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The two Nobel laureates in question are Amartya Sen and Paul Krugman.\n    # Amartya Sen won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998.\n    # Paul Krugman won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, after the commercial aired.\n    laureate1 = \"Paul Krugman\"\n    laureate2 = \"Amartya Sen\"\n\n    print(f\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the 2000 Enron 'Ask Why' commercial were {laureate1} and {laureate2}.\")\n\nsolve_enron_commercial_question()\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Amartya Sen>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
