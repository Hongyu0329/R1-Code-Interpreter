    "To find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate the Rank of NS(X) to the Jacobian of C:** There's a well-known result in algebraic geometry that for a curve C of genus `g` and $d > 2g-2$, the rank of the Néron-Severi group (also known as the Picard number, ρ) of the d-th symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ is given by the formula:\n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$\n    where $J(C)$ is the Jacobian variety of C.\n\n2.  **Verify the Condition:** For our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. The condition is $15 > 2 \\times 3 - 2$, which simplifies to $15 > 4$. This condition holds, so we can use the formula.\n\n3.  **Determine the Range for $\\rho(J(C))$:** The problem now reduces to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve.\n    *   **Minimum:** For a *very general* curve C, its Jacobian $J(C)$ has the minimal number of algebraic cycles, corresponding to an endomorphism ring of just $\\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n    *   **Maximum:** The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(J(C))$. For an abelian variety of dimension g, $h^{1,1} = g^2$. For our genus 3 curve, the Jacobian is a 3-dimensional abelian variety, so the maximum possible rank is $3^2=9$. This maximum is achieved for special curves with complex multiplication, like the Klein quartic, whose Jacobian is isogenous to a product of three elliptic curves with complex multiplication.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Ranks:** We can now substitute the minimum and maximum values of $\\rho(J(C))$ back into our formula.\n    *   **Smallest Rank of NS(X):** $1 (\\text{from } J(C)) + 1 = 2$.\n    *   **Largest Rank of NS(X):** $9 (\\text{from } J(C)) + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe following Python script formalizes this calculation and prints the results.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the problem parameters\n    g = 3  # Genus of the Riemann surface C\n    d = 15 # Degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group (NS group) of X = C^(15),\")\n    print(f\"where C is a Riemann surface of genus g = {g}, and X is its d = {d}-th symmetric power.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: State the key formula and verify its condition\n    print(\"Step 1: Use the standard formula relating the Picard number of the symmetric power to the Jacobian.\")\n    print(\"The formula is rho(C^(d)) = rho(J(C)) + 1, valid for d > 2*g - 2.\")\n    \n    condition_val = 2 * g - 2\n    print(f\"For g={g} and d={d}, the condition is {d} > 2*{g} - 2, which is {d} > {condition_val}.\")\n    print(\"Since the condition holds, the formula is applicable.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the range of rho(J(C))\n    print(\"Step 2: Find the minimum and maximum possible values for rho(J(C)) for a genus 3 curve.\")\n\n    # Minimum rank for J(C)\n    min_rho_J_C = 1\n    print(f\"The minimum rank, rho_min(J(C)), is {min_rho_J_C}.
