    "Of course, I can help with that. Here are the steps to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to present the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Factor the term**: The term inside the product can be factored using the cubic roots of unity, which are $1, \\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}, \\text{ and } \\omega^2 = e^{i4\\pi/3}$. The factorization is:\n    $$ 1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Relate to a known product**: The infinite product can be expressed using the above factorization. We can then use the well-known identity related to the Gamma function, which stems from the Weierstrass factorization. This identity is a generalization of the sine product formula:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n3.  **Adjust the product's starting index**: The problem asks for the product starting from $n=3$, while the identity starts from $n=1$. To adjust this, we need to divide the full product by the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n4.  **Combine the results**: By substituting the Gamma function identity into the expression from the previous step, we arrive at the final formula.\n\nHere is the Python code that prints the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_product_formula():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints the closed-form expression for the given infinite product.\n  Note: This code provides the symbolic answer, not a numerical computation.\n  The symbols 'Gamma', 'exp', 'pi', and 'i' represent their usual mathematical meanings.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # The product starts from n=3, so we divide the general formula\n  # by the terms for n=1 and n=2.\n  n1_term = \"1 - z^3/1^3\"\n  n2_term = \"1 - z^3/2^3\"\n  \n  # The product of Gamma functions in the denominator of the general formula.\n  # Using w = exp(2*pi*i/3) notation is also common.\n  gamma_terms = \"Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - exp(2*pi*i/3)*z) * Gamma(1 - exp(4*pi*i/3)*z)\"\n\n  # Constructing the final expression string.\n  # The numbers from the original equation (3) and the derivation (1, 2) are present.\n  final_expression = f\"1 / ( ({n1_term}) * ({n2_term}) * ({gamma_terms}) )\"\n  \n  print(final_expression)\n\ndisplay_product_formula()\n```\n<<<1 / ( (1 - z^3/1^3) * (1 - z^3/2^3) * (Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - exp(2*pi*i/3)*z) * Gamma(1 - exp(4*pi*i/3)*z)) )>>>"
