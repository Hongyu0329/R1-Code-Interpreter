    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Decomposition of the Problem**: The problem asks for the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor $d$ and order $k$. A character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if its conductor is exactly $d$. If the prime factorization of $d$ is $p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$, then a character $\\chi$ is a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i^{a_i}$, i.e., $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $d$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters $\\chi_i$.\n\n2.  **Factorization and Simplification**: First, I will find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. I find that $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Since $d$ is square-free, the condition for a character $\\chi_p$ modulo a prime $p$ to be primitive is that it is not the trivial character, i.e., its order must be greater than 1.\n\n3.  **Counting Using Inclusion-Exclusion**: We need to find the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that each $\\chi_p$ has an order greater than 1, and the lcm of their orders is exactly $k=6$. I will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion, formalized with the MÃ¶bius inversion formula for multiplicative functions on the lattice of divisors of $k$.\n    The number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ and exact order $k$, let's call it $C^*(k, d)$, is given by:\n    $C^*(k, d) = \\sum_{m|k} \\mu(k/m) C(m, d)$\n    where $C(m, d)$ is the number of primitive characters with conductor $d$ whose order divides $m$.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Terms**:\n    *   For each prime factor $p$ of $d$, the number of primitive characters modulo $p$ whose order divides $m$ is the sum of $\\phi(j)$ for all $j>1$ that divide $m$. Let this count be $N_m$.\n    *   Since our $d$ is a product of distinct primes, $C(m, d) = (N_m)^r$, where $r$ is the number of prime factors of $d$.\n    *   I will calculate $N_m$ for each divisor $m$ of $k=6$.\n    *   Then, I'll compute each term $\\mu(k/m) \\times C(m, d)$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Finally, I will sum these terms to get the final answer and present the full equation as requested. The Python code below will implement these steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary {prime: exponent}.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = {1, n}\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef get_prime_factors_from_dict(factors_dict):\n    \"\"\"Returns the set of prime factors from a factorization dictionary.\"\"\"\n    return set(factors_dict.keys())\n\ndef phi(n, factors=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    Optionally accepts a precomputed prime factorization.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    if factors is None:\n        factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    result = n\n    for p in factors:\n        result -= result // p\n    return int(result)\n\ndef mu(n, factors=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    Optionally accepts a precomputed prime factorization.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    if factors is None:\n        factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    k = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d={d} and order k={k}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Prime factorization of d\n    d_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = list(d_factors.keys())\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of d = {d} is: {' * '.join(map(str, primes))}\")\n    \n    if not all(val == 1 for val in d_factors.values()):\n        print(\"This script is specialized for square-free conductors.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 2: Use the formula based on Mobius inversion\n    # C*(k,d) = sum_{m|k} mu(k/m) * C(m,d)\n    print(\"\\nWe use the formula: C*(k,d) = sum_{m|k} mu(k/m) * C(m,d)\")\n    print(\"where C(m,d) is the number of primitive characters with conductor d whose order divides m.\")\n    \n    divisors_of_k = get_divisors(k)\n    final_terms = {}\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculating each term:\")\n    for m in divisors_of_k:\n        # Calculate C(m,d)\n        # For square-free d, C(m,d) = (num_prim_chars_mod_p_order_divides_m) ^ (num_prime_factors)\n        \n        divisors_of_m = get_divisors(m)\n        \n        # Calculate Num(m): number of prim. chars mod p with order dividing m.\n        # This is sum(phi(j)) for j|m and j>1.\n        num_prim_chars_per_p = 0\n        for j in divisors_of_m:\n            if j > 1:\n                # Assuming j | (p-1) for all primes p, which is true in this problem.\n                num_prim_chars_per_p += phi(j)\n        \n        # Calculate C(m, d)\n        C_m_d = num_prim_chars_per_p ** len(primes)\n        \n        mu_val = mu(k // m)\n        term_value = mu_val * C_m_d\n        final_terms[m] = term_value\n        \n        print(f\"For m = {m}:\")\n        print(f\"  - Num primitive chars mod p with order dividing {m} = {num_prim_chars_per_p}\")\n        print(f\"  - C({m},{d}) = {num_prim_chars_per_p}^{len(primes)} = {C_m_d}\")\n        print(f\"  - mu({k}/{m}) = mu({k//m}) = {mu_val}\")\n        print(f\"  - Term = {mu_val} * {C_m_d} = {term_value}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Sum the terms for the final answer\n    total_count = sum(final_terms.values())\n    \n    # Sort terms by m for a consistent equation\n    equation_parts = [f\"({final_terms[m]})\" for m in sorted(final_terms.keys())]\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The final calculation is the sum of these terms.\")\n    \n    # We re-order the terms to match the Mobius inversion sum from C(k,d) perspective\n    # C*(k) = C(k) - C(k/p1) - ...\n    # This translates to C*(6) = C(6) - C(3) - C(2) + C(1)\n    \n    # Let's map my final_terms dictionary back to the C(m,d) values\n    # Term for m=1 has mu(6)=1.
