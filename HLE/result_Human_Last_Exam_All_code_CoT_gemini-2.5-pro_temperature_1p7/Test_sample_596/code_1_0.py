def solve_mobius_forests():
    """
    Calculates the number of higher dimensional rooted forests on a Möbius band
    that fail to simplicially collapse onto their root.

    The problem is solved using a theorem from combinatorial topology, which states
    the number is the square of the order of the torsion subgroup of the
    second integer homology group of the Möbius band.

    Steps:
    1. The space is the Möbius band (M), which is 2-dimensional. The forests are 2-dimensional.
       The relevant homology group is H_2(M, Z).

    2. A standard topological result is that the Möbius band is homotopy equivalent to a circle (S^1),
       as it deformation retracts onto its core circle.
       Therefore, their homology groups are isomorphic: H_k(M, Z) ≅ H_k(S^1, Z).

    3. The second homology group of the circle with integer coefficients is the trivial group: H_2(S^1, Z) = {0}.

    4. Consequently, the second homology group of the Möbius band is also trivial: H_2(M, Z) = {0}.

    5. The torsion subgroup of the trivial group {0} is {0} itself.

    6. The size (or order) of this torsion subgroup is 1.
