    "To solve this problem, we need to determine a specific quantity from the field of combinatorial topology. The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing formula:** The question asks for the number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests $(F,R)$\" on a triangulated space that \"fail to simplicially collapse onto the root $R$\". According to a theorem by Duval, Klivans, and Martin, this number is given by the square of the size of the torsion subgroup of the top-dimensional integer homology group of the space. For a $d$-dimensional complex $K$, the formula is $N = |\\text{Tors}(H_d(K, \\mathbb{Z}))|^2$.\n\n2.  **Apply the formula to the Möbius band:** The space in question is the Möbius band, which is a 2-dimensional manifold (with boundary). The \"higher dimensional forests\" refer to 2-dimensional forests. Therefore, we need to compute $N = |\\text{Tors}(H_2(M, \\mathbb{Z}))|^2$, where $M$ represents the Möbius band. The specific choice of \"standard triangulation\" does not change the homology groups, as they are topological invariants.\n\n3.  **Calculate the required homology group:** The core of the problem is to find the second homology group of the Möbius band with integer coefficients, $H_2(M, \\mathbb{Z})$. A fundamental property of the Möbius band is that it deformation retracts onto its central circle. This means the Möbius band is homotopy equivalent to the circle, $S^1$. A key theorem in algebraic topology states that homotopy equivalent spaces have isomorphic homology groups.\n\n4.  **Use the homology of the circle:** The integer homology groups of the circle ($S^1$) are well-known:\n    *   $H_0(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H_1(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H_k(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 2$.\n\n5.  **Determine the final number:** Since $M \\simeq S^1$, we have $H_2(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_2(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. The group is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$. The torsion subgroup of the trivial group is the group itself, $\\{0\\}$, which has a size (order) of 1. Plugging this into the formula gives the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code performs the final step of the calculation based on this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mobius_forests():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of higher dimensional rooted forests on a Möbius band\n    that fail to simplicially collapse onto their root.\n\n    The problem is solved using a theorem from combinatorial topology, which states\n    the number is the square of the order of the torsion subgroup of the\n    second integer homology group of the Möbius band.\n\n    Steps:\n    1. The space is the Möbius band (M), which is 2-dimensional. The forests are 2-dimensional.\n       The relevant homology group is H_2(M, Z).\n\n    2. A standard topological result is that the Möbius band is homotopy equivalent to a circle (S^1),\n       as it deformation retracts onto its core circle.\n       Therefore, their homology groups are isomorphic: H_k(M, Z) ≅ H_k(S^1, Z).\n\n    3. The second homology group of the circle with integer coefficients is the trivial group: H_2(S^1, Z) = {0}.\n\n    4. Consequently, the second homology group of the Möbius band is also trivial: H_2(M, Z) = {0}.\n\n    5. The torsion subgroup of the trivial group {0} is {0} itself.\n\n    6.
