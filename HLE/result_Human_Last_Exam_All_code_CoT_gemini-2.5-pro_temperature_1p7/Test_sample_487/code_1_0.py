# Step 1: Determine the properties of the involution psi on the curve C
# C is a complex curve of genus 2. Let psi be an involution on C.
# The Riemann-Hurwitz formula relates the genus of C, the genus of the quotient C' = C/psi,
# and the number of fixed points N_f:
# 2*g(C) - 2 = 2 * (2*g(C') - 2) + N_f
# For g(C) = 2, this is: 2 = 4*g(C') - 4 + N_f.
# To maximize h^{1,1}(M), we need to maximize N_f. This occurs when g(C') is minimal.
# The minimal possible genus for C' is 0.
genus_C = 2
genus_C_quotient = 0
N_f = 2 * genus_C - 2 - 2 * (2 * genus_C_quotient - 2)

# Step 2: Determine the optimal properties of the involution rho on the K3 surface S
# rho is a non-symplectic involution on S. Its fixed locus S^rho is a union of smooth curves.
# Let r be the rank of the invariant lattice H^2(S,Z)^rho, which is equal to h^{1,1}_+(S).
# Let the fixed locus S^rho consist of a curve of genus g and k_0 rational curves.
# The total number of connected components of S^rho is k = k_0 + 1 (g>0 is required).
# These parameters are constrained by the formula: g - k_0 = 12 - r.
# From Nikulin's classification, the rank r can be between 2 and 10, and g cannot exceed 9.

# We want to maximize h^{1,1}(M) = (r + 1) + k * N_f = r + 1 + (k_0 + 1) * N_f.
# Substituting N_f = 6, we want to maximize r + 1 + 6*(k_0+1) = r + 6*k_0 + 7.
# The constraint g = k_0 + 12 - r <= 9 implies k_0 <= r - 3.
# To maximize r + 6*k_0 + 7, we should choose the largest possible values for r and k_0.
r = 10  # Maximal possible rank
k_0 = r - 3  # Maximal k_0 for r=10, respecting g<=9
g = k_0 + 12 - r
k = k_0 + 1

# Step 3: Calculate the maximal Hodge number h^{1,1}(M)
# The resolution M has Hodge number h^{1,1}(M) given by:
# h^{1,1}(M) = h^{1,1}_+(S x C) + N_blowup
# where h^{1,1}_+(S x C) = h^{1,1}_+(S) + h^{1,1}(C) = r + 1
