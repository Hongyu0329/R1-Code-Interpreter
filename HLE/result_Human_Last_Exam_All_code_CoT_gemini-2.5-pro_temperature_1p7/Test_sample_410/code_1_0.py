# Part 1: We determined the coefficients of f(x).
# f(x) = (1/4)e^(2x) + e^x - 3.

# Part 2: We analyzed the integral equation and found it holds
# if a = f(ln(b)).
# a = (1/4)b^2 + b - 3

# Part 3: We select the unique solution derived from the problem's specific data.
# The problem gives the condition f(ln 2) = 0.
# We choose b such that ln(b) = ln(2), which means b = 2.
# Then a = f(ln 2), which means a = 0.
a = 0
b = 2

# Part 4: Calculate the sum a + b.
result = a + b

# Print the final equation and the answer.
print(f"The determined values for the integral equation are a = {a} and b = {b}.")
print(f"The sum is calculated from the equation: {a} + {b} = {result}")
print(f"The value of a+b is {result}.")
