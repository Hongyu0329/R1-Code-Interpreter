# We assume the intended equation was the linear ODE: dT/dt + 2*sinh(2t)*T = 2*sinh(2t)^3.
# The analytical solution to this ODE with the initial condition T(0)=0 is T(t) = (cosh(2t) - 1)^2.

# We need to find the temperature at the time t where cosh(2*t) = 2.

# Calculate the final temperature T using the solution.

# The final equation to calculate the temperature is T = (cosh(2t) - 1)^2.
# At the specified time, this becomes T = (2 - 1)^2.
