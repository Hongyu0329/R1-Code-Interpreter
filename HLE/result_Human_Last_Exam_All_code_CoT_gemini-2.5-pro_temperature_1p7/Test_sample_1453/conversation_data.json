    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence, we will analyze its potential to form a coiled-coil structure. The stability and oligomerization of coiled-coils are primarily dictated by the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of amino acid side chains at the core of the bundle. These core residues are typically found at the 'a' and 'd' positions of a seven-residue (heptad) repeat, denoted `abcdefg`.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** I will write a Python script to analyze the provided sequence. The script will test all seven possible starting \"frames\" for the heptad repeat.\n2.  **Find the Optimal Core:** For each frame, the script will identify the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions. The most likely correct frame is the one that places the most hydrophobic residues (like L, I, V, A) into this core, as this leads to a stable structure.\n3.  **Analyze Core Composition:** Once the optimal frame is found, the script will list the specific amino acids found at all 'a' and 'd' positions.\n4.  **Predict Oligomeric State:** Based on established principles of packing efficiency, the composition of the 'a' and 'd' positions determines the number of helices in the coil. The script will apply a common rule: a pattern of Alanine (A) at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) at the 'd' position strongly favors the formation of a two-stranded coiled-coil, or a dimer. The code will output this analysis and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coil_oligomerization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a protein sequence to determine its likely coiled-coil oligomeric state\n    by identifying the heptad repeat and analyzing the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = \"GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG\"\n\n    # A simple set of common hydrophobic core residues.\n    hydrophobic_residues = {'L', 'I', 'V', 'A', 'M', 'F', 'W'}\n\n    best_frame_start_index = -1\n    max_hydrophobic_score = -1\n    best_a_residues = []\n    best_d_residues = []\n\n    # 1.
