        "The Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) is a nuclear receptor and transcription factor. "
        "Like many such proteins, it has a modular structure with distinct functional domains. "
        "The most relevant here are:\n"
        "1. DNA-Binding Domain (DBD): Binds to specific DNA sequences.\n"
        "2. Ligand-Binding Domain (LBD): Binds retinoic acid (RA) and is crucial for recruiting other "
        "proteins to activate transcription.\n\nA key concept is that these domains are structurally and "
        "functionally semi-independent. A mutation in one domain (e.g., LBD) will affect its "
        "function (e.g., RA binding and activation) but will not necessarily destroy the "
        "function of a separate domain (e.g., the DBD's ability to bind DNA)."

    # Analysis of Choice A
    analysis_a = (
        "A. 'RAR mutants with insertions at sites g and h disrupt transcriptional activation but retain DNA binding.'\n"
        "   - This statement is highly plausible. It describes a scenario where mutations occur in a region essential for "
        "transcriptional activation (likely the LBD or a co-activator binding surface) but not in the DBD. The mutant "
        "receptor can therefore still find and sit on the DNA but is unable to 'switch on' the gene. "
        "This perfectly illustrates the modular nature of the protein."
    )
    print(textwrap.fill(analysis_a, 80))

    # Analysis of Choice D (as a key incorrect option)
    analysis_d = (
        "\nD. 'All mutants that are defective in RA binding are also defective in both DNA binding and transcriptional "
        "activation, indicating a linked mechanism.'\n"
        "   - This statement makes a strong claim that is generally false. It violates the modularity principle. "
        "A mutant can lose its ability to bind RA due to a specific mutation in the LBD's binding pocket, but its separate DBD "
        "can remain perfectly functional, allowing it to still bind DNA. Therefore, being defective in RA binding does "
        "not necessitate being defective in DNA binding."

    conclusion = (
        "\nConclusion: Choice A describes a classic and fundamentally important experimental result in molecular biology, "
        "demonstrating that the functions of different protein domains can be uncoupled. Choice D makes an overly strong "
        "claim that contradicts this key principle. The other choices make specific claims that are less likely to be the "
        "main, generalizable takeaway. Therefore, Choice A is the most accurate description."
