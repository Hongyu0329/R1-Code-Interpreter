    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I need to understand the notation \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\). It represents the number of permutations of length `n` with exactly `k` inversions that avoid the pattern \\(\\sigma\\). In this problem, `n=333`, `k=3`, and the pattern \\(\\sigma\\) is `1324`.\n2.  The length of the permutation, `n=333`, is very large compared to the number of inversions, `k=3`. For a small, fixed `k`, the number of pattern-avoiding permutations with `k` inversions becomes stable for sufficiently large `n`. The value of \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) is the same for all `n` greater than some bound (e.g., for `k=3`, the value is stable for `n \\ge 6`).\n3.  I will use the known result from combinatorics that this stable value, for `k` inversions, is equal to the `(k+1)`-th Catalan number, which is denoted as `C_{k+1}`.\n4.  The problem is now reduced to calculating the Catalan number `C_m` for `m = k + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n5.  The formula for the `m`-th Catalan number is \\(C_m = \\frac{1}{m+1} \\binom{2m}{m}\\).\n6.  I will write a Python script to compute `C_4` using this formula and print the result along with the calculation steps, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks for the value of av_n^k(1324) where n=333 and k=3.\n# This represents the number of permutations of length 333 with 3 inversions\n# that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\n# For a fixed number of inversions k, this value is known to stabilize for large n.\n# Since n=333 is significantly larger than k=3, we can use this stable value.\n# The stable value for k inversions is given by the (k+1)-th Catalan number, C_{k+1}.\n\n# We need to calculate the Catalan number for k=3.\nk = 3\ncatalan_index = k + 1\n\n# The formula for the m-th Catalan number (starting with m=0) is:\n# C_m = (1 / (m + 1)) * C(2m, m), where C(a, b) is \"a choose b\".\nm = catalan_index\n\n# We calculate C_4.\ntwo_m = 2 * m\nbinomial_coefficient = math.comb(two_m, m)\ncatalan_number = binomial_coefficient // (m + 1)\n\nprint(\"The value of av_333^3(1324) is given by the (3+1)-th Catalan number, C_4.\")\nprint(f\"The formula for C_m is (1/(m+1)) * (2m choose m).\")\nprint(f\"For m = {m}, the formula is:\")\nprint(f\"C_{m} = (1 / ({m} + 1)) * ({two_m} choose {m})\")\nprint(f\"First, we calculate the binomial coefficient ({two_m} choose {m}):\")\nprint(f\"({two_m} choose {m}) = {binomial_coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"Then, we divide by (m + 1) = {m + 1}:\")\nprint(f\"C_{m} = {binomial_coefficient} / {m + 1}\")\nprint(f\"The final result is: {catalan_number}\")\n\n```\n<<<14>>>"
