    "This is a geographical riddle. I will break down the clues to find the solution.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will analyze the three key constraints given in the riddle:\n    *   **Location:** An island town.\n    *   **Remoteness:** More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island. This is a very specific and restrictive clue.\n    *   **Geography and Naming:** The town sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera, and the town's name is the same as the bay's name.\n\n2.  Next, I will use the remoteness clue to filter down the possible locations to the world's most isolated islands, such as Easter Island, Tristan da Cunha, and the Pitcairn Islands.\n\n3.  Then, I will evaluate these candidate locations against the other two clues (being on a caldera bay that shares the town's name).\n\n4.  I'll compare the candidates. For example, Pago Pago in American Samoa is a town on a caldera bay called Pago Pago Harbor, but it fails the remoteness test as it's only about 120 km from neighboring Samoa. Other locations like Tristan da Cunha are remote but don't have a caldera bay that shares the settlement's name.\n\n5.  The best fit is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n    *   **Remoteness:** Easter Island is famously isolated, over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands, fitting the \"> 500 km\" rule perfectly.\n    *   **Naming:** The main town is named **Hanga Roa**, and it is located on **Hanga Roa Bay**.\n    *   **Geology:** While the entire island is volcanic, geologists would not classify Hanga Roa Bay as a textbook caldera. However, among all the remote islands, it is the only one where the town and bay share a name. Riddles often sacrifice strict scientific accuracy for a clever answer, and in this context, it's the most logical solution.\n\n6.  Finally, I will write a simple Python script to print the name of the town.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function solves the geographical riddle based on the provided clues.\n  \n  The clues are:\n  1. An island town.\n  2. More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\n  3. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name.\n\n  The best fit for these clues is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n  - Remoteness: Easter Island is one of the most isolated places on Earth.\n  - Name Match: The town of Hanga Roa is on Hanga Roa Bay.\n  - Caldera Bay: While geologically not a perfect caldera, the bay is on a famous volcanic island, making it the most plausible answer for the riddle.\n  \"\"\"\n  town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n  print(f\"The island town described in the riddle is: {town_name}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
