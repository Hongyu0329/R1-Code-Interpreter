  This function solves the geographical riddle based on the provided clues.
  
  The clues are:
  1. An island town.
  2. More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.
  3. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name.

  The best fit for these clues is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).
  - Remoteness: Easter Island is one of the most isolated places on Earth.
  - Name Match: The town of Hanga Roa is on Hanga Roa Bay.
  - Caldera Bay: While geologically not a perfect caldera, the bay is on a famous volcanic island, making it the most plausible answer for the riddle.
