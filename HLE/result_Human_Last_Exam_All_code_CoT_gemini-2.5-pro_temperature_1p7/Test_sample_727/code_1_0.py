    # 1. The Position
    # The Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) for the position after White's 130. Kh3 is:
    # 4k3/8/8/4PR1N/8/7K/q7/8 b - - 1 130
    # White has: King on h3, Rook on f5, Knight on h5, Pawn on e5.
    # Black has: King on e8, Queen on a2.
    # It is Black's turn to move.

    # 2. The Blunder in the Game
    # In the actual game, Nepomniachtchi played 130... Qe6.

    print("After 131. Kh4, Black has no adequate defense and the position is lost.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # 3. The Correct Drawing Move
    # The drawing move is 130... Qa1.
