# This script calculates the answer for part (b) and formats the final response.

# Part (a): No. As reasoned in the steps above, if F in F and G in G have disjoint supports,
# |F intersect G| = 0, violating the cross 1-intersection property.

# Part (b): Calculation for the maximal sum |F|+|G| with k=2, m=5, t=1.
m = 5
k = 2
t = 1

# According to the cross-intersection theorem for multisets, for m >= k+t,
# the maximum sum |F| + |G| is given by 2 * C(m + k - t - 1, k - t).
# We verify the condition: 5 >= 2 + 1, which is true.

# Now, we perform the calculation:
n_val = m + k - t - 1
r_val = k - t
term1 = 2
combination = math.comb(n_val, r_val)
answer_b_val = term1 * combination

# Printing the equation with each number.
print("Calculation for part (b):")
final_equation = f"{term1} * C({m} + {k} - {t} - 1, {k} - {t}) = {term1} * C({n_val}, {r_val}) = {term1} * {combination} = {answer_b_val}"
print(final_equation)


# Part (c): No. As reasoned above, for the case m = k+1, there exist other
# families that achieve the maximal sum but are not of the "trivial" form
# (all k-multisets containing a fixed element).

# Consolidating the final answer in the requested format.
