# Step 1: Determine a and lambda based on the analysis
# Based on the graphical analysis of y_h'(x) vs (20/n)x, we concluded:
a = 2  # Number of extrema for n = 10000
lamb = 2  # Number of extrema for n = -2000

# The problem asks for N, but we'll see it's not needed for the final value.
# Let's represent it symbolically for the printout.
N_symbolic = 'N'

# Step 2: Set up the parameters for the y_3 equation
# Calculate the coefficient in the fractional DE
# This is the key step where the problem simplifies
coeff = (a - lamb) / (lamb**a)

# Step 3: Solve for y_3(x)
# The fractional DE is D^(1/2)y_3 + coeff * y_2s'(x) = 0
# Since coeff is 0, the DE becomes D^(1/2)y_3 = 0.
# With y_3(0) = 0, the solution is y_3(x) = 0 for all x.

# Step 4: Calculate x0 and evaluate y_3(x0)
x0 = (math.pi / lamb)**lamb
y3_at_x0 = 0

# Step 5: Calculate the final expression
exponent = lamb / a
# Since y3_at_x0 is 0 and the exponent is positive, the result is 0.
# Any finite N multiplied by 0 is 0.
final_result = 0
