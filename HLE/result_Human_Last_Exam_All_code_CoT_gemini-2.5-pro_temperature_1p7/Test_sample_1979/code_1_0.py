    """
    Determines if the set Sigma is empty. If not, computes the minimum of the maximums
    of the sets in Sigma.

    The set Sigma is defined as:
    Sigma = { A | A is a finite non-empty subset of positive integers,
                  A != {2},
                  A+A is a subset of A*A }
    where A+A is the sumset and A*A is the product set.

    The function will search for the smallest possible maximum element M that a set in Sigma can have.
    It iterates M from 1 upwards. For each M, it checks all possible subsets of {1, ..., M}
    that contain M and satisfy the properties derived in the reasoning. If a valid set is found,
    M is the answer.

    If the search does not find any set up to a reasonable bound, it is concluded that Sigma is empty,
    and the function returns 0.
