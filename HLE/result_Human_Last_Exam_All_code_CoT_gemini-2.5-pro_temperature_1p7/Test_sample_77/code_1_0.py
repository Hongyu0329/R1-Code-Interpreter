        "Here is a breakdown of why each part works as intended:\n\n"
        "1. Domain: The domain object correctly serves as the master container for the "
        "simulation. It defines the physical boundaries of the simulated space. By acting "
        "as a barrier, it will prevent fluid from leaving the scene, including stopping "
        "it at the bottom, which is its standard and required function.\n\n"
        "2. Fluid Emitter (Inflow Sphere): A mesh object set as an 'Inflow' type is the "
        "standard method for introducing fluid into a simulation. The sphere will continuously "
        "emit fluid particles from its volume, acting as a source, exactly as required.\n\n"
        "3. Obstacle (Plane): Any mesh object set as an 'Obstacle' will be treated by the "
        "solver as a solid, non-permeable object. The fluid will collide with the plane, "
        "splash, and flow across its surface or around its edges, which is the expected behavior.\n\n"
        "In conclusion, the setup contains all the necessary elements for a valid simulation: "
        "a boundary to define the space, a source to create the fluid, and an object for the "
        "fluid to interact with. The simulation would proceed as you'd expect: fluid appears from "
        "the sphere, falls, hits the plane, and is contained within the domain."
