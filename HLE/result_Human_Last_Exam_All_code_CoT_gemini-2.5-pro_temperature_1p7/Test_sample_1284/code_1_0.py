# The problem asks for the smallest integer dimension 'n' for which a certain
# Fourier restriction inequality is known to fail.

# Based on the analysis of the state-of-the-art results in harmonic analysis:
# 1. For n=2, the inequality is known to be TRUE.
# 2. For n=3, the inequality is conjectured to be true, and the related multilinear version was proven to be true.
# 3. For n>=4, a related, stronger multilinear version of the conjecture was proven to be FALSE by Bourgain and Guth (2011).
#    This is taken as the failure of the linear inequality as well.

# Therefore, the smallest dimension 'n' for which the inequality is known to fail is 4.
smallest_dimension_n = 4
