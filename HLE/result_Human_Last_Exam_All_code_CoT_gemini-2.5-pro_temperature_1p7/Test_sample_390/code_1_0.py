# This is a conceptual demonstration. We'll generate points and check a property.
# No plot is generated, as we must provide a direct answer.

# Plan:
# 1. Define two sets of basis vectors for n=3. One orthogonal, one not.
# 2. Generate many random unit vectors `s`.
# 3. For each `s`, compute the point x = (|<y1,s>|^2, |<y2,s>|^2, |<y3,s>|^2).
# 4. Check the properties of the resulting set of points.

# Case 1: Orthonormal basis y_i = e_i
# y_vectors_ortho = np.identity(3)
# For any unit vector s = (s1, s2, s3), the point in S is (s1^2, s2^2, s3^2).
# The sum of components is s1^2 + s2^2 + s3^2 = 1.
# This describes a standard 2-simplex (a triangle in 3D space).
# So, the shape is a simplex (Answer A is true for this case).

# Case 2: Non-orthogonal basis in 2D
# y1 = (1, 0), y2 = (cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4))
# As shown in the detailed thought process, this produces an ellipse, which is a 2D ellipsoid.
# So, Answer D is true for this case.

# Case 3: Non-orthogonal basis in 3D
# Here, the surface is not an ellipsoid.
# An ellipsoid is a quadric surface (described by a degree-2 polynomial).
# The equation for S, sqrt(x)^T * G^-1 * sqrt(x) = 1, is generally not a degree-2 polynomial in x for n>=3.
