    Analyzes the provided text and evaluates the answer choices to find the one that is not true.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The text establishes that CA aphids are adapted to raffinose and MA aphids are adapted to sucrose.
    2.  Galactosidase is the enzyme for raffinose metabolism.
    3.  A: TRUE. CA's adaptation to a raffinose-rich diet implies an enhanced ability to metabolize it compared to MA.
    4.  B: TRUE. This is explicitly stated in the text.
    5.  C: TRUE. When CA moves to cotton (low raffinose), the lack of its substrate (raffinose) would logically lead to decreased activity of its digestive enzyme (galactosidase).
    6.  E: TRUE. When MA moves to watermelon (high raffinose), the new presence of the substrate (raffinose) would likely induce increased production/activity of galactosidase.
    7.  D: NOT TRUE. This statement gives an alternative reason for the decreased galactosidase activity in CA aphids on cotton. It claims the cause is "higher glucose levels." While cotton is sucrose-rich (implying glucose availability), the most direct and supported cause for a change in galactosidase activity is the change in its specific substrate, raffinose. The text provides no evidence to support the claim that glucose levels are the cause, making this assertion unsubstantiated and thus the 'not true' statement.
    """
    # The incorrect statement is D because the reasoning it provides is not directly supported by the text.
    # The most logical reason for decreased galactosidase activity is the lack of its substrate (raffinose), as stated in C.
    answer = 'D'
