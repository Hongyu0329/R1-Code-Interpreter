def solve_homeomorphism_problem():
    """
    Solves the topological problem regarding the number of homeomorphism classes.

    The problem describes a compact topological space X with two properties:
    1. X contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
       This means X is a compactification of R.
    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.
       This is the universal mapping property that defines the Stone-Cech compactification.

    Let's analyze these properties:
    - The space X is defined as a compactification of the long ray R.
    - The second property is the key. For any Tychonoff space Y, there exists a
      unique (up to homeomorphism) compactification, called the Stone-Cech
      compactification (beta Y), which is characterized by the property that every
      bounded continuous function from Y to the real numbers extends uniquely to it.
    - The long ray R is a Tychonoff space, so its Stone-Cech compactification, beta R,
      exists and is unique up to homeomorphism.
    - The properties given for X are precisely the defining properties of beta R.
    - Therefore, any space X that satisfies these conditions must be homeomorphic to beta R.
    - Since all such spaces X are homeomorphic to each other, they all fall into
      the same single homeomorphism class.

    Thus, the number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.
