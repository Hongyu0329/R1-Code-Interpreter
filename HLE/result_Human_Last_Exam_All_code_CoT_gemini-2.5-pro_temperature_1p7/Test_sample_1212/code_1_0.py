    The analysis shows that the Black group's life or death hinges
    on the point B2. By playing at B2, White occupies the vital point
    of Black's eye shape. Any attempt by Black to create an eye elsewhere
    (at A1 or B1) can be refuted by White, leading to the group's capture.
    
    Therefore, there is only one move that initiates a killing sequence.
