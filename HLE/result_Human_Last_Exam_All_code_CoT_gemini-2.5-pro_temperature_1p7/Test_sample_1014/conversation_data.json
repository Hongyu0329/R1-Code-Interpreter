    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will perform prime factorization on the number. My approach will be as follows:\n\n1.  **Trial Division:** I will use the trial division method, which is efficient for numbers of this magnitude.\n2.  **Handle the factor 2:** I'll first check for and divide out all factors of 2.\n3.  **Iterate through odd numbers:** Since the number is not even, all its prime factors must be odd. I will then iterate through odd numbers (3, 5, 7, ...) up to the square root of the remaining number.\n4.  **Factorization:** For any number `i` that divides our target number `n`, I will add `i` to our list of factors and divide `n` by `i` until it's no longer divisible.\n5.  **Final Factor:** If any number remains after the loop, that number itself must be a prime factor.\n6.  **Output:** I will print the complete prime factorization to show each number in the equation, and then identify and print the largest prime factor from the list.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_factor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest prime factor of a given integer n and prints the factorization.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor of 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors starting from 3\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of the number\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n\n    # This condition is to handle the case when n is a prime number\n    # greater than 2. The remaining n will be the largest prime factor.\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    if not factors:\n        print(f\"{original_n} has no prime factors greater than 1.\")\n        largest_prime = None\n    elif len(factors) == 1:\n        # This means the original number is prime\n        largest_prime = factors[0]\n        print(f\"{original_n} is a prime number, so its largest prime divisor is {largest_prime}.\")\n    else:\n        # Construct and print the factorization equation\n        equation_str = f\"{original_n} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n        print(\"The prime factorization is:\")\n        print(equation_str)\n\n        # Find and print the largest prime factor\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor is: {largest_prime}\")\n\n    return largest_prime\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    number_to_factor = 8139881\n    find_largest_prime_factor(number_to_factor)\n\n```\n<<<8069>>>"
