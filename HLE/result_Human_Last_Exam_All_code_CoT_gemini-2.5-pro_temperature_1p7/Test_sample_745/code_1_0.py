def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function states the solution to the topology problem.
    The largest number of components X \ C can have is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by c.
    This is based on the existence of pathological topological spaces that serve as counterexamples
    to the more intuitive result that X \ C should be connected. These constructions can be
    extended to create a number of components equal to the cardinality of the space itself.
