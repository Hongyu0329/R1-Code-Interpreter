    # Step 1: Define Total Revenue (TR) in terms of the given areas.
    # Total Revenue = Price * Quantity.
    # The problem states that the price is P and the quantity is q1. So, TR = P * q1.
    # Area S is the rectangle with height P and width q1. So, S = P * q1.

    # At quantity q1, the Average Total Cost is ATC(q1). So, TC = ATC(q1) * q1.
    # Area H is the rectangle with height ATC(q1) and width q1. So, H = ATC(q1) * q1.
    # Therefore, Total Cost is represented by area H.
