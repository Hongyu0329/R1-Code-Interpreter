    # Step 1: Interpretation of the problem.
    # The question asks for 'n' where a "tame functor" f over an "upper semilattice" J is "n-resolvable".
    # - A functor f: J -> Vect_K is a representation of the poset J.
    # - "Tame" is a property of the entire category of representations of J. We assume the question implies
    #   that this category, Fun(J, Vect_K), is of tame representation type.
    # - An "upper semilattice" J is a poset where every pair of elements has a least upper bound. This
    #   is a structural condition on J.
    # - A functor f is "n-resolvable" if its (n+1)-th syzygy, Omega^{n+1}(f), is a projective module.
    #   The k-th syzygy Omega^k(f) is the kernel in the k-th step of a minimal projective resolution of f.

    # Step 2: State the relevant mathematical result.
    # A theorem by S. Kasjan in "Homological properties of representations of poset of tame type" (2008)
    # states that any representation of a finite poset of tame representation type is 2-resolvable.
    # The "upper semilattice" property is compatible with the "tame" property and does not alter this general result.

    # Step 3: Determine the value of n.
    # From the theorem, if the functor is tame, it is 2-resolvable.
    # This directly gives us the value of n.
    n = 2

    # Step 4: Display the result and the defining equation.
