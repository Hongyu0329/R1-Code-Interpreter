    "The problem asks for the value of $n$ for which a tame functor over an upper semilattice is $n$-resolvable.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terms:** I will first clarify the meaning of the mathematical terms involved: \"upper semilattice\", \"tame functor\", and \"n-resolvable\". The term \"tame\" usually applies to a category of representations, not a single functor, so I will interpret the question in that context. The definition of \"n-resolvable\" can vary, so I will use the one standard in the relevant literature.\n2.  **Find the Key Theorem:** I will find the central theorem in the representation theory of posets that links the \"tame\" property to a specific homological property like being \"n-resolvable\". The condition that the poset $J$ is an \"upper semilattice\" is a structural constraint that I will consider.\n3.  **Determine the Value of n:** Based on the theorem, I will determine the specific integer value for $n$.\n4.  **Construct Python Code:** I will write a Python script to present the solution. The script will outline the reasoning and print the final value of $n$, along with the equation from the definition of \"n-resolvable\" to satisfy the user's request.\n\n```python\ndef solve_resolvable_functor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the value 'n' for which a tame functor is n-resolvable.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Interpretation of the problem.\n    # The question asks for 'n' where a \"tame functor\" f over an \"upper semilattice\" J is \"n-resolvable\".\n    # - A functor f: J -> Vect_K is a representation of the poset J.\n    # - \"Tame\" is a property of the entire category of representations of J.
