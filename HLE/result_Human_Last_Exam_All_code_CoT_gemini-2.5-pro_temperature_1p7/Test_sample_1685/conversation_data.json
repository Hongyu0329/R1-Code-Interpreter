    "Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution:\n1.  **Analyze the ODE and Initial Conditions:**\n    The given third-order ODE is $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$.\n    The initial conditions are $y(0) = 0$, $y'(0) = 3$, and $y''(0) = 2$.\n    From these, we can calculate the initial value of the third derivative:\n    $y'''(0) = y(0)^{4} + y'(0)^{4} - \\frac{y''(0)}{3(0)^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan(0) + 1} = 0^4 + 3^4 - \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{1}{1} = 81 - 1 + 1 = 81$.\n    The large positive values of the initial derivatives suggest that the solution $y(x)$ grows very rapidly and likely develops a singularity in finite time.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Equation:**\n    For a function that grows rapidly, the terms involving the highest powers of the function and its derivatives will dominate. Let's compare the terms at $x=0$. The term $y'(0)^4 = 81$ is the largest component of $y'''(0)$. This suggests that for the regime where the function grows, the ODE can be approximated by the dominant terms, leading to $y''' \\approx y'^4$. The other terms become negligible in comparison. This \"large x regime\" is interpreted as the region where $x$ approaches the singularity point, causing $y$ and its derivatives to become very large.\n\n3.  **Solve the Simplified Equation:**\n    Let $u = y'$. The simplified equation becomes $u'' = u^4$, which is a second-order nonlinear ODE. The initial conditions for $u$ are $u(0) = y'(0) = 3$ and $u'(0) = y''(0) = 2$.\n    This equation can be integrated once by multiplying by $u'$:\n    $u'u'' = u^4 u' \\implies \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(u')^2\\right) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}u^5\\right)$.\n    Integrating gives $\\frac{1}{2}(u')^2 = \\frac{1}{5}u^5 + K$. We find the constant $K$ using the initial conditions: $K = \\frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - \\frac{1}{5}(3)^5 = 2 - 48.6 = -46.6$.\n\n4.  **Find the Asymptotic Form:**\n    From a dominant balance analysis of $y''' \\approx y'^4$ near the singularity $x_s$, the solution for $y(x)$ has the form:\n    $y(x) \\approx C_0 - C_1(x_s - x)^{1/3}$\n    where $C_1 = 3 \\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n    The constants $x_s$ (the time of the singularity) and $C_0 = y(x_s)$ (the value of y at the singularity) can be found by integrating the expression for $u'$ derived in the previous step.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Constants:**\n    From $\\frac{1}{2}(u')^2 = \\frac{1}{5}u^5 + K$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}u^5 + 2K}$.\n    This allows us to express the singularity time $x_s$ and the constant $C_0$ as integrals with respect to $u$, from its initial value $u(0)=3$ to infinity:\n    $x_s = \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{0.4u^5 + 2K}}$\n    $C_0 = y(x_s) = \\int_0^{x_s} u(t)dt = \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{u \\, du}{\\sqrt{0.4u^5 + 2K}}$\n    These integrals can be computed numerically.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the constants and formulate the final analytical expression.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_ode_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the parameters for the approximate analytical solution\n    to the given ODE in the large x regime (i.e., near its singularity).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define initial conditions for u = y'.\n    # From the problem statement, y'(0) = 3.00 and y''(0) = 2.00.\n    u0 = 3.00\n    u_prime_0 = 2.00\n\n    # Step 2: Use the simplified ODE u'' = u^4 to find the first integral.\n    # 0.5 * (u')^2 = 0.2 * u^5 + K\n    # Calculate the integration constant K using initial conditions u(0) and u'(0).\n    K = 0.5 * u_prime_0**2 - 0.2 * u0**5\n\n    # Step 3: From the integrated equation, u' = sqrt(0.4*u^5 + 2*K).\n    # We can now set up integrals to find the singularity time x_s and the value y(x_s) = C0.\n    \n    # Integrand for calculating x_s, which is the integral of dt = du/u'\n    def integrand_xs(u):\n        value_under_sqrt = 0.4 * u**5 + 2 * K\n        if value_under_sqrt < 0:\n            return 0 # The integration range should not result in this.\n        return 1.0 / np.sqrt(value_under_sqrt)\n\n    # Integrand for calculating C0 = y(x_s).
