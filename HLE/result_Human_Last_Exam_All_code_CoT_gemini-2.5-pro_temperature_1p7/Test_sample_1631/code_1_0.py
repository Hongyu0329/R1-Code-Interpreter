        "The primary scientific basis for adding bypass notches in sheet metal "

        "blank is formed into a complex shape, features like sharp corners or tight "
        "radii can 'lock' the material, preventing it from flowing smoothly into adjacent "
        "areas, such as a deep-drawn cavity. This phenomenon is often called material "
        "starvation.\n\n"
        "This lack of material inflow forces the existing material in the cavity to "
        "stretch excessively, which can lead to critical defects like severe thinning or "
        "fractures (splits). A bypass notch is a strategically placed cut in the blank "
        "that creates a 'shortcut' or a 'bypass' path. It effectively decouples the "
        "stress and strain between the problematic feature (the sharp corner) and the "
        "area that needs material (the deep cavity). This allows the material to flow more "
        "freely where it is needed, ensuring the part can be formed completely and without "
        "failure.\n\n"
        "Therefore, the notches are a direct engineering solution to the problem of "
        "managing material inflow around complex geometric features."
