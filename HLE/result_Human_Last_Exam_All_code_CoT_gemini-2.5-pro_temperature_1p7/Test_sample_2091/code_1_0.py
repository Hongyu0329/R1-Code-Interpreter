    # Line 21 is the third line of the stanza, so it must end with the third word
    # of the pattern, which is 'valleys' (B). It does.
    # However, its main subject is "the music", which is end-word D.
    
    # Line 24 is the sixth line, so it must end with the sixth word
    # of the pattern, 'music' (D). It does.
    # However, its main action is to "fill the vales" (valleys), making its subject
    # 'valleys', which is end-word B.
    
    # The content of the lines is swapped relative to their formal end-word requirement.
    # This is a sophisticated break in the poem's form that preserves the surface-level rhyme scheme.
    # The two lines that have been thematically swapped are therefore 21 and 24.
