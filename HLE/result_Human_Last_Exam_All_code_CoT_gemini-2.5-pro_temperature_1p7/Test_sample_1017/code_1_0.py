# Step 1: Define the rotation numbers from the problem statement.
# g is translation by 2/27, so its rotation number rho_g is 2/27.
# h is translation by 16/27, so its rotation number rho_h is 16/27.
rho_g = Fraction(2, 27)
rho_h = Fraction(16, 27)

# Step 2: Apply the formula for the stable commutator length (scl) of an element g1*h2
# in a free product G1 * G2.
# The formula is scl(g1*h2) = (1/2) * |rho_g + rho_h|.
# This comes from a minimization problem: (1/2) * inf_theta(|rho_g - theta| + |rho_h + theta|).
# The minimum value of |a - x| + |b - x| is |a - b|. In our case, this corresponds to
# |rho_g - (-rho_h)| = |rho_g + rho_h|.

# Step 3: Calculate the sum of the rotation numbers.
sum_of_rhos = rho_g + rho_h

# Step 4: Calculate the stable commutator length.
scl_value = Fraction(1, 2) * abs(sum_of_rhos)

# Step 5: Print the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.
# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
print(f"The stable commutator length is calculated using the formula:")
print(f"scl(g1*h2) = 1/2 * |rho(g) + rho(h)|")
print(f"Plugging in the values:")
print(f"scl = 1/2 * |{rho_g} + {rho_h}|")
print(f"scl = 1/2 * |{sum_of_rhos}|")
