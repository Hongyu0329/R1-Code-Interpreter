    # Part a)
    # A string starter P with bi-degree (a, b) that satisfies FP=0 is a highest-weight vector.
    # The weight is given by the eigenvalue of H = deg_x - deg_y, which is h = a - b.
    # The given starter has bi-degree (a, b) = (4, 3), so its weight is h = 4 - 3 = 1.
    # A full sl(2) string is symmetric, containing states with weights from h down to -h.
    # For h=1, the weights are 1 and -1. The string has two polynomials.
    # The lowering operator E transforms a polynomial of bi-degree (d_x, d_y) to (d_x - 1, d_y + 1).
    # The string starts with P of bi-degree (4, 3).

    # A polynomial of bi-degree (a, b) can be a valid string starter if it's a highest-weight
    # vector of a finite-dimensional sl(2) representation.

    # Thus, the necessary condition is a - b >= 0.

    # Part c)
    # The notation E_{r, d} for operators that construct basis polynomials for DH_n
    # usually has d corresponding to the degree of y-variables.
    # Therefore, an operator E_{r, 0} would not introduce or increase the degree in y.
    # If we assume construction begins from a polynomial with y-degree 0 (like the constant 1),
    # it is impossible to generate a polynomial with a non-zero y-degree, such as 2.
