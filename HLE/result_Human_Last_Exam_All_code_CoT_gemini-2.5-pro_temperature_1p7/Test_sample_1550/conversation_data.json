    "To find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics, we will solve the system of two quadratic equations. A direct analytical solution is very complex. Instead, we will use a method from algebraic geometry involving a \"pencil of conics\".\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Represent the two conics as `C1 = 0` and `C2 = 0`.\n2.  Consider the pencil of conics, which is the set of all conics `C1 + k*C2 = 0` for some parameter `k`. Any intersection point of `C1` and `C2` is also on every conic in the pencil.\n3.  We will find a specific `k` for which the conic `C1 + k*C2` is of a simpler form, a parabola. A conic `Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + ... = 0` is a parabola if its discriminant `B^2 - 4AC` is zero. This will give us a quadratic equation for `k`.\n4.  By solving for `k`, we find a value that simplifies the problem significantly. It turns out that for a specific `k`, the parabola is a degenerate one, consisting of two parallel lines.\n5.  The intersection points of `C1` and `C2` must lie on these two lines.\n6.  We will then find the intersection points of the first conic `C1` with each of these two lines.\n7.  Each intersection of an ellipse (`C1` is an ellipse) and a line results in a quadratic equation. We solve these two quadratic equations.\n8.  The total number of real roots from these two quadratic equations gives the total number of real intersection points.\n\nWe will use Python's `fractions` module to perform exact rational arithmetic to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of real intersection points between two conics.\n    C1: 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\n    C2: 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coefficients of the conics C1 and C2 as Fractions\n    C1_coeffs = {'A': Fraction(164), 'B': Fraction(-216), 'C': Fraction(72),\n                 'D': Fraction(-16), 'E': Fraction(0), 'F': Fraction(31)}\n    C2_coeffs = {'A': Fraction(864), 'B': Fraction(-1056), 'C': Fraction(324),\n                 'D': Fraction(-560), 'E': Fraction(324), 'F': Fraction(149)}\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Find a k that makes C1 + k*C2 a parabola.\")\n    print(\"A conic Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + ... = 0 is a parabola if B^2 - 4AC = 0.\")\n    print(\"For the pencil C1 + k*C2, the coefficients are:\")\n    print(\"A(k) = 164 + 864k\")\n    print(\"B(k) = -216 - 1056k\")\n    print(\"C(k) = 72 + 324k\")\n    print(\"\\nThe condition B(k)^2 - 4A(k)C(k) = 0 gives a quadratic equation in k.\")\n    \n    # Symbolic expansion of B(k)^2 - 4A(k)C(k)\n    # (-216 - 1056k)^2 - 4(164 + 864k)(72 + 324k)\n    # (46656 + 456192k + 1115136k^2) - 4(11808 + 115344k + 279936k^2)\n    # 46656 - 47232 + (456192 - 461376)k + (1115136 - 1119744)k^2\n    # -576 - 5184k - 4608k^2 = 0\n    # Dividing by -576 gives: 1 + 9k + 8k^2 = 0\n    \n    k_eq_a = Fraction(8)\n    k_eq_b = Fraction(9)\n    k_eq_c = Fraction(1)\n    \n    print(f\"The equation for k is: {int(k_eq_a)}*k^2 + {int(k_eq_b)}*k + {int(k_eq_c)} = 0\")\n    print(\"Factoring gives: (8k + 1)(k + 1) = 0\")\n    \n    k1 = Fraction(-1, 8)\n    k2 = Fraction(-1)\n    print(f\"The solutions for k are k = {k1} and k = {k2}.\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Step 2: Choose k = {k1} and form the conic 8*C1 - C2 = 0.\")\n    k = k1\n    \n    # 8*C1 - C2\n    coeffs = {key: 8 * C1_coeffs[key] - C2_coeffs[key] for key in C1_coeffs}\n    \n    print(\"The equation of the resulting parabola P is:\")\n    print(f\"{int(coeffs['A'])}*x^2 + {int(coeffs['B'])}*x*y + {int(coeffs['C'])}*y^2 + {int(coeffs['D'])}*x + {int(coeffs['E'])}*y + {int(coeffs['F'])} = 0\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe quadratic part is 448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 = 28 * (16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28 * (4x - 3y)^2.\")\n    print(\"The linear part is 432x - 324y = 108 * (4x - 3y).\")\n    print(\"Let u = 4x - 3y.
