    "To find the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we need to analyze how the number of basic operations scales with the size of the input `n`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Complexity Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Basic Operations:** The algorithm consists of assignments (`:=`), integer division (`⌊x/c⌋`), multiplication (`qc`), and subtraction (`x - qc`). We assume that each of these elementary operations takes a constant amount of time, denoted as O(1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Algorithm's Structure:** The algorithm has two main parts: an initialization step and a `while` loop.\n    *   **Initialization (Step 1):** This step involves a fixed number of basic operations regardless of the size of `n`. Therefore, its time complexity is constant, O(1).\n    *   **The `while` loop (Step 2):** The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. The overall complexity of the algorithm will be dominated by the number of times this loop executes.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Loop Iterations:** Let's trace the variable `q` that controls the loop.\n    *   Before the loop, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   Inside each loop iteration, the value of `x` is set to the current `q`, and then `q` is updated to `⌊x/c⌋`. This means that in every iteration, the value of `q` is divided by the base `c`.\n    *   The loop will terminate when `q` becomes 0. The number of times you can divide a number `n` by a base `c` before the result becomes 0 is logarithmically related to `n`.\n    *   Specifically, the number of iterations is equal to the number of digits of `n` in base `c`, minus one. The number of digits of `n` in base `c` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. So the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times (for n > 0).\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Complexity:** The total time complexity is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the complexity of the work done inside the loop.\n    *   **Work per iteration:** Inside the loop (step 2.1), we perform a few assignments and arithmetic operations. This takes constant time, O(1).\n    *   **Total Time:** `(Number of Iterations) × (Work per Iteration)` = `O(log_c(n)) × O(1)` = `O(log_c(n))`.\n\nTherefore, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log_c(n))`. The following Python script demonstrates this relationship with a concrete example.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef explain_and_demonstrate_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the algorithm's complexity with a concrete example\n    and prints the final analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
