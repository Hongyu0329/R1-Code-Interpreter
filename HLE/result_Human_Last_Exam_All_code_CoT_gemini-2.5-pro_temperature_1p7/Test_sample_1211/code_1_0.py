# Analysis of each statement:
# Statement I: Plausible. The risk of precipitated withdrawal upon injection is a safety issue for the user,
# even though it's an intended abuse-deterrent feature.
# Statement II: Correct. Subutex (buprenorphine-only) is preferred for specific populations like pregnant women.
# Statement III: Correct. When taken as prescribed, their safety profiles are similar due to the primary role of
# buprenorphine and low bioavailability of sublingual naloxone.
# Statement IV: Incorrect. The relative safety and use cases are well-established in clinical practice.
# Statement V: Incorrect. It contains a major factual error, stating Suboxone's abuse deterrence is due to a "lack of naloxone"
# when it is due to its presence.

# Based on the analysis, statements I, II, and III are the ones supported by evidence.
