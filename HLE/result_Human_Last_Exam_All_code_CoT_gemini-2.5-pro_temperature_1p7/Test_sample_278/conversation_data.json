    "My plan is to determine the extents of the given parametric curve to find the dimensions of the smallest rectangle that can enclose it, known as the bounding box. The side length of the smallest square that can outcircle this figure will be the larger of the two dimensions (width and height) of this bounding box.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Analyze the first part of the curve:** For `t` in `[0, π]`, the curve is `x = cos(t)` and `y = sin(t)`. In this interval, `x` ranges from -1 to 1, and `y` ranges from 0 to 1.\n2.  **Analyze the second part of the curve:** For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, the curve is `x = cos(t)` and `y = 5 * sin(t)`. In this interval, `x` ranges from -1 to 1, and `y` ranges from -5 to 0.\n3.  **Determine the overall bounding box:** By combining the ranges from both parts, the overall `x` range for the figure is `[-1, 1]`, and the overall `y` range is `[-5, 1]`.\n4.  **Calculate the dimensions:** The total width of the figure is `max(x) - min(x) = 1 - (-1) = 2`. The total height is `max(y) - min(y) = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n5.  **Find the side of the smallest enclosing square:** The side length of the smallest square that outcircles the figure must be equal to the maximum of its width and height. So, the side length is `max(2, 6) = 6`.\n6.  **Calculate the area:** The area of this square is `side * side = 6 * 6 = 36`.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to calculate the final area.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given parametric curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Part 1: t in [0, pi], x = cos(t), y = sin(t)\n    # x range is [-1, 1]\n    # y range is [0, 1]\n    x_min_1 = -1\n    x_max_1 = 1\n    y_min_1 = 0\n    y_max_1 = 1\n\n    # Part 2: t in (pi, 2pi), x = cos(t), y = 5*sin(t)\n    # x range is [-1, 1]\n    # y range is [-5, 0)\n    x_min_2 = -1\n    x_max_2 = 1\n    y_min_2 = -5\n    y_max_2 = 0\n\n    # Overall range for the figure\n    overall_x_min = min(x_min_1, x_min_2)\n    overall_x_max = max(x_max_1, x_max_2)\n    overall_y_min = min(y_min_1, y_min_2)\n    overall_y_max = max(y_max_1, y_max_2)\n\n    # Calculate the width and height of the bounding box\n    width = overall_x_max - overall_x_min\n    height = overall_y_max - overall_y_min\n\n    # The side of the smallest square that outcircles the figure is the max of width and height\n    side_length = max(width, height)\n\n    # Calculate the area of the square\n    area = side_length ** 2\n\n    print(f\"The total width of the figure is: {overall_x_max} - ({overall_x_min}) = {width}\")\n    print(f\"The total height of the figure is: {overall_y_max} - ({overall_y_min}) = {height}\")\n    print(f\"The side length of the smallest outcircling square is the maximum of the width and height: {side_length}\")\n    print(f\"The area of the square is {int(side_length)} * {int(side_length)} = {int(area)}\")\n\nsolve_area()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
