    "Here is a breakdown of the metabolic fate of the labeled carbons from 1,4-13C glucose during glycolysis.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Labeled Carbons:** Start with a 6-carbon glucose molecule where the C1 and C4 positions are labeled with the 13C isotope.\n2.  **Trace Carbons through Glycolysis:** Follow the labeled carbons through the key steps of glycolysis:\n    *   The cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two 3-carbon molecules (DHAP and G3P).\n    *   The isomerization of DHAP into a second molecule of G3P.\n    *   The conversion of the two G3P molecules into two pyruvate molecules.\n3.  **Analyze CO2 Production:** Examine the overall reaction of glycolysis (glucose -> 2 pyruvate) to determine if any CO2 is released.\n4.  **Count Labeled CO2:** Based on the analysis, count how many of the released CO2 molecules would contain the 13C label.\n5.  **Construct the Final Equation:** Display the result in a simple equation format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_glycolysis_labeling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces 13C labels from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis to determine\n    the number of labeled CO2 molecules produced.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Trace the labels from Glucose to Pyruvate ---\n    print(\"This script traces the path of labeled carbons from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Initial state: Glucose is a 6-carbon molecule.\n    # We represent it as a list where the index corresponds to the carbon number (1-based).\n    # '13C' indicates a labeled carbon, '12C' is a standard carbon.\n    glucose = ['13C', '12C', '12C', '13C', '12C', '12C']\n    print(f\"Starting molecule: 1,4-13C glucose.
