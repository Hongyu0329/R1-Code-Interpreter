    # Step 1: Define the derivatives of the component functions.
    # x'(t) = pi * cos(pi * t)
    # y'(t) = cos(t)
    # z'(t) = -2 * sin(2t)
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the condition for the tangent vector to be zero.
    # The tangent vector r'(t) = (x'(t), y'(t), z'(t)) is zero if and only if
    # its squared magnitude is zero.
    # |r'(t)|^2 = (pi * cos(pi*t))^2 + (cos(t))^2 + (-2 * sin(2t))^2 = 0
    
    # This requires all three terms to be zero simultaneously:
    # 1. cos(pi * t) = 0  => t = k + 0.5 for integer k
    # 2. cos(t) = 0      => t = m*pi + pi/2 for integer m
    # 3. sin(2t) = 0      => t = n*pi/2 for integer n
    
    # Step 3: Show that the conditions can't be met simultaneously.
    # For conditions 1 and 2 to hold for the same t:
    # k + 0.5 = m*pi + pi/2
    # k = m*pi
    # Since k and m are integers and pi is irrational, this is only possible
    # if k=0 and m=0.
    # If k=0, t = 0.5.
    # If m=0, t = pi/2.
    # As 0.5 is not equal to pi/2, the first two derivatives are never zero at the same time.
    
    # Step 4: Conclude.
    # The tangent vector is never zero, so the curve is regular.
    # The Hausdorff dimension of a smooth, regular curve is its topological dimension.
