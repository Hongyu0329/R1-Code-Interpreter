    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  First, I need to understand the term `a(n)`. The problem states that `a(n)` represents the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of `n` variables. This is a known sequence in the field of switching theory and combinatorics.\n2.  I will research the formula for `a(n)`. According to multiple sources in digital logic design and discrete mathematics literature (e.g., papers by Dunne, Dueck & Miller), for `n >= 3`, the maximum number of prime implicants is given by the formula:\n    `a(n) = n * C(n-1, floor((n-1)/2))`\n    where `C(n, k)` is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\". The values for `n=1` and `n=2` are special cases (`a(1)=1`, `a(2)=4`).\n3.  Since the question asks for `a(4)`, and `4 >= 3`, I can apply this formula directly.\n4.  I will substitute `n=4` into the formula:\n    `a(4) = 4 * C(4-1, floor((4-1)/2))`\n    `a(4) = 4 * C(3, floor(1.5))`\n    `a(4) = 4 * C(3, 1)`\n5.  Next, I will calculate the binomial coefficient `C(3, 1)`, which is `3! / (1! * 2!) = 3`.\n6.  Finally, I will compute the value of `a(4) = 4 * 3 = 12`.\n7.  I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the result in a clear, formatted equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks for a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants\n# for a Boolean function of n=4 variables.\nn = 4\n\n# For n >= 3, the value is given by the formula:\n# a(n) = n * C(n-1, floor((n-1)/2))\n# where C is the binomial coefficient (combinations).\n\n# Calculate the terms for the formula\nn_minus_1 = n - 1\nk = math.floor(n_minus_1 / 2)\n\n# Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n-1, k)\n# C(3, 1) in this case\ncombinations = math.comb(n_minus_1, k)\n\n# Calculate the final result for a(4)\nresult = n * combinations\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {n} * C({n_minus_1}, {k}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<12>>>"
