    Solves the given boundary value problem.
    
    The solution follows these steps:
    1. The system is x_{n+1} = A*x_n + b, where A is a rotation matrix for 2*pi/3.
    2. It can be shown that A^3 = I and I + A + A^2 = 0. This makes the sequence x_n 3-periodic, so x_{n+3} = x_n.
    3. The value to find is for n = 10^15. Since 10^15 % 3 == 1, we evaluate the expression at n=1.
    4. The boundary condition x_{2025}^2 = 10^20 simplifies. Since 2025 % 3 == 0, x_{2025} = x_0, so x_0^2 = 10^20.
    5. The expression for n=1, Q_1 = (x_1^1 - (3*r/ (2*math.pi)) * sin(2*math.pi/3))^2 + (x_1^2)^2, simplifies to (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.
       This is because x_1 = A*x_0 + b, and the term subtracted is the first component of b.
       The calculation becomes ||A*x_0||^2, which equals ||x_0||^2 because A is orthogonal.
    6. The boundary condition -2/3*x_1^1 - 2/sqrt(3)*x_1^2 + sqrt(3)/(2*pi) = 0 is used to find x_0^1.
       When expanded, it yields a relation between x_0^1, x_0^2, and r.
    7. As stated, the problem is underdetermined because the final value depends on r.
       We assume a typo in the constant term of the boundary condition, changing it from sqrt(3)/(2*pi) to sqrt(3)*r/(2*pi).
       This is a common issue and makes the problem solvable with a unique answer.
    8. With this correction, the condition becomes -2/3*x_1^1 - 2/sqrt(3)*x_1^2 + sqrt(3)*r/(2*pi) = 0, which leads to x_0^1 = sqrt(3)*x_0^2, a relation independent of r.
    9. With x_0^2 = 10^20, we can find x_0^1 and the final result.
