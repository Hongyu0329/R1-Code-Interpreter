# The riddle describes a historical figure based on their most famous work.
# The work contains a "prohibition against representation" (the Second Commandment).
# The end of the work addresses "another's material possessions" (the Tenth Commandment against coveting).
# These two points strongly identify the work as the Ten Commandments, or the Decalogue.
# According to the Abrahamic religions, the prophet who received and delivered these laws was Moses.

# The riddle's line about "ignoring the prohibition against representation" when discussing possessions
# is a philosophical or literary interpretation of the text, likely pointing out that
# the text must *name* (and thus linguistically represent) the possessions one must not covet.
