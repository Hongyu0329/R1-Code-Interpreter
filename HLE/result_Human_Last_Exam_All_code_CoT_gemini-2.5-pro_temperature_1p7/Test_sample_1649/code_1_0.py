    print("Step 1: Understanding the problem and the definition of the limit.")
    print("The problem asks for the minimum possible size of the limit of a diagram F, where F is a functor from J^op to the category of sets.")
    print("The given conditions are:")
    print("  - J is a directed poset (every finite subset has an upper bound).")
    print("  - For every object j in J, the set F(j) is non-empty.")
    print("  - For every morphism i <= j in J, the map f_ij: F(j) -> F(i) is surjective.")
    print("\nThe limit of this diagram, lim_{J^op}F, is the set of all 'coherent families' of elements:")
    print("  lim F = { (x_j)_{j in J} | x_j is in F(j), and for all i <= j, f_ij(x_j) = x_i }")

    print("\nStep 2: Establishing a lower bound for the size of the limit.")
    print("A fundamental theorem in set theory and category theory (related to the Mittag-Leffler condition) states that the limit of a diagram of non-empty sets indexed by a directed set with surjective maps is always non-empty.")
    print("Since the conditions of the problem match this theorem exactly, we can conclude that the set lim_{J^op}F cannot be empty.")
    print("Therefore, the size of the limit must be at least 1.")

    print("\nStep 3: Constructing an example to show the lower bound is achievable.")
    print("To show that 1 is the smallest possible size, we must construct a valid J and F for which the limit's size is exactly 1.")
    print("Let's choose a simple directed poset, J, such as the natural numbers with their usual order: J = (N, <=), where N = {0, 1, 2, ...}.")
    print("\nNow, let's define the functor F:")
    print("  - For each object n in J, define the set F(n) to be a singleton set, for example, F(n) = {0}.")
    print("    This satisfies the non-empty condition.")
    print("  - For each morphism m <= n in J, we need a surjective map f_mn: F(n) -> F(m).")
    print("    Since F(n) = {0} and F(m) = {0}, there is only one possible function: the map that sends 0 to 0.")
    print("    This map is surjective because its image is {0}, which is the entire codomain F(m).")
    print("    The functoriality condition (f_lk = f_lm o f_mk for l<=m<=k) also holds, as composing these unique maps gives the unique map.")

    print("\nStep 4: Calculating the size of the limit for our example.")
    print("An element in the limit is a sequence (x_0, x_1, x_2, ...) satisfying:")
    print("  1. x_n is in F(n) for all n.")
    print("  2. f_mn(x_n) = x_m for all m <= n.")
    print("\nFrom condition (1), since F(n) = {0} for every n, the only choice for each element of the sequence is x_n = 0.")
    print("This means the only possible element in the limit is the constant sequence (0, 0, 0, ...).")
    print("\nLet's verify this sequence against condition (2): f_mn(x_n) = x_m.")
    print("Substituting the values, we need to check if f_mn(0) = 0.")
    print("By our definition of the maps, this is true for all m <= n.")
    print("Thus, the sequence (0, 0, 0, ...) is indeed a valid coherent family, and it is the only one.")
    print("The limit set contains exactly one element.")
    
    print("\nStep 5: Final Conclusion.")
    print("We have established that the size of the limit is always at least 1, and we have constructed a valid case where the size is exactly 1.")

    print(f"Therefore, the smallest possible size of the set lim_{J^op}F is {smallest_possible_size}.")
