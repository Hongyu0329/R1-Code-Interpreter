    Analyzes the Go puzzle to find the killing moves for White.

    The analysis is as follows:
    1. The black stones form three groups: {A2}, {B3, B4}, {C1, C2}.
    2. The vital point B2 is a shared liberty for all three groups.
    3. A move at B2 by White puts the {C1, C2} group in atari, leading to a sequence that captures all black stones.
    4. A move at A3 by White also leads to a killing sequence by restricting liberties and preventing Black from forming two eyes after connecting.
    5. Other moves like A1, B1, or A4 allow Black to connect at B2 and live.
    6. Therefore, the killing moves are A3 and B2.
