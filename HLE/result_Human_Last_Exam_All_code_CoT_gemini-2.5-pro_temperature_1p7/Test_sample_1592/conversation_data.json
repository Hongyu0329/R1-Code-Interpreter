    "To determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec, excluding Quebec itself, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I will find the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of Waskaganish.\n2.  Next, I will identify the neighboring provinces and territories. The most likely candidates for the closest are Ontario (which shares a land border) and Nunavut (which includes the islands in James Bay, very near Waskaganish).\n3.  I will then find the coordinates of a representative point in each of these candidate regions. I'll use Moosonee for Ontario, as it's a notable town near the Quebec border, and the southern tip of Akimiski Island for Nunavut, as it's the nearest landmass in that territory.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script to calculate the great-circle distance between Waskaganish and these selected points using the `geopy` library. The location with the shortest distance will indicate the closest province or territory.\n\n```python\nfrom geopy.distance import geodesic\nimport operator\n\n# Geographic coordinates for the locations\n# Waskaganish, QC is our starting point\nwaskaganish_coords = (51.1947, -78.7611)\n\n# Representative points for neighboring provinces/territories\nlocations = {\n    \"Ontario\": (51.2731, -80.6471),        # Moosonee, ON\n    \"Nunavut\": (52.41, -80.85),            # Southernmost tip of Akimiski Island, NU\n    \"Newfoundland and Labrador\": (52.9366, -66.8788) # Wabush, NL\n}\n\n# Dictionary to store the calculated distances\ndistances = {}\n\nprint(f\"Calculating distances from Waskaganish, QC {waskaganish_coords} to neighboring regions:\\n\")\n\n# Calculate the distance to each location\nfor province, coords in locations.items():\n    distance = geodesic(waskaganish_coords, coords).km\n    distances[province] = distance\n    print(f\"Distance to {province} (via {coords}): {distance:.2f} km\")\n\n# Find the location with the minimum distance\nclosest_province = min(distances.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is {closest_province[0]}.\")\n\n<<<Ontario>>>\n```"
