    "Of course, I can help with that. To solve this problem, we will use the principle of duality. The goal is to transform the given discrete-time system into its observer canonical form. The structure of this canonical form, specifically the new output matrix `C_new`, is determined by the system's observability indices.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand Duality**: The observability of a system `(A, C)` is equivalent to the controllability of its dual system `(Aᵀ, Cᵀ)`. We can find the observability indices of the original system, which are the same as the controllability indices of the dual system.\n2.  **Calculate Observability Indices (`μ_i`)**: These indices are found by examining the rows of the observability matrix `W_o = [C; CA; CA²; ...]`. We search for the first `n` (where `n` is the state dimension, here `n=3`) linearly independent rows in the sequence `c_1, c_2, ..., c_1 A, c_2 A, ...`, where `c_i` are the rows of `C`. The observability index `μ_i` is the number of rows associated with the original `c_i` that appear in this set of `n` linearly independent rows.\n3.  **Construct New C Matrix**: Once the observability indices `(μ_1, μ_2, ...)` are determined, the new output matrix in observer canonical form, `C_new`, has a standard structure composed of rows from the identity matrix. Specifically, the `k`-th row of `C_new` is a unit vector `e_j` where the position `j` is determined by the indices `μ`.\n4.  **Implement in Python**: Write a Python script to perform these calculations and construct the final `C_new` matrix. The script will also display the resulting system equation `y(k) = C_new * z(k)`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the transformation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_observer_canonical_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reduces a discrete-time system to observer canonical form and finds the new C matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the original system matrices\n    A = np.array([[1, 1, 0],\n                  [2, 1, 1],\n                  [0, 2, 0]])\n\n    C = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n                  [1, 1, 0]])\n\n    n = A.shape[0]  # State dimension\n    q = C.shape[0]  # Output dimension\n\n    print(\"Original A matrix:\\n\", A)\n    print(\"\\nOriginal C matrix:\\n\", C)\n\n    # Step 1: Find the observability indices (μ_i)\n    # We find the first n linearly independent rows from the sequence:\n    # c1, c2, c1*A, c2*A, c1*A^2, ...\n    \n    linearly_independent_rows = []\n    # indices_count will store the observability indices [μ_1, μ_2, ...]\n    indices_count = [0] * q  \n    \n    # Generate the sequence of rows to check for linear independence\n    rows_to_check = []\n    k = 0\n    # We only need to check up to A^(n-1) in the worst case\n    while len(linearly_independent_rows) < n and k < n:\n        for i in range(q):\n            # Calculate c_i * A^k\n            row = C[i, :] @ np.linalg.matrix_power(A, k)\n            \n            # Check if this new row is linearly independent of the ones we've already found\n            # Create a temporary matrix with the current set of LI rows plus the new one\n            temp_matrix = np.vstack(linearly_independent_rows + [row]) if linearly_independent_rows else np.array([row])\n\n            # If the rank increases, the new row is linearly independent\n            if np.linalg.matrix_rank(temp_matrix) == len(linearly_independent_rows) + 1:\n                linearly_independent_rows.append(row)\n                indices_count[i] += 1\n                if len(linearly_independent_rows) == n:\n                    break\n        if len(linearly_independent_rows) == n:\n            break\n        k += 1\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculated observability indices (μ_1, μ_2):\", indices_count)\n\n    # Step 2: Construct the new C matrix (C_new) based on the observability indices\n    C_new = np.zeros((q, n))\n    \n    # The positions of the '1's in C_new are determined by the indices\n    # Row k of C_new is e_j, where j = 1 + sum of preceding indices\n    current_row_index_in_identity = 1\n    for i in range(q):\n        # The i-th row of C_new is the (current_row_index_in_identity)-th row of the Identity matrix\n        C_new[i, current_row_index_in_identity - 1] = 1\n        # The next '1' will be placed after μ_i positions\n        current_row_index_in_identity += indices_count[i]\n\n    print(\"\\nThe new matrix C in observer canonical form is:\")\n    print(C_new)\n\n    # Step 3: Display the final equation y(k) = C_new * z(k)\n    print(\"\\nThe new system output equation is y(k) = C_new * z(k), where z(k) is the new state vector.\")\n    print(\"The individual output equations are:\")\n    for i in range(q):\n        equation_terms = []\n        for j in range(n):\n            # Format the term for the equation\n            term = f\"{int(C_new[i, j])}*z_{j+1}(k)\"\n            equation_terms.append(term)\n        equation_str = f\"y_{i+1}(k) = {' + '.join(equation_terms)}\"\n        print(equation_str)\n        \n    return C_new\n\n# Run the function\nfinal_C = solve_observer_canonical_form()\n# The final answer format is specified by the problem.\n# Let's provide the final matrix as a nested list string.\n#<<<[[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]>>>\nfinal_C_str = np.array2string(final_C, separator=', ', formatter={'float_kind':lambda x: \"%.1f\" % x})\n# Output in the required format\n#<<<[[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]>>>\nprint(f\"\\n<<<{final_C.tolist()}>>>\")\n\n```"
