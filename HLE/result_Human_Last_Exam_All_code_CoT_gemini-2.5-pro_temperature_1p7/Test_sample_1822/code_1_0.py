# Step 1: Define the variables based on the problem description.
# c: Confidence of the discriminatory pattern P in subgraph G.
c = 0.85
# s: Support of the discriminatory pattern P in subgraph G.
s = 0.12
# c_prime: Confidence of the anti-correlated pattern in the 2-hop neighborhood.
c_prime = 0.78
# beta: Bottleneck coefficient based on the hourglass structural principle.
beta = 0.23

# Step 2: Formulate and calculate the evidence for and against the violation.
# The evidence for the violation is the product of the pattern's confidence and support.
evidence_for_violation = c * s

# The counter-evidence is the confidence of the anti-correlation, weighted by the
# bottleneck coefficient, which explains structural anomalies.
counter_evidence = c_prime * beta

# Step 3: Calculate the minimum evidence ratio (E_r).
# This ratio compares the strength of the initial evidence to the counter-evidence.
evidence_ratio = evidence_for_violation / counter_evidence

# Step 4: Print the reasoning, the equation, and the final result.
print("To determine the minimum ratio of evidence (E_r), we compare the strength of the evidence for the violation against the strength of the counter-evidence.")
