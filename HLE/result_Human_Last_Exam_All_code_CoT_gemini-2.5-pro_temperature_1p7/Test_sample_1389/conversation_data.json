    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the efficacy measured by `1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)` is an accurate reflection of its per-exposure efficacy. Here is a step-by-step explanation and a Python script to demonstrate why.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Model the Vaccine:** We'll define an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine. In this model, a certain percentage (`v`) of vaccinated individuals receive 100% protection, while the rest (`1-v`) receive no protection at all. This value `v` is the true *per-exposure vaccine efficacy* (`VE_p`).\n2.  **Define Incidence Rates:** We will assume a baseline incidence rate for the unvaccinated population (`IR_u`). Based on our vaccine model, we will then calculate the expected incidence rate for the vaccinated population (`IR_v`). Since only the proportion `1-v` of the vaccinated group is susceptible, `IR_v` will be equal to `IR_u * (1-v)`.\n3.  **Calculate `1 - IRR`:** Using these two incidence rates, we will compute the Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR = IR_v / IR_u`). Then, we'll calculate the vaccine efficacy from this ratio (`VE_IRR = 1 - IRR`).\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** Finally, we will compare the calculated `VE_IRR` with the true per-exposure efficacy `v` to see if it overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates it.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan.\n\n```python\n# 1. Define parameters for our model.\n# Let's assume the vaccine provides perfect protection to 90% of recipients.\n# This means the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE_p) is 0.90.\nper_exposure_VE = 0.90\n\n# Let's assume an incidence rate in the unvaccinated group, e.g., 10 cases per 100 person-years.\nIR_u = 0.10\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Define initial assumptions for an 'all-or-nothing' vaccine.\")\nprint(f\"True Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (v): {per_exposure_VE}\")\nprint(f\"Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated Population (IR_u): {IR_u}\\n\")\n\n# 2. Calculate the theoretical incidence rate in the vaccinated population (IR_v).\n# In an all-or-nothing model, only the proportion (1 - v) of vaccinated people\n# can get infected. Their rate of infection is the same as the unvaccinated.\n# The other proportion (v) has a rate of 0.\n# So, the overall rate is: IR_v = IR_u * (1 - v)\nIR_v = IR_u * (1 - per_exposure_VE)\n\nprint(\"Step 2: Calculate the expected incidence rate in the vaccinated population (IR_v).\")\nprint(f\"IR_v = IR_u * (1 - v)\")\nprint(f\"IR_v = {IR_u} * (1 - {per_exposure_VE}) = {IR_v:.4f}\\n\")\n\n\n# 3. Calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) and the VE based on it.\nIRR = IR_v / IR_u\nVE_from_IRR = 1 - IRR\n\nprint(\"Step 3: Calculate the Vaccine Efficacy using the 1 - IRR formula.\")\nprint(\"Equation: VE = 1 - (IR_v / IR_u)\")\nprint(f\"Final calculation: VE = 1 - ({IR_v:.4f} / {IR_u}) = {VE_from_IRR:.4f}\\n\")\n\n\n# 4. Compare the result with the true per-exposure efficacy.\nprint(\"Step 4: Compare the calculated VE with the true per-exposure VE.\")\nprint(f\"True Per-Exposure VE (v) = {per_exposure_VE}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated VE from (1 - IRR) = {VE_from_IRR:.4f}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Conclusion:\")\nprint(\"The calculated value is identical to the true value.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, 1 - IRR correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\")\n\n<<<C>>>\n```"
