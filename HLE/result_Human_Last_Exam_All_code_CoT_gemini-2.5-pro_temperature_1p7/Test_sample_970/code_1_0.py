# The problem asks for the necessary assumption to prove that a Bayesian agent's
# expected information gain converges to zero over time.

# The expected information gain at time t is E[KL(posterior_t+1 || posterior_t)].
# The total expected information gain is the sum of these terms over all time steps.
# This total sum is equal to the mutual information between the model parameters (M)
# and the entire stream of observations (O), I(M; O).
# A fundamental property of information theory is that mutual information is bounded
# by the entropy of the variables, so I(M; O) <= H(M), where H(M) is the entropy
# of the prior distribution over models.

# If the prior has finite entropy (Assumption a), then the total information that can
# be gained is finite. For an infinite sum of non-negative terms to converge to a
# finite value, the terms must approach zero. Therefore, the expected information
# gain at each step must converge to zero.

# The other options are not necessary:
# b: Restricts the environment type, but the principle is more general.
# c: Restricts the agent's policy, but the posterior can converge even if the policy cycles.
# d: i.i.d. is a strong simplification, violated in the general RL case.
# e: Requires the posterior to converge to a point-mass, which is stronger than needed.
#    The posterior only needs to stop changing.

# Therefore, the only necessary assumption is (a).

# Now, we format this answer in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) as requested.
# A single literal 'a' is a clause '(a)'.
# The conjunction of a single clause is enclosed in brackets '[...]'.
# The final format is '[(a)]'.

# This script will print the final answer in the required format.
# Note: The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation. As there are no
# numerical equations in this conceptual problem, this part of the instruction is not applicable.
# We will just print the final answer in CNF.
final_answer_cnf = "[(a)]"
