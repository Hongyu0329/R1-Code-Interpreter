    "Of course. Here is the Python code that derives and presents the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas), following the principles of statistical mechanics which are formalized by large deviation theorems like Boltzmann-Sanov.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Principle**: The equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the macrostate with the highest number of microscopic realizations (`W`), and therefore the highest entropy (`S = k_B * ln(W)`). Large deviation theorems explain why observing any other state is exponentially unlikely for a large number of particles. Our goal is to find the particle distribution `n_i` over energy levels `ε_i` that maximizes `S` subject to a fixed total energy `E`.\n2.  **Formulate Entropy**: Write the expression for the entropy of bosons using Stirling's approximation for large numbers of particles.\n3.  **Maximization**: Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize the entropy subject to the energy constraint. This will yield the equilibrium distribution of photons, which is the Bose-Einstein distribution.\n4.  **Calculate Mean Energy**: Substitute the equilibrium distribution into the formula for total energy `E = Σ n_i * ε_i`. Then, by moving to a continuous spectrum using the density of states for photons, integrate to find the total energy `E_eq`. This results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy.\n5.  **Calculate Entropy**: Use the derived mean energy and the fundamental thermodynamic relation `S = (4/3)E/T` for a photon gas to find the equilibrium entropy `S_eq`.\n6.  **Present Results**: The Python script will print this derivation step-by-step and then display the final equations for `E_eq` and `S_eq`, explicitly printing out each numerical constant in the formulas as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_bose_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and prints the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy\n    for the Bose case of light quanta (photon gas).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"### Derivation of Equilibrium Energy and Entropy for a Photon Gas ###\")\n    print(\"\\nThis script outlines the derivation based on the principles of statistical mechanics.\")\n    print(\"The core idea is to find the most probable distribution of particles over energy states,\")\n    print(\"which is the one that maximizes the entropy S for a given total energy E.\")\n    print(\"This approach, the method of most probable distribution, is rigorously justified by\")\n    print(\"large deviation theorems like the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Entropy and Maximization ---\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Bose-Einstein Distribution ---\")\n    print(\"The entropy for bosons is maximized subject to a constant total energy.\")\n    print(\"This is done using the method of Lagrange multipliers on the function L = S/k_B - βE.\")\n    print(\"The procedure yields the equilibrium occupation number <n_i> for an energy level ε_i:\")\n    print(\"  <n_i> / g_i = 1 / (exp(β*ε_i) - 1)\")\n    print(\"where g_i is the degeneracy, β = 1/(k_B*T), T is temperature, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Mean Energy Calculation ---\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Equilibrium Mean Energy (E_eq) ---\")\n    print(\"The mean energy is the sum of energies over all states: E = Σ <n_i> * ε_i.\")\n    print(\"For a continuous spectrum of photons in a 3D volume V, we replace the sum with an integral\")\n    print(\"using the density of states g(ε) = (8*π*V / (h³*c³)) * ε².\")\n    print(\"  E_eq = Integral from 0 to ∞ of [ ε * g(ε) / (exp(β*ε) - 1) ] dε\")\n    print(\"Solving this integral leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of a photon gas.\\n\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the mean energy E_eq is:\")\n    print(\"  E_eq = (N1 * π^N2 * V * k_B^N3 * T^N3) / (D1 * h^N4 * c^N4)\")\n    print(\"\\nThe numerical constants in the Mean Energy equation are:\")\n    \n    # Printing each number in the energy equation\n    energy_constants = {\n        \"Numerator coefficient (N1)\": 8,\n        \"Power of pi (N2)\": 5,\n        \"Power of Boltzmann constant and Temperature (N3)\": 4,\n        \"Denominator coefficient (D1)\": 15,\n        \"Power of Planck constant and speed of light (N4)\": 3,\n    }\n    for name, value in energy_constants.items():\n        print(f\"  {name}: {value}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSo, E_eq = (8 * π^5 * V * k_B^4 * T^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3)\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 3: Entropy Calculation ---\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Equilibrium Entropy (S_eq) ---\")\n    print(\"For a photon gas, there is a simple thermodynamic relation between energy and entropy: S = (4/3) * E/T.\")\n    print(\"We can use our result for E_eq to find the equilibrium entropy S_eq.\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the entropy S_eq is:\")\n    print(\"  S_eq = (N1 * π^N2 * V * k_B^N3 * T^N4) / (D1 * h^N5 * c^N5)\")\n    print(\"\\nThe numerical constants in the Entropy equation are:\")\n    \n    # Printing each number in the entropy equation\n    entropy_constants = {\n        \"Numerator coefficient (N1)\": 32, # (4/3) * 8\n        \"Power of pi (N2)\": 5,\n        \"Power of Boltzmann constant (N3)\": 4,\n        \"Power of Temperature (N4)\": 3, # T^4 / T\n        \"Denominator coefficient (D1)\": 45, # 3 * 15\n        \"Power of Planck constant and speed of light (N5)\": 3\n    }\n    for name, value in entropy_constants.items():\n        print(f\"  {name}: {value}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSo, S_eq = (32 * π^5 * V * k_B^4 * T^3) / (45 * h^3 * c^3)\\n\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_bose_equilibrium()\n<<<E_eq = (8 * π^5 * V * k_B^4 * T^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3)\nS_eq = (32 * π^5 * V * k_B^4 * T^3) / (45 * h^3 * c^3)>>>"
