def check_decidability_of_gods_existence():
    """
    This function addresses the decidability of the question "does a god exist?".

    In computability theory, a problem is decidable if an algorithm exists that can
    always halt and provide a correct 'yes' or 'no' answer.

    This problem runs into fundamental limitations:

    1. Lack of a Formal Definition: The term "god" is not a mathematically or
       logically precise object that a program can reason about.

    2. Lack of Computable Inputs/Axioms: An algorithm needs data or axioms.
       There is no verifiable input or universally accepted logical framework
       from which to deduce an answer.

    3. Unverifiable Output: We can write a program that prints "yes" or one that
       prints "no". Both programs halt. However, there is no way for us to
       verify which program's output is correct.

    Therefore, the problem is not decidable in the computational sense.
