    This function solves the problem step-by-step for n=1.

    The problem asks to find n0 that minimizes the expression 
    Tr(Dn) * (Det(Dn))^(1/n).

    Let's analyze the expression. The matrix Mn is defined as a sparse upper
    Hessenberg matrix of size N x N where N = 2^(n+1)-1. Its non-zero
    entries are M(i, i+1) = 1 and M(2j, j) = -1. For any n >= 1, the first row of
    the symmetric part S_n = (M_n + M_n^T)/2 is all zeros. This means S_n is
    singular, and so is the diagonal matrix Dn from its LDL' decomposition.
    Thus, Det(Dn) = 0 for all n >= 1. The expression to be minimized is
    consequently 0 for all n.

    The problem states that the expression "is minimized for n=n0". The minimum
    value is 0, which is achieved for all n >= 1. We take the smallest n
    for which this minimum is achieved, which is n=1. So, we set n0=1.
