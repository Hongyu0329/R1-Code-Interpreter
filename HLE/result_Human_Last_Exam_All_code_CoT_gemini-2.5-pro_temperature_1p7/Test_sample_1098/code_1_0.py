    # Step 1: The problem with a simple one-way door
    print("1. The apparatus consists of two compartments with a one-way door.")
    print("   The goal is to trap all gas on one side, which would decrease the system's entropy.")

    # Step 2: The role of thermal equilibrium
    print("\n2. According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, this should not happen spontaneously in an isolated system at a uniform temperature.")
    print("   The reason lies in the door itself.")

    # Step 3: Brownian Motion of the door
    print("\n3. If the entire system (gas and door) is at the same temperature, the door is also subject to random thermal motion (Brownian motion).")
    print("   This means the 'one-way' door will jiggle and vibrate.")

    # Step 4: Failure of the Ratchet
    print("\n4. Due to this random jiggling, the door will occasionally fail and open the 'wrong' way, letting gas molecules leak back.")
    print("   This ensures that the gas remains distributed between both compartments, and the system stays at maximum entropy (equilibrium).")

    # Step 5: The Required Condition
    print("\n5. To make the door a perfect, unerring one-way valve, we must eliminate its random thermal motion.")
    print("   The only way to stop all thermal motion in an object is to cool it to absolute zero (0 Kelvin).")

    # Step 6: Conclusion
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Therefore, to make the apparatus work as intended and trap all the gas on one side, a temperature difference is required.")
    print("Specifically, the door (the 'demon') must be cooled to a much lower temperature than the gas, ideally absolute zero.")
    print("The essential experimental parameter that must be controlled is: Temperature.")
