    # 2) Incorrect. A diagonal S-matrix does not necessarily imply a diagonal potential.
    # 3) Incorrect. A non-trivially coupled potential can have a diagonal (trivial) Jost matrix.
    # 4) Incorrect. A non-trivially coupled Jost matrix can lead to a diagonal (trivial) S-matrix.
    # 5) Correct. There exist non-trivially coupled potentials with diagonal Jost matrices.
