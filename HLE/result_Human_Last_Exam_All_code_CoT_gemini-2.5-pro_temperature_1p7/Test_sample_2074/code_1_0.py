# The problem involves a detailed mathematical derivation. The summary of the derivation is as follows:
# 1. The condition on matrix M imposed by the two complicated integrals simplifies to M being a symmetric matrix.
# 2. The set of matrices 'Image f' becomes the set of all symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices.
# 3. The minimization problem for l(b) simplifies. Let X = A^T[BB^T]^-1 A. The expression inside the infimum simplifies to Tr(X) + 101, assuming the most consistent interpretation of the provided notation.
# 4. We need to find the infimum of Tr(S*C*S) + 101 over all SPD matrices S, where C is another SPD matrix derived from B.
# 5. By choosing S = epsilon * I (where I is identity and epsilon is a small positive number), the trace term Tr(S*C*S) = epsilon^2 * Tr(C) can be made arbitrarily close to 0.
# 6. Therefore, the infimum is 101. This value is independent of the parameter b.
# 7. Thus, l(1/2) = 101 and l(-1/2) = 101.
# 8. The final calculation is 6 * (l(1/2) + l(-1/2)).

# Assigning the derived values
l_half = 101
l_neg_half = 101

# The numbers in the final equation
val1 = l_half
val2 = l_neg_half
multiplier = 6

# Computing the result
result = multiplier * (val1 + val2)

# Outputting the result in the requested format
print(f"Based on the derivation, the value of l(1/2) is {val1}.")
print(f"Based on the derivation, the value of l(-1/2) is {val2}.")
print(f"The final computation is {multiplier} * ({val1} + {val2}) = {result}.")

# Final Answer
print(f"The final calculated value is: {result}")
