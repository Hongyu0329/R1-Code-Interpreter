    This function determines the product of the given chemical reaction and prints its IUPAC name.
    
    The reaction is an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement of a chiral amide enolate.
    
    Starting Material: N-(((S)-5-methylcyclopent-1-en-1-yl)methyl)-N-((S)-1-phenylethyl)propionamide
    
    Steps:
    1. LiHMDS, Toluene, -78 C: Forms a stereodefined (Z)-lithium enolate at the alpha-carbon of the propionyl group.
    2. 100 C, 8h: Promotes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.
    
    The stereochemical outcome is predictable based on established models for this reaction.
    - The (S)-chiral auxiliary directs the formation of an (R)-stereocenter at the alpha-position of the product acid.
    - The existing (S)-stereocenter on the cyclopentene ring directs the incoming group to attach trans to the methyl group.
    
    This leads to a specific diastereomer. The function below will print its final IUPAC name.
