    "To find a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles of the $9_{23}$ knot, we will use its HOMFLY polynomial, denoted as $P_K(a, z)$. A key property derived from this polynomial is the Morton-Franks-Williams inequality, which relates the span of the polynomial in the variable 'z' to the minimum number of Seifert circles, $s(K)$, of the knot $K$.\n\nThe span is the difference between the highest and lowest powers of $z$ appearing in the polynomial:\n$\\text{span}_z(P_K) = \\deg_z(P_K) - \\text{mindeg}_z(P_K)$\n\nThe inequality is:\n$\\text{span}_z(P_K) \\le 2(s(K) - 1)$\n\nBy rearranging this formula, we can establish a lower bound for $s(K)$:\n$s(K) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\text{span}_z(P_K) + 1$\n\nMy plan is to execute a Python script to:\n1.  Compute the HOMFLY polynomial for the knot $9_{23}$ using the `spherogram` library.\n2.  Determine the maximum and minimum degrees of the variable $z$ in this polynomial.\n3.  Calculate the span of $z$.\n4.  Use the span to compute the lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles using the formula above.\n5.
