    "This is a knowledge-based question rather than a coding task. I will provide a direct answer.\n\nThe value computed between heartbeats to measure Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the time interval between successive heartbeats. This is most commonly known as the **R-R interval**.\n\nThe \"R-R\" refers to the time elapsed between two consecutive R-waves, which are the highest peaks in an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Even though you are using Photoplethysmography (PPG), which measures blood volume changes, the resulting \"beat-to-beat interval\" is typically analyzed as an R-R interval for HRV calculations. Other synonymous terms, especially for PPG, include Inter-Beat Interval (IBI) and Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI).\n\n<<<R-R interval>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
