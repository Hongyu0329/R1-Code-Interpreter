    "An elegant explanation for the encoded word lies in interpreting the 't' and 'b' characters as indicators for a binary system, specifically Braille dots. The structure of the input strongly suggests the encoding of five distinct symbols, which perfectly fits the pattern of a simple mathematical equation like \"Number Operator Number = Number\". The word to be found is the full text of this equation.\n\nThe mapping from the provided 't' and 'b' values to Braille dots for each of the five symbols is as follows:\nFor each symbol `k` (from 0 to 4):\n- Dot 1 (top-left) is determined by `H1[2*k]`\n- Dot 2 (mid-left) is determined by `H2[2*k]`\n- Dot 3 (bottom-left) is determined by `H3[2*k]`\n- Dot 4 (top-right) is determined by `H1[2*k+1]`\n- Dot 5 (mid-right) is determined by `H2[2*k+1]`\n- Dot 6 (bottom-right) is determined by `H3[2*k+1]`\n\nThe 't' stands for a raised dot (ON), and 'b' for a flat dot (OFF). The vertical lists of 't's and 'b's are a red herring, designed to distract from the main encoding in the horizontal lists.\n\nBy applying this decoding scheme, we can decipher each of the five symbols to reveal the final equation. The code below performs this decoding and prints the resulting phrase.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Decodes a message encoded in a Braille-like system from the given\n    't' (dot on) and 'b' (dot off) values.
