    "My plan is to address the user's question by first clarifying the names involved. The query appears to combine the name of a former Nigerian President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, with the surname of Nigeria's first President, Nnamdi Azikiwe. I will explain that these are two different and prominent political figures in Nigeria's history. Since Goodluck Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\", there is no specific year to provide. The python code will print a clear statement explaining this fact.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_and_provide_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the user's query by clarifying the identity\n    of the public figures mentioned.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the names of the two distinct Nigerian leaders\n    former_president_jonathan = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    first_president_azikiwe = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n\n    # Explanation text\n    print(\"Based on public records, the name in the question appears to combine two different Nigerian leaders.\")\n    print(f\"1.
