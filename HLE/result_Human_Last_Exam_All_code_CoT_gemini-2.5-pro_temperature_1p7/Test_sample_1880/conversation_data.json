    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, I will follow these steps:\n1.  **Irreducibility:** First, I will check if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. This is a prerequisite for the standard methods of determining the Galois group. I will use Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  **Discriminant:** Next, I will compute the discriminant ($\\Delta$) of the polynomial. The sign of the discriminant and whether it is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ tells us if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Resolvent Cubic:** I will then construct the resolvent cubic polynomial. The reducibility of this cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ further narrows down the possible Galois groups.\n4.  **Final Determination:** Based on the properties of the discriminant and the resolvent cubic, I will distinguish between the remaining possible groups ($D_4$ or $C_4$). This final step involves checking if the original polynomial becomes reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these calculations and print out each step of the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_galois_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and explains the process to find the order of the Galois group \n    for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # In the form x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, we have a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14.\n    p_c = 8\n    p_d = 14\n    \n    print(\"The polynomial is P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Check for irreducibility over the rational numbers Q.\")\n    print(\"We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2:\")\n    print(\"- The prime p=2 divides the non-leading coefficients (the coefficient of x^3 is 0, x^2 is 0, x is 8, and the constant is 14).\")\n    print(\"- The prime p=2 does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\")\n    print(f\"- The square of the prime, p^2=4, does not divide the constant term {p_d}.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n    print(\"The Galois group G must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group S_4.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the discriminant.\")\n    print(\"For a polynomial of the form x^4 + cx + d, the discriminant is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"Delta = 256*d^3 - 27*c^4\")\n    # Calculate the discriminant\n    delta = 256 * (p_d**3) - 27 * (p_c**4)\n    print(f\"Plugging in c={p_c} and d={p_d}:\")\n    print(f\"Delta = 256 * {p_d}^3 - 27 * {p_c}^4\")\n    print(f\"Delta = 256 * {p_d**3} - 27 * {p_c**4}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {256 * p_d**3} - {27 * p_c**4}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {delta}\")\n    \n    # Check if Delta is a perfect square of a rational number.\n    # Since Delta is an integer, we check if it is a perfect square of an integer.\n    sqrt_delta = math.isqrt(delta)\n    if sqrt_delta * sqrt_delta == delta:\n        print(f\"The discriminant {delta} is a perfect square.\")\n        print(\"This implies the Galois group G is a subgroup of the alternating group A_4.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The discriminant {delta} is not a perfect square (its square root is not an integer).\")\n        print(\"This implies the Galois group G is not a subgroup of A_4.\")\n        print(\"Possible groups are S_4, D_4, or C_4.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Construct and analyze the resolvent cubic.\")\n    print(\"The resolvent cubic for x^4 + cx + d is y^3 - 4*d*y - c^2 = 0.\")\n    rc_b_val = -4 * p_d\n    rc_c_val = -(p_c**2)\n    print(f\"For our polynomial, this is y^3 - 4*({p_d})*y - ({p_c})^2 = 0\")\n    print(f\"This simplifies to: y^3 + ({rc_b_val})*y + ({rc_c_val}) = 0, or y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nWe check for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.\")\n    print(f\"Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term {-64}.\")\n    constant_term = rc_c_val\n    rational_root_found = None\n    for r in range(1, abs(constant_term) + 1):\n        if constant_term % r == 0:\n            for sign in [1, -1]:\n                root_candidate = r * sign\n                if root_candidate**3 + rc_b_val * root_candidate + rc_c_val == 0:\n                    rational_root_found = root_candidate\n                    break\n        if rational_root_found is not None:\n            break\n            \n    if rational_root_found is None:\n        print(\"The resolvent cubic is irreducible over Q (it has no rational roots).\")\n        print(\"This implies the Galois group G is S_4, with order 24.\")\n        order = 24\n    else:\n        print(f\"A rational root was found: y = {rational_root_found}.\")\n        print(\"Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over Q.\")\n        print(\"This means the Galois group is not S_4.
