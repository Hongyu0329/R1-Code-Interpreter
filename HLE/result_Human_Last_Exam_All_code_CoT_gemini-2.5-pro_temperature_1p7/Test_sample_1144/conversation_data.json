    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):** I will use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states `Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`, where `Δx` is the uncertainty in position and `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant. We will use the minimum uncertainty, so the equation becomes `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`.\n2.  **Determine the Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p₁):** In the Bohr model, the angular momentum of an electron is quantized: `L = mvr = nħ`. For the first orbit (`n=1`), the angular momentum is `L₁ = r₁ * p₁ = ħ`, where `p₁` is the linear momentum and `r₁` is the radius of the first Bohr orbit (the Bohr radius, `a₀`). From this, we can find the momentum: `p₁ = ħ / r₁`.\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio:** The final step is to compute the ratio `Δp / p₁`.\n\nBy substituting the expressions from steps 1 and 2, the ratio simplifies to:\n`Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / r₁) = r₁ / (2 * Δx)`\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron\n    to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical constants\n    h_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\n    bohr_radius = 5.29177210903e-11  # Radius of the first Bohr orbit (m)\n\n    # Given value\n    delta_x = 10e-12  # Uncertainty in position (10 pm in meters)\n\n    # 1.
