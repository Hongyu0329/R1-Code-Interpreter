The best choice of the pair $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ is given by the formulas:
$\gamma_1 = \frac{4(\kappa+1) - 2\sqrt{2}(\kappa-1)}{\kappa^2+6\kappa+1}$
$\gamma_2 = \frac{4(\kappa+1) + 2\sqrt{2}(\kappa-1)}{\kappa^2+6\kappa+1}$
where $\kappa$ is the condition number $M/\mu$ (denoted as $M$ in the code, with $\mu=1$).
