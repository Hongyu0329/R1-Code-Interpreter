def find_rotation_index(A, B):
    """
    Given two lists A and B, where B is a cyclic shift of A (A[i:] + A[:i]),
    this function finds the rotation index i.

    The problem states that A contains n unique integers and is not necessarily ordered.
    B is guaranteed to be a rotation of A.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. The relationship B = A[i:] + A[:i] implies that B[0] must equal A[i].
    2. Therefore, the task is to find the index of the element B[0] inside list A.
    3. Since A is an unsorted list, searching for an element requires a linear scan,
       which has a time complexity of O(n).
    4. This O(n) approach is optimal because the lower bound for searching in an
       unsorted array is Î©(n).

    Args:
        A (list): A list of n unique integers.
        B (list): A list that is a rotation of A.

    Returns:
        int: The rotation index i.
