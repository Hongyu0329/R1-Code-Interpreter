    This function formalizes the conclusion of the mathematical argument.
    
    The reasoning proceeds as follows:
    1. A group topology on the integers is considered. It must be either Hausdorff or not.
    2. If the topology is not Hausdorff, it is shown to possess non-trivial convergent sequences, violating one of the conditions.
    3. If the topology is Hausdorff and totally bounded, it can be embedded as a dense subgroup of a compact group K. The condition of no non-trivial convergent sequences forces the topology to be discrete.
    4. The discrete topology is then checked. While it has no non-trivial convergent sequences, it is not totally bounded.
    5. Since neither case yields a valid topology, we conclude there are no such topologies.
