    "This is a classic problem in convex geometry. The task is to find the minimum area of a convex domain `K` in the plane that has a non-empty intersection with every line `L` given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Rephrase the problem**: The condition that `K` intersects every line in the family `L` can be translated into conditions on the support function of `K`. This allows using tools from convex geometry, specifically duality.\n2.  **Use Duality**: The condition on `K` is equivalent to a condition on its polar dual body, `K*`. This condition is that the interior of `K*` must not contain any point `(p, q)` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. This can be extended to state that the interior of `K*` must not contain any non-zero integer lattice point `(p,q)`.\n3.  **Find the Optimal Shape**: Using the theory of geometry of numbers (specifically, Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies and the Blaschke-Santal√≥ inequality relating the area of a body and its dual), one can establish a lower bound for the area of `K`. The analysis shows that the minimal area is achieved when `K` is a parallelogram.\n4.  **Identify a Solution and Calculate its Area**: One such shape that achieves the minimal area is a square rotated by 45 degrees (a diamond shape), defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| <= 1`. The vertices of this diamond are at `(1, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(-1, 0)`, and `(0, -1)`. We can verify that this shape intersects all the required lines and calculate its area. The area of this diamond is 2. Another shape, a triangle with vertices `(1,0), (-1,-1), (-1,1)`, also has an area of 2 and satisfies the condition.\n5.  **Conclusion**: The minimal area is 2. I will provide Python code to calculate the area of the diamond shape.\n\nThe python code below calculates the area of the diamond shape `|x| + |y| <= 1`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines px+qy=1 for coprime integers p, q.\n    \n    The minimal area is known to be 2. This area is achieved by a diamond shape (a square rotated 45 degrees)\n    with vertices at (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1).\n    \n    The area of this diamond can be calculated using the formula for a rhombus: Area = 0.5 * d1 * d2,\n    where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The vertices of the diamond shape.\n    v1 = np.array([1, 0])\n    v2 = np.array([0, 1])\n    v3 = np.array([-1, 0])\n    v4 = np.array([0, -1])\n\n    # The diagonals connect opposite vertices.\n    # d1 is the distance between (1,0) and (-1,0).\n    # d2 is the distance between (0,1) and (0,-1).\n    d1 = v1[0] - v3[0]\n    d2 = v2[1] - v4[1]\n\n    # The equation for the area is Area = 1/2 * d1 * d2\n    num1 = 0.5\n    num2 = d1\n    num3 = d2\n    area = num1 * num2 * num3\n    \n    print(\"One shape that achieves the minimal area is a diamond with vertices (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1).\")\n    print(f\"The lengths of its diagonals are d1 = {d1} and d2 = {d2}.\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the area is: Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2\")\n    \n    # Output each number in the final equation, followed by the result\n    print(f\"Area = {num1} * {num2} * {num3}\")\n    print(f\"The minimal area is: {area}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
