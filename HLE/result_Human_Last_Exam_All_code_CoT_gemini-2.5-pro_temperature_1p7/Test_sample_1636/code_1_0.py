    print("The most direct physical action of the sea that fits this description is the movement of the tides.")

    print("Reason 2: The poem has a contemplative and somber mood ('grave edge of the world', 'I am agate, opaline').")
    print("The repetitive action of the sea serves as a parallel to the repetitive nature of deep thought or introspection.")
    print("The sea measuring physical distance becomes a metaphor for the speaker measuring their internal, psychological 'distance' from others, the world, or themselves. This corresponds to the second part of answer A: 'and evoke ideas of introspective contemplation'.")
