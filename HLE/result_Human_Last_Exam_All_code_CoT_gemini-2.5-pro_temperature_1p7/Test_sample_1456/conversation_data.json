    "This is a problem in the field of mathematics known as continuum theory. To solve it, we need to understand the key concepts and rely on established theorems.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define Key Terms:** First, I'll clarify the definitions of a continuum, a composant, and the distinction between decomposable and indecomposable continua.\n2.  **Number of Composants for a Single Continuum:** I'll state the number of composants for a single continuum based on whether it's decomposable (1 composant) or indecomposable (`c` composants, where `c` is the cardinality of the continuum).\n3.  **Analyze the Product Space:** The core of the problem lies in understanding how the number of composants behaves when taking the product of two continua, `X` and `Y`. I'll analyze this by splitting it into two major cases.\n    *   **Case 1:** At least one of the continua is decomposable. I will use a theorem by S. Mardešić to determine the number of composants in the product.\n    *   **Case 2:** Both continua are indecomposable. This case is more complex, and I will cite results from the work of J. W. Rogers, Jr. that specify the possible number of composants.\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the maximum possible values from each case, I will identify the overall largest possible number of composants.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan, printing out the reasoning step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_continuum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the largest possible number of composants\n    of the product of two nondegenerate continua by explaining the relevant theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Introduction and Definitions ---\n    print(\"This program determines the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua, X and Y.\")\n    print(\"Let's denote the number of composants of a continuum Z as N(Z).\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Understand the number of composants for a single continuum.\")\n    print(\"A 'continuum' is a compact, connected metric space.
