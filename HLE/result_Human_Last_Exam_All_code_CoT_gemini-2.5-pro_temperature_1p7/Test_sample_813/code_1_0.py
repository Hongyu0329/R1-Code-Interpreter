1. Patient's Initial Presentation: The patient exhibited symptoms of agitation, difficulty falling asleep, an increase in sexual activities, and careless spending. Coupled with a family history of mood disorders, this is a classic presentation of a manic episode, likely related to bipolar disorder.

2. Implied Treatment: A medication was prescribed to treat these behavioral disturbances. The standard and most common treatment for a manic episode is a mood stabilizer, with Lithium being a primary choice.

3. Development of New Symptom: After starting the medication, the patient developed decreased interest in sex (decreased libido), which is a form of sexual dysfunction.

4. Evaluating the Most Likely Cause:
   - A. Lithium induced hypothyroidism: This is the most plausible cause. Lithium is a likely prescription for the patient's initial symptoms. A major and common side effect of Lithium is causing hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid). Hypothyroidism is, in turn, a well-established cause of decreased libido and sexual dysfunction. This choice connects all the events in the case chronologically and medically.
   - B, C, D, E: The heavy metal options (Arsenic, Mercury, Lead, Manganese) are less likely to be the root cause for this specific sequence. While the patient's occupation creates a risk for heavy metal exposure, these options do not explain the initial manic episode (hypersexuality) followed by a sudden decrease in libido after a new medication was introduced. Lead, for instance, typically causes decreased libido directly, not an initial increase.

5. Conclusion: The most logical root cause that explains the entire series of events is Lithium-induced hypothyroidism.
