    "My plan is to determine the structure of the hydrocarbon C7H14 by systematically analyzing its molecular formula and 13C NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C7H14):** I will first calculate the degree of unsaturation to determine if the compound contains double bonds or rings. The formula CnH2n suggests one double bond or one ring.\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data:**\n    *   I'll examine the chemical shifts to identify the types of carbons present. Shifts between 100-150 ppm indicate alkene carbons, which will confirm the presence of a C=C double bond.\n    *   I'll use the multiplicities (s, d, t, q) to determine the number of hydrogens attached to each carbon (s=C, d=CH, t=CH2, q=CH3).\n    *   The total number of signals is 6, while the formula has 7 carbons. This, along with the hint, means there is one overlapping signal, representing two chemically equivalent carbons.\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   I will deduce the core structure based on the alkene signals.\n    *   I will then identify the remaining alkyl fragments based on the other signals.\n    *   I will account for the overlapping signal to correctly identify all fragments (e.g., an isopropyl group often has two equivalent methyls).\n    *   Finally, I will assemble these fragments into a single molecule that is consistent with all the data.\n4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:** Once the correct structure is determined, I will apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to find the official name of the compound.\n\n```python\n# Step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of C7H14\n\n# 1.
