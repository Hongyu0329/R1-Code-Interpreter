    # The noun in question is "mariti" (of the husband).
    # Grammatical properties: genitive case, singular number, masculine gender.

    # We will analyze each adjective and participle in the sentence.
    # An adjective must agree with the noun it modifies in case, number, and gender.
    # Context is also crucial for resolving ambiguities.

    # Adjective/Participle Analysis:
    # 1. 'muliebri' (with 'arte'): Ablative case. Does not match 'mariti' (genitive).
    # 2. 'laborantis': Genitive singular. Matches 'mariti'. Contextually, "the suffering husband" fits well.
    # 3. 'gratissimi': Genitive singular masculine. Matches 'mariti'. However, it clearly modifies 'partus'
    #    ("of a most welcome birth").
    # 4. 'coepti': Genitive singular masculine. Matches 'mariti'. However, it also modifies 'partus'
    #    ("a birth undertaken").

    # Based on the analysis, only one word modifies "mariti".
