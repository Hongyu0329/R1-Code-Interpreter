    # definitively conclude that absolutely no parental care occurs.

    # Statement 3: The population will never speciate even in future generations.
    # Speciation requires evolutionary change leading to reproductive isolation.

    # are precisely those under which evolution does not occur.

    # between the west and east groups.
    # Random mating across the entire region prevents the formation of genetically
    # distinct subgroups. Allele frequencies will be uniform.
