    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to find the rule activation level for a fuzzy rule, given two membership values from its antecedent (the \"IF\" part of the rule).\n2.  **Identify the Operation:** The problem specifies using a \"t-norm\" operation. A t-norm is a function that models the logical \"AND\" in fuzzy logic. The most common and fundamental t-norm is the **minimum** operator. We will use this operator for the calculation.\n3.  **Set up the Calculation:** The rule activation level is the result of applying the t-norm to the given membership values.\n    *   Value 1: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n    *   Value 2: `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n    *   Equation: `activation_level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n4.  **Execute and Present:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the full equation along with its result, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_rule_activation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level for an interval type-3 fuzzy set\n    using a minimum t-norm operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given membership values\n    phi_k = 0.7\n    mu_G = 0.9\n\n    # The rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm to the\n    # membership values in the rule's antecedent. The most common t-norm\n    # is the minimum (min) function.\n    activation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G)\n\n    # Print the equation and the final result.\n    # We use sys.stdout.write to ensure there's no extra formatting.\n    sys.stdout.write(\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm:\\n\")\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G})\\n\")\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"Activation Level = {activation_level}\\n\")\n\ncalculate_rule_activation()\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
