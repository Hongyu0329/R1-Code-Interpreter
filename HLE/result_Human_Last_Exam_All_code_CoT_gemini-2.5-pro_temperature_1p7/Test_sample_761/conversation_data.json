    "No, structurally, polynucleotides are not polysaccharides. They are two distinct classes of biological macromolecules with fundamentally different structures.\n\nHere is a breakdown of their key differences:\n\n*   **Monomers (Building Blocks):**\n    *   **Polysaccharides** are polymers of **monosaccharides** (simple sugars like glucose).\n    *   **Polynucleotides** are polymers of **nucleotides**. Each nucleotide itself is a more complex molecule made of three components: a phosphate group, a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA), and a nitrogenous base.\n\n*   **Backbone Structure and Bonds:**\n    *   In **polysaccharides**, the sugar monomers are linked directly to each other via **glycosidic bonds**, forming a backbone made entirely of sugar units.\n    *   In **polynucleotides**, the backbone is a repeating **sugar-phosphate** chain. The nucleotides are linked by **phosphodiester bonds** that connect the sugar of one nucleotide to the phosphate group of the next.\n\n*   **Chemical Composition:**\n    *   **Polysaccharides** are primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (CHO).\n    *   **Polynucleotides** contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but critically, they also contain **phosphorus** (in the phosphate groups) and **nitrogen** (in the bases).\n\nThe following Python script will print a detailed comparison to clarify these differences.\n\n```python\ndef compare_biopolymers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a detailed comparison between polynucleotides and polysaccharides.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Are polynucleotides, structurally, polysaccharides?
