        },
        'C': {
            "strategy": "Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5.",
            "explanation": "This does NOT help; it makes the problem worse. Using highly flexible functions like high-degree polynomials increases the model's 'wiggle room', expanding the number of congruent rate functions that can fit the data. This exacerbates, rather than mitigates, the identifiability issue.",

            "strategy": "Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors in the phylogeny (probability of lineage removal after sampling = 0).",
            "explanation": "This helps significantly. Fossils provide direct information about past diversity, including when lineages existed and when they terminated (or persisted). This additional data breaks the congruence classes that exist when only using data from extant species.",

        'E': {
            "strategy": "Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled diversification rate.",
            "explanation": "This helps. The pulled diversification rate (speciation - extinction) is an identifiable parameter combination. By reparametrizing the model to estimate this value directly, we avoid the unidentifiable individual rates and focus on what can be robustly inferred from the data.",

        'F': {
            "strategy": "Incorporating fossils tips in the phylogeny (probability of lineage removal after sampling = 1).",
            "explanation": "This helps significantly. Similar to D, adding fossil tips provides direct evidence of extinct lineages, which is crucial information for estimating extinction rates and breaking the non-identifiability problem.",

        'G': {
            "strategy": "Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled speciation rate.",
