    "My plan is to use Bresenham's line algorithm to generate all the integer coordinates (pixels) that lie on the line connecting the start point (1, 1) and the end point (11, 5).\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  Define the start point (x1, y1) as (1, 1) and the end point (x2, y2) as (11, 5).\n2.  Calculate the change in x (dx) and y (dy). For this line, dx = 10 and dy = 4.\n3.  Since the slope (dy/dx = 0.4) is between 0 and 1, we will iterate along the x-axis, incrementing x by 1 at each step, and decide whether to increment y.\n4.  I'll use Bresenham's decision parameter `p = 2*dy - dx` to make the decision at each step.\n5.  I will generate and store all the pixels of the line in a list.\n6.  The total number of pixels on this line is 11. The central pixel will be the one at the middle index of this list (index 5, as it's 0-indexed).\n7.  Finally, I'll retrieve and print the coordinates of this central pixel.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel_bresenham():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the central pixel of a line from (1, 1) to (11, 5)\n    using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = 1, 1\n    x2, y2 = 11, 5\n\n    pixels = []\n    \n    # These variables are for the algorithm\n    x, y = x1, y1\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n    \n    # Decision parameter\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n\n    # Store the first pixel\n    pixels.append((x, y))\n\n    # Iterate from x1 to x2 to generate all pixels\n    while x < x2:\n        x += 1\n        if p < 0:\n            p = p + 2 * dy\n        else:\n            y += 1\n            p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx\n        pixels.append((x, y))\n    \n    # Find the middle pixel in the list of generated pixels\n    mid_index = len(pixels) // 2\n    central_pixel = pixels[mid_index]\n    \n    # Output the result as requested\n    center_x = central_pixel[0]\n    center_y = central_pixel[1]\n    \n    print(f\"The central pixel coordinate is ({center_x}, {center_y})\")\n\nfind_central_pixel_bresenham()\n```\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
