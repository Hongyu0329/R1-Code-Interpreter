    "To determine the connectivity of the map $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  First, we'll calculate the connectivity of the source and target spaces. A map $f: X \\to Y$ is at least $k$-connected if both $X$ and $Y$ are $(k-1)$-connected. The connectivity of a space $X$ is the largest integer $n$ such that $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i < n$.\n2.  We will use standard formulas for the connectivity of spaces constructed via loop space, suspension, and smash product.\n3.  After establishing a baseline connectivity, we'll analyze the induced map on the first non-trivial homotopy group to see if it is an isomorphism.\n4.  We will continue to the next homotopy group to find the dimension at which the induced map is no longer a surjection. The connectivity of the map is one less than this dimension.\n\nThe following Python code details this step-by-step calculation.\n\n```python\ndef print_step(n, text):\n    \"\"\"Formats and prints a step in the calculation.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Step {n}: {text}\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program calculates the connectivity of the specified map using principles of algebraic topology.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Connectivity of the source space X = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6)\n    print_step(1, \"Calculate the connectivity of the source space X = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6).\")\n\n    # Connectivity of S^n is n-1\n    # Connectivity of Omega X is conn(X) - 1\n    # So, connectivity of Omega S^n is (n-1) - 1 = n-2\n    n4 = 4\n    conn_omega_s4 = n4 - 2\n    print(f\"The sphere S^4 is (4-1)=3-connected.\")\n    print(f\"The loop space Omega S^4 is ({n4} - 2) = {conn_omega_s4}-connected.\")\n\n    n6 = 6\n    conn_omega_s6 = n6 - 2\n    print(f\"The sphere S^6 is (6-1)=5-connected.\")\n    print(f\"The loop space Omega S^6 is ({n6} - 2) = {conn_omega_s6}-connected.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Connectivity of X wedge Y is conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1\n    conn_smash1 = conn_omega_s4 + conn_omega_s6 + 1\n    print(f\"The smash product (Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) is therefore ({conn_omega_s4} + {conn_omega_s6} + 1) = {conn_smash1}-connected.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Connectivity of Sigma X is conn(X) + 1\n    conn_source = conn_smash1 + 1\n    print(f\"The source space X = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) is ({conn_smash1} + 1) = {conn_source}-connected.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 2: Connectivity of the target space Y = Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)\n    print_step(2, \"Calculate the connectivity of the target space Y = Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\")\n    conn_s4 = n4 - 1\n    conn_s6 = n6 - 1\n\n    conn_smash2 = conn_s4 + conn_s6 + 1\n    print(f\"The smash product (S^4 wedge S^6) is ({conn_s4} + {conn_s6} + 1) = {conn_smash2}-connected.\")\n    print(\"(Note: S^4 wedge S^6 is homotopy equivalent to S^10, which is (10-1)=9-connected).\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    conn_target = conn_smash2 - 1\n    print(f\"The target space Y = Omega(S^4 wedge S^6) is ({conn_smash2} - 1) = {conn_target}-connected.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the map on pi_9\n    print_step(3, \"Analyze the induced map on the 9th homotopy group (pi_9).\")\n    print(f\"Both source and target spaces are {conn_source}-connected, so the map is at least {conn_source}-connected.\")\n    print(\"To determine connectivity, we check the map on the lowest-dimensional non-zero homotopy groups.\")\n    print(f\"The first non-trivial homotopy groups appear at dimension {conn_source + 1} = 9.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFor the source space X:\")\n    print(\"pi_9(X) = pi_9(Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6))\")\n    print(\"By the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, this is isomorphic to pi_8(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6).\")\n    print(\"Since (Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) is 7-connected, the Hurewicz Theorem applies.\")\n    print(\"pi_8(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) is isomorphic to H_8(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6).\")\n    print(\"Using the Kunneth formula and the homology of loop spaces H_*(Omega S^{2k})=Z[x_{2k-1}] (polynomial algebra):\")\n    print(\"H_8(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) = H_3(Omega S^4) tensor H_5(Omega S^6) = Z tensor Z = Z.\")\n    print(\"So, pi_9(X) is isomorphic to Z.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFor the target space Y:\")\n    print(\"pi_9(Y) = pi_9(Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)) = pi_9(Omega(S^10))\")\n    print(\"This is isomorphic to pi_10(S^10) by the properties of loop spaces.\")\n    print(\"pi_10(S^10) is the group of degrees of maps from S^10 to itself, which is Z.\")\n    print(\"So, pi_9(Y) is isomorphic to Z.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe map phi_* on pi_9 is a map Z -> Z.
