# The problem asks for the upper bound of ||B * Q_{0, M}||_inf, expressed as a factor of sqrt(N).
# The provided text sets up the context for a theorem from recent GNN research.
# The theorem states that under the given conditions, the bound is:
# (2 * sqrt(N) * C_1 * lambda) / (beta * (1 - lambda))
#
# We need to extract the factor of sqrt(N) from this expression.

# Define the symbols used in the expression for clarity
C_1 = sympy.Symbol('C_1')        # A constant depending on the graph G and epsilon
lambda_ = sympy.Symbol('lambda') # The uniform contraction coefficient (0 < lambda < 1)
beta = sympy.Symbol('beta')      # The limit product, given as > 0

# Construct the full bound expression
N = sympy.Symbol('N')
full_bound = (2 * sympy.sqrt(N) * C_1 * lambda_) / (beta * (1 - lambda_))

# The factor of sqrt(N) is the expression divided by sqrt(N)
factor = full_bound / sympy.sqrt(N)

# We will print this factor. The numbers 2 and 1 are explicitly part of the final expression.
