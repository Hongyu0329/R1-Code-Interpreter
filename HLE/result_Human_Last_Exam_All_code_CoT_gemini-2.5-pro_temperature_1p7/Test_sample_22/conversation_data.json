    "This statement is conceptually **True**. Here is the reasoning, followed by a Python simulation to demonstrate the concept.\n\n### Plan and Reasoning\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This metric represents the proportion of variation in a trait (phenotype) that can be explained by the combined effect of all the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) considered in the analysis. It is a theoretical, population-level parameter that represents the *maximum possible* predictive power you could ever achieve using a linear model of those specific SNPs.\n\n2.  **Define a Polygenic Score (PGS):** A PGS is a practical tool used to predict an individual's trait value. It's a weighted sum of an individual's risk alleles. Critically, these weights (effect sizes) are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n3.  **The Core Difference:** The key distinction lies between the *true* effect sizes and the *estimated* effect sizes.\n    *   **SNP heritability** is based on the true, underlying effect sizes of the SNPs. It's the R-squared you would get from a perfect model.\n    *   **A PGS** is built using weights estimated from a GWAS with a *finite* number of participants. These estimates inevitably contain some statistical noise or error; they are not the true effects.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Because the PGS is built with imperfect, noisy weights, its ability to predict the phenotype in a new, independent set of individuals will be lower than the theoretical maximum defined by the SNP heritability. The predictive ability of the PGS (its R²) can approach the SNP heritability as the size of the GWAS discovery sample increases towards infinity, but in any real-world scenario, it will be lower.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this process. It creates a population where the \"true\" SNP heritability is known, then mimics a GWAS to create a PGS, and finally shows that the predictive R-squared of the PGS is lower than the true SNP heritability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom scipy.stats import pearsonr\n\ndef demonstrate_pgs_vs_heritability():\n    \"\"\"\n    A simulation to demonstrate that the variance explained by a Polygenic Score (PGS)\n    is lower than the SNP heritability of the trait.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
