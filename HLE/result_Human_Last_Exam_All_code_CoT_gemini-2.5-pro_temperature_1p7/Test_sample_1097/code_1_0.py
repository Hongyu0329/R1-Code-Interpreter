To prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the given boundary value problem using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we must first define an appropriate complete metric space M.

1.  Analysis of the BVP:
    The differential equation is u''(x) = exp(u(x)). Since the exponential function is always positive, we have u''(x) > 0 for all x in (0, 1). This implies that any solution u(x) must be a strictly convex function.
    For a convex function on the interval [0, 1] with the boundary conditions u(0) = 0 and u(1) = 0, the function must be non-positive everywhere in the interval. That is, u(x) <= 0 for all x in [0, 1].

2.  Defining the Set M:
    Based on this physical constraint derived from the equation, we define the set M to be the collection of all continuous functions on [0, 1] that satisfy both the boundary conditions and this non-positivity property. This set is a closed subset of the Banach space C[0, 1] (the space of continuous functions on [0,1] with the sup-norm), and is therefore a complete metric space itself.
    On this set, one can define an integral operator T and show it is a contraction mapping from M to M, thus proving the existence of a unique solution.

The required set M is therefore defined as:
