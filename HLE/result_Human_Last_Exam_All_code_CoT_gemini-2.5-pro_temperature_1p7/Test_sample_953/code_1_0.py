def solve_mis_complexity():
    """
    Determines the complexity category for Luby's algorithm on different graph classes.

    The analysis shows that for all three specified graph classes (cycles, trees with bounded degree,
    and general graphs with bounded degree), the algorithm's runtime is tightly bounded by Theta(log n).
    This is based on standard results in the analysis of distributed algorithms, where paths and cycles
    represent worst-case scenarios for local algorithms due to their poor expansion properties.

    According to the provided categories, a Theta(log n) complexity falls into category 9.
