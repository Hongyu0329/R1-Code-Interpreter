def solve_inscribed_square():
    """
    This function determines and prints the shortest sequence of commands
    to construct a square inscribed in a circle given the center and one point on the circumference.
    
    The steps are as follows:
    1.  (L) Draw a Line through the center (O) and the given point on the circumference (A).
        This line creates the first diameter, intersecting the circle at a new point (B).
    2.  (C) Draw a Circle centered at A, with a radius defined by point B.
    3.  (C) Draw a Circle centered at B, with a radius defined by point A.
    4.  (L) Draw a Line connecting the two intersection points of the circles from steps 2 and 3.
        This line is the second diameter, perpendicular to the first.
    
    The vertices of the square are the four points where the two diameters intersect the original circle.
    The sequence of commands is LCCL.
