    This function calculates the rank and torsion order for the given group G.

    The group G is the subgroup of Homeo_+[0, 1] consisting of piecewise
    linear functions with finitely many pieces, breakpoints in Z[tau], and
    slopes in tau^Z, where tau = (sqrt(5) - 1) / 2.

    This group is known as the golden mean Thompson's group, F_tau.

    The abelianization of this group, Ab(G), is known to be isomorphic to Z^2
    (the direct product of two copies of the integers). This is a result from
    the theory of Thompson's groups.

    Ab(G) is isomorphic to Z^2.

    The rank 'r' of an abelian group is the dimension of its tensor product with Q,
    which corresponds to the number of Z summands in its free part.
    For Z^2, the rank is 2.

    The torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order.
    For Z^2, the only element of finite order is the identity (0, 0).
    The order 't' of the torsion subgroup is its size, which is 1.

    Therefore, the pair (r, t) is (2, 1).
