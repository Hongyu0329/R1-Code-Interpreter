    "Here is a plan to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$:\n1.  I will start by representing the complex number $z$ in its Cartesian form, $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.\n2.  The right side of the equation, $i^z$, involves complex exponentiation. This is defined as $i^z = e^{z \\log i}$. The logarithm of $i$ is multi-valued: $\\log i = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\n3.  I will substitute $z=x+yi$ and the expression for $i^z$ back into the original equation. This results in an equation between two complex numbers.\n4.  By equating the real and imaginary parts of this equation, I will obtain a system of two real equations in terms of $x$ and $y$.\n5.  I will solve this system to find the possible values for $x$ and $y$.\n    *   I'll first test for real solutions (where $y=0$) and find that $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are solutions.\n    *   Next, I'll test for purely imaginary solutions (where $x=0$). This leads to a transcendental equation for $y$ that depends on the integer $k$. I will find that this equation only has real solutions for $y$ when $k$ is a negative integer ($k=-1, -2, -3, \\dots$).\n6.  Since the transcendental equation for $y$ cannot be solved analytically with elementary functions, I will write a Python script to find its roots numerically.\n7.  The final Python code will print the two real solutions and then compute and print the first few purely imaginary solutions, presenting each solution within the context of the original equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\n\ndef solve_for_y(k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Numerically solves the transcendental equation -y = exp(-y*(pi/2 + 2*k*pi)) for y.\n    This equation has real solutions for y only for k < 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k >= 0:\n        return None\n    \n    # The constant in the exponent\n    beta_k = np.pi/2 + 2*k*np.pi\n    \n    # The function whose root we want to find: f(y) = y + exp(-y * beta_k)\n    func_to_solve = lambda y: y + np.exp(-y * beta_k)\n    \n    # For k < 0, beta_k is negative.
