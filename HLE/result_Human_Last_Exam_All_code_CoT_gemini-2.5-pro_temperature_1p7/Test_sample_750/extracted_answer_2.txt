The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions $z=iy_k$ for $k=-1, -2, -3, \dots$, where $y_k$ is the solution to the equation $-y=e^{-y(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi)}$. The first few of these imaginary solutions are approximately $z \approx -0.354174i$, $z \approx -0.160473i$, and $z \approx -0.098808i$.
