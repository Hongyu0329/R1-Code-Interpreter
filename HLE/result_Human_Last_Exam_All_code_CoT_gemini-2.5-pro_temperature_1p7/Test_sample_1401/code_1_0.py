# The question asks for the minimum number of queries (Q) for a Statistical Query (SQ)
# algorithm to learn a specific class of functions: poly(d)-sized two-hidden-layer
# ReLU networks.
#
# According to seminal results in computational learning theory, this problem is
# computationally hard. There exist functions that are representable by such networks
# but are constructed to be indistinguishable by any SQ algorithm making fewer than
# a super-polynomial number of queries.
#
# The established lower bound for this problem is exponential in a polynomial of the
# input dimension 'd'. We will now print this formula.

# Define the components of the mathematical expression for the lower bound.
# The formula is Q >= exp(d^Ω(1)).
base_function = "exp"
dimension_variable = "d"
asymptotic_notation = "Ω"
constant_number = 1

# Print the final equation for the lower bound on the number of queries Q.
# The use of Ω(1) in the exponent of d means the exponent is some polynomial in d
# that grows at least as fast as d^a for some constant a > 0.
