    "This is a question from the field of topology, a branch of mathematics. The answer is based on a well-known classification theorem. A planar continuum is a set in the 2D plane that is compact, connected, and contains more than one point (non-degenerate), or it can be a single point (degenerate). A space is homogeneous if it \"looks the same\" from every point.\n\nThe classification theorem for homogeneous planar continua states that any such object is topologically equivalent (homeomorphic) to one of a very small number of specific shapes. My plan is to list these known classes and then use a simple Python script to count them.\n\nThe distinct homeomorphism classes are:\n1.  **The point:** This is the only degenerate homogeneous planar continuum.\n2.  **The circle:** The simple closed curve.\n3.  **The pseudo-arc:** A fascinating, snake-like continuum that is indecomposable.\n4.  **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** A continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged in a circle.\n\nThe script will count these four classes.\n\n```python\ndef count_homeomorphism_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function lists and counts the known homeomorphism classes of\n    homogeneous planar continua based on the classification theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to the mathematical classification theorem, these are the only classes.\n    classes = {\n        \"The point\": 1,\n        \"The circle\": 1,\n        \"The pseudo-arc\": 1,\n        \"The circle of pseudo-arcs\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"The distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua are:\")\n    for class_name in classes.keys():\n        print(f\"- {class_name}\")\n\n    # The total number is the sum of these distinct classes.\n    # The user asked to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We represent this by summing 1 for each class.\n    class_counts = list(classes.values())\n    total_count = sum(class_counts)\n\n    # Building the equation string: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, class_counts))\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe total number is found by summing the count of each class:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result.\ncount_homeomorphism_classes()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
