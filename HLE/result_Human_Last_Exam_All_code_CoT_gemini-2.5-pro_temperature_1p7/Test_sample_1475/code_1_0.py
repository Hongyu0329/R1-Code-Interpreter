    This function explains and prints the solution to the topological problem.
    The problem is solved by identifying the properties of the space P(X)
    and then applying theorems from descriptive set theory.

    The argument proceeds in four steps as outlined in the explanation above:
    1. Characterize P(X): It's the space of infinite closed sets with one limit point.
    2. Properties of P(X): It is a non-empty perfect Polish space.
    3. The intersection G: It's a dense G_delta subset of P(X).
    4. Cardinality of G: Any non-empty G_delta subset of a perfect Polish space
       has the cardinality of the continuum.

    # This is represented as 2 raised to the power of aleph-null (the cardinality
    # of the set of natural numbers).
    # The numbers in the expression are 2 and 0 (for aleph_0).
