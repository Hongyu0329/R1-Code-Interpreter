    1. The reaction aims to form (2-bromo-4-chlorophenyl)boronic acid. The key reagents are {reagent_1_eq} eq. of n-BuLi and {reagent_2_eq} eq. of trimethyl borate.

    2. The observation of {observation} indicates that more than one boron-containing product is being formed.

    3. The desired product, a boronic acid (Ar-B(OH)2), should give one signal. The likely byproduct is a borinic acid (Ar2-B(OH)), formed when two aryllithium molecules react with one boron atom. This happens via the following undesired side-reaction:
       
       Ar-Li (intermediate) + Ar-B(OMe)2 (product intermediate) -> Ar2-B(OMe) (byproduct intermediate)

    4. The challenge is to prevent this second addition.
