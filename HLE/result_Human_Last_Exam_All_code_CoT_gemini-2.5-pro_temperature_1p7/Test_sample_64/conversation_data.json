    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」, I will use a Python script to explain and visualize the pattern.\n\nThe word 「弟」 is read as 「おとうと」 (otouto). The script will:\n1.  Identify the correct pitch accent pattern for 「おとうと」.\n2.  Describe the characteristics of this pattern.\n3.  Provide a simple visual representation of the pitch change using 'L' for Low and 'H' for High for each mora (syllabic unit).\n\n```python\ndef explain_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and visualizes the pitch accent pattern for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_kanji = \"弟\"\n    word_kana = \"おとうと\"\n    morae = [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"]\n    pattern_name = \"Heiban (平板)\"\n    pattern_code = \"[0]\"\n\n    print(f\"The word is 「{word_kanji}」, which is read as 「{word_kana}」.\")\n    print(f\"The standard pitch accent for this word is known as {pattern_name}, indicated by the notation {pattern_code}.\")\n    print(\"\\nIn a Heiban (flat) pattern:\")\n    print(\"1. The first mora is pronounced with a low pitch.\")\n    print(\"2. The pitch rises on the second mora and stays high for the rest of the word.\")\n    print(\"3. A particle following the word will also maintain the high pitch.\")\n\n    # Generate visual representation of the pitch\n    pitch = [\"L\"] + [\"H\"] * (len(morae) - 1)\n    \n    # Create the output string\n    visual_pattern_word = []\n    for i in range(len(morae)):\n        visual_pattern_word.append(f\"{morae[i]}({pitch[i]})\")\n        \n    particle = \"が\"\n    particle_pitch = \"H\"\n    \n    print(\"\\nVisual Pitch Pattern:\")\n    print(f\"Word by itself: {' '.join(visual_pattern_word)}\")\n    print(f\"Word with a particle: {' '.join(visual_pattern_word)} {particle}({particle_pitch})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nConclusion: The correct pattern is Heiban.\")\n\nexplain_pitch_accent()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
