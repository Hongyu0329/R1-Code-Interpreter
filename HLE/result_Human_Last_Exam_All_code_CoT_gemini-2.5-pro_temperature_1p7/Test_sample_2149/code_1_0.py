# Based on the clues, we have determined the values of Y1 and Y4.
Y1 = 1859
Y4 = 707

# The task is to calculate "Y4 to the Y1".
# This is interpreted as Y4 raised to the power of Y1.
# The number is extremely large, so we will print the equation itself as requested.
# "remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"

# To demonstrate the scale, we can calculate and print the number of digits in the result.
# Note: This part is for context and the core answer is printing the equation itself.
