# The final answer is composed of three numbers derived from the chemical synthesis description.

# Question 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
# Compound 11 (4 carbons) is split into two 2-carbon fragments. One fragment is used.
# Equation: 4 / 2 = 2
carbons_from_11_in_1 = 2

# Question 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
# Compound 11 (2 oxygens) is split into two fragments, each containing one original oxygen.
# Equation: 2 / 2 = 1
oxygens_from_11_in_14 = 1

# Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
# Compound 10 has 1 nitrogen, which is conserved in compound 7.
# The number of common nitrogen atoms is 1.
# Equation: 1
nitrogens_common_to_7_and_10 = 1

# The final answer as three numbers, separated by commas.
