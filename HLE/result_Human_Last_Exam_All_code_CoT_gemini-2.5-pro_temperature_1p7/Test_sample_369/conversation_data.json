    "I will scan the provided Latin hexameter line.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will present the original Latin line.\n2.  I will then show the line with the six feet separated by a `|` symbol. This will also mark elisions (where a final vowel/-m is dropped before a word starting with a vowel/h) with parentheses `()`.\n3.  I will analyze each foot individually, explaining how its pattern of long (-) and short (u) syllables results in it being a dactyl (-- u u) or a spondee (-- --).\n4.  Finally, I will print the scansion pattern using \"D\" for dactyls and \"S\" for spondees for all six feet.\n\nThe scansion relies on determining syllable length based on three main rules:\n*   A syllable is long if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong (e.g., `ā`, `ae`).\n*   A syllable is long \"by position\" if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants.\n*   Otherwise, a syllable is short.\n\nThis particular line contains several elisions and a known poetic license, which I will explain in the analysis.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans a specific line of Latin hexameter, explains the scansion foot by foot,\n    and provides the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    \n    # The line divided into its six metrical feet, with elisions noted.\n    # Note: ver(um) elides with ubi; ub(i) elides with equi; atqu(e) elides with hominis.\n    # The final 't' of 'convenit' does not elide with 'imago'.\n    divided_line = \"vēr(um) ŭb(i) ĕ|quī āt|qu(e) hōmĭnĭs| cāsū cōn|vēnĭt ĭ|māgō\"\n    # An alternative and more standard foot division is often cited for this difficult line,\n    # which is used for the analysis below.\n    foot_1_text = \"ver(um) ub(i) e-\"\n    foot_2_text = \"-qui at-\"\n    foot_3_text = \"-qu(e) homi-\"\n    foot_4_text = \"-nis cā-\"\n    foot_5_text = \"-sū cōnve-\"\n    foot_6_text = \"-nit imāgō\"\n    \n    # Analysis of each foot\n    analysis = [\n        (\"Foot 1: Dactyl (-- u u)\", f\"'{foot_1_text}' scans as 'vē-r(um) u-b(i) e-'. `vēr-` is long. `u-` (from ubi) and `e-` (from equi after elision) are both short.\"),\n        (\"Foot 2: Spondee (-- --)\", f\"'{foot_2_text}' scans as `quī at-`. `quī` is long by nature. `at-` (from atque) is long by position.\"),\n        (\"Foot 3: Dactyl (-- u u)\", f\"'{foot_3_text}' scans as `-qu(e) ho-mi-`. `que` elides. `ho-` is treated as long by poetic license, while `mi-` and `-nis` are short.\"),\n        (\"Foot 4: Spondee (-- --)\", f\"'{foot_4_text}' scans as `-nis cā-`.
