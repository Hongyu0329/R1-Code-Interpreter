    "Based on scientific literature, specifically the 2002 description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull by Sues et al., we can determine the number of depressions in its lacrimal recess. The task is to provide this number using a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will establish the number of depressions from the known paleontological data. The lacrimal recess is described as containing two fossae (depressions).\n2.  I will store this number in a Python variable.\n3.  To fulfill the requirement of showing a \"final equation,\" I will construct a simple identity multiplication (e.g., 1 * 2 = 2).\n4.  The script will then print a descriptive sentence stating the answer and the trivial equation used to present it.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_lacrimal_recess_depressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri.\n\n    This information is based on paleontological findings, specifically the\n    description by Sues et al. (2002), which notes the presence of two\n    depressions (fossae) within the lacrimal recess. This script presents\n    this factual data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of depressions as documented in scientific literature.\n    num_depressions = 2\n\n    # A factor for the required equation format.\n    factor = 1\n\n    # Calculate the result for the equation.\n    result = factor * num_depressions\n\n    # Print the answer in a full sentence.\n    print(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {result} depressions.\")\n\n    # Print the equation as requested.\n    print(f\"Final equation: {factor} * {num_depressions} = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_lacrimal_recess_depressions()\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
