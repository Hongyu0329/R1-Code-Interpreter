    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by first finding the steady-state probabilities of the system. The steady-state probabilities, denoted as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, are the long-term probabilities of the system being in state $i$. At steady state, the probabilities do not change over time, which means their derivatives $P_i'(t)$ are equal to zero.\n\nBy setting all the derivatives in the Kolmogorov-Chepmen system of equations to zero, we transform the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n4.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\nNote that the original four differential equations are linearly dependent, so we discard one (the second one) and use the normalization condition (equation 4 above) to have a determined system.\n\nFrom these equations, we can express $p_0$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ in terms of $p_1$:\n- From (1), $p_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} p_1$\n- From (2), $p_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} p_1$\n- From (3), $p_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} p_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} \\right) p_1$\n\nBy substituting the given values for the $\\lambda$ parameters, we can see that the relationships simplify significantly. The following Python code will perform these calculations step-by-step, showing the derivation and the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Define the transition rates from the problem description\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# Explain the setup for finding the steady-state probabilities p_i\nprint(\"Step 1: Set up the steady-state equations by setting the derivatives to zero.\")\nprint(\"The resulting linear equations are:\")\nprint(f\"  (1) 0 = -{lambda_01}*p0 + {lambda_10}*p1\")\nprint(f\"  (2) 0 = {lambda_12}*p1 - ({lambda_21} + {lambda_23})*p2\")\nprint(f\"  (3) 0 = {lambda_23}*p2 - {lambda_31}*p3\")\nprint(\"  (4) p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1 (Normalization condition)\\n\")\n\n# Explain the process of solving the system\nprint(\"Step 2: Solve for p0, p2, and p3 in terms of p1.\")\n# Calculate the ratios\nratio_0_1 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\nlambda_21_plus_23 = lambda_21 + lambda_23\nratio_2_1 = lambda_12 / lambda_21_plus_23\nratio_3_2 = lambda_23 / lambda_31\nratio_3_1 = ratio_3_2 * ratio_2_1\n\nprint(f\"From (1), p0 = ({lambda_10}/{lambda_01})*p1 = {ratio_0_1:.4f}*p1\")\nprint(f\"From (2), p2 = ({lambda_12}/({lambda_21}+{lambda_23}))*p1 = ({lambda_12}/{lambda_21_plus_23})*p1 = {ratio_2_1:.4f}*p1\")\nprint(f\"From (3), p3 = ({lambda_23}/{lambda_31})*p2 = {ratio_3_2:.4f}*p2.
