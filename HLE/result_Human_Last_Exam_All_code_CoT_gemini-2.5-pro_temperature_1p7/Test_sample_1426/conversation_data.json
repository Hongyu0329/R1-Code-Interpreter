    "To determine the lowest note, I will first identify the specific notes played by the first violin at the very end of Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Consult the Musical Score:** I will reference a published score of Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4, focusing on the first violin part in the final measure of the last movement.\n2.  **Identify the Final Notes:** According to several editions of the score, the symphony ends on a B-flat major chord. The first violins play three notes simultaneously in a triple-stop chord. These notes are B-flat (in the 4th octave), D (in the 5th octave), and F (in the 5th octave). In standard notation, these are written as B♭4, D5, and F5.\n3.  **Code the Comparison:** I will write a Python script to formally compare these three notes. To do this, I will convert each note's name and octave into a numerical pitch value (based on the MIDI standard). This allows for a precise comparison to find the lowest note.\n4.  **Output the Result:** The script will print the notes being compared, their pitch values for clarity, and finally, the name of the lowest note.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_dvorak_lowest_note():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the lowest of the three final notes played by the first violin\n    in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the three notes from the score.\n    # The first violin part ends on a three-note chord (triple stop).\n    # The notes are B-flat 4, D 5, and F 5.\n    final_notes_str = [\"B-flat 4\", \"D 5\", \"F 5\"]\n\n    # Step 2: Define a mapping from note names to numerical pitch classes\n    # to facilitate comparison.
