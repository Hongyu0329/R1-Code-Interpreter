Derivation of the Solution:

1.  The position of the walk at time n, denoted S_n, is a random process on the integer lattice Z^d. The walk starts at the origin, S_0 = 0.

2.  The defining characteristic of the process is that at each step n, the controller chooses a probability measure nu_{i_n} from a given set {nu_1, ..., nu_k}. The next step X_n = S_n - S_{n-1} is drawn from this chosen measure. Since each measure nu_i has a mean of 0, the expected value of any step is E[X_n] = 0, regardless of the choice made by the controller.

3.  A key insight is that the sequence of positions S_n forms a martingale. A martingale is a process where the expectation of the next value, given the entire history, is the current value. Formally, E[S_n | S_0, ..., S_{n-1}] = S_{n-1}. This holds true for our controlled walk because the expected increment is always zero, irrespective of the control strategy.

4.  The problem is specified for dimension d >= 3. A fundamental result in probability theory, proved by PÃ³lya for simple random walks and extended by Kaimanovich and others to more general cases including controlled walks, establishes that random walks with zero-mean increments in dimensions d >= 3 are transient.

5.  Transience implies that the walk returns to its starting point with a probability strictly less than 1. In fact, it almost surely drifts away, with its distance from the origin tending to infinity. This property holds for *any* valid control strategy because the martingale nature of the walk cannot be changed by the controller.

6.  The question asks for the maximal integer k such that, for any choice of k measures, it's not possible to guarantee a return to the origin. To "guarantee" a return would mean having a strategy that makes the walk recurrent (returns to the origin with probability 1).

7.  Based on the theorem mentioned above, for any number of measures k >= 1 and any specific set of such measures, the walk is always transient. Therefore, it is never possible to guarantee a return to the origin.

8.  This means the condition in the question ("not able to guarantee ... return") is true for k=1, for k=2, for k=3, and so on, for all positive integers k.

9.  The set of integers k for which the condition holds is {1, 2, 3, ...}. This set is unbounded and has no maximum element. Therefore, the maximal value of k is infinity.
