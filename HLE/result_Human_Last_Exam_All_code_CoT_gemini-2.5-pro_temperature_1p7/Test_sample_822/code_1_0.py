    Analyzes the patient's clinical case to determine the most likely underlying disease.
    The patient presents with:
    - Chronic Phase: Polyarthritis, constitutional symptoms, confusion, bruising, and pulmonary nodules.
    - Treatment: Started on steroids, indicating a suspected inflammatory condition.
    - Acute Phase: Becomes severely ill with a pulmonary and cutaneous infection after travel.
    - Key Diagnostic Clue: The infection is resistant to aminoglycoside therapy.

    Conclusion:
    The initial systemic symptoms and pulmonary nodules strongly suggest a systemic vasculitis like
    Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA). This condition, along with steroid treatment,
    causes severe immunosuppression, predisposing the patient to opportunistic infections
    like Nocardiosis, which is resistant to aminoglycosides.
