# The reasoning for the solution is explained in the text above.
# This script prints the final answer based on that analysis.

# The correct choices are those that are necessarily compact.
# C: A finite set is compact.
# G: A convergent sequence including its limit is compact.
# J: A closed interval [a, b] is compact.
