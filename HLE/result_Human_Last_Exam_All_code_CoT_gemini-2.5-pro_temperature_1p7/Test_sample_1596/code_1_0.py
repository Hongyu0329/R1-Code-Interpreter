Here is a step-by-step analysis of each statement about Quaternion RoPE:

The proposed Quaternion RoPE operates on a 4D vector v (as a quaternion) at position m via left-multiplication by a rotation quaternion R_m.
R_m = cos(mθ) + û * sin(mθ), where û is a fixed unit vector axis.

A) The inner product ⟨R_m(q), R_n(k)⟩ depends only on |m-n|
   - Analysis: The inner product can be transformed: ⟨R_m(q), R_n(k)⟩ = ⟨R_{m-n}(q), k⟩. This expression depends on the relative position `m-n`. It is not guaranteed to be an even function of `m-n`, so it does not depend on just the absolute value |m-n|.
   - Verdict: FALSE.

B) R_m(q)R_n(k) = R_{m+p}(q)R_{n+p}(k) for any p
   - Analysis: This is (R_m*q)*(R_n*k) = (R_{m+p}*q)*(R_{n+p}*k). This equality does not hold in general. For p=1, m=0, n=0, it would imply q*k = (R_1*q)*(R_1*k), which is false.
   - Verdict: FALSE.

C) The rotation axis (u_1,u_2,u_3) must be fixed for all positions
   - Analysis: The key property ⟨R_m(q), R_n(k)⟩ = ⟨R_{m-n}(q), k⟩ relies on the fact that rotations R_m and R_n commute. They only commute if they are generated by the same axis û. Therefore, the axis must be fixed for all positions m to maintain this RoPE-like property.
   - Verdict: TRUE.

D) Quaternion RoPE can encode 3D relative positions with a single rotation
   - Analysis: The scheme is defined by a single integer position 'm', which maps a 1D sequence position to a rotation. It cannot represent or distinguish relative positions in 3D space.
   - Verdict: FALSE.

E) The magnitude |R_m(v)| equals |v| for all m
   - Analysis: The norm of a product of quaternions is the product of their norms: |R_m * v| = |R_m| * |v|. R_m is a unit quaternion because |R_m|² = cos²(mθ) + |û|²sin²(mθ) = cos²(mθ) + sin²(mθ) = 1. Therefore, |R_m(v)| = 1 * |v| = |v|.
   - Verdict: TRUE.

F) R_m(αv) = αR_m(v) for scalar α
   - Analysis: This is R_m * (αv). Real scalars like α commute with all quaternions. So R_m * (αv) = α * (R_m * v).
   - Verdict: TRUE.

G) The quaternion rotation preserves orthogonality between vectors
   - Analysis: The transformation v -> R_m*v is an isometry (it preserves norms and distances). All isometries on a vector space preserve the inner product. If ⟨p, q⟩=0, then ⟨R_m(p), R_m(q)⟩ = ⟨p, q⟩ = 0.
   - Verdict: TRUE.

H) The composition R_m ∘ R_n equals R_{m+n}
   - Analysis: (R_m ∘ R_n)(v) = R_m * (R_n * v) = (R_m * R_n) * v. Since R_m and R_n are rotations about the same axis, their product is equivalent to a single rotation with the sum of the angles: R_m * R_n = R_{m+n}.
   - Verdict: TRUE.

J) For any quaternion vector v, (R_m ∘ R_n)(v) - R_n(R_m(v)) is always purely imaginary
   - Analysis: This expression is (R_m*R_n - R_n*R_m)*v. As established in (H), R_m and R_n commute, so their commutator (R_m*R_n - R_n*R_m) is the zero quaternion. The result is 0*v = 0. The zero quaternion has a real part of 0, so it is purely imaginary.
   - Verdict: TRUE.

K) The double quaternion rotation R_m(R_n(v)) preserves the real component of v regardless of m,n
   - Analysis: The operation is R_{m+n}(v). The resulting real part is Re(v)cos((m+n)θ) - (û·Vec(v))sin((m+n)θ). This is generally not equal to Re(v).
   - Verdict: FALSE.

L) The trace of the 4×4 matrix representation of R_m equals 4cos(mθ)
   - Analysis: The 4x4 matrix for left-multiplication by a quaternion q = a + bi + cj + dk has the real part 'a' on all four diagonal elements. The trace is the sum of the diagonal, which is 4a. For R_m, the real part is a = cos(mθ).
   - Verdict: TRUE.

M) The commutator [R_m, R_n] = 0 if and only if the rotation axis is parallel to (1,1,1)
   - Analysis: The commutator [R_m, R_n] is always 0 because they share the same axis, regardless of what that axis is. The "only if" condition is false, making the entire statement false.
   - Verdict: FALSE.

N) For any unit quaternion v, lim_{m→∞} |R_m(v)| converges to 1/√2
   - Analysis: From (E), we know |R_m(v)| = |v|. For a unit quaternion v, |v|=1. The magnitude is constant at 1 for all m, so the limit is 1.
   - Verdict: FALSE.
