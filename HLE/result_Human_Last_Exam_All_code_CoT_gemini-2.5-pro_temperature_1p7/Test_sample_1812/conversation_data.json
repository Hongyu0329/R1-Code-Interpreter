    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to compute the determinant of the given matrix:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The goal is to compute the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix `A`. The term \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is contextual information about the origin of the matrix but is not needed for the calculation itself, as the matrix is explicitly provided. The core task is to calculate the determinant and show the steps.\n2.  **Determinant Formula:** For a 3x3 matrix\n    \\[ M = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    the determinant is calculated as: `det(M) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n3.  **Python Script Plan:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n    *   The script will first define the given matrix `A`.\n    *   It will then print the matrix.\n    *   To fulfill the requirement \"output each number in the final equation\", the script will print each step of the determinant calculation by substituting the numbers from matrix `A` into the formula.\n    *   Finally, the script will print the final computed value of the determinant.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem asks to compute the determinant of a given matrix A.\n# The matrix is the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver.\n# A = [[2, -1, -1],\n#      [-1, 2, -1],\n#      [-1, -1, 2]]\n# The information m_1/2 = 13 is context and not required for the calculation.\n\n# Define the matrix A\nA = np.array([[2, -1, -1],\n              [-1, 2, -1],\n              [-1, -1, 2]])\n\n# Print the matrix\nprint(\"The given adjacency matrix A is:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the determinant of A step by step.\")\nprint(\"The formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix [a,b,c; d,e,f; g,h,i] is: a(e*i - f*h) - b(d*i - f*g) + c(d*h - e*g)\")\n\n# Extract elements for clarity in the printout\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Step 1: Substitute the numbers into the formula\nprint(f\"\\nStep 1: Substitute numbers from A into the formula\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {a} * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n\n# Step 2: Perform calculations within the parentheses\nprint(f\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the products inside the parentheses\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {a} * ({e*i} - {f*h}) - ({b}) * ({d*i} - {f*g}) + ({c}) * ({d*h} - {e*g})\")\n\n# Step 3: Simplify the expressions inside the parentheses\nprint(f\"\\nStep 3: Simplify the subtraction inside the parentheses\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {a} * ({e*i - f*h}) - ({b}) * ({d*i - f*g}) + ({c}) * ({d*h - e*g})\")\n\n# Step 4: Perform the multiplication\nprint(f\"\\nStep 4: Perform the multiplications\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {a * (e*i - f*h)} - {b * (d*i - f*g)} + {c * (d*h - e*g)}\")\n\n# Step 5: Final addition and subtraction\nprint(f\"\\nStep 5: Perform the final addition and subtraction\")\nfinal_det = a * (e*i - f*h) - b * (d*i - f*g) + c * (d*h - e*g)\nprint(f\"det(A) = {a * (e*i - f*h)} - {b * (d*i - f*g)} - {abs(c * (d*h - e*g))}\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {final_det}\")\n\n\n# Final Answer\nprint(f\"\\nThe determinant of the matrix is: {final_det}\")\n\n```\n<<<0>>>"
