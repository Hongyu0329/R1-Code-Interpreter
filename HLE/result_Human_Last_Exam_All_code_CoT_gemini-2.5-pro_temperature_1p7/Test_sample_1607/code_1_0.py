def solve_quantum_symmetries():
    """
    This function determines the correct statements based on principles of quantum mechanics.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    A: False. Generators can have continuous spectra (e.g., momentum).
    B1: True. This is a known physical principle connecting scale invariance and 1/r^2 potentials.
    B2: False. The scaling factors and signs are incorrect.
    C: False. The condition is both necessary and sufficient.
    D: True. A direct consequence of [Ï„, H] = 0.
    E: True. This is the definition of the rotation operator.
    F: True. This is a result of Ehrenfest's theorem for any state.
    G: True. The premise is always true, and the conclusion is a fundamental property of symmetry generators.
    H: False. Unbounded operators can have discrete spectra (e.g., the SHO Hamiltonian).
    I: True. A direct consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for non-commuting generators.
    J: True. A direct consequence of [S, H] = 0.

    The correct statements are B1, D, E, F, G, I, J.
