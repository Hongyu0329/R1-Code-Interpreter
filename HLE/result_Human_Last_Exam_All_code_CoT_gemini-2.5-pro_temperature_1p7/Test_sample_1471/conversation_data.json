    "First, I need to understand the equation provided. The equation uses a mix of Roman and Babylonian Cuneiform numerals.\n\n1.  **Decode the numerals:**\n    *   `XXIV`: This is a Roman numeral. `XX` represents 20 and `IV` represents 4. So, `XXIV` is 24.\n    *   `𒌋𒌋𒌋`: This is a Babylonian Cuneiform numeral. The symbol `𒌋` represents 10. Three of these symbols together (`10 + 10 + 10`) equal 30.\n    *   `𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹`: This is also a Babylonian Cuneiform numeral. `𒌋` is 10 and `𒁹` is 1. Two `𒌋`s and three `𒁹`s (`10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1`) equal 23.\n\n2.  **Formulate the equation:**\n    After converting the numerals to modern numbers, the equation becomes: `24 / 30 - 23 = ?`\n\n3.  **Plan the code:**\n    I will write a Python script to solve this equation. The script will:\n    *   Assign the decoded numbers (24, 30, and 23) to variables.\n    *   Calculate the result of the expression.\n    *   Print the full equation in modern numbers along with its solution.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the equation:\n\n```python\n# The equation provided is XXIV / 𒌋𒌋𒌋 - 𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 = ?\n# We first convert these ancient numerals to modern numbers.\n\n# XXIV (Roman) = 24\nnum1 = 24\n# 𒌋𒌋𒌋 (Babylonian Cuneiform) = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30\nnum2 = 30\n# 𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 (Babylonian Cuneiform) = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23\nnum3 = 23\n\n# Now, we solve the equation with the modern numbers.\nresult = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# Print the final equation with the solution.\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-22.2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
