    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Question:** The question asks for the \"exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori\" of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$. In the context of algebraic groups over finite fields, this is standard terminology for the number of **$G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes** of such tori. The total number of individual tori would be a complex polynomial in $q$, whereas the number of classes is a constant integer, which fits the phrasing \"the exact number\". We will assume $G$ is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, which is the standard case unless specified otherwise.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Theorem:** There is a fundamental theorem that classifies the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori. For a split reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, these classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Weyl Group:** For a group $G$ of type $E_8$, the corresponding Weyl group is denoted as $W(E_8)$.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Conjugacy Classes:** The problem is now reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This is a well-known result from the theory of reflection groups and Lie algebras. The number of conjugacy classes for $W(E_8)$ has been computed to be 112.\n\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that explains this reasoning and prints the final numerical answer, explicitly stating the equality mentioned in the theorem.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8.\n\n    This function explains the mathematical reasoning and prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem asks for the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G of type E_8.\n    # We interpret this as the number of G(F_q)-conjugacy classes of such tori, which is a constant independent of q for a split group.\n    \n    # Theorem: For a split reductive group G over a finite field F_q, the number of\n    # G(F_q)-conjugacy classes of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the\n    # number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group W.\n    \n    # For a group of type E_8, the Weyl group is W(E_8).\n    \n    # The number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W(E_8) is a known mathematical constant.\n    # This result can be found in the literature on Lie groups and reflection groups,\n    # for example, in R.W.
