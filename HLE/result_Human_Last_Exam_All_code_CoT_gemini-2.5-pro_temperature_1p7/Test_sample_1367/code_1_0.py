    # Answer to part (a): Is V(p) simple for all p in Z_>=1?
    # The vertex algebra V(p), also known as the triplet algebra W(p), is known to be
    # non-simple for all integers p >= 1. Its simple quotient is the algebra W_p.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Answer to part (b): If a non-trivial ideal exists in V(p), what condition must be met?
    # An ideal in a vertex algebra V is by definition a module over V. Since the affine Lie
    # algebra L_k(sl_2) is a subalgebra of V(p), any ideal must also be an L_k(sl_2)-module.
    # In highest-weight theory, any such non-trivial submodule (ideal) must be generated by
    # a singular vector. Therefore, both conditions hold: the ideal must be a module for
    # L_k(sl_2) and it must contain a singular vector.
    answer_b = "Both"

    # Answer to part (c): Does the simplicity of V(p) imply it is also irreducible
    # as an L_k(sl_2)-module?
    # Simplicity of a vertex algebra does not, in general, imply its irreducibility as a module
    # over a subalgebra. The simple quotient W_p = V(p)/I is a simple VOA, but it is a
    # reducible module over the Virasoro algebra contained within L_k(sl_2). This provides a
    # clear counterexample.
    answer_c = "No"
