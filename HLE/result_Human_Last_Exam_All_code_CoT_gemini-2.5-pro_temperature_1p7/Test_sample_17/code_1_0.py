    print("Let J be a functional on the Wasserstein space P(R^d).")
    print("We need to prove that if J has a non-empty regular super-differential at a point μ,")
    print("then either its sub-differential is empty or J is differentiable at μ.")

    print("\n2. Logical Equivalence")
    print("This statement is equivalent to showing that if both the sub-differential ∂J(μ)")
    print("and the regular super-differential ∂⁺J(μ) are non-empty, then J must be")
    print("differentiable at μ.")

    print("\n3. Mathematical Framework")
    print("The tangent space T_μ to the Wasserstein space at μ is a Hilbert space. Its elements")
    print("can be identified with (the closure of) gradient vector fields.")
    print("Let's assume ∂J(μ) and ∂⁺J(μ) are non-empty. Let ξ ∈ ∂J(μ) and ζ ∈ ∂⁺J(μ).")
    print("The 'regularity' condition ensures that both ξ and ζ belong to the tangent space T_μ.")

    print("\n4. The Core Argument")
    print("By the definitions of sub- and super-differentials, for any tangent vector v ∈ T_μ,")
    print("the following inequalities for the directional derivatives of J hold:")
    print("  <ξ, v>_μ  ≤  (Directional Derivative)  ≤  <ζ, v>_μ")
    print("This directly implies: <ξ - ζ, v>_μ ≤ 0.")
    print("Since T_μ is a vector space, this must also hold for -v:")
    print("  <ξ - ζ, -v>_μ ≤ 0  =>  <ξ - ζ, v>_μ ≥ 0.")

    print("\n5. The Final Equation")
    print("Combining both inequalities, we find that for any vector v in the tangent space T_μ,")
    print("the inner product must be exactly zero:")
    print("  <ξ - ζ, v>_μ = 0")
    print("This means the vector (ξ - ζ) is orthogonal to the entire space T_μ.")

    print("\n6. Conclusion from Hilbert Space Theory")
    print("Since ξ and ζ are in T_μ, their difference (ξ - ζ) is also in T_μ.")
    print("In a Hilbert space, the only vector that belongs to the space and is also orthogonal")
    print("to the entire space is the zero vector. This leads to the final equation:")
