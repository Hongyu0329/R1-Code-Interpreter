    "The reaction of a polyhalogenated benzene with an excess of a Grignard reagent, such as phenyl magnesium bromide, results in the substitution of the halogen atoms with the aryl group from the Grignard reagent. The reactivity of the halogens in such nucleophilic substitution or cross-coupling reactions follows the order I > Br > Cl > F. Therefore, the iodine atom is the most reactive and will be replaced first, followed by the bromine atoms.\n\nIn the case of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene, the reaction with excess phenyl magnesium bromide proceeds as follows:\n1.  **First Substitution:** The most labile halogen, iodine, at the 2-position is replaced by a phenyl group.\n2.  **Second and Third Substitutions:** Since the phenyl magnesium bromide is in excess and the reaction is refluxed in THF, the conditions are sufficient to replace the two less reactive bromine atoms at the 1 and 3-positions with phenyl groups.\n\nThis series of substitutions results in a benzene ring with three phenyl groups attached at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe final product is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene. The aqueous work-up serves to quench any remaining Grignard reagent and protonate the magnesium salts, and does not alter the structure of the final organic product. The synthesis of terphenyls (a class of compounds with a central benzene ring substituted with two phenyl groups) and more highly substituted phenylbenzenes from polyhalobenzenes and Grignard reagents is a known method. Specifically, reactions with 1,2,3-trihalobenzenes and excess aryl Grignard reagents are used to synthesize *m*-terphenyl derivatives, which aligns with the formation of 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene in this case.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
