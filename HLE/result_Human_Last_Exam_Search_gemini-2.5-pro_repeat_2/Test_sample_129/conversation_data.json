    "There are three main categories of valid boolean expressions that can be formed using exactly 5 symbols.\n\n### Category 1: Expressions with 3 literals and 2 operators\nThese expressions have the form `L1 op1 L2 op2 L3`, where `L` is a literal (`T` or `F`) and `op` is a binary operator (`&` or `|`). Given the precedence `& > |`, parentheses are not needed.\n\n*   **`L1 & L2 & L3`**: This expression is true only if all three literals are `T`.\n    *   `T&T&T` (1 expression)\n*   **`L1 | L2 | L3`**: This expression is true if at least one literal is `T`. Out of the 8 possible combinations of literals, only `F|F|F` is false.\n    *   (7 expressions)\n*   **`L1 | L2 & L3`**: This is parsed as `L1 | (L2 & L3)`. It's true if `L1` is `T` (4 combinations) or if `L1` is `F` and `L2 & L3` is true (1 combination: `F|T&T`).\n    *   (5 expressions)\n*   **`L1 & L2 | L3`**: This is parsed as `(L1 & L2) | L3`. It's true if `L3` is `T` (4 combinations) or if `L3` is `F` and `L1 & L2` is true (1 combination: `T&T|F`).\n    *   (5 expressions)\n\nTotal for Category 1: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18** expressions.\n\n### Category 2: Expressions with 2 literals\nThese expressions combine two literals with operators and/or parentheses to make a 5-symbol string.\n\n*   **`(L op L)`**: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`. (4 expressions)\n*   **`!!L op L`**: `!!T&T`, `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`. (4 expressions)\n*   **`L op !!L`**: `T&!!T`, `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`. (4 expressions)\n*   **`!L op !L`**: `!F&!F`, `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`. (4 expressions)\n*   **`L op (L)`**: `T&(T)`, `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`. (4 expressions)\n*   **`(L) op L`**: `(T)&T`, `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`. (4 expressions)\n\nTotal for Category 2: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = **24** expressions.\n\n### Category 3: Expressions with 1 literal\nThese expressions use one literal and a combination of four other symbols (`!` and parentheses) to make a 5-symbol string.\n\n*   **`!!!!L`**: Only `!!!!T` is true. (1 expression)\n*   **`!!(L)`**: Only `!!(T)` is true. (1 expression)\n*   **`(!!L)`**: Only `(!!T)` is true. (1 expression)\n*   **`((L))`**: Only `((T))` is true. (1 expression)\n\nTotal for Category 3: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4** expressions.\n\n### Final Count\nThe total number of true boolean expressions is the sum of the counts from all categories:\n18 + 24 + 4 = 46.\n\n<<<46>>>"
