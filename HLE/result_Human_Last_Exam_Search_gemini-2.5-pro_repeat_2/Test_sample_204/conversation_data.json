    "The provided vector field describes a topological structure known as a toroidal hopfion. The Hopf charge, a topological invariant, can be determined from the winding numbers of the field.\n\nThe vector field is defined as:\n*   `f = atan2(y,x)`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`\n*   `G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))`\n*   `nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis is a standard representation of a hopfion, where the field's orientation is described by the angles `G` and `f`.\n\nThe Hopf charge for a toroidal hopfion is given by the product of three integers: `H = p * m * n`, where:\n*   `n` is the azimuthal winding number (how many times the field winds around the z-axis). The term `f = atan2(y,x)` represents the azimuthal angle, which completes one full rotation, meaning `n = 1`.\n*   `m` is the poloidal winding number (how many times the field winds through the \"hole\" of the torus). The function `G` ranges from `PI` at the core of the torus (where `r2` is 0) to 0 far away from the torus (where `r2` approaches infinity). This single, complete variation from `PI` to 0 corresponds to a poloidal winding number of `m = 1`.\n*   `p` is the polarity, which is related to the field's orientation at its core versus at infinity. This configuration has a polarity of `p = 1`.\n\nTherefore, the Hopf charge is the product of these winding numbers. A single, or fundamental, hopfion is characterized by its unit Hopf charge. The structure described, with winding numbers of 1 in both the toroidal and poloidal directions, is that of a fundamental hopfion.\n\nThe calculation gives a Hopf charge H = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
