    "To date, ten members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans.\n\nThe let-7 family of microRNAs is one of the most extensively studied and well-conserved families of these small regulatory molecules. In humans, this family consists of the following mature microRNAs:\n\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   miR-98\n*   miR-202\n\nThese ten mature miRNAs are derived from 13 precursor genes located on different chromosomes. While some sources may mention slightly different numbers, the consensus in the scientific literature points to ten distinct mature let-7 family members in humans. For instance, some publications might refer to at least nine members, including let-7a through let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98. Other studies have mentioned the existence of 11 or 12 members. The variation can sometimes be attributed to the distinction between precursor genes and the final mature miRNA molecules.\n\nThe let-7 family was one of the first groups of microRNAs to be discovered and is known to play a crucial role as a tumor suppressor by regulating cell proliferation and differentiation.\n\n<<<10>>>"
