    "For the supersymmetric sigma-model in symmetry class D with two replicas, the target space for the bosonic sector is the symmetric space Sp(2,2)/U(2). The number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables required to parametrize this space is determined by its rank.\n\nThe rank of the symmetric space Sp(2,2)/U(2) is 2. This means that the bosonic sector is parametrized by two variables. These are sometimes referred to as the bosonic angles, denoted as θB1 and θB2.\n\nTherefore, 2 non-Grassmann variables are needed.\n\n<<<2>>>"
