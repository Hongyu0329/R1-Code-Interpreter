    "There are several ways to define the \"sum\" of graphs. The maximal chromatic number of the resulting graph \\(G\\) depends on which definition of \"sum\" is used. Let's explore the most common interpretations:\n\n### 1. Tensor Product (or Categorical Product)\nIf the \"sum\" refers to the tensor product (\\(G = C_n \\times C_n \\times C_n\\)), then the chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is bounded by the minimum of the chromatic numbers of its factors. It is a known property that \\(\\chi(G_1 \\times G_2) \\leq \\min(\\chi(G_1), \\chi(G_2))\\).\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\(C_n\\) is:\n*   2 if \\(n\\) is even.\n*   3 if \\(n\\) is odd.\n\nTherefore, \\(\\chi(C_n \\times C_n \\times C_n) \\leq \\chi(C_n)\\).\n*   If \\(n\\) is even, \\(\\chi(G) \\leq 2\\). Since the graph is not empty, its chromatic number is 2.\n*   If \\(n\\) is odd, \\(\\chi(G) \\leq 3\\). In this case, the resulting graph is not bipartite, so its chromatic number is 3.\n\nThe maximal value under this interpretation is 3.\n\n### 2. Cartesian Product\nIf the \"sum\" refers to the Cartesian product (\\(G = C_n \\Box C_n \\Box C_n\\)), the chromatic number of the product is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its factors: \\(\\chi(G_1 \\Box G_2) = \\max(\\chi(G_1), \\chi(G_2))\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(\\chi(C_n \\Box C_n \\Box C_n) = \\chi(C_n)\\).\nThe maximal value for \\(\\chi(C_n)\\) is 3 (when \\(n\\) is odd). So, the maximal chromatic number under this interpretation is 3.\n\n### 3. Edge Union\nIf the \"sum\" refers to the union of the edge sets of three cycles on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices, the resulting graph \\(G\\) has \\(n\\) vertices and its maximum degree is at most 6.\n\nBy Brooks' Theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G)\\) unless \\(G\\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle. Here, \\(\\Delta(G) \\leq 6\\).\nIf \\(G\\) is a complete graph \\(K_n\\), its degree is \\(n-1\\). So we could have \\(n-1 \\leq 6\\), which implies \\(n \\leq 7\\).\nLet's check if we can form a \\(K_7\\) from the union of three \\(C_7\\)s. A complete graph \\(K_{2m+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(m\\) Hamiltonian cycles. For \\(K_7\\), we have \\(m=3\\), so it can be decomposed into 3 Hamiltonian cycles (which are \\(C_7\\)s). The union of these three \\(C_7\\)s is precisely \\(K_7\\).\nThe chromatic number of \\(K_7\\) is 7.\n\nThus, under the edge union interpretation, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n### 4. Graph Join\nThe join of graphs \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\), denoted \\(G_1 + G_2\\), is formed by taking disjoint copies of the graphs and adding all possible edges between the vertices of \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\). The chromatic number of a join is the sum of the chromatic numbers of its components: \\(\\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2)\\).\n\nIf the \"sum\" of three cycles refers to the join operation (\\(G = C_n + C_n + C_n\\)), its chromatic number is:\n\\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n)\\).\n\nTo maximize this value, we need to maximize \\(\\chi(C_n)\\). The maximum chromatic number for a cycle is 3, which occurs when \\(n\\) is odd.\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe interpretation of \"sum\" as the **graph join** yields the highest possible value. Given the request for the \"maximal\" chromatic number, this interpretation is the most likely intended one.\n\n<<<9>>>"
