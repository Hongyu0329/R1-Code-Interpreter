    "To determine how many edge squares would lack bishops, we first need to find the total number of edge squares and the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on them.\n\n1.  **Total Edge Squares:** An 8x8 chessboard has four sides. Each side has 8 squares, but the 4 corner squares are counted twice. Therefore, the total number of edge squares is (8 * 4) - 4 = 28 squares. These are made up of 14 light-colored squares and 14 dark-colored squares.\n\n2.  **Maximum Placed Bishops:** The goal is to place as many bishops as possible on these 28 squares so that no two bishops threaten each other. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on a standard 8x8 board is 14. This can be achieved by placing bishops only on the edge squares. A simple configuration to achieve this is to place bishops on all 8 squares of the top row and all the squares of the bottom row except for the two corners (6 bishops). This gives a total of 8 + 6 = 14 bishops. In this arrangement, none of the bishops attack each other.\n\n3.  **Empty Edge Squares:** With the maximum number of bishops (14) placed on the edge, the number of empty edge squares is the total number of edge squares minus the number of bishops.\n\n*   Total edge squares: 28\n*   Bishops placed: 14\n*   Empty edge squares: 28 - 14 = 14\n\nTherefore, if they succeeded in placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of the board, 14 edge squares would lack bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
