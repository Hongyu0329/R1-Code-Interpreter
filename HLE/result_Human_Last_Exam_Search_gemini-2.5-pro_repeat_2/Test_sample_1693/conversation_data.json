    "## French Tanker \"Monique\" Was Largest Ship Sunk by U-Boat Before 1940 Armistice\n\nDuring the initial phase of World War II, before the armistice with Germany on June 22, 1940, the largest French ship sunk by a German U-boat was the steam tanker **Monique**. The vessel, with a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 7,011 tons, was torpedoed by U-65 on the day of the armistice itself.\n\nThe only other French naval vessel confirmed to have been sunk by a U-boat during this period was the submarine *Doris*. The *Doris* had a submerged displacement of 765 tons when it was sunk by U-9 on May 8, 1940.\n\nThe *Monique*, owned by the Compagnie Auxiliaire de Navigation, was significantly larger. While its exact displacement is not readily available in historical records, its deadweight tonnage (DWT) was 10,705 tons. Displacement, the actual weight of the ship, is calculated by adding the ship's own weight (lightship tonnage) to its deadweight tonnage. Therefore, the *Monique's* full load displacement would have been considerably greater than 10,705 tons, making it substantially larger than the submarine *Doris*.\n\nThe tanker was en route from Haifa to Le Havre carrying a cargo of 10,000 tons of crude oil when it was attacked in the Bay of Biscay. The sinking of the *Monique* marked a final naval loss for France in the \"Phoney War\" period, just as the nation was officially ceasing hostilities with Germany.\n\nOther significant French naval losses during the early stages of the war, such as the battleship *Bretagne*, occurred after the armistice or were not the result of U-boat attacks. The *Bretagne*, for instance, was sunk by the British Royal Navy at Mers-el-KÃ©bir on July 3, 1940, to prevent its capture by the Axis powers. Many other French vessels were scuttled by their own crews at Toulon in November 1942 to deny them to the Germans.\n\n<<<Monique>>>"
