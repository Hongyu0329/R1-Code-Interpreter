    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997) is 489,061,149,953,492,545.\n\nAn involution in a group is an element that is its own inverse. For the group PSU(4, 997), the number of involutions can be determined by considering the structure of its parent group, the special unitary group SU(4, 997).\n\nThe involutions in PSU(4, q), where q=997, arise from two types of elements in SU(4, q):\n1.  **Involutions**: Elements `t` in SU(4, q) such that `t^2 = I` (the identity matrix), and `t` is not the identity.\n2.  **Quasi-involutions**: Elements `t` in SU(4, q) such that `t^2 = -I`.\n\nThe number of involutions in SU(4, q) is given by the formula:\n`N_inv = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`\n\nThe number of quasi-involutions in SU(4, q) is given by:\n`N_qi = q^2 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^3 + 1)`\n\nSince 997 â‰¡ 1 (mod 4), the center of SU(4, 997) consists of {I, -I}. The involutions in PSU(4, 997) are the images of the involutions and quasi-involutions from SU(4, 997). Each involution in PSU(4, 997) corresponds to two elements (`t` and `-t`) in SU(4, 997).\n\nTherefore, the total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is the sum of the number of involutions and quasi-involutions in SU(4, 997), divided by 2:\nNumber of involutions = `(N_inv + N_qi) / 2`\n= `(q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1) + q^2(q^2 + 1)(q^3 + 1)) / 2`\n= `(q^2 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^4 + q^2 + 1)) / 2`\n\nSubstituting q = 997:\n= `(997^2 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)) / 2`\n= `(994009 * (994009 + 1) * (994009^2 + 994009 + 1)) / 2`\n= `(994009 * 994010 * 988054842091) / 2`\n= `489061149953492545`\n\n<<<489061149953492545>>>"
