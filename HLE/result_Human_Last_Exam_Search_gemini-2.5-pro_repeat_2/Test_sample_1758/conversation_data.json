    "The standard Spanish term for \"shock absorber\" is *amortiguador*. However, English borrowings and adaptations are common in Puerto Rican Spanish for car parts. For \"shock absorber,\" a likely borrowing is a shortened form like *\"shocksorber\"*.\n\nBased on the phonological rules of Puerto Rican Spanish, this borrowing would be adapted and pronounced in a distinctive way. The key features influencing the pronunciation are the treatment of the English \"sh\" sound, the simplification of consonant clusters, and the handling of the \"r\" sound in the final position of a syllable.\n\nThe phonetic transcription of the English borrowing for \"shock absorber,\" adapted into Puerto Rican Spanish, would be:\n\n<<<**[ʃo.sol.ˈβel]**>>>\n\nHere is a breakdown of how the English term transforms into this pronunciation:\n\n*   **\"Shock\" /ʃɒk/:** The initial \"sh\" sound, /ʃ/, is often rendered as [ʃ] in modern Puerto Rican Spanish. This is because the native Spanish \"ch\" sound (/tʃ/) is frequently \"deaffricated\" to [ʃ] in Puerto Rico, making the sound familiar.\n*   **Combination and Cluster Simplification:** The term is often clipped to a form like \"shocksorber.\" In casual, rapid speech, the consonant cluster /ks/ (from \"shock\" + \"sorber\") is often simplified. A common simplification is to drop the hard \"k\" sound, leaving [ʃosorber].\n*   **\"Sorber\" /sɔːrbər/:**\n    *   The \"b\" is between two vowels and thus softens to a fricative sound, represented as [β].\n    *   A defining characteristic of Puerto Rican Spanish is the tendency to exchange a syllable-final /r/ for an /l/ (a phenomenon called lateralization). In this word, both instances of /r/ in \"-sor-\" and \"-ber\" are in syllable-final positions. Therefore, \"sor\" becomes [sol] and \"ber\" becomes [bel].\n*   **Stress:** The stress pattern of the new word would likely regularize to follow Spanish rules, placing the primary stress on the final syllable: [ʃo.sol.ˈβel]."
