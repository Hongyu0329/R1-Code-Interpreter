The explicit representation of the normal cone $T_F^°(x^*)$ is given by
\[
T_F^°(x^*) = \left\{ s \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid s_2 = 0, s_3 \geq 0 \right\}.
\]
This can also be written as the set
\[
\left\{ (s_1, 0, s_3)^\top \mid s_1 \in \mathbb{R}, s_3 \geq 0 \right\}.
\]
Geometrically, this is the upper half of the $s_1s_3$-plane (including the $s_1$-axis) in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
