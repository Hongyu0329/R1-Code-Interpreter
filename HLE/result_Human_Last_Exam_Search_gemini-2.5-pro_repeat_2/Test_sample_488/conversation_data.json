    "Based on the theory of \"Conceptual Metaphor in Everyday Language,\" as developed by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, the phrase \"my love for humanity\" is an expression of a **structural metaphor**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Conceptual Metaphor Theory:** This theory posits that we understand one concept (the target domain) in terms of another (the source domain). The main types are structural, orientational, and ontological metaphors.\n*   **Structural Metaphors:** This type of metaphor allows one concept to be metaphorically structured in terms of another. For example, the metaphor ARGUMENT IS WAR structures our understanding of arguments using concepts from war (e.g., \"winning an argument,\" \"defending a position\").\n*   **Analysis of \"my love for humanity\":** This phrase treats \"love\" as a possessable object or substance (\"my love\") that can be directed (\"for humanity\"). This relies on an underlying conceptual metaphor such as LOVE IS A POSSESSION or LOVE IS A SUBSTANCE. By using the structure of a possessable object to understand the abstract emotion of love, we are using a structural metaphor. It allows us to talk about and reason about love by mapping our knowledge of objects and possessions onto it.\n\nWhile it has features of an ontological metaphor (treating an abstract emotion as a discrete entity), the act of structuring love with attributes of possession (\"my\") makes it a clear example of one concept being understood in terms of another, which is the definition of a structural metaphor. Studies of metaphors in love songs confirm that structural metaphors are a primary way the concept of love is expressed.\n\n<<<D>>>"
