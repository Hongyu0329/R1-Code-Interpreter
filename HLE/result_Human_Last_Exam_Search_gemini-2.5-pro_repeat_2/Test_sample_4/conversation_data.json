    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we first analyze its structure. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nIt is assumed that any brackets not explicitly defined are zero. For the Jacobi identity to hold, we must have, for example, $[[e_1, e_2], e_5] + [[e_2, e_5], e_1] + [[e_5, e_1], e_2] = 0$. This implies $[e_3, e_5] + [0, e_1] + [-e_6, e_2] = 0$, so $[e_3, e_5] = [e_6, e_2]$. Assuming undefined brackets are zero is consistent with the Jacobi identity. The algebra is nilpotent, as its descending central series terminates at $\\{0\\}$.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$ are the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra. We can compute these by analyzing the structure of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n1.  **Find the center of $\\mathfrak{g}$**: The center $Z(\\mathfrak{g})$ consists of elements $z = \\sum a_i e_i$ that commute with all elements of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n    *   $[z, e_1] = -a_2[e_1, e_2] - a_3[e_1, e_3] - a_5[e_1, e_5] = -a_2 e_3 - a_3 e_4 - a_5 e_6 = 0$, which implies $a_2=a_3=a_5=0$.\n    *   So, $z$ must be of the form $a_1 e_1 + a_4 e_4 + a_6 e_6$.\n    *   $[z, e_2] = a_1[e_1, e_2] = a_1 e_3 = 0$, which implies $a_1=0$.\n    *   Therefore, the center consists of elements of the form $a_4 e_4 + a_6 e_6$. It is easy to verify that these elements commute with all $e_i$.\n    *   The center is $Z(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\text{span}\\{e_4, e_6\\}$, which is a 2-dimensional abelian ideal.\n\n2.  **Identify the quotient algebra**: Consider the quotient Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h} = \\mathfrak{g} / Z(\\mathfrak{g})$. This algebra is 4-dimensional with basis $\\{\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_2, \\bar{e}_3, \\bar{e}_5\\}$. The brackets are:\n    *   $[\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_2] = \\overline{[e_1, e_2]} = \\bar{e}_3$.\n    *   $[\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_3] = \\overline{[e_1, e_3]} = \\bar{e}_4 = 0$ (since $e_4 \\in Z(\\mathfrak{g})$).\n    *   $[\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_5] = \\overline{[e_1, e_5]} = \\bar{e}_6 = 0$ (since $e_6 \\in Z(\\mathfrak{g})$).\n    *   All other brackets are zero.\n    The algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ is the direct sum of two ideals: $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_2, \\bar{e}_3\\} \\oplus \\text{span}\\{\\bar{e}_5\\}$. The first ideal is the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_3$, and the second is the 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{h} \\cong \\mathfrak{h}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n3.  **Use the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence**: For a central extension $0 \\to \\mathfrak{z} \\to \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{h} \\to 0$, the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the product of the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{h}$ and the Poincaré polynomial of the exterior algebra on the dual of the center, $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{z}^*)$.\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x) \\cdot P_{\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{z}^*)}(x)$.\n\n4.  **Compute the polynomial factors**:\n    *   The center $\\mathfrak{z}$ is 2-dimensional, so the Poincaré polynomial of $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{z}^*)$ is $P_{\\Lambda(\\mathbb{R}^2)}(x) = \\binom{2}{0} + \\binom{2}{1}x + \\binom{2}{2}x^2 = 1 + 2x + x^2 = (1+x)^2$.\n    *   The Poincaré polynomial of the direct sum $\\mathfrak{h} \\cong \\mathfrak{h}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{R}$ is the product of the individual polynomials: $P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x) = P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x)$.\n    *   For the 1-dimensional abelian algebra $\\mathbb{R}$, $P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x) = 1+x$.\n    *   For the 3-dimensional Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_3$, the Betti numbers are $(1, 2, 2, 1)$, so the Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3$.\n\n5.  **Assemble the final polynomial**:\n    *   First, calculate the Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{h}$:\n        $P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3)(1+x) = 1 + (2+1)x + (2+2)x^2 + (1+2)x^3 + x^4 = 1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4$.\n    *   Now, multiply by the polynomial for the center:\n        $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4)(1+x)^2$\n        $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4)(1 + 2x + x^2)$\n        $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4) + (2x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 2x^5) + (x^2 + 3x^3 + 4x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6)$\n        $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + (3+2)x + (4+6+1)x^2 + (3+8+3)x^3 + (1+6+4)x^4 + (2+3)x^5 + x^6$\n        $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 5x + 11x^2 + 14x^3 + 11x^4 + 5x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is $1 + 5x + 11x^2 + 14x^3 + 11x^4 + 5x^5 + x^6$.\n\n<<<1 + 5x + 11x^2 + 14x^3 + 11x^4 + 5x^5 + x^6>>>"
