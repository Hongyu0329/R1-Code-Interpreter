    "### The Three Longest Rivers Mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid\n\nThe epic Roman poem, the Aeneid, makes reference to several real and mythological rivers. Among the terrestrial rivers mentioned, the three longest are the Nile, the Danube, and the Ganges.\n\n**1. The Nile River:**\nWith a length of approximately 6,650 to 6,853 kilometers, the Nile is the longest river in Africa and is mentioned in the Aeneid. In Book VI, Virgil alludes to the \"sevenfold Nile\" when describing the future glory of Rome, and it is also referenced in Book IX.\n\n**2. The Danube River:**\nThe second longest river in Europe, the Danube, stretches for about 2,850 to 2,888 kilometers. While not explicitly named in the Aeneid with its common Latin name \"Danuvius,\" it is often associated with the \"Ister,\" another name for the lower Danube, which was a significant river in the Roman imagination and is alluded to in the epic's broader geographical and prophetic scope.\n\n**3. The Ganges River:**\nThe Ganges River, sacred in Hinduism and a major waterway in the Indian subcontinent, has a length of roughly 2,510 to 2,525 kilometers. Virgil mentions the Ganges in Book IX of the Aeneid when describing the vast and diverse forces that will come under Roman dominion.\n\nOther notable real-world rivers mentioned in the Aeneid include the Aras (Araxes) at 1,072 km, the Rh√¥ne at 812 km, the Hebrus (Maritsa) at 480 km, and the Tiber at 406 km, which plays a central role in the narrative as the river of Rome. The epic also features mythological rivers of the underworld such as the Styx, Acheron, Cocytus, Phlegethon, and Lethe, which do not have a measurable length. The mythological Eridanus is also mentioned, which the ancient Greeks sometimes identified with real rivers like the Nile or the Po.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile, the Danube, and the Ganges.>>>"
