    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `abcdefg`. In this pattern, the residues at positions 'a' and 'd' are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the coiled-coil structure. Their specific identity and arrangement are primary determinants of the oligomeric state due to the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the sequence to find the repeating pattern. The sequence is 32 amino acids long, suggesting it contains approximately four and a half heptad repeats. A common feature is a pattern of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) residues, often `H P P H P P P` for positions `a b c d e f g`. The key hydrophobic residues in this sequence are Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Alanine (A), and Tryptophan (W).\n\nWe can see a clear repeating motif within the sequence:\n`G E` **`I A Q S L K E`** **`I A K S L K E`** **`I A W S L K E`** **`I A Q S L K`** `G`\n\nLet's test an assignment of the `abcdefg` positions. If we assign Isoleucine (I) to the 'd' position and Leucine (L) to the 'a' position, we can establish a consistent register:\n\n`d e f g a b c`\n**I** A Q S **L** K E\n**I** A K S **L** K E\n**I** A W S **L** K E\n**I** A Q S **L** K\n\nThis alignment reveals a highly regular pattern where the **'a' positions are consistently occupied by Leucine (L)** and the **'d' positions are consistently occupied by Isoleucine (I)**.\n\nNext, we refer to established principles from studies on coiled-coil design, particularly the landmark experiments on the GCN4 leucine zipper:\n\n*   When the 'a' position is Isoleucine and the 'd' position is Leucine (an 'IL' pattern), the protein forms a **dimer**.\n*   When both the 'a' and 'd' positions are occupied by Isoleucine (an 'II' pattern), the protein tends to form a **trimer**.\n*   When the 'a' position is Leucine and the 'd' position is Isoleucine (an 'LI' pattern), as is the case with the given sequence, the protein forms a **tetramer**.\n\nThe reason for this specificity lies in the packing efficiency (\"knobs-into-holes\") of the amino acid side chains within the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil. The steric bulk and shape of the β-branched side chain of Isoleucine and the γ-branched side chain of Leucine fit differently into the core of dimers, trimers, and tetramers. The `a=Leu, d=Ile` arrangement is optimally packed in a four-helix bundle.\n\nBased on the consistent `a=L, d=I` pattern in the provided sequence, the protein would adopt a tetrameric oligomeric state.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state would be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
