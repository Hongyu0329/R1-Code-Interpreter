The final state of the system is not a single state but one of five possible states, each with a specific probability of occurring. If the measurement of ququint A yields the result $|i\rangle_A$, the final state of the composite system is a product state where ququint A is in the definite state $|i\rangle_A$ and ququint B is in a corresponding, determined superposition. The exact state of ququint B depends on the outcome of the measurement on A, as detailed in the five possibilities listed above.
