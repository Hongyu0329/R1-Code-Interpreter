The precise value of the critical exponent ν is dependent on the specific definition of the "G₄-theoretical framework" and the spatial dimension 'd'. For the 2D 4-state Potts model (a possible interpretation of a Z₄ symmetric theory), ν = 2/3. For φ⁴-theory at or above its upper critical dimension of d=4, ν = 1/2.
