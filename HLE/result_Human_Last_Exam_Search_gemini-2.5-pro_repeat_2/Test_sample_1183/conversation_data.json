    "The SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` represents a complex, star-shaped molecule. To determine its symmetry group, we must first identify its three-dimensional structure.\n\nVisualizing the molecule using chemical structure databases reveals it to be a derivative of a triangulene, specifically a trioxatriangulene where the central oxygen atoms are replaced, or more generally, a planar molecule with a triangular arrangement of fused benzene rings. Three ethynyl (`-C≡CH`) groups are attached to the corners of this triangular core.\n\nThe resulting molecule is planar and possesses a high degree of symmetry:\n*   A principal three-fold rotational axis (C₃) passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A rotation of 120° about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   Three two-fold rotational axes (C₂) lie within the plane of the molecule, each passing through the central point and one of the ethynyl-substituted corners.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) is present, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σv) each contain the principal C₃ axis.\n\nThe combination of a C₃ axis, three perpendicular C₂ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) uniquely defines the **D₃h** point group. This point group describes the symmetry of other highly symmetric molecules like the carbonate ion (CO₃²⁻) and boron trifluoride (BF₃).\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
