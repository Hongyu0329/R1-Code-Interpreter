    "The major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is **perylene-3-thiol**. The reduction cleaves the disulfide (-S-S-) bond, and each sulfur atom is subsequently capped with a hydrogen atom to form two thiol (-SH) groups. Since the starting material consists of two identical perylene-3-yl units, the major product is a single chemical species, perylene-3-thiol (C20H12S).\n\nThe determination of the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for this molecule, including all hydrogen atoms, requires the following steps:\n1.  **Construct the molecular graph** of perylene-3-thiol where both heavy atoms (carbon, sulfur) and hydrogen atoms are treated as vertices, and all covalent bonds are treated as edges. This graph consists of 33 vertices (20 carbons, 1 sulfur, 12 hydrogens).\n2.  **Calculate the Wiener Index (W)**, which is the sum of the shortest path distances between all possible pairs of vertices in the molecular graph.\n3.  **Calculate the Szeged Index (Sz)**, which is defined for each edge (bond) in the graph. For an edge connecting vertices *u* and *v*, one calculates the number of vertices closer to *u* than to *v* (n_u) and the number of vertices closer to *v* than to *u* (n_v). The Szeged index is the sum of the products (n_u * n_v) over all edges in the graph.\n4.  **Compute the ratio** Sz/W.\n\nThese calculations, especially for a complex, non-symmetrical graph with 33 vertices, are computationally intensive and cannot be performed manually. They require specialized chemical informatics software.\n\nWhile the specific functions for this calculation are available in software packages like Wolfram Mathematica (`SzegedIndex[Molecule[\"perylene-3-thiol\"], IncludeHydrogens -> All]` and `WienerIndex[Molecule[\"perylene-3-thiol\"], IncludeHydrogens -> All]`), access to execute this software is required to obtain the precise numerical values.\n\nTherefore, without the ability to run the necessary computational software, the exact numerical value for the Szeged/Wiener index ratio cannot be provided."
