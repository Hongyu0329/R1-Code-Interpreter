    "The haiku serves as a riddle, with its solution hinging on an interpretation of ancient history and the symbolic meaning of plants.\n\nThe poem's lines point to a specific historical event:\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This refers to the dramatic and consequential (\"august\") events that took place in August.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" equals thirty, pinpointing the year 30 BC. This was a pivotal year that marked the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire, a true \"wind of change.\"\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This line alludes to the death of Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt, who was considered a living goddess. Her suicide marked the yielding of Egypt to Roman rule.\n\nThe title, \"The Bays,\" is a question that puns on the word \"bay.\" It doesn't refer to bodies of water but to the ceremonial wreaths or crowns of leaves (\"bays\") associated with the key figures of this historical drama. In the Greco-Roman world, different plants were used to create wreaths, each with its own symbolism.\n\nThe answer to the riddle is a list of these symbolic plants, arranged in alphabetical order:\n\n*   **Bay (Laurel)**: The laurel wreath was a symbol of triumph, famously awarded to victorious Roman generals. The victor in this conflict, Octavian, was granted the right to have two bay laurels at his door.\n*   **Ivy**: Ivy was sacred to the god Dionysus (Bacchus in Rome), with whom Mark Antony, Cleopatra's lover and Octavian's rival, identified.\n*   **Myrtle**: This plant was sacred to the goddess Aphrodite (Venus in Rome). Cleopatra associated herself with the goddess Isis, who was often merged with Aphrodite/Venus. Myrtle was also worn by Roman commanders during an ovation, a lesser form of triumph.\n*   **Oak**: The oak leaf crown, or *corona civica*, was one of the highest military honors in Rome, awarded to a citizen who had saved the life of another. Octavian was awarded this honor.\n*   **Olive**: The olive wreath was the prize for victors at the ancient Olympic Games and a symbol of peace and victory. Its inclusion represents the end of the civil wars and the beginning of the *Pax Romana* (Roman Peace) under the new emperor.\n\n<<<Bay, Ivy, Myrtle, Oak, Olive>>>"
