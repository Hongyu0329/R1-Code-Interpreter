    "To find the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in a specific interval, one must integrate the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval.\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\nwhere 'a' is the length of the box and 'n' is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor the state n = 2, the wave function is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density, |ψ₂(x)|², is therefore:\n|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability (P) of finding the particle in the interval from x = 0.495a to x = 0.505a is calculated by the integral of the probability density over this range:\nP = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2. In this case, θ = 2πx/a, so 2θ = 4πx/a.\n\nP = (2/a) ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1/2) * (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\nP = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nNow, we substitute the limits of the integration:\nP = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)) ]\nP = (1/a) * [ 0.01a - (a/4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n\nUsing the trigonometric identities sin(2π + α) = sin(α) and sin(2π - α) = -sin(α), we can simplify the sine terms:\nsin(2.02π) = sin(0.02π)\nsin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\n\nSubstituting these back into the probability equation:\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [2sin(0.02π)]\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\nP ≈ 0.01 - (1 / (2 * 3.14159)) * sin(0.02 * 3.14159)\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.15915 * sin(0.06283)\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.15915 * 0.06279\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.0099934\nP ≈ 0.00000658\n\nThis result is expected to be very small because the center of the interval, x = 0.5a, is a node for the n=2 state, a point where the probability of finding the particle is zero.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
