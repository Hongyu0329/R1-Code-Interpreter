    "In the given chess position, represented by the FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`, White has a forced checkmate sequence. Assuming optimal play from both sides, White can win in 3 moves.\n\nThe winning sequence of moves is as follows:\n1.  **Qxf7+** This move puts the Black king in check. Black's only legal move is to move the king.\n2.  **... Kh8** Forced move by Black.\n3.  **Qf8+** This is a decisive move, forcing a response from Black that leads to checkmate. Black's only legal move is to capture the White queen with the rook.\n4.  **... Rxf8** Forced capture by Black.\n5.  **Rxf8#** White's rook captures the Black rook, resulting in a checkmate.\n\nTherefore, White can deliver a checkmate in 3 moves.\n\n<<<3>>>"
