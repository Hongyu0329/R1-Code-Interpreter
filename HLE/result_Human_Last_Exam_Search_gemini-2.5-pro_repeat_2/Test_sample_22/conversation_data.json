    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), measured by the proportion of variance it explains (R²), is theoretically capped by the SNP heritability (h²_SNP). SNP heritability represents the proportion of phenotypic variation that is attributable to all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) used in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Therefore, it serves as the theoretical maximum predictive power that a PGS built from those same SNPs can achieve.\n\nIn practice, the variance explained by a PGS is almost always lower than the SNP heritability. This gap exists for several reasons, including:\n*   **Error in effect size estimates:** GWAS are based on finite sample sizes, leading to statistical error in the estimated effect of each SNP.\n*   **Differences between samples:** The genetic data and environmental contexts of the sample used to create the PGS (the base data) and the sample in which it is tested (the target data) can differ.\n*   **Imperfect linkage disequilibrium (LD):** The SNPs used in a PGS are often not the causal variants themselves but are correlated with them. This imperfect correlation reduces predictive power.\n\nFor example, the SNP heritability for educational attainment is estimated to be around 22-28%, while the R² of the best polygenic scores for the same trait is about 12%. Similarly, the SNP heritability of ADHD is about 21.6%, but the PGS for ADHD explains a maximum of 5.5% of the variance. While it has been shown under specific conditions of population heterogeneity that a PGS R² can exceed a given SNP heritability estimate, this is an exception rather than the rule. As a general principle, SNP heritability sets the upper limit for the predictive power of a polygenic score.\n\n<<<True>>>"
