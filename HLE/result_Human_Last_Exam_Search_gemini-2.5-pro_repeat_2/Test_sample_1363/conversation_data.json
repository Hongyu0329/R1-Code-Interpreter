    "The fundamental difference between European Tango and the other four standard ballroom dances (often called \"swing\" dances) lies in its technique. The swing dances—Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep—are characterized by continuous, flowing movements, rise and fall, and sway. In contrast, European Tango is a \"staccato\" dance, defined by sharp, precise movements and the notable absence of rise and fall.\n\nA reverse turn is a left-turning figure common to all these dances. To \"overturn\" a figure means to rotate more than the technically prescribed amount. In the swing dances, while overturning a reverse turn is considered poor technique and would be penalized in a competition, it is not strictly impossible. The continuous and flowing nature of these dances allows for some latitude in the amount of turn, even if it disrupts the dance's character. For instance, in Viennese Waltz, it is noted that overturning a reverse turn to navigate a corner is extremely difficult, so dancers typically switch to a natural turn instead, but this implies it's a matter of difficulty rather than impossibility.\n\nIn European Tango, the technique is starkly different. Movement is staccato and grounded, with no rise and fall. Turns are executed with sharp, precise actions rather than continuous, flowing rotation. A video analysis of the Tango reverse turn demonstrates that over-rotating the body on the second step fundamentally changes the figure, leading to an entirely different position called a \"fallaway\" rather than a correctly executed reverse turn. Attempting to add more rotation would require introducing a continuous, swinging action with sway, which is fundamentally contrary to the core principles of Tango technique. This violation is so significant that it essentially means one is no longer dancing Tango correctly.\n\nTherefore, because of its staccato nature and lack of continuous, swinging rotation, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn in the European Tango without completely disregarding its fundamental technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
