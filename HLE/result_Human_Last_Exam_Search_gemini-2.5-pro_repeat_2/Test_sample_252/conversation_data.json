    "A Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) constructs a three-dimensional data set (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) from a single two-dimensional image. This is achieved without scanning by using a dispersive element to project multiple, spectrally separated images onto a single focal plane array.\n\nThe core of a CTIS system is a two-dimensional disperser. While a single one-dimensional diffraction grating can separate light by wavelength, it only does so along one axis. To create the necessary projections for a tomographic reconstruction of a full data cube from a single snapshot, dispersion in two dimensions is required.\n\nHistorically, and in a common fundamental design, this two-dimensional dispersion was achieved by stacking two one-dimensional gratings and crossing them, typically at a 90-degree angle to each other. While modern systems may use a single, more complex component like a computer-generated hologram (CGH) that acts as a 2D disperser, this single component is functionally creating a two-dimensional diffraction pattern equivalent to what two crossed gratings would produce. Therefore, the minimum number of conventional one-dimensional gratings needed to achieve the required 2D dispersion is two.\n\n<<<B>>>"
