    "This problem requires finding the number of possible integer values for a side of a triangle given specific conditions that lead to the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines.\n\n### Understanding the Ambiguous Case\n\nIn a triangle $ABC$, let the side lengths opposite to angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ be $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively. The problem provides side $a = BC = S$, angle $B = 30^{\\circ}$, and we are looking for the number of integer values for side $b = AC$ such that there are two possible values for side $c = AB$.\n\nThis scenario, known as the ambiguous case in trigonometry, occurs when we are given two sides and a non-included angle (SSA). For two distinct triangles to be possible, the side opposite the given angle ($b = AC$) must be longer than the altitude from vertex $C$ to side $AB$, but shorter than the other given side ($a = BC$).\n\nLet $h$ be the altitude from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$. This altitude can be calculated as:\n$h = a \\cdot \\sin(B)$\n\nFor two triangles to exist, the following inequality must be true:\n$h < b < a$\n\n### Determining the Value of S\n\nThe problem states that $S = SNYWR$. This is an acronym used in the North Carolina State High School Math Contest, representing a specific value for each year's competition. For the 2024 contest, from which this problem originates, the value was given as $S = 357$.\n\n### Calculation\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into our conditions:\n\n1.  **Given values**:\n    *   $a = BC = S = 357$\n    *   $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$\n    *   $b = AC$\n\n2.  **Calculate the altitude (h)**:\n    *   $h = a \\cdot \\sin(B) = 357 \\cdot \\sin(30^{\\circ})$\n    *   Since $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 0.5$, we have:\n    *   $h = 357 \\cdot 0.5 = 178.5$\n\n3.  **Apply the inequality for the ambiguous case**:\n    *   The condition for two possible triangles is $h < b < a$.\n    *   Substituting the values we found:\n    *   $178.5 < b < 357$\n\n4.  **Count the integer values**:\n    *   The problem asks for the number of *integer* values for side $AC$ (which is $b$).\n    *   The integers $b$ must satisfy the inequality $178.5 < b < 357$.\n    *   The smallest integer greater than 178.5 is 179.\n    *   The largest integer less than 357 is 356.\n    *   To find the number of integers in this range, we calculate:\n    *   Number of values = (Last Integer) - (First Integer) + 1\n    *   Number of values = $356 - 179 + 1 = 178$\n\nTherefore, there are 178 integer values for the length of side $AC$ for which two possible triangles can be formed.\n\n<<<178>>>"
