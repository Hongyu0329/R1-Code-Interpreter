    "The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Contracts (General Part) Law. This law marked a significant development in Israeli jurisprudence by codifying the principle of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, *tom lev*).\n\nSpecifically, sections 12 and 39 of this statute are pivotal. Section 12 mandates that parties act in good faith during pre-contractual negotiations, while Section 39 requires that any right or obligation arising from a contract be exercised and fulfilled in good faith. Before the enactment of this law, Israeli contract law was primarily based on the English approach, which did not have an equivalent overarching principle of good faith. The introduction of this concept was a deliberate move towards a more continental European legal tradition and was considered a \"far-reaching innovation.\" Section 61(b) of the law further extends the duty of good faith to other legal acts and obligations not arising from a contract.\n\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
