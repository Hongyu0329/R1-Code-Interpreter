    "To calculate the state feedback gain `F` that places the eigenvalues of `A + BF` at the desired locations, we will follow the pole placement method.\n\n**1. System Matrices:**\nThe given system matrices are:\n`A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\n**2. Desired Characteristic Polynomial:**\nThe desired eigenvalues are `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial corresponding to these eigenvalues is:\n`p(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\n`p(s) = (s + 1)² - j²`\n`p(s) = s² + 2s + 1 + 1`\n`p(s) = s² + 2s + 2`\n\n**3. Closed-Loop System:**\nThe closed-loop system matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`. Let the state feedback gain matrix be `F = [[f₁₁, f₁₂], [f₂₁, f₂₂]]`.\n\nFirst, we calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁₁, f₁₂], [f₂₁, f₂₂]] = [[f₁₁ + 2f₂₁, f₁₂ + 2f₂₂], [f₁₁, f₁₂]]`\n\nNow, we form the closed-loop matrix `A + BF`:\n`A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁₁ + 2f₂₁, f₁₂ + 2f₂₂], [f₁₁, f₁₂]]`\n`A + BF = [[-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁, 1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂], [1 + f₁₁, f₁₂]]`\n\n**4. Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System:**\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is `s² - trace(M)s + det(M)`.\nFor `M = A + BF`:\n`trace(A + BF) = (-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁) + f₁₂ = f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ - 1`\n`det(A + BF) = (-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁)f₁₂ - (1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂)(1 + f₁₁)`\n`det(A + BF) = -f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - (1 + f₁₁ + f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₂₂ + 2f₁₁f₂₂)`\n`det(A + BF) = -1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is:\n`s² - (f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ - 1)s + (-1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂)`\n\n**5. Equating Coefficients:**\nWe now equate the coefficients of this polynomial with the desired polynomial `s² + 2s + 2`.\n\n*   **Coefficient of s:**\n    `-(f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ - 1) = 2`\n    `-f₁₁ - f₁₂ - 2f₂₁ + 1 = 2`\n    `-f₁₁ - f₁₂ - 2f₂₁ = 1` (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Constant term:**\n    `-1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂ = 2`\n    `-f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ - 2f₂₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂ = 3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns. This indicates that there is no unique solution for `F`, which is typical for multi-input systems. We can find a solution by making a simplifying assumption.\n\nLet's assume that we only use the first input, which means the second row of `F` is zero.\nLet `f₂₁ = 0` and `f₂₂ = 0`.\n\nThe equations simplify to:\n*   From Equation 1:\n    `-f₁₁ - f₁₂ = 1`  => `f₁₁ + f₁₂ = -1`\n\n*   From Equation 2:\n    `-f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ = 3` => `f₁₁ + 2f₁₂ = -3`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n1.  `f₁₁ + f₁₂ = -1`\n2.  `f₁₁ + 2f₁₂ = -3`\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n`(f₁₁ + 2f₁₂) - (f₁₁ + f₁₂) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f₁₂ = -2`\n\nSubstituting `f₁₂ = -2` into the first equation:\n`f₁₁ + (-2) = -1`\n`f₁₁ = 1`\n\nThus, a valid state feedback gain matrix is `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`.\n\n**6. Verification:**\nLet's check our result. With `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`, the closed-loop matrix is:\n`A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A + BF = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\n\nThe characteristic equation for this matrix is `det(sI - (A+BF)) = 0`:\n`det([[s, 1], [-2, s+2]]) = s(s+2) - (1)(-2) = s² + 2s + 2 = 0`\nThis is the desired characteristic polynomial. The roots of this equation are `s = -1 ± j`, which are the desired eigenvalues.\n\n<<<F = [[1, -2],]>>>"
