Let $f_m$ be the number of sets $T$ satisfying the given conditions for positive integers $n$ and $m$.

For $m=1$ and $m=2$, the number of such sets is zero.
$f_1 = 0$
$f_2 = 0$

For $m \ge 3$, the number of sets $f_m$ can be determined by the following recurrence relation:
$f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1)f_{m-2} \right)$

Using the hint's notation, where $a = \binom{2^n-1}{m-1}$, the recurrence can be written as:
$f_m = \frac{1}{m} (a - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1)f_{m-2})$
