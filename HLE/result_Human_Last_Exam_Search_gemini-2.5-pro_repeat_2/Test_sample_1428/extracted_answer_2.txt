The one-step transformation is $p_i(t+1) = \frac{1}{2} p_{i-1}(t) + \frac{1}{2} p_{i+1}(t)$. The transition matrix $\hat{A}$ has elements $A_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}(\delta_{j, i-1} + \delta_{j, i+1})$ with indices taken modulo $N$. The eigenvectors are shown to be of the form $v_n$ with components $(v_n)_j = e^{ij(2\pi n/N)}$, and the corresponding eigenvalues are $\lambda_n = \cos(2\pi n/N)$ for $n=0, 1, ..., N-1$. The rate of relaxation is determined by the second-largest eigenvalue, $\lambda_1 = \cos(2\pi/N)$, and is given by $R = 1 - \cos(2\pi/N)$. For large $N$, this rate is approximately $2\pi^2/N^2$.
