    "To determine the coordinates of the central pixel of a line drawn between (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, the following steps are taken:\n\nFirst, we calculate the differences in the x and y coordinates:\n*   Δx = 11 - 1 = 10\n*   Δy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\nThe slope of the line is Δy/Δx = 4/10 = 0.4. Since the slope is between 0 and 1, for each step in the x-direction, we will either keep the y-coordinate the same or increment it by one.\n\nThe decision parameter is initialized as p = 2 * Δy - Δx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2.\n\nThe algorithm then iterates from the starting point (1,1) to the end point (11,5), generating the following sequence of pixels:\n*   (1, 1)\n*   (2, 1)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (4, 2)\n*   (5, 3)\n*   **(6, 3)**\n*   (7, 4)\n*   (8, 4)\n*   (9, 5)\n*   (10, 5)\n*   (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in the line. The central pixel is the 6th one in this sequence.\n\n<<<The coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).>>>"
