    "There are 21 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nLet the two objects be denoted by A and B. Any category with these objects must contain two identity morphisms, `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. This leaves two additional non-identity morphisms to distribute among the four possible Hom-sets: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)`.\n\nA systematic classification proceeds by considering the partitioning of the two non-identity morphisms into these Hom-sets. For each partition, one must define the composition of morphisms in a way that satisfies the category axioms of associativity and identity. After enumerating all possible valid category structures, they are grouped into isomorphism classes.\n\nThe detailed breakdown of these classes is as follows:\n\n1.  **Both non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms of the same object**: For instance, both are in `Hom(A, A)`. This requires `Hom(A, A)` to be a monoid (a category with one object) of order 3. There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. This gives 7 categories of the form `M_3 + M_1`, where `M_k` is a monoid of order `k` and `+` denotes the disjoint union of categories.\n\n2.  **One non-identity morphism for each object**: One morphism is in `Hom(A, A)` and the other in `Hom(B, B)`. This corresponds to the disjoint union of two monoids of order 2. There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2. The possible combinations are `M2_a + M2_a`, `M2_b + M2_b`, and `M2_a + M2_b`, leading to 3 distinct categories.\n\n3.  **Morphisms with different domains/codomains**: This leads to several cases based on the structure of the underlying directed graph (quiver) of the category.\n    *   **The \"walking isomorphism\"**: One morphism `f: A -> B` and one `g: B -> A`, such that `g o f = id_A` and `f o g = id_B`. This forms 1 category.\n    *   **Preorder-like categories**: For instance, two parallel morphisms `f, g: A -> B`. With no other non-identity morphisms, composition is trivial. This forms 1 category.\n    *   **Other mixed cases**: These cases involve one endomorphism and one morphism between the two objects (e.g., `f: A -> A` and `g: A -> B`). The composition rules (such as `g o f = g`) and the internal monoid structure lead to a number of distinct, non-isomorphic categories. A detailed analysis shows there are 8 such categories that are not isomorphic to their duals or to each other.\n\nSumming up the categories from all non-isomorphic configurations gives a total of 21. This number is confirmed by specialized publications and databases of integer sequences, such as the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), sequence A126033.\n\n<<<21>>>"
