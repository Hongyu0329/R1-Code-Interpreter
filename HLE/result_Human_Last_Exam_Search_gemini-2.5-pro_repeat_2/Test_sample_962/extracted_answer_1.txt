A tightly secure two-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme is designed by grounding it on a hard mathematical problem like the Discrete Logarithm Problem and employing a secure Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol, often based on Verifiable Secret Sharing, to create and distribute key shares without a trusted dealer. The two-round signing protocol consists of a commitment round, where participants exchange commitments to secret nonces, followed by a signature share generation and aggregation round. To achieve tight security, the design must incorporate countermeasures against known vulnerabilities like the Drijvers forgery attack, and its security proof should demonstrate a close relationship to the underlying hard problem, allowing for more efficient parameter sizes. The FROST protocol is a prominent example of such a design.
