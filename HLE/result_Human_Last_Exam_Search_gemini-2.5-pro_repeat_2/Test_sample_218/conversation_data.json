    "The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer 25. The dimension of each irrep can be calculated using the hook-length formula. To find the number of irreps with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we must identify all partitions of 25 that satisfy this condition.\n\nThe dimensions of the irreps tend to be smaller for partitions that are \"long\" or \"thin,\" meaning they have a very large first part or a large number of parts. These correspond to partitions of the form $(n-k, \\dots)$ or their conjugates, where $k$ is a small integer.\n\nA systematic check of the dimensions for partitions of 25 reveals the following partitions whose corresponding irreps have dimensions less than 500,000:\n\n*   **Dimension 1:** The partition is (25).\n*   **Dimension 24:** The partition is (24, 1).\n*   **Dimension 275:** The partition is (23, 2).\n*   **Dimension 276:** The partition is (23, 1, 1).\n*   **Dimension 2,000:** The partition is (22, 3).\n*   **Dimension 2,024:** The partition is (22, 1, 1, 1).\n*   **Dimension 4,025:** The partition is (22, 2, 1).\n*   **Dimension 10,350:** The partition is (21, 4).\n*   **Dimension 10,626:** The partition is (21, 1, 1, 1, 1).\n*   **Dimension 14,950:** The partition is (21, 2, 2).\n*   **Dimension 24,200:** The partition is (21, 3, 1).\n*   **Dimension 32,400:** The partition is (21, 2, 1, 1).\n*   **Dimension 40,480:** The partition is (20, 5).\n*   **Dimension 42,504:** The partition is (20, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1).\n*   **Dimension 106,260:** The partition is (20, 3, 2).\n*   **Dimension 116,280:** The partition is (20, 4, 1).\n*   **Dimension 157,500:** The partition is (20, 2, 2, 1).\n*   **Dimension 167,376:** The partition is (20, 3, 1, 1).\n*   **Dimension 205,800:** The partition is (20, 2, 1, 1, 1).\n*   **Dimension 123,970:** The partition is (19, 6).\n*   **Dimension 134,596:** The partition is (19, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1).\n*   **Dimension 292,825:** The partition is (19, 3, 3).\n*   **Dimension 414,720:** The partition is (19, 5, 1).\n*   **Dimension 425,040:** The partition is (19, 4, 2).\n*   **Dimension 303,600:** The partition is (18, 7).\n*   **Dimension 346,104:** The partition is (18, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1).\n\nThis gives a total of 26 distinct partitions. For any given partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ corresponds to an irreducible representation of the same dimension. None of the 26 partitions listed above are self-conjugate, meaning that for each partition $\\lambda$ in the list, its conjugate $\\lambda'$ is a different partition, and the set of 26 conjugate partitions is also distinct.\n\nTherefore, for each of the 26 partitions found, there is a corresponding conjugate partition which also gives an irreducible representation with a dimension less than 500,000. This results in a total of 26 * 2 = 52 irreducible representations.\n\n<<<52>>>"
