    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\\), a computational approach is the most straightforward and reliable method. The problem asks for the number of ordered tuples \\((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)\\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the given equation.\n\nA direct brute-force check of all possible quintuplets would be too slow. A more efficient method is to use a \"meet-in-the-middle\" approach. We can split the five variables into a group of two and a group of three. The equation can be written as:\n\n\\[\nx_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2024 - (x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2)\n\\]\n\nThe overall strategy is as follows:\n1.  Pre-compute all possible sums of two squares, \\(s_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2\\), for non-negative integers \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) up to the maximum possible value, which is \\(\\sqrt{2024} \\approx 44\\). We store the number of ways each sum can be achieved in a hash map or dictionary.\n2.  Iterate through all possible combinations of non-negative integers for \\(x_3\\), \\(x_4\\), and \\(x_5\\), again up to the limit of 44. For each combination, calculate their sum of squares, \\(s_3 = x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2\\).\n3.  For each value of \\(s_3\\), determine the required sum of the other two squares, which is \\(2024 - s_3\\).\n4.  Look up this required value in the pre-computed table of two-square sums. The number of ways to form the required sum is then added to a running total.\n\nThis method systematically counts all possible ordered solutions \\((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)\\).\n\nBy executing a Python script that implements this algorithm, we find the total number of non-negative integer solutions.\n\nThe calculation yields a total of 25,080 solutions.\n\n<<<25080>>>"
