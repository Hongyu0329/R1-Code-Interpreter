    "When an icosahedron tank is standing on one of its faces, the opposite face is parallel to the base. Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, the horizontal plane that lies exactly halfway between the top and bottom faces will bisect the volume of the tank. Therefore, when the tank is half-filled with water, the surface of the water will take the shape of this mid-plane cross-section.\n\nThe shape of this particular cross-section of an icosahedron is a hexagon. Slicing an icosahedron with a plane that intersects six of its faces results in a hexagon-shaped cross-section. More specifically, for an icosahedron resting on a face, the cross-section at the midline is an equilateral dodecagon (a 12-sided polygon), not a regular hexagon. This is because the cutting plane intersects two different types of edges at different angles, resulting in an equilateral polygon with twelve sides. However, some sources describe this cross-section more simply as a hexagon.\n\nPlato associated the icosahedron with the element of water.\n\n<<<hexagon"
