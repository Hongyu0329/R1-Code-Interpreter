    "The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, and its outer hull is its convex hull. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces. Each face is an equilateral triangle.\n\nTherefore, the outer hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron, which is already triangulated by its 20 triangular faces. The minimal number of triangles needed for this triangulation is the number of faces of the regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron has:\n*   20 faces\n*   30 edges\n*   12 vertices\n\nThe faces of a regular icosahedron are all equilateral triangles. Thus, the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is simply the set of its faces.\n\n<<<20>>>"
