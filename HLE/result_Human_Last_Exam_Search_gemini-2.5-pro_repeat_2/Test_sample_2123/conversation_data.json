    "In the Russian translation of Joseph Brodsky's essay \"A Guide to a Renamed City\" (*Путеводитель по переименованному городу*), the surname of the English poet Alexander Pope appears.\n\nThe essay describes the Neoclassical architecture of St. Petersburg, a style with many similarities to the grand boulevards of Vienna. In the Russian text, a description of an architectural detail includes the word \"поп\" (pop). This word, meaning \"priest\" in Russian, is a pun on the surname of the 18th-century English poet Alexander Pope, an author whom Brodsky admired. The trivia question likely uses Vienna as a close architectural parallel to St. Petersburg to add a layer of challenge.\n\n<<<Pope>>>"
