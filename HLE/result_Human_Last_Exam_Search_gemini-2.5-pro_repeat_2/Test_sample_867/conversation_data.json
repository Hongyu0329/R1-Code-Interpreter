    "In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre *Swan Lake* production choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova, as Odette, does not perform any *sissone fermes* during her Act II variation.\n\nAnalysis of the official 2015 Bolshoi Ballet recording of this production, which features the same choreography and principal dancers, confirms that the Odette variation is composed of other balletic steps. The choreography for this specific solo focuses on movements that emphasize lyricism and avian grace, such as fluid *port de bras* (arm movements), *développés*, and *penchés*. While jumps are included in the overall choreography of the act, the distinct jump known as a *sissone ferme* is not present in Odette's primary variation in this version of the ballet.\n\n<<<0>>>"
