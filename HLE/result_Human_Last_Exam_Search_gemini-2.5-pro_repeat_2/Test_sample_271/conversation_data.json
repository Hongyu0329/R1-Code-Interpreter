    "To determine the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the splitting field $K$ of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6$, we first analyze the polynomial and its Galois group.\n\n**1. Factoring the Polynomial**\n\nThe given polynomial can be factored over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By testing for roots of the form $\\sqrt{a}$, we find that $x^2-2$ is a factor. Polynomial division yields:\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its irreducible factors.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Factors**\n\n*   **For $g(x) = x^2 - 2$:** The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which is a normal extension of degree 2. Its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q})$, is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$.\n\n*   **For $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    *   **Irreducibility:** Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$, we see that 3 divides all coefficients except the leading one (1), and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term (3). Thus, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Galois Group:** To determine the Galois group of this irreducible quintic, we examine its roots. The derivative is $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$, which has two real roots ($x = \\pm\\sqrt{9/5}$). This indicates that $h(x)$ has exactly two critical points. Since $h(-\\infty) < 0$, the local maximum is positive, the local minimum is negative, and $h(\\infty) > 0$, the polynomial has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots.\n    *   An irreducible quintic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly three real roots has the symmetric group $S_5$ as its Galois group. Let $K_2$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$, so $\\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\n**3. The Galois Group of the Splitting Field K**\n\nThe splitting field $K$ is the compositum $K_1K_2$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the direct product of the individual Galois groups, $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\n\nTo determine if it is the full direct product, we must check if the intersection of the fields is trivial, i.e., $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$. The only non-trivial subfield of $K_1$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. So, we must check if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a subfield of $K_2$. The only quadratic subfield of the splitting field of an irreducible quintic is the one corresponding to the alternating group $A_5$, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the polynomial.\n\nThe discriminant of $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is a large negative integer, $D = -14,863,419$. The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is an imaginary quadratic field, while $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field. Therefore, they are not the same. This confirms that $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThus, the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of this group is $|G| = |C_2| \\times |S_5| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n**4. Normal Subgroups and Degrees of Extensions**\n\nNormal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to proper, non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ by the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory. The degree of such an extension is given by the index of the subgroup, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H]$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$ must be identified. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$. The only proper, non-trivial normal subgroup of $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$. The normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ are:\n1.  **Product Subgroups:** Products of normal subgroups of $C_2$ and $S_5$.\n    *   $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: Order 2. Index is $240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$: Order 60. Index is $240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$: Order 120. Index is $240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $C_2 \\times A_5$: Order 120. Index is $240/120 = 2$.\n2.  **\"Diagonal\" Subgroup:** Because the orders of $C_2$ and $S_5$ are not coprime, there can be other normal subgroups. Goursat's Lemma implies the existence of a subgroup corresponding to the homomorphism $\\phi: C_2 \\to \\text{Aut}(S_5/A_5) \\cong C_2$. This gives rise to one additional normal subgroup, $N_{diag} = \\{(c, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = c \\}$, where we identify $C_2$ with $\\{1, -1\\}$. This subgroup has order 120 and index $240/120 = 2$.\n\n**5. Possible Degrees**\n\nThe degrees of the normal intermediate extensions are the indices of these proper, non-trivial normal subgroups:\n*   From $H = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$, the degree is 120. This corresponds to the extension $L=K_2$, the splitting field of $x^5-9x+3$.\n*   From $H = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$, the degree is 4. This corresponds to the biquadratic extension $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{D})$.\n*   From $H = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$, the degree is 2. This corresponds to the extension $L=K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   From $H = C_2 \\times A_5$, the degree is 2. This corresponds to the extension $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$.\n*   From $H = N_{diag}$, the degree is 2. This corresponds to the extension $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2D})$.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees for such extensions $L$ is therefore {2, 4, 120}.\n\n<<<The possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.>>>"
