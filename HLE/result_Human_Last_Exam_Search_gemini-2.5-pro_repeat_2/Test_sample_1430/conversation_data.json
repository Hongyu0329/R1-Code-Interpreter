    "Let C be a genus 3 Riemann surface and X be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as C^(15). The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is denoted by ρ(X).\n\n### Step 1: Relating ρ(C^(15)) to the Jacobian of C\n\nThe Néron-Severi group, NS(X), of a projective variety X is the group of divisors modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, ρ(X), is also known as the Picard number. For the symmetric powers of a curve, there is a fundamental relationship between the rank of their Néron-Severi group and that of the curve's Jacobian variety.\n\nFor a smooth complex projective curve C of genus g ≥ 2, and for its n-th symmetric power C^(n) with n ≥ 2g - 2, the rank of the Néron-Severi group is given by the formula:\nρ(C^(n)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1\nwhere Jac(C) is the Jacobian variety of C.\n\nIn this problem, C is a curve of genus g = 3, and we are considering its 15th symmetric power, X = C^(15). The condition n ≥ 2g - 2 becomes 15 ≥ 2(3) - 2, which is 15 ≥ 4. Since this condition is satisfied, the formula is applicable. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, ρ(Jac(C)).\n\n### Step 2: The Range of the Néron-Severi Rank for a Jacobian Variety\n\nThe Jacobian Jac(C) of a genus 3 curve is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. For any abelian variety A of dimension g, the rank of its Néron-Severi group, ρ(A), is bounded by:\n1 ≤ ρ(A) ≤ g²\n\nFor Jac(C), with g = 3, this range is:\n1 ≤ ρ(Jac(C)) ≤ 9\n\nWe now need to determine if these bounds are achievable for Jacobians of genus 3 curves.\n\n### Step 3: The Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest possible rank ρ(Jac(C)) = 1 is achieved for a \"generic\" curve C. A generic curve is one whose Jacobian has the minimal possible number of endomorphisms, with its endomorphism ring being simply the integers, End(Jac(C)) ≅ ℤ. In this case, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and its rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X = C^(15) is:\nρ_min(X) = ρ_min(Jac(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Step 4: The Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe largest theoretical rank for ρ(Jac(C)) is g² = 9. An abelian variety A of dimension g achieves this maximum rank if and only if it is of CM-type and is isogenous to the g-th power of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication (CM).\n\nTo determine if ρ(Jac(C)) = 9 is possible, we need to find if there exists a genus 3 curve C whose Jacobian is isogenous to E³, where E is a CM elliptic curve. A well-known example is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation X⁴ + Y⁴ + Z⁴ = 0. This curve has genus 3. The Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve is known to be isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve y² = x³ - x, which has complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers ℤ[i].\n\nFor this curve, ρ(Jac(C)) = 9. This means the maximum possible rank is indeed achievable.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X = C^(15) is:\nρ_max(X) = ρ_max(Jac(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\nThe smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<Smallest rank: 2\nLargest rank: 10>>>"
