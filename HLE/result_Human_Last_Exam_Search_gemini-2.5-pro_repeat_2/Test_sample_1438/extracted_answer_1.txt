The "value" of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a number but is defined by the algebraic rules of Berezin integration: ∫ dθ = 0 and ∫ dθ θ = 1. These rules ensure the anti-commuting property of Grassmann variables (θiθj = -θjθi), which leads to θ² = 0, the mathematical representation of the Pauli exclusion principle.
