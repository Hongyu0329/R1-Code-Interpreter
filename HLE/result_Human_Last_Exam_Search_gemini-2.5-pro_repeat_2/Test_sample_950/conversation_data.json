    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 0.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of this result.\n\n### 1. The Space in Question\nThe space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. This is a compact manifold of dimension $3 \\times (5-3) = 6$. An important property of Grassmannians is the diffeomorphism $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cong G_{n-k}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, which means $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is diffeomorphic to $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\n### 2. Integral Cohomology and Torsion\nThe question concerns the integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. For any topological space, the integral cohomology groups $H^k(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ can be decomposed into a free part and a torsion part. The torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each cohomology group. It is a known result that the torsion in the integral homology of real Grassmannians is entirely 2-torsion, meaning every torsion element has order 2.\n\n### 3. Determining the Cohomology Groups\nTo find the structure of the integral cohomology groups, we can first determine the integral *homology* groups $H_k(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$ and then apply the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology. The integral homology groups of $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ have been computed and are as follows:\n*   $H_0(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H_1(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H_2(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H_3(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H_4(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H_5(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H_6(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe Universal Coefficient Theorem states that $H^k(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Free}(H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z})) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(H_{k-1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$. Using the homology groups listed above, we can determine the cohomology groups:\n*   $H^0(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^6(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\n### 4. The Torsion Subgroup\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring, $T(H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$, is the direct sum of the torsion parts of the individual cohomology groups:\n$T(H^*) = T(H^2) \\oplus T(H^3) \\oplus T(H^5) \\oplus T(H^6) = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\nThis is an abelian group of order 16 where every element has order 2.\n\n### 5. Rank of the Torsion Subgroup\nThe rank of an abelian group is defined as the dimension of the vector space that results from tensoring the group with the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. For any torsion group $T$, every element $t \\in T$ has a finite order $n$ such that $nt=0$. When tensored with $\\mathbb{Q}$, any element $t \\otimes q$ becomes zero:\n$t \\otimes q = t \\otimes (n \\cdot q/n) = (nt) \\otimes (q/n) = 0 \\otimes (q/n) = 0$.\nThis means that $T \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is the zero vector space, which has dimension 0.\n\nTherefore, the rank of any torsion group, including the torsion subgroup $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$ found for the cohomology of $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, is always 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
