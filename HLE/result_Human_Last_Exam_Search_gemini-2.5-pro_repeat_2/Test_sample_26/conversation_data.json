    "Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is the dimension of the rational homotopy group $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. This can be calculated using the tools of rational homotopy theory, specifically Sullivan's theory of minimal models.\n\nFirst, we determine the topological properties of $X$.\n*   $X$ is a 2-dimensional complex manifold, and thus a 4-dimensional real manifold.\n*   By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the inclusion $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces an isomorphism on the first homotopy groups, which means $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. Thus, $X$ is simply connected.\n*   The Betti numbers of $X$ can be calculated. The non-zero Betti numbers are $b_0(X)=1$, $b_2(X)=53$, and $b_4(X)=1$. All odd-dimensional Betti numbers are zero, so $b_1(X)=b_3(X)=0$. The Euler characteristic is $\\chi(X) = 1 - 0 + 53 - 0 + 1 = 55$. The Hodge numbers of a quintic surface are $h^{2,0}=4$ and $h^{1,1}=45$.\n\nSince $X$ is a smooth projective variety, it is a compact Kähler manifold. A key result in rational homotopy theory by Deligne, Griffiths, Morgan, and Sullivan states that all compact Kähler manifolds are formal. Formality implies that the rational homotopy type of $X$ is a formal consequence of its rational cohomology algebra. This allows for the computation of the ranks of its homotopy groups using a minimal model.\n\nThe minimal model for a simply connected space $X$ is a commutative differential graded algebra $(\\Lambda V, d)$ whose cohomology is isomorphic to the rational cohomology of $X$. The vector space $V = \\bigoplus_{k \\ge 2} V^k$ is related to the rational homotopy groups by the isomorphism $V^k \\cong \\text{Hom}(\\pi_k(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}, \\mathbb{Q})$. The rank of $\\pi_k(X)$ is therefore the dimension of $V^k$.\n\nFor the quintic surface $X$:\n1.  Since $\\pi_1(X) = 0$, the space of generators $V$ starts in degree 2, i.e., $V^1=0$.\n2.  The second rational homotopy group is isomorphic to the second rational homology group because $X$ is simply connected (Hurewicz theorem). Thus, the rank of $\\pi_2(X)$ is $b_2(X) = 53$. This corresponds to $\\dim V^2 = 53$.\n3.  The rational cohomology of the minimal model must match that of $X$. In particular, $H^3(\\Lambda V, d) \\cong H^3(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$. The elements of degree 3 in $\\Lambda V$ are just the elements of $V^3$ (since $V^1=0$). The differential maps $d: V^3 \\to \\Lambda^2 V^2$. For the third cohomology to be zero, this map must be injective.\n4.  The fourth rational cohomology group $H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is one-dimensional. In the minimal model, the space of 4-cocycles is $\\Lambda^2 V^2$ (as the differential on this space is zero), and the space of 4-coboundaries is the image of the differential $d: V^3 \\to \\Lambda^2 V^2$.\n5.  Therefore, $H^4(\\Lambda V, d) \\cong (\\Lambda^2 V^2) / \\text{im}(d)$. The dimension of this space must be 1.\n6.  This gives the equation: $\\dim(\\Lambda^2 V^2) - \\dim(\\text{im}(d)) = 1$.\n7.  The dimension of $\\Lambda^2 V^2$ is $\\binom{\\dim V^2}{2} = \\binom{53}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 1378$.\n8.  Since $d$ is injective on $V^3$, $\\dim(\\text{im}(d)) = \\dim(V^3)$.\n9.  Plugging this into the equation: $1378 - \\dim(V^3) = 1$.\n10. Solving for the dimension of $V^3$ gives $\\dim(V^3) = 1377$.\n\nThe rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is the dimension of $V^3$. Therefore, the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 1377.\n\n<<<1377>>>"
