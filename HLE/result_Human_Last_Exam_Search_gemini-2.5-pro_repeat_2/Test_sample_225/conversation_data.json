    "The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, can be determined by a specific formula. For the given curve, the parameters are a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nThe formula for the number of self-intersection points when both 'a' and 'b' are odd is (a-1)(b-1)/2. In this case, a = 9 and b = 5, which are both odd integers and are coprime.\n\nApplying the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nThus, the curve consisting of all points (cos(9t), sin(5t)) has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
