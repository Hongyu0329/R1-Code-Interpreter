    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers.\n\n*   **XL**: In Roman numerals, when a smaller value (X = 10) comes before a larger value (L = 50), it is subtracted. Therefore, XL equals 50 - 10 = 40.\n*   **CLX**: This is an additive case where the values are combined. C represents 100, L represents 50, and X represents 10. So, CLX is 100 + 50 + 10 = 160.\n*   **LXI**: This is also an additive case. L is 50, X is 10, and I is 1. Thus, LXI equals 50 + 10 + 1 = 61.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the equation:\n\n40 / 160 - 61\n\nNext, we perform the calculation:\n\n1.  Divide 40 by 160: 40 ÷ 160 = 0.25\n2.  Subtract 61 from the result: 0.25 - 61 = -60.75\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is -60.75.\n\n<<<-60.75>>>"
