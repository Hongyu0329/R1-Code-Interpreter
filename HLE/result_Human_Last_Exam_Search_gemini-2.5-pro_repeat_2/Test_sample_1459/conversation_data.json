    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric has been calculated. The unit circle, with radius 1, has a circumference of $2\\pi$ and a diameter of $\\pi$ under the intrinsic (geodesic) metric. The interval $$ has a length and diameter of 1.\n\nIn a 2022 paper published in *Topology and its Applications*, titled \"Gromovâ€“Hausdorff distance between interval and circle\", authors Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin determined the precise value for this distance. Their work provides the exact calculation for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment of any length $\\ell > 0$ and the standard unit circle with its geodesic distance. While previously considered a challenging problem, their paper introduced new methods to find the exact value.\n\nThe calculation of this specific distance was also mentioned as a known result in other academic papers, citing the work of Ji and Tuzhilin.\n\nBased on the findings in the aforementioned paper, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment of length $L$ and a circle of circumference $2\\pi$ is given by a specific formula, which for the case of the interval $$ (where $L=1$) and the unit circle (circumference $2\\pi$) yields a concrete value. This value is $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}$>>>"
