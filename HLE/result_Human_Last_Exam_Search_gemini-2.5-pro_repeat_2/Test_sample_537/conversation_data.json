    "The pattern in the encoded words is based on the QWERTY keyboard layout. Each letter of the original word is replaced by the letter immediately to its left on the keyboard.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the decoded words are a sequence of the four seasons:\n*   `utpshtheas` decodes to **spring**\n*   `fkuhu` decodes to **summer**\n*   `numhkatnatu` decodes to **autumn**\n\nThe final word to be decoded is `anhaeketn`. Applying the same \"shift-left\" pattern reveals the final word in the sequence.\n\n*   `w` is to the left of `e`\n*   `i` is to the left of `o`\n*   `n` is to the left of `b`\n*   `t` is to the left of `y`\n*   `e` is to the left of `r`\n*   `r` is to the left of `t`\n\nTherefore, `anhaeketn` decodes to **winter**.\n\n<<<winter>>>"
