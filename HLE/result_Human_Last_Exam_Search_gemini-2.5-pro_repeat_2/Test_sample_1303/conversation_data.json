    "As the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 is a small molecule, the protein-ligand interactions of interest involve this molecule acting as a ligand that binds to specific protein targets. Based on available bioactivity data, CHEMBL4803817 has been shown to interact with several key proteins involved in the DNA damage response pathway. These primary protein targets include Serine/threonine-protein kinase ATM, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), and Serine/threonine-protein kinase ATR.\n\nConsequently, other small molecules that interact with these same protein targets are of interest.\n\n### Serine/threonine-protein kinase ATM\n\nSeveral small molecule inhibitors have been developed to target the ATM kinase, which plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response. These inhibitors are being investigated for their potential in cancer therapy, often in combination with treatments that cause DNA damage.\n\nNotable small molecule inhibitors of ATM include:\n*   **AZD1390**: A clinical candidate ATM inhibitor that has been shown to protect neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis.\n*   **KU-55933**: An ATM inhibitor that has demonstrated the ability to reduce inflammation in acute lung injury models.\n*   **WSD0628, SYH2051, and ZN-B-2262**: These are other selective ATM inhibitors that have advanced to clinical trials for treating glioblastoma and advanced solid tumors.\n*   **Imidazo[4,5-c]quinolinone-based compounds**: A class of compounds that have shown good ATM inhibitory activity and selectivity.\n\n### DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs)\n\nDNA-PKcs is another critical protein in the DNA double-strand break repair pathway, and its inhibitors are being explored as cancer therapeutics.\n\nSmall molecules that interact with DNA-PKcs include:\n*   **NU7441 (KU-0060648)**: A highly potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor that enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapy agents like etoposide and doxorubicin.\n*   **M3814 (Peposertib)**: A DNA-PK inhibitor that has entered clinical trials and is being evaluated in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n*   **AZD7648**: Another DNA-PK inhibitor in clinical development.\n*   **Wortmannin**: A natural fungal metabolite that inhibits DNA-PK, although it also inhibits other PI3K family kinases.\n*   **LY294002**: A PI3K inhibitor that also demonstrates inhibitory activity against DNA-PK.\n*   **VX-984**: A DNA-PK inhibitor that has been investigated for its potential to increase the radiosensitivity of glioblastomas.\n\n### Serine/threonine-protein kinase ATR\n\nATR is a key kinase in the DNA damage response that is activated by a broad range of DNA damage. Several small molecule inhibitors targeting ATR are in clinical development.\n\nOther small molecules that target ATR include:\n*   **Cisplatin, Carboplatin, and Oxaliplatin**: These are platinating agents used in chemotherapy that have been shown to be more effective when combined with ATR inhibition.\n*   **Gemcitabine and Cytarabine**: Antimetabolite drugs that show increased efficacy when used with ATR inhibitors.\n*   **5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)**: Another antimetabolite whose effectiveness may be enhanced by ATR pathway inhibitors.\n*   **ATR-IN-30**: A selective ATR ligand used in the synthesis of PROTACs (Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras) for ATR degradation.\n*   **AZD6738 (Ceralasertib)**: A potent and selective ATR inhibitor that has been evaluated in clinical trials.\n*   **SCH 900776 (Berzosertib)**: An ATR inhibitor that has been studied in clinical trials for various cancers."
