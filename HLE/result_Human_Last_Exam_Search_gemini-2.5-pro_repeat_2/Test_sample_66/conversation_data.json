    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, let's analyze the flag's structure and the resulting matrix.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Flag and the Matrix\n\nThe flag of Tonga is composed of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. Inside the white canton lies a red \"couped cross\" (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n\nWe can represent this flag as a matrix, M, where:\n*   Red pixels have a value of `$a$`.\n*   White pixels have a value of `$b$`.\n\nLet the dimensions of the flag matrix M be H x W (Height x Width). Let the canton's dimensions be h x w. The matrix M can be viewed as a block matrix:\n\n```\nM = [ C   A₁ ]\n    [ A₂  A₃ ]\n```\n\nWhere:\n*   **C** is an h x w matrix representing the canton. It contains `$b$` values for the white background and `$a$` values for the red cross.\n*   **A₁, A₂, A₃** are matrices filled entirely with the value `$a$`.\n\n### 2. Simplifying the Matrix to Find its Rank\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows (or columns), which is equivalent to the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns). We can use row and column operations to simplify the matrix without changing its rank.\n\nLet's assume `$a \\neq 0$` and `$a \\neq b$`, as these conditions will likely lead to a higher rank. The rows of the matrix from `h+1` to `H` are all identical, consisting only of the value `$a$`. These `H-h` rows contribute only 1 to the total rank.\n\nLet's perform column operations. The columns from `w+1` to `W` are identical, with all elements being `$a$`. Let's take the last column, `col_W`, and subtract it from columns `1` to `w`.\n\n*   For `j > w`, the columns remain `[a, a, ..., a]ᵀ`.\n*   For `j ≤ w`, the new column `col'_j` is `col_j - col_W`.\n    *   In the top `h` rows (the canton area), the new element is `M(i,j) - a`.\n    *   In the bottom `H-h` rows, the new element is `a - a = 0`.\n\nThe transformed matrix, M', looks like this:\n```\nM' = [ C'  A₁ ]\n     [ 0   A₃ ]\n```\nwhere `C'` is the `h x w` matrix for the canton after the operation, and `0` is a zero matrix of size `(H-h) x w`. The rank of this block upper-triangular matrix is the sum of the ranks of the diagonal blocks:\n`rank(M) = rank(M') = rank(C') + rank(A₃)`.\n\n*   **rank(A₃)**: `A₃` is an `(H-h) x (W-w)` matrix of all `$a$`s. As long as `$a \\neq 0$`, its rank is 1.\n*   **rank(C')**: The matrix `C'` has elements `M(i,j) - a`.\n    *   Where the canton has the red cross (value `$a$`), `C'(i,j) = a - a = 0`.\n    *   Where the canton has a white background (value `$b$`), `C'(i,j) = b - a`.\n\nSo, `C'` is a matrix that is zero everywhere except on the white background of the canton, where it has the value `b-a`. Since we assumed `$a \\neq b$`, `b-a` is non-zero. The rank of `C'` is therefore equal to the rank of a binary matrix, let's call it `C_w`, which has `1`s for the white background of the canton and `0`s for the red cross.\n\nThus, the rank of the flag matrix `M` is `rank(M) = rank(C_w) + 1`.\n\n*(Note: If we chose `$a = 0$`, the rank would simply be `rank(C_w)`. If `$a=b$`, the rank would be 1. To find the maximal rank, we choose `$a \\neq 0$` and `$a \\neq b$`, which gives `rank(C_w) + 1`.)*\n\n### 3. Finding the Maximal Rank of the Canton Matrix (`C_w`)\n\nNow, we need to find the maximal possible rank of `C_w`. This matrix represents the shape of the white background in the canton, which is a rectangle with a cross-shaped hole. The red cross is a \"couped cross,\" meaning it is formed by the union of two intersecting rectangles (a horizontal bar and a vertical bar) and does not touch the edges of the canton.\n\nLet the row and column index sets for the cross's bars be:\n*   Horizontal bar: rows `R_H` and columns `C_H`.\n*   Vertical bar: rows `R_V` and columns `C_V`.\n\nA row `i` of the matrix `C_w` is a vector whose elements `C_w(i,j)` are determined as follows: `C_w(i,j) = 0` if the pixel `(i,j)` is part of the cross, and `1` otherwise. The structure of a row `i` depends on how it intersects with the row sets `R_H` and `R_V`. There are four possibilities:\n\n1.  **Row `i` is outside both `R_H` and `R_V`**: The row does not intersect the cross. It is a vector of all `1`s.\n2.  **Row `i` is in `R_H` but not `R_V`**: The row intersects only the horizontal bar. It will have `0`s in the columns defined by `C_H` and `1`s elsewhere.\n3.  **Row `i` is in `R_V` but not `R_H`**: The row intersects only the vertical bar. It will have `0`s in the columns defined by `C_V` and `1`s elsewhere.\n4.  **Row `i` is in both `R_H` and `R_V`**: The row intersects both bars of the cross. It will have `0`s in the columns defined by the union `C_H U C_V`.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we can construct the cross so that all four of these row types exist and are linearly independent. This can be achieved by having the row intervals `R_H` and `R_V` partially overlap (e.g., `R_H` = rows 10-20, `R_V` = rows 15-25) and the column intervals `C_H` and `C_V` also partially overlap (e.g., `C_H` = columns 10-20, `C_V` = columns 15-25). Under these conditions, the four resulting unique row vectors can be shown to be linearly independent.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of linearly independent rows in `C_w` is 4. The maximal rank of `C_w` is 4.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe maximal possible rank of the entire flag matrix `M` is given by `rank(C_w) + 1`. Since the maximal rank of `C_w` is 4, the maximal possible rank of the matrix `M` is:\n\n`Rank = 4 + 1 = 5`\n\nThis maximum is achieved by choosing `$a \\neq b$`, `$a \\neq 0$`, and designing the canton's dimensions and the cross's shape appropriately to ensure four distinct and linearly independent row types exist in the `C_w` matrix.\n\n<<<5>>>"
