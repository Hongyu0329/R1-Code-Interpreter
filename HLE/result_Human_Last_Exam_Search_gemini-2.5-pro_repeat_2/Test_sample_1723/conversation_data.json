    "Based on available mycological information, there is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.\n\nWhile several species of mushrooms are themselves blue, their spore prints are of other colors. For example:\n\n*   ***Lactarius indigo***, a well-known blue mushroom, has a spore print that is cream to pale yellowish.\n*   ***Entoloma hochstetteri***, a vibrant blue mushroom native to New Zealand, has a reddish-pink spore print. The genus *Entoloma* is generally characterized by its pink spores.\n*   ***Stropharia caerulea***, commonly known as the blue roundhead, produces a purple-brown spore print.\n*   ***Cortinarius rotundisporus***, the elegant blue webcap, has a reddish-brown spore print.\n*   ***Panaeolus cyanescens***, which can have a bluish cap, has a black spore print.\n\nTherefore, the premise that there is a single genus of mushroom with a distinctly blue spore print is not supported by current scientific literature.\n\n<<<Based on the research, no such mushroom genus exists.>>>"
