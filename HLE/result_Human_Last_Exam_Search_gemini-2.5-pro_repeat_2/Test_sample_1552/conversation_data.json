    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is a fundamental quantity in quantum field theory and noncommutative geometry. It is denoted by `a_2` in the Seeley-DeWitt expansion of the heat kernel for the square of the Dirac operator.\n\nThe spectral action is given by `Tr(χ(D^2/Λ^2))`, where `D` is the gauged Dirac operator, `Λ` is a cutoff scale, and `χ` is a suitable cutoff function. Its asymptotic expansion for large `Λ` in four dimensions is given by:\n\n`S[D, Λ] ~ c_0 Λ^4 \\int d^4x \\sqrt{g} a_0(x) + c_1 Λ^2 \\int d^4x \\sqrt{g} a_1(x) + c_2 \\int d^4x \\sqrt{g} a_2(x) + ...`\n\nwhere `c_i` are moments of the function `χ`, and `a_n(x)` are the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients. The second non-trivial coefficient in this expansion is `a_2`.\n\nFor a massless Dirac spinor field coupled to a gauge field `A_μ`, the square of the Dirac operator is given by:\n\n`D^2 = - (g^{μν}∇_μ∇_ν \\cdot \\mathbb{1} + E)`\n\nwhere `∇_μ = ∂_μ + ω_μ + iA_μ` is the covariant derivative including the spin connection `ω_μ` and the gauge connection `A_μ`, and the endomorphism `E` is given by `E = - \\frac{1}{4}R - \\frac{i}{2} F_{μν}γ^μγ^ν`, with `R` being the scalar curvature and `F_{μν}` the field strength of the gauge field.\n\nThe general formula for the Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a_2(x)` for a Laplace-type operator of the form `Δ + V` is given by:\n\n`a_2(x) = \\text{tr} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} V^2 + \\frac{1}{6} R V + \\frac{1}{12} \\Omega_{μν}\\Omega^{μν} + \\frac{1}{180} (R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ} - R_{μν}R^{μν}) \\mathbb{1} + \\frac{1}{30} \\nabla^2 R \\cdot \\mathbb{1} \\right)`\n\nwhere `V` is the potential term, `Ω_{μν}` is the curvature of the total connection, and `tr` denotes the trace over the spinor and gauge group indices. For the gauged Dirac operator, `V = -E` and the curvature of the connection is `Ω_{μν} = \\frac{1}{4}R_{μνab}γ^aγ^b + iF_{μν}`.\n\nAfter performing the trace over the spinor indices, the second coefficient `a_2` for a single massless Dirac spinor in four dimensions is found to be:\n\n`a_2(x) = -\\frac{1}{12} \\text{tr}(F_{μν}F^{μν}) + \\frac{1}{240} (R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ} - 4R_{μν}R^{μν} + R^2)`\n\nwhere `tr` now denotes the trace over the gauge group indices. This expression gives the local density whose integral contributes to the second term in the asymptotic expansion of the spectral action.\n\n<<<-\\frac{1}{12} \\text{tr}(F_{μν}F^{μν}) + \\frac{1}{240} (R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ} - 4R_{μν}R^{μν} + R^2)>>>"
