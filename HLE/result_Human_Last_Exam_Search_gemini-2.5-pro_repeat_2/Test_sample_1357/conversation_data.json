    "Under the assumption that the Jacobian of a genus 4 curve defined over a valuation field has good reduction, there are 6 types of stable reductions.\n\nWhen the Jacobian of a curve has good reduction, it means that its Néron model's special fiber is an abelian variety. The structure of the special fiber of the stable model of the curve is constrained by this condition. Specifically, the connected component of the identity of the Picard group of the stable fiber is isomorphic to the special fiber of the Jacobian's Néron model. For this to be an abelian variety, two conditions must be met:\n\n1.  The dual graph of the components of the stable fiber must be a tree. This ensures there is no torus part in the Jacobian.\n2.  Each irreducible component of the stable fiber must be a smooth curve. Any nodes on the components would also give rise to a torus part.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of the stable fiber is 4. For a stable curve whose dual graph is a tree, the arithmetic genus is the sum of the genera of its irreducible components. Thus, the problem is reduced to finding the number of ways to partition the integer 4 and the number of distinct tree structures for each partition.\n\nThe partitions of 4 correspond to the following types of stable reduction:\n\n1.  **Partition 4:** The stable fiber is a single, smooth curve of genus 4. This is the case of good reduction for the curve itself.\n2.  **Partition 3+1:** The stable fiber consists of a smooth genus 3 curve and a smooth genus 1 curve (an elliptic curve) that intersect at a single point (a node). There is only one way to connect two components, resulting in one type.\n3.  **Partition 2+2:** The stable fiber is formed by two smooth genus 2 curves intersecting at a single node. This configuration is also unique.\n4.  **Partition 2+1+1:** The stable fiber consists of one smooth genus 2 component and two smooth genus 1 components. For three components, the only connecting tree graph is a path. This gives one combinatorial type, for example, where the genus 2 curve is connected to the two genus 1 curves at distinct points.\n5.  **Partition 1+1+1+1:** The stable fiber is composed of four smooth genus 1 curves. For four components, there are two possible non-isomorphic tree structures for their dual graph: a path graph and a star graph. Both of these lead to valid stable curves.\n\nIn summary, the six types of stable reduction are:\n*   A single smooth curve of genus 4.\n*   A smooth genus 3 curve and a smooth genus 1 curve attached at one point.\n*   Two smooth genus 2 curves attached at one point.\n*   A chain of three curves of genera 1, 2, and 1.\n*   A chain of four curves of genus 1.\n*   A central genus 1 curve to which three other genus 1 curves are attached.\n\n<<<6>>>"
