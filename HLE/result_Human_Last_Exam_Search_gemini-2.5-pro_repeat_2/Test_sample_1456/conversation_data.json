    "By a continuum, we mean a compact connected metric space. A continuum is called nondegenerate if it consists of more than one point. The question asks for the largest possible number of a specific feature of these spaces, known as composants, in the product of two such nondegenerate continua.\n\nTo determine this, we first need to understand the key concepts:\n\n*   **Composant:** In a continuum, the composant of a point *p* is the set of all points *x* for which there exists a proper subcontinuum (a subcontinuum not equal to the whole space) containing both *p* and *x*. The composants of a continuum form a partition of the space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A key property of indecomposable continua is the number of their composants.\n\nThe number of composants in the product of two continua, *X* and *Y*, is the product of the number of composants in each of the individual continua. That is, if *c(S)* denotes the number of composants of a continuum *S*, then the number of composants of the product space *X × Y* is given by the formula:\n\n*c(X × Y) = c(X) × c(Y)*\n\nTo find the largest possible number of composants in the product *X × Y*, we must find the maximum possible number of composants for a single nondegenerate continuum.\n\nThe number of composants a continuum can have varies. For example, a simple arc or a disk has only one composant. However, indecomposable continua have a much larger number of composants. It is a well-established theorem in continuum theory that every nondegenerate indecomposable metric continuum has **c** composants, where **c** stands for the cardinality of the continuum (the number of points on the real line). This is the maximum possible number of composants, as the number of composants cannot exceed the cardinality of the space itself, which is at most **c** for a metric continuum.\n\nWell-known examples of indecomposable continua include the pseudo-arc and the Knaster continuum (or bucket-handle). These are all nondegenerate continua.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua, *X* and *Y*:\n1.  To maximize *c(X × Y)*, we should choose *X* and *Y* to maximize their own number of composants.\n2.  The maximum number of composants for a single nondegenerate continuum is **c**. This is achieved by selecting indecomposable continua for both *X* and *Y*.\n3.  Let *X* be a pseudo-arc and *Y* be a pseudo-arc. Both are indecomposable continua, and thus *c(X) = c* and *c(Y) = c*.\n4.  The number of composants in their product is *c(X × Y) = c(X) × c(Y) = c × c*.\n5.  Using cardinal arithmetic, *c × c = c*.\n\nAlternatively, a known theorem states that the product of two continua is indecomposable if and only if both continua are indecomposable. Therefore, the product of two indecomposable continua is itself an indecomposable continuum. As established, any such continuum has **c** composants.\n\nThus, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
