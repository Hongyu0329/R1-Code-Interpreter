    "In the ϕ<sup>4</sup> theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u<sup>*</sup>, is directly proportional to the parameter ϵ = 4 - d, where d is the number of spacetime dimensions.\n\nThe analysis begins with the Lagrangian density for a single scalar field ϕ with a quartic self-interaction:\n\n**L = (1/2)(∂<sub>μ</sub>ϕ)<sup>2</sup> - (1/2)m<sup>2</sup>ϕ<sup>2</sup> - (u/4!)ϕ<sup>4</sup>**\n\nHere, *u* represents the coupling constant for the interaction term. The behavior of this coupling under changes in energy scale is described by the beta function, β(u). In d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, the one-loop beta function for this theory is given by:\n\n**β(u) = -ϵu + (3u<sup>2</sup>)/(16π<sup>2</sup>)**\n\nA fixed point of the theory is a value of the coupling, u<sup>*</sup>, where the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling no longer changes with the energy scale. Setting β(u<sup>*</sup>) = 0, we have:\n\n**-ϵu<sup>*</sup> + (3(u<sup>*</sup>)<sup>2</sup>)/(16π<sup>2</sup>) = 0**\n\nThis equation has two solutions. The first is the trivial Gaussian fixed point at u<sup>*</sup> = 0. The second, non-trivial solution is the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Solving for this non-zero coupling gives the leading order expression in terms of ϵ:\n\n**u<sup>*</sup> = (16π<sup>2</sup>/3)ϵ**\n\nThis fixed point governs the universal critical behavior of systems in the same universality class as the ϕ<sup>4</sup> theory, such as the Ising model near its critical temperature.\n\n<<<u<sup>*</sup> = (16π<sup>2</sup>/3)ϵ>>>"
