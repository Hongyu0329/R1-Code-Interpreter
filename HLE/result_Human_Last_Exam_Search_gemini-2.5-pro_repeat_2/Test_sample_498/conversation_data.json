    "This sequence is based on the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\nThe main sequence of letters follows the bottom row of keys from left to right:\n**Z, X, C, V, B, N, M**\n\nThe provided sequence, ZXXCVYBN, mostly follows this pattern, but with two additional letters inserted: a second 'X' and a 'Y'.\n\n*   The sequence starts with Z, then X, which are the first two keys on the bottom row.\n*   An extra 'X' is inserted.\n*   The sequence continues with C and V, the next two keys on the bottom row.\n*   A 'Y' is inserted. The 'Y' key is on the top row.\n*   The sequence then returns to the bottom row with B and N.\n\nDespite the inserted letters, the primary and most consistent pattern is the progression along the bottom row of the keyboard. The last given letter is 'N'. The next key to the right of 'N' on the bottom row is 'M'.\n\nTherefore, the next letter in the sequence should be M.\n\n<<<M>>>"
