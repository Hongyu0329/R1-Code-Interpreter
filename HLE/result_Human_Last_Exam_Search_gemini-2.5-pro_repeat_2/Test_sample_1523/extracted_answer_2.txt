In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (ϕ,D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the integral of the field ϕ multiplied by the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator acting on ϕ over the Euclidean spacetime. Explicitly, it is:

(ϕ,D_ϕ) = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)

where:
*   τ is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β = 1/T (T is the temperature).
*   **x** represents the spatial coordinates.
*   ϕ(τ, **x**) is the neutral scalar field.
*   D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m² is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.
*   m is the mass of the scalar field.
