    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field, denoted by Z, is expressed using the functional integral formalism. This representation is built upon the concept of a Euclidean action, which is obtained from the standard Minkowskian action by a Wick rotation to imaginary time, t = -iτ. The integration in the functional integral is performed over all possible field configurations that are periodic in the imaginary time direction with a period β = 1/T, where T is the temperature.\n\nThe Euclidean action, S_E, for a free, neutral scalar field ϕ with mass m is given by:\n\nS_E[ϕ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x [ ½ (∂_τ ϕ)² + ½ (∇ϕ)² + ½ m²ϕ² ]\n\nThis quadratic part of the action can be written in a compact and formal way as an inner product. The inner product, denoted as (ϕ, D_ϕ), represents the integral of the field ϕ multiplied by the action of a differential operator D_ϕ on ϕ over the Euclidean spacetime.\n\nThe inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is explicitly defined as:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) D_ϕ ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nwhere the integration is over the Euclidean spacetime volume (imaginary time τ from 0 to β, and all of spatial coordinates **x**). The operator D_ϕ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, which can be identified from the action after an integration by parts:\n\nD_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²\n\nTherefore, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature is:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nThe partition function for the free field is then expressed as:\n\nZ = ∫ Dϕ exp[-½ (ϕ, D_ϕ)]\n\nThis Gaussian functional integral can be formally evaluated to be proportional to (det D_ϕ)⁻¹/², where the determinant of the operator D_ϕ encodes the thermodynamic properties of the system.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (ϕ,D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the integral of the field ϕ multiplied by the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator acting on ϕ over the Euclidean spacetime. Explicitly, it is:\n\n(ϕ,D_ϕ) = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nwhere:\n*   τ is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β = 1/T (T is the temperature).\n*   **x** represents the spatial coordinates.\n*   ϕ(τ, **x**) is the neutral scalar field.\n*   D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m² is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.\n*   m is the mass of the scalar field."
