    "The greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nand\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\nis any 2x2 unimodular matrix. A polynomial matrix is unimodular if its determinant is a non-zero constant. The simplest and canonical representation of the GCRD in this case is the identity matrix.\n\nThe GCRD is found using the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This involves creating a composite matrix by stacking P1 and P2, and then reducing this matrix using elementary row operations, where multipliers are polynomials in 's'.\n\nThe composite matrix is:\nM = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n     [s, 0],\n     [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nThrough a sequence of valid elementary row operations, this matrix can be reduced to a form where the only non-zero rows are, for example, `[-1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`. These rows form a basis for the GCRD. Arranging them and making the leading entries positive gives the GCRD as:\nR = [,]\n\nSince the resulting GCRD is the identity matrix, which is unimodular (determinant is 1), the original matrices P1 and P2 are said to be right coprime. This means they do not share any common right divisors other than unimodular matrices. Any unimodular matrix is a valid GCRD for right coprime matrices, and the identity matrix is the standard choice.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
