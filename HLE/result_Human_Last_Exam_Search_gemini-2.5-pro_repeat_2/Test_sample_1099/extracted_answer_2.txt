The minimal average resources required to simulate the POVM correlations of a singlet state with an LHV model is either **one non-signaling PR-Box** (and zero communication) or **one bit of classical communication** (and zero PR-Boxes). On average, the communication cost can be slightly less than one bit depending on the distribution of measurement settings.
