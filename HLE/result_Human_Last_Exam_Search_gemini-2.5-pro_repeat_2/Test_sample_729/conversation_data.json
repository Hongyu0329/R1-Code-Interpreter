    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, has the following presentation:\nQ_128 = < x, y | x⁶⁴ = 1, x³² = y², yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹ >\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H such that H = Gⁿ = {gⁿ | g ∈ G} for some integer n. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of this form for G = Q_128.\n\nThe elements of Q_128 can be divided into two categories:\n1.  Elements in the cyclic subgroup <x>, which are of the form xⁱ for 0 ≤ i < 64.\n2.  Elements not in <x>, which are of the form xⁱy for 0 ≤ i < 64.\n\nLet's analyze the powers of these elements:\n\n*   For elements in <x>: (xⁱ)ⁿ = xⁱⁿ.\n*   For elements not in <x>:\n    (xⁱy)² = xⁱyxⁱy = xⁱ(yxⁱy⁻¹)y² = xⁱ(x⁻ⁱ)y² = y² = x³².\n    From this, we can deduce that (xⁱy)ⁿ is either a power of x or a power of x multiplied by y, depending on the parity of n.\n    If n is even, say n = 2k, then (xⁱy)²ᵏ = ((xⁱy)²)ᵏ = (x³²)ᵏ = x³²ᵏ.\n    If n is odd, say n = 2k+1, then (xⁱy)²ᵏ⁺¹ = (xⁱy)²ᵏ(xⁱy) = x³²ᵏxⁱy = x³²ᵏ⁺ⁱy.\n\nNow, let's determine the power subgroups Gⁿ for different values of n:\n\n*   **n is odd:**\n    *   { (xⁱ)ⁿ | 0 ≤ i < 64 } = { xⁱⁿ | 0 ≤ i < 64 }. Since n is odd, gcd(n, 64) = 1, so the set of powers {xⁱⁿ} is equal to the entire subgroup <x>.\n    *   { (xⁱy)ⁿ } = { x³²ᵏ⁺ⁱy }. As i ranges from 0 to 63, this set includes all elements of the form xʲy.\n    *   Therefore, for any odd n, Gⁿ = <x> ∪ {xʲy | 0 ≤ j < 64} = Q_128.\n\n*   **n = 2:**\n    *   { (xⁱ)² } = { x²ⁱ } = <x²>. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n    *   { (xⁱy)² } = { x³² }.\n    *   So, G² = <x²> ∪ {x³²}. Since x³² is already in <x²>, we have G² = <x²>.\n\n*   **n = 4:**\n    *   { (xⁱ)⁴ } = { x⁴ⁱ } = <x⁴>. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 16.\n    *   { (xⁱy)⁴ } = { (x³²)² } = { x⁶⁴ } = {1}.\n    *   So, G⁴ = <x⁴> ∪ {1} = <x⁴>.\n\n*   **n = 8:**\n    *   { (xⁱ)⁸ } = <x⁸> (order 8).\n    *   { (xⁱy)⁸ } = { (x³²)⁴ } = {1}.\n    *   So, G⁸ = <x⁸>.\n\n*   **n = 16:**\n    *   { (xⁱ)¹⁶ } = <x¹⁶> (order 4).\n    *   { (xⁱy)¹⁶ } = { (x³²)⁸ } = {1}.\n    *   So, G¹⁶ = <x¹⁶>.\n\n*   **n = 32:**\n    *   { (xⁱ)³² } = <x³²> (order 2).\n    *   { (xⁱy)³² } = { (x³²)¹⁶ } = {1}.\n    *   So, G³² = <x³²>.\n\n*   **n = 64:**\n    *   { (xⁱ)⁶⁴ } = {1}.\n    *   { (xⁱy)⁶⁴ } = { (x³²)³² } = {1}.\n    *   So, G⁶⁴ = {1}.\n\nAny other integer n can be written as n = 2ᵏm where m is odd. Then Gⁿ = (G²ᵏ)ᵐ = G²ᵏ. This means that any power subgroup is one of the subgroups calculated above.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups are:\n1.  Q_128\n2.  <x²>\n3.  <x⁴>\n4.  <x⁸>\n5.  <x¹⁶>\n6.  <x³²>\n7.  {1} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nCounting these distinct subgroups, we find there are 7 of them.\n\n<<<7>>>"
