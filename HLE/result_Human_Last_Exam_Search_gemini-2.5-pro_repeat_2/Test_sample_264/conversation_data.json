    "The calculation method for the intersection of two axis-aligned cubes is straightforward. You find the overlapping interval on each axis, and the product of the lengths of these intervals gives the volume of the intersection.\n\nHere's how to apply this to the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Cubes:** Let's place the first cube, C1, in the coordinate system such that its corners are at (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). This means its sides are aligned with the x, y, and z axes, and it is defined by the inequalities:\n    *   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n2.  **Define the Shift:** The second cube, C2, is shifted by a distance of 1/2 along the main diagonal. The main diagonal connects opposite vertices, for instance, (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). The direction vector for this diagonal is (1, 1, 1). A unit vector in this direction is (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3). The shift vector is therefore (1/2) * (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3) = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)).\n\n3.  **Position of the Second Cube:** C2 is obtained by shifting C1 by this vector. So, a point (x, y, z) is in C2 if:\n    *   1/(2√3) ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)\n    *   1/(2√3) ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)\n    *   1/(2√3) ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)\n\n4.  **Find the Intersection:** The intersection of the two cubes is a new shape defined by the coordinates that satisfy the conditions for both cubes. For each axis, we find the overlap:\n    *   **x-axis:** The interval is [max(0, 1/(2√3)), min(1, 1 + 1/(2√3))] = [1/(2√3), 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/(2√3).\n    *   **y-axis:** Similarly, the interval is [1/(2√3), 1]. The length is 1 - 1/(2√3).\n    *   **z-axis:** Again, the interval is [1/(2√3), 1]. The length is 1 - 1/(2√3).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Volume:** The intersection is a smaller cube with a side length of 1 - 1/(2√3). The volume is the cube of this side length.\n    *   Volume = (1 - 1/(2√3))³\n\n    This can be expanded and simplified:\n    *   Volume = 1³ - 3(1)²(1/(2√3)) + 3(1)(1/(2√3))² - (1/(2√3))³\n    *   Volume = 1 - 3/(2√3) + 3/(4 * 3) - 1/(8 * 3√3)\n    *   Volume = 1 - √3/2 + 1/4 - 1/(24√3)\n    *   Volume = 5/4 - √3/2 - √3/72\n    *   Volume = 5/4 - (36√3 + √3)/72\n    *   Volume = 5/4 - 37√3/72\n\nThis is the exact volume.\n\n<<<5/4 - 37*sqrt(3)/72>>>"
