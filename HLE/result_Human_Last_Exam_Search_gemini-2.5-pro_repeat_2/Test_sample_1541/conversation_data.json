    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem, followed by an analysis of its memory usage.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\nThe task is to read a string representing a sum of numbers, sort the numbers in non-decreasing order, and print the new sum. The user's problem description specifies that the numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4. The most memory-efficient approach avoids storing the entire input string. Instead, it processes the input character by character. A \"counting sort\" method is ideal here, as the set of possible numbers is very small. We can count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4) and then construct the sorted output string from these counts.\n\nThe official \"Helpful Maths\" (339A) problem on Codeforces limits the numbers to 1, 2, and 3. This solution adheres to the user's prompt, which includes the number 4.\n\n### Memory-Efficient C Program\n\nThis program reads the input one character at a time, counts the frequency of each number, and then prints the formatted sum. This method avoids allocating a large buffer to store the input string.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) separated by '+',\n * and prints the sum with the numbers sorted in non-decreasing order.\n * It is designed to be highly memory-efficient by not storing the\n * entire input string.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Array to store the frequency of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    // counts[0] for '1', counts[1] for '2', etc.\n    int counts[4] = {0};\n\n    // Variables for processing input and for loops.\n    char c;\n    int i, j;\n\n    // A flag to handle the printing of the '+' separator.\n    // Using char instead of int to save memory.\n    char first_term = 1;\n\n    // Read the input sum character by character and count the numbers.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '0' - 1]++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the new sum in sorted order.\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n            // Print '+' before each term except the very first one.\n            if (!first_term) {\n                putchar('+');\n            }\n            // Print the number character.\n            putchar(i + 1 + '0');\n            // Update the flag after the first term is printed.\n            first_term = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print a newline character at the end of the output.\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory usage `m` for variables is calculated by summing the sizes of all declared variables in the `main` function. The calculation assumes a standard environment where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n\n*   `int counts[4]`: An array of 4 integers. Memory = `4 * sizeof(int)` = `4 * 4` = **16 bytes**.\n*   `char c`: A single character variable. Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n*   `int i`: An integer loop counter. Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n*   `int j`: An integer loop counter. Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n*   `char first_term`: A character used as a boolean flag. Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 16 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 26 bytes.\n\n<<<26>>>"
