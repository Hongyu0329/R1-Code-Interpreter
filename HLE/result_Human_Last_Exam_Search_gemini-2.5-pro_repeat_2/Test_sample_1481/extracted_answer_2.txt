The leading-order behavior of the generating function H(s,s') in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation `δs = s' - s` approaches zero is given by the asymptotic expansion: `H(s, s') = |δs| - (κ(s)² / 24) |δs|³ + O(|δs|⁴)`. In this expression, the leading term `|δs|` represents the arc-length distance, while the next-order correction term, `-(κ(s)² / 24) |δs|³`, demonstrates that the true chord length is shorter than the arc length, with the deviation depending on the square of the local boundary curvature `κ(s)`. This term encapsulates the fundamental influence of the boundary's geometry on the billiard system's dynamics in the regime of grazing trajectories.
