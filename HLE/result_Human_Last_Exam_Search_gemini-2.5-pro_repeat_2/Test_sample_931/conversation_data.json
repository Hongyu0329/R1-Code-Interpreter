    "Adult Raphidopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are primarily predators. They have been recorded feeding on soft-bodied insects like aphids. In addition to being carnivorous, some adult snakeflies also consume pollen, and many can be found on plants with nectar-producing flowers. One source notes that adults may also feed on other sugary substances.\n\nBased on the provided options:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Supported, as they visit nectar-producing flowers and eat sugary substances.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** Supported, as they are known to eat pollen.\n*   **C. Fungus:** There is no evidence that they feed on fungus.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** There is no evidence that they feed on leaf tissue.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Supported, as they are well-documented predators of aphids.\n\nSince adult snakeflies have been recorded feeding on both nectar (and similar sugary substances) and aphids, the most accurate choice is F.\n\n<<<F>>>"
