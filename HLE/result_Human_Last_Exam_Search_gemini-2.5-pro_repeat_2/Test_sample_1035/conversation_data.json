    "The question asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that covers all the edges of the complete graph \\(K_n\\) with n=35. The phrasing \"number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" is ambiguous, but in the context of graph theory literature, it refers to a specific parameter. This parameter is the minimum of the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph in the covering family.\n\nLet the family of bipartite graphs be \\(\\mathcal{F} = \\{B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k\\}\\), where each \\(B_i\\) is a complete bipartite graph with bipartition \\(X_i \\cup Y_i\\). The family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is a cover for \\(K_n\\) if every edge of \\(K_n\\) is an edge in at least one of the graphs \\(B_i\\). The quantity to be minimized is the sum of the sizes of the vertex sets of these bipartite graphs, i.e., \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)| = \\sum_{i=1}^k (|X_i| + |Y_i|)\\).\n\nThis problem has been the subject of research, and there is a well-known conjecture by Akbari et al. that gives the minimum value. This conjecture has been reportedly proven. The formula for the minimum number of vertices, let's call it \\(f(n)\\), is:\n\\[ f(n) = n - 1 + \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\]\n\nFor the specific case of \\(K_{35}\\), we have \\(n=35\\). We can calculate the value using this formula:\n1.  First, calculate \\(n-1\\):\n    \\(35 - 1 = 34\\)\n\n2.  Next, calculate \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\):\n    We need to find the smallest integer power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 35.\n    \\(2^5 = 32\\)\n    \\(2^6 = 64\\)\n    Since 35 is between 32 and 64, \\(\\log_2 35\\) is between 5 and 6. The ceiling of this value is 6.\n    So, \\(\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6\\).\n\n3.  Finally, add the two parts together:\n    \\(f(35) = 34 + 6 = 40\\)\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of \\(K_{35}\\) is 40.\n\n<<<40>>>"
