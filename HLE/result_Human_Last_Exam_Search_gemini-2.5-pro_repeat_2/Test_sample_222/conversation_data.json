    "To find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for the 8-point sequence y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}, we must first understand the relationship between the sequences and their DFTs.\n\nLet the 8-point sequence be denoted by y(n). The problem asks for the 4-point DFT of this sequence, which implies a process of time-aliasing. We define a new 4-point sequence, z(n), by wrapping the 8-point sequence y(n) onto itself with a period of 4:\nz(n) = y(n) + y(n+4), for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nThe sequence y(n) is formed by interleaving the sequences x(n) and h(n):\n*   y(2m) = x(m) for m = {0, 1, 2, 3}\n*   y(2m+1) = h(m) for m = {0, 1, 2, 3}\n\nLet Y(k) be the 8-point DFT of y(n), and let Z(k) be the 4-point DFT of the aliased sequence z(n). The relationship between Z(k) and Y(k) is given by the property of time-aliasing, which states that Z(k) = Y(2k) for k = {0, 1, 2, 3}.\n\nNext, we can express the 8-point DFT Y(k) in terms of the given 4-point DFTs, X(k) and H(k). This is a standard result from the decimation-in-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm derivation. For an interleaved sequence like y(n), its DFT Y(k) is:\n*   Y(k) = X(k) + W₈ᵏ * H(k), for k = 0, 1, 2, 3\n*   Y(k+4) = X(k) - W₈ᵏ * H(k), for k = 0, 1, 2, 3\nwhere W₈ᵏ = e<sup>-j2πk/8</sup> is the twiddle factor.\n\nWe need to find Z(k) = {Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)}. Let's compute these values:\n\n1.  **Z(0) = Y(0)**\n    Using the formula for Y(k) with k=0:\n    Y(0) = X(0) + W₈⁰ * H(0) = X(0) + H(0)\n    Given X(0) = 1 and H(0) = 0:\n    Z(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n2.  **Z(1) = Y(2)**\n    Using the formula for Y(k) with k=2:\n    Y(2) = X(2) + W₈² * H(2)\n    We know W₈² = e<sup>-j2π(2)/8</sup> = e<sup>-jπ/2</sup> = -j.\n    Given X(2) = -1 and H(2) = 1:\n    Z(1) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j\n\n3.  **Z(2) = Y(4)**\n    Using the formula for Y(k+4) with k=0:\n    Y(4) = X(0) - W₈⁰ * H(0) = X(0) - H(0)\n    Given X(0) = 1 and H(0) = 0:\n    Z(2) = 1 - 0 = 1\n\n4.  **Z(3) = Y(6)**\n    Using the formula for Y(k+4) with k=2:\n    Y(6) = X(2) - W₈² * H(2)\n    We know W₈² = -j.\n    Given X(2) = -1 and H(2) = 1:\n    Z(3) = -1 - (-j) * 1 = -1 + j\n\nCombining these results, the 4-point DFT of the given sequence is:\nZ(k) = {1, -1-j, 1, -1+j}\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
