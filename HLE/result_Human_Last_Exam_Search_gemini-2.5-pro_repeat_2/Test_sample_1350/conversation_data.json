    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is a former thrall of the Romans, a man of the Gael, who describes their customs to the Goths. While the novel does not explicitly detail his account of their religious practices, the narrative strongly alludes to the worship of a she-wolf, a clear reference to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\nThis connection is most clearly made in Chapter IX, \"The Ancient Man of the Daylings,\" where a man of the Gael, who was captured in battle and enslaved by the Romans, recounts his experiences. He tells the Wolfings of the Romans' ways, and it is through his reports that the Goths learn of their enemy's societal structure and beliefs.\n\nThe allusion to Romulus and Remus is reinforced by the Goths' own totemâ€”the wolf. The Wolfings bear the image of a wolf on their banners and are marked with it on their chests. Furthermore, the character Hall-Sun has a significant childhood memory of playing with a \"she-wolf great and grisly,\" which further entwines the narrative with wolf symbolism.\n\nWhile the text does not provide a direct quote from the man of the Gael describing the Roman worship of a she-wolf, the juxtaposition of the Wolfings' own wolf emblem, Hall-Sun's memory, and the historical context of the Romulus and Remus myth strongly suggests that his account of Roman life would have included this recognizable religious practice.\n\n<<<A man of the Gael, a former thrall to the Romans.>>>"
