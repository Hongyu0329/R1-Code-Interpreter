The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

**IUPAC Name:** The IUPAC name for the final product C is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.

**Chirality:** The molecule 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane is **achiral**. A compound is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which typically arises from the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). In 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane (Br-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-Ph), none of the carbon atoms are bonded to four different groups. Therefore, the molecule does not have a chiral center and is achiral.
