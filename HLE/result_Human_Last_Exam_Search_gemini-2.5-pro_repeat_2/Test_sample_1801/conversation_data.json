    "The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and a second individual who has been described as an Indian commentator.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, a Nobel laureate in Physics, is explicitly identified in multiple sources as having appeared in the commercials. In a 2010 talk, Gell-Mann himself recounted being asked by a company, which he identified as Enron, to appear in a commercial to discuss the importance of questioning assumptions.\n\nThe identity of the second Nobel laureate remains less clear from the available information, with search results repeatedly referring to him as an \"Indian commentator\" who appeared alongside Gell-Mann. Despite searches for other prominent Nobel laureates of that era, a definitive identification of the second individual has not been found in the provided search results.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was launched by Enron in 2000 and was intended to portray the company as a forward-thinking and innovative organization that challenged conventional wisdom. The commercials aired before the full extent of the Enron scandal became public knowledge in 2001, leading to the company's bankruptcy.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and an unidentified Indian Nobel laureate>>>"
