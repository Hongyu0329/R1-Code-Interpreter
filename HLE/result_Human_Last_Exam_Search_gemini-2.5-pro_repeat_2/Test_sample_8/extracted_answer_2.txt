Let $X$ be the radial compactification of $\mathbb{R}^3$, and let $f \in \mathcal{A}^{2+\alpha}(X)$ be a conormal function of order $2+\alpha$. The resolvent $R(\sigma) = (\Box_g - \sigma^2)^{-1}$ associated with the wave operator on the Schwarzschild metric is a pseudodifferential operator of order -2. In the framework of geometric scattering theory and microlocal analysis on manifolds with boundaries, such an operator improves the conormal regularity by its order.

Therefore, the resolvent applied to the function $f$ results in a function in a new conormal space with an increased order of regularity. Specifically, the resulting function $u = R(\sigma)f$ belongs to the conormal space $\mathcal{A}^{4+\alpha}(X)$. This indicates that the solution $u$ is smoother than the source function $f$ by two orders on the conormal scale. This holds for regular values of the spectral parameter $\sigma$. The analysis of the low-frequency limit ($\sigma \to 0$) is more complex but is consistent with the resolvent being a smoothing operator of this order.
