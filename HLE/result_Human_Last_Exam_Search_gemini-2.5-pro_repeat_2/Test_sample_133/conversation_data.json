    "To win as fast as possible, 'O' must find a move that results in an immediate victory. Analyzing the board reveals a decisive move.\n\nThe current board contains a diagonal sequence of three 'O's. These are located at positions c6 (column c, row 6), d5, and e4. To complete a four-in-a-row and win the game on this turn, 'O' can place a token in column 'f' at row 3. The space at f3 is available, as the column is only filled up to row 5.\n\nBy placing a token at f3, 'O' creates a winning diagonal line from c6 to f3. A thorough check of all other possible moves confirms that no other move results in an immediate win. While some moves, such as c4 or f4, would create threats that guarantee a win on a subsequent turn, they are not optimal as they do not win as fast as possible.\n\nTherefore, there is only one optimal move for 'O' to win immediately.\n\n<<<f3>>>"
