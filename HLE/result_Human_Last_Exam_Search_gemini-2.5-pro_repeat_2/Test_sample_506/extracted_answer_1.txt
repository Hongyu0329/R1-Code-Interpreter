**1. Losartan (or another Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker - ARB):**
*   **Rationale:** An ARB is a first-line agent for hypertension and is strongly recommended for patients with diabetes, like MM (A1C of 6.7%), due to its proven renal-protective benefits. In African American patients with chronic kidney disease, an ARB or ACE inhibitor is recommended to reduce the risk of worsening kidney function. This class of medication works by blocking the renin-angiotensin system. Given that MM is on a failing three-drug regimen, ensuring a foundational, evidence-based medication like an ARB is crucial.

**2. Amlodipine (or another Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker - DHP-CCB):**
*   **Rationale:** Calcium channel blockers are a recommended first-line treatment for hypertension, especially in African American patients, where they have been shown to be very effective. An ARB and a CCB used in combination is a highly effective and recommended strategy for achieving blood pressure control. Since the patient cannot take verapamil (a non-DHP CCB), a DHP-CCB like amlodipine is an excellent choice.

**3. Spironolactone:**
*   **Rationale:** MM's blood pressure is uncontrolled despite being on three antihypertensive agents, which defines her condition as resistant hypertension. For patients with resistant hypertension, the addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) like spironolactone is the most effective and recommended fourth-line agent. The landmark PATHWAY-2 trial demonstrated that spironolactone was superior to other add-on therapies, including beta-blockers, in lowering blood pressure for these patients. Since most standard diuretics are excluded for this patient, using spironolactone as the third drug in the regimen directly targets the aldosterone pathway, a key driver of resistant hypertension. Her lab values, particularly SCr and potassium (not provided, but must be monitored), should be checked before and during therapy.
