    "To find the number of stable equilibria, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the given differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\nThe equilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$:\n$$\n-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n$$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$\n-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square:\n$$\n-x(x - 1)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the two equilibrium points.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of each equilibrium point. We can use the linearization method by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, which is $f'(x)$.\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1\n$$\nAn equilibrium point $x_0$ is stable if $f'(x_0) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(x_0) > 0$.\n\nLet's evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n1.  For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:\n    $$\n    f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1\n    $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point at $x = 0$ is stable.\n\n2.  For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:\n    $$\n    f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0\n    $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the linearization test is inconclusive for this point. We must use another method, such as analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n\nLet's analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$:\n*   If $x$ is slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 + \\epsilon$ for some small $\\epsilon > 0$), then $x > 0$ and $(x-1)^2 > 0$. Thus, $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ is negative. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards 1.\n*   If $x$ is slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for some small $\\epsilon > 0$ with $1-\\epsilon > 0$), then $x > 0$ and $(x-1)^2 > 0$. Thus, $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ is also negative. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from 1.\n\nFor an equilibrium to be stable, trajectories from both sides must converge to the equilibrium point. Since trajectories from the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium at $x=1$ is not stable (it is considered semi-stable).\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. The number of stable equilibria is $m = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$, we get:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
