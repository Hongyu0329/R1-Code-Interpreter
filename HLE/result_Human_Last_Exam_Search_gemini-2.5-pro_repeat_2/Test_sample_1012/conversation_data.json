    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer poses a significant threat to symmetric key cryptography primarily through Grover's algorithm. This algorithm can drastically reduce the time needed for a brute-force attack to find the correct key.\n\nEssentially, Grover's algorithm cuts the effective security of a symmetric key in half. This means that a 128-bit AES key, which is considered very secure against classical computers, would only offer the security equivalent of a 64-bit key against a quantum computer, rendering it insufficient. Similarly, a 256-bit key's strength would be reduced to that of a 128-bit key.\n\nTo counteract this quantum threat and maintain a sufficient level of security, the generally accepted recommendation is to double the key length. For a security level that is considered safe against quantum attacks, a symmetric key length of at least 256 bits is recommended. This provides an effective security of 128 bits, which is widely considered to be secure for the foreseeable future.\n\nTherefore, to be secure against an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long.\n\n<<<A>>>"
