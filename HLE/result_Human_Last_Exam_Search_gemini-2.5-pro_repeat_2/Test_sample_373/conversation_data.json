    "In a 10-node barbell graph with uniform weights, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge during randomized uniform gossiping is 1/25. This conclusion is reached through the following analysis:\n\n### 1. Structure of a 10-Node Barbell Graph\n\nA barbell graph is constructed by connecting two separate, complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge, known as a bridge or bottleneck edge. For a 10-node barbell graph, the most common structure consists of two 5-node cliques (K5). One node from the first clique is connected to one node from the second clique by the bottleneck edge.\n\nLet's denote the two cliques as C1 and C2. Let the node `u` in C1 be connected to the node `v` in C2 via the bottleneck edge.\n\n### 2. Node Degrees\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. In a 5-node complete graph, each node is connected to the other four nodes.\n\n*   **Nodes `u` and `v`**: These are the endpoints of the bottleneck edge. Node `u` is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique (C1) and to node `v`. Therefore, the degree of `u` is 4 + 1 = 5. Similarly, node `v` is connected to the 4 nodes in its clique (C2) and to node `u`, giving it a degree of 5.\n*   **Other Nodes**: The remaining 8 nodes (4 in each clique) are only connected to the other 4 nodes within their respective cliques. Thus, each of these 8 nodes has a degree of 4.\n\n### 3. Randomized Uniform Gossiping\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping is a process where nodes in a network exchange information with their neighbors. The standard procedure involves two steps:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from the entire network.\n2.  The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to communicate with. The edge between these two nodes is considered \"sampled\".\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability\n\nThe bottleneck edge (`u, v`) is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n1.  Node `u` is selected and it chooses to gossip with node `v`.\n2.  Node `v` is selected and it chooses to gossip with node `u`.\n\nThe probability of each event is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Event 1 (u to v)**:\n    *   The probability of selecting node `u` from the 10 nodes is 1/10.\n    *   Given that `u` is selected, it has 5 neighbors. The probability that it chooses `v` is 1/5.\n    *   The total probability for this event is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\n*   **Event 2 (v to u)**:\n    *   The probability of selecting node `v` from the 10 nodes is 1/10.\n    *   Given that `v` is selected, it has 5 neighbors. The probability that it chooses `u` is 1/5.\n    *   The total probability for this event is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n\nP(bottleneck edge sampled) = P(u to v) + P(v to u) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 0.04.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
