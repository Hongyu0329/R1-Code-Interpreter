    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number 13/16 in Red-Blue Hackenbush, one must first express the fraction in binary and then construct the corresponding game. In combinatorial game theory, numbers are represented by the sum of simpler games.\n\n### 1. Binary Representation\nFirst, convert the fraction 13/16 to its binary form:\n13/16 = 8/16 + 4/16 + 1/16 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/16\n\nIn binary notation, this is:\n`0.1101₂`\n\nThis representation shows that the game for 13/16 is the sum of the games for 1/2, 1/4, and 1/16.\n\n### 2. Hackenbush Representation of Powers of Two\nIn Red-Blue Hackenbush, dyadic fractions (fractions with a power of two in the denominator) have canonical representations. Specifically, the value `1/2ⁿ` is represented by a single stalk of `n+1` pieces. This stalk consists of one red piece at the base and `n` blue pieces stacked on top of it.\n\nLet's find the number of pieces for each component of 13/16:\n*   **For 1/2 (n=1):** The game is represented by one blue piece on top of one red piece (B-R). This requires **2 pieces**.\n*   **For 1/4 (n=2):** The game is represented by two blue pieces on top of one red piece (B-B-R). This requires **3 pieces**.\n*   **For 1/16 (n=4):** The game is represented by four blue pieces on top of one red piece (B-B-B-B-R). This requires **5 pieces**.\n\n### 3. Total Number of Pieces\nThe game for 13/16 is the side-by-side combination of these three stalks, all connected to the ground. The total number of pieces is the sum of the pieces in each individual stalk.\n\nTotal Pieces = (Pieces for 1/2) + (Pieces for 1/4) + (Pieces for 1/16)\nTotal Pieces = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10\n\nThus, 10 pieces are needed to represent the number 13/16 in Red-Blue Hackenbush. This consists of 3 red pieces and 7 blue pieces.\n\n<<<10>>>"
