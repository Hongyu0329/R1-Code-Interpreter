    "To determine which transformation is not possible for a unitary quantum gate, we must check if the transformation is consistent with the properties of unitary operators. A key property of any quantum gate `U` is that it must be a linear operator. This means for any states `|ψ₁⟩`, `|ψ₂⟩` and complex numbers `α`, `β`, the following must hold:\n\n`U(α|ψ₁⟩ + β|ψ₂⟩) = αU|ψ₁⟩ + βU|ψ₂⟩`\n\nThe transformations are given for the rays of the states, meaning the output state is defined up to a global phase factor. Let `T(|ψ⟩)` be the transformation of a basis state `|ψ⟩` as given in an answer choice. A unitary gate `U` can realize this transformation if there exist complex phase factors `c_ψ` (with `|c_ψ|=1`) for each basis state `|ψ⟩` such that `U|ψ⟩ = c_ψ T(|ψ⟩)` for all `|ψ⟩` in the set, and the linearity condition is satisfied.\n\nWe can test the linearity by using the definitions of the basis states. For example, `|+⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`.\nApplying a linear operator `U` to `|+⟩` must yield:\n`U|+⟩ = U(1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩)) = 1/√2 (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`\n\nLet's check this condition for the given transformations.\n\n**Answer Choice P:**\nThe transformation is given as:\n*   `T(∣0⟩) = ∣-⟩`\n*   `T(∣1⟩) = ∣+⟩`\n*   `T(∣+⟩) = ∣-i⟩`\n*   `T(∣-⟩) = ∣i⟩`\n*   `T(∣i⟩) = ∣0⟩`\n*   `T(∣-i⟩) = ∣1⟩`\n\nAccording to the rules of a unitary transformation, there must be phase factors `c_0`, `c_1`, `c_+` such that:\n*   `U|0⟩ = c_0 |−⟩`\n*   `U|1⟩ = c_1 |+⟩`\n*   `U|+⟩ = c_+ |−i⟩`\n\nNow, let's apply the linearity condition to `|+⟩`:\n`U|+⟩ = 1/√2 (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`\nSubstituting the transformations:\n`c_+ |−i⟩ = 1/√2 (c_0 |−⟩ + c_1 |+⟩)`\n\nLet's express the states on the right side in the computational basis:\n*   `|−⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ − |1⟩)`\n*   `|+⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n\nSo, `c_+ |−i⟩ = 1/√2 (c_0 * 1/√2 (|0⟩ − |1⟩) + c_1 * 1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩))`\n`c_+ |−i⟩ = 1/2 ( (c_0 + c_1)|0⟩ + (−c_0 + c_1)|1⟩ )`\n\nNow, let's express `|-i⟩` in the computational basis: `|-i⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`.\n`c_+ * 1/√2 (|0⟩ - i|1⟩) = 1/2 ( (c_0 + c_1)|0⟩ + (−c_0 + c_1)|1⟩ )`\n\nFor this equality to hold, the coefficients of the basis vectors `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` on both sides must be equal.\n\n1.  Comparing coefficients of `|0⟩`:\n    `c_+ /√2 = 1/2 (c_0 + c_1)`\n    `c_+ = (c_0 + c_1)/√2`\n\n2.  Comparing coefficients of `|1⟩`:\n    `-i * c_+ /√2 = 1/2 (−c_0 + c_1)`\n    `-i * c_+ = (−c_0 + c_1)/√2`\n\nNow we have a system of two equations for the phase factors. Let's substitute the first equation into the second:\n`-i * ( (c_0 + c_1)/√2 ) = (−c_0 + c_1)/√2`\n`-i(c_0 + c_1) = -c_0 + c_1`\n`-i*c_0 - i*c_1 = -c_0 + c_1`\n`c_0(1 - i) = c_1(1 + i)`\n`c_1 = c_0 * (1 - i)/(1 + i) = c_0 * (1 - i)² / ((1+i)(1-i)) = c_0 * (1 - 2i - 1)/2 = c_0 * (-2i)/2 = -i * c_0`\nSo, we must have the relation `c_1 = -i * c_0`. Since `|c_0| = |c_1| = 1`, this is a valid relationship between phase factors as `|-i|=1`.\n\nNow let's test the linearity for another state, for example `|i⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`.\n`U|i⟩ = 1/√2 (U|0⟩ + iU|1⟩)`\n\nFrom the transformation list, `T(|i⟩) = |0⟩`, so `U|i⟩ = c_i |0⟩`.\n`c_i |0⟩ = 1/√2 (c_0 |−⟩ + i * c_1 |+⟩)`\n`c_i |0⟩ = 1/2 ( c_0(|0⟩−|1⟩) + i * c_1(|0⟩+|1⟩) )`\n`c_i |0⟩ = 1/2 ( (c_0 + i*c_1)|0⟩ + (−c_0 + i*c_1)|1⟩ )`\n\nFor this equality to hold, the coefficient of `|1⟩` on the right side must be zero.\n`-c_0 + i*c_1 = 0`\n`c_0 = i*c_1`\n\nNow we have two necessary conditions for the phase factors:\n1.  `c_1 = -i * c_0`\n2.  `c_0 = i * c_1`\n\nLet's see if these are compatible. Substitute (1) into (2):\n`c_0 = i * (-i * c_0)`\n`c_0 = -i² * c_0`\n`c_0 = 1 * c_0`\n`c_0 = c_0`\nThis shows that the conditions are consistent with each other.\n\nLet's test a third linear relationship, `|-⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ - |1⟩)`.\n`U|−⟩ = 1/√2 (U|0⟩ − U|1⟩)`\nFrom the list, `T(|-⟩) = |i⟩`, so `U|-⟩ = c_- |i⟩`.\n`c_- |i⟩ = 1/√2 (c_0|−⟩ - c_1|+⟩)`\nUsing `c_1 = -i*c_0`:\n`c_- |i⟩ = 1/√2 (c_0|−⟩ - (-i*c_0)|+⟩) = c_0/√2 (|−⟩ + i|+⟩)`\nLet's expand the right side:\n`|−⟩ + i|+⟩ = 1/√2(|0⟩−|1⟩) + i * 1/√2(|0⟩+|1⟩) = 1/√2( (1+i)|0⟩ + (i-1)|1⟩ )`\nSo, `c_- |i⟩ = c_0/√2 * 1/√2( (1+i)|0⟩ + (i-1)|1⟩ ) = c_0/2 ( (1+i)|0⟩ + (i-1)|1⟩ )`\nNow expand the left side, `|i⟩ = 1/√2(|0⟩+i|1⟩)`:\n`c_- * 1/√2(|0⟩+i|1⟩) = c_0/2 ( (1+i)|0⟩ + (i-1)|1⟩ )`\n\nComparing coefficients for `|0⟩`:\n`c_- /√2 = c_0/2 (1+i)`\n`c_- = c_0 * (1+i)/√2`\n\nComparing coefficients for `|1⟩`:\n`i*c_- /√2 = c_0/2 (i-1)`\n`i*c_- = c_0 * (i-1)/√2`\n`c_- = c_0 * (i-1)/(i√2) = c_0 * (i-1)(-i)/(i√2(-i)) = c_0 * (-i²+i)/√2 = c_0 * (1+i)/√2`\nThe two equations give the same result for `c_-`.\n\nHowever, let's go back to the equations derived from `U|+⟩`:\n`c_+ = (c_0 + c_1)/√2` and `-i * c_+ = (−c_0 + c_1)/√2`.\nSubstituting `c_1 = -i*c_0` into the first equation:\n`c_+ = (c_0 - i*c_0)/√2 = c_0(1-i)/√2`.\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\nLeft Hand Side: `-i * c_+ = -i * c_0(1-i)/√2 = c_0(-i-1)/√2`.\nRight Hand Side: `(−c_0 + c_1)/√2 = (-c_0 - i*c_0)/√2 = c_0(-1-i)/√2`.\nThe left and right sides are equal. The conditions derived from `U|+⟩` are consistent with `c_1 = -i*c_0`.\n\nIt appears my initial analysis pointing to a contradiction was flawed. Let's re-examine `c_0=ic_1` and `-i(c_0+c_1) = -c_0+c_1`.\nIf `c_0=ic_1`, then `-i(ic_1+c_1) = -ic_1+c_1`.\n`-i(c_1(i+1)) = c_1(1-i)`.\n`-ic_1(i+1) = c_1(1-i)`.\n`c_1(1-i) = c_1(1-i)`. This is consistent.\n\nLet's re-check the derivation of `c_0=ic_1`.\n`c_i |0⟩ = 1/2 ( (c_0 + i*c_1)|0⟩ + (−c_0 + i*c_1)|1⟩ )`\n`|1⟩` component must be zero: `-c_0 + i*c_1 = 0 => c_0 = i*c_1`. This is correct.\nLet's re-check the derivation `c_1 = -i*c_0`.\nFrom `c_0(1 - i) = c_1(1 + i)`. This comes from `U|+>`.\n`c_1 = c_0 * (1-i)/(1+i) = c_0 * (-i)`. This is correct.\n\nSo we have two conditions that must hold simultaneously:\n1. `c_0 = i * c_1`\n2. `c_1 = -i * c_0`\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`c_0 = i * (-i * c_0) = -i² * c_0 = 1 * c_0`.\nThis is consistent.\n\nThere is no contradiction found in the linearity property. Let's re-examine the problem. A property of unitary operations is that they preserve the magnitude of inner products: `|<Uψ|Uφ>|^2 = |<ψ|φ>|^2`. Let's test this simpler property.\n\nFor **Answer Choice F**:\n`T(∣0⟩)=∣+⟩, T(∣1⟩)=∣-⟩, T(∣+⟩)=∣1⟩, T(∣-⟩)=∣0⟩, T(∣i⟩)=∣i⟩, T(∣-i⟩)=∣-i⟩`\nLet's check the inner product of `|0⟩` and `|i⟩`: `|<0|i>|^2 = |1/√2|^2 = 1/2`.\nThe transformed states are `T(|0⟩)=|+⟩` and `T(|i⟩)=|i⟩`.\nTheir inner product is `|<+|i>|^2 = |(1-i)/2|^2 = (1²+(-1)²)/4 = 2/4 = 1/2`. This is preserved.\n\nLet's check the inner product of `|+⟩` and `|i⟩`: `|<+|i>|^2 = 1/2`.\nThe transformed states are `T(|+⟩)=|1⟩` and `T(|i⟩)=|i⟩`.\nTheir inner product is `|<1|i>|^2 = |i/√2|^2 = 1/2`. This is preserved.\n\nThere must be a more subtle error. Let's re-examine the linearity check for F.\n`U|+> = 1/√2(U|0>+U|1>)`.\n`c_+|1> = 1/√2(c_0|+> + c_1|->) = 1/2((c_0+c_1)|0> + (c_0-c_1)|1>)`.\nThis implies `c_0+c_1=0` (so `c_1=-c_0`) and `c_+ = 1/2(c_0-c_1) = 1/2(2c_0) = c_0`.\nThis is a consistent set of phase relations.\nNow check `U|i> = 1/√2(U|0>+iU|1>)`.\n`c_i|i> = 1/√2(c_0|+> + i(-c_0)|->) = c_0/√2(|+> - i|->)`.\n`|+> - i|-> = 1/√2((1-i)|0> + (1+i)|1>)`.\n`c_i|i> = c_0/2((1-i)|0> + (1+i)|1>)`.\nThe vector on the right is `(1-i, 1+i)`. The vector for `|i>` is `(1,i)`.\nThe ratio of components on the right is `(1+i)/(1-i)=i`. The ratio on the left is `i/1=i`. They are proportional.\n`c_i(1,i) = c_0/2(1-i, 1+i) = c_0/2 (1-i) * (1, i)`.\n`c_i = c_0/2 (1-i)`.\nLet's check the magnitudes: `|c_i|=1`, `|c_0|=1`.\n`1 = 1/2 |1-i| = √2/2 = 1/√2`.\n`1 = 1/√2` is a contradiction. Therefore, the transformation F is not possible.\n\n<<<F>>>"
