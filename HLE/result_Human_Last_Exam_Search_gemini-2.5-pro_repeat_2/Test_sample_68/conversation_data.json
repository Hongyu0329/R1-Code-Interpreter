    "The smallest algebraic structure that allows for the coloring of the figure eight knot is the dihedral quandle of order 5, which has 5 elements. This is because the figure eight knot is known to be 5-colorable, but not 3-colorable.\n\nKnot coloring is a way to create a knot invariant, which helps to distinguish different knots from one another. For a knot to be \"n-colorable\", one must be able to assign one of 'n' colors to each arc of the knot diagram, following two rules:\n1.  At least two colors must be used.\n2.  At each crossing, the three meeting arcs are either all the same color or all different colors.\n\nA more general algebraic formulation of this is through the concept of a \"quandle\". A quandle is a set with a binary operation that captures the essential properties of knot crossings. A knot is colorable by a particular quandle if there is a non-trivial homomorphism from the knot's \"fundamental quandle\" to that quandle. A non-trivial coloring is one that uses more than one color.\n\nFor the figure eight knot, it has been established that it cannot be colored with a 3-element quandle (it is not 3-colorable). However, it can be colored with the dihedral quandle of order 5, denoted as R5. This quandle has 5 elements. Research confirms that a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot exists using the elements of R5. In fact, for a minimal diagram of the figure eight knot, a non-trivial coloring will use four of the five available colors from R5.\n\nSince the figure eight knot is not colorable by any non-trivial quandle with fewer than 5 elements, the dihedral quandle of order 5 represents the smallest such algebraic structure.\n\n<<<5>>>"
