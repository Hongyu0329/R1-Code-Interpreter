The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is not fixed and varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an effective range for Ni loading is between 5 wt% and 12.5 wt%, with some studies indicating an optimal molar proportion of around 7%. In the case of water splitting, the optimal ratio is highly dependent on the overall composition of the catalyst, with effective Ni:Ce molar ratios ranging from 9:1 to systems where Ni is a co-dopant in equal proportion to other elements.
