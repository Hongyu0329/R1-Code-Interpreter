    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow a systematic approach.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we determine the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. A search reveals that:\n$d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor is a product of four distinct odd primes.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a composite number $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ is a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime factor $p_i$, such that $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$. For $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character modulo its respective prime $p_i$. When the modulus is a prime $p$, any non-trivial character is primitive.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. We are looking for characters of order 6, which means $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Characters of a Specific Order\nThe number of Dirichlet characters of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by $\\phi(k)$ (Euler's totient function), provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nFor our conductor $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$, we analyze the condition for the orders of the component characters:\n*   **For $p_1=7$:** $p_1-1 = 6$. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The number of characters for each order are:\n    *   Order 1: $\\phi(1) = 1$ (the trivial character)\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n*   **For $p_2=13$:** $p_2-1 = 12$. The divisors of 12 that are also divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Order 1: $\\phi(1) = 1$\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n*   **For $p_3=19$:** $p_3-1 = 18$. The divisors of 18 that are also divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Order 1: $\\phi(1) = 1$\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n*   **For $p_4=31$:** $p_4-1 = 30$. The divisors of 30 that are also divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Order 1: $\\phi(1) = 1$\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\nFor the combined character $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $d$, none of the component characters $\\chi_i$ can be the trivial character (order 1). Therefore, the possible orders for each $\\chi_i$ are 2, 3, and 6.\n\n### Step 4: Combinatorial Calculation\nLet $S_k$ be the set of non-trivial characters whose orders are divisors of $k$.\nLet $N_k$ be the number of non-trivial characters for a given prime factor whose order divides $k$.\n*   For $k=1$: $N_1 = 0$ (as we exclude the trivial character).\n*   For $k=2$: The only non-trivial order dividing 2 is 2. So, $N_2 = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   For $k=3$: The only non-trivial order dividing 3 is 3. So, $N_3 = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   For $k=6$: The non-trivial orders dividing 6 are 2, 3, and 6. So, $N_6 = \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\nLet $C(d, k)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ and order dividing $k$. Since $d$ is a product of four distinct primes, we have:\n*   $C(d, 6) = (N_6)^4 = 5^4 = 625$. This is the number of characters where the order of each component divides 6.\n*   $C(d, 3) = (N_3)^4 = 2^4 = 16$. This is the number of characters where the order of each component divides 3 (i.e., is 1 or 3, but we exclude the all-trivial case, however the formula for $N_k$ already handles non-trivial characters).\n*   $C(d, 2) = (N_2)^4 = 1^4 = 1$. This is the number of characters where the order of each component divides 2.\n*   $C(d, 1) = (N_1)^4 = 0^4 = 0$.\n\nThe number of characters of exact order 6 is the number of characters with order dividing 6, minus those with orders dividing 3 or 2 (to avoid double-counting, we use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion).\nNumber of characters of order 6 = $C(d, 6) - C(d, 3) - C(d, 2) + C(d, \\text{gcd}(2,3)=1)$.\nNumber = $625 - 16 - 1 + 0 = 608$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order 6 is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
