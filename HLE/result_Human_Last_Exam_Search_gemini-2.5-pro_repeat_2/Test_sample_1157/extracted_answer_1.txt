The appropriate management for the patient involves immediate, yet temporary, delayed replantation of the avulsed teeth to preserve alveolar bone, followed by fabrication of a cast metal removable partial denture for long-term prosthetic replacement, with abutment teeth including the left central incisor, left second premolar, and right-sided teeth for cross-arch stabilization. The cells of interest are primarily the non-viable periodontal ligament cells, and the osteoblasts and osteoclasts involved in the subsequent ankylosis and resorption of the replanted teeth.
