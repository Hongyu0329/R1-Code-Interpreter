    "Following the rules of the one-dimensional cellular automaton Rule 110, starting from a single cell in state 1 and applying the rule for 20 iterations, the resulting binary pattern is:\n\n**11101101111100110111**\n\nTo arrive at this result, a simulation of the cellular automaton was performed. Rule 110 dictates the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors. The rule can be summarized as follows, where the triplet represents the left neighbor, the cell itself, and the right neighbor, and the result is the cell's state in the subsequent generation:\n\n| Neighborhood | New State |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nThe simulation begins with an initial state of a single '1' surrounded by '0's (`...0001000...`). Applying the rule iteratively generates the following patterns for each generation. The evolution of Rule 110 is known for its complex and seemingly chaotic behavior, despite the simplicity of its rules. After 20 such iterations, the specific non-zero part of the pattern is the sequence provided above.\n\n<<<11101101111100110111>>>"
