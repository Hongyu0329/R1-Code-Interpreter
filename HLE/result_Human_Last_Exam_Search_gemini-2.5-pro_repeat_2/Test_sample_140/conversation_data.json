    "The problem of determining the maximum number of blocks that can fit into a larger container is a classic packing problem. The answer cannot be found simply by dividing the volume of the cube by the volume of a single block, as this does not account for the geometric constraints of fitting the blocks.\n\nA straightforward approach is to align all the blocks in one direction. Given a 15x15x15 cube and 9x1x1 blocks, you can fit one layer of blocks along the 15-unit edge, leaving a remainder. This method results in a total of 315 blocks, with a significant amount of wasted space.\n\nA more efficient method involves partitioning the cube. By dividing the 15x15x15 cube into smaller cuboids based on the dimensions of the block (9 and 15-9=6), a more optimal packing arrangement can be found. The cube can be broken down into eight smaller blocks:\n*   One 9x9x9 block\n*   Three 9x9x6 blocks\n*   Three 9x6x6 blocks\n*   One 6x6x6 block\n\nCalculating the number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit into each of these smaller cuboids:\n*   The 9x9x9 block can be perfectly filled with 81 blocks.\n*   Each of the three 9x9x6 blocks can be filled with 54 blocks, for a total of 162 blocks.\n*   Each of the three 9x6x6 blocks can be filled with 36 blocks, for a total of 108 blocks.\n*   The 6x6x6 block cannot fit any 9x1x1 blocks, as its largest dimension is smaller than 9.\n\nSumming these amounts gives a total of 81 + 162 + 108 = 351 blocks. This packing method is valid as the sub-blocks are tiled together to form the larger cube, and the blocks are contained within them. This leaves a wasted space of a single 6x6x6 cube, which cannot be filled. It has been shown that a perfect tiling is not possible.\n\n<<<351>>>"
