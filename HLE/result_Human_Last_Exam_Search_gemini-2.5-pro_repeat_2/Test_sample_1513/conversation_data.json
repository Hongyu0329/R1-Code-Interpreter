    "Based on the evidence, the island town is Hanga Roa.\n\nHanga Roa is the main town and capital of Easter Island (Rapa Nui). The island is one of the most remote inhabited places in the world, with its nearest inhabited neighbor, Pitcairn Island, located over 2,000 kilometers away, which is significantly more than the 500-kilometer requirement.\n\nThe town's name, Hanga Roa, translates to \"long bay\" or \"wide bay\" in the Rapa Nui language, and it is situated on a bay of the same name. The town and its bay are located on the island's west coast, nestled in the lowlands between the extinct volcanoes of Maunga Terevaka and Rano Kau. The Rano Kau volcano, which has a large crater lake, is one of the three main volcanoes that formed the island, and its collapsed southern side forms cliffs by the sea. The bay of Hanga Roa lies in the lowlands at the foot of this volcano, within the landscape shaped by its formation and caldera.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
