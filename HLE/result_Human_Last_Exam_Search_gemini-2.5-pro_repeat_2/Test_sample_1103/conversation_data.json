    "The number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48 has been determined as part of the complete resolution of the Gauss class number problem for class numbers up to 100 by Mark Watkins.\n\nBased on the tables compiled by Watkins, there are 243 negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48. These results are foundational in the field of algebraic number theory and are accessible through mathematical databases such as the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB).\n\nThe work to determine the class number for various fields has a long history, with Watkins' computational results for all class numbers up to 100 being a significant milestone. This extensive computation confirmed the number of fundamental discriminants for each of these class numbers, including 48.\n\n<<<243>>>"
