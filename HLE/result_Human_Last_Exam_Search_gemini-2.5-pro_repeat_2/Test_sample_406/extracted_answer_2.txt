A set of conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z can be summarized as follows:
1.  **Space**: The functions are defined on a product of partially ordered complete metric spaces (X, d_X, ≤_X), (Y, d_Y, ≤_Y), and (Z, d_Z, ≤_Z).
2.  **Continuity**: The functions F, G, and H are continuous. This can sometimes be relaxed if the space is regular.
3.  **Mixed Monotonicity**: The functions exhibit a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial orders on the spaces.
4.  **Contractive Condition**: The functions satisfy a contractive condition that reduces the distance between points upon successive applications.
5.  **Initial Point**: There exists an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies a specific order relation with the functions F, G, and H.
