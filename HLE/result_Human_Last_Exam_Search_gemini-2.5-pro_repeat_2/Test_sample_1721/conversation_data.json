    "The problem asks for the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a subset $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ for which the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1+a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no square numbers. This is a well-known problem in additive number theory, and the exact value of $c$ is still an open question. However, there are established lower and upper bounds for $c$.\n\nA simple construction provides a lower bound for $c$. Consider the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\}$. The size of this set is approximately $N/3$. For any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum is $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. However, square numbers are always congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. Thus, the sumset $A+A$ cannot contain any squares. This construction shows that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nFor a long time, it was unknown if a density greater than $1/3$ was possible. More complex constructions have since been developed to achieve a higher density. For instance, combining conditions on different moduli has led to better lower bounds.\n\nRegarding the upper bound, a significant result was achieved by J. Cilleruelo, who proved that the density $c$ cannot exceed $3/8$. The proof is based on analytical methods and provides a hard limit on how dense such a set can be.\n\nThe exact value of $c$ lies in an interval defined by the best-known lower and upper bounds. As of the latest research, the gap between these bounds has been narrowed, but they do not yet meet. The problem remains a subject of active research.\n\nGiven the current state of knowledge, the largest number $c$ is not known precisely. The best proven upper bound for $c$ is $3/8$.\n\n<<<3/8>>>"
