    "There are **infinitely** many finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for any two elements *a* and *b* in *S* (which need not be distinct), their product *ab* is not in *S*. Such a set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (or \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was completed by M. Giudici and S. Hart. Their work reveals that an infinite number of groups possess this property.\n\nThe groups that have a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2, denoted as *S* = {*a*, *b*}, fall into several categories:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** The cyclic group of order *n*, denoted *C<sub>n</sub>*, has a maximal product-free set of size 2 if and only if *n* is one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 12.\n*   **Dihedral Groups:** The dihedral group of order 2*n*, denoted *D<sub>2n</sub>*, has a maximal product-free set of size 2 if and only if *n* is one of 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n*   **The Quaternion Group:** The quaternion group of order 8, *Q<sub>8</sub>*.\n*   **An infinite family of groups:** For any prime *p* and any integer *n* ≥ 1, the group *C<sub>p</sub>* x *C<sub>p<sup>n</sup></sub>* (the direct product of the cyclic group of order *p* and the cyclic group of order *p<sup>n</sup>*) contains a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n*   **Another infinite family of groups:** For any prime *p* and any integer *n* ≥ 1, the group *C<sub>p</sub>* ⋊ *C<sub>p<sup>n</sup></sub>* (a semidirect product) has a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nSince there are infinitely many prime numbers *p* and infinitely many integers *n*, the last two categories each constitute an infinite number of finite groups. Therefore, there is no finite count of the groups with this property.\n\n<<<infinitely many>>>"
