    "To determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes in a graph with n=128 vertices, we must first clarify the terminology.\n\nA **clique** is a subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. The subgraph formed by these vertices is a complete graph (K_k, where k is the size of the clique). An \"induced K_k\" is, by definition, a clique of size k.\n\nThe crucial point is that if a graph contains a clique of a certain size, it inherently contains cliques of all smaller sizes. Let's say a graph G has a maximum clique of size `k_max` (this is known as the clique number, ω(G)). This means there is a set of `k_max` vertices that are all connected to each other. Any subset of these `k_max` vertices also forms a clique.\n\nTherefore, if a graph has a clique of size `k_max`, it automatically has cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., up to `k_max`. The set of all possible clique sizes in a given graph G is always the interval of integers {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}.\n\nThe problem then simplifies to finding the maximum possible clique number, ω(G), for any graph G with 128 vertices. The number of vertices in a clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. Thus, for a graph with 128 vertices, the clique number can be at most 128.\n\nA complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted K_128, is a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this graph, the set of all 128 vertices forms a clique. The clique number of K_128 is 128. Consequently, for any integer `k` from 1 to 128, one can select any `k` vertices from K_128, and they will form an induced K_k.\n\nThis means that the complete graph K_128 contains induced subgraphs of every clique size from 1 to 128. The set of different clique sizes is {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}, and the number of these sizes is 128. No graph on 128 vertices can have a clique of size greater than 128.\n\nThus, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
