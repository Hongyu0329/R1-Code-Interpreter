    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA homogeneous planar continuum is a compact, connected subset of the plane that is homogeneous, meaning that for any two points in the space, there is a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps the first point to the second.\n\nA complete classification of these continua shows that, up to homeomorphism, there are only the following four types:\n*   The single point\n*   The circle.\n*   The pseudo-arc.\n*   The circle of pseudo-arcs.\n\nA significant result in this area of topology, established by L.G. Oversteegen and L.C. Hoehn in 2014, demonstrates that any non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane must be homeomorphic to one of the latter three examples. The degenerate case of a single point is also a homogeneous planar continuum. Therefore, there are a total of four distinct homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
