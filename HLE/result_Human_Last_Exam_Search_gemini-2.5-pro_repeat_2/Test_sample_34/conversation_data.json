    "Based on the analysis of multiple GTO (Game Theory Optimal) and simplified pre-flop opening range charts for 100BB cash games, the worst suited jack you should consider opening from the button can be determined.\n\nSeveral sources provide baseline opening ranges for the button position in a 100bb cash game:\n*   One 9-handed cash game chart suggests opening J6s and better.\n*   A 6-max cash game chart indicates opening J5s and better.\n*   Another 6-max chart, which aims to be an \"implementable\" GTO strategy, recommends opening J4s and better.\n\nThe context of a \"rake-free\" game is crucial. The absence of rake incentivizes seeing more flops, which generally leads to wider pre-flop opening ranges compared to games with rake. The provided charts are mostly designed for raked games, where there is less incentive to play marginal hands.\n\nGiven that the most aggressive of the provided reputable charts for a standard (raked) 100bb game already includes J4s as a standard open from the button, it is highly probable that in a rake-free environment, the range would be at least this wide, if not wider. In a true GTO-solved, no-rake environment, it is very likely that even weaker suited jacks, such as J3s and J2s, would be opened with some frequency as part of a mixed strategy (i.e., not raising them 100% of the time).\n\nTherefore, the worst suited jack that you should still open from the button to 2.5x in a 100BB rake-free cash game, at least with some frequency, is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
