    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF, followed by the addition of methyl iodide, results in the formation of **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM). Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n\n**Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation**\n\nFirst, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide is treated with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF).\n\n*   **Directing Metalation Groups (DMGs):** The starting molecule has two functional groups that can direct the lithiation: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂). Both are known as directing metalation groups. The tertiary amide group is considered a strong DMG, while the tertiary amine is a moderate one.\n*   **Site of Lithiation:** The sec-butyllithium, a strong base, will deprotonate a carbon atom on the aromatic ring that is \"ortho\" (adjacent) to the strongest directing group. The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group at position C1 directs lithiation to either C2 or C6. The dimethylamino group at C3 directs to C2 or C4. The proton at the C2 position is activated by both directing groups, making it the most acidic proton on the ring. The combined effect of these two groups directs the lithiation specifically to the C2 position, which is ortho to the more powerful amide director.\n*   **Formation of the Aryllithium Intermediate:** The sec-BuLi removes a proton from the C2 position, and a lithium atom takes its place, forming a highly reactive aryllithium intermediate. The TMEDA acts as a chelating agent for the lithium ion, increasing the reactivity of the organolithium compound.\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**\n\nNext, methyl iodide (CH₃I) is added to the reaction mixture.\n\n*   **Nucleophilic Attack:** The aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile due to the carbanionic nature of the C2 carbon.\n*   **Substitution:** This nucleophilic carbon attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the iodide ion.\n\nThis results in the formation of the final product, where a methyl group is attached to the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\nThe overall transformation is the selective methylation of the aromatic ring at the position ortho to the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group and meta to the dimethylamino group, yielding N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
