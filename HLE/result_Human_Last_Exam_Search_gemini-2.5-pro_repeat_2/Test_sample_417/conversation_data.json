    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's structure and symmetry is required.\n\n### Molecular Structure and Symmetry Analysis:\n\n1.  **Central Core**: The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) ring. This core possesses a C3 rotational axis of symmetry.\n2.  **Substituents**: Three identical substituents are attached at the 1, 3, and 5 positions of the mesitylene ring. The substituents are chiral, with a specific stereochemistry of (4S,7R) derived from camphor.\n3.  **Equivalence**: Due to the C3 symmetry of the central ring and the identical nature of the three large substituents, all three of these substituent groups are chemically equivalent. This means that the signals from the protons of one substituent will be identical to the signals from the corresponding protons on the other two. Therefore, we only need to count the number of non-equivalent protons in the central core and in a single substituent group.\n\n### Analysis of Proton Signals:\n\nWe will count the number of unique proton environments, which will each correspond to a peak (or signal) in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**A. Central Mesitylene Core:**\n*   **Aromatic Protons**: There are no protons directly attached to the aromatic ring, as all positions (1 through 6) are substituted.\n*   **Mesityl Methyl Protons (-CH₃)**: The three methyl groups attached to the central ring (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's C3 symmetry. These 9 protons will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Peak Count = 1**\n\n**B. Linker Methylene Protons (-CH₂-):**\n*   The three methylene groups linking the central ring to the indazole units are equivalent by symmetry.\n*   Within a single -CH₂- group, the two protons are attached to a carbon that is adjacent to a chiral center (the entire camphor-derived indazole unit is chiral). Protons next to a chiral center are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They will have different chemical shifts and will likely appear as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet).\n    *   **Peak Count = 1 (mesityl-CH₃) + 2 (diastereotopic -CH₂-) = 3**\n\n**C. Camphor-Derived Indazole Moiety:**\nThe structure is formally named (4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole. This is a rigid bicyclic system derived from camphor. Let's analyze the non-equivalent protons in one unit:\n*   **Pyrazole Ring Proton (H-3)**: The indazole (a pyrazole fused to a ring) has one proton on the pyrazole ring at the C-3 position. This is a unique environment.\n    *   **Peak Count = 3 + 1 = 4**\n*   **Bridgehead Proton (H-4)**: This proton is at a bridgehead carbon (C-4) and is unique.\n    *   **Peak Count = 4 + 1 = 5**\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃)**: There are three methyl groups on the camphor skeleton: one at C-7 and two gem-dimethyls at C-8. Because they are in a rigid, asymmetric chiral environment, all three methyl groups are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   **C-7 Methyl**: This methyl group is unique.\n    *   **C-8 gem-Dimethyls**: The two methyl groups at C-8 are diastereotopic and therefore non-equivalent.\n    *   **Peak Count = 5 + 3 (for the three methyls) = 8**\n*   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂-) at C-5 and C-6**: There are two methylene groups at positions C-5 and C-6. In the rigid, asymmetric bicyclic system, all four of these protons (two at C-5, two at C-6) are in distinct chemical environments. They are all non-equivalent to each other.\n    *   H-5-exo and H-5-endo are diastereotopic.\n    *   H-6-exo and H-6-endo are diastereotopic.\n    *   The C-5 protons are not equivalent to the C-6 protons.\n    *   **Peak Count = 8 + 4 (for the four CH₂ protons) = 12**\n\n### Summary of Predicted Peaks:\n1.  **Mesityl -CH₃**: 1 peak\n2.  **Linker -CH₂-**: 2 peaks (diastereotopic)\n3.  **Indazole H-3**: 1 peak\n4.  **Indazole H-4**: 1 peak\n5.  **Indazole C-7 -CH₃**: 1 peak\n6.  **Indazole C-8 -CH₃ (syn)**: 1 peak\n7.  **Indazole C-8 -CH₃ (anti)**: 1 peak\n8.  **Indazole H-5 (exo)**: 1 peak\n9.  **Indazole H-5 (endo)**: 1 peak\n10. **Indazole H-6 (exo)**: 1 peak\n11. **Indazole H-6 (endo)**: 1 peak\n\nAdding these up gives a total of 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 12 unique proton signals.\n\nFinal count:\n*   1 (Mesityl-CH₃)\n*   2 (Linker-CH₂)\n*   1 (H-3)\n*   1 (H-4)\n*   3 (C-7/C-8 methyls)\n*   4 (C-5/C-6 methylenes)\n*   **Total = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 12**\n\n<<<H>>>"
