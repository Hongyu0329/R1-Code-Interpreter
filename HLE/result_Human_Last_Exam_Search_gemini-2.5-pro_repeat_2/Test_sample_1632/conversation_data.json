    "A self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice is a path on a square grid where each step is to an adjacent square, and no square is visited more than once. The term a(n) represents the number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks.\n\nThe number of these walks has been calculated for various values of n, and the sequence is cataloged as A001411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). While there is no simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n, the values for smaller n have been determined through computational enumeration.\n\nFor n=10, the value of a(10) is 44,100. The sequence of a(n) for n=1 to 10 is as follows:\n* a(1) = 4\n* a(2) = 12\n* a(3) = 36\n* a(4) = 100\n* a(5) = 284\n* a(6) = 780\n* a(7) = 2,172\n* a(8) = 5,916\n* a(9) = 16,268\n* a(10) = 44,100\n\n<<<44100>>>"
