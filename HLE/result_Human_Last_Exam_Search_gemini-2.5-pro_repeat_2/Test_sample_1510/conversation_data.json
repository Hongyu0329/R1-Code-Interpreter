    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nIn the classification of the 17 wallpaper groups, the point group of a wallpaper group refers to the set of its symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave a central point fixed. A point group of order 2 contains two operations: the identity operation and either a single 180-degree rotation or a single reflection.\n\nThe four wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n\n*   **p2**: The point group for p2 is C₂, which consists of the identity and a 180-degree rotation. This group has two-fold rotational symmetry but no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm**: The point group for pm is D₁, which contains the identity and a single reflection. The patterns in this group have reflection symmetry across parallel lines.\n*   **pg**: The point group for pg is also D₁. While the pattern itself contains glide reflections, the point group, which considers only symmetries at a point, consists of the identity and a reflection.\n*   **cm**: This group also has the point group D₁. It features reflections, and in this case, the lattice is centered.\n\nA table summarizing the wallpaper groups and their corresponding point groups confirms that p2, pm, pg, and cm all have a point group of order 2 (Z₂ in the summary provided in one of the search results). Other wallpaper groups have point groups of different orders, such as order 1 (p1), order 4 (e.g., pmm, p4), or higher.\n\n<<<4>>>"
