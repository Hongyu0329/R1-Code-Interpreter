    "When Glia maturation factor-gamma (GMFG) is broken down or reduced, it enhances the ability of macrophages to engulf amyloid-beta (Aβ). GMFG is an actin-disassembly protein that is highly expressed in immune cells.\n\nStudies have shown that knocking down GMFG in macrophages leads to a significant increase in the phagocytosis of Aβ42. Conversely, the overexpression of GMFG has been found to reduce the uptake of Aβ42 by these immune cells.\n\nThe mechanism behind this is that GMFG regulates the expression of scavenger receptor class A type I (SR-AI), a key cell-surface receptor involved in the clearance of Aβ. When GMFG is reduced, the expression of SR-AI on macrophages is increased, thereby boosting their capacity to bind and engulf amyloid-beta. This regulation occurs at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.\n\n<<<Glia maturation factor-gamma (GMFG)>>>"
