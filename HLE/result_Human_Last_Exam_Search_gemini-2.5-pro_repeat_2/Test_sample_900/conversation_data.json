    "It is not possible to provide a definitive number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo.\n\nThe term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized or defined step in the lexicon of ballet. It is an informal phrase, sometimes used on social media platforms, to describe movements that emulate the characteristic style of choreographer George Balanchine, which often includes a jazzy, off-balance, and quick dynamic. The School of American Ballet, founded by Balanchine, has noted that \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a term used in their classes.\n\nWilliam Forsythe's choreography for \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" is renowned for its deconstruction and evolution of classical ballet vocabulary. His style involves extending and accelerating traditional ballet figures, often pushing movements off-center and creating unexpected angles and transitions. While Forsythe's work is influenced by Balanchine, his choreographic language is uniquely his own.\n\nAnalyzing a complex, abstract, and stylistically unique piece of choreography like the Jete Woman solo for an informally named and undefined movement would require subjective interpretation rather than a factual count. A video of the specific 2015 performance with Svetlana Gileva is not publicly available, further preventing any such analysis. Therefore, without a standard definition for the step within the context of Forsythe's work, a numerical count cannot be accurately determined.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a definitive number.>>>"
