    "A functor is defined as being **n-resolvable** if its projective dimension is less than *n*. The question thus asks for the smallest integer *n* such that for any tame functor `f` from an upper semilattice `J` to the category of K-vector spaces `Vect_K`, the projective dimension of `f` is less than *n*.\n\nThe category of functors `Fun(J, Vect_K)` is an abelian category. The projective dimension of any functor `f` in this category is bounded by the global dimension of the category itself.\n\nA key result in the cohomology of small categories states that the global dimension of the functor category `Fun(C, A)` is related to the global dimension of the target category `A` and the cohomological dimension of the source category `C`. Specifically, for a poset `J` viewed as a category, the global dimension of `Fun(J, Vect_K)` is equal to the cohomological dimension of `J`, since the global dimension of `Vect_K` is 0.\n\nFor a poset `J` that is an upper semilattice (also known as a join-semilattice), it is a standard result in combinatorial topology and cohomology of categories that its nerve complex is homotopy equivalent to a 1-dimensional CW-complex (a graph). This implies that the cohomological dimension of `J` is at most 1.\n\nTherefore, the global dimension of the category `Fun(J, Vect_K)` is at most 1. This means that every functor `f: J -> Vect_K`, including every tame functor, has a projective dimension of at most 1.\n\nAccording to the definition of n-resolvability, we have:\n`projective dimension(f) < n`\n\nSince `projective dimension(f) <= 1`, we must have `1 < n`. The smallest integer `n` that satisfies this condition is 2.\n\nThus, any tame functor `f: J -> Vect_K` is 2-resolvable.\n\n<<<2>>>"
