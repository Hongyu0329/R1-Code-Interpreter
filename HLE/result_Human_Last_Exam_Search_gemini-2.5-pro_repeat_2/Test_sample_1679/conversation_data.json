    "An analysis of Academy Award for Best Picture winners reveals that the 1951 film *An American in Paris* was the first to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The film features a lengthy and celebrated 17-minute ballet sequence that is partially set in a stylized representation of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, the location of one of the two Luxor Obelisks.\n\nThe Luxor Obelisks are a pair of ancient Egyptian obelisks, with one remaining in Luxor, Egypt, at the Luxor Temple, and the other located in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. The Paris obelisk has been a prominent landmark since it was erected in 1836.\n\nWhile earlier Best Picture winners were set in Paris, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), there is no evidence that they featured scenes at this specific landmark. Later Paris-set winners, like *Gigi* (1958), include scenes near fountains in the city, but the presence of the obelisk is not confirmed and has been disputed in online discussions.\n\nThe elaborate ballet in *An American in Paris* uses a set modeled on the Place de la Concorde's fountain as a central element for a dance between Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. Production documents show a model of the fountain was created for planning the choreography and cinematography, confirming the intent to represent this iconic location.\n\nOther films that might have been candidates, such as 1956's *Around the World in 80 Days*, which included scenes in France and Egypt, used studio sets for many of their international locations and do not contain depictions of either obelisk. Similarly, the 1970 winner *Patton*, which featured scenes set in North Africa, was filmed primarily in Spain and Morocco, with no indication of filming at the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
