    "A finite group G is called a filled group if all of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets fill G. The finite filled nilpotent groups are the elementary abelian 2-groups, the cyclic groups of order 3 and 5, and two specific non-abelian 2-groups.\n\nA subset S of a group G is considered product-free if for any two elements a and b in S (not necessarily distinct), their product ab is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not properly contained within any other product-free set in G. A group G is a \"filled group\" if every locally maximal product-free set S in G \"fills\" G, meaning that every non-identity element of G is contained in the union of S and its product set SS = {ab | a, b ∈ S}.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups can be broken down into abelian and non-abelian cases. A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n\n**Abelian Filled Nilpotent Groups:**\nA finite abelian group is filled if and only if it is one of the following:\n*   An elementary abelian 2-group (a group isomorphic to a direct product of copies of the cyclic group of order 2, C₂).\n*   The cyclic group of order 3, C₃.\n*   The cyclic group of order 5, C₅.\n\nSince all abelian groups are nilpotent, these are all examples of finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n**Non-Abelian Filled Nilpotent Groups:**\nThe classification of filled nilpotent groups reveals that there are only two such groups that are not abelian. Both of these are 2-groups (groups where every element has an order that is a power of 2).\n\nThe complete list of finite filled nilpotent groups is therefore:\n*   An elementary abelian 2-group, (C₂)ⁿ for any n ≥ 1.\n*   The cyclic group of order 3, C₃.\n*   The cyclic group of order 5, C₅.\n*   The quaternion group of order 8, Q₈.\n*   A specific non-abelian 2-group of order 16, identified as SmallGroup(16,3) in the GAP software library, which is a central product of the dihedral group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 4.\n\nThe paper \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\" by C.S. Anabanti, S.B. Hart, and F. Tota provides the definitive classification. It shows that any filled nilpotent group that is not a 2-group must be C₃ or C₅. The remainder of the classification relies on identifying the filled 2-groups.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group is a filled group if and only if it is an elementary abelian 2-group, the cyclic group of order 3, the cyclic group of order 5, the quaternion group of order 8, or the group SmallGroup(16,3).>>>"
