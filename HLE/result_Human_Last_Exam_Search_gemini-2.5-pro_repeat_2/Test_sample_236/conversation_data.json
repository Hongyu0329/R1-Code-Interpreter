    "My initial thought that integral surgery on the unknot produces infinitely many homology cobordism classes was correct. The \"homology cobordism group\" is often discussed in the context of homology 3-spheres, which are 3-manifolds with the same integral homology as the 3-sphere S³. However, the broader definition includes manifolds that are not homology spheres. Two 3-manifolds are homology cobordant if they form the boundary of a 4-manifold that has the same homology as a cylinder. Manifolds with non-isomorphic first homology groups cannot be homology cobordant.\n\nLet's analyze the knots with at most four crossings:\n\n*   **0-crossing knot (the unknot, 0₁):**\n    *   Integral surgery on the unknot with coefficient *p* (where *p* is an integer) results in the lens space L(p, 1).\n    *   The first homology group of the resulting manifold, H₁(L(p, 1)), is the cyclic group Z/|p|Z.\n    *   If *p* = 0, the surgery yields S¹ x S², whose first homology group is Z.\n    *   If |*p*| = 1, the surgery yields the 3-sphere S³, which is the identity element of the group and has trivial homology.\n    *   For any other integer *p*, the resulting manifold has H₁ = Z/|p|Z.\n    *   Since manifolds must have isomorphic first homology groups to be in the same homology cobordism class, each distinct value of |*p*| (for |*p*| ≥ 2) gives a different first homology group (Z₂, Z₃, Z₄, ...).\n    *   Therefore, surgeries on the unknot alone produce an infinite number of distinct homology cobordism elements.\n\n*   **3-crossing knot (the trefoil, 3₁):**\n    *   The trefoil knot is a torus knot T(2,3).\n    *   Integral surgeries on the trefoil can produce various 3-manifolds, including the Poincaré homology sphere.\n    *   For example, +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil results in the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7), which is a homology sphere with a non-trivial Rokhlin invariant, meaning it's a non-trivial element in the homology cobordism group of homology spheres. This is distinct from the identity element (S³).\n\n*   **4-crossing knot (the figure-eight, 4₁):**\n    *   Surgery on the figure-eight knot also produces a variety of 3-manifolds. For instance, +1 surgery on the figure-eight knot yields a manifold with a Rokhlin invariant of 0 mod 8.\n    *   The 0-surgery on the figure-eight knot results in a torus bundle with Sol geometry, while the 0-surgery on the trefoil has a different geometric structure, making them distinct manifolds.\n\nSince integral surgery on the unknot by itself generates an infinite number of non-homology-cobordant 3-manifolds (the lens spaces L(p,1) for |p| = 0, 2, 3, 4, ...), the total number of representable elements is infinite.\n\n<<<infinitely many>>>"
