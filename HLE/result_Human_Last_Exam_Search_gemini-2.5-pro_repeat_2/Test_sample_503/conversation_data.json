    "An internal adjunction in the 2-category $\\Delta$ from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps (1-morphisms) $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$, along with two 2-morphisms, the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\to g \\circ f$ and the counit $\\varepsilon: f \\circ g \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$.\n\nIn the specific context of $\\Delta$ viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, the existence of a 2-morphism from a map $h_1$ to a map $h_2$ is equivalent to the pointwise inequality $h_1(x) \\le h_2(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain. Therefore, the unit and counit conditions translate to:\n1.  $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le g \\circ f$, which means $i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n2.  $\\varepsilon: f \\circ g \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$, which means $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\nThese are the standard conditions for an adjunction between posets, where $f$ is the left adjoint of $g$ ($f \\dashv g$). In a posetal setting, the adjunction data $(f,g,\\eta,\\varepsilon)$ is uniquely determined by the map $f$ or the map $g$. The number of adjunctions is therefore the number of maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ that have a right adjoint, which is also equal to the number of maps $g: [n] \\to [m]$ that have a left adjoint.\n\nA map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ has a right adjoint $g$ if and only if for every $j \\in [n]$, the set $\\{i \\in [m] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$ has a maximum element. Since $[m]$ is a finite totally ordered set, this condition is equivalent to the set being non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$. For this to hold, for any $j \\in [n]$, there must be some $i \\in [m]$ such that $f(i) \\le j$. Since $f$ is order-preserving, the minimum value of its image is $f(0)$. The condition is thus met if and only if $f(0)$ is less than or equal to all possible values of $j$, which means we must have $f(0)=0$.\n\nSimilarly, a map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ has a left adjoint if and only if for every $i \\in [m]$, the set $\\{j \\in [n] \\mid g(j) \\ge i\\}$ has a minimum element. This is equivalent to the set being non-empty for all $i \\in [m]$. Since $g$ is order-preserving, its maximum value is $g(n)$. The condition is met if and only if $g(n)$ is greater than or equal to all possible values of $i$, which means we must have $g(n)=m$.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map $f: \\to$ is defined by a sequence of values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ such that $0 \\le f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\nThe condition $f(0)=0$ fixes the first value. We need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ of length 23, with values taken from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem of choosing $k$ items from a set of size $N$ with repetition allowed. The formula is the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{N \\choose k}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\nIn our case:\n*   $k=23$ is the number of values to choose (for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$).\n*   The values are chosen from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, so there are $N = 38$ possible values.\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, we could count the number of order-preserving maps $g: \\to$ such that $g(37)=23$. This requires choosing the values $g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(36)$, which is a non-decreasing sequence of 37 values from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$ (a set of size 24).\n*   $k=37$\n*   $N=24$\nThe number is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nSince $\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$ and $\\binom{60}{37} = \\frac{60!}{37!23!}$, the two calculations agree, confirming the result.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nCalculating the exact value:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60 \\times 59 \\times \\dots \\times 38}{23 \\times 22 \\times \\dots \\times 1}$\nThis is a very large number.\n$\\binom{60}{23} = 444,521,428,231,614,350$\n\n<<<444521428231614350>>>"
