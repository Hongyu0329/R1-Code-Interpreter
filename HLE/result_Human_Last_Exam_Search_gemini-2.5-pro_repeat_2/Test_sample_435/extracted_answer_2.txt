Based on the evidence, the prediction is that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit a modulated cytokine release profile, characterized by enhanced production of key anti-tumor effector cytokines like IFN-Î³, while potentially showing a reduced or more controlled release of cytokines associated with severe toxicities such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), when compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This would likely contribute to a more potent and persistent anti-tumor response with an improved safety profile.
