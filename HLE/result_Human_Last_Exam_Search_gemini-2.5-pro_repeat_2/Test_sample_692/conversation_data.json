    "### Oldest Written Date in the Americas Emerges from Olmec Civilization\n\nThe earliest known date recorded in an aboriginal writing system in the pre-Columbian Americas is believed to be from the Olmec civilization, dating to approximately 650 BCE. The evidence comes from a ceramic cylinder seal discovered at the San Andrés archaeological site in Tabasco, Mexico.\n\nThe seal contains incised glyphs that have been interpreted by archaeologists as representing the date \"3 Ajaw,\" a day in the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar. In many Mesoamerican cultures, individuals were often named after the day of their birth, suggesting this could be the name of a ruler or an important individual. While this finding points to the Olmec as being the first civilization in the Western Hemisphere to use a writing system to record dates, some scholars have expressed caution, suggesting the symbols could be iconographic elements rather than a definitive date.\n\nAnother significant early recorded date, and the earliest that is unequivocally confirmed, comes from the Maya. At the site of San Bartolo in Guatemala, archaeologists found painted mural fragments securely dated to between 300 and 200 BCE. These fragments clearly depict the date \"7 Deer,\" another day in the 260-day calendar, and are considered the most definitive evidence of an early recorded date in a Mesoamerican writing system.\n\nLater, more complex date recordings appeared with the Long Count calendar. The earliest known example of a Long Count date is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico, which records a date corresponding to 36 BCE. Another early Long Count inscription is on Stela C from Tres Zapotes, an Olmec-region site, which displays a date of 32 BCE.\n\nWhile architectural alignments at Olmec and Maya sites suggest the *use* of the 260-day calendar may go back as far as 1100 BCE, the San Andrés cylinder seal remains the earliest known artifact with a potential *written* date. The discovery of even earlier writing on the Cascajal Block, also from the Olmec region and dated to around 900 BCE, provides context for the development of this recording system, though the block itself does not contain a calendrical date.\n\n<<<The \"3 Ajaw\" glyph on the San Andrés cylinder seal, dating to approximately 650 BCE.>>>"
