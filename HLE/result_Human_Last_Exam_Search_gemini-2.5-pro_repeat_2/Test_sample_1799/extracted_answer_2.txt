It is not strictly true that the second postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the first alone. While it is possible to derive the core principles of special relativity without the second postulate, these derivations require the introduction of other assumptions, such as the universality of Maxwell's equations or the homogeneity and isotropy of space, and ultimately appeal to experimental evidence to fix a resulting undetermined constant. Therefore, the constancy of the speed of light remains a crucial element, whether it is introduced as a postulate or as an experimental fact to complete the theory.
