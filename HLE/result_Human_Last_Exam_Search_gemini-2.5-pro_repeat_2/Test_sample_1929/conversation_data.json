    "The reaction between butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a classic example of a Diels-Alder reaction. This type of reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, where a conjugated diene (butadiene) reacts with a dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) to form a six-membered ring.\n\nThe product of this specific reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the product is formed:\n*   **Reactants**: 1,3-butadiene (CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂) acts as the 4π-electron component. 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂) serves as the 2π-electron component, also known as the dienophile.\n*   **Mechanism**: The reaction proceeds in a single, concerted step. The two double bonds of the butadiene and the one double bond of the dichloro-difluoroethene rearrange to form a new cyclohexene ring.\n*   **Structure**: A new six-membered ring is created. A double bond is formed between the central two carbons of the original butadiene molecule. The two terminal carbons of the butadiene form new single bonds with the two carbons from the dichloro-difluoroethene. The chlorine and fluorine atoms remain attached to their original carbon atoms, which are now part of the saturated portion of the newly formed ring.\n\nThis cycloaddition is a well-documented process in organic chemistry for creating fluorinated and chlorinated cyclic compounds.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
