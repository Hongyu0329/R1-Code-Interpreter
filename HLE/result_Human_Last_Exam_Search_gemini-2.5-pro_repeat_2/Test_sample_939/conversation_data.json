    "The core of this question lies in the concept of color gamuts. A color gamut is the range of colors that a particular color space can represent. ROMM RGB, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a very wide color gamut designed to encompass the full range of colors found in photographs. In contrast, sRGB is a smaller color space that is the standard for the web and most consumer devices.\n\nBecause ROMM RGB has a larger gamut, it can represent highly saturated colors that are outside the range of sRGB. This is most apparent at the primary colors (the purest reds, greens, and blues) that define the boundaries of a color space.\n\nHere is an analysis of the given ROMM RGB values:\n\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary of ROMM RGB. This primary color is defined to be a much more saturated blue than sRGB's blue primary. As a result, it falls outside the sRGB gamut and cannot be accurately represented. In fact, this blue is an \"imaginary\" color, meaning it's a mathematically defined color that cannot actually be seen by the human eye, a known characteristic of the very large ProPhoto/ROMM RGB space.\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary of ROMM RGB. Similar to the blue primary, the ROMM RGB green is far more saturated than what sRGB can display. This color is outside the sRGB gamut and therefore cannot be represented.\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated cyan color. Since it is not a pure, fully saturated primary, it is less extreme and falls within the boundaries of what both color spaces can represent.\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a muted, dark grayish-cyan. As a desaturated color, it is well within the sRGB gamut.\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. While the technical definitions of the white point differ between the two spaces (D50 for ROMM RGB and D65 for sRGB), white is a color that can be represented in both. A color management system would map the white from one space to the other.\n\nTherefore, the pure blue and pure green primaries of ROMM RGB are not representable within the smaller sRGB color space.\n\n<<<1, 2>>>"
