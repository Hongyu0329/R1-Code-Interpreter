    "The battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler that occurred latest historically is the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir.\n\nLady Butler, a renowned British painter of military scenes, depicted several significant 19th-century conflicts. To determine the latest battle she painted, a chronological review of the historical events in her artwork is necessary.\n\nThe battles and military events portrayed in her notable paintings include:\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army***: This painting depicts Assistant Surgeon William Brydon's arrival at Jalalabad on January 13, 1842, after the disastrous retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** and ***Scotland Forever!***: These works portray scenes from the Napoleonic Wars. \"The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras\" is set during the Battle of Quatre Bras on June 16, 1815. \"Scotland Forever!\" captures the charge of the Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** and ***Balaclava***: These paintings are from the Crimean War. \"The Roll Call\" is often associated with the Battle of Inkerman (November 5, 1854), and \"Balaclava\" depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Balaclava (October 25, 1854).\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift***: This work illustrates the defence of the mission station at Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War, which took place on January 22-23, 1879.\n*   ***After the Battle: Arrival of Lord Wolseley and Staff at the Bridge of Tel-el-Kebir***: This painting shows a scene from the Anglo-Egyptian War, specifically the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir on September 13, 1882.\n\nA search also revealed a painting titled *\"Floreat Etona!\"* from 1882, depicting an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War, which occurred on January 28, 1881. Another work, *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*, depicts an event from World War I in 1917, but the query focuses on battles depicted, and \"After the Battle... at Tel-el-Kebir\" from 1885 portrays an earlier conflict.\n\nComparing the dates of these historical events, the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir in 1882 is the latest among the specified conflicts depicted in Lady Butler's well-known battle paintings.\n\n<<<The Battle of Tel-el-Kebir>>>"
