    "This sequence is composed of numbers that are all divisible by 6. The pattern is not a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. To determine the next number, we must analyze the differences between the consecutive terms.\n\nThe given sequence is:\n1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are:\n6, 12, 18, 54, 120, 6, 60, 120, 30, 12, 30, 18, 12, 48, 24, 18, 132, 78, 78, 12, 30, 42, 30, 36, 24, 6, 60, 12, 132, 66, 12\n\nSince all numbers in the sequence are divisible by 6, the differences are also all divisible by 6. Let's divide the differences by 6 to see if a simpler pattern emerges:\n1, 2, 3, 9, 20, 1, 10, 20, 5, 2, 5, 3, 2, 8, 4, 3, 22, 13, 13, 2, 5, 7, 5, 6, 4, 1, 10, 2, 22, 11, 2\n\nThis sequence of scaled differences does not immediately present a simple arithmetic pattern. However, a more complex recurring pattern can be observed. There is a repeating structure of the form (x, y, y/2, z).\n\nThe two instances of this pattern in the sequence of scaled differences are:\n*   Starting at the 13th term: **2, 8, 4, 3** (Here, x=2, y=8, z=3)\n*   Starting at the 28th term: **2, 22, 11, 2** (Here, x=2, y=22, z=2)\n\nThe last term in the sequence of scaled differences is 2, which completes the second occurrence of this pattern. It is plausible that the sequence continues with another instance of this pattern. In both observed cases, the pattern started with the number 2.\n\nAssuming the pattern repeats, the next term in the sequence of scaled differences would be 2. To find the actual difference, we multiply this by 6, which gives 12.\n\nThe last number in the original sequence is 2352. Adding the predicted difference of 12 gives the next number:\n2352 + 12 = 2364.\n\nThe number 2364 is divisible by 6 (since the sum of its digits, 15, is divisible by 3, and it is an even number), which is consistent with the properties of the given sequence.\n\n<<<2364>>>"
