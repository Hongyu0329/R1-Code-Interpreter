    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone depends on the base utilized in the reaction. When a hydroxide base is used, the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. If an alkoxide, such as sodium ethoxide, is employed, the corresponding ester, ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, is formed. This occurs via a ring contraction mechanism.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity is a metric that quantifies the complexity of a molecule based on information theory, considering factors such as stereochemistry, heteroatoms, and symmetry. The complexity is calculated for each atom and then summed to give a total value for the molecule.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity for the two possible products are as follows:\n\n*   For **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** (SMILES: OC(=O)C1CCCC1), the calculated Böttcher Molecular Complexity is **27.9 mcbit**.\n*   For **ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate** (SMILES: CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1), the calculated Böttcher Molecular Complexity is **35.9 mcbit**.\n\nThese values were calculated using a Böttcher score calculator.\n\n<<<27.9 mcbit for cyclopentanecarboxylic acid and 35.9 mcbit for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate>>>"
