    "In the context of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat can be determined using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. This method calculates critical exponents as a power series in ϵ = d_c - d, where d_c is the upper critical dimension and d is the spatial dimension of the system.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** For a large class of systems, including those described by the O(n) model (which contains the Ising model as the n=1 case), the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. Above this dimension, the critical exponents take on their mean-field theory values.\n*   **Epsilon (ϵ):** The epsilon expansion is a perturbative approach that uses ϵ = d_c - d as a small parameter. For a system with spatial dimension d=3, ϵ is:\n    ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1\n\n### Epsilon Expansion for the Specific Heat Exponent α\n\nThe critical exponent α can be expressed as a series in ϵ. For the general O(n) model, the one-loop (first-order) calculation yields the following formula for α:\n\nα = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ²)\n\nWhile the prompt does not specify the symmetry of the system (the value of *n*), the most common case studied is the Ising model, which corresponds to n=1.\n\nSubstituting n=1 into the formula gives:\n\nα = (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) * ϵ = 3 / 18 * ϵ = ϵ / 6\n\n### Calculation for d=3\n\nTo find the first-order approximation for α in a 3-dimensional system, we set ϵ=1:\n\nα ≈ 1/6 ≈ 0.167\n\nThis first-order expansion provides a reasonable estimate. For comparison, higher-order calculations and numerical simulations for the 3D Ising model yield a value of α ≈ 0.110. It is important to remember that the ϵ-expansion is an approximation, and setting ϵ=1 pushes the limits of its perturbative nature.\n\nThe result is derived from the hyperscaling relation α = 2 - νd, combined with the ϵ-expansion for the correlation length exponent ν, which is ν = 1/2 + (n+2)/(4(n+8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ²). For n=1, this gives ν ≈ 1/2 + 3/36 * ϵ = 1/2 + ϵ/12. Using α = 2 - dν = 2 - (4-ϵ)(1/2 + ϵ/12) and keeping terms to first order in ϵ gives α = ϵ/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
