    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The product of this reaction is determined by the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n\nFor an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (in this case, bromine) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an anti-periplanar arrangement. This specific geometry requires both the leaving group and the β-hydrogen to be in axial positions on the chair conformation of the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. In its more stable chair conformation, this molecule positions the bromine atom in an axial position and the methyl group in an equatorial position. This conformation is ideal for an E2 reaction because the leaving group (Br) is already in the required axial position.\n\nNext, we must identify the available β-hydrogens that are also in an axial position:\n*   **On carbon 2:** The methyl group is equatorial, which means the hydrogen on carbon 2 is in an axial position. However, this axial hydrogen is on the same side of the ring as the axial bromine (syn-periplanar), not on the opposite side. Therefore, elimination cannot occur towards carbon 2.\n*   **On carbon 6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one of which is in an axial position and is on the opposite side of the ring (anti-periplanar) to the axial bromine.\n\nBecause only the axial hydrogen on carbon 6 can be removed, the double bond will form between carbon 1 and carbon 6. The methyl group on carbon 2 is not involved in the reaction.\n\nThis outcome demonstrates that the stereochemical requirement for a trans-diaxial arrangement is the dominant factor in determining the product, overriding Zaitsev's rule, which would have predicted the more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene). The reaction is regioselective due to the specific stereoisomer used.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
