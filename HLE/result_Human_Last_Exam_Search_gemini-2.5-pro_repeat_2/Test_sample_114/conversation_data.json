    "Based on an analysis of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess,\" the word he does not make a rhyme with from the list is \"Hool.\"\n\nHere is a breakdown of the rhymes found for the other words in the poem:\n\n*   **Wente:** This word is rhymed with \"wente\" (went) and other similar-sounding words throughout the text. For instance, the dreamer states, \"Took my hors, and forth I wente / Out of my chambre\" which is part of a rhyming couplet.\n*   **Here:** The word \"here\" (hear or here) is frequently rhymed. For example, Alcyone weeps \"that pite was to here\" which is rhymed with \"'A! mercy! swete lady dere!'\".\n*   **Fool:** While the word \"fool\" itself may not appear in a rhyming position, the concept and related terms are central to discussions of Chaucer's work, including \"The Miller's Tale\". In the context of \"The Book of the Duchess,\" the dreamer's seemingly foolish questions allow the Black Knight to tell his story. The structure of the poem relies on this dynamic.\n*   **Countour:** Chaucer explicitly creates a rhyme with \"countour\" (a device for counting) in the lines: \"That thogh Argus, the noble countour, / Sete to rekene in his countour\".\n\nThere is no evidence within the text of \"Book of the Duchess\" that the word \"Hool\" (whole) is used in a rhyming context.\n\n<<<D>>>"
