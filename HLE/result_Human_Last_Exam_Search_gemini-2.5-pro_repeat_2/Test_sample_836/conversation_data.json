    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community and related fields. It is typically denoted as S(k, ω).\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function provides information about the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that another particle was at the origin at time t=0. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space and time yields the dynamic structure factor, which is a crucial quantity in the analysis of inelastic scattering experiments. This relationship is fundamental because the dynamic structure factor is directly proportional to the double differential scattering cross-section, which is the quantity measured in experiments involving thermal neutrons. The variables **k** (wave vector) and **ω** (frequency) in S(k, ω) correspond to the momentum and energy transfer during the scattering event.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
