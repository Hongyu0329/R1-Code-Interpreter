    "To find the number that should be filled in the parentheses in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, we need to identify the underlying pattern.\n\nLet's examine the relationship between consecutive terms:\n*   From 2 to 11: 11 = 2 × 5 + 1\n*   From 11 to 23: 23 = 11 × 2 + 1\n*   From 23 to 51: 51 = 23 × 2 + 5\n*   From 51 to 119: 119 = 51 × 2 + 17\n\nThis does not reveal a simple, consistent rule. Let's try another approach by observing the differences between the numbers.\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68. This also does not show an obvious arithmetic or geometric progression.\n\nLet's re-examine a multiplicative pattern, but in a different way. A common pattern in such sequences is of the form: `Next Term = (Previous Term × Constant) ± Another Number`.\n\nLet's test the pattern `Next Term = (Previous Term × 2) + a changing number`.\n*   2 × 2 + 7 = 11\n*   11 × 2 + 1 = 23\n*   23 × 2 + 5 = 51\n*   51 × 2 + 17 = 119\nThis still leaves us with the sequence 7, 1, 5, 17 to decipher.\n\nLet's try a different pattern: `Next Term = (Previous Term × 3) - a changing number`.\n*   2 × 3 - (-5) = 11\n*   11 × 3 - 10 = 23\n*   23 × 3 - 18 = 51\n*   51 × 3 - 34 = 119\nThe numbers being subtracted are -5, 10, 18, 34. This also doesn't present a clear pattern.\n\nLet's reconsider the differences (9, 12, 28, 68) and see if there is a more complex relationship.\nA possible, though less common, pattern is `a(n) = a(n-2) + a(n-1) + C`.\n*   2 + 11 = 13; 23 is not 13.\n\nLet's try one more common pattern type: `Next Term = a(n-1) * k + c` where k and c might change. A frequent pattern found in these types of problems is related to doubling the previous term and adding or subtracting a value.\n\nLet's try to work backwards from the options provided.\nIf the answer is 291 (Option A), the last difference would be 291 - 119 = 172. The difference sequence would be 9, 12, 28, 68, 172.\nIf the answer is 285 (Option B), the last difference would be 285 - 119 = 166. The difference sequence would be 9, 12, 28, 68, 166.\nIf the answer is 171 (Option C), the last difference would be 171 - 119 = 52.\nIf the answer is 167 (Option D), the last difference would be 167 - 119 = 48.\n\nLet's analyze the difference sequence 9, 12, 28, 68, 166.\n*   12 - 9 = 3\n*   28 - 12 = 16\n*   68 - 28 = 40\n*   166 - 68 = 98\nThe second differences are 3, 16, 40, 98. This does not appear to follow a simple rule.\n\nLet's try a different pattern which is `x*2 + a, x*2+b`.\nA similar sequence found online is 2, 9, 23, 51, 107. The pattern for that sequence is:\n*   2 * 2 + 5 = 9\n*   9 * 2 + 5 = 23\n*   23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n*   51 * 2 + 5 = 107\nThis suggests our sequence may have a similar structure.\n\nLet's look at the sequence again: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\nThe pattern appears to be `Next Term = Previous Term * 2.5 - 1.5`, which doesn't hold.\n\nLet's try a variation of the `*2` pattern again.\n*   2 * 2 + 7 = 11\n*   11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n*   23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n*   51 * 2 + 17 = 119\n\nLet's try another pattern based on multiplication and subtraction.\n*   `2 * 6 - 1 = 11`\n*   `11 * 2 + 1 = 23`\n*   `23 * 2 + 5 = 51`\n*   `51 * 2 + 17 = 119`\n\nLet's re-examine the differences: 9, 12, 28, 68. Let's see how they are constructed.\n*   9\n*   12\n*   28 = 9*3+1? No. 12*2+4? Yes.\n*   68 = 28*2+12? Yes.\n*   Next difference = 68*2 + 28 = 136 + 28 = 164.\n*   Next term = 119 + 164 = 283. This is close to 285.\n\nLet's try another logic on the differences 9, 12, 28, 68.\nThe pattern could be `3*previous diff + 3`.\n*   9\n*   12 (not from 9)\nHow about `previous diff + n^3`\n*   9 + 1^3 = 10 (no)\n*   9 + 3 = 12\n*   12 + 16 = 28\n*   28 + 40 = 68\nThe additions are 3, 16, 40.\n\nThere might be a simpler pattern. Let's look at the numbers relative to a baseline.\nLet's try `2*x+y` again.\nThe pattern is `x(n) = 2*x(n-1) + a(n)`.\nLet's analyze the addends `a(n)`: 7, 1, 5, 17. No simple pattern.\n\nLet's look at the pattern `y = 2x+3` then `y=2x+1` repeating.\n2*2+7=11\n11*2+1=23\n23*2+7=53 (close to 51)\n51*2+1=103 (not 119)\n\nLet's try `x*a+b`, `x*c+d`.\n*   2 * 5 + 1 = 11\n*   11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n*   23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n*   51 * 2 + 17 = 119\nThe multipliers are 5, 2, 2, 2. So after the first term, the multiplier is 2. The added numbers are 1, 1, 5, 17. Still no obvious pattern.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and the first number is 5.\nSequence: 5, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n*   5 * 2 + 1 = 11\n*   11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n*   23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n*   51 * 2 + 17 = 119\n\nLet's go back to the original sequence and options.\n2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nA. 291 B. 285 C. 171 D. 167\nLet's test option B: 285.\nSequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, 285\nDifferences: 9, 12, 28, 68, 166\nSecond differences: 3, 16, 40, 98\nThird differences: 13, 24, 58\nFourth differences: 11, 34\nThis does not reveal a simple polynomial pattern.\n\nLet's rethink the pattern `a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + a(n-2) - a(n-3) ...`\nLet's try `x_n = 3*x_{n-1} - x_{n-2}`\n`3*11 - 2 = 31` (not 23)\n\nLet's try a different pattern.\n`a_n = a_{n-1} + 2^k`\n11 = 2 + 9 (not a power of 2)\n\nLet's try another simple pattern: `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + c_n`\n11 = 2*2 + 7\n23 = 2*11 + 1\n51 = 2*23 + 5\n119 = 2*51 + 17\nNext term `X = 2*119 + c = 238 + c`.\nWe need to find the next term `c` in the sequence `7, 1, 5, 17`. The differences are -6, 4, 12. The second differences are 10, 8. The next second difference would be 6. So the next first difference is 12+6=18. The next term `c` is 17+18 = 35. Then `X = 238 + 35 = 273`. This is not among the options.\n\nLet's assume the pattern is `Next number = 2 × previous number + (previous of previous number - k)`.\n*   23 = 2 × 11 + (2 - 1) -> No.\n*   51 = 2 × 23 + (11-6) -> No.\n\nLet's try a combination of the previous two terms.\n*   `2*11 + 2 = 24` (close to 23)\n*   `2*23 + 11 = 57` (close to 51)\n*   `2*51 + 23 = 125` (close to 119)\nThe pattern is `x_n = 2*x_{n-1} + x_{n-2} - c`.\n*   23 = 2*11 + 2 - 1\n*   51 = 2*23 + 11 - 6\n*   119 = 2*51 + 23 - 6\nThe number subtracted is 1, 6, 6. No clear pattern.\n\nLet's try a simpler version: `x_n = 2*x_{n-1} + x_{n-2}`\n*   `2*11 + 2 = 24` (actual is 23)\n*   `2*23 + 11 = 57` (actual is 51)\n*   `2*51 + 23 = 125` (actual is 119)\nThe difference is -1, -6, -6.\n\nThe pattern is likely simpler and I'm overthinking it.\nLet's try the difference approach one last time.\nDifferences: 9, 12, 28, 68\nRatio of differences: 12/9 = 1.33, 28/12 = 2.33, 68/28 = 2.42\nIt seems to approach a multiplier of 2.5.\n\nLet's reconsider the pattern `a(n) = 2.5 * a(n-1) - c`.\n*   11 = 2.5 * 2 + 6\n*   23 = 2.5 * 11 - 4.5\nNo.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the problem and the sequence is 2, 5, 11, 23, 47. The pattern is `x*2+1`, `x*2-1`... No, the pattern is `x_n = x_{n-1}*2+1`. But this yields 2, 5, 11, 23, 47.\nAnother similar sequence: 2, 9, 23, 51, 107, ? The answer is 219. The logic is `*2+5`, `*2+5`... No, that's not right either.\n\nLet's go with the most plausible complex pattern found earlier.\nDifferences: 9, 12, 28, 68.\nSecond differences: 3, 16, 40.\nLet's try to find a pattern in the second differences.\n3 * 5 + 1 = 16\n16 * 2.5 = 40.\nLet's assume the next multiplier is 2. `40 * 2 = 80`.\nNext second difference = 80.\nNext first difference = 68 + 80 = 148.\nNext term = 119 + 148 = 267. Not in options.\n\nLet's try a different analysis of the second differences 3, 16, 40.\nThese are not standard number sequences.\n\nLet's assume the pattern `Next = 2 * Previous + c` and find a pattern in `c`: 7, 1, 5, 17.\nIf we assume the next number is 285, then `285 = 2*119 + c`, so `c = 285 - 238 = 47`.\nThe sequence of `c` would be 7, 1, 5, 17, 47.\nDifferences of c: -6, 4, 12, 30.\nSecond differences of c: 10, 8, 18.\nThis does not seem right.\n\nWhat if the pattern for the differences 9, 12, 28, 68 is `3 * previous + 3` starting from the second term? `3*9+3 = 30` (not 12).\n\nAfter re-evaluating, the most likely intended pattern, common in these puzzles, is a slight variation on a simple rule.\nLet's try the pattern `y = 3x - c` again.\n11 = 3*2 + 5\n23 = 3*11 - 10\n51 = 3*23 - 18\n119 = 3*51 - 34\nThe subtracted numbers are -5, 10, 18, 34.\nThe differences are 15, 8, 16. No obvious pattern.\n\nLet's go back to the most promising pattern: `x_n = 2x_{n-1} + x_{n-2} - c`.\n`x_3=23 = 2*11 + 2 - 1 = 24 - 1`\n`x_4=51 = 2*23 + 11 - 6 = 57 - 6`\n`x_5=119 = 2*51 + 23 - 6 = 125 - 6`\nIf the `-6` repeats, the next term is:\n`x_6 = 2*119 + 51 - 6 = 238 + 51 - 6 = 289 - 6 = 283`. This is very close to 285.\nPerhaps the pattern is `x_n = 2*x_{n-1} + x_{n-2} - 4`.\n`23 = 2*11+2-1 = 23`.\n`51 = 2*23+11-4 = 53`. No.\n\nLet's assume the pattern is `x(n) = 3*x(n-1) - x(n-2) + C`\n`23 = 3*11 - 2 = 31`. No.\n\nLet's try the most simple and common type of pattern again.\n`a_n = 2*a_{n-1} + k`\n*   11 = 2*2 + 7\n*   23 = 2*11 + 1\n*   51 = 2*23 + 5\n*   119 = 2*51 + 17\nNext term is `2*119 + k = 238 + k`.\nThe sequence of k is 7, 1, 5, 17. The difference is -6, 4, 12. The next difference might be 20 (increasing by 8). Then k would be 17+20 = 37. Next term = 238 + 37 = 275. Not an option.\n\nThe pattern is most likely `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + x_{n-2} - C` which gave 283, very close to 285. It's possible there is a slight modification to this rule or a typo in the question or options. However, given the choices, 285 is the most plausible if this complex pattern is the key.\n\nLet's try a much simpler approach.\nLook at the last digits: 2, 1, 3, 1, 9, (?)\nNo obvious pattern.\n\nGiven the difficulty in finding a simple mathematical progression, and the closeness of the result from the `x_n = 2*x_{n-1} + x_{n-2} - 6` pattern, let's assume `285` is the correct answer and try to find the logic.\nIf the next term is 285, the sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68, 166.\nThere is no obvious pattern here.\n\nLet's try another source or a different view.\n`2, 11, 23, 51, 119`\nThe pattern `a(n) = a(n-1) * 2 + a(n-2) - 4`\n`a(3) = 11*2 + 2 - 4 = 20` (No)\n\nLet's reconsider the difference of differences of differences.\nSeq: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, 285\nD1: 9, 12, 28, 68, 166\nD2: 3, 16, 40, 98\nD3: 13, 24, 58\nD4: 11, 34\nNo clear pattern.\n\nLet's assume the pattern is `Next = Previous * 2 + c`, where c is a sequence.\nc = 7, 1, 5, 17. If the next term is 285, c = 47.\nLet's analyze c = 7, 1, 5, 17, 47.\nThe differences are -6, 4, 12, 30.\nThis doesn't seem to follow a pattern either.\n\nThere seems to be no simple arithmetic or geometric pattern. Given the options, and the complexity, it's possible it's a non-standard pattern. However, without a clear logical rule, providing a definitive answer is difficult. Let me try one last attempt by working backward from 285.\n\nMaybe the pattern is related to prime numbers.\n2, 11, 23 are primes. 51=3*17, 119=7*17.\nThe next number is 285 = 3 * 5 * 19.\n\nLet's go back to the `2*prev + prev_prev - 6` logic.\n23 != 2*11+2-6\n51 = 2*23+11-6 = 46+11-6 = 51. This fits.\n119 = 2*51+23-6 = 102+23-6 = 119. This fits.\nSo the pattern is `x(n) = 2*x(n-1) + x(n-2) - 6` for n>3.\nThe next term would be `2*119 + 51 - 6 = 238 + 51 - 6 = 289 - 6 = 283`.\nThis is very close to 285. It is possible there is a typo in the options. Given the available choices, 285 is the most plausible answer derived from a semi-consistent, albeit complex, pattern.\n\nFinal check of a simple pattern: `y=2x+c`\n11 = 2*2 + 7\n23 = 11*2 + 1\n51 = 23*2 + 5\n119 = 51*2 + 17\nNext = 119*2 + c = 238 + c\nThe sequence `c` is 7, 1, 5, 17. What if `c` is `previous c * 3 - 20`? `7*3-20=1`. `1*3-20 != 5`.\nWhat if `c` is related to prime numbers? 7, (1), 5, 17. No obvious relation.\n\nGiven the high probability of a typo in such problems, and the closeness of 283 to 285, I will select B.\n\nFinal Pattern Proposal: `x(n) = 2*x(n-1) + x(n-2) - 6` for n>3.\n* x(1) = 2\n* x(2) = 11\n* x(3) = 23 (This does not fit: 2*11+2-6 = 18)\nSo this pattern is incorrect.\n\nLet's re-examine the differences of the added numbers `c`: 7, 1, 5, 17\nDifferences: -6, 4, 12\nSecond differences: 10, 8\nLet's assume the next second difference is 6.\nNext first difference: 12 + 6 = 18\nNext `c`: 17 + 18 = 35\nNext term in main sequence: 2 * 119 + 35 = 238 + 35 = 273.\nThis is not in the options.\n\nLet's assume the second differences are powers of 2 plus something. No.\nLet's try the pattern `x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - something`.\n`11 = 3*2+5`\n`23 = 3*11-10`\n`51 = 3*23 - 18`\n`119 = 3*51 - 34`\n`x = 3*119 - c = 357 - c`\nThe subtracted sequence is `-5, 10, 18, 34`.\nThe differences are `15, 8, 16`.\nThis sequence is erratic.\n\nLet's go back to the most simple analysis. Differences 9, 12, 28, 68. There must be a pattern here.\n9 * 1 + 3 = 12\n12 * 2 + 4 = 28\n28 * 2 + 12 = 68. The added number is the previous difference.\nSo, Next Difference = `68 * 2 + 28 = 136 + 28 = 164`.\nNext Term = `119 + 164 = 283`. Again, very close to 285.\n\nLet's try `Previous diff * n + n^2`\n9*1+1^2 = 10 (no)\nLet's check the logic `Diff_n = 2*Diff_{n-1} + Diff_{n-2}`.\n2*12 + 9 = 33 (not 28).\n2*28+12 = 68. This works for the 4th difference.\nIf this is the pattern (starting from the 4th term of the difference sequence), then the next difference is:\n2 * 68 + 28 = 136 + 28 = 164.\nNext term = 119 + 164 = 283.\nThis is consistently leading to 283, which strongly suggests 285 is the intended answer, possibly with a typo in the question's rule (`...-4` instead of `...-6` or some other minor consistent error). I'll stick with B.\n\nFinal attempt at a clean solution:\nSequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119\nThe pattern is `y = 2x + a`, where `a` is a sequence.\nThe sequence of `a` is `7, 1, 5, 17`.\nLet's find the pattern for `a`.\n7\n1 = 7 - 6\n5 = 1 + 4\n17 = 5 + 12\nThe added/subtracted values are `-6, 4, 12`.\nThe difference here is `10, 8`.\nThe next difference is `6`.\nSo the next value to add to 12 is `12+6 = 18`. No, the sequence is `10, 8`, next is `6`.\nThe next difference to add to `12` is `8-2=6`. Wait.\nThe sequence of differences is `-6, 4, 12`. Let's call this `d_a`.\nThe differences of `d_a` are `10, 8`. Let's call this `d_d_a`.\nThe next term in `d_d_a` is `6`.\nThe next term in `d_a` is `12+6 = 18`.\nThe next term in `a` is `17+18 = 35`.\nThe next term in the main sequence is `2*119 + 35 = 238 + 35 = 273`. Not an option.\n\nThere is no clear, simple solution. The fact that two different complex patterns lead to 283, which is very close to 285, is the strongest indicator.\n\n<<<B>>>"
