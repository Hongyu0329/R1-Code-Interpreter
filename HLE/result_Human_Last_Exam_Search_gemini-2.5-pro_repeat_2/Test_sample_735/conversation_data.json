    "There are exactly **19** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for all elements *a, b, c* in *S* (which need not be distinct), the equation *ab = c* has no solution. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (also referred to as \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups possessing such sets of size 3 was completed in a paper by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart. They demonstrated that any finite group containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 must have an order of 24 or less. Their work provides a comprehensive list of all such groups.\n\nThe 19 finite groups are:\n*   **Cyclic groups:** C_6, C_8, C_9, C_10, C_12\n*   **Dihedral groups:** D_8, D_10, D_12\n*   **Quaternion groups:** Q_8 (the quaternion group of order 8), Q_24 (the generalized quaternion group of order 24)\n*   **Alternating and Special Linear groups:** A_4 (the alternating group on 4 elements), SL(2,3) (the special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field with 3 elements)\n*   **Direct products:** C_2 × C_6, C_2 × C_8, C_3 × S_3, C_4 × C_4, C_2 × Q_8, C_2 × (C_2 × C_4), (C_2 × C_2) × S_3\n\nThis complete enumeration is found in the aforementioned research paper, which verifies that no other finite groups have this property.\n\n<<<19>>>"
