    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes complete oxidation, two molecules of ¹³C-labeled CO2 are released.\n\nHere is a step-by-step trace of the labeled carbons:\n*   **Starting Molecule**: Glucose is a six-carbon sugar. In 1,4-¹³C glucose, the carbon atoms at position 1 (C1) and position 4 (C4) are the heavy isotope ¹³C.\n*   **Glycolysis**: Glucose is split into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvate.\n    *   The cleavage of the six-carbon chain occurs between C3 and C4.\n    *   One half (C1, C2, C3) and the other half (C4, C5, C6) form the two pyruvate molecules.\n    *   Through the series of reactions in glycolysis, the C1 label of glucose ends up on the C3 carbon (methyl group) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The C4 label of glucose ends up on the C1 carbon (carboxyl group) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n*   **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction)**: Each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA, releasing one molecule of CO₂.\n    *   The CO₂ molecule comes from the C1 (carboxyl) carbon of pyruvate.\n    *   The pyruvate with the label at C1 (originally from C4 of glucose) will release one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂.\n    *   The other pyruvate, with the label at C3, releases an unlabeled CO₂. Its ¹³C label is retained in the resulting acetyl-CoA molecule.\n*   **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**: The labeled acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle.\n    *   In the first turn of the cycle, the carbons from the incoming acetyl-CoA are not released as CO₂.\n    *   The labeled carbon is incorporated into the cycle's intermediates.\n    *   In subsequent turns of the cycle, this second ¹³C-labeled carbon will eventually be released as CO₂.\n\nTherefore, the complete oxidation of one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose results in the release of a total of two ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules.\n\n<<<2>>>"
