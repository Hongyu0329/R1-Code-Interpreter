    "<<<An analytical formula that approximates the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for the small $\\epsilon$ regime is given by the asymptotic expansion:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5} - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-3/5}$\n\n**Derivation:**\n\nThe integral in question is of the form $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + g(x)} dx$, where $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. For small values of $\\epsilon$, the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region where $x$ is close to zero, as this is where the denominator approaches zero. This suggests an asymptotic analysis is appropriate.\n\nThe method used is a generalized version of Laplace's method. It involves a change of variable $u = g(x)$ and then expanding the resulting integrand for small $u$.\n\n1.  **Change of Variable**: Let $u = g(x)$. Then $dx = \\frac{du}{g'(x)}$, and the integral transforms to:\n    $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_{g(0)}^{g(15)} \\frac{1}{(\\epsilon + u)g'(x(u))} du$\n    As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, we can extend the upper integration limit to infinity.\n\n2.  **Asymptotic Expansion**: We need to find the series expansion of $\\frac{1}{g'(x(u))}$ for small $u$. This requires finding the expansion of $x$ in terms of $u$ (the inverse function of $g$).\n    *   $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + O(x^8)$.\n    *   Inverting this relationship for small $x$ and $u$ gives:\n        $x(u) = \\left(\\frac{u}{9}\\right)^{1/5} - \\frac{1}{9}\\left(\\frac{u}{9}\\right)^{2/5} + O(u^{3/5})$\n    *   The derivative is $g'(x) = 45x^4 + 30x^5 + O(x^7)$.\n    *   Substituting the expansion for $x(u)$ into $g'(x)$ and then taking the reciprocal gives the expansion for the Jacobian term:\n        $\\frac{1}{g'(x(u))} \\approx \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} u^{-4/5} - \\frac{2}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5}} u^{-3/5}$\n\n3.  **Integration**: We then integrate term by term. The integral can be expressed in terms of the Beta function using the standard integral formula:\n    $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{u^{\\alpha-1}}{\\epsilon+u} du = \\epsilon^{\\alpha-1} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi\\alpha)}$\n    *   For the first term, with the power $u^{-4/5}$, we have $\\alpha-1 = -4/5$, so $\\alpha = 1/5$.\n    *   For the second term, with the power $u^{-3/5}$, we have $\\alpha-1 = -3/5$, so $\\alpha = 2/5$.\n\n4.  **Final Formula**: Combining these results gives the two-term asymptotic expansion for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$. The first term, proportional to $\\epsilon^{-4/5}$, is the leading-order approximation, and the second term, proportional to $\\epsilon^{-3/5}$, is the first-order correction.>>>"
