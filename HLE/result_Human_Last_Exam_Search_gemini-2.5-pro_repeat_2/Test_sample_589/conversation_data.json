    "The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car is the 1995 movie *Now and Then*.\n\nIn a pivotal scene from the film, the character Roberta (played by Christina Ricci) is seen riding her pink bicycle head-on toward a car. This act of defiance is in response to being bullied by the Wormer brothers, who are in the vehicle. The film, a coming-of-age story, centers on four friends and their memorable summer in 1970. The movie was produced by New Line Cinema, a major film studio. While the film features several memorable scenes with the girls on their bikes, this particular moment stands out for its dramatic tension.\n\n<<<Now and Then>>>"
