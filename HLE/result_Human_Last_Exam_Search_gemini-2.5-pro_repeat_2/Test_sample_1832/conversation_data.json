    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which are derived from the metric tensor, represent the gravitational field's effect on the coordinates.\n\nFor the Schwarzschild metric, most of the Christoffel symbols are zero. The non-zero symbols are determined by the derivatives of the metric components. A detailed calculation reveals that there are 9 unique non-zero Christoffel symbols. These are:\n\n*   $\\Gamma^t_{tr} = \\Gamma^t_{rt}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{tt}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{rr}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\phi\\phi}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{r\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\theta\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi\\theta}$\n\nWhile there are 13 non-zero components in total when considering the 4x4x4 array of symbols, the number of distinct, non-zero symbols is 9 due to the symmetry of the lower two indices ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$). For instance, the source from MIT explicitly states, \"For the Schwarzschild metric, there are only 9 non-zero Christoffel symbols\".\n\n<<<9>>>"
