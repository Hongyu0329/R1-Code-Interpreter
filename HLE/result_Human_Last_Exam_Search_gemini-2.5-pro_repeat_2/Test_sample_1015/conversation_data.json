    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement and movement of the torso and hips.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso and hips throughout the movement. The backbend is initiated from the upper and middle spine, with the lower back providing support while the hips remain aligned over the feet. This method prioritizes control and a harmonious coordination of the entire body, with expressive and fluid arm movements (port de bras) and specific head positions designed to create clean lines and prevent injury. For instance, in a cambré derrière, the head is often turned to the side to avoid straining the neck.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is characterized by more dynamic and athletic movements. A significant feature of the Balanchine style is the use of an open hip, particularly noticeable in arabesques, which creates the illusion of a higher leg line. This willingness to move away from a strictly square torso and hips allows for a more three-dimensional and spiraling quality in the upper body. Balanchine's choreography often features a deep plié and emphasizes speed and energy. The upper body in the Balanchine method, including the head and arms, often appears more open and less formally curved than in other techniques. For example, a characteristic head position in the Balanchine style is with the cheek turned forward and upward. This approach results in a cambré derrière that can have a more fluid and less rigid appearance in the hips and torso.\n\nTherefore, the placement of the hip is a fundamental difference between the two methods in the execution of a cambré derrière.\n\n<<<B>>>"
