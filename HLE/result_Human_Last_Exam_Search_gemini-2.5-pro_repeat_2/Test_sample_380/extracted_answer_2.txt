In summary, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not radial but follows the Parker spiral. The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction to calculate normalized magnetic helicity is a common simplification based on Taylor's hypothesis, which assumes the solar wind flows radially. This approach is practical for single-spacecraft data analysis, but more sophisticated methods use a field-aligned coordinate system to compute helicity relative to the local magnetic field direction, which is physically more accurate for waves like AICs.
