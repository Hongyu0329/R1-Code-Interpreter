The set of uncountable cardinals in $Y$ is precisely $\{\omega_1\}$. A set containing a single element has an order type of 1.

Here is a detailed justification:

**1. The Uncountable Cardinals in Y Cannot Exceed $\omega_1$**

The definition of the set $Y$ is the union of sets $Y_{\mathcal{A}}$ over all valid sequences $\mathcal{A} = \langle a_{\alpha} : \alpha < \omega_1 \rangle$. For a cardinal $\kappa$ to be in any given $Y_{\mathcal{A}}$, there must exist a subset of indices $X \subseteq \omega_1$ such that $|X|=\kappa$. By the definition of a subset, the cardinality of $X$ cannot exceed the cardinality of the set it is a subset of. Therefore, $\kappa = |X| \le |\omega_1| = \omega_1$. This implies that the only uncountable cardinal that could possibly be in $Y$ is $\omega_1$.

Thus, the set $Y \setminus (\omega \cup \{\omega\})$, which is the set of all uncountable cardinals in $Y$, is either the empty set (order type 0) or the singleton set $\{\omega_1\}$ (order type 1).

**2. Construction of a Sequence $\mathcal{A}$ For Which $\omega_1 \in Y_{\mathcal{A}}$**

To show that the set is non-empty and thus contains $\omega_1$, we only need to construct a single sequence $\mathcal{A}$ that satisfies the given conditions and for which there exists a $\Delta$-system of size $\omega_1$ with a finite root.

Let's construct such a sequence $\mathcal{A} = \langle a_\alpha : \alpha < \omega_1 \rangle$:
*   Choose the countable ordinal $\gamma$ to be $\omega$, the set of natural numbers. This satisfies $\gamma < \omega_1$.
*   We need to define the sets $a_\alpha \subseteq \omega_1$ for each $\alpha < \omega_1$. Let's construct them as the union of two disjoint pieces, $a_\alpha = M_\alpha \cup S_\alpha$.
    *   For the first piece, let $\{M_\alpha : \alpha < \omega_1\}$ be an **almost disjoint family** of infinite subsets of $\omega$. This means that for all $\alpha < \omega_1$, $|M_\alpha|=\omega$, and for any distinct $\alpha, \beta < \omega_1$, the intersection $|M_\alpha \cap M_\beta|$ is finite. The existence of such a family of size equal to the continuum, $\mathfrak{c}$, is a standard result in combinatorial set theory, and since $\omega_1 \le \mathfrak{c}$, such a family of size $\omega_1$ is guaranteed to exist.
    *   For the second piece, let $\{S_\alpha : \alpha < \omega_1\}$ be a **partition** of the set $\omega_1 \setminus \omega$ into $\omega_1$ disjoint countable sets. The existence of such a partition is also a standard set-theoretic fact.

*   Now, we define our sequence as $a_\alpha = M_\alpha \cup S_\alpha$ for each $\alpha < \omega_1$. Let's verify that this sequence $\mathcal{A}$ has the required properties:
    *   Each $a_\alpha$ is a countable subset of $\omega_1$, as it is the union of two countable sets ($M_\alpha \subseteq \omega \subset \omega_1$ and $S_\alpha \subseteq \omega_1 \setminus \omega$).
    *   The condition that $|a_\alpha \cap \gamma| = \omega$ for our chosen $\gamma=\omega$ is met, since $|a_\alpha \cap \omega| = |(M_\alpha \cup S_\alpha) \cap \omega| = |M_\alpha \cap \omega| \cup |S_\alpha \cap \omega| = |M_\alpha| \cup \emptyset = \omega$.

**3. Finding a $\Delta$-system of size $\omega_1$**

Now we need to show that there exists a subset $X \subseteq \omega_1$ with $|X| = \omega_1$ such that $\langle a_\alpha : \alpha \in X \rangle$ is a $\Delta$-system with a finite root.

Consider the intersection of any two distinct sets in our constructed sequence:
$a_\alpha \cap a_\beta = (M_\alpha \cup S_\alpha) \cap (M_\beta \cup S_\beta) = (M_\alpha \cap M_\beta) \cup (S_\alpha \cap S_\beta)$.
Since the sets $S_\alpha$ are pairwise disjoint, $S_\alpha \cap S_\beta = \emptyset$. Thus, $a_\alpha \cap a_\beta = M_\alpha \cap M_\beta$.
By the construction of the almost disjoint family $\{M_\alpha\}$, this intersection is always a finite set.

We have a family of sets $\{a_\alpha : \alpha < \omega_1\}$ where the intersection of any two is a finite subset of $\omega$. We need to find a subfamily of size $\omega_1$ where all pairwise intersections are equal to the *same* finite set. This can be established using a coloring argument.

*   Let's color the pairs of ordinals $\{\alpha, \beta\}$ from $[\omega_1]^2$ by the finite set that is their intersection: $c(\{\alpha, \beta\}) = a_\alpha \cap a_\beta$.
*   The set of possible colors is the set of all finite subsets of $\omega$, which is $\mathcal{P}_{<\omega}(\omega)$. This set is countably infinite.
*   A fundamental result in infinite combinatorics, the **Dushnik-Miller theorem** (a partition relation denoted $\omega_1 \to (\omega_1)^2_{\aleph_0}$), states that for any coloring of the pairs of elements from a set of size $\omega_1$ with a countable number of colors, there must exist a monochromatic subset of size $\omega_1$.

Applying this theorem to our coloring, we conclude there exists a subset $X \subseteq \omega_1$ with $|X|=\omega_1$ and a fixed finite set $r \in \mathcal{P}_{<\omega}(\omega)$ such that for all distinct $\alpha, \beta \in X$, we have $a_\alpha \cap a_\beta = r$. This is precisely the definition of a $\Delta$-system of size $\omega_1$ with a finite root $r$.

**4. Conclusion**

We have shown that $\omega_1$ is a possible value for $\kappa$ and that no uncountable cardinal larger than $\omega_1$ can be a value for $\kappa$. Therefore, the set of uncountable cardinals in $Y$ is exactly $\{\omega_1\}$. The set
