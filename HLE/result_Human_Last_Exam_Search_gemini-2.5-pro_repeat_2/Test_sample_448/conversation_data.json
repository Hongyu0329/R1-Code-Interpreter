    "**Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.**\n\nOf the naturally occurring noble gases, radon is the most scarce. Its presence in the Earth's atmosphere is minuscule, estimated at an average of 1x10<sup>-19</sup>%. In the Earth's crust, its abundance is also exceedingly low, at approximately 4x10<sup>-13</sup> milligrams per kilogram.\n\nThe abundances of other noble gases in the Earth's atmosphere are significantly higher. Argon is the most plentiful at about 0.934%, followed by neon (0.0018%), helium (0.0005%), krypton (0.00011%), and xenon (0.0000087%).\n\nSimilarly, in the Earth's crust, radon is the least abundant among the noble gases. For comparison, the estimated crustal abundances of other noble gases are: argon (3.5 mg/kg), helium (8x10<sup>-3</sup> mg/kg), neon (5x10<sup>-3</sup> mg/kg), xenon (approximately 1.5x10<sup>-3</sup> mg/kg), and krypton (1x10<sup>-4</sup> mg/kg).\n\nRadon's extreme rarity is due to its radioactive nature; it has no stable isotopes and is formed from the radioactive decay of other elements like radium, thorium, and uranium. Its most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only about 3.8 days.\n\nIt is important to note that oganesson, also classified as a noble gas, is a synthetic element that does not occur in nature. Therefore, its abundance in terrestrial matter is effectively zero. Among the noble gases that are a natural component of Earth, radon is the rarest. The abundance levels of these gases have not significantly changed in the period leading up to 2002.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
