The horizontal distance $D$ is given by the formula:
$D = \frac{\gamma_0 v_0 c}{g} \text{arsinh}\left(\frac{g}{c\gamma_0}\sqrt{\frac{2\gamma_0 h}{g} + \frac{h^2}{c^2}}\right)$
where $\gamma_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_0^2/c^2}}$, $c$ is the speed of light, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The distance $D$ is independent of the mass $m$.
