    "The chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. This substance is a fluorescent dye used as a colorant in textiles, paper, and plastics.\n\nRhodamine B is described as a strong, bright red fluorescent dye. It is also known by other names including C.I. Pigment Violet 1, Basic Violet 10, and Brilliant Pink B. When mixed with quinacridone magenta, Rhodamine B is used to create the bright pink watercolor known as Opera Rose.\n\nThe basic ingredients for Crayola crayons are paraffin wax and color pigment. Therefore, Rhodamine B would be the pigment component that gives a crayon its color. Based on its properties and alternative names, this chemical is responsible for creating crayon colors in the red, pink, and violet family.\n\n<<<red, pink, or violet>>>"
