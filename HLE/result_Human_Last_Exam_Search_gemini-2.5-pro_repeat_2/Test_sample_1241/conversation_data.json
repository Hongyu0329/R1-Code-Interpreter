    "To find the steady-state probabilities, denoted as $P_i(+\\infty)$ or $\\pi_i$, of the given system, we must first analyze the provided Kolmogorov-Chapman system of equations. In a continuous-time Markov process, the sum of the probabilities of being in any state must always equal 1. Consequently, the sum of the time derivatives of these probabilities must be zero.\n\nThe provided system of equations is:\n1.  $P_{0}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) + 0.65 P_{1}(t)$\n2.  $P_{1}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4)P_{1}(t) + 0.392 P_{2}(t) + 0.008 P_{3}(t)$\n3.  $P_{2}'(t) = 0.4 P_{1}(t) - (0.392 + 0.008)P_{2}(t)$\n4.  $P_{3}'(t) = 0.008 P_{2}(t) - 0.008 P_{3}(t)$\n5.  $P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$\n\nSumming the first four differential equations reveals an inconsistency. The standard form for Kolmogorov forward equations, which describe the evolution of probabilities in a continuous-time Markov chain, ensures that the sum of the derivatives is zero. The provided system violates this, specifically in the second equation where the term involving $P_0(t)$ has a negative sign instead of a positive one. A positive sign would represent the flow of probability from state 0 to state 1.\n\nAssuming this is a typographical error, we correct the second equation to align with the standard form:\n$P_{1}'(t) = +0.019 P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4)P_{1}(t) + 0.392 P_{2}(t) + 0.008 P_{3}(t)$\n\nAt steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ approach constant values $\\pi_i$, and their derivatives $P_i'(t)$ become zero. This transforms the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations, which can be solved along with the normalization condition $\\sum \\pi_i = 1$.\n\nThe corrected system at steady state ($\\pi_i' = 0$) is:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 \\pi_0 + 0.65 \\pi_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 \\pi_0 - 1.05 \\pi_1 + 0.392 \\pi_2 + 0.008 \\pi_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 \\pi_1 - 0.4 \\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 \\pi_2 - 0.008 \\pi_3$\n5.  $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\nFrom equation (3), we deduce that $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2$.\nFrom equation (4), we find that $\\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\nTherefore, we have the relationship $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\nUsing equation (1), we can express $\\pi_0$ in terms of $\\pi_1$:\n$0.019 \\pi_0 = 0.65 \\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1$.\n\nNow, we substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1 + 3\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right) \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right) \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\pi_1 = 1 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$.\n\nNow we can find $\\pi_0$:\n$\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$, which is $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n\nCalculating the final numerical value:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768$.\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, we get 0.946.\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
