For a given momentum q, the effective electron-electron interaction, mediated by phonons, is given in the Matsubara frequency domain by:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, \nu_n) = - \frac{g^2 |\mathbf{q}|^2}{m} \frac{1}{\nu_n^2 + \omega_q^2}$
where $\mathbf{q}$ is the momentum transfer, $\nu_n$ is the bosonic Matsubara frequency (representing energy transfer), $g$ is the electron-phonon coupling constant, $m$ is the mass term from the coupling, and $\omega_q$ is the phonon frequency. This interaction is attractive.
