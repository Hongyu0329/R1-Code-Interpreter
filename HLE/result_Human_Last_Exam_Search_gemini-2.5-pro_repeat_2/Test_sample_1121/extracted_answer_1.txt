Here are the approximate numbers of non-Clifford gates required for the specified scenarios in topological quantum computing:

### **Universal Quantum Computing with a Distance-3 Surface Code**

For a universal quantum computer based on a 2D surface code with a distance-3 (d=3) code, the concept of a "required number" of non-Clifford gates for a simulation or implementation is not straightforward. A distance-3 code can detect a single physical qubit error but cannot correct an arbitrary one. Therefore, it is not considered fully fault-tolerant, and large-scale, error-corrected quantum computation is not possible.

However, research and experiments with small distance codes are crucial for developing the necessary techniques for fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this context, the implementation of a universal gate set on a d=3 code is about demonstrating the building blocks of quantum computation rather than achieving high logical qubit fidelity.

To perform a non-Clifford gate, such as a T gate, one would typically use a procedure called state injection. This involves preparing a physical qubit in a "magic state" (a resource state for the T gate) and "injecting" it into the logical qubit. In the simplest case, this means:

*   **Approximately 1 physical non-Clifford gate is used to produce one logical non-Clifford gate.**

This comes with the significant caveat that the resulting logical gate will have a very high error rate, not much better than the underlying physical gate error rate. Recent experiments have demonstrated the creation of magic states in a distance-3 error-correcting code using 28 physical qubits, which marks progress in this area.

### **Universal Quantum Computing with a Distance-5 Surface Code and 1% Gate Error Rate**

Implementing a universal quantum computer on a 2D surface code with a distance-5 (d=5) code and a faulty gate error rate of 1% is a more standard, albeit challenging, scenario for fault-tolerant quantum computation. A 1% physical error rate is high and near the theoretical threshold for the surface code, below which error correction is effective.

To achieve a universal gate set, Clifford gates (which can be implemented fault-tolerantly with relative ease through techniques like lattice surgery) must be supplemented with at least one non-Clifford gate, typically the T gate. Since non-Clifford gates cannot be performed transversally and fault-tolerantly in the 2D surface code, they are implemented using resource-intensive magic state distillation protocols. These protocols take many noisy physical magic states and "distill" them into a smaller number of high-fidelity logical magic states.

The number of non-Clifford gates required is therefore the overhead of this distillation process. A common protocol is the **15-to-1 distillation**, which consumes 15 magic states to produce one with a lower error rate.

Given a physical gate error rate (p) of 1% (or 0.01):

*   **One level of distillation:** To produce a single logical T gate, you would need approximately **15** noisy physical T gates. The error rate of the resulting distilled magic state would be roughly 35p³, which is approximately 35 * (0.01)³ = 3.5 x 10⁻⁵. This is a significant improvement but may not be sufficient for a long computation.

*   **Two levels of distillation:** For algorithms that require very low error rates, distillation protocols are often layered. After one round, the improved magic states can be used as inputs for a second round. In this case, the number of initial noisy T gates required would be approximately **15 x 15 = 225**. This would produce a single logical T gate with a much lower error rate, on the order of 35 * (3.5 x 10⁻⁵)³ ≈ 1.5 x 10⁻¹².

It is important to note that these numbers are approximations. The exact number of non-Clifford gates and the required levels of distillation depend heavily on the specific quantum algorithm being executed, as this determines the target logical error rate. The high initial error rate of 1% makes the resource requirements for fault-tolerance particularly demanding.
