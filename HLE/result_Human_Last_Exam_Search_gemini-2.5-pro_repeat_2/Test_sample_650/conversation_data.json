    "The computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm is determined by the number of iterations in the `while` loop. This algorithm converts an integer `n` to its representation in base `c` by repeatedly dividing by the base `c` and recording the remainder.\n\nHere is an analysis of the algorithm's complexity:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Step 1 of the algorithm involves a fixed number of basic arithmetic operations (assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). This step takes constant time, which can be denoted as O(1).\n\n2.  **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0.\n    *   In each iteration, `n` is effectively divided by `c`. The loop variable `q` takes the values `⌊n/c⌋`, `⌊n/c²⌋`, `⌊n/c³⌋`, and so on.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0, which happens when `c^k > n`, where `k` is the number of iterations.\n    *   The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is 0 is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`. The number of digits in the base-c representation of n is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`.\n    *   Each iteration of the loop consists of a constant number of operations (increment, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction).\n\n3.  **Total Complexity**: The total time is dominated by the `while` loop. Since the loop runs approximately `log_c(n)` times and each iteration takes constant time, the overall time complexity is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\nIn Big O notation, the base of the logarithm is usually omitted because logarithms of different bases are related by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log_2(n) / log_2(c)`), and constant factors are ignored. Therefore, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is O(log n).\n\nIt's important to note that this analysis assumes that the arithmetic operations (division, multiplication) on numbers up to size `n` take constant time. If we consider the bit complexity, where operations on larger numbers take more time, the analysis becomes more complex, often involving the complexity of multiplication, `M(n)`. However, for a standard analysis in an introductory algorithms course, the O(log n) complexity is the expected answer.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
