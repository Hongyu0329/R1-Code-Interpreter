The expected chain quality is a decreasing function of both the adversary's mining power (β) and the tie-breaking probability (p). The exact value is derived from a complex state-based model, but it will be lower than (1-β) whenever the conditions (the values of β and p) allow the selfish mining strategy to be more profitable for the adversary than honest mining. The thresholds for profitability are well-established: β > 1/3 for p=0; β > 1/4 for p=0.5; and β > 0 for p=1.
