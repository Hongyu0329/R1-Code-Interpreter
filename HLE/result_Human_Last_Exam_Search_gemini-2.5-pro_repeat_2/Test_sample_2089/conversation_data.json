    "I have conducted multiple searches for an Oscar-nominated film featuring a scene where a character says \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus, which in turn seals their fate. Despite my efforts, I have not been able to identify a film that matches this specific and detailed description.\n\nMy search included looking for:\n*   Oscar-nominated films with pivotal bus scenes.\n*   Movie scenes where the phrase \"Thank you\" has fatal consequences.\n*   Fateful encounters on buses in critically acclaimed films.\n\nWhile there are numerous Oscar-nominated films with memorable scenes involving buses, such as \"The Sweet Hereafter\" which centers around a tragic bus accident, and others where buses are part of the setting like \"King Richard,\" none of the search results describe the precise sequence of events outlined in your query. There is a documented real-life event where the lead actor of \"Apocalypse Now\" was picked up by a bus after a heart attack during filming, but this is not a scene within the film itself.\n\nIt is possible the film is not Oscar-nominated, or that the details of the scene are remembered slightly differently. Based on the information available through my searches, I cannot provide the title of the film you are looking for.\n\n<<<I am unable to find the Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus."
