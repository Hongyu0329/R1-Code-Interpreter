    "Let $S$ be a schema containing $4$ unary predicates, and let the logic fragment be $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. The VC dimension of this logical fragment is determined by the complexity of the \"concepts\" or sets that can be defined by its formulas.\n\n### 1. Definable Sets (Concept Class)\n\nA formula in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with one free variable, say $x$, defines a subset of the domain of a given structure. Let the four unary predicates be $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ in this fragment can be constructed from atomic formulas $P_i(y)$ (where $y$ is any variable) using conjunction ($\\land$), existential quantification ($\\exists$), true ($\\top$), and false ($\\bot$). Due to the restricted nature of the fragment (only unary predicates), any existential quantifier $\\exists y$ that binds a variable $y \\neq x$ will form a subformula that is a *sentence* (it has no free variables). The truth of this sentence is independent of the specific value assigned to $x$.\n\nConsequently, any formula $\\phi(x)$ is logically equivalent to a formula of the form:\n$$ (\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)) \\land C $$\nwhere $I$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, and $C$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables).\n\nIn any given structure (a domain of elements and interpretations for the predicates), the sentence $C$ is either true or false.\n*   If $C$ is false, the formula $\\phi(x)$ defines the empty set ($\\emptyset$), which is also definable by $\\bot$.\n*   If $C$ is true, the formula $\\phi(x)$ defines the set of elements satisfying $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$, which is the set $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i$.\n\nTherefore, for any structure, the class of sets definable by this logic is a subset of the collection of all possible intersections of the base predicates:\n$$ \\mathcal{C} = \\left\\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\right\\} $$\nThis includes the entire domain (when $I$ is the empty set, corresponding to the formula $\\top$) and the empty set (definable by $\\bot$ or a contradictory intersection).\n\n### 2. Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a logic is the maximum VC dimension of the concept class it defines, taken over all possible structures. The problem thus reduces to finding the VC dimension of the concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ of intersections of 4 base sets. It is a standard result that the VC dimension of a concept class formed by all intersections of $n$ base sets is $n$. For this case, with $n=4$, the VC dimension is 4.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we must show two things:\n1.  There exists a structure and a set of 4 elements that can be shattered.\n2.  No set of 5 elements can be shattered in any structure.\n\n**VC dimension is at least 4:**\nWe need to construct a structure where a set of size 4 can be shattered. Let the universe be $U = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$ and let this also be the set we want to shatter. We define the four predicates as follows:\n*   $P_1 = U \\setminus \\{x_1\\} = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_2 = U \\setminus \\{x_2\\} = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_3 = U \\setminus \\{x_3\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_4 = U \\setminus \\{x_4\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n\nAny subset $Y \\subseteq U$ can be expressed as an intersection of these predicates. Specifically, to obtain a subset $Y$, we take the intersection of the predicates $P_i$ for all $i$ such that $x_i$ is *not* in $Y$. For example, to obtain the subset $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$, we intersect $P_3$ and $P_4$: $P_3 \\cap P_4 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\} \\cap \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\} = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$. Since all $2^4=16$ subsets of $U$ can be formed in this way, the set $U$ is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**VC dimension is at most 4:**\nA set of points $X$ is shattered by a concept class if every subset of $X$ can be generated by intersecting $X$ with a concept from the class. To shatter a set of size $d$, we need to be able to generate $2^d$ distinct subsets.\nOur concept class, $\\mathcal{C} = \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\}$, contains at most $2^4 = 16$ distinct concepts (one for each subset $I$).\nTo shatter a set of 5 elements, we would need to generate $2^5 = 32$ distinct subsets. Since our concept class has at most 16 concepts, it is impossible to generate 32 distinct subsets. Therefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered. This holds for any structure.\n\nSince the VC dimension is at least 4 and at most 4, it must be exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
