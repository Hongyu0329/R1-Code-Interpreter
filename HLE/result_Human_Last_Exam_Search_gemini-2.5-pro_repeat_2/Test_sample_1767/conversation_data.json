    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is 2.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle of the additivity of Chern numbers in topological systems. When two topological systems are combined to form a larger system, their topological invariants, such as the Chern number, are summed. In this scenario, the two Chern insulators can be treated as a single composite system.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of a material. For a system composed of distinct parts with negligible interaction between their bulks, the total Chern number is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual components. Therefore, for two Chern insulators with a Chern number (C) of 1, the total Chern number of the combined system is C_total = C₁ + C₂ = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThis is further supported by the bulk-boundary correspondence principle. At the interface between two regions with different Chern numbers, C₁ and C₂, the number of conducting chiral edge states is given by the difference |C₁ - C₂|. For instance, at the boundary between a Chern insulator with C=1 and a trivial insulator with C=0, there is one edge state. If two C=1 insulators are joined, there would be no net change in the Chern number across the immediate interface, resulting in zero interface states between them. However, the outer edges of the combined system would each carry chiral edge states corresponding to the total Chern number of the system. The overall Hall conductance of the combined system, which is directly proportional to the total Chern number, would be twice that of a single C=1 insulator.\n\n<<<2>>>"
