    "The problem of placing non-attacking queens on a toroidal chessboard is a classic combinatorial problem. We are asked to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n\nOn a toroidal board, the rows, columns, and diagonals wrap around. For two queens placed at coordinates (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) on an n x n board, the non-attacking conditions are:\n1.  r1 ≠ r2 (different rows)\n2.  c1 ≠ c2 (different columns)\n3.  r1 - c1 ≢ r2 - c2 (mod n) (different main diagonals)\n4.  r1 + c1 ≢ r2 + c2 (mod n) (different anti-diagonals)\n\nIn our case, we are placing k=4 queens on an n=5 board.\n\nA placement of 4 queens must leave exactly one row and one column empty. There are 5 choices for the empty row and 5 choices for the empty column. Let the coordinates be indexed from 0 to 4.\n\nLet's denote the chosen empty row and column as `er` and `ec`, respectively. The four queens must be placed in the rows `R = Z_5 \\ {er}` and columns `C = Z_5 \\ {ec}`. The placement can be described by a bijection (a permutation) `p: R -> C`.\n\nThe non-attacking conditions on the diagonals mean that the set of main diagonal indices, `D = {r - p(r) mod 5 | r ∈ R}`, and the set of anti-diagonal indices, `S = {r + p(r) mod 5 | r ∈ R}`, must each contain 4 distinct values. This implies there is one empty main diagonal `d_empty` and one empty anti-diagonal `s_empty`.\n\nA key insight is to relate the empty rows/columns to the empty diagonals. By summing the indices over the positions of the four queens, we can establish the following relationships (modulo 5):\n*   `er - ec ≡ d_empty`\n*   `er + ec ≡ s_empty`\n\nThis shows a direct correspondence between the choice of empty row/column `(er, ec)` and the choice of empty diagonals `(d_empty, s_empty)`. Since there are 5 choices for `er` and 5 for `ec`, there are 25 possible `(er, ec)` pairs, which in turn correspond to 25 unique `(d_empty, s_empty)` pairs.\n\nThe total number of solutions is the sum of the number of valid placements for each of these 25 cases. However, due to the symmetries of the toroidal board, we can argue that the number of valid placements is the same for every case. The group of translations `(r, c) -> (r+a, c+b)` on the board can map any pair of empty diagonals `(d_empty, s_empty)` to any other pair. Therefore, the number of solutions for each case is constant.\n\nWe can calculate this constant by choosing a specific case, for example, `er = 4` and `ec = 4`. This corresponds to `d_empty = 0` and `s_empty = 3`. The problem reduces to finding the number of permutations `p` of `{0, 1, 2, 3}` such that:\n*   The set of differences `{i - p(i) mod 5}` is `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. This implies `p` must be a derangement (no fixed points).\n*   The set of sums `{i + p(i) mod 5}` is `{0, 1, 2, 4}`.\n\nThere are 9 derangements of the set `{0, 1, 2, 3}`. By testing each one, we find that exactly two of them satisfy the condition on the sums:\n1.  `p = (1, 3, 0, 2)`: The positions are (0,1), (1,3), (2,0), (3,2).\n2.  `p = (2, 0, 3, 1)`: The positions are (0,2), (1,0), (2,3), (3,1).\n\nSo, for this specific choice of empty row and column, there are 2 valid placements. Since this number is constant across all 25 cases, the total number of ways is the product of the number of cases and the number of solutions per case.\n\nTotal ways = (Number of choices for `er` and `ec`) × (Number of solutions per case)\nTotal ways = 25 × 2 = 50.\n\nThus, there are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
