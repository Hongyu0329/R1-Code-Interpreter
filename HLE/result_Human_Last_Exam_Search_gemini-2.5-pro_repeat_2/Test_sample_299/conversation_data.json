    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at this conclusion:\n\n### 1. Basic Properties of the Function\n\nFirst, we establish some fundamental properties that any continuous function $f$ satisfying the given equation must have.\n\n*   **Injectivity:** The function $f$ must be one-to-one (injective). If we assume $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. This implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is itself injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$.\n*   **Monotonicity:** A continuous function that is injective on the entire real line must be strictly monotonic. Thus, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n*   **Range:** The range of $f(f(x))$ is the range of $\\exp(x)$, which is $(0, \\infty)$. This means that the range of $f$ must be a subset of $(0, \\infty)$, because if $y$ is in the range of $f$, then $f(y)$ must be positive.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Monotonicity Cases\n\nWe now analyze the two possibilities for the monotonicity of $f$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing.**\n    If $f$ is a strictly decreasing function, its composition with itself, $f(f(x))$, must be strictly increasing. Since $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, this case is plausible. However, if $f$ is a strictly decreasing function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $(0, \\infty)$, its value must approach a finite limit $L \\ge 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. Due to the continuity of $f$, as $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) \\to L$, and therefore $f(f(x)) \\to f(L)$. But we also have $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, which approaches $\\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$. This leads to the contradiction $f(L) = \\infty$, which is impossible for a real-valued function. Therefore, no strictly decreasing continuous solution exists.\n\n*   **Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing.**\n    If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f(f(x))$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent with $\\exp(x)$. Furthermore, we can show that $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The equation $\\exp(x) = x$ has no real solutions, which implies $f(x)$ can never be equal to $x$. Since $f(x) - x$ is a continuous function that is never zero, it must be either always positive or always negative. If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would mean $\\exp(x) < x$, which is false for all real $x$. Thus, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.\n\n### 3. Construction and Cardinality of Solutions\n\nThe problem of finding such a function is known as finding the \"functional square root\" of the exponential function. Solutions can be constructed, and the number of solutions can be determined.\n\nThe construction method demonstrates that there is a large degree of freedom in defining such a function:\n1.  **Choose a starting point:** Select a value for $f(0)$. Let $f(0) = c$. Since $f$ must be strictly increasing and $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$, we can deduce that $f(c)=1$. As $f$ is increasing and $0 < c$ would imply $f(0) < f(c)$ (so $c < 1$), we must have $c \\in (0, 1)$.\n2.  **Define on a base interval:** On the interval $[0, c]$, we can define $f(x)$ as any continuous, strictly increasing function $h(x)$ that maps $[0, c]$ to $[c, 1]$.\n3.  **Extend the function:** Once $f$ is defined on $[0, c]$, its definition everywhere else is uniquely determined by the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. For example, for any $y \\in [c, 1]$, there is a unique $x \\in [0, c]$ such that $y = h(x)$. Then we must define $f(y) = f(h(x)) = f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) = \\exp(h^{-1}(y))$. This process can be continued to cover the entire real line.\n\nThe set of solutions is therefore determined by the possible choices in the construction:\n*   There is an uncountably infinite number of choices for the value $c = f(0) \\in (0, 1)$.\n*   For each choice of $c$, there is an uncountably infinite number of choices for the continuous, strictly increasing bijection $h: [0, c] \\to [c, 1]$. The number of such functions is equal to the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSince there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for the initial bijection on a given interval, the total number of distinct continuous functions $f$ that satisfy the equation is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$. The total number of continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$, so the cardinality cannot be greater.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set of these functions is precisely $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
