    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that is read by a ribosome to synthesize a protein. Since the provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an ORF, the correct reading frame will be the one that does not contain any stop codons (UAA, UAG, or UGA in RNA, which correspond to TAA, TAG, and TGA in the given DNA sequence).\n\nThe DNA sequence can be translated in three possible forward reading frames.\n\n**Frame 1:** `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga ...`\nThis frame contains the codon `tag` which is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\n**Frame 2:** `g gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c`\nThis frame translates to the following protein sequence without any stop codons:\n**DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSASLPTYPNPNLNSVLAERLEKW**\n\n**Frame 3:** `gg aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg ...`\nThis frame contains the codon `tga` which is a stop codon.
