    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four main colors: white, red, black, and violet.\n\nThe primary and most common allotropes of phosphorus are:\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This is a waxy, translucent solid that is colorless when pure. However, it often appears pale yellow due to the presence of impurities or upon exposure to light, which is why it is also known as yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is more stable than white phosphorus and is commonly seen as a dark red powder. It can also have an iron-grey luster in its crystalline form.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus and has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite. It exists in two forms, α-black and β-black, both of which are black.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a crystalline form that is deep red or purple.\n\nWhile other terms like \"scarlet phosphorus\" exist, they are generally considered to be finer crystalline forms of red phosphorus rather than distinct allotropes. Therefore, the distinct observable colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
