    "When a gene is duplicated, the most common fate is that one copy becomes non-functional and is lost, a process called pseudogenization. However, several mechanisms can lead to the retention and divergence of both copies. The most prominent models for this are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the likely mechanisms:\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that an ancestral gene had multiple functions or expression patterns (e.g., activity in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that degrade or silence different subfunctions. As a result, both copies become specialists and are required to collectively perform the full range of the original ancestral gene's functions. This process, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, is considered a highly plausible and common mechanism for preserving duplicate genes because it relies on relatively frequent degenerative mutations rather than rare beneficial ones.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization:** In this scenario, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. While this is a crucial source of evolutionary novelty, it is thought to be a rarer event than pseudogenization or subfunctionalization because it requires the occurrence of advantageous mutations.\n\n*   **Gene Conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between homologous sequences, which can include duplicated genes. It can cause the sequences of the two copies to become more similar (homogenization) or can spread a new mutation from one copy to the other. While it is a mechanism of interaction and divergence, it is not the primary model for why both genes are retained in the first place, unlike sub- or neofunctionalization.\n\n*   **Pseudogenization:** This is the most common outcome for a duplicated gene, where one copy acquires debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene. This represents the *loss* of a duplicate, not its retention.\n\n*   **Adaptive Radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary process where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a mechanism for retaining specific duplicate genes within a single genome.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are key mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely initial mechanism for preserving duplicates. It provides a passive, neutral route for retention, as it depends on common loss-of-function mutations that make both copies essential to fulfill the ancestral role. This initial retention by subfunctionalization can then provide an evolutionary window for one of the copies to potentially acquire a new function later on (neofunctionalization).\n\nGiven the options, subfunctionalization represents the most likely and widely cited mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of many duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
