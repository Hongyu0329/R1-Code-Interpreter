The described research approach is not valid because human vision is fundamentally different from that of the primary predators (birds) of bumblebees. Birds are tetrachromatic and can perceive ultraviolet light, a spectrum invisible to humans, which is a critical component of the bees' warning coloration. Therefore, clusters based on human visual similarity may not reflect the functional mimicry syndromes that have evolved to be effective signals to predators.
