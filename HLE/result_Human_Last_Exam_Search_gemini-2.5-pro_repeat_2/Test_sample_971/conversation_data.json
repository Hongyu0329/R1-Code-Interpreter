    "In the 2008 Bolshoi Ballet production of *Don Quixote*, Natalia Osipova's performance as Kitri was widely acclaimed for its technical brilliance and exuberant energy. While there is no official record or definitive count of the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position she executed in the Act I variation, video recordings of her 2008 performance are available for analysis.\n\nReviews from the period frequently praise her exceptional turning ability. One review of a 2007 performance described her Act I variation as finishing with a \"tsunami of pirouettes,\" which was met with a tremendous ovation. Another review noted her tendency to conclude every variation with a \"dizzying series of revolutions.\" Her performances with the Bolshoi were known for their pyrotechnics and flamboyance.\n\nThe choreography for Kitri's variations can differ between productions and even between performances by the same artist, with exceptional dancers like Osipova often adding more turns. Detailed choreographic notes for this specific 2008 performance are not publicly available. Therefore, to determine the precise number of pirouettes, one would need to carefully watch and count them from the available video recordings of her 2008 performances.\n\n<<<The precise number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of the Bolshoi Ballet's 2008 production of *Don Quixote* is not documented in available written records. An exact count would require a visual analysis of the performance videos from that year.>>>"
