The precise number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of the Bolshoi Ballet's 2008 production of *Don Quixote* is not documented in available written records. An exact count would require a visual analysis of the performance videos from that year.
