    "This puzzle requires figuring out a transformation rule from an input grid of numbers to an output grid. The grids are represented as comma-separated strings.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\nLet's break down the transformation by observing the changes between the input and output in the provided examples.\n\n**1. Parsing the Input and Output**\n\nThe strings are grids where commas separate the rows.\n\n**Example A:**\n*   Input_A:\n    ```\n    001111\n    121111\n    111111\n    ```\n*   Output_A:\n    ```\n    201111\n    101111\n    111111\n    ```\n\n**Example B:**\n*   Input_B:\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000011110\n    1111002111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   Output_B:\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000211110\n    1111000111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n\n**2. Identifying the Changes**\n\nBy comparing the input and output grids, we can identify which cells change.\n\n*   **In Example A:**\n    *   The '2' at position (row=1, col=1) becomes a '0'.\n    *   The '0' at position (row=0, col=0) becomes a '2'.\n\n*   **In Example B:**\n    *   The '2' at position (row=3, col=6) becomes a '0'.\n    *   The '0' at position (row=2, col=7) becomes a '2'.\n\n**3. Deducing the Rule**\n\nThe transformation is triggered by the presence of a '2' in the grid. Let's denote the position of the '2' as `(r, c)`.\n\n*   **Rule 1: The '2' becomes a '0'.**\n    In both examples, the cell containing the '2' changes to a '0' in the output.\n    *   A: `Input_A[1][1]` ('2') -> `Output_A[1][1]` ('0').\n    *   B: `Input_B[3][6]` ('2') -> `Output_B[3][6]` ('0').\n\n*   **Rule 2: A '0' becomes a '2'.**\n    In both examples, another cell, which was originally '0', changes to '2'. The position of this change seems to be relative to the original '2'. Let's define the neighbors to the immediate left and right of the '2' in the same row as `L` and `R`.\n    *   `L = Input[r][c-1]`\n    *   `R = Input[r][c+1]`\n\n    Let's analyze the relative position `(dr, dc)` of the `0 -> 2` change with respect to the original '2'.\n\n    *   **In Example A:**\n        *   '2' is at `(1,1)`.\n        *   `L = Input_A[1][0] = '1'`.\n        *   `R = Input_A[1][2] = '1'`.\n        *   The change occurs at `(0,0)`, which is `(r-1, c-1)` relative to the '2'. So, `(dr, dc) = (-1, -1)`.\n\n    *   **In Example B:**\n        *   '2' is at `(3,6)`.\n        *   `L = Input_B[3][5] = '0'`.\n        *   `R = Input_B[3][7] = '1'`.\n        *   The change occurs at `(2,7)`, which is `(r-1, c+1)` relative to the '2'. So, `(dr, dc) = (-1, 1)`.\n\n    We can establish a formula for `(dr, dc)` based on the values of `L` and `R` (treating '0' and '1' as integers):\n    *   `dr` is consistently -1 in both examples.\n    *   For `dc`, we have:\n        *   When `L=1, R=1`, `dc=-1`.\n        *   When `L=0, R=1`, `dc=1`.\n    *   A simple linear formula can be derived: `dc = -2*L + R`.\n        *   Check for A: `dc = -2*1 + 1 = -1`. (Correct)\n        *   Check for B: `dc = -2*0 + 1 = 1`. (Correct)\n\nThe complete transformation rule is:\n1.  Locate the '2' at position `(r, c)`.\n2.  In the output, the character at `(r, c)` becomes '0'.\n3.  Determine the values of the left neighbor `L = Input[r][c-1]` and right neighbor `R = Input[r][c+1]`.\n4.  Calculate the relative position of the second change: `dr = -1` and `dc = -2*L + R`.\n5.  The character at `(r+dr, c+dc)`, which must be '0', becomes '2' in the output.\n6.  All other characters in the grid remain unchanged.\n\n### Solving for Input_C\n\nNow, we apply this rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n*   **Grid representation:**\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n\n1.  The '2' is at `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n2.  The output at `(1, 4)` will be '0'.\n3.  Find `L` and `R`:\n    *   `L = Input_C[1][3] = '1'`.\n    *   `R = Input_C[1][5] = '0'`.\n4.  Calculate `(dr, dc)`:\n    *   `dr = -1`.\n    *   `dc = -2*1 + 0 = -2`.\n5.  The `0 -> 2` change will occur at `(r+dr, c+dc) = (1-1, 4-2) = (0, 2)`.\n    *   We check `Input_C[0][2]`, which is indeed '0'. This position will become '2'.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n\n*   **Row 0:** The original is `000000`. The character at index 2 changes to '2'. The new row is `002000`.\n*   **Row 1:** The original is `011120`. The character at index 4 changes to '0'. The new row is `011100`.\n*   **Row 2:** The original is `111111`. There are no changes. The row remains `111111`.\n\nCombining these rows with commas gives the final output string.\n\n`MISSING` = `002000,011100,111111`\n\n<<<002000,011100,111111>>>"
