The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor, arising from the weak localization effect, is given by the formula δσ = - e² / (πħL_φ), where e is the electron charge, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and L_φ is the phase coherence length. This correction is negative, indicating an increase in resistivity due to constructive quantum interference of time-reversed electron paths. The phase coherence length L_φ = sqrt(Dτ_φ) depends on the electron diffusion constant D and the phase coherence time τ_φ, which is limited by inelastic scattering processes.
