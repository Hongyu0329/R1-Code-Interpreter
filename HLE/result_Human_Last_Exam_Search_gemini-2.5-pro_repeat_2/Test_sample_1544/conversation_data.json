    "In the given chess position, with the FEN string 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1, White's optimal move is to force a queen trade, which leads to a winning pawn endgame.\n\nThe most decisive move for White is:\n\n**Qxc5+**\n\nThis move checks the black king. Black's only legal response is to recapture the queen with the b-pawn:\n\n**...bxc5**\n\nAfter this exchange, the resulting position is a pawn endgame where White has a clear advantage. White's passed d-pawn, supported by the king, becomes a winning threat that Black's king is too far away to effectively counter. White can then advance their king to support the pawn's promotion, securing the victory.\n\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
