    "According to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> and other pharmacy standards, a single-dose container ampule has no Beyond-Use Date (BUD) from the time of puncture in a sterile environment because it must not be stored. Once an ampule is opened, it cannot be resealed, and any unused portion must be discarded immediately.\n\nThis differs from a single-dose *vial*. If a single-dose vial is punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, it may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture, as long as the proper storage requirements are maintained. However, this provision does not apply to ampules.\n\nTherefore, the BUD for a single-dose ampule once opened is immediate use, and it cannot be stored for any period.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any period of time and any unused portion must be discarded immediately.>>>"
