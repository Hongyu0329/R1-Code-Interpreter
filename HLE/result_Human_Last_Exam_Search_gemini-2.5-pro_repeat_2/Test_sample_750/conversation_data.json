    "Here is the step-by-step solution for the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\nThe equation to solve is:\n$z \\cdot i = i^z$\n\nWe can express $i$ in exponential form. The general form is $i = e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for any integer $k$.\nThe term $i^z$ can be written as $e^{z \\ln(i)}$.\nThe logarithm of $i$ is multi-valued:\n$\\ln(i) = \\ln\\left(e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}\\right) = i\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's denote $\\alpha_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. So, $\\ln(i) = i\\alpha_k$.\nThe original equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot i\\alpha_k}$\n\nLet $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.\nThe left side of the equation is:\n$z \\cdot i = (x+yi)i = xi + yi^2 = -y + xi$\n\nThe right side of the equation is:\n$e^{z \\cdot i\\alpha_k} = e^{(x+yi)i\\alpha_k} = e^{(xi - y)\\alpha_k} = e^{-y\\alpha_k} \\cdot e^{ix\\alpha_k}$\n$e^{-y\\alpha_k} \\cdot e^{ix\\alpha_k} = e^{-y\\alpha_k}(\\cos(x\\alpha_k) + i\\sin(x\\alpha_k))$\n\nNow, we equate the real and imaginary parts of both sides:\n1.  $-y = e^{-y\\alpha_k} \\cos(x\\alpha_k)$\n2.  $x = e^{-y\\alpha_k} \\sin(x\\alpha_k)$\n\nWe can analyze these two equations to find the solutions for $z=x+yi$.\n\n### Case 1: Real Solutions ($y=0$)\nIf $y=0$, the equations become:\n1.  $0 = e^{0} \\cos(x\\alpha_k) \\implies \\cos(x\\alpha_k) = 0$\n2.  $x = e^{0} \\sin(x\\alpha_k) \\implies x = \\sin(x\\alpha_k)$\n\nFrom $\\cos(x\\alpha_k) = 0$, we have $x\\alpha_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nThis implies that $\\sin(x\\alpha_k) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = (-1)^n \\cos(n\\pi) = \\pm 1$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation, $x = \\pm 1$.\n\n*   If $x=1$: The second equation gives $1 = \\sin(\\alpha_k)$. Since $\\alpha_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, $\\sin(\\alpha_k) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 1$. This is always true for any integer $k$. The first equation $\\cos(\\alpha_k)=0$ is also always true. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n    *Check*: $1 \\cdot i = i^1 \\implies i=i$. This is correct.\n\n*   If $x=-1$: The second equation gives $-1 = \\sin(-\\alpha_k) = -\\sin(\\alpha_k)$. This means $\\sin(\\alpha_k)=1$, which is always true for any $k$. The first equation $\\cos(-\\alpha_k) = \\cos(\\alpha_k) = 0$ is also always true. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n    *Check*: $(-1) \\cdot i = i^{-1} \\implies -i = \\frac{1}{i} = \\frac{-i}{-i \\cdot i} = -i$. This is correct.\n\nSo, there are two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n### Case 2: Purely Imaginary Solutions ($x=0$)\nIf $x=0$, the equations become:\n1.  $-y = e^{-y\\alpha_k} \\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-y\\alpha_k}$\n2.  $0 = e^{-y\\alpha_k} \\sin(0) \\implies 0=0$. This gives no additional information.\n\nWe need to solve the equation $-y = e^{-y\\alpha_k}$ for real $y$.\nLet's analyze this equation based on the sign of $\\alpha_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $\\alpha_k > 0$. Let's analyze the function $f(y) = y + e^{-y\\alpha_k}$. We are looking for roots of $f(y)=0$. Since $e^{-y\\alpha_k}$ is always positive, a solution would require $y$ to be negative. Let $y = -Y$ where $Y>0$. The equation becomes $Y = e^{Y\\alpha_k}$. Let $g(Y)=Y-e^{Y\\alpha_k}$. The derivative is $g'(Y)=1-\\alpha_k e^{Y\\alpha_k}$. Setting $g'(Y)=0$ gives $Y=1/\\alpha_k$ as the location of the maximum value of $g(Y)$. The maximum value is $g(1/\\alpha_k) = 1/\\alpha_k - e$. Since for $k \\ge 0$, $\\alpha_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1/e$, we have $1/\\alpha_k < e$, so the maximum value is negative. Thus, there are no solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n\n*   If $k < 0$, let $k = -m$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$. Then $\\alpha_{-m} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2m\\pi < 0$. Let $|\\alpha_{-m}| = (4m-1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The equation remains $-y = e^{-y\\alpha_{-m}}$. Again, let $y=-Y$ with $Y>0$. The equation becomes $Y = e^{-Y|\\alpha_{-m}|}$. Let $h(Y) = Y - e^{-Y|\\alpha_{-m}|}$. The derivative is $h'(Y) = 1 + |\\alpha_{-m}|e^{-Y|\\alpha_{-m}|} > 0$, so the function is strictly increasing. Since $h(0)=-1$ and $\\lim_{Y\\to\\infty} h(Y) = \\infty$, there is exactly one positive solution $Y_m$ for each $m \\ge 1$.\nThis equation can be solved using the Lambert W function. The Lambert W function is defined by $W(x)e^{W(x)}=x$.\nThe equation $Y = e^{-Y|\\alpha_{-m}|}$ can be rewritten as $Y|\\alpha_{-m}| e^{Y|\\alpha_{-m}|} = |\\alpha_{-m}|$.\nThis implies $Y|\\alpha_{-m}| = W(|\\alpha_{-m}|)$, so $Y_m = \\frac{W(|\\alpha_{-m}|)}{|\\alpha_{-m}|}$.\nThe solutions are $z_m = iy_m = -iY_m$.\n\nSo, we have an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions for $m \\ge 1$ (i.e., for $k \\le -1$):\n$z_m = -i \\frac{W\\left(\\left(4m-1\\right)\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)}{\\left(4m-1\\right)\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$\n\n### Case 3: General Complex Solutions ($x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0$)\nWhile a full explicit characterization of these solutions is complex, studies of this equation have shown that the real and purely imaginary solutions are the only solutions. Proving this requires advanced complex analysis techniques, demonstrating that if $z$ is a solution, then either its real part $x$ or its imaginary part $y$ must be zero.\n\nThe complete set of solutions for the equation $z \\cdot i=i^z$ is:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions given by:\n    $z_m = -i \\frac{W((4m-1)\\pi/2)}{(4m-1)\\pi/2}$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$, where $W$ is the Lambert W function.\n\n<<<The solutions for $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$ in the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_m = -i \\frac{W((4m-1)\\pi/2)}{(4m-1)\\pi/2}$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$, where $W$ is the Lambert W function.>>>"
