    "When a standard origami crane is folded and then unfolded, the crease lines on the square paper divide it into a number of distinct regions. Based on a careful analysis of the symmetrical crease pattern, the total number of regions is 56.\n\nTo determine this number, the crease pattern can be viewed as a 4x4 grid of smaller squares. By systematically counting the regions within each of these 16 smaller squares, the total is found to be 56. The count for each row of the grid is as follows:\n*   The top and bottom rows of the grid each contain 10 regions.\n*   The two middle rows of the grid each contain 18 regions.\n\nSumming these up (10 + 18 + 18 + 10) gives a final count of 56 regions.\n\n<<<56>>>"
