    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem, followed by an analysis of its memory usage.\n\n### The C Program\n\nThe most memory-efficient approach is to read the first string into a buffer and then read the second string one character at a time, comparing it on the fly. This avoids allocating memory to store the second string. The program guarantees case-insensitive comparison by converting characters to lowercase before they are compared.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is designed to be memory-efficient by not storing the second string.\n *\n * Input:\n * The first two lines each contain a string. The strings are guaranteed\n * to be of the same length, between 1 and 100 characters, and consist\n * of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n *\n * Output:\n * - \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n * - \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n * - \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n */\nint main() {\n    // A buffer to store the first string.\n    // The maximum length is 100, plus 1 for the null terminator.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // A variable to store a single character from the second string.\n    char c2;\n\n    // A loop counter.\n    int i;\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Iterate through the first string until its end (null terminator).\n    for (i = 0; s1[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        // Read a single character for the second string.\n        // The space in \" %c\" tells scanf to skip any whitespace (like newlines)\n        // before reading the character.\n        scanf(\" %c\", &c2);\n\n        // Compare the lowercase versions of the characters.\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit after finding the result.\n        }\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(c2)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit after finding the result.\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, all characters were equal.\n    // Since the strings are guaranteed to be the same length, they are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Analysis\n\nThe problem asks for `m`, the total memory in bytes used for variables in this program. This memory is typically allocated on the stack. Let's calculate the size of each variable declared in the `main` function, assuming a standard competitive programming environment where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n\n*   **`char s1[101];`**: This is a character array to hold the first string. It has 101 elements.\n    *   Memory = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n*   **`char c2;`**: This variable holds a single character from the second string.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n*   **`int i;`**: This is the loop counter variable.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables:\n\n`m = 101 bytes (for s1) + 1 byte (for c2) + 4 bytes (for i)`\n`m = 106` bytes\n\n<<<106>>>"
