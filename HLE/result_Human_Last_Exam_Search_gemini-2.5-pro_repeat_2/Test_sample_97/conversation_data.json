    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of Al(OH)₃ to form Al³⁺ and OH⁻ ions, and the reaction of Al³⁺ and OH⁻ to form the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻. The solubility, S, is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum species.\n\n1.  **Relevant Equilibria:**\n    The dissolution of aluminum hydroxide is represented by:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The solubility product constant is K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷.\n\n    The formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion is:\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The formation constant is K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹.\n\n    The autoionization of water also contributes to the hydroxide concentration:\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    The ion product for water is K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n\n2.  **Total Solubility:**\n    The total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum-containing species:\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n3.  **Charge Balance (Electroneutrality):**\n    For the solution to remain electrically neutral, the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges:\n    3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n4.  **Expressing Concentrations in Terms of [OH⁻]:**\n    Let x = [OH⁻]. We can express the concentration of each species in the charge balance equation as a function of x:\n    *   From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / x = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ / x\n    *   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / x³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷ / x³\n    *   To find [Al(OH)₄⁻], we can combine the K_sp and K_f expressions:\n        K_sp * K_f = ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]³) * ([Al(OH)₄⁻] / [Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻]\n        Let K_c = K_sp * K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴.\n        So, [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻] = 5.83 x 10⁴ * x\n\n5.  **Solving for [OH⁻]:**\n    Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n    3(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷ / x³) + (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ / x) = x + (5.83 x 10⁴ * x)\n\n    1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ / x³ + 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ / x = x(1 + 5.83 x 10⁴)\n\n    Multiply the entire equation by x³ to eliminate the denominators:\n    1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ + (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)x² = (58301)x⁴\n\n    Rearrange into a quadratic equation in terms of x²:\n    (58301)x⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)x² - 1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\n    Let Y = x². The equation becomes:\n    58301Y² - 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴Y - 1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\n    Using the quadratic formula, Y = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)] / 2a:\n    Y = [ -(-1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) ± √((-1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(58301)(-1.59 x 10⁻²⁶)) ] / (2 * 58301)\n    Y = [ 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ ± √(1.0 x 10⁻²⁸ + 3.706 x 10⁻²¹) ] / 116602\n    Y = [ 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.088 x 10⁻¹¹ ] / 116602\n\n    Since Y = x² must be positive, we take the positive root:\n    Y = (6.089 x 10⁻¹¹) / 116602 ≈ 5.222 x 10⁻¹⁶ M²\n    x = [OH⁻] = √Y ≈ 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n6.  **Calculating Species Concentrations and Solubility:**\n    Now we can calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species:\n    *   [Al³⁺] = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ M\n    *   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ M\n\n    The total solubility S is the sum of these concentrations:\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ M + 1.33 x 10⁻³ M\n    S = 0.000444 M + 0.00133 M = 0.001774 M\n\n    Rounding to two significant figures (based on the given constants):\n    S ≈ 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹>>>"
