    "To determine the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication of two Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrices, we first need to define the structure of an HSS matrix and count the number of submatrices it contains. The multiplication algorithm will then access the submatrices of the two input matrices.\n\n### HSS Tree Structure\n\nAn HSS matrix is represented using a binary tree structure. For a tree of depth 4, we can consider it to have levels 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\n*   **Levels:** The root is at level 0, and the leaves are at the deepest level, which is level 3.\n*   **Nodes per level:** The number of nodes at level `l` is `2^l`.\n    *   Level 0: `2^0 = 1` node (the root)\n    *   Level 1: `2^1 = 2` nodes\n    *   Level 2: `2^2 = 4` nodes\n    *   Level 3: `2^3 = 8` nodes (the leaves)\n*   **Node Type:** Nodes that are not leaves are non-leaf nodes.\n    *   **Non-leaf nodes:** Levels 0, 1, and 2 contain a total of `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` non-leaf nodes.\n    *   **Leaf nodes:** Level 3 contains 8 leaf nodes.\n\n### Submatrices in a Single HSS Representation\n\nThe HSS representation stores different types of matrices at different nodes of the tree:\n\n1.  **Leaf Nodes:** For each leaf node, a dense submatrix corresponding to a diagonal block of the original matrix is stored. This is often denoted as the `D` block. Since there are 8 leaf nodes, there are **8 `D` submatrices**.\n2.  **Non-leaf Nodes:** For each non-leaf node, a set of \"generator\" matrices is stored. These generators represent the low-rank properties of the off-diagonal blocks. A common and comprehensive model (used in libraries like STRUMPACK, which is based on the work of Xia, Chandrasekaran, Gu, and Li) stores four generator matrices for each non-leaf node: `U`, `V`, `R`, and `B`.\n    *   There are 7 non-leaf nodes.\n    *   Each stores 4 generator submatrices.\n    *   Total generator submatrices: `7 * 4 = 28`.\n\nCombining these, the total number of submatrices stored for a single HSS matrix of depth 4 is:\n`28 (generators) + 8 (diagonal blocks) = 36 submatrices`.\n\n### Matrix Multiplication (`C = A * B`)\n\nThe HSS matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm computes the HSS representation of the resulting matrix `C`. This is typically done with a series of recursive operations that traverse the tree, often in an \"upward pass\" followed by a \"downward pass\". To compute the 36 submatrices that define `C`, the algorithm requires the corresponding 36 submatrices from matrix `A` and the 36 submatrices from matrix `B`.\n\nThe computation at each node `i` in the tree for `C` involves the generator and diagonal blocks from the corresponding node `i` in the trees for `A` and `B`. Therefore, all the stored submatrices for both input matrices are accessed during the multiplication process.\n\nThe total number of accessed submatrices is the sum of the submatrices in matrix `A` and matrix `B`:\n`Total accessed submatrices = (Submatrices in A) + (Submatrices in B)`\n`Total accessed submatrices = 36 + 36 = 72`\n\n<<<72>>>"
