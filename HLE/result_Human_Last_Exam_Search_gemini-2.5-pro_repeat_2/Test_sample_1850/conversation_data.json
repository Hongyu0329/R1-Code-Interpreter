    "In John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost*, a number of historical and biblical figures who are venerated as saints in various Christian traditions are mentioned by name. These individuals are either characters who actively participate in the narrative or are figures from biblical history whose stories are recounted, primarily by the Archangel Michael in Books XI and XII.\n\nThe historical saints named in *Paradise Lost* include:\n\n*   **Adam and Eve:** The first man and woman are central characters in the poem. Both are considered saints in some Christian traditions, including the Eastern Orthodox Church and historically within the Catholic Church, with their feast day sometimes observed on December 24th.\n*   **Mary:** The mother of Jesus is referred to as \"blest Mary, second Eve,\" a direct mention of her name and theological significance.\n*   **Michael:** The archangel is a prominent character who leads God's army and reveals the future to Adam. He is widely venerated as a saint in Christianity.\n*   **Raphael:** This archangel is sent by God to warn Adam and Eve and is also a venerated saint.\n*   **Gabriel:** Another of the archangels who appears in the poem, Gabriel is a key figure in the Annunciation and is venerated as a saint.\n*   **Uriel:** This archangel, who guards the sun, is tricked by Satan. Uriel is also considered a saint in some traditions.\n\nIn the latter part of the epic, as Michael shows Adam the future of mankind, several other key biblical figures who are also considered saints are named:\n\n*   **Enoch:** Mentioned for his righteousness and being taken by God.\n*   **Noah:** The builder of the ark and savior of humanity from the Great Flood is a significant figure in Michael's narration.\n*   **Abraham:** The patriarch of the Israelite nation is mentioned by name as Michael explains the future covenant.\n*   **Moses:** The lawgiver who led the Israelites out of Egypt is also named in Michael's account of future events.\n*   **Joshua:** He is mentioned by his name as the one who will lead the Israelites into the promised land and is presented as a prefigurement of Jesus.\n*   **David:** The king of Israel is mentioned in the argument of Book XII.\n\nTherefore, a total of thirteen historical saints are mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n<<<13>>>"
