    "There have been 17 batting Triple Crown winners in the history of the American and National Leagues. However, with the recent inclusion of statistics from the Negro Leagues, the total number of Triple Crown winners recognized by MLB is now higher. Different sources provide slightly varied totals, with some stating there are 27 or 28 winners in total when including the Negro Leagues.\n\nA Triple Crown in batting is achieved when a player leads their league in three specific statistical categories in a single season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs).\n\nSome notable players to have won the Triple Crown include:\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** is the most recent player to achieve the feat, doing so in 2012 with the Detroit Tigers.\n*   **Ted Williams** won the Triple Crown twice, in 1942 and 1947.\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** also won it twice, in 1922 and 1925.\n*   **Oscar Charleston** holds the record with three Triple Crowns, all won in the Negro National League.\n*   **Josh Gibson** is another player who won the Triple Crown twice in the Negro Leagues.\n\nThe inclusion of Negro League players has added eight players to the official list of Major League batting Triple Crown winners. The total number of Triple Crowns is higher than the number of individual winners because four players have accomplished the feat more than once.\n\n<<<17>>>"
