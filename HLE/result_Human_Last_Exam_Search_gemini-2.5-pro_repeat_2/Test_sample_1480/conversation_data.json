    "In a fuzzy logic system, the process of determining the output involves several steps. The \"rule activation level,\" also known as the firing strength, is typically the result of evaluating the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of a fuzzy rule. This activation level is then combined with the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of the rule using a logical operation, which is where the t-norm comes into play. The question asks for the \"rule activation level ... using a t-norm operation\" on the given values, which implies it's asking for the outcome of this combination step.\n\nThe key values provided are:\n*   **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`**: This represents the firing strength of the antecedent for the k-th rule.\n*   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`**: This is the membership degree of the output variable `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j`.\n\nA **t-norm** is a function that models the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy values, which are real numbers in the interval. While the context is an interval type-3 fuzzy set, which is designed to handle very high levels of uncertainty, the operation between two crisp values like 0.7 and 0.9 still relies on fundamental t-norm definitions.\n\nSince the specific t-norm was not provided, the calculation can be performed using the two most common t-norms:\n\n1.  **Minimum (min) T-norm**: This is the most widely used t-norm. It takes the minimum of the two values.\n    *   `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n2.  **Product (prod) T-norm**: This t-norm multiplies the two values.\n    *   `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nWithout further specification, the **minimum t-norm** is the standard and most direct interpretation. Therefore, the resulting activation level from the t-norm operation is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
