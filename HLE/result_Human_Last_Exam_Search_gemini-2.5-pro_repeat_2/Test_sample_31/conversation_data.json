    "To solve a 3x3 Rubik's Cube using the CFOP method, the final step is the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL). This step orients the final layer pieces after the top face has been solved (Orient Last Layer, or OLL). There are 21 unique PLL cases, including the already solved state. Identifying which case you have requires observing the pattern of stickers on the side faces of the top layer.\n\nTo uniquely identify any of the 21 PLL cases, a solver must observe a minimum of **five** non-top-facing stickers. While looking at the six stickers on two adjacent faces (for example, the front and right faces) is a very common and reliable method for what is known as 2-sided recognition, it is possible to distinguish all cases with one fewer sticker.\n\nThe specific five stickers that allow for this minimal recognition are:\n*   The sticker on the front face of the front-left edge piece.\n*   The sticker on the front face of the front-right edge piece.\n*   The sticker on the right face of the right-front edge piece.\n*   The sticker on the right face of the right-back edge piece.\n*   The sticker on the back face of the back-left edge piece.\n\nThis specific combination of five edge stickers provides enough information to differentiate all possible permutations of the last layer's pieces, making it the minimum number required.\n\n<<<5>>>"
