    "The sound produced by human muscle twitches is of a very low frequency. Research indicates that the primary frequencies of the sound from a single muscle twitch are below 20 Hz, which is the lower limit of the typical human hearing range. In fact, the most significant frequencies are below 4 Hz, placing them in the infrasonic range.\n\nTo determine which animal might hear this, we must examine the hearing ranges of the animals listed:\n\n*   **A. Dog:** A dog's hearing range is typically between 40 Hz and 60,000 Hz. They cannot hear sounds as low as a muscle twitch.\n*   **B. Bat:** Bats are known for their high-frequency hearing, which they use for echolocation. Their hearing range generally starts around 1,000 Hz (1 kHz) and can extend up to 200,000 Hz (200 kHz). They are unable to hear the low frequencies of a muscle twitch.\n*   **C. Herring:** Some fish in the herring family are highly sensitive to low-frequency sounds. Studies have shown that their hearing can extend into the infrasonic range, with some capable of detecting sounds as low as 5 Hz. This makes them capable of perceiving the low-frequency sounds generated by muscle contractions.\n*   **D. Whale:** Certain species of whales, particularly baleen whales like the blue whale and fin whale, are adapted to hear very low-frequency sounds, with their hearing extending down to 7 Hz. This allows them to communicate over vast oceanic distances. They would also likely be able to detect the sound of a muscle twitch.\n*   **E. Human:** The standard range of human hearing is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Since the dominant frequencies of muscle twitches are below this range, humans cannot hear them.\n\nBoth herring and certain whales have the ability to hear in the infrasonic range where muscle twitch sounds occur. However, herring are specifically noted for their sensitivity to infrasound down to 5 Hz for detecting predators. Given that the primary frequencies of muscle twitches are below 4 Hz, the herring is a very strong candidate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
