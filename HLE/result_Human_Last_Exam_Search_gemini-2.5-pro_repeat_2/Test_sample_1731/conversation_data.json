    "I have gathered information about the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems. I understand their relationship and how they are used to describe the probabilities of rare events. Specifically, Sanov's theorem deals with the large deviation of an empirical measure from a true distribution, with the rate function being the relative entropy. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem is a special case of Sanov's theorem, focusing on the large deviation of the sample mean. Both are connected to statistical mechanics and the concept of entropy.\n\nHowever, I have not yet specifically researched the \"Bose case of the light quanta\" and how these theorems apply to it to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy. My next step will be to focus on this specific physical system and its statistical description.I have gathered significant information about the statistical mechanics of a photon gas, which is the \"Bose case of the light quanta\". Key characteristics are that photons are bosons following Bose-Einstein statistics, have zero chemical potential at thermodynamic equilibrium because their number is not conserved, and their equilibrium distribution is the black-body distribution. I have also found a pre-print article that directly discusses the application of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems to a Bose gas of photons to calculate entropies and rate functions, reproducing the results of Bose and Planck. This indicates that the framework of large deviation theory is applicable and can be used to derive the desired thermodynamic quantities.\n\nHowever, I need to synthesize this information to explicitly find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy. The search results provide the context and confirm the methodology, but I still need to carry out the derivation or find the explicit formulas derived from this specific theoretical framework. The next step will be to focus on finding these explicit derivations or final expressions.I have successfully gathered information and now have access to a key article, \"Large Deviation Theory for Bose Gas of Photons and Planck's Oscillators,\" which explicitly states that it uses the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems to derive the entropy and rate functions for a Bose gas of photons, reproducing the results of Bose and Planck. The article confirms that at thermodynamic equilibrium, the Boltzmann-Gibbs canonical entropy reaches its maximum value, while the Cramer-Chernoff large deviation function is minimized. It also outlines the use of Lagrange multipliers to handle the constraints of the total number of particles and energy.\n\nThe provided search results contain the necessary conceptual framework and point to the explicit calculations. I can now proceed to synthesize this information and formulate the final answer by combining the theoretical underpinnings of the large deviation theorems with the specific application to the Bose gas of photons as described in the search results. I have sufficient information to construct the answer without further searches.\n\nIn the framework of large deviation theory, the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a Bose gas of light quanta (photons) can be determined by applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a probabilistic foundation for understanding the emergence of macroscopic thermodynamic behavior from the statistical mechanics of individual particles.\n\n### Theoretical Framework\n\n**Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem relates the probability of observing an empirical distribution that deviates from the true underlying distribution to the relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the two distributions. For a system of a large number of particles, the probability of observing a macroscopic state corresponding to a particular empirical distribution is exponentially small in the number of particles, with the rate of decay given by the relative entropy. At equilibrium, the system will be found in the macrostate with the highest probability, which corresponds to the minimum relative entropy, or equivalently, the maximum entropy.\n\n**Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem is a special case of the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem and deals with the large deviations of the sample mean of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables from their expected value. The probability of such a deviation is also exponentially small, with a rate function determined by the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the cumulant generating function of the random variables. In the context of a photon gas, this can be applied to the distribution of energy.\n\n### Equilibrium State of a Photon Gas\n\nA photon gas in thermal equilibrium is described by Bose-Einstein statistics. A crucial characteristic of a photon gas in a cavity in thermal equilibrium with its walls is that the number of photons is not conserved; photons are continuously absorbed and emitted by the walls. This leads to a chemical potential of zero (μ = 0) at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\n### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nAccording to the principles of large deviation theory, the equilibrium state is the most probable state, which maximizes the entropy. The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem provides a way to calculate this entropy. For a Bose gas of photons, this approach reproduces the well-known formula for the entropy of black-body radiation. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Boltzmann-Gibbs canonical entropy reaches its maximum value.\n\nThe entropy (S) of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is given by:\n\n**S = (4/3) * b * V * T³**\n\nwhere 'b' is a constant related to the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (σ) by b = 4σ/c, and 'c' is the speed of light. This result can be derived by maximizing the statistical entropy under the given constraints, a procedure that is formally captured by the large deviation framework. The equilibrium state corresponds to the minimum of the large deviation rate function, which in turn corresponds to the maximum of the entropy.\n\n### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem can be applied to find the mean energy of the photon gas at equilibrium. This is achieved by considering the energy of the photons as random variables. At equilibrium, the Cramer-Chernoff large deviation function for the energy distribution attains its minimum value. This condition, along with the constraint of a fixed total number of particles and total energy (handled using Lagrange multipliers), allows for the determination of the mean energy.\n\nThe mean energy (E) of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\n**E = b * V * T⁴**\n\nThis expression for the mean energy is a direct consequence of Planck's law for black-body radiation, which itself can be derived within the framework of Bose-Einstein statistics and is consistent with the results obtained through large deviation theory.\n\nIn summary, the application of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems to the Bose case of light quanta leads to the well-established expressions for the equilibrium entropy and mean energy of a photon gas, demonstrating the power of large deviation theory in providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for statistical mechanics.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Entropy (S): S = (4/3) * b * V * T³\nEquilibrium Mean Energy (E): E = b * V * T⁴\nwhere 'b' is a constant related to the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, V is the volume, and T is the temperature.\n>>>"
