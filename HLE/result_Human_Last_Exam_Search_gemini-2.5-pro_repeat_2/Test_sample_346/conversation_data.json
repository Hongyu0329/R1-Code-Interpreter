    "An evaluation of the SKI combinator expression `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))` reveals it represents the Church numeral 54. The calculation of `log_2(54)` is as follows:\n\nFirst, the expression is broken down based on the rules of SKI combinator logic. The outermost combinator is `S`, and the expression has the form `S(A)(B)(C)`, which reduces according to the rule `Sxyz = xz(yz)`. In this specific case, `x` is the identity combinator `I`, so `S(I)(B)(C)` reduces to `I(C)(B(C))`, which simplifies to `C(B(C))`.\n\nThe components `B` and `C` are themselves complex combinator expressions:\n*   `C = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n*   `B = S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))))`\n\nThese can be simplified by recognizing known combinators:\n*   The successor combinator `succ` is `S(S(K(S))(K))`.\n*   The identity combinator `I` is equivalent to the Church numeral for 1 (`c_1`).\n*   The expression `S(I)(I)` is a known representation of the Church numeral for 2 (`c_2`).\n\nUsing these simplifications:\n*   `C` becomes `succ(c_2)`, which evaluates to the Church numeral for 3 (`c_3`).\n*   The term inside `B`, `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`, is `succ(c_1)`, which evaluates to `c_2`.\n*   Therefore, `B` simplifies to `S(I)(S(I)(K(c_2)))`.\n\nThe entire expression for the Church numeral `n` is `c_3(B(c_3))`. To evaluate this, we must first determine what the function `B` does when applied to `c_3`. The application of `B` to a function `f`, `B(f)`, reduces as follows:\n`B(f) = S(I)(S(I)(K(c_2)))(f) = f(f(K(c_2)(f))) = f(f(c_2))`\n\nSubstituting `c_3` for `f`, we get:\n`B(c_3) = c_3(c_3(c_2))`\n\nIn Church numeral arithmetic, function composition is equivalent to multiplication. Thus:\n*   `c_3(c_2)` is `c_{3*2} = c_6`.\n*   `c_3(c_6)` is `c_{3*6} = c_{18}`.\nSo, `B(c_3)` evaluates to `c_{18}`.\n\nFinally, we substitute this back into the expression for `n`:\n`n = c_3(B(c_3)) = c_3(c_{18}) = c_{3*18} = c_{54}`.\n\nThe Church integer `n` is 54. The problem asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n\n`log_2(54) = log_2(2 * 27) = log_2(2) + log_2(3^3)`\n`log_2(54) = 1 + 3 * log_2(3)`\n\nUsing the approximate value `log_2(3) â‰ˆ 1.58496`, the result is:\n`1 + 3 * 1.58496 = 1 + 4.75488 = 5.75488`\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, the value is approximately 5.755.\n\n<<<5.75488750216"
