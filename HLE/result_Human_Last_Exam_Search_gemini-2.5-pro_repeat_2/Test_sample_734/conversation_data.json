    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was Augustine of Hippo.\n\nAugustine (354-430 AD) developed a sophisticated framework to understand miracles and shifts in the natural order. He did not see miracles as violations of God's created order. Instead of describing a miracle as being \"contrary to nature\" (*contra naturam*), he famously argued that a \"portent happens not contrary to nature, but contrary to what we know as nature\" (*portentum ergo fit non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura*). This terminology allows for events that seem to break natural laws, like the virgin birth, by suggesting they operate according to a higher, hidden level of the natural order established by God, which is simply beyond human understanding.\n\nTo explain the mechanism behind this, Augustine utilized the concept of \"seminal reasons\" (*rationes seminales*). He posited that God embedded the latent potentialities for all things, including seemingly miraculous events, into the fabric of creation from the very beginning. A miracle, therefore, is not a divine afterthought or an intervention that breaks the rules, but the activation of a \"hidden cause\" or potentiality that has existed within nature all along. The virgin birth could thus be understood as the actualization of one of these pre-ordained potentialities.\n\nThis framework also applies to the alterations in natural laws at the Fall. Augustine wrote extensively on the \"corruption\" of human nature after the Fall. He developed specific terminology to describe this change in the 'law' of human will and ability. Before the Fall, humanity was *posse non peccare* (able not to sin). After the Fall, humanity's state became *non posse non peccare* (not able not to sin). This signifies a fundamental shift in the operating principles of human nature. Augustine believed this corruption extended to the physical world, citing the new pains of childbirth and the necessity of toiling for food as evidence of a change in the natural order as a consequence of sin.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
