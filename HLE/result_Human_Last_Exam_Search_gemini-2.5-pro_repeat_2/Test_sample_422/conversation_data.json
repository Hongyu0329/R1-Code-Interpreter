    "<<<Given that knowledge is defined as a Justified True Belief (JTB) and the only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, the two main problems the JTB definition encounters, excluding Gettier problems, are the Regress Problem of justification and the Threshold Problem.\n\n1.  **The Regress Problem (Agrippa's Trilemma)**: The JTB account requires a belief to be justified to count as knowledge. However, it does not explain how the chain of justification can be coherently completed. Any attempt to justify a belief (P) requires citing another justified belief (Q), which in turn needs justification from another belief (R), and so on. This leads to three problematic possibilities, known as Agrippa's Trilemma.\n    *   **Infinite Regress**: The chain of justifications goes on forever, which seems impossible for a finite mind to possess. Therefore, no belief could ever be fully justified.\n    *   **Dogmatic Assumption**: The chain ends with a \"basic\" belief that is asserted to be true without further justification. This is an arbitrary stop, as the JTB model itself does not define or defend the existence of such self-justifying beliefs.\n    *   **Circularity**: The chain of justification circles back on itself (e.g., P is justified by Q, which is justified by R, which is justified by P). This is a logical fallacy.\n\n    Because the JTB model requires justification but does not solve this trilemma, it fails to provide a complete account of how any belief can ever be fundamentally justified.\n\n2.  **The Threshold Problem**: The JTB definition treats justification as a binary conditionâ€”a belief is either justified or it is not. This creates a problem because justification intuitively seems to exist on a spectrum, from weak evidence to near certainty. The JTB model fails to specify *how much* or *what quality* of justification is sufficient to cross the threshold from a mere \"True Belief\" to \"Knowledge\".\n    *   If the bar is set too low, then beliefs based on flimsy evidence, lucky guesses, or superstitions that happen to be true could be counted as knowledge, which is counterintuitive.\n    *   If the bar is set too high, requiring absolute certainty, it could lead to skepticism, as very few beliefs could ever meet this standard.\n\n    This problem is intensified by the constraint that the only epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief.\" Without a clear threshold, there is no non-arbitrary way to decide if a weakly supported true belief should be elevated to the status of Knowledge or remain a simple Belief. The JTB model itself offers no guidance for drawing this crucial line.>>>"
