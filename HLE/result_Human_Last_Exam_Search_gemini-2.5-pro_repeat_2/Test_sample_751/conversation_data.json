    "### Calculation of the New C Matrix for Observer Canonical Form\n\nTo reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we follow a systematic, multi-step process. The core of this method lies in transforming the dual of the original system into controllable canonical form.\n\n**1. Original System Formulation:**\n\nThe discrete-time system is defined by the matrices:\n*   A = [,,]\n*   C = [,]\n\n**2. The Principle of Duality:**\n\nThe duality principle in control theory states that an observable system (A, C) has a dual system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ) which is controllable. Transforming this dual system into controllable canonical form and then taking the transpose of the resulting matrices will yield the observer canonical form of the original system.\n\nThe dual system is defined by A' and B':\n*   A' = Aᵀ = [,,]\n*   B' = Cᵀ = [,,]\n\n**3. Transformation to Controllable Canonical Form:**\n\nFor multi-input systems, the controllable canonical form is not unique and depends on the choice of basis vectors from the controllability matrix. A standard method is to choose a single input column from the B' matrix that renders the system controllable and then construct a transformation matrix.\n\nLet's select the first input column of B', denoted as b'₁ =ᵀ. The controllability of the pair (A', b'₁) is verified using the controllability matrix Q':\n*   Q' = [b'₁ | A'b'₁ | (A')²b'₁] = [,,]\n\nThe determinant of Q' is 2, which is non-zero, confirming that the pair (A', b'₁) is controllable. A similarity transformation matrix, P, can now be constructed to convert the dual system into controllable canonical form. The resulting transformed matrices for the dual system are (A'_c, B'_c).\n\n*   A'_c = P * A' * P⁻¹ = [,, [-2, 3, 2]]\n*   B'_c = P * B' = [[0.5, 0, -1], [0.5, 0, 0], [0.5, 1, 0]] * [,,]\n    B'_c = [[0, 0.5], [0, 0.5], [1, 1.5]]\n\n**4. Deriving the Observer Canonical Form:**\n\nBy the principle of duality, the matrices for the observer canonical form of the original system, A_o and C_o, are the transposes of the controllable canonical form matrices of the dual system.\n*   A_o = (A'_c)ᵀ\n*   C_o = (B'_c)ᵀ\n\nTherefore, the new matrix C, denoted as C_o, is:\nC_o = [[0, 0.5], [0, 0.5], [1, 1.5]]ᵀ\n\nThis results in:\n**C_o = [, [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]**\n\nThis matrix represents the new output matrix C in the observer canonical form.\n\n<<<[, [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]>>>"
