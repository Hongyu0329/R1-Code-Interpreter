    "Had the Norse never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the Modern English word for a female sibling would likely be **swester**, and possibly **suster**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" entered the English language around the mid-13th century. It comes from the Old Norse word *systir*. This new word largely replaced the native Old English term, *sweostor* (pronounced roughly as \"sweh-os-tor\"). There were several dialectal forms of the Old English word, including *swuster* and *swester*.\n\nWithout the influence of the Vikings, the original Old English word *sweostor* would have followed a natural course of linguistic development into Modern English. This evolution would have primarily involved the simplification of the \"eo\" vowel sound.\n\nHere is the likely linguistic path:\n\n*   **Old English (c. 450-1150):** The starting point is *sweostor*. In some dialects, like Northumbrian, the form *swester* was already in use. Another significant variant was *swuster*.\n\n*   **Middle English (c. 1150-1500):** During this period, Old English diphthongs (two-part vowel sounds) were typically simplified into monophthongs (single vowel sounds). The short \"eo\" in *sweostor* would have naturally smoothed into an \"e\" sound. This would have resulted in the word becoming *swester*. The alternative Old English form, *swuster*, evolved into *suster*, a form that was also common in Middle English.\n\n*   **Modern English (c. 1500-present):** From Middle English, the word *swester* would likely have remained. The vowel sound /e/ and the surrounding consonants are relatively stable and would not have been significantly altered by major sound changes like the Great Vowel Shift in this context. The word would be pronounced to rhyme with \"jester\" or \"Leicester\". The alternative, *suster*, would have likely seen its \"u\" vowel shift to the sound in \"but\" or \"cup,\" rhyming with \"duster.\"\n\nGiven that *swester* was a known variant and a direct phonological evolution from the standard Old English *sweostor*, it stands as the most probable modern equivalent. This is further supported by its close relationship to words in other West Germanic languages which did not experience the same Norse influence, such as the German *Schwester* and the Dutch *zuster*.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
