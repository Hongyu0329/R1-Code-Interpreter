    "The Stone-Cech remainder of a locally compact, non-compact space is a compact Hausdorff space. For a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$, the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact, non-compact, and Ïƒ-compact metric space. Its Stone-Cech remainder, which we denote as $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$, is a non-metrizable continuum.\n\nIt is a known result in topology that this remainder, $R$, is an indecomposable continuum. A crucial point is that while every metric indecomposable continuum has a number of composants equal to the cardinality of the continuum ($c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$), this does not hold for non-metric continua.\n\nThe problem of the number of composants for non-metric indecomposable continua was famously addressed by D. P. Bellamy. In his work, he demonstrated the existence of non-metric indecomposable continua with a small, finite number of composants. Specifically, Bellamy proved that there exist compact Hausdorff indecomposable continua with exactly one and exactly two composants.\n\nHis constructions, which often involve inverse limits of metric indecomposable continua, are applicable to the structure of Stone-Cech remainders like the one in question. Bellamy showed how to construct an indecomposable continuum with two composants. From this, an indecomposable continuum with a single composant can be created by identifying a point from each of the two composants.\n\nThese results show that it is possible for the Stone-Cech remainder in the prompt to have one or two composants. As the question asks for the maximum possible number, and a construction for a two-composant continuum of this type exists, the maximum possible number is two.\n\n<<<2>>>"
