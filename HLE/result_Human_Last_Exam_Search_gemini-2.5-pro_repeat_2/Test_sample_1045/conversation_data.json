    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to sum the number of functions for each atom in the molecule.\n\nHere is the breakdown for each type of atom:\n\n*   **Carbon (C)**: In the 6-31G basis set, each carbon atom has:\n    *   One core orbital (1s) represented by a single contracted function.\n    *   Valence orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) that are split into two sets of functions (a split-valence basis set). This means there is one contracted function for the inner part of the valence shell (s and p) and another for the outer part. This results in 4 functions for the inner valence and 4 for the outer valence.\n    *   In total, each carbon atom uses 1 (for the 1s core) + 4 (for the 2sp inner valence) + 4 (for the 2sp outer valence) = 9 contracted basis functions.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: In the 6-31G basis set, each hydrogen atom has:\n    *   Only a valence 1s orbital, which is split into two basis functions.\n    *   In total, each hydrogen atom uses 2 contracted basis functions.\n\nToluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it contains 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as follows:\n*   **From Carbon atoms**: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **From Hydrogen atoms**: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total**: 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\nTherefore, a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene uses 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
