    "### Brain Regions Posterior to the Palliovisceral Lobe in Dwarf Cuttlefish Identified\n\nIn the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the primary brain structures situated immediately posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**. The entire brain is then encased posteriorly by a protective layer of **cranial cartilage**.\n\nThe dwarf cuttlefish brain is a complex, multi-lobed structure organized around the esophagus. The palliovisceral lobe is a key component of the posterior subesophageal mass, a region that also houses the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes. The palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in controlling escape responses, such as inking, which are executed by the funnel.\n\nDetailed 3D models from the *Sepia bandensis* brain atlas, accessible through Cuttlebase.org, provide a clear anatomical view of these structures. A posterior view of the brain model explicitly shows the palliovisceral lobe, with the posterior chromatophore lobes located dorsolaterally to it and the fin lobes situated ventrolaterally. These lobes work in concert to control various motor functions. The posterior chromatophore lobes, for instance, project motor neurons to the mantle skin, controlling the skin patterns and textures essential for camouflage. The fin lobes are responsible for innervating the muscles of the fins.\n\nUltimately, the most posterior boundary of the brain is the cranial cartilage, which encases the entire posterior aspect of the brain, providing it with rigid protection."
