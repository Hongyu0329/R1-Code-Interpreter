    "Let $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. We are looking for the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ has a non-empty intersection with $A$.\n\nLet $H$ be any cyclic subgroup of $G$. By the definition of a subgroup, $H$ must contain the identity element of $G$. In this case, the group operation is addition, and the identity element is $\\mathbf{0} = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$.\n\nSo, for any cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, it is true that $\\mathbf{0} \\in H$.\n\nNow, let's consider the set $A = \\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$. This is a subset of $G$ with size 1.\nLet's check if this set $A$ satisfies the given condition. The condition is that for every cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, the intersection $H \\cap A$ must be non-empty.\n\nFor any cyclic subgroup $H$, we have established that $\\mathbf{0} \\in H$.\nThe set $A$ we are testing is $\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$.\nThe intersection is $H \\cap A = H \\cap \\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$. Since $\\mathbf{0}$ is an element of $H$, the intersection is $\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$.\nThe set $\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$ is not empty. So, the condition $H \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$ is satisfied for every cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$.\n\nThis shows that the set $A = \\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$ of size 1 fulfills the requirement.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size of such a set $A$. Since $A$ must intersect any cyclic subgroup, it cannot be an empty set. Thus, the minimum possible size for $A$ is at least 1.\n\nSince we have found a set of size 1 that works, and the minimum size must be at least 1, the smallest possible size of $A$ is exactly 1.\n\nThe specific structure of the group $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$ does not alter this conclusion, as the reasoning relies only on the basic properties of subgroups. Any subgroup, cyclic or not, must contain the identity element.\n\n<<<1>>>"
