    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes using a phosphonium ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent). The reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane will result in an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane. The structure of this ylide is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄)-Cl, with the chloro group at the second position of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Reaction and Product Formation:**\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group (C=O) is exchanged with the substituted carbon group of the ylide. This forms a new carbon-carbon double bond at a fixed position.\n\nThe resulting product has the chemical structure (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-ClC₆H₄). The systematic IUPAC name for this compound is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Stereochemistry:**\nThe stereochemistry of the alkene (whether it is the E or Z isomer) is determined by the nature of the ylide.\n*   **Stabilized ylides**, which have electron-withdrawing groups, typically yield (E)-alkenes.\n*   **Non-stabilized ylides**, such as the one in this reaction (where the group attached to the P=C carbon is an alkyl-aryl group), generally lead to the formation of (Z)-alkenes as the major product. This is because the reaction proceeds under kinetic control.\n\nTherefore, the primary product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
