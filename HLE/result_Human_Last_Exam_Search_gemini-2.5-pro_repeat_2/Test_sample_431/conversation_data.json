    "Based on the annotation in the UniProt database for the human GABAAρ1 receptor (accession number P24046), the third transmembrane domain (TM3) is located at amino acid positions 314-334. The subsequent intracellular loop, which connects TM3 to the fourth transmembrane domain (TM4), spans from amino acid 335 to 349.\n\nThe amino acid sequence of this TM3-TM4 linker domain is: YAWAIADKYAKKRGG.\n\nAn analysis of this sequence shows that there are no Cysteine (C) residues present.\n\n<<<0>>>"
