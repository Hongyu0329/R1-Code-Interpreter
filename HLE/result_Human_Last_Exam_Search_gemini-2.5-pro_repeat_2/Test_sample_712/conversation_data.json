    "While there is no known bacterium that produces a chemical compound with intrinsic triboluminescent properties, research has identified bacteria that exhibit mechanically stimulated bioluminescence, a phenomenon that can be easily confused with triboluminescence. In these bacteria, the light is not produced by the fracturing of a crystal-like compound, but rather by a biochemical reaction (bioluminescence) that is triggered by mechanical stress.\n\nRecent research has highlighted that certain species within the genus ***Photobacterium*** display this fascinating characteristic. Specifically, studies on how luminous bacteria produce light in response to mechanical stress from their environment, such as fluid flow, have been a focus of ongoing research. While the exact commercial strain used in some of the most recent studies on fluid shear-induced light emission is not always explicitly named in preliminary reports, the broader body of research into bacterial bioluminescence points to the genus *Photobacterium* and the closely related *Vibrio* (now reclassified in some cases to *Aliivibrio*).\n\nFor instance, one project description mentions studying \"how luminous bacteria produce light as a response to mechanical stress from hydrodynamic conditions they find in the ocean\". Another project focuses on \"The flash dynamics of bioluminescent biofilms under flow\". These studies build on a long history of research into bioluminescent bacteria where mechanical stimulation is a known trigger for light emission. Organisms within the genus *Photobacterium* are well-documented for their bioluminescence, which is the result of a chemical reaction involving the luciferase enzyme. It is this biochemical process that can be stimulated by mechanical forces.\n\nTherefore, while the term \"triboluminescence\" is not technically correct in this context, the genus of bacterium that produces light in response to mechanical stimuli is *Photobacterium*.\n\n<<<*Photobacterium*>>>"
