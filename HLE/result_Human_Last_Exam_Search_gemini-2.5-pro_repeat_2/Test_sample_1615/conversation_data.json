    "A proper vertex coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to its vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The minimum number of colors required for such a coloring is known as the chromatic number of the graph, denoted by $\\chi(G)$.\n\nFor a complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex, each vertex requires a unique color. Therefore, the chromatic number of a complete graph with $n$ vertices is $n$. In this case, for a complete graph with 12345 vertices, 12345 colors would be needed.\n\nThe problem, however, specifies that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This means there is at least one pair of vertices in $G$ that are not connected by an edge. Let the number of vertices be $n = 12345$.\n\nIf a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is not a complete graph, its chromatic number is at most $n-1$. This can be demonstrated by considering two vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not adjacent. These two vertices can be assigned the same color. This reduces the number of colors required by at least one compared to a complete graph. A formal argument is that one can contract the non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ into a single new vertex, resulting in a new graph with $n-1$ vertices. This new graph can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors. This coloring can then be extended back to the original graph $G$, where $u$ and $v$ share the color of the contracted vertex, showing that $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of colors needed, we must check if this upper bound of $n-1$ can be achieved. Consider a graph constructed by taking a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$, and adding a single isolated vertex. This graph has $n$ vertices and is not complete. Its chromatic number is $n-1$.\n\nAnother example of a graph that achieves this bound is a complete graph with one edge removed, denoted as $K_n - e$. Let $n = 12345$. If we remove a single edge from $K_{12345}$, the resulting graph contains a clique of size $12344$ (a subgraph that is a complete graph on 12344 vertices). A clique of this size requires 12344 colors for a proper coloring. Therefore, the chromatic number of this graph must be at least 12344. Since we have already established that the chromatic number cannot exceed $n-1=12344$, the chromatic number for this specific graph is exactly 12344.\n\nGiven that a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph can have a chromatic number of 12344, and no such graph can have a chromatic number greater than 12344, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
