    "The symmetry group of the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C₁ in Schoenflies notation. This is based on the data provided by Eckard Specht in his comprehensive collection of \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\".\n\nIn this collection, for a packing of 1135 circles, the field for the symmetry group is left empty. According to the legend provided on the website, if the symmetry group field is empty, the packing possesses C₁ symmetry. C₁ symmetry, also known as no symmetry, indicates that the arrangement is asymmetric.\n\n<<<C₁>>>"
