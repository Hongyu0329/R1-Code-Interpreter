    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\cdot 3^2) \\times (7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13)$.\nSo, $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### 2. Decomposition of the Dirichlet Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is *primitive* if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet $\\chi$ be a primitive character of conductor $N$. Then,\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$,\nwhere:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2 = 4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2 = 9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\n### 3. Order of the Character\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5)) = 6$.\n\nThis implies that the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n\n### 4. Counting Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power Factor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor $p^k$ in $N$, whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of Dirichlet characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_1$: 1 (of order 2).\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(3)=2$. The possible orders for primitive characters are therefore 3 and 6. Both 3 and 6 are divisors of 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_2$: $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**: The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if it is not the principal character (whose order is 1). The possible orders are the divisors of $\\phi(7)=6$ that are greater than 1, which are 2, 3, and 6. All these orders divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_3$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**: The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The possible orders of primitive characters are divisors of 10 greater than 1, i.e., 2, 5, and 10. For the order of $\\chi_4$ to divide 6, it must be 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (of order 2).\n\n*   **Modulo 13**: The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The possible orders of primitive characters are divisors of 12 greater than 1, i.e., 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. For the order of $\\chi_5$ to divide 6, it can be 2, 3, or 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_5$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### 5. Combining the Choices\nLet the orders of the chosen characters be $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5)$. Based on our analysis:\n*   $o_1 = 2$\n*   $o_2 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_3 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_4 = 2$\n*   $o_5 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nWe must verify that for any combination of these choices, the lcm is exactly 6.\n1.  All possible orders $(o_1, \\dots, o_5)$ are divisors of 6. Therefore, their lcm must also divide 6.\n2.  The order of $\\chi_1$ is 2, so the lcm is always a multiple of 2.\n3.  The order of $\\chi_2$ is either 3 or 6, which means it is always a multiple of 3. Thus, the lcm is always a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6.\nA number that is both a divisor of 6 and a multiple of 6 must be 6.\nTherefore, any combination of the characters we have counted will result in a final character of order 6.\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component character:\nTotal Number = (Choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_5$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n"
