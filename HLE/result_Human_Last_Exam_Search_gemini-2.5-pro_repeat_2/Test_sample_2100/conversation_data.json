    "The man described is Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. His story was popularized by Andrei Voznesensky's poem \"Avos\" and the subsequent rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n\nRezanov was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer who was one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. In 1806, during a journey to California to secure provisions for Russian colonies in Alaska, he met and fell in love with Concepción Argüello (Conchita), the 15-year-old daughter of the commandant of San Francisco.\n\nAfter becoming engaged, Rezanov began the long journey back to St. Petersburg to seek the Tsar's permission to marry a Catholic. However, he fell ill along the way and died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in March 1807. He was buried at the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral.\n\nThe cathedral was destroyed in the 1960s, and his grave was lost. The question posed by Voznesensky in his work, wondering about the location of the grave, became a literal one. In the late 20th century, efforts by local historians led to the discovery of his presumed burial site, and a monument was eventually erected in Krasnoyarsk to honor him.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
