    "The linear algebraic rank of a country's flag, when viewed as a matrix, can be determined by its geometric design. The prompt specifies that the values in each matrix should be chosen to maximize the rank. This implies that the rank is not reduced by any coincidental linear dependence between the numerical values assigned to different colors. Therefore, the rank is determined by the number of linearly independent row or column patterns in the flag's design.\n\nFirst, we must determine the rank of the flag of Denmark. The Danish flag consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. This design creates two distinct types of rows: rows that are entirely white (part of the horizontal bar of the cross) and rows that are red with a white section (part of the background and the vertical bar of the cross). Similarly, there are two distinct types of columns. With two linearly independent row/column patterns, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\nThe task is to find which flags of African nations also have a rank of 2. This involves analyzing the design of each flag:\n*   **Rank 1 flags** have designs where all rows or all columns are simple multiples of each other. This includes flags with only horizontal stripes (all columns are identical) or only vertical stripes (all rows are identical). Examples include the flags of Chad, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, and Nigeria.\n*   **Rank 2 flags** have designs that create exactly two types of linearly independent rows or columns. Common patterns include:\n    *   A solid field with a simple, centered emblem (e.g., Morocco, Somalia, Tunisia).\n    *   A field of horizontal or vertical stripes with a simple, centered emblem (e.g., Ghana, Egypt, Cameroon).\n    *   A canton design, where one corner is distinct from the rest of the flag (e.g., Liberia, Togo).\n    *   A design with a triangle at the hoist on a simple background (e.g., Sudan, Djibouti).\n    *   A field divided into a vertical band and a set of horizontal bands (e.g., Benin, Madagascar).\n*   **Rank 3 or higher flags** have more complex designs, such as diagonal divisions, multiple complex emblems, or combinations of geometric shapes that result in three or more distinct row or column patterns (e.g., South Africa, Eritrea, Namibia).\n\nBased on this methodology, the following African nations have flags with a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark:\n\n*   **Algeria**: A vertical bicolor field with a central emblem creates two distinct row types.\n*   **Benin**: A vertical band at the hoist next to two horizontal bands creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Burkina Faso**: A horizontal bicolor field with a central star creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Cameroon**: A vertical tricolor field with a central star creates two distinct row types.\n*   **Djibouti**: A horizontal bicolor field with a triangle at the hoist creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Egypt**: A horizontal tricolor with a central emblem creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Eswatini**: A field of horizontal stripes with a large central shield creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Ethiopia**: A horizontal tricolor with a central emblem creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Ghana**: A horizontal tricolor with a central star creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Kenya**: A horizontal tricolor with a large central shield and spears creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Lesotho**: A horizontal tricolor with a central emblem creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Liberia**: A field of stripes with a canton (a distinct square in the corner) creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Libya**: A horizontal tricolor with a central emblem creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Madagascar**: A vertical band at the hoist next to two horizontal bands creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Malawi**: A horizontal tricolor with an emblem in the top stripe creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Morocco**: A solid red field with a central pentagram creates two distinct row types.\n*   **Niger**: A horizontal tricolor with a central roundel creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Rwanda**: A field of horizontal stripes with an emblem in the corner creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Senegal**: A vertical tricolor with a central star creates two distinct row types.\n*   **Somalia**: A solid blue field with a central star creates two distinct row types.\n*   **Sudan**: A horizontal tricolor with a triangle at the hoist creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Togo**: A field of horizontal stripes with a canton creates two distinct column types.\n*   **Tunisia**: A solid red field with a central disk containing an emblem creates two distinct row types.\n*   **Uganda**: A field of horizontal stripes with a central disk and emblem creates two distinct column types.\n\n<<<Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Djibouti, Egypt, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda.>>>"
