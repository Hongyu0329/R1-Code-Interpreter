The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid cannot be definitively determined by length, as most are mythological and have no specified size. The longest verifiable river is the **Tiber** (406 km). The other prominent rivers, the **Acheron**, **Styx**, **Phlegethon**, **Cocytus**, and **Lethe**, are primarily features of the underworld and their lengths are not given in the epic.
