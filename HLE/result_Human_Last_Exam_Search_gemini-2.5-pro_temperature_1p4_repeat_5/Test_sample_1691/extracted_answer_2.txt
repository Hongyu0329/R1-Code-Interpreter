The analytical formula that approximates the integral for the small $\epsilon$ regime is given by:

$I(\epsilon) \approx \frac{\pi}{5 \cdot 9^{1/5} \sin(\pi/5)} \epsilon^{-4/5}$

This can also be written as:

$I(\epsilon) \approx C \cdot \epsilon^{-0.8}$

where the constant $C$ is $C = \frac{\pi}{5 \cdot 9^{1/5} \sin(\pi/5)}$.
