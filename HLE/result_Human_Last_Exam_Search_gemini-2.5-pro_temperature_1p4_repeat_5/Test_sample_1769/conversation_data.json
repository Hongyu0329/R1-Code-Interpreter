    "Had the Norse never introduced their word `systir`, the Modern English word for a female sibling would have evolved from the native Old English term `sweostor`. Based on the natural phonological development of English, the word would likely be **Suster**.\n\nHere is the linguistic path from Old English to the hypothetical modern word:\n\n1.  **Old English**: The word used by Anglo-Saxons was `sweostor`, with dialectal variations like `swuster` and `soester`. It was a common Germanic word, as evidenced by cognates like Old High German `swëster`.\n\n2.  **Middle English**: As Old English transitioned into Middle English, `sweostor` simplified. The most common non-Norse-influenced form found in Middle English texts is `suster`. This change involved the common loss of the initial `w` sound after an `s` and the transformation of the `eo` vowel sound to a `u`.\n\n3.  **Modern English**: The final step involves the evolution from Middle English `suster` to a modern form. The first vowel in `suster` was a short `u`, pronounced like the \"oo\" in \"foot\". In the development towards Modern English, this sound typically changed to the /ʌ/ vowel, the sound in words like \"cup\" or \"dull\". The unstressed \"-er\" ending would have likely remained, just as it did for \"mother\" and \"brother\".\n\nTherefore, the un-Vikingized word for \"sister\" would be `Suster`, rhyming with \"duster\" or \"muster\". This developmental path is supported by the existence of close relatives in other Germanic languages that were not subject to the same Norse influence, such as the Dutch `zuster` and the German `Schwester`.\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
