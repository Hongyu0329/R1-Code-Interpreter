    "To determine the probability that the particle in a 1D box is located in an interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the n=2 state, one must calculate the integral of the probability density function over this interval.\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box is:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)\n\nFor the n=2 state, this becomes:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)\n\nThe probability density, |ψ₂(x)|², is:\nP(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is given by the integral:\nP = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx\n\nFor the n=2 state, the probability density is zero at the center of the box (x = 0.5a). Since the requested interval is a very small region centered around this node, we expect the probability to be very low.\n\nDue to the small size of the interval (Δx = 0.01a), we can approximate the integral. By using a Taylor expansion of the probability density function around the node at x = 0.5a, the calculation yields a more accurate result than simply multiplying the value at the midpoint (which is zero) by the interval width.\n\nThe calculation based on this approximation is:\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\nP ≈ 0.00000658\n\nThus, the probability is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
