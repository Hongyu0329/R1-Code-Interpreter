    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nThrough calculation, we determine that $53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nLet the prime factors be $p_1=7$, $p_2=13$, $p_3=19$, and $p_4=31$. Since $d$ is a product of distinct primes (i.e., it is square-free), this simplifies the problem.\n\n### 2. Properties of Primitive Dirichlet Characters for a Square-Free Conductor\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free integer $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$\nFor such a square-free conductor $d$, the character $\\chi$ is *primitive* if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is non-principal. The principal character is the one of order 1. Therefore, for $\\chi$ to be primitive, the order of each $\\chi_i$, denoted $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be greater than 1 ($o_i > 1$).\n\n### 3. Condition on the Order of the Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$\nThe problem requires this order to be 6.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that:\n1.  For each $i$, $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$ with order $o_i > 1$.\n2.  $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\n\n### 4. Counting the Characters\nFor a prime modulus $p$, the group of Dirichlet characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of a specific order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $\\phi(p)$.\n\nLet's check the values of $\\phi(p_i)$ for our primes:\n*   $\\phi(7) = 6$\n*   $\\phi(13) = 12$\n*   $\\phi(19) = 18$\n*   $\\phi(31) = 30$\n\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)=6$ implies that each order $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Since we also require $o_i > 1$, the possible orders for each component character are $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nAll these possible orders (2, 3, and 6) divide each of $\\phi(7)$, $\\phi(13)$, $\\phi(19)$, and $\\phi(31)$.\n\nFor each prime factor $p_i$, we can calculate the number of available characters for each required order:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 2$.\n\nFor each of the four prime moduli, the number of non-principal characters whose order divides 6 is the sum of the counts for orders 2, 3, and 6, which is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### 5. Applying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\nLet $S_i$ be the set of non-principal characters modulo $p_i$ whose order divides 6. We have $|S_i| = 5$ for each $i$. We are forming a 4-tuple of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ with each $\\chi_i \\in S_i$. The total number of such tuples is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we must enforce the condition that $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$. This means the set of orders must contain a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3. We use complementary counting by subtracting the cases where this condition fails:\n\n*   **Case 1: The lcm has no factor of 3.**\n    This occurs if all orders $o_i$ are 2 (since orders must be in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$). For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. Thus, there is $1^4 = 1$ tuple of characters where all have order 2. The lcm in this case is 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: The lcm has no factor of 2.**\n    This occurs if all orders $o_i$ are 3. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. Thus, there are $2^4 = 16$ tuples of characters where all have order 3. The lcm in this case is 3.\n\nThese two cases are disjoint. Therefore, the number of tuples that do not satisfy the lcm condition is $1 + 16 = 17$.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is the total number of tuples minus those that do not satisfy the lcm condition:\n$625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
