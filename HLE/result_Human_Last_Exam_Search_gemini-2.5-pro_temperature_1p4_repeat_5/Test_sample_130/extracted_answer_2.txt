As the local median operator is repeatedly applied to a binary black and white image, the edges of the image will evolve to minimize their curvature. This means that sharp corners will become rounded, and any small or thin features along the edges will be eliminated. The overall shapes will become smoother and less complex, eventually converging to a "fixed point" image where no further changes occur. Straight or gently curving edges, however, will be largely preserved.
