    "### Radon Identified as Earth's Rarest Noble Gas in 2002\n\nIn 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was radon (Rn). Its extreme scarcity is a result of its radioactive nature and short half-life. While all noble gases are present in trace amounts, radon's fleeting existence ensures its concentrations are many orders of magnitude lower than even the next rarest noble gas, xenon.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Earth's noble gases are found in the atmosphere. Therefore, the atmospheric concentration is the primary determinant of the overall abundance of these elements in terrestrial matter. The continuous decay of radium, itself a decay product of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust, produces radon. However, the most stable isotope of radon, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days, which prevents it from accumulating in any significant quantity.\n\nEstimates of radon's concentration in the atmosphere are exceptionally low, on the order of 1 part per quadrillion (1 x 10<sup>-15</sup> ppm) by volume. The total amount of radon in the entire atmosphere at any given moment is estimated to be only a few tens of grams.\n\nFor comparison, the atmospheric concentrations of other noble gases are vastly higher:\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Approximately 0.09 parts per million (ppm)\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Approximately 1.1 ppm\n*   **Helium (He):** Approximately 5.2 ppm\n*   **Neon (Ne):** Approximately 18.2 ppm\n*   **Argon (Ar):** Approximately 9340 ppm\n\nThe concentrations of noble gases in the Earth's crust and mantle are significantly lower than in the atmosphere, making the atmospheric inventory the dominant factor for their total terrestrial abundance. Given radon's minuscule presence in the atmosphere, and by extension its negligible percentage of the Earth's total mass, it was unequivocally the rarest noble gas in 2002. Calculating its precise percentage of all terrestrial matter results in a number approaching zero, far below that of xenon, the rarest stable noble gas.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
