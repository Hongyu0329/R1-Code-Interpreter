    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor**, often denoted as S(k, ω). It is also referred to as the **scattering law**.\n\nIn the context of neutron scattering and transport, the generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a particle at position **r** at time **t**, given that there was a particle at the origin at time t=0. The double Fourier transform translates this function from real space and time to momentum (or wavevector **k**) and energy (or frequency ω) space.\n\nThis relationship is fundamental in neutron scattering analysis, as the measured double differential scattering cross-section is directly proportional to the dynamic structure factor. Within the nuclear criticality community, while specific methods like the Rossi-alpha and Feynman-alpha experiments are employed to analyze neutron fluctuations and correlations to determine reactor parameters, the underlying theoretical quantity of the transformed pair correlation function is the dynamic structure factor. The dynamic structure factor provides a complete description of the second-order statistics of the neutron population in both space and time.\n\n<<<The dynamic structure factor (or scattering law).>>>"
