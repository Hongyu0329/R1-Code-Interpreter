    "On a standard 8x8 chessboard, the edges are comprised of the squares along the first and eighth ranks, as well as the 'a' and 'h' files. The total number of these edge squares is 28.\n\nThe game's objective is to place the maximum number of bishops on these 28 edge squares so that no two bishops attack each other. Bishops attack along diagonals of the same color. Therefore, the problem can be split into placing bishops on the 14 white edge squares and the 14 black edge squares independently.\n\nThrough analysis of the diagonal attacks, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is 14. For a standard 8x8 board, the general formula for the maximum number of non-attacking bishops is 2n-2, which equals 14. It has been shown that for this maximum number to be reached, all bishops must be placed on the edge squares.\n\nWith the maximum of 14 bishops successfully placed on the edge of the board, the number of edge squares that would lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the number of bishops placed.\n\nNumber of empty edge squares = 28 (total edge squares) - 14 (bishops) = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
