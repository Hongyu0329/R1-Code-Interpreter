In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` within the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the expression:

**(ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>D-1</sup>x ϕ(x) [-∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>] ϕ(x)**

Here:
*   `ϕ(x)` is the neutral scalar field, a function of Euclidean spacetime coordinates `x = (τ, **x**)`.
*   `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature.
*   The integral is over imaginary time `τ` from 0 to `β` and all of spatial `d^{D-1}x`.
*   `∂_τ²` is the second partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.
*   `∇²` is the spatial Laplacian operator.
*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.

This expression corresponds to twice the value of the free part of the Euclidean action for a given field configuration `ϕ`.
