    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function Z for a neutral scalar field ϕ is expressed through a functional integral over all possible field configurations that are periodic in imaginary time with a period β = 1/T, where T is the temperature.\n\nThe partition function is given by:\n\nZ = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ])\n\nHere, Dϕ represents the functional measure, and S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] is the Euclidean action of the scalar field. The Euclidean action in a D-dimensional spacetime (typically D=4, with one dimension being the compactified imaginary time) is:\n\nS<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>D-1</sup>x [ ½ (∂<sub>μ</sub>ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + ½ m<sup>2</sup>ϕ<sup>2</sup> + V(ϕ) ]\n\nwhere τ is the imaginary time, m is the mass of the scalar field, and V(ϕ) represents the potential for self-interactions.\n\nThe quadratic part of the Lagrangian (the free theory part) can be rewritten using integration by parts. Assuming the fields vanish at the spatial boundary and are periodic in imaginary time, the action for the free field is:\n\nS<sub>E,free</sub>[ϕ] = ½ ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>D-1</sup>x ϕ(x) [-∂<sub>μ</sub>∂<sup>μ</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>] ϕ(x)\n\nIn this expression, -∂<sub>μ</sub>∂<sup>μ</sup> is the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator, which is equivalent to the Laplacian in Euclidean space: -∂<sub>μ</sub>∂<sup>μ</sup> = -∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe operator D (or D<sub>ϕ</sub> as written in the question) is the operator that appears in this quadratic form. Therefore, we can identify it as:\n\nD = -∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>\n\nThis is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.\n\nThe inner product notation `(f, g)` in this context refers to the integral of the product of the two functions over the Euclidean spacetime volume:\n\n(f, g) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>D-1</sup>x f(x)g(x)\n\nCombining these definitions, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is:\n\n(ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>D-1</sup>x ϕ(x) (Dϕ)(x)\n\nSubstituting the expression for the operator D, we get:\n\n**(ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>D-1</sup>x ϕ(x) [-∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>] ϕ(x)**\n\nIt is important to note that this expression is precisely twice the Euclidean action for a free neutral scalar field, `2 * S_E,free[ϕ]`. The term appears in the exponent of the integrand of the partition function, `exp(-½ (ϕ, D_ϕ) - ∫ V(ϕ))`.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` within the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the expression:\n\n**(ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>D-1</sup>x ϕ(x) [-∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>] ϕ(x)**\n\nHere:\n*   `ϕ(x)` is the neutral scalar field, a function of Euclidean spacetime coordinates `x = (τ, **x**)`.\n*   `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature.\n*   The integral is over imaginary time `τ` from 0 to `β` and all of spatial `d^{D-1}x`.\n*   `∂_τ²` is the second partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.\n*   `∇²` is the spatial Laplacian operator.\n*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.\n\nThis expression corresponds to twice the value of the free part of the Euclidean action for a given field configuration `ϕ`."
