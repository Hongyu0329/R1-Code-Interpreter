    "To solve this problem with maximum memory efficiency, we should avoid storing the entire input string, which can be up to 1000 characters long. Since the numbers in the sum are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can read the input character by character and simply count the occurrences of each number. This approach, known as Counting Sort, is highly efficient for data with a small range of values.\n\nAfter counting, we can construct and print the new sum by iterating through our counts, printing '1's, then '2's, and so on, separated by '+' signs. This method avoids allocating a large buffer for the input string and also avoids storing the numbers in an array for sorting.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program for this task:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) from the input,\n * sorts the numbers in non-decreasing order, and prints the new sum.\n * It is designed to be highly memory-efficient by not storing the\n * entire input string. Instead, it reads character by character and\n * uses a counting sort approach.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Array to store the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    // Index 0 for '1', 1 for '2', etc.\n    // Memory: 4 * sizeof(int)\n    int counts[4] = {0};\n\n    // Variable to read input character by character.\n    // It's an 'int' to correctly handle the EOF (End-of-File) value.\n    // Memory: sizeof(int)\n    int c;\n\n    // Read characters until a newline or EOF is encountered.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        // Increment the count for the corresponding number.\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Flag to handle the printing of the '+' separator.\n    // Memory: sizeof(int)\n    int is_first_term = 1;\n\n    // Loop through the counts (for numbers 1 to 4).\n    // Loop variable 'i' is declared here. Memory: sizeof(int)\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        // Loop to print each number the required number of times.\n        // Loop variable 'j' is declared here. Memory: sizeof(int)\n        for (int j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n            // If it's not the very first number, print a '+' before it.\n            if (!is_first_term) {\n                putchar('+');\n            }\n            // Print the number (i.e., '1', '2', '3', or '4').\n            putchar(i + '1');\n            // Unset the flag after the first number is printed.\n            is_first_term = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print a final newline character for clean output.\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory used is the sum of the memory allocated for the variables declared in the program. The size of these variables depends on the system architecture. Assuming a standard 32-bit system where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte:\n\n*   **`int counts[4]`**: An array of 4 integers. Memory = `4 * sizeof(int)` = 4 * 4 = 16 bytes.\n*   **`int c`**: A single integer variable to hold characters from `getchar()`, which returns an `int` to handle `EOF`. Memory = `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   **`int is_first_term`**: A single integer flag. Memory = `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   **`int i`**: Loop counter variable. Memory = `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   **`int j`**: Loop counter variable. Memory = `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n\nThe total memory (`m`) is the sum of these values.\n\nm = 16 (for `counts`) + 4 (for `c`) + 4 (for `is_first_term`) + 4 (for `i`) + 4 (for `j`)\n\n<<<32>>>"
