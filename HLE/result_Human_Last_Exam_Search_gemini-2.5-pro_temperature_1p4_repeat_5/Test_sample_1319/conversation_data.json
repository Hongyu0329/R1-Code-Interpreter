    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Ida**.\n\nSeveral mountains are mentioned in Homer's epic, playing significant roles as settings for divine intervention and mythological events. After excluding Mount Olympus, which is the highest mountain in Greece at 2,917 meters (9,570 feet) and the mythological home of the gods, a comparison of the other mentioned peaks reveals Mount Ida as the highest.\n\nThe mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* and their approximate elevations are:\n\n*   **Mount Ida:** Located in modern-day Turkey, south of Troy, its highest peak is Gargarus, which stands at approximately **1,770 meters (5,807 feet)**. Mount Ida is frequently referenced in the *Iliad* as a place from which the gods, particularly Zeus, would watch the events of the Trojan War unfold.\n*   **Mount Othrys:** Situated in central Greece, this mountain has a peak elevation of **1,726 meters (5,663 feet)**. In Greek mythology, it was the stronghold of the Titans during the Titanomachy.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (modern name: Fengari or Saos):** The peak of this island mountain, from which Poseidon is said to have observed the Trojan War, reaches about **1,700 meters (5,577 feet)**.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Located in Thessaly, Greece, and known in mythology as the home of the Centaurs, its highest point is around **1,651 meters (5,417 feet)**.\n\nAnother mountain mentioned is Mount Placus, located near the city of Thebe, but it is described as a foothill of the larger Mount Ida range and not as a major peak itself.\n\nTherefore, based on available elevation data, Mount Ida is the tallest of these historical mountains mentioned in the epic poem after Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Ida>>>"
