    "Using the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems, one can rigorously derive the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a system. For the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas), these theorems affirm that the equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state, and the probability of observing a state far from equilibrium is exponentially small for a large system.\n\n### Theoretical Framework\n\n**1. Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem and Equilibrium Entropy:**\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem provides a large deviation principle for the empirical distribution of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. In the context of statistical mechanics, it quantifies the probability of observing a particular macroscopic distribution of particles among various energy states. The theorem states that this probability decays exponentially with the number of particles, and the rate of decay is given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the observed distribution and the underlying distribution.\n\nFor a Bose gas, maximizing the probability of a macrostate is equivalent to minimizing this rate function. This minimization, subject to physical constraints like a fixed total energy, leads to the most probable distribution of particles, which is the Bose-Einstein distribution. The physical entropy, as defined by Boltzmann's formula (S = k log W), is directly related to the negative of this rate function. Therefore, finding the most probable state corresponds to maximizing the entropy.\n\nFor a gas of photons, which are bosons, the particles are indistinguishable, and any number of them can occupy a single energy state. A crucial characteristic of a photon gas is that the particle number is not conserved, which implies that the chemical potential is zero.\n\n**2. Cramer-Chernoff Theorem and Mean Energy:**\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem provides a large deviation principle for the empirical mean of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables. It can be applied to the total energy of the photon gas, which is the sum of the energies of individual photons. The theorem describes the exponential decay rate for the probability that the total energy deviates significantly from its expected value. The cumulant generating function used in this theorem is directly related to the partition function in statistical mechanics. The thermodynamic equilibrium condition for the mean energy is found by identifying the most probable value, which minimizes the large deviation rate function.\n\n### Equilibrium Values\n\nApplying these large deviation principles to a gas of photons in a volume *V* at a temperature *T* reproduces the celebrated results of Bose and Planck. The analysis leads to the following equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Distribution:** The average number of photons `<n(ε)>` in an energy state *ε* is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution with a chemical potential of zero:\n    \n    <n(ε)> = 1 / (e^(ε/k<sub>B</sub>T) - 1)\n\n    where *k<sub>B</sub>* is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Mean Energy (U):** The total mean energy of the photon gas is obtained by integrating the energy of photons over all possible states, weighted by the density of states. This results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the energy density. The total mean energy is:\n    \n    U = (8π⁵k<sub>B</sub>⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴\n    \n    where *h* is Planck's constant and *c* is the speed of light. The mean energy is proportional to T⁴.\n\n*   **Entropy (S):** The equilibrium entropy is derived from the mean energy and the thermodynamic relations. It is given by:\n    \n    S = (32π⁵k<sub>B</sub>⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³\n    \n    The entropy of the photon gas is proportional to T³.\n\n<<<\n**Mean Energy (U):**\nU = (8π⁵k<sub>B</sub>⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴\n\n**Entropy (S):**\nS = (32π⁵k<sub>B</sub>⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³\n>>>"
