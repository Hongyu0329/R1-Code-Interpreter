    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag. The rank is determined by the number of linearly independent row or column patterns in the flag's design.\n\nThe flag of Denmark, the Dannebrog, features a white Nordic cross on a red field. This design consists of two fundamental color patterns, creating two distinct types of rows (a row with only red, and a row with red and white) and two distinct types of columns. Therefore, the flag of Denmark has a linear algebraic rank of 2.\n\nWe now look for flags of African nations that also have a rank of 2. This includes flags with two-color patterns, such as bicolors, flags with an A-B-A stripe pattern, or flags with a simple emblem on a solid background. Based on these criteria, the following African flags share a rank of 2 with the flag of Denmark:\n\n*   **Algeria:** The Algerian flag is composed of two vertical bars of green and white, with a red star and crescent in the center. The fundamental design is a vertical bicolor, giving it two distinct column patterns and a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Benin:** This flag has a green vertical band at the hoist, with two horizontal bands of yellow and red. This arrangement, which can be represented by two independent rows or columns, has a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Djibouti:** The flag of Djibouti features two horizontal bands of light blue and green, with a white triangle at the hoist containing a red star. This composition of distinct color fields results in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Guinea-Bissau:** Similar in structure to Benin's flag, this flag has a vertical red band with a black star, and two horizontal bands of yellow and green. This design has a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Madagascar:** This flag consists of a vertical white band at the hoist, and two horizontal bands of red and green. Like Benin and Guinea-Bissau, this arrangement has a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Nigeria:** The Nigerian flag is a vertical triband of green, white, and green. This A-B-A pattern has two distinct column types ('green' and 'white'), resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Somalia:** The flag features a single white, five-pointed star on a light blue background. The two components—the blue field and the white star—create two distinct row patterns, giving it a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Tunisia:** Tunisia's flag has a red field with a central white disk containing a red crescent and star. The design is fundamentally a symbol on a plain background, resulting in two primary patterns (the red field and the white disk) and therefore a rank of 2.\n\n<<<The African nations whose flags have the same linear algebraic rank (2) as the flag of Denmark are Algeria, Benin, Djibouti, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Nigeria, Somalia, and Tunisia.>>>"
