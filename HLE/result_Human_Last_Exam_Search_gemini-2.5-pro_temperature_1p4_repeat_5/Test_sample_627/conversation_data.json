    "An application of Vogel's algorithm to a knot diagram produces a closed braid representation of the knot. The number of strands in this resulting braid serves as an upper bound for the knot's braid index. The braid index itself is the minimum number of strands required to represent the knot as a closed braid.\n\nFor the three-twist knot, also known as the 5₂ knot, Vogel's algorithm can be applied to its standard diagram. While the minimal braid index of the three-twist knot is 3, Vogel's algorithm does not always yield the minimal braid. In fact, for the 5₂ knot, the braid generated by the algorithm is on a higher number of strands.\n\nOne application of the Yamada-Vogel algorithm on the three-twist knot results in a braid word that utilizes four strands. A dissertation on the topic also illustrates the application of the Yamada-Vogel algorithm to the 5₂ knot, which results in a 4-strand braid. This means that the algorithm provides an upper bound of 4 for the braid index of the three-twist knot.\n\n<<<B>>>"
