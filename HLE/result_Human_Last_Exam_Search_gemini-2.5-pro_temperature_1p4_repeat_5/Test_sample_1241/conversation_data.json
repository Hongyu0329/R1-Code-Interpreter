    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. In the steady state, the probabilities are constant, so their derivatives with respect to time are zero. Let $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ for $i = 0, 1, 2, 3$.\n\nThe given system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_{0} + 0.65 P_{1}$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 P_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4)P_{1} + 0.392 P_{2} + 0.008 P_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 P_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008)P_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 P_{2} - 0.008 P_{3}$\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must equal 1:\n5.  $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\nWe can solve this system to find the values of $P_0$, $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 P_{2} = 0.008 P_{3} \\implies P_{2} = P_{3}$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 P_{1} = (0.392 + 0.008)P_{2} \\implies 0.4 P_{1} = 0.4 P_{2} \\implies P_{1} = P_{2}$\nTherefore, we have $P_{1} = P_{2} = P_{3}$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 P_{0} = 0.65 P_{1} \\implies P_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1}$\n\nNow, we substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) P_{1} = 1$\n\nTo find $P_1$, we can write:\n$P_{1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3} = \\frac{0.019}{0.65 + 3 \\cdot 0.019} = \\frac{0.019}{0.65 + 0.057} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nNow we can find $P_0$:\n$P_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\cdot \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nThe quantity we need to find is $P_{0} + P_{1}$:\n$P_{0} + P_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nCalculating the final value:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768$\n\nRounding to four decimal places, we get 0.9463.\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
