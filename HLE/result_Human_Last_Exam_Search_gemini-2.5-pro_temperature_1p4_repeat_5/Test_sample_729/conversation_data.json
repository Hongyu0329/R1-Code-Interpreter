    "A power subgroup is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. The generalized quaternion group of order 128, denoted as Q_128, is a non-abelian group with a specific structure. To find the number of its power subgroups, we can determine the number of its distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nA known formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in a generalized quaternion group Q_2^n of order 2^n is `c(Q_2^n) = 2^(n-2) + n`. For the generalized quaternion group of size 128, the order is 2^7, which means n=7 in this formula.\n\nApplying the formula:\nNumber of cyclic subgroups = 2^(7-2) + 7 = 2^5 + 7 = 32 + 7 = 39.\n\nTherefore, the generalized quaternion group of size 128 has 39 power subgroups. This can be broken down as follows:\n*   **A unique cyclic subgroup of order 64.** This subgroup contains within it one of each order that divides 64 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64), totaling 7 subgroups.\n*   **32 cyclic subgroups of order 4.** These are generated by the elements not in the aforementioned cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n\nAdding these together gives 7 + 32 = 39 distinct power subgroups.\n\n<<<39>>>"
