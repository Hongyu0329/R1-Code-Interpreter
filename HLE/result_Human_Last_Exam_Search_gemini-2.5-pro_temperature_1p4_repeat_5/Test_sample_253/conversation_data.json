    "To determine the binary pattern after applying Rule 110 twenty times starting from a single cell in state 1, a step-by-step simulation is performed. Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its own state and the states of its two immediate neighbors.\n\nThe rules that determine the next state of the center cell are as follows:\n\n| Current Pattern | New State |\n|:---------------:|:---------:|\n|       111       |     0     |\n|       110       |     1     |\n|       101       |     1     |\n|       100       |     0     |\n|       011       |     1     |\n|       010       |     1     |\n|       001       |     1     |\n|       000       |     0     |\n\nThis set of rules is also represented by the binary sequence 01101110, which is equivalent to the decimal number 110.\n\nStarting with a single '1' on a background of '0's (Generation 0), the automaton evolves through each generation. Due to the complexity of manually calculating 20 iterations, a computational approach is necessary to track the expanding pattern. The evolution produces a complex, seemingly chaotic pattern from a simple initial state, which is characteristic of Class 4 automata, a category to which Rule 110 belongs.\n\nAfter 20 applications of the rule, the resulting binary pattern is:\n**`1101110011110101`**\n\nThis pattern is flanked by zeros on both sides and represents the state of the cells at the 20th generation. The number of '1's in each generation follows a specific sequence, and by the 20th generation, there are 13 cells with the state '1'.\n\n<<<1101110011110101>>>"
