  "response_list": [
    "According to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) guidelines, an opened single-dose ampule must not be stored for any period of time. Once an ampule is opened, it cannot be resealed, and therefore, it should be used immediately and any remaining contents discarded. There is no beyond-use date (BUD) assigned to an opened ampule as storage is not permitted.\n\nWhile single-dose *vials* that are punctured in a sterile environment, such as an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial entry, this does not apply to ampules. The guidance for ampules is strict due to the high risk of microbial contamination once opened. Therefore, the BUD for a single-dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment is immediate use, with no storage allowed.\n\n<<<Immediate use only; no storage is permitted.>>>"
