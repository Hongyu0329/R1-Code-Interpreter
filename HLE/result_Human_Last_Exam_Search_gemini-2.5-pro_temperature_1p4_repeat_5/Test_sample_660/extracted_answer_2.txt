The sorting pattern where more truthful firms choose more lenient auditors occurs if and only if the condition $F(0) < t(0)$ is met. Given this condition, the firm with $\theta=1$ (the more truthful one) is indifferent but can be assumed to choose the lenient auditor, while the firm with $\theta=0$ will choose the strict auditor.
