    "A notable distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips. This difference reflects the broader stylistic goals of each ballet technique.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, a strong emphasis is placed on maintaining a stable and square pelvis. When executing a cambré derrière, the movement should originate from the upper and middle back, with the spine lengthening upwards before arching. The goal is to create a harmonious and controlled curve without displacing the hips or sinking into the lower back. This method prioritizes a feeling of lift and stability from the core, ensuring the lower body remains properly aligned. The head is often turned to the side to avoid straining the neck.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method often features more dynamic and angular movements, which can include a different use of the hips. While not always a literal \"hip jut\" in a simple cambré, the Balanchine style is known for its speed, off-balance positions, and a distinctive arabesque line where the hip is intentionally opened towards the audience. This use of the hip allows for a greater sense of dynamic energy and visual drama in the movement. Balanchine's choreography is characterized by quick transitions and changes of weight that often involve more freedom in the hip area compared to the strict squareness of the Vaganova technique. Balanchine was known to encourage dancers to push the limits of their backbends, asking them to \"lean more…bend more,\" which could involve a different pelvic alignment to achieve the desired look.\n\nWhile other elements like arm placement (with Balanchine sometimes favoring unconventional or asymmetrical lines) and the degree of the backbend can also differ, the fundamental approach to hip stability is a key differentiator. Vaganova builds the backbend on a solid, square foundation, while Balanchine allows for more dynamic and open hip placement to serve the choreographic aesthetic.\n\n<<<B>>>"
