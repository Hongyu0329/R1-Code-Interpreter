    "The ground space degeneracy of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. For a surface of genus *g* without boundaries, the degeneracy is 4^g. For a sphere, the genus is g=0, so without any holes, the ground state is non-degenerate (degeneracy of 1).\n\nWhen holes are introduced, they create boundaries, and the degeneracy changes. There are two types of boundaries for the toric code: smooth and rough. These different boundary conditions affect which type of anyonic excitation (electric 'e' or magnetic 'm') can terminate at the boundary.\n\nThe degeneracy of the ground state is related to the number of independent, non-trivial loop operators (logical operators) that can be defined on the surface. In a system with holes, these operators can correspond to strings that connect pairs of holes of the same type.\n\nSeveral sources suggest that each hole or puncture in the toric code effectively adds a logical qubit to the system, thus doubling the ground state degeneracy. This viewpoint is common when discussing the use of surface codes for quantum computation, where holes are intentionally created to encode and manipulate qubits.\n\nFollowing this interpretation, if we start with a sphere which has a ground state degeneracy of 1, and we introduce *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes, each of the total *n+m* holes contributes a factor of 2 to the degeneracy.\n\nTherefore, the total ground space degeneracy (GSD) would be:\nGSD = 1 * 2^n * 2^m = 2^(n+m).\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice A.\n\nWhile more detailed topological analyses can yield more complex, piecewise formulas for the degeneracy depending on the number of boundaries of each type (for instance, a degeneracy of 2^(n+m-2) when both n>0 and m>0), the answer choices provided are all single, non-piecewise expressions. The simplest and most direct interpretation that matches one of the provided options is that each hole, regardless of its type, contributes one logical qubit.\n\n<<<A>>>"
