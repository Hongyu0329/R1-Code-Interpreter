    "**The term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized step in the standard lexicon of ballet terminology.**\n\nWhile the phrase has gained some informal currency, particularly on social media platforms, to describe movements characteristic of choreographer George Balanchine's style, there is no universally accepted definition of what this \"step\" entails. Even the School of American Ballet, founded by Balanchine himself, has noted it is not a term used in their official training.\n\nWilliam Forsythe, the choreographer of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" was significantly influenced by Balanchine. His work is known for taking the classical ballet vocabulary and extending and accelerating it, creating a unique and dynamic style. The \"Jete Woman\" solo, performed by Svetlana Gileva in the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production, is a prime example of this complex and fast-paced choreography.\n\nDue to the lack of a formal definition for \"pas de Balanchine,\" it is impossible to objectively identify and count a specific, recurring step under this name within the continuous and intricate sequence of movements in the solo. Many elements of the choreography could be interpreted as having a \"Balanchine-esque\" quality, making any attempt at a quantitative analysis subjective and unreliable.\n\nTherefore, a definitive number of \"pas de Balanchines\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified scene cannot be provided."
