    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is the \"7 Deer\" day from the 260-day sacred calendar. This date was discovered on painted mural fragments at the San Bartolo archaeological site in Guatemala.\n\nRadiocarbon dating of the materials in the layer where the fragments were found, as well as the layer that buried them, has placed the creation of this calendrical notation between 300 and 200 BCE. This makes it the earliest securely dated example of a calendrical record in the Maya region and a key piece of evidence for understanding the development of Mesoamerican writing and calendrical systems.\n\nThe glyph for \"7 Deer\" is depicted with the ancient Maya writing for the number seven positioned above the outline of a deer's head. These fragments were part of a larger mural that was intentionally destroyed by the ancient Maya during a later phase of construction at the Las Pinturas pyramid. The discovery of these and other text fragments at San Bartolo reveals an already established tradition of writing and art in the region during the third century BCE.\n\nWhile other civilizations, such as the Olmec and Zapotec, also developed early writing systems, the \"7 Deer\" date from San Bartolo is the most definitive and widely recognized earliest recorded calendrical date. The Olmec Cascajal Block, which is older (c. 900 BCE), is considered the earliest writing in the Americas but does not contain a date. Other Olmec and Zapotec artifacts with potential calendrical glyphs, such as the San Andres glyphs (c. 650 BCE) and Zapotec Monument 3 (before 500 BCE), are not as securely dated or definitively interpreted as calendrical records. Therefore, the \"7 Deer\" notation stands as the earliest confirmed recorded date.\n\n<<<between 300 and 200 BCE>>>"
