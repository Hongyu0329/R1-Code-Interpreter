    "## BDF4 Stability Angle Determined\n\nThe exact angle, $\\alpha$, for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the fourth-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF4) has been determined to be approximately 73.35 degrees. For the numerical integration of stiff ordinary differential equations, the stability of the method is a crucial property. The A($\\alpha$)-stability describes the largest sector in the left half of the complex plane that is contained within the method's stability region.\n\nThe BDF methods are a family of implicit linear multistep methods known for their strong stability properties, making them suitable for stiff problems. While the first and second-order BDF methods are A-stable (meaning their stability region covers the entire left half-plane, corresponding to $\\alpha = 90^\\circ$), higher-order BDF methods are not. For orders three through six, the stability region is a bounded part of the left-half plane, and they are referred to as A($\\alpha$)-stable.\n\nThe boundary of the stability region is defined by the root locus curve of the method's stability polynomial. For the BDF4 method, the exact value of the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle has been derived. While numerical approximations are widely cited, the precise expression for the maximum angle, $\\vartheta_4$, has been established.\n\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the BDF4 scheme is given by:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{2(1-x^2)}(11-3x-24x^2)}{-15+51x-28x^2-12x^3}\\right)$\nwhere $x$ is a specific value derived from the analysis of the stability polynomial. While the full expression is complex, the resulting angle has been calculated to a high degree of precision.\n\nThe determination of these exact stability angles for BDF methods represents a significant theoretical result in numerical analysis, providing precise knowledge of the stability characteristics of these widely used methods.\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{21}}{9}\\right)$>>>"
