    "The initial search provides some context on the K-theory of rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$. Specifically, the papers \"On the K-theory of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$ -- announcement\" announce new methods for computing these K-groups and provide some explicit calculations and formulas. However, they do not directly state the answer for the specific case of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ and the even K-groups. The other search results give a general overview of algebraic K-theory but are not specific enough to answer the question directly. I need to find more specific information about the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$.The search results, particularly the paper \"On the K-theory of Z/p^n\" by Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus (2024), provide significant information. Specifically, Theorem 1.4, the \"even vanishing theorem,\" gives a condition for the vanishing of even K-groups. The formula depends on p, n, and the ramification index e. For $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, we have p=3, n=3, and e=1 (since it's an unramified extension).\n\nThe theorem states that for $i \\ge 2$, $K_{2i-2}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n; \\mathbb{Z}_p) = 0$ if $i - 1 \\ge \\frac{p}{p-1} \\left( p\\lceil \\frac{n}{e} \\rceil - 1 \\right) - p\\lceil \\frac{n}{e} \\rceil \\left( \\lceil \\frac{n}{e} \\rceil - \\frac{n}{e} \\right)$.\nFor our case, this simplifies to $i - 1 \\ge \\frac{3}{2} (3 \\cdot 3 - 1) - 3 \\cdot 3(3-3) = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 8 = 12$. So, for $i \\ge 13$, the p-part of the even K-groups vanishes. This suggests that non-zero even K-groups can only exist for smaller values of i.\n\nThe same paper provides a table with low-degree K-groups for some rings, including $\\mathbb{Z}/8 = \\mathbb{Z}/2^3$. For $\\mathbb{Z}/8$, the even K-groups $K_{2n}$ are non-zero for n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5. For n>=6, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/8)$ is zero. This gives a hint, but the calculation for $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ might be different.\n\nTo determine the largest n, I need to investigate the even K-groups for smaller indices i. I will now search for explicit computations of the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ or a more general formula that is easier to evaluate for small i.The papers by Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus are central to this question. They provide a method to compute the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$ and a theorem about the vanishing of even K-groups in high degrees. Specifically, for $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$, we have $p=3$, $n=3$, and the ramification index $e=1$.\n\nThe \"even vanishing theorem\" (Theorem 1.4 in) states that for $i \\ge 2$, $K_{2i-2}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n; \\mathbb{Z}_p)$ vanishes if\n$i - 1 \\ge \\frac{p}{p-1} (p\\lceil \\frac{n}{e} \\rceil - 1) - p\\lceil \\frac{n}{e} \\rceil ( \\lceil \\frac{n}{e} \\rceil - \\frac{n}{e} )$\nFor our case ($\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$), this becomes\n$i - 1 \\ge \\frac{3}{2} (3 \\cdot 3 - 1) - 3 \\cdot 3 (3-3) = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 8 = 12$.\nThis implies that for $i \\ge 13$, the 3-primary part of $K_{2i-2}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero. In terms of the index of the K-group, which is $2n$ in the user's notation, this means for $n = i-1 \\ge 12$, the 3-primary part of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ vanishes.\n\nThe K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/m$ are finite for positive even indices. The prime factors of the order of $K_k(\\mathbb{Z}/m)$ for $k>0$ can only be the prime factors of $m$ and the prime factors of the orders of the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}$. The even K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are non-trivial only at $K_0(\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$ and are finite and related to Bernoulli numbers for higher indices. For $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, we are primarily concerned with the 3-torsion.\n\nThe \"even vanishing theorem\" gives a condition for when the *p-primary part* of the even K-groups is zero. This strongly suggests that for large enough $n$, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ will be zero. The theorem implies that the 3-primary part of $K_{2(i-1)}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero for $i-1 \\ge 12$. This means we need to check the K-groups for smaller indices.\n\nIn a report from a talk by Achim Krause (one of the authors of the key papers), he mentions computational results and presents a table for the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$ for $p=2$ up to $n=5$ and for various $i$. For $\\mathbb{Z}/16$, $K_{10}$ is non-zero, and for $\\mathbb{Z}/32$, $K_{12}$ is non-zero. For $\\mathbb{Z}/8$, the highest non-vanishing even K-group is $K_8$. The pattern seems to depend on both $p$ and $n$.\n\nAnother result from the same set of papers is Corollary 2.4 from the \"announcement\" paper, which states:\n$|K_{2i−1}(O_K/̟^n; \\mathbb{Z}_p)| / |K_{2i−2}(O_K/̟^n; \\mathbb{Z}_p)| = q^{i(n−1)}$\nwhere $q=p^f$. For $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$, $O_K=\\mathbb{Z}_3$, $̟=3$, $n=3$, $f=1$, so $q=3$. This gives:\n$|K_{2i−1}(\\mathbb{Z}/27; \\mathbb{Z}_3)| / |K_{2i−2}(\\mathbb{Z}/27; \\mathbb{Z}_3)| = 3^{i(3−1)} = 3^{2i}$.\nThis relates the orders of consecutive K-groups. The \"even vanishing theorem\" tells us that for $i-1 \\ge 12$, the denominator is just the part of the order of $K_{2i-2}$ that is prime to 3. If we assume for a moment that the even K-groups are 3-groups, then for $i-1 \\ge 12$, they vanish. This would mean that the largest $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero is at most 11.\n\nTo find the precise value of n, I need to find explicit computations for the lower-degree even K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$. The papers state that they have an algorithm and have performed computations, but a specific table for $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is not in the provided search results.\n\nI will try to find the specific table of K-groups for $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$ from the authors' work. It is plausible that this information is available in the full version of their paper or in related presentations.The key to solving this problem lies in the work of Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus on the K-theory of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$. Their \"even vanishing theorem\" provides a bound for when the $p$-primary part of the even K-groups must be zero. For $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$, we have $p=3$ and $n=3$.\n\nThe theorem states that for $i \\geq 2$, the 3-primary part of $K_{2i-2}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero if the following condition holds:\n$i - 1 \\ge \\frac{3}{3-1} (3 \\cdot 3 - 1) = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 8 = 12$.\n\nThis implies that for an integer $n = i-1$, if $n \\ge 12$, then the 3-primary part of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero. The K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ are torsion groups, and their prime factors are expected to be 3 and the primes dividing the orders of the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}$. The even K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}$, $K_{2k}(\\mathbb{Z})$ for $k \\ge 1$, are finite and their orders are related to numerators of Bernoulli numbers. It is a major conjecture (Vandiver's conjecture) that these orders are not divisible by $p$ for regular primes $p$. For $p=3$, which is a regular prime, we do not expect 3-torsion in the even K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, the non-3-primary part of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is likely trivial for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nTherefore, the vanishing of the 3-primary part determines the vanishing of the entire group. The theorem guarantees that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero for all $n \\ge 12$. This means the largest possible value for $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero is at most 11.\n\nTo determine if any of the even K-groups with $n < 12$ are non-zero, we can look for explicit computations. While a complete table for $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is not readily available in the search results, the authors have stated that their methods allow for explicit computations and have provided tables for other cases, such as for $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ where the highest non-vanishing even K-group is $K_8(\\mathbb{Z}/8)$, meaning $n=4$. For $\\mathbb{Z}/16\\mathbb{Z}$, it is $K_{10}$, and for $\\mathbb{Z}/32\\mathbb{Z}$, it is $K_{12}$.\n\nThere is a known relationship for the orders of the $p$-primary parts of consecutive K-groups:\n$|K_{2i−1}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n; \\mathbb{Z}_p)| / |K_{2i−2}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n; \\mathbb{Z}_p)| = p^{i(n-1)}$\nFor $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, this is $|K_{2i−1}(\\mathbb{Z}/27; \\mathbb{Z}_3)| / |K_{2i−2}(\\mathbb{Z}/27; \\mathbb{Z}_3)| = 3^{2i}$. The odd K-groups are known to be large, so for the even K-groups not to vanish, they must also be non-trivial up to a certain point.\n\nBased on the pattern of the highest non-vanishing even K-group for $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ likely growing with $k$, and the bound from the even vanishing theorem, it is highly probable that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero for $n=11$. Without an explicit computation for $n=11$, we rely on the strong indication from the vanishing theorem that this is the boundary.\n\nFinal calculations based on the provided theorems and patterns suggest that the largest value is likely 11.\n\nAfter reviewing the available information, especially the vanishing theorem by Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus, the largest natural number $n$ for which the $(2n)$-th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is just below the threshold provided by the theorem. The theorem states that for $n \\ge 12$, the 3-primary part of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero. This strongly implies that the last possible non-zero even K-group is for $n=11$.\n\n"
