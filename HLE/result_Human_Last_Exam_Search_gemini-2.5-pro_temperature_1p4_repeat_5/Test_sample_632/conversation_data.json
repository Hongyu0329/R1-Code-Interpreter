    "While no unique architectural feature was removed from the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in 1950, a significant and much-discussed element was dismantled from the Pantheon itself in the late 19th century. This feature was a pair of twin bell towers, added in the 17th century.\n\nThe bell towers were added by Pope Urban VIII in 1628 and their design is often attributed to the famous architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, though some sources suggest Carlo Maderno and Francesco Borromini were responsible. These towers were intended to give the ancient pagan temple a more church-like appearance, as it had been consecrated as the Basilica of St. Mary and the Martyrs.\n\nHowever, the addition was widely unpopular with the Roman populace, who mockingly nicknamed the towers \"the ass's ears\" (\"le orecchie d'asino\"). This derogatory name reflected the public's opinion that the towers were an unsightly addition to the magnificent and ancient structure of the Pantheon. After standing for over two centuries, the controversial bell towers were finally demolished between 1881 and 1883, restoring the Pantheon's more classical and widely admired silhouette.\n\nOver the centuries, the Piazza della Rotonda has undergone numerous other transformations. In the 15th century, medieval sheds and shops that had crowded the area were cleared by order of Pope Eugenius IV. The central fountain was built in 1575, and the Egyptian obelisk was added on top of it in 1711. There were also various plans to enlarge the piazza, some of which resulted in the demolition of adjacent buildings in the 19th century.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers, known as \"the ass's ears\", which were removed from the Pantheon in the late 19th century.>>>"
