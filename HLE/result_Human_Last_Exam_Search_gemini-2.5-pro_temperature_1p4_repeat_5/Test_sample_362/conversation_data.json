    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. This reaction involves a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent, reacting with a carbonyl compound. The result is the replacement of the carbonyl group (C=O) with a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nThe specific reactants in this case are:\n*   **Aldehyde**: Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent**: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide with the structure PPh₃=CHCH₂(C₆H₄Cl), where the chloro group is at the ortho (position 2) of the phenyl ring.\n\nThe reaction proceeds by forming a new double bond between the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde and the ylide carbon that is double-bonded to the phosphorus atom. The by-product of this reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\nThe resulting product from this synthesis is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nDue to the nature of the double bond formed, the product can exist as two different geometric isomers: (E) and (Z). The specific stereochemistry of the product often depends on the ylide's nature and the reaction conditions. The ylide in this reaction is considered semi-stabilized, which can often lead to a mixture of both (E) and (Z) isomers.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene"
