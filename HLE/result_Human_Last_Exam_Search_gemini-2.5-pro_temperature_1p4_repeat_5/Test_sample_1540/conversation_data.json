    "An efficient C program for this task will avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously. The optimal approach is to read the first string into a buffer and then read the second string character by character, performing the comparison on the fly. This minimizes the total memory required for variables.\n\n### Memory-Efficient C Program\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program lexicographically compares two strings of the same length,\n * ignoring the case of the letters. It is designed to be highly memory-efficient.\n *\n * Memory Efficiency Strategy:\n * Instead of storing both strings in memory, this program stores only the\n * first string. It then reads the second string one character at a time from\n * the input stream and performs the comparison on the fly. This avoids\n * allocating a second buffer for the second string, significantly reducing\n * memory usage.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Buffer to store the first string.\n    // The maximum length is 100, so a buffer of size 101 (for the null terminator) is required.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first string from input. scanf will stop at the first\n    // whitespace, which is the newline character in this case.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Consume the newline character left in the input buffer by scanf.\n    getchar();\n\n    // Index for the first string, using the most memory-efficient type (unsigned char).\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n    // Variable to hold characters from the second string. Must be 'int'\n    // to correctly handle the 'EOF' value returned by getchar().\n    int s2_char;\n\n    // Read the second string character by character until a newline or EOF is found.\n    while ((s2_char = getchar()) != '\\n' && s2_char != EOF) {\n        // The problem guarantees the strings have the same length,\n        // so we don't need to check for out-of-bounds access on s1.\n\n        // Perform a case-insensitive comparison.\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(s2_char)) {\n            // First string is smaller. Print -1 and exit.\n            puts(\"-1\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(s2_char)) {\n            // First string is larger. Print 1 and exit.\n            puts(\"1\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        // If characters are equal, move to the next position.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, all characters were identical.\n    puts(\"0\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Calculation of Memory Usage (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` used for variables in this program is calculated as follows, assuming a standard 32-bit compilation environment (which is common in competitive programming):\n\n1.  **`s1`**: A character array to store the first string. The maximum length is 100 characters, and 1 extra byte is needed for the null terminator (`\\0`).\n    *   `Memory = 101 * sizeof(char) = 101 * 1 = 101 bytes.`\n2.  **`i`**: An index to traverse the `s1` array. Since the string length is at most 100, an `unsigned char` (which can hold values from 0 to 255) is the most memory-efficient data type for this purpose.\n    *   `Memory = sizeof(unsigned char) = 1 byte.`\n3.  **`s2_char`**: A variable to hold the character being read from the second string. The `getchar()` function returns an `int` to be able to represent every possible character as well as the special End-of-File (`EOF`) value.\n    *   `Memory = sizeof(int) = 4 bytes.`\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables.\n\nm = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `s2_char`)\nm = 101 + 1 + 4 = 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
