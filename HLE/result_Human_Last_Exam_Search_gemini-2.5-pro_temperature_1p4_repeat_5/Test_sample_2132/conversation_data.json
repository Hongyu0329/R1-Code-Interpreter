    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate. The Böttcher Molecular Complexity of this product is not readily available in public databases. It must be calculated using specialized software.\n\nTo determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, the following steps would be taken:\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone using a base like sodium ethoxide in ethanol results in a ring contraction, forming ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.\n2.  **Obtain the Chemical Structure:** The structure of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate is needed for the calculation. A common format for this is the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string, which for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate is `CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1`.\n3.  **Use a Böttcher Score Calculator:** The Böttcher Molecular Complexity is calculated using specific software. A web-based tool for this is provided by the Forli Lab. This tool can take a SMILES string as input to calculate the score.\n\nWhile PubChem lists a \"Complexity\" value of 114 for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, this is a different metric (the Cactvs-based PubChem Compound Complexity) and not the Böttcher Molecular Complexity score.\n\nWithout access to run the calculation through the specific Böttcher score calculator, the exact numerical value cannot be provided.\n\n<<<The Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, which is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, must be determined by calculation using specialized software like the Böttcher Score calculator from the Forli Lab with the SMILES input `CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1`. The pre-calculated value is not available in public chemical databases.>>>"
