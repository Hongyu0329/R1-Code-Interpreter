    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to understand the concept of color gamuts. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a much larger gamut than the sRGB color space. This means that ROMM RGB can represent more colors, particularly highly saturated ones, than sRGB can.\n\nWhen a color is converted from a larger gamut (ROMM RGB) to a smaller one (sRGB), some colors may fall \"out of gamut.\" For a digital RGB color, this means that at least one of its component values (red, green, or blue) will be outside the displayable range, which is typically represented as 0 to 255 for an 8-bit integer or 0.0 to 1.0 for a floating-point number. If a conversion results in a value below 0 or above 1.0 (or 255), that color cannot be accurately represented in the target color space.\n\nLet's analyze the given colors:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents a pure, highly saturated blue in the ROMM RGB space. The blue primary in ROMM RGB is far more saturated than the blue primary in sRGB. Converting this value to sRGB results in an sRGB blue value that is greater than 1.0, making it unrepresentable.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is a pure, highly saturated green in the ROMM RGB space. Similar to the blue primary, the green primary of ROMM RGB is far outside the sRGB gamut. When converted to sRGB, the resulting values are out of range (specifically, the green component is greater than 1.0 and the red component becomes negative). Therefore, it cannot be represented.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a muted cyan color. Because the color is not fully saturated (the component values are 0.5 and 0.6, not 1.0), it is less extreme. This color lies within the gamut of both ROMM RGB and sRGB and can be represented.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated blue-cyan color. Similar to the previous example, its lack of full saturation places it within the sRGB gamut. This color can be represented.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. The white point is a fundamental reference for both color spaces. After accounting for different reference illuminants (D50 for ROMM RGB and D65 for sRGB), white converts to white. Thus, it can be represented.\n\nBased on this analysis, the highly saturated primary colors (1 and 2) are outside the sRGB gamut.\n\n1, 2\n<<<1, 2>>>"
