    "The haiku \"The Bays\" is a riddle whose solution lies in the events surrounding the end of World War II in the Pacific. A step-by-step analysis of the poem reveals the answer.\n\n*\"**An August tempest...**\"*\nThis line refers to the tumultuous events of August 1945. Specifically, the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima on August 6 and Nagasaki on August 9 of that year. Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945.\n\n*\"**Twice fifteen brings winds of change...**\"*\n\"Twice fifteen\" equals thirty. This points to the geographical latitude of the locations involved. The cities of Hiroshima (34.4° N), Nagasaki (32.7° N), and Tokyo (35.7° N) are all located in proximity to the 30th parallel north. These events undeniably brought about a \"wind of change,\" marking the end of the war and the beginning of a new era.\n\n*\"**A divine one yields...**\"*\nThe Emperor of Japan was traditionally regarded as a divine figure. Emperor Hirohito's announcement of Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945, and his subsequent renouncement of divinity in January 1946, represent the \"divine one\" yielding.\n\nThe title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" is a question pointing to the specific bays related to these events. The atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a city on Hiroshima Bay. The second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, a port city on Nagasaki Bay. The formal surrender documents were signed aboard the USS Missouri, which was anchored in Tokyo Bay.\n\nTherefore, the haiku refers to three bays:\n\n*   Hiroshima Bay\n*   Nagasaki Bay\n*   Tokyo Bay\n\nThe question asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order.\" This phrasing suggests that the ultimate answer is not the list of bays itself, but is derived from it. The number of bays is three. The third letter of the alphabet is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
