    "For the supersymmetric sigma-model describing disordered systems of symmetry class D with n replicas, the target space for the field variables is the coset supermanifold SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). The non-Grassman variables, also known as bosonic variables, correspond to the dimensions of the bosonic part of this target space.\n\nThe bosonic subgroup of the orthosymplectic supergroup SpO(2n, R|2n) is the product of the real symplectic group and the orthogonal group, Sp(2n, R) × O(2n). The bosonic subgroup of the unitary supergroup U(n|n) is U(n) × U(n). Consequently, the bosonic sector of the sigma-model is parametrized by the manifold (Sp(2n, R) × O(2n)) / (U(n) × U(n)).\n\nTo determine the number of non-Grassman variables for the case of two replicas (n=2), we need to calculate the dimension of this bosonic manifold. The dimension of a coset space G/H is given by the difference of the dimensions of the respective Lie groups, dim(G) - dim(H).\n\nFor n=2, the bosonic manifold is (Sp(4, R) × O(4)) / (U(2) × U(2)). The dimensions of these classical Lie groups are well-known:\n*   The dimension of the real symplectic group Sp(2n, R) is n(2n+1). For n=2, the dimension of Sp(4, R) is 2(2*2 + 1) = 10.\n*   The dimension of the orthogonal group O(m) is m(m-1)/2. For the O(4) group (with m=2n=4), the dimension is 4(4-1)/2 = 6.\n*   The dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n². For n=2, the dimension of U(2) is 2² = 4.\n\nThe total number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of the bosonic part of the numerator minus the dimension of the bosonic part of the denominator:\n\nDimension = [dim(Sp(4, R)) + dim(O(4))] - [dim(U(2)) + dim(U(2))]\nDimension = (10 + 6) - (4 + 4)\nDimension = 16 - 8\nDimension = 8\n\nThus, 8 non-Grassman variables are needed.\n\n<<<8>>>"
