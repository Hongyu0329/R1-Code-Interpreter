    "The number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, denoted as a(10), is 44,100. The Manhattan lattice is another name for the square lattice in this context.\n\nThe number of self-avoiding walks for a given number of steps is a well-studied problem in combinatorics. The sequence representing the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is cataloged as sequence A001411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\nThe initial terms of this sequence, starting from a 0-step walk, are:\n*   a(0) = 1\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\nA self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. While there is no simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n, these values have been computed through various algorithms.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
