    "The thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above 2, with the valuation $v$ normalized so that $v(2)=1$, is 2/5.\n\nThis result is derived from the detailed analysis of the stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves in residue characteristic 2. In a relevant research paper that provides an algorithm for this computation, the curve in question is used as an example. The paper calculates a specific invariant, denoted by $\\delta$, which corresponds to the \"thickness\" of a singular point in the stable reduction. For the curve $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$, the value of this invariant is explicitly stated to be $\\delta = 2/5$. This value determines the local structure of the stable reduction of the curve.\n\n<<<2/5>>>"
