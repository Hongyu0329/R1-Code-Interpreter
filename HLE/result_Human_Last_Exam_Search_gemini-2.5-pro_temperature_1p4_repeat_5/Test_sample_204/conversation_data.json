    "The Hopf charge of a vector field can be determined using the Whitehead formula. For a vector field of the form (nx, ny, nz) expressed in spherical coordinates with a dependence on cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z), where nx = sin(G(ρ,z))cos(pφ), ny = sin(G(ρ,z))sin(pφ), and nz = cos(G(ρ,z)), the Hopf charge is given by the product of two integer winding numbers, H = p * q.\n\nIn the given vector field:\n*   **nx = sin(G)cos(f)**\n*   **ny = sin(G)sin(f)**\n*   **nz = cos(G)**\n\nThe term `f = atan2(y,x)` in cylindrical coordinates is the azimuthal angle φ. This indicates that the winding number around the z-axis, denoted as 'p', is 1.\n\nThe second winding number, 'q', is determined by the function G, which maps the poloidal plane (the (ρ, z) half-plane) to the angle of the vector field with respect to the z-axis. The function is given by:\nG = π * exp(-10 * r2)\nwhere r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z).\nIn cylindrical coordinates, this is r2 = sqrt((ρ^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2).\n\nWe analyze the range of G:\n*   At the circle defined by ρ = sqrt(0.5) and z = 0, the value of r2 is 0. This results in G = π. In this region, the vector field points in the -z direction (nz = cos(π) = -1).\n*   As the distance from this circle approaches infinity (i.e., ρ → ∞ or |z| → ∞), r2 also approaches infinity. This causes G to approach 0. In these regions, the vector field points in the +z direction (nz = cos(0) = 1).\n\nThe function G maps the entire 3D space onto the range [0, π], covering the full range of the poloidal angle. This corresponds to a poloidal winding number 'q' of 1.\n\nTherefore, the Hopf charge H is the product of the two winding numbers, p and q.\n\nH = p * q = 1 * 1 = 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
