    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word. This change typically occurs when a suffix is added to a base word.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n\n*   **derivative:** This word shows trisyllabic laxing. The base word is *derive*, which has a tense vowel /aɪ/. When the suffix `-ative` is added, the word becomes four syllables (de-riv-a-tive), and the vowel in the stressed syllable `\"-riv-\"` becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/.\n*   **serenity:** This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The base word is *serene*, with a tense vowel /iː/. In *serenity* (se-ren-i-ty), the vowel in the now antepenultimate syllable `\"-ren-\"` changes to the lax vowel /ɛ/.\n*   **gratitude:** This word also underwent trisyllabic laxing. It is related to the word *grateful*, which stems from the Latin *grātus*, featuring a tense vowel. In the three-syllable word *gratitude* (grat-i-tude), the vowel in the first syllable is the lax vowel /æ/.\n*   **southern:** This word experienced trisyllabic laxing in its historical development. The base word *south* has a tense diphthong /aʊ/. The Old English form of *southern* was *sūðerne*, pronounced with three syllables. This structure caused the tense vowel of the root word to become lax, resulting in the modern pronunciation with /ʌ/.\n*   **pleasant:** This word is disyllabic (pleas-ant). Since trisyllabic laxing applies to words of three or more syllables, *pleasant* could not have undergone this process. The vowel shortening from the related word *please* is an instance of a different laxing rule.\n*   **shadow:** This word is disyllabic (shad-ow) and, like *pleasant*, does not meet the criteria for trisyllabic laxing. The vowel change from its base word *shade* is a well-known example of a different rule called disyllabic laxing.\n\nBoth *pleasant* and *shadow* are disyllabic and therefore have not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing. However, *shadow* is explicitly cited in phonological descriptions as an example of a different process (disyllabic laxing) that is contrasted with trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
