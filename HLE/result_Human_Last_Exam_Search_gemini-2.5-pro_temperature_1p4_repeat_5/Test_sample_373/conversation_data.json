    "To determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph with 10 nodes and uniform weights during randomized uniform gossiping, we first need to define the structure of the graph and the sampling process.\n\n### Barbell Graph Structure\n\nA barbell graph is typically constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a path. In the simplest case, this path consists of a single edge, which acts as a bottleneck. For a 10-node barbell graph, the most symmetric and common construction involves two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K_5). These two cliques are connected by a single edge, the bottleneck edge.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of edges in such a graph:\n*   **Edges in one K_5 clique:** A complete graph with *n* nodes has *n*(n-1)/2 edges. For a K_5, this is 5 * (5-1) / 2 = 10 edges.\n*   **Total edges in both cliques:** Since there are two K_5 cliques, the total number of edges within the cliques is 10 + 10 = 20.\n*   **The bottleneck edge:** There is 1 edge connecting the two cliques.\n*   **Total number of edges:** The total number of edges in the graph is the sum of the edges in both cliques and the bottleneck edge, which is 20 + 1 = 21 edges.\n\n### Randomized Uniform Gossiping\n\n\"Randomized uniform gossiping\" in the context of edge sampling typically means that at each step, an edge is selected uniformly at random from the set of all edges in the graph. This model assumes that every edge has an equal probability of being chosen for communication or information exchange.\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n\nGiven that the edge sampling is uniform, the probability of selecting any specific edge is 1 divided by the total number of edges.\n\nTherefore, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is:\n\n**Probability = (Number of Bottleneck Edges) / (Total Number of Edges)**\n\n**Probability = 1 / 21**\n\nThe probability can be expressed as a decimal:\n\n1 / 21 â‰ˆ 0.0476\n\nThis low probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is a key reason why information spreads slowly in barbell graphs under uniform gossiping models, a topic frequently studied in the context of network consensus and distributed algorithms.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
