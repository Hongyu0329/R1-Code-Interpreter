    "Two patches of surface code are physically separate entities. Therefore, to find the total number of logical qubits, we can calculate the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a single patch and then multiply that by two.\n\nA standard patch of surface code on a plane (which is topologically equivalent to a disk) and without any holes can encode a single logical qubit. Introducing holes, also known as punctures or defects, into the surface code lattice increases the number of logical qubits it can store.\n\nThe precise number of logical qubits depends on the topological properties of the patch, specifically its genus (which is 0 for a planar patch) and the nature of its boundaries (the outer edge and the edges of the holes). According to the theory of generalized surface codes, the number of logical qubits (`k`) can be calculated with the formula `k = 2g + b + m - 1`, where `g` is the genus of the surface, `b` is the total number of boundaries, and `m` is the number of those boundaries that are of a \"mixed\" type (partially open and partially closed).\n\nFor a single patch of surface code, which is a planar structure, the genus `g` is 0. If two holes are introduced, the patch has one external boundary and two internal boundaries (around the holes), making for a total of `b = 3` boundaries.\n\nTo find the maximum number of logical qubits, we must maximize the variable `m`, which represents the number of mixed boundaries. It is possible for all boundaries to be of the mixed type, meaning the maximum value for `m` is 3.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives the maximum number of logical qubits for a single patch:\nk = (2 * 0) + 3 + 3 - 1 = 5\n\nTherefore, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode a maximum of 5 logical qubits. This is supported by examples in the literature, such as the \"mixed diamond-hole surface code\" which, with two holes, can encode 5 logical qubits.\n\nSince there are two such identical patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each:\nTotal logical qubits = (qubits in patch 1) + (qubits in patch 2) = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
