**1. Amlodipine (Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker)**

*   **Rationale:** Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a first-line treatment for hypertension, particularly in African American patients. This class of medication works by relaxing blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood. Combining a CCB like amlodipine with a renin-angiotensin system blocker, such as an ARB, has been shown to be a safe and highly effective strategy for lowering blood pressure.

**2. Losartan (Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker - ARB)**

*   **Rationale:** For patients with both hypertension and diabetes, an Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an ARB is strongly recommended. These medications protect the kidneys from damage, a common complication of diabetes. ARBs like losartan are often preferred as they have a lower risk of side effects like cough, which can be more common in African American patients taking ACE inhibitors. The combination of losartan and amlodipine is a well-established and effective pairing for hypertension control.

**3. Nebivolol (Vasodilating Beta-Blocker)**

*   **Rationale:** Given the patient's elevated heart rate of 91 bpm, a beta-blocker is a logical addition to her regimen. Nebivolol is a third-generation, vasodilating beta-blocker that has demonstrated effectiveness in treating resistant hypertension, with an efficacy similar to the standard fourth-line agent, spironolactone, which this patient cannot take. Its vasodilating properties and high selectivity for beta-1 receptors may lead to better tolerability, including less fatigue, compared to other beta-blockers. Other vasodilating beta-blockers like carvedilol are also effective options for resistant hypertension.
