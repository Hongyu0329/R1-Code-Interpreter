    "In an interval type-3 fuzzy logic system, the rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedent, represented by `Φ_k(x′)`, and the membership degree of the consequent, `μG_k_j(y_j)`. The t-norm, or triangular norm, generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy sets.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   `Φ_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\nThe rule activation level is calculated by `T(Φ_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`, where `T` represents a t-norm. The two most commonly used t-norms are the minimum (Gödel) and the product t-norm.\n\n1.  **Using the Minimum t-norm:** The activation level is the minimum of the two values.\n    *   Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n2.  **Using the Product t-norm:** The activation level is the product of the two values.\n    *   Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nWithout a specified t-norm, the rule activation level depends on the chosen operation. If the minimum t-norm is used, the activation level is 0.7. If the product t-norm is used, it is 0.63. The problem statement does not specify which t-norm to use, so providing the result for both common t-norms is appropriate. In many fuzzy inference systems, the firing strength is calculated using a t-norm to combine the membership values of the antecedents. The activation of a rule is a result of the composition between the inputs (facts) and the rules in the knowledge base.\n\n<<<0.7 (using minimum t-norm) or 0.63 (using product t-norm)>>>"
