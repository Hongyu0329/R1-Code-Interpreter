    "After a gene duplication event, there are several possible fates for the newly created duplicate gene. The mechanisms most responsible for the retention of both copies, which facilitates their subsequent divergence, are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the potential fates of a duplicated gene and an evaluation of the given choices:\n\n*   **Pseudogenization**: This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene. One copy accumulates mutations that render it non-functional, turning it into a pseudogene. This outcome represents a *failure* to retain a functional duplicate pair, so it is not the mechanism for retention.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization**: In this model, one gene copy retains the original, ancestral function, while the other copy is free to accumulate mutations. On rare occasions, these mutations can lead to the evolution of a completely new function that provides a benefit to the organism. This new, beneficial function ensures that both the original and the new gene are preserved by natural selection.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization**: This model, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns (e.g., activity in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, each copy sustains mutations that disable a different subset of the original functions. Consequently, both genes are required to fully perform the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene once did. This partitioning of functions ensures both copies are retained.\n\n*   **Gene Conversion**: This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them identical. This mechanism works to homogenize duplicate genes, thereby *preventing* divergence. It is not a mechanism for retention and divergence.\n\n*   **Adaptive Radiation**: This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a lineage into many new species. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not a molecular mechanism that acts on the genes themselves.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, the probability of the underlying events differs. Neofunctionalization relies on the occurrence of a rare beneficial, gain-of-function mutation. In contrast, subfunctionalization is driven by more common, mildly degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations.\n\nBecause subfunctionalization provides a selectively neutral pathway for the initial preservation of both copies—sparing them from rapid pseudogenization—it is considered a highly probable and critical mechanism for retaining duplicate genes. Modeling suggests that subfunctionalization often acts as a transitional state that increases the preservation of duplicate genes, which may then provide the opportunity for one copy to later evolve a new function (neofunctionalization). Therefore, subfunctionalization is a crucial and likely mechanism responsible for the retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\n\nConsidering the higher probability of degenerative mutations compared to novel beneficial mutations, subfunctionalization represents a more likely initial path for duplicate gene preservation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
