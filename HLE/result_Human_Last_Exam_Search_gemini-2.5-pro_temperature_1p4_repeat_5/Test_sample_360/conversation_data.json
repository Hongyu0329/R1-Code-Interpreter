    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed rather than a simple mononuclear one. This is because the ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, is a bridging ligand that chelates to two separate metal centers.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n2 [Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂] + L → [{Ru(bpy)₂}₂(μ-L)]⁴⁺ + 4Cl⁻\n(where L = 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)\n\nIn the resulting dinuclear complex, each ruthenium center is octahedral and chiral, capable of existing in either a Δ (delta) or Λ (lambda) configuration. With two such chiral centers in the molecule, diastereomers are possible.\n\nThe possible stereochemical combinations for the two ruthenium centers are:\n1.  **Δ,Δ** and **Λ,Λ**: This pair of enantiomers constitutes the *racemic* (rac) diastereoisomer.\n2.  **Δ,Λ**: This is a *meso* compound, which is achiral due to a center of inversion and is therefore a distinct diastereoisomer from the *rac* form.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces two separable diastereoisomers: the *meso* isomer and the *rac* isomer. If one were to count every individual stereoisomer, the total would be three (the meso compound, plus the two enantiomers that make up the racemic mixture). However, in terms of distinct chemical products formed and separated, there are two diastereomers.\n\n<<<2"
