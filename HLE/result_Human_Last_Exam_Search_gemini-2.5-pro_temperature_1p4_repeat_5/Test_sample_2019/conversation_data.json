    "There are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\nThis result is documented in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under sequence A172519. This sequence enumerates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on an n x n toroidal board. For a board of size n=5, the corresponding value in the sequence is 50.\n\nThe problem of placing queens on a toroidal board is a variation of the classic n-queens problem. On a toroidal board, the edges wrap around, meaning a queen on the top row can attack a queen on the bottom row in the same column, and similarly for the left and right edges. This also creates additional \"broken\" diagonals that must be considered.\n\nWhile solutions for placing *n* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board only exist if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3, the problem of placing a smaller number of queens, *k*, on an *n*x*n* board is a different combinatorial challenge. In the case of 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board, a solution is possible, and the precise number of configurations has been computed.\n\n<<<50>>>"
