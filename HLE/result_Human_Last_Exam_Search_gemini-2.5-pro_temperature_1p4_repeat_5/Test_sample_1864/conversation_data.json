    "For a successful flow cytometry sorting experiment using five channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750) with streptavidin beads, it is crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure accurate data interpretation and proper gating. These controls help to set up the instrument, compensate for spectral overlap, and precisely define positive and negative populations.\n\nBased on best practices for multicolor flow cytometry, you should prepare the following essential controls:\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 tube):** This sample contains only your cells without any fluorescent labels. It is fundamental for determining the baseline autofluorescence of your cell population and for setting the initial voltage settings on the flow cytometer.\n*   **Viability Control (1 tube):** This control consists of cells stained only with a viability dye. Dead cells can bind antibodies non-specifically and have higher autofluorescence, leading to false positives. Including a viability dye allows you to exclude dead cells from your analysis, significantly improving data quality.\n*   **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 tubes):** When using multiple fluorochromes, their emission spectra can overlap. To correct for this, a single-stained control is required for each fluorochrome in your panel. In your case, this means one tube for each of the five channels:\n    *   AF350-conjugated antibody\n    *   GFP-expressing cells\n    *   PE-conjugated antibody (or Streptavidin-PE)\n    *   AF647-conjugated antibody\n    *   AF750-conjugated antibody\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes):** FMO controls are essential for setting accurate gates, especially for dim signals or when populations are not well-separated. An FMO control includes all the stains in your panel except for one. This allows you to see the spread of fluorescence from the other fluorochromes into the channel of the omitted one, enabling precise gate placement. For a five-color panel, you should prepare five FMO controls, one for each fluorochrome.\n*   **Streptavidin Control (1 tube):** Since your experiment involves a streptavidin-based detection method (likely a biotinylated antibody followed by a fluorescent streptavidin conjugate like Streptavidin-PE), you need a control for non-specific binding of the streptavidin. This tube should contain your cells stained only with the fluorescent streptavidin conjugate, without the biotinylated antibody.\n\nIn summary, the total number of essential control tubes to prepare is:\n\n*   1 Unstained Control\n*   1 Viability Control\n*   5 Single-Stain Compensation Controls\n*   5 Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls\n*   1 Streptavidin Control\n\nThis brings the total to 13 essential control samples. While this may seem like a large number, each control serves a critical purpose in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of your sorting experiment.\n\n<<<13>>>"
