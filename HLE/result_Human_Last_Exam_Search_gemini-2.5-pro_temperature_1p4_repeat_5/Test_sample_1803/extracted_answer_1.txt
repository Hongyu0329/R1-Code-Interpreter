$\Delta E_0 = - \frac{\hbar}{8m^2\omega_0^3} \left( \frac{e^2}{4\pi R^3} \right)^2 \left[ (\hat{u}_1 \cdot \hat{u}_2) - 3(\hat{u}_1 \cdot \hat{R})(\hat{u}_2 \cdot \hat{R}) \right]^2$

Where:
- $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.
- $m$ is the mass of the oscillators.
- $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency of the oscillators.
- $e$ is the elementary charge.
- $R$ is the distance between the oscillators.
- $\hat{u}_1$ and $\hat{u}_2$ are the unit vectors defining the direction of oscillation for each oscillator.
- $\hat{R}$ is the unit vector along the line connecting the two oscillators.
