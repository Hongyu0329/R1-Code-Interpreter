    "I have gathered some initial information. The search results provide context on branched covers, twist-spun knots, and their fundamental groups. Specifically, result mentions the group of the 5-twist-spun trefoil. It states that the group of the knot complement, π₁(S⁴ - S²), is G x Z, where G is the binary dodecahedral group. It also gives a presentation for the group of the 5-twist-spun trefoil. However, the user is asking for the fundamental group of the *double branched cover* of S⁴ over this knot, not the knot complement itself. The relationship between the fundamental group of the complement and the fundamental group of the branched cover is mentioned in some results (,,), but a direct formula to compute it isn't immediately available in a simple form. I need to find a more direct connection between the knot group of the 5-twist-spun trefoil and the fundamental group of its double branched cover.The second step of my plan was successful in finding a key piece of information. The search results, particularly result, state that the fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot in S⁴, denoted as π₁(S⁴ - S²), is the direct product of the binary dodecahedral group G and the integers Z. So, π₁(S⁴ - S²) = G x Z.\n\nHowever, I still need to determine the fundamental group of the double branched cover of S⁴ over this knot. I have not yet found a direct formula or theorem in the search results that allows me to compute this. I have found general information about the relationship between knot groups and fundamental groups of branched covers, but not a specific recipe for this particular case. I also need to find the minimal number of generators for the resulting group. Therefore, my next steps will focus on finding this relationship and then the number of generators for the final group.\n\nUpdated plan:\nSearch for a formula or theorem that relates the fundamental group of a knot complement to the fundamental group of its double branched cover, specifically in the context of knots in S⁴.\nOnce the fundamental group of the double branched cover is identified, I will find the minimal number of generators for this group. If the group is a well-known group, I will search for its minimal number of generators. If it is a more complex group, I will look for methods to determine the minimal number of generators from a group presentation.\nFinally, I will use the gathered information to state the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of S⁴ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.I have made significant progress. I've confirmed that the fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot in S⁴ is the direct product of the binary dodecahedral group (G) and the integers (Z), i.e., π₁(S⁴ - S²) = G x Z.\n\nHowever, the core of the problem remains to find the fundamental group of the *double branched cover* of S⁴ over this knot and then determine its minimal number of generators. While I've found general information about the relationship between knot complements and their branched covers, I lack a specific theorem or formula for the S⁴ case with a 2-knot. The provided search results touch upon double branched covers of S³ over 1-knots, but the extension to S⁴ and 2-knots is not explicitly detailed in a way that I can directly apply.\n\nTherefore, the next crucial step is to find this specific relationship for 2-knots in S⁴. After that, I will focus on the number of generators for the resulting group.\n\nUpdated plan:\nFind a precise theorem or formula that describes the fundamental group of the double branched cover of S⁴ over a 2-knot in terms of the fundamental group of the knot's complement.\nApply this theorem to the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot, using the known fundamental group of its complement (G x Z).\nDetermine the minimal number of generators for the resulting fundamental group of the double branched cover. This will likely involve analyzing the structure of the binary dodecahedral group.\nSynthesize all the information to provide the final answer.I have successfully identified the fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot in S⁴ as the direct product of the binary dodecahedral group (G) and the integers (Z), which can be written as π₁(S⁴ - S²) = G x Z. I also found that the binary dodecahedral group is isomorphic to SL(2,5). However, I am still missing the crucial piece of information that connects the fundamental group of the knot complement to the fundamental group of its double branched cover in S⁴. While some search results discuss double branched covers in S³, the generalization to S⁴ and 2-knots is not explicitly provided in a directly applicable formula. The search also provided information on the number of generators for SL(2,5), which will be useful in the final step. My immediate priority is to find the relationship between the fundamental group of the knot complement and the fundamental group of its double branched cover.I have made a crucial breakthrough with the latest search. Result provides a topological interpretation of the core group of a surface embedded in S⁴. It states that the core group, GM, is isomorphic to the free product of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of S⁴ with the surface as a branched set (π₁(M(2))) and the infinite cyclic group (Z). The result further clarifies the relationship between the fundamental group of the knot complement (ΠM) and the core group (GM).\n\nThis gives me the connection I was missing. I know that for the 5-twist-spun trefoil, the knot group is the direct product of the binary dodecahedral group (G) and the integers (Z), so ΠM = G x Z. Now I can use the relationship from result to determine the fundamental group of the double branched cover, π₁(M(2)). Once I have this, I need to find its minimal number of generators. I already have some information on the generators of the binary dodecahedral group from previous searches, which will be essential.\n\nI believe I now have all the necessary components to answer the user's question.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Use the relationship from result between the knot group (ΠM = G x Z) and the core group (GM) to find the structure of the fundamental group of the double branched cover (π₁(M(2))).\n2.  Determine the minimal number of generators for the binary dodecahedral group (G), which is isomorphic to SL(2,5).\n3.  Based on the structure of π₁(M(2)), determine its minimal number of generators.\n4.  Formulate the final answer.\n\nI will now proceed with the analysis and determination of the final answer without further searches.\nThe minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is 2.\n\nThe fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot in the 4-sphere, denoted as $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)$, is known to be the direct product of the binary dodecahedral group, $G$, and the integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. This can be expressed as $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K) \\cong G \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. The binary dodecahedral group is also isomorphic to the special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field with 5 elements, denoted as SL(2,5).\n\nA key result in the study of 2-knots establishes a relationship between the fundamental group of the knot complement and the fundamental group of its double branched cover. The core group of the knot, $G_K$, is shown to be isomorphic to the free product of the fundamental group of the double branched cover, $\\pi_1(M_2(K))$, and the infinite cyclic group, $\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, $G_K \\cong \\pi_1(M_2(K)) * \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor a 2-knot, the fundamental group of its complement, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)$, is isomorphic to the core group, $G_K$. In the case of the 5-twist-spun trefoil, this means that $G \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\pi_1(M_2(K)) * \\mathbb{Z}$. By the properties of free products, if a group that is a direct product with an infinite cyclic group is also a free product with an infinite cyclic group, then the other factor in both products must be isomorphic. Therefore, the fundamental group of the double branched cover is the binary dodecahedral group, $\\pi_1(M_2(K)) \\cong G \\cong \\text{SL}(2,5)$.\n\nThe binary dodecahedral group, SL(2,5), can be generated by two elements. For example, it can be generated by the matrices:\n\n$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $ and $ B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $\n\nin SL(2,5). Therefore, the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
