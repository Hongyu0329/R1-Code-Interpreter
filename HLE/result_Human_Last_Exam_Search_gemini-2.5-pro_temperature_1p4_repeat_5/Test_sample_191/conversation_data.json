    "When Glia Maturation Factor-gamma (GMFG) is broken down or inhibited, it allows for increased macrophage engulfment of amyloid-beta (Aβ).\n\nGMFG is a protein that regulates the actin cytoskeleton within cells and is highly expressed in immune cells like macrophages. Its breakdown or knockdown leads to an increase in the phagocytosis, or engulfment, of Aβ42 by macrophages. Conversely, the overexpression of GMFG reduces the uptake of Aβ42.\n\nThe mechanism behind this is linked to a cell-surface receptor called scavenger receptor class A type I (SR-AI), which is involved in clearing Aβ. The reduction of GMFG increases the expression of SR-AI on macrophages, at both the genetic transcription and protein levels. By preventing the degradation of SR-AI, lower levels of GMFG result in more of these receptors on the macrophage surface, enhancing their ability to bind and engulf amyloid-beta.\n\n<<<Glia Maturation Factor-gamma (GMFG)>>>"
