The minimal average resources required to simulate the correlations from a set of POVM measurements on a singlet bipartite quantum state with a local hidden variable model are approximately 5.7 bits of classical communication. For the more restricted case of projective measurements, this reduces to one bit of communication or one non-signaling PR-Box.
