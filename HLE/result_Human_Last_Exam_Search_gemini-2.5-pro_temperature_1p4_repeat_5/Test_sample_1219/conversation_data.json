    "To determine the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to use the periodicity of the tangent function. The period of tan(x) is π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x - kπ) for any integer k. We can use this property to reduce the very large number 10^100 to a smaller value within the primary domain of the tangent function.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Reduce the argument**: We need to find the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π. This is equivalent to `10^100 mod π`.\n2.  **Use 1/π**: To find this remainder, we can analyze the decimal expansion of `1/π`. The value of `10^100 / π` will have an integer part and a fractional part. The fractional part of `10^100 / π` determines the value of the reduced argument.\n3.  **Find the fractional part**: The fractional part of `10^100 / π` is given by the digits of the decimal expansion of `1/π` starting from the 101st digit. Let `f` be this fractional part.\n4.  **Calculate the new argument**: The new argument for the tangent function will be `f * π`.\n5.  **Compute the tangent**: The final step is to calculate `tan(f * π)`.\n\nBased on a high-precision value of `1/π`, the digits starting from the 101st decimal place are required. The decimal expansion of `1/π` begins as `0.318309886...`. The 101st to 105th digits of `1/π` are 1, 2, 8, 4, and 8.\n\nTherefore, the fractional part `f` is approximately `0.12848`. Since this value is less than 0.5, we use `f * π` as the argument for the tangent function.\n\nThe argument for the tangent function is `0.12848 * π`. In radians, this is a small angle.\n\nCalculating `tan(0.12848 * π)`:\n`0.12848 * π ≈ 0.12848 * 3.14159265 ≈ 0.40363` radians.\n\nNow, we compute the tangent of this value:\n`tan(0.40363) ≈ 0.42718`\n\nThe first three digits after the comma are 427.\n\n<<<427>>>"
