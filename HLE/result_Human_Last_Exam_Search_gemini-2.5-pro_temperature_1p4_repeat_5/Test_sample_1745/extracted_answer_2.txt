The expression for the Electrical Double-Layer (EDL) potential distribution, $\psi(y)$, in the microchannel is governed by the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation under the Debye-Hückel approximation. The governing differential equation is:

$\frac{d^2 \psi}{dy^2} = k^2 \psi$

Here, $k$ is the Debye-Hückel parameter, and $y$ is the vertical coordinate across the channel height, from $y=0$ at the bottom surface to $y=H$ at the top surface.

The boundary conditions are determined by the slip-dependent zeta potentials at the two surfaces:
1.  At the bottom surface ($y=0$): The zeta potential is $\psi(0) = \zeta_{a1} = z_1(1 + \beta k)$.
2.  At the top surface ($y=H$): The zeta potential is $\psi(H) = \zeta_{a2} = z_2(1 + \beta k)$. Given that $z_2 = 0$, this simplifies to $\psi(H) = 0$.

The general solution to the differential equation is of the form $\psi(y) = C_1 \cosh(ky) + C_2 \sinh(ky)$. Applying the specified boundary conditions allows for the determination of the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.

Solving this second-order ordinary differential equation with the given boundary conditions yields the final expression for the EDL potential distribution:

$\psi(y) = z_1(1 + \beta k) \frac{\sinh(k(H-y))}{\sinh(kH)}$

This expression correctly satisfies both boundary conditions:
*   When $y=0$, $\psi(0) = z_1(1 + \beta k) \frac{\sinh(kH)}{\sinh(kH)} = z_1(1 + \beta k)$.
*   When $y=H$, $\psi(H) = z_1(1 + \beta k) \frac{\sinh(0)}{\sinh(kH)} = 0$.

The details concerning the fluid type (generalized Maxwell) and the nature of the applied field (AC) are necessary for determining the resulting fluid velocity profile but do not alter the expression for the EDL potential distribution itself, which is based on electrostatic principles.
