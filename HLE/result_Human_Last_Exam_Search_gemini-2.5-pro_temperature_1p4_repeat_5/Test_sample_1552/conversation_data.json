    "<<<begin\nThe second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is denoted as `a₂`. The spectral action is given by the trace of a function of the Dirac operator, `Tr(f(D/Λ))`, where `D` is the gauged Dirac operator and `Λ` is a cutoff scale. Its asymptotic expansion for large `Λ` is given in terms of the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients `a_n`.\n\nFor a massless Dirac spinor field coupled to a gauge field on a four-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Dirac operator is given by `D = γ^μ(∂_μ + ω_μ + iA_μ)`, where `γ^μ` are the gamma matrices, `ω_μ` is the spin connection, and `A_μ` is the gauge potential.\n\nThe square of the Dirac operator is a Laplacian-type operator:\n`D² = - (∇² + (1/4)R) - (i/2)F_{μν}γ^μγ^ν`\nwhere `∇` is the covariant derivative acting on spinors, `R` is the scalar curvature, and `F_{μν}` is the field strength of the gauge connection.\n\nThe second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient, `a₂`, for the square of the Dirac operator determines the `Λ^0` term in the spectral action. The trace of the coefficient density, `tr(a₂)`, is a local invariant constructed from the curvature of the spacetime manifold and the field strength of the gauge field.\n\nFor a Dirac spinor in four dimensions, the trace of the `a₂` coefficient is given by:\n\n`tr(a_2) = (1/360) * (4π)^(-2) * (5R² - 8R_{μν}R^{μν} - 7R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ}) + (1/12) * (4π)^(-2) * tr(F_{μν}F^{μν})`\n\nHere:\n*   `R` is the Ricci scalar.\n*   `R_{μν}` is the Ricci tensor.\n*   `R_{μνρσ}` is the Riemann tensor.\n*   `F_{μν}` is the field strength of the gauge field.\n*   The trace `tr` in the last term is over the generators of the gauge group.\n\nThis expression is a standard result in quantum field theory and noncommutative geometry and can be found in reviews on the heat kernel expansion, such as the \"Heat kernel expansion: user's manual\" by D.V. Vassilevich, and is used in computations presented in papers like \"General heat kernel coefficients for massless free spin-3/2 Rarita-Schwinger field\".\n\n"
