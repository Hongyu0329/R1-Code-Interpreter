Here are the specific residues from the human beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction and fine-tuning gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit:

**1) Hotspots for interaction with alpha-1 subunit:**

The primary interaction site is the **Alpha Binding Pocket (ABP)** located within the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain of the human Cavβ1 subunit. A critical part of this is the **Beta Interaction Domain (BID)**. Based on the consensus sequence and mapping to the human Cavβ1 (UniProt Q02641), the key residues are within the approximate region of **amino acids 299-329**.

**2) Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of alpha-1 subunit:**

Residues outside the direct binding pocket are crucial for modulating the channel's function. A key hotspot for influencing channel activation is located on the surface of the GK domain at the following positions in human Cavβ1:
*   **Aspartic Acid (D) at position 454**
*   **Aspartic Acid (D) at position 455**
*   **Glutamic Acid (E) at position 458**

Additionally, the **SH3 and HOOK domains** (located in the region preceding the GK domain) contain residues that are important for gating modulation, often through post-translational modifications like phosphorylation.
