    "This problem requires determining the connectivity of the map `\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)`. A map `f: X \\to Y` is defined as *k*-connected if the induced homomorphism `f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)` is an isomorphism for all `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of `f` being `(k-1)`-connected.\n\nFirst, let's determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain spaces.\n\n### Connectivity of the Domain and Codomain\n\n1.  **Loop Spaces:**\n    *   A sphere `S^n` is `(n-1)`-connected, meaning its homotopy groups `\\pi_k(S^n)` are trivial for `k < n`.\n    *   The loop space `\\Omega S^n` has homotopy groups `\\pi_k(\\Omega S^n) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(S^n)`.\n    *   For `\\Omega S^4`, `\\pi_k(\\Omega S^4) = 0` for `k+1 < 4`, so for `k < 3`. This means `\\Omega S^4` is 2-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is `\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) \\cong \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}`.\n    *   For `\\Omega S^6`, `\\pi_k(\\Omega S^6) = 0` for `k+1 < 6`, so for `k < 5`. This means `\\Omega S^6` is 4-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is `\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}`.\n\n2.  **Smash Product:**\n    *   There is a theorem in homotopy theory stating that if `X` is `p`-connected and `Y` is `q`-connected, then their smash product `X \\wedge Y` is `(p+q+1)`-connected.\n    *   For `X = \\Omega S^4` (`p=2`) and `Y = \\Omega S^6` (`q=4`), the smash product `\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6` is `(2 + 4 + 1) = 7`-connected.\n    *   The first non-trivial homotopy group is `\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)`, which is isomorphic to the tensor product of the first non-trivial homotopy groups of the factors: `\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes \\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\pi_4(S^4) \\otimes \\pi_6(S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}`.\n\n3.  **Suspension (the Domain):**\n    *   The suspension of a `k`-connected space is `(k+1)`-connected.\n    *   Since `\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6` is 7-connected, its suspension `\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)` is **8-connected**.\n    *   Its first non-trivial homotopy group is `\\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}`.\n\n4.  **Loop Space of a Smash Product (the Codomain):**\n    *   The smash product `S^4 \\wedge S^6` is homotopy equivalent to `S^{10}`.\n    *   The codomain is `\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}`.\n    *   Since `S^{10}` is 9-connected, its loop space `\\Omega S^{10}` is **8-connected**.\n    *   Its first non-trivial homotopy group is `\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}`.\n\n### Connectivity of the Map\n\nLet `\\phi: D \\to C` be our map, where `D = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)` and `C = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)`. Both `D` and `C` are 8-connected. Let `F_\\phi` be the homotopy fiber of `\\phi`. The connectivity of `\\phi` is `k` if `F_\\phi` is `(k-1)`-connected.\n\nFrom the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration `F_\\phi \\to D \\to C`:\n`... \\to \\pi_{i+1}(C) \\to \\pi_i(F_\\phi) \\to \\pi_i(D) \\to \\pi_i(C) \\to ...`\n\nSince `D` and `C` are 8-connected, `\\pi_i(D) = \\pi_i(C) = 0` for `i \\le 8`. This implies `\\pi_i(F_\\phi) = 0` for `i \\le 7`. So, the fiber `F_\\phi` is at least 7-connected, and the map `\\phi` is at least 8-connected.\n\nTo determine the precise connectivity, we must examine the map on the first non-trivial homotopy groups, which occurs in dimension 9:\n`\\phi_*: \\pi_9(D) \\to \\pi_9(C)`\n\nThis is a homomorphism `\\phi_*: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}`, so it is multiplication by some integer `d`. The connectivity of the map `\\phi` depends on this integer `d`.\n\nThe map `\\phi` is a specific instance of the Samelson product construction. A known result in homotopy theory (due to authors like Morisugi, generalizing work by James, Whitehead, and Samelson) states that this canonical map induces an isomorphism on the lowest non-trivial homotopy group. Therefore, the degree `d` of the map `\\phi_*` is `\\pm 1`.\n\nAssuming `\\phi_*` is an isomorphism on `\\pi_9`:\nThe long exact sequence around dimensions 8 and 9 looks like:\n`... \\to \\pi_9(D) \\xrightarrow{\\cong} \\pi_9(C) \\to \\pi_8(F_\\phi) \\to \\pi_8(D)=0 \\to ...`\n`... \\to \\pi_{10}(C) \\to \\pi_9(F_\\phi) \\to \\pi_9(D) \\xrightarrow{\\cong} \\pi_9(C) \\to ...`\n\nFrom the first snippet, exactness implies `\\pi_8(F_\\phi) = 0`.\nFrom the second snippet, exactness implies `\\pi_9(F_\\phi) = 0`.\n\nSo, the homotopy fiber `F_\\phi` has `\\pi_i(F_\\phi) = 0` for `i \\le 9`. This means `F_\\phi` is 9-connected.\nBy definition, if the homotopy fiber is `(k-1)`-connected, the map is `k`-connected. With `F_\\phi` being 9-connected, the map `\\phi` is **10-connected**.\n\nThis means that the map `\\phi_*: \\pi_i(\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\to \\pi_i(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6))` is an isomorphism for `i < 10` and a surjection for `i = 10`.\n\n<<<10>>>"
