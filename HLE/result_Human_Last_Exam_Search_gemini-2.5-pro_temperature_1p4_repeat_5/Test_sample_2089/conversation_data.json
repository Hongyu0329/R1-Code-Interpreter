    "In the Oscar-winning 1969 film *Midnight Cowboy*, the character Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman, seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while on a bus to Florida with Joe Buck (Jon Voight).\n\nThe poignant moment occurs near the end of the film. As a gravely ill Ratso sits on the bus, Joe pulls down the window shade to shield him from the sun. In a barely audible voice, Ratso says, \"Thanks, Joe.\" This quiet expression of gratitude is one of his final lines of dialogue before he passes away in his sleep on the journey, just as they are about to reach their destination. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\n<<<Midnight Cowboy>>>"
