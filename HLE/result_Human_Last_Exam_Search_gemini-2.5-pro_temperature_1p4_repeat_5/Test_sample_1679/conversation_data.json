    "The first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen was **An American in Paris** (1951).\n\nThe film features a lavish 17-minute ballet sequence that takes place in a stylized Parisian setting. One of the key backdrops in this dreamlike sequence is a recreation of the Place de la Concorde, which prominently features one of the two Luxor Obelisks. A model of the fountain from the Place de la Concorde was created for the production to help in planning the choreography and camera angles for this scene. While the majority of the film was shot on MGM studio lots in California, these elaborate sets were designed to evoke famous Parisian landmarks.\n\nSeveral other Best Picture winners were set in Paris, including:\n*   ***Wings*** **(1927):** This World War I drama, the very first Best Picture winner, includes scenes in Paris, notably a famous tracking shot in a nightclub. However, there is no evidence it depicts the Place de la Concorde.\n*   ***The Life of Emile Zola*** **(1937):** This biographical film is set in 19th-century Paris and covers the Dreyfus affair. While it depicts historical events that occurred in Paris, it does not feature the Luxor Obelisk.\n*   ***Gigi*** **(1958):** This musical, also directed by Vincente Minnelli, was partially filmed on location in Paris. A stylized version of the Place de la Concorde fountain, where the obelisk is located, appears in the film. However, *An American in Paris* predates it.\n*   ***Around the World in 80 Days*** **(1956):** While the film includes a stop in Paris, the specific scene of the balloon ascent was filmed on a studio backlot.\n\nNo Best Picture winner appears to have been filmed on location at the Luxor Temple in Egypt, which has the other obelisk. The first Egyptian film submitted for an Academy Award was *Cairo Station* in 1958, and no Egyptian film has ever won Best Picture. The 1963 film *Cleopatra*, which was partially filmed in Egypt and was nominated for Best Picture, featured epic sets of ancient Egypt but did not win the award.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
