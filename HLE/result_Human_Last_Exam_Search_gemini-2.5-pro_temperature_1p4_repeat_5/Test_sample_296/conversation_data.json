    "The number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is 21.\n\nThe Grigorchuk group, denoted by Γ, has a normal subgroup K of index 16 such that the quotient group Γ/K is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and the dihedral group of order 8, i.e., Γ/K ≅ C₂ × D₈. The order of this quotient group is 2 * 8 = 16.\n\nSubgroups of index 4 in Γ are in one-to-one correspondence with subgroups of index 4 in the quotient group Γ/K. A subgroup of index 4 in a group of order 16 is a subgroup of order 16/4 = 4. Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of subgroups of order 4 in C₂ × D₈.\n\nA group of order 4 is either cyclic (isomorphic to C₄) or a Klein four-group (isomorphic to C₂ × C₂). We need to count the number of subgroups of each type in C₂ × D₈.\n\n### Cyclic Subgroups of Order 4 (C₄)\nA cyclic subgroup of order 4 is generated by an element of order 4. An element (g, h) in C₂ × D₈ has order lcm(ord(g), ord(h)). For the order to be 4, we have the following possibilities for the orders of g ∈ C₂ and h ∈ D₈:\n*   ord(g) = 1 and ord(h) = 4. In C₂, only the identity (0) has order 1. In D₈, the elements of order 4 are r and r³. This gives the elements (0, r) and (0, r³). These two elements generate the same subgroup: {(0, e), (0, r), (0, r²), (0, r³)}. This is one subgroup.\n*   ord(g) = 2 and ord(h) = 4. In C₂, the element 1 has order 2. This gives the elements (1, r) and (1, r³). These two elements generate the same subgroup: {(0, e), (1, r), (0, r²), (1, r³)}. This is a second subgroup.\n\nThere are 4 elements of order 4, and since each C₄ subgroup contains φ(4) = 2 elements of order 4, there are 4/2 = 2 cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\n### Klein Four-Subgroups (C₂ × C₂)\nA Klein four-group is generated by two distinct, commuting elements of order 2. We can categorize these subgroups based on their projection onto the first component (C₂).\n\n1.  **Subgroups contained within {0} × D₈:** These are the C₂ × C₂ subgroups of D₈. The dihedral group D₈ has two such subgroups: {e, r², s, sr²} and {e, r², sr, sr³}. This gives **2** subgroups.\n\n2.  **Subgroups that project onto C₂:** These subgroups contain elements whose first component is 1. Such a subgroup H is generated by two commuting elements of order 2, not both of which are in {0} × D₈. These subgroups are of the form ⟨(0, h), (1, k)⟩, where h and k are commuting elements of order 2 in D₈. The number of such subgroups is equal to the number of ordered pairs (h, k) of commuting elements of order 2 in D₈.\n\n    The elements of order 2 in D₈ are r², s, sr, sr², sr³.\n    *   r² commutes with all 5 elements of order 2 (including itself).\n    *   s commutes with r², s, and sr².\n    *   sr commutes with r², sr, and sr³.\n    *   sr² commutes with r², s, and sr².\n    *   sr³ commutes with r², sr, and sr³.\n\n    The number of such ordered pairs (h, k) is:\n    *   If h = r², k can be any of the 5 elements.\n    *   If h = s, k can be one of 3 elements.\n    *   If h = sr, k can be one of 3 elements.\n    *   If h = sr², k can be one of 3 elements.\n    *   If h = sr³, k can be one of 3 elements.\n\n    The total number of such subgroups is 5 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = **17**.\n\nThe total number of C₂ × C₂ subgroups is 2 + 17 = 19.\n\n### Total Number of Subgroups of Index 4\nThe total number of subgroups of order 4 is the sum of the C₄ subgroups and the C₂ × C₂ subgroups.\nTotal subgroups = 2 (C₄) + 19 (C₂ × C₂) = 21.\n\n<<<21>>>"
