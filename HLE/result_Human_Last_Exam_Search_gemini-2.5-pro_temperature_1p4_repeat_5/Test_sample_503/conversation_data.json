    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$, that satisfy two inequalities:\n1.  $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le g \\circ f$\n2.  $f \\circ g \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$\n\nHere, $[k]$ denotes the finite ordinal $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$. The order on the hom-set $\\Delta([m], [n])$ is the pointwise order, meaning for parallel maps $h_1, h_2$, we have $h_1 \\le h_2$ if and only if $h_1(i) \\le h_2(i)$ for all $i$ in the domain.\n\nThe two conditions for the adjunction can be written explicitly:\n1.  For all $i \\in [m]$, $i \\le g(f(i))$.\n2.  For all $j \\in [n]$, $f(g(j)) \\le j$.\n\nThis set of conditions is equivalent to defining a Galois connection between the posets $([m], \\le)$ and $([n], \\le)$, where $f$ is the left adjoint and $g$ is the right adjoint. A pair of order-preserving maps $(f, g)$ forms a Galois connection if and only if for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, the following equivalence holds:\n$f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$.\n\nA map between lattices (such as the finite chains $[m]$ and $[n]$) is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (suprema). In a lattice, the join of the empty set is the bottom element. For $f: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint, it must therefore map the bottom element of $[m]$ to the bottom element of $[n]$. The bottom element of $[k]$ is 0. Thus, a map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and satisfies $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSimilarly, a map is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all meets (infima). The meet of the empty set is the top element. For $g: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a right adjoint, it must map the top element of $[n]$ to the top element of $[m]$. The top element of $[k]$ is $k$. Thus, a map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and satisfies $g(n) = m$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is therefore equal to the number of left adjoint maps from $$ to $$, which in turn is the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0)=0$. For the problem at hand, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n\nWe need to count the number of sequences $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ such that:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $f(0)$ is fixed, we only need to choose the values for $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$. This is a sequence of 23 numbers chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which contains 38 elements), with replacement, and the order is non-decreasing. This is a classic stars and bars problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ types with repetition allowed is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\nIn our case:\n*   The number of items to choose is $k = 23$ (the values for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$).\n*   The number of available types is $n = 38$ (the possible values $0, 1, \\dots, 37$).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\nNumber of adjunctions = $\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, one could count the number of right adjoints $g: \\to$, which are the order-preserving maps satisfying $g(37)=23$. This would require choosing 37 values for $g(0), \\dots, g(36)$ from the set $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$ (24 elements), leading to $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$, which is equal to $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe value of this binomial coefficient is:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot 37!} = 459,495,335,510,892,720$.\n\n<<<459495335510892720>>>"
