The approximate number of physical non-Clifford gates required to generate a single logical non-Clifford gate is on the order of hundreds to thousands for a distance-3 code and tens of thousands for a distance-5 code, assuming a high 1% physical gate error rate. The total number for a universal computer is dependent on the algorithm.
