    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, the character of Dr. Snaut is the one who discusses missing the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\nIn a conversation with the main character, Kris Kelvin, Snaut points out paper strips attached to an air vent. He explains that it was the deceased scientist Gibarian's idea to create a sound reminiscent of rustling leaves. Snaut mentions that he adopted the practice, and even the cynical Dr. Sartorius secretly has his own set of paper strips hidden in a closet. This longing for a simple, natural sound from their home planet highlights the profound sense of isolation and emotional distress experienced by the crew of the space station. While the script does not explicitly use the word \"ashamed,\" Sartorius's act of hiding the paper strips suggests a sense of embarrassment or shame about this nostalgic and seemingly sentimental behavior. Snaut, however, is open about adopting Gibarian's method for coping with the sterile environment of the station.\n\n<<<C>>>"
