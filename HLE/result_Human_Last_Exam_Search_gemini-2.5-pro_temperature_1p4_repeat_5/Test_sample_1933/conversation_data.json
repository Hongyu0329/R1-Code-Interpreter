    "The problem asks for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the set of first-order formulas $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where the schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let these predicates be $P_1, P_2, P_3,$ and $P_4$.\n\n### 1. Characterizing the Definable Sets\n\nThe VC dimension is a property of a collection of subsets of a universe (a \"concept class\"). In this context, the concepts are the sets of elements defined by the formulas in the given logic. We consider formulas with one free variable, say $x$. The logic is constructed using only the existential quantifier ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), true ($\\top$), and false ($\\bot$).\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic will have the general form:\n$\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula built using only conjunction, true, and false. This means $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas.\n\nThe atomic formulas in the schema $S$ are of the form $P_i(z)$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, where $z$ is a variable. The formula $\\psi$ can be separated into a part that involves the free variable $x$ and a part that only involves the existentially quantified variables $y_j$:\n$\\psi(x, \\bar{y}) = \\alpha(x) \\land \\beta(\\bar{y})$\nwhere $\\alpha(x)$ is a conjunction of atoms involving $x$ (e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$), and $\\beta(\\bar{y})$ is a conjunction of atoms involving the variables in $\\bar{y}$.\n\nThe full formula is thus equivalent to:\n$\\alpha(x) \\land (\\exists \\bar{y} \\beta(\\bar{y}))$\n\nThe subformula $\\exists \\bar{y} \\beta(\\bar{y})$ is a sentence, meaning it has no free variables. For any given structure (database instance), this sentence is either true or false.\n*   If $\\exists \\bar{y} \\beta(\\bar{y})$ is true for the structure, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\alpha(x)$.\n*   If $\\exists \\bar{y} \\beta(\\bar{y})$ is false, the formula is equivalent to $\\bot$ (false), defining the empty set.\n\nThe formula $\\alpha(x)$ is a conjunction of the available atomic formulas concerning $x$, i.e., $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nThe case $I = \\emptyset$ corresponds to an empty conjunction, which is equivalent to $\\top$ (true), defining the entire universe.\n\nTherefore, the collection of sets definable by the logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is composed of:\n1.  The empty set (defined by $\\bot$).\n2.  Sets that are intersections of the extensions of the four base predicates $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. Let the extension of $P_i$ be the set $S_i$. The definable sets are of the form $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$ for all $2^4 = 16$ possible subsets $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThis forms a concept class, and we now determine its VC dimension.\n\n### 2. Upper Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nThe number of distinct concepts (definable sets) in our class is at most the number of possible intersections, which is $2^4 = 16$.\nTo shatter a set of size $d$, a concept class must be able to realize all $2^d$ possible subsets of that set. If we want to shatter a set of size $d=5$, we would need to generate $2^5 = 32$ distinct subsets. Since our concept class contains at most 16 distinct sets, it is impossible to shatter a set of size 5. Therefore, the VC dimension must be less than 5.\nIn general, for $k$ unary predicates, the number of definable concepts is at most $2^k$, so the VC dimension is at most $k$. For this problem, $k=4$, so the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### 3. Lower Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must construct a specific structure and a set of 4 elements that can be shattered.\nLet the universe of our structure be the set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We need to define the extensions of our four predicates, $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$, on this universe.\nLet's define the extension of the predicate $P_i$ as the set $S_i = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$.\nThe concept class consists of all possible intersections of these four sets. Let's see if this class can shatter $X$.\nA concept is of the form $C_I = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$ for some $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nSubstituting the definition of $S_i$:\n$C_I = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} (X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}) = X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\{x_i\\}$\n\nWe need to show that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists an index set $I$ such that $Y = C_I$.\nLet $Y$ be an arbitrary subset of $X$. Consider its complement, $X \\setminus Y$. The complement is also a subset of $X$. Let the indices of the elements in the complement be $I_Y = \\{i \\mid x_i \\in X \\setminus Y\\}$.\nIf we choose $I = I_Y$, the resulting concept is:\n$C_{I_Y} = X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I_Y} \\{x_i\\} = X \\setminus (X \\setminus Y) = Y$\n\nSince we can form any subset $Y$ of $X$ by choosing the appropriate intersection of the base concepts, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered.\nThis establishes that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the results:\n*   The VC dimension is at most 4.\n*   The VC dimension is at least 4.\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with 4 unary predicates is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
