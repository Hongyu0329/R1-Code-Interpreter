    "A finite group that contains a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 must be isomorphic to one of the following six groups: the cyclic group of order 3 ($C_3$), the cyclic group of order 4 ($C_4$), the cyclic group of order 5 ($C_5$), the Klein four-group ($C_2 \\times C_2$), the symmetric group of degree 3 ($S_3$), or the dihedral group of order 10 ($D_{10}$).\n\nA set S within a group G is defined as product-free if for any two elements a and b in S (including the case where a and b are the same element), their product ab is not an element of S. A product-free set is considered maximal by inclusion, or locally maximal, if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups that possess such sets of size 2 was established by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. Their work is detailed in the paper \"Groups Containing Small Locally Maximal Product-Free Sets.\" While the full contents of this specific paper are not readily available, a subsequent paper by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart, which builds upon this work, explicitly states the classification.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly six finite groups that have maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\n<<<6>>>"
