In the CCSD method, the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are identically zero for all excited Slater determinants $|\Phi_I\rangle$ that are **quintuply excited, sextuply excited, and all higher levels of excitation.**

This is because the electronic Hamiltonian ($H$) contains at most two-body interactions, and the CCSD cluster operator ($T=T_1+T_2$) includes only single and double excitations. Due to this, the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\bar{H} = e^{-T} H e^{T}$, can create a maximum of four particle-hole pairs when acting upon the reference determinant $|\Phi\rangle$. Consequently, the resulting state vector $\bar{H}|\Phi\rangle$ has no components in the space of determinants with five or more excitations, causing the matrix elements with these states to be zero. The matrix elements for triply and quadruply excited determinants, however, are generally not zero, and their approximate treatment forms the basis for methods like CCSD(T).
