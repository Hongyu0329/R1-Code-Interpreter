The effective electron-electron interaction potential, $V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\omega_n)$, mediated by phonons, for a given momentum transfer **q** and Matsubara frequency $i\omega_n$, is obtained by integrating out the phonon fields. The resulting interaction potential is:

$ V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\omega_n) = - \frac{g^2}{m} \sum_j \frac{q_j^2}{\omega_n^2 + w_q^2} $

**Derivation steps:**

1.  **Formulation**: The problem is approached by calculating the change in the electronic action after integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom in the path integral formulation of the partition function.
2.  **Gaussian Integration**: The Hamiltonian is quadratic in the phonon creation and annihilation operators, which leads to a Gaussian integral over the phonon fields. This integral can be solved exactly.
3.  **Effective Action**: Integrating out the phonons results in an effective action for the electrons, which includes a new term corresponding to the phonon-mediated interaction. This term is second order in the electron-phonon coupling constant.
4.  **Phonon Propagator**: The calculation involves the phonon propagator (or Green's function) in imaginary time. The specific form of the interaction term requires the propagator for the operator $ a_{\mathbf{q},j} + a_{-\mathbf{q},j}^\dagger $, which in Matsubara frequency space is $ D(q, i\omega_n) = \frac{2\omega_q}{\omega_n^2 + \omega_q^2} $.
5.  **Interaction Potential**: The effective interaction potential $ V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\omega_n) $ is identified as the coefficient of the $\rho_{\mathbf{q}} \rho_{-\mathbf{q}}$ term in the resulting effective Hamiltonian.

This interaction is attractive (indicated by the negative sign) and frequency-dependent. The dependence on $ \omega_n $ reflects the retarded nature of the interaction: one electron polarizes the lattice, and a second electron feels the effect of this polarization at a later time. In the static limit ($ \omega_n = 0 $), the interaction strength is inversely proportional to the square of the phonon frequency, $ V_{eff} \propto -1/w_q^2 $.
