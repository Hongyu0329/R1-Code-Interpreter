    "### Functional Dependence of the Bare Green's Function on Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, exhibits a direct and fundamental functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This relationship becomes most apparent when the Green's function is expressed in frequency-momentum space.\n\nThe two-point Green's function, or propagator, is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators. In the path integral formulation, this is expressed as a functional integral over all possible field configurations. For a non-interacting theory, which describes \"bare\" particles, the Green's function is denoted as G₀.\n\nWhile the path integral provides a powerful framework, the explicit dependence on energy eigenvalues is most clearly seen through its spectral representation. The path integral formulation is equivalent to the standard operator formalism where the propagator can be expressed as a sum over a complete set of energy eigenstates.\n\nFor a non-interacting system, the Hamiltonian can be written in terms of creation and annihilation operators and the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, where 'k' represents the momentum and other quantum numbers. By performing a Fourier transform from real space and time to momentum and frequency (ω) space, we obtain the bare Green's function.\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function, G₀(k, ω), on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is given by:\n\n**For Fermions:**\n\n*G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iδ*sign(ϵ_k - μ))*\n\nand **for Bosons:**\n\n*G₀(k, ω) = 1 / ((ħω)² - (ϵ_k)² + iδ)*\n\nwhere:\n*   `G₀(k, ω)` is the bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space.\n*   `ω` is the frequency.\n*   `ϵ_k` is the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state with momentum k.\n*   `μ` is the chemical potential, which for many systems at zero temperature is equivalent to the Fermi energy. The term `ϵ_k - μ` represents the energy of the state relative to the Fermi level.\n*   `δ` is a positive infinitesimal quantity that ensures the proper time-ordering and convergence of the Fourier transform. Its sign is determined by the sign of `ϵ_k - μ` for fermions, indicating whether a particle or a hole is being created.\n\nThis expression shows that the bare Green's function has poles in the complex frequency plane at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. The location of these poles dictates the propagation characteristics of the bare particles. Therefore, the functional dependence is that of an inverse linear relationship in frequency and energy for fermions, and an inverse quadratic relationship for bosons.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, in frequency-momentum space, is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (times Planck's constant) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue, ϵ_k. For fermions, this is typically expressed as G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iδ'), where δ' is an infinitesimal term that depends on whether the state is above or below the Fermi level.>>>"
