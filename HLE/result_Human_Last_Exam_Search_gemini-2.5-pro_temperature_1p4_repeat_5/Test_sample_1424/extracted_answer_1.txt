In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, in frequency-momentum space, is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (times Planck's constant) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue, ϵ_k. For fermions, this is typically expressed as G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iδ'), where δ' is an infinitesimal term that depends on whether the state is above or below the Fermi level.
