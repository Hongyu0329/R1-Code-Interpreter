    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (State Museums in Berlin) in 1967. The acquisition was a purchase from the artist's widow, Maria Günther, from Gera. The painting is part of the collection of the Nationalgalerie (National Gallery), which is one of the museums under the umbrella of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (Petty Bourgeois at the Radio), was created in 1927 and is a notable work of the New Objectivity movement in Germany. It depicts a man, identified as a certain Mr. Schreck who was a lodger in Günther's house, listening to the radio. The artwork is considered a commentary on the burgeoning radio culture of the Weimar Republic.\n\n<<<Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
