    "The sequence provided is: 1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352.\n\nUpon investigation, a key property of these numbers is that they are all **abundant numbers**. An abundant number is a positive integer for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Their sum is 16, which is greater than 12, so 12 is an abundant number.\n\nLet's test the last number in the sequence:\nThe proper divisors of 2352 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 21, 24, 28, 42, 48, 49, 56, 84, 98, 112, 147, 168, 196, 294, 336, 392, 588, 784, and 1176. The sum of these divisors is 4571, which is greater than 2352, confirming it is an abundant number.\n\nThe provided sequence appears to be a subsequence of abundant numbers. To find the next number in the sequence, we need to find the next abundant number after 2352. Let's check the numbers immediately following 2352:\n\n*   **2353:** This is a prime number, so its only proper divisor is 1. The sum is 1, which is less than 2353, making it a deficient number.\n*   **2354:** The proper divisors are 1, 2, 11, 107, 214, and 1177. Their sum is 1512, which is less than 2354, so it is deficient.\n*   **2355:** The proper divisors are 1, 3, 5, 157, 471, and 785. Their sum is 1422, which is less than 2355, so it is deficient.\n*   **2356:** The proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 19, 31, 38, 62, 76, 124, 589, and 1178. Their sum is 2124, which is less than 2356, so it is deficient.\n*   **2357:** This is a prime number, so it is deficient.\n*   **2358:** The proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 131, 262, 393, 786, and 1179. Their sum is 2780, which is greater than 2358. Therefore, 2358 is an abundant number.\n\nThe next abundant number after 2352 is 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
