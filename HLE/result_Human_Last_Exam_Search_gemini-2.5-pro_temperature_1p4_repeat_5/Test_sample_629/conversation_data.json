    "The minimal number of vertical and horizontal lines required for a grid diagram of a knot is called its grid number. For the trefoil knot, the minimal grid number is 3. The question asks for the number of unique grid diagrams for the *left-hand* trefoil knot on a grid of this minimal size.\n\nThere are two distinct minimal grid diagrams for the trefoil knot as a whole. One of these diagrams represents the right-handed trefoil, and the other, which is its mirror image, represents the left-handed trefoil. Therefore, for the left-hand trefoil knot specifically, there is only one minimal grid diagram when considering translations and rotations as equivalent.\n\n<<<A>>>"
