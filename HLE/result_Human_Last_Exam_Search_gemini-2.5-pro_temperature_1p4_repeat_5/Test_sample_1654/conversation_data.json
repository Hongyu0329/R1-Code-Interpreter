    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's greatcoat serve as a powerful symbol for his vacillating and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes the state of the coat in five distinct instances, each time reflecting a shift in Otchumyelov's approach to the situation based on the perceived social status of the dog's owner.\n\nThe descriptions of the coat are as follows:\n*   **Initial Appearance:** At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is described as wearing a new overcoat, which establishes his air of official authority.\n*   **First Change:** When a member of the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov immediately feels hot and orders his policeman, Yeldyrin, to help him take off his coat. This signifies his panic and his desire to shed his official severity in the face of a potentially powerful individual.\n*   **Second Change:** Upon being told that the dog does not belong to the General, Otchumyelov's demeanor changes again, and he has his coat put back on, reflecting his restored sense of authority.\n*   **Third Change:** This renewed confidence is short-lived. When the General's cook reveals that the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother, Otchumyelov once again shifts his stance, and analyses of the story note that he again removes his coat.\n*   **Final Action:** At the conclusion of the incident, Otchumyelov wraps his greatcoat around himself before marching off, a final gesture of him cloaking himself in his authority after the confusing episode.\n\nThese repeated actions of taking the coat off and putting it back on are a visual representation of his \"chameleon-like\" nature, as his principles and enforcement of the law change colors depending on the social standing of those involved.\n\n<<<5>>>"
