    "I have been unable to definitively identify the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 from the available search results.\n\nWhile historical records confirm that Bártfa, as a free royal town, had a judge (richtár) and a town council in the 15th century, and a document from 1461 even mentions a dispute involving the town's judge, the specific name of the individual holding that office in that year is not present in the searched materials.\n\nAcademic publications that likely contain this information have been identified, such as Mária Fedorčáková's \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" and Stanisław Andrzej Sroka's \"Bardejovskí richtári v XV. storočí\" (Bardejov Judges in the 15th Century). Reviews and descriptions of these works indicate that they contain lists of the town's officials. However, the full text of these books is not accessible through the available tools, and therefore the name of the judge for the specific year of 1461 cannot be provided at this time.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the answer to your question.>>>"
