The appropriate set M is a closed ball of radius R in the space of continuous functions on the interval that satisfy the boundary conditions. Specifically, the set M is defined as:

**M = {u ∈ C() | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and ||u||_∞ ≤ R}**

where:
*   **C()** is the Banach space of all continuous functions on the interval.
*   The condition **u(0) = u(1) = 0** ensures that any function in the set satisfies the problem's boundary conditions.
*   **||u||_∞** is the supremum norm, defined as ||u||_∞ = sup_{x∈} |u(x)|. The space of continuous functions satisfying the boundary conditions, equipped with this norm, is a complete metric space.
*   **R** is a positive constant. Its value must be chosen to ensure that the operator T is a contraction mapping on M. This requires satisfying two conditions derived from the properties of T:
    1.  **T maps M to M (T(M) ⊆ M):** This leads to the condition ||Tu||_∞ ≤ R, which simplifies to **exp(R)/8 ≤ R**.
    2.  **T is a contraction on M:** The Lipschitz constant for T on M is L = exp(R)/8. For T to be a contraction, we need L < 1, which implies **exp(R)/8 < 1**, or **R < ln(8)**.

Any positive constant R that satisfies both `exp(R)/8 ≤ R` and `R < ln(8)` (for example, R=1) will define a valid set M on which the Banach fixed-point theorem can be applied to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the solution.
