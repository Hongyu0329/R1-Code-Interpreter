    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\nThis result is based on the fundamental principle that the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational conjugacy classes of maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure. For a split group of type $E_8$, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group. Consequently, the $F$-conjugacy classes are identical to the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of $E_8$.\n\nThe Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$, is a finite group of order 696,729,600. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed to be 112. Therefore, the number of distinct $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in $G$ is precisely this number.\n\n<<<112>>>"
