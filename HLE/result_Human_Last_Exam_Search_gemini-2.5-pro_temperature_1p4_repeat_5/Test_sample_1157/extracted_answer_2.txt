### Comprehensive Management of a Complex Dental Trauma Case

This report outlines the specific procedures for the appropriate management of a sub-Saharan African woman who is obese, has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and sustained dental trauma resulting in the loss of her left lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar. The management plan considers a 28-hour delay in seeking treatment and a skeletal Class III malocclusion, as indicated by an SNB angle of 88Â°.

#### **Immediate and Definitive Management Plan**

Given the complex interplay of traumatic injury, delayed presentation, and significant systemic and skeletal factors, a phased approach to treatment is essential.

**Phase 1: Systemic Health Optimization and Acute Dental Care**

1.  **Medical Consultation and Diabetes Management:** The patient's glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7.5% indicates poor glycemic control. This is a primary concern as hyperglycemia impairs wound healing, compromises immune function, and increases the risk of post-procedural infections. Therefore, the first step is a referral to or consultation with a physician to optimize her glycemic control. Dental treatment, especially any surgical or invasive procedures, should ideally be postponed until her HbA1c is below 7%, although urgent care can be undertaken with precautions. Her obesity is a contributing factor to her diabetes and overall health, and counseling on diet and lifestyle should be part of her long-term medical management.

2.  **Management of Avulsed Teeth Sockets:** Due to the 28-hour extra-oral time, the periodontal ligament (PDL) cells on the roots of the avulsed teeth are non-viable. Therefore, replantation of the avulsed teeth is not a predictable long-term solution and is likely to result in ankylosis (fusion of the root to the bone) and inflammatory root resorption.
    *   **Decision Against Replantation:** The primary goal is to preserve the alveolar bone for future prosthetic replacement. For this reason, delayed replantation is ill-advised as it often fails and can complicate future treatments.
    *   **Socket Debridement and Care:** The empty sockets should be gently irrigated with sterile saline to remove any debris and blood clots. Aggressive curettage of the socket walls should be avoided to preserve any remaining viable cells and bone.
    *   **Suturing and Healing:** Any soft tissue lacerations should be sutured. The patient should be prescribed a chlorhexidine mouth rinse (0.12%) to be used twice daily for a week to reduce the risk of infection, which is elevated due to her diabetic status. Systemic antibiotics may also be considered due to the contamination of the wound and her compromised immune status.

**Phase 2: Prosthetic Rehabilitation**

Once the patient's diabetes is better controlled and the soft tissues have healed (typically after a few weeks to months), the focus will shift to replacing the missing teeth. Given the skeletal Class III malocclusion (prognathic mandible), obesity, and financial considerations often present in such cases, a **removable partial denture (RPD)** is the most appropriate choice.

**Denture Type and Material:**

*   **Denture Type:** A **removable partial denture** is indicated. Specifically, a tooth-and-tissue-supported design would be utilized for the edentulous space created by the loss of the lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar (a Kennedy Class III situation).
*   **Material:** A **flexible partial denture** made from a thermoplastic material like nylon (e.g., Valplast) would be the preferred material.
    *   **Reasons for Material Choice:**
        *   **Comfort and Aesthetics:** Flexible dentures are more comfortable and less irritating to the gums than traditional rigid acrylic dentures. They are metal-free, which is an advantage if the patient has any metal sensitivities, and they offer a more natural appearance as the clasps are typically made of a pink, gum-colored material.
        *   **Durability and Fit:** They are less prone to breakage if dropped and their flexibility allows for a snug fit.
        *   **Suitability for Diabetic Patients:** Studies have shown that flexible partial dentures can improve the quality of life and result in higher bite forces compared to traditional acrylic dentures in diabetic patients, indicating better function and comfort.

**Abutment Teeth and Rationale:**

The selection of abutment teeth (the teeth that support the denture) is critical for the stability and longevity of the prosthesis.

*   **Primary Abutments:**
    *   **Left Central Incisor:** This tooth will serve as an abutment anterior to the edentulous space.
    *   **Left Second Premolar:** This tooth will be the primary abutment posterior to the edentulous space. It is a strong tooth and well-suited to provide support.
*   **Secondary Abutments (for added stability):**
    *   **Right Central and Lateral Incisors, and Canine:** To counteract the forces on the left side and to provide cross-arch stabilization, clasps and rests will likely be placed on some of the contralateral anterior teeth. This is especially important in a Class III bite where anterior forces can be significant. The canine on
