    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we first need to understand the structure of these characters.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if its conductor is exactly $N$.\nIf the prime factorization of $N$ is $N = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$, then any character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i^{k_i}$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$.\n\nThe character $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{k_i}$.\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters, i.e., $\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{order}(\\chi_1), \\text{order}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{order}(\\chi_r))$.\n\nWe are given $N = 36036$. First, we find its prime factorization:\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\nSo, a primitive character $\\chi$ of conductor $36036$ has the form $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where each $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a primitive character with conductor $p^k$.\n\nWe need the order of $\\chi$ to be $6$. This means:\n1.  The order of each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ must divide $6$.\n2.  The least common multiple of the orders of the component characters must be exactly $6$.\n\nLet's analyze the number of choices for each primitive component character:\n\n**1. Conductor 4 ($2^2$):**\nThe group of units modulo 4 is $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. The character group is also isomorphic to $C_2$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this character is a valid choice.\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1. The order is 2.\n\n**2. Conductor 9 ($3^2$):**\nThe group of units modulo 9 is $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The character group is also isomorphic to $C_6$. The primitive characters modulo 9 are those that are not characters modulo 3. There are $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$ such characters. The orders of elements in $C_6$ are divisors of 6. The non-primitive characters (those from mod 3) have orders 1 and 2. Thus, the primitive characters must have orders 3 or 6.\n-   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n-   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\nBoth orders (3 and 6) divide 6. So, there are $2+2=4$ choices for $\\chi_9$. The order of $\\chi_9$ will be 3 or 6.\n\n**3. Conductor 7:**\nThe group of units modulo 7 is $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character is primitive modulo a prime $p$ if it is not the principal character (the character that is always 1). The orders of the non-principal characters are the divisors of $\\phi(7)=6$, other than 1. These orders are 2, 3, and 6. All of these divide 6.\n-   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n-   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n-   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\nTotal choices for $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n**4. Conductor 11:**\nThe group of units modulo 11 is $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The primitive characters have orders that are divisors of 10, other than 1. We need the order to divide 6. The only divisor of both 10 and 6 (other than 1) is 2.\n-   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\nSo there is only 1 choice for $\\chi_{11}$. The order is 2.\n\n**5. Conductor 13:**\nThe group of units modulo 13 is $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. We need primitive characters whose order divides 6. The possible orders are the divisors of 12 that also divide 6. These are 2, 3, and 6.\n-   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n-   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n-   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\nTotal choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\nLet the orders of the component characters be $k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13}$. We need to ensure that $\\text{lcm}(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13}) = 6$.\nFrom our analysis:\n-   $k_4 = 2$.\n-   $k_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$.\n-   $k_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n-   $k_{11} = 2$.\n-   $k_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nThe lcm of these orders must be divisible by 2 and 3.\n-   Divisibility by 2: Since $k_4=2$ (and $k_{11}=2$), the lcm is always divisible by 2.\n-   Divisibility by 3: For any choice of $\\chi_9$, its order $k_9$ is either 3 or 6. In both cases, the order is divisible by 3. Thus, the lcm is always divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6. Also, since all individual orders divide 6, their lcm must divide 6. Therefore, the order of the resulting character $\\chi$ is exactly 6 for any combination of the chosen component characters.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of characters = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nNumber = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nThere are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\n\n<<<100>>>"
