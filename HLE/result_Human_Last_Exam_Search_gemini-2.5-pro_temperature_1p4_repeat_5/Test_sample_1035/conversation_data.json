    "My initial analysis was flawed. The search results show a crucial distinction I missed. The problem of covering the edges of K_n can be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1.  **Covering with arbitrary bipartite subgraphs:** The minimum number of graphs needed for this is `ceil(log2(n))`. This is because we can assign a unique binary vector of length `k = ceil(log2(n))` to each of the `n` vertices. For each position `i` from 1 to `k`, we can create a bipartite graph `B_i` where the two sets of the partition are the vertices with a 0 at position `i` and those with a 1 at position `i`. Any two vertices must differ in at least one bit position, so the edge connecting them will be in the corresponding bipartite graph. This shows that `ceil(log2(n))` graphs are sufficient. The necessity of this many graphs is also proven.\n\n2.  **Partitioning (or covering) with *complete* bipartite subgraphs (bicliques):** The minimum number required is `n-1`. This is the famous result by Graham and Pollak (1971, 1972). Tverberg later (1982) proved that the same `n-1` bound holds even if the bipartite graphs are not required to be complete, but the covering must be a *partition* (edge-disjoint).\n\nMy earlier argument that a covering can be transformed into a partition of the same size was correct. Any covering with k bipartite graphs can be turned into an edge-disjoint partition into at most k bipartite graphs. This implies that the minimum number for a covering is the same as for a partition.\n\nThe core of the issue is what the question implies by \"family of bipartite graphs\". Does it mean *any* bipartite subgraph, or must the subgraphs be *complete* bipartite (bicliques)?\n\n*   If the question means covering with **complete bipartite graphs**, the answer is `n-1`.\n*   If the question means covering with **any bipartite graphs**, the answer is `ceil(log2(n))`.\n\nThe standard interpretation of \"bipartite covering number\" or \"bipartite dimension\" refers to covering with *complete bipartite* subgraphs, for which the answer is `ceil(log2(n))`. However, the Graham-Pollak theorem and its generalization by Tverberg refer to partitioning the edge set, and the result is `n-1`.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction in the literature or, more likely, a subtle difference in terminology. Let's re-examine the results.\n- **`bp(G)`**: Biclique partition number. `bp(K_n) = n-1`. This means partitioning edges into *complete bipartite* graphs.\n- **`bc(G)`**: Biclique covering number. `bc(K_n) = ceil(log2(n))`. This means covering edges with *complete bipartite* graphs.\n- **Biparticity `beta(G)`**: Minimum number of bipartite graphs to cover G. `beta(G) = ceil(log2(chi(G)))`. For `K_n`, the chromatic number `chi(K_n) = n`, so `beta(K_n) = ceil(log2(n))`.\n\nThe conflict arises from the term \"bipartite graph\". In the context of Graham-Pollak, they consider partitions into *complete* bipartite graphs. Tverberg's generalization is for partitions into *general* bipartite graphs. My earlier proof that `covering number = partitioning number` seems to hold.\n\nSo, where is the discrepancy? Let's trace the logic of `ceil(log2(n))`.\nLet `k = ceil(log2(n))`. Label vertices `v_1, ..., v_n` with distinct binary vectors of length `k`. For each position `j=1...k`, create a bipartite graph `H_j` by partitioning the vertices into `U_j = {v | j-th bit is 0}` and `V_j = {v | j-th bit is 1}`. An edge `(u,v)` exists in `H_j` if `u` is in `U_j` and `v` is in `V_j`. If we make `H_j` a *complete* bipartite graph `K_{U_j, V_j}`, then the set `{H_1, ..., H_k}` covers all edges of `K_n`. This is a covering with `k` complete bipartite graphs. This establishes `bc(K_n) <= ceil(log2(n))`. This is a covering, not a partition.\n\nNow consider the Graham-Pollak theorem: `bp(K_n) = n-1`. This is for *partitioning*. It seems my argument that `bc(G) = bp(G)` is wrong. Let's reconsider.\nIf we have a covering `{H_1, ..., H_k}`, we define `H'_i = H_i \\ (union_{j<i} E(H_j))`. `{H'_i}` is a partition. If `H_i` are *complete* bipartite graphs, `H'_i` are subgraphs of them, and thus are just bipartite, but not necessarily *complete* bipartite. So, a covering with `k` *complete* bipartite graphs can be turned into a partition into `k` *bipartite* graphs.\nTherefore, `bp_{bipartite}(K_n) <= bc_{complete_bipartite}(K_n)`.\nWe know from Tverberg that `bp_{bipartite}(K_n) = n-1`. And we know `bc_{complete_bipartite}(K_n) = ceil(log2(n))`.\nThis implies `n-1 <= ceil(log2(n))`, which is false for `n > 2`.\n\nThere is a fundamental misunderstanding. Let's reset.\n\n- **Problem 1: Partition into complete bipartite graphs.** Minimum number is `n-1` (Graham-Pollak). Let's call this `bp_C(K_n)`.\n- **Problem 2: Partition into general bipartite graphs.** Minimum number is `n-1` (Tverberg). Let's call this `bp_B(K_n)`.\n- **Problem 3: Cover with complete bipartite graphs (bicliques).** Minimum number is `ceil(log2(n))`. Let's call this `bc_C(K_n)`.\n- **Problem 4: Cover with general bipartite graphs.** The minimum number is `ceil(log2(chi(K_n))) = ceil(log2(n))`. Let's call this `bc_B(K_n)`.\n\nThe question is, \"What is the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph K_n\". The phrasing \"number of vertices in a family\" is almost certainly a slightly awkward way of asking for the number of graphs in the family, i.e., the size of the covering. The problem is about **covering** with **bipartite graphs**. This corresponds to Problem 4.\n\nThe minimum number of bipartite subgraphs needed to cover the edges of a graph G is `ceil(log2(chi(G)))`, where `chi(G)` is the chromatic number of G.\nFor the complete graph `K_n`, the chromatic number is `n`.\nSo, the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover `K_n` is `ceil(log2(n))`.\n\nLet's check for n=35.\n`log2(35)`\n`2^5 = 32`\n`2^6 = 64`\nSo, `log2(35)` is between 5 and 6.\nTherefore, `ceil(log2(35)) = 6`.\n\nThe confusion between `n-1` and `log2(n)` is a classic one and depends critically on whether the decomposition is a partition or a covering, and in some older literature, the distinction between complete bipartite and general bipartite subgraphs was not always clear. However, modern sources clearly distinguish between these problems. Covering is less constrained than partitioning, so it's expected to require fewer graphs (`log2(n)` vs `n-1`).\n\nFor n = 35, the number is `ceil(log2(35))`.\n`log2(35) â‰ˆ 5.129`\n`ceil(5.129) = 6`.\n\nFinal check: The question is about the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed for a *covering*. This is `ceil(log2(n))`. The result `n-1` is for an edge-disjoint *partition*. As any partition is a covering, `n-1` is an upper bound, but `ceil(log2(n))` is the tight bound for covering.\n\n<<<6>>>"
