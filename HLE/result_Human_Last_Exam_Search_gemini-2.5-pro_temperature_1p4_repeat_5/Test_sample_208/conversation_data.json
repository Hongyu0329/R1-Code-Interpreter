    "For fourteen circles of radius one to be tightly packed into a larger circle, the radius of the containing circle is approximately 4.275. This is a known problem in mathematics called \"circle packing in a circle\".\n\nThe solution for packing 14 circles has been proven to be optimal. The established arrangement for 14 circles shows that they are placed in a specific configuration to minimize the radius of the larger circle. One of the circles is at the center, surrounded by the other 13.\n\nAccording to extensive tables compiled on the subject, if the radius of the large container circle is 1, then the radius of each of the 14 smaller circles would be approximately 0.23394. To find the radius of the large circle when the small circles have a radius of one, we can take the reciprocal of this value.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\nRadius of the large circle = 1 / 0.2339399555... â‰ˆ 4.27461\n\nRounding this to four significant digits gives 4.275.\n\n<<<4.275>>>"
