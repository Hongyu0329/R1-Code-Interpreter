    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the tanker **Monique**. The armistice, signed between France and Germany, went into effect on June 25, 1940.\n\nThe *Monique*, a steam tanker with a gross register tonnage of 7,011 tons, was sunk on June 22, 1940. The German submarine U-65, commanded by Hans-Gerrit von Stockhausen, torpedoed the unescorted tanker in the Bay of Biscay, approximately 70 miles southwest of Penmarch. The ship was en route from Haifa to Le Havre carrying a cargo of 10,000 tons of crude oil and was engulfed in flames before breaking in two and sinking.\n\nAnother French tanker, the *Brumaire*, with a slightly larger tonnage of 7,638 tons, was damaged by the German submarine U-25 on June 19, 1940. However, the *Brumaire* was ultimately sunk by German aircraft the following day off Belle-ÃŽle and therefore is not considered to be sunk solely by a U-boat.\n\nOther French naval losses to U-boats during this period, such as the submarine *Doris* sunk on May 8, 1940, involved vessels with a much smaller displacement.\n\n<<<Monique>>>"
