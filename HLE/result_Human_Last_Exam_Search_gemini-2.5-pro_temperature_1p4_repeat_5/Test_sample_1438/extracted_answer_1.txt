The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a number, but a definitional rule: integration is equivalent to differentiation (∫dη ≡ ∂/∂η). This leads to the fundamental results that ∫dη = 0 and ∫dη η = 1, which ensures the formalism is consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle.
