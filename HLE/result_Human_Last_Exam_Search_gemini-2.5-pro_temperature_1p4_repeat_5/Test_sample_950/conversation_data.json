    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 0.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **The Space in Question:** The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is known as the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted $G(3, 5)$. There is a diffeomorphism between $G(k, n)$ and $G(n-k, n)$, so $G(3, 5)$ is diffeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$. These two spaces, therefore, have isomorphic cohomology rings.\n\n2.  **Integral Cohomology and Torsion:** The integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is a graded ring where each group $H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is a finitely generated abelian group. Such a group can be split into a free part and a torsion part. The torsion subgroup of the entire ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts from each degree. It is a known result in algebraic topology that the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians often contains 2-torsion. For example, it is established that for the space in question, $H^1(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$, which means there is non-trivial torsion.\n\n3.  **Definition of Rank:** The rank of an abelian group, also known as the torsion-free rank, is the number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in its free part. More formally, it is the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset of the group. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the torsion abelian groups.\n\n4.  **The Torsion Subgroup:** The torsion subgroup of the cohomology ring is, by its very definition, a torsion group. This means that every element in this subgroup has a finite order.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the \"torsion subgroup\" is a torsion group, its free part is trivial. A group with a trivial free part has a rank of 0. Therefore, regardless of the precise structure of the torsion subgroup—a topic for which various computations exist in mathematical literature—its rank is unequivocally 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
