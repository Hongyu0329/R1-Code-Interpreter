    "In a 2008 guest performance in Novosibirsk, Siberia, while a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, Natalia Osipova performed the role of Kitri in *Don Quixote*. While videos of her Act I variation from this performance are available online, a precise count of the single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position cannot be definitively determined from the available search results.\n\nThe choreography for the Kitri variation in Act I is known for its technical difficulty, speed, and energetic style, which includes a series of challenging turns. However, without a visual analysis of the specific 2008 performance, an exact number of the requested pirouettes cannot be provided. Reviews and descriptions of Osipova's performance praise her remarkable leaps and fast turns but do not give a quantitative breakdown of her movements.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number based on the available information.>>>"
