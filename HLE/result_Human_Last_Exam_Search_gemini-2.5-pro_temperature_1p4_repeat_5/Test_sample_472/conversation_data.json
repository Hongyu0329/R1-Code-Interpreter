    "<<<L S L L | L S S S | L L | S S L | L L | S S>>>\n\nLet's break that down. Wait, my previous derivation was different. Let me re-derive based on the final format I've seen as most plausible.\n\nIambic Senarius (6 feet).\n1. **et ti-bi be-n(e)** | **es-se so-li** | **quom si-bi** | **sit ma-le**\nThis kind of word division is very unlikely. The feet should align somewhat with word structure.\n\nLet's try again with the most standard parsing. There are competing versions for this line because it is metrically complex. A very common interpretation is as follows:\n\n*   **Meter**: Iambic Senarius (six iambic feet, with substitutions).\n*   **Elision**: The final '-e' of `bene` is elided before the initial 'e-' of `esse`. The words are pronounced as `benesse`.\n*   **Resolution**: The first foot is resolved from an iamb (S L) into a tribrach (S S S).\n*   **Resolution**: The fifth foot is resolved from an iamb (S L) into an anapest (S S L).\n*   **Final foot**: The last foot is a trochee (L S), which is common.\n\nThe feet are divided as follows:\n\n1.  **et ti bi**: A tribrach (S S S) replacing an iamb.\n2.  **ben es**: An iamb (S L). (`ben` from `benesse` is short, `es` is long by position).\n3.  **se so**: An iamb (S L). (`se` from `benesse` is short, `so` from `soli` is long).\n4.  **li quom**: An iamb (S L). (`li` from `soli` is short, `quom` is long by position).\n5.  **si bi sit**: An anapest (S S L). (`si` and `bi` are short, `sit` is long by position).\n6.  **ma le**: A trochee (L S). (`ma` is long, `le` is short).\n\nPutting it all together:\nS S S | S L | S L | S L | S S L | L S\n\nThis translates to:\n`et ti bi` `ben es` `se so` `li quom` `si bi sit` `ma le`\n\nFinal Answer using 'L' and 'S':\n<<<S S S S L S L S L S S L L S>>>"
