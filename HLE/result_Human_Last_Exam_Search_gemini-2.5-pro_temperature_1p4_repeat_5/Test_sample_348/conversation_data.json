    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\n**1. Defining the Functions**\n\n*   **Supply:** P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)\n    *   For the supply function to be defined, the argument of the natural logarithm must be positive: Q_S³ - 2 > 0, which implies Q_S > ³√2 ≈ 1.26.\n*   **Demand:** P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))\n\n**2. Finding Market Equilibrium**\n\nMarket equilibrium occurs when quantity supplied (Q_S) equals quantity demanded (Q_D), and the price is the same. Let's denote the equilibrium quantity as Q_E and the equilibrium price as P_E.\n\nWe set the supply and demand equations equal to each other:\nln(Q_E³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))\n\nThis equation is transcendental and does not have a simple analytical solution. Therefore, a numerical method is required to find the equilibrium quantity, Q_E.\n\nUsing a numerical solver, we find the intersection of the two curves to be at:\n*   **Equilibrium Quantity (Q_E) ≈ 4.7954**\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium price (P_E) by substituting Q_E into either the supply or the demand function. Using the demand function:\n*   **Equilibrium Price (P_E)** = 18e^(-arctan(4.7954)) ≈ **4.5702**\n\n**3. Calculating Total Welfare**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS).\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from Q=0 to Q=Q_E.\n    CS = ∫[0 to Q_E] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - (P_E * Q_E)\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price, from the minimum supply quantity (³√2) to Q=Q_E.\n    PS = (P_E * Q_E) - ∫[³√2 to Q_E] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\n**Total Welfare (TW) = CS + PS**\n\nCombining these, the (P_E * Q_E) terms cancel out:\nTW = ∫[0 to Q_E] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - ∫[³√2 to Q_E] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\nThese definite integrals must also be calculated numerically.\n\n*   Value of the demand integral: ∫[0 to 4.7954] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ ≈ 35.0336\n*   Value of the supply integral: ∫[1.2599 to 4.7954] ln(Q³ - 2) dQ ≈ 12.0094\n\nSubtracting the value of the supply integral from the demand integral gives the total welfare:\nTW ≈ 35.0336 - 12.0094 ≈ 23.0242\n\n<<<23.02>>>"
