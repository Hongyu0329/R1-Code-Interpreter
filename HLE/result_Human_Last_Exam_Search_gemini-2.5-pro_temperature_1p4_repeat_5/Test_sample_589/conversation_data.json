    "After an extensive search, there is no major Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio that precisely matches the description of a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car.\n\nNumerous searches have been conducted using a variety of keywords and phrases to identify such a scene. These searches have explored different genres, including teen movies, comedies, dramas, and thrillers from various decades. The search results have included many discussions on film forums where users are trying to identify movies with similar themes, such as \"chicken\" scenes involving vehicles or accidents with bicycles.\n\nSome of the closest, though not exact, matches found include:\n\n*   **Gummo (1997):** This independent experimental film by director Harmony Korine features a character known as \"Bunny Boy\" who wears pink bunny ears. There are also other scenes with teenage boys riding bicycles. However, the specific scene of playing \"chicken\" with a car on a pink bike is not in the film.\n*   **Various \"coming-of-age\" films and comedies:** These genres sometimes feature scenes with bicycles as a comedic prop or as part of a dare. For instance, a Reddit thread mentions a user looking for a movie where a man running from someone grabs a small pink bike to get away, which is played for laughs. another thread on TikTok also shows a clip of a boy on a bike getting hit by a car, but not in the context of a dare.\n\nDespite a thorough investigation, the specific combination of a teenager, a pink bicycle, and a game of \"chicken\" with an oncoming car in a Hollywood feature film from a major studio does not appear to be a known cinematic scene based on the available data. It is possible the scene is from an independent film, a foreign film, a television show, or that the details of the memory are slightly inaccurate.\n\n<<<No such film has been identified.>>>"
