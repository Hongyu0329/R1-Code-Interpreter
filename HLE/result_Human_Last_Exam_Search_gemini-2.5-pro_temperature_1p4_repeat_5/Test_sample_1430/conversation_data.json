    "<<<Let C be a genus 3 Riemann surface and X its 15th symmetric power. The smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group, also known as the Picard number, measures the number of independent algebraic cycles of codimension 1 on a variety. For the 15th symmetric power X = Sym^15(C) of a genus g=3 curve C, the rank of its Néron-Severi group NS(X), denoted ρ(X), is related to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian variety of C, J(C). Since the degree n=15 is greater than or equal to 2g-1 = 5, there is a well-known isomorphism NS(X) ≅ NS(J(C)) ⊕ ℤ. This leads to the formula for the ranks: ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**Smallest Rank:**\nFor a generic curve C of genus 3, its Jacobian J(C) is a simple abelian variety with the minimal possible endomorphism ring, which is the ring of integers ℤ. In this case, the Néron-Severi group NS(J(C)) is generated by a single element, the class of the theta divisor. Thus, the Picard number is 1. This is the minimum possible rank for the Jacobian of a curve of genus g ≥ 2.\nThe smallest possible rank for NS(X) is therefore:\nρ_min(X) = ρ_min(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n**Largest Rank:**\nThe Picard number of an abelian variety of dimension g is bounded above by g². For J(C) of dimension g=3, this means ρ(J(C)) ≤ 9. This maximum is achieved if the Jacobian J(C) is of Complex Multiplication (CM) type. A principally polarized abelian variety of dimension 3 is always the Jacobian of a curve. There exist genus 3 curves whose Jacobians are of CM type and attain this maximal Picard number. A notable example is the Klein quartic curve, whose Jacobian is isogenous to the product of three copies of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication. For such a curve, ρ(J(C)) = 9.\nThe largest possible rank for NS(X) is therefore:\nρ_max(X) = ρ_max(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.>>>"
