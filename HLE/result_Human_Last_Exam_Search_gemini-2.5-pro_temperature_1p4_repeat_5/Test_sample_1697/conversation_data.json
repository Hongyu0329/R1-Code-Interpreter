    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by treatment with methyl iodide, yields N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\nThis transformation is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation reaction. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1.  **Directed Ortho-Metalation:** The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) on the benzamide is a potent directing metalating group (DMG). In the presence of the strong base sec-BuLi, a proton is selectively removed from the position ortho to this directing group. The sec-BuLi is a powerful organolithium reagent capable of deprotonating even weakly acidic C-H bonds on an aromatic ring. TMEDA acts as a ligand, coordinating to the lithium ion, which breaks down the multimeric aggregates of the organolithium reagent and enhances its basicity and reactivity.\n\n    The N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide has two potential directing groups: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide at position 1 and the dimethylamino group at position 3. The tertiary amide group is a significantly stronger directing group than the dimethylamino group. Therefore, deprotonation will occur at one of the positions ortho to the amide, which are C2 and C6. The dimethylamino group at C3 provides additional stabilization to the lithiation at the C2 position through chelation of the lithium ion, making the C2 proton the most acidic. The sec-BuLi will therefore selectively deprotonate the C2 position, forming a lithiated intermediate.\n\n2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting ortho-lithiated species is a potent nucleophile. In the second step of the reaction, this nucleophile attacks the electrophilic methyl iodide (CH₃I) in an Sₙ2 reaction. The lithium is replaced by a methyl group at the C2 position of the aromatic ring.\n\nThe final product obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
