    "A perfluoronanocar would hypothetically contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nThis calculation is based on the molecular formula of a specific, soluble version of the nanocar designed by Professor James Tour's group at Rice University. The chemical structure of this nanocar consists of an H-shaped chassis, four C60 fullerene wheels, and solubilizing sidechains.\n\nThe precise molecular formula for this variant is C430H274O12. The term \"perfluorinated\" indicates that all of the hydrogen (H) atoms in the molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms. The C60 fullerene wheels are all-carbon structures and contain no hydrogen atoms to be substituted. Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar would be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original molecule.\n\nGiven the formula C430H274O12, there are 274 hydrogen atoms. Replacing each of these with a fluorine atom results in a perfluoronanocar containing 274 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<274>>>"
