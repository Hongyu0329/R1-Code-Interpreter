    "The symmetry group of the molecule with the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is **D3h**.\n\nThe provided SMILES string represents the molecule **2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaethynyltriphenylene**. This molecule consists of a planar triphenylene core, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon composed of four fused benzene rings. Attached to this core are six ethynyl (-C≡CH) groups.\n\nTo determine the symmetry group, we analyze the symmetry elements of the molecule, assuming a planar conformation which is the most stable due to π-conjugation:\n\n*   **Identity (E):** The molecule itself.\n*   **Principal Axis of Rotation (C₃):** There is a threefold axis of rotation passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its plane. A rotation of 120° (360°/3) about this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n*   **Perpendicular Twofold Axes of Rotation (3C₂):** There are three twofold axes of rotation that lie in the plane of the molecule. Each of these axes passes through the center of the molecule and the midpoints of the bonds connecting the outer rings. A 180° rotation about any of these axes leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σh):** The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane. Reflection through this plane does not change the molecule's appearance.\n*   **Improper Rotation Axes (2S₃):** Coincident with the C₃ axis, there are two threefold improper rotation axes. This operation involves a rotation of 120° followed by a reflection through the horizontal plane.\n*   **Vertical Mirror Planes (3σv):** There are three vertical mirror planes that contain the principal C₃ axis and each of the C₂ axes.\n\nThe presence of a principal C₃ axis along with three perpendicular C₂ axes indicates a dihedral group (D). The addition of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) confirms that the point group is **D3h**. Molecules like boron trifluoride (BF₃) also belong to the D3h point group, exhibiting a similar trigonal planar geometry.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
