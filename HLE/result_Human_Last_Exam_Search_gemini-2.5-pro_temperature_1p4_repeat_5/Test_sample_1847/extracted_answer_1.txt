The analytical solution for the density profile \(\rho(x)\) in units of the ambient density \(\rho_0\) as a function of position \(x\) in units of the ambient conductive length scale \(L\) is given by:
$$ \frac{\rho(x/L)}{\rho_0} = \frac{2\left(1 + e^{-\frac{5x}{6L}}\right)}{1 + 2e^{-\frac{5x}{6L}}} $$
which can also be expressed as:
$$ \frac{\rho(x/L)}{\rho_0} = \frac{1 + e^{\frac{5x}{6L}}}{1 + \frac{1}{2}e^{\frac{5x}{6L}}} $$
