    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which represent the gravitational field in the context of general relativity, can be calculated from the derivatives of this metric.\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry and the static nature of the spacetime, most of the Christoffel symbols are zero. The non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{tt} = \\frac{M(r-2M)}{r^3}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{rr} = -\\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = -(r-2M)$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi} = -(r-2M)\\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^t_{rt} = \\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\phi\\phi} = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{r\\phi} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\theta\\phi} = \\cot\\theta$\n\nBy counting these distinct components, we find there are a total of 9 non-zero Christoffel symbols. It's important to note that the Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower two indices ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$), and the list above accounts for this symmetry.\n\n<<<9>>>"
