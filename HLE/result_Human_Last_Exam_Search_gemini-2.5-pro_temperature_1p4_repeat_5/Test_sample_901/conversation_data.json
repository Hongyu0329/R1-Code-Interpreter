    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The outcome of this reaction is determined by the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n\nFirst, it is necessary to establish the relationship between the bromo and methyl groups. The (1S,2R) configuration corresponds to a *trans* arrangement of the two substituents. In a cyclohexane ring, a trans-1,2-disubstituted compound can exist in two chair conformations: one with both substituents in equatorial positions (e,e) and another with both in axial positions (a,a). The conformation with both groups equatorial is significantly more stable.\n\nFor an E2 elimination to occur, the leaving group (bromine) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon must be in an anti-periplanar conformation, which in a cyclohexane ring means they both must be in axial positions. Therefore, the reaction must proceed through the less stable diaxial (a,a) conformer.\n\nIn the reactive diaxial conformation of *trans*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, both the bromine at C1 and the methyl group at C2 are in axial positions. The elimination requires an axial hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to C1 (either C2 or C6).\n\n*   **At C2:** Since the methyl group is in the axial position, the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial position. It is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, so elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 cannot occur. This means the more substituted Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene, cannot be formed.\n*   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one of which is in an axial position. This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1.\n\nConsequently, the tert-butoxide base can only abstract the axial hydrogen from C6. This results in the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group remains at C2, which is adjacent to the newly formed double bond. Numbering the resulting alkene according to IUPAC rules, the double bond is assigned positions 1 and 2, placing the methyl group at position 3.\n\nThe reaction, therefore, yields 3-methylcyclohexene as the only possible elimination product due to these stereochemical constraints.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
