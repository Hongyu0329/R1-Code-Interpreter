    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation, the number of contracted Gaussian functions is determined by breaking down the contributions from each atom in the molecule. Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, meaning it consists of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe 6-31G basis set designation specifies how atomic orbitals are represented:\n*   **For each Carbon atom (a second-row element):**\n    *   The core (1s) orbital is described by a single contracted function.\n    *   The valence shell is split into two parts. The inner valence (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) is represented by four contracted functions. The outer valence (2s', 2px', 2py', 2pz') is also represented by four contracted functions.\n    *   This results in a total of 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 contracted basis functions for each carbon atom.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its valence (1s) orbital is split into two parts (an inner and an outer function).\n    *   This results in a total of 2 contracted basis functions for each hydrogen atom.\n\nTo find the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8), we sum the functions from all of its atoms:\n*   **From Carbon:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **From Hydrogen:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\n<<<79>>>"
