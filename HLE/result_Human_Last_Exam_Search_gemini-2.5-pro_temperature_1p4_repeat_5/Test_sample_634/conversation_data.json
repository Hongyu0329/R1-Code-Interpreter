    "The search results confirm that the general method to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) is to form the augmented matrix M = [P1(s) P2(s)] and reduce it to the form [G(s) 0] using elementary column operations. The resulting matrix G(s) will be a GCRD. A key point is that the GCRD is unique only up to multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant).\n\nLet's re-attempt the column reduction with more care.\n\nThe matrices are:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nConstruct the augmented matrix M:\nM = [[s^2 + s, -s, s, 0],\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2, -s - 1, 1]]\n\nLet the columns be C1, C2, C3, C4.\nM = [[C1], [C2], [C3], [C4]]\n\nWe have a '1' in the second row of C4. This is an excellent pivot. We can use it to eliminate the other elements in the second row.\n\n**Step 1: C3 -> C3 + (s+1)C4**\nC3_new = [s + (s+1)*0, -s-1 + (s+1)*1] = [s, 0]\nM becomes:\n[[s^2 + s, -s, s, 0],\n [-s^2 - 1, s^2, 0, 1]]\n\n**Step 2: C2 -> C2 - s^2 * C4**\nC2_new = [-s - s^2*0, s^2 - s^2*1] = [-s, 0]\nM becomes:\n[[s^2 + s, -s, s, 0],\n [-s^2 - 1, 0, 0, 1]]\n\n**Step 3: C1 -> C1 + (s^2+1)C4**\nC1_new = [s^2+s + (s^2+1)*0, -s^2-1 + (s^2+1)*1] = [s^2+s, 0]\nM becomes:\n[[s^2+s, -s, s, 0],\n [0,     0,  0, 1]]\n\nLet's call the new columns C1', C2', C3', C4'.\nC1'=[s^2+s, 0], C2'=[-s, 0], C3'=[s, 0], C4'=.\n\nNow we work on the first row, using columns C1', C2', C3' to create zero columns.\n\n**Step 4: C1' -> C1' + (s+1)C3'**\nC1'_new = [s^2+s + (s+1)s, 0] = [s^2+s + s^2+s, 0] = [2s^2+2s, 0]\nThis is not making it simpler. Let's try something else.\n\n**Alternative Step 4: C1' -> C1' - (s+1)C3'**\nC1'_new = [s^2+s - (s+1)s, 0] = [s^2+s - s^2-s, 0] =\nThis creates a zero column. So the matrix becomes:\n[[0, -s, s, 0],\n [0, 0,  0, 1]]\n\n**Step 5: C3' -> C3' + C2'**\nC3'_new = [s + (-s), 0] =\nThe matrix is now:\n[[0, -s, 0, 0],\n [0, 0,  0, 1]]\n\nWe have successfully created two zero columns. Now we rearrange the columns to get the form [G 0].\nSwap C2 and C1:\n[[-s, 0, 0, 0],\n [0,  0, 0, 1]]\nSwap C4 and C2:\n[[-s, 0, 0, 0],\n [0,  1, 0, 0]]\n\nSo the GCRD candidate is G = [[-s, 0],].\n\nLet's check this result. G is a right divisor if P1 = Q1*G and P2 = Q2*G, where Q1 and Q2 are polynomial matrices.\n\n**Check P1:**\nP1 = Q1 * G\n[[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] = [[q11, q12], [q21, q22]] * [[-s, 0],]\n= [[-s*q11, q12], [-s*q21, q22]]\nThis gives:\nq12 = -s\nq22 = s^2\n-s*q11 = s^2 + s = s(s+1) => q11 = -(s+1)\n-s*q21 = -s^2 - 1 => q21 = s + 1/s\nBecause q21 is not a polynomial, G = [[-s, 0],] is not a right divisor of P1. My reduction is wrong.\n\nLet's reconsider the process. The problem lies in the polynomial column operations. When I have [[s^2+s, -s, s, 0],], I should not think of the columns as independent vectors but as columns of a matrix polynomial.\n\nLet's backtrack to:\nM' = [[s^2+s, -s, s, 0],\n      [0,     0,  0, 1]]\n\nLet's try to combine C1', C2', C3' in a different way.\nC3' -> C3' + C2' gives [s+(-s), 0] =. This is valid.\nM'' = [[s^2+s, -s, 0, 0],\n       [0,     0, 0, 1]]\n\nNow let's operate on C1' and C2'.\nC1' -> C1' + s * C2'\nC1'_new = [s^2+s + s*(-s), 0] = [s^2+s - s^2, 0] = [s, 0].\nM''' = [[s, -s, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0,  0, 1]]\n\nNow let's use the new C1' to zero C2'.\nC2' -> C2' + C1'\nC2'_new = [-s+s, 0] =\nM'''' = [[s, 0, 0, 0],\n        ]\n\nRe-arranging columns by swapping C2 and C4:\n[[s, 0, 0, 0],\n]\nThis gives G = [[s, 0],].\n\nLet's check this GCRD candidate.\n**Check P1:**\nP1 = Q1 * G\n[[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] = [[q11, q12], [q21, q22]] * [[s, 0],]\n= [[s*q11, q12], [s*q21, q22]]\nq12 = -s\nq22 = s^2\ns*q11 = s^2+s = s(s+1) => q11 = s+1\ns*q21 = -s^2-1 => q21 = -s - 1/s.\nStill not a polynomial matrix. This means the GCRD is not this one either.\n\nThere seems to be an error in my reasoning about column operations.\nLet's analyze P1 and P2 directly.\nP1 = [[s(s+1), -s], [-(s^2+1), s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-(s+1), 1]]\n\nLet's see if P2 can be a right divisor of P1.\nP1 = Q * P2\n[[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] = [[q1, q2], [q3, q4]] * [[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]]\n= [[s*q1 - (s+1)q2, q2], [s*q3 - (s+1)q4, q4]]\n\nFrom the (1,2) element: q2 = -s.\nFrom the (1,1) element: s^2+s = s*q1 - (s+1)(-s) = s*q1 + s^2+s.\nThis implies s*q1 = 0, so q1 = 0.\n\nFrom the (2,2) element: q4 = s^2.\nFrom the (2,1) element: -s^2-1 = s*q3 - (s+1)s^2 = s*q3 - s^3-s^2.\nThis implies s*q3 = s^3+s^2 - s^2 - 1 = s^3-1.\nSo q3 = s^2 - 1/s.\nThis is not a polynomial matrix. So P2 is not a right divisor of P1.\n\nLet's look at the determinants.\ndet(P1) = s^2(s^2+s) - (-s)(-s^2-1) = s^4+s^3 - (s^3+s) = s^4 - s = s(s^3-1) = s(s-1)(s^2+s+1).\ndet(P2) = s*1 - 0*(-s-1) = s.\n\nIf G is a GCRD, then det(G) must divide both det(P1) and det(P2).\nSo det(G) must divide `s`. This means det(G) can be a constant `c` or `c*s`.\n\nIf det(G) is a non-zero constant, then G is unimodular. In this case, P1 and P2 are called relatively right prime.\nIf det(G) = c*s, then the GCRD is not unimodular.\n\nLet's try a candidate G such that det(G) = s.\nFor example, G = [[s, 0], [-1, 1]]. Let's check this.\ndet(G) = s.\nIs G a right divisor of P2?\nP2 = Q2 * G\n[[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]] = [[q1, q2], [q3, q4]] * [[s, 0], [-1, 1]]\n= [[s*q1-q2, q2], [s*q3-q4, q4]]\nFrom (1,2) and (2,2): q2=0, q4=1.\nFrom (1,1): s = s*q1 - 0 => q1 = 1.\nFrom (2,1): -s-1 = s*q3 - 1 => s*q3 = -s => q3 = -1.\nSo Q2 = [, [-1, 1]], which is a polynomial matrix (and also unimodular).\nSo, G is a right divisor of P2.\n\nNow let's check if G is a right divisor of P1.\nP1 = Q1 * G\n[[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] = [[q1, q2], [q3, q4]] * [[s, 0], [-1, 1]]\n= [[s*q1-q2, q2], [s*q3-q4, q4]]\nFrom (1,2) and (2,2): q2 = -s, q4 = s^2.\nFrom (1,1): s^2+s = s*q1 - (-s) = s*q1 + s. So s*q1 = s^2 => q1 = s.\nFrom (2,1): -s^2-1 = s*q3 - s^2. So s*q3 = -1 => q3 = -1/s.\nThis is not a polynomial matrix. So this G is not correct.\n\nLet's try another candidate G. Let's try the answer from the first failed reduction.\nG = [[0, -s],] has det(G) = s.\nLet's check it again.\nP2 = Q2 * G\n[[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]] = [[q1, q2], [q3, q4]] * [[0, -s],]\n= [[q2, -s*q1], [q4, -s*q3]]\nq2=s, -s*q1=0 -> q1=0.\nq4=-s-1, -s*q3=1 -> q3 = -1/s. Not a divisor.\n\nLet's try to reverse the roles of P1 and P2 in the Euclidean algorithm. Let's divide P2 by P1. This is not how it works.\n\nThere is a theorem by Wolovich, which says that one can find the GCRD by performing row operations on the matrix M = [P1^T; P2^T]. This finds the greatest common *left* divisor of the transposed matrices, which is the transpose of the GCRD of the original matrices.\nM = [[P1^T], [P2^T]] = [[s^2+s, -s^2-1], [-s, s^2], [s, -s-1],]\nThis is a 4x2 matrix. Let's perform row operations.\nR1, R2, R3, R4.\nThe pivot is R4(2) = 1.\nR1 -> R1 + (s^2+1)R4\nR1_new = [s^2+s, -s^2-1 + s^2+1] = [s^2+s, 0]\nR2 -> R2 - s^2*R4\nR2_new = [-s, s^2-s^2] = [-s, 0]\nR3 -> R3 + (s+1)R4\nR3_new = [s, -s-1+s+1] = [s, 0]\nM becomes:\n[[s^2+s, 0],\n [-s,    0],\n [s,     0],\n [0,     1]]\n\nNow let's use R2 or R3 to simplify R1.\nR1 -> R1 + (s+1)R2\nR1_new = [s^2+s + (s+1)(-s), 0] = [s^2+s -s^2-s, 0] =\nM becomes:\n[[0,  0],\n [-s, 0],\n [s,  0],\n [0,  1]]\n\nR3 -> R3 + R2\nR3_new = [s-s, 0] =\nM becomes:\n[[0,  0],\n [-s, 0],\n [0,  0],\n [0,  1]]\n\nWe can swap rows to bring this to the form [G_transposed; 0].\nSwap R1 and R2:\n[[-s, 0],\n [0,  0],\n [0,  0],\n [0,  1]]\nSwap R2 and R4:\n[[-s, 0],\n [0,  1],\n [0,  0],\n [0,  0]]\n\nSo G_transposed = [[-s, 0],].\nThis means G = [[-s, 0],]^T = [[-s, 0],].\nThis is the same result as my flawed column operation method, and I already showed it is incorrect because it is not a right divisor of P1.\n\nThere must be an algebraic error in my divisibility check.\nLet's re-check P1 = Q1 * G for G = [[-s, 0],]\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nG = [[-s, 0],]\nQ1 should be P1 * G_inv. G is invertible over the field of rational functions, not polynomials.\nP1 = Q1 * G => [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] = [[q11, q12], [q21, q22]] * [[-s, 0],]\n=> [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] = [[-s*q11, q12], [-s*q21, q22]]\nFrom the second column: q12 = -s and q22 = s^2. These are polynomials.\nFrom the first column:\n-s*q11 = s^2+s = s(s+1) => q11 = -(s+1). This is a polynomial.\n-s*q21 = -s^2-1 => q21 = s + 1/s. This is NOT a polynomial.\nThe conclusion remains the same. The result from the standard algorithm seems to be incorrect.\n\nLet's check the divisibility check again. Is it possible that `s` and `-s^2-1` have a common factor? No.\n\nLet's rethink the row reduction of M = [P1^T; P2^T].\n[[s^2+s, -s^2-1],\n [-s,    s^2   ],\n [s,     -s-1  ],\n [0,     1     ]]\nThe operations were:\n1. R1 -> R1 + (s^2+1)R4 -> [s^2+s, 0]\n2. R2 -> R2 - s^2*R4 -> [-s, 0]\n3. R3 -> R3 + (s+1)R4 -> [s, 0]\nMatrix becomes: [[s^2+s, 0], [-s, 0], [s, 0],]\n4. R1 -> R1 + (s)R3 -> [s^2+s+s^2, 0] = [2s^2+s, 0]. This is not helping.\nLet's use R3 to eliminate R1.\nR1 -> R1 - (s+1)R3 = [s^2+s - s(s+1), 0] =\nMatrix is now: [, [-s, 0], [s, 0],]\n5. R2 -> R2 + R3 = [-s+s, 0] =\nMatrix is now: [,, [s,0],].\nLet's swap rows.\nR1 <-> R3\n[[s, 0],,,]\nR2 <-> R4\n[[s, 0],,,]\n\nSo G_transposed = [[s, 0],].\nAnd G = [[s, 0],] - No, G = [[s, 0],].\nLet's check this result G = [[s, 0],].\nCheck P1: P1 = Q1 * G\n[[s^2+s, -s],[-s^2-1, s^2]] = [[q1,q2],[q3,q4]] * [[s,0],] = [[s*q1, q2], [s*q3, q4]]\nq2=-s, q4=s^2.\ns*q1 = s^2+s => q1=s+1.\ns*q3 = -s^2-1 => q3 = -s - 1/s.\nThis is again not a polynomial matrix. What am I missing?\n\nCould the GCRD be unimodular? If G is unimodular, we can take G = I (the identity matrix). Are P1 and P2 relatively right prime? This happens if the matrix [P1^T; P2^T] can be reduced to [I; 0] by row operations (up to row permutations).\nOur reduction yielded [[s,0],;0;0], not [,;0;0]. So they are not relatively right prime.\n\nLet's assume there is a mistake in my algebraic division check.\nThe row-reduction algorithm on [P1^T; P2^T] is a standard method. I have performed it twice with the same result: G = [[s, 0],].\nMaybe there is a nuance to what \"greatest common right divisor\" means.\nFrom the search results: \"G(λ) ... is said to be a greatest common right divisor (GCRD) ... if, for every CRD D(λ) ... of the same set, D(λ) is a right divisor of G(λ)\". This is the standard definition.\n\nWhat if the GCRD is a non-square matrix? The method used assumes the GCRD will be a 2x2 matrix. This is generally the case when the input matrices are square.\n\nLet's try a different candidate GCRD.\nMaybe P2 is the GCRD? For P2 to be the GCRD, it has to be a right divisor of P1. We checked this and found q3 = s^2 - 1/s, which is not a polynomial. So P2 is not the GCRD.\n\nLet's re-verify the row operations again. Very carefully.\nM =\nR1: [s^2+s, -s^2-1]\nR2: [-s, s^2]\nR3: [s, -s-1]\nR4:\n\nR1_new = R1 + (s^2+1)R4 = [s^2+s, -s^2-1 + (s^2+1)*1] = [s^2+s, 0]. Correct.\nR2_new = R2 - s^2*R4 = [-s, s^2 - s^2*1] = [-s, 0]. Correct.\nR3_new = R3 + (s+1)R4 = [s, -s-1 + (s+1)*1] = [s, 0]. Correct.\n\nMatrix is now:\nR1': [s^2+s, 0]\nR2': [-s, 0]\nR3': [s, 0]\nR4':\n\nNow we need to triangularize this.\nLet's use R3' to zero out R1' and R2'.\nR1' -> R1' - (s+1)R3' = [s^2+s - (s+1)s, 0 - (s+1)0] =. Correct.\nR2' -> R2' + R3' = [-s+s, 0+0] =. Correct.\n\nMatrix is now:\n[,, [s,0],] after re-assigning R1' and R2' to zero.\nWe are left with the non-zero rows [s, 0] and.\nThese two rows form the G_transposed matrix. So G^T = [[s, 0],].\nThus, G = [[s, 0],].\n\nLet's assume the algorithm is right and my check is wrong. But how?\nLet P1 = Q1 * G.\n[[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] = Q1 * [[s, 0],].\nThe only way Q1 can be a polynomial matrix is if `s` is a factor of `-s^2-1`.\n-s^2-1 = s(-s) - 1. The remainder is -1, not 0. So `s` is not a factor.\nTherefore, the division `-s^2-1` by `s` does not result in a polynomial.\n\nThis implies that my understanding of the algorithm or its application is flawed.\nMaybe the starting matrices P1 and P2 must have full column rank?\ndet(P1) = s^4-s. This is not zero for all s, so P1 has full rank.\ndet(P2) = s. This is not zero for all s, so P2 has full rank.\nThis condition holds.\n\nLet's look at the problem from another angle. Any right divisor G must be such that P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s) and P2(s)=Q2(s)G(s).\nIf we evaluate this at s=0 (a root of det(P2) and det(P1)):\nP1(0) = [, [-1, 0]]\nP2(0) = [, [-1, 1]]\nG(0) must be a right divisor of both P1(0) and P2(0).\nP1(0) = Q1(0)G(0)\nP2(0) = Q2(0)G(0)\nFrom P2(0), we see the first column is zero. This implies that either the first column of Q2(0) is zero or the first row of G(0) is zero, or det(Q2(0))=0, or det(G(0))=0.\nThe null space of P1(0) is spanned by [x, 0]^T for any x.\nThe null space of P2(0) is spanned by [x, 0]^T for any x.\nLet v be a vector in the null space of G(s) for some s. Then G(s)v=0.\nThen P1(s)v = Q1(s)G(s)v = 0.\nAnd P2(s)v = Q2(s)G(s)v = 0.\nSo the null space of G(s) must be a subspace of the null spaces of P1(s) and P2(s).\n\nAt s=0, the null space of both P1(0) and P2(0) is the space spanned by e1 =^T.\nThis means that G(0) must also have e1 in its null space.\nG(0)e1 = 0.\nThis means the first column of G(0) must be the zero vector.\nG(0) = [[0, a], [0, b]].\n\nLet's check our candidate G = [[s, 0],].\nG(0) = [,]. The first column is zero. This is consistent.\n\nNow, consider the matrix P1 - P2 * (something).\nLet's try to perform the Euclidean algorithm by \"right division\".\nP1 = Q * P2 + R\nWe want to find Q such that the \"degree\" of R is smaller than the \"degree\" of P2.\nThis is not well-defined.\nHowever, we can try to cancel the highest power of `s`.\nThe highest degree coefficient of P1 is [,[-1,1]]s^2.\nThe highest degree coefficient of P2 is [,[-1,0]]s^1.\nLet's try to make P1 - Q*P2 have a lower degree.\nLet Q(s) = Q1*s.\nP1 - (Q1*s)*P2 = (P1_2 s^2 + ...) - (Q1*s)*(P2_1 s + ...) = (P1_2 - Q1*P2_1)s^2 + ...\nP1_2 = [, [-1, 1]]\nP2_1 = [, [-1, 1]]\nThis is interesting!\nP1(s) = [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] = s^2*[,[-1,1]] + s*[[1,-1],] + [,[-1,0]].\nP2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]] = s*[,[-1,1]] + [,[-1,1]].\nLet H = [,[-1,1]]. This matrix is unimodular (det=1).\nP1 = s^2*H + s*[[1,-1],] + [,[-1,0]]\nP2 = s*H + [,[-1,1]]\n\nThis suggests we can right-multiply by H^-1 = [,].\nP1' = P1 * H^-1 = [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] * [,] = [[s^2, -s], [-1, s^2]]\nP2' = P2 * H^-1 = [[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]] * [,] = [[s,0], [-s, 1]]\nH is unimodular, so GCRD(P1, P2) = GCRD(P1', P2') * H.\n\nNow let's find GCRD of P1' and P2'.\nP1' = [[s^2, -s], [-1, s^2]]\nP2' = [[s, 0], [-s, 1]]\ndet(P1') = s^4 - s.\ndet(P2') = s.\n\nLet's try to divide P1' by P2'.\nP1' = Q' * P2'\n[[s^2, -s], [-1, s^2]] = [[q1, q2], [q3, q4]] * [[s, 0], [-s, 1]]\n= [[s*q1 - s*q2, q2], [s*q3-s*q4, q4]]\nFrom (1,2) and (2,2): q2=-s, q4=s^2.\nFrom (1,1): s^2 = s*q1 - s(-s) = s*q1 + s^2 => s*q1=0 => q1=0.\nFrom (2,1): -1 = s*q3 - s(s^2) = s*q3 - s^3 => s*q3 = s^3-1 => q3 = s^2 - 1/s.\nStill not divisible.\n\nLet's use the column operation method on [P1' P2'].\nM' = [[s^2, -s, s, 0],\n      [-1, s^2, -s, 1]]\nUse C4 to zero out row 2.\nC1 -> C1 + C4: [[s^2, -s, s, 0], [0, s^2, -s, 1]]\nC2 -> C2 - s^2*C4: [[s^2, -s-s^2*0, s, 0], [0, 0, -s, 1]] = [[s^2, -s, s, 0], [0, 0, -s, 1]]\nC3 -> C3 + s*C4: [[s^2, -s, s, 0],]\nThis sequence of operations is wrong. Let's do it right.\n\nM' = [[s^2, -s, s, 0],\n      [-1, s^2, -s, 1]]\nC1_new = C1 + 1*C4 = [s^2, 0]\nC2_new = C2 - s^2*C4 = [-s, 0]\nC3_new = C3 + s*C4 = [2s, 0]\nThis is not correct. C3_new = [s+s*0, -s+s*1] = [s,0].\n\nLet's do it again.\nM' = [[s^2, -s, s, 0], [-1, s^2, -s, 1]]\nC1 -> C1 + C4 => new C1 is [s^2, 0]^T\nC2 -> C2 - s^2 C4 => new C2 is [-s, 0]^T\nC3 -> C3 + s C4 => new C3 is [s, 0]^T\nThe matrix becomes:\n[[s^2, -s, s, 0],\n [0,   0,  0, 1]]\nThis is the same situation as before. The first part is [[s^2, -s, s]].\nC1 -> C1 + C2: [s^2-s, 0]\nC2 -> C2 + C3:\nNow matrix is [[s^2, 0, s, 0],]\nC1 -> C1 - s*C3: [s^2 - s^2, 0] =\nMatrix is [[0, 0, s, 0],].\nWe are left with columns [s,0] and.\nThe GCRD G' would be [[s,0],].\n\nLet's check this G' on P1' and P2'.\nP1' = Q1' * G'\n[[s^2, -s], [-1, s^2]] = Q' * [[s,0],] = [[s*q1, q2], [s*q3, q4]]\nq2=-s, q4=s^2.\ns*q1=s^2 => q1=s.\ns*q3 = -1 => q3 = -1/s. Still not polynomial.\n\nI seem to be consistently arriving at a result that fails the divisibility check.\nThis suggests one of three possibilities:\n1. The algorithm I'm using is wrong for this case.\n2. The algorithm is right, but my execution of it is wrong.\n3. The algorithm and my execution are right, but my check is wrong.\n\nLet's reconsider the algorithm based on: \"The most common method is to merge matrices into a large matrix vertically, and then transform it into Hermite form or Popov form by row transformation. The top non-zero part of the matrix is one of GCRDs.\"\nThis describes finding a GCLD, not GCRD. The text seems to confuse right and left. \"merge matrices... vertically, and then... row transformation\" gives a GCLD. To get a GCRD, you merge horizontally and use column transformations. My method seems correct in principle.\n\nLet me trust the algorithm result G' = [[s, 0],] for the modified problem and G = [[s, 0],] for the original problem.\nAnd let me reconsider the division:\nP1' = [[s^2, -s], [-1, s^2]]. G' = [[s,0],].\nIs P1' a right multiple of G'? P1' = Q' G'.\nQ' = P1' * (G')^{-1} (over the field of rational functions)\n(G')^{-1} = [[1/s, 0],]\nQ' = [[s^2, -s], [-1, s^2]] * [[1/s, 0],] = [[s^2/s, -s], [-1/s, s^2]] = [[s, -s], [-1/s, s^2]].\nThis is definitively not a polynomial matrix.\n\nSo, the result of the column-reduction algorithm is not a divisor at all. This is a huge contradiction. Why?\nThe elementary column operations should produce an equivalent matrix in the sense of module theory, and the resulting basis for the module generated by the columns should be the GCRD.\nCould it be that the GCRD is P2 itself and I made a mistake in checking that?\nP1 = Q * P2\n[[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] = Q * [[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]]\nq2 = -s\nq4 = s^2\ns*q1 - (s+1)q2 = s*q1 - (s+1)(-s) = s*q1 + s^2+s = s^2+s => s*q1 = 0 => q1=0.\ns*q3 - (s+1)q4 = s*q3 - (s+1)s^2 = s*q3 - s^3-s^2 = -s^2-1 => s*q3 = s^3-1 => q3=s^2-1/s.\nI am very confident in this calculation. P2 is not a GCRD.\n\nSo let's find the error in the column operation logic.\nStart M = [[s^2 + s, -s, s, 0], [-s^2 - 1, s^2, -s - 1, 1]]\nWe apply a series of elementary column operations T1, T2, ... Tk.\nM_new = M * T1 * T2 * ... * Tk = M * T_total.\nT_total must be a unimodular matrix.\nWe want M_new = [G, 0].\nThis means [P1, P2] * T_total = [G, 0].\nLet T_total = [[T11, T12], [T21, T22]].\nThen P1*T11 + P2*T21 = G\nand P1*T12 + P2*T22 = 0.\nFrom the second equation, P1*T12 = -P2*T22.\nSince G is a GCRD of P1 and P2, we have P1=A*G and P2=B*G for some polynomial matrices A, B.\nA*G*T11 + B*G*T21 = G => (A*T11 + B*T21)*G = G. This means (A*T11 + B*T21) must be the identity matrix (if G is full rank).\nAnd A*G*T12 = -B*G*T22.\n\nLet's re-examine P1 and P2.\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]]\nMaybe the GCRD is [[s,0],[-s,1]]*Hinv?\nNo, [[s,0],[-s,1]] was P2'.\n\nWhat if the GCRD is simply [[s, -1],[0, s]]? No reason for that.\nLet's try a different sequence of column reductions.\n\nM = [[s^2 + s, -s, s, 0],\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2, -s - 1, 1]]\n\nMaybe swap C1 and C3 first.\nM = [[s, -s, s^2+s, 0], [-s-1, s^2, -s^2-1, 1]]\nC1 -> C1+C2 gives [0, s^2-s]\nC2 -> C2\nC3 -> C3 - (s+1)C1 ... this gets complicated. The pivot '1' is the best way.\n\nMaybe I'm reducing too much.\nLet's go back to M' = [[s^2+s, -s, s, 0],].\nAt this point, we have performed operations C1->C1+(s^2+1)C4, C2->C2-s^2 C4, C3->C3+(s+1)C4.\nThe transformation matrix for this is T = [,,, [s^2+1, -s^2, s+1, 1]]. This is unimodular (det=1).\nThe resulting matrix is M' = [[s^2+s, -s, s, 0],].\nThis matrix is [P1', P2'], where P1' has columns [s^2+s, 0], [-s, 0] and P2' has columns [s, 0],.\nSo P1' = [[s^2+s, -s],], P2' = [[s,0],].\nThe problem is to find GCRD of P1' and P2'.\nGCRD(P1, P2) = GCRD(P1', P2').\nLet G = GCRD(P1', P2'). G must divide P2' = [[s,0],].\nLet G be a divisor of P2'. P2' = Q*G.\ndet(P2') = s. So det(G) must divide s. det(G) can be c or c*s.\nIf det(G) is unimodular, G is unimodular. Then [[s,0],] would be unimodular, which is false.\nSo G is not unimodular. det(G)=c*s.\nLet's try G=P2'=[[s,0],]. Is G a divisor of P1'?\nP1' = Q * G => [[s^2+s, -s],] = Q * [[s,0],]\n[[s^2+s, -s],] = [[q1,q2],[q3,q4]] * [[s,0],] = [[s*q1, q2],[s*q3, q4]].\nq2=-s, q4=0.\ns*q1 = s^2+s => q1=s+1.\ns*q3 = 0 => q3=0.\nSo Q = [[s+1, -s],]. This is a polynomial matrix.\nSo, P2'=[[s,0],] is a GCRD of P1' and P2'.\n\nSo the GCRD of the original matrices is G = [[s, 0],].\nBut this failed the check on the original P1. Why?\nGCRD(P1, P2) = GCRD(P1*T, P2*T) is not a rule. It's GCRD(A,B)U = GCRD(AU, BU) for unimodular U.\nThe operation is on the columns of the concatenated matrix [A, B].\n[A, B] -> [A, B] * [[I, 0], [X, I]] = [A+BX, B].\nMy operations were column ops on [P1, P2]. So [P1, P2] becomes [P1_new, P2_new]. The GCRD is preserved.\nSo GCRD(P1,P2) = GCRD(P1',P2') = [[s,0],].\nMy previous check that G=[[s,0],] does not divide P1 must be wrong.\n\nLet's do it again, for the third time.\nP1 = [[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]]. G = [[s,0],].\nP1 = Q * G\n[[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] = [[q1,q2],[q3,q4]] * [[s,0],]\n= [[s*q1, q2], [s*q3, q4]]\nq2 = -s. q4 = s^2. Correct.\ns*q1 = s^2+s. q1=s+1. Correct.\ns*q3 = -s^2-1.\ns*q3 = s(-s) - 1.\nq3 = (-s^2-1)/s = -s - 1/s.\nThis is not a polynomial. I cannot see how I can be wrong about this simple algebraic fact.\n\nSo the initial column reduction must be the source of the error.\nM = [[s^2+s, -s,       s,      0],\n     [-s^2-1, s^2,      -s-1,   1]]\nC1 -> C1 + (s^2+1)*C4 = [s^2+s, 0].\nC2 -> C2 - s^2*C4 = [-s, 0].\nC3 -> C3 + (s+1)*C4 = [s, 0].\nC4 is unchanged:.\nThis gives M_new = [[s^2+s, -s, s, 0],]. This is correct.\nLet M_new = [P1_new, P2_new] = [[s^2+s, -s],] and [[s, 0],]. NO. This is wrong.\nThe operations combine columns from P1 and P2.\nThe operations done were C_i_new = C_i_old + poly * C4_old.\nC1_new = C1 + (s^2+1)C4\nC2_new = C2 - s^2*C4\nC3_new = C3 + (s+1)C4\nC4_new = C4.\nLet's see the new P1 and P2.\nP1_new = [C1_new, C2_new] = [[s^2+s, -s],]. Correct.\nP2_new = [C3_new, C4_new] = [[s,0],]. Correct.\nGCRD(P1, P2) = GCRD(P1_new, P2_new).\nAnd I showed that GCRD(P1_new, P2_new) = P2_new = [[s, 0],].\n\nThe whole problem comes down to why this G=[[s,0],] fails to divide P1.\nLet's review the definition of polynomial matrix division. P = Q*D. P, Q, D must have polynomial entries. This is the standard definition.\n\nCould there be a typo in the problem statement?\nIf P1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2, s^2]]\nThen s*q3 = -s^2 => q3 = -s. This would work. Then Q would be [[s+1, -s],[-s, s^2]], a polynomial matrix.\nIf the (-1) term in P1(2,1) was not there, GCRD would be [[s,0],].\n\nAssuming the problem is correct as stated. Is there another GCRD?\nAny GCRD G' is related by G' = U*G where U is unimodular.\nLet G = [[s,0],].\nLet G' = U*G = [[u1, u2],[u3, u4]] * [[s,0],] = [[s*u1, u2],[s*u3, u4]].\nWe need this G' to divide P1.\nP1 = Q * G'\n[[s^2+s, -s], [-s^2-1, s^2]] = Q * [[s*u1, u2],[s*u3, u4]]\nFrom this, the second column of P1 must be a linear combination of the columns of Q, with coefficients u2 and u4. This seems too complex.\n\nLet's reconsider the result from the row-reduction of the transpose. I got G = [[s,0],]. I am very confident in that derivation.\nThere is a fundamental contradiction here. Let me search for an online calculator to verify the result. These are for scalar polynomials. Maplesoft has one, but I cannot use it directly.\n\nFinal attempt. What if the GCRD is 1x2 matrix? Or 2x1? No, P1 and P2 are 2x2. The GCRD will be 2x2 if it's not trivial.\n\nLet's assume the GCRD is G = [[s, 1], [-1, 0]]. det=1. Unimodular. Then they are coprime.\nCheck if [[s,1],[-1,0]] divides P2.\n[[s,0],[-s-1,1]] = Q * [[s,1],[-1,0]] = [[qs-q3, q1],[s*q2-q4,q2]].\nq1=0, q2=1. qs-q3=s => s-q3=s => q3=0. s-q4=-s-1 => q4=2s+1.\nQ=[,[0,2s+1]]. It is a polynomial matrix. So [[s,1],[-1,0]] divides P2.\nCheck if [[s,1],[-1,0]] divides P1.\n[[s^2+s, -s],[-s^2-1, s^2]] = Q * [[s,1],[-1,0]] = [[s*q1-q3, q1],[s*q2-q4,q2]].\nq1=-s, q2=s^2.\ns*q1-q3 = s(-s)-q3 = -s^2-q3 = s^2+s => q3=-2s^2-s.\ns*q2-q4 = s(s^2)-q4 = s^3-q4 = -s^2-1 => q4=s^3+s^2+1.\nQ=[[-s,s^2],[-2s^2-s, s^3+s^2+1]]. Polynomial matrix.\nSo, [[s,1],[-1,0]] is a common right divisor. Since it is unimodular, any GCRD must be unimodular.\nTherefore, P1 and P2 are relatively right prime. Any unimodular matrix can be a GCRD. By convention, we can choose the identity matrix I.\n\nLet's re-run the column reduction and see if we can get I.\nM = [[s^2 + s, -s, s, 0], [-s^2 - 1, s^2, -s - 1, 1]]\nReduce to [G 0]. If G is unimodular, we should be able to reduce it to [I 0].\nFrom before, we got to [[s,0,0,0],]. This gives G=[[s,0],] which is not unimodular.\nThe sequence of operations must lead to a unimodular G.\nThe operations performed:\nT1: C1->C1+(s^2+1)C4. C2->C2-s^2 C4. C3->C3+(s+1)C4.\nResulting matrix: [[s^2+s, -s, s, 0],]\nT2: C3->C3+C2.\nResulting matrix: [[s^2+s, -s, 0, 0],]\nT3: C1->C1+s*C2.\nResulting matrix: [[s, -s, 0, 0],]\nT4: C2->C2+C1.\nResulting matrix: [[s, 0, 0, 0],]\nThis yields G=[[s,0],], det=s.\n\nThe two methods (direct division check and column operations) give conflicting results. The direct check shows [[s,1],[-1,0]] is a CRD, and since it is unimodular, P1 and P2 are right-coprime and G=I is a valid GCRD.\nThe column operation method yields G=[[s,0],], which is not unimodular, and which doesn't seem to divide P1.\nThere must be an error in the column operation reduction.\n\nLet G = [[s, 1], [-1, 0]]. This is a valid GCRD. All other GCRDs are U*G where U is unimodular. The identity matrix I is also a GCRD, because I = (G^-1) * G, and G^-1 is unimodular.\n\nFinal check of the G=[[s,1],[-1,0]] division.\nP2 = [,[0,2s+1]] * G. Correct.\nP1 = [[-s, s^2], [-2s^2-s, s^3+s^2+1]] * G. Correct.\nThe existence of a unimodular common right divisor implies that they are relatively right prime. The greatest common right divisor is any unimodular matrix. A standard choice is the identity matrix.\n\n<<<The greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nand\nP2 = [[s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1]]\nis any unimodular matrix. A standard choice for the GCRD in this case is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\nHere's why:\nA matrix G(s) is a common right divisor (CRD) of P1(s) and P2(s) if there exist polynomial matrices Q1(s) and Q2(s) such that:\nP1(s) = Q1(s)G(s)\nP2(s) = Q2(s)G(s)\n\nLet's test the unimodular matrix G(s) = [[s, 1], [-1, 0]]. A matrix is unimodular if its determinant is a non-zero constant. The determinant of G(s) is s*0 - 1*(-1) = 1, so it is unimodular.\n\n1.  **Checking if G(s) is a right divisor of P2(s):**\n    We need to find a polynomial matrix Q2(s) such that P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s).\n    [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]] = [[q1, q2], [q3, q4]] * [[s, 1], [-1, 0]]\n    = [[s*q1 - q3, q1], [s*q2 - q4, q2]]\n    By comparing the elements, we get:\n    *   q1 = 0\n    *   q2 = 1\n    *   s*q1 - q3 = s  => s*0 - q3 = s => q3 = -s\n    *   s*q2 - q4 = -s - 1 => s*1 - q4 = -s - 1 => q4 = 2s + 1\n    The matrix Q2(s) = [, [-s, 2s + 1]] has all polynomial entries. Thus, G(s) is a right divisor of P2(s).\n\n2.  **Checking if G(s) is a right divisor of P1(s):**\n    We need to find a polynomial matrix Q1(s) such that P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s).\n    [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] = [[q1, q2], [q3, q4]] * [[s, 1], [-1, 0]]\n    = [[s*q1 - q3, q1], [s*q2 - q4, q2]]\n    By comparing the elements, we get:\n    *   q1 = -s\n    *   q2 = s^2\n    *   s*q1 - q3 = s^2 + s => s*(-s) - q3 = s^2 + s => -s^2 - q3 = s^2 + s => q3 = -2s^2 - s\n    *   s*q2 - q4 = -s^2 - 1 => s*(s^2) - q4 = -s^2 - 1 => s^3 - q4 = -s^2 - 1 => q4 = s^3 + s^2 + 1\n    The matrix Q1(s) = [[-s, s^2], [-2s^2 - s, s^3 + s^2 + 1]] has all polynomial entries. Thus, G(s) is also a right divisor of P1(s).\n\nSince we have found a common right divisor that is unimodular, the matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are called relatively right prime. The greatest common right divisor is not unique but is defined up to multiplication by a unimodular matrix. Therefore, any unimodular matrix is a GCRD. A common and simple choice for the GCRD of relatively prime matrices is the identity matrix, I = [,].\nWe can verify that I is also a GCRD since I = (G⁻¹) * G, and the inverse of a unimodular matrix is also unimodular.\n\n>>>\nThe greatest common right divisor (GCRD) is any 2x2 unimodular matrix. By convention, the identity matrix I = [,] is chosen."
