    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are predatory insects that have been recorded feeding on a diet that includes both other insects and pollen. Specifically, they are known to prey on soft-bodied arthropods such as aphids. In addition to their predatory behavior, some adult snakeflies also consume pollen and nectar (sugary substances).\n\nBased on the provided choices:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Snakeflies have been recorded feeding on sugary substances, which would include nectar.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Snakeflies are significant predators of aphids. While snakeflies are not found in New Zealand and thus would not feed on aphids specific to the Tōtara tree, \"aphids\" as a food source are a core part of their diet.\n\nThe other options are incorrect as snakeflies are not recorded as feeding on fungus or leaf tissue. Therefore, the correct choices reflecting their known diet are Nectar and Aphids.\n\n<<<F>>>"
