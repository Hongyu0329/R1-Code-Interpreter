    "## No Lectures Cited in Einstein's 1905 Brownian Motion Paper\n\nIn his seminal 1905 paper on Brownian motion, \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat), Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures or the work of any other scientists.\n\nLike his other groundbreaking papers published in his \"annus mirabilis\" of 1905, the paper on Brownian motion is notable for its lack of references to contemporary literature. Einstein himself later claimed that he undertook the work \"without knowing that observations concerning Brownian motion were already long familiar.\"\n\nWhile historical analysis suggests Einstein may have been aware of the work of others, such as William Sutherland and had read works by Henri Poincaré which discussed Brownian motion, no formal citations to these or any other lectures or papers appear in the 1905 publication. There is some evidence that Einstein referred to Ludwig Boltzmann's lectures on gas theory in his collected papers, however, this was not within the 1905 paper on Brownian motion itself. The paper was presented as a theoretical deduction from the kinetic theory of heat, and as such, Einstein did not reference any experimental or theoretical lectures from other physicists."
