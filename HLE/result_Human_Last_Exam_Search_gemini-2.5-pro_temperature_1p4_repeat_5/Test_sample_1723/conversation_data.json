    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While several species of mushrooms exhibit blue or bluish coloration on their caps and stems, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nFor instance, the vibrant blue mushroom *Entoloma hochstetteri*, native to New Zealand, has a reddish-pink spore print. Similarly, the *Stropharia caerulea*, or Blue Roundhead, has a purplish-brown to purple-black spore print. Other mushrooms with blue characteristics include:\n\n*   ***Mycena cyanorrhiza***: This small white mushroom has blue tints but produces a white spore print.\n*   ***Pleurotus columbinus*** (Blue Oyster Mushroom): The cap can be blueish, but this is a substrain of the pearl oyster mushroom, which typically has a white to greyish-lilac spore print.\n*   ***Cortinarius rotundisporus***: Known as the elegant blue webcap, it has a steely blue cap but a reddish-brown spore print.\n*   ***Panaeolus cyanescens***: This mushroom stains blue but has a black spore print.\n*   ***Lactarius indigo***: A blue mushroom that bleeds blue latex, it has a yellowish-cream spore print.\n*   ***Gymnopilus aeruginosus***: Also known as the magic blue gym, this mushroom has a rusty orange spore print.\n*   ***Clitocybe nuda*** (Wood Blewit): It has a blue to violet-tinged cap and gills when young, but produces pale pink spores.\n*   ***Chlorociboria aeruginascens*** (Blue-Green Elf Cup): This fungus stains wood a prominent blue-green color but is not known for a blue spore print.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus with a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
