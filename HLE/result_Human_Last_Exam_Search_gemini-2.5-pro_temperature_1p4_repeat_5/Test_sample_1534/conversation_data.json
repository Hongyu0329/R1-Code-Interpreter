    "### Brain Regions Posterior to the Palliovisceral Lobe in Dwarf Cuttlefish Identified\n\nIn the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions situated posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes**, the **fin lobes**, and the **vasomotor lobes**. These structures, along with the palliovisceral lobe itself, are part of a larger area known as the palliovisceral lobe complex, which is located in the posterior subesophageal mass of the cuttlefish brain.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is centrally located within this complex and plays a role in controlling escape movements and the ejection of ink. The surrounding lobes have distinct functions. The posterior chromatophore lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores and papillae on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass, which are crucial for the cuttlefish's remarkable camouflage abilities. The fin lobes control the movements of the fins, and the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes are also part of this posterior complex.\n\nThe spatial arrangement of these lobes has been detailed in a 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish. This atlas, created using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological data, provides anterior, posterior, and side views of the 32 identified brain lobes, clarifying their relative positions. Studies on other cuttlefish species, such as *Sepia officinalis*, have described a similar organization of the palliovisceral ganglion (an older term for the palliovisceral lobe complex), consisting of a central palliovisceral lobe, paired fin lobes, paired posterior chromatophore lobes, and paired vasomotor lobes. The entire subesophageal mass, which houses the palliovisceral complex, is involved in controlling motor functions. The posterior subesophageal mass in *Sepia* is composed of five paired lobes: the posterior chromatophore lobe, the posterior posterior chromatophore lobe, the fin lobe, the palliovisceral lobe, and the magnocellular lobe."
