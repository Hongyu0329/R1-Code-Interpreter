    "Andrei Voznesensky was referring to Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nThe story of Rezanov, a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer, is the subject of Voznesensky's famous rock opera, \"Juno and Avos,\" for which he wrote the poetry. First performed in 1981, the opera tells the tragic love story between Rezanov and María de la Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco, whom he met in 1806.\n\nRezanov was a central figure in the Russian-American Company and a commander of the first Russian circumnavigation of the Earth, befitting the description of a \"sailor.\" After becoming engaged to Argüello, he sailed for Russia to obtain official permission to marry a Catholic but died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807.\n\nThe question in the poem, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" alludes to the fate of Rezanov's burial site. His original grave was destroyed by the Bolsheviks. The immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos\" in the 1980s revived widespread interest in his story, leading to the \"answer\" about his grave emerging. In 2000, a new memorial was dedicated at his gravesite in Krasnoyarsk, which is inscribed with lines from Voznesensky's opera. In a symbolic reunion, soil and a rose from Argüello's grave in California were brought to his memorial.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
