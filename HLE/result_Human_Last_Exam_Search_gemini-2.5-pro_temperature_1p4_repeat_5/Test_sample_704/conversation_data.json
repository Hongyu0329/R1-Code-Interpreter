    "When yellow and blue are mixed, the resulting color is green. On Isaac Newton's color circle, he associated the seven colors of the spectrum with the seven notes of a Dorian musical scale starting on D. In this scale, the colors are assigned to notes as follows: Red (D), Orange (E), Yellow (F), Green (G), Blue (A), Indigo (B), and Violet (C).\n\nThe color produced by combining yellow and blue is green, which corresponds to the musical note G. The color blue itself corresponds to the musical note A. The question asks for the musical note that corresponds to the range between green and blue. This range on the color circle represents the transition from the note G to the note A. As the question asks for a single musical note, the note corresponding to the beginning of this range, green, is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
