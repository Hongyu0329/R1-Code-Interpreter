    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must identify the pattern of dactyls (one long syllable followed by two short syllables, D) and spondees (two long syllables, S) across the six feet of the line. This process involves analyzing syllable length (quantity), which is determined by the vowel's nature or by its position, and accounting for elisions.\n\nThe line is scanned as follows:\n\n**Dactyl - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Spondee**\n\nHere is a foot-by-foot breakdown of the scansion:\n\n1.  **First Foot:** `verum ubi`\n    *   This undergoes elision, where the `-um` of `verum` is dropped before the initial vowel of `ubi`, effectively becoming `ver' ubi`.\n    *   The first syllable, `ver`, is long by position because its short vowel 'e' is followed by two consonants, 'r' and the 'b' from `ubi`.\n    *   The syllables `u` and `bi` are both short.\n    *   This creates a **Dactyl** (long-short-short).\n\n2.  **Second Foot:** `equi atque`\n    *   The syllable `e-` would typically be short. However, due to the metrical stress (ictus) falling on the beginning of the foot, it is scanned as long.\n    *   The `i` in `equi` elides with the `a` in `atque`. The syllable `at` is long by position (the vowel 'a' is followed by the consonants 't' and 'q').\n    *   This results in a **Spondee** (long-long).\n\n3.  **Third Foot:** `atque hominis`\n    *   The `-que` of `atque` elides with `hominis` (`atqu' hominis`).\n    *   The syllable `at` is long by position.\n    *   The syllables `ho-` and `mi-` from `hominis` are both short.\n    *   This forms a **Dactyl** (long-short-short), leaving the final syllable `-nis`.\n\n4.  **Fourth Foot:** `nis casu`\n    *   The syllable `nis` is long by position because its vowel 'i' is followed by the two consonants 's' and 'c'.\n    *   The first syllable of `casu`, `cā-`, contains a naturally long 'a'.\n    *   This foot is a **Spondee** (long-long), leaving `-su`.\n\n5.  **Fifth Foot:** `su convenit`\n    *   The second syllable of `casu`, `sū`, has a naturally long 'u'.\n    *   The first syllable of `convenit`, `con-`, is long by position.\n    *   This makes a fifth-foot **Spondee** (long-long), which is less common but occurs in Latin poetry.\n\n6.  **Sixth Foot:** `venit imago`\n    *   The remaining syllables are `-vēnit imāgō`. The syllable `vē-` is long by nature (from the perfect tense `convēnit`). The following syllable, `nĭt`, is short. The last syllable of a hexameter line is always treated as long. In this case, the `i` of `imago` is elided with the preceding `-it`, and the final two syllables `-ma-go` form a spondee. More accurately, `vēnit` and the following `īmāgō` (`-vēn' īmāgō`) scan as a **Spondee**. The `vē` is long, and the syllable `nīt` (with elision) is also scanned as long.\n\n<<<D S D S S S>>>"
