    "The Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as $C_4 \\times C_2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of the Galois group:\n<h3>1. Structure of the Field Extension</h3>\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field $L$ is given by $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nLet's define the base field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its Galois group, $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $C_2 \\times C_2$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n\nThe field $L$ can be seen as an extension of $K$, namely $L = K(\\alpha)$. The element $\\alpha$ is the square root of $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$, which is an element of $K$.\n\n<h3>2. Degree of the Extension</h3>\nThe degree of the total extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is given by the product $[L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\nThe degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, and 2 otherwise.\n\nTo check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, we can compute the norm of $\\beta$ with respect to a sub-extension, for example $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $\\beta$ were a square in $K$, its norm would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The norm is:\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) \\cdot ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}))$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (4+4\\sqrt{2}+2)(9-3) = (6+4\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot 6 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis can be written as $12(3+2\\sqrt{2}) = 12(1+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nFor this to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 12 must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. An element $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 12$ would require $a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}=12$, which implies $ab=0$. If $b=0$, $a^2=12$, and if $a=0$, $2b^2=12 \\implies b^2=6$. Neither case gives a rational solution for $a$ or $b$.\nThus, 12 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which means $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$.\n\nTherefore, $[L:K] = 2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$. The Galois group $G = Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a group of order 8.\n\n<h3>3. Galois Properties of the Extension</h3>\nThe field $L$ is a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. This can be shown by demonstrating that all conjugates of the generator $\\alpha$ lie within $L$. The conjugates are of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. By showing that the ratios $\\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ and $\\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ are squares in $K$, one can prove that all conjugates are in $L$.\n\n<h3>4. Structure of the Galois Group</h3>\nThe possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, $D_4$ (dihedral), and $Q_8$ (quaternion).\n\nThe extension $L/K$ is normal, so $Gal(L/K)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. The quotient group $G/Gal(L/K)$ is isomorphic to $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. This fact eliminates the cyclic group $C_8$ as a possibility.\n\nBy analyzing the action of the automorphisms, we find that the group is abelian. This can be established by constructing lifts of the automorphisms of $K$ to $L$ and showing that they commute. Let $\\sigma_2$ be the automorphism of $K$ sending $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and fixing $\\sqrt{3}$, and $\\sigma_3$ be the one sending $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$ and fixing $\\sqrt{2}$. One can define lifts $\\hat{\\sigma_2}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma_3}$ in $G$. It can be shown that these lifts commute, making $G$ an abelian group.\n\nAs an abelian group of order 8, the possibilities are $C_4 \\times C_2$ and $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\nWe can find elements of order 4 in the group $G$. For instance, a lift of $\\sigma_2$ can be shown to have order 4. This eliminates $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group $G$ must be isomorphic to $C_4 \\times C_2$.\n\nThis conclusion can be further confirmed by examining the subfield structure of $L$. A group of type $C_4 \\times C_2$ has three subgroups of index 2, two of which are cyclic ($C_4$) and one which is Klein four ($C_2 \\times C_2$). These correspond to three distinct quadratic subfields of $L$. These subfields are indeed $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. The subgroup structure of $G$ matches this field structure, which is different from the subgroup structures of $D_4$ or $Q_8$.\n\n<<<C₄ × C₂>>>"
