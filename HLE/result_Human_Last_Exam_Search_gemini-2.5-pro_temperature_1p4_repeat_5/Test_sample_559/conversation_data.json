    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first need to identify the equilibrium points and their stability. The system is:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find the solutions $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the equation for $d'(t) = 0$:\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    $2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$ are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system, $J(u, d)$:\nLet $F(u,d) = u^3 - u^2$ and $G(u,d) = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4-u^3$.\n$$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point:\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $$J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (-3+10)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7-3+4 & -4-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    Since the matrix is lower triangular, the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. With one positive and one negative eigenvalue, the point **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $$J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -3+4 & -3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. With two positive eigenvalues, the point **(1, 0) is an unstable node (source)**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $$J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    The linearization is inconclusive, so this is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nSeparatrices are special trajectories that form the boundaries of different regions of flow behavior. They are typically the stable and unstable manifolds associated with saddle points. We have a saddle point at (1, -1).\n\nThe eigenvectors of $J(1, -1)$ give the directions of the stable and unstable manifolds at this point.\n*   For the unstable manifold ($\\lambda_1 = 1$): The eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$, which corresponds to a slope of -2.\n*   For the stable manifold ($\\lambda_2 = -2$): The eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which corresponds to the vertical line $u=1$.\n\nThe separatrix is often an invariant curve that represents one of these manifolds. Let's search for an explicit solution curve of the form $d=f(u)$. The slope of such a curve is given by:\n$$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4-u^3}{u^3-u^2}$$\n\nLet's test if a simple polynomial solution exists. We can try the form $d = au^2$. To be an invariant curve, it must satisfy the original system's equations for all time $t$. Let's substitute $d=-u^2$ into the first differential equation.\nFirst, we find $d'$ in terms of $u$ and $u'$:\n$d(t) = -u(t)^2 \\implies d'(t) = -2u(t)u'(t)$\nSubstitute the expression for $u'(t)$:\n$d'(t) = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow, substitute $d=-u^2$ into the right-hand side of the first differential equation:\n$2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) + u^4-u^3$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n$= (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$\n$= -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nSince both sides are equal, the curve **$d = -u^2$** is an exact solution trajectory (an invariant manifold).\n\nLet's check if this curve corresponds to one of the manifolds of the saddle point (1, -1).\n*   The curve $d=-u^2$ passes through $(1, -(1)^2) = (1, -1)$, which is the saddle point.\n*   The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is -2. This matches the direction of the unstable manifold we found from the eigenvector analysis.\n\nTherefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1). This manifold acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane into regions of different long-term behavior. For instance, for $0 < u < 1$, trajectories starting above this curve are attracted toward the origin (0,0), while those below it are repelled downwards.\n\n"
