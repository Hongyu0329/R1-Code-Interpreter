    "Based on the provided search results, the most common and efficient method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) involves heating xenon and fluorine gas.\n\nThe synthesis is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (often in a 1:5 molar ratio) in a nickel vessel at a temperature of approximately 400°C. The nickel container is used because it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride, preventing corrosion. This thermal method is considered efficient, with one source reporting a 100% yield with respect to the xenon used.\n\nWhile the temperature can range between 350°C and 450°C, 400°C is the preferred and most frequently cited temperature for an effective reaction. Lower temperatures can favor the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF2), while higher temperatures and excess fluorine can lead to xenon hexafluoride (XeF6), making 400°C an optimal temperature to specifically target XeF4.\n\nOther methods exist, such as using an electric discharge at low temperatures, but these can result in significant contamination with XeF2. Another synthesis technique involves initiating the reaction with a heated wire at 650-700°C to start the combustion of xenon in fluorine, which is a different methodology than sustained heating of the entire vessel. Considering the standard, efficient production method of sustained heating, 400°C is the established temperature.\n\nOf the choices given, 400°C is the lowest temperature listed at which Xenon tetrafluoride is repeatedly cited to be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
