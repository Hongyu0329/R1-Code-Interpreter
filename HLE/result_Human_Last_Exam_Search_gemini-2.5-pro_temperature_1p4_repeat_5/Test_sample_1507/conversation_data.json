    "The minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20. This is because the outer-hull, also known as the convex hull, of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces. These 20 triangles form the visible surface of the convex hull. Therefore, a triangulation of this outer-hull would consist of these 20 triangles.\n\nThe great icosahedron itself is a non-convex polyhedron with 20 intersecting triangular faces. However, the question specifically asks for the triangulation of its outer-hull, which simplifies the problem to determining the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n\n<<<20>>>"
