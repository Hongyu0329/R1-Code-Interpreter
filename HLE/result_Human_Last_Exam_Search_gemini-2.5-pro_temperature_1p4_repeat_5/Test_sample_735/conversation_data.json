    "Fifteen finite groups are known to contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3. This classification was completed by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart, who proved that any such group must have an order of 24 or less.\n\nA product-free set in a group G is a subset S where for any two elements a and b in S (including when a and b are the same element), their product *ab* is not in S. Such a set is considered maximal by inclusion, or locally maximal, if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe complete list of these groups, as compiled in the work of Anabanti and Hart, is presented below. This list is based on a table that catalogues all such groups and their corresponding product-free sets.\n\nThe fifteen groups are:\n*   **Cyclic Groups:**\n    *   C5 (Cyclic group of order 5)\n    *   C6 (Cyclic group of order 6)\n    *   C7 (Cyclic group of order 7)\n    *   C8 (Cyclic group of order 8)\n    *   C9 (Cyclic group of order 9)\n    *   C10 (Cyclic group of order 10)\n    *   C12 (Cyclic group of order 12)\n\n*   **Dihedral Groups:**\n    *   D6 (Dihedral group of order 6, isomorphic to the Symmetric group S3)\n    *   D8 (Dihedral group of order 8)\n    *   D10 (Dihedral group of order 10)\n    *   D12 (Dihedral group of order 12)\n    *   D14 (Dihedral group of order 14)\n\n*   **Other Groups:**\n    *   A4 (Alternating group on 4 elements)\n    *   Q8 (Quaternion group)\n    *   Q12 (Dicyclic group of order 12)\n\nThe work of Giudici and Hart initially identified many of these groups, and their list was proven to be complete by Anabanti and Hart who demonstrated that no group of order greater than 24 could possess such a set.\n\n<<<15>>>"
