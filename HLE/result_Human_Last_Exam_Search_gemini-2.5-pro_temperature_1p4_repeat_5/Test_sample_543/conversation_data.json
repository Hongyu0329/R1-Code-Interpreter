    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent) in refluxing THF, followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the substitution of all three halogen atoms with phenyl groups.\n\nThe reactivity of halogens on an aromatic ring towards Grignard reagents follows the order I > Br > Cl > F. This means the iodine atom will react first, followed by the two bromine atoms. Given that phenyl magnesium bromide is in excess, the reaction is driven to completion, replacing all halogen substituents.\n\nThe sequence of reaction is as follows:\n1.  **First Substitution:** The most reactive C-I bond is replaced by a phenyl group to form 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n2.  **Second and Third Substitutions:** The excess phenyl magnesium bromide then reacts with the two C-Br bonds, replacing them with phenyl groups.\n\nThe final product is a benzene ring substituted with three phenyl groups at positions 1, 2, and 3. The aqueous work-up serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent. The IUPAC name for this product is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
