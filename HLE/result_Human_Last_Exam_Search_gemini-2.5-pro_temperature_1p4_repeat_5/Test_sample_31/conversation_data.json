    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case while solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube with the CFOP method, a solver needs to observe a specific number of stickers on the last layer's side faces. The PLL step involves permuting the already oriented last layer pieces into their final solved positions. There are 21 possible PLL cases to distinguish between.\n\nExperienced speedcubers often use a technique called 2-sided PLL recognition. This method allows the solver to identify the PLL case by only looking at two adjacent faces of the cube (for example, the front and right faces). When viewing two adjacent faces, a total of six stickers on the last layer (excluding the top face) are visible. These six stickers consist of:\n*   Two stickers on the front-right corner piece.\n*   One sticker on the front-left corner piece.\n*   One sticker on the back-right corner piece.\n*   One sticker on the front edge piece.\n*   One sticker on the right edge piece.\n\nHowever, not all six of these stickers are necessary for a unique identification. The two visible stickers on the front-right corner piece belong to the same corner cubie. Since the top color is already known (as all pieces are oriented), seeing one of these side stickers is enough to determine the identity and position of that corner piece. Therefore, one of these two stickers is redundant.\n\nThis reduces the minimum number of stickers that must be seen to five. It has been demonstrated that with these five stickers, it is possible to distinguish between all 21 PLL cases. This concept is sometimes referred to as \"5 Sticker PLL Recognition\".\n\nTherefore, to fully identify the PLL case, a minimum of 5 non-top-facing stickers must be seen.\n\n<<<5>>>"
