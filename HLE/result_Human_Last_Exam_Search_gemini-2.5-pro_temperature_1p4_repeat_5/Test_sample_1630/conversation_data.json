    "Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The fixed points of $h(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n**1. Degree of the composed polynomial:**\n$f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n$g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial whose degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\nDegree of $h(x) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n**2. The fixed-point equation:**\nThe fixed points are the roots of the equation $f(g(x)) = x$, which can be rewritten as $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\nThis is a polynomial equation. The degree of the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is 9. A polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**3. Conditions on the derivatives:**\nWe are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\nThis means that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\nLet's analyze the derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\nSince $f'(y) > 0$ for any value $y$, and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, their product $h'(x)$ is also strictly positive for all $x$. This implies that $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n**4. Intersections of $h(x)$ with the line $y=x$:**\nWe are looking for the maximum number of solutions to $h(x) = x$. Geometrically, this is the maximum number of times the graph of the strictly increasing function $y=h(x)$ can intersect the line $y=x$. While a strictly increasing function can intersect a horizontal line at most once, it can intersect a non-horizontal line like $y=x$ multiple times.\n\n**5. Analysis using Rolle's Theorem:**\nLet $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. To find the maximum number of roots of $P(x)$, we can analyze its derivative, $P'(x)$. By Rolle's Theorem, between any two roots of $P(x)$, there must be at least one root of $P'(x)$. Therefore, if $P'(x)$ has $k$ roots, $P(x)$ can have at most $k+1$ roots.\n\n$P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\nLet's determine the degree of the polynomial $f'(g(x))g'(x)$:\n- $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$ (degree 2)\n- $g(x)$ is degree 3.\n- $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n- $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$ (degree 2).\n- The product $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nThe equation $P'(x)=0$ is equivalent to $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$. Since $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8, it can have at most 8 real roots.\nIf $P'(x)$ has at most 8 real roots, then $P(x)$ can have at most $8+1=9$ real roots.\n\n**6. Achievability of 9 fixed points:**\nThe analysis above shows that the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9. To show that 9 is achievable, one must demonstrate that there exist polynomials $f$ and $g$ satisfying the conditions such that $f(g(x))-x=0$ has 9 real roots. This requires constructing polynomials where the degree 8 polynomial $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ oscillates in a way that it intersects the line $y=1$ at 8 distinct points.\n\nThe conditions $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ imply that these quadratic derivatives are always positive. Let the minimum value of $f'(x)$ be $m_f > 0$ and the minimum of $g'(x)$ be $m_g > 0$. The product $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8 with a positive leading coefficient, so it tends to $+\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$. For the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x)=1$ to have roots, the minimum value of this product must be less than or equal to 1. This can be achieved by choosing $f$ and $g$ such that $m_f \\cdot m_g < 1$.\nBy carefully choosing the coefficients of the polynomials $f$ and $g$, it is possible to make the polynomial $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ have 4 local minima whose values are below 1 and 3 local maxima whose values are above 1. This would result in 8 real roots for $P'(x)=0$, which in turn allows for $P(x)=0$ to have 9 real roots.\n\nWhile the explicit construction of such polynomials is complex, the theoretical framework does not preclude the existence of 9 fixed points. The general result for the composition of two polynomials of degrees $m$ and $n$ is that the number of fixed points is at most $mn$. In this case, that is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThe maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
