    "The question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph with 128 vertices.\n\nLet G be a graph with n = 128 vertices. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. An induced subgraph that is a clique is formed by a subset of vertices where all vertices in the subset are connected to each other in the original graph.\n\nLet ω(G) be the clique number of the graph G, which is the size of the largest clique in G. If a graph G contains an induced clique of size *k*, denoted as K_k, then any subset of *j* vertices from this clique (where *j* < *k*) will also form an induced clique, K_j. This is because all vertices in the K_k are fully connected, so any subset of these vertices will also be fully connected.\n\nThis implies that if a graph has an induced clique of its maximum possible size, ω(G), it will also have induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to ω(G). Therefore, the set of all possible induced clique sizes in any graph G is {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}. The number of different clique sizes is simply ω(G).\n\nThe problem then becomes finding the maximum possible clique number, ω(G), for a graph with 128 vertices. The clique number of a graph on *n* vertices cannot exceed *n*. A complete graph, K_n, is a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For such a graph with 128 vertices, K_128, the largest clique is the entire graph itself, meaning its clique number is 128.\n\nIn the complete graph K_128, any subset of *k* vertices, for any *k* from 1 to 128, forms an induced clique of size *k*. Consequently, the K_128 graph contains induced cliques of all possible sizes from 1 to 128. This means there are 128 different clique sizes.\n\nSince no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique larger than 128, the maximum number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
