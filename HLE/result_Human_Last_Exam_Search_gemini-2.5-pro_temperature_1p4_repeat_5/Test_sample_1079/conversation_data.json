    "To determine the number of elements in the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10, we can follow a step-by-step logical process based on the theory of Coxeter groups.\n\nFirst, some key properties of the H3 reflection group are needed:\n*   **Group Order:** The H3 group, also known as the icosahedral group, consists of 120 elements.\n*   **Coxeter Number:** The Coxeter number, denoted by *h*, for H3 is 10.\n*   **Degrees of Invariants:** The degrees of the fundamental invariants for H3 are 2, 6, and 10.\n\nThe question asks for the number of group elements, let's call them *g*, that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  *g* has an eigenvalue, let's call it λ, whose order is 10.\n2.  The eigenvector corresponding to λ is \"regular,\" meaning it does not lie on any of the reflection hyperplanes of the group.\n\nThe existence of a regular eigenvector for an element *g* has a profound implication in the theory of reflection groups: it means that *g* must be a \"regular element\". A key theorem states that an element is regular if and only if it is conjugate to a Coxeter element. A Coxeter element is formed by multiplying all the simple reflections of the group.\n\nFor the H3 group, it's a known property that all of its Coxeter elements are conjugate to each other. This means that all regular elements in H3 form a single conjugacy class.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the total number of regular elements in H3, which is equivalent to calculating the size of the conjugacy class of any Coxeter element, *c*.\n\nThe size of the conjugacy class of an element *c* in a group *W* is given by the formula: |W| / |C<sub>W</sub>(c)|, where |W| is the order of the group and |C<sub>W</sub>(c)| is the order of the centralizer of *c* (the subgroup of elements that commute with *c*).\n\n*   We know |W| = 120 for H3.\n*   A classical result for irreducible finite Coxeter groups, which includes H3, states that the centralizer of a Coxeter element *c* is the cyclic group generated by *c* itself.\n\nThe order of this cyclic group, <c>, is simply the order of the Coxeter element, which is the Coxeter number, *h*. For H3, *h* = 10.\n\nSo, the number of regular elements is:\nNumber of regular elements = 120 / 10 = 12.\n\nEach of these 12 regular elements is conjugate to a Coxeter element and thus shares its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element are given by the formula *e*<sup>2πi(m-1)/h</sup>, where *m* are the degrees of the fundamental invariants. For H3, with degrees 2, 6, and 10, the eigenvalues are:\n*   *e*<sup>2πi(2-1)/10</sup> = *e*<sup>πi/5</sup> (Order 10)\n*   *e*<sup>2πi(6-1)/10</sup> = *e*<sup>πi</sup> = -1 (Order 2)\n*   *e*<sup>2πi(10-1)/10</sup> = *e*<sup>9πi/5</sup> (Order 10)\n\nA theorem by Springer on regular eigenvalues states that an eigenvector is regular if and only if its corresponding eigenvalue *e*<sup>2πik/h</sup> has `gcd(k, h) = 1`. In this case, with h=10, the eigenvalues of order 10 correspond to k=1 and k=9. Both are coprime to 10, meaning their corresponding eigenvectors are regular. The eigenvalue of order 2 corresponds to k=5, which is not coprime to 10, so its eigenvector is not regular.\n\nThus, each of the 12 regular elements in H3 has two eigenvalues of order 10, and both of these have regular eigenvectors. Since the question asks for the number of elements with this property, and all 12 regular elements satisfy it, the answer is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
