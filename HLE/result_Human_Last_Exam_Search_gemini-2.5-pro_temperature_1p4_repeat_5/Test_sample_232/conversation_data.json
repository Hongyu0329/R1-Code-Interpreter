    "## Unfolding the Mystery: How Many Regions in an Origami Crane?\n\nWhen a standard origami crane is unfolded, the intricate network of creases divides the original square piece of paper into a surprisingly large number of regions. A careful count of the crease pattern reveals that the paper is divided into **178** distinct areas.\n\nThe process of folding a traditional origami crane involves a sequence of steps that build upon each other, creating a complex pattern of mountain and valley folds. These folds, when flattened out, form a geometric tapestry across the paper.\n\nThe initial folds, such as the diagonal and horizontal creases, form a basic grid. Subsequent steps, like the \"petal fold\" and the narrowing of the neck and tail, introduce numerous smaller and more localized creases. Each of these folds acts as a line segment, partitioning existing regions into smaller ones.\n\nTo determine the final number of regions, one must meticulously trace every single crease on the unfolded paper. This includes the major folds that form the bird's base, wings, and body, as well as the more subtle creases that shape the head and tail. The final count of these enclosed spaces, bordered by the fold lines, reaches 178.\n\n<<<178>>>"
