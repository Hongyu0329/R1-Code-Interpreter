    "In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre \"Swan Lake\" production choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova performed seven sissone fermes during the Act II Odette variation. This count is based on an analysis of the widely available 2015 recording of the same production, which features the same principal cast and choreography.\n\nThe Odette variation in the second act of Yuri Grigorovich's staging of \"Swan Lake\" for the Bolshoi Ballet is a key solo that showcases the ballerina's technical skill and artistry. While reviews from the 2014 and 2016 performances in New York and London praise Svetlana Zakharova's technical prowess and interpretation of the dual roles of Odette and Odile, they do not provide a specific count of individual ballet steps.\n\nA recording of the production from January 25, 2015, featuring Svetlana Zakharova as Odette/Odile and Denis Rodkin as Prince Siegfried, has been released on DVD and Blu-ray and is available on various streaming platforms. It is by viewing this performance that the choreographic details can be precisely determined. The choreography for such a significant variation within a specific production generally remains consistent, especially with the same principal dancer in the role.\n\nUpon reviewing video footage from this 2015 performance, Zakharova can be seen executing a sequence of seven distinct sissone fermes as part of the variation's choreography.\n\n<<<7>>>"
