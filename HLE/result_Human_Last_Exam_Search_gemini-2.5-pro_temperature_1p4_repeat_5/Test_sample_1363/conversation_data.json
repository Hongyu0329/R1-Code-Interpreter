    "In the European Tango, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.\n\nThe technique of the European Tango is characterized by its staccato nature, which contrasts with the continuous, flowing movements of the waltzes and foxtrot. In the Open Reverse Turn, there is a specific point where the rotation intentionally stops. A video demonstration of the figure explicitly states that on the third step, when the lady is outside, the couple does not turn. Continuing to turn at this point is identified as an error that results in an incorrect shape.\n\nThis deliberate pause in rotation is a fundamental aspect of the Tango's technique for this figure. Overturning a turn inherently implies adding more rotation than is standard. To do so in a Tango Reverse Turn would require turning continuously through the part of the figure where rotation is meant to cease, thus fundamentally violating the dance's established technique.\n\nIn the other dances listed:\n*   **Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep** are all characterized by continuous motion. While overturning is generally considered poor form in basic figures, it is technically possible and the concept of varying the amount of turn (both under- and overturning) exists within their broader syllabi to navigate the dance floor or enter into different figures. For instance, in Viennese Waltz, it is acknowledged that a reverse turn *would need* to be overturned to get around a corner, though it is described as very difficult.\n\nTherefore, the European Tango is the unique case among the choices where the fundamental technique of a key reverse turn figure explicitly forbids the continuous rotation that would be necessary to overturn it.\n\n<<<C>>>"
