The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (denoted by Y and Z) to calculate the normalized magnetic helicity of Alfv√©n ion cyclotron waves at the L1 point does not imply an assumption that the local magnetic field is radial. Instead, it is standard practice to define a local coordinate system where the principal axis is aligned with the direction of the local mean magnetic field, as AIC waves propagate along these field lines. The Y and Z components in such a system are, by definition, perpendicular to the local magnetic field. The interplanetary magnetic field at L1 is known to follow the Parker spiral and is typically not radial. Therefore, the calculation is consistent with the physics of AIC wave propagation.
