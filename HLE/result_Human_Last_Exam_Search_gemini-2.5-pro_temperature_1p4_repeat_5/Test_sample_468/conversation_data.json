    "The currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range of North America is \"fairy bees\". This name is used in various publications and resources.\n\nThe native range of the *Perdita* genus is North America, with a high diversity in the desert regions of the United States and Mexico. The common name \"fairy bees\" is often used to refer to these small-sized bees. Some sources also refer to them as \"miner bees,\" a name also used for other groups of bees that nest in the ground.\n\nWhile the common name \"fairy bees\" is widely used, the exact year it was coined is not well-documented in the available resources. An article from the Vermont Center for Ecostudies notes that common names for bees are a relatively recent development and often not standardized. There is an unsubstantiated rumor on an iNaturalist forum that the name was first used on Twitter.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, year of coinage not documented>>>"
