    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), there have been 10 players who have won the traditional batting Triple Crown in the American and National Leagues, with two of those players achieving the feat twice, for a total of 12 Triple Crowns since RBIs became an official statistic in 1920. However, with the formal inclusion of statistics from the Negro Leagues, the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history is recognized as 27, with some sources citing 28 winners.\n\nThe Triple Crown is a prestigious accomplishment for a hitter who leads their league in three specific statistical categories in a single season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the Triple Crown winners:\n\n**American and National League Triple Crown Winners:**\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012), Detroit Tigers (AL)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967), Boston Red Sox (AL)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966), Baltimore Orioles (AL)\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956), New York Yankees (AL)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942 & 1947), Boston Red Sox (AL)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937), St. Louis Cardinals (NL)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934), New York Yankees (AL)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933), Philadelphia Athletics (AL)\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933), Philadelphia Phillies (NL)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922 & 1925), St. Louis Cardinals (NL)\n\nBefore RBIs were officially tracked in 1920, other players led their leagues in these three categories:\n*   **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912), Chicago Cubs (NL)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909), Detroit Tigers (AL)\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901), Philadelphia Athletics (AL)\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894), Boston Beaneaters (NL)\n*   **Tip O'Neill** (1887), St. Louis Browns (American Association)\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878), Providence Grays (NL)\n\n**Negro Leagues Triple Crown Winners:**\n\nFollowing MLB's decision in 2020 to incorporate statistics from the Negro Leagues (1920-1948), several more players are now recognized as Triple Crown winners. This addition has expanded the historical record to include these remarkable athletes:\n*   **Ted Strong** (1942)\n*   **Lennie Pearson** (1942)\n*   **Josh Gibson** (1936 & 1937)\n*   **Willie Wells** (1930)\n*   **Mule Suttles** (1926)\n*   **Oscar Charleston** (1921, 1924, & 1925)\n*   **Heavy Johnson** (1923)\n\nFour players in MLB history have won multiple Triple Crowns: Oscar Charleston (3), and Rogers Hornsby, Josh Gibson, and Ted Williams, who each won it twice.\n\n<<<27>>>"
