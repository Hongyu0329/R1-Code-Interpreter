The upper bound is $V^{1/n}$, where $V$ is the covolume of the n-dimensional lattice. For specific classes of lattices determined by a squarefree natural number $N$, $V$ will be a function of $N$. For example, for the ring of integers of a number field of degree $n$ with a squarefree discriminant $N$, the upper bound is $|N|^{1/(2n)}$.
