An optimal bifunctional catalyst consists of a Group IV metal, either Zirconium for high activity or Hafnium for thermal stability, with tetraneopentyl ligands supported on highly Br√∏nsted acidic sulfated alumina. This catalyst efficiently breaks down polyolefins into short saturated alkanes in the presence of hydrogen gas and acts as an effective catalyst for olefin polymerization in the absence of hydrogen.
