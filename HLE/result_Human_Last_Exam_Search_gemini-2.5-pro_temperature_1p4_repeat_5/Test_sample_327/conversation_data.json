    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to understand how fractional values are constructed in this game.\n\nIn red-blue-Hackenbush, dyadic rational numbers (fractions with a denominator that is a power of 2) can be represented by a single \"stalk\" of red and blue pieces connected to the ground. The value of such a stalk is determined by the color and position of each piece. Starting from the piece connected to the ground, the piece at position *n* (with *n*=1 for the lowest piece) contributes a value of $\\pm \\frac{1}{2^n}$ to the total value of the stalk. A blue piece contributes a positive value, and a red piece contributes a negative value.\n\nOur goal is to find a sequence of red and blue pieces whose values sum to $\\frac{13}{16}$. This is equivalent to expressing $\\frac{13}{16}$ as a sum or difference of powers of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe binary representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$ is $0.1101$, which corresponds to:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nA direct translation of this binary representation into Hackenbush pieces would require a way to represent the '0' at the $\\frac{1}{8}$ position, which is not possible in a simple stalk as each position must be occupied by a piece.\n\nTherefore, we need to find an alternative representation. We can express $\\frac{13}{16}$ as follows:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{14}{16} - \\frac{1}{16}$\nWe can then expand $\\frac{14}{16}$:\n$\\frac{14}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nSo, we can write $\\frac{13}{16}$ as:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nThis expression can be directly translated into a red-blue-Hackenbush stalk:\n*   A **blue** piece at position 1, valued at $+\\frac{1}{2}$.\n*   A **blue** piece at position 2, valued at $+\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   A **blue** piece at position 3, valued at $+\\frac{1}{8}$.\n*   A **red** piece at position 4, valued at $-\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThis construction results in a stalk made of four pieces: three blue and one red. The total value is $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{8+4+2-1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nSince the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ has a denominator of $16 = 2^4$, any representation in this form must include a piece at the fourth position to achieve this denominator. Therefore, a minimum of four pieces is required.\n\n<<<4>>>"
