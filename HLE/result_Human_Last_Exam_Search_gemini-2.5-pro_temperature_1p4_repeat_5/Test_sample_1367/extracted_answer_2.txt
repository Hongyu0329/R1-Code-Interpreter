(a) No. The vertex algebra \(V(p)\) is not simple for all \(p \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}\). The simplicity and even the algebraic structure of \(V(p)\) depend on the value of p. For example, for \(p=2\), \(V(2)\) is known to be the simple small N=4 superconformal vertex algebra. However, for other values of p, the universal vertex algebra at the level \(k = -2 + 1/p\) can contain singular vectors, leading to non-trivial ideals. The structure of \(V(p)\) varies significantly with p, being a vertex operator superalgebra if p is even, and an abelian intertwining algebra if p is odd and not a multiple of 4, making a uniform statement of simplicity for all p incorrect.

(b) must contain a singular vector. If a non-trivial ideal exists in a vertex algebra like \(V(p)\) (which is constructed as a highest-weight representation), it must be generated by a singular vector (a highest-weight vector of a proper submodule). An ideal \(I\) is a subspace of \(V(p)\) that is closed under the action of all elements of \(V(p)\). Since \(V(p)\) contains \(L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)\) as a subalgebra, any ideal of \(V(p)\) is automatically also a module for \(L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)\). However, the fundamental condition for the existence of the non-trivial ideal itself is the presence of a singular vector.

(c) No. The simplicity of \(V(p)\) as a vertex algebra does not imply its irreducibility as an \(L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)\)-module. In fact, \(V(p)\) is known to be highly reducible. It decomposes into a direct sum of infinitely many irreducible \(L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)\)-modules, as shown by the decomposition \(V(p) \cong \bigoplus_{n=0}^\infty \rho_n \otimes L_n^{(p)}\), where \(\rho_n\) are finite-dimensional irreducible \(\mathfrak{sl}_2\)-modules and \(L_n^{(p)}\) are irreducible highest-weight modules for \(L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)\). Simplicity of a vertex algebra means it has no proper ideals, which is a different and weaker condition than being irreducible as a module for a subalgebra.
