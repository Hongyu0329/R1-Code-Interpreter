    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `abcdefg`. In this pattern, the 'a' and 'd' positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues that form the core of the coiled-coil through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing. The specific amino acids at these positions are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Heptad Repeat:**\n    The sequence is 29 amino acids long. We look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues at positions `i` and `i+3` (for the 'a' and 'd' positions). Let's analyze the sequence `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`.\n    A consistent hydrophobic pattern can be established by assigning the `a, b, c, d, e, f, g` register as follows:\n    *   Sequence: `G E I (A) Q S (L) K E I (A) K S (L) K E I (A) W S (L) K E I (A) Q S (L) K G`\n    *   Register: `g'g'g'(a) b c (d) e f g (a) b c (d) e f g (a) b c (d) e f g (a) b c (d) e'f'g'`\n\n    This alignment reveals a highly regular pattern for the core positions:\n    *   **'a' positions**: Alanine (A) at positions 4, 11, 18, 25.\n    *   **'d' positions**: Leucine (L) at positions 7, 14, 21, 28.\n\n2.  **Applying Knobs-into-Holes Packing Principles:**\n    The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil is heavily influenced by the packing efficiency of the side chains at the 'a' and 'd' positions. Landmark studies, such as those on the GCN4 leucine zipper, have established rules based on the identity of these residues. A key factor is whether the amino acid side chain is branched at its β-carbon (like Isoleucine and Valine) or not (like Leucine and Alanine).\n\n    *   **Dimer (State 2)**: The classic GCN4 dimer is stabilized by Isoleucine (a β-branched residue) at the 'a' position and Leucine (a non-β-branched residue) at the 'd' position (`I-L` pattern).\n    *   **Trimer (State 3)**: Placing Isoleucine at both the 'a' and 'd' positions (`I-I` pattern) favors the formation of trimers.\n    *   **Tetramer (State 4)**: Reversing the canonical dimer pattern to have Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd' (`L-I` pattern) promotes the formation of tetramers.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Given Sequence:**\n    The sequence in question has Alanine (A) at the 'a' positions and Leucine (L) at the 'd' positions. Both Alanine and Leucine are non-β-branched amino acids. This `A(a)-L(d)` pattern lacks the specific steric instructions provided by β-branched residues that are known to drive the formation of higher-order oligomers like trimers and tetramers. The packing of two non-β-branched residues is most analogous to the dimeric state, which represents the most fundamental and common coiled-coil assembly. The absence of specific trimer or tetramer-promoting motifs strongly suggests that the sequence will adopt the default dimeric structure.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of knobs-into-holes packing and the identities of the residues at the 'a' and 'd' core positions, the protein sequence is predicted to form a dimer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
