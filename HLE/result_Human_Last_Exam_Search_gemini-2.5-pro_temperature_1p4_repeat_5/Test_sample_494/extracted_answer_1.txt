Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic spin-zero hydrogens would exhibit tunneling. The potential energy surface that leads to the double-well potential and tunneling is determined by the molecular structure and electronic properties, which are independent of the nuclear spin. The nuclear spin statistics (fermion vs. boson) do, however, affect which rovibrational states are allowed due to the symmetry requirements of the total wavefunction. In this exotic ammonia, the hydrogen nuclei are bosons, so the total wavefunction must be symmetric upon their exchange. This would alter the observed rotational-inversion spectrum compared to normal ammonia, but it would not eliminate the tunneling phenomenon itself.
