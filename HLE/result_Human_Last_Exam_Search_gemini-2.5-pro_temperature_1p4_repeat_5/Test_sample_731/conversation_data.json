    "A power subgroup of a group G, denoted as $G^k$, is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G. To determine the number of distinct power subgroups of the semidihedral group of size 512, $SD_{512}$, we first need to understand its structure and the orders of its elements.\n\nThe semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ of order $2^n$ is defined by the presentation:\n$SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$\n\nFor the semidihedral group of size 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which means $n=9$. The group $SD_{512}$ is therefore given by:\n$SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$\n\nThe elements of $SD_{512}$ consist of two types:\n1.  Elements of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$, which form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order 256.\n2.  Elements of the form $r^i s$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\n\nThe orders of these elements are crucial for finding the power subgroups. The order of $r^i$ is $256/\\gcd(i, 256)$. The orders of the elements $r^i s$ can be determined by calculating $(r^i s)^2$. This calculation shows that the order of $r^i s$ is 2 if $i$ is even, and 4 if $i$ is odd. The maximum order of any element in $SD_{512}$ is 256.\n\nA power subgroup $G^k$ is generated by the set $\\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We only need to consider values of $k$ that are powers of 2, because for any odd integer $d$, the mapping $g \\mapsto g^d$ is a bijection on a 2-group, meaning $G^d = G$. Thus, for any $k = d \\cdot 2^m$ with $d$ odd, $G^k = G^{2^m}$.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups are as follows:\n*   **$G^1 = G = SD_{512}$**: For $k=1$ (or any odd number), we get the group itself.\n*   **$G^2 = \\langle g^2 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$**: The squares of elements of the form $r^i$ generate the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$ of order 128. The squares of elements of the form $r^i s$ are either the identity (if $i$ is even) or $r^{128}$ (if $i$ is odd). Since $r^{128}$ is in $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$, we have $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$, a cyclic group of order 128.\n*   **$G^4 = \\langle g^4 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$**: The fourth powers of elements of the form $r^i$ generate $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$. The fourth power of any element of the form $r^i s$ is the identity, as their orders are 2 or 4. Thus, $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$, a cyclic group of order 64.\n*   **$G^{2^m}$ for $m \\ge 2$**: For any $m \\ge 2$, the $2^m$-th power of any element $r^i s$ is the identity. Therefore, $G^{2^m}$ is generated solely by the $2^m$-th powers of the elements in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$, which results in the subgroup $\\langle r^{2^m} \\rangle$.\n\nThis gives the following descending chain of distinct power subgroups:\n1.  $G^1 = SD_{512}$ (order 512)\n2.  $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (order 128)\n3.  $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$ (order 64)\n4.  $G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n5.  $G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$ (order 16)\n6.  $G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$ (order 8)\n7.  $G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n8.  $G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n9.  $G^{256} = \\{e\\}$ (the trivial subgroup of order 1)\n\nThese nine subgroups are all distinct.\n\n<<<9>>>"
