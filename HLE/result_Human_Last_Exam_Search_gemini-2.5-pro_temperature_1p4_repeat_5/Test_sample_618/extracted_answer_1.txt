The general representation for the infinitesimal transformation on `x` is typically of the form `Î¾(t, x, u) = c_1 + c_2 * x`, where `c_1` and `c_2` are constants representing spatial translation and scaling symmetries, respectively. More complex forms may arise depending on the specific values of `k_1` and `k_2`.
