    "The arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence is a well-established motif for the binding of numerous extracellular matrix proteins to integrin receptors on the surface of cells. The amino acids flanking this core RGD sequence play a crucial role in determining the specificity and affinity of the peptide for different types of integrin receptors.\n\nOf the peptides listed, **RGDSPSS** contains the core sequence RGDS (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Serine). The RGDS peptide has been identified as an integrin binding sequence and has been shown to inhibit the function of integrin receptors in in vitro settings. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated to promote cell attachment and prevent apoptosis in osteoblasts in vitro. Specifically, the Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) peptide, which is functionally equivalent to the RGDS sequence within a larger peptide, has been utilized in in vitro studies to promote osteogenic differentiation in bone tissue engineering models. These findings indicate that a peptide containing the RGDS sequence, such as RGDSPSS, is highly likely to bind to an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay.\n\nThere is less direct evidence in the provided search results for the other peptides:\n\n*   **RGDMAA:** While a similar sequence, ALRGDMA, was identified in a peptide scanning assay, its direct binding to an integrin in vitro was not confirmed.\n*   **RGDLTTP:** This sequence is mentioned in a patent application in the context of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, but direct evidence of its binding to integrins in a standalone in vitro assay is not provided.\n*   **RGDQVSK and RGDARGG:** No specific in vitro binding data for these peptides to integrin receptors were found in the search results.\n\nTherefore, based on the strong evidence for the bioactivity of the contained RGDS sequence, RGDSPSS is the most likely candidate to bind to an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay.\n\n<<<B>>>"
