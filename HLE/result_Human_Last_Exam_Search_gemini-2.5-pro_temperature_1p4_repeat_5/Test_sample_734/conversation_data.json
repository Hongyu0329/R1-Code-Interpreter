    "Augustine of Hippo is the Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology, namely the *rationes seminales* or \"seminal reasons,\" which can be used to describe changes in the laws of nature. This concept is applicable to both the unique event of the virgin birth of Jesus and the potential alterations in the natural order at the time of the Fall.\n\nAugustine introduced the idea of *rationes seminales* to explain how new things could appear in the world after the initial creation, without God having to create them *ex nihilo* (out of nothing) continuously. In his work, particularly in his literal commentary on Genesis (*De Genesi ad litteram*), he proposed that God embedded these \"seed principles\" or latent potentialities into the fabric of creation from the very beginning. These principles are not visible but contain the blueprints for future developments, which then unfold at the appropriate time and under the right conditions.\n\nThis framework allows for events that seem to break the ordinary, observable laws of nature. Augustine argued that a miracle, therefore, is not \"contrary to nature, but contrary to what we know as nature.\" He saw these events as the activation by God of these hidden causal principles which He had woven into creation from the start.\n\nThis theological construct is applicable to both scenarios mentioned in the question:\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** The conception of Jesus without a human father can be understood as the activation of a unique, divinely-willed potentiality that was part of God's plan for salvation, latent within creation until the appointed time. It represents an event outside the *ordinary* course of procreation but not outside the ultimate scope of God's created order, as facilitated by the *rationes seminales*.\n*   **The Fall:** Augustine's theology of the Fall includes a significant shift in the state of humanity and the natural world. He suggested that God could have anticipated the Fall of man and the subsequent curse, incorporating the potential for these changes into the original creation through the *rationes seminales*. Thus, phenomena like pain in childbirth, the difficulty of cultivating the land, and the corruption of the human will are not arbitrary punishments but consequences actualized from potentialities established in God's overarching providential plan.\n\nWhile Thomas Aquinas later developed the concept of \"obediential potency\"—the capacity of a creature to obey God and be used for something beyond its own nature—Augustine's *rationes seminales* is the more encompassing and foundational terminology that provides a mechanism for systemic changes within the laws of nature, as well as for singular miraculous events.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
