    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is not a specific character who visits a Roman city and then describes their religious practices. Instead, the narrative itself, likely from the perspective of the Goths or the narrator, refers to the Romans in a way that directly alludes to the founding myth of Rome.\n\nThe text refers to the Romans as the \"children of the Wolf of Rome,\" a clear reference to the legend of Romulus and Remus. According to Roman mythology, the twin brothers Romulus and Remus were abandoned as infants and suckled by a she-wolf. This story became a central part of Roman identity, and the she-wolf a symbol of the city.\n\nIn the context of the novel, the Goths, who are the protagonists, are in conflict with the invading Roman legions. The reference to the Romans as \"children of the Wolf of Rome\" serves to characterize the invaders through their own foundational myth, as understood by the Goths. This phrasing highlights the totemic emblem of the Romans and contrasts their imperialistic society with the communal life of the Goths. The leader of the Goths is Thiodolf, but there is no indication that he or any other character from the House of the Wolfings traveled to a Roman city.\n\n<<<It is not a character who visited a Roman city, but the narrative itself that refers to the Romans as the \"children of the Wolf of Rome\".>>>"
