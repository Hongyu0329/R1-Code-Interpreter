    "<<<Yes, if a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a Schwartz class function such that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$, it does follow that $f$ is identically zero.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification for this conclusion, primarily using the properties of the Fourier transform on the Schwartz space.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Schwartz Space ($\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$)**: This is the space of all infinitely differentiable functions ($C^\\infty$) that, along with all their derivatives, decrease faster than any inverse power of $|x|$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. A function $f$ is in the Schwartz space if for any non-negative integers $p$ and $q$, the quantity $\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |x^p f^{(q)}(x)|$ is finite.\n2.  **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform is a mathematical transform that decomposes a function into its constituent frequencies. For a function $f \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is defined as:\n    $$\n    \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx\n    $$\n    A crucial property is that the Fourier transform is an automorphism on the Schwartz space, meaning it maps $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ to itself and is invertible.\n\n### The Proof\n\nThe proof proceeds by showing that if all moments of $f$ are zero, then its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ must be the zero function. Since the Fourier transform is injective on the Schwartz space, this implies that $f$ itself must be zero.\n\n**Step 1: Relate the Moments of *f* to the Derivatives of its Fourier Transform**\n\nThe derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ can be calculated by differentiating under the integral sign (which is permissible for Schwartz functions):\n$$\n\\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} (e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) \\, dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx\n$$\nIf we evaluate these derivatives at the point $\\xi = 0$, the exponential term becomes $e^0 = 1$:\n$$\n\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\, dx\n$$\nThis equation establishes a direct link between the $k$-th moment of the function $f$ and the $k$-th derivative of its Fourier transform at the origin.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Given Condition**\n\nThe problem states that all moments of $f$ are zero:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in \\mathbb{N}\n$$\n(Note: The argument holds whether $\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$ or $\\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$. This will be addressed below, but for the main proof, we assume $k \\ge 0$.)\n\nUsing the result from Step 1, this condition implies that all derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ at $\\xi = 0$ are zero:\n$$\n\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Show that the Fourier Transform is Identically Zero**\n\nSince $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function, it is infinitely differentiable. We can write its Taylor series expansion around $\\xi = 0$:\n$$\nT(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k\n$$\nFrom Step 2, all the coefficients $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)$ are zero, so the Taylor series is identically zero.\n\nA more direct way to show $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$ is to expand the exponential in the definition of the Fourier transform:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-2\\pi i x \\xi)^k}{k!} \\right) dx\n$$\nFor a Schwartz function $f$, we can interchange the integral and the summation (due to dominated convergence). This yields:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-2\\pi i \\xi)^k}{k!} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\, dx \\right)\n$$\nGiven that each integral (each moment) is zero, we get:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-2\\pi i \\xi)^k}{k!} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is identically zero for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude that *f* is Zero**\n\nThe Fourier transform is an isomorphism from the Schwartz space onto itself, which means it is a one-to-one mapping. This injectivity implies that if the Fourier transforms of two functions are equal, the functions themselves must be equal.\n\nSince $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$, and the Fourier transform of the zero function is the zero function, it must be that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$.\n\n### A Note on the Range of *k*\n\nThe problem specifies $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Typically, $\\mathbb{N}$ means positive integers $\\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$, which excludes the 0-th moment. However, the result still holds.\n\nIf we assume $\\int x^k f = 0$ only for $k \\ge 1$, the argument from Step 3 shows:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int f(x) \\, dx + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 0 = \\text{constant}\n$$\nSo, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must be a constant function. But since $f$ is a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ must also be a Schwartz function. The only constant function that satisfies the decay property of a Schwartz function (i.e., $\\lim_{|\\xi|\\to\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$) is the constant function $0$.\n\nThus, $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$, which again implies $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the condition that the 0-th moment is zero is a consequence of the function being in the Schwartz space and all higher moments being zero."
