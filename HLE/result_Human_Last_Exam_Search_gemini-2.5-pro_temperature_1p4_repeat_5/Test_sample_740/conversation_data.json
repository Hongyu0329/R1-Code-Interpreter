    "The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. A solution `u(x)` exists for all values of `λ` except for those for which the homogeneous version of the equation has a non-trivial solution. These specific values of `λ` are known as the characteristic values of the integral operator.\n\nThe integral equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y) dy`\n\nThe kernel of the integral equation, `K(x,y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. It can be expressed as a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and `y`:\n`K(x, y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k y^{n-1-k}`\n\nDue to this, the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. The problem can be transformed into a system of `n` linear algebraic equations. The values of `λ` for which no solution exists are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of a specific `n x n` matrix.\n\n### Derivation\nLet's look for the characteristic values `λ` by considering the homogeneous equation:\n`u(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(x,y) u(y) dy`\n\nAny non-trivial solution `u(x)` to this equation is called an eigenfunction. Substituting the separable kernel, we get:\n`u(x) = λ ∫₀¹ (∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k y^{n-1-k}) u(y) dy = λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k ∫₀¹ y^{n-1-k} u(y) dy`\n\nThis shows that the eigenfunction `u(x)` is a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. Let `u(x) = ∑_{m=0}^{n-1} a_m x^m`. Equating the coefficients of `x^j` on both sides leads to the following system of linear equations for the coefficients `a_j`:\n`a_j = λ ∑_{m=0}^{n-1} (1 / (n + m - j)) a_m`, for `j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`\n\nThis can be written in matrix form as `a = λ B a`, or `(1/λ)a = B a`, where `a = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]^T` and `B` is an `n x n` matrix with entries `B_{jm} = 1/(n + m - j)`. Thus, the reciprocals of the characteristic values `λ` are the eigenvalues of the matrix `B`.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, if `λ` is a characteristic value, the inhomogeneous equation `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫ K(x,y)u(y)dy` has a solution if and only if the right-hand side, `f(x)=1`, is orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction `u(x)`. That is, `∫₀¹ 1 * u(x) dx = 0`. If this condition is not met, no solution exists.\n\nLet's check the orthogonality condition:\n`∫₀¹ u(x) dx = ∫₀¹ (∑_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j x^j) dx = ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j / (j+1)`.\n\nIt can be shown that for any non-trivial eigenfunction `u(x)` of this specific operator, the integral `∫₀¹ u(x) dx` is non-zero. This means the orthogonality condition is never satisfied for any of the characteristic values.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solution for any value of `λ` that is a characteristic value of the integral operator.\n\n### Specific Cases\n\n*   **For n=1:** The kernel is `K(x,y) = 1`. The equation becomes `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`. This leads to the condition `λ = 1`. For this value, no solution exists.\n\n*   **For n=2:** The kernel is `K(x,y) = x+y`. The system of equations for the characteristic values of `λ` leads to the quadratic equation `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`. The values of `λ` for which no solution exists are the roots of this equation:\n    `λ = -6 ± 4√3`\n\n### General Solution\nFor a general integer `n`, the equation has no solution for values of `λ` that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `B` defined by `B_{jm} = 1/(n + m - j)`, where `j, m = 0, 1, ..., n-1`. Finding a simple closed-form expression for these eigenvalues for an arbitrary `n` is a complex problem. Therefore, the values are generally described as the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the operator, which is `det(I - λB) = 0`.\n\n<<<The values of `λ` for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `B` with elements `B_{jm} = 1/(n+m-j)` for `j,m = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.>>>"
