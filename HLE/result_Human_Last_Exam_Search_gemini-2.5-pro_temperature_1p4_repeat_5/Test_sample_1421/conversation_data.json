    "In the imaginary time representation, the fermionic partition function, denoted by Z, is formulated using Feynman's path integral formalism by employing anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. This is necessary to correctly account for the anti-symmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions as dictated by the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nThe partition function in quantum statistical mechanics is defined as the trace of the thermal operator:\n\nZ = Tr(e⁻ᵝᴴ)\n\nwhere:\n*   **H** is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   **β** is the inverse temperature, given by β = 1/kₐT, where kₐ is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\n\nTo express this in the path integral formalism, one performs a Wick rotation to imaginary time (τ = it). The partition function is then represented as a functional integral over all possible field configurations. For fermions, these fields are represented by Grassmann variables.\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is:\n\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] e⁻ˢᵉ[ψ̄,ψ]**\n\nThe components of this formula are as follows:\n\n*   **ψ(x, τ)** and **ψ̄(x, τ)**: These are the fermionic fields, which are independent Grassmann-valued functions of imaginary time τ and position x. ψ̄ is the conjugate field.\n\n*   **D[ψ̄] D[ψ]**: This represents the functional integration measure over all possible configurations of the Grassmann fields ψ and ψ̄.\n\n*   **Sₑ[ψ̄, ψ]**: This is the Euclidean action of the system. For a typical fermionic system described by a Hamiltonian H, the Euclidean action is given by:\n\n    **Sₑ[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̄(x, τ) (∂/∂τ + H) ψ(x, τ)**\n\n    Here, ∂/∂τ is the partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.\n\nA crucial aspect of the fermionic path integral is the boundary condition imposed on the fields in the imaginary time direction. Due to the trace in the definition of the partition function, the fermionic fields must satisfy **anti-periodic boundary conditions**:\n\n**ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β)**\n**ψ̄(x, 0) = -ψ̄(x, β)**\n\nFor a non-interacting system where the Hamiltonian is quadratic in the fields, the Gaussian integral over the Grassmann variables can be performed exactly. In this case, the partition function evaluates to the determinant of the operator in the action:\n\n**Z = det(∂/∂τ + H)**\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] e⁻ˢᵉ[ψ̄,ψ], where the integral is over all anti-periodic Grassmann fields ψ(x,τ) and ψ̄(x,τ). The Euclidean action Sₑ is defined as Sₑ[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̄(x, τ) (∂/∂τ + H) ψ(x, τ). For non-interacting systems, this evaluates to Z = det(∂/∂τ + H).>>>"
