The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] e⁻ˢᵉ[ψ̄,ψ], where the integral is over all anti-periodic Grassmann fields ψ(x,τ) and ψ̄(x,τ). The Euclidean action Sₑ is defined as Sₑ[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̄(x, τ) (∂/∂τ + H) ψ(x, τ). For non-interacting systems, this evaluates to Z = det(∂/∂τ + H).
