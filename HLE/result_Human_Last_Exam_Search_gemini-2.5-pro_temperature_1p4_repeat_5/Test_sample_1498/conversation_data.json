    "In the renowned poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned in a series of verses that begin with the bayt (verse) detailing the first Prophet, Adam, and conclude with the bayt mentioning the final Prophet, Muhammad.\n\nThe enumeration of the Prophets starts from the bayt:\n**هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ * صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ**\n(Translation: They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each to be followed).\n\nAnd it concludes with the bayt:\n**إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتَمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا**\n(Translation: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [a name for Prophet Muhammad], the final one, leave falsehood).\n\nTherefore, the mention of the Prophets spans these four consecutive verses, listing twenty-five Prophets by name.\n\n<<<In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets are mentioned from the bayt starting \"هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ\" to the bayt ending \"عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتَمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\".>>>"
