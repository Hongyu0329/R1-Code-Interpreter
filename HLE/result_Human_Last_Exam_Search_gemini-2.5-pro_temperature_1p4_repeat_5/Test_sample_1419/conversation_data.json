    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions (specifically in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions), the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, is directly proportional to ϵ.\n\nThe location of this fixed point is determined by finding the zeros of the renormalization group beta-function, β(g), which describes how the coupling constant `g` changes with the energy scale. To leading order in both the coupling `g` and ϵ, the beta function for an O(N)-symmetric scalar field theory is given by:\n\nβ(g) = -ϵg + B * g²\n\nHere:\n*   **-ϵg** is the contribution from the engineering dimension of the coupling constant in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions.\n*   **B * g²** represents the leading quantum correction, which comes from one-loop Feynman diagrams.\n\nSetting the beta function to zero, β(g\\*) = 0, yields two possible solutions:\n1.  **g\\* = 0**: This is the trivial Gaussian fixed point.\n2.  **g\\* = ϵ / B**: This is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nThe constant `B` depends on the normalization conventions for the coupling constant and the number of scalar field components (N). For the O(N)-symmetric ϕ⁴ theory, a common convention for the dimensionless coupling constant `g` gives the beta function:\n\nβ(g) = -ϵg + (N+8)/(16π²) * g²\n\nSolving for the non-trivial fixed point `g*` gives the leading order expression:\n\n**g\\* = (16π² / (N+8)) * ϵ**\n\nFor the simplest case of a single-component scalar field (N=1), the expression becomes:\n\n**g\\* = (16π² / 9) * ϵ**\n\nThis result is fundamental to the ϵ-expansion, which uses this fixed point to calculate critical exponents for phase transitions in physical systems, such as the Ising model in three dimensions (where ϵ=1).\n\n<<<g* = (16π² / (N+8)) * ϵ>>>"
