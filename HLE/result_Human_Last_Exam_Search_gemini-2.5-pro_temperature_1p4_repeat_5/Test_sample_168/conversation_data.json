    "While several animals possess extraordinary hearing, the herring stands out due to its specialized auditory system that makes it exceptionally sensitive to a wide range of sound frequencies, including very low ones.\n\nA muscle twitch, also known as fasciculation, is a minor, involuntary muscle contraction. The sound created by these twitches is typically of a very low frequency.\n\nHerring have a unique anatomical feature connecting their swim bladder to their inner ear, which significantly enhances their hearing ability across a broad spectrum of frequencies. This adaptation allows them to detect frequencies from as low as 5 Hz up to at least 4 kHz. Their best sensitivity is in the lower frequency ranges, between 30 and 1200 Hz. This range overlaps with the low-frequency sounds produced by muscle movements.\n\nWhile other animals on the list have keen hearing, they are not as well-equipped for this specific task:\n*   **Dogs:** A dog's hearing is excellent but is generally sharpest at higher frequencies, starting around 67 Hz, likely missing the lowest frequency muscle sounds.\n*   **Bats:** Bats are masters of high-frequency echolocation and would not be able to detect the low-frequency sounds of muscle twitches.\n*   **Whales:** While some whales are sensitive to low frequencies, the herring's specific anatomy gives it a particular advantage in detecting faint sounds in its immediate aquatic environment.\n*   **Humans:** Humans are generally unable to hear their own muscle twitches.\n\nIn addition to hearing, many fish, including herring, possess a lateral line system and electroreceptors. The lateral line detects low-frequency vibrations and water movement, acting as a form of \"distant touch.\" Furthermore, some fish have electroreceptors sensitive enough to detect the weak electrical potentials generated by the muscle contractions of nearby animals. This combination of sensory abilities makes the herring a prime candidate for detecting the subtle sounds and pressure changes associated with muscle twitches.\n\n<<<C>>>"
