    "The man Kurt Vonnegut described as looking like a porcupine in all his pictures is the philosopher Bertrand Russell. Vonnegut made this observation in his collection of essays, \"Fates Worse Than Death.\"\n\nHowever, the name \"Bertrand Russell\" does not consist of two words that start with the same letter. While Vonnegut made the \"porcupine\" comment about Bertrand Russell, there is no indication he ever referred to a person by an alliterative name with this description. The question combines a factual quote with a conflicting constraint.\n\n<<<Bertrand Russell>>>"
