    "The number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve defined by `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)` can be determined by a known formula, especially when `a` and `b` are integers.\n\nFor the given curve, `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we have `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n\nA formula for the number of self-intersection points when `a` and `b` are both odd and coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1) is `(a-1)(b-1)/2`. In this case, `a = 9` and `b = 5` are both odd, and `gcd(9, 5) = 1`.\n\nApplying the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = `(9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2`\n= `8 * 4 / 2`\n= `32 / 2`\n= 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
