The ideal Ni/Ce ratio varies significantly depending on the specific application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of 1 is suggested for maximizing conversion, while a lower ratio of 2.5 atomic % is ideal for suppressing methanation. For water splitting, a 1:1 molar ratio of Ni:Ce is optimal for electrocatalysis, whereas a 2 wt.% Ni loading is effective for thermochemical cycles.
