    "Determining the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is a complex task as the optimal ratio is highly dependent on the specific reaction, the catalyst synthesis method, and the desired catalytic properties such as activity, selectivity, and stability. Research indicates different optimal ratios for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and for water splitting processes.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is influenced by the goal of either maximizing CO conversion or suppressing the undesirable side-reaction of methanation.\n\nA study focusing on Ni/CeO2 nanorod catalysts found that the best catalytic performance for the WGS reaction was achieved with a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of 1. Other research investigating nickel loadings from 5 to 12.5 wt% on CeO2 showed that catalysts with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni exhibited the highest CO conversion at high gas hourly space velocities. In contrast, for the related reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reaction, an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar has been identified.\n\nHowever, when the objective is to prevent methane formation, a lower Ni content is preferable. Studies have demonstrated that atomically dispersing a small amount of nickel into the ceria lattice is highly effective. A catalyst with 2.5 atomic % Ni (approximately 1 wt%) relative to Ce was shown to be highly active for the WGS reaction, reaching near-equilibrium CO conversion at 350Â°C while completely suppressing methanation. Increasing the nickel content to 10 atomic % resulted in increased methane production. Similarly, another study suggested that a 2 wt% Ni/CeO2 catalyst was most promising for methanation, implying that lower concentrations are better for avoiding it. The addition of a small amount of nickel, around 2 wt.% or 5 atomic %, has also been shown to significantly enhance the WGS activity of ceria.\n\n**In summary, for the WGS reaction:**\n*   To maximize CO conversion, a higher Ni loading, potentially reaching a **Ni/Ce atomic ratio of 1**, appears to be optimal.\n*   To suppress methanation while maintaining high activity, a much lower loading of **2.5 atomic % Ni** is ideal.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nThe ideal Ni/Ce ratio for water splitting depends on the specific method used, such as thermochemical cycles or electrocatalysis.\n\nIn the context of **electrocatalytic water splitting**, a higher nickel content seems to be beneficial. For instance, a Ni3N-CeO2 heterostructure developed for overall water splitting showed the best performance for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) when the precursor solution had a **Ni:Ce molar ratio of 1:1**. Similarly, a hybrid catalyst of NiFe2O4 decorated with CeO2 nanoparticles, designed for overall water splitting, was found to have a **Ni:Fe:Ce molar ratio of 1:1:1** in its optimal composition.\n\nFor **thermochemical water splitting**, which involves high-temperature redox cycles, the requirements can be different. In a study on CO2 splitting, a related reaction that utilizes similar thermochemical principles, the highest activity was obtained with a catalyst of **2 wt.% Ni** on CeO2 nanorods. Another study on the HI decomposition step of a thermochemical cycle used Ni/CeO2-based catalysts, but did not specifically optimize the Ni/Ce ratio.\n\n**In summary, for water splitting:**\n*   For **electrocatalytic** water splitting, an optimal **Ni/Ce molar ratio of 1:1** has been reported to maximize performance.\n*   For **thermochemical** cycles, a lower loading of **2 wt.% Ni** has shown high efficiency for the related CO2 splitting reaction.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio varies significantly depending on the specific application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of 1 is suggested for maximizing conversion, while a lower ratio of 2.5 atomic % is ideal for suppressing methanation. For water splitting, a 1:1 molar ratio of Ni:Ce is optimal for electrocatalysis, whereas a 2 wt.% Ni loading is effective for thermochemical cycles.>>>"
