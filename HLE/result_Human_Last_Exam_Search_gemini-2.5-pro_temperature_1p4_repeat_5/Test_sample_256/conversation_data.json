    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1.\n\nA comprehensive database of the best-known packings of equal circles in a circle, maintained by Eckard Specht, provides information on the symmetry of these packings using Schoenflies notation. For a packing of 1135 circles, the entry in the symmetry group column is blank. According to the legend of the table, if the symmetry group field is empty, the packing has the symmetry element C_1.\n\nThe C_1 point group, in Schoenflies notation, represents the lowest possible symmetry, containing only the identity operation. This indicates that the arrangement of the 1135 circles lacks any rotational or reflectional symmetry.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
