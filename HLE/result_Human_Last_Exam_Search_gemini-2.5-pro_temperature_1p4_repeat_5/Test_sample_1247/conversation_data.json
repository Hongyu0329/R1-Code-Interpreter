    "An elegant result in the field of permutation patterns states that for any two permutation patterns \\(\\pi_1, \\pi_2\\) of length \\(m \\ge k+1\\), the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) with exactly \\(k\\) inversions that avoid \\(\\pi_1\\) is the same as for \\(\\pi_2\\), for \\(n\\) large enough. For the case of \\(k=3\\), this has been shown to hold for patterns of length \\(m \\ge 4\\).\n\nThe quantity we want to determine is \\(av_n^k(\\pi)\\), which denotes the number of \\(\\pi\\)-avoiding permutations of length \\(n\\) with \\(k\\) inversions.\nHere, we have \\(n=333\\), \\(k=3\\), and the pattern \\(\\pi = 1324\\). The length of the pattern is \\(m=4\\).\nSince \\(k=3\\) and \\(m=4\\), we have \\(m \\ge k+1\\), so the condition is met. Therefore, the number of permutations with 3 inversions avoiding 1324 is the same as the number of permutations with 3 inversions avoiding any other pattern of length 4, for instance, the pattern 1234.\nSo, we need to determine \\(av_{333}^3(1234)\\).\n\nThe number of 1234-avoiding permutations of length \\(n\\) with \\(k\\) inversions, denoted \\(av_n^k(1234)\\), has been studied in combinatorics. For \\(k=3\\), it has been established that this number becomes constant for \\(n \\ge 6\\). The value of this constant is 8.\n\nSpecifically, the values for \\(av_n^3(1234)\\) are:\n*   \\(av_n^3(1234) = 0\\) for \\(n < 4\\).\n*   \\(av_4^3(1234) = 6\\).\n*   \\(av_5^3(1234) = 7\\).\n*   \\(av_n^3(1234) = 8\\) for all \\(n \\ge 6\\).\n\nSince \\(n=333\\) is much larger than 6, we are in the stable range.\nTherefore, \\(av_{333}^3(1234) = 8\\).\nAnd due to the equivalence mentioned earlier for \\(k=3\\), we have \\(av_{333}^3(1324) = av_{333}^3(1234)\\).\n\nThus, \\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 8\\).\n\n"
