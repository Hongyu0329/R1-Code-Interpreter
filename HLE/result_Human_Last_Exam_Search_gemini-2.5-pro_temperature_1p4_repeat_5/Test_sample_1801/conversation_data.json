    "The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline \"Ask Why\" were physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** and economist **Paul Krugman**.\n\nThe advertising campaign, which preceded Enron's massive corporate scandal, has been widely scrutinized. One of the commercials featured Murray Gell-Mann, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles. Another prominent figure who appeared in the campaign was Paul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
