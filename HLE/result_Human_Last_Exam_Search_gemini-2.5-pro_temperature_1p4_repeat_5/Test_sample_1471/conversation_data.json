    "To solve the equation VIII / XXX - MMMDCCLXXXVIII, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern Arabic numerals.\n\n*   **VIII** is equivalent to 8 (V=5, I=1, so 5+1+1+1=8).\n*   **XXX** is equivalent to 30 (X=10, so 10+10+10=30).\n*   **MMMDCCLXXXVIII** represents 3788 (M=1000, D=500, C=100, L=50, X=10, V=5, I=1; so 3000+700+80+8=3788).\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation:\n\n8 / 30 - 3788\n\nNext, perform the calculation:\n\n1.  Divide 8 by 30, which equals approximately 0.2666...\n2.  Subtract 3788 from this result: 0.2666... - 3788 = -3787.7333...\n\nFor a more precise answer, the calculation can be done with fractions:\n\n8/30 simplifies to 4/15.\nThe equation is 4/15 - 3788.\nThis is equal to 4/15 - 56820/15, which results in -56816/15.\n\nAs a decimal, the solution is a repeating number.\n\n<<<-3787.7333...>>>"
