    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **The Object:** The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **The Orientation:** The icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the 20 triangular faces is horizontal and acts as the base.\n3.  **The Condition:** The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n4.  **The Goal:** Determine the shape of the water surface. The surface of a liquid at rest in a container is a horizontal plane. Therefore, we need to find the shape of the horizontal cross-section that divides the icosahedron into two equal volumes.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Symmetry of the Icosahedron:** A regular icosahedron is a highly symmetric Platonic solid. It has a center of symmetry, meaning for any point on the icosahedron, there is an identical point on the opposite side of the center.\n*   **Orientation and Parallel Faces:** Because of its symmetry, when an icosahedron rests on one face, there is another face on the opposite side that is perfectly parallel to the base. This will be the \"top\" face.\n*   **Half-Filled Implication:** The condition that the tank is half-filled is crucial. Due to the central symmetry of the icosahedron, the plane that bisects its volume must pass through its geometric center.\n*   **Vertices of the Icosahedron:** A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices. Understanding their arrangement relative to the base is key.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the location of the water surface.**\n*   The water surface will be a flat, horizontal plane.\n*   A regular icosahedron has a center of symmetry. Any plane passing through this center divides the icosahedron into two identical halves, and thus two halves of equal volume.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the exact center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the icosahedron in its given orientation.**\n*   The icosahedron is standing on a horizontal triangular face (the base). This means 3 of its 12 vertices lie on the base plane.\n*   As noted, there is a parallel triangular face at the top. This accounts for another 3 vertices.\n*   The remaining 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 vertices are located between the top and bottom faces.\n*   The horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron lies exactly halfway between the base and the top face. This central plane will contain these 6 intermediate vertices.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the shape of the cross-section.**\n*   The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by this central horizontal plane.\n*   Since the plane passes through the 6 intermediate vertices, these 6 vertices form the vertices of the cross-sectional shape.\n*   The edges of the icosahedron connecting these 6 vertices in a ring around the \"equator\" of the shape also lie within this central plane.\n*   Therefore, the boundary of the water surface is a polygon with 6 vertices and 6 sides. This shape is a hexagon.\n\n**Step 4: Determine if the hexagon is regular.**\n*   **Equal Sides:** All edges of a regular icosahedron have the same length. Since the sides of the hexagon are edges of the icosahedron, all sides of the hexagon are equal in length.\n*   **Equal Angles:** All 12 vertices of a regular icosahedron are equidistant from its center. Since the 6 vertices of the hexagon lie in the central plane, they are all equidistant from the center of the hexagon (which is the center of the icosahedron). A hexagon with equal sides whose vertices all lie on a single circle is a regular hexagon. The high degree of symmetry of the icosahedron (specifically, a 3-fold rotational symmetry axis perpendicular to the base) also guarantees that the hexagon is regular.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhen the icosahedron tank standing on a face is half-filled, the water surface is the horizontal cross-section passing through the center. This cross-section is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
