    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Question**\n\nThe prompt asks for the answer to a question posed by the title of a haiku. The final answer must be presented in alphabetical order.\n\n*   **The Title as a Question:** The title is \"The Bays\". This is a homophone (a word that sounds the same as another but has a different meaning) for \"The B's\". Therefore, the question being asked is, \"What are the B's?\". The plural form \"B's\" implies there is more than one answer to be found.\n*   **The Source of Clues:** The haiku itself provides the clues to find these \"B\" words. Each of the three lines of the haiku will reveal one \"B\" word.\n*   **The Final Instruction:** The final answer must be the list of these \"B\" words, sorted alphabetically.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Line of the Haiku**\n\nWe will examine each line to decipher the \"B\" word it represents.\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   A \"tempest\" is a violent, windy storm.\n    *   A common, simple word for a strong gust of wind or a localized storm, starting with the letter 'B', is **Blow**.\n    *   This interpretation fits the description of a tempest.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is a simple calculation: 2 * 15 = 30.\n    *   The line explicitly mentions \"winds\". This points towards a wind-related scale, such as the Beaufort scale of wind force.\n    *   On the Beaufort scale, a wind speed of 25–31 miles per hour (which includes the number 30) is classified as a \"Fresh Breeze\" or \"Strong Breeze\".\n    *   The \"B\" word derived from this line is **Breeze**.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   \"A divine one\" refers to a deity or a god.\n    *   The word \"yields\" means to give, produce, or provide.\n    *   So, the line describes something that a god gives. A gift or benefit bestowed by a divine entity is known as a **Boon**.\n    *   This \"B\" word fits the clue perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Consolidate and Order the Answers**\n\nWe have successfully identified three \"B\" words, one from each line of the haiku.\n\n*   From Line 1: **Blow**\n*   From Line 2: **Breeze**\n*   From Line 3: **Boon**\n\nThe final step is to arrange these words in alphabetical order as requested by the prompt.\n\n1.  **Blow** (starts with B-L)\n2.  **Boon** (starts with B-O)\n3.  **Breeze** (starts with B-R)\n\nComparing the second letter of each word (L, O, R), the correct alphabetical order is Blow, Boon, Breeze.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\nThe question is \"What are the B's?\". The answer is the set of three words derived from the haiku, presented in alphabetical order.\n\n<<<Blow, Boon, Breeze>>>"
