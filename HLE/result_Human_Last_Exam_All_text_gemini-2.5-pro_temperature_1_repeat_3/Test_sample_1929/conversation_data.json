    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the type of reaction.**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (more specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene, a key component for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This is an alkene with electron-withdrawing groups (Cl and F), making it a suitable dienophile for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a [4+2] cycloaddition, commonly known as the Diels-Alder reaction. This reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the basic structure of the product.**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction involves the 4 pi electrons of the diene and the 2 pi electrons of the dienophile.\n*   Three pi bonds are broken (two in the diene, one in the dienophile).\n*   Two new sigma (σ) bonds and one new pi (π) bond are formed.\n*   The product will be a six-membered ring containing one double bond, which is a cyclohexene derivative. The substituents from the dienophile (two Cl atoms and two F atoms) will be attached to the newly formed sp³ hybridized carbons of the ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the regiochemistry of the reaction.**\n*   Regiochemistry refers to the orientation of the reactants when they combine.\n*   The diene, 1,3-butadiene, is symmetrical.\n*   The dienophile, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, is unsymmetrical because one carbon of the double bond is attached to two chlorine atoms (CCl₂) and the other is attached to two fluorine atoms (CF₂).\n*   Because the dienophile is unsymmetrical, two different regioisomers are possible in principle. We can predict the major product using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory.**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction is typically controlled by the interaction between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile.\n*   **Diene HOMO:** In 1,3-butadiene, the HOMO has its largest orbital coefficients (electron density) on the terminal carbons (C1 and C4).\n*   **Dienophile LUMO:** In an unsymmetrical alkene, the LUMO has its largest orbital coefficient on the more electron-deficient carbon atom. We need to compare the electron-withdrawing effects of the CCl₂ and CF₂ groups. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine. Therefore, the CF₂ carbon is more electron-deficient (more δ+) than the CCl₂ carbon. This means the LUMO has a larger coefficient on the CF₂ carbon.\n*   **Prediction:** The reaction will preferentially form bonds between the atoms with the largest orbital coefficients. Therefore, a terminal carbon of butadiene (with a large HOMO coefficient) will bond to the CF₂ carbon of the dienophile (with a large LUMO coefficient). The other terminal carbon of the diene will then bond to the CCl₂ carbon.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the structure of the major product.**\n*   Let's trace the bond formation based on the FMO analysis:\n    *   C1 of butadiene attacks the CF₂ carbon of the dienophile.\n    *   C4 of butadiene attacks the CCl₂ carbon of the dienophile.\n*   This forms a six-membered ring with the following connectivity: `[-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-CCl₂-CF₂-]`.\n*   The structure is a cyclohexene ring where one of the sp³ carbons is bonded to two chlorine atoms, and the adjacent sp³ carbon is bonded to two fluorine atoms.\n\n**Step 6: Name the product using IUPAC nomenclature.**\n1.  The parent ring is **cyclohexene**.\n2.  The double bond is given the lowest possible locants, C1 and C2.\n3.  The substituents are on the other carbons of the ring. We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. In this case, the substituents will be on positions 4 and 5.\n4.  The substituents are `dichloro` and `difluoro`. Alphabetically, \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\".\n5.  According to IUPAC rules, when there is a choice in numbering, the group cited first alphabetically is given the lower locant.\n6.  Following our predicted structure `[-...-CH₂-CCl₂-CF₂-CH₂-...]`, let's assign the numbers. If the CCl₂ group is at C4 and the CF₂ group is at C5, the name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**. In this name, the alphabetically-first group (chloro) gets the lower number (4) compared to the alternative (fluoro getting 4). This is the correct IUPAC name for the predicted major product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a Diels-Alder reaction that predominantly forms a single regioisomer. Based on FMO theory, the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\nThe reaction is:\nCH₂=CH-CH=CH₂ + CCl₂=CF₂ → 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
