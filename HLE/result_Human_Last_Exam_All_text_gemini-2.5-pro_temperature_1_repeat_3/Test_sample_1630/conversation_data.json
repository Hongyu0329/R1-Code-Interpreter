    "### Step-by-step analysis of the problem\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n\n*   We are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\n*   Let's denote them as:\n    *   $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n    *   $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   We are given conditions on their derivatives: $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   The derivatives are quadratic polynomials: $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$ and $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$.\n    *   For a quadratic to be always positive, its parabola must open upwards and it must have no real roots.\n        *   This means the leading coefficient must be positive: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$ and $3b_3 > 0 \\implies b_3 > 0$.\n        *   This also means the discriminant must be negative: $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$, and similarly $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n*   The conditions $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ imply that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all $x$.\n\n**2. Define the Problem**\n\n*   We need to find the maximum number of **fixed points** of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\n*   A fixed point is a value $x$ such that $h(x) = x$.\n*   So, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Equation for Fixed Points**\n\n*   Let's analyze the function whose roots we are seeking: $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$.\n*   First, determine the degree of $H(x)$.\n    *   Since $f$ has degree 3 and $g$ has degree 3, the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ has degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    *   The term $-x$ does not change the degree. So, $H(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n*   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n**4. Check if 9 Fixed Points is Achievable**\n\n*   The question now is whether it is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $f(g(x)) = x$ has 9 distinct real solutions.\n*   Let's use Rolle's Theorem. If a differentiable function $H(x)$ has $k$ distinct real roots, then its derivative $H'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n*   If we want $H(x)$ to have 9 roots, its derivative $H'(x)$ must have at least $9-1 = 8$ roots.\n*   Let's find the derivative $H'(x)$:\n    *   $H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = h'(x) - 1$.\n    *   Using the chain rule, $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n    *   So, we need the equation $H'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1 = 0$ to have at least 8 real roots.\n\n**5. Analyze the Derivative $h'(x)$**\n\n*   Let's determine the degree of the polynomial $h'(x)$.\n    *   $f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   The composite function $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   The product $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   Since $h'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8, the equation $h'(x) - 1 = 0$ can have at most 8 real roots.\n*   Combining the results from steps 4 and 5: for $H(x)$ to have 9 roots, $H'(x)$ must have at least 8 roots. Since the degree of $H'(x)$ is 8, it must have exactly 8 distinct real roots.\n*   This means the maximum possible value of 9 is not ruled out by Rolle's Theorem. The theoretical maximum is consistent with the properties of the derivatives.\n\n**6. The Existence Argument**\n\nThe final step is to argue that such polynomials $f$ and $g$ can actually exist. This requires a more detailed analysis, but we can outline the key requirements.\n\n1.  **Requirement for $h'(x)$:** For the equation $h'(x)=1$ to have 8 distinct roots, the graph of the polynomial $h'(x)$ (which is of degree 8) must cross the horizontal line $y=1$ eight times.\n2.  **Shape of $h'(x)$:** Since $f', g' > 0$ and their leading coefficients are positive, $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is always positive and its leading coefficient is positive. This means $h'(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. For it to cross $y=1$ eight times, it must have 4 local minima and 3 local maxima.\n3.  **Extrema of $h'(x)$:** For $h'(x)$ to have 7 local extrema, its derivative, $h''(x)$, must have 7 distinct real roots.\n4.  **Analysis of $h''(x)$:** Let's find the degree of $h''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x))$.\n    $h''(x) = f''(g(x)) \\cdot (g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$.\n    *   deg($f''$) = 1, deg($g$) = 3 $\\implies$ deg($f''(g(x))$) = 3.\n    *   deg($g'$) = 2 $\\implies$ deg($(g'(x))^2$) = 4.\n    *   deg($f''(g(x)) \\cdot (g'(x))^2$) = 3 + 4 = 7.\n    *   deg($f'(g(x))$) = 6, deg($g''$) = 1.\n    *   deg($f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$) = 6 + 1 = 7.\n    The leading terms do not cancel, so the degree of $h''(x)$ is 7. A polynomial of degree 7 can have up to 7 distinct real roots.\n5.  **Putting it together:** It is possible to choose the coefficients of the polynomials $f$ and $g$ such that:\n    *   The conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ are met.\n    *   The resulting polynomial $h''(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots.\n    *   This gives $h'(x)$ four local minima and three local maxima.\n    *   By further tuning the many available coefficients of $f$ and $g$, one can ensure the four local minima of $h'(x)$ are below 1 and the three local maxima are above 1. This guarantees that $h'(x)=1$ has 8 distinct real roots.\n    *   This, in turn, creates 8 local extrema for $H(x) = f(g(x))-x$.\n    *   Finally, the constant term $a_0$ in $f(x)$ can be used to shift the entire graph of $H(x)$ vertically without changing $H'(x)$. We can shift it so that the four local maxima are positive and the four local minima are negative. This configuration guarantees that $H(x)$ crosses the x-axis 9 times.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe degree of the polynomial equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ is 9, so there can be at most 9 fixed points. The analysis using derivatives and Rolle's Theorem shows that no properties of the given functions prevent this maximum from being reached. A careful (though complicated) construction of polynomials $f$ and $g$ would allow for 9 fixed points. Therefore, the maximum number is 9.\n\n>>> 9"
