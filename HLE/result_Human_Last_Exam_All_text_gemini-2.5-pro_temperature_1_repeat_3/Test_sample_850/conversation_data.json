    "This question requires a careful analysis of the symmetry conditions for three distinct crystal properties: chirality, polarity, and optical activity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the condition \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\".**\n\n*   Optical activity is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. This physical phenomenon is known as gyrotropy.\n*   The fundamental symmetry requirement for a crystal to exhibit optical activity (gyrotropy) is that its point group must **lack a center of symmetry (inversion center, *i*)**.\n*   Crystal classes that lack a center of symmetry are called **non-centrosymmetric**.\n*   There are 32 crystal classes in total. 11 are centrosymmetric (possess an inversion center) and 21 are non-centrosymmetric.\n*   Therefore, the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" corresponds to the 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** It is a common misconception that only chiral (lacking mirror planes and an inversion center) materials can be optically active. While this is true for liquids and gases, for crystals, the less strict condition of non-centrosymmetry is sufficient. All 21 non-centrosymmetric classes are, in principle, optically active.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the condition \"achiral\".**\n\n*   A crystal class is **achiral** if its symmetry includes at least one improper rotation axis ($S_n$), which includes mirror planes ($\\sigma = S_1$) and a center of inversion ($i = S_2$).\n*   A crystal class is **chiral** if it lacks all improper rotation axes. There are 11 chiral classes (1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432).\n*   The question requires the classes to be **achiral**. This means we must exclude the 11 chiral classes.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the conditions from Step 1 and Step 2.**\n\n*   From Step 1, the class must be non-centrosymmetric.\n*   From Step 2, the class must be achiral.\n*   This means we are looking for classes that are **achiral and non-centrosymmetric**. We can find these by taking the full set of 32 classes and removing both the 11 centrosymmetric classes and the 11 chiral classes.\n*   This leaves 32 - 11 - 11 = 10 crystal classes.\n*   These 10 classes are: **m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the condition \"non-polar\".**\n\n*   A crystal is **polar** if it possesses a spontaneous electric dipole moment, which requires a unique polar axis.\n*   The point groups that allow for a polar axis are called the 10 **polar classes** (or pyroelectric classes): **1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm**.\n*   The question requires the classes to be **non-polar**, so we must exclude these 10 classes.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the result from Step 3 with the condition from Step 4.**\n\n*   We start with the list of 10 classes that are achiral and optically active (from Step 3):\n    {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m}\n*   We must now remove any of these that are also polar (from Step 4). The polar classes in this list are:\n    {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}\n*   Removing these from the list leaves the final set of crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe remaining crystal classes are those that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\nThe final list of crystal classes is:\n**-4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m**\n\n*   **-4** (Schoenflies: $S_4$)\n*   **-42m** (Schoenflies: $D_{2d}$)\n*   **-6** (Schoenflies: $C_{3h}$)\n*   **-6m2** (Schoenflies: $D_{3h}$)\n*   **-43m** (Schoenflies: $T_d$)\n\nThese five classes lack a center of inversion (allowing optical activity), contain improper rotation axes (making them achiral), and do not belong to the 10 polar classes.\n\n<<<The five crystal classes are -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m.>>>"
