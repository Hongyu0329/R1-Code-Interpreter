    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the sentence and the target word.**\nThe sentence given is: \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\nThe question asks for the part of speech of the first word, which is \"Fat\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the role of the word \"Fat\" in the sentence.**\nThe word \"Fat\" comes directly before the word \"people\". The word \"people\" is a noun, referring to human beings. In English grammar, words that are used to describe or modify nouns are called adjectives.\n\n**Step 3: Test the function of \"Fat\" with examples.**\nLet's look at the phrase \"Fat people\". The word \"Fat\" describes a characteristic of the \"people\". This is a typical structure for an adjective-noun phrase.\n*   Compare it to other similar phrases: \"tall people\", \"young people\", \"happy people\". In all these cases, \"tall\", \"young\", and \"happy\" are adjectives that describe the noun \"people\".\n*   Therefore, in the phrase \"Fat people\", the word \"Fat\" is functioning as an adjective.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the grammatical structure of the full sentence.**\nThe full sentence, \"Fat people eat accumulates,\" is grammatically incorrect. It seems to have a subject (\"Fat people\") followed by two consecutive verbs (\"eat\" and \"accumulates\"), which is not standard English sentence structure. However, the grammatical error in the later part of the sentence does not change the part of speech of the word \"Fat\" at the beginning. The relationship between \"Fat\" and \"people\" within the noun phrase \"Fat people\" is clear.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n*   A. Verb: A verb expresses an action or state of being. \"Fat\" is not an action here.\n*   B. Noun: A noun is a person, place, thing, or idea. While \"fat\" can be a noun (e.g., \"body fat\"), in this sentence it is describing the noun \"people\", not acting as a noun itself.\n*   C. Adjective: An adjective describes a noun. \"Fat\" is describing \"people\". This is the correct choice.\n*   D. Adverb: An adverb modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb. \"Fat\" is not modifying a verb here.\n*   E. Conjunction: A conjunction connects words, phrases, or clauses (e.g., and, but, or). \"Fat\" is not serving as a connector.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the word \"Fat\" is used to describe the noun \"people\". Therefore, its part of speech is an adjective.\n\n<<<C>>>"
