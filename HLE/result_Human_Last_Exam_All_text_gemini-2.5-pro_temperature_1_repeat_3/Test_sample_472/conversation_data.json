    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line:\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThe meter is a **Trochaic Septenarius**. This meter consists of seven full trochaic feet (a trochee is a long syllable followed by a short one: L S) and one final incomplete foot. The basic pattern is:\n`L S | L S | L S | L S || L S | L S | L S | x`\n(where `||` is the caesura, or pause, and `x` is an anceps syllable, which can be long or short).\n\nIn the comedies of Plautus, this meter allows for several variations (substitutions and resolutions) to create a more natural, speech-like rhythm.\n\n### Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Syllable Quantity:** First, we determine the natural length (quantity) of each syllable.\n    *   `et`: short (S)\n    *   `ti-bi`: two short syllables (S S)\n    *   `be-ne`: two short syllables (S S)\n    *   `es-se`: The first syllable `es-` is long by position (followed by two consonants, `ss`). The second, `-se`, is short. So, `L S`.\n    *   `so-li`: The `o` in `solus` is naturally long. The final `i` is short. So, `L S`.\n    *   `quom`: (an old spelling of `cum`) is long before a consonant. So, `L`.\n    *   `si-bi`: two short syllables (S S)\n    *   `sit`: The `i` is short, but the syllable is closed by `t`, making it long by position. So, `L`.\n    *   `ma-le`: two short syllables (S S)\n\n    The sequence of natural quantities is: `S S S S S L S L S L S S L S S`.\n    The line has 16 syllables. The base pattern has 15 positions (`7 * 2 + 1`). This indicates there is one **resolution**, where a single long syllable (L) is replaced by two short ones (S S).\n\n2.  **Foot-by-Foot Scansion:** We will now construct the line foot by foot, applying the rules of Plautine scansion.\n\n    *   **Foot 1: `et ti-`**\n        The first syllable `et` (S) is treated as long under the metrical beat or ictus. This is a common feature at the beginning of a line. So, the foot is `L S`.\n        `et ti-` -> **L S**\n\n    *   **Foot 2: `-bi be-ne`**\n        This foot consists of the last syllable of `tibi` and the word `bene`. The syllables are `-bi`, `be-`, and `-ne`. All three are naturally short. This forms a **tribrach** (`S S S`). A tribrach is a valid resolution of a trochee (`L S`), where the long element is resolved into two shorts (`(S S) S`).\n        `-bi be-ne` -> **S S S**\n\n    *   **Foot 3 & 4: `es-se` and `so-li`**\n        These two words are perfect trochees based on their natural quantities.\n        `es-se` -> **L S**\n        `so-li` -> **L S**\n        The main caesura (pause) of the line falls here, after the fourth foot.\n\n    *   **Foot 5: `quom si-`**\n        `quom` is long and the first syllable of `sibi` is short. This forms another perfect trochee.\n        `quom si-` -> **L S**\n\n    *   **Foot 6: `-bi sit`**\n        This foot consists of the last syllable of `sibi` and the word `sit`. The quantities are `S L`. This is an **iamb**. An iambic foot (`S L`) is a common and valid substitution for a trochaic foot (`L S`) in the even-numbered positions (2nd, 4th, 6th feet) of the line.\n        `-bi sit` -> **S L**\n\n    *   **Foot 7: `ma-le`**\n        The natural quantity of `male` is `S S` (a pyrrhic). However, to fit the meter, the final foot of the line often conforms to the required pattern through metrical stress. Here, the ictus falls on the first syllable `ma-`, making it long (`elementum longum`). The line is **acatalectic**, meaning it ends with a complete final foot and no trailing anceps syllable.\n        `ma-le` -> **L S**\n\n### Final Scansion:\n\nCombining these feet gives the complete scansion of the line:\n\n`et ti-` | `-bi be-ne` | `es-se` | `so-li` || `quom si-` | `-bi sit` | `ma-le`\nL S | S S S | L S | L S || L S | S L | L S\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L S L S S L L S>>>"
