    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical figures and context.**\nThe question asks about the Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟, known in Vietnamese as Mộc Thạnh) and his \"first major defeat\" in what is now Vietnam. This points to the period of the Lam Sơn uprising (1418–1427), led by Lê Lợi against the rule of the Ming Dynasty.\n\n**Step 2: Pinpoint Mu Sheng's specific campaigns and defeats.**\nMu Sheng was a veteran general involved in the initial Ming conquest of Vietnam. However, the question refers to a major defeat, which most prominently occurred during the final stages of the Lam Sơn war. In 1427, the Ming Emperor sent two massive relief armies to break the siege of the Ming capital, Dongguan (modern Hanoi).\n*   One army, led by Liu Sheng (Liễu Thăng), advanced from Guangxi and was annihilated in the famous Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang. This was a major Ming defeat, but not Mu Sheng's.\n*   The second army, led by Mu Sheng himself, advanced from Yunnan province.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Mu Sheng's \"first major defeat\".**\nUpon learning of Liu Sheng's catastrophic defeat, Mu Sheng's army, which had advanced into Vietnamese territory, panicked and began a hasty retreat back to Yunnan. Lê Lợi dispatched his generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả to pursue and attack Mu Sheng's forces.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the battle.**\nThe Vietnamese forces caught up with Mu Sheng's retreating army and launched a decisive attack. This engagement is known in historical records as the Battle of Lãnh Câu (冷溝) and Đan Xá (丹舍). Mu Sheng's army was routed, suffering thousands of casualties and losing significant supplies. This was his first and only major personal defeat in this final campaign, which effectively ended the Ming effort to salvage the war.\n\n**Step 5: Map the historical battle location to a modern Vietnamese province.**\nHistorical sources place the battle sites of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá in the mountainous region of Mường Lễ (or Mường Lay) along the Da River (Sông Đà). This was the strategic route connecting Yunnan to the Red River Delta. By tracing this historical location on a modern map, Mường Lễ/Mường Lay is now a town located within the present-day **Điện Biên Province** in the Northwest region of Vietnam.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is important to distinguish Mu Sheng's defeat from other major Ming defeats in the same war, such as the Battle of Tốt Động-Chúc Động (commanded by Wang Tong) and the Battle of Chi Lăng-Xương Giang (commanded by Liu Sheng).\n*   The term \"first major defeat\" refers to his command during the Lam Sơn uprising, not necessarily his entire career. The Battle of Lãnh Câu - Đan Xá was the definitive major defeat of the army he personally commanded during this conflict.\n*   Correctly mapping the historical geography (Mường Lễ, Lãnh Câu) to modern administrative units (Điện Biên Province) is crucial.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nThe battle where Ming General Mu Sheng suffered his first major defeat was the Battle of Lãnh Câu - Đan Xá. This battle took place in the historical region of Mường Lễ, which is located in the modern-day province of Điện Biên.\n\n<<<Điện Biên Province>>>"
