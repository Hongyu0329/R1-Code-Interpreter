    "An analysis of the problem is provided below, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Objective:** The main goal is to compare two strings lexicographically, treating uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent. The program must output -1, 1, or 0 based on the comparison result.\n2.  **Input:** Two strings are given as input, each on a new line. They are guaranteed to be of the same length, ranging from 1 to 100 characters, and consist only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n3.  **Core Logic (Case-Insensitive Comparison):**\n    *   The comparison must be performed character by character, from left to right (from index 0).\n    *   To handle case-insensitivity, each pair of characters (one from the first string, one from the second at the same position) must be converted to a common case (e.g., all lowercase) before they are compared. The C library function `tolower()` is ideal for this.\n    *   The comparison stops at the first position where the characters differ.\n        *   If `tolower(char1) < tolower(char2)`, the first string is smaller.\n        *   If `tolower(char1) > tolower(char2)`, the first string is larger.\n    *   If the entire strings are traversed without finding any difference, they are considered equal.\n4.  **Constraint: Memory Efficiency:** The problem explicitly asks for the *most memory-efficient* C program. This means we must minimize the total memory allocated for variables.\n5.  **Developing a Memory-Efficient Algorithm:**\n    *   A straightforward approach would use two character arrays, `char s1[101]` and `char s2[101]`, to store both strings. This would consume `101 + 101 = 202` bytes for the buffers alone.\n    *   To be more memory-efficient, we can avoid storing the second string. The input is read sequentially. We can read and store the first string completely. Then, we can read the second string one character at a time and immediately compare it with the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n    *   This \"single-buffer\" approach requires memory for only one string buffer and a few small variables for the loop and character storage.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Buffer Sizing:** In C, a string of length `L` requires a character array of size `L+1` to store the null terminator (`\\0`). For a maximum length of 100, the buffer must be `char s[101];`.\n2.  **`getchar()` Return Type:** The `getchar()` function, used for reading single characters, returns an `int`, not a `char`. This is to accommodate the special `EOF` (End-of-File) value, which might not fit in a `char`. It is crucial to use an `int` variable to store the result of `getchar()`.\n3.  **Whitespace Handling:** Reading the first string with `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` leaves the subsequent newline character (`\\n`) in the input stream. This whitespace must be consumed before starting to read the second string character by character.\n4.  **Variable Data Types:** To minimize memory, the smallest appropriate data type should be used for each variable. For a loop counter that goes up to 99, a `char` (1 byte) is sufficient and more memory-efficient than an `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n5.  **Problem Guarantees:** The guarantee that strings are of the same length simplifies the code, as we don't need to handle cases where one string is a prefix of the other. The loop can safely run for the length of the first string.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer (Memory Calculation)\n\nWe will calculate the total memory `m` used by the variables in the most memory-efficient C program.\n\n1.  **Buffer for the first string:** We need to store the first string.\n    *   Variable: `char str1[101];`\n    *   Memory: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1 byte` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Loop counter:** We need an index `i` to iterate through `str1`. The maximum value of `i` will be 99. A `char` data type is sufficient.\n    *   Variable: `char i;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Character from the second string:** We read characters from the second string one by one using `getchar()`. The variable must be an `int`.\n    *   Variable: `int char2;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes** (on standard competitive programming platforms).\n\n4.  **Total Memory (m):** The total memory is the sum of the memory used by these variables.\n    *   `m = (memory for str1) + (memory for i) + (memory for char2)`\n    *   `m = 101 + 1 + 4`\n    *   `m = 106` bytes.\n\nThis is the minimum memory required for variables to solve the problem correctly.\n\n<<<106>>>"
