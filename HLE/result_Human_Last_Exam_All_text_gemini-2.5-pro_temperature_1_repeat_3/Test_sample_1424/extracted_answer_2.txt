The bare Green's function in frequency space, $G_0(k, \omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ as an inverse relationship. Specifically, $G_0$ has a simple pole where the energy variable equals the eigenvalue. The functional form is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{\hbar}{\hbar\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta'}$, where $\eta'$ is an infinitesimal term enforcing causality. Therefore, $\epsilon_k$ directly determines the location of the pole of the bare propagator on the real energy axis.
