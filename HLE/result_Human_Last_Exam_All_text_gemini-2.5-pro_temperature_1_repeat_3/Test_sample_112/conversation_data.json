    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the correct \"Sir Launfal\"**\nThe name \"Sir Launfal\" can refer to two different works:\n1.  A 19th-century poem, \"The Vision of Sir Launfal,\" by James Russell Lowell.\n2.  A 14th-century Middle English romance by a poet named Thomas Chestre.\n\nThe phrase \"preserved alongside\" strongly implies a physical manuscript where different texts were copied and bound together. This practice was common in the medieval period but not for 19th-century printed poems. Therefore, the question is almost certainly about the medieval romance by Thomas Chestre.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the manuscript containing the medieval \"Sir Launfal\"**\nThe romance \"Sir Launfal\" by Thomas Chestre survives in only one original source. This is a famous medieval manuscript known as **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, which is now held in the British Library. This manuscript is an anthology containing many different poems and texts.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the other contents of the manuscript**\nTo find the \"book of manners\" preserved with \"Sir Launfal,\" we must look at the other texts included in the Cotton MS Caligula A.ii manuscript. This manuscript contains a collection of popular romances like *The Earl of Toulouse* and *Libeaus Desconus*.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the \"book of manners\" within the manuscript**\nA \"book of manners,\" also known as a courtesy book, was a popular genre in the Middle Ages that offered instruction on etiquette, social conduct, and morality. When we examine the full list of contents for Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, we find a text that fits this description perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Name the specific book of manners**\nAmong the romances and other poems in the manuscript is a text known as **The Boke of Curtasye** (The Book of Courtesy). This work is a classic example of a medieval book of manners, giving advice to young men on how to behave at a lord's court, especially during meals.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe medieval romance \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in the manuscript Cotton MS Caligula A.ii alongside a book of manners called *The Boke of Curtasye*.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
