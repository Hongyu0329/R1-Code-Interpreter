    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    *   The starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n    *   Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n        *   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is in turn connected to a nitrogen atom (-CONH-).\n        *   **N,N-diethyl:** The nitrogen of the amide group is bonded to two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). So, the group is -CON(C₂H₅)₂. We'll assign this to position 1 on the benzene ring.\n        *   **3-dimethylamino:** At position 3 of the benzene ring (meta to the amide group), there is a dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂.\n    *   The structure contains two functional groups on the benzene ring: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group [-CON(Et)₂] and the dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂].\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Set of Reagents and Reaction:**\n    *   **Reagents:** sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium) and TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) in THF (tetrahydrofuran).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is characteristic of a **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction.\n    *   **Function of Reagents:**\n        *   **sec-BuLi:** A very strong base used to deprotonate the most acidic proton on the substrate.\n        *   **TMEDA:** A chelating agent that coordinates to the lithium ion (Li⁺). This breaks up the aggregates of sec-BuLi, increasing its basicity, and helps to direct the deprotonation by holding the lithium ion close to a specific site on the substrate.\n    *   **Identifying the Site of Deprotonation:** In a DoM reaction, the deprotonation occurs at a position *ortho* (adjacent) to a \"directing group\". A directing group is a substituent that can coordinate to the lithium ion, typically through a heteroatom like oxygen or nitrogen.\n        *   We have two directing groups in our molecule:\n            1.  The **N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CON(Et)₂) at C1**. The carbonyl oxygen is an excellent Lewis base for coordinating with Li⁺. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions: **C2** and **C6**. This is one of the most powerful directing groups for DoM.\n            2.  The **dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) at C3**. The nitrogen atom is also a Lewis base and can direct deprotonation to its ortho positions: **C2** and **C4**.\n    *   **Determining the Regioselectivity:** We need to evaluate the combined effect of both directing groups.\n        *   The position **C2** is ortho to *both* the powerful amide director and the amine director.\n        *   The position **C4** is ortho only to the amine director.\n        *   The position **C6** is ortho only to the amide director.\n    *   The cooperative directing effect of both groups strongly favors deprotonation at the **C2** position. The proton at C2 is by far the most acidic C-H proton on the ring due to this synergistic stabilization of the resulting carbanion (aryllithium intermediate). A stable six-membered chelate ring can be envisioned involving the lithium ion, the carbonyl oxygen, the amine nitrogen, and the C2 and C3 carbons, further stabilizing the transition state for deprotonation at C2.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The reaction forms an aryllithium species where the hydrogen atom at C2 is replaced by a lithium atom.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reagent and Reaction:**\n    *   **Reagent:** Methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile (a carbanion). Methyl iodide is an electrophile. This will be a nucleophilic attack on the methyl group.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic carbon at C2 of the aryllithium intermediate attacks the electrophilic methyl carbon of CH₃I. Iodide (I⁻) is a good leaving group and is displaced in an Sₙ2-like fashion.\n    *   **Result:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C2 of the benzene ring and the methyl group.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   The starting material was N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   The reaction sequence results in the substitution of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group.\n    *   The final product is therefore **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Hierarchy of Directing Groups:** The amide group (-CONR₂) is a stronger directing group than the amine group (-NR₂). However, in this case, their effects are cooperative, reinforcing deprotonation at a single site (C2).\n*   **Role of TMEDA:** TMEDA is crucial for enhancing the reactivity of sec-BuLi and for stabilizing the lithiated intermediate, ensuring high yield and regioselectivity.\n*   **Choice of Base:** sec-BuLi is used instead of n-BuLi because it is less nucleophilic and more basic, favoring deprotonation over potential nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Electrophilic Quench:** The second step must involve an electrophile (like CH₃I) to react with the nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction is a highly regioselective directed ortho-metalation at the C2 position, guided by the cooperative effects of the amide and amine substituents, followed by methylation at that position.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
