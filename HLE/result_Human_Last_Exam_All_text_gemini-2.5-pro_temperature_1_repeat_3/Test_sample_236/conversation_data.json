    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Homology Cobordism Group**\n\nThe question concerns the homology cobordism group, denoted as $\\Theta_3^H$. This is a fundamental object in low-dimensional topology.\n*   **Elements:** The elements of $\\Theta_3^H$ are equivalence classes of oriented integral homology 3-spheres. An integral homology 3-sphere is a 3-manifold $M$ whose integer homology groups are the same as those of the 3-sphere $S^3$, i.e., $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n*   **Equivalence Relation:** Two homology spheres $M_1$ and $M_2$ are homology cobordant if there exists a compact, oriented 4-manifold $W$ such that its boundary $\\partial W$ is the disjoint union of $M_1$ and $-M_2$ (where $-M_2$ denotes $M_2$ with the opposite orientation), and the homology of $W$ is the same as that of a cylinder, i.e., the inclusions $M_1 \\hookrightarrow W$ and $M_2 \\hookrightarrow W$ induce isomorphisms on all homology groups.\n*   **Group Structure:** The group operation is the connected sum (#). The identity element is the class of the 3-sphere, $[S^3]$.\n*   **Key Theorem:** A major result in the field, established through the work of Rohlin, Casson, Freedman, and others, is that $\\Theta_3^H$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, i.e., $\\Theta_3^H \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   **Conclusion:** This means there are exactly **two** elements in the homology cobordism group:\n    1.  The **trivial element**, represented by $S^3$ and any homology sphere that bounds a homology 4-ball.\n    2.  The **non-trivial element**, represented by any homology sphere that does not bound a homology 4-ball (e.g., the Poincaré homology sphere).\n\nThe question is, how many of these two elements can be created using the specified construction?\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Construction Method**\n\nThe manifolds must be constructed by \"an integral surgery on a knot\".\n*   **Dehn Surgery:** This process involves removing a tubular neighborhood of a knot $K$ in $S^3$ and gluing it back differently. The new gluing is determined by a framing, a rational number $p/q$.\n*   **Integral Surgery:** This specifies that the framing must be an integer, meaning $q=1$. So we are considering surgery with an integer coefficient $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ on a knot $K$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_p(K)$.\n*   **Resulting in a Homology Sphere:** For $S^3_p(K)$ to be an integral homology sphere, its first homology group must be trivial. The first homology group of the surgered manifold is given by $H_1(S^3_p(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{|p|}$. For this group to be trivial, we must have $|p|=1$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The construction is limited to performing **+1 or -1 surgery** on knots.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Knots to be Used**\n\nThe problem restricts the knots to those \"with at most four crossings\". We must list all such distinct knots.\n*   **0 crossings:** The unknot, $0_1$.\n*   **1 and 2 crossings:** There are no knots with 1 or 2 crossings.\n*   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot, $3_1$. This knot is chiral, meaning it is different from its mirror image. So we have the right-handed trefoil ($+3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$).\n*   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\nSo, the list of knots we need to examine is: $0_1$, $3_1$ (both chiralities), and $4_1$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Homology Cobordism Class of the Resulting Manifolds**\n\nWe need to find the class of $S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)$ for each knot $K$ on our list. The class is determined by the Rohlin invariant, $\\mu$, which is 0 for the trivial class and non-zero for the non-trivial class. The Rohlin invariant is related to the Casson invariant $\\lambda$ by $\\lambda(M) \\equiv \\mu(M)/8 \\pmod 2$. A key formula relates the Casson invariant to the Alexander polynomial $\\Delta_K(t)$ of the knot:\n$\\lambda(S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)) = \\mp \\frac{\\Delta_K''(-1)}{2}$\nwhere $\\Delta_K''(-1)$ is the second derivative of the symmetrized Alexander polynomial evaluated at $t=-1$.\nThe class is trivial if $\\lambda \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ and non-trivial if $\\lambda \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\n*   **Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   The Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta_{0_1}(t) = 1$.\n    *   The second derivative is $\\Delta_{0_1}''(t) = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\lambda(S^3_{\\pm 1}(0_1)) = 0$. This represents the **trivial element**.\n    *   This is expected, as $\\pm 1$ surgery on the unknot yields $S^3$, the identity element of the group.\n\n*   **Trefoil Knot ($3_1$)**:\n    *   The symmetrized Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta_{3_1}(t) = t - 1 + t^{-1}$. (This is the same for both right- and left-handed trefoils).\n    *   $\\Delta'(t) = 1 - t^{-2}$, and $\\Delta''(t) = 2t^{-3}$.\n    *   Evaluating at $t=-1$, we get $\\Delta_{3_1}''(-1) = 2(-1)^{-3} = -2$.\n    *   For $+1$ surgery: $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(3_1)) = - \\frac{-2}{2} = 1$. Since $1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, this represents the **non-trivial element**. (This manifold is the famous Poincaré homology sphere).\n    *   For $-1$ surgery: $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(3_1)) = + \\frac{-2}{2} = -1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. This also represents the **non-trivial element**.\n\n*   **Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**:\n    *   The symmetrized Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = -t + 3 - t^{-1}$.\n    *   $\\Delta'(t) = -1 + t^{-2}$, and $\\Delta''(t) = -2t^{-3}$.\n    *   Evaluating at $t=-1$, we get $\\Delta_{4_1}''(-1) = -2(-1)^{-3} = 2$.\n    *   For $+1$ surgery: $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(4_1)) = - \\frac{2}{2} = -1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. This represents the **non-trivial element**.\n    *   For $-1$ surgery: $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(4_1)) = + \\frac{2}{2} = 1$. This also represents the **non-trivial element**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have analyzed the possible outcomes from the specified construction.\n*   Surgery on the unknot ($0_1$) can produce the **trivial element** of $\\Theta_3^H$.\n*   Surgery on the trefoil knot ($3_1$) or the figure-eight knot ($4_1$) can produce the **non-trivial element** of $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\nSince we are able to construct representatives for both the trivial and the non-trivial elements, we can represent all elements of the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_3^H$. As there are only two such elements, the number of representable elements is 2."
