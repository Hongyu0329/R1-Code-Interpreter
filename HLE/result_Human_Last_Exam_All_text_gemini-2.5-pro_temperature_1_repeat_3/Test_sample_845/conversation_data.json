    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   **Measurement Method:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **Key Information:** HRV is computed from a \"value between heartbeats\".\n    *   **The Question:** What is the specific name for this \"value between heartbeats\"?\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   **HR vs. HRV:** It is crucial to distinguish between Heart Rate (the average number of beats in a minute) and Heart Rate Variability (the variation in time *between* each heartbeat). The question is about the fundamental measurement used for HRV.\n    *   **Measurement Technology (PPG vs. ECG):** The question specifies PPG. The gold standard for measuring heart activity is the Electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical signals of the heart. In ECG, the prominent spike is the \"R-wave,\" and the time between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R interval**. PPG, on the other hand, measures changes in blood volume in the tissue (the pulse). While the underlying physiological event is the same (a heartbeat), the measurement points are different.\n    *   **Terminology:** The value being discussed is a measure of time, specifically the time elapsed between two consecutive heartbeats (or pulse waves in the case of PPG).\n    *   **Relationship between PPG and ECG measurements:** The time between pulses measured by PPG is a very close approximation of the R-R interval measured by ECG. Therefore, the terminology is sometimes used interchangeably, but there are specific terms.\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the name of the time interval between consecutive heartbeats.\n    *   This interval is the fundamental data point from which all time-domain HRV metrics (like SDNN, RMSSD, etc.) are calculated.\n    *   The most general and widely accepted term for this beat-to-beat time interval is the **Inter-beat Interval**, often abbreviated as **IBI**.\n    *   When measured specifically by an ECG, it is called an R-R interval.\n    *   When measured specifically by PPG, it is sometimes called a Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI).\n    *   However, \"Inter-beat Interval\" (IBI) is the most common and universally understood term that accurately describes the value, especially in the context of consumer wearables and general HRV literature that encompasses both ECG and PPG methods.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe value computed as the time duration between consecutive heartbeats, used as the basis for calculating Heart Rate Variability (HRV), is called the Inter-beat Interval (IBI).\n\n<<<Inter-beat Interval>>>"
