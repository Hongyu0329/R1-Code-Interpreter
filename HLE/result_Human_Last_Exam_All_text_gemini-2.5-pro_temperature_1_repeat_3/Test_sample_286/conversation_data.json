    "Answering this question involves several steps of analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the problem and reformulating it**\n\nLet $N = 100000$. We are given a sequence of real numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_N \\in [0,1]$.\nWe need to find a sequence of real numbers $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_N$ such that:\n1.  All $x_i$ belong to the interval $I_M = [-1+10^{-M}, 1-10^{-M}]$. Let's denote $B = 1-10^{-M}$, so the interval is $[-B, B]$.\n2.  $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$.\n\nThe second condition implies that for each step $i$, we must have $x_i = x_{i-1} + a_i$ or $x_i = x_{i-1} - a_i$. This can be written as $x_i = x_{i-1} + \\epsilon_i a_i$ where $\\epsilon_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\nBy induction, we can express $x_k$ in terms of the initial value $x_0$ and the choices of signs $\\epsilon_i$:\n$x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i a_i$. Let's define the partial sum $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i a_i$ for $k \\ge 1$, and $S_0 = 0$.\nSo, $x_k = x_0 + S_k$.\n\nThe condition is that for any sequence $\\{a_i\\}$, there must exist a choice of an initial value $x_0 \\in [-B, B]$ and a sequence of signs $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}_{i=1}^N$ such that for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$, we have $x_k = x_0 + S_k \\in [-B, B]$.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that for a chosen sequence of signs $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}$, there must exist an $x_0$ such that:\n$-B \\le x_0 + S_k \\le B$ for all $k=0, \\dots, N$.\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$-B - S_k \\le x_0 \\le B - S_k$ for all $k$.\nSo, we must have:\n$\\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} (-B - S_k) \\le x_0 \\le \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} (B - S_k)$.\nLet $m = \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k$ and $M_{sum} = \\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k$. The condition becomes:\n$-B - m \\le x_0 \\le B - M_{sum}$.\nSuch an $x_0$ exists if and only if the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound:\n$-B - m \\le B - M_{sum}$\n$M_{sum} - m \\le 2B$.\n\nThe range of the partial sums, $R(\\{\\epsilon_i\\}) = M_{sum} - m$, must be no more than the length of the interval $[-B, B]$, which is $2B$.\n\nThe problem states that this must hold for *any* sequence $\\{a_i\\}$. This means that for any $\\{a_i\\}$, we must be able to find a sequence of signs $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}$ that satisfies the condition. So, for any $\\{a_i\\}$, its minimal possible range must be less than or equal to $2B$.\nLet $R_{min}(\\{a_i\\}) = \\min_{\\{\\epsilon_i\\}} R(\\{\\epsilon_i\\})$.\nThe condition must hold for the worst-case sequence $\\{a_i\\}$, i.e., the one that maximizes this minimal range.\nLet $C_N = \\sup_{\\{a_i\\} \\subset [0,1]^N} R_{min}(\\{a_i\\})$.\nThe problem is now to find the smallest positive integer $M$ such that $C_N \\le 2B = 2(1-10^{-M})$.\n\n**Step 2: Finding the value of $C_N$**\n\nThe value $C_N$ is a known quantity in discrepancy theory, sometimes called the balancing constant. It is the solution to a minimax problem.\nFor a general number of terms $n$, it has been shown that\n$C_n = \\frac{2 \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor + 1}$.\nIn our problem, $N = 100000$.\nLet $h = \\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 100000/2 \\rfloor = 50000$.\nSo, the constant $C_N$ is:\n$C_{100000} = \\frac{2 \\times 50000}{50000 + 1} = \\frac{100000}{50001}$.\n\n**Step 3: Solving for M**\n\nNow we substitute this value back into our inequality:\n$C_N \\le 2(1-10^{-M})$\n$\\frac{100000}{50001} \\le 2(1-10^{-M})$\nDivide by 2:\n$\\frac{50000}{50001} \\le 1-10^{-M}$\nRearrange the terms to isolate $10^{-M}$:\n$10^{-M} \\le 1 - \\frac{50000}{50001}$\n$10^{-M} \\le \\frac{50001 - 50000}{50001}$\n$10^{-M} \\le \\frac{1}{50001}$\n\nTo solve for $M$, we take the base-10 logarithm of both sides. Since $\\log_{10}(x)$ is an increasing function, the inequality direction is preserved.\n$\\log_{10}(10^{-M}) \\le \\log_{10}(\\frac{1}{50001})$\n$-M \\le -\\log_{10}(50001)$\nMultiplying by -1 reverses the inequality sign:\n$M \\ge \\log_{10}(50001)$\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the numerical value and finding the smallest integer**\n\nWe need to find the value of $\\log_{10}(50001)$.\nWe know that $10^4 = 10000$ and $10^5 = 100000$.\nSince $10000 < 50001 < 100000$, we must have $4 < \\log_{10}(50001) < 5$.\nLet's get a more precise value:\n$\\log_{10}(50001) = \\log_{10}(5.0001 \\times 10^4) = \\log_{10}(5.0001) + \\log_{10}(10^4) = \\log_{10}(5.0001) + 4$.\nWe know that $\\log_{10}(5) \\approx 0.69897$.\n$\\log_{10}(5.0001)$ will be very slightly larger than $\\log_{10}(5)$.\nSo, $M \\ge 4 + \\log_{10}(5.0001) \\approx 4.699$.\n\nSince $M$ must be a positive integer, the smallest integer value for $M$ that satisfies this condition is $M=5$.\n\nFinal check:\nIf $M=4$, $M < 4.699$, the condition is not satisfied.\nIf $M=5$, $M > 4.699$, the condition is satisfied.\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer is $M=5$."
