    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3:** This is the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. It is a finite Coxeter group of rank 3. Its order is |H3| = 120.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For H3, the Coxeter number is `h = 10`. This is the order of any Coxeter element.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` of a group element `g` is called regular if `v` does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. A reflecting hyperplane is the set of points fixed by a reflection in the group.\n*   **Eigenvalue of Order 10:** An eigenvalue `λ` has order 10 if `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for any `1 <= k < 10`. These are the primitive 10th roots of unity.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Regular Eigenvectors to Regular Elements\n\nA fundamental theorem by T.A. Springer connects the existence of a regular eigenvector to a special class of group elements.\n\n*   **Theorem 1:** An element `g` in a finite Coxeter group `W` has a regular eigenvector if and only if `g` is a **regular element**.\n*   **Definition:** An element `g` is called a regular element if it is conjugate to a **Coxeter element** `c`.\n\nThis means the question is equivalent to asking: \"How many regular elements `g` in H3 have an eigenvalue of order 10, where the corresponding eigenvector is regular?\"\n\nSo, our search is now restricted to the elements in the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Eigenvalues of a Coxeter Element\n\nLet `c` be a Coxeter element of H3.\n\n*   **Eigenvalue Formula:** The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element are given by the formula `λ_j = exp(2 * π * i * m_j / h)`, where `h` is the Coxeter number and `{m_j}` is the set of exponents of the group.\n*   **Exponents of H3:** The exponents of H3 are `m_1 = 1`, `m_2 = 5`, and `m_3 = 9`.\n*   **Coxeter Number of H3:** `h = 10`.\n\nUsing the formula, the eigenvalues of any Coxeter element `c` (and thus any regular element `g`) are:\n1.  `λ_1 = exp(2 * π * i * 1 / 10)`\n2.  `λ_2 = exp(2 * π * i * 5 / 10) = exp(π * i) = -1`\n3.  `λ_3 = exp(2 * π * i * 9 / 10)`\n\nNow, let's check the order of these eigenvalues:\n*   The order of `λ_1` is 10 (it's a primitive 10th root of unity).\n*   The order of `λ_2` is 2.\n*   The order of `λ_3` is 10 (it's also a primitive 10th root of unity, as `gcd(9, 10)=1`).\n\nSo, every regular element in H3 has two eigenvalues of order 10.\n\n### Step 4: Identify Which Eigenvectors are Regular\n\nWe now know that every regular element has eigenvalues of order 10. The final piece is to confirm that the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues are indeed regular.\n\n*   **Theorem 2 (Springer):** For a Coxeter element `c`, an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = exp(2 * π * i * k / h)` is regular if and only if `gcd(k, h) = 1`.\n\nLet's apply this theorem to the eigenvalues of `c`:\n*   For `λ_1 = exp(2πi * 1/10)`, we have `k=1`. Since `gcd(1, 10) = 1`, the corresponding eigenvector is **regular**. The eigenvalue has order 10. This matches the condition in the question.\n*   For `λ_2 = exp(2πi * 5/10)`, we have `k=5`. Since `gcd(5, 10) = 5 ≠ 1`, the corresponding eigenvector is **not regular**.\n*   For `λ_3 = exp(2πi * 9/10)`, we have `k=9`. Since `gcd(9, 10) = 1`, the corresponding eigenvector is **regular**. The eigenvalue has order 10. This also matches the condition.\n\nThis confirms that for any Coxeter element `c`, its regular eigenvectors are precisely those whose eigenvalues have order 10. If an element `g` is conjugate to `c` (`g = pcp^{-1}`), its eigenvectors are of the form `pv` where `v` is an eigenvector of `c`. The property of being regular is preserved under the group action, so `g` also has regular eigenvectors corresponding to its eigenvalues of order 10.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Number of Such Elements\n\nWe have established that the elements satisfying the question's conditions are precisely the set of all regular elements in H3. A regular element is any element conjugate to a Coxeter element `c`. Therefore, we just need to find the size of the conjugacy class of `c`.\n\n*   **Formula for Conjugacy Class Size:** The size of the conjugacy class of an element `c` in a group `G` is given by `|G| / |C_G(c)|`, where `C_G(c)` is the centralizer of `c` in `G`.\n*   **Centralizer of a Coxeter Element:** For any finite Coxeter group `W`, the centralizer of a Coxeter element `c` is the cyclic group generated by `c` itself. That is, `C_W(c) = <c>`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   The order of the group is `|H3| = 120`.\n    *   The order of the Coxeter element `c` is `h=10`.\n    *   The size of the centralizer is `|C_{H3}(c)| = |<c>| = ord(c) = 10`.\n    *   The number of elements in the conjugacy class of `c` is `120 / 10 = 12`.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe elements that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 are precisely the regular elements of the group H3. The number of these elements is equal to the size of the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element, which is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
