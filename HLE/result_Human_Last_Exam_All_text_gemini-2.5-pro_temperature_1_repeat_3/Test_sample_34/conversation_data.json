    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Position: The Button (BTN)**\n    *   The button is the most powerful position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street (flop, turn, river).\n    *   This positional advantage is immense, as it allows you to control the size of the pot and realize your equity more effectively.\n    *   Because of this, you should play the widest range of hands from the button compared to any other position.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Game Conditions: 100BB Rake-Free Cash Game**\n    *   **100BB:** This is the standard stack depth for cash games, meaning we use standard opening ranges. We are not short-stacked (where we might shove or fold) or super deep-stacked (which would further increase the value of suited hands).\n    *   **Rake-Free:** This is a critical detail. In a normal game, the house takes a percentage of the pot (the \"rake\"). This rake makes it less profitable to win small pots. The most common pre-flop win is simply taking down the blinds (1.5BB). In a raked game, the EV of opening very marginal hands can become negative because the rake eats into your small profits. In a **rake-free** environment, every small pot won is pure profit. This significantly increases the incentive to open-raise with a wider range of hands, as even the most marginal hands become profitable.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Hand Category: Suited Jacks (JXs)**\n    *   We need to find the \"worst\" suited jack that is still a profitable open. This means we need to rank all possible suited jack combinations from best to worst.\n    *   The value of a suited hand like JXs comes from three main sources:\n        1.  **High Card Value:** Making a pair of Jacks. The kicker (the 'X' card) matters.\n        2.  **Flush Potential:** Making a flush, which is a very strong hand.\n        3.  **Straight Potential:** How well the two cards connect to make straights.\n    *   Ranking the suited jacks based on these factors:\n        *   **JTs:** Best. Strong top pair, excellent straight and flush potential.\n        *   **J9s, J8s:** Very strong. Good top pair, good straight and flush potential (suited connectors/gappers).\n        *   **J7s - J5s:** Still strong. Playability decreases as the gap between the cards widens, but they remain standard opens from the button. J5s is notable as it can connect with an Ace-high flop to make a wheel straight (A-2-3-4-5).\n        *   **J4s, J3s, J2s:** These are the weakest suited jacks. The kicker is very low, reducing the value of making a top pair. The straight potential is also minimal, as they don't connect well with each other. Their primary value comes from their flush potential.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude**\n    *   In a standard, *raked* game, GTO (Game Theory Optimal) solvers show that a button opening range is very wide (~45-50%). This range typically includes all suited jacks, although the very bottom ones (J3s, J2s) might be mixed strategies (i.e., open sometimes, fold other times).\n    *   However, in the specified **rake-free** game, the profitability threshold for opening is lower. Those marginal hands that were \"mixes\" or slight folds in a raked game become clear, profitable opens.\n    *   Therefore, in a rake-free 100BB game, you should be opening *all* suited jacks from the button.\n    *   The question asks for the *worst* of these hands that you should still open. By ranking the suited jacks, the one with the lowest overall value is Jack-Two suited (J2s). It has the worst kicker and the least straight potential. Since it is still a profitable open under these game conditions, it is the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Don't confuse \"worst\" with \"unplayable\":** The question asks for the worst hand you *should* open, implying it is a correct and profitable play.\n*   **The \"rake-free\" clause is the key:** Without this detail, the answer might be J3s or J4s, as J2s could become a -EV (losing) open depending on the specific rake structure.\n*   **Position is paramount:** This answer is only valid for the button. From any other position, J2s would be a clear fold.\n\nThe worst suited jack you should open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game is Jack-Two suited.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
