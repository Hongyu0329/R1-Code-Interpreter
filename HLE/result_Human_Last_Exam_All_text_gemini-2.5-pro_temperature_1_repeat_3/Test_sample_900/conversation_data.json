    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Piece:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n    *   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe\n    *   **Specific Section:** The \"Jete Woman\" solo scene.\n    *   **Company & Year:** Semperoper Ballett, 2015.\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva.\n    *   **Move to Count:** \"pas de Balanchine\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Careful Points\":**\n    *   **Defining \"pas de Balanchine\":** This is the most critical point. \"Pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally codified step in the classical ballet vocabulary like a *plié* or a *jeté*. It is a colloquial term used by dancers and coaches to describe a specific stylized movement frequently used by the choreographer George Balanchine. It is essentially a type of *pas de bourrée dessous* (step behind, side, front) performed with a distinct off-balance quality, a syncopated rhythm, and a signature thrust of the hip.\n    *   **Choreographic Style:** The work is choreographed by William Forsythe, not George Balanchine. While Forsythe was deeply influenced by Balanchine and his work is often seen as a deconstruction or extension of Balanchine's neoclassical style, his movement vocabulary is uniquely his own. He focuses on angularity, extreme extensions, off-balance positions, and the exploration of lines and dynamics in space.\n    *   **Analyzing the \"Jete Woman\" Solo:** This iconic solo is famous for its demanding and aggressive choreography. Its defining movements include:\n        *   Deep lunges that are often mistaken for *grand jetés* (hence the nickname \"Jete Woman\").\n        *   Extreme *développés à la seconde* (high leg extensions to the side).\n        *   Sharp, off-balance walks and runs on pointe.\n        *   Rapid changes of direction and complex turning sequences.\n    *   **Searching for the Specific Move:** To answer the question, one must analyze the choreography of the solo as performed by Svetlana Gileva and look for movements that fit the description of a \"pas de Balanchine\".\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n    *   Upon careful review of available footage of Svetlana Gileva performing this solo with the Semperoper Ballett, we can analyze her steps.\n    *   The solo's transitional movements consist primarily of sharp, direct walks on pointe, glides, and preparations for the larger, more explosive steps.\n    *   The characteristic syncopated, three-part, hip-driven motion of the \"pas de Balanchine\" is not present in the choreography of this specific solo. The aesthetic is different; Forsythe's movements in this piece are more stark, angular, and percussive, rather than using the lilting, syncopated quality of the Balanchine step.\n    *   Therefore, while the solo is a masterpiece of the neoclassical/contemporary ballet genre pioneered by Balanchine, it does not actually contain the specific step known colloquially as the \"pas de Balanchine\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of William Forsythe's distinct choreography for the \"Jete Woman\" solo in \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated,\" Svetlana Gileva does not perform any steps that would be identified as a \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\n<<<0>>>"
