    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 distinct, two-dimensional crystallographic groups that describe all possible repeating patterns in a plane. They are defined by the symmetries they possess, including translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections.\n*   **Point Group (or Crystal Class):** For any wallpaper group, the point group is the set of symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point in the plane fixed. Translations and the translational components of glide reflections are ignored when determining the point group.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements it contains. In this context, it's the number of distinct symmetry operations in the point group.\n\nThe question asks for the number of wallpaper groups whose associated point group has exactly two elements (i.e., order 2).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Possible Point Groups of Order 2\n\nIn two dimensions, the symmetry operations that can fix a point are rotations and reflections. A group of order 2 must contain the identity element and one other element.\nThe possible point groups of order 2 are:\n\n1.  **C₂ (Cyclic group of order 2):** This group consists of the identity operation and a 2-fold (180°) rotation.\n2.  **D₁ (Dihedral group of order 2, also denoted Cₛ or Cₘ):** This group consists of the identity operation and a single reflection across a line.\n\nTherefore, we need to find all wallpaper groups whose point group is either C₂ or D₁.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each of the 17 Wallpaper Groups\n\nWe will now go through the standard list of the 17 wallpaper groups (using IUC notation) and identify the order of their respective point groups.\n\n1.  **p1:** Point group **C₁** (only identity). Order = 1.\n2.  **p2:** Contains 2-fold rotation centers. The point group is **C₂**. **Order = 2**.\n3.  **pm:** Contains reflection lines. The point group is **D₁**. **Order = 2**.\n4.  **pg:** Contains glide reflection lines. The point group is formed by considering the reflection part of the glide reflection, which is **D₁**. **Order = 2**.\n5.  **cm:** Contains reflection lines on a centered lattice. The point group is **D₁**. **Order = 2**.\n6.  **p2mm (pmm):** Contains perpendicular reflection lines, which generate 2-fold rotations. The point group is **D₂**. Order = 4.\n7.  **p2mg (pmg):** Contains reflections and glide reflections. The point group is **D₂**. Order = 4.\n8.  **p2gg (pgg):** Contains two perpendicular glide reflection lines. The point group is **D₂**. Order = 4.\n9.  **c2mm (cmm):** Contains perpendicular reflection lines on a centered lattice. The point group is **D₂**. Order = 4.\n10. **p4:** Contains 4-fold and 2-fold rotation centers. The point group is **C₄**. Order = 4.\n11. **p4mm (p4m):** Contains 4-fold rotations and reflections. The point group is **D₄**. Order = 8.\n12. **p4gm (p4g):** Contains 4-fold rotations and glide reflections. The point group is **D₄**. Order = 8.\n13. **p3:** Contains 3-fold rotation centers. The point group is **C₃**. Order = 3.\n14. **p3m1:** Contains 3-fold rotations and reflections. The point group is **D₃**. Order = 6.\n15. **p31m:** Contains 3-fold rotations and reflections in a different orientation. The point group is **D₃**. Order = 6.\n16. **p6:** Contains 6-fold, 3-fold, and 2-fold rotation centers. The point group is **C₆**. Order = 6.\n17. **p6mm (p6m):** Contains 6-fold rotations and reflections. The point group is **D₆**. Order = 12.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Relevant Groups\n\nFrom the analysis in Step 3, we identify the wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2. These are:\n\n*   **p2** (Point Group C₂)\n*   **pm** (Point Group D₁)\n*   **pg** (Point Group D₁)\n*   **cm** (Point Group D₁)\n\nCounting these groups, we find there are a total of 4.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are 4 wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
