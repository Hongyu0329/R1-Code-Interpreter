    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(10).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Object to count:** Self-avoiding walks (SAWs).\n    *   **Lattice:** A Manhattan lattice, also known as a 2D square grid. Moves are restricted to up, down, left, or right.\n    *   **Walk Length (n):** The walk consists of `n` steps. For this problem, `n = 10`.\n    *   **Self-avoiding:** The path never visits the same point (vertex) more than once.\n    *   **Function a(n):** This function represents the total number of unique `n`-step self-avoiding walks starting from a fixed origin.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the specific value of `a(10)`.\n\n2.  **Careful Points to Consider:**\n    *   **Starting Point:** By convention, all walks start at a fixed origin, say (0,0).\n    *   **No Simple Formula:** The number of choices for each step is not constant. While the first step has 4 choices and the second has 3, the number of choices for subsequent steps depends on the entire shape of the path taken so far.\n    *   **The \"Trapping\" Problem:** A simple formula like `a(n) = 4 * 3^(n-1)` fails because a walk can block its own potential future paths. For example, a path like \"Right-Up-Left\" creates a C-shape, and the next step has fewer options than a straight path would. This possibility of self-intersection makes direct calculation complex.\n    *   **Computational Complexity:** Due to the \"trapping\" problem, the only way to find the exact number for larger `n` is through exhaustive enumeration, typically performed by a computer program using a backtracking algorithm. Manual calculation is only feasible for very small `n`.\n    *   **Known Sequence:** This is a famous problem in combinatorics and statistical physics. The sequence of numbers `a(n)` is well-studied and its values have been computed and tabulated (it is sequence A001411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, OEIS).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will calculate the first few terms of the sequence `a(n)` manually to demonstrate the process and its increasing complexity.\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate a(1)**\n    *   A 1-step walk starts at (0,0) and takes one step.\n    *   The possible moves are Right, Left, Up, or Down. All 4 are valid and unique.\n    *   Therefore, **a(1) = 4**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate a(2)**\n    *   We start with the 4 paths from n=1. For each of these, we take a second step.\n    *   Let's take the path \"Right\" to (1,0). From (1,0), we can move Right, Up, or Down. We cannot move Left back to (0,0) as the walk must be self-avoiding.\n    *   So, there are 3 valid choices for the second step for each of the 4 initial paths.\n    *   Total walks = 4 (choices for step 1) * 3 (choices for step 2) = 12.\n    *   Therefore, **a(2) = 12**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate a(3)**\n    *   For any of the 12 paths of length 2, the third step cannot backtrack. For a 2-step path, no other self-intersections are possible besides immediate backtracking. For example, from path \"Right-Up\" ending at (1,1), the neighbors are (2,1), (0,1), (1,2), (1,0). Only (1,0) has been visited. Thus, there are 3 valid moves.\n    *   This holds for all 12 paths of length 2.\n    *   Total walks = 12 (paths of length 2) * 3 (choices for step 3) = 36.\n    *   Therefore, **a(3) = 36**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate a(4)**\n    *   This is where the trapping problem first appears. We need to analyze the 36 paths of length 3.\n    *   Most 3-step paths (like R-R-R or R-R-U) allow 3 non-backtracking moves for the 4th step.\n    *   However, consider a path that forms a \"C\" shape, such as \"Right-Up-Left\", with vertices (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1).\n    *   From the endpoint (0,1), the neighbors are (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), (0,0). The path has already visited (1,1) and (0,0). So, only 2 moves are possible: to (-1,1) or (0,2).\n    *   There are 8 such \"C-shaped\" paths of length 3 (RUL, RDR, LUR, LDL, etc.). These 8 paths only contribute `8 * 2 = 16` new paths of length 4.\n    *   The remaining `36 - 8 = 28` paths of length 3 do not form this trap, and each allows for 3 valid moves. They contribute `28 * 3 = 84` new paths.\n    *   Total walks = 16 + 84 = 100.\n    *   Therefore, **a(4) = 100**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Finding a(10)**\n    *   As demonstrated, the manual calculation becomes rapidly more complex as `n` increases. For each step, we would need to classify all paths from the previous step by their shape to determine the number of valid next moves.\n    *   This enumeration is continued using computer algorithms. The established values for the sequence are:\n        *   a(1) = 4\n        *   a(2) = 12\n        *   a(3) = 36\n        *   a(4) = 100\n        *   a(5) = 284\n        *   a(6) = 780\n        *   a(7) = 2,172\n        *   a(8) = 5,916\n        *   a(9) = 16,268\n        *   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\nThe final answer is the computationally-derived value for a(10).\n\n<<<44100>>>"
