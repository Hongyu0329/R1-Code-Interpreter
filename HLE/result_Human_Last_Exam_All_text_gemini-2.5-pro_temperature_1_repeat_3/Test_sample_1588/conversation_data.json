    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Expansion**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for `Z = log(exp(X)exp(Y))` where X and Y are non-commuting variables (like matrices). The expansion is an infinite series of nested commutators of X and Y.\nThe formula starts as:\n`Z = X + Y + (1/2)[X, Y] + (1/12)[X, [X, Y]] - (1/12)[Y, [X, Y]] + ...`\n\nThe *order* (or degree) of a term is the total count of X's and Y's within it.\n- Order 1: `X`, `Y`\n- Order 2: `[X, Y]`\n- Order 3: `[X, [X, Y]]`, `[Y, [X, Y]]`\n- and so on.\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-zero coefficients for terms of order 10.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the BCH Expansion to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe terms in the BCH expansion are elements of a mathematical structure called a **free Lie algebra**. For the expansion of `log(exp(X)exp(Y))`, the terms are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, `X` and `Y`, which we can denote as `L(X, Y)`.\n\nThe terms of a specific order *n* form a vector space. The \"number of non-zero coefficients\" is equivalent to the number of linearly independent terms of that order. This number is the **dimension** of the subspace of homogeneous elements of degree *n*. It is a known result that in the standard BCH formula, the coefficients for all these basis elements are non-zero.\n\n**Step 3: Introduce Witt's Formula**\n\nThe dimension of the subspace of homogeneous elements of degree *n* in a free Lie algebra with *k* generators is given by **Witt's formula**.\n\nThe formula is:\n`l_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n- `n` is the order (degree).\n- `k` is the number of generators.\n- The summation `Σ_{d|n}` is over all positive integers `d` that divide `n`.\n- `μ(d)` is the **Möbius function**.\n\n**Step 4: Define the Parameters for this Problem**\n\n- We are interested in order 10, so `n = 10`.\n- The expansion is in terms of `X` and `Y`, so there are 2 generators, `k = 2`.\n\nPlugging these values into Witt's formula, we need to calculate:\n`l_10(2) = (1/10) * Σ_{d|10} μ(d) * 2^(10/d)`\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Calculation**\n\nFirst, we need to identify all divisors of `n=10` and the corresponding values of the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n\n*   **Divisors of 10:** The positive integers `d` that divide 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n\n*   **Möbius function `μ(d)` values:**\n    - `μ(1) = 1` (by definition).\n    - `μ(2) = -1` (2 is a single prime).\n    - `μ(5) = -1` (5 is a single prime).\n    - `μ(10) = μ(2 * 5) = (-1)^2 = 1` (10 is the product of 2 distinct primes).\n\nNow, we calculate each term in the summation `Σ μ(d) * 2^(10/d)`:\n\n*   For `d = 1`:\n    `μ(1) * 2^(10/1) = 1 * 2^10 = 1 * 1024 = 1024`\n\n*   For `d = 2`:\n    `μ(2) * 2^(10/2) = -1 * 2^5 = -1 * 32 = -32`\n\n*   For `d = 5`:\n    `μ(5) * 2^(10/5) = -1 * 2^2 = -1 * 4 = -4`\n\n*   For `d = 10`:\n    `μ(10) * 2^(10/10) = 1 * 2^1 = 1 * 2 = 2`\n\nNext, we sum these values:\n`Sum = 1024 + (-32) + (-4) + 2 = 1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990`\n\nFinally, we apply the `(1/n)` factor from Witt's formula:\n`l_10(2) = (1/10) * 990 = 99`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of linearly independent terms, and therefore the number of non-zero coefficients, of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
