    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Kanji Character**\nFirst, we need to look at the structure of the character 謄. It is composed of two parts, arranged side-by-side in a left-right structure.\n*   The left part is: 言\n*   The right part is: 朕\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nIn Japanese kanji, the radical (部首, bushu) is the component used to classify the character in dictionaries. For characters with a left-right structure (known as a \"hen\" on the left and a \"tsukuri\" on the right), the left-hand component is very often the radical, especially when it's one of the 214 classic radicals.\n\n*   The left part, 言, is a very common radical. It relates to \"speech,\" \"words,\" or \"language.\"\n*   The character 謄 means \"to copy out,\" \"to transcribe,\" which is an action related to words.\n*   Therefore, the semantic component and the radical of 謄 is 言.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Name of the Radical**\nThe name of a radical often depends on its position within the character.\n*   The radical is 言.\n*   When it appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n*   The specific name for the 言 radical when it is on the left is \"gonben\" (ごんべん). \"Gon\" is a reading of 言, and \"ben\" is a voiced form of \"hen\".\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe final step is to write the Japanese name of the radical using Hepburn romanization, as requested by the prompt.\n*   The hiragana for the radical's name is ごんべん.\n*   ご -> go\n*   ん -> n\n*   べ -> be\n*   ん -> n\n*   Putting it together, the Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Correctly identify the components:** It's crucial to correctly split the character into its constituent parts. 謄 is clearly 言 + 朕.\n2.  **Understand radical positioning:** The name of a radical can change with its position. For example, the radical 心 (heart) is called \"kokoro\" when it is at the bottom (as in 思), but \"risshinben\" when it appears on the left in its variant form 忄 (as in 忙). In our case, 言 is on the left, so we use its \"hen\" name.\n3.  **Use the correct Hepburn transcription:** Ensure the Japanese hiragana is converted to roman letters according to the standard Hepburn system.\n\nBy following these steps, we confidently arrive at the correct name for the radical.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
