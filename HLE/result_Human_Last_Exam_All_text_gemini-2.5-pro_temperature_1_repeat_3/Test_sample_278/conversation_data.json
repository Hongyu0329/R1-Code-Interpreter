    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parametric Curve**\nThe curve is defined in two parts based on the parameter `t`.\n\n*   **Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n    The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$ (since $b=1$).\n    If we square and add the equations, we get $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin (0,0).\n    As `t` goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, the point $(x,y)$ traces the upper half of this circle, starting from $(\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$ and ending at $(\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n    For this part, the x-values range from -1 to 1, and the y-values range from 0 to 1.\n\n*   **Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n    The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$ (since $b=5$).\n    To find the Cartesian equation, we can write $\\cos t = x$ and $\\sin t = y/5$. Squaring and adding gives $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which simplifies to $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin (0,0) with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n    As `t` goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, the value of $\\sin t$ is negative (from 0 down to -1 and back to 0). This means the point $(x,y)$ traces the lower half of this ellipse, starting from a point infinitesimally close to $(\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$ and ending at a point infinitesimally close to $(\\cos 2\\pi, 5\\sin 2\\pi) = (1, 0)$.\n    For this part, the x-values range from -1 to 1. The y-values range from $5 \\times (-1) = -5$ (at $t=3\\pi/2$) to 0.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Bounding Box of the Entire Figure**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum x and y coordinates. This will define the smallest bounding rectangle.\n\n*   **Range of x-coordinates:**\n    In both parts, $x = \\cos t$. Over the full interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, the range of $\\cos t$ is $[-1, 1]$.\n    So, $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$.\n    The width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Range of y-coordinates:**\n    From Part 1, the y-values are in the range $[0, 1]$. So, the maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n    From Part 2, the y-values are in the range $[-5, 0)$. So, the minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n    Combining both parts, the overall range for y is $[-5, 1]$.\n    The height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Smallest Circumscribing Square**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle with a width of 2 and a height of 6. A square must have equal side lengths. To enclose this rectangle, the side length of the square must be at least as large as the larger dimension of the rectangle.\n\n*   Width of bounding rectangle = 2\n*   Height of bounding rectangle = 6\n*   The larger dimension is 6.\n\nTherefore, the smallest square that can outcircle (circumscribe) the figure must have a side length of 6.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Square**\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\n\n*   Side length = 6\n*   Area = $6^2 = 36$\n\n<<<36>>>"
