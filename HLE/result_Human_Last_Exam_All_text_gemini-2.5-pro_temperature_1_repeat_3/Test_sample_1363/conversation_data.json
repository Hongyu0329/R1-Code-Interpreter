    "This is an analysis of the technique of standard ballroom dances to determine in which one a reverse turn cannot be overturned without violating its fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 1: Define \"Overturning a Reverse Turn\"**\nA \"Reverse Turn\" is a standard figure in ballroom dancing that rotates to the left (counter-clockwise). Typically, it is designed to turn a specific amount, often 3/4 to a full 360 degrees over a set number of steps. \"Overturning\" means rotating more than this standard amount. This is a common practice in most dances for floorcraft (navigating corners or other couples) and for creating a more dynamic look.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the technical requirements of a \"Reverse Turn\" in each dance.**\nThe question asks where this overturning is \"impossible... without disregarding the technique.\" This means we are looking for a dance where the core technical elements are fundamentally incompatible with adding extra rotation to a reverse turn.\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This dance is characterized by continuous rotation. While the basic figures have a prescribed amount of turn, skilled dancers can and do adjust the rotation, especially at corners, to navigate the floor. It is difficult but not technically impossible or against the core principles of the dance.\n*   **B. English Waltz (Slow Waltz):** This is a \"swing\" dance, characterized by body sway, rise and fall, and momentum. The technique of using sway and momentum not only allows for overturning turns but makes it a standard and essential part of competitive dancing. Overturning a reverse turn is a common way to get around a corner. Therefore, it is not impossible here.\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Like the Waltz, the Foxtrot is a \"swing\" dance. It emphasizes continuous, flowing movement. The technique, which includes sway and driving actions, is well-suited for overturning turns. It is a common and accepted variation.\n*   **E. Quickstep:** This is the fastest of the swing dances. Due to the high speed and need for dynamic movement and floorcraft, overturning turns is not only possible but frequently necessary. The energetic character of the dance supports this kind of variation.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is fundamentally different from the \"swing\" dances listed above. Its core technique includes the following principles:\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is performed on a level plane with bent knees.\n    *   **No Body Sway:** The body is held strong and upright, without leaning into the turn.\n    *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, deliberate, and have a clipped feeling, rather than a continuous, flowing momentum.\n    *   **Specific Foot Placement:** The feet are picked up and placed, not glided in the same way as in swing dances. The \"Open Reverse Turn\" in Tango has very precise amounts of turn for each step.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize and Conclude**\nIn the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), the use of sway and momentum provides the mechanism to generate extra rotation, making overturning a natural extension of the basic technique.\n\nIn Tango, these mechanisms are explicitly forbidden. There is no sway and no continuous momentum to \"fling\" the turn into a greater rotation. Attempting to overturn a Tango Reverse Turn would require introducing sway or a swinging action, which directly violates the core technical principles of the dance. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango Reverse Turn *without disregarding the technique*. The action would cease to be a correct Tango figure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
