    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A finite set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverse elements for all its members.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `a, b ∈ S` (where `a` and `b` can be the same element), their product `a * b` is not in `S`. In other words, `S ∩ (S * S) = ∅`, where `S * S = {s₁ * s₂ | s₁, s₂ ∈ S}`.\n*   **Maximality by Inclusion:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n*   **The Question:** We are looking for the number of non-isomorphic finite groups `G` that contain at least one maximal product-free set `S` with `|S| = 3`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Maximality Condition\n\nLet `S` be a maximal product-free set of size 3. For any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free. Since `S` itself is product-free, the product that falls into `S ∪ {g}` must involve `g`. This means for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, at least one of the following conditions must hold:\n1.  `g * g ∈ S ∪ {g}`\n2.  `g * s ∈ S ∪ {g}` for some `s ∈ S`\n3.  `s * g ∈ S ∪ {g}` for some `s ∈ S`\n4.  `s₁ * s₂ = g` for some `s₁, s₂ ∈ S`\n\nLet's simplify these conditions. We note that the identity element `e` cannot be in `S`, because if `e ∈ S`, then `e * e = e ∈ S`, which violates the product-free condition. Since `e ∉ S`, `e` is one of the elements in `G \\ S`. The maximality condition applied to `g=e` is always satisfied because for any `s ∈ S`, `e * s = s ∈ S`, making `S ∪ {e}` not product-free.\n\nSo, for any element `g ∈ G \\ (S ∪ {e})`, one of these must be true:\n*   `g ∈ S * S`\n*   `g * g ∈ S`\n*   `g * s ∈ S` for some `s ∈ S`\n*   `s * g ∈ S` for some `s ∈ S`\n\nThis framework is complex to use directly for finding all groups. A more structured approach relies on established theorems about maximal product-free sets.\n\n### Step 3: Searching for Candidate Groups using Structure Theorems\n\nWe will investigate abelian and non-abelian groups separately.\n\n#### A) Abelian Groups\n\nFor abelian groups (using additive notation, where we look for sum-free sets), the structure of maximal sum-free sets is well understood from the work of Diananda and Yap. One key result states that if `S` is a maximal sum-free set in an abelian group `G`, it's often a coset of a subgroup or a union of cosets.\n\nA particularly useful case from their results is when `S` is a coset `g+H` of a subgroup `H`. For `S` to have size 3, `H` must be a subgroup of order 3. Let `G` be an abelian group with a subgroup `H` of order 3, and let the quotient group `G/H` be cyclic of order 3, i.e., `G/H ≅ C₃`. This implies `|G| = |H| * |G/H| = 3 * 3 = 9`.\n\nThe abelian groups of order 9 are `C₉` and `C₃ × C₃`. Let's check them.\n\n1.  **G = C₉** (the cyclic group of order 9): Let `G = <x>`. It has a unique subgroup of order 3, `H = {e, x³, x⁶}`. The cosets are `H`, `S₁ = xH = {x, x⁴, x⁷}`, and `S₂ = x²H = {x², x⁵, x⁸}`.\n    *   Let's test `S = S₁`. The set of products is `S * S = {s₁ * s₂ | s₁, s₂ ∈ S₁} = (xH)*(xH) = x²H = S₂`. Since `S₁ ∩ S₂ = ∅`, `S₁` is product-free.\n    *   To check for maximality, we must show that adding any element from `G \\ S₁ = H ∪ S₂` makes the set not product-free.\n        *   If we add `g ∈ H`, then for any `s = xh ∈ S₁`, `s * g⁻¹ = xhg⁻¹ = xh' ∈ S₁`. So `s = (xh') * g`. This means `S₁ ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n        *   If we add `g ∈ S₂`, then `g ∈ S * S`. This means `S₁ ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n    *   Thus, `S₁ = {x, x⁴, x⁷}` is a maximal product-free set of size 3 in `C₉`.\n\n2.  **G = C₃ × C₃**: Let `H` be any subgroup of order 3, e.g., `H = <(1,0)> = {(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)}`. The cosets are `H`, `S₁ = (0,1)+H = {(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)}`, and `S₂ = (0,2)+H = {(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)}`.\n    *   Let's test `S = S₁`. The set of sums `S+S` is `((0,1)+H) + ((0,1)+H) = (0,2)+H = S₂`. `S₁ ∩ S₂ = ∅`, so `S₁` is sum-free.\n    *   The maximality argument is identical to the one for `C₉`. `S₁` is a maximal sum-free set.\n\nNow, let's check other small abelian groups.\n3.  **G = C₆**: Let `G = <x>`. Consider the set `S = {x, x³, x⁵}`.\n    *   Products: `x*x=x²`, `x*x³=x⁴`, `x*x⁵=e`, `x³*x³=x⁶=e`, `x³*x⁵=x⁸=x²`, `x⁵*x⁵=x¹⁰=x⁴`. So `S*S = {e, x², x⁴}`.\n    *   `S ∩ S*S = ∅`, so `S` is product-free.\n    *   `G \\ S = {e, x², x⁴}`. Every element of `G\\S` is in `S*S` or is the identity. As shown before, adding any of these elements makes the set not product-free. Thus, `S` is maximal.\n\nOther small abelian groups like `C₄`, `C₅`, `C₇`, `C₈`, `C₂×C₄` can be shown to not contain any maximal product-free sets of size 3.\n\nSo, we have found 3 abelian groups: `C₆`, `C₉`, and `C₃ × C₃`.\n\n#### B) Non-Abelian Groups\n\nA theorem by Street and Whitehead states that if `S` is a maximal product-free set in `G`, then either `G = S ∪ S*S ∪ {e}` or `S` is a normal subset of `G` (i.e., `gSg⁻¹ = S` for all `g ∈ G`).\n\nLet's check small non-abelian groups.\n\n4.  **G = S₃** (the symmetric group of order 6): Let `S` be the set of transpositions, `S = {(12), (13), (23)}`.\n    *   Products: `(12)(12)=e`, `(12)(13)=(132)`, `(13)(12)=(123)`, etc. The set of products is `S*S = {e, (123), (132)}`.\n    *   `S ∩ S*S = ∅`, so `S` is product-free.\n    *   `G \\ S = {e, (123), (132)}`. This is exactly `S*S`. For any `g ∈ G \\ S`, `g ∈ S*S`, so `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free. `S` is maximal.\n\nWhat about other non-abelian groups?\n*   Groups of order 8 (`D₄`, `Q₈`): It can be shown they do not contain such sets.\n*   Groups of order 10 (`D₅`): No such sets.\n*   Groups of order 12 (`A₄`, `D₆`, `C₃ ⋊ C₄`):\n    *   In `A₄`, the only conjugacy class of size 3 is `K = {(12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}`. This set is not product-free, as `(12)(34) * (13)(24) = (14)(23) ∈ K`.\n    *   It can be shown through case analysis that `D₆` and `C₃ ⋊ C₄` also do not contain such sets.\n\nThe analysis of `S` as a normal subset consisting of a single conjugacy class of size 3 does not yield other examples. If `S` is a union of central conjugacy classes, it implies `S ⊂ Z(G)`, and `S` must be a maximal product-free set in the abelian group `Z(G)`. This would require `Z(G)` to be one of `C₆, C₉, C₃×C₃`. However, a theorem states that for a non-abelian group `G`, `|G/Z(G)|` cannot be prime, and more strongly `|G:Z(G)| ≥ 4`. This rules out finding new non-abelian groups this way for small orders.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nThe analysis yields four non-isomorphic groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3. These are:\n1.  **C₆** (Cyclic group of order 6)\n2.  **S₃** (Symmetric group of order 6)\n3.  **C₉** (Cyclic group of order 9)\n4.  **C₃ × C₃** (Elementary abelian group of order 9)\n\nThese four groups are mutually non-isomorphic.\n\nThus, there are 4 such finite groups.\n\n<<<4>>>"
