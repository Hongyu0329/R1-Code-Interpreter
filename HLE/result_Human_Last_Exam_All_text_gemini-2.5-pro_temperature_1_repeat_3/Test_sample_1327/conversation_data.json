    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**The sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )**\n\n**Step 1: Look for a simple relationship between consecutive terms.**\nLet's analyze the difference between consecutive terms (first-order differences).\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no obvious simple arithmetic or geometric pattern here.\n\nLet's try looking for a multiplicative relationship. A common pattern in such sequences is of the form `a_n = k * a_(n-1) + c`, where `k` and `c` might be constants or follow their own pattern. Let's test `k=2`.\n*   2 * 2 = 4. To get 11, we must add 7. (11 = 2 * 2 + 7)\n*   2 * 11 = 22. To get 23, we must add 1. (23 = 2 * 11 + 1)\n*   2 * 23 = 46. To get 51, we must add 5. (51 = 2 * 23 + 5)\n*   2 * 51 = 102. To get 119, we must add 17. (119 = 2 * 51 + 17)\n\nThis reveals a consistent structure: `Term(n) = 2 * Term(n-1) + Added_Number`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of \"Added Numbers\".**\nThe sequence of added numbers is: (7), 1, 5, 17.\nOften, in these types of problems, the pattern does not apply to the very first term. Let's ignore the first added number (7) for a moment and look for a pattern in the rest of the sequence: 1, 5, 17.\n\n**Step 3: Find the pattern within the sequence of added numbers (1, 5, 17).**\nLet's find the differences between the terms in this new sequence.\n*   5 - 1 = 4\n*   17 - 5 = 12\nThe sequence of differences is 4, 12.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the pattern in the new difference sequence (4, 12).**\nThis is a simple geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 to get the next term.\n*   4 * 3 = 12\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next term in this difference sequence will be:\n*   12 * 3 = 36\n\n**Step 5: Use the pattern to find the next \"Added Number\".**\nWe can now find the next term in the sequence of added numbers (1, 5, 17, ...) by adding the next difference (36) to the last term (17).\n*   Next Added Number = 17 + 36 = 53.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the missing term in the original sequence.**\nNow we can use the main pattern `Term(n) = 2 * Term(n-1) + Added_Number` to find the number that should be in the parentheses.\n*   The last known term is 119.\n*   The next \"Added Number\" is 53.\n*   Missing Term = 2 * 119 + 53\n*   Missing Term = 238 + 53\n*   Missing Term = 291\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pattern is that each term is twice the previous term plus a number. This sequence of added numbers (starting from the third term) follows a pattern where its differences form a geometric progression with a ratio of 3. Following this logic, the next term in the sequence is 291.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA. 291\nB. 285\nC. 171\nD. 167\nOur calculated answer, 291, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
