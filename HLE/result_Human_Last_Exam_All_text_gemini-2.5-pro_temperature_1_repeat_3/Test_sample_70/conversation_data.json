    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Flag of Denmark and Determine its Rank\n\n1.  **Represent the flag as a matrix:** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. To represent this as a matrix, we assign a numerical value to each color. To maximize the rank, we must choose distinct values for the colors, for example, Red = `r` and White = `w`, where `r ≠ w` and neither is zero.\n\n2.  **Identify the row patterns:** A matrix of the Danish flag would have rows corresponding to its horizontal sections.\n    *   The upper and lower parts of the flag consist of a red field interrupted by the vertical bar of the white cross. All rows in these sections will have the same pattern, for example: `v₁ = [r, r, ..., r, w, r, ..., r]`.\n    *   The middle part of the flag is the horizontal bar of the white cross. All rows in this section will be solid white, having the pattern: `v₂ = [w, w, ..., w, w, w, ..., w]`.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of linearly independent rows (the rank):** The entire flag matrix is composed of only two distinct types of rows, `v₁` and `v₂`. To find the rank, we check if these two row vectors are linearly independent.\n    *   Let `u` be the all-ones vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`. Then `v₂` can be written as `w * u`.\n    *   The vector `v₁` is `[r, r, ..., w, ..., r]`. Since `r ≠ w`, `v₁` is not a scalar multiple of the all-ones vector `u`.\n    *   A vector that is a multiple of `u` and a vector that is not are always linearly independent. Therefore, `v₁` and `v₂` are linearly independent.\n    *   Since all rows in the flag's matrix are either of type `v₁` or `v₂`, the entire set of rows is spanned by these two vectors. The dimension of the row space is 2.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Rank of Various Flag Structures\n\nWe now need to find African flags that also have a rank of 2. Let's analyze common flag structures:\n\n*   **Flags with only horizontal stripes:** (e.g., Gabon, Botswana). A flag with `k` horizontal stripes of colors `c₁, c₂, ..., cₖ` will have rows of the form `c₁*u`, `c₂*u`, etc. All these vectors are scalar multiples of the all-ones vector `u`, so they are all linearly dependent on each other. The row space is spanned by the single vector `u`. **The rank of such flags is 1.**\n\n*   **Flags with only vertical stripes:** (e.g., Nigeria, Ivory Coast). A flag with `k` vertical stripes of colors `c₁, c₂, ..., cₖ` will have every single row being identical, with the pattern `[c₁, ..., c₁, c₂, ..., c₂, ..., cₖ]`. Since all rows are identical, the row space is spanned by this single vector. **The rank of such flags is 1.**\n\n*   **Flags with complex symbols:** (e.g., a star, shield, or complex emblem like on the flags of Morocco, Somalia, or Egypt). A symbol with a complex shape will create many different row patterns as you move vertically across it. For example, a row crossing the tip of a star is different from a row crossing the wide middle part. These different row patterns are typically linearly independent of each other and of the background rows. **The rank of such flags is almost always 3 or greater.**\n\n### Step 3: Identify African Flags with Rank 2\n\nWe are looking for a flag structure that generates exactly two linearly independent row patterns. The \"L-shaped\" block design fits this criterion. This design consists of a vertical bar of one color next to a field of horizontal stripes.\n\nLet's analyze flags with this structure:\n\n1.  **Flag of Benin:** This flag has a vertical green bar on the left and two horizontal bars (yellow over red) on the right.\n    *   **Row Patterns:**\n        *   Rows in the top half have the pattern `v₁ = [g, g, ..., g, y, y, ..., y]`.\n        *   Rows in the bottom half have the pattern `v₂ = [g, g, ..., g, r, r, ..., r]`.\n    *   **Rank Analysis:** These two row patterns, `v₁` and `v₂`, are the only ones in the flag. They are not scalar multiples of each other (since `y ≠ r`). They are linearly independent. Therefore, **the rank of the flag of Benin is 2.**\n\n2.  **Flag of Madagascar:** This flag has a vertical white bar on the left and two horizontal bars (red over green) on the right.\n    *   **Row Patterns:**\n        *   Top half: `v₁ = [w, w, ..., w, r, r, ..., r]`\n        *   Bottom half: `v₂ = [w, w, ..., w, g, g, ..., g]`\n    *   **Rank Analysis:** Similar to Benin, these two row patterns are linearly independent. **The rank of the flag of Madagascar is 2.**\n\n3.  **Flag of Guinea-Bissau:** This flag has a red vertical bar (charged with a black star) on the left and two horizontal bars (yellow over green) on the right.\n    *   **Row Patterns:** The black star only appears on the red vertical bar.\n        *   Top half, through the star: `v₁ = [k, k, ..., k, y, y, ..., y]` (where k=black)\n        *   Top half, above/below the star: `v₂ = [r, r, ..., r, y, y, ..., y]`\n        *   Bottom half, through the star: `v₃ = [k, k, ..., k, g, g, ..., g]`\n        *   Bottom half, above/below the star: `v₄ = [r, r, ..., r, g, g, ..., g]`\n    *   **Rank Analysis:** Let's define two basis vectors: `b₁` for the vertical column (a vector with 1s in the left part and 0s elsewhere) and `b₂` for the horizontal part (a vector with 0s in the left part and 1s elsewhere).\n        *   `v₁ = k*b₁ + y*b₂`\n        *   `v₂ = r*b₁ + y*b₂`\n        *   `v₃ = k*b₁ + g*b₂`\n        *   `v₄ = r*b₁ + g*b₂`\n    *   All four row patterns are linear combinations of the two basis vectors `b₁` and `b₂`. Since `b₁` and `b₂` are linearly independent, the space spanned by all possible rows has a dimension of 2. **The rank of the flag of Guinea-Bissau is 2.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe flags of African nations that have the same rank (Rank 2) as the flag of Denmark are those with the specific \"L-shaped\" block design.\n\n<<<The flags of Benin, Madagascar, and Guinea-Bissau.>>>"
