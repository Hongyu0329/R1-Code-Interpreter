    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics of Surface Code Encoding:**\n    *   The surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code. Logical qubits are encoded in the non-local, topological properties of a 2D lattice of physical qubits.\n    *   The number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is laid out. This topology is defined by its genus (number of \"handles,\" like in a donut) and the number of boundaries or holes.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Rule for a Single Patch:**\n    *   A \"patch\" of surface code is a finite section of the 2D lattice, which is topologically equivalent to a disk. A simple patch without any holes has a single boundary (the outer edge).\n    *   A simple patch with no holes cannot stably encode a logical qubit. It has 0 logical qubits.\n    *   When we introduce \"holes\" into the patch, we create new boundaries. A hole is created by deactivating a region of qubits inside the patch.\n    *   For a single patch of surface code (which is planar, i.e., has a genus of 0), the number of logical qubits it can encode is equal to the number of holes (`n`) it contains.\n    *   **Rule:** For one patch, `Number of logical qubits = Number of holes`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the System Described in the Question:**\n    *   The system consists of **two separate patches** of surface code. Since they are separate, they are not connected.\n    *   The system has a **total of two holes**.\n    *   The total number of logical qubits in the entire system is the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n\n4.  **Consider All Possible Configurations:**\n    The two holes can be distributed between the two patches in the following ways:\n\n    *   **Configuration A: Both holes are in the first patch.**\n        *   Patch 1: Has 2 holes. According to the rule, it encodes `2` logical qubits.\n        *   Patch 2: Has 0 holes. It encodes `0` logical qubits.\n        *   **Total logical qubits = 2 + 0 = 2**.\n\n    *   **Configuration B: One hole is in the first patch, and one hole is in the second patch.**\n        *   Patch 1: Has 1 hole. It encodes `1` logical qubit.\n        *   Patch 2: Has 1 hole. It encodes `1` logical qubit.\n        *   **Total logical qubits = 1 + 1 = 2**.\n\n    *   **Configuration C: Both holes are in the second patch.**\n        *   Patch 1: Has 0 holes. It encodes `0` logical qubits.\n        *   Patch 2: Has 2 holes. It encodes `2` logical qubits.\n        *   **Total logical qubits = 0 + 2 = 2**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Maximum Number:**\n    *   We are asked for the *maximum* number of logical qubits possible.\n    *   By analyzing all possible configurations, we see that the total number of logical qubits is always 2, regardless of how the holes are distributed.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits is 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Patches vs. Torus:** It is important not to confuse a patch of surface code with a toroidal surface code. A patch is planar (like a sheet of paper), while a torus is a continuous surface with no boundaries (like a donut). A single torus with no holes or boundaries encodes 2 logical qubits. The question specifically mentions \"patches,\" implying planar surfaces.\n*   **Logical Qubits are Additive:** For disconnected components (separate patches), the total capacity for storing logical qubits is the sum of the capacities of the individual components.\n*   **The Role of Holes:** In a planar code, holes are essential for encoding logical qubits. Each hole introduces a new non-trivial loop around which a logical operator can be defined, allowing for the storage of one logical qubit. The total number of logical qubits is simply the total number of holes across all patches.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe total number of logical qubits that can be encoded is determined by the total number of holes. Since there are two separate patches and a total of two holes, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the holes in each patch. As `(holes in patch 1) + (holes in patch 2) = 2`, the total number of logical qubits is always 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
