    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Matrix and the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the determinant of a specific matrix, which is denoted as A.\nThe matrix is given as:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe goal is to compute \\( \\det(A) \\).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Contextual Information**\nThe question mentions this matrix is the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". While this information provides the origin and significance of the matrix in a specific area of mathematics (cluster algebras and number theory), the problem explicitly defines the matrix A. Therefore, the calculation depends only on the entries of A, and we do not need to delve into the theory of Markov quivers to solve the problem. The core task is a matrix determinant calculation.\n\n**Step 3: Choose a Method for Calculating the Determinant**\nThere are several standard methods to compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n1.  The formula for 3x3 determinants (Cofactor Expansion).\n2.  The Sarrus's Rule.\n3.  Using row or column operations to simplify the matrix.\n4.  Observing properties of the matrix.\n\nWe can use any of these methods. Using multiple methods is a good way to verify the result.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation**\n\n**Method 1: Cofactor Expansion**\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\( M = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\) is \\( \\det(M) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\).\nApplying this to matrix A:\n*   \\( a = 2, b = -1, c = -1 \\)\n*   \\( d = -1, e = 2, f = -1 \\)\n*   \\( g = -1, h = -1, i = 2 \\)\n\n\\( \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\det \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} \\)\n\nFirst, calculate the determinants of the 2x2 sub-matrices:\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the main formula:\n\\( \\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3) \\)\n\\( \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 \\)\n\\( \\det(A) = 0 \\)\n\n**Method 2: Sarrus's Rule**\nThis rule involves summing the products of the forward diagonals and subtracting the sum of the products of the backward diagonals.\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\begin{matrix}\n2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 \\\\\n-1 & -1\n\\end{matrix}\n\\]\n*   Sum of products of forward diagonals:\n    \\( (2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2) + ((-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1)) + ((-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1)) = 8 - 1 - 1 = 6 \\)\n*   Sum of products of backward diagonals:\n    \\( ((-1) \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-1)) + ((-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 2) + (2 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1)) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\)\n*   Determinant = (Forward Sum) - (Backward Sum):\n    \\( \\det(A) = 6 - 6 = 0 \\)\n\n**Method 3: Matrix Properties (Careful Observation)**\nA key property of a matrix is that if its rows (or columns) are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero. A simple way to check for linear dependence is to see if one row can be written as a combination of others.\nLet's examine the sum of the columns (or rows, since the matrix is symmetric).\n*   Sum of elements in Row 1: \\( 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0 \\)\n*   Sum of elements in Row 2: \\( -1 + 2 + (-1) = 0 \\)\n*   Sum of elements in Row 3: \\( -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0 \\)\n\nSince the sum of the elements in each row is 0, this means the vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) is a non-zero solution to the equation \\( A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0} \\), because:\n\\[\nA\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix} 2(1) - 1(1) - 1(1) \\\\ -1(1) + 2(1) - 1(1) \\\\ -1(1) - 1(1) + 2(1) \\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nA matrix having a non-trivial null space (i.e., a non-zero solution to \\( A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0} \\)) is, by definition, a singular matrix. A fundamental property of singular matrices is that their determinant is 0. This is the quickest and most elegant way to find the answer.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Isolate the core task:** The problem is a straightforward determinant calculation, despite the advanced mathematical context provided.\n2.  **Arithmetic precision:** Be meticulous with signs and multiplication, especially in methods 1 and 2.\n3.  **Look for matrix properties:** Before diving into calculation, check for simple properties like zero rows/columns, identical rows/columns, or linear dependence. In this case, observing that the row sums are all zero immediately tells us the determinant is 0.\n4.  **Verification:** Using more than one method confirms the correctness of the result. All three methods used here yield the same answer.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, all methods confirm that the determinant of the matrix A is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
