    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication of two Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrices.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the HSS Tree Structure\n\nThe problem specifies a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree with a depth of 4. This tree dictates how the matrix is partitioned.\n\n*   A tree of depth `d` has `d+1` levels, which we can label from 0 (the root) to `d` (the leaves).\n*   In our case, `d=4`, so the levels are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n*   The number of nodes at level `l` in a full binary tree is `2^l`.\n\nLet's count the number of nodes at each level and the total number of nodes:\n*   Level 0 (root): `2^0 = 1` node\n*   Level 1: `2^1 = 2` nodes\n*   Level 2: `2^2 = 4` nodes\n*   Level 3: `2^3 = 8` nodes\n*   Level 4 (leaves): `2^4 = 16` nodes\n\nThe total number of nodes in the tree is `1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31`.\nThe nodes that are not leaves are called internal nodes. These are the nodes at levels 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n*   Number of internal nodes = `1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15`.\n*   Number of leaf nodes = `16`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Submatrices in a Single HSS Representation\n\nAn HSS matrix is not stored as a single large matrix. Instead, it is represented by a collection of smaller submatrices, defined by the tree structure. A standard HSS representation consists of the following components:\n\n1.  **Diagonal Leaf Blocks (`D` matrices):** At the lowest level of the hierarchy (the leaves), the corresponding diagonal blocks of the matrix are stored as dense submatrices.\n    *   There is one such `D` matrix for each leaf node.\n    *   Number of `D` matrices = Number of leaves = **16**.\n\n2.  **Basis Generators (`U` and `V` matrices):** For each node in the tree, we store basis matrices `U_i` and `V_i`. These matrices form compact bases for the row and column spaces of the submatrix corresponding to that node, which are used to represent its interaction with other nodes (specifically its sibling).\n    *   There is one `U` matrix and one `V` matrix for each node in the tree.\n    *   Number of `U` matrices = Total number of nodes = **31**.\n    *   Number of `V` matrices = Total number of nodes = **31**.\n\n3.  **Coupling Matrices (`B` matrices):** For each internal node, which parents a pair of sibling nodes, we store coupling matrices (`B_{ij}` and `B_{ji}`). These small matrices represent the interaction between the two sibling blocks.\n    *   The number of sibling pairs is equal to the number of internal (parent) nodes.\n    *   For each of the 15 internal nodes, there are 2 coupling matrices.\n    *   Number of `B` matrices = Number of internal nodes * 2 = 15 * 2 = **30**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Submatrices for One HSS Matrix\n\nTo find the total number of submatrices that represent a single HSS matrix, we sum the counts from Step 2.\n*   Total submatrices = (Number of `D` matrices) + (Number of `U` matrices) + (Number of `V` matrices) + (Number of `B` matrices)\n*   Total submatrices = 16 + 31 + 31 + 30 = **108**.\n\nSo, a single HSS matrix defined by a depth-4 tree is represented by 108 distinct submatrices.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Submatrices Accessed During Multiplication\n\nThe question asks for the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication, for example, `C = A * B`, where both `A` and `B` are HSS matrices with the same tree structure.\n\n*   The algorithm to compute the HSS representation of the product `C` requires the full HSS representations of both input matrices, `A` and `B`.\n*   This means all the component submatrices of `A` must be accessed, and all the component submatrices of `B` must be accessed.\n\nTherefore, the total number of accessed submatrices is the sum of the submatrices in `A` and `B`.\n*   Submatrices from `A`: 108\n*   Submatrices from `B`: 108\n*   Total accessed submatrices = 108 + 108 = **216**.\n\n<<<216>>>"
