    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe quote \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and the author's name, Andrei Voznesensky, point to a specific work of literature. These words are from Voznesensky's famous rock opera, \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This immediately narrows down the subject to a character from this story.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of \"Juno and Avos\".**\nThe central figure of the rock opera is the Russian Chamberlain, diplomat, and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. He led an expedition for the Russian-American Company and is famous for his voyage to Spanish California.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe question \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" is also from \"Juno and Avos\". This line reflects a real historical mystery. Nikolai Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 on his journey back to St. Petersburg. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the historical facts with the clues.**\n*   **The Lost Grave:** The Voskresensky Cathedral was demolished by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s, and the cemetery was destroyed along with it. As a result, the exact location of Rezanov's grave was lost for many decades. This aligns perfectly with Voznesensky's poetic question about the missing grave.\n\n*   **The Discovery:** The final clue states that the answer to the question about his grave emerged in the late 1980s. This is the crucial piece of information to confirm the identity. Indeed, during the period of Perestroika in the late 1980s, archaeological work and new construction in Krasnoyarsk on the site of the former cathedral led to the rediscovery of what is believed to be Rezanov's burial site. This event brought a resolution to the long-standing question, fitting the timeline provided in the question.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the information to find the final answer.**\nAll clues point to one person:\n1.  He was the subject of Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos\".\n2.  His grave was lost for a long time.\n3.  His presumed grave was rediscovered in the late 1980s.\n\nThis man is Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
