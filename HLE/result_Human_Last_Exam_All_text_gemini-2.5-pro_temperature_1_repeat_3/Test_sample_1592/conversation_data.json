    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\n*   Waskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec, Canada.\n*   Its geographical position is on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. The approximate coordinates are 51.2° N latitude and 78.8° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\n*   To the west of Waskaganish, across James Bay and the land border, is the province of **Ontario**.\n*   To the north and northwest of Waskaganish are the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay, which belong to the territory of **Nunavut**.\n*   To the east is the province of **Newfoundland and Labrador**.\n*   Far to the south and southeast is the province of **New Brunswick**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Proximity to Each Neighbor**\n*   **Ontario:** The border between Quebec and Ontario runs north-south, meeting the coast of James Bay just a short distance west of Waskaganish. The land border starts at a latitude slightly north of Waskaganish. The distance from Waskaganish to the Ontario border is the shortest of all its neighbors. Visually on a map, it's clear the border is very close, approximately 50-60 kilometers to the west.\n*   **Nunavut:** The closest parts of Nunavut to Waskaganish are the islands within James Bay, such as Charlton Island and Akimiski Island. These islands are located to the northwest of Waskaganish. The distance to the nearest of these islands (Charlton Island) is approximately 100 kilometers. The Nunavut mainland is significantly farther north.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** The border with Labrador is located on the far eastern side of Quebec. Waskaganish is on the western side of the province, meaning the distance to the Labrador border is several hundred kilometers.\n*   **New Brunswick:** This province lies far to the southeast of Waskaganish and is not a contender for the closest.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\n*   Distance to Ontario: Approximately 50-60 km.\n*   Distance to Nunavut (nearest island): Approximately 100 km.\n*   Distance to Newfoundland and Labrador: Over 500 km.\n\nBy comparing these approximate distances, it is evident that the province of Ontario is the closest administrative division to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to know that Waskaganish is in Quebec and the question asks for the closest province or territory *outside* of Quebec.\n*   One must consider all parts of a province or territory, including islands. In this case, Nunavut's islands in James Bay are closer than its mainland, but still not as close as the Ontario border.\n*   The proximity must be measured from Waskaganish itself, which is located on the western side of Quebec, making its western neighbor (Ontario) a strong candidate.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
