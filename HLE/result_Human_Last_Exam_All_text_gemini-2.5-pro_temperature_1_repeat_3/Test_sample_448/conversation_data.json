    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are a group of chemical elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n*(Note: Oganesson (Og) is also a noble gas, but it is a purely synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth, so it is not considered in this analysis.)*\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we must consider the total abundance of each gas across the entire Earth, including the atmosphere, oceans, crust, and mantle. The year 2002 is specified, but the relative natural abundances of these elements do not change significantly on such a short timescale, so we can use generally accepted modern abundance data.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundances of Stable Noble Gases**\nFirst, let's consider the stable (non-radioactive or very long-lived) noble gases. Their primary reservoir on Earth is the atmosphere. Their approximate atmospheric abundances are:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** ~0.934% (or 9,340 parts per million, ppm). It is the most abundant noble gas, mostly produced by the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** ~5.2 ppm. While it is light and escapes to space, it is constantly replenished by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the crust.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion, ppb).\n\nFrom this list, Xenon is clearly the rarest of the stable noble gases.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Abundance of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is fundamentally different from the other noble gases because it is highly radioactive. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Source:** Radon is not a primordial element from the Earth's formation. Instead, it is continuously generated as part of the natural radioactive decay chain of uranium and thorium, which are present in trace amounts in rocks and soil.\n*   **Decay:** Because it decays so quickly, it cannot accumulate in the atmosphere or crust over geological time. The total amount of radon present on Earth at any single moment is the result of a steady-state equilibrium between its constant rate of formation and its constant rate of decay.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Rarest Stable Gas (Xenon) with Radon**\nTo find the rarest overall, we must compare the total amount of Xenon to the total amount of Radon.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** As a stable gas, its total quantity on Earth is fixed and substantial. The total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere alone is estimated to be about 1.8 x 10^14 kg.\n*   **Radon (Rn):** Due to its extremely short half-life, the total steady-state amount of Radon on the entire planet at any given time is incredibly small. Estimates place the total mass of Radon in the entire atmosphere at around 6.5 x 10^7 kg. Even including the radon temporarily present in the crust and oceans, the total amount is minuscule.\n\nComparing the two, the mass of Xenon (1.8 x 10^14 kg) is millions of times greater than the mass of Radon (~6.5 x 10^7 kg). Therefore, the concentration of Radon in all terrestrial matter is vastly lower than that of Xenon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWhile Xenon is the rarest *stable* noble gas, the radioactive nature and extremely short half-life of Radon mean its steady-state quantity on Earth is many orders of magnitude smaller. This makes Radon the rarest of all naturally occurring noble gases on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
