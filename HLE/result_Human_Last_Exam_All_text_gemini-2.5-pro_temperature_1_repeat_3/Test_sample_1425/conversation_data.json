    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Grand Canonical Partition Function**\nThe grand canonical ensemble describes an open system that can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir at a fixed temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$. The partition function, $Z$, for such a system is given by the trace over the system's Hilbert space:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N})})$\nwhere:\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature ($k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant).\n*   $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the Hamiltonian operator for the system.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\nThe operator $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N}$ is often called the grand canonical Hamiltonian.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Hamiltonian Given in the Question**\nThe question states that the system has a Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. A careful reading implies that this is the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian, so we set $\\hat{H}_{sys} = \\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Full Operator for the Partition Function**\nWe substitute the given system Hamiltonian into the general formula for the grand canonical partition function:\n$\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N} = (-\\mu \\hat{N}) - \\mu \\hat{N} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$\nThus, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu \\hat{N})}) = \\text{Tr}(e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}})$\n\n**Step 4: Express the Operator in Second Quantization for the Path Integral**\nThe particle number operator $\\hat{N}$ can be written as a sum over all single-particle states (indexed by $k$, e.g., momentum states):\n$\\hat{N} = \\sum_k \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$\nwhere $\\hat{a}_k^\\dagger$ and $\\hat{a}_k$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a particle in state $k$. These operators can be for either bosons or fermions.\nThe operator in the exponent is therefore:\n$\\hat{K} = -2\\mu \\sum_k \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k = \\sum_k (-2\\mu) \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the Action for the Path Integral**\nThe path integral representation of the partition function is $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\text{fields}] e^{-S}$, where $S$ is the Euclidean action. For a system of non-interacting particles with a grand canonical Hamiltonian of the form $\\hat{K} = \\sum_k \\epsilon'_k \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$, the action is:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\phi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon'_k) \\phi_k(\\tau)$\nHere, $\\phi_k(\\tau)$ represents the field associated with state $k$ (a complex field for bosons, a Grassmann field for fermions).\n\nFrom our operator in Step 4, we can identify the effective single-particle energy as $\\epsilon'_k = -2\\mu$ for all states $k$.\nSo, the action for our system is:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\phi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\phi_k(\\tau)$\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the Path Integral**\nThis is a standard Gaussian path integral. The calculation involves transforming to Matsubara frequency space and performing the integral for each mode $(k, \\omega_n)$ independently. The final result of this standard calculation depends on the statistics of the particles.\n\nThe path integral for an action of the form $S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\phi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + E_k) \\phi_k(\\tau)$ yields:\n*   For bosons: $Z_B = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta E_k}}$\n*   For fermions: $Z_F = \\prod_k (1 + e^{-\\beta E_k})$\n\nIn our case, the effective energy in the action is $E_k = -2\\mu$.\n\n**Step 7: Acquire the Final Answer**\nBy substituting $E_k = -2\\mu$ into the general results, we get the partition function for the system. Since the problem does not specify the particle statistics, we must provide the answer for both cases.\n\n*   **For a system of Bosons:**\n    $Z_B = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)}} = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n    (This result is physically meaningful only if $2\\beta\\mu < 0$, or $\\mu < 0$, for the geometric series to converge).\n\n*   **For a system of Fermions:**\n    $Z_F = \\prod_k (1 + e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)}) = \\prod_k (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n\nThe product $\\prod_k$ is over all possible single-particle quantum states of the system.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Hamiltonian\"**: The primary point of ambiguity is whether the given $\\hat{H}=-\\mu\\hat{N}$ is the system Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ or the full grand canonical operator $\\hat{K}$. The phrasing \"Hamiltonian H for a system\" strongly suggests it is $\\hat{H}_{sys}$, which is the interpretation used here.\n2.  **Particle Statistics**: The path integral formalism and the final result are different for bosons and fermions due to their different quantum statistics (leading to different boundary conditions in imaginary time and different occupation numbers). The answer must be given for both cases.\n3.  **Role of Path Integrals**: While the problem can be solved more directly using the operator trace method, the request specifies using path integrals. The logic above follows the path integral formulation by identifying the correct action and using the standard result for its evaluation. The result is identical to the trace method, providing a consistency check.\n4.  **Index k**: The product is over all single-particle states $k$. This could be, for example, momentum states for particles in a box, or any other complete set of single-particle states.\n\nThe final answer combines the results for both bosonic and fermionic systems.\n\n<<<\nThe partition function Z depends on the statistics of the particles. The symbol $k$ represents the index over all single-particle states.\n\nFor a system of **bosons**:\n$Z = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\nFor a system of **fermions**:\n$Z = \\prod_k (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n>>>"
