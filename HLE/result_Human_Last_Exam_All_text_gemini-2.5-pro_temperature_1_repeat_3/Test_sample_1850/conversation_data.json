    "This question requires a careful reading of John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost* to identify all the historical, revered biblical figures (saints, in the broad Protestant sense) who are explicitly mentioned by name.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number:\n\n**Step 1: Define the terms**\n*   **\"Historical Saint\"**: In the context of Milton, a 17th-century Protestant, this term does not refer to saints canonized by the Catholic Church. Instead, it encompasses any revered holy person from the Old or New Testament who is part of the historical narrative of faith. This includes patriarchs, prophets, and righteous leaders. We must exclude divine beings (like Jesus, who is God the Son) and celestial beings (like angels). We also exclude figures who are named but are presented as unrighteous (e.g., Cain, Saul).\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: The individual must be explicitly named in the text, not merely alluded to. For example, \"a Virgin\" is an allusion to Mary, but she is not mentioned by the name \"Mary.\"\n\n**Step 2: Systematically search the text of *Paradise Lost***\nThe most likely places to find such names are in the speeches of God the Father (Book III) and in the historical overview given to Adam by the Archangel Michael (Books XI and XII).\n\n**Book III:**\n*   In God the Father's speech about the covenant of grace, he mentions two figures by name:\n    1.  **David**: \"...my Covenant I have swore to David...\" (III.321)\n    2.  **Moses**: \"...the Law of GOD to men deliver'd, who / By Moses he of old to ISRAEL gave...\" (III.345-346)\n\n**Books IV-X:**\nThese books primarily concern the events in Paradise, the war in Heaven, and the immediate aftermath of the Fall. A search reveals no named historical saints in these sections.\n\n**Book XI:**\nMichael begins showing Adam visions of the future.\n*   3.  **Abel**: Michael shows Cain's murder of his brother and mentions \"...the blood of righteous Abel...\" (XI.455)\n*   4.  **Enoch**: Describing the righteous man who escaped death, Michael names \"...Enoch, and his years were three / Hundred and sixty five...\" (XI.669-671)\n*   5.  **Noah**: After the vision of the flood, Michael points out the patriarch emerging from the Ark: \"...from his Arke / The Haire of Noah comes...\" (XI.860-861)\n\n**Book XII:**\nMichael continues the history of salvation in narrative form. This book contains the highest concentration of names.\n*   6.  **Abraham**: Michael names the father of the faithful: \"Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call...\" (XII.151)\n*   7.  **Joseph**: The story of the Israelites in Egypt is introduced by referencing the king \"Who knew not Joseph...\" (XII.167)\n*   8.  **Aaron**: When describing the establishment of the priesthood, Michael says Moses is bid to \"...call thy Brother Aaron, and him / His Priest anoints...\" (XII.239-240)\n*   9.  **Joshua**: The successor to Moses is named: \"his name / Joshua? whom the Gentiles Jesus call...\" (XII.310-311)\n*   10. **Solomon**: Following David, his son is named as the builder of the Temple: \"...and by his Son / Solomon, who shall build his temple...\" (XII.345-346)\n*   11. **Melchizedek**: When explaining the priesthood of Christ, Michael references the ancient king-priest: \"...a more perfect Priest arise...after the order / Of Melchisedec.\" (XII.258-260)\n\n**Step 3: Final Tally and Review**\nLet's compile the final list of named historical saints:\n1.  David\n2.  Moses\n3.  Abel\n4.  Enoch\n5.  Noah\n6.  Abraham\n7.  Joseph\n8.  Aaron\n9.  Joshua\n10. Solomon\n11. Melchizedek\n\n**Careful Points and Exclusions:**\n*   **Adam and Eve**: While they are historical and achieve a state of grace through repentance, they are the central protagonists of the poem, not figures \"mentioned\" in the way of a historical list. They are the subject of the narrative, not examples within it.\n*   **Jesus**: Mentioned by name, but as God the Son (a divine being), he is not categorized as a \"saint.\"\n*   **Mary**: Alluded to as \"a Virgin,\" but never named.\n*   **New Testament Apostles (Peter, Paul, etc.)**: They are referred to as a group (\"his Saints,\" \"the twelve\") but not individually named.\n*   **Saul**: Named in Book XII, but presented as a flawed king, not as a saint.\n*   **Isaac and Jacob**: Alluded to as Abraham's \"Son\" and \"Grandson,\" but not explicitly named.\n\nBased on a careful analysis of the text and definitions, there are 11 historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost*.\n\n<<<11>>>"
