    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of K.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Tensor\nThe problem defines a function from $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$, which can be viewed as a 3-tensor $T_n$ in the space $W \\otimes W \\otimes W$, where $W = V^{\\otimes n}$ is the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. The dimension of $W$ is $2^n$.\n\nThe function is given by:\n$T_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$\nwhere $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$, and $x_i, y_i, z_i$ are their components.\n\nThis tensor can be decomposed into two parts:\n1.  The product part: $S_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$.\n2.  The constant part: $J_n(x, y, z) = 1$ for all $x, y, z$.\n\nSo, $T_n = S_n - J_n$.\n\nThe product structure of $S_n$ indicates that it is an $n$-th tensor power of a base tensor. Let $V$ be the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. This is a 2-dimensional complex vector space. Let $A$ be a tensor in $V \\otimes V \\otimes V$ defined by:\n$A(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$ for $x_1, y_1, z_1 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThen $S_n = A^{\\otimes n}$.\n\nThe tensor $J_n$ is the all-ones tensor. It can be written as $u \\otimes u \\otimes u$, where $u$ is the constant function $u(x)=1$ for all $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$. Thus, $J_n$ is a rank-1 tensor, and its slice rank is 1.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the Slice Rank of $T_n$ to the Slice Rank of $A^{\\otimes n}$\nThe slice rank, denoted $\\text{sR}(\\cdot)$, satisfies the triangle inequality: $\\text{sR}(T_1 + T_2) \\le \\text{sR}(T_1) + \\text{sR}(T_2)$.\nTherefore, we can bound the slice rank of $T_n$:\n$\\text{sR}(S_n) - \\text{sR}(J_n) \\le \\text{sR}(T_n) \\le \\text{sR}(S_n) + \\text{sR}(J_n)$\n$\\text{sR}(A^{\\otimes n}) - 1 \\le \\text{sR}(T_n) \\le \\text{sR}(A^{\\otimes n}) + 1$.\n\nThe problem states that $\\text{sR}(T_n) = (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The $e^{o(n)}$ term accounts for sub-exponential factors, so the base of the exponential growth is $3/2^K$.\nFrom the bounds above, $\\text{sR}(T_n)$ and $\\text{sR}(A^{\\otimes n})$ have the same exponential growth rate. This rate is captured by the asymptotic slice rank.\nThe asymptotic slice rank of $A$ is defined as $\\text{sR}_{\\infty}(A) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (\\text{sR}(A^{\\otimes n}))^{1/n}$.\nFrom the given formula, we have $\\text{sR}_{\\infty}(A) = 3/2^K$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Asymptotic Slice Rank of A\nTo find the value of $\\text{sR}_{\\infty}(A)$, we can bound $\\text{sR}(A^{\\otimes n})$.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nThe slice rank of any tensor $T$ is greater than or equal to the rank of any of its matrix flattenings. Let's flatten $A$ by grouping the first two indices. The resulting matrix $F(A)$ is a $4 \\times 2$ matrix.\nThe slices of $A$ according to the third index $k \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ are:\n-   $k=0$: $A_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n-   $k=1$: $A_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe flattening is $F(A) = \\begin{pmatrix} A_0 \\\\ A_1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a $4 \\times 2$ matrix. Its rank is 2.\nDue to the symmetry of $A$, all its flattenings have rank 2.\nThe flattening of the tensor power $A^{\\otimes n}$ is the tensor power of the flattening of $A$: $F(A^{\\otimes n}) = F(A)^{\\otimes n}$.\nThe rank is multiplicative under the tensor product: $\\text{rank}(M_1 \\otimes M_2) = \\text{rank}(M_1) \\text{rank}(M_2)$.\nSo, $\\text{rank}(F(A^{\\otimes n})) = (\\text{rank}(F(A)))^n = 2^n$.\nThis gives a lower bound on the slice rank: $\\text{sR}(A^{\\otimes n}) \\ge \\text{rank}(F(A^{\\otimes n})) = 2^n$.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nThe slice rank is sub-multiplicative under the tensor product: $\\text{sR}(T_1 \\otimes T_2) \\le \\text{sR}(T_1) \\text{sR}(T_2)$.\nThis implies $\\text{sR}(A^{\\otimes n}) \\le (\\text{sR}(A))^n$.\nLet's calculate the slice rank of the base tensor $A$. A tensor has slice rank at most $r$ if it can be written as a sum of $r$ \"slices\". We can write $A$ as a sum of two slices along the third dimension:\n$A = e_0 \\otimes A_0 + e_1 \\otimes A_1$, where $e_0=(1,0)$ and $e_1=(0,1)$ are basis vectors.\nThis shows that $\\text{sR}(A) \\le 2$.\nSince we already have a lower bound of 2 from the flattening rank, we can conclude that $\\text{sR}(A) = 2$.\nThe upper bound is therefore $\\text{sR}(A^{\\otimes n}) \\le (\\text{sR}(A))^n = 2^n$.\n\n**Conclusion on Asymptotic Slice Rank:**\nWe have established the bounds $2^n \\le \\text{sR}(A^{\\otimes n}) \\le 2^n$. This forces the slice rank to be exactly:\n$\\text{sR}(A^{\\otimes n}) = 2^n$.\nNow we can compute the asymptotic slice rank:\n$\\text{sR}_{\\infty}(A) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (2^n)^{1/n} = 2$.\n\n### Step 4: Solving for K\nWe have two expressions for the asymptotic slice rank of $A$:\n1.  From the problem statement: $\\text{sR}_{\\infty}(A) = 3/2^K$.\n2.  From our calculation: $\\text{sR}_{\\infty}(A) = 2$.\n\nEquating these two expressions gives:\n$3/2^K = 2$\n$3 = 2 \\cdot 2^K$\n$3 = 2^{K+1}$\nTaking the logarithm base 2 on both sides:\n$\\log_2(3) = K+1$\n$K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log_b(x) - \\log_b(y) = \\log_b(x/y)$:\n$K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\nA careful point to consider is whether \"slice rank\" might be a typo for \"tensor rank\". If it were tensor rank, the rank of $A$ is 3, leading to $\\text{rank}(A^{\\otimes n}) = 3^n$. Equating $3 = 3/2^K$ would yield $K=0$. However, we must follow the problem statement as written. The term \"slice rank\" has a precise definition and has been the subject of intense research, and its properties lead to the result above."
