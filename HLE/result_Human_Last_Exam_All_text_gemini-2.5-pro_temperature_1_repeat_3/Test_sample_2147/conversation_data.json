    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the term \"X-Y\" that Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian figure, denounced as a \"stagnant swamp\". The question provides several key pieces of context:\n*   **Subject:** Pavel Milyukov.\n*   **Action:** He frequently accused and denounced something.\n*   **Object of Criticism:** A part of the \"Western culture of his time\".\n*   **Specific Quote:** He called this thing a \"stagnant swamp\".\n*   **Format:** The target is represented as \"X-Y\", suggesting a two-part name, possibly hyphenated or a compound term.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Subject, Pavel Milyukov**\nTo understand his criticisms, we need to know who he was. Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943) was a leading Russian historian, liberal politician, and the founder of the Constitutional Democratic party (Kadets). As a historian and thinker, he was a firm believer in rationalism, positivism, and the idea of historical progress. He saw culture's role as contributing to social and political advancement. His worldview was shaped by 19th-century liberal and scientific ideals.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Context of \"Western Culture of his Time\"**\nMilyukov's most active intellectual period was the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This era in European and Russian culture was marked by the rise of Modernism, a radical break from the traditions of Realism and classicism. Key movements within Modernism included Symbolism and Decadence. These movements often emphasized subjectivity, mysticism, pessimism, individualism, and \"art for art's sake,\" ideas that were directly opposed to Milyukov's positivist and socially-oriented worldview.\n\n**Step 4: Connect Milyukov's Views to the Cultural Movements**\nGiven Milyukov's belief in rational progress and socially useful art, he was naturally a staunch opponent of Modernist trends. He saw movements like Symbolism and Decadence as signs of cultural decay and irrationality. To him, they were not contributing to the progressive development of society but were instead self-indulgent, morbid, and detached from reality.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Specific Term \"X-Y\" and the Quote**\nResearch into Milyukov's cultural criticism, particularly in his influential work \"Ocherki po istorii russkoi kul'tury\" (Outlines of Russian Culture), confirms his disdain for these new artistic movements. He famously grouped the two major related movements together in his condemnations. He viewed the work of the **Symbolists-Decadents** as being precisely this kind of unhealthy, pessimistic, and unproductive cultural phenomenon. The description \"stagnant swamp\" perfectly captures his view of these movements as being unproductive, murky, and representing a dead end for cultural development, rather than a flowing river of progress.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nThe term \"X-Y\" refers to the two intertwined artistic and literary movements that Milyukov saw as a single negative trend. Based on his known writings and criticisms, \"X\" stands for Symbolists and \"Y\" stands for Decadents.\n\n<<<Symbolists-Decadents>>>"
