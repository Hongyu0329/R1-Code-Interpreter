    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided code.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to calculate the final value of a variable `x`, which starts at 0, after executing a series of `n` statements.\n2.  **Variable:** There is only one variable, named `x`. Its initial value is 0.\n3.  **Operations:** There are two operations:\n    *   `++`: Increases `x` by 1.\n    *   `--`: Decreases `x` by 1.\n4.  **Statements:** A statement consists of one operation (`++` or `--`) and the variable `X`. The order of the operation and the variable can be swapped. This means there are four possible valid statements:\n    *   `++X` (Increment)\n    *   `X++` (Increment)\n    *   `--X` (Decrement)\n    *   `X--` (Decrement)\n5.  **Input:** The first line of input is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 150), representing the number of statements. The next `n` lines each contain one of the four possible statements.\n6.  **Output:** A single integer representing the final value of `x`.\n\n### Analysis of the Submitted Java Program\n\n1.  **Code Logic:** The program initializes a result variable `tresult` to 0. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times (where `t` is the number of statements). Inside the loop, it reads a statement as a string.\n2.  **Conditional Checks:** It uses two separate `if` conditions to check the content of the input string:\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"++X\"))`: If the string contains `++X`, it increments `tresult`.\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"--X\"))`: If the string contains `--X`, it decrements `tresult`.\n3.  **Flaw Identification:** The program's logic is flawed and therefore **incorrect**. It only checks for the prefix versions of the operations (`++X` and `--X`). It completely ignores the postfix versions (`X++` and `X--`). If the input program contains statements like `X++` or `X--`, the Java program will not modify the result, leading to a wrong final answer.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nSince the provided program is incorrect, we must determine the parameters for an efficient and correct C program. The answer format required is `Nx+y`.\n\n**1. Is the program correct?**\nNo. As explained above, it fails to handle two of the four valid statement types (`X++` and `X--`).\n\n**2. Designing the Most Efficient C Solution**\n\n*   **Logic:** To correctly solve the problem, we must handle all four cases. The most efficient way to distinguish between an increment and a decrement operation is to look for a unique character.\n    *   `++X`\n    *   `X++`\n    *   `--X`\n    *   `X--`\n    Notice that the character at the middle position (index 1) of the 3-character string is always `+` for an increment operation and `-` for a decrement operation. This provides a simple and fast check. We only need to read the statement and inspect its middle character.\n\n*   **Calculating `x` (Smallest number of character comparisons for n=100):**\n    *   Using the logic above, for each of the 100 statements, we only need to perform one character comparison (e.g., `if (statement[1] == '+')`).\n    *   Total comparisons for 100 statements = 1 comparison/statement * 100 statements = 100 comparisons.\n    *   This is the theoretical minimum, as we must inspect at least one character of each statement to determine the operation.\n    *   Therefore, **x = 100**.\n\n*   **Calculating `y` (Smallest memory size in Bytes):**\n    *   To write the most memory-efficient C program, we need to minimize the number and size of variables declared on the stack.\n    *   We need a variable to hold the final result: `int x;` (typically 4 bytes).\n    *   We need to read the number of statements, `n`, and loop that many times. We can use a single variable for this: `int n;` (typically 4 bytes), which can also be used as the loop counter (e.g., `while (n--)`).\n    *   To check the operation, we don't need to store the whole 3-character string. We only need the middle character. We can achieve this by reading character by character using `getchar()`.\n        *   Read and discard the first character.\n        *   Read the second (middle) character into a variable: `char op;` (1 byte).\n        *   Read and discard the third character and the newline.\n    *   The minimum set of variables required is: `int n`, `int x`, `char op`.\n    *   Total minimum memory size = `sizeof(int)` + `sizeof(int)` + `sizeof(char)` = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 bytes.\n    *   Therefore, **y = 9**.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\n*   The program is incorrect, so the answer starts with **N**.\n*   The smallest number of character comparisons `x` is **100**.\n*   The smallest memory size `y` is **9** B.\n*   Combining these into the format `Nx+y` gives `N100+9`.\n\n<<<N100+9>>>"
