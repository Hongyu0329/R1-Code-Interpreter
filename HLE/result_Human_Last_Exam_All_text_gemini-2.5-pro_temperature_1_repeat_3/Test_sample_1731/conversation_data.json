    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons).\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the System and Theoretical Framework**\n\n*   **System**: We are considering a gas of light quanta (photons) in thermal equilibrium at a temperature `T` inside a volume `V`. Photons are bosons. A key property of a photon gas in equilibrium (like in a black-body cavity) is that the number of photons is not conserved. They are constantly emitted and absorbed by the walls of the container.\n*   **Theoretical Framework**: The question asks to use the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems.\n    *   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem Connection**: In statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state of an isolated system corresponds to the macrostate with the maximum number of accessible microstates (maximum multiplicity `Ω`). The entropy is given by Boltzmann's formula, `S = k_B log Ω`. Maximizing entropy to find the equilibrium distribution is a direct application of the principle of large deviations. The probability of observing a macrostate (i.e., an empirical distribution of particles over energy levels) that is not the maximum entropy state is exponentially small for a large number of particles. This is precisely what Sanov's theorem describes, with the rate function being related to the entropy difference from the maximum (or the KL-divergence from the equilibrium distribution).\n    *   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem Connection**: This theorem describes the probabilities of large deviations of the sample mean. Its mathematical structure involves a Legendre-Fenchel transform between a rate function and a cumulant generating function. This same mathematical structure is fundamental to thermodynamics, connecting thermodynamic potentials like free energy (`F`), internal energy (`U`), and entropy (`S`). For instance, entropy and energy are Legendre transforms of the free energy. We will see this structure when we use the partition function (which is a generating function for energy) to derive `U` and `S`.\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Equilibrium Distribution via Entropy Maximization**\n\nThe core of the method is to find the distribution of particles among energy levels, `{n_i}`, that maximizes the entropy subject to the system's constraints.\n\n1.  **Entropy of a Bose Gas**: For bosons, the number of ways to distribute `n_i` indistinguishable particles into `g_i` degenerate states at energy level `ε_i` is `Ω_i = (n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! (g_i - 1)!)`. The total multiplicity is `Ω = Π_i Ω_i`, and the entropy is `S = k_B log Ω`. Using Stirling's approximation (`log n! ≈ n log n - n`) for large `n_i` and `g_i`, the entropy becomes:\n    `S = k_B Σ_i [ (n_i + g_i) log(n_i + g_i) - n_i log n_i - g_i log g_i ]`\n\n2.  **Constraints**:\n    *   The total energy of the system is fixed at a value `U`: `Σ_i n_i ε_i = U`.\n    *   The total number of particles `N = Σ_i n_i` is **not conserved** for photons. This means there is no Lagrange multiplier for particle number conservation, which is equivalent to setting the chemical potential `μ` to zero.\n\n3.  **Maximization**: We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize `S` subject to the energy constraint. We want to maximize `f({n_i}) = S/k_B - β(Σ_i n_i ε_i - U)`. Setting the derivative with respect to `n_j` to zero:\n    `∂f/∂n_j = ∂(S/k_B)/∂n_j - β ε_j = 0`\n    `∂/∂n_j [ (n_j + g_j) log(n_j + g_j) - n_j log n_j ] = log(n_j + g_j) - log(n_j) = log(1 + g_j/n_j)`\n    So, `log(1 + g_j/n_j) = β ε_j`.\n    Solving for `n_j/g_j`, which is the average occupation number per state at energy `ε_j`, denoted `<n(ε_j)>`:\n    `1 + g_j/n_j = e^{β ε_j}`\n    `g_j/n_j = e^{β ε_j} - 1`\n    `<n(ε_j)> = n_j/g_j = 1 / (e^{β ε_j} - 1)`\n    This is the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for particles with zero chemical potential. The Lagrange multiplier `β` is identified as the inverse temperature, `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**\n\nTo calculate the total energy, we must sum the energy of all occupied states. We convert the sum over states `i` to an integral over energy `ε` by introducing the density of states `g(ε)`.\n\n1.  **Density of States for Photons**: For a relativistic, massless particle in a 3D box of volume `V`, including two polarization states, the number of states between energy `ε` and `ε+dε` is:\n    `g(ε)dε = (V / (π^2 ħ^3 c^3)) ε^2 dε`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n2.  **Energy Integral**: The mean energy `U` is given by:\n    `U = ∫_0^∞ ε * <n(ε)> * g(ε) dε`\n    `U = ∫_0^∞ ε * (1 / (e^{βε} - 1)) * (V / (π^2 ħ^3 c^3)) ε^2 dε`\n    `U = (V / (π^2 ħ^3 c^3)) ∫_0^∞ ε^3 / (e^{βε} - 1) dε`\n\n3.  **Solving the Integral**: We use the substitution `x = β ε`, so `ε = x/β` and `dε = dx/β`.\n    `U = (V / (π^2 ħ^3 c^3)) * (1/β^4) ∫_0^∞ x^3 / (e^x - 1) dx`\n    The definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function: `∫_0^∞ x^3 / (e^x - 1) dx = Γ(4)ζ(4) = 3! * (π^4/90) = 6 * (π^4/90) = π^4 / 15`.\n\n4.  **Final Expression for Energy**: Substituting the value of the integral and `β = 1/(k_B T)`:\n    `U = (V / (π^2 ħ^3 c^3)) * (k_B T)^4 * (π^4 / 15)`\n    `U(T, V) = (π^2 V k_B^4 / (15 ħ^3 c^3)) T^4`\n    This is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nWe can calculate the entropy either by integrating the entropy formula or by using a fundamental thermodynamic relation. The latter is more direct.\n\n1.  **Thermodynamic Relation**: For a system with chemical potential `μ=0`, the Gibbs free energy `G = U - TS + PV = μN` is zero. Therefore, `U - TS + PV = 0`. For a photon gas, the pressure is related to the energy density `u = U/V` by `P = u/3 = U/(3V)`.\n    Substituting the pressure:\n    `U - TS + (U/(3V)) * V = 0`\n    `U - TS + U/3 = 0`\n    `(4/3)U = TS`\n    `S = 4U / (3T)`\n\n2.  **Final Expression for Entropy**: Substitute the expression for `U` found in the previous step:\n    `S = (4 / (3T)) * [ (π^2 V k_B^4 / (15 ħ^3 c^3)) T^4 ]`\n    `S(T, V) = (4π^2 V k_B^4 / (45 ħ^3 c^3)) T^3`\n    This is the equilibrium entropy of the photon gas.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas (the Bose case of light quanta) are given by the following expressions:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n    `U(T, V) = (π^2 V k_B^4 / (15 ħ^3 c^3)) T^4`\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n    `S(T, V) = (4π^2 V k_B^4 / (45 ħ^3 c^3)) T^3`\n\nwhere `V` is the volume, `T` is the absolute temperature, `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: U = (π^2 V k_B^4 / (15 ħ^3 c^3)) T^4\nEquilibrium Entropy: S = (4π^2 V k_B^4 / (45 ħ^3 c^3)) T^3\n>>>"
