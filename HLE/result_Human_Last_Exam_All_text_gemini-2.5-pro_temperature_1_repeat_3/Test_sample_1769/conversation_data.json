    "This is a fascinating question that delves into the alternative history of the English language. To answer it, we need to trace the etymology of the word \"sister\" and determine how it would have evolved without a key historical influence.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Modern English word \"sister\".**\n    The modern word \"sister\" is not a direct descendant of the original Old English word. It is, in fact, a borrowing from Old Norse, the language of the Vikings who invaded and settled in large parts of England (the Danelaw) from the 8th to the 11th centuries. The Old Norse word was *systir*.\n\n2.  **Identify the original Old English word.**\n    Before the Norse influence became dominant, the Anglo-Saxons had their own native word for \"sister.\" This word was **sweostor**. Both the Old English *sweostor* and the Old Norse *systir* come from the same ancient root, the Proto-Germanic word **\\*swestēr*. This is why they are so similar, which made it easy for the Norse version to be adopted.\n\n3.  **Determine the path of the native word without Norse influence.**\n    If the Norse had never invaded, the Old Norse word *systir* would not have entered the English vocabulary. Instead, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have continued its natural evolution into Middle and then Modern English. We can trace this hypothetical evolution by looking at how other Old English words with similar sounds changed over time, and by looking at historical evidence.\n\n4.  **Trace the evolution from Old English to Middle English.**\n    The word *sweostor* is well-documented. During the Middle English period, it began to change. The initial \"sweo-\" sound was simplified, and the unstressed vowel in the second syllable was reduced. This process is confirmed by attested forms in Middle English manuscripts, which show the word evolving into **suster**. This form, *suster*, is the direct, native descendant of Old English *sweostor*. For a time, *suster* and the Norse-influenced *sister* existed side-by-side, but *sister* eventually won out.\n\n5.  **Project the Middle English form into Modern English.**\n    Our final step is to determine what the Middle English word *suster* would have become in Modern English. We must consider the major sound changes that occurred, most notably the Great Vowel Shift and the subsequent \"foot-strut split.\"\n    *   The vowel in *suster* was a short /u/ (pronounced like the \"u\" in \"put\").\n    *   In the transition to Modern English, this short /u/ sound in most environments changed to /ʌ/ (the sound in words like \"strut,\" \"cup,\" or \"son\").\n    *   We can see this exact change in other words that evolved from Middle English to Modern English, such as *sunne* -> \"sun,\" or *butere* -> \"butter.\"\n    *   Therefore, the pronunciation of *suster* would have evolved from /ˈsustər/ to /ˈsʌstər/.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWithout the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have evolved into the Middle English *suster*. Following the regular patterns of English sound change, this word would have come into Modern English with its vowel shifted.\n\n**Careful points considered:**\n*   The distinction between a loanword and a native word. \"Sister\" is a Norse loanword.\n*   The identification of the correct native Old English ancestor: *sweostor*.\n*   The use of attested Middle English forms (*suster*) as evidence for the word's natural development, rather than pure speculation.\n*   The application of known phonological rules (the foot-strut split) to project the Middle English form into a plausible Modern English equivalent.\n*   Comparison with the evolution of similar words (like \"butter\" or \"sun\") to confirm the projected sound change.\n\nThe final word would most likely be spelled the same as its Middle English form, but pronounced differently.\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
