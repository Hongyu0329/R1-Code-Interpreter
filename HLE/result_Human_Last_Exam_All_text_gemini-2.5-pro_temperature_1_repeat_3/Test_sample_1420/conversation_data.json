    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Theoretical Framework:** The question is posed in the context of the renormalization group (RG) and specifically asks for the use of the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. This is a powerful technique developed by Wilson and Fisher to calculate critical exponents in dimensions below the upper critical dimension.\n\n2.  **Determine the Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** The epsilon expansion is performed around the upper critical dimension, d_c, which is the dimension above which mean-field theory provides the correct critical exponents. For systems in the Ising universality class (which is the standard case for such questions unless specified otherwise), described by the φ⁴ field theory, the upper critical dimension is **d_c = 4**.\n\n3.  **Define the Expansion Parameter (ϵ):** The epsilon expansion treats the deviation from the upper critical dimension as a small parameter. This parameter is defined as:\n    ϵ = d_c - d\n    Given that the spatial dimension of interest is d = 3, we have:\n    ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1\n\n4.  **Recall the Formula for the Specific Heat Exponent (α):** In the ϵ expansion, the critical exponents are expressed as a power series in ϵ. To first order in ϵ, the formula for the specific heat exponent α is given by:\n    α = (4 - n) / (2(n + 8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ²)\n    Here, 'n' is the number of components of the order parameter.\n\n5.  **Identify the Number of Components (n):** The question does not specify a particular model like XY or Heisenberg, so we assume the simplest and most common case: the Ising universality class. In the Ising model, the order parameter (magnetization) is a scalar, meaning it has only one component. Therefore:\n    **n = 1**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Value of α:** Now we substitute the values of n=1 and ϵ=1 into the first-order formula.\n    *   First, let's find the general expression for α for n=1:\n        α = (4 - 1) / (2(1 + 8)) * ϵ\n        α = 3 / (2 * 9) * ϵ\n        α = 3 / 18 * ϵ\n        α = ϵ / 6\n    *   Next, we substitute the value ϵ = 1 for the d=3 case:\n        α = 1 / 6\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Nature of the ϵ-Expansion:** The ϵ-expansion is formally an asymptotic series that is rigorously valid only for infinitesimal ϵ. Applying it to the physical case of d=3 requires setting ϵ=1, which is not a small parameter. Despite this, the expansion often yields surprisingly accurate results even to first order.\n2.  **Order of the Calculation:** This calculation is performed to the *first order* in ϵ. Higher-order terms (O(ϵ²), O(ϵ³), etc.) exist and would provide a more refined, albeit much more complex, result. For most standard textbook and exam problems, the first-order result is what is expected.\n3.  **Universality:** The result α = 1/6 is specific to the Ising (n=1) universality class. For other systems, such as the XY model (n=2) or the Heisenberg model (n=3), the value of 'n' would be different, leading to a different result for α. For instance, for n=2, α = 2/(2*10)ϵ = ϵ/10. For n=4, α=0 to first order.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe specific heat exponent α for a system in the Ising universality class (n=1) at spatial dimension d=3 is calculated using the ϵ = 4 - d expansion. To first order in ϵ, the exponent is α = ϵ/6. Since d=3, we have ϵ = 1, which gives α = 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
