    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the specific musical piece and section.**\nThe question asks about the ending of Antonín Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4. We need to examine the score for the very end of the fourth and final movement (Allegro con fuoco).\n\n**Step 2: Locate the relevant instrument's part.**\nWe must find the part for the first violins (Violino I). In a full orchestral score, this part is typically located at the top of the woodwind section.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the final measures for the first violin.**\nLooking at the score, the symphony concludes with powerful, definitive chords in the key of B Major. To find the last three notes played by the first violin, we must examine the last two measures.\n*   **Final Measure:** The first violins play a single, sustained whole note. In the treble clef, this note is a B (specifically B4, the note on the middle line of the staff).\n*   **Penultimate Measure (the measure before the last):** In this measure, the first violins play two eighth notes followed by rests. These two notes lead directly into the final B. The notes are G# followed by A.\n\n**Step 4: List the last three notes in chronological order.**\nBased on the analysis in Step 3, the last three notes played in sequence by the first violin are:\n1.  G#\n2.  A\n3.  B\n\n**Step 5: Determine the lowest note among the three.**\nWe now compare the pitches of the three notes: G#, A, and B. In the standard musical scale, G# is the lowest, followed by A, and then B.\n\nTherefore, the lowest of the last three notes is G#.\n\n<<<G#>>>"
