    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Coiled-Coil Motif:** Coiled-coils are protein structures formed by two or more alpha-helices wrapping around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a **heptad repeat**, denoted by the letters `abcdefg`.\n    *   The residues at the `a` and `d` positions are typically hydrophobic. They form the core of the structure where the helices pack against each other.\n    *   The residues at the `e` and `g` positions are often polar or charged and form electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) that stabilize the inter-helical interface.\n    *   The residues at the `b`, `c`, and `f` positions are exposed to the solvent.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Sequence:** The first step is to correctly assign the `abcdefg` pattern to the given sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. We need to find a registration that places hydrophobic residues (like I, L, A, W) at the `a` and `d` positions.\n    *   The sequence appears to consist of four 7-residue repeats, flanked by Glycine residues. Let's focus on the core 28 residues: `EIAQSLK EIAKSLK EIAWSLK EIAQSLK`.\n    *   Let's test possible alignments. A common and successful strategy is to look for a pattern where `a` and `d` are both hydrophobic.\n    *   Consider the alignment starting with `A` at the `d` position:\n        *   Heptad repeat: `abcdefg`\n        *   Position `d` is followed by `e`, `f`, `g`, `a`, `b`, `c`.\n    *   Let's apply this to the sequence, starting from the first `A` at position 4.\n        *   Sequence: `G E I **A** Q S **L** K E I **A** K S **L** K E I **A** **W** S **L** K E I **A** Q S **L** K G`\n        *   Register: `c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b`\n    *   This alignment is chemically sound. Let's extract the residues at the critical `a` and `d` core positions based on this register:\n        *   **`a` positions:** L (pos 7), L (pos 14), L (pos 21), L (pos 28)\n        *   **`d` positions:** A (pos 4), A (pos 11), W (pos 18), A (pos 25)\n\n3.  **Analyze Core Packing (Knobs-into-Holes):** The oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is largely determined by the size of the amino acid side chains at the `a` and `d` positions, which dictates how they can efficiently pack together (the \"knobs-into-holes\" model).\n    *   **Rule for Trimers:** Typically stabilized when the `d` position is occupied by a large hydrophobic residue (like Leucine or Isoleucine) and the `a` position is occupied by a smaller hydrophobic residue (like Alanine or Valine).\n    *   **Rule for Tetramers:** Typically stabilized by the opposite pattern: a large hydrophobic residue at the `a` position (Leu, Ile) and a small hydrophobic residue at the `d` position (Ala, Val).\n    *   **Rule for Dimers:** Often have a more mixed or alternating pattern of large and small residues at both `a` and `d` positions.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rules to the Sequence:**\n    *   Our sequence has **Leucine (L)**, a large residue, consistently at all four `a` positions.\n    *   Our sequence has **Alanine (A)**, a small residue, at three of the four `d` positions. The one exception is a Tryptophan (W), which is very large, but the dominant pattern is set by the Alanines.\n    *   The observed pattern is: **`a` position = Large (L)** and **`d` position = Small (A)**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** This `a=Large, d=Small` pattern is the classic signature for a **tetramer (a 4-helix coiled-coil)**. The bulky Leucine side chains at the `a` positions pack efficiently against each other in the core of a four-helix bundle, while the smaller Alanine side chains at the `d` positions fit neatly into the remaining space at the interface. This packing arrangement is sterically favored over a trimeric or dimeric state.\n\nTherefore, the protein would most likely form a tetramer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
