The edges of the image become progressively smoother. Sharp corners are rounded off, and small, isolated regions of one color shrink and disappear. The process is driven by the local curvature of the edge, with convex boundaries eroding and concave boundaries being filled in. The long-term result is the simplification and smoothing of all boundaries.
