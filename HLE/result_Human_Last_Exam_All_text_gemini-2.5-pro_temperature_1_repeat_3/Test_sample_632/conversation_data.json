    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question focuses on the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome, which is the square directly in front of the Pantheon.\n2.  **Identify the Core Task:** The task is to identify a \"unique architectural feature\" that existed in this square but was removed in 1950.\n3.  **Break Down the Clues:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda / The Pantheon.\n    *   **Object Type:** A \"unique architectural feature.\" This implies it was a built structure, not just a statue or decoration.\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed by the city administration.\"\n    *   **Date:** \"until 1950.\" This date is a crucial piece of information that needs to be verified.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Pantheon vs. The Piazza:** The feature might have been on the Pantheon itself, which dominates the square, or in the piazza. Since the Pantheon is the main architectural element, changes to its facade are the most likely candidates.\n2.  **Verifying the Date:** The year 1950 is very specific. A key part of the analysis is to confirm if a significant removal event happened in that exact year. Historical facts can sometimes be misremembered or misstated in questions.\n3.  **Defining \"Unique Architectural Feature\":** This phrase suggests something notable and perhaps controversial, not a minor or mundane element.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Initial Research:** Research into the architectural history of the Pantheon and its piazza reveals a very famous and controversial addition: a pair of bell towers (or *campanili*) that were added to the front corners of the Pantheon's attic level.\n2.  **Identifying the Feature:** These towers were constructed in the 17th century. While their design is sometimes attributed to Carlo Maderno, they are most famously associated with his successor, the renowned Baroque artist **Gian Lorenzo Bernini**.\n3.  **The \"Unique\" Aspect:** The towers were highly unpopular with the Roman public from the moment they were built. They were considered ugly and completely out of character with the ancient, classical design of the Pantheon. This led to them being given the derogatory nickname **\"le orecchie d'asino\" (the donkey's ears)**. This controversy makes them a very \"unique\" feature in the building's history.\n4.  **Verifying the Removal and Date:** The towers were indeed removed to restore the Pantheon to its perceived original classical state. However, here lies the critical discrepancy. Historical records are clear that the demolition did **not** happen in 1950. It occurred much earlier, between **1883 and 1893**, under the direction of the Minister of Public Education, Guido Baccelli.\n5.  **Conclusion:** There is no record of any other major architectural feature being removed from the piazza or the Pantheon in 1950. It is overwhelmingly likely that the question is referring to the famous \"donkey's ears\" bell towers, but contains an incorrect date. This was the most significant architectural feature ever removed from the Pantheon.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers, nicknamed \"the donkey's ears\""
