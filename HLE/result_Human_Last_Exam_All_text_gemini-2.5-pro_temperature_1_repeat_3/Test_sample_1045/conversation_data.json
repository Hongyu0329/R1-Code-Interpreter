    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecular formula and atom count.**\nThe molecule is toluene, which has the chemical formula C7H8.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a type of Pople split-valence basis set. The notation describes how atomic orbitals (AOs) are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (also called basis functions).\n\n*   **The hyphen (-)** separates the description for core orbitals from valence orbitals.\n*   **The first number (6)**: Describes the core orbitals. Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n*   **The numbers after the hyphen (31)**: Describe the valence orbitals. The valence shell is \"split\" into two sets of basis functions for each valence atomic orbital.\n    *   The '3' means the \"inner\" valence part is represented by one contracted Gaussian function composed of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The '1' means the \"outer\" valence part is represented by one contracted Gaussian function composed of 1 primitive Gaussian.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of contracted functions for each atom type.**\n\n**For a Carbon (C) atom:**\n*   A carbon atom is a second-row element with electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p².\n*   **Core orbital:** 1s.\n*   **Valence orbitals:** 2s and 2p (which consists of 2px, 2py, 2pz).\n*   Let's count the contracted functions:\n    *   **Core (1s):** Represented by 1 contracted function (from the '6' in 6-31G).\n    *   **Inner Valence (2s', 2p'):** One contracted s-function and one set of contracted p-functions (px, py, pz). This gives 1 (s) + 3 (p) = 4 contracted functions (from the '3' in 6-31G).\n    *   **Outer Valence (2s'', 2p''):** Another contracted s-function and another set of contracted p-functions (px, py, pz). This gives 1 (s) + 3 (p) = 4 contracted functions (from the '1' in 6-31G).\n*   **Total per Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions.**\n\n**For a Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   A hydrogen atom is a first-row element with electron configuration 1s¹.\n*   **Core orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons. The 6- prefix does not apply.\n*   **Valence orbital:** 1s.\n*   The description for hydrogen's valence orbital comes from the '31' part of the notation. The 1s orbital is split into two functions:\n    *   **Inner Valence (1s'):** Represented by 1 contracted function (from the '3').\n    *   **Outer Valence (1s''):** Represented by 1 contracted function (from the '1').\n*   **Total per Hydrogen atom = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = 2 contracted functions.**\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for the number of *contracted* Gaussian functions, not the more numerous primitive Gaussian functions they are built from.\n*   **Atom-Specific Interpretation:** The basis set notation is interpreted differently for first-row (H, He) and second-row (Li-Ne) atoms. For H, there are no core orbitals, so the '6-' part is irrelevant.\n*   **P-orbitals:** Remember that a p-shell consists of three individual orbitals (px, py, pz). When a basis set describes a p-function, it implies a set of three functions.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of contracted functions for toluene (C7H8).**\n*   Total functions from Carbon = (Number of C atoms) × (Functions per C atom)\n    *   7 × 9 = 63\n*   Total functions from Hydrogen = (Number of H atoms) × (Functions per H atom)\n    *   8 × 2 = 16\n*   **Total Contracted Gaussian Functions** = (Functions from C) + (Functions from H)\n    *   63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
