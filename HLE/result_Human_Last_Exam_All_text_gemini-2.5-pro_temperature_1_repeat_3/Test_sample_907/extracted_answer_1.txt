The equation for the absorption cross-section, $\sigma(\omega)$, as a function of the laser's carrier frequency $\omega$, is derived from first-order time-dependent perturbation theory. It is proportional to the sum over all possible final states $|f\rangle$ of the transition probability from the initial ground state $|i\rangle$, weighted by the transition energy $\hbar\omega_{fi}$. For a Gaussian pulse of duration $\tau$, the general form is:
$\sigma(\omega) \propto \sum_{f} \omega_{fi} |\langle f | \hat{\epsilon} \cdot \mathbf{d} | i \rangle|^2 e^{-(\omega_{fi}-\omega)^2\tau^2}$
where $\omega_{fi} = (E_f - E_i)/\hbar$ is the transition frequency, $\mathbf{d}$ is the total dipole operator, and $\hat{\epsilon}$ is the laser polarization vector.

**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected.**
The molecules are independent. The excitation of any single molecule requires the same energy, $\hbar\omega_0$. The total cross-section is the sum of the contributions from each of the N molecules.
The equation is:
$\sigma_a(\omega) \propto N \omega_0 |\hat{\epsilon} \cdot \vec{\mu}|^2 e^{-(\omega_0-\omega)^2\tau^2}$
Here, $\vec{\mu}$ is the transition dipole moment of a single molecule. The spectrum consists of a single Gaussian peak.

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered.**
Intermolecular interactions lead to the formation of delocalized exciton states $|k\rangle$, which are the new final states. These states have distinct energies $\hbar\omega_k$ that form an exciton band.
The equation is:
$\sigma_b(\omega) \propto \sum_{k=1}^N \omega_k |\langle k | \hat{\epsilon} \cdot \mathbf{d} | i \rangle|^2 e^{-(\omega_k-\omega)^2\tau^2}$
where the transition dipole moment to an exciton state, $\langle k | \mathbf{d} | i \rangle$, is a coherent sum of the individual molecular dipole moments, weighted by the exciton wavefunction coefficients. This leads to selection rules and a spectrum consisting of multiple Gaussian peaks at the allowed exciton transition frequencies.
