    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the group G\nThe question specifies that $G$ is a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that the group of outer automorphisms of $G$ is trivial. For a group over a finite field, this means that any such group $G$ must be the split Chevalley group of type $E_8$. We denote the group of its $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points as $E_8(q)$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the object to be counted\nWe need to find the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$. A maximal torus $T$ of the algebraic group $G$ is an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational subgroup if it is stable under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ corresponding to the field extension $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}/\\mathbb{F}_q$. We are counting the number of such subgroups $T$ of $G$.\n\n### Step 3: Find the appropriate formula\nThe number of $F$-stable maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ can be calculated using a classical formula due to Steinberg and Lehrer. The formula states that the total number of $F$-stable maximal tori is given by:\n$$ N = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\nwhere $T_0$ is a *minisotropic* maximal torus of $G$. A maximal torus is called minisotropic if it is contained in a Borel subgroup that is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\nSince our group $G$ is the split Chevalley group, it contains a split maximal torus $T_0$ which is contained in a split Borel subgroup $B_0$. A split Borel subgroup is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, so $T_0$ is a minisotropic torus. Therefore, we can apply this formula.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the order of the group G($\\mathbb{F}_q$)\nThe order of a finite group of Lie type, such as $E_8(q)$, is given by the Chevalley formula:\n$$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i} - 1) $$\nFor a group of type $E_8$:\n*   The rank is $r=8$.\n*   The number of positive roots is $N=120$.\n*   The degrees of the fundamental invariants are $d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_8$. For $E_8$, these degrees are 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n$$ |E_8(q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1) $$\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the order of the torus $T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)$\nWe use a split maximal torus $T_0$. A split torus of rank $r$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is isomorphic to the direct product of $r$ copies of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{F}_q^*$.\nFor $E_8$, the rank is $r=8$.\nSo, $T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\cong (\\mathbb{F}_q^*)^8$.\nThe order is:\n$$ |T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^8 $$\n\n### Step 6: Compute the final number\nNow we compute the ratio from Step 3 using the results from Step 4 and Step 5:\n$$ N = \\frac{|E_8(q)|}{|T_0(q)|} = \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8} $$\nThis expression can be written in a more expanded form by using the identity $q^k-1 = (q-1)(1+q+q^2+...+q^{k-1})$:\n$$ N = q^{120} \\left(\\frac{q^2-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^8-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{12}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{14}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{18}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{20}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{24}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{30}-1}{q-1}\\right) $$\n$$ N = q^{120} (q+1)(q^7+q^6+\\dots+1)(q^{11}+\\dots+1)(q^{13}+\\dots+1)(q^{17}+\\dots+1)(q^{19}+\\dots+1)(q^{23}+\\dots+1)(q^{29}+\\dots+1) $$\nThis expression gives the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\n### Careful Points:\n1.  **Nature of the Group:** The assumption that a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is split is crucial and correct.\n2.  **Validity of the Formula:** The formula $N = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|/|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ is a standard result for connected reductive groups and minisotropic tori. While direct summation over torus types can lead to paradoxical results for some small-rank groups if not handled with extreme care (due to subtleties in the structure of normalizers), this geometric formula is considered robust.\n3.  **Data for $E_8$:** The rank, number of positive roots, and degrees of invariants for $E_8$ must be correct. They are standard values from the theory of Lie algebras.\n4.  **Exact Number:** The question asks for an \"exact number\". The final expression is a polynomial in $q$ which gives the exact integer count for any prime power $q$.\n\nThe final answer is the expression for $N$.\n\n<<<q^{120} \\frac{(q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8}>>>"
