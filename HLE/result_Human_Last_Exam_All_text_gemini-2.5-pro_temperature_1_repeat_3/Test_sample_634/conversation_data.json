    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n*   **Right Divisor:** A polynomial matrix R(s) is a right divisor of P(s) if there exists a polynomial matrix Q(s) such that P(s) = Q(s)R(s).\n*   **Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD):** R(s) is a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s) if:\n    a) It is a common right divisor of both P1(s) and P2(s).\n    b) Any other common right divisor R'(s) is a right divisor of R(s) (i.e., R(s) = L(s)R'(s) for some polynomial matrix L(s)).\n*   The GCRD is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant).\n\n**2. Choose a Method: The Euclidean Algorithm for Matrices**\nThe most systematic way to find the GCRD is to use the Euclidean algorithm, which can be implemented by performing elementary row operations on a stacked matrix.\nWe form the matrix M = [P1; P2] and reduce it to the form [R; 0] using row operations. The resulting non-zero matrix R will be a GCRD.\n\n**3. Set up the Matrix**\nLet P1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2] and P2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1].\nForm the stacked matrix M:\nM =\n[ s^2 + s,  -s     ]  (Row 1)\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2    ]  (Row 2)\n[ s,        0      ]  (Row 3)\n[ -s - 1,   1      ]  (Row 4)\n\n**4. Perform Elementary Row Operations**\nThe goal is to use rows with lower-degree polynomials to simplify rows with higher-degree polynomials, aiming to create zero rows.\n\n*   **Step 4.1:** Use Row 3 to simplify Row 1. The leading element of Row 1 is s^2 + s, and for Row 3 it is s. We perform `Row 1 -> Row 1 - (s+1) * Row 3`.\n    New Row 1 = [s^2 + s - (s+1)s, -s - (s+1)*0] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s] = [0, -s].\n\n*   **Step 4.2:** Use Row 3 to simplify Row 2. The leading element of Row 2 is -s^2 - 1. We perform `Row 2 -> Row 2 + s * Row 3`.\n    New Row 2 = [-s^2 - 1 + s*s, s^2 + s*0] = [-1, s^2].\n\nThe matrix is now:\n[ 0,        -s     ]\n[ -1,       s^2    ]\n[ s,        0      ]\n[ -s - 1,   1      ]\n\n*   **Step 4.3:** For easier calculations, swap Row 1 and Row 2 to get a constant pivot (-1) in the top-left position.\n[ -1,       s^2    ]  (New Row 1)\n[ 0,        -s     ]  (New Row 2)\n[ s,        0      ]  (New Row 3)\n[ -s - 1,   1      ]  (New Row 4)\n\n*   **Step 4.4:** Use the new Row 1 to eliminate the first element in Row 3 and Row 4.\n    `Row 3 -> Row 3 + s * Row 1`:\n    New Row 3 = [s + s*(-1), 0 + s*(s^2)] = [0, s^3].\n    `Row 4 -> Row 4 - (s+1) * Row 1`:\n    New Row 4 = [-s-1 - (s+1)(-1), 1 - (s+1)(s^2)] = [-s-1+s+1, 1-s^3-s^2] = [0, 1-s^3-s^2].\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n[ -1,       s^2             ]\n[ 0,        -s              ]\n[ 0,        s^3             ]\n[ 0,        1 - s^3 - s^2   ]\n\n*   **Step 4.5:** Now use the new Row 2 (`[0, -s]`) to simplify Row 3 and Row 4.\n    `Row 3 -> Row 3 + s^2 * Row 2`:\n    New Row 3 = [0, s^3 + s^2*(-s)] = [0, s^3 - s^3] = [0, 0].\n    `Row 4 -> Row 4 - (s^2+s) * Row 2`: (This is from the polynomial division of `1-s^3-s^2` by `-s`, which gives quotient `s^2+s` and remainder `1`).\n    New Row 4 = [0, 1-s^3-s^2 - (s^2+s)(-s)] = [0, 1-s^3-s^2 - (-s^3-s^2)] = [0, 1].\n\nThe matrix is now:\n[ -1, s^2 ]\n[ 0,  -s  ]\n[ 0,  0   ]\n[ 0,  1   ]\n\n*   **Step 4.6:** Use the new Row 4 (`[0, 1]`) to eliminate the second element in the other non-zero rows.\n    `Row 1 -> Row 1 - s^2 * Row 4`:\n    New Row 1 = [-1, s^2 - s^2*1] = [-1, 0].\n    `Row 2 -> Row 2 + s * Row 4`:\n    New Row 2 = [0, -s + s*1] = [0, 0].\n\nThe final matrix, after re-arranging the rows, is:\n[ -1, 0 ]\n[ 0,  1 ]\n[ 0,  0 ]\n[ 0,  0 ]\n\n**5. Identify and Normalize the GCRD**\nThe non-zero part of the reduced matrix is R = [-1, 0; 0, 1]. This is a GCRD of P1 and P2.\nThe determinant of R is `(-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1`, which is a non-zero constant. Therefore, R is a unimodular matrix.\nAny GCRD can be multiplied on the left by a unimodular matrix to get another valid GCRD. A standard practice is to simplify the GCRD to its simplest form. We can multiply R by the unimodular matrix `U = [-1, 0; 0, 1]`:\n`U * R = [-1, 0; 0, 1] * [-1, 0; 0, 1] = [1, 0; 0, 1] = I`\nThe identity matrix `I` is the canonical representation for a unimodular GCRD. When the GCRD is unimodular, the original matrices are said to be **right coprime**.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
