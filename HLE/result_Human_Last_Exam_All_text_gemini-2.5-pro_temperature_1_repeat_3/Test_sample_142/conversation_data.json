    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for the requested calculation.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the System (Molecule and Electrons)\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** The molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. It contains:\n    *   1 Carbon (C) atom\n    *   3 Hydrogen (H) atoms (2 from $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ and 1 from $\\mathrm{HF}$)\n    *   1 Silicon (Si) atom\n    *   1 Fluorine (F) atom\n\n2.  **Calculate the total number of electrons ($N$):** We sum the atomic numbers of all atoms in the molecule.\n    *   Electrons from Carbon (C): 6\n    *   Electrons from Hydrogen (H): $3 \\times 1 = 3$\n    *   Electrons from Silicon (Si): 14\n    *   Electrons from Fluorine (F): 9\n    *   Total electrons, $N = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$.\n\n3.  **Determine the spin state ($S$):** The molecule has an even number of electrons (32). For a stable, closed-shell ground state molecule, the total spin is zero.\n    *   Total spin, $S = 0$ (singlet state).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Orbitals ($K$) from the Basis Set\n\nThe basis set is 6-31G**, which is also known as 6-31G(d,p). We need to find the number of basis functions (which corresponds to the number of spatial orbitals, $K$) for each atom.\n\n**Careful Point:** The `*` notation for polarization functions can be ambiguous. The first `*` adds d-functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. These can be either 5 spherical d-functions or 6 cartesian d-functions. For the final result to be an integer, which it must be, we must use the correct convention. We will find that using 6 cartesian d-functions is necessary.\n\n1.  **Basis functions for Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 6-31G part describes the 1s orbital with a split-valence representation, resulting in 2 basis functions.\n    *   The second `*` (the 'p' in (d,p)) adds one set of p-polarization functions (px, py, pz), which is 3 functions.\n    *   Total for one H atom: $2 (\\text{s}) + 3 (\\text{p}) = 5$ functions.\n\n2.  **Basis functions for Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (2nd-row atoms):**\n    *   The 6-31G part gives 9 functions ([3s, 2p]).\n    *   The first `*` (the 'd' in (d,p)) adds one set of d-polarization functions. We use 6 cartesian d-functions.\n    *   Total for one C or F atom: $9 + 6 (\\text{d}) = 15$ functions.\n\n3.  **Basis functions for Silicon (Si) (3rd-row atom):**\n    *   The 6-31G part gives 13 functions ([4s, 3p]).\n    *   The first `*` adds one set of d-polarization functions (6 cartesian functions).\n    *   Total for one Si atom: $13 + 6 (\\text{d}) = 19$ functions.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of spatial orbitals ($K$):**\n    *   $K = (1 \\times \\text{C}) + (3 \\times \\text{H}) + (1 \\times \\text{Si}) + (1 \\times \\text{F})$\n    *   $K = (1 \\times 15) + (3 \\times 5) + (1 \\times 19) + (1 \\times 15)$\n    *   $K = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Formula for the Number of CSFs\n\nFor a full CI calculation, the number of CSFs is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\frac{2S+1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N/2 - S} \\binom{K+1}{N/2 + S + 1} $$\n\nWe substitute our calculated values:\n*   $N = 32 \\implies N/2 = 16$\n*   $K = 64$\n*   $S = 0$\n\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\frac{2(0)+1}{64+1} \\binom{64+1}{16 - 0} \\binom{64+1}{16 + 0 + 1} $$\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\frac{1}{65} \\binom{65}{16} \\binom{65}{17} $$\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Final Number\n\nWe need to calculate the binomial coefficients and perform the division. This requires high-precision arithmetic due to the large numbers involved.\n\n1.  **Calculate the binomial coefficients:**\n    *   $\\binom{65}{16} = \\frac{65!}{16! \\cdot 49!} = 409,510,515,686,100$\n    *   $\\binom{65}{17} = \\frac{65!}{17! \\cdot 48!} = 11,833,982,042,414,400$\n\n2.  **Multiply the coefficients:**\n    *   $\\binom{65}{16} \\times \\binom{65}{17} = 409,510,515,686,100 \\times 11,833,982,042,414,400$\n    *   Product = $4,846,059,868,770,281,313,386,801,840,000$\n\n3.  **Divide by 65:**\n    *   Number of CSFs = $\\frac{4,846,059,868,770,281,313,386,801,840,000}{65}$\n    *   Number of CSFs = $74,554,767,211,850,481,744,412,336,000$\n\nThis is the total number of singlet CSFs in the full CI calculation.\n\n<<<745547672118504817444123360000>>>"
