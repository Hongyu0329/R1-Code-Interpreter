The proposed approach is not valid. The ecological function of a mimicry syndrome is to present a recognizable warning signal to potential predators. The validity of the mimicry, therefore, depends on the perception of the predator, not a human. The primary predators of bumblebees are birds, which have a different visual system than humans. Most birds have tetrachromatic vision and can see ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Many bumblebee species have color patterns that include UV reflectance. Consequently, two species that appear similar to a human might look very different to a bird (and thus not be mimics in an ecological sense), and vice versa. By using untrained human undergraduates as the judges of similarity, the study is measuring human aesthetic perception, not the functional similarity that constitutes an actual mimicry syndrome in its natural context. The method is fundamentally flawed because it uses the wrong "receiver" for the signal being studied.
