    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and the resulting protein sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The goal is to find the correct reading frame for a given DNA sequence and translate it into a protein. The key piece of information is that the sequence is from the **middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)**.\n\n2.  **Define ORF and Reading Frames:**\n    *   An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). It typically starts with a start codon and ends with a stop codon, but since this sequence is from the middle, we should not expect to see either, especially not a stop codon.\n    *   A DNA sequence can be read in three possible forward reading frames:\n        *   **Frame 1:** Starts at the first nucleotide.\n        *   **Frame 2:** Starts at the second nucleotide.\n        *   **Frame 3:** Starts at the third nucleotide.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Reading Frame:** We will translate the sequence in all three frames and look for the one that is \"open,\" meaning it lacks stop codons.\n\n    **The DNA Sequence:**\n    `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n    **Careful Point:** The length of the sequence is 105 nucleotides.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Frame 1:**\n        *   Grouping into codons (3 nucleotides at a time) starting from the 1st nucleotide:\n          `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt ...`\n        *   Translation:\n          `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n          `cat` -> H (Histidine)\n          `tgt` -> C (Cysteine)\n          `tgt` -> C (Cysteine)\n          `tag` -> **STOP**\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 contains a stop codon (TAG) very early on. This cannot be the correct frame for the middle of an ORF.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Frame 2:**\n        *   Grouping into codons starting from the 2nd nucleotide (the first 'g' is ignored):\n          `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (The final 'c' is an incomplete codon).\n        *   Translation using the standard genetic code:\n          `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n          `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n          `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n          `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n          `agc` -> S (Serine)\n          `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n          `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n          `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n          `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n          `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n          `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n          `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n          `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n          `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n          `tca` -> S (Serine)\n          `agc` -> S (Serine)\n          `tct` -> S (Serine)\n          `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n          `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n          `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n          `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n          `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n          `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n          `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n          `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n          `agt` -> S (Serine)\n          `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n          `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n          `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n          `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n          `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n          `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n          `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n          `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n          `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n        *   **Conclusion:** This frame does not contain any stop codons. It is a continuous stretch of codons for amino acids, which is what we expect for a sequence from the middle of an ORF.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Frame 3:**\n        *   Grouping into codons starting from the 3rd nucleotide (the first 'gg' are ignored):\n          `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg ...`\n        *   Translation:\n          `aca` -> T (Threonine)\n          `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n          `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n          `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n          `gcg` -> A (Alanine)\n          `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n          `act` -> T (Threonine)\n          `tga` -> **STOP**\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 contains a stop codon (TGA). This cannot be the correct frame.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, only Frame 2 yields a continuous protein sequence without stop codons. Therefore, Frame 2 is the correct reading frame. The translated protein sequence from Frame 2 is the final answer.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n**Protein Sequence:** DIVVSENGLTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<DIVVSENGLTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
