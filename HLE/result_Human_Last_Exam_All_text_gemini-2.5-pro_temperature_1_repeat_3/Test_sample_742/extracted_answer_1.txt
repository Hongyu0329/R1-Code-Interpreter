No, it is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics (based on Hilbert spaces, linear operators, and differential equations) is designed to model physical systems and their probabilistic behavior. Gödel's ontological proof is a formal argument in modal logic, a completely different branch of mathematics concerned with concepts like necessity and possibility, based on its own set of philosophical axioms. The core concepts of Gödel's proof, such as "positive property" or "necessary existence," have no definition or counterpart within the customary mathematical language of quantum mechanics. Attempting to use one to prove the other represents a fundamental category error, like trying to use musical notation to prove a theorem in number theory.
