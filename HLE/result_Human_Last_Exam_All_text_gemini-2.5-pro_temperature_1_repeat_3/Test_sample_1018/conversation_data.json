    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to compute the simplicial volume, denoted by $||\\cdot||$, of the manifold $M = \\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$. This manifold is the product of two closed, oriented surfaces: $\\Sigma_{31}$ (genus 31) and $\\Sigma_{17}$ (genus 17).\n\n### **Step 2: Recall the Product Formula for Simplicial Volume**\nThe simplicial volume of a product of two manifolds is related to their individual simplicial volumes. The key theorem we will use is a result by Gromov, with the equality case established by Bucher and Karlson.\n\n*   **Theorem (Product Formula):** Let $X^m$ and $Y^n$ be two closed, oriented, connected hyperbolic manifolds of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively. Then the simplicial volume of their product $X \\times Y$ is given by:\n    $||X \\times Y|| = \\binom{m+n}{m} ||X|| \\cdot ||Y||$\n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Conditions of the Theorem**\nWe need to check if the manifolds $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$ satisfy the conditions of the theorem.\n\n*   **Manifold Properties:** $\\Sigma_g$ is a closed, oriented, connected manifold of dimension 2.\n*   **Hyperbolic Condition:** A manifold is called hyperbolic if it admits a complete Riemannian metric with constant sectional curvature -1. According to the Uniformization Theorem for surfaces, a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ admits a hyperbolic metric if and only if its Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$ is negative.\n*   **Euler Characteristic:** The Euler characteristic of $\\Sigma_g$ is given by $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, we have $g=31$. The Euler characteristic is $\\chi(\\Sigma_{31}) = 2 - 2(31) = 2 - 62 = -60$. Since $\\chi < 0$, $\\Sigma_{31}$ is a hyperbolic manifold. Its dimension is $m=2$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, we have $g=17$. The Euler characteristic is $\\chi(\\Sigma_{17}) = 2 - 2(17) = 2 - 34 = -32$. Since $\\chi < 0$, $\\Sigma_{17}$ is also a hyperbolic manifold. Its dimension is $n=2$.\n\nSince both $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$ are closed, oriented, hyperbolic manifolds, we can apply the product formula with equality.\n\n### **Step 4: Recall the Formula for the Simplicial Volume of a Surface**\nThe simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ is directly related to its Euler characteristic.\n\n*   **Theorem:** For a closed, oriented, connected surface $\\Sigma_g$, its simplicial volume is given by:\n    $||\\Sigma_g|| = \\max(0, -2\\chi(\\Sigma_g))$\n*   **Careful Point:** For $g \\ge 2$, the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$ is negative. The formula then simplifies to:\n    $||\\Sigma_g|| = -2(2-2g) = 4g-4$ for $g \\ge 2$.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Individual Simplicial Volumes**\nUsing the formula from Step 4, we can compute the simplicial volumes for our two surfaces.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{31}$:**\n    Since $g=31 \\ge 2$, we use the simplified formula:\n    $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{17}$:**\n    Since $g=17 \\ge 2$, we use the simplified formula:\n    $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n### **Step 6: Combine Everything to Compute the Final Answer**\nNow we apply the product formula from Step 2 using the values we've calculated.\n\n*   **The manifolds:** $X = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $Y = \\Sigma_{17}$.\n*   **The dimensions:** $m=2$ and $n=2$.\n*   **The binomial coefficient:** $\\binom{m+n}{m} = \\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6$.\n*   **The individual simplicial volumes:** $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 120$ and $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 64$.\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\times ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\times ||\\Sigma_{17}||$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64$\n\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$6 \\times 120 = 720$\n$720 \\times 64 = 46080$\n\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 46080.\n\n<<<46080>>>"
