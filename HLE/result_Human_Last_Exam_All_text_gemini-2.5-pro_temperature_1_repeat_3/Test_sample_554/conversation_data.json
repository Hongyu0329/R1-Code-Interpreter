    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the name \"perfluoronanocar\".**\n\n*   **\"Perfluoro-\"**: This is a standard prefix in organic chemistry nomenclature. It signifies that all hydrogen (H) atoms attached to the carbon skeleton of the parent molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n*   **\"-nanocar\"**: This refers to the parent molecule. We need to identify the chemical structure and, specifically, the number of hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the structure and formula of the parent molecule, the \"nanocar\".**\n\n*   The nanocar is a real molecule designed and synthesized for studies in nanotechnology. It has a structure resembling a macroscopic car.\n*   It consists of a central \"chassis\" and \"axles\" made from a hydrocarbon framework, and four \"wheels\" which are fullerene (C₆₀) molecules.\n*   The chemical modification \"perfluoro-\" applies to the hydrocarbon part of the molecule where carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds exist that can be replaced with carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds. The fullerene wheels do not have hydrogen atoms to be replaced.\n*   By examining the published structure of the most common nanocar, the chassis and axle framework has the chemical formula **C₁₄₆H₉₆**.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the \"perfluoro-\" modification to the nanocar structure.**\n\n*   Following the definition from Step 1, we must replace every hydrogen atom in the parent structure with a fluorine atom.\n*   The parent nanocar's hydrocarbon framework has **96 hydrogen atoms** (H).\n*   Therefore, in a \"perfluoronanocar\", these 96 hydrogen atoms would be substituted with **96 fluorine atoms** (F).\n*   The resulting chemical formula for the perfluorinated chassis and axle framework would be C₁₄₆F₉₆.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the total number of fluorine atoms.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of fluorine atoms in the hypothetical molecule.\n*   Based on the stoichiometric replacement of hydrogen with fluorine, the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Scope of \"Perfluoro-\":** It is crucial to understand that the \"perfluoro-\" prefix applies to the C-H bonds of the hydrocarbon backbone, not the fullerene (C₆₀) wheels, which are composed entirely of carbon atoms.\n2.  **Identifying the Correct Parent Molecule:** There are several variants of nanocars. The analysis relies on the most commonly cited nanocar structure with the C₁₄₆H₉₆ framework.\n3.  **Hypothetical Nature:** The question is hypothetical. It assumes that such a molecule could be synthesized and would be stable. The focus is purely on chemical nomenclature and structure, not on the practical synthesis or properties of the molecule.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Parent Molecule: Nanocar\n2.  Formula of Hydrocarbon Framework: C₁₄₆H₉₆\n3.  Number of Hydrogen Atoms to be Replaced: 96\n4.  Modification: \"Perfluoro-\" means replace all H with F.\n5.  Number of Fluorine Atoms after Replacement: 96\n\nThe perfluoronanocar would contain 96 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<96>>>"
