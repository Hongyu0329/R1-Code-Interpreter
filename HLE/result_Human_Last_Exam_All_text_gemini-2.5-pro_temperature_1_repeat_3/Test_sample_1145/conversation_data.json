    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the probability.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the System and State:**\n    The problem asks for the probability of finding a particle in a specific region within a one-dimensional (1D) box.\n    *   System: Particle in a 1D box of length `a`.\n    *   Quantum State: The particle is in the second energy level, so the principal quantum number is `n = 2`.\n    *   Interval: The region of interest is from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n\n2.  **The Wavefunction and Probability Density:**\n    The normalized wavefunction `ψ_n(x)` for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is given by:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n\n    For the `n = 2` state, the wavefunction is:\n    `ψ₂(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`\n\n    The probability density `P(x)` is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction. It represents the probability per unit length of finding the particle at a position `x`.\n    `P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n\n3.  **Set Up the Probability Integral:**\n    The probability `Prob` of finding the particle in the interval `[x₁, x₂]` is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    `Prob = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx`\n    Substituting the values and the expression for `P(x)`:\n    `Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n4.  **Approximation Method for Calculation:**\n    The interval of interest, `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`, is very small. The interval is centered at `x = 0.5a`. For the `n=2` state, `x = 0.5a` is a node, meaning the probability density `P(0.5a) = 0`.\n    A simple approximation like `Prob ≈ P(0.5a) * Δx` would yield 0, which is incorrect. We must account for the non-zero probability density near the node. We can do this by using a Taylor expansion of the integrand around the center of the interval.\n\n    Let's make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let `y = x - 0.5a`. This centers the interval around `y=0`.\n    *   `x = y + 0.5a`\n    *   `dx = dy`\n    *   New limits: `y₁ = 0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a` and `y₂ = 0.505a - 0.5a = 0.005a`.\n\n    The integrand becomes:\n    `P(y) = (2/a) * sin²(2π(y + 0.5a) / a) = (2/a) * sin²(2πy/a + π)`\n    Using the identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, we have `sin²(θ + π) = sin²(θ)`.\n    `P(y) = (2/a) * sin²(2πy / a)`\n\n    The integral is now:\n    `Prob = ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(2πy / a) dy`\n\n    For the small values of `y` in our interval, the argument of the sine function, `u = 2πy/a`, is also small. We can use the small-angle approximation `sin(u) ≈ u`.\n    `sin²(2πy / a) ≈ (2πy / a)² = (4π²y²) / a²`\n\n    Substituting this approximation into the integral:\n    `Prob ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * [(4π²y²) / a²] dy`\n    `Prob ≈ (8π² / a³) ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] y² dy`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    Now, we evaluate the simple polynomial integral:\n    `∫ y² dy = y³ / 3`\n    `∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] y² dy = [y³/3]` evaluated from `-0.005a` to `0.005a`\n    `= [(0.005a)³ / 3] - [(-0.005a)³ / 3]`\n    `= (1/3) * [(0.005a)³ + (0.005a)³] = (2/3) * (0.005a)³`\n    `= (2/3) * (5 x 10⁻³ a)³ = (2/3) * (125 x 10⁻⁹ a³)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    Substitute the result of the integration back into the expression for `Prob`:\n    `Prob ≈ (8π² / a³) * [(2/3) * (125 x 10⁻⁹ a³)]`\n    The `a³` terms cancel out, as expected for a probability.\n    `Prob ≈ (8π² * 2 * 125 / 3) * 10⁻⁹`\n    `Prob ≈ (2000π² / 3) * 10⁻⁹`\n    `Prob ≈ (2π² / 3) * 10⁻⁶`\n\n    Now, substitute the numerical value for `π² ≈ 9.8696`:\n    `Prob ≈ (2 * 9.8696 / 3) * 10⁻⁶`\n    `Prob ≈ (19.7392 / 3) * 10⁻⁶`\n    `Prob ≈ 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶`\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Correct State:** It is crucial to use `n=2` for the wavefunction, which leads to a node at the center of the box (`x=a/2`).\n*   **Probability Density:** The probability is the integral of the square of the wavefunction `|ψ|²`, not the wavefunction `ψ` itself.\n*   **Approximation at a Node:** When the interval is centered at a node, the approximation `P(center) * Δx` is inadequate. A Taylor expansion of the integrand is necessary for an accurate result.\n*   **Small-Angle Approximation:** The use of `sin(u) ≈ u` is justified because the interval is very small (`1%` of the box length) and centered at a point where the sine function's argument passes through zero.\n*   **Unit Cancellation:** The length of the box `a` should cancel out from the final probability calculation, as probability is a dimensionless quantity. This serves as a good check of the derivation.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
