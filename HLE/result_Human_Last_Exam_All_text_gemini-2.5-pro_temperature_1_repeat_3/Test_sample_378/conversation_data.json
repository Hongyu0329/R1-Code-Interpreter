    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about a specific individual: Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. It asks for the year he publicly identified with the name \"Azikiwe\".\n\n2.  **Verify the Name:** The first crucial step is to verify the full and official name of the person in question. The individual who served as the President of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015 is known as **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Name in the Question:** The name provided, \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" combines the name of President Goodluck Jonathan with the surname of another famous Nigerian leader, **Nnamdi Azikiwe**. Nnamdi Azikiwe was the first President of Nigeria (1963â€“1966) and a prominent nationalist figure.\n\n4.  **Investigate for a Name Change or Connection:** The next step is to search for any credible evidence that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever added \"Azikiwe\" to his name or publicly identified himself with it.\n    *   A review of official records, including his biographies, government websites, publications during his tenure, and major news archives, shows no instance of him using the name \"Azikiwe\" as part of his own.\n    *   His middle name is consistently documented as **Ebele**.\n    *   There is no known familial relationship between Goodluck Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe that would lead to a shared name.\n\n5.  **Address the Premise of the Question:** The question is based on a false premise. It assumes that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" at some point. Since there is no evidence of this event ever happening, it is impossible to provide a year for it. The name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" is a conflation of two distinct Nigerian presidents.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of Names:** Always verify the full, official names of public figures, as inaccuracies can lead to incorrect assumptions.\n*   **Source Credibility:** Rely on official biographies, government sources, and reputable news organizations rather than unverified claims or online rumors.\n*   **Distinguishing Individuals:** The question merges the identities of two separate and very important figures in Nigerian history: Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe. It is essential to distinguish between them.\n*   **The Nature of the \"Identification\":** The question asks when he \"publicly identified\" himself as such. This would be a significant event, likely involving a formal announcement or consistent use of the name, none of which occurred.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, there is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\". The name is not part of his official name, and he has never adopted it. Therefore, the event described in the question never occurred.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. This event never occurred.>>>"
