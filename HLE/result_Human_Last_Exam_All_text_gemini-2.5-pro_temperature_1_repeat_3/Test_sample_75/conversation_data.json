    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Second Great War\"**: In StarCraft lore, this term refers to the series of interconnected conflicts that take place during the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, *Legacy of the Void*) and its epilogue (*Into the Void*). The primary antagonist of this war is the fallen Xel'naga, Amon.\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date**: The Second Great War begins with the start of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official timeline, this occurs in the year **2504**. This is four years after the end of the Brood War. The inciting incident is the renewed Zerg invasion of Dominion space, orchestrated by Amon's forces.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date**: The war concludes with the final and permanent destruction of Amon by the united forces of the Terran, Zerg, and Protoss. This event takes place in the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue, \"Into the Void\". The official timeline places this concluding event in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration**:\n    *   The war starts in the year 2504.\n    *   The war ends in the year 2506.\n    *   This means the conflict was active during three separate calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n\n5.  **Estimate the Elapsed Time**: While exact dates are not provided, we can analyze the timeline of the campaigns to estimate the total duration.\n    *   The war starts at some point in 2504 (*Wings of Liberty*).\n    *   It continues through the entirety of 2505 (during which the events of *Heart of the Swarm* and the beginning of *Legacy of the Void* occur).\n    *   It ends at some point in 2506 (the conclusion of *Legacy of the Void* and the epilogue).\n    *   The duration can be expressed as: (a portion of the year 2504) + (the full year of 2505) + (a portion of the year 2506).\n    *   The minimum possible duration for an event spanning three calendar years is just over one year (e.g., starting December 31, 2504, and ending January 1, 2506). However, the sheer scale of the campaigns—involving extensive interstellar travel, planetary campaigns, and major military buildups—makes such a short duration highly improbable.\n    *   A more realistic estimate, considering the events, places the total duration at over two full years. For instance, the events of *Wings of Liberty* and *Heart of the Swarm* likely span over a year combined, and the subsequent war against Amon in *Legacy of the Void* takes at least another year. This results in a total elapsed time greater than two years (e.g., 2 years and several months).\n\n6.  **Apply the \"Rounded Up\" Rule**: The question requires the final answer to be \"in years, rounded up\". This means we must take our calculated duration and round it up to the next whole number.\n    *   Since our analysis concludes the duration is a value greater than 2.0 years (e.g., approximately 2.1 to 2.5 years), rounding this value *up* results in 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of the War**: It's crucial to correctly identify the \"Second Great War\" as the entire *StarCraft II* saga against Amon, not just one of the expansion packs.\n*   **Official Timeline**: The start and end years (2504-2506) are based on the canonical lore established by Blizzard Entertainment.\n*   **The \"Rounded Up\" Clause**: This is the most important instruction. A simple approximation of \"about 2 years\" would be insufficient. A duration of 2.01 years, when rounded up, becomes 3. Given the war spans three calendar years and involves massive campaigns, a duration of more than exactly two years is the most logical conclusion.\n*   **Distinction from Calendar Years Spanned**: The war spanned three calendar years, but this does not automatically mean it lasted three full years. However, in this case, the estimated duration does cross the 2-year threshold, making the rounded-up result 3.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  **Start:** 2504\n2.  **End:** 2506\n3.  **Estimated Duration:** Greater than 2 years.\n4.  **Rounding Up:** `ceil(>2.0)` = 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
