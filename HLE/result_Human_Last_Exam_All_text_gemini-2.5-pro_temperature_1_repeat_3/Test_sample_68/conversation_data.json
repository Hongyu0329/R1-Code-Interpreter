    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure that allows for the coloring of a figure-eight knot.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Knot Coloring\n\nThe type of coloring referred to in the question is a specific mathematical concept known as **Fox n-coloring**. To color a knot diagram, we assign an integer (a \"color\") to each arc of the knot. The coloring must adhere to the following rules:\n\n1.  **The Coloring Rule:** At every crossing, if the over-arc has color `y`, and the two under-arcs have colors `x` and `z`, then the colors must satisfy the congruence `2y ≡ x + z (mod n)`. Here, `n` is the number of colors available, which are typically the integers {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}.\n2.  **The Non-Triviality Rule:** At least two different colors must be used in the coloring of the entire knot. A coloring that uses only one color is called a \"trivial coloring\" and is always possible for any `n`; we are interested in non-trivial colorings.\n\nThe set of `n` colors, along with the operation defined by the coloring rule (which can be written as `z = 2y - x (mod n)`), forms an algebraic structure known as a **quandle**. The question asks for the size of the smallest such structure, which is equivalent to finding the smallest integer `n > 1` for which the figure-eight knot can be non-trivially colored.\n\n### Step 2: Relating Colorability to a Knot Invariant\n\nA fundamental theorem in knot theory states that a knot is non-trivially *n*-colorable if and only if `n` is a divisor of the **determinant** of the knot. The determinant is a numerical knot invariant. Therefore, our task is to find the determinant of the figure-eight knot and then find its smallest divisor greater than 1.\n\n### Step 3: Setting up the Equations for the Figure-Eight Knot\n\nTo find the determinant, we first need to draw the figure-eight knot (also known as knot 4₁, as it's the only knot with 4 crossings) and label its arcs and crossings.\n\nLet's label the four arcs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. We can then write an equation for each of the four crossings based on the coloring rule `2 * (over-arc) ≡ (under-arc 1) + (under-arc 2)`.\n\nA standard diagram of the figure-eight knot gives the following relationships:\n1.  Crossing 1: Arc `a` is over arcs `b` and `c`.  Equation: `2a ≡ b + c`\n2.  Crossing 2: Arc `c` is over arcs `a` and `d`.  Equation: `2c ≡ a + d`\n3.  Crossing 3: Arc `d` is over arcs `a` and `b`.  Equation: `2d ≡ a + b`\n4.  Crossing 4: Arc `b` is over arcs `c` and `d`.  Equation: `2b ≡ c + d`\n\nWe can rearrange these into a system of homogeneous linear equations (mod n):\n1.  `2a - b - c + 0d ≡ 0`\n2.  `-a + 0b + 2c - d ≡ 0`\n3.  `-a - b + 0c + 2d ≡ 0`\n4.  `0a + 2b - c - d ≡ 0`\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Knot Determinant\n\nThe determinant of the knot is the absolute value of the determinant of any submatrix formed by removing one row and one column from the coefficient matrix of this system.\n\nThe coefficient matrix `M` is:\n```\n[[ 2, -1, -1,  0],\n [-1,  0,  2, -1],\n [-1, -1,  0,  2],\n [ 0,  2, -1, -1]]\n```\n\nLet's find the determinant by removing the first row and first column. The resulting 3x3 submatrix `M'` is:\n```\n[[ 0,  2, -1],\n [-1,  0,  2],\n [ 2, -1, -1]]\n```\n\nNow, we calculate the determinant of `M'`:\n`det(M') = 0 * (0*(-1) - 2*(-1)) - 2 * ((-1)*(-1) - 2*2) + (-1) * ((-1)*(-1) - 0*2)`\n`det(M') = 0 - 2 * (1 - 4) - 1 * (1 - 0)`\n`det(M') = -2 * (-3) - 1`\n`det(M') = 6 - 1 = 5`\n\nThe determinant of the figure-eight knot is `|det(M')| = 5`.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Smallest Number of Colors\n\nAccording to the theorem, the figure-eight knot is *n*-colorable if and only if `n` divides its determinant, which is 5.\n\nThe divisors of 5 are 1 and 5.\n*   `n=1` would mean using only one color, which is a trivial coloring and thus disallowed by our non-triviality rule.\n*   `n=5` is the smallest integer greater than 1 that divides the determinant.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of colors needed for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot is 5. This means the smallest algebraic structure (quandle) that can be used to color the knot has 5 elements.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe smallest number of elements in the algebraic structure is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
