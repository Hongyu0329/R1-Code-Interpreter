Based on its role in promoting a less-differentiated, persistent, and highly proliferative memory T cell phenotype, interleukin-15 would be predicted to **increase** the overall cytokine release (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α) from CAR T cells upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. This is because the IL-15 conditioned cells can mount a more robust and sustained effector response, resulting in a larger population of cytokine-secreting cells.
