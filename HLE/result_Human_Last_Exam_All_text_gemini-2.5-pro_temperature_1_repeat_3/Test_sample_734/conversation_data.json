    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **Who?** A \"Christian theologian\". This points to a major figure in the history of Christian thought.\n2.  **What did they do?** They \"first developed specialized terminology\". This means we are looking for the originator or primary systematizer of a specific set of concepts or words.\n3.  **What does the terminology describe?** It describes \"changes in the laws of nature\". This involves the relationship between God's power and the regular, observable workings of the created world.\n4.  **What is the terminology applicable to?** It must apply to two distinct scenarios:\n    *   The \"virgin birth of Jesus\": A singular, miraculous event that appears to suspend or violate a biological law.\n    *   \"Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall\": A foundational, systemic change in the state and operation of the natural world itself (e.g., the introduction of death, decay, suffering).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates**\nSeveral major theologians have discussed God's power, miracles, and the order of creation. The most prominent candidates for developing specific frameworks are:\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354-430):** A foundational Church Father who wrote extensively on creation, miracles, and God's providence.\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274):** A medieval scholastic theologian who is famous for his systematic integration of philosophy and theology. His work on God's power is highly detailed.\n*   **John Duns Scotus (c. 1266-1308):** A later scholastic who further developed and debated the concepts of divine power.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Candidates' Contributions**\n*   **Augustine:** Augustine argued that miracles are not \"contrary to nature\" but \"contrary to our knowledge of nature.\" He proposed the idea of *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons), suggesting that God placed the potential for all future events, including miracles, into creation from the very beginning. A miracle is thus the activation of a hidden potential. While this is a sophisticated explanation, it frames miracles as part of a deeper, pre-ordained nature rather than a \"change\" in its laws. It doesn't provide a distinct terminology for a change *in* the system versus a suspension *of* the system.\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas:** Aquinas is the strongest candidate. He systematically developed and popularized a crucial distinction regarding God's power, which became standard in later scholastic theology.\n    *   **The Specialized Terminology:** He distinguished between God's ***potentia ordinata*** (ordained power) and His ***potentia absoluta*** (absolute power).\n    *   ***Potentia Ordinata* (Ordained Power):** This refers to the reliable, consistent order that God freely chose to establish and by which He normally operates. This is what we call the \"laws of nature.\"\n    *   ***Potentia Absoluta* (Absolute Power):** This refers to God's sheer ability to do anything that is not logically contradictory. It is the realm of all possibilities, including those outside the current ordained order.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Aquinas's Terminology to the Two Scenarios**\nThis framework is perfectly suited to address both parts of the question:\n1.  **The Virgin Birth:** This is explained as an act of God's *potentia absoluta*. God, who is not bound by the biological rules of His *potentia ordinata*, directly intervenes to cause a birth without a human father. It is a miracle that suspends the normal, ordained law in a specific instance.\n2.  **The Fall:** The changes in the natural world after the Fall can be described as God instituting a *new* ordained order. The pre-Fall world operated under one *potentia ordinata* (e.g., without human death or certain kinds of decay). After the Fall, God, through His absolute power, established a different *potentia ordinata* for the world in its fallen state. This represents a fundamental alteration of the \"laws\" governing the system, not just a temporary suspension.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude on the \"First Developer\"**\nWhile the seed of this distinction existed in earlier theologians (like Peter Damian), it was Thomas Aquinas who rigorously defined, systematized, and integrated this terminology into a comprehensive theological framework in works like his *Summa Theologiae*. He is therefore credited with its mature development and popularization, making him the answer to the question.\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
