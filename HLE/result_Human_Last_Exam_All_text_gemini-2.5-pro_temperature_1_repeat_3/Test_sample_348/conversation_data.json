    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the total welfare of the market. Total welfare (also known as total surplus) is the sum of Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS).\n*   **Total Welfare (TW) = Consumer Surplus (CS) + Producer Surplus (PS)**\n\n**2. Define the Functions and Equilibrium**\n*   **Supply Function:** $P_S = \\ln(Q_S^3 - 2)$\n*   **Demand Function:** $P_D = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q_D)}$\nMarket equilibrium occurs when quantity supplied equals quantity demanded ($Q_S = Q_D = Q_E$) and the price is equal for both ($P_S = P_D = P_E$).\n\n**3. Find the Market Equilibrium Point ($Q_E$, $P_E$)**\nTo find the equilibrium, we set the supply and demand functions equal to each other:\n$\\ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)}$\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** This is a transcendental equation that cannot be solved algebraically for Q. Therefore, we must use numerical methods (like a graphing calculator or computational software) to find the intersection point.\n*   By solving this equation numerically, we find the equilibrium quantity:\n    $Q_E \\approx 4.693$\n*   Now, we substitute this value back into either the supply or demand function to find the equilibrium price:\n    $P_E = \\ln((4.693)^3 - 2) = \\ln(103.35 - 2) = \\ln(101.35) \\approx 4.619$\n    $P_E = 18e^{-\\arctan(4.693)} = 18e^{-1.36} \\approx 4.619$\n*   So, the equilibrium point is approximately **($Q_E$, $P_E$) = (4.693, 4.619)**.\n\n**4. Define and Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS)**\nConsumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price line, integrated from Q=0 to $Q_E$.\n*   **Formula:** $CS = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} [P_D(Q) - P_E] dQ$\n*   **Applying the values:** $CS = \\int_{0}^{4.693} [18e^{-\\arctan(Q)} - 4.619] dQ$\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This integral, specifically the $\\int e^{-\\arctan(Q)} dQ$ part, does not have a simple elementary antiderivative. It must also be computed numerically.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   $CS = \\int_{0}^{4.693} 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)} dQ - \\int_{0}^{4.693} 4.619 dQ$\n    *   The first term (area under the demand curve) evaluates to approximately 33.320.\n    *   The second term is the area of a rectangle: $P_E \\times Q_E = 4.619 \\times 4.693 \\approx 21.675$.\n    *   $CS \\approx 33.320 - 21.675 = 11.645$\n\n**5. Define and Calculate Producer Surplus (PS)**\nProducer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price line.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** We must first determine the domain of the supply function. For $P_S = \\ln(Q_S^3 - 2)$ to be defined, the argument of the logarithm must be positive:\n    $Q_S^3 - 2 > 0 \\implies Q_S^3 > 2 \\implies Q_S > \\sqrt[3]{2}$\n*   So, the supply curve starts at $Q_{min} = \\sqrt[3]{2} \\approx 1.260$. The integration for PS must be from this minimum quantity to $Q_E$.\n*   **Formula:** $PS = \\int_{Q_{min}}^{Q_E} [P_E - P_S(Q)] dQ$\n*   **Applying the values:** $PS = \\int_{1.260}^{4.693} [4.619 - \\ln(Q^3 - 2)] dQ$\n*   **Careful Point 4:** Similar to the CS, the integral for PS ($\\int \\ln(Q^3-2) dQ$) is complex and requires numerical evaluation.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   $PS = \\int_{1.260}^{4.693} 4.619 dQ - \\int_{1.260}^{4.693} \\ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ$\n    *   The first term is a rectangle: $P_E \\times (Q_E - Q_{min}) = 4.619 \\times (4.693 - 1.260) = 4.619 \\times 3.433 \\approx 15.857$.\n    *   The second term (area under the supply curve) evaluates numerically to approximately 10.330.\n    *   $PS \\approx 15.857 - 10.330 = 5.527$\n\n**6. Calculate Total Welfare (TW)**\nFinally, we sum the consumer and producer surpluses.\n*   $TW = CS + PS$\n*   $TW \\approx 11.645 + 5.527 = 17.172$\n\nThe total welfare at market equilibrium is approximately 17.17.\n\n<<<17.17>>>"
