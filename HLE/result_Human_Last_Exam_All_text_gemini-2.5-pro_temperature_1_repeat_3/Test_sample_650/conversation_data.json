    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Purpose:**\n    The algorithm takes an integer `n` and a base `c` and computes the representation of `n` in that base. For example, `IMAG(10, 2)` would produce `(1, 0, 1, 0)`. The method used is the standard one of repeatedly taking the remainder and dividing the number by the base.\n\n2.  **Identify the Basic Operations:**\n    The algorithm uses the following operations:\n    *   Assignment (`:=`)\n    *   Comparison (`>`)\n    *   Arithmetic operations: Integer division (`⌊x/c⌋`), multiplication (`qc`), and subtraction (`x - qc`).\n\n3.  **Determine the Cost of Basic Operations:**\n    In the standard Random Access Machine (RAM) model of computation, we assume that basic arithmetic operations on integers that fit within a computer's word size take a constant amount of time. We denote this constant time cost as `O(1)`. We will proceed with this common assumption.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Step of the Algorithm:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Initialization**\n        ```\n        i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_0 := x — qc;\n        ```\n        This step involves a few assignments and arithmetic operations. Specifically, there is one division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. Each of these is a single, constant-time operation. Therefore, the total time for Step 1 is constant, which is `O(1)`.\n\n    *   **Step 2: The `while` loop**\n        This is the core of the algorithm, and its running time will dominate the overall complexity. To analyze the loop, we need to find two things:\n        a. The cost of a single iteration of the loop.\n        b. The total number of times the loop executes.\n\n        *   **a. Cost of a single iteration (Step 2.1):**\n            ```\n            i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc\n            ```\n            Each iteration involves one increment, one assignment, one division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. Under our assumption, all these operations take constant time. Thus, the cost of a single iteration is `O(1)`.\n\n        *   **b. Number of iterations:**\n            The loop continues as long as the condition `q > 0` is true. Let's trace the value of `q`.\n            - Before the loop starts, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n            - In the first iteration, `x` becomes the old `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋`, which is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n            - In the second iteration, `q` becomes `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n            - After `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n            The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`. This inequality is true if and only if `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, which is equivalent to `n < c^(k+1)`.\n            To find the number of iterations `k`, we can take the logarithm of both sides with base `c`:\n            `log_c(n) < k+1`\n            `k > log_c(n) - 1`\n            The number of iterations `k` is the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n` minus one. The number of digits is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. So, the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n            Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`. We can say the number of iterations is `O(log_c n)`.\n\n    *   **Total Time for the Loop:**\n        The total time is the product of the number of iterations and the cost per iteration:\n        Time(Loop) = `(Number of iterations) * (Cost per iteration)`\n        Time(Loop) = `O(log_c n) * O(1) = O(log_c n)`.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Return**\n        ```\n        return ((a_i a_{i-1}, …, a_1 a_0))\n        ```\n        Returning the result (e.g., a pointer to the array or list of digits) is a constant time operation, `O(1)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Computational Time Complexity:**\n    The total time complexity `T(n)` is the sum of the complexities of all parts:\n    `T(n) = Time(Step 1) + Time(Step 2) + Time(Step 3)`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c n) + O(1)`\n    The dominant term is `O(log_c n)`.\n    So, `T(n) = O(log_c n)`.\n\n6.  **Final Simplification:**\n    In Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm does not affect the complexity class as long as the base is a constant greater than 1. This is because of the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c` is a constant, `1/log_b(c)` is also a constant factor, which is ignored in Big-O notation. Therefore, we can express the complexity as `O(log n)`.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Model of Computation:** The analysis assumes a RAM model where basic arithmetic operations on standard-sized integers are `O(1)`. If `n` were an arbitrarily large number requiring multiple machine words (bignum arithmetic), the cost of division and multiplication would depend on the number of bits in `n` (specifically, `O(log n)`), leading to an overall complexity of `O((log n)²)`. However, for typical algorithm analysis problems like this, the `O(1)` assumption for arithmetic is standard unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Loop Termination:** The key to the analysis is correctly identifying that the variable `q` decreases by a multiplicative factor `c` in each iteration. This multiplicative decrease is what leads to a logarithmic number of iterations.\n*   **Logarithm Base:** The complexity is technically `O(log_c n)`, but it is standard practice to write it as `O(log n)` because constant factors (including the base of the logarithm) are dropped in Big-O notation.\n*   **Input Parameters:** The complexity is analyzed with respect to the input value `n`. The base `c` is treated as a constant that affects the actual runtime but not the asymptotic growth rate.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The loop executes approximately `log_c(n)` times, and each iteration performs a constant number of operations. Therefore, the total time complexity is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
