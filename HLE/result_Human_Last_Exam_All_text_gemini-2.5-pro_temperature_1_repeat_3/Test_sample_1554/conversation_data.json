    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the philosopher in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Philosophical School:** The question specifies the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\". This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy active in Poland from the 1920s to the 1930s. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The answer must be one of these thinkers or a close associate.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Core Concepts:** The question centers on the decomposition of the notion of a \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n    *   **Hallmark:** This is a general term for a sign or an indicator that points to something else. In this philosophical context, it's a \"znak\" in Polish.\n    *   **Symptom (Symptom):** This is a specific type of sign. A symptom is a *natural* sign. It is connected to the thing it signifies by a natural, often causal, relationship. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a high temperature is a symptom of illness. The connection exists independently of human convention.\n    *   **Signal (Sygnał):** This is the other type of sign. A signal is a *conventional* or *artificial* sign. Its meaning is established by an agreement, rule, or habit. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"dog\" is a signal that refers to a specific type of animal. The connection is created by humans for communication.\n\n3.  **Search for the Origin of this Distinction within the School:** We need to find which philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School introduced or extensively used this specific distinction as part of their theory of signs (semiotics) or language.\n    *   Reviewing the works of the major figures, we find that this distinction is a central part of the philosophy of language and semiotics developed by **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n    *   In his analysis of language and meaning, particularly in works like \"Language and Cognition\" (*Język i poznanie*), Ajdukiewicz systematically analyzes the different types of signs. He explicitly distinguishes between natural signs, which he calls symptoms (or sometimes *oznaki*), and conventional signs, which he calls signals (*sygnały*). This was fundamental to his pragmatic theory of meaning.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The decomposition of the general notion of a sign (hallmark) into natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) is a key contribution of Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Translation:** The term \"hallmark\" is a good English equivalent for the general concept of a sign (*znak*) that Ajdukiewicz was analyzing. It is crucial to understand that he wasn't just using these words casually but was creating a technical, philosophical distinction.\n*   **Context:** This distinction is not merely a linguistic observation but a foundational element in Ajdukiewicz's epistemology and philosophy of science. Understanding how we get information from the world involves recognizing whether the signs we are interpreting are natural symptoms or man-made signals.\n*   **Attribution:** While other philosophers have made similar distinctions (e.g., Peirce's icon, index, symbol), the specific terminology of \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" within the context of the Lviv-Warsaw School is uniquely and strongly associated with Ajdukiewicz.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the philosopher.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
