**Specific Procedures of Appropriate Management:**
1.  **Immediate Medical Management:** Urgent referral to a physician to begin treatment for diabetes mellitus and lower her HbA1c level to below 7.0%.
2.  **Emergency Dental Care (at 28 hours):**
    *   Clinical and radiographic assessment to rule out further fractures.
    *   Gentle irrigation and debridement of the tooth sockets.
    *   Prescription of systemic antibiotics and analgesics.
    *   Suturing of any soft tissue lacerations.
3.  **Interim Prosthetic Phase:** Fabrication of a temporary acrylic removable partial denture ("flipper") to restore aesthetics and maintain space while her diabetes is brought under control.
4.  **Definitive Prosthetic Phase (Once Medically Stable):** Fabrication of a definitive Removable Partial Denture (RPD) as the safest and most practical long-term solution.

**Cells of Interest:**
The primary cells of interest are those whose function is impaired by uncontrolled diabetes, compromising healing and infection control:
*   **Neutrophils and Macrophages:** For their role in the immune response.
*   **Fibroblasts:** For their role in soft tissue healing and collagen synthesis.
*   **Osteoblasts:** For their role in bone formation and healing of the alveolar sockets.

**Denture Replacement Details:**
*   **Kind of Denture:** A **Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**.
*   **Material:** A **cast Cobalt-Chromium metal framework** with acrylic resin bases and acrylic/composite denture teeth.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
    *   **Primary Abutments:** The **left central incisor** and the **left second premolar**. These teeth are adjacent to the gap and will provide direct support and retention for the denture.
    *   **Secondary/Stabilizing Abutments:** Teeth on the opposite side of the arch, such as the **right canine and premolars**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The RPD must have a rigid metal framework that engages teeth on both sides of the arch (**cross-arc
