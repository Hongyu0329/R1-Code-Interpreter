    "Answering the question requires a step-by-step analysis of the group structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the term \"Power Subgroup\"**\nA \"power subgroup\" of a group G is a subgroup H that can be generated by a single element of G. In other words, there exists an element g in G such that H = <g>. This is the definition of a **cyclic subgroup**. So, the question is asking for the number of cyclic subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128**\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, is given by the presentation:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\nFor the group of size 128, we have $4n = 128$, which implies $n = 32$.\nSo, the group is $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\nThe order of the group is $|Q_{128}| = 128$.\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be divided into two disjoint sets:\n1.  The elements of the subgroup generated by $x$: $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 64\\}$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n2.  The remaining 64 elements, which are of the form $x^k y$ for $0 \\le k < 64$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the number of cyclic subgroups within $\\langle x \\rangle$**\nThe subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64. For any cyclic group of order $m$, the number of its subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of $m$, denoted $\\tau(m)$. All subgroups of a cyclic group are themselves cyclic.\nHere, $m = 64 = 2^6$. The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.\nThe number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6 + 1 = 7$.\nSo, there are **7** cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$. These are $\\langle x^{64/d} \\rangle$ for each divisor $d$ of 64.\n\n**Step 4: Find the number of cyclic subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$**\nThese are the elements of the form $g = x^k y$. Let's determine the order of these elements.\n$g^2 = (x^k y)^2 = x^k y x^k y = x^k (y x^k y^{-1}) y^2$\nUsing the relation $y x^k y^{-1} = (yxy^{-1})^k = (x^{-1})^k = x^{-k}$, we get:\n$g^2 = x^k (x^{-k}) y^2 = 1 \\cdot y^2 = x^{32}$.\nSince $x^{32}$ has order 2 (as $(x^{32})^2=x^{64}=1$), we have:\n$g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = 1$.\nAs $g^2 \\neq 1$, the order of any element $g = x^k y$ is 4.\nThis means all 64 elements of the form $x^k y$ generate a cyclic subgroup of order 4. We need to count how many of these subgroups are distinct.\nA cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators. If $g$ is a generator, the other generator is $g^3$.\nLet's find $g^3$:\n$g^3 = g^2 \\cdot g = x^{32} (x^k y)$. The element $x^{32} = y^2$ is in the center of the group, so it commutes with all elements.\n$g^3 = x^{32} x^k y = x^{k+32} y$.\nThis means that the elements $x^k y$ and $x^{k+32} y$ generate the same cyclic subgroup: $\\langle x^k y \\rangle = \\langle x^{k+32} y \\rangle$.\nThe 64 elements of the form $x^k y$ are paired up, with each pair generating a single unique subgroup.\nNumber of distinct subgroups = (Number of elements of this type) / (Number of generators per subgroup) = $64 / 2 = 32$.\nSo, there are **32** distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Check for overlaps and calculate the total**\nThe 7 subgroups from Step 3 are all contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\nThe 32 subgroups from Step 4 are not contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$, because each contains elements of the form $x^k y$.\nTherefore, the two sets of subgroups are disjoint. The only subgroup they could share is the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$, but the subgroups in the second set all have order 4. Thus, there is no overlap.\n\nThe total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is the sum of the counts from these two disjoint sets.\nTotal number = (cyclic subgroups within $\\langle x \\rangle$) + (cyclic subgroups generated by other elements)\nTotal number = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\nFinal verification:\n- Cyclic subgroups from $\\langle x \\rangle$: orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 (7 subgroups).\n- Cyclic subgroups from outside $\\langle x \\rangle$: all of order 4 (32 subgroups).\n- The order-4 subgroup from $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle = \\{1, x^{16}, x^{32}, x^{48}\\}$.\n- An order-4 subgroup from outside is $\\langle x^k y \\rangle = \\{1, x^k y, x^{32}, x^{k+32} y\\}$.\nThese two types of order-4 subgroups are distinct as one contains elements outside $\\langle x \\rangle$ and the other does not. So the count is correct.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\n<<<39>>>"
