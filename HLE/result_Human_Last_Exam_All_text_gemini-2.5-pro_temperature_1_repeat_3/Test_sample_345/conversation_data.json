    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which museum acquired the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key entities in the question:**\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\" (German: \"Der Radionist\")\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Year of creation:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Year of acquisition:** 1967\n    *   **Information to find:** The name of the acquiring museum.\n\n2.  **Initial Research Strategy:** The most direct approach is to search for the painting by its title and artist to see which museum collection it belongs to.\n\n3.  **Executing the Search:** A search for \"Kurt Günther The Radionist 1927\" or the German title \"Kurt Günther Der Radionist 1927\" leads to several results, prominently featuring the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections).\n\n4.  **Verifying the Details:**\n    *   We need to confirm that this specific institution acquired the painting in the specified year, 1967.\n    *   Consulting the online database of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden provides detailed information about the artwork.\n    *   The entry for \"Der Radionist\" by Kurt Günther (Inventory number: Gal.-Nr. 3474) confirms the artist, title, and creation date of 1927.\n    *   Crucially, the provenance (history of ownership) section for this painting explicitly states: \"erworben 1967 von Rudolf Günther, Gottscheina\" which translates to \"acquired in 1967 from Rudolf Günther, Gottscheina.\"\n\n5.  **Identifying the Specific Museum/Gallery:**\n    *   The Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden is a large complex of museums. The painting \"The Radionist\" is part of the collection of the **Galerie Neue Meister** (New Masters Gallery).\n    *   This gallery is housed within the Albertinum building in Dresden.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Correct Title:** Using both the English (\"The Radionist\") and original German (\"Der Radionist\") titles can yield more comprehensive search results. Note that it is also sometimes translated as \"The Radio Listener\".\n*   **Official Sources:** Relying on the official museum's online collection database is the most reliable way to confirm acquisition details and provenance, rather than secondary sources which may lack this specific information.\n*   **Museum vs. Gallery:** The acquiring institution is the Galerie Neue Meister, which is a constituent part of the larger organization, the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden. Both answers are technically correct, but Galerie Neue Meister is more specific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the official records from the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, the Galerie Neue Meister acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967.\n\n<<<Galerie Neue Meister, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden>>>"
