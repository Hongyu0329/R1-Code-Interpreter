    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space and the object of study.**\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. We are interested in its integral cohomology ring, $H^*(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The dimension of this space is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$. The cohomology ring is a graded ring: $H^*(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the quantity to be calculated.**\nWe need to find the torsion subgroup of the additive group of the cohomology ring. Let this ring be $R$. The torsion subgroup of $R$ is $T(R) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 T(H^i(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$, where $T(G)$ denotes the torsion subgroup of an abelian group $G$. The question asks for the **rank** of the abelian group $T(R)$.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the definition of \"rank\".**\nFor any finitely generated abelian group $G$, the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups states that $G$ can be uniquely decomposed into a direct sum $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T$, where $T$ is a finite abelian group (the torsion subgroup) and $r$ is a non-negative integer. This integer $r$ is called the **rank** of the group $G$.\nA torsion group is a group in which every element has finite order. By definition, a torsion group has no free part of the form $\\mathbb{Z}^r$ with $r>0$. Therefore, the rank of any torsion group is 0.\n\nThe question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup. By definition, this rank must be 0. However, to ensure this is not a trick question contingent on the space having no torsion, we should determine the structure of the torsion subgroup itself.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the integral homology of $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.**\nThe integral cohomology can be determined from the integral homology using the Universal Coefficient Theorem. The integral homology groups of real Grassmannians are well-known and have been computed in various sources (e.g., papers by S. T. Lam, H. L. Hiller, and books on algebraic topology). For $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the homology groups are:\n*   $H_0(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H_1(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H_2(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H_3(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H_4(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H_5(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H_6(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ (as the manifold is non-orientable)\n*   $H_i(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $i > 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the integral cohomology groups from the homology groups.**\nWe use the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology, which gives a short exact sequence:\n$0 \\to \\text{Ext}_{\\mathbb{Z}}^1(H_{i-1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\text{Hom}_{\\mathbb{Z}}(H_i(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$.\nThis sequence splits, so $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_i, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}(H_{i-1}, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The free part of $H^i$ is $F_i = \\text{Hom}(H_i, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The torsion part of $H^i$ is $T_i = \\text{Ext}(H_{i-1}, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nUsing the facts that $\\text{Hom}(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\text{Hom}(\\mathbb{Z}_n, \\mathbb{Z})=0$, $\\text{Ext}(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z})=0$, and $\\text{Ext}(\\mathbb{Z}_n, \\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}_n$, we compute the cohomology groups:\n*   $H^0: \\text{Hom}(H_0,\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\text{Ext}(H_{-1},\\mathbb{Z})=0 \\implies H^0 = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   $H^1: \\text{Hom}(H_1,\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, $\\text{Ext}(H_0,\\mathbb{Z})=0 \\implies H^1 = 0$.\n*   $H^2: \\text{Hom}(H_2,\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, $\\text{Ext}(H_1,\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\implies H^2 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $H^3: \\text{Hom}(H_3,\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, $\\text{Ext}(H_2,\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\implies H^3 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $H^4: \\text{Hom}(H_4,\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, $\\text{Ext}(H_3,\\mathbb{Z})=\\text{Ext}(\\mathbb{Z}_2^2,\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}_2^2 \\implies H^4 = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $H^5: \\text{Hom}(H_5,\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\text{Ext}(H_4,\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\implies H^5 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $H^6: \\text{Hom}(H_6,\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, $\\text{Ext}(H_5,\\mathbb{Z})=0 \\implies H^6 = 0$.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the torsion subgroup of the cohomology ring.**\nThe integral cohomology ring is $R = H^0 \\oplus H^1 \\oplus H^2 \\oplus H^3 \\oplus H^4 \\oplus H^5 \\oplus H^6$.\nThe torsion subgroup of $R$ is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each component:\n$T(R) = T(H^0) \\oplus T(H^1) \\oplus T(H^2) \\oplus T(H^3) \\oplus T(H^4) \\oplus T(H^5) \\oplus T(H^6)$\n$T(R) = 0 \\oplus 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus 0$\n$T(R) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$.\nThis confirms that the torsion subgroup is non-trivial.\n\n**Step 7: Determine the rank of the torsion subgroup.**\nThe group in question is $T = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$. This is a finite group of order $2^5=32$. Every element in $T$ has order 1 or 2. Thus, $T$ is a torsion group. According to the standard definition, the rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its free part. Since $T$ is a torsion group, its free part is trivial (i.e., $\\{0\\}$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}^0$).\nTherefore, the rank of the torsion subgroup $T$ is 0.\n\nIt is worth noting that some authors use \"rank\" to mean the minimal number of generators of a finite group. In that case, the answer would be 5. However, in the standard terminology of module theory and group theory, the rank refers to the dimension of the free part, making the answer 0. Given the formal nature of the question, the standard definition is the most appropriate one to use."
