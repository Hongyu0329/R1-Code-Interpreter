    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the value of a(3).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **a(n):** This represents a sequence where each term `a(n)` gives a specific number.\n    *   **Object being counted:** \"non-vanishing Feynman diagrams\".\n    *   **Physical process:** Corrections to \"the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics (QED)\". These are known as self-energy diagrams for the electron and vacuum polarization diagrams for the photon. At a given order, the number of diagrams is the same for both.\n    *   **Order of the diagrams:** The order is `2n`. In QED, the order of a diagram in the perturbative expansion is determined by the number of vertices, as each vertex introduces a factor of the coupling constant `e`. An order `2n` diagram has `2n` vertices. This corresponds to an `n`-loop correction.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the value of `a(3)`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Terminology:**\n    *   **Order 2n and n-loops:** For propagator corrections, a diagram with `2n` vertices will have `n` loops.\n        *   `n=1`: Order 2 (2 vertices), 1-loop diagrams.\n        *   `n=2`: Order 4 (4 vertices), 2-loop diagrams.\n        *   `n=3`: Order 6 (6 vertices), 3-loop diagrams.\n    *   The question asks for `a(3)`, which means we need to find the number of diagrams of order `2 * 3 = 6`. These are the 3-loop diagrams.\n    *   **\"Non-vanishing Feynman diagrams\":** This is a critical phrase. In the calculation of propagator corrections, we sum over all contributing diagrams. These are typically organized into **one-particle irreducible (1PI)** diagrams. A diagram is 1PI if it cannot be split into two separate diagrams by cutting a single internal propagator line. Reducible diagrams are simply chains of these 1PI diagrams. If one were to count all diagrams, including reducible ones, the number would be infinite. Therefore, in this context, \"non-vanishing\" or the fundamental set of diagrams to be calculated at a given order refers to the **connected, one-particle irreducible (1PI) diagrams**.\n\n3.  **State the Refined Problem:**\n    Based on the analysis, the question is asking for the number of topologically distinct, connected, one-particle irreducible (1PI) Feynman diagrams for the electron self-energy (or photon vacuum polarization) at the 3-loop level (which corresponds to order 6).\n\n4.  **Find the Number from Established Results:**\n    The enumeration of Feynman diagrams is a standard but complex problem in quantum field theory. The results are well-established in the literature.\n    *   **a(1) (1-loop):** There is **1** 1PI diagram. It consists of an electron emitting and reabsorbing a single photon.\n    *   **a(2) (2-loops):** There are **2** distinct 1PI diagrams.\n    *   **a(3) (3-loops):** This is a higher-order calculation. The number of diagrams is known from landmark calculations in QED. For example, the paper by S. Laporta and E. Remiddi, which computed the three-loop electron self-energy, explicitly identifies and computes **7** topologically distinct 1PI diagrams. This result is a standard reference point in advanced QED.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number `a(n)` corresponds to the number of `n`-loop 1PI diagrams for the QED propagator. We need to find `a(3)`, which is the number of 3-loop diagrams. According to established results in quantum field theory, this number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
