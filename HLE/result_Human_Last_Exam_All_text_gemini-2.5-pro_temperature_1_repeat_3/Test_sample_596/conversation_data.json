    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question\nThe question asks for the number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests $(F,R)$\" on the \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\" that have a specific property: the forest $F$ does *not* simplicially collapse onto the root $R$.\n\nTo answer this, we need to define these terms:\n1.  **Standard triangulation of the Möbius band ($M$)**: This is a specific simplicial complex representing the Möbius band.\n2.  **Higher dimensional rooted forest $(F,R)$**: This is a pair of subcomplexes of $M$, with $R \\subseteq F \\subseteq M$, satisfying certain properties.\n3.  **Simplicial collapse ($F \\searrow R$)**: This is a fundamental concept in piecewise-linear topology. A complex $F$ collapses to a subcomplex $R$ if $F$ can be reduced to $R$ by a sequence of elementary collapses.\n\nThe structure of the question (\"How many objects of type X fail property Y?\") suggests that the definition of X does not automatically imply Y. We need to find a definition of a \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" that is independent of the collapsibility property and then check when the collapse fails.\n\n### Step 2: Define \"Higher Dimensional Rooted Forest\"\nThe terminology is common in modern algebraic and topological combinatorics. A suitable definition that fits the question's structure is given by A. Ayzenberg, based on the work of Kalai, Duval, and others.\n\n*   **Definition**: Let $K$ be a simplicial complex. A pair of subcomplexes $(F, R)$ with $R \\subseteq F \\subseteq K$ is called a **rooted forest** if:\n    1.  For every simplex $\\sigma \\in F \\setminus R$, its link in $F$, denoted $lk_F(\\sigma)$, is simplicially collapsible.\n    2.  For every simplex $\\sigma \\in R$, its link $lk_F(\\sigma)$ is **acyclic** (i.e., its reduced homology groups with integer coefficients $\\tilde{H}_i(lk_F(\\sigma); \\mathbb{Z})$ are all zero).\n\nWith this definition, not every rooted forest $(F,R)$ necessarily has the property that $F$ collapses to $R$.\n\n### Step 3: Find the condition for collapse failure\nThere is a theorem that connects the definition of a rooted forest to the property of collapsibility.\n\n*   **Theorem (Ayzenberg)**: Let $(F,R)$ be a rooted forest. Then $F$ simplicially collapses to $R$ if and only if for every simplex $\\sigma \\in R$, the link $lk_F(\\sigma)$ is **collapsible**.\n\nCombining this theorem with the definition, a rooted forest $(F,R)$ fails to have $F$ collapse to $R$ if and only if:\n*   There exists at least one simplex $\\sigma \\in R$ such that its link $lk_F(\\sigma)$ is **acyclic but not collapsible**.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the number of rooted forests $(F,R)$ on the Möbius band for which such a simplex $\\sigma$ exists.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the simplicial complex and its links\nThe properties of links depend on the ambient complex, in this case, a triangulation of the Möbius band ($M$). A key insight is that the topological nature of the Möbius band (being a 2-manifold with boundary) constrains the structure of the links of its simplices, regardless of the specific triangulation used.\n\nLet $M$ be any triangulation of a 2-manifold with boundary. Let $\\sigma$ be a simplex in $M$.\n*   **Case 1: $\\sigma$ is a vertex ($v$)**. The link $lk_M(v)$ is a 1-dimensional simplicial complex (a graph). The vertices of this graph are the neighbors of $v$ in $M$, and its edges correspond to the 2-simplices (triangles) of $M$ containing $v$.\n*   **Case 2: $\\sigma$ is an edge ($e$)**. The link $lk_M(e)$ is a 0-dimensional simplicial complex (a set of vertices). Since an edge in a 2-manifold can be contained in at most two 2-simplices, $lk_M(e)$ consists of at most two vertices.\n*   **Case 3: $\\sigma$ is a face ($f$)**. The link $lk_M(f)$ is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n\nNow, for any rooted forest $(F,R)$, the link $lk_F(\\sigma)$ is a subcomplex of $lk_M(\\sigma)$. We need to see if $lk_F(\\sigma)$ can be acyclic but not collapsible.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the condition \"acyclic but not collapsible\" for the links\nLet's check this possibility for each dimension of $\\sigma \\in R$.\n\n*   **If $\\sigma$ is a vertex ($v$)**: The link $lk_F(v)$ is a graph. For a graph $G$ to be acyclic, its reduced homology must be zero.\n    *   $\\tilde{H}_1(G; \\mathbb{Z})=0$ means $G$ has no cycles (it's a forest in the graph-theoretic sense).\n    *   $\\tilde{H}_0(G; \\mathbb{Z})=0$ means $G$ is connected.\n    *   A connected graph with no cycles is a **tree**.\n    *   Is a tree always collapsible? Yes. Any non-trivial tree has at least one leaf (a vertex of degree 1). The edge incident to the leaf can be collapsed, and by induction, the entire tree collapses to a single point.\n    *   Therefore, if a graph is acyclic, it must be a tree, and therefore it must be collapsible. There are no graphs that are acyclic but not collapsible.\n\n*   **If $\\sigma$ is an edge ($e$)**: The link $lk_F(e)$ is a 0-dimensional complex (a set of points), being a subcomplex of $lk_M(e)$ which has at most two points. For a 0-dimensional complex $X$ to be acyclic, its only non-trivial reduced homology group, $\\tilde{H}_0(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, must be zero. This requires the complex to be connected, which means it must consist of a **single point**. A single point is simplicially collapsible. The empty set is also acyclic and collapsible. Thus, any acyclic 0-dimensional link is collapsible.\n\n*   **If $\\sigma$ is a face ($f$)**: The link $lk_F(f)$ must be the empty set. The empty set is both acyclic and collapsible.\n\nIn all cases, for any simplex $\\sigma$ in any triangulation of a 2-manifold, if a subcomplex of its link is acyclic, it must also be collapsible. The low dimensionality of the links prevents the existence of complexes that are acyclic but not collapsible (like the \"dunce hat\" or other contractible but non-collapsible 2-complexes).\n\n### Step 6: Conclude the analysis\nThe core of the problem is whether a rooted forest $(F,R)$ on the Möbius band can have a simplex $\\sigma \\in R$ where $lk_F(\\sigma)$ is acyclic but not collapsible.\nOur analysis in Step 5 shows this is impossible. For any simplex $\\sigma \\in R$, if its link $lk_F(\\sigma)$ is acyclic (a condition required by the definition of a rooted forest), then it must also be collapsible.\n\nThis means that for *any* higher dimensional rooted forest $(F,R)$ on the Möbius band, it is always true that for every $\\sigma \\in R$, $lk_F(\\sigma)$ is collapsible. By the theorem in Step 3, this implies that $F$ always simplicially collapses to $R$.\n\nTherefore, the number of higher dimensional rooted forests $(F,R)$ that *fail* to have the forest $F$ simplicially collapse onto the root $R$ is zero."
