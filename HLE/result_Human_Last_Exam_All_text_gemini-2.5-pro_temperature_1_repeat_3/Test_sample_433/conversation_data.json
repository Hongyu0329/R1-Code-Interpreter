    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What:** The question asks for the \"BUD\" or Beyond-Use Date.\n    *   **For What:** A \"single dose container ampule\".\n    *   **Condition 1:** After the \"time of puncture\" (or opening, in the case of an ampule).\n    *   **Condition 2:** In a \"sterile environment\".\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** This is the date or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) must not be used. It is determined from the time the preparation is compounded and is based on the risk of microbial contamination. It is different from the manufacturer's expiration date on an unopened product.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container (SDC):** A vial or ampule intended for a single use for one patient. SDCs typically lack antimicrobial preservatives.\n    *   **Ampule:** A sealed glass container with a neck that is broken off to access the medication. Once opened, it cannot be resealed, making it a classic example of a single-dose container.\n    *   **Sterile Environment:** In the context of sterile compounding, this refers to a primary engineering control (PEC) that provides ISO Class 5 air quality or better, such as a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or a biological safety cabinet (BSC).\n\n3.  **Identify the Governing Standard:**\n    *   The standards for sterile compounding in the United States are set by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically in **USP General Chapter <797> \"Pharmaceutical Compounding—Sterile Preparations.\"** We must refer to the rules outlined in this chapter.\n\n4.  **Apply the USP <797> Rule:**\n    *   The current official version of USP <797> (the 2022 version, effective November 1, 2023) provides clear guidance on the use of single-dose containers.\n    *   The chapter states that when a single-dose container (including an ampule) is opened or punctured within an **ISO Class 5 environment or cleaner**, the contents must be used within **12 hours** from the time of opening.\n    *   This 12-hour BUD applies only if the container remains in the ISO Class 5 environment.\n\n5.  **List Careful Points and Nuances:**\n    *   **Ampule Specifics:** Since an ampule cannot be resealed, its contents must be drawn up into a syringe or other container immediately after it is broken open. The ampule itself cannot be stored. The 12-hour BUD applies from the moment the ampule is opened until the administration of the final preparation begins.\n    *   **Sterile Environment is Crucial:** The 12-hour BUD is only applicable when the ampule is opened in an ISO Class 5 environment. If the same ampule were opened outside of an ISO Class 5 environment (e.g., at a patient's bedside), the BUD is significantly shorter—typically stated as \"for immediate use\" or within 1 hour.\n    *   **Maximum Time, Not Recommended Storage:** The 12-hour limit is the absolute maximum time allowed to maintain sterility and stability under the specified conditions. Best practice is always to use the contents as soon as possible after opening.\n    *   **Distinction from Multi-Dose Vials:** Multi-dose vials contain preservatives and have a different BUD after the first puncture (typically 28 days, unless specified otherwise by the manufacturer). The question specifically asks about a single-dose ampule.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the rules set forth in USP Chapter <797>, a single-dose container ampule, once opened in a sterile (ISO Class 5) environment, has a Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of **12 hours**.\n\n<<<12 hours>>>"
