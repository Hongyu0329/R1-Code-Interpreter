    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to decode the word.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of the encoding**\n\nThe input is presented in a `verbatim` block in LaTeX, which means all spaces and line breaks are preserved exactly as they appear. The encoding uses the characters 't' and 'b' arranged in a specific layout to form letters. The structure suggests three letters, composed of horizontal and vertical parts.\n\n*   There are three main horizontal lines of 't's and 'b's, which can be interpreted as the top, middle, and bottom parts of the letters.\n*   There are two vertical \"stems\" of single characters. One is on the left, and one is indented to the right. These provide vertical information for the letters.\n*   We can assume 't' represents a filled part of the letter (foreground/ink) and 'b' represents an empty part (background/paper).\n\n**Step 2: Segment the input into parts for each letter**\n\nLet's break down the input into components for three letters. We'll denote the letters as Letter 1, Letter 2, and Letter 3 from left to right.\n\n*   **Top Parts (from the first line `t b b t t t t b b b`):**\n    *   Letter 1: `t b b`\n    *   Letter 2: `t t t t`\n    *   Letter 3: `b b b`\n*   **Middle Parts (from the seventh line `t b t t b b b b b b`):**\n    *   Letter 1: `t b t`\n    *   Letter 2: `t b b b`\n    *   Letter 3: `b b b`\n*   **Bottom Parts (from the last line `b b t t t t b t b b`):**\n    *   Letter 1: `b b t`\n    *   Letter 2: `t t t t`\n    *   Letter 3: `b t b b`\n*   **Vertical Stems:**\n    *   Left Stem (for Letter 1, lines 2-6): `b, b, b, t, b` (read top to bottom)\n    *   Right Stem (for Letter 3, lines 8-12): `b, b, t, t, b` (read top to bottom)\n    *   Letter 2 does not have a vertical stem.\n\n**Step 3: Reconstruct each letter**\n\nThe vertical stems have 5 characters, suggesting that each letter is 5 units high. The horizontal parts likely correspond to rows 1 (top), 3 (middle), and 5 (bottom) of this 5-unit height.\n\nLet's build each letter on a grid. We'll use `#` for 't' and `.` for 'b' or a blank space. The final letter shape is determined by combining the horizontal and vertical information, likely using a logical OR operation (a spot is filled if either its horizontal or vertical part specifies a 't').\n\nLet's assume the vertical stem defines entire rows. If the character in the stem for a given row is 'b', the row is blank (`...`). If it's 't', the row is filled (`###`). This vertical information is then combined with the information from the horizontal parts.\n\n**Letter 1:**\n*   Horizontal parts (rows 1, 3, 5):\n    *   Row 1 (`t b b`): `# . .`\n    *   Row 3 (`t b t`): `# . #`\n    *   Row 5 (`b b t`): `. . #`\n*   Vertical stem (`b, b, b, t, b`):\n    *   Row 1 is blank (`. . .`)\n    *   Row 2 is blank (`. . .`)\n    *   Row 3 is blank (`. . .`)\n    *   Row 4 is filled (`# # #`)\n    *   Row 5 is blank (`. . .`)\n*   Combining them (OR operation):\n    *   Row 1: `# . .` OR `. . .` -> `# . .`\n    *   Row 2: (blank) OR `. . .` -> `. . .`\n    *   Row 3: `# . #` OR `. . .` -> `# . #`\n    *   Row 4: (blank) OR `# # #` -> `# # #`\n    *   Row 5: `. . #` OR `. . .` -> `. . #`\n*   Resulting shape for Letter 1:\n    ```\n    # . .\n    . . .\n    # . #\n    # # #\n    . . #\n    ```\n    This shape strongly resembles the letter **A**.\n\n**Letter 2:**\n*   Horizontal parts (rows 1, 3, 5):\n    *   Row 1 (`t t t t`): `# # # #`\n    *   Row 3 (`t b b b`): `# . . .`\n    *   Row 5 (`t t t t`): `# # # #`\n*   Vertical stem: None. This means rows 2 and 4 are blank.\n*   Resulting shape for Letter 2:\n    ```\n    # # # #\n    . . . .\n    # . . .\n    . . . .\n    # # # #\n    ```\n    This shape is a blocky representation of the letter **G**.\n\n**Letter 3:**\n*   Horizontal parts (rows 1, 3, 5):\n    *   Row 1 (`b b b`): `. . .`\n    *   Row 3 (`b b b`): `. . .`\n    *   Row 5 (`b t b b`): `. # . .`\n*   Vertical stem (`b, b, t, t, b`):\n    *   Row 1 is blank (`. . .`)\n    *   Row 2 is blank (`. . .`)\n    *   Row 3 is filled (`# # #`)\n    *   Row 4 is filled (`# # #`)\n    *   Row 5 is blank (`. . .`)\n*   Combining them (OR operation):\n    *   Row 1: `. . .` OR `. . .` -> `. . .`\n    *   Row 2: (blank) OR `. . .` -> `. . .`\n    *   Row 3: `. . .` OR `# # #` -> `# # #`\n    *   Row 4: (blank) OR `# # #` -> `# # #`\n    *   Row 5: `. # . .` OR `. . .` -> `. # . .`\n*   Resulting shape for Letter 3:\n    ```\n    . . . .\n    . . . .\n    # # # .\n    # # # .\n    . # . .\n    ```\n    This shape, with a loop at the top and a leg below, represents the letter **P**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the letters**\n\nThe decoded letters are A, G, and P.\n\nThe encoded word is AGP.\n\n<<<AGP>>>"
