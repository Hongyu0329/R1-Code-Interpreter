    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Finite Group G:** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A non-empty subset `S` of `G` is called product-free if for any elements `x, y ∈ S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S.S ∩ S = ∅`.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` that is not a proper subset of any other product-free set.\n*   **Filled Group (as stated in the question):** A finite group `G` where the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to `G`.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Literal Definition of a \"Filled Group\"\n\nLet's analyze the definition provided in the question: \"all the maximum by inclusion product-free sets in G fills G\". This means `∪ S = G`, where the union is over all maximal product-free sets `S`.\n\n1.  Consider the identity element `e` of the group `G`.\n2.  Let `S` be any product-free set.\n3.  If `e` were in `S`, then taking `x = e` and `y = e`, the product is `xy = e.e = e`.\n4.  By the definition of a product-free set, this product `xy = e` cannot be in `S`.\n5.  This leads to a contradiction: `e ∈ S` and `e ∉ S`.\n6.  Therefore, the identity element `e` can never be an element of any product-free set.\n7.  Consequently, `e` cannot be in any maximal product-free set either.\n8.  The union of all maximal product-free sets is a subset of `G \\ {e}`.\n9.  For this union to be equal to `G`, it must be the case that `G = G \\ {e}`, which is only possible if `G` has no elements other than `e` and simultaneously `e` is not in `G`. This is impossible for any group. The only edge case is the trivial group `G = {e}`. For `G={e}`, the only maximal product-free set is the empty set `∅`. The union is `∅`, which is not equal to `{e}`.\n\nThis means that according to the strict, literal definition provided in the question, **no group is a filled group**. This suggests the question likely intended to use the standard definition from group theory literature, where \"fills G\" is understood in a specific technical sense.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Standard Definition of a \"Filled Group\"\n\nIn the field of group theory, a group `G` is called \"filled\" if the union of its maximal product-free sets covers every element *outside* the Frattini subgroup, `Φ(G)`.\n\n*   **Frattini Subgroup `Φ(G)`:** The intersection of all maximal subgroups of `G`. It consists of the \"non-generators\" of the group.\n*   **Standard Definition of Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is filled if `∪ S = G \\ Φ(G)`, where the union is over all maximal product-free sets `S`.\n\nWe will proceed with this standard definition to find a non-trivial solution. The problem is now to find all finite nilpotent groups `G` such that every element `g ∈ G \\ Φ(G)` is contained in at least one maximal product-free set.\n\n### Step 4: Finding a Sufficient Condition for a Group to be Filled\n\n1.  Let `G` be a finite nilpotent group and let `g` be an element in `G \\ Φ(G)`.\n2.  By the definition of `Φ(G)`, since `g ∉ Φ(G)`, there must exist a maximal subgroup `M` of `G` such that `g ∉ M`.\n3.  Consider the set `S = G \\ M`. This set `S` contains `g`. If we can show that `S` is product-free, then `g` belongs to a product-free set `S`, which is contained in some maximal product-free set. If this holds for any choice of `g`, the group `G` is filled.\n4.  Let's determine when `S = G \\ M` is product-free.\n    *   `S` is product-free if for any `x, y ∈ S`, their product `xy ∉ S`.\n    *   This means for any `x ∉ M` and `y ∉ M`, we must have `xy ∈ M`.\n5.  Let's analyze this condition in the quotient group `G/M`. Since `G` is nilpotent, any maximal subgroup `M` is normal, and the quotient `G/M` is a cyclic group of prime order, say `p`. So `G/M ≅ Z_p`.\n6.  The condition \"if `x ∉ M` and `y ∉ M`, then `xy ∈ M`\" translates to \"if `xM ≠ M` and `yM ≠ M`, then `(xy)M = M`\" in the quotient group.\n7.  In `Z_p`, this means that for any two non-identity elements `a, b`, their product `ab` must be the identity. Let's test this. Let `a` be a generator of `Z_p`. Taking `b=a`, we need `a * a = a^2` to be the identity. This implies the order of `a`, which is `p`, must divide 2. Since `p` is prime, we must have `p=2`.\n8.  If `p=2`, then `G/M ≅ Z_2`. The only non-identity element is the generator `a`. The condition requires `a*a` to be the identity, which is true in `Z_2`.\n9.  Therefore, the set `G \\ M` is product-free if and only if the index `[G:M] = 2`.\n\n### Step 5: Characterizing Filled Nilpotent Groups\n\nA finite nilpotent group `G` is filled if for any `g ∈ G \\ Φ(G)`, there exists a maximal subgroup `M` with `g ∉ M` and `[G:M]=2`. This is equivalent to saying that the quotient group `G/Φ(G)` has the property that every element is missed by some maximal subgroup of index 2. This implies that every maximal subgroup of `G` must have index 2.\n\n1.  A group `G` has the property that all its maximal subgroups have index 2 if and only if the quotient group `G/Φ(G)` is an elementary abelian 2-group (i.e., isomorphic to `(Z_2)^k` for some `k`).\n2.  So, a finite nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if `G/Φ(G)` is an elementary abelian 2-group.\n3.  Now we use the fact that `G` is nilpotent. A finite group `G` is nilpotent if it is the direct product of its Sylow `p`-subgroups: `G = P_1 × P_2 × ... × P_r`, where `P_i` is the Sylow `p_i`-subgroup.\n4.  The Frattini subgroup of a direct product is the direct product of the Frattini subgroups: `Φ(G) = Φ(P_1) × Φ(P_2) × ... × Φ(P_r)`.\n5.  Therefore, `G/Φ(G) ≅ P_1/Φ(P_1) × P_2/Φ(P_2) × ... × P_r/Φ(P_r)`.\n6.  For any `p`-group `P`, the quotient `P/Φ(P)` is an elementary abelian `p`-group.\n7.  We require `G/Φ(G)` to be an elementary abelian 2-group. For the direct product `P_1/Φ(P_1) × ... × P_r/Φ(P_r)` to be an elementary abelian 2-group, each factor `P_i/Φ(P_i)` (which is an elementary abelian `p_i`-group) must itself be a 2-group.\n8.  This is only possible if `p_i = 2`. If `p_i` is an odd prime, the `p_i`-group `P_i/Φ(P_i)` can only be a 2-group if it is the trivial group `{e}`.\n9.  If `P_i/Φ(P_i)` is trivial, then `P_i = Φ(P_i)`, which for a finite `p`-group implies `P_i` is the trivial group.\n10. This means that `G` can only have a non-trivial Sylow subgroup for the prime `p=2`. In other words, `G` must be a 2-group.\n\n### Step 6: The Converse\n\nIs every finite 2-group a filled nilpotent group?\n1.  Let `G` be a finite 2-group.\n2.  By definition, any `p`-group is nilpotent. So `G` is nilpotent.\n3.  For any finite 2-group `G`, the quotient `G/Φ(G)` is an elementary abelian 2-group.\n4.  As established in Step 5, this is the necessary and sufficient condition for a finite nilpotent group to be filled.\n5.  Therefore, every finite 2-group is a filled nilpotent group.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the results, the finite nilpotent groups that are also filled groups (under the standard definition) are precisely the finite 2-groups.\n\n<<<The finite 2-groups.>>>"
