    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Object X**\n*   $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in complex projective 3-space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. It is defined by the zero locus of a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   The complex dimension of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 3. As a hypersurface, the complex dimension of $X$ is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n*   Thus, $X$ is a complex surface, and its real dimension is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(X) = 4$.\n*   Such a surface is a projective algebraic variety, and in particular, a compact KÃ¤hler manifold.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Long Exact Sequence of Homotopy Groups**\nWe consider the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ and the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_k(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_{k-1}(X) \\to \\dots $$\nWe are interested in $\\pi_3(X)$. Let's look at the sequence around $k=3$ and $k=4$:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\xrightarrow{j_*} \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\dots $$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Homotopy Groups of the Ambient Space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$**\nThe space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is the base of the Hopf fibration $S^1 \\to S^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$. The long exact sequence of this fibration implies:\n*   $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^7) = 0$ (since $\\pi_k(S^n)=0$ for $k<n$).\n*   $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_4(S^7) = 0$ (since $4<7$).\nNote: While $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is a torsion group ($\\mathbb{Z}_2$), its rank is 0. For this problem, we only need the rank.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the Long Exact Sequence for the Pair**\nSubstituting the values for $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ into the sequence from Step 2:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\xrightarrow{j_*} \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} 0 $$\nThis tells us that the map $\\partial: \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X)$ is surjective. The kernel of $\\partial$ is the image of $j_*$.\nSo, we have an isomorphism:\n$$ \\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) / \\text{Im}(j_*) $$\nTo find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$, we tensor with $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is a torsion group, $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = 0$, so its image $\\text{Im}(j_*) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is also zero.\nThis gives a crucial isomorphism for the ranks:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)) $$\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the rank of the relative homotopy group $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n\n**Step 5: Relate Relative Homotopy to Relative Homology via Hurewicz Theorem**\nThe (relative) Hurewicz theorem connects homotopy groups to homology groups. We need to check its conditions.\nThe relative Hurewicz theorem states that if $(Y, A)$ is a pair of simply-connected spaces and $\\pi_k(Y, A) = 0$ for $k < n$, then $\\pi_n(Y, A) \\cong H_n(Y, A; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem implies that $i_*: \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism. Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$, $X$ is simply connected. The theorem also implies $\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)=0$.\n*   For $n=3$, the Hurewicz map $h_3: \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is an isomorphism because the lower relative homotopy groups are zero.\n*   For $n=4$, we cannot apply the theorem directly because $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is not zero. However, a more general version of the theorem gives a short exact sequence:\n    $$ \\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\otimes \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\xrightarrow{\\omega} \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\xrightarrow{h_4} H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to 0 $$\n    where $\\omega$ is the Whitehead product map.\n*   Rationally, this sequence is $\\omega \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}: (\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)\\otimes\\mathbb{Q}) \\otimes (\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3,X)\\otimes\\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)\\otimes\\mathbb{Q}$, and this map is surjective since $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})=0$ (as we will show in Step 7). It is a non-trivial theorem that this map is also rationally injective, i.e., an isomorphism.\n*   Assuming this, we have $\\text{rank}(\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)) \\cdot \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X))$.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the Ranks of the Terms**\n1.  **rank($\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$):** We know $\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. So, its rank is 1.\n2.  **rank($\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$):** As shown in Step 5, this equals rank($H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$). We compute this from the long exact sequence of homology for the pair:\n    $$ \\dots \\to H_3(X) \\to H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to H_2(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\dots $$\n    *   For any smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ with $n \\ge 3$, $H_3$ is zero. So $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Also $H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z})=0$.\n    *   The sequence gives an isomorphism $H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\ker(i_*: H_2(X) \\to H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3))$.\n    *   $H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The map $i_*$ is surjective by the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem.\n    *   The kernel consists of homology classes on $X$ that become trivial in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This is the *primitive homology* $H_2(X)_{prim}$.\n    *   The rank of $H_2(X)$ is given by the second Betti number $b_2(X)$. The rank of the kernel is thus $b_2(X) - \\text{rank}(H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)) = b_2(X) - 1$.\n    *   We need to compute $b_2(X)$. For a smooth quintic ($d=5$) surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the Hodge numbers are known: $h^{2,0}(X) = \\binom{d-1}{3} = \\binom{4}{3} = 4$. By duality $h^{0,2}=4$. The middle Hodge number is $h^{1,1}(X)=45$.\n    *   So, $b_2(X) = h^{2,0} + h^{1,1} + h^{0,2} = 4 + 45 + 4 = 53$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\text{rank}(H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)) = b_2(X) - 1 = 53 - 1 = 52$.\n\n**Step 7: Final Calculation**\nCombining the results:\n*   $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X))$\n*   $\\text{rank}(\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)) \\cdot \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X))$\n*   $\\text{rank}(\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)) = 1$\n*   $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)) = 52$\n\nSo, $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 1 \\cdot 52 = 52$.\n\n(For completeness, we confirm $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})=0$. The homology sequence is $H_4(X;\\mathbb{Q}) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3;\\mathbb{Q}) \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H_3(X;\\mathbb{Q})=0$. The map $i_*$ sends the fundamental class $[X]$ to $d \\cdot [\\text{hyperplane}]$, which is an isomorphism rationally. Thus $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$.)"
