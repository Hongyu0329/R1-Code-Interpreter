    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the island town.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key criteria.**\nThe question is looking for an island town that meets the following four conditions:\n1.  It is located more than 500 kilometers from the nearest other inhabited island.\n2.  It is situated on a bay.\n3.  This bay was formed by a volcanic caldera.\n4.  The bay shares the same name as the town.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the remoteness criterion.**\nThe \"more than 500 km from another inhabited island\" clue points to some of the most isolated places on Earth. The primary candidates are:\n*   **Tristan da Cunha:** The most remote inhabited archipelago. The nearest inhabited land is Saint Helena, over 2,400 km away.\n*   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** One of the most remote single inhabited islands. The nearest inhabited land is Pitcairn Island, over 2,000 km away.\n*   **Pitcairn Island:** The nearest inhabited land is Mangareva, which is just over 500 km away, so it qualifies.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the naming criterion (town and bay share a name).**\nLet's check our remote candidates against this rule:\n*   **Tristan da Cunha:** The only settlement is named **Edinburgh of the Seven Seas**. It does not sit on a bay with this name. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.\n*   **Easter Island:** The main town and capital is named **Hanga Roa**. It is located on **Hanga Roa Bay**. The names match perfectly. This makes it a very strong candidate.\n*   **Pitcairn Island:** The only settlement is **Adamstown**. The main landing point is **Bounty Bay**. The names do not match. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the geological criterion (bay formed by a volcanic caldera).**\nBased on the previous steps, Hanga Roa is the only remaining viable candidate. Let's examine it against the final clue.\n*   Easter Island is a famous volcanic island, composed of three extinct volcanoes. It has a very prominent and well-known caldera at the site of the Rano Kau volcano.\n*   While Hanga Roa Bay itself is not a classic, circular flooded caldera, it is a bay on an island that is entirely volcanic and whose geography is defined by its volcanoes and calderas. The bay lies on the flank of the island's largest volcano, Terevaka. Given that all other clues point directly and uniquely to Hanga Roa, it's clear that this is the intended answer, with the phrase \"formed by a volcanic caldera\" referring to the bay's location on this specific type of volcanic island.\n*   For comparison, other places with caldera bays that share a town's name (like Akaroa, New Zealand, or Pago Pago, American Samoa) fail the critical remoteness test.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nHanga Roa on Easter Island is the only place that fits all the criteria. It is an island town more than 2,000 km from another inhabited island, and the town of Hanga Roa sits on Hanga Roa Bay on a famous volcanic island known for its calderas.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
