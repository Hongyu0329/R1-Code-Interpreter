    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry is specified, indicating a particular three-dimensional arrangement.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). This is a polar protic solvent, which is the conjugate acid of the base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base strongly suggests an elimination reaction. The strong base favors the bimolecular E2 mechanism over the E1 mechanism. The bulky nature of the base also disfavors the competing SN2 substitution reaction. Therefore, this is an E2 elimination reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\n*   The E2 mechanism is a concerted (one-step) process where the base removes a proton, the C-H bond breaks, a pi bond forms, and the leaving group departs simultaneously.\n*   This mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the proton being removed and the leaving group must be **anti-periplanar**. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means they must be in a **trans-diaxial** arrangement (one axial-up, the other axial-down).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane**\n*   First, we determine the relative orientation of the bromine and methyl groups. The (1S,2R) designation means the two substituents are on opposite sides of the ring, i.e., they are **trans** to each other.\n*   A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations: one where both substituents are axial (diaxial) and one where both are equatorial (diequatorial).\n*   **Conformation A (diequatorial):** The bromine atom is equatorial, and the methyl group is equatorial. This is the **more stable** conformation because bulky groups prefer the less crowded equatorial positions to avoid 1,3-diaxial steric strain.\n*   **Conformation B (diaxial):** The bromine atom is axial, and the methyl group is axial. This is the **less stable** conformation due to significant steric strain.\n\n**Step 4: Determine which Conformation can Undergo E2 Elimination**\n*   The reaction must proceed from a conformation where the leaving group (Br) is **axial**.\n*   **Conformation A (diequatorial):** The Br is equatorial. It is not anti-periplanar to any adjacent hydrogens. Therefore, **E2 elimination cannot occur from this stable conformation.**\n*   **Conformation B (diaxial):** The Br is axial. This conformation can undergo E2 elimination, provided there is an axial hydrogen on an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6).\n*   Although Conformation B is less stable and present in a lower concentration at equilibrium, the ring flip is rapid. As Conformation B reacts to form the product, the equilibrium will shift (Le Ch√¢telier's principle) to produce more of it. The reaction proceeds exclusively through this less stable but reactive conformer.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Site of Proton Removal in the Reactive Conformation**\n*   Let's analyze the reactive diaxial conformation (Conformation B). Let's assume the axial Br is \"up\". Since the methyl group is trans, it must be \"down\" and axial on the adjacent carbon (C2).\n*   We need to find a hydrogen that is anti-periplanar (i.e., axial and \"down\") to the \"up\" axial bromine.\n*   **At C2:** The methyl group is in the axial \"down\" position. Therefore, the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial \"up\" position. This hydrogen is *not* anti-periplanar to the bromine. So, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 is **not possible**.\n*   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen is \"down\". This hydrogen **is** anti-periplanar to the \"up\" axial bromine.\n*   **Conclusion:** The tert-butoxide base can only remove the axial hydrogen from C6.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Final Product**\n*   Since the elimination involves C1 (where Br was) and C6, the double bond will form between these two carbons. The methyl group remains on C2.\n*   The resulting alkene is named by giving the double bond the lowest possible numbers. If the double bond is between original C1 and C6, these become C1 and C2 in the product name. The methyl group is on the adjacent carbon (original C2), which is now C3.\n*   Therefore, the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n1.  Recognize the reaction is E2.\n2.  The key to solving the problem is the strict trans-diaxial requirement for E2 elimination in cyclohexanes.\n3.  The (1S,2R) stereochemistry indicates a *trans* relationship between Br and CH3.\n4.  The reaction must proceed through the less stable diaxial conformer, as the more stable diequatorial conformer is unreactive under E2 conditions.\n5.  In the reactive diaxial conformer, stereochemistry dictates that only the proton on C6 is anti-periplanar to the bromine, forcing the formation of the less substituted alkene (Hofmann-type product).\n6.  The stereochemical constraint overrides the usual Zaitsev's rule (which would predict the more substituted 1-methylcyclohexene).\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
