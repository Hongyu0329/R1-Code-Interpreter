    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given SKI combinator expression.\n\n**1. Understand the SKI Combinator Rules**\nThe behavior of the expression is determined by the reduction rules for the three basic combinators S, K, and I:\n*   `S f g x = f x (g x)`\n*   `K x y = x`\n*   `I x = x`\nFunction application is left-associative, meaning `f x y` is parsed as `(f x) y`.\n\n**2. Understand Church Numerals**\nChurch numerals are a representation of natural numbers using higher-order functions. The Church numeral for a number `n` is a function that takes another function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x` `n` times.\n*   `n = \\f x. f^n(x) = \\f x. f(f(...f(x)...))`\nFor example:\n*   `0 = \\f x. x`\n*   `1 = \\f x. f(x)`\n*   `2 = \\f x. f(f(x))`\n\n**3. Deconstruct the Expression**\nLet's break down the given expression into smaller, manageable parts.\nThe full expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n\nLet's identify recurring patterns and assign them names:\n*   Let `M = S(I)`. Applying the `S` rule: `M x = S I x = I x (x) = x x`. This is the self-application combinator.\n*   Let `Z = S(S(K(S))(K))`. This is a more complex term. Let's analyze it in the context of Church arithmetic.\n\n**4. Identify `Z` as the Successor Function (`SUCC`)**\nThe successor function, `SUCC`, takes a Church numeral `n` and returns `n+1`.\n`SUCC n = \\f x. f(n f x) = \\f x. f^{n+1}(x)`\nLet's see if `Z` is `SUCC`.\n*   First, let's identify `B = S(K S) K`. `B f g x = f(g x)`, which is the function composition combinator. The expression contains `S(K(S))(K)`, which is equivalent to `B`.\n*   So, `Z = S B`.\n*   Let's apply `Z` to a Church numeral `n`: `Z n = S B n`.\n*   By the `S` rule, `(S B n) f = (B f) (n f)`.\n*   `B f` is the function that composes `f` with its argument: `(B f) g = f . g`.\n*   `n f` is the function `\\x. f^n(x)`.\n*   So, `(B f) (n f)` is the composition `f . (n f)`.\n*   This composition, when applied to `x`, gives `f((n f) x) = f(f^n(x)) = f^{n+1}(x)`.\n*   So, `(S B n) f = \\x. f^{n+1}(x)`.\n*   This means `S B n = \\f x. f^{n+1}(x)`, which is the definition of the Church numeral `n+1`.\n*   Therefore, `Z n = n+1`. `Z` is indeed the successor function, `SUCC`.\n\n**5. Evaluate Sub-expressions**\nNow we can substitute `M` and `SUCC` into the expression and evaluate its parts. The structure is `M (Arg1) (Arg2)`. Due to left-associativity, this is `(M Arg1) Arg2`, which reduces to `(Arg1 Arg1) Arg2`.\n\n*   **Evaluate `Arg2`**:\n    *   `Arg2 = Z (S(I)(I))`\n    *   `S(I)(I) = M I = I I = I`.\n    *   In the context of Church numerals, `I` represents the number 1 (`I f x = f x`, which is `f^1(x)`).\n    *   So, `Arg2 = Z(1) = SUCC(1) = 2`.\n\n*   **Evaluate `Arg1`**:\n    *   `Arg1 = S(I) (S(I) (K(Z(I))))`\n    *   `Z(I) = SUCC(1) = 2`.\n    *   `K(Z(I)) = K(2)`.\n    *   `Arg1 = S(I) (S(I) (K(2))) = M(M(K(2)))`.\n    *   Let's evaluate from the inside: `M(K(2)) = (K 2) (K 2)`.\n    *   By the `K` rule, `K 2 x = 2`. So `(K 2) (K 2)` evaluates to `2`.\n    *   Now, `Arg1 = M(2) = 2 2`.\n\n*   **Application of Church Numerals is Exponentiation**:\n    We need to evaluate `2 2`. What does applying one Church numeral to another mean?\n    Let's evaluate `m n`:\n    `m n = (\\f x. f^m x) n`. Here, `n` takes the place of `f`.\n    `m n = \\x. n^m x`.\n    Let's see what numeral this corresponds to. We apply it to a function `g` and value `y`:\n    `(m n) g y = (\\x. n^m x) g y = (n^m g) y`.\n    Through induction, it can be shown that `(n^m g) y = g^{n^m} y`.\n    So, `m n` represents the Church numeral `n^m`. Application is exponentiation, with the first numeral (`m`) as the exponent and the second (`n`) as the base.\n\n*   **Continue Evaluating `Arg1`**:\n    *   `Arg1 = 2 2`. Using the exponentiation rule, this is `2^2 = 4`.\n    *   So, `Arg1 = 4`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value `n`**\nWe have the final structure `(Arg1 Arg1) Arg2` with `Arg1 = 4` and `Arg2 = 2`.\n*   `n = (4 4) 2`.\n*   First, evaluate `(4 4)`. This is `4^4 = 256`.\n*   Now we have `n = 256 2`.\n*   This evaluates to `2^{256}`.\n*   So, the Church numeral `n` is `2^{256}`.\n\n**7. Find `log_2(n)`**\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n*   `n = 2^{256}`\n*   `log_2(n) = log_2(2^{256})`\n*   Using the logarithm property `log_b(b^x) = x`, we get:\n*   `log_2(n) = 256`\n\n<<<256>>>"
