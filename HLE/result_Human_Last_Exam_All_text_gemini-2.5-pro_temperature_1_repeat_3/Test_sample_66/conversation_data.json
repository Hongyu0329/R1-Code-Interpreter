    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Model the Flag as a Matrix\nLet the image of the flag of Tonga be represented by an `m x n` matrix `M`. The flag has a red field with a white canton in the top-left corner. The canton itself contains a red cross.\nWe assign a value `a` to every red pixel and `b` to every white pixel.\n-   `M(i, j) = a` if the pixel `(i, j)` is red.\n-   `M(i, j) = b` if the pixel `(i, j)` is white.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should assume `a` and `b` are distinct, i.e., `a ≠ b`. If `a = b`, the matrix `M` would be a constant matrix, having a rank of 1 (if `a ≠ 0`) or 0 (if `a = 0`).\n\nThe matrix `M` can be represented in a block structure. Let the canton have dimensions `m_c x n_c`.\n`M = [[A, B], [C, D]]`\n-   `A` is the `m_c x n_c` submatrix corresponding to the canton. Its entries are a mix of `a` (for the red cross) and `b` (for the white background).\n-   `B`, `C`, and `D` are the submatrices for the rest of the flag, which is all red. Thus, all entries in `B`, `C`, and `D` are `a`.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Matrix using Rank-Preserving Operations\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row and column operations. We can use this to simplify `M`. Let's assume `a ≠ 0` to avoid trivial cases and to maximize the rank.\n\n1.  Consider the rows from `m_c + 1` to `m`. All these rows are identical, consisting entirely of `a`'s: `[a, a, ..., a]`.\n2.  Take the last row, `R_m`, which is `[a, a, ..., a]`.\n3.  For every other row `R_i` from `m_c + 1` to `m-1`, perform the operation `R_i ← R_i - R_m`. This will turn these `m - m_c - 1` rows into zero rows, which do not contribute to the rank.\n4.  After this, the block of rows from `m_c + 1` to `m` contributes exactly 1 to the rank (from the single non-zero row `R_m`).\n5.  Now, for the rows in the canton (`i = 1, ..., m_c`), perform the operation `R_i ← R_i - R_m`.\n    -   The original `i`-th row is `[A_i, B_i]`, where `A_i` is the `i`-th row of `A` and `B_i` is a row of `n-n_c` `a`'s.\n    -   The new `i`-th row becomes `[A_i, B_i] - [a, ..., a] = [A_i - a*J_{1,n_c}, a*J_{1,n-n_c} - a*J_{1,n-n_c}] = [A_i - a*J_{1,n_c}, 0]`.\n    where `J` denotes a matrix of ones.\n\nAfter these operations, the transformed matrix `M'` has the following structure:\n-   The top-left `m_c x n_c` block is `A - a*J`.\n-   The top-right `m_c x (n-n_c)` block is a zero matrix.\n-   Rows `m_c + 1` to `m-1` are zero rows.\n-   Row `m` is `[a, a, ..., a]`.\n\nThe rank of `M` is the rank of `M'`. The last row of `M'` is linearly independent of the first `m_c` rows (since the first `m_c` rows are zero in the last `n-n_c` columns, while the last row is not, assuming `n > n_c` and `a ≠ 0`).\nTherefore, the rank of `M` is `1 + rank(submatrix corresponding to the first m_c rows)`.\n`rank(M) = 1 + rank([A - a*J, 0]) = 1 + rank(A - a*J)`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Rank of `A - a*J`\nLet's analyze the matrix `A' = A - a*J`.\n-   For pixels on the red cross in the canton, `A(i, j) = a`. So `A'(i, j) = a - a = 0`.\n-   For pixels on the white background of the canton, `A(i, j) = b`. So `A'(i, j) = b - a`.\n\nSince `a ≠ b`, `b-a ≠ 0`. Let `k = b-a`. The matrix `A'` is `k` times a binary matrix, let's call it `C`, where `C(i, j) = 0` for the red cross and `C(i, j) = 1` for the white background.\n`rank(A') = rank(k*C) = rank(C)`.\nSo, `rank(M) = 1 + rank(C)`. To maximize `rank(M)`, we need to maximize `rank(C)`.\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the Rank of the Canton Matrix `C`\nThe matrix `C` is a binary matrix representing the white background of the canton. The red cross on the flag of Tonga is a Greek cross, formed by the union of a horizontal rectangular bar and a vertical rectangular bar.\n\nLet the canton have `m_c` rows and `n_c` columns.\n-   Let the horizontal bar of the cross occupy rows `H` and columns `C_h`.\n-   Let the vertical bar of the cross occupy rows `R_v` and columns `V`.\n\nA pixel `(i, j)` is on the cross if `(i ∈ H and j ∈ C_h)` or `(i ∈ R_v and j ∈ V)`.\n`C(i, j) = 0` if `(i, j)` is on the cross, and `C(i, j) = 1` otherwise.\n\nLet's analyze the possible unique row vectors in `C`. A row `i` of `C` depends on whether `i` is in `H`, `R_v`, both, or neither.\n1.  **Case 1: `i ∉ H` and `i ∉ R_v`**. The row does not intersect the cross. All its entries are 1. Let this row vector be `v_1 = [1, 1, ..., 1]`.\n2.  **Case 2: `i ∈ H` but `i ∉ R_v`**. The row intersects only the horizontal bar. Its entries are 0 for columns in `C_h` and 1 otherwise. Let this vector be `v_H`.\n3.  **Case 3: `i ∈ R_v` but `i ∉ H`**. The row intersects only the vertical bar. Its entries are 0 for columns in `V` and 1 otherwise. Let this vector be `v_V`.\n4.  **Case 4: `i ∈ H` and `i ∈ R_v`**. The row intersects both bars. Its entries are 0 for columns in `C_h ∪ V` and 1 otherwise. Let this vector be `v_{HV}`.\n\nAny row in `C` must be one of these four types. Therefore, the row space of `C` is spanned by these four vectors, and `rank(C) ≤ 4`.\n\nTo show that `rank(C)` can be 4, we need to show that these four vector types can be linearly independent for a suitable choice of the canton and cross dimensions (which is possible since the problem refers to \"an image\", allowing us to choose the resolution). We can choose the sets of column indices `C_h` and `V` to be overlapping but not identical. We can also choose the sets of row indices `H` and `R_v` to be overlapping but not identical. This ensures that we can construct a matrix `C` containing at least one of each of the four row types.\n\nLet's prove the linear independence of `v_1, v_H, v_V, v_{HV}`. Let `X_O, X_H, X_V, X_{HV}` be characteristic vectors for the column partitions: outside `C_h \\cup V`, in `C_h \\setminus V`, in `V \\setminus C_h`, and in `C_h \\cap V`, respectively.\n-   `v_1 = X_O + X_H + X_V + X_{HV}`\n-   `v_H = X_O + X_V`\n-   `v_V = X_O + X_H`\n-   `v_{HV} = X_O`\nA linear combination `c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_H + c_3 v_V + c_4 v_{HV} = 0` leads to a system of equations for the coefficients of the basis vectors `X_*`.\n-   Coeff of `X_{HV}`: `c_1 = 0`.\n-   Coeff of `X_H`: `c_1 + c_3 = 0 ⇒ c_3 = 0`.\n-   Coeff of `X_V`: `c_1 + c_2 = 0 ⇒ c_2 = 0`.\n-   Coeff of `X_O`: `c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4 = 0 ⇒ c_4 = 0`.\nSince all coefficients must be zero, the four vectors are linearly independent.\n\nBy choosing a high-resolution image, we can construct the canton matrix `C` with at least one of each of these four types of rows, making its rank exactly 4.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nThe maximal rank of `C` is 4.\nThe maximal rank of the matrix `M` is given by `rank(M) = 1 + rank(C)`.\nMaximal rank = `1 + 4 = 5`.\n\nThis maximum is achieved when `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`. If `a = 0`, the rank would be `rank(C) = 4`, which is less than 5."
