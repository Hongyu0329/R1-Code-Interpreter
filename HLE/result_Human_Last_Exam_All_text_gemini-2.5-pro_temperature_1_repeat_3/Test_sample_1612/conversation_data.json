    "To determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball, we need to follow a clear, step-by-step process.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Triple Crown in MLB\n\nFirst, we must understand what constitutes a \"Triple Crown\" for a batter in Major League Baseball. A player achieves the Triple Crown by leading their respective league (American League or National League) in all three of the following statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (BA)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: List All Instances of a Triple Crown Win\n\nNext, we will compile a complete chronological list of every time a player has accomplished this feat. It's important to include players from early baseball history, including the American Association (AA), which MLB recognizes as a major league from 1882 to 1891.\n\nHere is the list of all Triple Crown seasons, broken down by league:\n\n**American Association (AA)**\n1.  **Tip O'Neill (1887)** - St. Louis Browns\n    *   BA: .435, HR: 14, RBI: 123\n\n**National League (NL)**\n1.  **Paul Hines (1878)** - Providence Grays\n    *   BA: .358, HR: 4, RBI: 50\n    *   *Careful Point:* The RBI was not an official stat in 1878, but retrospective analysis confirms Hines led the league, so he is included in modern lists.\n2.  **Hugh Duffy (1894)** - Boston Beaneaters\n    *   BA: .440, HR: 18, RBI: 145\n3.  **Heinie Zimmerman (1912)** - Chicago Cubs\n    *   BA: .372, HR: 14, RBI: 104\n4.  **Rogers Hornsby (1922)** - St. Louis Cardinals\n    *   BA: .401, HR: 42, RBI: 152\n5.  **Rogers Hornsby (1925)** - St. Louis Cardinals\n    *   BA: .403, HR: 39, RBI: 143\n6.  **Chuck Klein (1933)** - Philadelphia Phillies\n    *   BA: .368, HR: 28, RBI: 120\n    *   *Careful Point:* Klein tied with Mel Ott for the HR lead. A tie for a category lead still counts for the Triple Crown.\n7.  **Joe Medwick (1937)** - St. Louis Cardinals\n    *   BA: .374, HR: 31, RBI: 154 (This is the last NL Triple Crown to date).\n\n**American League (AL)**\n1.  **Nap Lajoie (1901)** - Philadelphia Athletics\n    *   BA: .426, HR: 14, RBI: 125\n2.  **Ty Cobb (1909)** - Detroit Tigers\n    *   BA: .377, HR: 9, RBI: 107\n3.  **Jimmie Foxx (1933)** - Philadelphia Athletics\n    *   BA: .356, HR: 48, RBI: 163\n4.  **Lou Gehrig (1934)** - New York Yankees\n    *   BA: .363, HR: 49, RBI: 166\n5.  **Ted Williams (1942)** - Boston Red Sox\n    *   BA: .356, HR: 36, RBI: 137\n6.  **Ted Williams (1947)** - Boston Red Sox\n    *   BA: .343, HR: 32, RBI: 114\n7.  **Mickey Mantle (1956)** - New York Yankees\n    *   BA: .353, HR: 52, RBI: 130\n8.  **Frank Robinson (1966)** - Baltimore Orioles\n    *   BA: .316, HR: 49, RBI: 122\n9.  **Carl Yastrzemski (1967)** - Boston Red Sox\n    *   BA: .326, HR: 44, RBI: 121\n    *   *Careful Point:* Yastrzemski tied with Harmon Killebrew for the HR lead.\n10. **Miguel Cabrera (2012)** - Detroit Tigers\n    *   BA: .330, HR: 44, RBI: 139 (This is the most recent Triple Crown in all of MLB).\n\n### Step 3: Count the Number of Unique Winners\n\nThe question asks for the number of \"Triple Crowns winners,\" which means we need to count the number of unique players who have won, not the total number of times the award has been won.\n\n*   From the list above, we can see that two players have won the Triple Crown twice:\n    *   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, 1925)\n    *   **Ted Williams** (1942, 1947)\n\n*   Now, we list each unique player once:\n    1.  Tip O'Neill\n    2.  Paul Hines\n    3.  Hugh Duffy\n    4.  Heinie Zimmerman\n    5.  Rogers Hornsby\n    6.  Chuck Klein\n    7.  Joe Medwick\n    8.  Nap Lajoie\n    9.  Ty Cobb\n    10. Jimmie Foxx\n    11. Lou Gehrig\n    12. Ted Williams\n    13. Mickey Mantle\n    14. Frank Robinson\n    15. Carl Yastrzemski\n    16. Miguel Cabrera\n\nCounting the names on this list gives us the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere have been a total of **16** unique players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<16>>>"
