    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID CHEMBL4803817.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Target Molecule (CHEMBL4803817)**\n\nFirst, we need to identify what the ChEMBL ID `CHEMBL4803817` represents. By querying the ChEMBL database, a public database of bioactive molecules, we can find the identity of this target.\n\n*   **ChEMBL ID:** CHEMBL4803817\n*   **Preferred Name:** SARS-CoV-2 main protease\n*   **Synonyms:** Mpro, 3CL-PRO, 3C-like proteinase\n*   **Target Type:** SINGLE PROTEIN\n*   **Organism:** Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify the target. `CHEMBL4803817` is not a small molecule itself but a macromolecular targetâ€”specifically, the main protease enzyme of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is essential for the virus's replication.\n\n**Step 2: Find Bioactivities Associated with the Target**\n\nThe next step is to find small molecules (ligands) that have been experimentally shown to interact with this protein target. In the ChEMBL database, these interactions are recorded as bioactivity data points. These data points quantify the effect of a small molecule on its target, with common measurements including:\n\n*   **IC50:** The concentration of a substance that is required for 50% inhibition of a biological process (in this case, the protease's enzymatic activity).\n*   **Ki:** The inhibition constant, representing the binding affinity of an inhibitor to an enzyme.\n*   **Kd:** The dissociation constant, indicating the binding affinity between a ligand and a protein.\n*   **% inhibition:** The percentage by which the enzyme's activity is reduced at a specific concentration of the compound.\n\nWe will search the ChEMBL database for all small molecules that have reported bioactivity data against the target `CHEMBL4803817`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The term \"protein-ligand interactions\" is broad. We are focusing on interactions that result in a measurable biological effect, such as inhibition, which is the most relevant type of interaction for a drug target like a protease.\n\n**Step 3: List Representative Interacting Small Molecules**\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 main protease has been a major focus of drug discovery since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, thousands of small molecules have been tested for their ability to inhibit this enzyme. Listing all of them would be impractical. Therefore, we will list a representative selection of well-known and significant small molecules that interact with this target. This list includes approved drugs, repurposed drugs, and key research compounds.\n\nHere are some prominent examples:\n\n1.  **Nirmatrelvir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4650630):** A potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor specifically designed to target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. It is the active component of the antiviral drug Paxlovid.\n2.  **Ensitrelvir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4868087):** Another potent inhibitor specifically developed for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, approved for use in Japan under the brand name Xocova.\n3.  **GC-376 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4296706):** A broad-spectrum coronavirus protease inhibitor, originally developed for feline infectious peritonitis. It served as a crucial chemical scaffold for the development of newer inhibitors like Nirmatrelvir.\n4.  **Boceprevir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL1605):** An antiviral drug originally used to treat Hepatitis C. It was identified through drug repurposing efforts as an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.\n5.  **Telaprevir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL1615):** Similar to Boceprevir, this is another Hepatitis C protease inhibitor that was found to have activity against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.\n6.  **PF-00835231 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4442890):** An early clinical candidate developed by Pfizer, designed for intravenous administration. It is a potent inhibitor and a precursor to the orally available Nirmatrelvir.\n7.  **Lopinavir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL864):** An HIV protease inhibitor that was investigated for repurposing against COVID-19. While it shows some weak in-vitro activity against the main protease, it was not found to be clinically effective.\n\n**Careful Point:** This list is not exhaustive but provides a diverse set of examples, including molecules specifically designed for the target and others identified through drug repurposing screens. The efficacy of these interactions varies significantly.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the following is a list of small molecules known to have protein-ligand interactions with CHEMBL4803817 (SARS-CoV-2 main protease).\n\n<<<[\n  {\"chembl_id\": \"CHEMBL4650630\", \"name\": \"Nirmatrelvir\"},\n  {\"chembl_id\": \"CHEMBL4868087\", \"name\": \"Ensitrelvir\"},\n  {\"chembl_id\": \"CHEMBL4296706\", \"name\": \"GC-376\"},\n  {\"chembl_id\": \"CHEMBL1605\", \"name\": \"Boceprevir\"},\n  {\"chembl_id\": \"CHEMBL1615\", \"name\": \"Telaprevir\"},\n  {\"chembl_id\": \"CHEMBL4442890\", \"name\": \"PF-00835231\"},\n  {\"chembl_id\": \"CHEMBL864\", \"name\": \"Lopinavir\"}\n]>>>"
