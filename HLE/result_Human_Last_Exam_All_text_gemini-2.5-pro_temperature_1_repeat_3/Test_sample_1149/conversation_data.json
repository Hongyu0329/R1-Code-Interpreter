    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for the specific number of depressions found within the lacrimal recess of the spinosaurid dinosaur, *Irritator challengeri*. This requires consulting detailed anatomical descriptions from paleontological research.\n\n2.  **Locate the Primary Source:** The primary and most detailed description of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* (holotype specimen SMNS 58022) is the paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott (2002), titled \"*Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\" This paper is the authoritative source for the skull's anatomy.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** Within the 2002 paper, the authors describe the lacrimal bone in detail. They state that the lateral (outer) surface of the lacrimal bone has a large, deep fossa (a fossa is a depression or hollow). This large fossa is the lacrimal recess itself.\n\n4.  **Identify Subdivisions within the Lacrimal Recess:** The crucial detail for answering the question lies in the description of the internal structure of this fossa. The paper states: \"The fossa itself is subdivided by a vertical lamina of bone into a larger anterior and a smaller posterior portion.\"\n\n5.  **Interpret the Description:**\n    *   There is one main lacrimal recess (fossa).\n    *   The question asks how many depressions this recess *contains*.\n    *   The scientific description explicitly states that this single recess is \"subdivided\" into two distinct \"portions\" (an anterior one and a posterior one).\n    *   These two subdivided portions are the depressions contained within the larger lacrimal recess.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** Based on the primary scientific literature describing the holotype specimen, the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* is a single large fossa that is internally divided, thus containing two smaller depressions.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Fossa vs. Depression:** The terms \"fossa\" and \"depression\" are largely interchangeable in this anatomical context.\n*   **Depressions vs. Foramina:** The paper also notes that each of the two depressions is pierced by a foramen (an opening). It is important not to confuse the depressions themselves with the openings within them. The question asks for depressions, not foramina.\n*   **Specificity of the Question:** The question is precise: \"how many depressions does the lacrimal recess... *contain*?\". This phrasing points to the internal subdivisions rather than counting the lacrimal recess as a single entity.\n\nTherefore, the lacrimal recess contains two depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
