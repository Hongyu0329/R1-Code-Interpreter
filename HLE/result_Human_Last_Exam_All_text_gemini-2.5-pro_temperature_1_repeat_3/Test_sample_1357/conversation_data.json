    "Answering this question requires combining the theory of stable reduction of curves with the theory of reduction of their Jacobians. We will proceed by analyzing the constraints imposed on the stable reduction by the given condition.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Core Condition:** Let $C$ be a genus 4 curve defined over a valuation field $K$. We are given that its Jacobian, $J(C)$, has **good reduction**. This is a very strong constraint. The Semistable Reduction Theorem of Deligne and Mumford states that after a possible finite extension of $K$, the curve $C$ acquires a *semistable model* $\\mathcal{C}$ over the valuation ring $R$ of $K$. Let $\\mathcal{C}_k$ be the special fiber of this model, which is the stable reduction of $C$.\n\n2.  **Relating Jacobian Reduction to Curve Reduction:** The theory of Néron models and Picard schemes connects the reduction of the Jacobian to the structure of the stable reduction $\\mathcal{C}_k$. The Néron model of $J(C)$ over $R$ has a special fiber which is isomorphic to the generalized Jacobian of $\\mathcal{C}_k$. The condition that $J(C)$ has good reduction means that the special fiber of its Néron model is a proper abelian variety (of dimension 4). For the generalized Jacobian of $\\mathcal{C}_k$ to be a proper abelian variety, its toric part must be trivial (i.e., have dimension 0).\n\n3.  **The Dual Graph Constraint:** The dimension of the toric part of the generalized Jacobian of a semistable curve $\\mathcal{C}_k$ is given by the first Betti number, $b_1(\\Gamma)$, of the dual graph $\\Gamma$ of $\\mathcal{C}_k$. The dual graph has vertices corresponding to the irreducible components of $\\mathcal{C}_k$ and edges corresponding to the nodes connecting them. The condition that the toric part is trivial translates to $b_1(\\Gamma) = 0$. For a connected graph $\\Gamma$, this is equivalent to the condition that **the dual graph $\\Gamma$ must be a tree**.\n\n4.  **The Genus Constraint:** A fundamental property of a stable model is that the arithmetic genus is constant across the fibers. Thus, the arithmetic genus of the special fiber $\\mathcal{C}_k$ must be equal to the genus of the generic fiber $C$, which is 4. The formula for the arithmetic genus of a semistable curve $\\mathcal{C}_k$ with $n$ components $E_1, \\dots, E_n$ having geometric genera $g_1, \\dots, g_n$ and $\\delta$ nodes is:\n    $p_a(\\mathcal{C}_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + \\delta - n + 1$.\n    Since $\\Gamma$ is a tree, the number of nodes (edges) $\\delta$ is related to the number of components (vertices) $n$ by $\\delta = n - 1$. Substituting this into the genus formula:\n    $4 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + (n-1) - n + 1$\n    This simplifies to **$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i = 4$**.\n    The problem is now reduced to a combinatorial one: find the number of distinct types of stable curves whose components have geometric genera summing to 4 and whose dual graph is a tree.\n\n5.  **The Stability Constraint:** A crucial point for the \"stable\" reduction is the stability condition on the components themselves. Specifically, if a component $E_i$ is a rational curve (a copy of $\\mathbb{P}^1$, so its geometric genus is $g_i=0$), it must be attached to the other components at a minimum of 3 points (nodes). In terms of the dual graph, this means **any vertex corresponding to a component of genus 0 must have a degree of at least 3**.\n\n**Enumeration of all possible types:**\n\nWe classify the possibilities based on the partitions of the number 4 into a sum of non-negative integers $\\{g_i\\}$, which represent the genera of the components. A \"type\" is defined by the dual graph structure and the assignment of genera to its vertices.\n\n**Case 1: No components of genus 0.**\nThe sum of the genera of the components is 4.\n*   **Partition {4}**: One component of genus 4. The dual graph is a single vertex. This is the case of good reduction. (1 type)\n*   **Partition {3,1}**: Two components, of genus 3 and 1. The dual graph is a tree with 2 vertices, which is a single edge. (1 type)\n*   **Partition {2,2}**: Two components, both of genus 2. The dual graph is a single edge. (1 type)\n*   **Partition {2,1,1}**: Three components of genera 2, 1, and 1. The dual graph is a tree on 3 vertices, which is a path `o-o-o`. The genus 2 component can be in the middle or at an end, giving two distinct configurations. (2 types)\n*   **Partition {1,1,1,1}**: Four components, all of genus 1. There are two non-isomorphic trees on 4 vertices: the path graph and the star graph. (2 types)\nTotal for Case 1: $1+1+1+2+2 = 7$ types.\n\n**Case 2: One component of genus 0.**\nThe sum of the genera of the other components must be 4. The genus 0 component's vertex in the dual graph must have degree $\\ge 3$.\n*   **Genera {4,0}, {3,1,0}, {2,2,0}**: These would require trees on 2 or 3 vertices. The maximum degree in such trees is 1 or 2, respectively. So these are impossible.\n*   **Genera {2,1,1,0}**: Four components. The dual graph is a tree on 4 vertices. To have a vertex of degree $\\ge 3$, the tree must be the star graph. The central vertex (degree 3) must be the genus 0 component. The three leaves are the components of genus 2, 1, and 1. This is a unique configuration. (1 type)\n*   **Genera {1,1,1,1,0}**: Five components. The dual graph is a tree on 5 vertices with a vertex of degree $\\ge 3$. There are two such trees:\n    1.  The star graph with a central vertex of degree 4. The genus 0 component must be at the center. (1 type)\n    2.  The \"fork\" graph, with one vertex of degree 3. The genus 0 component must be at this vertex. (1 type)\nTotal for Case 2: $1+1+1 = 3$ types.\n\n**Case 3: Two components of genus 0.**\nBoth corresponding vertices in the dual graph must have degree $\\ge 3$.\n*   The sum of genera of the other components must be 4. The minimal partition is {1,1,1,1}. This gives a total of $4+2=6$ components.\n*   **Genera {1,1,1,1,0,0}**: We need a tree on 6 vertices with at least two vertices of degree $\\ge 3$. Such a tree exists: two central vertices of degree 3 connected to each other, with each also connected to two leaves. The two degree-3 vertices must be the genus 0 components, and the four leaves must be the genus 1 components. This is a unique configuration. (1 type)\n\n**Case 4: Three or more components of genus 0.**\n*   The sum of genera of the other components must be 4. Minimal partition {1,1,1,1}. Total components $n \\ge 4+3=7$. We would need a tree on $n \\ge 7$ vertices with at least 3 vertices of degree $\\ge 3$.\n*   For $n=7$, the sum of degrees is $2(n-1)=12$. If there are three vertices of degree $\\ge 3$, their degrees sum to at least 9. The remaining four vertices must have a sum of degrees of at most $12-9=3$. This is impossible, as each of the four vertices must have degree at least 1. Thus, no such configurations exist.\n\n**Final Count:**\nSumming up the types from all possible cases:\n*   Case 1: 7 types\n*   Case 2: 3 types\n*   Case 3: 1 type\n*   Case 4: 0 types\n\nThe total number of types of stable reductions is $7 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\n<<<11>>>"
