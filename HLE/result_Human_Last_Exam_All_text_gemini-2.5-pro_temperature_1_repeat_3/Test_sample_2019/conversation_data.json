    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Board and Attacking Rules\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This means the board wraps around on all sides. We can represent the squares by coordinates (r, c) where r (row) and c (column) are integers from 0 to 4.\n*   **Toroidal Attack:** A queen at (r, c) attacks any square (r', c') if they are on the same:\n    1.  **Row:** `r' = r`\n    2.  **Column:** `c' = c`\n    3.  **Main Diagonal:** `(r' - c') mod 5 = (r - c) mod 5`\n    4.  **Anti-Diagonal:** `(r' + c') mod 5 = (r + c) mod 5`\n\n*   **Non-Attacking Condition:** For a set of 4 queens placed at `(r_1, c_1), (r_2, c_2), (r_3, c_3), (r_4, c_4)`, the following must be true for any pair of queens `i` and `j`:\n    *   All four row values `{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4}` must be distinct.\n    *   All four column values `{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4}` must be distinct.\n    *   All four main diagonal indices `{(r_i - c_i) mod 5}` must be distinct.\n    *   All four anti-diagonal indices `{(r_i + c_i) mod 5}` must be distinct.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the 4-Queen Problem to the 5-Queen Problem\n\nThis problem is an instance of the `k`-queens problem on an `n x n` toroidal board, with `n=5` and `k=4`. A key mathematical result, first shown by George Pólya, greatly simplifies this kind of problem when `n` is a prime number.\n\n**Pólya's Theorem (for prime n):** On an `n x n` toroidal board where `n` is a prime number, any configuration of `n-1` non-attacking queens can be uniquely extended to a full `n`-queen non-attacking configuration.\n\nLet's verify this for our case (n=5):\n*   Suppose we have 4 non-attacking queens. This means we have used 4 distinct rows, 4 distinct columns, 4 distinct main diagonals, and 4 distinct anti-diagonals.\n*   Since there are 5 of each type in total (rows 0-4, cols 0-4, etc.), there must be exactly one unused row (`r_u`), one unused column (`c_u`), one unused main diagonal (`d_u`), and one unused anti-diagonal (`a_u`).\n*   The theorem states that placing a fifth queen at the intersection of the unused row and column, `(r_u, c_u)`, will precisely occupy the unused diagonals `d_u` and `a_u`. That is, `(r_u - c_u) mod 5 = d_u` and `(r_u + c_u) mod 5 = a_u`.\n*   This establishes a one-to-one correspondence: every valid 4-queen configuration corresponds to exactly one valid 5-queen configuration (from which it was formed by removing one queen).\n\nThis means we can find the number of 4-queen configurations by first finding the number of 5-queen configurations and then multiplying by the number of ways to remove one queen.\n\n**Number of 4-queen configs = (Number of 5-queen configs) × 5**\n\n### Step 3: Count the Number of 5-Queen Configurations\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. This is equivalent to finding a permutation `p` of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` that defines the queen positions as `(i, p(i))` for `i=0..4`, such that the diagonal constraints are met.\n\nFor a prime `n`, it is known that all `n`-queen solutions on a toroidal board are \"linear,\" meaning the column `p(i)` is a linear function of the row `i`:\n`p(i) = a*i + b (mod 5)`\n\nLet's find the valid values for `a` and `b`:\n1.  **Column Constraint:** For `p(i)` to be a permutation (all columns distinct), `a` must be coprime to 5. The possible values for `a` are `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n2.  **Main Diagonal Constraint:** The values `i - p(i) = i - (ai + b) = (1-a)i - b` must be distinct. This requires `1-a` to be coprime to 5, which means `1-a ≠ 0 (mod 5)`, so `a ≠ 1`.\n3.  **Anti-Diagonal Constraint:** The values `i + p(i) = i + (ai + b) = (1+a)i + b` must be distinct. This requires `1+a` to be coprime to 5, which means `1+a ≠ 0 (mod 5)`, so `a ≠ -1 (mod 5)`, which means `a ≠ 4`.\n\nCombining these constraints, `a` cannot be 1 or 4. The only valid values for `a` are **2** and **3**.\nThe value `b` represents a simple shift of the entire configuration and can be any value from `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\n*   Number of choices for `a`: 2 (either 2 or 3)\n*   Number of choices for `b`: 5 (from 0 to 4)\n\nTotal number of 5-queen configurations = `2 * 5 = 10`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nNow we can calculate the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens.\n\n*   From Step 3, there are 10 distinct 5-queen configurations.\n*   From each 5-queen configuration, we can create a 4-queen configuration by removing any one of the 5 queens.\n*   As established in Step 2, this process generates every possible 4-queen configuration exactly once (no duplicates).\n\nNumber of ways = (Number of 5-queen configurations) × (Ways to remove 1 queen)\nNumber of ways = 10 × 5\nNumber of ways = 50\n\nThere are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
