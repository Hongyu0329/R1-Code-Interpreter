    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the first cube in a coordinate system.**\nLet's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a standard 3D Cartesian coordinate system. We can define its boundaries by placing one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and the opposite corner at (1,1,1).\nThus, Cube A is the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n*   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**Step 2: Understand and define the shift.**\nThe problem states the second cube is shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to the first.\n*   **Careful Point:** The \"main diagonal\" connects opposite vertices, in our case from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **Careful Point:** \"Shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most commonly interpreted in this context as a shift by the vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This means the displacement is 1/2 along each of the coordinate axes, resulting in a total displacement vector parallel to the main diagonal.\n\n**Step 3: Define the second cube.**\nThe second cube, Cube B, is simply Cube A translated by the shift vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). To find the boundaries of Cube B, we add 1/2 to the coordinates of Cube A.\nThus, Cube B is the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Step 4: Find the region of intersection.**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the volume that satisfies the conditions for both Cube A and Cube B. We need to find the common range for each coordinate.\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The point must be in the interval `[0, 1]` (from Cube A) AND in the interval `[1/2, 3/2]` (from Cube B). The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The point must be in the interval `[0, 1]` AND in the interval `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The point must be in the interval `[0, 1]` AND in the interval `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\nSo, the intersection is a smaller cube defined by:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\nThe intersection is a cube. We can find its volume by calculating the length of its sides.\n*   Length of the side along the x-axis = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Length of the side along the y-axis = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Length of the side along the z-axis = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths:\nVolume = (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Coordinate System Setup:** Placing the first cube at the origin simplifies the problem significantly.\n2.  **Interpreting \"Shift along the Main Diagonal\":** The key is to understand that this implies a shift vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), not a shift distance of 1/2. A shift distance of 1/2 would result in a more complex shift vector `(1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3))` and a much more complicated answer. The standard interpretation leads to a clean, simple result.\n3.  **Finding the Intersection Region:** This is done by finding the intersection of the coordinate intervals for each axis independently.\n4.  **Identifying the Shape of the Intersection:** The resulting region is a smaller cube, making the final volume calculation straightforward.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe volume of the intersection is calculated as follows:\nThe first cube occupies the region `[0,1] x [0,1] x [0,1]`.\nThe second cube, shifted by (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), occupies the region `[1/2, 3/2] x [1/2, 3/2] x [1/2, 3/2]`.\nThe intersection of these two regions is `[1/2, 1] x [1/2, 1] x [1/2, 1]`.\nThe side length of this intersection cube is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\nThe volume is `(1/2)^3 = 1/8`.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
