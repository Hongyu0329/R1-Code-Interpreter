The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by:

$Z = \int_{\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)} \mathcal{D}[\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)] \exp\left( -S[\psi^*, \psi] \right)$

where:
*   $\mathcal{D}[\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)]$ is the functional integration measure over all Grassmann field configurations.
*   $\psi(\tau)$ and $\psi^*(\tau)$ are anti-commuting Grassmann fields, which are functions of imaginary time $\tau$.
*   The subscript on the integral sign, $\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)$, explicitly denotes that the integration is performed only over fields that satisfy the **anti-periodic boundary conditions** required for fermions.
*   $S[\psi^*, \psi]$ is the Euclidean action, defined as:
    $S[\psi^*, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left[ \sum_k \psi_k^*(\tau) (\partial_\tau) \psi_k(\tau) + H(\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right]$
    Here, $\beta=1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature, and $H(\psi^*, \psi)$ is the Hamiltonian with fermion operators replaced by their corresponding Grassmann fields.
