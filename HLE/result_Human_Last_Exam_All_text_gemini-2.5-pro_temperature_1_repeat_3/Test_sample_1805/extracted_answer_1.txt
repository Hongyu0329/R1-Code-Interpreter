The result of applying the q-difference quotient $\nabla_q$ to the 0-form $T^n$ is given by:
$$ \nabla_q(T^n) = [n]_q T^{n-1} \nabla_q(T) $$
where $[n]_q$ is the q-integer defined as:
$$ [n]_q = \frac{q^n - 1}{q-1} = 1 + q + q^2 + \dots + q^{n-1} $$
and $\nabla_q(T)$ is the q-analogue of the 1-form $dT$.
