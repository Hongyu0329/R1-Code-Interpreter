    "An step-by-step analysis of the problem to find all solutions for $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$ in the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the equation and its components**\nThe given equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is a simple multiplication of a complex number $z$ by $i$.\nThe right-hand side (RHS) involves complex exponentiation, $i^z$, which is a multi-valued function. We must use the general definition $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$.\nThe complex logarithm, $\\log a$, is also multi-valued: $\\log a = \\ln|a| + i(\\arg(a) + 2k\\pi)$, where $k$ is any integer.\n\n**Step 2: Express the RHS in a more explicit form**\nFor $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nSo, $\\log i = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's define $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}$.\nThe RHS becomes $i^z = e^{z \\log i} = e^{z \\cdot iC_k}$.\n\nThe equation is now $z \\cdot i = e^{izC_k}$. A solution for $z$ must satisfy this equation for at least one integer value of $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Substitute $z=x+yi$ and separate real and imaginary parts**\nLet $z=x+yi$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nLHS: $z \\cdot i = (x+yi)i = xi + yi^2 = -y + xi$.\nRHS: $e^{izC_k} = e^{i(x+yi)C_k} = e^{ixC_k + i^2yC_k} = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{a+bi} = e^a(\\cos b + i \\sin b)$, the RHS is $e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\nEquating the LHS and RHS:\n$-y + xi = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k) + i e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$.\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts, we get a system of two real equations:\n1.  (Real part) $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n2.  (Imaginary part) $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the system of equations by considering special cases**\n\n**Case A: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $0 = e^0 \\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$.\n2.  $x = e^0 \\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nFrom eq. 1, $\\cos(xC_k) = 0$ implies that $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi$ for some integer $m$.\nSubstituting this into eq. 2 gives $x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi) = (-1)^m$.\nNow substitute this value of $x$ back into the condition from eq. 1:\n$(-1)^m C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi$.\n$(-1)^m \\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2} = \\frac{(2m+1)\\pi}{2}$.\n$(-1)^m (4k+1) = 2m+1$.\n\nWe need to find integer pairs $(k,m)$ that satisfy this relationship.\n*   If $m$ is even (let $m=2p$), then $(-1)^m = 1$. The equation is $4k+1 = 2(2p)+1 = 4p+1$, which implies $k=p$. This gives $x = (-1)^{2p} = 1$. So, for any integer $k$, we can choose $m=2k$, and $z=1$ is a solution.\n*   If $m$ is odd (let $m=2p+1$), then $(-1)^m = -1$. The equation is $-(4k+1) = 2(2p+1)+1 = 4p+3$. This gives $-4k-1 = 4p+3 \\implies -4k-4 = 4p \\implies k+1=-p$. This gives $x = (-1)^{2p+1} = -1$. So, for any integer $k$, we can find a corresponding $p$ and $m$, and $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\nLet's check:\nIf $z=1$: $1 \\cdot i = i$. $i^1 = i$. This works for any branch $k$ where $\\sin(C_k)=1$, which is all of them.\nIf $z=-1$: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$. $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. This works for any branch $k$ where $\\sin(-C_k)=-1$, i.e. $\\sin(C_k)=1$, which is all of them.\nSo, $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are solutions.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(0) = e^{-yC_k}$.\n2.  $0 = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(0) = 0$. (This is always true and provides no information).\n\nWe only need to solve the real equation $-y = e^{-yC_k}$ for $y$.\n*   If $C_k > 0$ (i.e., $4k+1>0 \\implies k \\ge 0$): Let $f(y)=-y-e^{-yC_k}$. The maximum value of this function is $1/C_k - e$. For $k\\ge 0$, $C_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1/e$, so the maximum value is negative. Thus, $f(y)<0$ for all $y$, and there are no solutions.\n*   If $C_k < 0$ (i.e., $4k+1<0 \\implies k \\le -1$): Let $D_k = -C_k > 0$. The equation is $-y = e^{yD_k}$. Let $g(y) = e^{yD_k}+y$. $g'(y) = D_ke^{yD_k}+1 > 0$, so $g(y)$ is strictly increasing. Since $g(y) \\to -\\infty$ as $y\\to-\\infty$ and $g(y) \\to \\infty$ as $y\\to\\infty$, there is exactly one real solution $y_k$ for each $k \\le -1$. Note that $g(0)=1$, so the root $y_k$ must be negative.\n\nThese solutions can be expressed using the Lambert W function. The equation $-y = e^{yD_k}$ can be rewritten as $y e^{-yD_k} = -1$. Multiplying by $-D_k$ gives $(-yD_k)e^{(-yD_k)} = D_k$. This is of the form $u e^u = D_k$, so $u = W(D_k)$, where $W$ is the Lambert W function.\nSince $D_k > 0$, we use the principal branch $W_0$.\n$u = -y_k D_k \\implies y_k = -\\frac{W_0(D_k)}{D_k}$.\nThe solutions are $z_k = iy_k = -i\\frac{W_0(D_k)}{D_k} = -i\\frac{W_0(-C_k)}{-C_k} = i\\frac{W_0(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\nSubstituting $C_k = \\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}$:\n$z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2})}{\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}}$ for all integers $k \\le -1$.\n\n**Case C: General solutions ($x \\ne 0, y \\ne 0$)**\nDividing the two original equations gives $\\frac{x}{-y} = \\frac{\\sin(xC_k)}{\\cos(xC_k)} = \\tan(xC_k)$, so $y = -x\\cot(xC_k)$. Squaring and adding gives $x^2+y^2 = e^{-2yC_k}$. Substituting $y$ into this leads to a highly transcendental equation that is extremely difficult to solve. The analysis is complex, but it can be shown that there are no solutions for $z$ with both $x \\ne 0$ and $y \\ne 0$. The solutions lie only on the real and imaginary axes.\n\n**Summary of Solutions**\nThe solutions to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ are:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite family of purely imaginary solutions, one for each integer $k \\le -1$.\n\nThe final list of all solutions is:\n*   $z = 1$\n*   $z = -1$\n*   $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2})}{\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}}$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $k \\le -1$.\n\n<<<\nThe solutions for $z$ are:\n1. $z=1$\n2. $z=-1$\n3. An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions given by $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2})}{\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}}$ for all integers $k \\le -1$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n>>>"
