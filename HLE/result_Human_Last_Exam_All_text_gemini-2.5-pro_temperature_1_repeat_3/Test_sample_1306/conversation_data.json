    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Representations\nThe algebra is $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (i.e., $q^3=1, q \\neq 1$). Let's set $l=3$. A key feature of the representation theory of this algebra is the role of its center. The elements $E^l, F^l, K^l$ (in our case $E^3, F^3, K^3$) generate a large subalgebra within the center of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nAny finite-dimensional indecomposable representation $V$ must be a generalized eigenspace for the center. Since we are over the algebraically closed field $\\mathbb{C}$, the central elements must act as scalars on $V$. That is, for each indecomposable representation $V$, there exist scalars $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that $E^3, F^3, K^3$ act on $V$ as multiplication by $a, b, c$ respectively. This allows us to partition the category of finite-dimensional representations into blocks $C_{(a,b,c)}$ based on these eigenvalues. The set $C$ of all indecomposable representations is the disjoint union of the sets of indecomposable representations in each block.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the Blocks\nThe structure of a block $C_{(a,b,c)}$ depends on the values of $a, b, c$.\n*   **Regular Blocks:** If the character $(a,b,c)$ is \"regular\", the corresponding block is semisimple. The condition for a character to be regular is essentially that $a \\neq 0$ and $b \\neq 0$. In this case, every indecomposable representation in the block is irreducible (simple). Each such block contains, up to a twist, a unique simple module of dimension $l=3$.\n*   **Singular Blocks:** If the character is \"singular\", the block is not semisimple. This happens if $a=0$ or $b=0$. These blocks contain indecomposable representations that are not irreducible.\n\nThe set of all central characters $(a,b,c)$ forms a 2-dimensional algebraic variety (a surface in $\\mathbb{C}^3$). The singular characters form a subvariety of dimension 1 (a curve on that surface).\n\n### Step 3: Classify Irreducible and Indecomposable Representations\nLet's list the types of indecomposable representations based on their block:\n\n1.  **Indecomposables in Regular Blocks:** These are parametrized by the regular central characters, which form a 2-dimensional variety. For each such character, there is a unique indecomposable module (up to twist), which is an irreducible 3-dimensional representation. This gives a 2-parameter family of irreducible modules.\n\n2.  **Indecomposables in Singular Blocks:** These blocks correspond to characters lying on a 1-dimensional subvariety of the character space.\n    *   **Case $a=0, b \\neq 0$ or $a \\neq 0, b=0$:** These blocks are representation-finite, meaning they contain a finite number of indecomposable modules. A crucial point is that none of these indecomposable modules are irreducible. An irreducible module must have a highest weight vector, which is annihilated by $E$. But if $E^3$ acts as a non-zero scalar $a$, $E$ is invertible, so it cannot annihilate any non-zero vector. Thus, there are no irreducible modules in these blocks. All indecomposables here are reducible.\n    *   **Case $a=0, b=0$:** This corresponds to a finite number of points on the singular curve. These blocks are for representations of the \"small quantum group\". For $l=3$, there are two such blocks, corresponding to $K^3=1$ (the principal block) and $K^3=-1$.\n        *   **Principal Block ($a=b=0, c=1$):** This block contains two irreducible representations, of dimension 1 and 2. However, the block is of tame representation type, which means it contains infinitely many indecomposable representations. Specifically, for each dimension $d \\ge 1$, there are at least two non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n        *   **Other 'very singular' block ($a=b=0, c=-1$):** Similar to the principal block, this block contains two irreducible representations (of dimensions 1 and 2) and infinitely many reducible indecomposable representations.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the \"Percentage\"\nThe question asks for the percentage of indecomposable objects that are irreducible. The total set of indecomposable objects $C$ is infinite, containing continuous families. A simple counting of elements is not possible. The question must be interpreted in terms of the parameter spaces that classify the representations.\n\n*   The **irreducible** modules consist of:\n    1.  A 2-parameter family of 3-dimensional modules (from the regular blocks).\n    2.  Four discrete modules of dimensions 1 and 2 (from the $a=b=0$ blocks).\n\n*   The **reducible indecomposable** modules consist of:\n    1.  A 1-parameter family of finite sets of modules (from singular blocks with $a=0, b\\neq 0$ or vice-versa).\n    2.  Two infinite towers of modules (from the $a=b=0$ blocks).\n\nThe parameter space for irreducible modules is dominated by the 2-dimensional family from the regular blocks. The parameter space for all reducible indecomposable modules is of dimension at most 1.\n\nWhen comparing sets described by algebraic varieties of different dimensions, the set with the higher dimension is overwhelmingly larger. The lower-dimensional set constitutes a \"measure zero\" subset of the whole.\n\nIn our case, the indecomposable modules that are irreducible are parametrized by a space of dimension 2. The indecomposable modules that are reducible are parametrized by a space of dimension 1.\nTherefore, the property of being irreducible applies to a \"Zariski-open\" and dense subset of the space of all indecomposable modules. In this context, this means that 100% of the objects have this property.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The vast majority of indecomposable representations are found in the regular blocks. In these blocks, every indecomposable representation is irreducible. The reducible indecomposable representations only occur in the singular blocks, which form a lower-dimensional subspace in the space of all possibilities. Hence, the percentage of indecomposable representations that are irreducible is 100%.\n\n>>>100"
