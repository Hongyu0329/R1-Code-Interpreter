    "Answering this question requires analyzing permutations with a specific number of inversions and a specific avoided pattern.\n\nLet \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\) be the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) with \\(k\\) inversions that avoid the pattern \\(\\sigma\\).\nWe need to find \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\nThis means \\(n = 333\\), \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\sigma = 1324\\).\n\nThe number \\(n=333\\) is very large. This suggests that the answer is likely independent of \\(n\\) for \\(n\\) greater than some small number. We are looking for the number of permutations with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nAn inversion in a permutation \\(\\pi\\) is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi_i > \\pi_j\\). A permutation has the 1324 pattern if there exist indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) such that \\(\\pi_{i_1} < \\pi_{i_3} < \\pi_{i_2} < \\pi_{i_4}\\).\n\nLet's classify the permutations \\(\\pi \\in S_n\\) with exactly 3 inversions. A permutation with a small number of inversions must be \"close\" to the identity permutation \\(12...n\\). Such permutations can be constructed by applying a small number of transpositions to the identity permutation. Any permutation with \\(k\\) inversions can be obtained from the identity by a sequence of \\(k\\) adjacent transpositions (swapping \\(\\pi_i\\) and \\(\\pi_{i+1}\\)).\n\nThe permutations with 3 inversions can be characterized by the structure of the elements that are not in their natural positions. For large \\(n\\), these structures are typically either \"local\" (involving a few consecutive elements) or \"spread out\" (involving elements far apart).\n\nLet's analyze the main structural types of permutations with 3 inversions and check if they avoid the 1324 pattern.\n\n**Type 1: Three disjoint adjacent swaps.**\nThese permutations have the form \\(... (i+1) i ... (j+1) j ... (l+1) l ...\\) where the three swapped pairs are disjoint. For large \\(n\\), we can easily pick indices to form a 1324 pattern. For example, let \\(i_1 = i+1, i_2 = j, i_3 = j+1\\). The corresponding values are \\(\\pi_{i+1}=i, \\pi_j=j+1, \\pi_{j+1}=j\\). We have a 132-like pattern \\(\\pi_{i+1} < \\pi_{i_3} < \\pi_{i_2}\\). We just need to find an index \\(i_4 > i_3\\) with \\(\\pi_{i_4} > \\pi_{i_2}\\). Since \\(n=333\\) is large, we can always find a fixed point \\(d > j+1\\), so \\(\\pi_d=d\\). Taking \\(i_4 = d\\), we get the subsequence of values \\((i, j+1, j, d)\\). For \\(d>j+1\\), the relative order is 1324. Thus, permutations of this type contain the 1324 pattern.\n\n**Type 2: A 3-element permutation and a disjoint 2-element permutation.**\nAn example is \\(...(c+2)c(c+1)...(d+1)d...\\). This permutation has 3 inversions (\\(c+2,c\\), \\(c+2, c+1\\) and \\(d+1,d\\)). Similar to Type 1, for large \\(n\\), we can choose elements from these blocks and a fixed point to form a 1324 pattern. The same construction as above works: choose the 132 pattern from the manipulated blocks and the 4 from a distant fixed point.\n\nThe permutations that avoid 1324 are typically those where the displaced elements are clustered together. A 1324 pattern requires four elements, and if the permutation is only \"disordered\" in a small local block, it might not be possible to form the pattern. Let's analyze these \"local\" permutations.\n\n**Type A: Permutation is \\(... (a+3) a (a+1) (a+2) ...\\)**\nThis is a permutation on 4 consecutive elements \\(\\{a, a+1, a+2, a+3\\}\\). The rest of the elements are fixed points. This permutation has exactly 3 inversions: \\((a+3, a), (a+3, a+1), (a+3, a+2)\\).\nDoes this type of permutation avoid 1324? Let's try to construct the pattern \\(\\pi_{i_1} < \\pi_{i_3} < \\pi_{i_2} < \\pi_{i_4}\\).\nLet's choose \\(i_1=a-1, i_2=a, i_3=a+1, i_4=a+4\\). For this to be possible, we need \\(a>1\\) and \\(a+4 \\le n\\).\nThe values are \\(\\pi_{a-1}=a-1\\), \\(\\pi_a=a+3\\), \\(\\pi_{a+1}=a\\), \\(\\pi_{a+4}=a+4\\).\nLet's check the condition: \\(a-1 < a < a+3 < a+4\\). This is true. So for \\(a \\in [2, n-4]\\), these permutations contain 1324.\nThe boundary cases are:\n1.  \\(a=1\\): The permutation is \\(4,1,2,3,5,6,...,n\\). The argument above fails as it requires \\(a-1\\). We can verify that this permutation avoids 1324. Any 132-pattern must involve the 4. But 4 cannot be the '1' or '2' in the 132 pattern. If it is the '3', say \\(\\pi_{i_2}=4\\), then \\(i_2=1\\), so no \\(i_1 < i_2\\) exists. Thus, no 132-pattern exists, and no 1324-pattern can be formed. (1 permutation)\n2.  \\(a=n-3\\): The permutation is \\(1,2,...,n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1\\). The argument fails as it requires \\(a+4 > n\\). We can verify this also avoids 1324. To form the pattern \\(\\pi_{i_1} < \\pi_{i_3} < \\pi_{i_2} < \\pi_{i_4}\\), the largest element \\(\\pi_{i_4}\\) must be greater than \\(\\pi_{i_2}\\). If we choose \\(\\pi_{i_2}=n\\), no such \\(\\pi_{i_4}\\) exists. If we choose \\(\\pi_{i_4}=n\\), then we need \\(\\pi_{i_1}<\\pi_{i_3}<\\pi_{i_2}<n\\). The indices \\(i_1,i_2,i_3\\) must be less than \\(n-3\\), where the permutation is the identity. This would require \\(i_1 < i_3 < i_2\\), which contradicts \\(i_1<i_2<i_3\\). So this also avoids 1324. (1 permutation)\nSo there are 2 permutations of Type A that avoid 1324.\n\n**Type E: Permutation is \\(... (c+2) (c+1) c ...\\)**\nThis is a reversal of 3 consecutive elements \\(\\{c, c+1, c+2\\}\\). This has 3 inversions: \\((c+2, c+1), (c+2, c), (c+1, c)\\).\nBy a similar argument as for Type A, these permutations contain 1324 for \\(c \\in [2, n-3]\\).\nThe boundary cases are:\n1.  \\(c=1\\): The permutation is \\(3,2,1,4,5,...,n\\). This permutation is 321-avoiding on any subsequence that does not fully contain \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\). Any 4-element subsequence is not a 1324 pattern. (1 permutation)\n2.  \\(c=n-2\\): The permutation is \\(1,2,...,n-3, n, n-1, n-2\\). This also avoids 1324 by an argument similar to case A.2. (1 permutation)\nSo there are 2 permutations of Type E that avoid 1324.\n\n**Type F: Permutation is \\(... (a+1) (a+2) (a+3) a ...\\)**\nThis corresponds to a cycle on 4 elements \\(\\{a,a+1,a+2,a+3\\}\\). The permutation is \\(a \\to a+1 \\to a+2 \\to a+3 \\to a\\). It has 3 inversions: \\((a+1, a), (a+2, a), (a+3, a)\\).\nAgain, one can show that for \\(a \\in [2, n-4]\\), these permutations contain 1324.\nThe boundary cases are:\n1.  \\(a=1\\): The permutation is \\(2,3,4,1,5,...,n\\). This avoids 1324. (1 permutation)\n2.  \\(a=n-3\\): The permutation is \\(1,2,...,n-4, n-2, n-1, n, n-3\\). This avoids 1324. (1 permutation)\nSo there are 2 permutations of Type F that avoid 1324.\n\nOther permutations with 3 inversions, such as those corresponding to the permutations 2413 and 3142 in \\(S_4\\), can be shown to contain the 1324 pattern for \\(n \\ge 5\\).\n\nFor \\(n=333\\), which is large enough for these arguments to hold, the number of 1324-avoiding permutations with 3 inversions is the sum of the permutations from these boundary cases.\n\nTotal number of such permutations = (Type A avoiders) + (Type E avoiders) + (Type F avoiders)\nTotal = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThe six permutations are:\n1.  \\(4,1,2,3,5,...,333\\)\n2.  \\(1,2,...,329, 333,330,331,332\\)\n3.  \\(3,2,1,4,5,...,333\\)\n4.  \\(1,2,...,330, 333,332,331\\)\n5.  \\(2,3,4,1,5,...,333\\)\n6.  \\(1,2,...,329, 331,332,333,330\\)\n\nThe number \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) is therefore 6."
