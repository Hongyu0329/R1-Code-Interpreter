    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are given a system of linear differential equations known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, which describe the probabilities $P_i(t)$ of a system being in state $i$ at time $t$. The system has four states (0, 1, 2, 3). We need to find the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$, which represents the sum of the steady-state probabilities for states 0 and 1.\n\n**2. Steady-State Analysis**\n\nThe steady-state probabilities, denoted as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, are the limiting values of the probabilities as time $t$ approaches infinity. In the steady state, the probabilities are constant, which means their time derivatives are zero.\nSo, we set $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i=0, 1, 2, 3$.\n\n**3. Formulating the Steady-State Equations**\n\nBy setting the derivatives to zero and replacing $P_i(t)$ with $\\pi_i$ in the given system, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n\nThe conservation of probability condition also holds in the steady state:\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\nNote that the first four equations are linearly dependent (their sum is $0=0$). Therefore, we will use three of them (e.g., equations 1, 3, and 4) along with the normalization equation (5) to solve for the four unknown probabilities.\n\n**4. Solving the System of Equations**\n\nOur goal is to express $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_2$, and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} = \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1} \\implies \\pi_{0} = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}}\\pi_{1}$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$\\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} = (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2} \\implies \\pi_{2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}}\\pi_{1}$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$\\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} = \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3} \\implies \\pi_{3} = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}}\\pi_{2}$\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\pi_2$ into this equation:\n$\\pi_{3} = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} \\right) \\pi_{1}$\n\n**5. Substituting Numerical Values**\n\nLet's substitute the given values for the transition rates $\\lambda_{ij}$:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\n*   For $\\pi_0$:\n    $\\pi_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_{1}$\n\n*   For $\\pi_2$:\n    $\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23} = 0.392 + 0.008 = 0.4$\n    $\\pi_{2} = \\frac{0.4}{0.4}\\pi_{1} = \\pi_{1}$\n\n*   For $\\pi_3$:\n    $\\pi_{3} = \\frac{0.008}{0.008}\\pi_{2} = \\pi_{2}$. Since $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$, we have $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$.\n\n**6. Using the Normalization Condition**\n\nNow substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_{1}\\right) + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right)\\pi_{1} = 1$\n\nTo solve for $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_{1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65 + 3(0.019)}{0.019}} = \\frac{0.019}{0.65 + 0.057} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**7. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, which is $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\nWe know $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_{1}$.\nSo, $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_{1} + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1\\right)\\pi_{1}$.\n\nLet's simplify the term in the parenthesis:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.019} = \\frac{0.669}{0.019}$\n\nNow substitute the value of $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.669}{0.019}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.019}{0.707}\\right)$\n\nThe $0.019$ terms cancel out:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nPerforming the final division:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to four decimal places, the result is 0.9463.\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
