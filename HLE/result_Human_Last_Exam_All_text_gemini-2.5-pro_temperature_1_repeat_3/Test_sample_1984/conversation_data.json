    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the differential equation and the goal.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\nWe need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, which is denoted by $m$. After finding $m$, we must calculate the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points.**\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\nLet's set the right-hand side of the equation to zero:\n$-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0$\n\nTo solve for $x$, we can factor the polynomial. First, factor out $-x$:\n$-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\nThe expression inside the parentheses is a perfect square trinomial: $(x-1)^{2}$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$-x(x-1)^{2} = 0$\n\nThis equation gives us the equilibrium points:\n1.  $-x = 0 \\implies x = 0$\n2.  $(x-1)^{2} = 0 \\implies x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n\nThus, the equilibrium points are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\nTo determine the stability, we can analyze the sign of the function $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$ around each equilibrium point. This is often called a phase line analysis. The stability is determined by whether the solutions $x(t)$ move towards or away from the equilibrium point.\n\nLet's analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$:\n*   **Careful Point 1: The term $(x-1)^2$ is always non-negative.** This simplifies the sign analysis, as the sign of $f(x)$ will be the opposite of the sign of $x$ (for $x \\neq 1$).\n\nLet's test the intervals around the equilibrium points (0 and 1):\n*   **Interval 1: $x < 0$**\n    Let's pick a test value, e.g., $x = -1$.\n    $f(-1) = -(-1)(-1-1)^2 = 1(-2)^2 = 4$.\n    Since $f(x) > 0$, $x'(t) > 0$, which means the solution $x(t)$ increases and moves to the right, towards $x=0$.\n\n*   **Interval 2: $0 < x < 1$**\n    Let's pick a test value, e.g., $x = 0.5$.\n    $f(0.5) = -(0.5)(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.5(0.25) = -0.125$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t) < 0$, which means the solution $x(t)$ decreases and moves to the left, towards $x=0$.\n\n*   **Interval 3: $x > 1$**\n    Let's pick a test value, e.g., $x = 2$.\n    $f(2) = -(2)(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t) < 0$, which means the solution $x(t)$ decreases and moves to the left, towards $x=1$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the stability and find m.**\nLet's summarize the behavior of the solutions from the analysis above:\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x=0$:**\n    To the left of 0, solutions move right ($\\rightarrow$). To the right of 0, solutions move left ($\\leftarrow$). The flow on both sides is towards $x=0$.\n    ($\\rightarrow 0 \\leftarrow$)\n    This indicates that $x=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium point.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x=1$:**\n    To the left of 1, solutions move left ($\\leftarrow$). To the right of 1, solutions also move left ($\\leftarrow$).\n    ($\\leftarrow 1 \\leftarrow$)\n    Solutions starting slightly greater than 1 will move towards 1. However, solutions starting slightly less than 1 will move *away* from 1 (towards 0).\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Definition of Stability.** For an equilibrium point to be stable, solutions starting sufficiently close to it must remain close for all future time. Since solutions starting just to the left of $x=1$ move away, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium, which is a type of unstable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point: $x=0$.\nThe number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThe final answer is the numerical value of this expression.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
