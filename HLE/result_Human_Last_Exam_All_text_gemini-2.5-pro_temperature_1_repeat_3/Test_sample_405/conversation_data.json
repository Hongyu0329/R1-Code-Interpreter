    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The question asks for the total number of distinct colors that are exhibited by the various *pure allotropes* of phosphorus that have been *observed*.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Allotrope:** Different structural forms of the same element in the same physical state. For phosphorus, this includes white, red, violet, black, and blue phosphorus.\n    *   **Pure:** The color must be characteristic of the allotrope itself, not due to impurities or partial conversion to another allotrope.\n    *   **Observed:** The allotrope must have been successfully synthesized and its color visually confirmed, not just predicted by theory.\n\n3.  **List and Analyze Each Allotrope's Color:**\n\n    *   **White Phosphorus (P₄):**\n        *   **Structure:** A molecular solid made of tetrahedral P₄ molecules.\n        *   **Color:** When pure, it is a colorless or white, waxy solid.\n        *   **Careful Point:** It is commonly called \"yellow phosphorus\" because it rapidly turns yellow upon exposure to light. This yellowing is due to the formation of trace amounts of red phosphorus, making it an impure sample. Therefore, for the *pure* allotrope, the color is **White**.\n\n    *   **Red Phosphorus (Pₙ):**\n        *   **Structure:** An amorphous polymeric network.\n        *   **Color:** As its name suggests, its color is **Red**. The shade can range from orange-red to deep red depending on preparation and particle size.\n        *   **Careful Point:** \"Scarlet phosphorus\" is sometimes mentioned, but it is considered a finely divided, more reactive form of red phosphorus, not a distinct allotrope. Its color is a shade of red.\n\n    *   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus):**\n        *   **Structure:** A crystalline, polymeric allotrope with a complex monoclinic structure.\n        *   **Color:** This allotrope consists of well-formed crystals that are distinctly **Violet** or purple.\n\n    *   **Black Phosphorus:**\n        *   **Structure:** The most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus. It has a layered, puckered orthorhombic structure similar to graphite.\n        *   **Color:** It appears as flaky crystals with a metallic luster and is **Black** in color.\n\n    *   **Blue Phosphorus:**\n        *   **Structure:** A two-dimensional (2D) allotrope, also known as phosphorene, which consists of a single layer of phosphorus atoms.\n        *   **Color:** This modern allotrope was first synthesized on a gold substrate in 2016. As its name implies, it has been observed to be **Blue**.\n\n4.  **Consolidate and Count the Colors:**\n    Based on the analysis of pure, observed allotropes, we have identified the following distinct colors:\n    1.  White (from White Phosphorus)\n    2.  Red (from Red Phosphorus)\n    3.  Violet (from Violet Phosphorus)\n    4.  Black (from Black Phosphorus)\n    5.  Blue (from Blue Phosphorus)\n\n5.  **Final Answer Derivation:**\n    Summing up the distinct colors from the well-characterized and observed pure allotropes gives a total of 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
