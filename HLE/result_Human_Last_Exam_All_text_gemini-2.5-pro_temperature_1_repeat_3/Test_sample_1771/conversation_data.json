    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the etymological development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂g-ie/o-ti`.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** `*seh₂g-ie/o-ti`\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-` meaning 'to track, seek out'. The cognates Latin `sāgīre` ('to perceive keenly') and Hittite `sākizzi` ('gives a sign, an omen') confirm this root.\n*   **Laryngeal `h₂`:** The presence of the `h₂` laryngeal is confirmed by the `ā` vowel in Latin and Hittite. In PIE, `*e` next to `*h₂` is \"colored\" to `*a`.\n*   **Suffix:** `*-ie/o-` is a present tense suffix.\n*   **Ending:** `*-ti` is the 3rd person singular present indicative ending.\n\nA crucial point for the development in Germanic is the vowel grade. The forms found in Germanic (Gothic `sōkjan`, etc.) point to a long `*ō` in Proto-Germanic. This is best explained by starting not from the e-grade `*seh₂g-` but from the o-grade causative/iterative form `*soh₂g-éye-ti`. The o-grade is common for this type of verb.\n\n1.  **Reconstructed PIE Form:** `*soh₂g-éye-ti` (causative/iterative)\n2.  **Vowel Change:** The `o` vowel combines with the following `h₂`, which then disappears, resulting in a long `ō`.\n    *   `*soh₂g-` -> `*sōg-`\n\n### **Step 2: From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\nWe trace the development of the stem `*sōg-` and the causative suffix `*-eye-`.\n\n1.  **Grimm's Law (First Germanic Sound Shift):** This law affects the consonants.\n    *   PIE `*s` remains `*s` in PGmc.\n    *   PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes the voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   Therefore, the root `*sōg-` becomes `*sōk-`.\n2.  **Verner's Law:** This law voices voiceless fricatives under certain accentual conditions. It does not apply here because the consonant in question, `*k`, is a stop, not a fricative that resulted from Grimm's Law.\n3.  **Suffix Development:** The PIE causative suffix `*-eye-` becomes the suffix for Class I weak verbs in Proto-Germanic: `*-ja-`.\n4.  **Infinitive Form:** Combining the root `*sōk-`, the suffix `*-ja-`, and the infinitive ending `*-naną`, we get the Proto-Germanic infinitive.\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** **`*sōkijaną`**\n\n### **Step 3: From Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages**\n\nFrom the PGmc form `*sōkijaną`, we can derive the forms in Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German. The `*-j-` in the suffix is a key element, as it triggers sound changes in the preceding root vowel and/or consonant.\n\n#### **A. Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The `*j` in the suffix causes the back vowel `*ō` in the root to be fronted.\n    *   `*ō` + `j` -> `œ` (later written `æ` or, more commonly, unrounded to `ø`). The vowel remains long.\n2.  **Suffix and Ending:** The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-a` in Old Norse. The `*j` is retained.\n3.  **Result:** `*sōkjaną` -> `sœkja`\n\n*   **Old Norse Result:** **`søkja`** (common spelling for `sœkja`)\n\n#### **B. Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The `*j` in the suffix fronts the root vowel `*ō`.\n    *   `*ō` + `j` -> `ē` (a long front vowel).\n2.  **Palatalization:** The velar consonant `*k` is followed by the new front vowel `ē` and the `j`. This environment causes `*k` to become the palato-alveolar affricate `[tʃ]`, which is written as `ċ`.\n3.  **Suffix and Ending:** The `*j` is absorbed after causing umlaut and palatalization. The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an`.\n4.  **Result:** `*sōkjaną` -> `*sēkjan` -> `sēċan`\n\n*   **Old English Result:** **`sēċan`**\n\n#### **C. Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **OHG Vowel Shift:** The PGmc long vowel `*ō` diphthongizes to `uo`.\n    *   `*sōk-` -> `suoh-`\n2.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** The PGmc voiceless stop `*k` is affected. When followed by `*j` (as in Class I weak verbs), it becomes the long voiceless fricative `[xx]`, written as `hh`.\n    *   `*-kjan-` -> `-hhen-`\n3.  **I-Umlaut:** In OHG, i-umlaut affects the `uo` diphthong in some verb forms (e.g., 2nd/3rd person singular `suochist`), turning it into `üe`. However, it is not consistently applied to the infinitive form, which typically retains the un-umlauted `uo`.\n4.  **Suffix and Ending:** The `*j` is lost after causing the consonant shift. The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an` (often written `-en`).\n5.  **Result:** `*sōkjaną` -> `suohhen`\n\n*   **Old High German Result:** **`suohhen`**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `søkja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēċan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: søkja; Old English: sēċan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
