    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the equations**\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are a system of partial differential equations for the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and the pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$, where $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. The equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. We are looking for the dimension of the Lie group of point transformations of the variables $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p)$ that leave the set of solutions to these equations invariant. The dimension of the Lie group is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra, which is the number of linearly independent infinitesimal generators of the symmetry transformations.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the \"obvious\" physical symmetries (The Galilean Group)**\n\nThese symmetries are expected from the physical principles underlying fluid dynamics.\n\n*   **Time Translation:** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on $t$).\n    *   Transformation: $t' = t + s$\n    *   This is a 1-parameter group.\n    *   Dimension: 1\n\n*   **Spatial Translations:** The equations are homogeneous in space.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$ for a constant vector $\\mathbf{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    *   This is a 3-parameter group.\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n*   **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are isotropic (invariant under rotations).\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = R\\mathbf{u}$ for a rotation matrix $R \\in SO(3)$.\n    *   The rotation group $SO(3)$ is a 3-parameter group.\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\n*   **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$ for a constant velocity vector $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. The pressure $p$ remains unchanged.\n    *   This is a 3-parameter group.\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\nThese symmetries together form the 10-dimensional extended Galilean group.\n\n**Step 3: Look for Scaling Symmetries (Dilations)**\n\nLet's test for invariance under a scaling transformation of the form:\n$t' = \\lambda^\\alpha t$, $\\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda^\\beta \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^\\gamma \\mathbf{u}$, $p' = \\lambda^\\delta p$.\n\nSubstituting these into the Navier-Stokes equations and requiring the transformed equation to be a multiple of the original equation for any $\\lambda > 0$ yields a set of linear equations for the exponents. The presence of the viscous term $\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$ fixes the relationship between the time and space scaling. The solution to these equations is:\n$\\alpha = 2$, $\\beta = 1$, $\\gamma = -1$, $\\delta = -2$.\n\n*   **Scaling Transformation:** $t' = \\lambda^2 t, \\quad \\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$.\n*   This is a 1-parameter group.\n*   Dimension: 1\n\nAdding this to the Galilean symmetries gives a total of $10 + 1 = 11$ dimensions so far.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Symmetries Related to the Pressure Term**\n\nA crucial feature of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is that the pressure $p$ appears only through its gradient, $\\nabla p$.\n\n*   **Constant Pressure Shift:** Consider the transformation $p' = p + c$, where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.\n    *   The term $\\nabla p$ becomes $\\nabla (p+c) = \\nabla p$.\n    *   The rest of the equations do not involve $p$.\n    *   Therefore, the system of equations is invariant under a constant shift in pressure.\n*   This is a 1-parameter group of transformations.\n*   The infinitesimal generator for this symmetry is $\\partial_p$.\n*   This generator is linearly independent of the 11 generators found in the previous steps.\n*   Dimension: 1\n\n**Step 5: Check for other possible finite-dimensional symmetries**\n\nA full analysis using the algorithmic methods of Lie theory confirms that there are no other finite-dimensional point symmetries. For instance, the non-linear term $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}$ breaks some symmetries that are present in the linear Stokes or heat equations, such as the special conformal transformation.\n\n**Step 6: Total the dimensions**\n\nSumming the dimensions of all the independent finite-dimensional point symmetries found:\n*   Time Translation: 1\n*   Space Translations: 3\n*   Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean Boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n*   Pressure Shift: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Finite vs. Infinite Dimension:** The equations are also symmetric under the transformation $p \\to p + f(t)$, where $f(t)$ is an arbitrary function of time. This corresponds to an infinite-dimensional symmetry group. The question \"dimension of the Lie group\" is conventionally understood to refer to the maximal *finite-dimensional* Lie point symmetry group.\n2.  **Inclusion of Pressure Shift:** Some sources quote the dimension as 11. This is typically because they either work in a formulation where the pressure is eliminated (e.g., the vorticity formulation), or they consider the constant pressure shift as a \"trivial\" symmetry and quotient it out. However, from a strict mathematical analysis of the PDE system for $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$, the generator $\\partial_p$ is a valid, independent generator and should be included in the count. The Lie algebra of the 11 other symmetries forms a semi-direct product with the algebra generated by $\\partial_p$, meaning it's an integral part of the structure.\n3.  **Domain:** The analysis holds for the equations posed on the whole space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Specific boundary conditions for a particular problem can break some or all of these symmetries for a given solution, but the symmetries of the equations themselves remain.\n\nBased on a complete analysis, the dimension of the Lie group of point symmetries is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
