    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n**1. Understand the Properties of the Group G**\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n*   **Topological group:** The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-countable:** Every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods. By homogeneity of a topological group, this is equivalent to the identity element $e$ having a countable local base. The minimal size of a local base at $e$ is the character of the group, denoted $\\chi(G)$. So, we have $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n*   **Not necessarily Hausdorff:** The space is not assumed to be $T_2$. As we will see, it *cannot* be Hausdorff.\n\nWe need to find the largest possible value for the **weight** of $G$, denoted $w(G)$. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n**2. Initial Analysis and Why G Cannot Be Hausdorff**\n\nIf $G$ were a Hausdorff group, a known theorem for compact Hausdorff groups states that $w(G) = \\chi(G)$.\nSince $G$ is first-countable, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\nSo, if $G$ were Hausdorff, its weight would be $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\nHowever, for any Hausdorff space $X$, there is a cardinal inequality $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$.\nThis would imply $|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\nBut we are given $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is strictly greater than $\\frak c$.\nThis contradiction shows that $G$ cannot be a Hausdorff group. The non-Hausdorff property is essential.\n\n**3. Cardinal Invariant Inequalities for Topological Groups**\n\nTo determine the weight, we use established inequalities relating cardinal invariants of topological groups.\n\n*   **Relationship between weight, density, and character:** For any topological group $G$, a base for its topology can be constructed from a dense subset and a local base at the identity. This leads to the inequality:\n    $w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$\n    Here, $d(G)$ is the density of $G$ (the minimum cardinality of a dense subset). Since we know $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$, we have:\n    $w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\aleph_0$.\n\n*   **Relationship between density and weight:** For any topological space $X$, the density is less than or equal to the weight:\n    $d(X) \\le w(X)$.\n    So, $d(G) \\le w(G)$.\n\n*   **Smirnov's Theorem:** A key result for topological groups (which does not require the Hausdorff property) is Smirnov's inequality:\n    $|G| \\le d(G)^{\\chi(G)}$.\n\n**4. Deriving the Density of G**\n\nLet's use Smirnov's theorem to find the density $d(G)$.\nWe substitute the known values for $G$:\n$|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ and $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\nThe inequality becomes:\n$2^{2^\\frak c} \\le d(G)^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nLet $\\kappa = d(G)$. We have $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le \\kappa^{\\aleph_0}$.\nTo satisfy this inequality, the cardinal $\\kappa$ must be large enough.\nIf $\\kappa$ were, for example, $2^\\frak c$, we would have $(2^\\frak c)^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{2^{\\aleph_0}})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{2^{\\aleph_0} \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{2^{\\aleph_0}} = 2^\\frak c$.\nThe inequality would become $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le 2^\\frak c$, which is false.\nFor the inequality $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le \\kappa^{\\aleph_0}$ to hold, we must have $\\kappa \\ge 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\nSo, we have a lower bound for the density:\n$d(G) \\ge 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nOn the other hand, the density of any space cannot exceed its cardinality.\n$d(G) \\le |G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds for $d(G)$, we conclude that the density must be exactly:\n$d(G) = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n**5. Deriving the Weight of G**\n\nNow we use the density to find the weight $w(G)$.\nFrom step 3, we have the inequalities:\n1.  $d(G) \\le w(G)$\n2.  $w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n1.  $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le w(G)$\n2.  $w(G) \\le (2^{2^\\frak c}) \\cdot \\aleph_0$\n\nFor any infinite cardinal $\\kappa$ with uncountable cofinality, $\\kappa \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\kappa$. The cardinal $2^{2^\\frak c}$ has cofinality $2^\\frak c$, which is uncountable. Therefore, $(2^{2^\\frak c}) \\cdot \\aleph_0 = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nSo the second inequality becomes:\n$w(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nCombining the two inequalities for the weight:\n$2^{2^\\frak c} \\le w(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nThis forces the weight to be exactly:\n$w(G) = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that for any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions, its weight must be $2^{2^\\frak c}$. The question asks for the largest possible weight. Since the weight is uniquely determined by the given properties, the largest possible value is this unique value. The existence of such a group is assumed by the phrasing of the question.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   The group $G$ cannot be Hausdorff, as $|G| > 2^{\\chi(G)}$.\n*   Using Smirnov's theorem for topological groups, $|G| \\le d(G)^{\\chi(G)}$, we deduce $d(G) = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   Using the inequality $d(G) \\le w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$, we deduce $w(G) = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nThe largest possible weight of the group is $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n<<<2^(2^c)>>>"
