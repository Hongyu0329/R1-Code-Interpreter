    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality and find the new matrix C.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and the Problem\nWe are given a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0],\n     [2, 1, 1],\n     [0, 2, 0]]\n\nC = [[0, 1, 0],\n     [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe goal is to find the output matrix, let's call it C_o, of the system when it is transformed into **observer canonical form**. The problem specifies using the principle of **duality**.\n\n### Step 2: The Duality Principle\nThe duality principle states that the problem of designing an observer for a system (A, C) is dual to the problem of designing a state-feedback controller for the system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ).\n\nThis means if we transform the dual system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ) into **controller canonical form**, say (A_c, B_c), then the observer canonical form for the original system (A, C) will be (A_o, C_o) where:\n*   A_o = A_cᵀ\n*   C_o = B_cᵀ\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the input matrix B_c for the controller canonical form of the dual system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ). The structure of this canonical form is determined by the system's controllability indices.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Controllability Indices of the Dual System\nThe controllability indices of the dual system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ) are identical to the observability indices of the original system (A, C). Let's find these indices.\n\nThe observability matrix of the original system is given by:\nW_o = [C; CA; CA²]\n\nThe rows of C are:\nc₁ᵀ = [0, 1, 0]  (from the first output y₁)\nc₂ᵀ = [1, 1, 0]  (from the second output y₂)\n\nWe build a basis for the state space by selecting linearly independent rows from W_o, taking them in the following order: c₁ᵀ, c₂ᵀ, c₁ᵀA, c₂ᵀA, ...\n\n1.  **Select c₁ᵀ = [0, 1, 0]**. It's a non-zero vector.\n2.  **Select c₂ᵀ = [1, 1, 0]**. This is linearly independent of c₁ᵀ.\n3.  Calculate c₁ᵀA:\n    c₁ᵀA = [0, 1, 0] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [2, 1, 1]\n    This vector is linearly independent of {c₁ᵀ, c₂ᵀ} because its third component is non-zero, while the first two vectors have a zero in the third component.\n4.  We have now found three linearly independent vectors: {c₁ᵀ, c₂ᵀ, c₁ᵀA}. Since the state space is 3-dimensional (n=3), this set forms a basis. We can stop here.\n\nNow, we determine the observability indices (ν₁, ν₂) by looking at how many vectors were selected for each output's chain:\n*   For the first output (y₁), we selected c₁ᵀ and c₁ᵀA. This is a chain of length 2. So, **ν₁ = 2**.\n*   For the second output (y₂), we only selected c₂ᵀ. This is a chain of length 1. So, **ν₂ = 1**.\n\nThe observability indices for (A, C) are (2, 1). By duality, the controllability indices for (Aᵀ, Cᵀ) are (μ₁, μ₂) = (2, 1).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Structure of the Canonical Matrix B_c\nThe structure of the input matrix B_c in the Luenberger controller canonical form is uniquely determined by the controllability indices (μ₁, μ₂) = (2, 1).\n\nThe canonical form of B_c corresponding to the dual of the Luenberger *observer* canonical form is a matrix with columns b_ci that are all zero except for a '1' at a specific row. For controllability indices (μ₁, μ₂, ..., μₘ), the '1' in the j-th column appears at row `μ₁ + μ₂ + ... + μ_j`.\n\nFor our indices (μ₁, μ₂) = (2, 1):\n*   For the first input (j=1), the '1' is at row μ₁ = 2.\n*   For the second input (j=2), the '1' is at row μ₁ + μ₂ = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThis gives the matrix B_c:\nB_c = [[0, 0],\n       [1, 0],\n       [0, 1]]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the New Output Matrix C_o\nUsing the duality principle, the new output matrix C_o for the observer canonical form is the transpose of B_c.\n\nC_o = B_cᵀ = [[0, 1, 0],\n              [0, 0, 1]]\n\n*Self-Correction/Alternative View*: An equally common (and perhaps more standard) definition for the observer canonical form C_o states that the i-th row is zero except for a '1' at column `1 + ν₁ + ... + ν_{i-1}`. For our indices (ν₁, ν₂) = (2, 1):\n*   For the first row (i=1), the '1' is at column 1.\n*   For the second row (i=2), the '1' is at column 1 + ν₁ = 1 + 2 = 3.\nThis would give C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]].\nThe corresponding B_c would be B_c = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]. This form is also a valid canonical representation. However, the form derived in Step 4 is directly associated with the standard controllable companion form structure for A_c. Both answers represent a valid observer canonical form. In the context of textbook problems, the form C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]] is very common. Let's provide this as the answer, as it is arguably the most \"canonical\" representation of the outputs.\n\n### Final Calculation based on the standard Observer Canonical Form structure\n1.  **Observability Indices**: (ν₁, ν₂) = (2, 1).\n2.  **Structure of C_o**: The i-th row has a 1 at column `1 + sum of preceding indices`.\n    *   Row 1: 1 at column 1.\n    *   Row 2: 1 at column 1 + ν₁ = 3.\n3.  **Final Matrix C_o**:\n    C_o = [[1, 0, 0],\n           [0, 0, 1]]\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
