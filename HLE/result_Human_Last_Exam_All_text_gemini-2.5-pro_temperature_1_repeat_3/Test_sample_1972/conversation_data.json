    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe question asks for the title of a novel based on two key pieces of information provided by the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  A specific quote describing the novel: \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  A description of the novel's author: a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Clue - The Quote**\n*   **\"the intensity of a tiger\"**: This metaphor suggests the novel is powerful, fierce, visceral, and perhaps primal or savage in its themes and emotional impact. It implies a story that is not gentle but rather grabs the reader with force.\n*   **\"the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"**: This metaphor points to a work of great structural complexity and intellectual depth. A chess game is about strategy, precision, and a series of calculated moves where every piece and position matters. This suggests the novel has a meticulously crafted plot, a complex structure, and a narrative where every detail is significant.\n*   **Careful Point**: The combination of these two metaphors is the most important part. Borges is highlighting a rare achievement: a book that is both intellectually rigorous and passionately intense.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Clue - The Author's Description**\n*   **\"a continuator... of Faulkner\"**: This means the author works in the literary tradition of William Faulkner. Key characteristics of Faulkner's style include non-linear narratives, multiple perspectives and narrators (some unreliable), a strong sense of a mythical place (like his Yoknapatawpha County), and complex, long sentences. The author in question likely uses some of these modernist techniques.\n*   **\"(and simplifier) of Faulkner\"**: This is a crucial distinction. It means that while the author uses Faulknerian techniques, they do so in a more condensed, direct, or accessible way. The style is likely not as dense or convoluted as Faulkner's. The prose would be more stark, laconic, or minimalist.\n*   **Careful Point**: This points us toward a Latin American author from the mid-20th century, as Faulkner was a major influence on the writers of the \"Boom\" generation. We are looking for one who is known for a spare, precise writing style.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Novel**\n*   The author who perfectly fits the description of a \"continuator and simplifier of Faulkner\" is the Mexican writer **Juan Rulfo**. Rulfo's work, particularly his masterpiece novel, is set in the mythical, desolate town of Comala. It uses a fragmented narrative, a chorus of voices (many of them dead), and a jumbled timeline, all of which are Faulknerian techniques. However, Rulfo's prose is famously minimalist and stark, the complete opposite of Faulkner's dense style. This makes him a perfect \"simplifier.\"\n*   The novel in question is **Pedro Páramo** (1955). This short novel is renowned for its haunting, ghost-like atmosphere (the \"intensity of a tiger\") and its brilliant, puzzle-box structure where the reader must piece together the story from fragmented dialogues and memories (the \"variety that a chess duel can achieve\").\n*   Jorge Luis Borges was a great admirer of this novel. He famously wrote a very short review praising it as one of the greatest novels in Hispanic literature, and the descriptions in the question are directly linked to his and other critics' analyses of the book.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe two clues provided by Borges point unequivocally to a single work. The description of the author as a \"simplifier of Faulkner\" identifies Juan Rulfo, and the description of the novel as having the intensity of a tiger and the complexity of a chess match perfectly characterizes his novel, *Pedro Páramo*.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
