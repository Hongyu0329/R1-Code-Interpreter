    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory used by its variables.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe problem asks us to reorder the numbers in a given sum so that they appear in non-decreasing order. The input is a string representing the sum, containing only the digits '1', '2', '3', '4', and the '+' character. The output should be the rearranged sum, also as a string. The main challenge is to write a C program that achieves this using the minimum possible amount of memory for its variables.\n\n**Example:**\n*   Input: `3+2+1+4+1`\n*   Numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4\n*   Output: `1+1+2+3+4`\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\n1.  **Memory is Key**: The primary constraint is memory efficiency. A naive approach of storing all numbers in an integer array would use significant memory. For a 1000-character string, we could have up to 501 numbers, requiring an array of `501 * sizeof(int)`, which is over 2000 bytes. This should be avoided.\n2.  **Limited Number Set**: The numbers are only 1, 2, 3, and 4. This is a crucial piece of information. It suggests that we don't need a general-purpose sorting algorithm. **Counting Sort** is the perfect fit. We can simply count the occurrences of each number.\n3.  **Input Processing**: To save memory, we should avoid reading the entire input string into a buffer (which would require up to 1001 bytes). Instead, we can process the input one character at a time using a function like `getchar()`.\n4.  **Output Formatting**: The output requires '+' symbols between the numbers but not at the end. This can be handled with a simple flag variable to track whether the term being printed is the first one.\n5.  **Data Type Selection**: To minimize memory, we must use the smallest standard data type that can safely hold the required range of values for each variable.\n6.  **Assumptions**: We will assume standard data type sizes on typical competitive programming platforms: `sizeof(char) = 1` byte, `sizeof(short) = 2` bytes, and `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will design a C program based on the Counting Sort algorithm and character-by-character input processing. Then, we will calculate the memory used by its variables.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Declare four counters, one for each number (1, 2, 3, 4).\n2.  Read the input one character at a time in a loop until the end of the line.\n3.  If the character is a digit ('1', '2', '3', or '4'), increment the corresponding counter. Ignore '+' characters.\n4.  After counting is complete, generate the output.\n5.  Use a flag to know when to print a '+'.\n6.  Loop from 1 to 4. For each number, print it as many times as its counter indicates. Print a '+' before each number except the very first one.\n\n**Variable Memory Calculation:**\nNow, let's determine the variables needed and select the most memory-efficient data types for them.\n\n1.  **Input Character Variable**: We need a variable to store the character returned by `getchar()`. The `getchar()` function returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` (End Of File) value. Therefore, this variable must be of type `int`.\n    *   `int c;` -> `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n\n2.  **Counters Variable**: We need four counters. The maximum length of the input string is 1000. The maximum number of terms is for a string like \"1+1+...+1\", which gives (1000+1)/2 ≈ 500 terms. So, each counter must be able to hold a value up to 501. A `short int` (which can typically hold values up to 32,767) is sufficient. We can use an array of four `short` integers.\n    *   `short counts[4];` -> `4 * sizeof(short)` = 4 * 2 = 8 bytes.\n\n3.  **Loop Counter Variable**: For the output phase, we need a loop that iterates four times (for numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4). A `char` is sufficient to store a loop index from 0 to 3.\n    *   `char i;` -> `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n\n4.  **Flag Variable**: To handle the printing of the '+' separator correctly, we need a simple boolean flag (e.g., 1 for the first term, 0 otherwise). The smallest data type for this is `char`.\n    *   `char is_first;` -> `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation (m):**\nSumming the memory usage of all variables:\n`m` = (memory for input char) + (memory for counters) + (memory for loop counter) + (memory for flag)\n`m` = 4 bytes + 8 bytes + 1 byte + 1 byte\n`m` = 14 bytes\n\nThis represents the total memory allocated for the variables in the most memory-efficient C program for this problem.\n\n<<<14>>>"
