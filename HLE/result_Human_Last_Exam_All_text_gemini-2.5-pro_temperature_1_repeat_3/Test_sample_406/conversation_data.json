    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a concept in mathematics, specifically in fixed-point theory, that generalizes the idea of a standard fixed point. The conditions for its existence are typically established by a theorem analogous to the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, applied to a product space.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine these conditions.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nFirst, we must formally define the objects involved.\n\n1.  **Spaces**: Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be three metric spaces.\n2.  **Functions**: There are three functions, F, G, and H. Based on the question's format, we assume a typo and define the functions as:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n3.  **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**: An \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" is a triplet `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    *   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n### Step 2: Framing the Problem for a Fixed-Point Theorem\n\nThe existence of such a point can be proven by defining a single operator on the product space `W = X × Y × Z` and showing it has a fixed point.\n\n1.  **Product Space**: The space `W = X × Y × Z` can be equipped with a metric. A common choice is the sum metric:\n    `d((x₁,y₁,z₁), (x₂,y₂,z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n2.  **Operator Definition**: Define an operator `T: W → W` as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n3.  **Equivalence**: A point `(x, y, z)` is an FGH-tripled fixed point if and only if it is a fixed point of the operator `T`, i.e., `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that a contraction mapping on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point. We apply this to the operator `T` on the space `W`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Completeness**: For the theorem to apply, the space `W` must be complete. The product space `(W, d)` is complete if and only if each of the component spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` is complete. This gives us our first major condition.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Contraction Mapping**: The operator `T` must be a contraction. This means there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w₁ = (x₁,y₁,z₁)` and `w₂ = (x₂,y₂,z₂)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n    `d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d(w₁, w₂)`\n\n### Step 4: Deriving the Specific Conditions\n\nWe now expand the contraction inequality to find the specific conditions on F, G, and H.\n\n1.  **LHS of the inequality**:\n    `d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) = d( (F(x₁,y₁,z₁), G(y₁,x₁,y₁), H(z₁,y₁,x₁)), (F(x₂,y₂,z₂), G(y₂,x₂,y₂), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) )`\n    `= d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n\n2.  **Imposing Contractive Bounds**: We assume that the functions F, G, and H satisfy a Lipschitz-type condition with respect to their arguments. That is, there exist non-negative constants such that for all `x₁,x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁,y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁,z₂ ∈ Z`:\n    a) `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ α₁d_X(x₁,x₂) + α₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + α₃d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n    b) `d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ β₁d_Y(y₁,y₂) + β₂d_X(x₁,x₂)`\n    c) `d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ γ₁d_Z(z₁,z₂) + γ₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + γ₃d_X(x₁,x₂)`\n\n3.  **Combining the inequalities**: Summing these three inequalities gives an upper bound for `d(T(w₁), T(w₂))`:\n    `d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ (α₁+β₂+γ₃)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (α₂+β₁+γ₂)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (α₃+γ₁)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\n4.  **Finalizing the Contraction**: To satisfy `d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d(w₁, w₂)` where `d(w₁, w₂) = d_X + d_Y + d_Z`, we can set `k` to be the maximum of the coefficient groups:\n    `k = max( (α₁+β₂+γ₃), (α₂+β₁+γ₂), (α₃+γ₁) )`\n    For `T` to be a contraction, we must have `k < 1`.\n\n### Final Answer: Summary of Conditions\n\nBased on the analysis, the conditions for the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` are derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied to an operator on the product space `X×Y×Z`. The conditions are:\n\n**1. Space Condition:**\nThe metric spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **complete**.\n\n**2. Contractive Conditions on the Functions:**\nThere must exist non-negative constants `α₁, α₂, α₃`, `β₁, β₂`, and `γ₁, γ₂, γ₃` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following inequalities hold:\n*   `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ α₁d_X(x₁,x₂) + α₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + α₃d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n*   `d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ β₁d_Y(y₁,y₂) + β₂d_X(x₁,x₂)`\n*   `d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ γ₁d_Z(z₁,z₂) + γ₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + γ₃d_X(x₁,x₂)`\n\n**3. Global Contraction Condition:**\nThe sum of the constants corresponding to each component distance must be less than 1. Specifically, the maximum of these sums must be less than 1:\n`max( (α₁ + β₂ + γ₃), (α₂ + β₁ + γ₂), (α₃ + γ₁) ) < 1`\n\nIf these three sets of conditions are met, then there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z`.>>>"
