The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` are derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied to an operator on the product space `X×Y×Z`. The conditions are:

**1. Space Condition:**
The metric spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **complete**.

**2. Contractive Conditions on the Functions:**
There must exist non-negative constants `α₁, α₂, α₃`, `β₁, β₂`, and `γ₁, γ₂, γ₃` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following inequalities hold:
*   `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ α₁d_X(x₁,x₂) + α₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + α₃d_Z(z₁,z₂)`
*   `d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ β₁d_Y(y₁,y₂) + β₂d_X(x₁,x₂)`
*   `d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ γ₁d_Z(z₁,z₂) + γ₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + γ₃d_X(x₁,x₂)`

**3. Global Contraction Condition:**
The sum of the constants corresponding to each component distance must be less than 1. Specifically, the maximum of these sums must be less than 1:
`max( (α₁ + β₂ + γ₃), (α₂ + β₁ + γ₂), (α₃ + γ₁) ) < 1`

If these three sets of conditions are met, then there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z`.
