    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Definitions**\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `a, b \\in S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `ab` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S^2 \\cap S = \\emptyset`, where `S^2 = \\{ab | a, b \\in S\\}`. A consequence is that the identity element `1` can never be in a non-empty product-free set, as `1 \\cdot 1 = 1`.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion (or just maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means that for any element `g \\in G \\setminus S`, the set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is *not* product-free.\n*   **Fills:** A subset `S` of `G` fills `G` if `G = S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{1\\}$, where `S^{-1} = \\{s^{-1} | s \\in S\\}`. This implies that every non-identity element `g` of `G` satisfies `g \\in S` or `g^{-1} \\in S` (or both).\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is filled if *every* maximal product-free set in `G` also fills `G`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Structure of Groups of Order `2q^m`**\n\nLet `G` be a nonabelian group of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number (`m \\ge 1`).\n\n*   By the Sylow Theorems, let `n_q` be the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups. We know `n_q` must divide `2` and `n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q`. Since `q` is an odd prime (`q \\ge 3`), `n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q` cannot be satisfied by `n_q=2`. Therefore, `n_q` must be `1`.\n*   This means the Sylow `q`-subgroup, let's call it `Q`, is unique and hence normal in `G`. We have `|Q| = q^m`.\n*   Let `P` be a Sylow 2-subgroup. `|P| = 2`. `P` is isomorphic to `Z_2`. Let `P = <x>` where `x^2 = 1`.\n*   Since `Q` is a normal subgroup, `G` is a semidirect product of `Q` and `P`. So, `G \\cong Q \\rtimes P \\cong Q \\rtimes Z_2`.\n*   The elements of `G` can be partitioned into two disjoint sets: the subgroup `Q` itself, and the coset `Qx = \\{qx | q \\in Q\\}`. So, `G = Q \\cup Qx`.\n*   Since `G` is nonabelian, the semidirect product must be non-trivial. This means the homomorphism `\\phi: P \\to Aut(Q)` that defines the action of `P` on `Q` is not trivial. The element `x \\in P` acts on `Q` via a non-identity automorphism `\\alpha = \\phi(x) \\in Aut(Q)`, where `\\alpha^2` is the identity automorphism. The multiplication rule involving `x` is `xqx^{-1} = \\alpha(q)` for `q \\in Q`. Since `x=x^{-1}`, this is `xqx = \\alpha(q)`.\n\n**3. Construct a Candidate Maximal Product-Free Set**\n\nWe will now show that for any such group `G`, we can construct a maximal product-free set that does *not* fill `G`. This is sufficient to prove that `G` is not a filled group.\n\nLet's consider the set `S = Qx`, which is the set of all elements in `G` that are not in `Q`.\n\n*   **`S` is product-free:**\n    Let `s_1, s_2 \\in S`. Then `s_1 = q_1 x` and `s_2 = q_2 x` for some `q_1, q_2 \\in Q`.\n    Their product is `s_1 s_2 = (q_1 x)(q_2 x) = q_1 (x q_2 x^{-1}) x^2 = q_1 \\alpha(q_2)`.\n    Since `q_1 \\in Q` and `\\alpha(q_2) \\in Q`, their product `q_1 \\alpha(q_2)` is also in `Q`.\n    So, the product of any two elements of `S` lies in `Q`.\n    This means `S^2 \\subseteq Q`.\n    Since `S = Qx` and `Q` are disjoint, `S^2 \\cap S = \\emptyset`.\n    Therefore, `S = Qx` is a product-free set.\n\n*   **`S` is maximal product-free:**\n    To show `S` is maximal, we must show that for any `g \\in G \\setminus S`, the set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is not product-free.\n    An element `g \\in G \\setminus S` must be in `Q`. Let `g \\in Q`.\n    Consider the product of `g \\in S \\cup \\{g\\}` and an element `s = qx \\in S \\subset S \\cup \\{g\\}`.\n    Using the semidirect product representation, `g` is `(g, 1)` and `s` is `(q, x)`.\n    Their product is `(g, 1)(q, x) = (g \\phi(1)(q), 1x) = (gq, x)`.\n    The element `(gq, x)` corresponds to `(gq)x`, which is in `Qx = S`.\n    Since `g \\in S \\cup \\{g\\}`, `s \\in S \\cup \\{g\\}`, and their product `gs` is in `S \\subseteq S \\cup \\{g\\}`, the set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is not product-free.\n    This holds for any `g \\in Q = G \\setminus S`.\n    Therefore, `S = Qx` is a maximal product-free set.\n\n**4. Check if `S` Fills `G`**\n\nNow we check if our maximal product-free set `S=Qx` fills `G`. The condition is `G = S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{1\\}`.\n\n*   First, we determine `S^{-1}`.\n    `S^{-1} = (Qx)^{-1} = x^{-1} Q^{-1} = x Q` (since `x^{-1}=x` and `Q^{-1}=Q`).\n    An element of `xQ` is of the form `xq` for `q \\in Q`. We can write `xq = (xqx^{-1})x = \\alpha(q)x`.\n    As `q` runs through all elements of `Q`, `\\alpha(q)` also runs through all elements of `Q` because `\\alpha` is an automorphism.\n    So, `xQ = \\{\\alpha(q)x | q \\in Q\\} = Qx = S`.\n    Thus, `S^{-1} = S`.\n\n*   Now we apply the filling condition:\n    `S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{1\\} = S \\cup S \\cup \\{1\\} = S \\cup \\{1\\} = Qx \\cup \\{1\\}`.\n    For `S` to fill `G`, we would need `G = Qx \\cup \\{1\\}`.\n    But we know `G = Q \\cup Qx`.\n    So the condition becomes `Q \\cup Qx = Qx \\cup \\{1\\}`.\n    This would imply `Q = \\{1\\}`, which means `q^m = 1`. This is impossible for a prime `q` and a natural number `m \\ge 1`.\n    Therefore, the set `S = Qx` does not fill `G`.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that for any nonabelian group `G` of order `2q^m`, the set `S = Qx` (the coset of the normal Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q`) is a maximal product-free set. We have also shown that this set `S` does not fill `G`.\n\nSince `G` has at least one maximal product-free set that does not fill it, `G` cannot be a filled group by definition. This argument applies to all nonabelian groups of order `2q^m`.\n\nTherefore, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`.\n\n<<<There are no such groups.>>>"
