    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Components of the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character in William Morris's novel, *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must meet several precise criteria:\n1.  They must be a character within the novel.\n2.  They must have personally visited a Roman city.\n3.  They must describe Roman religious practices.\n4.  This description must contain a clear allusion to the myth of Romulus and Remus, which involves a she-wolf nursing two male infants.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Plot and Characters of *The House of the Wolfings***\nThe novel is about a Gothic tribe, the Wolfings, preparing to defend their homeland, the Mark, from an invading Roman army. The central conflict involves their leader, Thiodolf, and a magical hauberk that protects him but dooms his people. The book features a council scene, or \"Folk-mote,\" where the Wolfings discuss the threat. This is a likely place for a character to share knowledge about the Romans.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the Specific Scene**\nIn Chapter III, titled \"The Folk-mote of the Wolfings,\" the tribe gathers to debate how to face the Romans. Various warriors and elders speak. One character, an elder, rises to speak from personal experience, aiming to inform the others about the nature of their enemy.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Character**\nThe elder who speaks from experience of having traveled among the Romans is named **Asmund**. He is described as a \"grey-beard\" who has seen more of the world than many of his tribesmen.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Character's Speech for the Required Details**\n*   **Visited a Roman City:** Asmund explicitly states that he has traveled to a Roman settlement. He says, \"I have been in their cities, and I have seen their temples and their images...\" This confirms he meets the second criterion.\n*   **Describes Religious Practices:** He proceeds to describe the Romans' beliefs and the idols they worship, contrasting them with the Goths' own beliefs. This fulfills the third criterion.\n*   **Refers to Romulus and Remus:** The most crucial point is the specific description he gives of a Roman idol. He describes seeing an image of \"**a she-wolf giving suck to two man-children**.\" He further explains the significance of this image to the Romans, stating that they told him \"**that a wolf was their mother, and that these two were their first fathers**.\"\n\n**Step 6: Confirm the Allusion**\nThis description is a direct and unmistakable reference to the foundation myth of Rome. The she-wolf is the Lupa Capitolina, and the two \"man-children\" or \"first fathers\" are the mythical founders of the city, Romulus and Remus. The way Asmund describes it—from the perspective of an outsider encountering this strange myth—is exactly what the question asks for.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy carefully analyzing the text and characters of *The House of the Wolfings*, we can definitively identify Asmund as the character who visited a Roman city and described their worship of an image representing the Romulus and Remus myth.\n\n<<<Asmund>>>"
