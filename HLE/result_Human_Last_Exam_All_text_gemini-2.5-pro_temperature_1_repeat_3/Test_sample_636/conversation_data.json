    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Objective**: The core task is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` that places the eigenvalues (poles) of a closed-loop system at desired locations.\n2.  **System Definition**: The system is a linear time-invariant (LTI) system described by matrices `A` and `B`.\n    *   `A` is the state matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]` (2x2)\n    *   `B` is the input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]` (2x2)\n    *   The state vector `x` is 2x1, and the input vector `u` is 2x1.\n3.  **Feedback Law**: The closed-loop system matrix is given as `A_cl = A + BF`. This implies a positive feedback law `u = Fx`. We must be careful to use this exact form and not the more common `A - BK` which corresponds to negative feedback `u = -Kx`.\n4.  **Feedback Gain Matrix F**: Since `B` is 2x2 and the state `x` is 2x1, for `BFx` to be valid, `F` must have dimensions (number of inputs) x (number of states), which is 2x2. We can denote it as `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\n5.  **Desired Eigenvalues**: The target eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n6.  **Multi-Input System**: The matrix `B` has two columns, indicating a multi-input system. For controllable multi-input systems, the solution for the feedback gain matrix `F` is generally not unique. This means we have extra degrees of freedom and can simplify the problem by making valid assumptions (e.g., setting some elements of `F` to zero) to find one particular solution.\n7.  **Verification**: After finding a candidate matrix `F`, it is a good practice to plug it back into `A + BF` and calculate the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix to confirm they match the desired locations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Determine the desired characteristic polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial `p_desired(λ)` is formed from these roots:\n`p_desired(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)`\n`= (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`= ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n`= (λ + 1)² - j²`\n`= λ² + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p_desired(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the closed-loop matrix A_cl = A + BF**\n\nLet the feedback gain matrix `F` be:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n\nFirst, calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]] = [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2f3, 1 + f2 + 2f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the characteristic polynomial of A_cl**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is `λ² - trace(M)λ + det(M)`.\nFor our `A_cl`:\n`trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1`\n`det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2f4)(1 + f1)`\n`= -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n`= -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1*f2 - 2f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n`= -1 - f1 - 2f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial `p_actual(λ)` is:\n`p_actual(λ) = λ² - (f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n`p_actual(λ) = λ² + (1 - f1 - f2 - 2f3)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**Step 4: Equate coefficients and solve for F**\n\nWe match the coefficients of `p_actual(λ)` with `p_desired(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`.\n\n1.  Coefficient of `λ¹`:\n    `1 - f1 - f2 - 2f3 = 2`\n    `=> f1 + f2 + 2f3 = -1` (Equation 1)\n\n2.  Coefficient of `λ⁰` (constant term):\n    `-1 - f1 - 2f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `=> -f1 - 2f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2f4(1 + f1) = 3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns. As noted, there are infinite solutions. We can find one by setting two variables to zero. A simple choice is `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\n\nWith `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`, the equations become:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2f2 = 3`\n\nNow we solve this simpler 2x2 system. Add the two equations together:\n`(f1 - f1) + (f2 - 2f2) = -1 + 3`\n`-f2 = 2`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` into the first simplified equation:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nSo, a valid solution is `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\n\n**Step 5: Construct the final matrix F**\n\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\nLet's check our result.\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation for this `A_cl` is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ + 2]]) = λ(λ + 2) - (1)(-2) = λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThis is the desired characteristic polynomial, confirming our solution is correct.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
