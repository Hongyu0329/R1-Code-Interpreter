    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Objects**\n\n*   **C:** A compact Riemann surface (or smooth projective algebraic curve over **C**) of genus `g = 3`.\n*   **X = S^15(C):** The 15th symmetric power of C. This is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Néron-Severi Group NS(X):** The group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. It is a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   **Rank of NS(X):** Also known as the Picard number, denoted `ρ(X)`. It is the dimension of the vector space `NS(X) ⊗_Z Q`. We need to find the minimum and maximum possible values of `ρ(X)` as C varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**2. Relate the Néron-Severi Group of X to C**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is a standard result in the theory of algebraic curves that relates the Picard group (and thus the Néron-Severi group) of a symmetric power of a curve to the Jacobian of the curve.\n\n*   Let `J(C)` be the Jacobian of `C`, which is a `g`-dimensional abelian variety. In our case, `dim(J(C)) = 3`.\n*   There is a canonical map, the Abel-Jacobi map, `a: S^n(C) -> J(C)`.\n*   A fundamental result, due to I. G. Macdonald (1962), states that the Picard group of the n-th symmetric power `S^n(C)` is isomorphic to the direct sum of the Picard group of `C` and the Picard group of the Jacobian of `C`. More precisely for the Néron-Severi groups, we have an isomorphism:\n    `NS(S^n(C)) ≅ Z ⊕ NS(J(C))`\n*   This isomorphism implies that the ranks are related by:\n    `ρ(S^n(C)) = rank(Z) + rank(NS(J(C)))`\n    `ρ(X) = ρ(S^15(C)) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. We now need to find the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**3. Determine the Range of `ρ(J(C))`**\n\n*   `J(C)` is a 3-dimensional abelian variety. For any `g`-dimensional complex abelian variety `A`, its Picard number `ρ(A)` is bounded.\n*   The second cohomology group `H^2(A, C)` has a Hodge decomposition. The space of (1,1)-classes, `H^{1,1}(A)`, has dimension `g^2`.\n*   The Néron-Severi group `NS(A)` injects into `H^2(A, Z)`, and the image consists of integral (1,1)-classes (by the Lefschetz (1,1)-theorem). Therefore, the rank `ρ(A)` is the dimension of the space of algebraic cycles in `H^2(A, Q)`, which is a subspace of the space of Hodge classes `H^{1,1}(A) ∩ H^2(A, Q)`.\n*   This gives the general bounds for a `g`-dimensional abelian variety `A`:\n    `1 <= ρ(A) <= h^{1,1}(A) = g^2`\n*   For `J(C)`, with `g=3`, we have:\n    `1 <= ρ(J(C)) <= 3^2 = 9`\n\nNow, we need to check if these bounds are sharp, i.e., whether there exist genus 3 curves `C` for which `ρ(J(C))` achieves the minimum value of 1 and the maximum value of 9.\n\n**4. The Smallest Possible Rank**\n\n*   The smallest possible rank `ρ(J(C)) = 1` occurs for a **general** or **generic** curve `C`.\n*   A generic abelian variety `A` has the minimal possible endomorphism ring, `End(A) = Z`.\n*   When `End(J(C)) = Z`, the only algebraic cycles in `H^2(J(C), Q)` are rational multiples of the canonical principal polarization (the class of the theta divisor). Thus, `NS(J(C))` is generated by this single class, and `ρ(J(C)) = 1`.\n*   The set of genus 3 curves whose Jacobians have `End(J(C)) ≠ Z` forms a proper subvariety of the moduli space of genus 3 curves. Therefore, a generic genus 3 curve has `ρ(J(C)) = 1`.\n*   For such a curve `C`, the rank of `NS(X)` is:\n    `ρ(X)_min = 1 + ρ(J(C))_min = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n**5. The Largest Possible Rank**\n\n*   The largest possible rank `ρ(J(C)) = 9` occurs for a very **special** curve `C`, one whose Jacobian has the maximal number of endomorphisms (Complex Multiplication or CM-type).\n*   The upper bound `ρ(A) = g^2` is achieved if and only if the abelian variety `A` is of CM-type and is isogenous to a product of `g` copies of a single CM elliptic curve, i.e., `A ~ E^g`.\n*   It is a known result (due to Shioda and others) that for any `g >= 1`, there exists a curve `C` of genus `g` such that its Jacobian `J(C)` is isogenous to `E^g` for some elliptic curve `E` with complex multiplication.\n*   For `g=3`, there exists a curve `C` (for example, the Fermat curve `x^4 + y^4 = 1`) whose Jacobian `J(C)` is isogenous to `E^3`, where `E` is an elliptic curve with CM by `Z[i]`.\n*   For such a Jacobian, `J(C)`, its Picard number `ρ(J(C))` reaches the theoretical maximum given by the Hodge conjecture, which is `g^2`.\n*   So, `ρ(J(C))_max = g^2 = 3^2 = 9`.\n*   For such a curve `C`, the rank of `NS(X)` is:\n    `ρ(X)_max = 1 + ρ(J(C))_max = 1 + 9 = 10`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The Formula:** The core of the solution is the formula `ρ(S^n(C)) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`. Without it, the problem is much harder. It's crucial that this formula holds for the given `n=15` and `g=3`. The formula is generally valid for `n >= 1`.\n2.  **General vs. Special Curves:** The phrase \"smallest and largest possible\" is a key indicator that the answer depends on the specific choice of the curve `C`. The rank is not constant over the moduli space of genus 3 curves. The minimum is achieved for a \"general\" curve, while the maximum is achieved for a \"special\" one.\n3.  **Achievability of Bounds:** It is not enough to know the theoretical bounds `1 <= ρ(J(C)) <= 9`. We must confirm that there exist actual genus 3 curves whose Jacobians realize these bounds. For both the minimum and maximum, such curves are known to exist.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   The rank of the Néron-Severi group of `X = S^{15}(C)` is given by `ρ(X) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`.\n*   The smallest possible rank for `ρ(J(C))` where `C` is a genus 3 curve is 1. This gives the smallest rank for `ρ(X)`.\n*   The largest possible rank for `ρ(J(C))` where `C` is a genus 3 curve is `g^2 = 9`. This gives the largest rank for `ρ(X)`.\n\nSmallest rank: `1 + 1 = 2`\nLargest rank: `1 + 9 = 10`\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
