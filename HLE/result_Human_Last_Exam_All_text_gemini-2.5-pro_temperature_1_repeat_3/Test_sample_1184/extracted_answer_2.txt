**1) Hotspots for interaction with alpha-1 subunit (Binding):**

These residues are located within the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain of the human beta-1 subunit (CACNB1) and form the hydrophobic binding pocket for the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit. Their mutation typically abolishes binding.

*   **L340 (Leucine at position 340):** Forms a key part of the hydrophobic wall of the binding pocket.
*   **V406 (Valine at position 406):** Contributes a critical hydrophobic contact point.
*   **M409 (Methionine at position 409):** Another essential hydrophobic residue within the pocket.
*   **L447 (Leucine at position 447):** Lines the opposite wall of the hydrophobic pocket.
*   **Y453 (Tyrosine at position 453):** Acts as a "lid" to stabilize the bound AID helix through critical interactions.

**2) Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (Gating Modulation):**

These residues or regions are involved in the allosteric modulation of channel function. They are often located outside the primary binding pocket and are critical for transmitting the modulatory signal after binding has occurred.

*   **N-terminal Domain (Amino Acids 1-27):** This entire region acts as a key functional hotspot. Its sequence determines the specific modulatory signature of the beta-1 subunit, such as the magnitude and direction of the shift in the voltage-dependence of activation.
*   **D254 (Aspartate at position 254):** Located on the surface of the SH3 domain. Studies on homologous residues in other beta subunits show that its mutation can uncouple the physical binding from the modulatory effect on channel gating, indicating a specific role in allosteric communication.
*   **W239 (Tryptophan at position 239):** A structurally critical residue within the SH3 domain. The SH3 domain is implicated in secondary interactions that mediate modulation, and this residue is essential for the domain's integrity and function.
