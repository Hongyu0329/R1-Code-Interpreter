    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Reaction:** The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride involves the direct reaction between Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F2) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\n    Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n2.  **Understand the Factors Affecting the Reaction:** The synthesis of xenon fluorides is highly sensitive to the reaction conditions. The specific product obtained (XeF₂, XeF₄, or XeF₆) depends on three main factors:\n    *   **Temperature:** Provides the necessary activation energy for the reaction to occur.\n    *   **Pressure:** Affects the concentration of the gaseous reactants.\n    *   **Molar Ratio of Reactants (Xe:F₂):** Determines which fluoride is favored.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conditions for XeF₄ Synthesis:** To produce Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) specifically and efficiently, a particular set of conditions is required.\n    *   **Reactant Ratio:** A molar excess of fluorine is needed. A typical ratio is 1 part Xenon to 5 parts Fluorine (1:5). If there is an excess of Xenon, Xenon difluoride (XeF₂) will be the primary product. If there is a very large excess of Fluorine and higher pressure/temperature, Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) will form.\n    *   **Temperature:** The reaction requires a significant amount of heat to overcome the activation energy. The standard, well-established laboratory and industrial method for synthesizing XeF₄ involves heating the reactants in a sealed vessel (usually made of nickel or Monel, which are resistant to fluorine) to a specific temperature.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Role of Temperature and \"Efficiency\":**\n    *   The term \"efficiently\" implies a good reaction rate and a high yield of the desired product (XeF₄) without significant formation of byproducts (XeF₂ or XeF₆).\n    *   **Low Temperatures (e.g., -78 °C, 0 °C, 78 °C, 200 °C):** At these lower temperatures, the rate of the thermal reaction between xenon and fluorine is extremely slow. The molecules lack sufficient kinetic energy to react upon collision. Therefore, production would be highly inefficient or practically non-existent.\n    *   **High Temperatures (e.g., 600 °C):** At very high temperatures, the reaction is driven further, favoring the formation of the xenon fluoride with the highest oxidation state, which is Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆), especially if fluorine is in excess. Thus, 600 °C is not optimal for producing XeF₄ efficiently.\n    *   **Optimal Temperature:** The scientific literature and standard chemical practice establish that the synthesis of XeF₄ is carried out efficiently at approximately **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds at a reasonable rate, and the formation of XeF₄ is maximized relative to XeF₂ and XeF₆, given the correct reactant ratio (1:5) and pressure (around 6 atm).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of \"Efficient\":** This is key. It means a practical and reasonable rate of production. While some reaction might occur at 300 °C, it would be much slower. 400 °C is the widely accepted temperature for an efficient process.\n*   **Other Synthesis Methods:** While the question allows \"any method,\" the most common, reliable, and thus \"efficient\" method is direct thermal synthesis. Alternative methods like photochemical synthesis (using UV light) can operate at lower temperatures but are often less efficient in terms of yield and purity for large-scale preparation. The question and answer choices are clearly pointing towards the standard thermal method.\n*   **Selectivity:** The temperature must be high enough for the reaction to proceed but not so high that it produces the wrong product (XeF₆). 400 °C strikes this balance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, 400 °C is the standard and optimal temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride via the direct reaction of its elements. Temperatures significantly lower than this result in an impractically slow reaction rate, while higher temperatures favor the formation of a different product (XeF₆). Therefore, among the given choices, 400 °C represents the coldest temperature at which the process is considered efficient.\n\n<<<B>>>"
