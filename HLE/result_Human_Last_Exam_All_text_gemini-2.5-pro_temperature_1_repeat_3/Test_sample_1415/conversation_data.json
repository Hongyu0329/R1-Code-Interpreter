    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral Form**\n\nThe integral we need to evaluate is `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\nThis integral is in the standard form `∫ (u'(x)/u(x)) dx`, where `u(x) = F₃(x)` and `u'(x) = F₃'(x)`.\nThe antiderivative of `u'(x)/u(x)` is `ln|u(x)|`.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Definite Integral**\n\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the value of F₃(x) at the limits of integration (x=0 and x=1)**\n\nWe are given the following function definitions:\nF₀(x) = x\nF₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\nF₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\nF₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    1.  F₀(0) = 0\n    2.  F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n    3.  F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1\n    4.  F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    1.  F₀(1) = 1\n    2.  F₁(1) = sin(1)  *(Note: The argument of sin is in radians)*\n    3.  F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))\n    4.  F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the values back into the expression for V**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for F₃(1) and F₃(0) into our formula for V:\n`V = ln|ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))| - ln|ln(2)|`\n\n**Careful Point:** We must check if the arguments of the logarithms are positive to remove the absolute value signs.\n*   `ln(2)` is approximately 0.693, which is positive.\n*   For `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`:\n    *   The value of 1 radian is approximately 57.3 degrees. Since 0 < 1 < π/2, `sin(1)` is positive.\n    *   `e` raised to a positive power is greater than 1.\n    *   `1 + e^(sin(1))` is greater than 2.\n    *   The natural logarithm of a number greater than 2 is positive.\nSince both `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` are positive, we can safely remove the absolute value signs:\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can write V as:\n`V = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )`\n\n**Step 5: Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow we compute the numerical value of V and the final required value.\n1.  `sin(1)` ≈ 0.84147098\n2.  `e^(sin(1))` ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.31977085\n3.  `F₃(1) = ln(1 + 2.31977085) = ln(3.31977085) ≈ 1.2000009`\n4.  `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718`\n5.  `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) ≈ ln(1.2000009) - ln(0.69314718)`\n6.  `V ≈ 0.1823224 - (-0.3665129) ≈ 0.5488353`\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.5488353 = 5488.353`\nThe closest integer to 5488.353 is 5488.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
