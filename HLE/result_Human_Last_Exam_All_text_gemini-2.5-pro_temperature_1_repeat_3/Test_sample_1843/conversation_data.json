    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\n$N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$\n\n### Step 2: Understand the structure of Dirichlet characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\cdot \\chi_{3^2} \\cdot \\chi_7 \\cdot \\chi_{11} \\cdot \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a character modulo $p^k$.\n\n### Step 3: Conditions for a primitive character of conductor N\nFor $\\chi$ to be a primitive character with conductor $N$, each of its component characters $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be a primitive character with conductor $p^k$.\n-   $c(\\chi) = N \\iff c(\\chi_{2^2})=2^2, c(\\chi_{3^2})=3^2, c(\\chi_7)=7, c(\\chi_{11})=11, c(\\chi_{13})=13$.\n\n### Step 4: Condition on the order of the character\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\nWe are given that this order must be 6.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the component characters\nLet's determine the group structure of characters for each modulus and find the number and orders of the primitive characters. The group of characters modulo $m$, $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$, is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ (if $d|n$) is $\\phi(d)$.\n\n*   **Modulo $2^2=4$**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one primitive character, which is the non-trivial one. Its order is $o_4 = 2$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1.\n\n*   **Modulo $3^2=9$**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if its conductor is 9, which means it is not induced by a character modulo 3. The characters induced from modulo 3 are those whose orders divide $\\phi(3)=2$. So, a character $\\chi_9$ is primitive if its order does not divide 2. The possible orders of elements in $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ are 1, 2, 3, 6. The primitive characters are those of order 3 or 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    So, $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. A character is primitive if it is not the trivial character (which has conductor 1). So possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. Primitive characters are the non-trivial ones. Possible orders are 2, 5, 10.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**: The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. Primitive characters are the non-trivial ones. Possible orders are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\n### Step 6: Combine the conditions for order 6\nWe need $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6$.\nThis implies that the order of each component character, $o_{p^k}$, must divide 6.\n\nLet's check a crucial point. For any primitive character $\\chi$ of conductor $N$, what can we say about its order?\n-   $c(\\chi_4)=4 \\implies o_4=2$.\n-   $c(\\chi_9)=9 \\implies o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$, so $o_9$ is a multiple of 3.\nThe order of $\\chi$ is $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, \\dots) = \\text{lcm}(2, o_9, \\dots)$. Since $3|o_9$, the order of $\\chi$ must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nThis means that any primitive character of conductor $N$ must have an order that is a multiple of 6.\n\nTherefore, the condition \"order 6\" is equivalent to \"order divides 6\" for primitive characters of this specific conductor $N$. The problem simplifies to counting the number of primitive characters $\\chi$ of conductor $N$ for which $\\text{ord}(\\chi) | 6$.\n\n### Step 7: Count the number of valid component characters\nWe need to count the number of choices for each primitive $\\chi_{p^k}$ such that its order divides 6.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_4$**: Must be primitive, so $o_4=2$. $2|6$. Number of choices = 1.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_9$**: Must be primitive, so $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. Both orders divide 6.\n    Number of choices = (chars of order 3) + (chars of order 6) = $\\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_7$**: Must be primitive. Orders can be 2, 3, 6. All these divide 6.\n    Number of choices = (chars of order 2) + (chars of order 3) + (chars of order 6) = $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_{11}$**: Must be primitive. Orders can be 2, 5, 10. We need the order to divide 6. Only order 2 works.\n    Number of choices = (chars of order 2) = $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_{13}$**: Must be primitive. Orders can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\n    Number of choices = (chars of order 2) + (chars of order 3) + (chars of order 6) = $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 8: Calculate the total number\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal Number = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
