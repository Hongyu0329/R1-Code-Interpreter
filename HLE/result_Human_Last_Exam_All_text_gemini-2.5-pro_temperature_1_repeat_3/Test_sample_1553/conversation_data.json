    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe question asks about the character married by the main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection). The protagonist and main character of this novel is Adam Zamoyski.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the main character's relationships.**\nAdam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century, is resurrected in the far future. He must navigate a world of post-human entities and advanced artificial intelligences. Throughout his journey, he forms a crucial and deep bond with a specific character who acts as his guide, protector, and partner.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the character the protagonist marries.**\nThis key partner is a \"stahs\" (a type of post-human). Her name is Angelika. Their relationship evolves throughout the novel, and they eventually decide to get married.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the context of the marriage.**\nThe marriage between Adam Zamoyski and Angelika is not just a romantic union. It is a significant event in the plot, serving as a powerful political and strategic alliance that solidifies Adam's position and power within the complex society of the future.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is essential to correctly identify the protagonist as Adam Zamoyski.\n*   One must distinguish Angelika from other characters Adam interacts with. His relationship with Angelika is the most central and is the one that leads to marriage.\n*   The concept of \"marriage\" in the novel's far-future setting is more complex than a traditional ceremony, but the event is explicitly referred to as a marriage in the book.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the plot of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\", the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries the post-human character named Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
