The laboratory's mistake was trusting a Quality Control (QC) result that was based on a flawed test organism. They used a very old, repeatedly subcultured strain of *Bacillus subtilis* which was likely weakened and more susceptible to antibiotics than environmental bacteria. While the degraded chloramphenicol in the improperly autoclaved Batch 3 was sufficient to inhibit this weak QC strain, it was not potent enough to inhibit the robust environmental bacteria that contaminated the media when it was left open to the air, leading to a false sense of security about the batch's quality.
