    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct gene to knock out.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Problem:** You have successfully engineered *Corynebacterium glutamicum* to synthesize p-coumaric acid. However, the bacterium's native metabolism is breaking down this newly produced compound, preventing its accumulation. The goal is to disable this degradation pathway.\n\n2.  **Identify the Degradation Pathway:** The first step is to identify how *C. glutamicum* naturally metabolizes p-coumaric acid. Like many soil bacteria, *C. glutamicum* can use various aromatic compounds as a source of carbon and energy. The most common and well-documented degradation pathway for p-coumaric acid in this organism involves the removal of the carboxyl group.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the Key Enzymatic Reaction:** The degradation of p-coumaric acid is initiated by an enzyme that converts it into a different compound. The specific reaction is the decarboxylation of p-coumaric acid to form 4-vinylphenol. This reaction removes the desired product from the metabolic pool, feeding it into a catabolic (breakdown) pathway.\n\n4.  **Identify the Responsible Enzyme:** The enzyme that catalyzes this decarboxylation reaction is known as **phenolic acid decarboxylase** (or sometimes p-coumarate decarboxylase). This enzyme is the primary culprit responsible for the loss of your product.\n\n5.  **Identify the Corresponding Gene:** To stop the enzyme from being produced, you must knock out the gene that codes for it. In *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, the gene encoding the phenolic acid decarboxylase is designated as **`pdc`**.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Solution:** By creating a knockout mutant of the `pdc` gene (i.e., deleting or inactivating it), the cell will no longer be able to produce the phenolic acid decarboxylase enzyme. Without this enzyme, the primary degradation pathway for p-coumaric acid is blocked, leading to its accumulation as desired.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Target the First Step:** In metabolic engineering, it is most effective to block the very first step of an unwanted pathway. This prevents the cell from wasting energy on intermediate steps and ensures the target molecule (p-coumaric acid) is preserved. The `pdc` gene controls this first critical step.\n*   **Specificity:** The `pdc` enzyme acts on p-coumaric acid and other similar phenolic acids (like ferulic acid). Knocking it out is a specific solution for this class of compounds and is unlikely to have major negative effects on the central metabolism when the bacterium is grown on a standard carbon source like glucose.\n*   **Well-Established Strategy:** Knocking out the `pdc` gene is a standard, scientifically validated approach used by researchers to improve the production of p-coumaric acid and its derivatives in *C. glutamicum*.\n*   **Alternative Pathways:** While `pdc` represents the major degradation route, minor, less active degradation pathways might exist. However, blocking the `pdc`-mediated pathway is the most critical and impactful step for increasing product yield.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the degradation of p-coumaric acid is initiated by the enzyme phenolic acid decarboxylase. To prevent this degradation, the gene encoding this enzyme must be knocked out. This gene in *Corynebacterium glutamicum* is known as `pdc`. Therefore, knocking out the `pdc` gene is the correct strategy.\n\n<<<pdc>>>"
