    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron commercial.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Elements of the Question:**\n    *   **Company:** Enron\n    *   **Year:** 2000\n    *   **Campaign Tagline:** \"Ask Why\"\n    *   **Subjects:** Two Nobel laureates\n\n2.  **Research the \"Ask Why\" Campaign:** In 2000, Enron launched a major advertising campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why.\" The goal was to rebrand the company from just an energy pipeline company to an innovative, forward-thinking global corporation dealing in complex markets and ideas. The commercials were intended to lend intellectual credibility to the brand.\n\n3.  **Identify the First Individual:** One of the prominent figures featured in these television commercials was **Myron Scholes**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** We must verify his Nobel status at the time of the commercial. Myron Scholes, along with Robert C. Merton, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1997**. Therefore, when the commercial aired in 2000, he was already a Nobel laureate.\n\n4.  **Identify the Second Individual:** The other well-known economist featured in the campaign was **Paul Krugman**.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Crucial Detail):** We must verify his Nobel status at the time of the commercial. Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008**. This means that at the time the commercial aired in 2000, he was a highly respected economist (a professor at MIT) but *not yet* a Nobel laureate. However, he is almost always referred to as a \"Nobel laureate\" in retrospective discussions of this infamous commercial because he did eventually win the prize. The question asks which two Nobel laureates were featured, and he fits this description, albeit with the award coming later.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The two figures from the world of economics featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercials were Myron Scholes, who was a Nobel laureate at the time, and Paul Krugman, who would go on to win the Nobel prize eight years later.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
