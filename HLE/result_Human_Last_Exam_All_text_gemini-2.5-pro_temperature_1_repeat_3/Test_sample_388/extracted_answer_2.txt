The pharmacist should counsel Allison that her antidepressant, Fluoxetine (an SSRI), has a significant interaction with the aspirin (an NSAID) in the Excedrin she took. Taking these two types of medications together significantly increases the risk of bleeding, especially stomach bleeding. The pharmacist should recommend that for future headaches, she choose a safer over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen (Tylenol) and avoid NSAIDs like aspirin and ibuprofen while she is on Fluoxetine.
