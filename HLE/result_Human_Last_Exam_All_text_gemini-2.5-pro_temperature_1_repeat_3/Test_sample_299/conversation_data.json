    "Answering the question: What is the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)?$\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Properties of the Function f**\n    Let the given equation be $f(f(x)) = e^x$. The function $g(x) = e^x$ is defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, its range is $(0, \\infty)$, it's continuous, and strictly increasing.\n\n    *   **Injectivity of f**: Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is injective, this implies $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, the function $f$ must be injective.\n\n    *   **Monotonicity of f**: A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n        *   **Case 1: f is strictly increasing.** If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$. Applying the increasing function $f$ again preserves the inequality: $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means $e^{x_1} < e^{x_2}$, which is true for $x_1 < x_2$. This case is consistent.\n        *   **Case 2: f is strictly decreasing.** If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality: $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means $e^{x_1} < e^{x_2}$, which is also true for $x_1 < x_2$. This case is also seemingly consistent.\n\n2.  **Rule out the Decreasing Case**\n    *   Let's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x)$ must approach a finite limit, say $a$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ must approach a finite limit, say $b$.\n    *   Consider the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $h(x) \\to a - \\infty = -\\infty$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $h(x) \\to b - (-\\infty) = +\\infty$.\n    *   Since $h(x)$ is continuous and its values range from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist a point $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $h(c) = 0$. This means $f(c) = c$.\n    *   A point $c$ such that $f(c)=c$ is called a fixed point of $f$. If such a point exists, then $f(f(c)) = f(c) = c$.\n    *   From the original equation, this would mean $e^c = c$. However, the equation $e^x=x$ has no real solutions (since $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$).\n    *   This contradiction shows that $f$ cannot have a fixed point. Therefore, our assumption that $f$ is strictly decreasing must be false.\n\n3.  **Properties of an Increasing Solution**\n    *   We are left with the conclusion that any solution $f$ must be strictly increasing.\n    *   Since $f$ has no fixed points, the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$ is continuous and never zero. Thus, it must be either always positive or always negative.\n        *   If $f(x) - x < 0$ for all $x$, then $f(x) < x$. Since $f$ is increasing, this implies $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would mean $e^x < x$, which is false for all real $x$.\n        *   If $f(x) - x > 0$ for all $x$, then $f(x) > x$. This implies $f(f(x)) > f(x) > x$. This is consistent with the fact that $e^x > x$.\n    *   So, any solution $f$ must be a strictly increasing continuous function satisfying $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n4.  **Construction of Solutions and Cardinality**\n    The existence of such functions can be demonstrated by construction. The construction shows that there is a large degree of freedom, allowing us to find the cardinality of the set of solutions.\n\n    *   Let's define $c = f(0)$. Since $f(x)>x$, we have $c > 0$. From the original equation, $f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$, so $f(c) = 1$. Since $f$ is increasing and $f(0)=c, f(c)=1$, we must have $0 < c < 1$.\n    *   Let's consider the behavior of $f$ on the interval $[0, c]$. It must be a continuous, strictly increasing function that maps $[0,c]$ to $[f(0), f(c)] = [c,1]$.\n    *   The core of the argument is that we can *choose* how $f$ behaves on this starting interval, and that choice will uniquely determine the function over all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n        *   **Freedom of Choice, Part 1**: We can choose any value for $c = f(0)$ as long as $c \\in (0,1)$. The set of possible values for $c$ is the open interval $(0,1)$, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., the set of real numbers).\n        *   **Freedom of Choice, Part 2**: For any fixed choice of $c \\in (0,1)$, we must define $f$ on $[0,c]$ as a continuous, strictly increasing function $h: [0,c] \\to [c,1]$ such that $h(0)=c$ and $h(c)=1$. There are many such functions. For example, for any real number $a > 0$, the function $h_a(x) = (c^{1/a} + (1-c^{1/a})(x/c)^a)^a$ is one such function (this is a complicated family, simpler ones exist, like piecewise linear functions). We can construct a family of such functions parameterized by a real number, demonstrating that there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions. The set of all continuous functions on an interval has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, so there are at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices. Thus, for each choice of $c$, there are exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ possible functions for $f$ on $[0,c]$.\n\n    *   **Extension to all of $\\mathbb{R}$**: Once $f$ is defined on $[0,c]$, it is uniquely determined everywhere else.\n        *   For $x \\in [c, 1]$, $x$ is in the range of $f$ on $[0,c]$. So $x=f(y)$ for a unique $y \\in [0,c]$. Then $f(x) = f(f(y)) = e^y = e^{f^{-1}(x)}$.\n        *   This process can be continued to define $f$ for all $x \\ge 0$.\n        *   For $x < 0$, we can use the commutation relation $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$, which can be derived by applying $f$ to both sides of the original equation. This gives $f(x) = \\ln(f(e^x))$. Since $x<0 \\implies e^x \\in (0,1)$, and $f$ is already determined on $(0,1)$, this defines $f$ for all negative $x$.\n    *   It can be verified that this construction yields a function that is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$ and satisfies the original equation.\n\n5.  **Final Cardinality Calculation**\n    The set of solutions can be indexed by the pair $(c, h)$, where $c \\in (0,1)$ and $h$ is a continuous increasing bijection from $[0,c]$ to $[c,1]$.\n    *   The number of choices for $c$ is $|\\(0,1\\)| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   The number of choices for $h$ for a given $c$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   The total number of solutions is the cardinality of the set of these pairs, which is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the real numbers."
