    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Problem and Define the Sequences**\n\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `X(k)` is the 4-point DFT of `x(n) = {x(0), x(1), x(2), x(3)}`.\n*   `H(k)` is the 4-point DFT of `h(n) = {h(0), h(1), h(2), h(3)}`.\n\nThe given DFT values are:\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nWe need to find the 8-point DFT, let's call it `Y(k)`, for a new 8-point sequence `y(n)` which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n*   `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\n### **Step 2: Relate the New Sequence to the Original Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the new sequence `y(n)`. We can separate `y(n)` into its even-indexed and odd-indexed components.\n*   The even-indexed part of `y(n)`, let's call it `y_e(m)`, consists of the elements of `x(n)`.\n    *   `y_e(m) = y(2m) = {y(0), y(2), y(4), y(6)} = {x(0), x(1), x(2), x(3)} = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The odd-indexed part of `y(n)`, let's call it `y_o(m)`, consists of the elements of `h(n)`.\n    *   `y_o(m) = y(2m+1) = {y(1), y(3), y(5), y(7)} = {h(0), h(1), h(2), h(3)} = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) FFT Property**\n\nThe Decimation-In-Time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm provides a way to compute an N-point DFT from the (N/2)-point DFTs of its even and odd parts. In our case, N=8.\n\nThe formula relating the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to the 4-point DFTs of its even part (`y_e(m)`) and odd part (`y_o(m)`) is:\n*   `Y(k) = DFT{y_e(m)}[k] + W_8^k * DFT{y_o(m)}[k]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n*   `Y(k+4) = DFT{y_e(m)}[k] - W_8^k * DFT{y_o(m)}[k]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\nFrom Step 2, we know:\n*   `DFT{y_e(m)}` is the 4-point DFT of `x(m)`, which is `X(k)`.\n*   `DFT{y_o(m)}` is the 4-point DFT of `h(m)`, which is `H(k)`.\n\nSo, the formulas become:\n1.  `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n2.  `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\n**Careful Point:** This relationship is a fundamental property used in FFT algorithms. It's crucial to correctly identify the even and odd parts and their respective DFTs.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Twiddle Factors `W_8^k`**\n\nThe twiddle factor is defined as `W_N^k = e^(-j*2*pi*k/N)`. For N=8, we have `W_8^k = e^(-j*pi*k/4)`.\n*   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = e^(-j*pi/4) = cos(pi/4) - j*sin(pi/4) = (1/√2) - j(1/√2) = (1 - j)/√2`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*pi/2) = cos(pi/2) - j*sin(pi/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = e^(-j*3*pi/4) = cos(3*pi/4) - j*sin(3*pi/4) = -(1/√2) - j(1/√2) = (-1 - j)/√2`\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the 8-point DFT values `Y(k)`**\n\nWe will now compute `Y(k)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7` using the formulas from Step 3.\n\n*   **For k=0:**\n    *   `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1) * (0) = 1`\n    *   `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - (1) * (0) = 1`\n\n*   **For k=1:**\n    *   `W_8^1 * H(1) = ((1 - j)/√2) * (1 + j) = (1 - j^2)/√2 = (1 - (-1))/√2 = 2/√2 = √2`\n    *   `Y(1) = X(1) + W_8^1 * H(1) = j + √2`\n    *   `Y(5) = X(1) - W_8^1 * H(1) = j - √2`\n\n*   **For k=2:**\n    *   `W_8^2 * H(2) = (-j) * (1) = -j`\n    *   `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) = -1 - j`\n    *   `Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) = -1 + j`\n\n*   **For k=3:**\n    *   `W_8^3 * H(3) = ((-1 - j)/√2) * (1 - j) = (-1 * (1 + j) * (1 - j))/√2 = (-1 * (1 - j^2))/√2 = (-1 * 2)/√2 = -√2`\n    *   `Y(3) = X(3) + W_8^3 * H(3) = -j + (-√2) = -j - √2`\n    *   `Y(7) = X(3) - W_8^3 * H(3) = -j - (-√2) = -j + √2`\n\n### **Step 6: Combine the Results**\n\nCombining all the calculated values, we get the final 8-point DFT `Y(k)`:\n*   `Y(0) = 1`\n*   `Y(1) = √2 + j`\n*   `Y(2) = -1 - j`\n*   `Y(3) = -√2 - j`\n*   `Y(4) = 1`\n*   `Y(5) = -√2 + j`\n*   `Y(6) = -1 + j`\n*   `Y(7) = √2 - j`\n\nThe complete 8-point DFT vector is:\n`Y(k) = [1, √2 + j, -1 - j, -√2 - j, 1, -√2 + j, -1 + j, √2 - j]`\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2) + j, -1 - j, -sqrt(2) - j, 1, -sqrt(2) + j, -1 + j, sqrt(2) - j]>>>"
