    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph Structure**:\n    *   **Graph Type**: The problem specifies a \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\". A standard barbell graph is formed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge (a bridge).\n    *   **Number of Nodes**: Since there are 10 nodes in total, the two cliques must be of equal size. Therefore, each clique has $10 / 2 = 5$ nodes. The graph is composed of two complete graphs on 5 vertices, denoted as $K_5$.\n    *   **The Bottleneck Edge**: This is the critical edge that connects the two $K_5$ cliques. It is the only path between the two halves of the graph, hence the term \"bottleneck\". There is only one such edge in this graph.\n\n2.  **Understand the Process**:\n    *   **Randomized Uniform Gossiping**: This describes a specific protocol for selecting an edge. The standard model for this process is as follows:\n        1.  First, a node `u` is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all nodes in the graph.\n        2.  Second, a neighbor `v` of the chosen node `u` is selected uniformly at random from its set of neighbors.\n    *   **Sampling an Edge**: The edge `(u, v)` selected through this two-step process is the \"sampled edge\". The question asks for the probability that this specific sampled edge is the bottleneck edge.\n\n3.  **Identify Careful Points and Necessary Calculations**:\n    *   **Node Degrees are Crucial**: The probability of selecting a neighbor in step 2 of the gossiping process depends on the degree of the node chosen in step 1 (i.e., `1/degree(u)`). Therefore, we must calculate the degrees of the nodes in the graph.\n    *   **Two Types of Nodes**: In this barbell graph, there are two distinct types of nodes based on their connectivity:\n        *   **Bridge Nodes**: These are the two nodes that are the endpoints of the bottleneck edge. Let's call them $u_b$ and $v_b$. Each is connected to 4 other nodes within its own $K_5$ clique and to the other bridge node. Thus, the degree of these two nodes is $4 + 1 = 5$.\n        *   **Internal Clique Nodes**: These are the remaining nodes. In each $K_5$ clique, there are $5 - 1 = 4$ such nodes. They are only connected to the other 4 nodes within their own clique. Thus, their degree is 4. In total, there are $2 \\times 4 = 8$ such nodes.\n    *   **The event \"sampling the bottleneck edge\"**: Let the bottleneck edge be $e_b = (u_b, v_b)$. This edge can be sampled in two mutually exclusive ways:\n        1.  We select node $u_b$ first, then its neighbor $v_b$.\n        2.  We select node $v_b$ first, then its neighbor $u_b$.\n        The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Define variables and parameters.**\n*   Total number of nodes, $|V| = 10$.\n*   The bottleneck edge is $e_b = (u_b, v_b)$.\n*   The degree of the bridge nodes are $deg(u_b) = 5$ and $deg(v_b) = 5$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in the direction $u_b \\to v_b$.**\n*   The probability of selecting node $u_b$ from all 10 nodes is $P(u_b) = \\frac{1}{|V|} = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n*   Given that $u_b$ was selected, the probability of selecting its neighbor $v_b$ is $P(v_b | u_b) = \\frac{1}{deg(u_b)} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n*   The combined probability for this event is $P(u_b \\to v_b) = P(u_b) \\times P(v_b | u_b) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in the direction $v_b \\to u_b$.**\n*   The probability of selecting node $v_b$ from all 10 nodes is $P(v_b) = \\frac{1}{|V|} = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n*   Given that $v_b$ was selected, the probability of selecting its neighbor $u_b$ is $P(u_b | v_b) = \\frac{1}{deg(v_b)} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n*   The combined probability for this event is $P(v_b \\to u_b) = P(v_b) \\times P(u_b | v_b) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge.**\n*   The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events.\n*   $P(\\text{sample } e_b) = P(u_b \\to v_b) + P(v_b \\to u_b) = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}$.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is $\\frac{1}{25}$, which is $0.04$.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
