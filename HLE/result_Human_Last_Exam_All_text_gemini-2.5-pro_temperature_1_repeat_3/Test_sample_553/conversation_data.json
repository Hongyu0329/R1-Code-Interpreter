    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Musical Terminology in the Question**\n\n*   **\"Tonic\" chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major.\n*   **\"Fifth\" chord (V):** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In a major key, this chord is naturally a major chord (or a dominant 7th). For example, in C major, the fifth chord (V) is G major.\n*   **\"Minor fifth chord\" (v):** This is the crucial part of the question. It specifies that the chord built on the fifth note of the scale is a *minor* chord, not the naturally occurring major chord. Using our C major example, the minor fifth chord (v) would be G minor. This is a non-diatonic chord, meaning it uses a note from outside the C major scale (in this case, Bb instead of B), creating a distinct, often wistful or melancholic sound.\n\nSo, the question is asking for a Beatles song in a major key that starts with the chord progression **I -> v**.\n\n**Step 2: Searching for the Progression in The Beatles' Catalog**\n\nWe need to find a song that begins with this specific major-to-minor chord change, where the root of the minor chord is a perfect fifth above the root of the major tonic chord.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: \"Michelle\"**\n    *   This song is often the first to come to mind for unusual opening chords.\n    *   The song's key center is F. The song famously starts with a progression from an **F major** chord to an **F minor** chord.\n    *   In the key of F major, F major is the tonic (I). F minor is the minor tonic (i).\n    *   The progression is **I -> i**, not I -> v. Therefore, \"Michelle\" is not the correct answer, although it features a similar major-to-minor shift.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: \"I'll Be Back\"**\n    *   This song also features a prominent major-to-minor shift at the very beginning.\n    *   It starts with an **A major** chord followed immediately by an **A minor** chord.\n    *   In the key of A major, this is a **I -> i** progression, the same type as in \"Michelle\". This is not the correct answer.\n\n*   **Candidate 3: \"The Fool on the Hill\"**\n    *   This song is from the *Magical Mystery Tour* album.\n    *   The main key of the song is **D major**. The tonic chord (I) is **D major**.\n    *   The fifth note of the D major scale is A. The minor fifth chord (v) would therefore be **A minor**.\n    *   Let's analyze the start of the song. After a short recorder introduction, the first line of the verse begins.\n        *   The line \"Day after day...\" is sung over a **D major** chord (the tonic, I).\n        *   The line then moves to \"...alone on a hill,\" and the chord changes to an **A minor** chord (the minor fifth, v).\n    *   This creates the exact progression the question describes: **D major -> A minor**, which is **I -> v**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nWhile other Beatles songs like \"Michelle\" feature a notable major-to-minor chord shift at the beginning, they use a I -> i (major tonic to minor tonic) progression. The song that precisely matches the description of starting with a chord jump from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth chord (v) is \"The Fool on the Hill\".\n\n<<<The Fool on the Hill>>>"
