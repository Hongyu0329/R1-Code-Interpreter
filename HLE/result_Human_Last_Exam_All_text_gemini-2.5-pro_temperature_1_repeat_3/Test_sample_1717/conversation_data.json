    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Base Health of the Eye of Cthulhu**\nFirst, we need the boss's starting health value in Normal Mode. According to the game's data, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 2,800 HP in Normal Mode.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Expert Mode Health Modifier**\nIn Expert Mode, the health of bosses is increased. Unlike standard enemies which typically have their health doubled, many bosses have unique multipliers. For the Eye of Cthulhu, the Expert Mode health for a single player is 3,640 HP.\nWe can verify this multiplier:\n`3640 (Expert Health) / 2800 (Normal Health) = 1.3`\nSo, the initial Expert Mode multiplier for the Eye of Cthulhu is 1.3x. This 3,640 HP value serves as the new base for multiplayer scaling.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula**\nIn Expert Mode, boss health increases for each additional player in the world. The formula for this health scaling is:\n`Total Health = BaseExpertHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))`\nWhere:\n*   `BaseExpertHealth` is the boss's health for one player in Expert Mode (3,640 HP for the Eye of Cthulhu).\n*   `0.35` represents a 35% health increase for each additional player.\n*   `NumberOfPlayers` is the number of active players on the server.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Cap for Player Scaling**\nThe question specifies a \"theoretical maximum\" given an \"infinite number of players\". If the formula were applied without limits, the health would also approach infinity. However, the game's source code includes a hard-coded limit to prevent this. The calculation for player-based health scaling caps the `NumberOfPlayers` variable at a maximum of **1,000**.\nTherefore, to find the theoretical maximum health, we must perform the calculation using 1,000 players.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Health Value**\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n*   `BaseExpertHealth` = 3,640\n*   `NumberOfPlayers` (capped) = 1,000\n\nCalculation:\n1.  Start with the player-scaling portion: `(NumberOfPlayers - 1)`\n    `1000 - 1 = 999`\n2.  Multiply by the 35% factor: `0.35 * 999`\n    `0.35 * 999 = 349.65`\n3.  Add this to the base multiplier of 1 (for the first player): `1 + 349.65`\n    `1 + 349.65 = 350.65`\n4.  Finally, multiply this total multiplier by the single-player Expert Mode health: `3640 * 350.65`\n    `3640 * 350.65 = 1,276,366`\n\nThe final result is an integer, as game health values are stored as integers.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Mode-Specific Health:** The calculation must start with the Expert Mode health (3,640 HP), not the Normal Mode health.\n2.  **Scaling Factor:** The health scales by 35% of the *single-player Expert Mode health* for each extra player, not 35% of the Normal Mode health.\n3.  **The \"Infinite Players\" Catch:** This is the most crucial part of the question. \"Infinite\" does not mean the value is limitless; it means you must use the maximum value allowed by the game's internal mechanics, which is the 1,000-player cap for the health scaling formula.\n4.  **Boss-Specific Multipliers:** It's important to know that the initial Expert Mode health increase is not the same for all bosses. Using a generic 2x multiplier would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\nThe theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is **1,276,366 HP**.\n\n<<<1276366>>>"
