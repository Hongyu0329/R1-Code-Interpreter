    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve.\n\n**1. The Curve and the Valuation**\n\nWe are given the curve $C$ defined by the equation:\n$z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\nWe are working \"above 2\", which means we consider the field of 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The valuation $v$ is the standard 2-adic valuation, normalized so that $v(2)=1$.\n\n**2. Finding a Better Model**\n\nThe given equation defines a model over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let's examine its special fiber by reducing the equation modulo 2:\n$z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2 \\implies (z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\nThe special fiber is a double line ($z=1$) over the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1_x$. This is a highly singular model, and the reduction is not stable. To find the stable reduction, we need to find a better model of the curve, which we can obtain through birational transformations.\n\nA standard first step is to transform the equation into a more standard \"Weierstrass\" form, where the polynomial on the right side is monic and has integral coefficients.\nLet's try a substitution of the form $x = c X$ and $z = d Z$.\nLet $x = X/2$. Then the equation becomes:\n$z^2 = 2(X/2)^5 + 2(X/2)^3 + 1$\n$z^2 = 2(X^5/32) + 2(X^3/8) + 1$\n$z^2 = X^5/16 + X^3/4 + 1$\nTo clear denominators, we multiply by 16:\n$16z^2 = X^5 + 4X^3 + 16$\nLet $Z = 4z$. The equation becomes:\n$Z^2 = X^5 + 4X^3 + 16$\nThis new model, let's call it $\\mathcal{C}'$, is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and is birationally equivalent to the original curve $C$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. Therefore, they have the same stable reduction.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Special Fiber of the New Model**\n\nLet's look at the special fiber of $\\mathcal{C}'$ by reducing its equation modulo 2:\n$Z^2 \\equiv X^5 \\pmod 2$\nThe special fiber is the curve $Z^2 = X^5$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This curve has a non-nodal singularity (a cusp) at the origin $(X,Z)=(0,0)$. This reduction is still not stable. The stable model is obtained by resolving this singularity.\n\n**4. The Singularity and its Resolution**\n\nThe singularity is of the form $Z^2 = X^5$. This is a well-studied plane curve singularity, often denoted as the $A_4$ singularity. The stable reduction process involves a sequence of blow-ups of the singular point in the special fiber. While we can perform these blow-ups explicitly, we can also use known results about the invariants of such singularities.\n\nOne key invariant is the conductor exponent (or simply conductor) of the singularity. The conductor measures how \"far\" the singular ring is from its normalization. For a plane curve singularity, the conductor is related to the Milnor number $\\mu$ and the delta-invariant $\\delta$. For a singularity of the form $y^k = x^n$ with $\\gcd(n,k)=1$, the conductor is given by $(n-1)(k-1)$.\nIn our case, $Z^2=X^5$, we have $k=2, n=5$. The conductor is $(5-1)(2-1) = 4$.\n\n**5. The Thickness of the Double Point**\n\nThe stable reduction of a curve with a singularity of type $y^2=x^{2g+1}$ (here $g=2$) over a field of characteristic not 2 consists of two components, one of genus $g-1$ and one of genus 0, meeting at a single node. The thickness of this node is given by $2g-1$. For our case, this would be $2(2)-1=3$.\n\nHowever, we are in characteristic 2, and the model has other terms: $Z^2 = X^5 + 4X^3 + 16$. These lower-order terms, which are divisible by powers of 2, affect the structure of the resolved model. The process of resolving the singularity $Z^2 = X^5$ in the model $Z^2 - X^5 - 4X^3 - 16 = 0$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ will result in a stable model.\n\nThe \"thickness\" of a double point in the special fiber of a stable model is the integer $n$ in the local equation $uv=\\pi^n$, where $u,v$ are local coordinates and $\\pi$ is the uniformizer of the base ring (here, $\\pi=2$). This integer $n$ is a measure of the arithmetic structure of the node.\n\nFor a singularity arising from a model of the form $Y^2 = X^n + \\text{lower order terms}$, the thickness of the resulting node(s) is closely related to the conductor of the singularity $Y^2=X^n$. The conductor captures the arithmetic information contained in the lower-order terms.\n\nIn our case, the singularity is $Z^2=X^5$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, embedded in the arithmetic surface defined by $Z^2 = X^5 + 4X^3 + 16$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The conductor of this arithmetic singularity is precisely the valuation of the constant term that perturbs the singularity, as long as the valuations of other perturbing terms are high enough. Here, the constant term is 16, and $v(16)=4$. The term $4X^3$ has $v(4)=2$, which is smaller, but its effect is \"spread out\" along the $X$-axis. The essential arithmetic information at the singular point $(0,0)$ is governed by the constant term 16.\n\nThe conductor of the singularity of the model $Z^2 = X^5+4X^3+16$ at $(0,0)$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is 4. In the context of stable reduction, this conductor is realized as the thickness of the double point that is formed during the resolution process. In this specific case, the stable model will have a single irreducible component of geometric genus 1, with one node of thickness 4.\n\nThe arithmetic genus is preserved: $p_a(\\mathcal{C}')=2$. The geometric genus of the special fiber is $g_s=1$. The number of nodes is $\\delta=1$. The formula $p_a = g_s + \\delta$ holds ($2 = 1+1$).\n\nFinal check: The integer we are looking for is the conductor of the singularity $Z^2=X^5$ as defined by the equation $Z^2 - X^5 - 4X^3 - 16 = 0$. This can be shown to be 4.\n\nFinal answer is 4."
