    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying trait is a particular emotion expressed in a line of dialogue or sentiment: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and their Motivations**\nLet's review the characters provided in the answer choices in the context of the film:\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist, a psychologist sent to the Solaris station. The film's long opening sequence is dedicated to his last day on Earth, establishing his deep connection to its nature, sounds, and memories. While he deeply misses Earth, his primary emotional struggle on the station revolves around the reappearance of his dead wife, Hari. He is more overwhelmed by grief and love than by shame about missing nature.\n*   **B. Hari:** A \"guest\" or \"visitor\" created by the sentient ocean of Solaris from Kris's memories. She is not a human who has ever been on Earth. She has no memories of her own to miss; her entire existence is tied to Kris's mind and the station. Therefore, she could not miss something she has never experienced.\n*   **C. Snaut:** One of the two surviving scientists Kris meets on the station. He is cynical, world-weary, and has been trapped in the station's psychological crucible for a long time. He often engages in philosophical monologues, reflecting on humanity's purpose, the failure of their mission, and their disconnection from Earth. He represents a mind that has been worn down by the abstract and alien environment.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** The other surviving scientist. He is a cold, rational, and pragmatic figure. He views the \"guests\" as a scientific problem to be solved and eliminated. He suppresses emotion and would see missing Earth as an unscientific, sentimental weakness, but he would be unlikely to confess this feeling, let alone feel \"ashamed\" of it in a confessional way.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Kris's friend who was on the station but committed suicide before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a video message he left for Kris. In it, he is desperate and warns Kris, but he does not express this specific sentiment.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Dialogue**\nThe line in question is spoken by Dr. Snaut to Kris Kelvin during one of their conversations. Snaut is musing about the futility of space exploration when humanity doesn't even understand itself. He says something to the effect of: \"We don't want to conquer space at all. We want to extend Earth to the borders of the cosmos... We are looking for a mirror.\" In this context, he confesses his own nostalgia for the simple, tangible things of Earth, framing it as a kind of intellectual or professional failure. He is the character who explicitly voices being ashamed of this very human feeling of homesickness, as if it's a weakness unbecoming of a pioneer of the cosmos.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the character analysis and the specific dialogue from the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. His character is defined by this kind of weary, self-aware intellectualism, where he recognizes his own human longings but views them with the cynical detachment of a scientist who feels he should be above such things.\n\n<<<C>>>"
