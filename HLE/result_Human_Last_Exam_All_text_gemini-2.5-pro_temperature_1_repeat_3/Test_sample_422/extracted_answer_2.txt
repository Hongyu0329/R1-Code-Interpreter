Based on the premises, the two problems that the JTB definition of knowledge runs into are:

1.  **Definitional Contradiction:** The JTB theory defines knowledge as a specific type of belief (a justified, true one). This means that to know something, one must necessarily believe it. However, the constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the only two available epistemic states makes them mutually exclusive. This creates a paradox: to be in the state of "Knowledge," one cannot be in the state of "Belief," but the JTB definition requires belief as a necessary condition for knowledge. Therefore, knowledge becomes logically impossible to attain under these rules.

2.  **The Diminished Role of Justification:** The JTB framework values justification as the key component that makes a belief rational and a candidate for knowledge. However, in the two-state system, any belief that is not knowledge (i.e., is false or unjustified) is simply categorized as "Belief." This lumps epistemically valuable states, like a **justified false belief** (e.g., a conclusion from strong but misleading evidence), into the exact same category as a completely **unjustified belief** (e.g., a random guess). The system fails to recognize the crucial epistemic difference between a rational person who is wrong and an irrational person, thereby devaluing the role of justification for any belief that isn't also true.
