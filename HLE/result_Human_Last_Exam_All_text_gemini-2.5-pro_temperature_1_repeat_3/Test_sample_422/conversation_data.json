    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question's Premises\n1.  **Core Definition:** We must use the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge. This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, the following three conditions must be met:\n    *   P is true.\n    *   S believes P.\n    *   S is justified in believing P.\n2.  **Core Constraint 1:** The only available epistemic states are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. This is a hypothetical and highly restrictive condition. It implies that for any proposition, a person is either in the state of \"Knowing\" it or \"Believing\" it (if they have any cognitive attitude towards it at all). This setup forces them to be mutually exclusive categories.\n3.  **Core Constraint 2:** We must **ignore Gettier problems**. Gettier problems are specific counterexamples showing that one can have a justified true belief that isn't knowledge (usually due to luck). Ignoring them means we must find problems inherent in the JTB definition itself when combined with the first constraint.\n4.  **The Goal:** Identify two distinct problems that arise for the JTB definition under these specific conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Careful Points and Implications\n*   **Relationship between Knowledge and Belief:** According to the JTB definition, Knowledge is a *subset* of Belief. If you know something, you must, by definition, also believe it. The set of things you know is a smaller, more specific category within the larger set of things you believe.\n*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** The constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the *only* available states forces them into a binary opposition. If you are in state A, you cannot be in state B. This is the key source of conflict.\n*   **What constitutes \"Belief\" in this system?:** If \"Knowledge\" is JTB, then the state of \"Belief\" must be defined as \"any belief that is *not* knowledge.\" This means the \"Belief\" category must include:\n    *   Justified False Beliefs (JFB)\n    *   Unjustified True Beliefs (UTB)\n    *   Unjustified False Beliefs (UFB)\n*   **The Role of Justification:** In the JTB model, justification is what provides the rational grounding for a belief, making it a candidate for knowledge. Its role is central to epistemology. We need to see how the constrained system affects this role.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Two Problems\n\n**Problem 1: The Problem of Definitional Contradiction**\n\n1.  **JTB Premise:** Knowledge is a type of belief. To know P, you must believe P. (Knowledge âŠ† Belief).\n2.  **System Constraint:** The only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief. This forces them to be mutually exclusive. For any proposition P, your state is *either* Knowledge *or* Belief. You cannot be in both states simultaneously.\n3.  **The Contradiction:** These two points are logically incompatible. The JTB definition requires that the \"Belief\" condition be met to achieve \"Knowledge.\" However, the system's constraint says that if you are in the state of \"Knowledge,\" you are by definition *not* in the state of \"Belief.\" Therefore, the \"Belief\" condition of the JTB definition can never be satisfied if one achieves Knowledge. This makes the JTB definition of knowledge impossible within this system.\n\n**Problem 2: The Problem of the Ambiguous Status of Justification**\n\n1.  **The Importance of Justification:** The JTB framework relies heavily on the concept of justification to distinguish knowledge from a lucky guess (an unjustified true belief). A justified belief is considered epistemically superior to an unjustified one, even if it turns out to be false. For example, a scientist with a theory based on strong evidence has a justified belief, which is epistemically valuable.\n2.  **Categorization in the System:** In our constrained two-state system, any belief that falls short of being knowledge is simply categorized as \"Belief.\"\n3.  **Lumping Together:** This means the state of \"Belief\" becomes a catch-all category that includes both **Justified False Beliefs** (the scientist's well-supported but incorrect theory) and **Unjustified Beliefs** (believing something based on a whim or superstition).\n4.  **The Problem:** The system fails to distinguish between a belief that is rational and well-supported (justified) and one that is irrational or arbitrary (unjustified), so long as neither qualifies as knowledge. It lumps the rational-but-mistaken person in with the irrational person. This undermines the epistemic significance of justification. Justification becomes a simple on/off switch for achieving knowledge, rather than a valuable epistemic property in its own right that can apply to beliefs that are not knowledge.\n\n---\n<<<\nBased on the premises, the two problems that the JTB definition of knowledge runs into are:\n\n1.  **Definitional Contradiction:** The JTB theory defines knowledge as a specific type of belief (a justified, true one). This means that to know something, one must necessarily believe it. However, the constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the only two available epistemic states makes them mutually exclusive. This creates a paradox: to be in the state of \"Knowledge,\" one cannot be in the state of \"Belief,\" but the JTB definition requires belief as a necessary condition for knowledge. Therefore, knowledge becomes logically impossible to attain under these rules.\n\n2.  **The Diminished Role of Justification:** The JTB framework values justification as the key component that makes a belief rational and a candidate for knowledge. However, in the two-state system, any belief that is not knowledge (i.e., is false or unjustified) is simply categorized as \"Belief.\" This lumps epistemically valuable states, like a **justified false belief** (e.g., a conclusion from strong but misleading evidence), into the exact same category as a completely **unjustified belief** (e.g., a random guess). The system fails to recognize the crucial epistemic difference between a rational person who is wrong and an irrational person, thereby devaluing the role of justification for any belief that isn't also true.\n>>>"
