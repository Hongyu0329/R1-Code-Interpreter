    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial and find its splitting field's Galois group.**\n\nLet the given polynomial be $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe first try to factor this polynomial. By rearranging terms, we can find a common factor:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\nLet's analyze $h(x) = x^2 - 2$.\nThe roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2).\n\nLet's analyze $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n1.  **Irreducibility:** Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n    *   The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3.\n    *   All other coefficients (-9, 0, 0, 3) are divisible by 3.\n    *   The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2 = 9$.\n    Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Galois Group:** Let $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$, where $K_g$ is the splitting field of $g(x)$.\n    *   Since $g(x)$ is irreducible of degree 5, $G_g$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\n    *   We determine the number of real roots of $g(x)$. The derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. There are two real critical points.\n    *   Let $x_0 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. $g(x_0) = (9/5)x_0 - 9x_0 + 3 = 3 - (36/5)x_0 < 0$ since $x_0 \\approx 1.16$ and $3 - 7.2 \\times 1.16 < 0$. This is a local minimum.\n    *   Let $x_1 = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. $g(x_1) = -(9/5)x_1 - 9x_1 + 3 = 3 + (36/5)x_0 > 0$. This is a local maximum.\n    *   Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has three real roots.\n    *   As $g(x)$ has degree 5, it must have $5-3=2$ non-real complex roots, which must be a conjugate pair.\n    *   Complex conjugation is an automorphism of $K_g$ that swaps these two roots and fixes the three real roots. This corresponds to a transposition in $G_g \\subseteq S_5$.\n    *   $G_g$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$ that contains a transposition and an element of order 5 (a 5-cycle, since the degree is 5). The only such subgroup is $S_5$ itself.\n    *   Therefore, $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\nNow, we determine the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ of the compositum $K = K_g K_h$.\n$G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G_g \\times G_h \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$. The structure of $G$ depends on the intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe intersection is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so it is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subseteq K_g$.\nThe Galois group $G_g \\cong S_5$ has exactly one normal subgroup of index 2, which is $A_5$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, $K_g$ contains a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$, where $\\Delta_g$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n+px+q$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}((1-n)^{n-1}p^n + n^n q^{n-1})$.\nFor $g(x)=x^5-9x+3$, we have $n=5, p=-9, q=3$.\n$\\Delta_g = (-1)^{10}((-4)^4(-9)^5 + 5^5 3^4) = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\nThe unique quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, which is an imaginary quadratic field.\nSince $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe order of the group is $|G| = |S_5| \\times |C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the possible degrees of normal sub-extensions.**\n\nWe are looking for the possible degrees $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these degrees correspond to the indices $|G:H| = |G|/|H|$ for all proper, non-trivial, normal subgroups $H$ of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\nLet's find the normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $G$ include:\n1.  **Product subgroups:** Subgroups of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\triangleleft S_5$ and $N_2 \\triangleleft C_2$.\n    *   $H = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H|=60$. Index $|G:H| = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H|=120$. Index $|G:H| = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H|=2$. This is the center $Z(G)$, so it's normal. Index $|G:H| = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H = A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H|=120$. Index $|G:H| = 240/120 = 2$.\n    (We exclude the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ and the whole group $S_5 \\times C_2$).\n\n2.  **Other (\"skew\") normal subgroups:**\n    Let's consider a homomorphism $\\psi: S_5 \\times C_2 \\to \\{-1, 1\\}$, where we identify $C_2$ with the multiplicative group $\\{-1, 1\\}$, defined by $\\psi(g, c) = \\text{sgn}(g) \\cdot c$.\n    This is a surjective homomorphism, so its kernel is a normal subgroup of index 2.\n    $\\ker(\\psi) = \\{ (g,c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(g) \\cdot c = 1 \\}$.\n    *   If $c=1$, we need $\\text{sgn}(g)=1$, so $g \\in A_5$. This gives the elements $(g, 1)$ for $g \\in A_5$.\n    *   If $c=-1$, we need $\\text{sgn}(g)=-1$, so $g$ is an odd permutation ($g \\in S_5 \\setminus A_5$). This gives the elements $(g, -1)$ for $g \\in S_5 \\setminus A_5$.\n    This subgroup, let's call it $H_{diag}$, consists of $|A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$ elements.\n    The index of $H_{diag}$ is $|G:H_{diag}| = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThese are all the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\n**Step 3: List all the possible degrees.**\n\nThe possible degrees $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ are the indices we calculated:\n*   Index of $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$ is 4.\n*   Index of $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$ is 2.\n*   Index of $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$ is 120.\n*   Index of $A_5 \\times C_2$ is 2.\n*   Index of $H_{diag}$ is 2.\n\nThe set of all possible distinct degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
