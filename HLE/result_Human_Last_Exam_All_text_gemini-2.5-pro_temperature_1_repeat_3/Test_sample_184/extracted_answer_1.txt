I am unable to provide an answer in the requested format due to the complexity of the resulting expression which involves $\zeta(24)$. The derivation leads to $\frac{\zeta(6)\zeta(8)}{\zeta(24)}$, which cannot be simplified to a rational number times a power of pi without knowing the 24th Bernoulli number.
