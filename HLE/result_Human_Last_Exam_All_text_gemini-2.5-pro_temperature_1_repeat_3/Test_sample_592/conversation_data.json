    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (Hard Boiled Egg)\n*   **Year:** 1997\n*   **Character:** Tommaso\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n*   **Action:** Moves to the United States\n*   **Information needed:** The specific US city he moves to.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the character's role in the film's plot.**\nTommaso is the best friend of the protagonist, Piero Mansani. He comes from a wealthy, bourgeois family, which contrasts with Piero's working-class background. Tommaso is portrayed as rebellious and troubled.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the specific plot point regarding his move.**\nThroughout the film, Tommaso's rebellious nature leads him into trouble, including involvement with a neo-fascist group. To get him away from these negative influences and force him to mature, his father makes the decision to send him abroad.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the destination mentioned in the film's narrative.**\nBy reviewing detailed plot summaries and analyses of the film *Ovosodo*, we can find the specific location. The narrative explicitly states that Tommaso's father sends him to live and study in the United States. The city mentioned is Philadelphia. This move is a significant event, marking the divergence of Tommaso's and Piero's life paths.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Ensure the character is correct. The question is about Tommaso (Marco Cocci), not the main protagonist Piero (Edoardo Gabbriellini).\n*   Verify the information from reliable sources about the film's plot, such as film encyclopedias, detailed reviews, or plot synopses.\n*   The move is not a choice made by Tommaso himself but rather a decision imposed by his father.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the US city.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
