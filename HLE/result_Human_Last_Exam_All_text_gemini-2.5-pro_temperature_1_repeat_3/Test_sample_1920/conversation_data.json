    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conductor and the properties of the character\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the conductor $d$.\n1.  **Factorize the conductor $d$**:\n    $d = 53599$. We check for small prime factors.\n    $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$\n    $7657 = 13 \\times 589$\n    $589 = 19 \\times 31$\n    So, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n    The conductor is a product of distinct odd primes, which is a square-free integer.\n\n2.  **Structure of Dirichlet characters**:\n    A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free integer $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p_i$.\n\n3.  **Condition for being primitive**:\n    The conductor of $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_r$ is the product of the conductors of its components, $f_\\chi = f_{\\chi_1} f_{\\chi_2} \\dots f_{\\chi_r}$.\n    A character $\\chi_i$ modulo a prime $p_i$ has a conductor of $p_i$ if it is not the principal character, and a conductor of 1 if it is the principal character.\n    For $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $d=p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$, each component $\\chi_i$ must have conductor $p_i$. This means that none of the component characters $\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4$ can be the principal character. The principal character is the unique character of order 1.\n    Therefore, the condition of being primitive implies that the order of each component character must be greater than 1: $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) > 1$ for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\n4.  **Order of the character**:\n    The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\n    We are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\n### Step 2: Combine the conditions and count the possibilities\n\nWe need to find the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ that satisfy:\n(a) For each prime $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, $\\chi_p$ is a character modulo $p$.\n(b) $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p) > 1$ for all $p$. (Primitivity condition)\n(c) $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$. (Order condition)\n\nFrom condition (c), the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be a divisor of 6. The divisors of 6 are {1, 2, 3, 6}.\nCombining this with condition (b), the possible orders for each component character are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of component characters for each possible order\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ in this group is $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's check this for our primes:\n*   **Modulo 7**: $\\phi(7) = 6$. The orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 6.\n*   **Modulo 13**: $\\phi(13) = 12$. The orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 12.\n*   **Modulo 19**: $\\phi(19) = 18$. The orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 18.\n*   **Modulo 31**: $\\phi(31) = 30$. The orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 30.\n\nSo, for each of the four components, characters of order 2, 3, and 6 exist. The number of such characters is:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = (2-1)(3-1) = 2$.\n\nFor each component $p$, the set of allowed characters (those with order in {2, 3, 6}) has size $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 4: Use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find the final count\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ where each $\\chi_p$ has an order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. The total number of such tuples is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nWe need the lcm of the orders to be exactly 6. The lcm is 6 if and only if:\n(A) At least one character has an order divisible by 2.\n(B) At least one character has an order divisible by 3.\n\nWe will count the number of tuples that *do not* satisfy this condition and subtract them from the total. The condition fails if (A) is false or (B) is false.\n*   **Case 1: (A) is false.** The order of every component character is not divisible by 2.\n    From the allowed orders {2, 3, 6}, this means every character must have order 3.\n    For each component, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ such characters.\n    The number of such tuples is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   **Case 2: (B) is false.** The order of every component character is not divisible by 3.\n    From the allowed orders {2, 3, 6}, this means every character must have order 2.\n    For each component, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ such character.\n    The number of such tuples is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nThe two cases are disjoint, as in Case 1 all orders are 3, and in Case 2 all orders are 2. Therefore, the total number of tuples that fail the lcm=6 condition is $16 + 1 = 17$.\n\nThe number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ and order 6 is the total number of tuples in $S$ minus those that fail the condition:\nNumber = (Total tuples in S) - (Tuples failing the lcm condition)\nNumber = $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
