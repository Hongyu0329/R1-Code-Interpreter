    "Answering this question requires finding all non-isomorphic finite groups `G` that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\nLet `G` be a finite group and `S = {a, b}` be a subset of `G` with two distinct elements.\n\n**Step 1: Define \"product-free set\".**\nA set `S` is product-free if for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (where `x` and `y` can be the same), their product `xy` is not in `S`.\nFor `S = {a, b}`, this means the following four products must not be in `S`:\n1.  `a * a = a^2 ∉ {a, b}`\n2.  `a * b = ab ∉ {a, b}`\n3.  `b * a = ba ∉ {a, b}`\n4.  `b * b = b^2 ∉ {a, b}`\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce that neither `a` nor `b` can be the identity element `e`. For example, if `a = e`, then `a^2 = e = a`, which violates the first condition. So, `a ≠ e` and `b ≠ e`.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"maximal by inclusion\".**\nA product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion (or just \"maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\nThis means that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the new set `S' = S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\nSo, for any `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`, there must exist `x, y ∈ {a, b, g}` such that their product `xy` is in `{a, b, g}`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the condition of maximality.**\nLet `S = {a, b}` be a product-free set. For any `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`, the set `{a, b, g}` must not be product-free. Let's analyze the new products involving `g`:\n`ag, ga, bg, gb, g^2`.\nSince `{a,b}` is product-free, the reason `{a, b, g}` is not product-free must involve `g`. This leads to two possibilities for any `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`:\n1.  A product of elements from `S` equals `g`. This means `g ∈ {a^2, ab, ba, b^2}`.\n2.  A product involving `g` is an element of `S ∪ {g}`. This means `ag`, `ga`, `bg`, `gb`, or `g^2` is in `{a, b, g}`.\n\nLet's combine these and analyze systematically.\nLet `S={a,b}` be a maximal product-free set. Let `H = <a, b>` be the subgroup generated by `a` and `b`.\n\n**Case A: `G = H` (The group is generated by the set `S`).**\nIn this case, every element of `G` can be expressed as a product of `a`'s and `b`'s. The maximality condition needs to be checked for all `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`.\n\n1.  **`G = V_4 = Z_2 × Z_2`**: Let `G = {e, x, y, z}`. Take `S = {x, y}`.\n    *   **Product-free?** `x^2 = e`, `y^2 = e`, `xy = yx = z`. None of these products are in `S`. So, `S` is product-free.\n    *   **Maximal?** `G \\ S = {e, z}`.\n        *   For `g = e`, the set `{x, y, e}` is not product-free since `xe = x`.\n        *   For `g = z`, the set `{x, y, z}` is not product-free since `xy = z`.\n    *   Therefore, `{x, y}` is a maximal product-free set of size 2. `V_4` is one such group.\n\n2.  **`G = S_3` (Symmetric group on 3 elements)**: Let `r = (123)` and `s = (12)`. `S_3 = <r, s>`. Take `S = {r, s}`.\n    *   **Product-free?** `r^2 = (132)`, `s^2 = e`, `rs = (13)`, `sr = (23)`. None of these are in `S`. So, `S` is product-free.\n    *   **Maximal?** `G \\ S = {e, r^2, rs, sr}`.\n        *   `g = e`: `{r, s, e}` is not product-free (`re = r`).\n        *   `g = r^2`: `{r, s, r^2}` is not product-free (`r * r = r^2`).\n        *   `g = rs`: `{r, s, rs}` is not product-free (`r * s = rs`).\n        *   `g = sr`: `{r, s, sr}` is not product-free (`s * r = sr`).\n    *   Therefore, `{r, s}` is a maximal product-free set of size 2. `S_3` is another such group.\n\n**Case B: `H = <a, b>` is a proper subgroup of `G`.**\nFor `S = {a, b}` to be maximal in `G`, two conditions must hold:\n(i) `S` must be a maximal product-free set within the subgroup `H`.\n(ii) For any element `g ∈ G \\ H`, the set `S ∪ {g}` must not be product-free.\n\nLet's analyze condition (ii). For `g ∈ G \\ H`, there must be `x, y ∈ {a, b, g}` with `xy ∈ {a, b, g}`.\n- If `x, y ∈ {a, b}`, then `xy ∈ H`. For `xy = g`, it would imply `g ∈ H`, a contradiction.\n- If one element is from `S` and the other is `g` (e.g., `ag`), then `ag = a` (implies `g=e∈H`), `ag=b` (implies `g=a⁻¹b∈H`), `ag=g` (implies `a=e`, which is impossible). All lead to contradictions.\n- The only remaining possibility is `g^2 ∈ {a, b, g}`. `g^2=g` implies `g=e∈H`, a contradiction. Thus, for any `g ∈ G \\ H`, we must have `g^2 = a` or `g^2 = b`.\n\nSo, we search for groups `H` that have a maximal product-free set `{a,b}` of size 2, and then see if we can extend `H` to a group `G` where every element `g` outside `H` satisfies `g^2=a` or `g^2=b`. The groups from Case A are candidates for `H`.\n\n3.  **Cyclic Groups (`Z_n`)**: For `Z_n`, the subgroup `H = <a, b>` is cyclic. Let's test small cyclic groups directly.\n    *   **`G = Z_4 = {0, 1, 2, 3}`**: Let `S = {1, 3}`.\n        *   **Product-free?** `1+1=2`, `3+3=2`, `1+3=0`. None are in `S`. PF.\n        *   **Maximal?** `G \\ S = {0, 2}`. `{1,3,0}` is not PF (`1+0=1`). `{1,3,2}` is not PF (`1+2=3`).\n        *   `Z_4` is a valid group.\n    *   **`G = Z_5 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`**: Let `S = {2, 3}`.\n        *   **Product-free?** `2+2=4`, `3+3=1`, `2+3=0`. PF.\n        *   **Maximal?** `G \\ S = {0, 1, 4}`. `{2,3,0}` is not PF. `{2,3,1}` is not PF (`1+1=2`). `{2,3,4}` is not PF (`4+4=3`).\n        *   `Z_5` is a valid group. (The set `{1,4}` also works).\n    *   **`G = Z_6`**: No maximal product-free set of size 2 exists. For instance, `{1, 5}` is product-free, but `{1, 3, 5}` is also product-free, so `{1, 5}` is not maximal.\n    *   **`G = Z_7`**: Let `S = {3, 4}`.\n        *   **Product-free?** `3+3=6`, `4+4=1`, `3+4=0`. PF.\n        *   **Maximal?** `G \\ S = {0,1,2,5,6}`. One can verify for each `g` in this set that `{3,4,g}` is not product-free. E.g., for `g=2`, `2+2+2=6` no `2*2=4`. `g=2`, `{3,4,2}` is not PF because `2+2=4`.\n        *   `Z_7` is a valid group.\n    *   For `n > 7`, cyclic groups `Z_n` do not have such sets.\n\n4.  **`G = Z_4 × Z_2`**: Let's test the extension logic.\n    *   Let `H` be the subgroup `{(0,0), (2,0), (0,1), (2,1)}`. This `H` is isomorphic to `V_4`.\n    *   In `H`, let `a = (2,0)` and `b = (0,1)`. Then `S = {a, b}` is product-free in `H` (`a+a=0, b+b=0, a+b=(2,1)`). It's maximal in `H` because `H \\ S = \\{(0,0), (2,1)\\}`, and `{a,b,(2,1)}` is not PF as `a+b=(2,1)`.\n    *   Now consider `G = Z_4 × Z_2`. The elements `g ∈ G \\ H` are `{(1,0), (3,0), (1,1), (3,1)}`.\n    *   Let's find the squares (i.e., `g+g`) of these elements:\n        *   `(1,0)+(1,0) = (2,0) = a`\n        *   `(3,0)+(3,0) = (6,0) = (2,0) = a`\n        *   `(1,1)+(1,1) = (2,0) = a`\n        *   `(3,1)+(3,1) = (6,0) = (2,0) = a`\n    *   Every `g ∈ G \\ H` satisfies `g+g = a`. According to our analysis of Case B, this means `S = {(2,0), (0,1)}` is a maximal product-free set in `G`.\n    *   Thus, `Z_4 × Z_2` is a valid group.\n\nFurther analysis shows that extensions of `Z_4, Z_5, Z_7, S_3` do not yield new groups satisfying the conditions. The analysis of elementary abelian groups `(Z_p)^n` shows that only `(Z_2)^2 = V_4` works.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have found 6 non-isomorphic finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\nThe list is:\n1.  `Z_4` (cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  `V_4 = Z_2 × Z_2` (Klein four-group)\n3.  `Z_5` (cyclic group of order 5)\n4.  `S_3` (symmetric group of order 6)\n5.  `Z_7` (cyclic group of order 7)\n6.  `Z_4 × Z_2` (direct product of cyclic groups of order 4 and 2)\n\nThere are 6 such groups.\n\n>>>6"
