    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the name of the fictional singer represented by a cardboard cutout at the Junior prom in a specific episode of \"Homestar Runner\".\n2.  **Break down the key information:**\n    *   **Series:** \"Homestar Runner\"\n    *   **Sub-series:** \"Teen Girl Squad\"\n    *   **Episode Number:** 15\n    *   **Event:** Junior prom\n    *   **Performer type:** Cardboard cutout\n    *   **Character type:** Fictional singer\n3.  **Recall or research the episode's content:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" is about the girls attending their Junior Prom. A running gag in the episode is the low-budget nature of the prom.\n4.  **Focus on the musical entertainment:** Instead of a live band, the prom's \"live entertainment\" is explicitly shown to be a cardboard cutout on the stage.\n5.  **Examine the cardboard cutout:** The camera zooms in on the cutout. It is a drawing of a male singer with spiky hair. Text is written on the cutout to identify the performer.\n6.  **Read the text on the cutout:** The text on the cutout reads: \"Live* On Stage! KAISER of the band ALL THE TIMES (*Cardboard)\".\n7.  **Extract the singer's name:** Based on the text, the fictional singer's name is \"Kaiser\". He is the singer for the fictional band \"All the Times\".\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The question specifically asks for the *fictional singer*, not the band name. The singer's name is Kaiser.\n*   It's important to be precise about the episode number (#15), as other episodes have different plots.\n*   The detail about the performer being a *cardboard cutout* is a key part of the joke and the question, confirming we are looking at the correct scene. The cutout even has an asterisk pointing to the word \"Cardboard\" to clarify it isn't a live performance.\n*   The name \"Kaiser\" is a creation for the Homestar Runner universe, fitting the criteria of a \"fictional singer\".\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nFollowing the steps above, the analysis of the visual information presented in \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" during the Junior prom scene reveals the name of the fictional singer on the cardboard cutout. The name is clearly written as \"Kaiser\".\n\n<<<Kaiser>>>"
