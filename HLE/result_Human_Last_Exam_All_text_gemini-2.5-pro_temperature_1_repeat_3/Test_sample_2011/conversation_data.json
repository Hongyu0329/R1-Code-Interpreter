    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nFirst, let's break down the question into its core components:\n\n*   **\"Consider all graphs on exactly n = 128 vertices.\"**\n    This sets the context. We are working with graphs, which consist of a set of 128 vertices and a set of edges connecting pairs of these vertices. Let's call such a graph G.\n*   **\"a clique\"**\n    A clique in a graph is a subset of its vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge). A clique of size `k` is a clique containing `k` vertices.\n*   **\"induced subgraphs\"**\n    Given a graph G = (V, E) and a subset of vertices S ⊆ V, the induced subgraph G[S] is the graph whose vertex set is S and whose edge set consists of all edges in E that have both endpoints in S.\n*   **\"clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs\"**\n    This means we are looking for a single graph G. For each desired clique size `k`, we must be able to find a subset of `k` vertices in G such that the subgraph induced by these `k` vertices is a complete graph (a K_k).\n*   **\"Determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\"**\n    The final goal is to find the maximum value for `m`, where `m` is the number of distinct integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m` that can all be the sizes of induced cliques within a single graph G on 128 vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the \"Induced Clique\" Condition\n\nA key point is to understand what \"an induced subgraph of size `k` that is a clique\" means.\n\nLet S be a set of `k` vertices. For the induced subgraph G[S] to be a clique (isomorphic to K_k), it must be a complete graph on `k` vertices. This means that for every pair of distinct vertices `u, v` in S, the edge `(u, v)` must be present in G. This is precisely the definition of the set S being a clique of size `k` in the graph G.\n\nTherefore, the phrase \"a clique of size `k` appearing as an induced subgraph\" is equivalent to the simpler statement \"the graph contains a clique of size `k`\". The \"induced\" property is automatically satisfied for any set of vertices that forms a clique. This is a crucial clarification; for other structures like paths or cycles, the \"induced\" constraint is much more restrictive.\n\nSo, the problem can be rephrased as: **What is the maximum number of different clique sizes that a single graph on 128 vertices can contain?**\n\n### Step 3: Establish an Upper Bound\n\nLet G be any graph with `n = 128` vertices.\nLet `S = {k_1, k_2, ..., k_m}` be the set of different clique sizes present in G. We want to maximize `m = |S|`.\n\nFor a graph to contain a clique of size `k`, it must have at least `k` vertices. Since our graph G has only 128 vertices, the size of any clique in G cannot exceed 128.\nThis means that any clique size `k` found in G must satisfy `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`.\n\nThe set `S` of different clique sizes is therefore a subset of the set of integers `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\nThe maximum possible size of a subset of `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}` is 128.\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n\n### Step 4: Construct a Graph to Achieve the Upper Bound\n\nNow, we need to show that this upper bound of 128 is achievable. We must find a specific graph G on 128 vertices that contains cliques of 128 different sizes.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted K_128. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nLet's check the clique sizes present in K_128:\n*   **Can we find a clique of size 1?** Yes, any single vertex forms a clique of size 1.\n*   **Can we find a clique of size 2?** Yes, any pair of vertices are connected, so they form a clique of size 2.\n*   **Can we find a clique of size k?** For any integer `k` such that `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`, we can choose any subset of `k` vertices from K_128. Since all vertices in a complete graph are mutually adjacent, any such subset forms a clique of size `k`.\n\nTherefore, the graph K_128 contains cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., all the way up to 128. The set of different clique sizes in K_128 is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`. The number of elements in this set is 128.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  We established that no graph on 128 vertices can have more than 128 different clique sizes. This gives us an **upper bound of 128**.\n2.  We constructed a specific graph, the complete graph K_128, which contains exactly 128 different clique sizes ({1, 2, ..., 128}). This shows that the **upper bound is achievable**.\n\nCombining these two points, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n*Careful Point:* It is important not to misinterpret the question as being about *maximal* cliques (cliques that cannot be extended) or *disjoint* cliques. The question as stated is about the simple presence of cliques of various sizes. The phrasing \"induced subgraphs\" is a technicality that, in the case of cliques, does not add a further constraint compared to simply finding a clique.\n\n<<<128>>>"
