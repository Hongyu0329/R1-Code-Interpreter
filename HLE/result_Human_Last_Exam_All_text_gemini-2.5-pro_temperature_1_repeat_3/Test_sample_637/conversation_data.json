    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer.\n\n### **1. Problem Formulation**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system:\n*   State equation: `x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n*   Output equation: `y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nThe system matrices are:\n`A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]`\n`B = [[0], [1], [-1], [1]]`\n`C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThe goal is to design an observer of the form:\n`x̂(k+1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - ŷ(k))`\nwhere `x̂` is the estimated state, `ŷ = Cx̂` is the estimated output, and `L` is the observer gain matrix.\n\nThe design objective is to make the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k)` equal to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is known as a deadbeat observer design.\n\n### **2. Error Dynamics**\n\nThe dynamics of the observation error are given by:\n`e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nFor the error to become identically zero after a finite number of steps, `p`, for any initial error `e(0)`, the error dynamics matrix `(A - LC)` must be nilpotent, meaning `(A - LC)^p = 0`. The shortest possible number of steps `p` is equal to the observability index `v` of the system `(A, C)`.\n\n### **3. Observability Analysis**\n\nFirst, we must check if the system is observable. The system is observable if the observability matrix `O` has full rank (`rank(O) = n`, where `n` is the number of states, which is 4).\n\n`O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]`\n\n*   `C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n*   `CA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`\n*   `CA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [0, 1, 0, -4]]`\n\nLet's check the rank of the partial observability matrices to find the observability index `v`.\n*   `rank(C) = 2`.\n*   `rank([C; CA]) = rank([[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[-1,0,0,1],[-2,0,1,0]])`. The rows span a 3-dimensional space (e.g., cannot generate `[0,1,0,0]`). So, `rank = 3`.\n*   `rank([C; CA; CA^2]) = rank([[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[-1,0,0,1],[-2,0,1,0],[0,0,1,-2],[0,1,0,-4]])`. The row `[0, 1, 0, -4]` is linearly independent of the previous rows. Thus, the rank is 4.\n\nSince `rank([C; CA; CA^2]) = 4 = n`, the system is observable. The observability index is `v = 3`. This means the error can be made zero in 3 steps. We must design `L` such that `(A - LC)^3 = 0`.\n\n### **4. Observer Design using Duality**\n\nDesigning `L` for `A - LC` is equivalent to designing a state-feedback controller `K_d` for the dual system `(A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T)`. The observer gain is then `L = K_d^T`. The poles of `A - LC` are the same as the poles of `A^T - C^T L^T`. We want to find `K_d = L^T` such that the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A^T - C^T K_d` satisfies `A_cl^3 = 0`.\n\nThe dual system matrices are:\n*   `A_d = A^T = [[-1, 1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, -1, -1]]`\n*   `B_d = C^T = [[1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\nThe gain `K_d` is a `2x4` matrix.\n`K_d = [[k11, k12, k13, k14], [k21, k22, k23, k24]]`\n\nThe condition `A_cl^3 = 0` implies that the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `λ^4 = 0`. We need to choose `K_d` to satisfy this, and also to ensure the largest Jordan block of `A_cl` is of size at most 3.\n\nA simple way to achieve this is to choose a target matrix `A_cl` that is known to be nilpotent with index 3, and then solve for `K_d`. A suitable target matrix is one with a Jordan form `diag(J_3(0), J_1(0))` or `diag(J_2(0), J_2(0), ...)` etc. Let's choose a target `A_cl` that is simple and satisfies `A_cl^3 = 0`.\nLet's try: `A_cl_target = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]`.\nLet's check its nilpotency:\n*   `A_cl_target^2 = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n*   `A_cl_target^3 = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]] = 0`\nThis target matrix works.\n\nNow we solve for `K_d` using the equation `A_cl = A_d - B_d K_d`, which means `B_d K_d = A_d - A_cl_target`.\n\n`A_d - A_cl_target = [[-1, 1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, -1, -1]] - [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n`A_d - A_cl_target = [[-1, 1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 2, -1, -1]]`\n\nNow we compute `B_d K_d`:\n`B_d K_d = [[1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]] * [[k11, k12, k13, k14], [k21, k22, k23, k24]]`\n`B_d K_d = [[k11+k21, k12+k22, k13+k23, k14+k24], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [k21, k22, k23, k24]]`\n\nEquating `B_d K_d` with `A_d - A_cl_target`:\n1.  From the 4th row:\n    `[k21, k22, k23, k24] = [1, 2, -1, -1]`\n2.  From the 1st row:\n    `[k11+k21, k12+k22, k13+k23, k14+k24] = [-1, 1, 0, -1]`\n\nSubstitute the values from step 1 into step 2 to find `k1x`:\n*   `k11 + 1 = -1  => k11 = -2`\n*   `k12 + 2 = 1   => k12 = -1`\n*   `k13 + (-1) = 0 => k13 = 1`\n*   `k14 + (-1) = -1 => k14 = 0`\n\nSo, the controller gain for the dual system is:\n`K_d = [[-2, -1, 1, 0], [1, 2, -1, -1]]`\n\n### **5. Final Observer Gain**\n\nThe observer gain `L` is the transpose of `K_d`:\n`L = K_d^T`\n`L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]`\n\nThis gain matrix `L` will place the eigenvalues of `(A-LC)` such that `(A-LC)^3 = 0`, ensuring the observation error becomes zero in exactly 3 steps, the shortest time possible.\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
