    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):**\n    SNP heritability is a population-level parameter. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (a trait like height or disease risk) that can be explained by the combined effects of all the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are commonly measured on a genotyping chip. It is the *theoretical upper limit* or ceiling on the predictive power that could ever be achieved using a linear model of these specific SNPs, assuming we had perfect knowledge of their true effects.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability:**\n    A Polygenic Score is a tool used to predict an individual's phenotype. It is constructed by taking a person's genotype data and summing up the effects of thousands or millions of SNPs. The \"effect\" of each SNP (its weight in the sum) is not its true, unknown effect. Instead, it is an *estimate* derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The predictive ability of the PGS is measured by how well it correlates with the actual phenotype in a new, independent sample of individuals. This is typically quantified as the proportion of variance explained (R²).\n\n3.  **Compare SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability:**\n    *   **Source of Information:** SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is a theoretical concept based on the *true*, underlying effects of all SNPs. The PGS is a practical tool based on *estimated* effects from a GWAS with a finite sample size.\n    *   **Estimation Error:** Because the SNP effects used to build a PGS are estimated from a finite sample, they are subject to statistical noise and error. The smaller the GWAS sample, the less precise these estimates are. This means the weights used in the PGS are imperfect.\n    *   **The Inevitable Gap:** Since the PGS is built with imperfect information (estimated weights) rather than perfect information (true weights), its ability to explain variance in the phenotype will be lower than the theoretical maximum possible. The SNP heritability represents this theoretical maximum.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on the Relationship:**\n    The predictive ability of a PGS (the R²) is limited by two main factors:\n    *   The SNP heritability (h²_SNP) itself. If the SNPs collectively only explain 30% of the variance in a trait, no PGS based on those SNPs can ever explain more than 30%.\n    *   The accuracy of the SNP effect size estimates, which depends heavily on the sample size of the GWAS used to generate them.\n\n    Therefore, the variance explained by a PGS is a fraction of the total SNP heritability. The R² of a PGS will approach the h²_SNP as the sample size of the discovery GWAS approaches infinity, but for any real-world, finite sample size, it will be lower.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Necessarily\"**: The word \"necessarily\" implies this is always true. Barring statistical artifacts (like evaluating the PGS on the same data it was trained on, which leads to overfitting, or random sampling error making one estimate look larger than another by chance), this relationship holds true from a theoretical and practical standpoint. The predictive accuracy in an independent sample is fundamentally bounded by the SNP heritability.\n*   **Target vs. Achievement**: Think of SNP heritability as the total amount of gold in a mine (the target). The PGS predictive ability is the amount of gold you have actually managed to extract with your current tools and technology (the achievement). Your achievement can never exceed the total amount of gold available.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that the predictive ability of a PGS is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability is correct. The SNP heritability defines the theoretical ceiling for prediction, and a PGS, being built on imperfect estimates, will always fall short of this ceiling.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
