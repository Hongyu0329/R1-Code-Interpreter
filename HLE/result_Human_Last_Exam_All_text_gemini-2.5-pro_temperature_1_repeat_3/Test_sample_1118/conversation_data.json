    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Painted after escaping from the Gestapo.\n*   **Question:** What object does he hold in his hand, and what is its symbolic meaning as an act of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork.**\nA search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933 Gestapo\" leads to a specific painting. The artist was indeed a member of the Communist Party and was arrested by the Nazis in 1933. After his release, he painted a powerful self-portrait. The title of this work is often given as \"Self-Portrait with Udder\" (Selbstbildnis mit Melkeuter).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the object being held.**\nBased on the title and visual analysis of the painting, Curt Querner is holding a cow's udder in his hand. It is a raw, fleshy, and unconventional object for a self-portrait.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the symbolism of the object as a form of resistance.**\nTo understand why he holds an udder, we need to consider the context:\n*   **Careful Point 1: Symbol of Life vs. Death.** An udder is a source of milk, representing life, sustenance, and nature. This stands in stark contrast to the Nazi regime, which Querner and his allies viewed as a force of destruction, war, and death. By holding a symbol of life, he defiantly opposes their ideology.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identification with the Working Class.** Querner was a prominent painter of the \"New Objectivity\" movement and his work often depicted the harsh realities of rural and working-class life. The udder, an object from a farm, connects him directly to the land and the proletariat (the working class). It is a declaration of his identity and solidarity with the people the Nazi party claimed to represent but were actively persecuting.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Artistic Resistance.** The Nazi regime promoted a specific style of art: heroic, idealized, and classical. Querner's style was the opposite. \"New Objectivity\" was about showing the unvarnished, often gritty, truth. Choosing to hold a raw, slightly grotesque object like an udder was an act of artistic rebellion against the state-sanctioned aesthetic.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Defiance and Unbroken Spirit.** The way he holds the object is not passive. He presents it to the viewer with a confrontational gaze. It is held almost like a weapon or a strange trophy. This posture signifies that despite being arrested and persecuted, his spirit is not broken, and he remains defiant.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings into a final answer.**\nIn his 1933 self-portrait painted after his persecution by the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a cow's udder. This object serves as a multi-layered symbol of resistance: it represents life against the Nazi ideology of death, reaffirms his identity with the rural working class, and acts as an artistic defiance against the heroic art style promoted by the state.\n\n<<<a cow's udder>>>"
