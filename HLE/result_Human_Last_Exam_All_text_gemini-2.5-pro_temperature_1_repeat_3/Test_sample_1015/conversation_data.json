    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a *cambré derrière* in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n\n**1. Understand the Terminology**\n*   **Cambré:** A French ballet term meaning \"arched.\" It describes a bend of the body from the waist, in any direction (forwards, backwards, or sideways).\n*   **Derrière:** A French ballet term meaning \"behind\" or \"back.\" So, *cambré derrière* is a backbend.\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A Russian ballet technique developed by Agrippina Vaganova. It is known for its precision, strength, and systematic approach, emphasizing core stability and clean lines.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** A style of ballet created by choreographer George Balanchine. It is characterized by speed, musicality, energy, and an extended, often \"off-balance\" aesthetic that pushes the boundaries of classical technique.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Movement in Each Method**\n\n*   **Vaganova Method Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Initiation:** The bend begins in the upper back (thoracic spine), lifting the chest towards the ceiling.\n    *   **Hips:** This is the most crucial point. The Vaganova method strictly requires the hips to remain stationary and square, directly over the supporting legs. The pelvis does not shift forward. The movement is purely an articulation of the spine.\n    *   **Head:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back.\n    *   **Arms:** Typically held in fifth position *en haut* (high fifth), the arms may open slightly at the peak of the bend but maintain their shape and support the back.\n    *   **Goal:** The primary goal is to develop spinal flexibility and strength while maintaining perfect alignment and stability in the lower body. It is a controlled and anatomically precise movement.\n\n*   **Balanchine Method Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Initiation:** The bend is often larger and more dynamic.\n    *   **Hips:** This is the key difference. In the Balanchine style, the dancer is encouraged to press the hips *forward*, away from the vertical alignment over the feet. This action acts as a counterbalance, allowing for a much deeper and more dramatic backbend.\n    *   **Head:** The head follows the movement, often with more freedom and expression.\n    *   **Arms:** The arms are often more open and extended, sometimes in a more *allongé* (elongated) line rather than a strictly held fifth position.\n    *   **Goal:** The goal is to create a visually striking and expansive line. The aesthetic effect and musicality often take precedence over the strict anatomical alignment prized in the Vaganova method.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there can be stylistic differences in arm placement, with Balanchine often favoring a more open *allongé* line, this is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the mechanics of the movement.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core technical difference. Vaganova insists on stable hips directly over the feet. Balanchine utilizes a forward press of the hips. This fundamental mechanical difference dictates the entire quality, depth, and aesthetic of the cambré.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is generally known for its speed, a *cambré* can be performed at various tempos in both methods. Speed is a quality of the choreography, not a defining technical difference of the step itself.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The Balanchine method typically achieves a deeper backbend, but this is a *result* of the hip placement. The forward-pressed hips allow for a greater arc. Therefore, the hip placement is the *cause*, and the degree of the bend is the *effect*. The question asks for the difference in the *method*, and the hip placement is that methodological difference.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head generally follows the line of the spine. Any minor stylistic variations are secondary to the major difference in hip and torso mechanics.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most significant and defining difference between a Vaganova *cambré derrière* and a Balanchine *cambré derrière* is the placement of the hips. The Vaganova method emphasizes pelvic stability, while the Balanchine method uses a forward hip press to achieve a more extreme line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
