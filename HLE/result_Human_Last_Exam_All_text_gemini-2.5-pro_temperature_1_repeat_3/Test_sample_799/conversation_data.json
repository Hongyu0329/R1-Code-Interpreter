    "Answering this question requires analyzing the properties of Sidon sets in the context of geometric measure theory, specifically using the concept of Hausdorff dimension. We need to find an upper bound on the dimension and show that this bound is achievable.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Sidon Set in $\\mathbb{R}$:** A set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if for any $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\in E$, the equality $x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4$ implies that the multisets $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ and $\\{x_3, x_4\\}$ are the same. This means that either $(x_1, x_2) = (x_3, x_4)$ or $(x_1, x_2) = (x_4, x_3)$. In essence, any number in the sum set $E+E = \\{a+b : a,b \\in E\\}$ has a unique representation as a sum of two elements from $E$, up to the order of the summands.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension ($\\dim_H$)**: A real number that quantifies the \"fractal\" dimension of a set. For our purposes, we will use some key properties of Hausdorff dimension:\n    *   $\\dim_H(A \\times B) = \\dim_H(A) + \\dim_H(B)$.\n    *   If $f: A \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ is a bi-Lipschitz map (i.e., $c_1|x-y| \\le |f(x)-f(y)| \\le c_2|x-y|$), then $\\dim_H(f(A)) = \\dim_H(A)$.\n    *   For a set $P$ in a product space (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}^2$), its dimension is related to the dimension of its projection and the dimensions of its \"fibers\" (slices). Specifically, $\\dim_H(P) \\le \\dim_H(\\pi(P)) + \\sup_{x} \\dim_H(P_x)$, where $\\pi$ is the projection and $P_x$ are the fibers.\n    *   The Hausdorff dimension of any set in $\\mathbb{R}$ is at most 1.\n\n**2. Finding an Upper Bound**\n\nLet $E \\subset [0, 1]$ be a Sidon set, and let its Hausdorff dimension be $s$, i.e., $\\dim_H(E) = s$.\n\n*   Consider the Cartesian product $E \\times E = \\{(x, y) : x, y \\in E\\}$. Using the product formula for Hausdorff dimension, we have $\\dim_H(E \\times E) = \\dim_H(E) + \\dim_H(E) = 2s$.\n\n*   Now, consider the linear map $\\psi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $\\psi(x, y) = (x+y, x-y)$. This map is a rotation and a scaling, and it is bi-Lipschitz on any bounded set. Therefore, it preserves the Hausdorff dimension of any set it acts upon. Let $P = \\psi(E \\times E)$. Then $\\dim_H(P) = \\dim_H(E \\times E) = 2s$.\n\n*   The set $P$ is given by $P = \\{(x+y, x-y) : x, y \\in E\\}$. Let's analyze this set. Let $u = x+y$ and $v = x-y$. The set $P$ is a subset of $(E+E) \\times (E-E)$.\n\n*   Let's project the set $P$ onto its first coordinate. Let $\\pi_1(u, v) = u$. The image of this projection is $\\pi_1(P) = \\{x+y : x, y \\in E\\} = E+E$.\n\n*   Now, we examine the \"fibers\" of this projection. For a fixed value $u_0 \\in E+E$, the fiber is the set $P_{u_0} = \\{v : (u_0, v) \\in P\\}$. A point $(u_0, v)$ is in $P$ if there exist $x, y \\in E$ such that $x+y=u_0$ and $x-y=v$.\n\n*   This is where the Sidon property becomes crucial. The Sidon property states that for any given $u_0$, there is at most one unordered pair of elements $\\{x, y\\}$ in $E$ such that $x+y=u_0$.\n    *   **Case 1:** The pair is of the form $\\{x, x\\}$ (i.e., the two elements are the same). In this case, $y=x$ and $u_0 = 2x$. There is only one ordered pair $(x,x)$ that sums to $u_0$. This gives a single point in the fiber, with $v = x-x = 0$.\n    *   **Case 2:** The pair is of the form $\\{x, y\\}$ with $x \\neq y$. In this case, there are two ordered pairs, $(x, y)$ and $(y, x)$, that sum to $u_0$. These correspond to two points in the fiber: $v_1 = x-y$ and $v_2 = y-x = -v_1$.\n\n*   In both cases, the fiber $P_{u_0}$ consists of at most two points. A finite set of points has a Hausdorff dimension of 0. So, for every $u_0 \\in E+E$, we have $\\dim_H(P_{u_0}) = 0$.\n\n*   Now we use the property relating the dimension of a set to the dimensions of its projection and fibers:\n    $\\dim_H(P) \\le \\dim_H(\\pi_1(P)) + \\sup_{u_0} \\dim_H(P_{u_0})$\n    Substituting the dimensions we found:\n    $2s \\le \\dim_H(E+E) + 0$\n\n*   The set $E$ is a subset of $[0, 1]$, so the sum set $E+E$ must be a subset of $[0, 2]$. Any set on the real line has a Hausdorff dimension of at most 1. Thus, $\\dim_H(E+E) \\le 1$.\n\n*   Combining our inequalities, we get:\n    $2s \\le 1 \\implies s \\le 1/2$.\n\nThis proves that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0, 1]$ cannot exceed $1/2$.\n\n**3. Showing the Bound is Achievable**\n\nThe second part of the problem is to show that this upper bound of $1/2$ can be achieved. This requires constructing a Sidon set in $[0, 1]$ that has a Hausdorff dimension of exactly $1/2$.\n\nThe construction of such a set is highly non-trivial. Simple constructions, like generalized Cantor sets based on Sidon sets of integers as digits, fail because the Sidon property of the digits does not guarantee the Sidon property of the resulting real numbers.\n\nHowever, such constructions have been successfully carried out using more advanced techniques, often involving probabilistic methods or more complex deterministic constructions that control the additive properties at each scale.\n\n*   Work by S. Astels (2000), and later by J. Cilleruelo and C. Vinuesa (2010), provides methods to construct such sets. They have shown how to \"transfer\" dense Sidon sets from the integers to create Sidon sets of real numbers.\n*   For instance, one can construct a random Cantor-like set $E = \\{ \\sum_{n \\in A} \\frac{\\epsilon_n}{3^n} : \\epsilon_n \\in \\{0,1\\} \\}$, where $A$ is a Sidon set of integers. With a careful choice of a dense Sidon set $A$ and appropriate techniques, it can be proven that the resulting set $E$ is, with high probability, a Sidon set, and its dimension can be made to be $1/2$.\n\nWhile the explicit construction is complex, the existence of a Sidon set $E \\subset [0, 1]$ with $\\dim_H(E) = 1/2$ is a known result in the field of combinatorial number theory and fractal geometry.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that for any Sidon set $E \\subset [0, 1]$, $\\dim_H(E) \\le 1/2$.\nFrom Step 3, we know that there exists a Sidon set $E \\subset [0, 1]$ for which $\\dim_H(E) = 1/2$.\nTherefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is $1/2$.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
