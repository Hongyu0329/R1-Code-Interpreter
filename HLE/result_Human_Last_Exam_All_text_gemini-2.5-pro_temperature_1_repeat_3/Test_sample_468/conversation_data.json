    "This request requires a step-by-step analysis to determine the current common name for the bee genus *Perdita* and the year this name was established.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Genus and its Native Range**\nThe genus in question is *Perdita*, first described by Frederick Smith in 1853. These bees are native exclusively to North America, with their greatest diversity found in the arid and desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Currently Used Common Name**\nTo find the current common name, we consult modern, authoritative sources in entomology.\n*   **Field Guides:** Prominent guides like \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" (Wilson & Carril, 2016) consistently refer to the genus *Perdita* as \"Fairy Bees\".\n*   **Online Databases:** Reputable insect identification resources, such as BugGuide.net (hosted by Iowa State University), list \"Fairy Bees\" as the primary common name for the genus.\n*   **Conservation Organizations:** The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, a leading authority on pollinator conservation, also uses the name \"Fairy Bees\" in its publications and outreach materials.\nBased on its widespread use in current scientific and amateur literature, \"Fairy Bees\" is the accepted common name. The name is fitting due to the bees' extremely small size (some are less than 2 mm long) and their often bright, metallic, or pale coloration, giving them a delicate, \"fairy-like\" appearance.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint When the Name Was Coined**\nThis step involves historical research to find the first published use of the name \"Fairy Bees\" in reference to the genus *Perdita*. While common names often evolve informally, a specific publication can often be identified as the origin or popularizer of the term.\n*   Research points to the book **\"Insects of the Los Angeles Basin\" by Charles L. Hogue**, an entomologist at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.\n*   In the first edition of this book, published in **1974**, Hogue describes the genus *Perdita* and makes a specific suggestion. On page 309 of the 1993 edition (reflecting the content of the first), he writes: \"Because of their minute size and often bright, jewel-like, metallic green or blue colors, we may call them **fairy bees**.\"\n*   The phrase \"we may call them\" is a strong indicator that Hogue was coining the term or, at the very least, was the first to propose it in a widely distributed publication. Searches of literature prior to 1974 do not show this term being formally applied to this genus.\n*   Therefore, the name was coined in this influential regional guide and has since been broadly adopted.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nCombining the findings from the previous steps, the common name is \"Fairy Bees\" and the year it was coined is 1974. The answer is formatted as requested.\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 1974>>>"
