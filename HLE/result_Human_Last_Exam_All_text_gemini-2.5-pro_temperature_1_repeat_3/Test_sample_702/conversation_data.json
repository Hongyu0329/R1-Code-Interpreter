    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the question and the objects involved\nThe question asks for the connectivity of a map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\nLet's define the objects:\n*   $S^n$ is the n-sphere.\n*   $\\Omega X$ is the based loop space of a space X.\n*   $\\Sigma X$ is the reduced suspension of a space X.\n*   $X \\wedge Y$ is the smash product of two based spaces X and Y.\n*   The connectivity of a map $f: A \\to B$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced maps on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, are isomorphisms for $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(k-1)$-connected. A homotopy equivalence is k-connected for all k, so its connectivity is infinite.\n\nThe phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" suggests that this map arises naturally from standard constructions in homotopy theory, specifically those involving fiber sequences. We will analyze the canonical map between these two spaces.\n\n### Step 2: The key ingredients - Cofiber sequences and the Hilton-Milnor Theorem\nThe analysis of this map relies on two fundamental tools in algebraic topology:\n1.  **The Puppe sequence:** A cofiber sequence $A \\xrightarrow{i} B \\xrightarrow{q} C$ gives rise to a fibration sequence upon applying the loop space functor: $\\Omega A \\xrightarrow{\\Omega i} \\Omega B \\xrightarrow{\\Omega q} \\Omega C$.\n2.  **The Hilton-Milnor Theorem:** For two well-pointed connected CW-complexes X and Y, there is a homotopy equivalence between $\\Omega(X \\vee Y)$ and the free product of $\\Omega X$ and $\\Omega Y$. A more specific version states that if X and Y are suspensions, there is a homotopy equivalence:\n    $\\Omega(X \\vee Y) \\simeq \\Omega X \\times \\Omega Y \\times \\Omega(\\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y))$\n\n### Step 3: Applying the tools to the specific spaces\nLet's apply these tools to our case, with $X=S^4$ and $Y=S^6$.\n1.  **Cofiber Sequence:** Consider the standard cofiber sequence relating the wedge sum, product, and smash product:\n    $S^4 \\vee S^6 \\xrightarrow{i} S^4 \\times S^6 \\xrightarrow{q} S^4 \\wedge S^6$\n    Here, $i$ is the inclusion of the wedge into the product, and $q$ is the quotient map collapsing the wedge to a point.\n\n2.  **Fibration Sequence:** Applying the loop space functor $\\Omega$ to this cofiber sequence yields a homotopy fibration sequence:\n    $\\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6) \\xrightarrow{\\Omega i} \\Omega(S^4 \\times S^6) \\xrightarrow{\\Omega q} \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$\n\n3.  **Hilton-Milnor Theorem:** The spheres $S^4$ and $S^6$ are suspensions, since $S^4 = \\Sigma S^3$ and $S^6 = \\Sigma S^5$. This is a crucial observation. Because they are suspensions, the Hilton-Milnor theorem gives a homotopy equivalence:\n    $\\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^4 \\times \\Omega S^6 \\times \\Omega(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6))$\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the fibration sequence\nLet's analyze the map $\\Omega i: \\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\times S^6)$. We can use the fact that $\\Omega(S^4 \\times S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^4 \\times \\Omega S^6$. The map $\\Omega i$ corresponds to the map induced by the projections of $S^4 \\times S^6$ onto its factors, composed with the inclusion $i$.\n*   $S^4 \\vee S^6 \\xrightarrow{i} S^4 \\times S^6 \\xrightarrow{\\text{proj}_1} S^4$ is the map that is the identity on $S^4$ and the constant map on $S^6$.\n*   $S^4 \\vee S^6 \\xrightarrow{i} S^4 \\times S^6 \\xrightarrow{\\text{proj}_2} S^6$ is the map that is the identity on $S^6$ and the constant map on $S^4$.\n\nThese maps induce a map $\\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6) \\to \\Omega S^4 \\times \\Omega S^6$ which is a standard retraction. The map $\\Omega i$ is precisely this retraction.\nIn the context of the Hilton-Milnor decomposition, the map $\\Omega i$ corresponds to the projection from the product $\\Omega S^4 \\times \\Omega S^6 \\times \\Omega(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6))$ onto the first two factors.\n\nThis means that the map $(\\Omega i)_*: \\pi_k(\\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6)) \\to \\pi_k(\\Omega(S^4 \\times S^6))$ is a split surjection for all $k$.\n\n### Step 5: The long exact sequence of homotopy groups\nFor the fibration sequence, the long exact sequence of homotopy groups is:\n$\\dots \\to \\pi_k(\\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6)) \\xrightarrow{(\\Omega i)_*} \\pi_k(\\Omega(S^4 \\times S^6)) \\xrightarrow{(\\Omega q)_*} \\pi_k(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_{k-1}(\\Omega(S^4 \\vee S^6)) \\to \\dots$\n\nSince $(\\Omega i)_*$ is surjective, the map $(\\Omega q)_*$ must be the zero map. The long exact sequence breaks into short exact sequences:\n$0 \\to \\text{coker}((\\Omega i)_*) \\to \\pi_k(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)) \\to \\ker((\\Omega i)_{*-1}) \\to 0$\n\nAs $(\\Omega i)_*$ is surjective, its cokernel is trivial. Thus, we have an isomorphism:\n$\\pi_k(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)) \\cong \\ker((\\Omega i)_{k-1})$\n\nThe kernel of the retraction $(\\Omega i)_{k-1}$ is precisely the homotopy groups of its fiber. The fiber of the map $\\Omega i$ is $\\Omega(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6))$.\nSo, we have an isomorphism for all $k$:\n$\\pi_k(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)) \\cong \\pi_{k-1}(\\Omega(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)))$\n\nUsing the adjoint isomorphisms $\\pi_j(\\Omega Z) \\cong \\pi_{j+1}(Z)$ and $\\pi_j(\\Sigma Z) \\cong \\pi_{j-1}(Z)$ (in the stable range, but the argument holds for the weak equivalence), we get:\n$\\pi_{k+1}(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\cong \\pi_k(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6))$\n\nThis shows that there is a map $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ which induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups. The canonical map in the question is precisely a map that realizes this isomorphism. Such a map is a weak homotopy equivalence.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nSince both the source space $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target space $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ are CW-complexes, by Whitehead's theorem, a weak homotopy equivalence between them is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nA homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups. Therefore, the map $f$ is k-connected for all integers $k$. The connectivity of such a map is said to be infinite. This result, due to Brayton Gray, holds whenever the spaces $S^4$ and $S^6$ are replaced by any two suspensions."
