    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Curve and the Field:**\n    We are given the curve $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\n    We need to find the number of double points (nodes) of its stable reduction over the field of 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. This means we analyze the curve's geometry modulo powers of 2.\n\n2.  **Find a Better Model:**\n    The given equation has coefficients with various powers of 2. To understand the reduction, we need to find a \"better\" integral model. This is often done by a change of variables. Let's try a transformation of the form $x=2^a X, y=2^b Y$.\n    Let's try $x = X/2$ and $y = Y/2$. This corresponds to $a=-1, b=-1$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $(Y/2)^2 = 8(X/2)^5 + 4(X/2)^4 + 4(X/2)^3 + (X/2)^2 + 8(X/2)$\n    $Y^2/4 = 8X^5/32 + 4X^4/16 + 4X^3/8 + X^2/4 + 4X$\n    $Y^2/4 = X^5/4 + X^4/4 + X^3/2 + X^2/4 + 4X$\n    Multiplying the entire equation by 4, we get an equation with integer coefficients:\n    $C': Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$\n    This is an integral model of the original curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Special Fiber:**\n    The special fiber is the reduction of the model $C'$ modulo 2. We set coefficients that are multiples of 2 to 0.\n    The equation for the special fiber $\\bar{C'}$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is:\n    $Y^2 \\equiv X^5 + X^4 + X^2 \\pmod{2}$\n    $Y^2 \\equiv X^2(X^3 + X^2 + 1)$\n    The polynomial $P(X) = X^3+X^2+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ since $P(0)=1$ and $P(1)=1$.\n    The curve $\\bar{C'}$ has a singularity. To find it, we compute the partial derivatives:\n    Let $F(X,Y) = Y^2 - X^2(X^3+X^2+1) = 0$.\n    $\\partial F/\\partial Y = 2Y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n    $\\partial F/\\partial X = - (2X(X^3+X^2+1) + X^2(3X^2+2X)) \\equiv -X^2(X^2) = -X^4 \\pmod{2}$.\n    Both partial derivatives are zero when $X=0$. If $X=0$, then $Y^2=0$, so $Y=0$. The only singular point is $(0,0)$.\n    The lowest degree terms of the equation at $(0,0)$ are $Y^2 - X^2 = 0$, which is $(Y-X)(Y+X)=0$. Over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, this becomes $(Y-X)^2=0$. This indicates the singularity is a cusp. A curve with a cusp is not stable. The stable reduction theorem says that a stable model exists, so we must resolve this singularity.\n\n4.  **Resolve the Singularity via Blow-up:**\n    The process of finding the stable reduction involves resolving the singularities of the model over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The standard method is to perform a sequence of blow-ups. We blow up the singular point of the special fiber, which is $(X,Y)=(0,0)$.\n    We consider the blow-up of the affine plane $\\mathbb{A}^2_{\\mathbb{Z}_2}$ at the origin. It is covered by two affine charts.\n\n    *   **Chart 1:** Let $X=X_1$ and $Y=X_1 Y_1$. We substitute this into the integral equation of $C'$:\n        $(X_1 Y_1)^2 = X_1^5 + X_1^4 + 2X_1^3 + X_1^2 + 16X_1$\n        The equation of the total transform is:\n        $X_1^2 Y_1^2 - X_1^5 - X_1^4 - 2X_1^3 - X_1^2 - 16X_1 = 0$\n        The special fiber of this new model is obtained by reducing modulo 2:\n        $X_1^2 Y_1^2 - X_1^5 - X_1^4 - X_1^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n        $X_1^2 (Y_1^2 - X_1^3 - X_1^2 - 1) = 0$\n        This special fiber consists of two components:\n        a) The exceptional divisor $E$, with equation $X_1=0$.\n        b) The strict transform of the curve $C'$, with equation $Y_1^2 = X_1^3 + X_1^2 + 1$.\n        The intersection of these two components occurs where $X_1=0$ and $Y_1^2 = 0+0+1=1$, which gives $Y_1=1$. So they intersect at the point $(X_1, Y_1)=(0,1)$. This intersection is transverse, creating a node.\n\n    *   **Chart 2:** Let $X=X_2 Y_2$ and $Y=Y_2$. Substitute this into the integral equation of $C'$:\n        $Y_2^2 = (X_2Y_2)^5 + (X_2Y_2)^4 + 2(X_2Y_2)^3 + (X_2Y_2)^2 + 16(X_2Y_2)$\n        The equation of the total transform is:\n        $Y_2^2 - Y_2^5 X_2^5 - Y_2^4 X_2^4 - 2Y_2^3 X_2^3 - Y_2^2 X_2^2 - 16X_2 Y_2 = 0$\n        The special fiber (reduction mod 2) is:\n        $Y_2^2 - Y_2^5 X_2^5 - Y_2^4 X_2^4 - Y_2^2 X_2^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n        $Y_2^2 (1 - Y_2^3 X_2^5 - Y_2^2 X_2^4 - X_2^2) = 0$\n        This special fiber also has two components:\n        a) The exceptional divisor $E$, with equation $Y_2=0$.\n        b) The strict transform of the curve $C'$, with equation $1 - Y_2^3 X_2^5 - Y_2^2 X_2^4 - X_2^2 = 0$.\n        The intersection occurs where $Y_2=0$ and $1-X_2^2 = 0$, which gives $X_2=1$. So they intersect at the point $(X_2, Y_2)=(1,0)$. This intersection is also transverse, creating another node.\n\n5.  **Describe the Stable Reduction and Count the Nodes:**\n    After one blow-up, the singularity is resolved. The new special fiber is the stable reduction of the curve. It consists of:\n    *   A component $E$, which is the exceptional divisor. It is a projective line ($\\mathbb{P}^1$), which has genus 0.\n    *   A component which is the strict transform of $C'$. Its equation in Chart 1 is $Y_1^2 = X_1^3 + X_1^2 + 1$. This is the equation of a smooth elliptic curve (genus 1).\n    These two components intersect at two distinct points. Each intersection point is an ordinary double point (a node) on the stable reduction. The resulting curve is stable because its components are smooth and they intersect transversally.\n    The arithmetic genus of the stable reduction is $g_{stable} = g(E) + g(C') + (\\text{number of intersections}) - 1 = 0 + 1 + 2 - 1 = 2$. This matches the genus of the original curve (since $y^2=f(x)$ with $\\deg(f)=5$, the genus is $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$).\n    The number of double points in the stable reduction is the number of intersection points between its components plus the number of self-intersections of each component. Here, the components are smooth, so the nodes are only the intersection points.\n\n    Therefore, the stable reduction has exactly 2 double points."
