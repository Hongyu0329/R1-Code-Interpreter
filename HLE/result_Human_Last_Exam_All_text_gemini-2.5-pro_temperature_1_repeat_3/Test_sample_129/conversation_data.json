    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n### Symbols and Rules\n*   **Symbols:** T, F, !, &, |, (, )\n*   **Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Operators:** ! (NOT), & (AND), | (OR).\n*   **Operands:** T (True), F (False), or any valid sub-expression.\n*   **Precedence:** ! > & > |\n*   **Associativity:** & and | are left-associative.\n\n### Strategy\nWe will use a method based on dynamic programming or recursion, building up expressions of increasing length. We will count the number of true and false expressions for each length.\n\nLet `True(n)` be the number of true expressions of length `n`.\nLet `False(n)` be the number of false expressions of length `n`.\nLet `Any(n) = True(n) + False(n)`.\n\n### Step 1: Expressions of Length 1\n*   `T`: True (1)\n*   `F`: False (1)\n*   **`True(1) = 1`**, **`False(1) = 1`**, **`Any(1) = 2`**\n\n### Step 2: Expressions of Length 2\nThe only possible structure is `!E₁`, where `E₁` is an expression of length 1.\n*   `!T`: False (1)\n*   `!F`: True (1)\n*   **`True(2) = 1`**, **`False(2) = 1`**, **`Any(2) = 2`**\n    *   True expression: `!F`\n\n### Step 3: Expressions of Length 3\nExpressions of length 3 can be formed in these ways:\n1.  `(E₁)`: Parenthesizing an expression of length 1.\n    *   `(T)`: True (1)\n    *   `(F)`: False (1)\n2.  `!E₂`: Applying NOT to an expression of length 2.\n    *   `!(!T)` which is `!!T`: True (1)\n    *   `!(!F)` which is `!!F`: False (1)\n3.  `E₁ op E₁`: A binary operation on two expressions of length 1.\n    *   `&`: `T&T` (True), `T&F` (False), `F&T` (False), `F&F` (False). (1 True, 3 False)\n    *   `|`: `T|T` (True), `T|F` (True), `F|T` (True), `F|F` (False). (3 True, 1 False)\n*   **Total True(3):** 1 `(T)` + 1 `!!T` + 1 `T&T` + 3 `L|L'` = 6\n*   **Total False(3):** 1 `(F)` + 1 `!!F` + 3 `L&L'` + 1 `F|F` = 6\n*   **`Any(3) = 12`**\n\n### Step 4: Expressions of Length 4\nExpressions of length 4 can be formed in these ways:\n1.  `(E₂)`: `(!T)` (False), `(!F)` (True). (1 True, 1 False)\n2.  `!E₃`: `!E₃_true` gives False, `!E₃_false` gives True. (6 True, 6 False)\n3.  `E₁ op E₂`: `L op !L'`.\n    *   `&`: `T&!F` is True. `T&!T`, `F&!T`, `F&!F` are False. (1 True, 3 False)\n    *   `|`: `T|!T`, `T|!F`, `F|!F` are True. `F|!T` is False. (3 True, 1 False)\n4.  `E₂ op E₁`: `!L' op L`. By symmetry. (1 True, 3 False for `&`), (3 True, 1 False for `|`).\n5.  `!!E₁`: No, `!!(E₁)` is `!!(L)`.\n    *   `!!(T)`: True (1)\n    *   `!!(F)`: False (1)\n*   **Total True(4):** 1 `(!F)` + 6 `!E₃_false` + (1+3) `L op !L'` + (1+3) `!L' op L` + 1 `!!(T)` = 1 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 16\n*   **Total False(4):** 1 `(!T)` + 6 `!E₃_true` + (3+1) `L op !L'` + (3+1) `!L' op L` + 1 `!!(F)` = 1 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 16\n*   **`Any(4) = 32`**\n\n### Step 5: Expressions of Length 5 (The Final Goal)\nWe want to find `True(5)`. Expressions of length 5 can be formed by combining smaller expressions. The structure is determined by the top-level operation in the expression's abstract syntax tree.\n\n1.  **Form `(E₄)`**: `E₄` is an expression of length 4. The result is true if `E₄` is true.\n    *   Number of true expressions = `True(4)` = 16.\n\n2.  **Form `!E₄`**: `E₄` is an expression of length 4. The result is true if `E₄` is false.\n    *   Number of true expressions = `False(4)` = 16.\n\n3.  **Form `E₁ op E₃`**: `L op E₃`. Binary operation on expressions of length 1 and 3.\n    *   `&`: `L & E₃`. True only if `L=T` and `E₃` is true. `T & E₃_true`.\n        *   `True(3)` = 6. So there are 6 such expressions.\n    *   `|`: `L | E₃`. True if `L=T` or `E₃` is true.\n        *   `L=T`: `T | E₃_any`. `Any(3)` = 12 ways.\n        *   `L=F`: `F | E₃_true`. `True(3)` = 6 ways.\n        *   Total for `|` is 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Total for `E₁ op E₃`: 6 + 18 = 24.\n\n4.  **Form `E₃ op E₁`**: `E₃ op L`. By symmetry with the previous case.\n    *   Total for `E₃ op E₁`: 6 (`&`) + 18 (`|`) = 24.\n\n5.  **Form `E₂ op E₂`**: `!L op !L'`. Binary operation on two expressions of length 2.\n    *   `&`: `!L & !L'`. True only if both operands are true. `!F & !F`.\n        *   1 way.\n    *   `|`: `!L | !L'`. True if at least one operand is true.\n        *   The only false case is `!T | !T`.\n        *   Total `!L | !L'` combinations: 4 (`!T|!T, !T|!F, !F|!T, !F|!F`).\n        *   3 are true.\n    *   Total for `E₂ op E₂`: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n**Careful Point:** The above decomposition is based on the structure of the expression tree. Since a given expression string has a unique structure based on operator precedence and parentheses, these categories are disjoint and do not double-count any expression. For example, `T&T&T` parses as `(T&T)&T`, which falls into the `E₃ op E₁` category, not `E₁ op E₃`. `T&(T&T)` falls into `E₁ op E₃`.\n\n### Final Calculation\nThe total number of true expressions of length 5 is the sum of the counts from each formation rule.\n\n*   From `(E₄)`: 16\n*   From `!E₄`: 16\n*   From `E₁ & E₃`: 6\n*   From `E₃ & E₁`: 6\n*   From `E₁ | E₃`: 18\n*   From `E₃ | E₁`: 18\n*   From `E₂ & E₂`: 1\n*   From `E₂ | E₂`: 3\n\nTotal = 16 + 16 + 6 + 6 + 18 + 18 + 1 + 3 = 84.\n\n<<<84>>>"
