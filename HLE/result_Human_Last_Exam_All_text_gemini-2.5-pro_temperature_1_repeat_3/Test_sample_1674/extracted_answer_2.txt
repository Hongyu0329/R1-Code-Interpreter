Yes, the theory can fail. The introduction of a birefringent medium makes the system's behavior dependent on polarization. The original input beam with a single polarization (e.g., horizontal) will be transformed into an output beam with a complex, spatially varying polarization state (i.e., with both horizontal and vertical components). The original theory relies on an inversion process using the transmission matrix (`T`) of the non-polarizing system. This scalar inversion process is unaware of and cannot correct for the polarization scrambling introduced by the birefringent element. Because the inverse operator no longer matches the true physical system, the calculated `Output 2` will not be the correct input to generate `Output 1`, and the theory will no longer hold.
