    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe key parameters for the search are:\n*   **Ship Nationality:** French\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** By a German U-boat\n*   **Time Period:** From the start of World War II (September 1, 1939) until the French armistice (signed June 22, 1940).\n*   **Size Criterion:** Largest by displacement (the weight of the ship in tons).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze French Naval Losses\nFirst, we examine major French warships (cuirassés, croiseurs, etc.) sunk during this period.\n*   **Battleships and Cruisers:** No French battleships or cruisers were sunk by U-boats during this timeframe. Major losses like the battleship *Bretagne* occurred at Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940 and were caused by the British Royal Navy.\n*   **Destroyers and Submarines:** A few smaller warships were lost. For instance, the submarine *Doris* (displacement of approx. 660 tons surfaced) was sunk by U-9 on May 9, 1940. This displacement is far too small to be a contender against large merchant ships.\n*   **Conclusion for Naval Ships:** The largest naval vessels lost were not large enough to be the answer. We must look at merchant or auxiliary vessels.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze French Merchant & Auxiliary Ship Losses\nThe largest ships are typically passenger liners or large tankers. We need to find French ships of this type sunk by U-boats in the specified window. This includes ships sunk by torpedoes as well as mines laid by U-boats, as the U-boat is the direct agent of the sinking.\n\n### Step 4: Identify and Compare the Largest Candidates\nSeveral large French merchant ships were sunk in this period. The two main candidates for the \"largest\" are:\n\n*   **Candidate A: The tanker *Emile Miguet***\n    *   **Sinking:** Torpedoed and sunk on October 12, 1939, by the German U-boat U-48.\n    *   **Size:** This was a very large oil tanker. Its size is often listed as 14,115 Gross Register Tonnage (GRT). For a tanker, its full load displacement (actual weight) is significantly higher. Its deadweight tonnage was over 20,000 tons, putting its fully loaded displacement at approximately **27,000 tons**.\n\n*   **Candidate B: The passenger liner *Champlain***\n    *   **Sinking:** Struck a magnetic mine on June 17, 1940, off La Rochelle. The mine had been laid by the German U-boat U-65. The ship was severely damaged and sank over the next few days.\n    *   **Size:** The *Champlain* was one of the largest and most modern French liners of its time. Its size was 28,124 GRT. Its standard displacement is recorded as **28,500 tons**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Comparison and Conclusion\nWe now compare the two leading candidates based on displacement, which the question specifically requests.\n\n*   *Emile Miguet* (tanker): approx. 27,000 tons displacement.\n*   *Champlain* (liner): approx. 28,500 tons displacement.\n\nThe displacement of the passenger liner *Champlain* was greater than that of the tanker *Emile Miguet*. Both sinkings occurred within the correct timeframe (before the June 22, 1940 armistice) and were the result of actions by a German U-boat (one by torpedo, one by a U-boat-laid mine).\n\nTherefore, the *Champlain* was the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n<<<Champlain>>>"
