    "Answering the question: What is the largest number $c$ such that there exists $A\\subseteq \\{1,…,N\\}$ and $|A|= (c+o(1))N $, $A+A$ contains no square numbers?\n\nLet $S$ be the set of perfect squares. We are looking for the maximum density $c$ of a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ such that its sumset $A+A = \\{a_1+a_2 : a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ has no elements in common with $S$, i.e., $(A+A) \\cap S = \\emptyset$.\n\n**Step 1: Find a lower bound for c.**\nWe can construct such a set $A$ using modular arithmetic. The idea is to find a modulus $q$ and a set of residues $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, q-1\\}$ such that the sumset $R+R = \\{r_1+r_2 \\pmod q : r_1, r_2 \\in R\\}$ contains no quadratic residues modulo $q$. If we can do this, then the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} : n \\pmod q \\in R\\}$ will have a sumset $A+A$ where every element $s \\in A+A$ satisfies $s \\pmod q \\in R+R$. If $R+R$ contains no quadratic residues, then no element in $A+A$ can be a perfect square.\n\nLet's test this with a small modulus, $q=3$.\nThe integers modulo 3 are $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\nThe squares modulo 3 are $S_3 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2\\} \\pmod 3 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe non-quadratic residue is $\\{2\\}$.\n\nWe want to find a residue class (or a set of classes) $R$ such that $R+R$ consists only of non-quadratic residues. In this case, we need $R+R \\subseteq \\{2\\}$.\nLet's try to construct such a set $R$.\n- If we choose $R = \\{0\\}$, then $R+R = \\{0+0\\} = \\{0\\}$, which is in $S_3$. This fails.\n- If we choose $R = \\{1\\}$, then $R+R = \\{1+1\\} = \\{2\\}$. Since $2 \\notin S_3$, this works.\n- If we choose $R = \\{2\\}$, then $R+R = \\{2+2\\} = \\{4\\} \\equiv \\{1\\}$, which is in $S_3$. This fails.\n- If $R$ has more than one element, it's easy to check it will fail. For example, if $R=\\{0,1\\}$, $0+0=0 \\in S_3$.\n\nSo, we can choose $R=\\{1\\}$. Let's define the set $A$ based on this residue class:\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\nFor any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nTheir sum is $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\nHowever, any perfect square $k^2$ is congruent to either $0$ or $1$ modulo 3:\n- If $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, $k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\n- If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, $k^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n- If $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, $k^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nSince no square can be congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$, the sumset $A+A$ contains no squares.\n\nThe size of this set $A$ is $|A| = \\lfloor\\frac{N-1}{3}\\rfloor + 1 \\approx N/3$.\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, the density of $A$ is $\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N} = 1/3$.\nThis construction shows that such a set exists for $c=1/3$. Therefore, the largest possible value for $c$ must be at least $1/3$. So, $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n**Step 2: Find an upper bound for c.**\nWe want to show that if $|A| > (1/3)N$, then $A+A$ must contain a square. This will prove that $c \\le 1/3$.\n\nLet $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ be a set such that $A+A$ contains no squares.\nLet's partition $A$ into three subsets based on their residues modulo 3:\n- $A_0 = \\{a \\in A : a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\\}$\n- $A_1 = \\{a \\in A : a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$\n- $A_2 = \\{a \\in A : a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$\nWe have $A = A_0 \\cup A_1 \\cup A_2$.\n\nLet's examine the sums of pairs of elements from these subsets modulo 3:\n- $A_1+A_1$: sums are $\\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 3$. These can never be squares. This is a \"safe\" sumset.\n- $A_0+A_2$: sums are $\\equiv 0+2=2 \\pmod 3$. These can never be squares. This is also a \"safe\" sumset.\n\nAll other sumsets are \"risky\", meaning their sums can be congruent to a square modulo 3:\n- $A_0+A_0$: sums $\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\n- $A_2+A_2$: sums $\\equiv 2+2=4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n- $A_0+A_1$: sums $\\equiv 0+1=1 \\pmod 3$.\n- $A_1+A_2$: sums $\\equiv 1+2=3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\n\nFor $A+A$ to contain no squares, each of these risky sumsets must not contain any squares. This imposes strong constraints on the sizes of $A_0$, $A_1$, and $A_2$.\n\nA key principle from additive combinatorics (based on work by Sárközy, Furstenberg, Ruzsa, and others) is that the sumset of two relatively dense sets of integers cannot avoid a \"structured\" sparse set, like the set of squares. More formally, if $X, Y \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, M\\}$ are such that $|X||Y|$ is large enough (e.g., significantly larger than $M^{3/2}$), then $X+Y$ is very likely to contain a square. A more qualitative version states that if $X$ and $Y$ have positive density, their sumset $X+Y$ must contain elements from any set that is not \"too sparse\" and has some arithmetic structure.\n\nLet's apply this principle to our \"risky\" sumsets:\n1.  **Constraint on $A_0$**: Consider $A_0+A_0$. Let $A'_0 = \\{a/3 : a \\in A_0\\}$. For $A_0+A_0$ to contain no square, $3(a'_1+a'_2)$ is never a square for $a'_1, a'_2 \\in A'_0$. This implies $a'_1+a'_2$ is never of the form $3m^2$. The set $\\{3m^2 : m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ is a sparse set. For the sumset $A'_0+A'_0$ to avoid this set, the set $A'_0$ must be very small. This implies $|A_0| = o(N)$.\n2.  **Constraint on $A_2$**: Consider $A_2+A_2$. Let $a_1, a_2 \\in A_2$. $a_1=3k_1+2, a_2=3k_2+2$. The sum is $3(k_1+k_2)+4$. For this to not be a square, $k_1+k_2$ must avoid the sparse set $\\{(m^2-4)/3 : m^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. This implies that $|A_2|=o(N)$.\n3.  **Constraint on $A_1, A_2$**: Consider $A_1+A_2$. The sum of elements must not be in the set of squares divisible by 3, which are of the form $9m^2$. This implies that $|A_1|=o(N)$ or $|A_2|=o(N)$.\n4.  **Constraint on $A_0, A_1$**: Consider $A_0+A_1$. The sum of elements must not be in the set of squares not divisible by 3. This implies that $|A_0|=o(N)$ or $|A_1|=o(N)$.\n\nCombining these constraints:\n- From (1) and (2), we must have $|A_0|=o(N)$ and $|A_2|=o(N)$.\n- The constraints from (3) and (4) are then automatically satisfied as $|A_0|$ and $|A_2|$ are small.\n\nSo, for $A+A$ to contain no squares, the components of $A$ in residue classes 0 and 2 modulo 3 must be negligible in size compared to $N$. The set $A$ must be composed almost entirely of elements from the residue class 1 modulo 3.\n$|A| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2| = o(N) + |A_1| + o(N) = |A_1| + o(N)$.\n\nThe set $A_1$ is a subset of all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that are congruent to 1 modulo 3. The total number of such integers is $\\approx N/3$.\nSo, $|A_1| \\le N/3 + O(1)$.\nTherefore, $|A| \\le N/3 + o(N)$.\n\nThis implies that the density $c = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N}$ must satisfy $c \\le 1/3$.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion.**\nFrom Step 1, we have $c \\ge 1/3$.\nFrom Step 2, we have $c \\le 1/3$.\nCombining these two bounds, we find that the largest possible value for $c$ is exactly $1/3$."
