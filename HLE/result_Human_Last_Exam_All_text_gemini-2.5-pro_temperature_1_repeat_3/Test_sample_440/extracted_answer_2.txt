The density profile `\(\rho(z)\)` is given by the expression `\(\rho(z) = M_A c_A(z) + M_B c_B(z)\)`. The concentration profiles `\(c_A(z)\)` and `\(c_B(z)\)` are the unique solutions to the system of equations defined by the principle of constant total chemical potential for each gas species in the van der Waals mixture, `\(\mu_i(T, c_A(z), c_B(z)) + M_i g z = \text{constant}\)`, subject to the integral constraints that the total number of particles of each species matches the given `\(N_A\)` and `\(N_B\)`. An explicit analytical formula for `\(\rho(z)\)` is not obtainable; it is defined as the numerical solution to this boundary value problem.
