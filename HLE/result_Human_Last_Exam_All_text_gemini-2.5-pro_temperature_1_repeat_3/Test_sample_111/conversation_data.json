    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nThe first crucial piece of information is to establish when the event in question occurred. Historical records confirm that Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died in September 1368. The cause of death is widely believed to have been the plague.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the location of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nBlanche died at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, which is in England. This establishes that the event itself took place within England.\n\n**Step 3: Determine Geoffrey Chaucer's known occupation and general location around 1368.**\nTo find out where Chaucer was, we need to look at his biographical records for that period.\n*   By 1367, Chaucer is documented as being a member of the royal household of King Edward III, serving as a valet (or *valettus*) and later an esquire (*armiger*).\n*   This was a courtly position that required his presence in England, attending to the king and the court.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Chaucer's travel history.**\nA careful point is to consider if Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission or traveling abroad for other reasons in 1368.\n*   Chaucer's famous and well-documented diplomatic missions to the continent began a few years later. His first known mission to Italy (Genoa and Florence) was in 1372-1373. Other missions to France and Flanders also took place in the 1370s.\n*   There are no records suggesting that Chaucer was outside of England in 1368. His duties as a member of the royal household would have kept him in England.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the information and draw a conclusion.**\n*   Blanche of Lancaster died in England in 1368.\n*   Geoffrey Chaucer was employed in the English royal court, based in England, in 1368.\n*   His significant travels abroad are documented as occurring after 1368.\n*   Therefore, all available evidence strongly indicates that Geoffrey Chaucer was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died. His famous poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, written as an elegy for her, further solidifies his close connection to the English court and its affairs at this time.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n*   A. Italy: Incorrect. Chaucer's trips to Italy were in the 1370s.\n*   B. France: Incorrect. While he had been to France for war earlier, there's no record of him being there in 1368.\n*   C. England: Correct. This aligns with his known employment and location during that year.\n*   D. Unknown: While his exact city on that specific day isn't recorded, his country of residence and employment is known with high certainty, making \"England\" a much better answer than \"Unknown.\"\n*   E. Scotland: Incorrect. There is no evidence placing him in Scotland at this time.\n\nThe final conclusion based on the analysis is that Geoffrey Chaucer was in England.\n\n<<<C>>>"
