The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance when probed is because of its built-in **active detuning circuit**. This safety feature uses PIN diodes to intentionally detune the coil when it is not actively being controlled by the MRI scanner. In its default, unpowered state on the test bench, the coil is in a "fail-safe," non-resonant mode to protect it (and the patient) from high-power RF pulses. Therefore, the VNA is measuring a circuit that is designed to not be resonant. Secondary factors include poor magnetic coupling due to probe placement relative to complex coil geometry, or the detuning effect of an unpowered integrated preamplifier.
