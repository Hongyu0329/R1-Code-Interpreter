    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The question asks for the name of a physicist.\n2.  **Identify the primary field:** The physicist is \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\" This narrows the search to scientists who made significant contributions to microscopes.\n3.  **Identify the discovery:** The physicist \"discovered an optical effect in real imagery.\" This means the discovery was a phenomenon related to how light forms images.\n4.  **Identify the key anecdote:** The discovery was prompted by an accidental observation made by a \"custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\" This is a very specific historical detail.\n\n### Careful points to consider\n*   The person must be a physicist, and their fame must be linked specifically to microscopy.\n*   The discovery is an \"optical effect,\" not necessarily a device itself, although it likely led to the development of a new device or technique.\n*   The anecdote involving the custodial worker and concave mirrors is the most crucial clue for identifying the correct person and event.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis to acquire the final answer\n1.  **Brainstorming Physicists in Microscopy:** We can list several physicists known for their work in optics and microscopy, such as Ernst Abbe (diffraction limit), August Köhler (Köhler illumination), and Frits Zernike (phase-contrast microscopy).\n\n2.  **Focusing on the Anecdote:** The story of a discovery being sparked by a janitor or custodial worker is quite unique. We search for this story in the history of science, specifically related to optics and mirrors.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Anecdote to a Physicist:** This specific story is famously associated with the Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**. While working on diffraction gratings using a concave mirror, Zernike was puzzled about how to make transparent, phase-altering objects visible. The legend states that a janitor, while cleaning the mirror, breathed on it. The thin film of condensation acted as a crude phase plate, momentarily making the invisible lines of the diffraction grating visible in the primary image.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Details:**\n    *   **Physicist:** Frits Zernike was a Dutch physicist.\n    *   **Microscopy:** He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope, a revolutionary tool for viewing unstained, transparent biological specimens. He is definitely \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\"\n    *   **Optical Effect:** The effect is phase contrast, which translates invisible phase shifts of light (caused by passing through a transparent object) into visible changes in brightness (amplitude) in the image. This is an \"optical effect in real imagery.\"\n    *   **Anecdote Match:** The story of the janitor's accidental observation with the concave mirror directly corresponds to the breakthrough that led Zernike to develop the phase plate, the key component of his new microscope.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** All the clues in the question point directly to Frits Zernike.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
