To relieve the second patch (amino acids 47-50) of its native function and negatively charged environment, the best replacement for all four amino acids—Serine (S), Glutamate (E), Glutamate (E), and Aspartate (D)—would be Alanine (A). This creates a quadruple mutant (S47A, E48A, E49A, D50A). Alanine is ideal because it is small, sterically non-disruptive, and electrically neutral. Replacing Serine with Alanine prevents phosphorylation (eliminating the potential negative charge at position 47), and replacing the acidic residues Glutamate and Aspartate with Alanine removes their inherent negative charges. This approach directly tests the hypothesis that the negative charge of this patch is inhibitory, with minimal risk of introducing other confounding structural changes.
