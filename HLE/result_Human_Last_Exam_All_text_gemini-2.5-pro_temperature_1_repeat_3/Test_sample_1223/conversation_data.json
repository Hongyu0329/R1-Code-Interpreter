    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and $x$ is a point in $X$.\n\nLet's define the key terms:\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is a prime example.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification $\\beta Y$:** For a locally compact Hausdorff space $Y$, $\\beta Y$ is the unique (up to homeomorphism) compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace, with the universal property that any continuous map from $Y$ to a compact Hausdorff space extends uniquely to a continuous map from $\\beta Y$.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** The set of points added to $Y$ to form its Stone-Cech compactification, i.e., $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n\nLet $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a compact metric space, $Y$ is a locally compact, non-compact (assuming $X$ is not a single point), separable metric space. Let $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$ be the Stone-Cech remainder.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of the remainder $R$\nThe question asks for the \"number of composants of $R$\". The concept of a composant is defined for indecomposable continua. This strongly suggests that for the question to be well-posed, the remainder $R$ must be an indecomposable continuum.\n\n1.  **Is $R$ a continuum (i.e., compact and connected)?**\n    *   $R$ is a closed subset of the compact space $\\beta Y$, so $R$ is compact.\n    *   For a locally compact, connected space like $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, its Stone-Cech remainder $R$ is connected if and only if $Y$ has exactly one *end*.\n    *   Therefore, for $R$ to be a continuum, we must consider pairs $(X, x)$ such that $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ has exactly one end.\n\n2.  **Does such a pair $(X, x)$ exist?**\n    *   Yes. A key example is the pseudo-arc, $P$. The pseudo-arc is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum. It is known that for any point $p \\in P$, the space $P \\setminus \\{p\\}$ has exactly one end.\n\n3.  **If $R$ is connected, is it indecomposable?**\n    *   A theorem by D. P. Bellamy states that if $K$ is an indecomposable continuum and $p \\in K$, then the remainder $\\beta(K \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (K \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Since our $X$ is hereditary indecomposable, it is indecomposable. So, if the remainder $R$ is connected (i.e., $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ has one end), then $R$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n4.  **Is $R$ a metric space?**\n    *   A compact Hausdorff space is metrizable if and only if it has a countable base.\n    *   The remainder $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$ is metrizable if $Y$ is a locally compact, separable metric space and has a countable basis of neighborhoods for its \"point at infinity\".\n    *   Here, $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. $Y$ is separable metric because $X$ is. The \"point at infinity\" for $Y$ corresponds to the point $x$ in $X$. Since $X$ is a metric space, the point $x$ has a countable neighborhood basis (e.g., the open balls $B(x, 1/n)$). This implies the remainder $R$ is metrizable.\n\n5.  **Is $R$ non-degenerate (i.e., not a single point)?**\n    *   Another theorem by Bellamy states that if a continuum $K$ is not locally connected at a point $p$, then the remainder $\\beta(K \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (K \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is non-degenerate.\n    *   A hereditary indecomposable continuum is not locally connected at any of its points. Thus, for any $x \\in X$, $X$ is not locally connected at $x$.\n    *   Therefore, the remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate continuum.\n\nCombining these points, if we restrict ourselves to cases where the question is well-defined (i.e., the remainder is indecomposable), the remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the number of composants\nA fundamental theorem in continuum theory, due to Stefan Mazurkiewicz, states that any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, or $2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants.\n\nSince we've established that the remainder $R$ (in the well-posed cases) is a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum, it must have $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants.\n\n### Step 4: Consider all possible cases and find the maximum\nThe above analysis holds for any non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$ and point $x$ where $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ has one end.\n\nWhat if we don't make this restriction?\n*   **Case A: The continuum $X$ is degenerate.** Let $X=\\{p\\}$. A single-point space is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum. In this case, $x=p$, and $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is the empty set. The Stone-Cech compactification of the empty set is itself empty. The remainder is also empty. An empty set has 0 composants.\n*   **Case B: $X$ is non-degenerate and $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ has one end.** As shown above, the remainder is a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum, and the number of its composants is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   **Case C: $X$ is non-degenerate and $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ has more than one end.** It is known that such continua exist. For any integer $n \\ge 2$, or for $n=\\aleph_0$ or $n=\\mathfrak{c}$, there exists a hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$ such that $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ has $n$ ends. In this situation, the remainder $R$ has $n$ connected components. Since $R$ is not connected, it is a decomposable continuum. Strictly speaking, the concept of \"composants of $R$\" is not defined. The question becomes ill-posed.\n\nTo find an answer, we must assume the question is well-posed. This restricts us to Case A and Case B. The possible numbers of composants are 0 and $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe maximum possible number is therefore $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe question asks for the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder. This implicitly requires the remainder to be an indecomposable continuum. This condition holds if and only if the remainder is connected (i.e., has one component), which in turn holds if and only if $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ has one end.\nWhen this condition is met (and $X$ is non-degenerate), the remainder is a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum. Any such continuum has $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants.\nIn the degenerate case where $X$ is a single point, the remainder is empty and has 0 composants.\nThe set of possible values for the number of composants is $\\{0, \\mathfrak{c}\\}$. The maximum of this set is $\\mathfrak{c}$."
