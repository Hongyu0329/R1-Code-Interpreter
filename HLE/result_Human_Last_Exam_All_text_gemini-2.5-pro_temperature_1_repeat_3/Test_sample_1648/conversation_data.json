    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the objects and the goal**\nWe need to analyze the algebraic K-groups $K_{2n}(R)$ for the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27$. The goal is to find the maximum natural number $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$**\nThe ring is $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27 = \\mathbb{Z}/3^3$. For a ring of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$, its K-groups are related to the K-groups of the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Specifically, for any $i \\ge 1$, there is a decomposition:\n$K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k) \\cong K_i(\\mathbb{F}_p) \\oplus V_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$\nwhere $V_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is a $p$-primary torsion group.\n\nIn our case, $p=3$, $k=3$, and the index is $i=2n$. We have:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_3) \\oplus V_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$.\n\nBy a fundamental result of Quillen on the K-theory of finite fields, we know that for any finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ and any $j \\ge 1$, the even K-groups are trivial: $K_{2j}(\\mathbb{F}_q) = 0$.\nTherefore, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_3) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\nThis simplifies the structure of our group to:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong V_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$.\nThis means that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is a 3-primary torsion group (a \"3-group\").\n\n**Step 3: Use the long exact sequence in K-theory**\nThe ring $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is the quotient of the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ by the ideal $I = (27)$. This gives rise to a long exact sequence in K-theory. To simplify the analysis, we consider the 3-adic completion of this sequence:\n$\\cdots \\to K_i(\\mathbb{Z})_3 \\to K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_3 \\to K_{i-1}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))_3 \\to K_{i-1}(\\mathbb{Z})_3 \\to \\cdots$\nHere, $G_3$ denotes the 3-primary part of an abelian group $G$, and $K_*(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))$ are the relative K-groups.\n\n**Step 4: Use properties of the K-theory of $\\mathbb{Z}$**\nA crucial result, connected to the Vandiver's conjecture and proven using results from Iwasawa theory, states that for any regular prime $p$, the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ have no $p$-torsion. The prime $p=3$ is a regular prime (as it does not divide the class number of the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$).\nTherefore, $K_i(\\mathbb{Z})_3 = 0$ for all $i \\ge 0$.\n\nSubstituting this into the long exact sequence, the sequence breaks apart into short exact sequences:\n$0 \\to K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_3 \\to K_{i-1}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))_3 \\to 0$\nThis implies an isomorphism:\n$K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_3 \\cong K_{i-1}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))_3$.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the isomorphism to our specific problem**\nWe are interested in the group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$. As established in Step 2, this is a 3-group, so $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_3 = K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$.\nUsing the isomorphism from Step 4 with $i=2n$, we get:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong K_{2n-1}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))_3$.\n\nThe problem is now transformed: we need to find the largest $n$ for which the group $K_{2n-1}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))_3$ is non-zero. This group is non-zero if and only if the group $K_{2n-1}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))$ has non-trivial 3-primary torsion. For this to happen, the group itself must be non-zero.\n\n**Step 6: Use Soulé's vanishing theorem for relative K-groups**\nA fundamental theorem by Christophe Soulé states that the relative K-groups of the integers vanish above a certain degree. Specifically, for an integer $m \\ge 2$:\n$K_j(\\mathbb{Z}, (m)) = 0$ for all $j > m$.\n\nIn our case, $m=27$. We apply this theorem to the group $K_{2n-1}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))$. The theorem implies that this group is zero if its index $j = 2n-1$ is greater than 27.\n$2n-1 > 27 \\implies 2n > 28 \\implies n > 14$.\nSo, for any $n > 14$, the group $K_{2n-1}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))$ is zero. This in turn means $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero for $n>14$.\nThis establishes an upper bound on $n$. The largest possible value for $n$ is 14.\n\n**Step 7: Verify the boundary case**\nWe must check if the group is actually non-zero for $n=14$. For $n=14$, we need to determine if $K_{2 \\cdot 14}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = K_{28}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero.\nThis is equivalent to checking if $K_{2(14)-1}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))_3 = K_{27}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))_3$ is non-zero.\n\nAnother theorem by Soulé describes the group at the boundary of the vanishing range. It states that:\n$K_m(\\mathbb{Z}, (m)) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}, (m))$ is a finitely generated abelian group of rank 1. Thus, $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}, (m))$ is an infinite group.\nFor our case, with $m=27$, we have that $K_{27}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))$ is an infinite group. Specifically, it has the structure $K_{27}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus T$, where $T$ is a finite torsion group.\n\nNow we consider its 3-primary part:\n$K_{27}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))_3 = (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus T)_3 = \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus T_3$.\nThe group of 3-adic integers, $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, is non-zero. Therefore, $K_{27}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))_3$ is non-zero.\nSince $K_{28}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong K_{27}(\\mathbb{Z}, (27))_3$, we conclude that $K_{28}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have shown that:\n- For $n > 14$, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = 0$.\n- For $n = 14$, $K_{28}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
