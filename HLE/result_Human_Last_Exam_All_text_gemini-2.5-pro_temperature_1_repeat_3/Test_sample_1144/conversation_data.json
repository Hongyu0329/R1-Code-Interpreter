    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question:\nThe question asks for the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum ($\\Delta p$) to its actual momentum ($p$) when it is in the first Bohr orbit. We are given the uncertainty in its position ($\\Delta x$).\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** Calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The electron is in the **first Bohr orbit**, which means the principal quantum number is $n=1$.\n    *   The uncertainty in the electron's position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n3.  **Identify the Necessary Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle connects the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$). The formula is $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. For this problem, we will consider the case of minimum uncertainty, so we use the equality: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n    *   **Bohr's Model of the Atom:** This model provides a way to calculate the momentum ($p$) of an electron in a specific orbit. According to Bohr's quantization condition, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in the n-th orbit is given by $L = n\\hbar$. Since angular momentum is also $L = mvr = pr$ (where $p$ is the linear momentum and $r$ is the orbital radius), we have $pr_n = n\\hbar$.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n1.  **Constants:** We need the values of standard physical constants.\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar = 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ JÂ·s}$.\n    *   Radius of the first Bohr orbit, $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n2.  **Unit Conversion:** The given uncertainty in position is in picometers (pm). All units must be converted to the standard SI system (meters, kilograms, seconds) for calculations.\n    *   $1 \\text{ pm} = 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n3.  **Minimum Uncertainty:** The problem implies finding the minimum possible uncertainty in momentum for the given uncertainty in position, so we use the equality in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n4.  **Dimensionless Ratio:** The final answer is a ratio of two momenta, so it should be a dimensionless number.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$).**\n\n*   According to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle for minimum uncertainty:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the momentum of the electron ($p$) in the first Bohr orbit.**\n\n*   According to Bohr's quantization condition for angular momentum:\n    $L = pr_n = n\\hbar$\n*   For the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$, and the radius is $r_1$.\n    $p \\cdot r_1 = 1 \\cdot \\hbar$\n*   Solving for the momentum, $p$:\n    $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.**\n\n*   Now, we form the ratio using the expressions from Step 1 and Step 2:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1} \\right)}$\n*   We can simplify this expression by canceling out the reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar$:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{1}{2 \\Delta x} \\cdot \\frac{r_1}{1} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   This simplified formula allows us to calculate the ratio without needing the value of $\\hbar$.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the known values and find the numerical answer.**\n\n*   The radius of the first Bohr orbit is $r_1 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   The uncertainty in position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   Now, substitute these values into our simplified ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n*   $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29}{2}$\n*   $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n\nThe ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum is 2.645.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
