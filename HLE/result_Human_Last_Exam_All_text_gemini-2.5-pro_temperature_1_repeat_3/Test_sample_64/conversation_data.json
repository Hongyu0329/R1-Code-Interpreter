    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Word and its Morae**\nThe word is 「弟」, pronounced \"otouto\". In Japanese, pitch accent is based on morae (units of sound similar to syllables). Let's break down \"otouto\" into its morae:\n*   お (o) - 1st mora\n*   と (to)\n*   う (u) - This is a long vowel sound extending \"to\", so it counts as its own mora. The second and third morae together are とう (tou).\n*   と (to) - 4th mora\nSo, 「弟」 is a four-mora word.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Pitch Accent Patterns**\nJapanese pitch accent patterns describe where the pitch falls in a word. The main types are:\n*   **A. Heiban (平板, [0])**: The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles.\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高, [1])**: The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on all subsequent morae.\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高)**: The pitch starts low, rises somewhere in the middle of the word, and then falls before the word ends. For a 4-mora word, this could be [2] (falls on the 3rd mora) or [3] (falls on the 4th mora).\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high until the last mora, and then drops on the following particle. For a 4-mora word, this is a [4] pattern.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Pitch Accent of 「弟」**\nAccording to standard Japanese dictionaries, such as the NHK Japanese Pronunciation and Accent Dictionary, the standard (Tokyo dialect) pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is **[0]**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the Numerical Notation to the Pattern Name**\nThe numerical notation [0] corresponds to the **Heiban (平板)** pattern.\n\n**Step 5: Visualize the Heiban Pattern for 「弟」**\n*   お (o) is low.\n*   と(う)と (touto) is high.\n*   A particle following it, like 「が」 (ga), would also be high.\n*   The pitch contour is: お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(H).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Mora Count:** Correctly counting the morae is crucial. The long vowel sound (とう) consists of two morae (と + う).\n*   **Distinguishing from Similar Words:** It is easy to confuse 「弟」 (otouto, younger brother) with 「妹」 (imouto, younger sister). 「妹」 has an **Odaka (尾高)** [4] accent pattern. Its pitch contour is い(L) も(H) う(H) と(H), but a following particle drops in pitch: が(L). This is a common mistake for learners.\n*   **Standard Dialect:** The question asks for the \"standard\" pattern, which typically refers to the Tokyo dialect used in broadcasting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the standard pitch accent notation [0], the pattern for 「弟」 is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
