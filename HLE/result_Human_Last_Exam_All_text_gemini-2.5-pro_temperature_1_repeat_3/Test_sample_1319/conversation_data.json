    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify all historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad.**\nThe first step is to comb through the text of the *Iliad* and compile a list of all named mountains that correspond to real, physical locations in Greece and Turkey.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The most prominent mountain, home of the gods. It is mentioned throughout the epic.\n*   **Mount Ida:** The mountain near Troy from which the gods, particularly Zeus, often observed the battle. This is a key location in the narrative.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Peak: Fengari):** In Book 13, the god Poseidon watches the war from \"the topmost peak of wooded Samothrace.\"\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned several times, most famously as the source of the ash-wood for Achilles' spear. It is also mentioned in the context of the battle between the Lapiths and the Centaurs.\n*   **Mount Ossa:** Mentioned alongside Pelion in a mythological reference to the giants Otus and Ephialtes, who tried to stack the mountains to reach the heavens.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Mentioned in Book 14 as one of the landmarks Hera passes during her flight from Olympus to Mount Ida.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in Book 2, in the \"Catalogue of Ships.\" It is identified as the mountain range in Lydia from which the Maeonian contingent of the Trojan army originates.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the modern elevation of each identified mountain.**\nTo find the tallest, we need the official or widely accepted elevations for these historical peaks.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 feet)\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Modern Turkish: Bozdağ):** 2,157 meters (7,077 feet)\n*   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n*   **Mount Ossa (Modern Greek: Kissavos):** 1,978 meters (6,490 feet)\n*   **Mount Ida (Modern Turkish: Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n*   **Mount Pelion (Modern Greek: Pilio):** 1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Peak: Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n\n**Step 3: Compare the elevations to find the tallest after Mount Olympus.**\nNow, we arrange the mountains from the list (excluding Mount Olympus) in descending order of height.\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,157 m\n2.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n3.  **Mount Ossa:** 1,978 m\n4.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n5.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n6.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the final answer.**\nThe tallest mountain on the list after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Historical vs. Mythological:** The question specifically asks for a \"historical mountain,\" meaning a real, verifiable geographic location. All the mountains listed above fit this description.\n2.  **Specific Textual Reference:** It is crucial that the mountain is mentioned within the *Iliad* itself, not just in broader Greek mythology. For example, Mount Parnassus, while famous, is not a significant location in the *Iliad*. All the mountains in our analysis have clear textual references in the epic.\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Mountain:** Some names can be ambiguous. For instance, there is another Mount Ida on Crete associated with Zeus's birth, but the context of the *Iliad* clearly points to the Mount Ida near Troy.\n4.  **Modern Names and Elevations:** Using accurate, current data for elevations is essential. The modern names (e.g., Bozdağ for Tmolus, Kissavos for Ossa) help in finding the correct geographical data.\n5.  **Peaks vs. Mountains:** Some sources might refer to a specific peak, like Gargarus on Mount Ida or Fengari on Samothrace. For this analysis, we treat the entire mountain massif as the geographical feature.\n\nBased on this analysis, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
