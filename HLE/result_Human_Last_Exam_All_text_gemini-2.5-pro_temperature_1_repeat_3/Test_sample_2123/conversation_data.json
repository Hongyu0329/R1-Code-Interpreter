    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question lies in the connection between three elements: a) a Russian translation, b) the \"wide boulevards of Vienna,\" and c) the surname of an English poet. The key is that this connection appears specifically in the *Russian* text.\n\n2.  **Identify the Linguistic Clue:** The Russian word for \"boulevard\" is **бульвар** (pronounced 'bul'var'). The question implies a play on words or a \"false friend\" that occurs in the Russian language.\n\n3.  **Search for a Phonetic Match:** We need to find the surname of an English poet that sounds very similar to the Russian word \"бульвар\" ('bul'var').\n\n4.  **Identify the Candidate:** The English surname **Bulwer** is a nearly perfect phonetic match for \"бульвар\" ('bul'var').\n\n5.  **Connect to a Poet:** The most famous literary figure with this surname is Edward **Bulwer**-Lytton (1803–1873). While he is more widely known as a novelist (famous for the opening line \"It was a dark and stormy night...\"), he was also a published poet.\n\n6.  **Confirm the Cultural Context:** In Russian literary and intellectual circles, there is a well-known pun based on this phonetic similarity. When a Russian speaker sees a boulevard, they might make a witty remark referencing the writer Bulwer-Lytton. For example, the phrase \"Я вижу бульвар\" (\"Ya vizhu bul'var\") can mean \"I see the boulevard,\" but it can also be humorously interpreted as \"I see Bulwer.\" A description of the grand boulevards of Vienna (like the famous Ringstrasse) in a Russian essay is a perfect context for such a literary pun to appear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe pun connects the Russian word for boulevard, \"бульвар\" (bul'var), with the surname of the English poet and novelist, Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Therefore, the surname in question is Bulwer.\n\n<<<Bulwer>>>"
