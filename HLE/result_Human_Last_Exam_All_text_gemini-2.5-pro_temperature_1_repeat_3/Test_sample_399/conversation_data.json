    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of differential equation**\nThe given initial value problem is:\n$$\nx'(t)=(t-1)\\cdot x^2(t), \\quad x(0)=-8\n$$\nWe can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nThis is a first-order non-linear differential equation. The right-hand side is a product of a function of $t$ and a function of $x$. This means the equation is separable.\n\n**Step 2: Separate the variables**\nWe move all terms involving $x$ to the left side and all terms involving $t$ to the right side.\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt\n$$\n*Careful point:* This step requires dividing by $x^2$. This is permissible because the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ is non-zero. By the existence and uniqueness theorem, the solution $x(t)$ will be non-zero in some interval containing $t=0$. The trivial solution $x(t) \\equiv 0$ is a solution to the differential equation, but it does not satisfy the given initial condition.\n\n**Step 3: Integrate both sides**\nWe integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nThe integral of the left side is:\n$$\n\\int x^{-2} dx = -x^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}\n$$\nThe integral of the right side is:\n$$\n\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t\n$$\nCombining these results and adding the constant of integration, $C$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Apply the initial condition to find the constant C**\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = C\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the particular solution**\nNow, substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nThis is the implicit solution to the initial value problem.\n\n**Step 6: Find the value of x(1)**\nWe need to find the value of $x$ when $t=1$. We can substitute $t=1$ directly into the equation we just found:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo simplify the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8}\n$$\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides to solve for $x(1)$:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n*Careful point:* We should check that the solution is defined at $t=1$. The explicit solution is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}}$. The denominator at $t=1$ is $-\\frac{1}{2}+1-\\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{8} \\neq 0$, so the solution is well-defined at $t=1$.\n\nFinal Answer: The value of $x(1)$ is $\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
