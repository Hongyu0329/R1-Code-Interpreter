The proposed filtering strategy is a four-step process. First, perform a paired differential expression analysis comparing the CAR-only versus CAR-IL15 samples, making sure to account for the four donors in the statistical model (e.g., design = ~donor + condition). Second, from the results table, identify contaminant genes by applying a stringent filter for a high positive log2FoldChange (e.g., > 5) and a low adjusted p-value (e.g., < 0.01), and export this list of gene names to a new file. Third, use this gene list to filter out and remove the contaminant genes from the original raw count matrix. Fourth, re-run the entire downstream bioinformatics pipeline, including normalization and differential expression analysis, using this new, cleaned count matrix to obtain unbiased results.
