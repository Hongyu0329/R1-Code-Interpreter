    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that mention the names of the prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Poem's Structure:** 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) is a short, didactic poem composed by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. It is designed to teach the fundamentals of Islamic creed (Aqeedah) in a way that is easy to memorize. Its topics follow the 'Pillars of Iman' (Faith), covering belief in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and Divine Decree.\n\n2.  **Locate the Section on the Prophets:** The belief in the Prophets and Messengers is a fundamental pillar of faith. As expected, the poem dedicates a specific section to this topic. This section enumerates the 25 prophets whose names are explicitly mentioned in the Holy Qur'an.\n\n3.  **Identify the Introductory Verse:** The section concerning the prophets' names begins with an introductory verse that states the number of prophets to be mentioned. This is **bayt (verse) 36**:\n    > تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ  \n    > كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    >\n    > *Translation: The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding, upon every responsible person, so verify and seize this opportunity.*\n\n    **Careful Point:** This verse introduces the list and sets the context, but it does not contain any of the prophets' actual names. The question specifically asks for the verses where the *names are mentioned*.\n\n4.  **Identify the Starting Verse of the List:** The actual enumeration of the names begins in the verse immediately following the introduction. This is **bayt (verse) 37**:\n    > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ  \n    > صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    >\n    > *Translation: They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with, Salih, and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.*\n\n    This verse contains the first six names on the list.\n\n5.  **Trace the Continuation of the List:** The names continue over the next few verses:\n    *   **Bayt 38:** Mentions Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 39:** Mentions Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n6.  **Identify the Concluding Verse of the List:** The list of the 25 prophets is completed in the next verse. This is **bayt (verse) 40**:\n    > إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى  \n    > عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    >\n    > *Translation: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa and Taha (a title for Prophet Muhammad), the seal (of the prophets), so leave misguidance.*\n\n    **Careful Point:** This verse concludes the list of names. The following verse (bayt 41) is a prayer for all the prophets mentioned (\"Upon them be peace and blessings...\") but does not list any more names.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe section dedicated to the prophets' names begins with an introduction in bayt 36. However, the actual listing of the names starts in **bayt 37** and concludes in **bayt 40**.\n\n<<<From bayt 37 to bayt 40.>>>"
