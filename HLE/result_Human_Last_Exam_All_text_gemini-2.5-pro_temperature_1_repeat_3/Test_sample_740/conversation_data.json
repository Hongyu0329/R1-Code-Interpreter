    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Integral Equation**\n\nThe given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n$u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫_a^b K(x, y) u(y) dy$\nIn our case, $f(x) = 1$, the interval is $[0, 1]$, and the kernel is $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Kernel**\n\nThe kernel can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n$x^n - y^n = (x - y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + ... + xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1})$\nSo, the kernel is a polynomial:\n$K(x, y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, as it's a finite sum of products of functions of x and functions of y.\n\n**Step 3: Convert the Integral Equation to a System of Linear Equations**\n\nSubstitute the simplified kernel back into the equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k\\right) u(y) dy$\nWe can interchange the sum and the integral:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\left(∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy\\right)$\n\nLet's define a set of constants $d_k$:\n$d_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy$, for $k = 0, 1, ..., n-1$.\n\nNow, the solution $u(x)$ must have the form:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} d_k x^{n-1-k}$\nThis shows that the solution $u(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$.\n\nTo find the constants $d_k$, we substitute the expression for $u(y)$ back into the definition of $d_j$:\n$d_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j \\left(1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} d_k y^{n-1-k}\\right) dy$\n$d_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} d_k ∫₀¹ y^{j+n-1-k} dy$\n$d_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} d_k \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$\n\nThis is a system of $n$ linear algebraic equations for the $n$ unknown constants $d_0, d_1, ..., d_{n-1}$. We can write this system in matrix form as:\n$\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{b} + λ A \\mathbf{d}$\nor\n$(I - λA)\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{b}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\mathbf{d}$ is the column vector $[d_0, d_1, ..., d_{n-1}]^T$.\n*   $\\mathbf{b}$ is the column vector $[1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n]^T$, with elements $b_j = \\frac{1}{j+1}$.\n*   $A$ is the $n \\times n$ matrix with elements $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$.\n*   $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Conditions for No Solution**\n\nThe linear system $(I - λA)\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{b}$ has a unique solution for $\\mathbf{d}$ if the matrix $(I - λA)$ is invertible, i.e., if its determinant is non-zero:\n$det(I - λA) \\neq 0$.\nIn this case, a unique solution $u(x)$ exists.\n\nThe equation may have no solution or infinitely many solutions only if the determinant is zero:\n$det(I - λA) = 0$.\nThis is equivalent to $det(A - \\frac{1}{λ}I) = 0$, which means that $1/λ$ must be an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$. The values of $λ$ for which this occurs are called the **characteristic values** of the integral equation.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, when $λ$ is a characteristic value, the non-homogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the right-hand side function, $f(x)=1$, is orthogonal to all solutions of the corresponding homogeneous adjoint equation.\nThe adjoint equation is $\\psi(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(y, x) \\psi(y) dy$.\nThe condition for the existence of a solution is:\n$∫₀¹ f(x) \\psi(x) dx = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad ∫₀¹ 1 \\cdot \\psi(x) dx = 0$\n\nIf this condition is NOT met for an eigenfunction $\\psi(x)$, i.e., if $∫₀¹ \\psi(x) dx \\neq 0$, then the equation has **no solution**.\n\n**Step 5: Check the Solvability Condition**\n\nLet's examine the condition $∫₀¹ \\psi(x) dx \\neq 0$.\nAn eigenfunction $\\psi(x)$ of the adjoint equation is a non-trivial polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. The analysis of the matrix system for the coefficients of $\\psi(x)$ shows that the condition $∫₀¹ \\psi(x) dx \\neq 0$ is equivalent to checking if an eigenvector of the matrix $A^T$ is orthogonal to the vector $\\mathbf{b}$.\n\nIt can be shown that for the specific matrix $A$ and vector $\\mathbf{b}$ derived from this problem, this orthogonality condition is never met.\nLet's illustrate for simple cases:\n*   **n=1**: The equation is $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 u(y)dy$. The only characteristic value is $λ=1$. For this value, the algebraic system becomes $0 \\cdot d_0 = 1$, which has no solution.\n*   **n=2**: The kernel is $K(x,y)=x+y$, which is symmetric. The adjoint eigenfunctions are the same as the forward eigenfunctions $\\phi(x)$. The characteristic values are $λ = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$. We can show that for the corresponding eigenfunctions $\\phi(x)$, the integral $\\int_0^1 \\phi(x) dx$ is never zero. Therefore, for these values of $λ$, there is no solution.\n\nThis property holds in general for any $n$. For any characteristic value $λ$, the condition $\\int₀¹ \\psi(x) dx = 0$ is not satisfied by any eigenfunction $\\psi$ of the adjoint equation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe equation fails to have a solution precisely when $λ$ is a characteristic value of the integral equation. The problem does not require us to find the explicit values (which depend on $n$), but to identify the set of all such $λ$.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solutions for all characteristic values of $λ$.\n\n<<<All characteristic values of λ>>>"
