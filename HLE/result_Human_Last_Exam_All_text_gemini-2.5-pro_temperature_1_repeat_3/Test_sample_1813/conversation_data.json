    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Generalized Markov Number \\(m_{p/q}\\):** This number belongs to the Lagrange and Markov spectra. It is defined as the Markov constant \\(\\mu(\\alpha)\\) of a specific quadratic irrational number \\(\\alpha\\). This number \\(\\alpha\\) is constructed in a standard way from the continued fraction of the rational number \\(p/q\\).\n*   **Associated Continued Fraction:** In this context, the \"continued fraction associated with \\(m_{p/q}\\)\" refers to the continued fraction of the quadratic irrational \\(\\alpha\\) that defines \\(m_{p/q}\\), not the continued fraction of the numerical value of \\(m_{p/q}\\) itself. This is because the entire structure of the Markov spectrum is characterized by the continued fractions of these irrational numbers.\n\n**2. Find the Continued Fraction of \\(p/q = 4/7\\)**\n\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the simple continued fraction of \\(4/7\\).\n*   \\( \\frac{4}{7} = 0 + \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} \\)\n*   \\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}} \\)\n*   \\( \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n*   \\( \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\nCombining these steps, we get:\n\\( \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} \\)\nIn standard notation, the continued fraction is \\(4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]\\). The sequence of coefficients is \\((c_1, c_2, c_3) = (1, 1, 3)\\).\n\n**3. Construct the Associated Quadratic Irrational \\(\\alpha_{4/7}\\)**\n\nThe theory of the Markov spectrum dictates that the quadratic irrational \\(\\alpha_{p/q}\\) corresponding to the rational number \\(p/q = [0; c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_k]\\) has a purely periodic continued fraction whose period is the reverse of the sequence of coefficients of \\(p/q\\).\n*   The sequence of coefficients for \\(4/7\\) is \\((1, 1, 3)\\).\n*   The reversed sequence is \\((3, 1, 1)\\).\n*   The continued fraction for the associated quadratic irrational \\(\\alpha_{4/7}\\) is therefore purely periodic with this reversed sequence.\n\nSo, the continued fraction is \\([\\overline{3, 1, 1}]\\).\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\) is the continued fraction of the quadratic irrational \\(\\alpha_{4/7}\\) we just constructed.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Associated\":** The most crucial point is to correctly interpret the phrase \"continued fraction associated with\". As demonstrated by the theory of the Markov spectrum, this refers to the continued fraction of the defining irrational number, \\(\\alpha_{p/q}\\), not the continued fraction of the value \\(m_{p/q}\\). For instance, the Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\) is numerically equal to \\(\\sqrt{17}\\). The continued fraction of \\(\\sqrt{17}\\) is \\([4; \\overline{8}]\\), but this is not what is meant by the \"associated continued fraction\" in this context.\n*   **Construction Rule:** It is important to remember the correct construction rule: find the continued fraction of \\(p/q\\), reverse the coefficients, and form a purely periodic continued fraction.\n*   **Verification (Optional but Recommended):** We can verify that our constructed continued fraction indeed yields the correct Markov number.\n    Let \\(x = [\\overline{3, 1, 1}]\\). Then \\(x = 3 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1+1/x}}\\).\n    This simplifies to the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0\\).\n    The Markov constant \\(\\mu(x)\\) for a root of \\(Ax^2+Bx+C=0\\) is given by \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{B^2-4AC}}{|A|}\\).\n    For \\(x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0\\), we have \\(A=1, B=-3, C=-2\\).\n    \\(\\mu(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{|1|} = \\frac{\\sqrt{9+8}}{1} = \\sqrt{17}\\).\n    Since \\(m_{4/7} = \\mu(\\alpha_{4/7})\\), this confirms that \\(m_{4/7} = \\sqrt{17}\\) and our construction of \\(\\alpha_{4/7}\\) with continued fraction \\([\\overline{3, 1, 1}]\\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is the continued fraction expression itself.\n\n<<<[\\overline{3, 1, 1}].>>>"
