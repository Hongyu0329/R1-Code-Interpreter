    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe core of the question is to identify which of the listed ballet steps concludes with the feet in the same relative position (i.e., the same foot in front) as they were at the beginning of the movement. Most of these steps begin and end in the 5th position.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The name of the step often provides a clue (e.g., *changé* means \"changed,\" *derrière* means \"behind\").\n*   We need to understand the mechanics of each jump or step, specifically how the legs move and land.\n*   For steps with multiple variations, we should consider the most fundamental or common form unless a specific variation is named.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Option:\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** *Entrechat* refers to a jump where the legs beat against each other in the air. The number indicates the total movements. An *entrechat six* has 6 movements (3 openings and 3 closings). A rule of thumb is that any *entrechat* with an even number (*quatre*, *six*, *huit*) changes the feet upon landing.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in 5th position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** *Échappé* is a jump from a closed position (5th) to an open one (2nd). *Battu* means the legs beat as they close. The key word here is ***changé***, which literally means \"changed.\" This instruction requires the dancer to land with the feet switched.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in 5th position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" In its most basic form (*assemblé côté* or to the side), the working leg brushes out to the side, the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and the legs are \"assembled\" together in the air to land simultaneously back in 5th position.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the same 5th position they started in (e.g., right foot front). While there are variations like *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under) that do change the feet, the fundamental, unmodified step does not. Among the choices, it is the one whose basic form maintains the starting position.\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** *Glissade* is a gliding step. The modifier ***derrière*** means \"behind.\" This specifies that the foot that starts in the front must close in the back at the end of the step.\n*   **Ending Position:** The front foot moves to the back, so the dancer lands in 5th position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative jump, similar in structure to a *pas de chat*, where each leg performs a *rond de jambe en l'air*. Like a *pas de chat*, the standard execution of the step involves changing the feet. The leg that starts in the back lands first, and the leg that starts in the front closes behind it.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in 5th position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition:\n\nBased on the analysis, *Entrechat six*, *Échappé battu changé*, *Glissade derrière*, and *Gargouillade* all result in a change of the feet from the starting position. The only step whose fundamental execution results in landing in the same position it started from is the **Assemblé**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
