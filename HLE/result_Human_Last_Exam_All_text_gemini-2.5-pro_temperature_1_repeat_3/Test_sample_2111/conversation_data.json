    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Figures and Concepts:** The question involves historian Fernand Braudel, writer Paul Morand, and the concept of inscribing something within a sphere to represent a global perspective.\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** The quote in question comes from the preface to Fernand Braudel's book *The Perspective of the World*, which is the third volume of his major work, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*. In this preface, Braudel sets out his argument for a global approach to history.\n\n3.  **Examine the Exact Quote:** To make his point, Braudel borrows an idea from the French writer Paul Morand. The relevant passage from Braudel's preface is:\n    > \"Paul Morand, speaking of the **foreign policy** of a given nation, once wrote that it should be 'inscribed inside a sphere'. By which he meant the terrestrial globe.\"\n\n4.  **Deconstruct the Quote and the Question:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"conceptual entity\" that Morand said should be inscribed in a sphere.\n    *   Braudel's text explicitly states that Morand was \"speaking of the **foreign policy** of a given nation.\"\n    *   This \"foreign policy\" is the specific entity Morand was referring to.\n    *   The question describes this entity as \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation,\" which aligns perfectly, as foreign policy is an action undertaken by a nation-state.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Information:** Fernand Braudel used Paul Morand's statement about foreign policy as an analogy for his own historical method. While Braudel's ultimate point was that a nation's *history* must be viewed globally, the specific entity mentioned in the original assertion by Morand, which Braudel quoted, was **foreign policy**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Braudel's point from Morand's:** It is crucial not to confuse what Morand said with what Braudel concluded from it. The question asks for the entity in Morand's assertion, not Braudel's own main argument. Braudel's argument is about *history*, but he uses Morand's point about *foreign policy* to get there.\n*   **Understanding the metaphor:** The \"sphere\" is a metaphor for the globe. The idea is that any single nation's policy cannot be understood in isolation but must be seen in the context of its interactions and position on the world stage.\n*   **Precision of the term:** The entity is not just \"a nation\" but a specific activity or concept associated with the nation. The quote pinpoints it as \"foreign policy.\"\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the conceptual entity in question is foreign policy.\n\n<<<foreign policy>>>"
