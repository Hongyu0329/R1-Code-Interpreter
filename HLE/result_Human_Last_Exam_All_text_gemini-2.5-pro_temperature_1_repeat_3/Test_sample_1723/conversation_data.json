    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core of the Question**\nThe question asks for the scientific name of the one mushroom genus that is known to create a spore print that is distinctly blue in color. A spore print is a crucial identification tool in mycology, made by collecting the spores that fall from a mushroom's gills.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Keyword Analysis**\n*   **Keywords:** Mushroom, genus, blue spore print.\n*   **Initial thought:** Blue is a very rare color for spore prints. Common colors include white, cream, pink, brown, and black. This rarity suggests the answer will be a specific, well-defined group.\n*   **Common \"blue\" mushrooms:** The first mushrooms that come to mind are species that are blue in color, such as the Indigo Milk Cap (*Lactarius indigo*) or the Sky Blue Mushroom (*Entoloma hochstetteri*). It is important to distinguish between the color of the mushroom's body and the color of its spores.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate Common Candidates**\n*   **Candidate 1: *Entoloma***\n    *   This genus includes some vividly blue-colored mushrooms, like *Entoloma hochstetteri*.\n    *   However, the defining characteristic of the entire *Entoloma* genus is its spore print, which is consistently pink to salmon-pink. Therefore, this is not the correct genus.\n*   **Candidate 2: *Cortinarius***\n    *   This large genus includes some species with violet or bluish caps and gills, like *Cortinarius violaceus*.\n    *   The spore print for the *Cortinarius* genus is characteristically rusty-brown to cinnamon-brown. This is also incorrect.\n*   **Candidate 3: *Lactarius***\n    *   This genus contains the most famous blue mushroom, *Lactarius indigo*.\n    *   This mushroom is striking: its cap, gills, and stem are all shades of indigo blue, and when cut, it \"bleeds\" a blue latex-like milk.\n    *   Because the mushroom is so thoroughly blue, it is a very common misconception that its spore print must also be blue.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Spore Print Color of *Lactarius indigo***\n*   Despite its overwhelmingly blue appearance, mycological field guides and scientific sources confirm that the spore print of *Lactarius indigo* is not blue. It is actually yellowish to cream-colored.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Findings and Address the Wording**\n*   Scientific fact check: In strict mycological terms, there is no known mushroom genus that produces a truly, distinctly blue spore print. The pigments responsible for spore color (melanins) do not typically produce a blue color.\n*   Interpreting the question: The question states there *is* a single genus \"known to produce\" a blue spore print. This wording can refer to popular knowledge or a widespread reputation, even if it is scientifically inaccurate.\n*   Conclusion: Given the options, the genus *Lactarius* is the only one that is famously and singularly linked to the color blue via its iconic species, *Lactarius indigo*. The association is so strong that it has led to the widespread (though incorrect) belief that it produces a blue spore print. In the context of a trivia question, this is the most plausible intended answer, as it points to this unique and famous association. No other genus fits the description of being \"known for\" this trait.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nThe question points towards a single, well-known genus. While scientifically no mushroom produces a true blue spore print, the genus *Lactarius* contains the species *Lactarius indigo*, a mushroom so famously blue in all its parts that it is widely, though mistakenly, believed to have a blue spore print. Therefore, it is the genus \"known\" for this characteristic.\n\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
