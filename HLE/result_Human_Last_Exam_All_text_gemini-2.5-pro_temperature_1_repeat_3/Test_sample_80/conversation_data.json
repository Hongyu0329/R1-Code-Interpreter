    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\nAn 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total. The edge squares are those on the first and last ranks (rows) and the first and last files (columns).\n*   The top row (rank 8) has 8 squares.\n*   The bottom row (rank 1) has 8 squares.\n*   The left column (file 'a') has 8 squares.\n*   The right column (file 'h') has 8 squares.\nThe four corner squares (a1, h1, a8, h8) are counted in both a rank and a file. So, the total number of unique edge squares is: 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 - 4 (corners) = 28.\nAlternatively, the inner board is a 6x6 square (36 squares). Total squares (64) - inner squares (36) = 28 edge squares.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Bishop's Attack and Color Constraint**\nA fundamental rule for bishops is that they only move and attack along diagonals. This means a bishop placed on a white square can only ever attack other pieces on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack other pieces on black squares. This allows us to solve the problem by considering the white and black squares independently.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Edge Squares by Color**\nOf the 28 edge squares, we need to determine how many are white and how many are black. By inspecting a standard chessboard layout:\n*   There are 14 white edge squares.\n*   There are 14 black edge squares.\nThe problem now becomes two independent sub-problems:\n1.  Find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 white edge squares.\n2.  Find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 black edge squares.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares**\nTo find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we must place them so that no two bishops share a diagonal. This is a classic \"maximum independent set\" problem. We can map the 14 white edge squares to a graph where an edge connects any two squares that are on the same diagonal.\n\nThe 14 white edge squares are: a2, a4, a6, a8, h1, h3, h5, h7, b1, d1, f1, c8, e8, g8.\n\nBy carefully listing all the attacking pairs (diagonals) between these squares, we find the graph of attacking squares consists of several disconnected components:\n*   One component is a 4-cycle: b1-a2-g8-h7-b1.\n*   A second component is a 4-cycle: d1-a4-e8-h5-d1.\n*   A third component is a 4-cycle: f1-a6-c8-h3-f1.\n*   A final component is a pair: a8-h1.\n\nThe maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place is the sum of the maximum independent sets of these components:\n*   For a 4-cycle (like b1-a2-g8-h7), we can place a maximum of 2 bishops (e.g., on b1 and g8).\n*   For a pair (like a8-h1), we can place a maximum of 1 bishop.\n\nSo, the total maximum for the white squares is 2 (from the first cycle) + 2 (from the second cycle) + 2 (from the third cycle) + 1 (from the pair) = 7 bishops.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares**\nThe 14 black edge squares have a layout that is geometrically congruent to the white squares. Therefore, the analysis is identical. The graph of attacking black squares will also consist of three 4-cycles and one pair, leading to the same maximum number.\nMaximum bishops on black edge squares = 7 bishops.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe total maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on all edge squares is the sum of the maximums for each color:\nTotal bishops = 7 (on white squares) + 7 (on black squares) = 14 bishops.\n\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would *lack* bishops.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28\n*   Number of occupied edge squares = 14\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Occupied edge squares\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
