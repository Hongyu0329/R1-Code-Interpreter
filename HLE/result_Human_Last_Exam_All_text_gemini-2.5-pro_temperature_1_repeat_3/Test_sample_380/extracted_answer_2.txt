The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered to be radial due to the Parker spiral structure of the interplanetary magnetic field. The justification for using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (Y and Z) to calculate normalized magnetic helicity is based on Taylor's Hypothesis. At L1, the solar wind speed is much greater than the Alfven speed (super-Alfvenic flow), meaning the wave structures are essentially "frozen-in" to the plasma and are swept past the stationary spacecraft. Since the solar wind flows almost perfectly radially, the spacecraft effectively measures a one-dimensional spatial cut of the wave along the radial direction. Consequently, the analysis is performed in a coordinate system aligned with this dominant flow direction (the radial direction), and the wave's transverse properties, like polarization and helicity, are calculated from the components perpendicular to it.
