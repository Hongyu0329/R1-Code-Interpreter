    "*   **Step 1: Understand the core question.** The question asks about the process that allows a duplicated gene to be kept in the genome (retention) and to change over time (divergence), rather than being lost. When a gene is duplicated, the new copy is initially redundant. Because it's redundant, it's not protected by natural selection and tends to accumulate mutations that make it non-functional (a process called pseudogenization). The question is looking for a mechanism that prevents this loss and instead leads to two different, functional genes.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the answer choices.**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene copy is \"rewritten\" using another homologous gene as a template. This process tends to make gene copies *more similar*, not more divergent. Therefore, it works against the divergence of duplicate genes. This choice is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a duplicate gene accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional. This describes the *loss* of the duplicate, not its retention as a functional gene. This is the most common fate of duplicate genes, but it's the opposite of what the question is asking about. This choice is incorrect.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. This explains both retention (the original copy is essential, and the new copy provides a new benefit) and divergence (the new copy changes to acquire its new function). This is a plausible mechanism.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model), the ancestral gene had multiple functions (e.g., it was active in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy loses a different part of its original function through mutation. As a result, both copies are now required to perform the complete set of the original gene's functions. This explains both retention (losing either copy would now be harmful) and divergence (each copy specializes and optimizes for its subset of functions). This is also a plausible mechanism.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a species or group of species diversifies rapidly to fill new ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not the molecular mechanism itself that explains how an individual duplicate gene is retained and diverges within a genome. This is the wrong level of biological organization. This choice is incorrect.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the plausible mechanisms (C and D).** Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n    *   Neofunctionalization requires a rare event: a mutation that creates a new, beneficial function must occur in the redundant gene copy *before* it is silenced by more common, function-destroying mutations.\n    *   Subfunctionalization provides a more passive and potentially more common route to retention. It relies on common, degenerative mutations that happen to strike different sub-functions in the two copies. Once each copy has lost a complementary function, both become indispensable. This process does not require a rare beneficial mutation to occur for the genes to be preserved.\n    *   Because subfunctionalization relies on more common types of mutations (degenerative) and provides a period where the duplicate can be maintained without immediate positive selection, many evolutionary biologists consider it a more probable or frequent mechanism for the initial preservation of duplicated genes, which then allows for their long-term divergence.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the most likely mechanism.** Based on the higher probability of the underlying mutational events, subfunctionalization is considered a very common and likely mechanism for preventing the loss of duplicate genes and facilitating their divergence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
