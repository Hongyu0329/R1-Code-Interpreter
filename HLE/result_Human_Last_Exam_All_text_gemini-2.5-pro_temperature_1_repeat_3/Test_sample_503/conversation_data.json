    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of the simplex category $\\Delta$ as a 2-category.**\n\n*   **Objects (0-cells):** The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite non-empty ordinals, denoted by $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$ for $k \\ge 0$. These are totally ordered sets.\n*   **Morphisms (1-cells):** For any two objects $[m]$ and $[n]$, a morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-Morphisms (2-cells):** The problem states that $\\Delta$ is viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$. This means that for any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ if and only if $f \\le g$ in the pointwise order. That is, $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. Since this defines a partial order on the set of morphisms $\\text{Hom}([m], [n])$, there is at most one 2-morphism between any two parallel 1-morphisms.\n\n**Step 2: Define an internal adjunction in this context.**\n\nAn internal adjunction from an object $A$ to an object $B$ in a 2-category consists of a pair of 1-morphisms $L: A \\to B$ and $R: B \\to A$, called the left and right adjoints respectively, along with two 2-morphisms:\n*   The **unit**: $\\eta: \\text{id}_A \\to R \\circ L$\n*   The **counit**: $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\text{id}_B$\nThese must satisfy certain coherence conditions (the triangle identities). However, in a locally posetal 2-category, if the unit and counit exist, they are unique, and the triangle identities are automatically satisfied.\n\nLet's translate the existence of the unit and counit into our specific setting, with $A = [m]$ and $B = [n]$ where $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n*   The existence of the unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_{[m]} \\to R \\circ L$ means that $\\text{id}_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$. In terms of elements, this is $i \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n*   The existence of the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\text{id}_{[n]}$ means that $L \\circ R \\le \\text{id}_{[n]}$. In terms of elements, this is $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\nSo, an internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ such that:\n1.  $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n2.  $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\nThis pair of conditions is precisely the definition of a **Galois connection** between the posets $([m], \\le)$ and $([n], \\le)$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps.**\n\nA well-known property of Galois connections $(L,R)$ between posets is that they are equivalent to the condition $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ for all $i \\in [m], j \\in [n]$. Let's use this to deduce properties of $L$ and $R$.\n\n*   Let $i=0$. The condition becomes $L(0) \\le j \\iff 0 \\le R(j)$. Since $R(j) \\in [m]$, the inequality $0 \\le R(j)$ is always true. Therefore, the left side $L(0) \\le j$ must also be true for all $j \\in [n]$. For this to hold, we must have $L(0) \\le \\min_{j \\in [n]} j = 0$. Since $L(0)$ must be non-negative, we must have $L(0) = 0$.\n\n*   Let $j=n$. The condition becomes $L(i) \\le n \\iff i \\le R(n)$. Since $L(i) \\in [n]$, the inequality $L(i) \\le n$ is always true. Therefore, the right side $i \\le R(n)$ must also be true for all $i \\in [m]$. For this to hold, we must have $\\max_{i \\in [m]} i \\le R(n)$, which means $m \\le R(n)$. Since $R(n) \\in [m]$, we must have $R(n) = m$.\n\nSo, any adjunction $(L,R)$ must satisfy $L(0)=0$ and $R(n)=m$.\n\nCrucially, the converse is also true:\n*   Any order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ with $L(0)=0$ has a unique right adjoint $R$, given by $R(j) = \\max\\{i \\in [m] \\mid L(i) \\le j\\}$.\n*   Any order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ with $R(n)=m$ has a unique left adjoint $L$, given by $L(i) = \\min\\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le R(j)\\}$.\n\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ and the set of order-preserving maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ satisfying $L(0)=0$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of such maps.**\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$. Let $m=23$ and $n=37$.\nAn order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is defined by a sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(m)$ such that $L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(m)$, where each $L(i) \\in [n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. So we need to find the number of sequences $L(1), \\dots, L(m)$ such that:\n$0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(m) \\le n$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. It is equivalent to choosing $m$ items from the set $[n]=\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ (which has $n+1$ elements) with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter (as we arrange them in non-decreasing order to define the map). This is a \"stars and bars\" problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $N$ items with replacement is given by the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{N \\choose k}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\n*   The number of items to choose is $k=m=23$ (the values for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$).\n*   The set of possible values is $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, so the number of choices is $N=n+1=38$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\nNumber of maps = $\\binom{(n+1) + m - 1}{m} = \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, using the strict inequality mapping: Let $y_i = L(i)$ for $i=1, \\dots, m$. We are counting sequences $0 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le \\dots \\le y_m \\le n$. Let $x_i = y_i + i - 1$. This transformation gives a strictly increasing sequence $0 \\le x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_m \\le n + m - 1$. This is equivalent to choosing $m$ distinct numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n+m-1\\}$, which has $n+m$ elements. The number of ways is $\\binom{n+m}{m}$.\n\nFor $m=23$ and $n=37$, the number is $\\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<$\\binom{60}{23}$>>>"
