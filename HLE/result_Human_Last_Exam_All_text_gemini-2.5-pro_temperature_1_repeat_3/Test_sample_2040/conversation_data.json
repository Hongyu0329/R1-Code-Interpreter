    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\n\nSPDC is a quantum optical process rooted in nonlinear optics. In this process, a single high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons). The key takeaway is that SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical effect**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the material property required for second-order nonlinear effects**\n\nAll second-order nonlinear optical processes, including SPDC and the more commonly known Second-Harmonic Generation (SHG), are governed by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$. For a material to exhibit SPDC, it must possess a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the condition for a material to have a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$**\n\nThere is a fundamental symmetry requirement for a material to have a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ (in the electric dipole approximation, which is the dominant mechanism). The material's crystal structure must **lack a center of inversion**. Materials that have a center of inversion are called \"centrosymmetric\". In such materials, the response to an applied electric field (+E) is identical to the response to a reversed field (-E), which mathematically forces all even-order susceptibility tensors, including $\\chi^{(2)}$, to be zero.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the material in question: Free-standing boron nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\nBoron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are two-dimensional (2D) allotropes of boron. Unlike graphene, which has a single stable honeycomb structure, borophene has many different possible atomic arrangements (polymorphs) due to boron's electron deficiency. We need to examine the crystal structure and symmetry of the common, stable forms of borophene.\n\n**Step 5: Investigate the crystal symmetry of borophene**\n\nThe most widely studied and experimentally synthesized phases of borophene, typically grown on a silver substrate but also studied theoretically as free-standing sheets, are the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3}$ phases.\n*   Both the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3}$ phases of borophene belong to the orthorhombic crystal system with the space group *pmmn* (No. 59).\n*   A key feature of the *pmmn* space group is that it contains a center of inversion.\n*   Therefore, these common and stable forms of borophene are **centrosymmetric**.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the findings to answer the question**\n\n1.  SPDC requires a non-zero second-order susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  A non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n3.  The common, stable forms of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Because they are centrosymmetric, their intrinsic bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero.\n5.  Consequently, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\n---\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Symmetry is Key:** The entire argument hinges on the crystal symmetry of the material. The lack of a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ in centrosymmetric materials is a fundamental rule in nonlinear optics.\n2.  **Ideal vs. Real Material:** This analysis applies to an ideal, defect-free, flat boron nanosheet. In a real material, factors like edges, vacancies, strain, wrinkles, or interactions with a substrate can locally break the inversion symmetry. This could lead to a very weak, localized $\\chi^{(2)}$ response (e.g., weak SHG has been observed from the edges of other 2D materials). However, this is not an intrinsic property of the material itself and would not lead to an efficient SPDC process characteristic of a true non-centrosymmetric crystal. The question asks about the nanosheets in general, implying their intrinsic properties.\n3.  **Higher-Order Effects:** While the dominant electric-dipole contribution to $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero, non-zero second-order effects can arise from electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole interactions. However, these effects are typically many orders of magnitude weaker and are generally considered negligible. For all practical purposes, SPDC is not expected.\n4.  **Polymorphism:** While the most common borophene phases are centrosymmetric, it is theoretically possible that a less stable, non-centrosymmetric polymorph could exist. However, based on current scientific understanding of the most stable forms, the conclusion holds.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, since the stable and commonly studied phases of free-standing boron nanosheets possess a centrosymmetric crystal structure, their intrinsic second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) is zero. A non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ is a fundamental requirement for spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit this phenomenon.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because the stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, meaning they lack the non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) that is required to mediate this process.>>>"
