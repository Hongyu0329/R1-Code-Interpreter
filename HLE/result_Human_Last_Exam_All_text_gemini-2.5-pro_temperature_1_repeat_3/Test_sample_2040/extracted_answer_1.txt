No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because the stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, meaning they lack the non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$) that is required to mediate this process.
