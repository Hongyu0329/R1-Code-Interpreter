    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metabolic fate of 1,4-¹³C glucose through glycolysis and subsequent CO₂-releasing pathways.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Starting Molecule**\nThe starting molecule is glucose with ¹³C isotopic labels at Carbon-1 (C1) and Carbon-4 (C4).\n\nThe linear structure of glucose is numbered as follows:\n*   **C1**: Aldehyde carbon (**¹³C-labeled**)\n*   C2: Hydroxyl group on the right\n*   C3: Hydroxyl group on the left\n*   **C4**: Hydroxyl group on the right (**¹³C-labeled**)\n*   C5: Hydroxyl group on the right\n*   C6: Primary alcohol carbon\n\n**Step 2: Trace the Carbons through the Preparatory Phase of Glycolysis**\nThe first few steps of glycolysis convert one molecule of glucose into one molecule of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). These steps (phosphorylation and isomerization) do not alter the carbon backbone or the positions of the labels.\n*   Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is still labeled at C1 and C4.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Cleavage of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate**\nThe enzyme aldolase cleaves the 6-carbon FBP molecule into two 3-carbon molecules:\n*   Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is formed from carbons C1, C2, and C3 of FBP.\n*   Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) is formed from carbons C4, C5, and C6 of FBP.\n\nLet's trace our ¹³C labels:\n*   The ¹³C label at **C1 of FBP** becomes the **C1 of DHAP**.\n*   The ¹³C label at **C4 of FBP** becomes the **C1 of GAP**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Isomerization of DHAP**\nThe enzyme triose phosphate isomerase rapidly converts DHAP into GAP so it can continue through glycolysis.\n*   The DHAP molecule (with ¹³C at its C1) is converted to a second molecule of GAP. The ¹³C label remains at the C1 position.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** At this stage, we now have **two** molecules of Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP).\n    1.  One GAP molecule from the bottom half of glucose (C4, C5, C6), which is ¹³C-labeled at C1.\n    2.  One GAP molecule from the top half of glucose (C1, C2, C3), which is also ¹³C-labeled at C1.\n    *   Therefore, both resulting GAP molecules are labeled at C1.\n\n**Step 5: Trace the Carbons through the Payoff Phase of Glycolysis**\nThe payoff phase converts each of the two GAP molecules into a pyruvate molecule. During this process, the carbon skeleton is maintained.\n*   C1 of GAP (the aldehyde carbon) becomes C1 of pyruvate (the carboxyl carbon).\n*   C2 of GAP becomes C2 of pyruvate (the keto carbon).\n*   C3 of GAP becomes C3 of pyruvate (the methyl carbon).\n\nSince both GAP molecules were labeled at C1, the two resulting pyruvate molecules are **both labeled at C1** (the carboxyl group, -COOH).\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the Release of CO₂ via Pyruvate Decarboxylation**\nGlycolysis itself does not produce CO₂. The first release of CO₂ occurs when pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which links glycolysis to the Krebs cycle.\n*   Reaction: Pyruvate → Acetyl-CoA + **CO₂**\n*   In this reaction, the C1 carboxyl group (-COOH) of pyruvate is removed and released as CO₂.\n\n**Step 7: Tally the Labeled CO₂ Molecules**\n*   We have two molecules of pyruvate entering the PDC reaction.\n*   Both molecules are ¹³C-labeled at the C1 position.\n*   The C1 of the first pyruvate is released as one molecule of **¹³CO₂**.\n*   The C1 of the second pyruvate is released as a second molecule of **¹³CO₂**.\n\nThe remaining 2-carbon acetyl groups (from C2 and C3 of pyruvate) form acetyl-CoA, which is now unlabeled. These unlabeled acetyl-CoA molecules enter the Krebs cycle, where further CO₂ is produced, but this CO₂ will not contain the ¹³C label from our original glucose molecule.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nFrom one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose, the two labeled carbons (C1 and C4) both end up as the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the two pyruvate molecules formed. Both of these carboxyl carbons are subsequently released as CO₂ by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Therefore, a total of two ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules are released.\n\n<<<2>>>"
