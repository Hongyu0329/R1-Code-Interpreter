    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number $n$ for which a set $G$ with $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ is not a group.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a group.**\nA group is a set $G$ combined with a binary operation $\\cdot$ that must satisfy four fundamental properties (axioms):\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements $a, b \\in G$, their product $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$. (Note: If $\\cdot$ is defined as a binary operation *on* $G$, this axiom is satisfied by definition).\n2.  **Associativity:** For any three elements $a, b, c \\in G$, the equation $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ must hold.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There must exist an element $e \\in G$ (called the identity element) such that for every element $a \\in G$, $a \\cdot e = e \\cdot a = a$.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element $a \\in G$, there must exist an element $a^{-1} \\in G$ (called the inverse of $a$) such that $a \\cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \\cdot a = e$.\n\nIf a structure $(G, \\cdot)$ fails to meet even one of these four axioms, it is not a group. Our goal is to find the smallest possible size of $G$ (the smallest $n$) for which such a failure can occur.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the cases for small values of n.**\n\n*   **Case n = 0:** The set $G$ is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Standard mathematical convention defines a group as a *non-empty* set. The existence of an identity element (axiom 3) requires that \"There must exist an element $e \\in G$\". If $G$ is empty, no such element can exist. Therefore, the empty set cannot form a group. If we were to ignore the non-empty convention, $n=0$ would be the answer. However, following the standard definition, we must consider non-empty sets, so we start with $n=1$.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:** Let the set be $G = \\{a\\}$.\n    *   **Closure:** There is only one possible binary operation we can define: $a \\cdot a = a$. The result, $a$, is in $G$, so closure is satisfied.\n    *   **Associativity:** We need to check if $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$.\n        *   Left side: $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot a = a$.\n        *   Right side: $a \\cdot (a \\cdot a) = a \\cdot a = a$.\n        *   Since both sides equal $a$, associativity is satisfied.\n    *   **Identity Element:** We need an element $e \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot e = e \\cdot a = a$. The only element in $G$ is $a$. Let's test if $a$ can be the identity: $a \\cdot a = a$. This fits the requirement. So, $a$ is the identity element.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For the element $a$, we need an inverse $a^{-1}$ such that $a \\cdot a^{-1} = e$. Since we found $e=a$, we need $a \\cdot a^{-1} = a$. The only choice for $a^{-1}$ is $a$ itself, and we already know $a \\cdot a = a$. So, the inverse of $a$ is $a$.\n    *   **Conclusion:** For $n=1$, any set with a binary operation will inevitably satisfy all group axioms. It is impossible to define an operation that makes it *not* a group. Thus, $n=1$ is not the answer.\n\n*   **Case n = 2:** Let the set be $G = \\{a, b\\}$.\n    *   We need to determine if we can define a binary operation $\\cdot$ on $G$ that fails at least one group axiom. Let's try to construct one.\n    *   Consider the following operation defined by a multiplication table:\n        $$\n        \\begin{array}{c|cc}\n        \\cdot & a & b \\\\\n        \\hline\n        a & a & a \\\\\n        b & a & a \\\\\n        \\end{array}\n        $$\n    *   Let's check the group axioms for this structure $(G, \\cdot)$:\n        1.  **Closure:** All the results in the table ($a$) are elements of $G$. So, closure is satisfied.\n        2.  **Identity Element:** Let's try to find an identity element $e$.\n            *   If $e=a$, we would need $a \\cdot b = b$. But from the table, $a \\cdot b = a$. So, $a$ is not the identity element.\n            *   If $e=b$, we would need $b \\cdot a = a$. But from the table, $b \\cdot a = a$. This part works. We also need $b \\cdot b = b$. But from the table, $b \\cdot b = a$. So, $b$ is not the identity element.\n        *   Since neither element in $G$ can act as the identity element, the identity axiom fails.\n    *   **Conclusion:** We have successfully constructed a set with $n=2$ elements and a binary operation that is not a group.\n\n**Step 3: Final determination.**\nWe have analyzed the cases for $n$ starting from the smallest possible value based on standard definitions.\n*   $n=1$ is not the answer because any such structure must be a group.\n*   $n=2$ is a possible answer because we found an example of a structure that is not a group.\n\nSince we are looking for the *smallest* such number $n$, and we have ruled out $n=1$ and found a valid example for $n=2$, the smallest number is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
