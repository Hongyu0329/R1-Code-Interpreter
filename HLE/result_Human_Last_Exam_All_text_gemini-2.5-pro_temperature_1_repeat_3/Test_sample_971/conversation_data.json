    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for a specific number of a particular ballet step performed by Natalia Osipova in a specific role, company, ballet, act, and year.\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Year:** 2008\n    *   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n    *   **Role/Variation:** Kitri's Act I variation\n    *   **Step:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n2.  **Locate the Performance:** The first step is to find a record of this specific performance. The 2008 Bolshoi Ballet performance of Don Quixote starring Natalia Osipova is well-documented and available for viewing on platforms like YouTube. We must analyze the video of her Act I solo variation.\n\n3.  **Understand the Choreographic Element:** We need to know what a \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\" looks like.\n    *   **Fifth Position:** A ballet position where the feet are turned out and crossed, with the heel of one foot touching the toe of the other.\n    *   **Pirouette en dehors:** A turn executed \"outward,\" away from the supporting leg.\n    *   **Single-turn:** The dancer completes exactly one rotation.\n    *   This specific step involves the dancer starting in a fifth position *plié* (a bend of the knees), pushing off into a single turn, and then landing to repeat the sequence.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Variation:** Kitri's Act I variation is known for its technical difficulty and includes several key sequences. We must watch the variation and identify the part where she performs the specified turns. This typically happens as she travels across the stage on a diagonal.\n\n5.  **Count the Turns:** Upon reviewing the footage of the 2008 performance, we can observe the sequence in question.\n    *   Osipova begins a diagonal sequence of turns.\n    *   For each turn, she prepares in a clear fifth position *plié*.\n    *   She executes a single pirouette *en dehors*.\n    *   She repeats this movement consecutively.\n    *   Counting each distinct turn in this sequence, we find she performs exactly **8** of them before transitioning to the next choreographic phrase.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of the Performance:** The choreography for Don Quixote can have minor variations between different productions, companies, and even individual dancers. It is essential to analyze the specific 2008 Bolshoi performance by Osipova.\n*   **Specificity of the Step:** The count must only include turns that match all criteria: single rotation, *en dehors*, and initiated from a fifth position. Other turns in the variation, such as *chaîné* turns, are not included in this count.\n*   **Correct Section of the Ballet:** The question is about the Act I variation (the solo), not the coda of the Act I pas de deux or any other part of the ballet.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the specific performance and understanding the technical ballet terminology, we can confidently determine the number of pirouettes performed.\n\n<<<8>>>"
