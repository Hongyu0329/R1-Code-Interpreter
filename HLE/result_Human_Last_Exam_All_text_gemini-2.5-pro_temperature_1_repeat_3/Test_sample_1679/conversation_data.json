    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Key Elements of the Question\nThe question requires us to find a specific film that meets three criteria:\n1.  It must have won the **Academy Award for Best Picture**.\n2.  It must be the **first** such winner chronologically.\n3.  It must **depict a Luxor Obelisk** on-screen.\n\n### Step 2: Understand \"Luxor Obelisk\" and its Locations\nThere are two \"Luxor Obelisks,\" originally a pair from the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   **Obelisk 1:** Remains at its original location at the **Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt**.\n*   **Obelisk 2:** Was moved to Paris in the 1830s and now stands at the center of the **Place de la Concorde in Paris, France**.\n\nTherefore, we need to search for Best Picture winners featuring scenes filmed or set in either Luxor, Egypt (at the temple) or Paris, France (at the Place de la Concorde).\n\n### Step 3: Chronological Search of Best Picture Winners\nWe will review the list of Best Picture winners chronologically, looking for the first film set in one of these two locations.\n\n*   **1920s - 1930s:** Winners like *Wings*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *It Happened One Night*, and *Gone with the Wind* are set in places like WWI battlefields, Germany, the American roadway, and the American South, respectively. None are set in Luxor or feature the Place de la Concorde.\n*   ***The Life of Emile Zola* (1937):** This film is set in Paris. However, its key scenes take place in courtrooms, apartments, and the courtyard of the Ã‰cole Militaire (for the Dreyfus degradation), not the Place de la Concorde. The obelisk is not a featured landmark.\n*   ***Casablanca* (1943):** This film is famously set in Casablanca, Morocco, but contains a significant flashback sequence in Paris. While these scenes show Rick and Ilsa's romance and feature the Arc de Triomphe during the Nazi invasion, they do not include a clear shot of the Place de la Concorde or its obelisk.\n*   **Post-WWII films:** We continue chronologically past *The Lost Weekend* (1945), *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946), etc., which are set in the USA.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the First Confirmed Depiction\n*   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** This musical is set entirely in Paris. The film's climax is a lavish, 17-minute ballet sequence that is a dreamlike tour of Paris through the styles of famous French painters. One of the key settings in this ballet is a vibrant, stylized representation of the **Place de la Concorde**, created in the style of artist Raoul Dufy. The Luxor Obelisk is central to this set piece and is clearly depicted.\n\n### Step 5: Verify That No Earlier Winner Qualifies and Confirm \"First\" Status\nHaving found a strong candidate in the 1951 winner, we confirm that no earlier winner clearly depicts either obelisk. We also check subsequent winners to understand the context.\n*   ***Around the World in 80 Days* (1956):** This film features Phileas Fogg's travels, including a stop in Paris where the Place de la Concorde is shown. However, this was released five years after *An American in Paris*.\n*   ***Gigi* (1958):** Another musical set and filmed in Paris, which also features many famous landmarks. Again, this film won after *An American in Paris*.\n*   **Films set in Egypt:** No Best Picture winner from this era (or any, for that matter) features prominent scenes at the Luxor Temple showing the remaining obelisk. Films like *Cleopatra* (1963) were nominated but did not win Best Picture.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe chronological analysis shows that while other Best Picture winners are set in Paris, the first one to clearly depict the Luxor Obelisk (the one in the Place de la Concorde) is *An American in Paris*.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
