    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of curve and its parameters.**\nThe curve is given by the parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\nThis is a Lissajous curve. We can identify the angular frequencies as a = 9 and b = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the period of the curve.**\nThe period of x(t) = cos(9t) is T_x = 2π/9.\nThe period of y(t) = sin(5t) is T_y = 2π/5.\nTo trace the entire curve, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the individual periods.\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1 / GCD(9, 5)) = 2π / 1 = 2π.\nSo, the full curve is traced as t ranges over an interval of length 2π, for example, t ∈ [0, 2π).\n\n**Step 3: Understand what a self-intersection point is.**\nA self-intersection point is a point (x, y) on the curve that is reached at two or more different parameter values (times) t. That is, we are looking for the number of distinct points (x, y) for which there exist t1 ≠ t2 (within the period [0, 2π)) such that:\n(x(t1), y(t1)) = (x(t2), y(t2))\nThis means:\n1.  cos(9t1) = cos(9t2)\n2.  sin(5t1) = sin(5t2)\n\n**Step 4: Use the established formula for the number of self-intersections of Lissajous curves.**\nFor Lissajous curves of the form x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are coprime positive integers, there are well-known formulas for the number of self-intersection points. The formula depends on the parity of 'a' and 'b'.\n\nThe relevant formulas are:\n*   If both 'a' and 'b' are odd, the number of self-intersections is (ab - 1) / 2.\n*   If 'a' is odd and 'b' is even, the number of self-intersections is (ab - b) / 2.\n*   If 'a' is even and 'b' is odd, the number of self-intersections is (ab - a) / 2.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the correct formula to the given curve.**\nIn our case, a = 9 and b = 5.\n*   Check if they are coprime: The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is GCD(9, 5) = 1. So, they are coprime.\n*   Check their parity: Both 9 and 5 are odd numbers.\n\nTherefore, we use the formula for when both 'a' and 'b' are odd:\nNumber of self-intersections = (a * b - 1) / 2\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer.**\nSubstitute the values a = 9 and b = 5 into the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 * 5 - 1) / 2\n= (45 - 1) / 2\n= 44 / 2\n= 22\n\nThe curve has 22 self-intersection points.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Correct Formula:** It is crucial to use the correct formula. There are different formulas for different forms of Lissajous curves (e.g., x=sin(at), y=sin(bt) has a different formula, (a-1)(b-1)/2, for its interior intersections). The form x=cos(at), y=sin(bt) corresponds to a specific phase shift (π/2) which affects the total number of intersections, including those on the boundary of the containing rectangle [-1,1]x[-1,1].\n2.  **Coprime Condition:** The formulas are simplest when 'a' and 'b' are coprime. If they are not, the curve would trace a simpler Lissajous figure corresponding to the reduced fraction a/b.\n3.  **Full Period:** The calculation is based on the curve being traced completely, which we verified requires a parameter interval of 2π.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis using the established formula provides a direct path to the solution.\n\n<<<22>>>"
