The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value but differs for the two reactions. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a higher molar ratio, typically in the range of 0.25 to 0.50, is ideal. For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS), a lower molar ratio, often in the range of 0.05 to 0.15, is optimal.
