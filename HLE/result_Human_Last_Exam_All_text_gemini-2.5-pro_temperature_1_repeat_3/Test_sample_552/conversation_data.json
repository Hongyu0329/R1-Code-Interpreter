    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks about a specific citation in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The paper's official title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n2.  **Examine the Paper for Formal Citations:** The first step is to check the paper itself for any bibliographic references, footnotes, or in-text citations mentioning a person's name. Upon careful examination of the original 1905 paper as published in *Annalen der Physik*, it is a well-documented historical fact that the paper contains **no formal citations or references** to any other work. Authoritative scientific biographies, like Abraham Pais's \"Subtle is the Lord...\", confirm this, noting the paper's revolutionary nature and its lack of references.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Word \"Cite\":** Given that there are no formal citations, the question must be using the word \"cite\" in a broader sense, meaning \"to refer to the foundational work of\" or \"to build upon the ideas of\". The paper's very subject is an application of the \"molecular-kinetic theory of heat\".\n\n4.  **Identify the Key Influence for the Theory:** The molecular-kinetic theory of heat, which provides the theoretical underpinning for Einstein's entire paper, was primarily developed and championed by **Ludwig Boltzmann**. While James Clerk Maxwell also did pioneering work, Boltzmann is the central figure for the statistical interpretation of thermodynamics that Einstein uses.\n\n5.  **Connect the Term \"Lectures\":** The question specifically mentions \"lectures\". This is a crucial clue. Ludwig Boltzmann wrote a famous and highly influential two-volume book titled ***Vorlesungen über Gastheorie*** (**Lectures on Gas Theory**). We know from Einstein's personal correspondence that he had read and studied this work in the years leading up to 1905. Therefore, the term \"lectures\" points directly to Boltzmann's key text on the subject.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:** Although Einstein did not include a formal bibliographic citation in his 1905 Brownian motion paper, the work is a direct and brilliant application of the principles laid out by Ludwig Boltzmann. The specific mention of \"lectures\" in the question strongly suggests a reference to Boltzmann's book, *Lectures on Gas Theory*. Therefore, despite the lack of a formal citation, the intellectual debt is clear and directly points to Boltzmann.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on this analysis, the person whose work, specifically his published \"lectures,\" Einstein's paper was fundamentally based upon is Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
