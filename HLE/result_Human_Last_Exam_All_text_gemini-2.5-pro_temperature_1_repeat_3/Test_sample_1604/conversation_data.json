    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Artist and Her Subject Matter:** The artist in question is Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933), a renowned British painter famous for her detailed and dramatic scenes of British military history. The question requires us to find the most recent (latest) historical battle she portrayed in her paintings.\n\n2.  **List Key Battle Paintings and Their Historical Events:** We need to compile a list of Lady Butler's significant paintings that depict specific battles or military campaigns and identify the date of each event.\n\n    *   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): This painting depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which took place on **June 16, 1815**, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n    *   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): This iconic work shows the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on **June 18, 1815**.\n    *   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): This painting depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman, which occurred on **November 5, 1854**, during the Crimean War.\n    *   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): This shows the successful defense of the Rorke's Drift mission station during the Anglo-Zulu War on **January 22–23, 1879**.\n    *   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1882): This painting portrays an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War on **January 28, 1881**.\n    *   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted 1885): This work depicts the British victory at the Battle of Tel El Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War on **September 13, 1882**.\n    *   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted c. 1885): This shows the Nile Expedition of **1884–1885**, an attempt to relieve General Gordon during the Mahdist War.\n    *   ***The Charge of the 21st Lancers at Omdurman*** (painted c. 1898): This depicts a famous cavalry charge during the Battle of Omdurman on **September 2, 1898**, part of the Mahdist War.\n    *   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** (painted 1914): This painting shows an event from the beginning of World War I, the Great Retreat from Mons, which took place in **August 1914**.\n    *   ***A Canadian War Memorial: The Van-Doos*** (painted c. 1918-1919): This work, commissioned by the Canadian War Memorials Fund, depicts the Royal 22e Régiment (known as the Van-Doos) in the trenches during the Second Battle of Ypres in **April 1915**.\n\n3.  **Compare the Dates of the Historical Events:** Now, we arrange the battles in chronological order to identify the latest one.\n\n    *   Battle of Quatre Bras / Waterloo: 1815\n    *   Battle of Inkerman: 1854\n    *   Battle of Rorke's Drift: 1879\n    *   Battle of Laing's Nek: 1881\n    *   Battle of Tel El Kebir: 1882\n    *   Nile Expedition: 1884–1885\n    *   Battle of Omdurman: 1898\n    *   Retreat from Mons (WWI): August 1914\n    *   Second Battle of Ypres (WWI): **April 1915**\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the dates, the latest historical event depicted by Lady Butler is the Second Battle of Ypres, which occurred in April 1915.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguish Painting Date from Event Date:** The question asks for the latest *historical battle*, not the last painting she completed. Her paintings of World War I were created during or after the war, but they depict events from 1914 and 1915.\n*   **Comprehensiveness:** It's important to consider her entire body of work, especially her later commissions for World War I subjects, which are less famous than her Victorian-era paintings like *The Roll Call* or *Scotland for Ever!*.\n*   **Specificity of Events:** Identifying the specific battle is key. For instance, both *The Retreat from Mons* and *The Van-Doos* depict World War I, but the Second Battle of Ypres (1915) occurred later than the Retreat from Mons (1914).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Second Battle of Ypres.\n\n<<<Second Battle of Ypres>>>"
