    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of the graph \\( G \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Graph \\( G \\):** The graph in question is defined as the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\".\n*   **Sum of Graphs:** In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs, often denoted by the '+' symbol, typically refers to the **graph join** operation. The join of two graphs \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\), written \\(G_1 + G_2\\), is formed by taking disjoint copies of \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) and adding all possible edges between the vertices of \\(G_1\\) and the vertices of \\(G_2\\).\n*   **Cycles of length \\( n \\) (\\(C_n\\)):** These are graphs with \\( n \\) vertices and \\( n \\) edges forming a single loop.\n*   **Chromatic Number (\\(\\chi(G)\\)):** This is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\( G \\) so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number:** The problem asks for the maximum possible value of \\(\\chi(G)\\), which implies that \\(\\chi(G)\\) might depend on the parameter \\( n \\). We need to find the largest value \\(\\chi(G)\\) can take for any valid \\( n \\) (\\(n \\ge 3\\)).\n\n**2. Formulate the Graph Structure**\n\nLet the three cycles be \\(C_n^{(1)}\\), \\(C_n^{(2)}\\), and \\(C_n^{(3)}\\). According to the graph join operation:\n*   The graph \\( G \\) is \\( C_n^{(1)} + C_n^{(2)} + C_n^{(3)} \\).\n*   The vertex set of \\( G \\) is the disjoint union of the vertex sets of the three cycles. If \\(V_1, V_2, V_3\\) are the vertex sets of the three cycles, then \\(V(G) = V_1 \\cup V_2 \\cup V_3\\), and \\(V_i \\cap V_j = \\emptyset\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\).\n*   The edge set of \\( G \\) contains all edges within each cycle, plus all edges connecting any vertex from one cycle to any vertex in another cycle.\n\n**3. Apply the Chromatic Number Formula for Graph Joins**\n\nA key property of the graph join operation is that the chromatic number of the resulting graph is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs.\nFor two graphs \\(H_1\\) and \\(H_2\\):\n\\[ \\chi(H_1 + H_2) = \\chi(H_1) + \\chi(H_2) \\]\nThis rule can be extended to the join of three graphs:\n\\[ \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n^{(1)} + C_n^{(2)} + C_n^{(3)}) = \\chi(C_n^{(1)}) + \\chi(C_n^{(2)}) + \\chi(C_n^{(3)}) \\]\nSince all three cycles are of the same length \\( n \\), they have the same chromatic number, \\(\\chi(C_n)\\). Therefore, the formula for \\(\\chi(G)\\) simplifies to:\n\\[ \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\]\n\n**4. Determine the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\(\\chi(C_n)\\))**\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) depends on the parity of its length \\( n \\). We must consider two cases, noting that a cycle requires \\( n \\ge 3 \\).\n\n*   **Case 1: \\( n \\) is even** (\\(n = 4, 6, 8, \\dots\\))\n    An even cycle is a bipartite graph. Its vertices can be colored using only two colors by alternating them around the cycle.\n    Therefore, for even \\( n \\), \\(\\chi(C_n) = 2\\).\n\n*   **Case 2: \\( n \\) is odd** (\\(n = 3, 5, 7, \\dots\\))\n    An odd cycle is not bipartite, so it requires at least three colors. A 3-coloring is always possible (e.g., for \\(v_1, \\dots, v_n\\), color \\(v_1, \\dots, v_{n-1}\\) with two alternating colors, and the final vertex \\(v_n\\) with a third color).\n    Therefore, for odd \\( n \\), \\(\\chi(C_n) = 3\\).\n\n**5. Calculate \\( \\chi(G) \\) for Both Cases**\n\nWe can now calculate the chromatic number of \\( G \\) for both even and odd \\( n \\).\n\n*   **If \\( n \\) is even:**\n    \\[ \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\]\n\n*   **If \\( n \\) is odd:**\n    \\[ \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\]\n\n**6. Find the Maximal Chromatic Number**\n\nThe question asks for the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\). We have found two possible values for \\(\\chi(G)\\): 6 (when \\( n \\) is even) and 9 (when \\( n \\) is odd). The maximum of these two values is 9.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Sum\":** The crucial first step is to interpret \"sum of graphs\" as the graph join operation. This interpretation is standard in contexts involving chromatic numbers due to the elegant additive formula.\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle:** Correctly identifying \\(\\chi(C_n)\\) as 2 for even \\(n\\) and 3 for odd \\(n\\) is fundamental to the calculation.\n3.  **Meaning of \"Maximal\":** The problem requires finding the highest possible value of \\(\\chi(G)\\) over all valid choices of \\(n\\). This necessitates comparing the outcomes for the different cases of \\(n\\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe maximal chromatic number is the largest value obtained from the analysis, which is 9. This value is achieved whenever \\( n \\) is an odd number (e.g., for \\(G = C_3 + C_3 + C_3\\)).\n\n<<<9>>>"
