    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group**: The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as `SD_512`. In general, a semidihedral group of order `2^n` is denoted `SD_{2^n}`. For our case, `2^n = 512`, so `n = 9`. Let's call this group `G`.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups**: A subgroup `H` of `G` is called a power subgroup if there is an integer `m` such that `H` is the subgroup generated by the `m`-th powers of all elements of `G`. This subgroup is denoted `G^m`.\n\n3.  **Identify Distinct Power Subgroups**: For a finite p-group (a group whose order is a power of a prime `p`), like `SD_{2^9}` (which is a 2-group), there is a powerful result: the set of all distinct power subgroups `G^m` is given by `{ G^d | d \\text{ divides the exponent of } G }`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Exponent**: The exponent of a group is the smallest integer `e > 0` such that `g^e = 1` for all elements `g` in the group. For the semidihedral group `SD_{2^n}`, the exponent is `2^(n-1)`. In our case (`n=9`), the exponent is `2^(9-1) = 2^8 = 256`.\n\n5.  **Count the Divisors**: The divisors of the exponent `256` are the powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^8`. These are `2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8`, which corresponds to `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256`. There are `8 - 0 + 1 = 9` such divisors.\n\n6.  **Verify Subgroups are Distinct**: Each of these divisors gives a power subgroup. We need to confirm they are all different:\n    *   `d = 2^0 = 1`: The subgroup is `G^1 = G`, which is `SD_512` itself. This is a non-cyclic group of order 512.\n    *   `d = 2^k` for `k = 1, ..., 8`: It can be shown that for `k > 0`, the subgroup `G^(2^k)` is a cyclic subgroup of order `2^(8-k)`.\n        *   For `k=1`, we get a cyclic subgroup of order `2^7=128`.\n        *   For `k=2`, we get a cyclic subgroup of order `2^6=64`.\n        *   ...\n        *   For `k=8`, we get a cyclic subgroup of order `2^0=1` (the trivial subgroup).\n    *   Since `G` is not cyclic, and the other 8 subgroups are cyclic groups of different orders, all 9 subgroups are distinct.\n\nThus, there are 9 power subgroups in total. The following code calculates and prints this result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n}, the size is 2^n.\n    # We find n such that 2^n = group_size.\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n}, which is a 2-group, the number of\n    # distinct power subgroups is equal to n.\n    # This is because the distinct power subgroups are G^d where d divides\n    # the exponent of the group, exp(G) = 2^(n-1).\n    # The divisors of 2^(n-1) are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^(n-1).\n    # There are (n-1) - 0 + 1 = n such divisors.\n    \n    num_power_subgroups = n\n\n    # The subgroups are G^(2^k) for k = 0 to n-1.\n    # For k=0, the subgroup is G itself (SD_512).\n    # For k>0, the subgroups are cyclic of decreasing orders.\n    # So there is 1 non-cyclic subgroup and n-1 cyclic ones.\n    \n    num_cyclic_subgroups = n - 1\n    num_non_cyclic_subgroups = 1\n    \n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_size} is denoted SD_{{2^{n}}}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of power subgroups is equal to n, which is {n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis count is composed of:\")\n    print(f\"- {num_non_cyclic_subgroups} subgroup that is the group G itself.\")\n    print(f\"- {num_cyclic_subgroups} subgroups that are cyclic subgroups of G.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final count is derived from the following equation:\")\n    print(f\"{num_non_cyclic_subgroups} + {num_cyclic_subgroups} = {num_power_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"
