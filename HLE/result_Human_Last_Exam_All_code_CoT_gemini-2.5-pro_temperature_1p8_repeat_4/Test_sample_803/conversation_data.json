    "This is a problem from abstract algebra, specifically the theory of finite groups. To solve it, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request**: I need to identify the nonabelian \"filled\" groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number. The key terms are \"filled group,\" \"nonabelian group,\" and the specific group order. The answer should be presented as Python code that helps describe these groups.\n\n2.  **Theoretical Foundation**: The problem requires knowledge of group theory literature. The definition of a \"filled group\" is specialized. A group G is filled if every maximal product-free set S in G satisfies `G = S ∪ S² ∪ {e}`. Instead of deriving the result from first principles, I will rely on the known classification theorems for such groups. The key result, established in papers like \"On filled groups\" by dos Santos and Silva, provides a full characterization:\n    *A finite group G is filled if and only if G is an elementary abelian 2-group, or G is a generalized dihedral group over an abelian group of odd order.*\n\n3.  **Apply the Theorem to the Specific Case**:\n    *   The group order is `2q^m`. Since `q` is an odd prime, the order is not a power of 2. Thus, the group cannot be an elementary abelian 2-group (unless `q^m = 1`, which would make the group abelian).\n    *   This leaves the second case: the group `G` must be a \"generalized dihedral group over an abelian group of odd order\".\n    *   Let's check if this fits our parameters. A generalized dihedral group is of the form `G = A ⋊ H`, where `A` is an abelian normal subgroup, `H` is a Sylow 2-subgroup, and the action of any non-identity element `h ∈ H` on `A` is inversion (`a^h = a⁻¹`).\n    *   In our case, the group `G` of order `2q^m` has a Sylow q-subgroup of order `q^m` (let's call it `A`) and a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2 (isomorphic to `C₂`). The order of `A` is odd. The characterization theorem requires `A` to be abelian.\n    *   So, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` must be of the form `G = A ⋊ C₂`, where `A` is an **abelian group of order q^m** and the action is inversion. Such a group is always nonabelian (unless A is trivial).\n\n4.  **Structure of the Abelian Component `A`**: An abelian group of prime-power order `q^m` has a well-known structure. It is a direct product of cyclic groups: `A = C_{q^{k₁}} × C_{q^{k₂}} × ... × C_{q^{kᵣ}}`, where `k₁ + k₂ + ... + kᵣ = m` is a partition of the integer `m`. Each distinct partition of `m` corresponds to a unique (up to isomorphism) abelian group of order `q^m`.\n\n5.  **Develop a Python Script**: The task requires providing a script. I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Takes an integer `m` as input.\n    *   Generates all unique integer partitions of `m`.\n    *   For each partition, it constructs and prints a description of the corresponding abelian group `A` and the final nonabelian filled group `G`. This will fulfill the request to \"output each number in the final equation\" by showing the partition sum and the resulting group structure formula.\n\nThis plan systematically addresses the user's question by combining mathematical theory with a computational script that illustrates the results of that theory.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_partitions(m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all unique partitions of an integer m.\n    A partition is a way of writing m as a sum of positive integers.\n    For example, partitions of 4 are: [4], [3, 1], [2, 2], [2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1].\n    This function uses a known concise generator algorithm and returns a list\n    of unique partitions, sorted canonically.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using a set to store partitions ensures uniqueness after sorting.\n    partitions_set = set()\n\n    # The recursive generator for partitions.\n    # From a StackOverflow post, attributed to John M.
