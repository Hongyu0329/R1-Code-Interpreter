    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The core of the problem is to evaluate the definite integral `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\n2.  **Use the Logarithmic Derivative Rule**: Recognize that the integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is the derivative of `ln|F₃(x)|`. This is a standard result from calculus, where `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx = ln|f(x)| + C`.\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1, which equals `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n4.  **Calculate F₃(x) at the limits**:\n    *   First, we determine the expression for `F₃(x)`:\n        *   `F₀(x) = x`\n        *   `F₁(x) = sin(x)`\n        *   `F₂(x) = e^(sin(x))`\n        *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n    *   Next, calculate `F₃(0)`:\n        *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(2)`\n    *   Then, calculate `F₃(1)`:\n        *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n5.  **Check for Absolute Value**: We need to determine if `F₃(x)` is positive over the interval [0, 1] to see if the absolute value is necessary. For `x` in [0, 1], `sin(x) ≥ 0`, so `e^(sin(x)) ≥ 1`, and `1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 2`. The natural logarithm of a number greater than or equal to 2 is always positive, so `F₃(x) > 0` on [0, 1]. We can safely drop the absolute value signs.\n6.  **Calculate the Value V**: The value of the integral is `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n7.  **Final Calculation**: Compute `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer.\n8.  **Implement in Python**: Write a Python script to perform these calculations using the `math` module for `sin`, `exp`, and `log`. The script will print the values of `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` as they are the numbers in the final equation for the integral, and then it will compute and print the final required integer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the function F_3(x)\n# F_3(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n# Step 2: The definite integral V = ∫ (F_3'(x)/F_3(x)) dx from 0 to 1\n# is given by ln(F_3(1)) - ln(F_3(0)).\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the values of F_3(0) and F_3(1).\n# These are the numbers in the final equation for the integral's value.\n# F_3(0) = ln(1 + e^sin(0)) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(2)\nf3_at_0 = math.log(2)\n\n# F_3(1) = ln(1 + e^sin(1))\n# Note: math.sin() takes the angle in radians.\nf3_at_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n\nprint(f\"The equation for the integral V is: ln(F_3(1)) - ln(F_3(0))\")\nprint(f\"Value of F_3(1): {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"Value of F_3(0): {f3_at_0}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the value of the integral V\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\nprint(f\"Value of V: {V}\")\n\n# Step 5: Calculate 10000 * V and find the closest integer\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\n\nprint(f\"The result of 10000 * V is: {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {closest_integer}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<{}>>>\".format(closest_integer))\n```"
