    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set, we first need to determine the number of functions for each atom type.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecule (C7H8):**\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n2.  **Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set:**\n    *   This is a split-valence basis set.\n    *   **For a Carbon atom (C):**\n        *   **Core (1s orbital):** The '6' means the core 1s orbital is represented by **1** contracted function (composed of 6 primitive Gaussians).\n        *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The '31' split applies here.\n            *   Each valence orbital is represented by two basis functions. One is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian.\n            *   This gives 2 functions for the 2s orbital and 2 functions for each of the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n            *   Total functions for C = 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 2 * 3 (for 2p) = 1 + 2 + 6 = **9 basis functions**.\n    *   **For a Hydrogen atom (H):**\n        *   Hydrogen only has a valence 1s orbital and no core electrons.\n        *   **Valence (1s orbital):** The '31' split applies.\n            *   The 1s orbital is represented by two basis functions: one contraction of 3 primitives and one single primitive.\n            *   Total functions for H = **2 basis functions**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total:**\n    *   Total Functions = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n    *   Total Functions = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2) = 63 + 16 = 79\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 core (1s) + 2 valence (2s) + 3*2 valence (2p) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 2 valence (1s)\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate contributions from each element\ntotal_carbon_functions = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_hydrogen_functions = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total number of basis functions\ntotal_functions = total_carbon_functions + total_hydrogen_functions\n\n# Print the detailed calculation and the final answer\nprint(\"Calculation for toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {num_carbon_atoms}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {num_hydrogen_atoms}\")\nprint(f\"Basis functions per Carbon atom: {functions_per_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Basis functions per Hydrogen atom: {functions_per_hydrogen}\")\nprint(\"\\nTotal contracted Gaussian functions = (C atoms * functions/C) + (H atoms * functions/H)\")\nprint(f\"Total = ({num_carbon_atoms} * {functions_per_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} * {functions_per_hydrogen})\")\nprint(f\"Total = {total_carbon_functions} + {total_hydrogen_functions}\")\nprint(f\"Total = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
