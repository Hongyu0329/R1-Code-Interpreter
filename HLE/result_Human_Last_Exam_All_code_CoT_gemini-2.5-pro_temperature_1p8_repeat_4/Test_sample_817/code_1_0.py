    # Statement A Analysis: It is an interactor of the actin assembly factor ADF3.
    # Research shows HR4's primary interactors are resistance proteins like RPW8.2, not actin factors.
    # This statement is likely false.
    print("Analyzing Statement A: Is HR4 an interactor of ADF3?")
    print("Conclusion: False. The primary and well-documented interactor of HR4 is the resistance protein RPW8.2, not ADF3.\n")

    # Statement B Analysis: It contributes to the defense against the broad spectrum of powdery mildew pathogens.
    # HR4 is part of the RPW8 resistance protein complex, which is famous for conferring broad-spectrum
    # resistance to most isolates of powdery mildew.
    # This statement is true, but it describes the outcome rather than the specific mechanism.
    print("Analyzing Statement B: Does HR4 contribute to defense against powdery mildew?")
    print("Conclusion: True. HR4 is essential for RPW8.2-mediated broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew pathogens.\n")

    # Statement C Analysis: It is targeted to the Extrahaustorial membrane during infection by the powdery mildew pathogen.
    # The Extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) is a specialized plant membrane that surrounds the fungal feeding structure (haustorium).
    # Research papers (e.g., Wang et al., 2021) have demonstrated that for the resistance protein RPW8.2 to function,
    # it must be targeted to the EHM. HR4, a lipase, is required for this targeting and is also itself localized at the EHM.
    # This describes the specific molecular mechanism of HR4's function.
    print("Analyzing Statement C: Is HR4 targeted to the Extrahaustorial membrane (EHM)?")
    print("Conclusion: True. HR4 is a GDSL lipase that localizes to the EHM and is required to target the resistance protein RPW8.2 to the same location, which is critical for its function.\n")

    # Statement D Analysis: It regulates the defense modulator PAD4 in plant defense against the Psm.
    # The pathway HR4 is in (RPW8) requires PAD4 to function properly, but there is no evidence
    # that HR4 directly regulates PAD4. The regulation is downstream or in a parallel branch, not direct.
    print("Analyzing Statement D: Does HR4 regulate PAD4?")
    print("Conclusion: False. The RPW8/HR4 resistance pathway is dependent on PAD4, but HR4 does not regulate PAD4.\n")
    
    # Statement E Analysis: HR4 is one of the interactors of the PAD4.
    # Similar to D, there is no strong evidence for a direct physical interaction between HR4 and PAD4.
    # The primary interaction is between HR4 and RPW8.2.
    print("Analyzing Statement E: Does HR4 interact with PAD4?")
    print("Conclusion: False. There is no evidence of a direct protein-protein interaction between HR4 and PAD4.\n")

    # Final Decision
    # Both B and C are factually correct. However, C describes the specific, crucial molecular mechanism
    # (subcellular localization to the site of action) by which B (the overall phenotype of resistance) is achieved.
    # In molecular biology, a statement describing the mechanism is generally considered a more precise and fundamental truth.
    print("--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("Statement C provides the most precise and mechanistic description of HR4's function.")
    print("The protein's localization to the Extrahaustorial membrane is the key step that allows it to contribute to powdery mildew resistance.")
