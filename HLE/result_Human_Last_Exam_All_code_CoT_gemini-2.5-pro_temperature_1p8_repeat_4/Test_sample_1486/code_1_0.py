# Plan:
# 1. Identify the number of cabrioles performed in the first sequence.
# 2. Identify the number of cabrioles performed in the second sequence.
# 3. Sum these two counts to find the total.
# 4. Print the final equation and the total number.

# In her famous diagonal, Maria Khoreva executes a set of cabrioles on one side.
first_set = 4

# She then repeats the sequence on the other side.
second_set = 4

# Calculate the total.
total_cabrioles = first_set + second_set

# Print the breakdown and the final equation.
print(f"Maria Khoreva executed {first_set} cabrioles in the first set and {second_set} in the second set.")
print("The total number of cabrioles is calculated as:")
print(f"{first_set} + {second_set} = {total_cabrioles}")
