def find_species_with_reduced_pterostigmata():
    """
    Analyzes a list of dragonfly species to identify which is most likely
    to have a reduced pterostigma based on its flight ecology.

    The pterostigma is an aerodynamic feature that prevents wing flutter at high
    speeds and during gliding. Species that are powerful fliers and long-distance
    migrants (e.g., Pantala flavescens, Macrodiplax balteata, Sympetrum corruptum)
    require a well-developed pterostigma.

    Species that are weak, fluttering fliers with no migratory behavior have less
    need for this adaptation. Among the given list, Celithemis elisa fits this
    profile best.

    This code will find the index of 'Celithemis elisa' in the list.
