    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will follow a step-by-step process of analyzing the connectivity of the spaces involved and the properties of the map.\n\n### Plan\n1.  Define the source space $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target space $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n2.  Calculate the connectivity of the constituent spaces. The connectivity of a space $X$, denoted $\\text{conn}(X)$, is the largest integer $k$ such that $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i \\leq k$.\n    *   For a sphere $S^n$, it is $(n-1)$-connected.\n    *   For a loop space $\\Omega X$, we have $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(X)$. This implies that $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^n) = n-2$.\n    *   For a smash product $X \\wedge Y$, if $X$ is $k_X$-connected and $Y$ is $k_Y$-connected, then $X \\wedge Y$ is $(k_X + k_Y + 1)$-connected.\n    *   For a suspension $\\Sigma X$, $\\text{conn}(\\Sigma X) = \\text{conn}(X) + 1$.\n3.  Determine the connectivity of the map's adjoint, $\\tilde{f}: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. The connectivity of $\\tilde{f}$ tells us about the connectivity of its homotopy fiber, $F_{\\tilde{f}}$.\n4.  Relate the connectivity of the fiber of $f$, $F_f$, to the connectivity of the fiber of its adjoint, $F_{\\tilde{f}}$. There is a standard result that states $\\text{conn}(F_f) = \\text{conn}(F_{\\tilde{f}}) + 1$.\n5.  Finally, the connectivity of the map $f$ is given by $\\text{conn}(f) = \\text{conn}(F_f) + 1$.\n6.  We will use the fact that the first non-trivial homotopy groups of the source and target of $\\tilde{f}$ are isomorphic, and the map $\\tilde{f}$ induces an isomorphism between them.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define connectivity calculation rules\n    # conn(S^n) = n-1\n    # conn(Omega S^n) = n-2\n    # conn(X wedge Y) = conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1\n    # conn(Sigma X) = conn(X) + 1\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate connectivity of the spaces in the source of f\n    \n    # Connectivity of Omega S^4\n    n_4 = 4\n    conn_Omega_S4 = n_4 - 2\n    print(f\"The loop space Omega S^4 is ({n_4}-2) = {conn_Omega_S4}-connected.\")\n\n    # Connectivity of Omega S^6\n    n_6 = 6\n    conn_Omega_S6 = n_6 - 2\n    print(f\"The loop space Omega S^6 is ({n_6}-2) = {conn_Omega_S6}-connected.\")\n    \n    # Connectivity of the smash product\n    conn_smash = conn_Omega_S4 + conn_Omega_S6 + 1\n    print(f\"The smash product Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6 is ({conn_Omega_S4} + {conn_Omega_S6} + 1) = {conn_smash}-connected.\")\n\n    # Connectivity of the source space A = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6)\n    conn_A = conn_smash + 1\n    print(f\"The source space A = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) is ({conn_smash} + 1) = {conn_A}-connected.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Analyze the adjoint map f_tilde and its fiber\n    # The map is f: A -> B.
