    "To determine the number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables required to parametrize the specified sigma-model, we need to identify the correct mathematical structure and calculate the dimension of its bosonic sector.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model:** The problem specifies a supersymmetric sigma-model for symmetry class D with `N=2` replicas. In the framework of random matrix theory and the \"ten-fold way\" classification, the sigma-model for class D (also known as the chiral orthogonal class) is described by fields on a Riemannian symmetric superspace.\n2.  **Identify the Symmetric Superspace:** For the 0D version of this model, the appropriate superspace is the coset space `G/H`, where:\n    *   The supergroup `G` is `OSp(2N|2N)`.\n    *   The subgroup `H` is `U(N|N)`.\n    *   `N` is the number of replicas, which is given as 2.\n3.  **Determine the Dimension of the Bosonic Sector:** The number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables corresponds to the dimension of the bosonic part of this coset space. This is calculated as the difference between the dimensions of the maximal bosonic subgroups of `G` and `H`, denoted `G_B` and `H_B` respectively.\n    *   Dimension = `dim(G_B) - dim(H_B)`.\n4.  **Calculate `dim(G_B)`:**\n    *   The maximal bosonic subgroup `G_B` of `G = OSp(2N|2N)` is `O(2N) x Sp(2N)`.\n    *   The dimension is `dim(G_B) = dim(O(2N)) + dim(Sp(2N))`.\n    *   Using the standard formulas `dim(O(k)) = k(k-1)/2` and `dim(Sp(2k)) = k(2k+1)`, we get `dim(G_B) = N(2N-1) + N(2N+1) = 4N^2`.\n5.  **Calculate `dim(H_B)`:**\n    *   The maximal bosonic subgroup `H_B` of `H = U(N|N)` is `U(N) x U(N)`.\n    *   The dimension is `dim(H_B) = dim(U(N)) + dim(U(N))`.\n    *   Using the formula `dim(U(k)) = k^2`, we get `dim(H_B) = N^2 + N^2 = 2N^2`.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Result:**\n    *   The total number of bosonic variables is `dim(G_B) - dim(H_B) = 4N^2 - 2N^2 = 2N^2`.\n7.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will be provided to perform these calculations for `N=2` and print out each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Number of replicas\nN = 2\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the dimension of the bosonic part of the supergroup G = OSp(2N|2N) ---\n# The maximal bosonic subgroup is G_B = O(2N) x Sp(2N)\n# dim(O(k)) = k * (k-1) / 2\n# dim(Sp(2k)) = k * (2k + 1)\ndim_O_2N = N * (2 * N - 1)\ndim_Sp_2N = N * (2 * N + 1)\ndim_G_B = dim_O_2N + dim_Sp_2N\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the dimension of the bosonic part of the subgroup H = U(N|N) ---\n# The maximal bosonic subgroup is H_B = U(N) x U(N)\n# dim(U(k)) = k^2\ndim_U_N = N**2\ndim_H_B = dim_U_N + dim_U_N\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the final result ---\n# The number of bosonic variables is dim(G_B) - dim(H_B)\nnum_bosonic_variables = dim_G_B - dim_H_B\n\n# --- Step 4: Print the calculation step-by-step ---\nprint(f\"The calculation for N = {N} replicas in symmetry class D (OSp(2N|2N) / U(N|N) model):\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\nprint(\"1.
