    Analyzes historical statements about the Duke of Wellington's career to identify the correct ones.

    innovations from Wellington's time in India (1797-1805) to his later career
    and broader British imperial practice.

    # Rationale for selecting the correct options:
    # Option 1: Correct. Wellington's logistical systems (commissariat) developed to handle the vast
    # distances and difficult terrain in India were a direct and well-documented precursor to the
    # successful logistical arrangements of the Peninsular Campaign. Historians confirm the
    # principles were transferred and significantly improved supply efficiency.
    #
    # Option 6: Correct. The British model of empire-building heavily relied on local auxiliary
    # forces led by British officers. Wellington's successful integration and command of Indian
    # sepoys and allied local forces was a key early example of this practice, which became
    # a standard template for colonial expansion across the globe in the following decades.
    #
    # Option 8: Correct. The use of fast-moving, self-sufficient "flying columns" was a tactic
    # Wellington perfected in India to pursue mobile enemies like the Marathas. This tactical
    # innovation was adapted for use in the Peninsular War and is documented as being
    # employed in subsequent colonial conflicts, such as the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824-1826),
    # where such units were essential.
