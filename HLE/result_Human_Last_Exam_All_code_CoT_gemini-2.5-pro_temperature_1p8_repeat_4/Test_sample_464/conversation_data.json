    "Yes, if $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a Schwartz class function such that all its moments are zero, it does follow that $f=0$.\n\n### Step-by-step explanation:\n\nThe proof relies on the properties of the Fourier transform. The core strategy is to show that if all the moments of a function $f(x)$ are zero, then its Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, must be the zero function. Since the Fourier transform is an invertible operation, if $\\hat{f}$ is zero, then the original function $f$ must also be zero.\n\nHere are the detailed steps of the argument:\n\n1.  **The Fourier Transform and its Derivatives:**\n    Let $f \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ be a Schwartz function. Its Fourier transform is defined as:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\n    Since $f$ is a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function, which means it is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$). We can compute the derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ by differentiating under the integral sign:\n    $$ \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} (e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\n\n2.  **Relating Derivatives to Moments:**\n    The condition given in the problem is that all the moments of $f$ are zero. The $k$-th moment of $f$ is $M_k = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx$. We are given $M_k = 0$ for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$.\n\n    Let's evaluate the $k$-th derivative of the Fourier transform at the point $\\xi=0$:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\left[ \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\hat{f}(\\xi) \\right]_{\\xi=0} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k dx $$\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx = (-2\\pi i)^k M_k $$\n\n3.  **All Derivatives at Zero are Zero:**\n    Using the given condition that $M_k = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$, we find:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0 $$\n    This means that the function $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ and all of its derivatives are zero at $\\xi=0$.\n\n4.  **A Function with All-Zero Derivatives at a Point is Zero Everywhere:**\n    A key property of functions whose Fourier transforms are Schwartz functions (like $\\hat{f}$ here) is that they are analytic. An analytic function is one that is locally given by its Taylor series. The Taylor series for $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around $\\xi=0$ is:\n    $$ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k $$\n    Since we have shown that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k$, all coefficients of the Taylor series are zero. For an analytic function, this implies that the function itself must be identically zero, i.e., $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion from the Inverse Fourier Transform:**\n    Finally, since the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is identically zero, we can find the original function $f(x)$ by using the inverse Fourier transform:\n    $$ f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} d\\xi = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 0 \\cdot e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} d\\xi = 0 $$\n    Therefore, the function $f(x)$ must be the zero function.\n\n### Code Demonstration\n\nTo make the key step of the proof (Step 2) more concrete, the following Python code uses the `sympy` library to symbolically demonstrate the relationship between the moments of a function and the derivatives of its Fourier transform. We use the Gaussian function $f(x) = e^{-\\pi x^2}$ as a specific example of a Schwartz function.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef demonstrate_moment_fourier_relation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the mathematical relationship at the heart of the proof.\n    It shows that the k-th derivative of the Fourier Transform of a function f(x)\n    at xi=0 is proportional to the k-th moment of f(x).
