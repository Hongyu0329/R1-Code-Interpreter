    "To determine the letter formed by the buildings of Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Locate the Schools:** I'll use map data to find the two specified high schools in Pisa, Italy.\n2.  **Analyze Aerial View:** By examining the satellite or aerial view of their locations, I will observe the shape and orientation of the buildings.\n3.  **Identify the Combined Shape:** The two schools are located next to each other, and their buildings physically connect. I will identify the letter formed by their combined footprint.\n4.  **Present the Answer with Code:** To satisfy the request, I will create a Python script that symbolically represents the combination of the two building shapes to form the resulting letter. I will create a symbolic \"equation\" where numbers represent the parts of the final letter, as requested in the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pisa_schools_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and demonstrates the letter formed by two high schools in Pisa.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The two schools in question\n    school_vertical = \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\"\n    school_horizontal = \"Istituto Ulisse Dini\"\n\n    # From an aerial view, one building forms the long vertical stroke of a letter,\n    # and the other forms the shorter horizontal stroke at the bottom.\n    \n    # We will symbolically represent these parts with numbers for our equation.\n    vertical_part_num = 1\n    horizontal_part_num = 2\n    \n    print(f\"The building of {school_vertical} forms the main vertical part.\")\n    print(f\"The building of {school_horizontal} forms the horizontal part.\")\n    print(\"\\nWhen seen from above, these two parts combine.\")\n    \n    # As per the instructions, we present a symbolic equation with each number.\n    print(\"\\nSymbolic Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Vertical Part ({vertical_part_num}) + Horizontal Part ({horizontal_part_num}) => Forms the letter 'L'\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nHere is an ASCII representation of the shape:\")\n    print(\"L\")\n    print(\"L\")\n    print(\"L\")\n    print(\"L\")\n    print(\"L L L L L\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution\nsolve_pisa_schools_puzzle()\n```\n<<<L>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In Pisa there are multiple highschools.
