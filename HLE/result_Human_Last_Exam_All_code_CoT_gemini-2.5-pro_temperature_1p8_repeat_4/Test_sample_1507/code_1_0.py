    Calculates the number of triangles on the convex hull of a great icosahedron.

    The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.
    The number of triangles needed for the triangulation is the number of faces

    V - E + F = 2, where V, E, and F are the number of vertices, edges, and faces.
