    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of triangles on the surface of the convex hull of a great icosahedron. Here is the plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Convex Hull:** The convex hull (or \"outer-hull\") of a great icosahedron has the same vertices as a regular icosahedron. Therefore, its shape is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Understand the Goal:** The task of \"triangulating the outer-hull\" means finding the number of triangles that form the surface of this regular icosahedron. Since the faces of a regular icosahedron are already triangles, the problem simplifies to finding the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\n3.  **Use Euler's Polyhedron Formula:** We can calculate the number of faces (F) using Euler's formula: `V - E + F = 2`, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.\n4.  **Calculate Vertices and Edges:**\n    *   A great icosahedron has 12 vertices (V = 12).\n    *   For a regular icosahedron, 5 edges meet at each vertex. Since each edge connects two vertices, we can calculate the total number of edges (E) as `(V * 5) / 2`.\n5.  **Calculate Faces:** With V and E known, we can rearrange Euler's formula to solve for F: `F = 2 - V + E`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_triangulation_of_great_icosahedron_hull():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of triangles on the convex hull of a great icosahedron.\n\n    The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n    The number of triangles needed for the triangulation is the number of faces\n    of this regular icosahedron.
