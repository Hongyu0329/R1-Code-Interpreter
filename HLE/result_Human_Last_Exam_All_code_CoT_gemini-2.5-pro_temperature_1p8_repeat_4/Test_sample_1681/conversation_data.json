    "Answering this question involves concepts from quantum game theory. Here's a step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Understand the Classical Game:** First, we identify the payoffs from the given matrix for the classical Prisoner's Dilemma. The Nash Equilibrium in the classical game is (Defect, Defect), yielding a payoff of (1, 1) for each player, which is suboptimal.\n\n2.  **Introduce the Quantum Model:** We'll use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol for quantum games. In this model, players' strategies are quantum operations (unitary matrices) acting on a shared entangled initial state. The initial state `|ψ_initial⟩` is created by an entangling operator `J(γ)` acting on the state `|Cooperate, Cooperate⟩`, where `γ` controls the degree of entanglement.\n\n3.  **Optimal Initial State Design:** The problem states we can \"design the initial states for an optimal\" outcome. This means we can choose the entanglement level `γ`. The most common and interesting case is maximum entanglement (`γ = π/2`), which we will use.\n\n4.  **Quantum Strategies:** In addition to the classical strategies Cooperate (`C`) and Defect (`D`), players gain access to a continuous space of quantum strategies. A famous quantum strategy is the \"miracle\" move `Q`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Quantum Payoff Matrix:** With the initial state set (maximally entangled), we calculate the expected payoffs for each player when they play combinations of the strategies `C`, `D`, and `Q`. This results in a new 3x3 payoff matrix for the quantum version of the game.\n\n6.  **Find the New Equilibrium:** We analyze the new payoff matrix to find its Nash Equilibrium. It turns out that for the given payoffs and maximal entanglement, the game transforms into a \"Game of Chicken.\" This game has two pure-strategy equilibria `(Cooperate, Defect)` and `(Defect, Cooperate)` and one mixed-strategy equilibrium where each player randomizes their choice. The stable solution is the mixed-strategy equilibrium.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Equilibrium Payoff:** We will calculate the probability with which each player chooses their strategy in the mixed-strategy equilibrium. Then, we calculate the expected payoff for a player at this equilibrium point. This payoff value represents the solution.\n\nThe Python code below implements the final steps of this plan, calculating the mixed-strategy equilibrium and the resulting expected payoff.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the equilibrium point of a quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n    The classical payoff matrix is:\n    [[(5,5) , (0,7)],  (C,C), (C,D)\n     [(7,0) , (1,1)]]  (D,C), (D,D)\n\n    When played in a quantum space with maximal entanglement (using the EWL protocol),\n    the game transforms into a different game.
