# A detailed analysis shows that segmented numbers are powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).
# The nth segmented number corresponds to the (n-1)th power of 2.
# We are asked to find the 50th segmented number.

# The position in the sequence
n = 50

# The formula for the nth term is 2^(n-1)
base = 2
exponent = n - 1

# Calculate the final value
result = base ** exponent

# The problem requires printing the numbers in the final equation.
# The final equation is: base ^ exponent = result
print(f"The 50th segmented number is found from the equation:")
print(f"{base} ^ {exponent} = {result}")
