Plan: To find the inherent limitation of bulk melting experiments, we need to distinguish between experimental limitations and modeling assumptions.

1.  **Analyze the experimental method**: A bulk experiment (calorimetry, UV melting) measures the average property (e.g., heat absorption, UV absorbance) of a massive population of molecules. It yields a single melting curve for the entire sample.

2.  **Evaluate the options**:
    *   **A. Heat capacity change is assumed to be zero** and **B. The NNBP parameters are T-independent**: These are simplifying assumptions often made in the *mathematical model* used to analyze the experimental data. They are not inherent limitations of the *experiment itself*. More sophisticated models can be used to analyze the same data without these assumptions.
    *   **E. Temperature cannot be controlled**: This is false. Precise temperature control is a fundamental requirement and capability of these experiments.
    *   **D. Temperature oscillations are too large**: This is an issue of instrumental precision, not a fundamental limitation. Modern instruments have excellent temperature stability.
    *   **C. Impossibility to capture heterogeneity in bulk experiments**: This is the correct answer. A bulk measurement averages the signal from every molecule in the sample. If the sample is heterogeneous (e.g., contains a mix of perfectly formed duplexes, misfolded structures, and aggregates), the experiment cannot distinguish these subpopulations. It will only report a single, average melting transition that smears out all the underlying molecular complexity. This loss of information about molecular-level differences is an *inherent* limitation of any bulk ensemble measurement.

3.  **Conclusion**: The inability to resolve the behavior of individual molecules and see the true distribution of molecular states (heterogeneity) is the most significant and fundamental limitation of bulk melting experiments.
