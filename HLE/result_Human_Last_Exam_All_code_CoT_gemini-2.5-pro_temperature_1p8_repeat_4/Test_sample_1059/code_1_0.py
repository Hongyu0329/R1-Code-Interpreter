def solve_closepact_sets():
    """
    This function determines which of the given sets are necessarily "closepact".
    
    As explained in the detailed steps, a subset of R or C is closepact if and only if
    it is compact, which in turn is equivalent to being closed and bounded. This function
    identifies the choices that satisfy this criterion.
    
    A. The set of real numbers (Not bounded)
    B. The set of integers (Not bounded)
    C. A finite subset of the complex numbers (Closed and bounded)
    D. The set of all 1/n where n is a nonzero integer (Not closed)
    E. The set containing a Cauchy sequence in the rationals (Not necessarily closed)
    F. The set containing a bounded monotonic sequence in the real numbers (Not necessarily closed)
    G. The set containing a bounded monotonic sequence and its limit point (Closed and bounded)
    H. The set containing a positive real sequence and its limit point (Closed and bounded)
    I. An open interval in the reals (Not closed)
    J. A closed interval in the reals (Closed and bounded)
    K. A bounded measurable subset of the real numbers (Not necessarily closed)
    L. A bounded non-measurable subset of the real numbers (Not closed)
    M. The Cantor Set (Closed and bounded)
    
    The final answer is a string concatenating the letters of the correct choices.
