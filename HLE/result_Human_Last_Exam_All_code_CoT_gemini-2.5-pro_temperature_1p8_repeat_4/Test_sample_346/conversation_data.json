    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to find the value of `log_2(n)`, where `n` is an integer represented by a complex SKI combinator expression.\n\n2.  **Decode the Expression:** The expression is given in SKI combinator logic.\n    *   `S`, `K`, and `I` are the basic combinators with the following reduction rules:\n        *   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n        *   `K x y = x`\n        *   `I x = x`\n    *   The given expression represents a \"Church numeral\". A Church numeral `n` is a function that takes another function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x` a total of `n` times: `n(f)(x) = f(f(...f(x)...))`.\n\n3.  **Strategy for Evaluation:** Instead of simplifying this complex expression by hand (which is tedious and error-prone), I will use Python's functional capabilities to execute it directly.\n    *   I will define the `S`, `K`, and `I` combinators as Python `lambda` functions.\n    *   I will construct the entire combinator expression by nesting these Python functions, creating a single callable object that represents the Church numeral `n`.\n    *   To find the integer value of `n`, I will apply this callable object to a simple counting function and a starting value. A standard choice is `f = lambda x: x + 1` and `x = 0`. The result of `n(f)(0)` will be `f` applied `n` times to `0`, which evaluates to the integer `n`.\n    *   Once `n` is found, I will use Python's `math` library to compute `log_2(n)`.\n\n4.  **Final Output:** The script will print the determined value of `n` and the final equation `log_2(n) = result`, showing all the numbers involved as requested.\n\nThis approach leverages computation to find the value of `n` without needing to perform the complex symbolic reduction manually.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\n# Set a higher recursion limit for safety, as combinator logic can involve deep recursion.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n# Define the basic SKI combinators as Python lambda functions.\nS = lambda x: lambda y: lambda z: x(z)(y(z))\nK = lambda x: lambda y: x\nI = lambda x: x\n\n# The given SKI combinator expression represents a Church numeral n.\n# We build it by directly translating the expression into nested function calls in Python.\n# Expression: S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))\n\nchurch_numeral_n = S(I)(\n    S(I)(\n        S(I)(\n            K(\n                S(S(K(S))(K))(I)\n            )\n            (\n                S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))\n            )\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n# A Church numeral n is a function that applies a given function f, n times to a value x.\n# To find the integer value of n, we can apply it to a successor function (lambda i: i + 1)\n# and a starting value (0). The result will be n.\nsuccessor_function = lambda x: x + 1\nstarting_value = 0\n\nn = church_numeral_n(successor_function)(starting_value)\n\n# Now, we calculate log_2(n) as requested.\nresult = math.log2(n)\n\n# Print the determined value of n and the final equation.\nprint(f\"The SKI expression evaluates to the Church numeral n = {n}.\")\nprint(f\"The final equation is: log_2({int(n)}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<2.0>>>"
