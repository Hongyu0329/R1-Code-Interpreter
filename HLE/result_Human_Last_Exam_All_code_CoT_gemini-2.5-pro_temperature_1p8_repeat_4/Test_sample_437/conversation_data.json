    "To evaluate the integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle$ for a 1s Slater orbital, we'll assume the common case where both orbitals are the same, i.e., $i=j$. This integral represents the expectation value of the potential energy of an electron due to the attraction of the nucleus.\n\nHere is the plan for solving the problem:\n1.  **Define the 1s Slater Orbital ($\\phi_{1s}$)**: First, we will define the mathematical form of a normalized 1s Slater-type orbital (STO). The wavefunction for a 1s orbital is spherically symmetric and is given by $\\psi_{1s}(r) = (\\zeta^3/\\pi)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $\\zeta$ (zeta) is the orbital exponent, which determines the \"size\" of the orbital.\n\n2.  **Set up the Integral**: The expression $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle$ is the Dirac bra-ket notation for a quantum mechanical integral. We will translate this into its integral form: $\\int \\psi_{1s}^*(r) \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\psi_{1s}(r) d\\tau$. Since the wavefunction is real, the complex conjugate $\\psi_{1s}^*$ is the same as $\\psi_{1s}$. The volume element $d\\tau$ in spherical coordinates is $r^2 \\sin\\theta \\,dr \\,d\\theta \\,d\\phi$.\n\n3.  **Solve the Integral Analytically**: We will substitute the expressions for the wavefunction and the volume element into the integral. The integration will be performed over all space: $r$ from 0 to $\\infty$, $\\theta$ from 0 to $\\pi$, and $\\phi$ from 0 to $2\\pi$.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python**: A Python script will be provided to perform this calculation symbolically using the `sympy` library. This allows us to see the derivation and the final result in terms of the orbital exponent $\\zeta$, without needing a specific numerical value for it. The code will define all the components, compute the integral, and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef evaluate_slater_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically evaluates the integral <phi | 1/r | phi> for a \n    normalized 1s Slater-type orbital (STO).
