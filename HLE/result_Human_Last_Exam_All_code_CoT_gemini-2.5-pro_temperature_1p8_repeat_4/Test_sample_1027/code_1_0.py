    Computes the dimension of the homology of the group G in degree 31.
    
    The group G is a subgroup of Homeo_+ (R) generated by g and h. Based on the
    algebraic structure of G, there's a short exact sequence:
    1 -> G_c -> G -> Z^2 -> 1
    where G_c is the derived subgroup of G.
    
    A known theorem in the field states that for this type of group, G_c is
    acyclic with real coefficients. The Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence
    for this short exact sequence then implies that the homology of G is
    isomorphic to the homology of Z^2.
    
    H_k(G, R) is isomorphic to H_k(Z^2, R).
    
    The dimension of the k-th homology group of Z^n with real coefficients
    is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k).
    For this problem, we have n=2 (from Z^2) and k=31.
