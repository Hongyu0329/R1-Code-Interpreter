    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define Characteristic Polynomials**: The BDF4 method for solving $y' = f(t, y)$ can be written in a form that gives us two characteristic polynomials, $\\rho(s)$ and $\\sigma(s)$.\n2.  **Stability Boundary**: The boundary of the absolute stability region is given by the complex numbers $z(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n3.  **Find Extremal Angle**: The A($\\alpha$)-stability angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the point on the stability boundary where the argument $\\arg(z(\\theta))$ is extremal. This condition leads to a polynomial equation in $x = \\cos(\\theta)$.\n4.  **Solve for $\\cos(\\theta)$**: We will solve this polynomial equation to find the critical value(s) of $\\cos(\\theta)$.\n5.  **Calculate z**: Using the relevant value of $\\cos(\\theta)$, we find the corresponding complex number $z$ on the stability boundary.\n6.  **Determine $\\alpha$**: The angle $\\alpha$ is related to the argument of this complex number $z$. Specifically, if $\\phi = \\arg(z)$, then $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi$. This gives $\\tan(\\alpha) = -\\text{Im}(z) / \\text{Re}(z)$. We will compute this value and express $\\alpha$ using `arctan()`.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the exact A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the characteristic polynomials for BDF4.\n    # The BDF4 method is given by the formula:\n    # 25/12 * y_{n+4} - 4 * y_{n+3} + 3 * y_{n+2} - 4/3 * y_{n+1} + 1/4 * y_n = h * f_{n+4}\n    # To work with integer coefficients, we multiply by 12, leading to:\n    # 25*y_{n+4} - 48*y_{n+3} + 36*y_{n+2} - 16*y_{n+1} + 3*y_n = 12*h*f_{n+4}\n    # From this, we derive the characteristic polynomials rho(s) and sigma(s).\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n    rho = 25 * s**4 - 48 * s**3 + 36 * s**2 - 16 * s + 3\n    sigma = 12 * s**4\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: The characteristic polynomials for BDF4 are:\")\n    print(f\"rho(s) = {rho}\")\n    print(f\"sigma(s) = {sigma}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Formulate the equation for extremal angles.\n    # The condition for the argument of z(theta) to be extremal leads to a\n    # polynomial equation for x = cos(theta).
