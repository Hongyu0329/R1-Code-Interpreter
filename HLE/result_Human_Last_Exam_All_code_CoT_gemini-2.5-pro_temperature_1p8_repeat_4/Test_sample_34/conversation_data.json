    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button in the specified poker scenario.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I will establish the hierarchy of \"suited Jack\" (Jxs) hands. The strength of these hands is primarily determined by the rank of the second card (the \"kicker\"). A hand like AJs is the strongest, and the strength decreases as the kicker gets lower, down to J2s.\n2.  Next, I will consult standard GTO (Game Theory Optimal) pre-flop opening charts for the scenario described: a 100BB deep, rake-free cash game, opening from the button. The button is the most profitable position to open from, allowing for a very wide range of hands.\n3.  The \"worst\" hand to open is the one that is still considered a standard, profitable raise but has the lowest expected value among its peers.\n4.  I will write a Python script that codifies this logic. The script will define the ranked list of suited Jacks and identify the weakest one among them that is included in a standard button opening range for this game type.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button\n    in a 100BB rake-free NLH cash game based on GTO principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # In poker, suited Jack hands (Jxs) are ranked by their second card, or \"kicker\".\n    # A higher kicker is stronger. We can list them in order from best to worst.\n    suited_jacks_by_strength = [\n        \"AJs\", \"KJs\", \"QJs\", \"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\",\n        \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"\n    ]\n\n    # For the scenario (100BB, Rake-Free, Button Open), Game Theory Optimal (GTO)\n    # charts recommend opening a very wide range of hands (around 45-50%).\n    # This range is wide enough to include all of the suited Jack combinations\n    # due to their ability to make strong hands like flushes.\n\n    # The \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest expected value (EV) that\n    # is still considered a profitable raise. In this list, that is the very last hand.\n    worst_hand_in_range = suited_jacks_by_strength[-1]\n    \n    print(\"Analysis Steps:\")\n    print(\"1. All suited Jack hands are ranked by their kicker strength.\")\n    print(f\"   - The order from best to worst is: {', '.join(suited_jacks_by_strength)}\")\n    \n    print(\"2. A standard GTO opening range for the Button in a deep, rake-free game is consulted.\")\n    print(\"   - This range includes all the suited Jack hands listed above.\")\n\n    print(\"3. The 'worst' hand to open is the one at the bottom of this list which is still profitable.\")\n    print(\"\\nResult:\")\n    print(\"The worst suited jack you should open from the button is:\")\n    print(f\"-> {worst_hand_in_range}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
