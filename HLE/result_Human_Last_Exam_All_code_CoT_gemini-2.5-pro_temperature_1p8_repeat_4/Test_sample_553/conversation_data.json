    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the song.\n\nFirst, I need to decipher the music theory in your question. A \"tonic\" is the first chord of a key (the \"I\" chord). The \"fifth\" refers to the fifth note of the scale, and a chord built on it is typically a \"dominant\" chord (the \"V\" chord). A \"minor fifth chord\" is best interpreted as a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale (a \"v\" chord, lowercase 'v' denotes minor). This I -> v (or i -> v in a minor key) progression is less common than the standard I -> V, making it quite distinctive.\n\nMy plan is to scan my knowledge of The Beatles' discography for songs that begin with this specific harmonic movement. I am looking for a song that establishes a key and then immediately moves from its tonic chord to a minor chord on the fifth. This points strongly to the song \"Michelle\" from the album *Rubber Soul*.\n\nThe song is in the key of F. The iconic opening phrase, \"Michelle, ma belle,\" is sung over a chord change from Fm to Cm.\n*   **Fm:** This is the tonic chord, but in a minor mood (i).\n*   **Cm:** C is the fifth note of the F scale. A C minor chord is therefore the \"minor fifth chord\" (v).\n\nThis i -> v progression is precisely what gives the song its unique, sophisticated, and somewhat French-inspired sound. I will now generate the Python code to provide you with the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song that features an opening\n    chord progression from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n\n    The song is \"Michelle\".\n    Key: F (the intro/verse starts in F minor)\n    Progression:\n    - The song starts with an F minor chord (i), which acts as the tonic.\n    - It then moves to a C minor chord (v), which is the minor chord built on the fifth degree.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is: {song_title}\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
