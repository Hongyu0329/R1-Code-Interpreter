    """
    This function explains and provides the value for the Grassmann integral measure.

    In the path integral formalism for fermions, anticommuting Grassmann variables (eta) are used.
    Their defining algebraic property, eta**2 = 0, enforces the Pauli exclusion principle.

    Integration over these variables is defined by the Berezin rules.
    The fundamental normalization rule for the integral measure is:
    integral(d_eta * eta) = 1

    This script will print the components of this equation and the final value.
