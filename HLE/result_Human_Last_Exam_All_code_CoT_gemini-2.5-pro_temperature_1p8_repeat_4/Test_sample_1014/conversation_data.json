    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881:\n1.  First, I will create a function that performs prime factorization on a given number.\n2.  This function will start by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 to find all factors of 2.\n3.  Then, it will iterate through odd numbers, starting from 3, up to the square root of the remaining number. For each odd number that is a divisor, it will be added to our list of factors, and the original number will be divided by it.\n4.  If any number remains after the loop, that remaining number is also a prime factor.\n5.  After collecting all prime factors, I will print the complete factorization equation.\n6.  Finally, I will find the maximum value from the list of prime factors and print it as the largest prime divisor.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the prime factorization of a number,\n    prints the factorization equation, and then prints the largest prime divisor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Repeatedly divide by 2 to find all factors of 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n\n    # Iterate through odd numbers from 3 up to the square root of the remaining n\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n\n    # If the remaining n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n        \n    # Construct and print the factorization equation\n    equation_str = f\"{original_n} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n    print(equation_str)\n\n    # Find and print the largest prime divisor\n    if factors:\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {original_n} is {largest_prime}\")\n    else:\n        # This case handles if the number itself is prime\n        print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {original_n} is {original_n}\")\n\n# The number given by the user\nnumber_to_factor = 8139881\n\nsolve_largest_prime_divisor(number_to_factor)\n```\n<<<1091>>>"
