    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. After finding the equilibrium quantity (Qe) and price (Pe), the total welfare is calculated as the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Equations:** We have the supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` and the demand function `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`.\n2.  **Find Equilibrium:** We will find the equilibrium quantity, `Qe`, by numerically solving the equation `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`. Once `Qe` is found, the equilibrium price `Pe` can be calculated by substituting `Qe` into either function.\n3.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the area between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity. It can be calculated with the following formula:\n    `Total Welfare = ∫[0 to Qe] (Demand(Q)) dQ - ∫[Q_min to Qe] (Supply(Q)) dQ`\n    where `Q_min` is the minimum quantity for which the supply function is defined (i.e., `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, so `Q_min = 2^(1/3)`).\n4.  **Execute the Script:** We will use a Python script with the `scipy` library to perform these numerical calculations (root-finding and integration) and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare for a given set of supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
