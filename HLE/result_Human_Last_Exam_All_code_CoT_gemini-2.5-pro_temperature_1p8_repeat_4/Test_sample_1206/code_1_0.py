    # Analysis of each statement
    # I is incorrect: Condoning adolescent vaping is not recommended due to high addiction risk.
    # IV is incorrect: Framing vaping as beneficial for youth is misleading.
    # V is a secondary option at best; one drug is not approved for his age, making it a weaker choice.
    # II is correct: NRT is a valid and safer cessation strategy.
    # III is correct: Emphasizing the unknown risks for youth is a critical counseling point.
