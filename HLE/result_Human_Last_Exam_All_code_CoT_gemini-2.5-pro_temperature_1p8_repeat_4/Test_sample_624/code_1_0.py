    # 1. Solve the White-Orange-Green (WOG) pair first.
    #    - The WOG corner is in the Down-Front-Left slot.
    #    - The WOG edge is in the Up-Right slot.

    #    - After applying the first 6 moves, the White-Red-Blue (WRB) pair
    #      becomes perfectly paired up, but it sits in the wrong slot (Down-Back-Right).
    #    - We need to move this solved pair to its correct home slot (Down-Back-Left).
    #    - A 5-move sequence can accomplish this relocation.
