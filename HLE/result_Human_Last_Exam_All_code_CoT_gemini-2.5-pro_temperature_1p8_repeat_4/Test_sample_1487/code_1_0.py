    Solves the mathematical problem as described.
    
    The steps are:
    1. Define the relationship from the Riesz representation theorem: (y_i, alpha) = z_i.
    2. Use properties of the orthogonal system {y_i} to find the coefficients of alpha
       in a corresponding orthonormal basis {e_i}.
    3. Calculate the squared norm of alpha, ||alpha||^2, using Parseval's identity.
    4. Substitute this value into the final expression and compute the result.
    
    The calculation is:
    - ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * sum_{i=1 to inf} (1/(i+1)^2)
    - sum_{k=1 to inf} (1/k^2) = pi^2 / 6
    - So, sum_{j=2 to inf} (1/j^2) = (pi^2 / 6) - 1
    - ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2 / 6 - 1)
    
    The final expression is (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2 / 6 - 1) + 10^15
    This simplifies to (2 * (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)) / (pi^2 / 6 - 1) + 10^15
    = 1 + 10^15
