# The user wants to identify a Chinese character from a riddle.
# Let's analyze the riddle's description step-by-step.

# Riddle breakdown:
# 1. "One horizontal stroke, another horizontal stroke, after another;"
#    This implies the character has three horizontal strokes. For example, the top, middle, and bottom lines.
#
# 2. "one vertical stroke, another vertical stroke, after another;"
#    This implies the character has three vertical strokes.
#
# 3. "one vertical on the left, one vertical on the right;"
#    This highlights the two outer vertical strokes, forming a frame.
#
# 4. "one vertical stroke, another vertical stroke, after another."
#    This is a repetition of the second clue, likely for emphasis or rhythm.
#
# Synthesis:
# We are looking for a single character that contains:
# - Three horizontal lines.
# - Three vertical lines.
# - Prominent left and right vertical lines.
#
# The character that fits all these clues is '田' (tián), which means "field".
# - It has a top horizontal stroke, a middle one (part of the cross), and a bottom one.
# - It has a left vertical stroke, a middle one (part of the cross), and a right one.
# - The "one vertical on the left, one vertical on the right" accurately describes its outer shape.

final_character = "田"
