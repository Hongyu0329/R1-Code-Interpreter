    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction, followed by the Python code to display the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**:\n    *   **Aldehyde**: Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure `(CH3)3C-CHO`. The key functional group is the carbonyl `C=O`.\n    *   **Phosphorus Ylide**: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. The structure is `(C6H5)3P=CH-CH2-(C6H4Cl)`, where the triphenylphosphine group (`(C6H5)3P=`, or `Ph3P=`) is double-bonded to a carbon chain.\n\n2.  **Understand the Wittig Reaction**: This reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen (`=O`) of an aldehyde or ketone with the alkylidene group (`=CR'R\"`) from the ylide. The result is an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide (`Ph3P=O`) as a byproduct.\n\n3.  **Construct the Product**:\n    *   Take the aldehyde fragment: `(CH3)3C-CH`.\n    *   Take the ylide's hydrocarbon fragment: `CH-CH2-(C6H4Cl)`.\n    *   Join these two fragments with a double bond: `(CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(C6H4Cl)`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product**: The systematic IUPAC name for the resulting alkene is determined by identifying the longest carbon chain containing the double bond and naming the substituents accordingly. The name is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n5.  **Generate the Code**: A Python script will be created to formally present the reactants, the full reaction equation, and the name and structure of the final products.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and a specified\n    phosphorus ylide, and prints the chemical equation and products.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
