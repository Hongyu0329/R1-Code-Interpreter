    1. Type-1 Fuzzy Set (Baseline):
       - This is a 2D structure. It maps an input value 'x' (1st dimension) to a single membership grade 'Î¼(x)' (2nd dimension).

    2. Type-2 Fuzzy Set:
       - This is a 3D structure. It models uncertainty about the membership grade.
       - For each input 'x' (1st dimension), there's a range of primary membership values 'u' (2nd dimension), each with its own secondary membership grade (3rd dimension).
       - The projection of this 3D structure creates a 2D "Footprint of Uncertainty" (FOU). Thus, a Type-2 system models uncertainty in a 2D plane.

    3. Type-3 Fuzzy Set:
       - This is a 4D structure. It models uncertainty about the Type-2 membership function itself.
       - The result is that the uncertainty is no longer described by a 2D FOU, but by a 3D volume.

    Conclusion:
    The fundamental structural difference is that moving from Type-2 to Type-3 adds a dimension to the model of uncertainty itself, taking it from a 2D plane to a 3D volume. Option E correctly identifies this as adding "Three-dimensional uncertainty modeling".
