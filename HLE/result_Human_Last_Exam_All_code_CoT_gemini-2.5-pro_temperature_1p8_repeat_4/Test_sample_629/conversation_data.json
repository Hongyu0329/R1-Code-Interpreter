    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of unique ways to draw the left-hand trefoil knot on a minimal grid, considering translations and rotations as equivalences.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the properties of the diagrams:** The minimal grid size (grid number) for a trefoil knot is 3x3. A grid diagram on an `n x n` grid is defined by two permutations, σ and π, of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. The knot type is determined by the composite permutation `p = π⁻¹σ`. For the trefoil knot on a 3x3 grid, `p` must be a 3-cycle.\n2.  **Identify Left-Hand vs. Right-Hand:** There are two 3-cycles for permutations of three items: `(1, 2, 0)` and `(2, 0, 1)`. These correspond to the left-hand and right-hand trefoil knots, respectively. We will choose one, say `(1, 2, 0)`, to represent the left-hand trefoil.\n3.  **Enumerate All Diagrams:** We will write a script to generate all possible pairs of permutations `(σ, π)` and filter for those that represent the left-hand trefoil (i.e., where `π⁻¹σ = (1, 2, 0)`). This gives us the complete set of minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.\n4.  **Group by Equivalence (Orbits):**\n    *   **Translation:** We'll group the diagrams that are equivalent under cyclic shifts of rows and columns. This is done by finding the orbits of the set of diagrams under the action of the translation group. The number of orbits gives the number of diagrams unique up to translation.\n    *   **Rotation:** A key property of grid diagrams is that a rotation (by 90, 180, or 270 degrees) transforms a knot's diagram into a diagram of its mirror image. Therefore, rotating a diagram of a left-hand trefoil results in a diagram of a right-hand trefoil. Since we are only counting diagrams for the left-hand trefoil, no two diagrams in our set can be equivalent to each other by rotation.\n5.  **Final Count:** Based on the above, the number of diagrams unique up to translation and rotation is simply the number of diagrams unique up to translation. The script will calculate this by finding the number of translation orbits.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef perm_inverse(p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the inverse of a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inv = [0] * len(p)\n    for i, val in enumerate(p):\n        inv[val] = i\n    return tuple(inv)\n\ndef perm_compose(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Computes the composition of two permutations, p1 o p2.\"\"\"\n    return tuple(p1[p2[i]] for i in range(len(p1)))\n\ndef apply_translation(diagram, a, b, n=3):\n    \"\"\"Applies a translation by (a, b) to a diagram.\"\"\"\n    sigma, pi = diagram\n    # Column shift by a\n    sigma_col_shifted = tuple(sigma[(i - a) % n] for i in range(n))\n    pi_col_shifted = tuple(pi[(i - a) % n] for i in range(n))\n    # Row shift by b\n    new_sigma = tuple((val + b) % n for val in sigma_col_shifted)\n    new_pi = tuple((val + b) % n for val in pi_col_shifted)\n    return (new_sigma, new_pi)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to perform the calculation and print the results.\"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    perms = list(itertools.permutations(range(n)))\n\n    # The left-hand trefoil corresponds to one of the two 3-cycles.\n    LEFT_TREFOIL_PERM = (1, 2, 0) # This represents c(i) = i+1 mod 3\n\n    # 1.
