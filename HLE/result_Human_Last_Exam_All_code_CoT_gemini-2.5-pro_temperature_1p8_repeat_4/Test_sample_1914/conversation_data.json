    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the basic components of the category.**\n    *   A category consists of objects and morphisms.\n    *   We are given 2 objects. Let's call them `A` and `B`.\n    *   We are given 4 morphisms in total.\n    *   Every object must have an identity morphism. So, we must have `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. These are 2 of our 4 morphisms.\n    *   This leaves 2 non-identity morphisms to place. Let's call them `f` and `g`.\n\n2.  **Classify categories by the distribution of morphisms.**\n    *   The 2 non-identity morphisms (`f`, `g`) can be distributed among the four possible Hom-sets: `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`, and `Hom(B,B)`.\n    *   We can enumerate the possibilities for where `f` and `g` go. The phrase \"up to isomorphism\" means we don't need to distinguish between cases that are structurally identical (e.g., by just swapping the names of `A` and `B`).\n    *   For each distribution, we determine how many unique, valid composition structures exist.\n\n3.  **Enumerate the non-isomorphic cases:**\n\n    *   **Case 1: An isomorphism between A and B.**\n        *   This requires `f: A -> B` and `g: B -> A` such that `g o f = id_A` and `f o g = id_B`.\n        *   The four morphisms are `id_A`, `id_B`, `f`, `g`. The composition is fully determined. This forms **1** category.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Both non-identity morphisms go from A to B.**\n        *   Morphisms are `id_A`, `id_B`, `f: A -> B`, `g: A -> B`.\n        *   There are no non-identity compositions possible (e.g., `f o id_A = f`, but you can't compose `f` with `g`). This structure is sometimes called a \"parallel pair\". It is unique. This forms **1** category. (The case where both go from `B` to `A` is isomorphic to this one).\n\n    *   **Case 3: One endomorphism on A, one morphism from A to B.**\n        *   Morphisms are `id_A`, `id_B`, `f: A -> A`, `g: A -> B`.\n        *   We must define composition for `f o f` and `g o f`.\n        *   `g o f`: The domain is A and the codomain is B, so `g o f` must be `g` (the only non-identity A->B morphism).\n        *   `f o f`: This must be a morphism from A to A. There are two choices: `f o f = f` or `f o f = id_A`. Both options satisfy the category axioms and result in non-isomorphic categories. This gives **2** categories.\n\n    *   **Case 4: One endomorphism on A and one on B.**\n        *   Morphisms are `id_A`, `id_B`, `f: A -> A`, `g: B -> B`.\n        *   The objects are disconnected by non-identity morphisms.\n        *   We must define `f o f` (either `id_A` or `f`) and `g o g` (either `id_B` or `g`).\n        *   This gives 2x2 = 4 possibilities. However, the case `(fof=f, gog=id_B)` is isomorphic to `(fof=id_A, gog=g)` by swapping A and B. So we have **3** distinct categories.\n\n    *   **Case 5: Both non-identity morphisms are on object A.**\n        *   Morphisms are `id_A`, `id_B`, `f: A -> A`, `g: A -> A`.\n        *   The set `Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f, g}` must form a monoid (a semigroup with identity) of size 3. Object B is isolated.\n        *   It is a known result in algebra that there are exactly **5** non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Each one defines a valid and distinct category.\n\n4.  **Sum the results.**\n    *   The total number of non-isomorphic categories is the sum of the counts from all disjoint cases.\n    *   Total = 1 (isomorphism) + 1 (parallel arrows) + 2 (endo + arrow) + 3 (two endos) + 5 (monoid of 3) = 12.\n\nThe python code will sum up these values and print the result.\n\n```python\n# A category with 2 objects (A, B) and 4 morphisms must have two identity\n# morphisms (id_A, id_B), leaving 2 non-identity morphisms to place.\n# We count the number of non-isomorphic categories by partitioning these\n# 2 morphisms and defining their composition rules.\n\n# Case 1: The two objects are isomorphic.\n# Morphisms are id_A, id_B, f: A->B, g: B->A.\n# Composition g o f = id_A and f o g = id_B is fixed.\ncase_isomorphism = 1\n\n# Case 2: The two non-identity morphisms are parallel arrows from A to B.\n# Morphisms are id_A, id_B, f: A->B, g: A->B.\n# No non-trivial compositions are possible.
