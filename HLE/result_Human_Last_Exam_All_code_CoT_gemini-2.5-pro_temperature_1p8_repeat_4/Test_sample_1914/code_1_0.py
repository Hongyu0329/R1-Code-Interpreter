# A category with 2 objects (A, B) and 4 morphisms must have two identity
# morphisms (id_A, id_B), leaving 2 non-identity morphisms to place.
# We count the number of non-isomorphic categories by partitioning these
# 2 morphisms and defining their composition rules.

# Case 1: The two objects are isomorphic.
# Morphisms are id_A, id_B, f: A->B, g: B->A.
# Composition g o f = id_A and f o g = id_B is fixed.
case_isomorphism = 1

# Case 2: The two non-identity morphisms are parallel arrows from A to B.
# Morphisms are id_A, id_B, f: A->B, g: A->B.
# No non-trivial compositions are possible. This gives one unique structure.
# (The case with arrows from B to A is isomorphic).
case_parallel_arrows = 1

# Case 3: One endomorphism on A and one arrow from A to B.
# Morphisms are id_A, id_B, f: A->A, g: A->B.
# The composition f o f must be in Hom(A,A). There are 2 choices
# that lead to valid, non-isomorphic categories:
# a) f o f = f (f is idempotent)
# b) f o f = id_A (f is an involution)
case_endo_and_arrow = 2

# Case 4: One endomorphism on A and one on B.
# Morphisms are id_A, id_B, f: A->A, g: B->B.
# f o f can be id_A or f. g o g can be id_B or g.
# This gives 2x2=4 possibilities, but we account for isomorphism (swapping A and B):
# a) fof=f, gog=g
# b) fof=id_A, gog=id_A
# c) fof=f, gog=id_A (This is isomorphic to fof=id_A, gog=g)
# This gives 3 unique structures.
case_two_endos = 3

# Case 5: Both non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms on A.
# The set of morphisms {id_A, f, g} on object A must form a monoid of order 3.
# It is a known result that there are 5 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.
# Each corresponds to a unique category structure, with B being an isolated object.
case_monoid_of_3 = 5

# The total number of categories is the sum of these disjoint cases.
