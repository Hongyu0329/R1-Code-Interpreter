# The problem asks for the dimension of the log blowup of a point P
# with log structure N^3.

# Step 1: Define the vectors that generate the monoid N^3.
# These are the standard basis vectors in a 3D space.
e1 = np.array([1, 0, 0])
e2 = np.array([0, 1, 0])
e3 = np.array([0, 0, 1])

# Step 2: The dimension of the space P is the dimension of the vector space
# spanned by these generating vectors. We can find this by computing the
# rank of the matrix formed by these vectors.
matrix = np.array([e1, e2, e3])

# Calculate the rank of the matrix.

# Step 3: A log blowup is a birational modification, which means it
# preserves the dimension of the original space. Therefore, the dimension
# of the blowup of P is equal to the dimension of P.
dimension_blowup = dimension_P

# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.
# The user wants each number in the final equation to be shown.
