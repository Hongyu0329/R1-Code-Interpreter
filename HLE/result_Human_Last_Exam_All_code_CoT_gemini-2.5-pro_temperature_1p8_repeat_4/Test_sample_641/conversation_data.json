    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Involutions in PSU(n, q):** An element `x` in a group is an involution if `x^2 = 1` and `x` is not the identity. In PSU(n, q), an element is of the form `gZ`, where `g` is a matrix in the special unitary group SU(n, q) and `Z` is the center of SU(n, q). The condition `(gZ)^2 = 1` implies `g^2` must be in `Z`.\n\n2.  **Characterize the Center Z(SU(4, 997)):** The center `Z` of SU(n, q) consists of scalar matrices `cI` such that `c^n = 1` and `c^(q+1) = 1`. For SU(4, 997), `n=4` and `q=997`. The order of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1) = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. Thus, `Z = {I, -I}`.\n\n3.  **Find Preimages in SU(4, 997):** We are looking for the number of elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2` is in `Z = {I, -I}` and `g` itself is not in `Z`.\n    *   **Case 1: `g^2 = -I`**. For any element `g` in a unitary group `U(n,q)`, its eigenvalues `λ` must satisfy the condition `λ^(q+1) = 1`. If `g^2 = -I`, any eigenvalue `λ` of `g` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`. This would imply `λ^(q+1) = λ^998 = (λ^2)^499 = (-1)^499 = -1`. The condition `λ^(q+1) = 1` becomes `-1 = 1`, which is impossible in a field of characteristic 997. Therefore, there are no elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2 = -I`.\n    *   **Case 2: `g^2 = I`**. These are the involutions in SU(4, 997). The condition that `g` is not in `Z` means `g` is not `I` or `-I`. So, we need to count the non-central involutions in SU(4, 997).\n\n4.  **Count Non-Central Involutions:** Involutions in SU(4, q) are determined by the dimension of their (-1)-eigenspace, which must be even for the determinant to be 1. This gives two classes of involutions: one with a 4-dimensional (-1)-eigenspace (the element `-I`, which is central) and one with a 2-dimensional (-1)-eigenspace (which is non-central). We need to find the size of this non-central conjugacy class, let's call it `C`.\n    The size of `C` is given by the formula `|C| = |SU(4,q)| / |C_{SU(4,q)}(t)|`, where `t` is a representative of the class. The calculation simplifies to:\n    `|C| = q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)`.\n\n5.  **Map to PSU(4, q):** The projection from SU(4, q) to PSU(4, q) maps `g` to `gZ`. For any involution `g` in the class `C`, `-g` is also a distinct element in `C`. Both `g` and `-g` map to the same element `gZ` in PSU(4, q). Thus, this is a 2-to-1 mapping. The number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is half the number of non-central involutions in SU(4, 997).\n\n6.  **Final Formula:** The number of involutions is `|C| / 2 = (q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)) / 2`.\n\nThe following Python code will calculate this value for `q=997`.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n    The formula is (q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)) / 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # Calculate the components of the formula\n    q_pow_4 = q**4\n    q_sq_plus_1 = q**2 + 1\n    q_sq_minus_q_plus_1 = q**2 - q + 1\n\n    # Calculate the total number of involutions\n    numerator = q_pow_4 * q_sq_plus_1 * q_sq_minus_q_plus_1\n    result = numerator // 2\n\n    # Print the equation with the calculated numbers and the final result\n    print(f\"Based on the formula N = (q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)) / 2:\")\n    print(f\"For q = 997:\")\n    print(f\"The equation is: ({q_pow_4} * {q_sq_plus_1} * {q_sq_minus_q_plus_1}) / 2\")\n    print(f\"Number of involutions = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<487532392754664324322465>>>"
