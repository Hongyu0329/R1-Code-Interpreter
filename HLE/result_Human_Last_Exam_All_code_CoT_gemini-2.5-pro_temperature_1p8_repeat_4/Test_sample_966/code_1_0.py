# The problem asks for the dimension of the middle cohomology group H^100(X, Q)
# for a complete intersection X of two quadrics in CP^102.

# Step 1: Define the parameters of the problem.
# Dimension of the ambient projective space CP^n
n = 102
# The variety X is a complete intersection of r hypersurfaces.
r = 2
# The degrees of the hypersurfaces.
d1 = 2
d2 = 2

# Step 2: Calculate the dimension of the variety X.
# The dimension m of a complete intersection is n - r.
m = n - r

print(f"The dimension of the ambient space CP^n is n = {n}.")
print(f"The variety X is the intersection of r = {r} hypersurfaces.")
print(f"The dimension of the variety X is m = n - r = {n} - {r} = {m}.")
print(f"The middle cohomology group is H^{m}(X, Q) = H^{{{m}}}(X, Q).")
print(f"We need to calculate its dimension, the Betti number b_{m} = b_{{{m}}}(X).\n")

# Step 3: Decompose the middle Betti number.
# The middle Betti number b_m(X) is the sum of the algebraic and primitive parts.
# b_m(X) = b_m_alg(X) + b_m_prim(X).
# For a complete intersection, the algebraic part b_m_alg(X) is 1.
# So, b_m(X) = 1 + b_m_prim(X).

# Step 4: Use the formula for the primitive Betti number of an intersection of two quadrics.
# For a generic complete intersection of two quadrics in CP^n, where n is even,
# the primitive middle Betti number b_{n-2, prim} is given by the formula:
# b_{n-2, prim} = n + 2 - c
# where c is the number of distinct singular quadrics in the pencil.
# For a generic pencil, c is the degree of the determinantal polynomial, which is n+1.

# Number of distinct singular quadrics in a generic pencil.
c = n + 1
print(f"For a generic intersection of two quadrics in CP^n with n={n} (even), the primitive part of the middle Betti number is calculated using the formula:")
print(f"b_{{{m}}},prim = n + 2 - c")
print(f"where c is the number of distinct singular quadrics in the pencil.")
print(f"For a generic choice, c = n + 1 = {n} + 1 = {c}.\n")

# Calculate the primitive Betti number.
b_m_prim = n + 2 - c
print(f"The primitive Betti number is b_{{{m}}},prim = {n} + 2 - {c} = {b_m_prim}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final middle Betti number.
b_m = 1 + b_m_prim
print(f"The total middle Betti number is b_{{{m}}} = 1 + b_{{{m}}},prim = 1 + {b_m_prim} = {b_m}.\n")

print(f"Final Answer: The dimension of the middle cohomology group H^{m}(X, Q) is {b_m}.")
print(f"So, dim(H^{100}(X, Q)) = 1 + (102 + 2 - (102 + 1)) = {b_m}")
