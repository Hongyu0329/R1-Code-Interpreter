# This script analyzes whether an ammonia molecule with exotic spin-0 hydrogens would exhibit tunneling.
# We represent symmetry with numbers: 1 for Symmetric, -1 for Antisymmetric.

# --- Step 1: Identify Particle Type ---
# Particles with integer spin (like spin 0) are bosons.
# The Pauli principle requires that the total wavefunction for a system of identical bosons
# must be SYMMETRIC upon the exchange of any two particles.
REQUIRED_TOTAL_SYMMETRY = 1  # Symmetric

# --- Step 2: Analyze the Nuclear Spin Wavefunction ---
# For three exotic hydrogens with spin 0, there is only one possible nuclear spin state: |0>|0>|0>.
# If we exchange any two of these particles, the state remains identical.
# Therefore, the nuclear spin wavefunction is always SYMMETRIC.
SPIN_SYMMETRY = 1 # Symmetric

# --- Step 3: Identify the Spatial Wavefunctions for Tunneling ---
# The phenomenon of tunneling is associated with two distinct vibrational energy states:
# 1. A state with a SYMMETRIC spatial wavefunction.
# 2. A state with an ANTISYMMETRIC spatial wavefunction.
# Tunneling is observable as the energy difference between these two states. For it to occur,
# both states must be allowed to exist by the Pauli principle.
