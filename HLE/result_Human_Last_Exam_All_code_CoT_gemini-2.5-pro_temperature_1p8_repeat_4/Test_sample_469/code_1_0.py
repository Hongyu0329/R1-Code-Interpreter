# Step 1: Define the constants for the problem.
pH = 4.21
pKa_bromophenol_blue = 4.1  # The pKa for Bromophenol blue's transition from yellow to blue.
path_length_thin_mm = 1.0  # The path length of the thin side.
path_length_thick_cm = 10.0 # The path length of the thick side.

# Step 2: Determine the solution's fundamental color using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
# The equation is: pH = pKa + log([Base Form] / [Acid Form])
# For Bromophenol blue, the Acid Form (HIn) is yellow and the Base Form (In-) is blue.

print("Equation: pH = pKa + log([Blue Form] / [Yellow Form])")
# We rearrange the equation to solve for the ratio: log([Blue]/[Yellow]) = pH - pKa
log_ratio = pH - pKa_bromophenol_blue
ratio_blue_to_yellow = 10**log_ratio

print(f"The equation with the given values is: {pH} = {pKa_bromophenol_blue} + log([Blue]/[Yellow])")

print(f"The ratio of the Blue form to the Yellow form is 10^{log_ratio:.2f} = {ratio_blue_to_yellow:.2f}")
print("\nBecause the pH is very close to the pKa, the solution contains significant amounts of both the yellow acidic form and the blue basic form.")
print("When a solution absorbs light in the blue-violet region (due to the yellow compound) and the yellow-orange region (due to the blue compound), the light it transmits appears GREEN.")
print("Therefore, the fundamental color of the solution is green.")

print("\n--- Step 2: Analyze the effect of path length ---")
# Convert all path lengths to cm for comparison.
path_length_thin_cm = path_length_thin_mm / 10.0

print(f"Path length of the thick side = {path_length_thick_cm} cm")
print("\nAccording to the Beer-Lambert Law, a solution's absorbance is directly proportional to the path length of the light.")
print("A shorter path length (the thin side) results in lower absorbance, which is perceived as a lighter or less intense color.")
print("A longer path length (the thick side) results in higher absorbance, which is perceived as a darker or more intense color.")

# Step 4: Final Conclusion

print("Combining these findings:")
print(f"- The color of the solution is GREEN.")
print(f"- When viewed through the thin side ({path_length_thin_cm} cm), it will look like a LIGHT GREEN.")
print(f"- When viewed through the thick side ({path_length_thick_cm} cm), it will look like a DARKER/MORE INTENSE GREEN.")
print("\nThis matches the answer choice describing the color as 'light green' for the thin side and 'green' for the thick side.")
