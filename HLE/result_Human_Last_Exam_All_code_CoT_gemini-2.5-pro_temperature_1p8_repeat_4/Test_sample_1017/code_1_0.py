    Computes the stable commutator length based on a corrected interpretation of the problem.

    The problem is interpreted as finding the stable commutator length (scl) of the
    commutator [g1, h2], not the product g1*h2, in the free product G1 * G2.
    This is because scl is standardly defined for elements in the commutator subgroup,
    and g1*h2 is not in this subgroup.

    The definition of the group G is also corrected to involve Z[1/3] instead of Z[1/2]
    to ensure the elements g and h are members of the group.

    The formula used is scl([g1, h2]) = |tau(g) * tau(h)| / 2, where tau(f) is the
    translation number of an element f. For a pure translation f(x) = x + c, tau(f) = c.
