# Step 1: Define given values and calculate the 1s exciton binding energy.
E_g = 3.0       # Band gap in eV
E_ex_1s = 1.0   # 1s exciton resonance peak in eV
n_final = 3     # Target state

# The binding energy of the 1s exciton is the difference between the band gap and the resonance peak.
E_b_1s = E_g - E_ex_1s

print(f"The problem states a band gap of {E_g} eV and a 1s exciton resonance at {E_ex_1s} eV.")
print(f"First, we calculate the binding energy of the ground state (1s) exciton:")
print(f"E_b(1s) = E_g - E_ex(1s) = {E_g} - {E_ex_1s} = {E_b_1s} eV\n")

# Step 2: Determine the 2D Rydberg energy constant (R_y*).
# For a 2D exciton, the binding energy levels are given by E_b(n) = R_y* / (n - 0.5)^2.
# For the ground state (n=1), this becomes E_b(1s) = R_y* / (1 - 0.5)^2 = 4 * R_y*.
Ry_star = E_b_1s / 4.0

print(f"For a 2D system, the Rydberg energy constant R_y* is related to the ground state binding energy by:")
print(f"E_b(1s) = R_y* / (1 - 0.5)^2 = 4 * R_y*")
print(f"Therefore, R_y* = E_b(1s) / 4 = {E_b_1s} / 4 = {Ry_star} eV\n")

# Step 3: Calculate the Rydberg energy (binding energy) for n=3.
# The question "Rydberg energy for n=3" asks for the binding energy of the n=3 state.
n_minus_half = n_final - 0.5
denominator = n_minus_half**2
E_b_n3 = Ry_star / denominator

print(f"Finally, we calculate the Rydberg energy for the n={n_final} state using the 2D formula:")
print(f"E_b(n) = R_y* / (n - 0.5)^2")
# The following line explicitly shows each number used in the final equation.
print(f"E_b({n_final}) = {Ry_star} / ({n_final} - 0.5)^2 = {Ry_star} / {n_minus_half}^2 = {Ry_star} / {denominator} = {E_b_n3:.3f} eV")
