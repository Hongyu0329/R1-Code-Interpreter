    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we first need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. The steady state is reached as $t \\to +\\infty$, at which point the probabilities no longer change with time. This means that all the time derivatives, $P_{i}'(t)$, become zero.\n\nLet $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ denote the steady-state probabilities. Setting the derivatives in the given system of equations to zero, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations:\n$$\n0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}\n$$\nAlong with the normalization condition:\n$$\nP_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1\n$$\nNotice that the sum of the first four equations (with derivatives) is $(P_0+P_1+P_2+P_3)' = 0$, which is consistent with the normalization condition that the sum is constant (equal to 1). This implies that one of the first four equations is redundant. We can discard one (e.g., the second one) and use the remaining three along with the normalization condition to solve for the four unknown probabilities $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$.\n\nThis forms a system of four linear equations with four variables, which can be expressed in matrix form $A\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{b}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lambda_{01} & -\\lambda_{10} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\lambda_{12} & -(\\lambda_{21}+\\lambda_{23}) & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\lambda_{23} & -\\lambda_{31} \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} P_0 \\\\ P_1 \\\\ P_2 \\\\ P_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nI will now provide a Python script that uses the NumPy library to define and solve this system of linear equations for the given $\\lambda$ values. The script will then calculate and print the required sum $P_0 + P_1$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given lambda values\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# We need to solve the system of linear equations A*P = b\n# where P = [P0, P1, P2, P3]^T are the steady-state probabilities.\n# The equations are:\n# l01*P0 - l10*P1 = 0\n# l12*P1 - (l21+l23)*P2 = 0\n# l23*P2 - l31*P3 = 0\n# P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1\n\n# Set up the matrix A\nA = np.array([\n    [lambda_01, -lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\n# Set up the vector b\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Solve the system A*P = b for P\ntry:\n    P = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    P0, P1, P2, P3 = P[0], P[1], P[2], P[3]\n\n    # Calculate the required sum\n    sum_P0_P1 = P0 + P1\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"The steady-state probabilities are:\")\n    print(f\"P0(inf) = {P0}\")\n    print(f\"P1(inf) = {P1}\")\n    print(f\"P2(inf) = {P2}\")\n    print(f\"P3(inf) = {P3}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe sum of all probabilities (should be 1):\")\n    print(f\"{P0} + {P1} + {P2} + {P3} = {P0 + P1 + P2 + P3}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe required sum is P0(inf) + P1(inf):\")\n    print(f\"{P0} + {P1} = {sum_P0_P1}\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations does not have a unique solution.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339464>>>"
