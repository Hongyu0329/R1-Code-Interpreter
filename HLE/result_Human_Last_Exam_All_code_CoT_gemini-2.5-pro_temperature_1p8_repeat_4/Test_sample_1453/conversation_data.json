    "My plan to determine the oligomeric state of the protein is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Protein Sequence for a Heptad Repeat:** Coiled-coils are characterized by a seven-residue repeating pattern, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are critical as they form the hydrophobic core that holds the helices together. I will scan the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` to identify this repeating pattern.\n\n2.  **Identify Core ('a', 'd') and Flanking ('e', 'g') Residues:** Once the heptad repeat register is established, I will identify which amino acids occupy the 'a' and 'd' core positions, as well as the 'e' and 'g' flanking positions, which are important for electrostatic stabilization.\n\n3.  **Apply Principles of Coiled-Coil Packing:** The specific combination of amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions strongly dictates the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) due to the precise packing requirements (\"knobs-into-holes\").\n    *   **Trimer (3):** Strongly prefers a bulky, beta-branched residue (Isoleucine/I) at 'a' and a straight-chain Leucine (L) at 'd' (`a=I, d=L`).\n    *   **Tetramer (4):** The reverse pattern, `a=L, d=I`, is a classic motif that forms tetramers. This arrangement avoids the steric clash that would occur if three Isoleucines tried to pack together at the 'd' position of a trimer.\n    *   **Dimer (2):** More flexible in its core requirements but is often stabilized by electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between charged residues at the 'e' and 'g' positions.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Predict the Oligomeric State:** By combining the analysis of the core (`a`, `d`) and flanking (`e`, `g`) positions, I will determine the most likely oligomeric state for the given sequence.\n\nI will now implement this analysis in a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a protein sequence to predict its coiled-coil oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"1.
