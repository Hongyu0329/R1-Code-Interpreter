    "This is a specialized question from the field of neuroanatomy. A direct computational answer is not possible, so I will answer this by encoding established biological knowledge into a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will create a Python dictionary to serve as a simplified knowledge base of the dwarf cuttlefish brain. This dictionary will map certain brain lobes to the lobes that are known to be located posterior (behind) them.\n2.  The script will then query this dictionary for the \"palliovisceral lobe\".\n3.  Finally, it will print the names of the lobes found in the posterior position relative to the target lobe.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_posterior_lobes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses a pre-defined knowledge base about the dwarf cuttlefish brain\n    to identify regions posterior to the palliovisceral lobe.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This dictionary represents simplified spatial relationships in the cuttlefish brain\n    # based on neuroanatomical studies.\n    # Key: Brain Lobe, Value: List of lobes adjacent posteriorly.\n    brain_anatomy_map = {\n        \"palliovisceral_lobe\": [\n            \"giant_fiber_lobe\",\n            \"posterior_chromatophore_lobes\"\n        ],\n        \"optic_lobe\": [\n            \"peduncle_lobe\"\n        ],\n        \"vertical_lobe_complex\": [\n            \"superior_frontal_lobe\",\n            \"inferior_frontal_lobe\"\n        ]\n    }\n\n    target_lobe = \"palliovisceral_lobe\"\n    \n    if target_lobe in brain_anatomy_map:\n        posterior_lobes = brain_anatomy_map[target_lobe]\n        print(f\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the '{target_lobe}' are:\")\n        for lobe in posterior_lobes:\n            print(f\"- {lobe}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Anatomical information for '{target_lobe}' is not found in this model.\")\n\nget_adjacent_posterior_lobes()\n```\n<<<The giant fiber lobe and the posterior chromatophore lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
