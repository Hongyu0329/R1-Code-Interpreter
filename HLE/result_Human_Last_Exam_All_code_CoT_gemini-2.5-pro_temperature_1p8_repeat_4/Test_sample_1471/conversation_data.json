    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the equation:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Equation**: First, I will break down the Roman numeral equation `VIII/LXXX - XXI/IX = ?` into its four component numerals: `VIII`, `LXXX`, `XXI`, and `IX`.\n2.  **Convert Roman to Modern Numbers**: I will write a Python script that contains a function to convert these Roman numerals into their modern integer equivalents. For instance, `VIII` will become `8`, and `XXI` will become `21`.\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**: After converting all the Roman numerals to integers, the script will perform the specified arithmetic operations. The equation will transform into a standard mathematical expression: `8 / 80 - 21 / 9`.\n4.  **Display the Result**: Finally, the script will print the entire equation using the converted modern numbers, along with the final calculated result, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n```python\ndef roman_to_int(s: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Converts a Roman numeral string to an integer.\"\"\"\n    roman_map = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}\n    result = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        # Check for the subtractive case (e.g., IX for 9 or IV for 4)\n        if i + 1 < len(s) and roman_map[s[i]] < roman_map[s[i+1]]:\n            result += roman_map[s[i+1]] - roman_map[s[i]]\n            i += 2\n        # Otherwise, handle the additive case (e.g., VI for 6 or XI for 11)\n        else:\n            result += roman_map[s[i]]\n            i += 1\n    return result\n\n# The Roman numerals from the equation \"VIII/LXXX - XXI/IX = ?\"\nroman_num_1 = \"VIII\"\nroman_num_2 = \"LXXX\"\nroman_num_3 = \"XXI\"\nroman_num_4 = \"IX\"\n\n# Convert the Roman numerals to integers\nnum_1 = roman_to_int(roman_num_1)\nnum_2 = roman_to_int(roman_num_2)\nnum_3 = roman_to_int(roman_num_3)\nnum_4 = roman_to_int(roman_num_4)\n\n# Calculate the result of the equation\nsolution = (num_1 / num_2) - (num_3 / num_4)\n\n# Print the full equation with modern numbers and the final answer\nprint(f\"The equation is: {num_1} / {num_2} - {num_3} / {num_4} = {solution}\")\n```\n<<<-2.233333333333333>>>"
