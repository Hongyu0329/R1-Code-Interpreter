    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Encoding Principle:** In a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits it can encode is directly determined by its topology. Specifically, for a single, isolated patch of surface code, the number of logical qubits is equal to the number of \"holes\" or \"punctures\" within that patch.\n\n2.  **Calculate for a Single Patch:** The problem states that each patch has two holes. Therefore, a single patch can encode 2 logical qubits.\n    *   Logical Qubits per Patch = Number of Holes = 2\n\n3.  **Calculate for All Patches:** The problem specifies there are two such patches. Since the patches are separate, their capacities for encoding logical qubits are additive.\n    *   Total Logical Qubits = (Logical Qubits per Patch) × (Number of Patches)\n    *   Total Logical Qubits = 2 × 2 = 4\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of independent surface code patches\nnum_patches = 2\n\n# Number of holes in each patch\nnum_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n# In a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits (k) that can be\n# encoded in a single patch is equal to the number of holes (h).\n# Formula for one patch: k = h\nlogical_qubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch\n\n# Since the patches are independent, the total number of logical qubits is the\n# sum of the qubits from each patch.\ntotal_logical_qubits = logical_qubits_per_patch * num_patches\n\n# Print the final equation showing all the numbers\nprint(f\"Total logical qubits = {logical_qubits_per_patch} logical qubits/patch * {num_patches} patches = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
