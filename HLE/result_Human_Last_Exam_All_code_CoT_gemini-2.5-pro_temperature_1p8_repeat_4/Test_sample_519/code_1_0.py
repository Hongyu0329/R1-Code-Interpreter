# The properties of the three categories are determined as follows.

# For X1, the category is represented by the Hilbert scheme of 11 points in A^3.
# Type: Scheme (S)
# Separated: Yes (s)
# Universally Closed: No
# Irreducible: No
# Dimension: dimension of ambient space * number of points.
dim1 = 3 * 11
profile1 = f"[S,s,{dim1}]"

# For X2, the category is a quotient stack [U/G].
# The action is free, so it is a scheme.
# Type: Scheme (S)
# Separated: Yes (s)
# Universally Closed: No
# Irreducible: Yes (irr)
# Dimension: dim(U) - dim(G)
dim2 = 4 - 1
profile2 = f"[S,s,irr,{dim2}]"

# For X3, the category is the stack of line bundles on a curve.
# Type: Algebraic Stack (A)
# Separated: Yes (s)
# Universally Closed: No
# Irreducible: No
# Dimension: dim(Picard scheme) + dim(generic stabilizer)
genus = 7
dim_stabilizer = 1
dim3 = genus + dim_stabilizer
profile3 = f"[A,s,{dim3}]"

# Combining the profiles into the final answer string.
final_answer = f"{profile1} {profile2} {profile3}"

# Printing the final answer in the required format.
print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>")
