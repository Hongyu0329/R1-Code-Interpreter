    This function determines the IUPAC name of the product from the reaction of
    methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide.

    The reaction is a Pummerer reaction, which proceeds as follows:
    1.  Activation of the sulfoxide with triflic anhydride to form a sulfonium intermediate.
    2.  Formation of a thionium ion [Ph-S=CH2]+.
    3.  Nucleophilic attack by cyanide to form the product Ph-S-CH2-CN.

    The IUPAC naming rules are then applied to this final product structure.
    - Principal functional group: Nitrile (-CN) -> Suffix: 'acetonitrile' (for a 2-carbon chain)
    - Substituent on carbon 2: Phenylthio group (Ph-S-)
