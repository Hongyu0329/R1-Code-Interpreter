    "This task requires identifying the product of a multi-step organic reaction and then determining its correct IUPAC name.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:**\n    *   **Methyl phenyl sulfoxide (Ph-S(=O)-Me):** The substrate. The sulfur-oxygen bond will be activated.\n    *   **Triflic anhydride ((CF₃SO₂)₂O):** A very strong electrophile used to activate the sulfoxide oxygen, making it a good leaving group.\n    *   **Trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN):** A source for the cyanide nucleophile (⁻CN).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Pummerer Reaction):**\n    *   **Step 1: Activation:** The oxygen atom of the sulfoxide attacks the triflic anhydride. This forms a triflyloxysulfonium salt, `[Ph-S(OTf)-Me]⁺`. This intermediate is highly reactive.\n    *   **Step 2: Ylide/Thionium Ion Formation:** A proton on the carbon adjacent to the sulfonium sulfur (the methyl group) is very acidic. It gets removed by a weak base (like the triflate counter-anion), leading to the formation of a key electrophilic intermediate called a thionium ion, `[Ph-S=CH₂]⁺`.\n    *   **Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack:** The thionium ion is attacked by the cyanide nucleophile from TMSCN. The cyanide attacks the methylene carbon.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final Product:**\n    The reaction sequence `Ph-S(=O)-Me → [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]⁺ → [Ph-S=CH₂]⁺ → Ph-S-CH₂-CN` yields α-cyanomethyl phenyl sulfide.\n\n4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), which has higher priority than the sulfide.\n    *   The parent chain containing the nitrile is a two-carbon chain, so the base name is **acetonitrile**.\n    *   The nitrile carbon is C1, which means the methylene (-CH₂) group is C2.\n    *   The substituent attached at C2 is a phenyl group bonded through a sulfur atom (Ph-S-), which is named **phenylthio**.\n    *   Combining these parts gives the final IUPAC name: **2-(Phenylthio)acetonitrile**.\n\n5.  **Create the Python Code:** Write a Python script to print the final answer as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the IUPAC name of the product from the reaction of\n    methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide.\n\n    The reaction is a Pummerer reaction, which proceeds as follows:\n    1.  Activation of the sulfoxide with triflic anhydride to form a sulfonium intermediate.\n    2.  Formation of a thionium ion [Ph-S=CH2]+.\n    3.  Nucleophilic attack by cyanide to form the product Ph-S-CH2-CN.\n\n    The IUPAC naming rules are then applied to this final product structure.\n    - Principal functional group: Nitrile (-CN) -> Suffix: 'acetonitrile' (for a 2-carbon chain)\n    - Substituent on carbon 2: Phenylthio group (Ph-S-)\n    \"\"\"\n    product_name = \"2-(Phenylthio)acetonitrile\"\n    \n    # As requested, outputting the number found in the final name.\n    # The locant '2' indicates the position of the substituent on the acetonitrile chain.\n    print(f\"The final IUPAC name of the product is: {product_name}\")\n    print(\"The number '2' in the name indicates the position of the 'Phenylthio' group.\")\n\nget_iupac_name()\n```\n<<<2-(Phenylthio)acetonitrile>>>"
