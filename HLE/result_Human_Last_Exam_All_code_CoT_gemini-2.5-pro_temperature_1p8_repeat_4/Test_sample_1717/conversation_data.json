    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players, based on the game's source code mechanics.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health Values:** Find the Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Classic Mode and its starting health in single-player Expert Mode.\n2.  **Determine the Scaling Formula:** Establish the formula Terraria uses to increase boss health for each additional player in Expert Mode. This involves a scaling factor applied to the Classic Mode base health.\n3.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** The core of the problem is understanding what \"infinite\" means in the context of a computer program. A mathematical formula might go to infinity, but software has technical limitations.\n4.  **Identify the Technical Limitation:** The game's source code stores health in a specific data type (a 32-bit signed integer). This data type has a maximum possible value, which serves as the true theoretical ceiling for the boss's health.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** Write a Python script that defines these values, explains the formula and the technical limitation step-by-step, and prints the final maximum health value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_max_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n    The calculation is based on an infinite number of players, which is limited by the\n    game's data type for storing health.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the base health values from the game's data.\n    # We will use the health of the Eye of Cthulhu's first phase for calculations.\n    classic_base_health = 2800\n    expert_single_player_health = 3640\n\n    # Step 2: Define the health scaling mechanic for additional players in Expert Mode.\n    # Each player after the first adds 50% of the boss's Classic Mode health.\n    per_player_scaling_factor = 0.50\n    health_per_additional_player = int(classic_base_health * per_player_scaling_factor)\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the health formula for N players.\n    print(\"--- Terraria Boss Health Calculation ---\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The health scaling formula for a boss in Expert Mode multiplayer is:\")\n    print(\"Total Health = (Single-Player Expert Health) + (Health Per Additional Player) * (Number of Players - 1)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Show the specific values for the Eye of Cthulhu in the equation.\n    print(\"Step 2: Plugging in the values for the Eye of Cthulhu gives the equation:\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {expert_single_player_health} + ({classic_base_health} * {per_player_scaling_factor}) * (N - 1)\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {expert_single_player_health} + {health_per_additional_player} * (N - 1)\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Analyze the concept of \"infinite players\".\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the 'infinite players' condition.\")\n    print(\"With the formula above, as the number of players (N) approaches infinity, the total health also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(\"However, Terraria's source code stores NPC health as a 32-bit signed integer.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 6: Identify the technical limit.\n    # The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2^31 - 1.\n    max_int_32_bit = 2**31 - 1\n\n    print(\"Step 4: The technical limitation imposes a maximum health cap.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is {max_int_32_bit:,}.\")\n    print(\"This is the theoretical maximum health for any single NPC in the game.\")\n\ncalculate_max_health()\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"
