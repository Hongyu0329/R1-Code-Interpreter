    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, we need to find a suitable model for the curve whose special fiber (the reduction modulo 2) is semi-stable. A semi-stable curve is one whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Rewrite the equation:** Start by rearranging the equation to analyze its structure, particularly with respect to divisibility by 2. The equation is $y^2 - x^2 = 8x + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\n2.  **Introduce a change of variables:** The right-hand side is divisible by 4 for any 2-adic integer $x$. This implies $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 4$. For any 2-adic integer point $(x,y)$ on the curve, $x$ and $y$ must have the same parity. This allows for the transformation $y-x = 2u$ and $y+x = 2v$, which implies $x = v-u$ and $y=v+u$. The new coordinates $(u,v)$ will also be 2-adic integers.\n3.  **Substitute and simplify:** Substitute the expressions for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$ into the original equation to get a new model for the curve in the $(u,v)$-plane.\n4.  **Analyze the reduction modulo 2:** Reduce the new equation modulo 2 to get the special fiber.\n5.  **Identify singularities:** Find the singular points of this reduced curve and classify them. The number of ordinary double points (nodes) will be the answer. The lowest-degree terms of the equation at a singular point determine the nature of the singularity. If these terms factor into distinct linear factors, the point is a node.\n\nThis process will reveal the structure of the stable reduction and the number of its double points.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stable reduction of the given curve to find the number of double points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols for variables\n    x, y, u, v = sympy.symbols('x y u v')\n\n    # The original curve equation is y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5\n    # Rearranging gives: y^2 - x^2 = 8*x + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5\n    original_rhs = 8*x + 4*x**3 + 4*x**4 + 8*x**5\n    print(\"Original equation: y**2 - x**2 = 8*x + x**2 + 4*x**3 + 4*x**4 + 8*x**5\")\n    print(f\"y**2 - x**2 = {original_rhs}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # We perform a change of variables.
