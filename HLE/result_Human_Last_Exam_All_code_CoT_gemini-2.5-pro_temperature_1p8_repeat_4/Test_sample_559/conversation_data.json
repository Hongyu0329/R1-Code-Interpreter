    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points**: I will find the points $(u, d)$ where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are zero. These are the steady states of the system.\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points**: I will compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluate its eigenvalues at each equilibrium point. This will allow me to classify them as nodes, sources, sinks, or saddles.\n3.  **Identify the separatrix**: A separatrix is a special trajectory that separates different regions of flow behavior. Typically, separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds associated with saddle points. I will look for a trajectory that connects to a saddle point.\n4.  **Find the equation of the separatrix**: I will attempt to find an analytical solution to the system's phase plane equation, $\\frac{d}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$. By testing simple functional forms (like polynomials), I can try to find an exact expression for the separatrix.\n5.  **Verification**: Once a candidate equation for the separatrix is found, I will substitute it back into the original system of differential equations to verify that it is indeed a valid trajectory.\n6.  **Final Output**: I will write a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to symbolically verify the derived equation of the separatrix and then print out the final equation, clearly stating the values of its coefficients and exponents as requested.\n\nHere is my step-by-step derivation:\n\n**Step 1: Find Equilibrium Points**\nSet $u'(t) = 0$ and $d'(t) = 0$.\n$u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nIf $u=0$:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2 + 0 - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\nSo, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\nIf $u=1$:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\nSo, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the region $u \\ge 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Equilibrium Points**\nThe Jacobian matrix of the system $(u', d')$ with respect to $(u, d)$ is:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$\nSince the matrix is lower triangular, the eigenvalues are its diagonal entries:\n$\\lambda_1 = 3u^2 - 2u$\n$\\lambda_2 = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n\n*   At $(1, -1)$:\n    $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) = -4 + 5 - 3 = -2$\n    The eigenvalues are $1$ and $-2$. Since they are real and have opposite signs, the point $(1, -1)$ is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   At $(1, 0)$:\n    $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) = 2$\n    Both eigenvalues are positive, so $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (source).\n\n*   At $(0, 0)$:\n    $\\lambda_1 = 0$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$. Linearization is inconclusive.\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Find the Equation for the Separatrix**\nSeparatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(1, -1)$. Let's search for a simple curve that is a trajectory of the system and passes through the saddle point.\nLet's hypothesize a solution of the form $d(t) = -u(t)^2$.\n\nTo verify, we check if this relation satisfies the first differential equation $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$.\nFirst, find the derivative of the proposed solution with respect to $t$ using the chain rule and substituting $u'(t) = u^2(u-1)$:\nLHS: $d'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u \\cdot u'(t) = -2u \\cdot (u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow, substitute $d = -u^2$ into the right-hand side of the equation for $d'(t)$:\nRHS: $2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - (u^3-u^4)$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4$\n$= -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nSince LHS = RHS, the relation $d = -u^2$ describes a trajectory of the system.\nLet's check if this trajectory passes through the saddle point $(1, -1)$. If $u=1$, then $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. Yes, it passes through $(1,-1)$.\nThis trajectory also passes through the equilibrium point $(0,0)$.\nThus, the curve $d = -u^2$ is a separatrix for the system (it is, in fact, the unstable manifold of the saddle point).\n\n**Step 5 & 6: Verification via Code and Final Output**\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to symbolically verify this solution and prints the result in the requested format.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function verifies the separatrix for the given system of ODEs and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols for time t, and functions u(t) and d(t)\n    t = sympy.Symbol('t')\n    u = sympy.Function('u')\n    d = sympy.Function('d')\n\n    # Define the system of differential equations\n    # d'(t) = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)\n    # u'(t) = u^2(u-1)\n    ode_d_rhs = 2*d(t)**2 + (5*u(t)**2 - 3*u(t))*d(t) - u(t)**3 * (1-u(t))\n    ode_u_rhs = u(t)**2 * (u(t)-1)\n\n    # The equation for u'(t)\n    u_prime_eq = sympy.Eq(sympy.Derivative(u(t), t), ode_u_rhs)\n\n    # We propose the separatrix is given by the curve d = -u^2.\n    # Let's verify if d(t) = -u(t)**2 is a valid trajectory.\n    proposed_d = -u(t)**2\n\n    # Calculate the Left-Hand Side (LHS) of the first ODE, which is d'(t).\n    # We use the chain rule: d/dt = (d/du)*(du/dt)\n    # So, d/dt(-u(t)**2) = -2*u(t)*u'(t)\n    lhs = sympy.Derivative(proposed_d, t).doit()\n    # Substitute u'(t) from the second ODE\n    lhs = lhs.subs(sympy.Derivative(u(t), t), u_prime_eq.rhs)\n\n    # Calculate the Right-Hand Side (RHS) of the first ODE by substituting d = -u^2.\n    rhs = ode_d_rhs.subs(d(t), proposed_d)\n\n    # Check if LHS and RHS are equal. sympy.simplify helps to confirm this.\n    if sympy.simplify(lhs - rhs) == 0:\n        # The separatrix is d = -u^2. We present it in the form d = a * u^b.\n        a = -1\n        b = 2\n\n        print(\"The separatrix is given by the equation d = -u^2.\")\n        print(\"This has been symbolically verified.\")\n        print(\"The equation is of the form: d = a * u^b\")\n        # Outputting each number in the final equation\n        print(f\"The coefficient 'a' is: {a}\")\n        print(f\"The exponent 'b' is: {b}\")\n        print(f\"Final Equation: d = {a}u^{b}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Verification failed. The proposed solution is not correct.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<$d = -u**2$>>>"
