    # Step 2: Trace the inheritance of the chromosomes

    print("   - The male is red-eyed, so his single X chromosome must carry the red-eye allele (w+).")
    print("   - The red-eye allele (w+) could only come from the red-eyed father (Xw+Y).")
    print("   - The '0' (lack of a second sex chromosome) must have come from the mother.")

    print("\n   - The genetic 'equation' is: Egg('0') + Sperm(Xw+) --> Offspring(Xw+0)")
    print("\n   - The mother (XwXw) producing a '0' egg indicates a failure of her X chromosomes to separate during meiosis.")
    print("   - This event is known as non-disjunction of the X chromosome in the female.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the specific options

    print("   - Non-disjunction in the female can occur in Meiosis I (failure of homologous chromosomes to separate) or Meiosis II (failure of sister chromatids to separate).")

    print("   - However, the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate in Meiosis I is the foundational event and the canonical explanation for Bridges' discovery.")

    print("Conclusion: The presence of a red-eyed X0 male proves that a non-disjunction event occurred during female meiosis, specifically the failure of homologous X chromosomes to separate in Meiosis I, leading to a nullo-X egg.")
