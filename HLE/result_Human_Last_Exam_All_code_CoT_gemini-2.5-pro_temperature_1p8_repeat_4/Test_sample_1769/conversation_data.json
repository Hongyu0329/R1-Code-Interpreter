    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my thinking process for determining the word:\n\nFirst, I need to identify the origin of the current word \"sister\". It comes from the Old Norse word \"systir,\" which was introduced into the language during the Viking invasions and settlement of parts of England between the 8th and 11th centuries.\n\nNext, I need to find the native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word that \"systir\" replaced. That word was \"sweostor\".\n\nThen, I must trace the likely evolution of \"sweostor\" into Modern English, following the standard sound and spelling changes that occurred in the language over the centuries, had it not been displaced.\n\n1.  **Old English to Middle English:** The Old English \"sweostor\" was already evolving into forms like \"suster\" in some dialects of Middle English. This involves the common simplification of the initial \"sw-\" cluster and a change in the vowel sound. This form, \"suster,\" was widely used.\n\n2.  **Middle English to Modern English (The Great Vowel Shift):** The key change would be the Great Vowel Shift, which altered the pronunciation of long vowels. The \"u\" in the Middle English \"suster\" (pronounced /u/, like in \"boot\") would have shifted to the modern short \"u\" sound (phonetically /ÊŒ/), like the vowel in the words \"cup\" or \"butter\".\n\n3.  **Final Word:** The spelling would likely have remained as \"suster\", but the pronunciation would be what we hear in \"duster\" or \"buster\".\n\nTherefore, the native English word for \"sister\" would most likely have been \"suster\". I will now use a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_native_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and determines the Modern English word for 'sister'\n    if the Norse had never influenced the language.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    hypothetical_modern_english_word = \"suster\"\n\n    print(\"--- Linguistic Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"The current English word '{current_word}' comes from the Old Norse word '{old_norse_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"Without Norse influence, we would look to the original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word: '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"Following natural English language evolution (including the Great Vowel Shift), '{old_english_word}' would have likely evolved into a form like the documented Middle English word 'suster'.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"The predicted Modern English word for 'sister' without Norse influence would be:\")\n    print(hypothetical_modern_english_word)\n\nfind_native_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
