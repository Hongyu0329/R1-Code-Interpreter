    # Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian subgraph before dissolution.
    # Before 1991, the USSR, China, and Mongolia formed a K3 clique (triangle),
    # requiring at least 3 colors. No K4 clique (4 mutually bordering nations) existed.
    # Therefore, the chromatic number is taken as 3.
    chi_before = 3
    print(f"Step 1: The chromatic number of the Asian graph before the Soviet dissolution (chi_before) was {chi_before}.")

    # Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after dissolution.
    # The dissolution led to the creation of Kazakhstan. This formed a K4 clique
    # consisting of four mutually bordering nations: Russia, China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan.
    # A K4 clique requires a minimum of 4 colors. By the Four Color Theorem, 4 colors are also sufficient.
    chi_after = 4
    print(f"Step 2: The chromatic number after the dissolution (chi_after) became {chi_after}.")

    # Step 3: Calculate the change in the chromatic number, delta_soviet.
    # The change is the difference between the new and old chromatic numbers.
    delta_soviet = chi_after - chi_before
    print(f"Step 3: The incremental change, delta_soviet, is {chi_after} - {chi_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

    # Step 4: Determine the change in planarity, beta.
    # A country border graph is inherently planar. Subdividing a region (the USSR)
    # does not change the planarity of the graph.
    # As per the rules, beta is 1 if planarity does not change.
    beta = 1
    print(f"Step 4: The graph's planarity did not change, so the factor beta is {beta}.")

    # Step 5: Calculate the final result.
    # The final answer is the product of beta and delta_soviet.
    final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
