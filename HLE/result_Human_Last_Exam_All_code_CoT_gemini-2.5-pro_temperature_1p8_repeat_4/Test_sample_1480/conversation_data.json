    "To calculate the rule activation level for a fuzzy rule, we need to combine the membership degrees of the rule's antecedents (the \"IF\" part) using a t-norm operation, which is a fuzzy logic generalization of the AND operator.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  I will identify the given membership degrees from the problem description, which are 0.7 and 0.9.\n2.  The problem specifies using a t-norm operation. The most common and fundamental t-norm is the `minimum` operator, which I will use for this calculation. The activation level will be the minimum of the given membership degrees.\n3.  I will write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n4.  The script will store the two values, calculate their minimum, and then print the result in a sentence that explicitly shows the operation performed, e.g., \"min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\".\n\n```python\n# The given membership degrees for the rule's antecedents.\nantecedent_1_membership = 0.7\nantecedent_2_membership = 0.9\n\n# The rule activation level is calculated by applying a t-norm to the\n# antecedent membership degrees. The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\nactivation_level = min(antecedent_1_membership, antecedent_2_membership)\n\n# Print the final result showing the full equation.\nprint(f\"The rule activation level using the minimum t-norm is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"min({antecedent_1_membership}, {antecedent_2_membership}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
