    "In the field of nuclear criticality and reactor physics, the system's behavior is often described by correlation functions. The generalized pair correlation function, which we can denote as $G(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, describes the correlation between particle detections at two different points in space separated by a vector $\\mathbf{r}$ and two different moments in time separated by a delay $t$.\n\nThe space-time, double Fourier transform of this function involves transforming the spatial variable $\\mathbf{r}$ into the wavevector domain (variable $\\mathbf{k}$) and the time variable $t$ into the frequency domain (variable $\\omega$). This mathematical operation is fundamental in analyzing neutron fluctuations, a field known as \"nuclear noise analysis.\"\n\nThe resulting quantity is called the **Dynamic Structure Factor**, denoted as $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$. It represents the power spectral density of fluctuations of a given wavelength ($2\\pi/|\\mathbf{k}|$) and frequency ($\\omega$). It is analogous to the dynamic structure factor used in condensed matter physics to describe the results of inelastic neutron scattering.\n\nThe following Python script prints the name and the defining mathematical equation for this quantity.\n\n```python\ndef print_dynamic_structure_factor_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the name and defining equation for the space-time, double Fourier\n    transform of the generalized pair correlation function.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function G(r, t) is called the Dynamic Structure Factor, denoted as S(k, ω).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe defining equation is presented below.
