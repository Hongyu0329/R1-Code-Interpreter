    "Answering this question requires understanding color gamuts and the process of color space conversion. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a very large gamut, meaning it can represent a wider range of colors than the standard sRGB color space used for web browsers and most computer displays.\n\nWhen a color from a larger gamut (like ROMM RGB) is converted to a smaller gamut (like sRGB), some colors may fall \"out-of-gamut\". This means they cannot be accurately represented in the target color space.\n\nTo determine which of the given colors are out-of-gamut for sRGB, we must perform a standard color space conversion. A color is representable in sRGB if and only if its converted Red, Green, and Blue values are all within the valid range. For a floating-point representation, this range is [0.0, 1.0] for each channel. If any converted channel value is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the original color is out-of-gamut.\n\nThe conversion process from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB involves a series of matrix multiplications:\n1.  First, the ROMM RGB coordinates are converted to the standard CIE XYZ color space (using the D50 illuminant standard to ROMM).\n2.  Second, a chromatic adaptation transformation is applied to the XYZ values to change the white point from D50 to D65 (the standard for sRGB).\n3.  Finally, the D65-adapted XYZ values are converted to linear sRGB values.\n\nThe following Python script automates this process. It defines the necessary transformation matrices, combines them, and applies the transformation to each of the provided colors. It then checks if the resulting linear sRGB values are within the valid [0.0, 1.0] range to determine which colors cannot be represented.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies which ROMM RGB colors are out-of-gamut for sRGB and\n    prints the final list of numbers as the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the transformation matrices for converting ROMM RGB to sRGB\n    # 1.
