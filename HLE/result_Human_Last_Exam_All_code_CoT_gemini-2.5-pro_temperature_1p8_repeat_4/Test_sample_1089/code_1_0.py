    # The question describes a repair that involves the "build-up of layers of filler material".
    # This indicates a need to replace material that has been physically lost.

    # Options Analysis:
    # A, E (Cracking): These are primarily fixed by stopping crack growth, not by building up layers.
    # D (Creep): This is bulk deformation (stretching) and cannot be fixed by welding.
    # F (Corrosion/Oxidation): This is surface degradation, often widespread.
    # B (FOD): Causes nicks/gouges. While weld-repairable, it's less characteristic of turbine sections compared to tip wear.
    # C (Blade Tip Rub and Wear): This is the physical grinding away of material from the blade tip.
    # The repair for this is to weld new material onto the tip to restore its original height.
    # This perfectly matches the "build-up of layers" description.
