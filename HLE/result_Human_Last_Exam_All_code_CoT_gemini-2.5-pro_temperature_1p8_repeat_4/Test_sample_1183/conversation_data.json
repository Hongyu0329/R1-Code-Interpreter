    "To determine the symmetry point group of the molecule, I will first analyze its structure based on the provided SMILES string. Then, I will provide a Python script that programmatically confirms this analysis using standard computational chemistry libraries.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the SMILES string:** The string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` describes a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Visualizing this structure reveals a highly symmetric, trigonal (triangular) shape. My analysis suggests the presence of the following symmetry elements:\n    *   A principal 3-fold rotation axis (C₃) perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   Three 2-fold rotation axes (C₂) lying within the molecular plane.\n    *   A horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that contains the entire molecule.\n    The presence of a C₃ axis with three perpendicular C₂ axes points to a D₃ dihedral group. The addition of a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) raises the symmetry to the **D₃ₕ** point group.\n\n2.  **Propose a Python script for verification:** To computationally confirm this, I will write a Python script that builds a 3D model of the molecule and analyzes its symmetry.\n\n3.  **Script Logic:**\n    *   The script will use the `rdkit` library to convert the SMILES string into a 3D molecular model. This includes adding all hydrogen atoms and optimizing the 3D geometry with a force field to find its most stable, and therefore most symmetric, conformation.\n    *   It will then use the `pymatgen` library, which contains powerful tools for symmetry analysis, to process the 3D coordinates of the atoms.\n    *   Finally, `pymatgen`'s `PointGroupAnalyzer` will determine the Schönflies symbol for the molecule's point group, which the script will print as the output.\n\nThis method provides a robust and reproducible way to determine the molecule's symmetry.\n\n```python\nimport sys\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: RDKit is not installed.
