    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to follow a plan that can handle the extremely large input number.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The core of the problem is calculating `tan(x)` for a very large `x = 10^100`.\n2.  The tangent function has a period of π. This means `tan(x)` is the same as `tan(x mod π)`.\n3.  So, we need to find the remainder of `10^100` when divided by π. This operation is called the modulo operation.\n4.  The number `10^100` (a 1 followed by 100 zeros) is far too large for standard computer floating-point numbers to handle without losing the necessary precision. We must use a library designed for arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Python's `mpmath` library is an excellent tool for this task.\n5.  The steps in the code will be:\n    *   Import the `mpmath` library.\n    *   Set a high precision (e.g., 110 decimal places) to ensure the accuracy of the intermediate calculations.\n    *   Calculate the remainder `r = 10^100 % π` using `mpmath`.\n    *   Calculate `tan(r)`, which will be our final result.\n    *   Extract and print the first three digits after the decimal point from this result.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan. You will need to install the `mpmath` library if you don't have it (`pip install mpmath`).\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# Step 1: Set a high precision for the calculation.\n# The number 10^100 has 101 digits. To find its remainder when divided by pi,\n# we need a high degree of precision to avoid errors. We will set the\n# precision to 110 decimal places.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n# Step 2: Define the very large number x = 10^100 using mpmath's arbitrary-precision floats.\nx = mpmath.power(10, 100)\n\n# Step 3: Use the periodic property of tan(x), which has a period of pi.\n# This means tan(10^100) is equivalent to tan(10^100 mod pi).\n# We calculate the remainder 'r' using mpmath's high-precision pi.\npi_high_precision = mpmath.pi\nremainder = mpmath.fmod(x, pi_high_precision)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the tangent of the remainder.\n# The result of tan(remainder) is the same as tan(10^100).\nresult = mpmath.tan(remainder)\n\n# Step 5: Format and print the output to show the equation with the calculated numbers.\nprint(\"Finding the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100):\")\nprint(f\"tan(10^100) = tan(10^100 mod pi)\")\n# Printing the full numbers would be too long, so we show them with reasonable precision.\nprint(f\"             = tan({mpmath.nstr(remainder, 20)}...)\")\nprint(f\"             = {mpmath.nstr(result, 20)}...\")\n\n# Step 6: Extract the first three digits after the decimal point from the final result.\n# We convert the result to a string to easily slice the part we need.\nresult_str = mpmath.nstr(result, 10)\ndecimal_point_index = result_str.find('.')\nfirst_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe first 3 digits after the comma are: {first_three_digits}\")\n```\n<<<513>>>"
