    "Of course. I can help you with that.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze Coiled-Coil Structure:** The oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a coiled-coil is determined by the identity of amino acids at the core positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The key positions are `a` and `d`, which are typically hydrophobic. The specific pairing of amino acids at these positions dictates the packing geometry and thus the oligomeric state.\n\n2.  **Determine Heptad Phasing:** For the given engineered sequences, the pattern is highly regular. By searching for the hydrophobic residues (`I`, `L`, `A`, `W`), we can determine the phasing of the heptad repeat. The most chemically sensible phasing for these sequences is `g-a-b-c-d-e-f`, where the second residue of each heptad is at the `a` position and the fifth is at the `d` position.\n\n3.  **Apply Prediction Rules:** Based on extensive experimental studies of model peptides (like variants of GCN4), a set of rules can be applied:\n    *   An `Isoleucine (I)` at `a` and `Leucine (L)` at `d` is the canonical signature for a **dimer (2)**.\n    *   An `Isoleucine (I)` at `a` and an `Isoleucine (I)` or `Alanine (A)` at `d` strongly favors a **trimer (3)**.\n    *   A polar residue like `Glutamine (Q)` at `d` also drives trimerization to form a buried \"polar zipper\". This results in a **trimer (3)**.\n    *   A beta-branched polar residue like `Threonine (T)` at `d` forms a \"polar layer\" that is most stable in a **tetramer (4)**.\n\n4.  **Write and Execute Code:** I will write a Python script to automate this process. The script will:\n    *   Define the list of protein sequences.\n    *   For each sequence, identify the key residue at the first `d` position (index 4).\n    *   Apply the rules above to predict the oligomeric state.\n    *   Print the prediction for each sequence and then present the final list of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence based on\n    the residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\n    For these designed sequences, the phasing is g-a-b-c-d-e-f, and the\n    primary determinant is the residue at the first 'd' position (index 4).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The residue at the 'a' position is consistently Isoleucine (I).\n    # The key determining residue is at the first 'd' position.\n    d_residue = sequence[4]\n\n    # Rules are based on empirical data from model coiled-coil studies.\n    if d_residue == 'A':\n        # (a=I, d=A) pair is a known trimer motif.\n        return 3\n    elif d_residue == 'L':\n        # (a=I, d=L) pair is the canonical dimer signature.\n        return 2\n    elif d_residue == 'I':\n        # (a=I, d=I) pair strongly favors trimers.\n        return 3\n    elif d_residue == 'Q':\n        # A polar (Q) residue in the core 'd' position drives trimerization.\n        return 3\n    elif d_residue == 'T':\n        # A polar (T) residue at 'd' is known to form a tetrameric assembly.\n        return 4\n    else:\n        return \"Unknown\"\n\n# List of coiled-coil sequences to analyze\nsequences = [\n    \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\",\n    \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\",\n    \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\",\n    \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\",\n    \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\",\n]\n\n# Store the final results\nfinal_predictions = []\n\nprint(\"Analyzing coiled-coil sequences:\")\nfor i, seq in enumerate(sequences):\n    state = predict_oligomeric_state(seq)\n    final_predictions.append(state)\n    print(f\"Sequence {i+1} ({seq[:7]}...): The predicted oligomeric state is {state}\")\n\n# The final \"equation\" is the sequence of predicted states.\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation of predicted states is:\")\n# Output each number as requested\nequation_str = \", \".join(map(str, final_predictions))\nprint(equation_str)\n```\n<<<E>>>"
