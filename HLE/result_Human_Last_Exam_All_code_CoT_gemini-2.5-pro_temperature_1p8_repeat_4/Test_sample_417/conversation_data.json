    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we will analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central benzene ring with a 1,3,5- and 2,4,6-substitution pattern. This configuration results in a C3 axis of rotational symmetry, which means the three large substituents (the \"arms\") are chemically equivalent, and the three methyl groups on the central ring are also equivalent.\n2.  **Analyze a Single Repeating Unit:** Due to the C3 symmetry, we only need to count the number of unique proton environments in one-third of the molecule. This repeating unit consists of one of the three `2,4,6-trimethylbenzene` core's methyl groups and one of the three `[((...)-yl)methyl]` arms.\n3.  **Count Non-Equivalent Protons:** We will count the unique proton signals from each part of this repeating unit:\n    *   The methyl group on the central benzene ring.\n    *   The `-CH2-` linker group.\n    *   The complex chiral group, `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`, which is derived from camphor. The chirality and rigid structure mean that many protons that might otherwise be equivalent (like the two protons on a `-CH2-` group) are in fact non-equivalent (diastereotopic).\n4.  **Sum the Signals:** The total number of signals will be the sum of the signals from each distinct part of the repeating unit.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to calculate the total number of expected 1H NMR signals.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define a function to calculate and explain the NMR signals.\ndef calculate_nmr_signals():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR signals for the given molecule\n    by analyzing its symmetry and counting the non-equivalent protons.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the molecule: 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\\n\")\n    print(\"The molecule has C3 symmetry.

In the chiral environment, all four\n    # protons are chemically distinct and non-equivalent.\n    signals_skeleton_ch2 = 4\n    print(f\"Signals from bicyclic skeleton's two -CH2- groups: {signals_skeleton_ch2}\")\n    \n    # The fragment has three methyl groups ('7,8,8-trimethyl'). One is on a bridgehead (C7),\n    # and two are a gem-dimethyl pair on the methano bridge (C8).
