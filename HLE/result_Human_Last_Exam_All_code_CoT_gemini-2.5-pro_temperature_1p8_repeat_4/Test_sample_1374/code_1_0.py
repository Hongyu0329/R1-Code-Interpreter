    Calculates the maximum distance from a point A to the surface of a playdough shape
    that is optimized to create the strongest possible gravitational field at A.

    The steps are:
    1. The optimal shape's surface is described by r^2 = k * cos(theta).
    2. The volume of this shape is V = (4 * pi / 15) * k^(3/2).
    3. Given V = 1 m^3, we solve for k.
    4. The furthest point (r_max) on the surface occurs when cos(theta) is maximum (i.e., 1).
    5. So, r_max^2 = k, which means r_max = sqrt(k).
    6. Substituting k gives the final formula: r_max = (15 / (4 * pi))^(1/3).
