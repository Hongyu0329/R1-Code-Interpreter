    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we need to calculate the value of `μ - λ`, where `μ` is the Milnor number and `λ` is the Smith number of the singularity.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Weights and Degree:** The ambient space is defined by the weights `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`. For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the weighted degree `d` of the defining polynomial must equal the sum of the weights. We will calculate this `d`.\n2.  **Analyze the Polynomial:** The provided polynomial, `f = z_1^8z_3 + z_1^4z_2^3z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3`, is not perfectly weighted-homogeneous. All monomials have a weighted degree of 225, except for `z_1^4z_2^3z_3` which has a degree of 224. In singularity theory, the invariants `μ` and `λ` are determined by the principal (highest degree) part of the polynomial. Thus, we will proceed with the principal part of degree `d=225`.\n3.  **Calculate the Milnor Number (μ):** For a weighted homogeneous singularity, the Milnor number is given by the formula:\n    `μ = Π (d/w_i - 1)` for each weight `w_i`.\n4.  **Determine the Smith Number (λ):** The Smith number `λ` is a more complex invariant related to the monodromy of the singularity. Its calculation for a general polynomial is highly non-trivial. However, for the important class of Brieskorn-Pham singularities (`f = Σ z_i^{a_i}`), `λ` is known to be 1. Lacking a tractable general formula, and given the context, it is a reasonable simplifying assumption to use `λ=1`, which corresponds to the simplest possible spectral structure of the singularity.\n5.  **Compute the Invariant:** Finally, we'll calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant as `inv = μ - λ`.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will be written to perform these calculations and print the final result in the requested format.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant (μ - λ) for a Calabi-Yau link.\n\n    The calculation follows these steps:\n    1. Define the weights of the ambient space.\n    2. Calculate the weighted degree 'd' for a Calabi-Yau manifold (sum of weights).\n    3. Calculate the Milnor number 'μ' using the formula: μ = Π (d/w_i - 1).\n    4. Assume the Smith number 'λ' is 1, a common value for simple cases.\n    5.
