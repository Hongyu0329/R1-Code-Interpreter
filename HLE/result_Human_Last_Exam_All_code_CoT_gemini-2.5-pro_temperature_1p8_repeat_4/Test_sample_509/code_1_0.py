The question asks for a condition under which the projection map pi_{k,l} from the configuration space of l points to k points admits a homotopy section.

A homotopy section s: conf_k(M) -> conf_l(M) is a map such that pi_{k,l} composed with s is homotopic to the identity. The existence of such a map is a question in algebraic topology, addressed by obstruction theory.

The key is to analyze the properties of the fibration:
pi_{k,l}: conf_l(M) -> conf_k(M)

The fiber F of this fibration is the space conf_{l-k}(M \\ {k points}). The obstructions to constructing a section (a stronger condition) lie in cohomology groups H^{i+1}(conf_k(M), pi_i(F)).

The condition that M has a trivial fundamental group (M is simply connected, pi_1(M) = 0) is a very powerful condition.
1. If dim(M) >= 3, being simply connected implies that M \\ {k points} is also simply connected. This often leads to the vanishing of the lower-dimensional homotopy groups of the fiber F, which in turn causes the obstructions to vanish. For example, the first obstruction lives in H^2(conf_k(M), pi_1(F)). If M is simply connected and dim(M) >= 3, it can be shown that pi_1(F) is often trivial, nullifying this first obstruction. In fact, a strict section exists for closed, simply connected manifolds of dimension >= 3.
2. If dim(M) = 2, the only closed, simply connected manifold is the 2-sphere S^2. For the map pi_{1,2}, the fiber is S^2 \\ {1 point}, which is contractible. A fibration with a contractible fiber is a homotopy equivalence, so it admits a homotopy section.

While not a necessary condition (e.g., the torus T^2 is not simply connected but has a section), being simply connected is a strong sufficient condition that simplifies the topology of the configuration spaces, making it the most plausible choice among the options.

The second part of option C, "allowing continuous mappings to be homotopically equivalent to identity," is unusual phrasing but points towards the topological simplicity implied by a trivial fundamental group. For instance, any map from a circle S^1 into a simply connected space M is null-homotopic (homotopic to a constant map).
