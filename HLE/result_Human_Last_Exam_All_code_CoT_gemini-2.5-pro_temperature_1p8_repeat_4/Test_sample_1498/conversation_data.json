    "Of course. The names of the 25 Prophets in Islam are mentioned in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) over the course of four verses, known as *bayts*.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first state the range of the bayts (verses) where the names of the Prophets are listed.\n2.  I will then provide the Arabic text and a translation of each of these four bayts.\n3.  The Python code below will print this information clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_in_poem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and displays the verses (bayts) in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the Prophets in Islam.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_bayt = 23\n    end_bayt = 26\n\n    print(f\"The names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Dictionary containing the verses and their translations\n    verses = {\n        23: {\n            \"arabic\": \"هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ * صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",\n            \"translation\": \"They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.\"\n        },\n        24: {\n            \"arabic\": \"لُوْطٌ وَاِسْمَاعِيْلُ اِسْحَاقُ كَذَا * يَعْقُوبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى\",\n            \"translation\": \"Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq likewise, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed suit.\"\n        },\n        25: {\n            \"arabic\": \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ * ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",\n            \"translation\": \"Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa and Al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.\"\n        },\n        26: {\n            \"arabic\": \"اِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\",\n            \"translation\": \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (Muhammad), the seal; leave misguidance.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Print each verse\n    for number, content in verses.items():\n        print(f\"\\nBayt {number}:\")\n        print(f\"  {content['arabic']}\")\n        print(f\"  Translation: {content['translation']}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_prophets_in_poem()\n\n<<<From bayt 23 to 26>>>\n```"
