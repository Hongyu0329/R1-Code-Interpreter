    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: We need to determine the specific structure of a \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\". A standard and simple interpretation of a barbell graph is two complete graphs of equal size connected by a single edge. For 10 total nodes, this means we have two 5-node complete graphs (K₅). The single edge connecting them is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n\n2.  **Understand the Process**: \"Randomized uniform gossiping\" is a specific process. In each step:\n    a. A node is selected uniformly at random from all `N` nodes in the graph. The probability of picking any specific node `i` is `1/N`.\n    b. The selected node `i` then selects one of its neighbors, `j`, uniformly at random. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor `j` is `1/d(i)`, where `d(i)` is the degree (number of neighbors) of node `i`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability**: We want the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge, let's call it `(u, v)`. This can happen in two ways:\n    a. We select node `u` first, and then it selects its neighbor `v`.\n    b. We select node `v` first, and then it selects its neighbor `u`.\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events.\n    `P(sample edge (u,v)) = P(select u) * P(u selects v) + P(select v) * P(v selects u)`\n\n4.  **Determine Necessary Values**:\n    *   `N`: The total number of nodes is 10.\n    *   `d(u)`: Node `u` is in one K₅ and connected to the other via the bottleneck. Its degree is 4 (from connections within its K₅) + 1 (the bottleneck edge) = 5.\n    *   `d(v)`: Similarly, the degree of node `v` is 5.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Probability**:\n    *   `P(sample edge (u,v)) = (1/N) * (1/d(u)) + (1/N) * (1/d(v))`\n    *   `P = (1/10) * (1/5) + (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the steps.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters of the barbell graph\ntotal_nodes_N = 10\n# For a 10-node barbell, the most symmetric structure is two 5-node cliques\nclique_size_k = 5\n\n# The barbell graph is formed by connecting two complete graphs (cliques) K_k\n# with a single \"bottleneck\" edge. Let the nodes of this edge be u and v.\n\n# Calculate the degree of the nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n# The degree is the number of connections within the clique (k-1) plus the\n# one connection through the bottleneck edge.\ndegree_u = (clique_size_k - 1) + 1\ndegree_v = degree_u # By symmetry\n\n# In randomized uniform gossiping, a node is chosen uniformly at random (with probability 1/N),\n# and then one of its neighbors is chosen uniformly at random (with probability 1/degree).\n\n# The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (u, v) is the sum of two cases:\n# 1. Node u is chosen, and it picks neighbor v.\n# 2. Node v is chosen, and it picks neighbor u.\n# The formula is: P = (1/N) * (1/d(u)) + (1/N) * (1/d(v))\n\n# Calculate the final probability\nprob_u_picks_v = (1 / total_nodes_N) * (1 / degree_u)\nprob_v_picks_u = (1 / total_nodes_N) * (1 / degree_v)\ntotal_prob = prob_u_picks_v + prob_v_picks_u\n\nprint(\"To find the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph:\")\nprint(f\"1.
