    "My plan is to find the answer to your question by searching my knowledge base for information about the plot of the 1997 movie \"Ovosodo\". I will then present this information using a simple Python script that prints the name of the US city the character Tommaso moves to.\n\n```python\ndef find_destination_city():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the name of the US city\n    Tommaso moves to in the movie Ovosodo.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie = \"Ovosodo\"\n    character = \"Tommaso\"\n    destination_city = \"Philadelphia\"\n\n    print(f\"In the movie '{movie}', the character {character} moves to the US city of {destination_city}.\")\n\nfind_destination_city()\n```\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
