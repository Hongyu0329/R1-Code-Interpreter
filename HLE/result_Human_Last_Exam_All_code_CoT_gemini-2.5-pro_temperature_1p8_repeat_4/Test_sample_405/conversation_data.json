    "Here is my plan to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus:\n\n1.  **Identify the major allotropes of phosphorus.** These are the distinct structural forms of the element.\n2.  **List the characteristic color of each allotrope.**\n    *   White Phosphorus is a waxy solid that is white but can appear yellowish.\n    *   Red Phosphorus is a reddish-brown powder.\n    *   Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's phosphorus) is a crystalline form with a distinct violet or purple color.\n    *   Black Phosphorus is the most stable form and has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite.\n    *   Blue Phosphorus is a 2D allotrope (like graphene) with a blue color.\n3.  **Count the number of distinct colors identified.** Each of these allotropes presents a unique color.\n4.  **Create a Python script** that will enumerate these colors, display them as an equation, and print the total count.\n\n```python\n# The major allotropes of phosphorus and their distinct colors.\ncolors_of_phosphorus = {\n    \"White Phosphorus\": \"White/Yellow\",\n    \"Red Phosphorus\": \"Red\",\n    \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"Violet\",\n    \"Black Phosphorus\": \"Black\",\n    \"Blue Phosphorus\": \"Blue\"\n}\n\n# The number of distinct colors is the number of allotropes listed.\ncount = len(colors_of_phosphorus)\n\n# Build the equation string\nequation_parts = []\nfor allotrope in colors_of_phosphorus:\n    equation_parts.append(f\"1 ({allotrope})\")\n\nequation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(\"The calculation for the number of observable colors in phosphorus allotropes is:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_string} = {count}\")\n<<<5>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
