def solve_scattering_statements():
    """
    This function identifies the correct statements about two-channel quantum scattering.

    The logic is as follows:
    - Statement 1 is correct: The contrapositive holds (trivially coupled V implies trivially coupled S).
    - Statement 2 is incorrect: A diagonal S-matrix can correspond to a non-diagonal but trivially coupled potential, or even a non-trivially coupled "transparent" potential.
    - Statement 3 is incorrect: "Transparent potentials" are a known class of non-trivially coupled potentials that produce diagonal (and thus trivially coupled) Jost matrices.
    - Statement 4 is correct: The algebraic mapping from the Jost matrix F(E) to the S-matrix S(E) preserves the coupling nature.
    - Statement 5 is correct: The existence of "transparent potentials" confirms this. These are non-trivially coupled potentials with diagonal Jost matrices.
