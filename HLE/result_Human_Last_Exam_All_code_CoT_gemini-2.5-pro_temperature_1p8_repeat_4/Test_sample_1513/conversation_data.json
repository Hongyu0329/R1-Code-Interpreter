    "To solve this geographical riddle, I will use a Python script to filter a list of candidate remote island towns based on the given criteria.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a data structure (a list of dictionaries) containing information about several remote island towns. Each town's data will include its name, remoteness, and geological features of its bay.\n2.  Iterate through this list of candidates.\n3.  For each candidate, I will check if it meets all three conditions from the riddle:\n    *   Is it more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island?\n    *   Does its bay have a volcanic caldera origin?\n    *   Does the bay share the same name as the town?\n4.  The script will then print the name of the town that satisfies all these conditions.\n\n```python\ndef find_island_town():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a remote island town based on specific geographical criteria by filtering a list of candidates.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of dictionaries representing candidate island towns and their properties.\n    # The 'bay_is_caldera' key is a simplification representing if the bay is formed by or directly associated with a caldera.\n    candidates = [\n        {\n            'town_name': 'Hanga Roa',\n            'remoteness_km': 2075,\n            'bay_shares_name': True,\n            'bay_is_caldera': True,\n            'details': 'Town is Hanga Roa, bay is Hanga Roa Bay.
