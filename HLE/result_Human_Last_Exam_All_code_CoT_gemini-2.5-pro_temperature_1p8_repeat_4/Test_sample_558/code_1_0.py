# Step 1: Identify the opera based on Marietta Alboni's 1843 performance at La Scala.
opera_name = "Linda di Chamounix"
singer_alboni = "Marietta Alboni"
year_alboni_performance = 1843
location_alboni_performance = "La Scala, Milan"

# Step 2: Identify Caruso's performance of this opera at the Met.
singer_caruso = "Enrico Caruso"
year_caruso_performance = 1916
location_caruso_performance = "Metropolitan Opera, New York"

# Step 3: Calculate the year for the subsequent revival.
time_gap_years = 70
revival_year_after = year_caruso_performance + time_gap_years

# Step 4: Find the specific New York City production that fits the timeline.
# Research shows a notable performance by the Opera Orchestra of New York.
revival_year_actual = 1997
revival_location = "Carnegie Hall, New York City"
revival_organization = "Opera Orchestra of New York"

# Step 5: Identify the bass singer from that 1997 production.
# The bass role in "Linda di Chamounix" is 'Il Prefetto' (The Prefect).
bass_singer_name = "Paul Plishka"

# Final Output: Print the step-by-step logic and the final answer.
