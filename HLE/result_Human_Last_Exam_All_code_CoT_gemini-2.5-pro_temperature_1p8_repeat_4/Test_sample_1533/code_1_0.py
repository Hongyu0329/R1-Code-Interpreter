    This function solves the geometry problem step-by-step and prints the final derived ratio.
    In a triangle ABC, the angle bisectors of <BAC and <ABC intersect at a point I.
    Let BI intersect the circumcircle of triangle ABC at a point M.
    We need to express the ratio BM/MI in terms of the side lengths a, b, and c.

    Let a, b, c be the lengths of sides BC, CA, and AB respectively.
    Let the angles at vertices A, B, C be alpha, beta, gamma respectively.

    # Step 1: Prove MA = MI (A key geometric property)
    # We will show that triangle AIM is an isosceles triangle.
    # Let's find the angles <MAI and <MIA.
    # <CAM = <CBM (angles subtended by the same arc CM on the circumcircle).
    # Since BI is the angle bisector of angle B, <CBM = beta/2. Thus, <CAM = beta/2.
    # <CAI = alpha/2 (since AI is the angle bisector of angle A).
    # Therefore, <MAI = <CAM + <CAI = beta/2 + alpha/2.
    #
    # Now, let's find <MIA.
    # In triangle AIB, <AIB = 180 - (<IAB + <IBA) = 180 - (alpha/2 + beta/2).
    # Since B, I, M are collinear, <AIB and <AIM are supplementary.
    # So, <AIM = 180 - <AIB = 180 - (180 - (alpha/2 + beta/2)) = alpha/2 + beta/2.
    #
    # Since <MAI = <MIA, triangle AIM is isosceles with MA = MI.
    # This is a crucial simplification.

    # Step 2: Express the target ratio using the result from Step 1.
    # The ratio is BM/MI.
    # Since M is on the line segment extending from BI, BM = BI + IM.
    # So, BM/MI = (BI + IM) / MI = BI/MI + 1.
    # Since MI = MA, the ratio is BI/MA + 1.

    # Step 3: Find expressions for BI and MA.
    # Let r be the inradius and R be the circumradius of triangle ABC.
    # In the right triangle formed by I, B, and the incircle tangent on AB,
    # sin(beta/2) = r / BI  => BI = r / sin(beta/2).
    #
    # In triangle ABM, by the extended Law of Sines:
    # MA / sin(<ABM) = 2R.
    # <ABM is the angle of the line BM with AB, which is beta/2.
    # MA = 2R * sin(beta/2).

    # Step 4: Compute the ratio BI/MA.
    # BI/MA = (r / sin(beta/2)) / (2R * sin(beta/2)) = r / (2R * sin(beta/2)^2).
    # We know r = 4R * sin(alpha/2) * sin(beta/2) * sin(gamma/2).
    # Substituting r:
    # BI/MA = (4R * sin(alpha/2) * sin(beta/2) * sin(gamma/2)) / (2R * sin(beta/2)^2)
    # BI/MA = (2 * sin(alpha/2) * sin(gamma/2)) / sin(beta/2).

    # Step 5: Convert the expression to side lengths a, b, c.
    # We use the half-angle formulas in terms of the semi-perimeter s = (a+b+c)/2:
    # sin(alpha/2) = sqrt(((s-b)*(s-c))/(b*c))
    # sin(beta/2)  = sqrt(((s-a)*(s-c))/(a*c))
    # sin(gamma/2) = sqrt(((s-a)*(s-b))/(a*b))
    #
    # BI/MA = 2 * sqrt(((s-b)*(s-c))/(b*c)) * sqrt(((s-a)*(s-b))/(a*b)) / sqrt(((s-a)*(s-c))/(a*c))
    # After simplification, this yields:
    # BI/MA = 2 * sqrt(((s-b)^2)/(b^2)) = 2 * (s-b)/b.
    #
    # Substitute s = (a+b+c)/2:
    # BI/MA = 2 * (((a+b+c)/2) - b) / b = (a+b+c - 2b) / b = (a+c-b)/b.

    # Step 6: Calculate the final ratio.
    # BM/MI = BI/MA + 1 = ((a+c-b)/b) + 1 = (a+c-b+b)/b = (a+c)/b.
