    "Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD) was the theologian who developed a sophisticated framework to understand such events. He proposed the concept of ***rationes seminales***, or \"seminal reasons\" (sometimes translated as \"causal principles\" or \"seed principles\").\n\nHe argued that in the initial act of creation, God embedded latent potentialities within nature itself. These were the \"seeds\" of everything that would ever come to be.\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** In Augustine's view, the virgin birth was not God violating the natural laws He established. Instead, it was the activation of a potentiality (*ratio seminalis*) that He had placed within human nature from the very beginning. While miraculous and unique, it was an unfolding of a possibility already contained within God's created order, not an external contradiction of it.\n\n*   **Changes at the Fall:** Similarly, the negative changes to the natural world after the Fall (e.g., decay, toil, thorns and thistles) could be understood as the activation of different, negative seminal reasons that were triggered by human sin. This allowed for a persistent change in how nature operates without requiring God to constantly intervene or rewrite fundamental laws.\n\nThis framework allowed Augustine to describe apparent \"changes in the laws of nature\" as the predetermined unfolding of potentials that were always part of the deepest fabric of creation.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
