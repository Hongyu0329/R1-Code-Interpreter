    "My plan is to first research the common name for the genus \"Perdita\" and the year it was established. The most authoritative source for common names of North American bees is often considered the book \"The Bees in Your Backyard\" by Joseph S. Wilson and Olivia Messinger Carril, which proposed a standardized list. I will find the name and publication year from this source. Then, I will write a Python script to store this information in variables and print it in the requested format: \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n```python\ndef get_perdita_common_name_info():\n  \"\"\"\n  Provides the common name and year it was coined for the bee genus Perdita.\n\n  The common name \"Fairy Bees\" was systematically proposed for the genus Perdita\n  in the influential book \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\"\n  by Joseph S.
