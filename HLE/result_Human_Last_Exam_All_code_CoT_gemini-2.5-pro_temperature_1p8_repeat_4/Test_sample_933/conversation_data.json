    "To determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄), we need to review its common production methods.\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Compound and Synthesis Reaction:** The compound is Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄). The most common method for its production is the direct reaction between Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F₂) gas. The balanced chemical equation for this synthesis is:\n    Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction Conditions:** This reaction is exothermic, but it requires an initial input of energy (activation energy) to proceed at a reasonable rate. The reaction conditions, particularly temperature, are crucial for controlling the product.\n    *   To produce **XeF₄**, a mixture of Xenon and Fluorine (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio to ensure an excess of fluorine) is heated in a nickel vessel to **400 °C**.\n    *   If the temperature is significantly higher (e.g., 600 °C), the main product becomes Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n    *   If the temperature is significantly lower, the reaction rate becomes very slow, making the process inefficient.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. 600 °C: Too hot, favors XeF₆ production.\n    *   B. 400 °C: The standard, optimal temperature for efficient XeF₄ synthesis.\n    *   C, D, E, F: These lower temperatures are generally insufficient for the direct thermal reaction to be considered \"efficient.\"\n\nTherefore, 400 °C is the coldest temperature in the given list at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently.\n\nThe following Python code explains this reasoning and prints the numbers from the balanced chemical equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chemistry_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) to find the optimal temperature\n    from the given choices and explains the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Xenon tetrafluoride\"\n    formula = \"XeF4\"\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the efficient synthesis of {compound_name} ({formula})...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"The most common industrial method is the direct heating of Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F2) gases.\")\n    \n    # Balanced chemical equation: 1Xe + 2F2 -> 1XeF4\n    equation_info = {\n        'Reactant 1': 'Xe',\n        'Coefficient 1': 1,\n        'Reactant 2': 'F2',\n        'Coefficient 2': 2,\n        'Product': 'XeF4',\n        'Coefficient 3': 1,\n        'Subscript in Product': 4\n    }\n\n    print(\"\\nThe balanced chemical equation for the synthesis is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_info['Coefficient 1']}{equation_info['Reactant 1']} + {equation_info['Coefficient 2']}{equation_info['Reactant 2']} -> {equation_info['Coefficient 3']}{equation_info['Product']}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAs requested, here are the numbers from the final equation:\")\n    print(f\"Coefficient of Xe: {equation_info['Coefficient 1']}\")\n    print(f\"Coefficient of F2: {equation_info['Coefficient 2']}\")\n    print(f\"Coefficient of XeF4: {equation_info['Coefficient 3']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Fluorine atoms in XeF4: {equation_info['Subscript in Product']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Reaction condition analysis\n    optimal_temp = 400  # in Celsius\n    print(\"Reaction Condition Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"The synthesis is typically carried out at {optimal_temp}°C in a nickel container.\")\n    print(\"- At much higher temperatures (e.g., 600°C), Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) is the predominant product.\")\n    print(\"- At much lower temperatures, the reaction rate is too slow for the process to be considered efficient.\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nConclusion: Based on the standard synthesis methods, {optimal_temp}°C is the coldest temperature in the provided list for producing {formula} efficiently.\")\n    \n    # Matching with provided answer choices\n    answer_choices = {'A': 600, 'B': 400, 'C': 200, 'D': 78, 'E': 0, 'F': -78}\n    correct_choice = None\n    for choice, temp in answer_choices.items():\n        if temp == optimal_temp:\n            correct_choice = choice\n            break\n            \n    if correct_choice:\n        print(f\"This temperature corresponds to answer choice {correct_choice}.\")\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"\\n<<<B>>>\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The optimal temperature was not found in the answer choices.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_question()\n```"
