The patient's clinical history strongly suggests a diagnosis of Disseminated Nocardiosis. Here is the reasoning:

1.  **Immunocompromised Host:** The patient was started on steroids for his initial symptoms. Steroids suppress the immune system, making a person highly vulnerable to opportunistic infections like Nocardia. His age, smoking history, and potential underlying lung disease also contributed to his susceptibility.

2.  **Primary Site of Infection:** Nocardiosis typically begins as a pulmonary infection. The patient's chest X-ray showing multiple pulmonary nodules is a classic initial presentation.

3.  **Pattern of Dissemination:** When Nocardia spreads from the lungs, it has a strong predilection for the brain and the skin. The patient's development of confusion (suggesting central nervous system involvement) and cutaneous lesions fits this pattern perfectly.

4.  **Ineffective Treatment:** Nocardia infections require specific antibiotic therapy, most commonly with sulfonamides (like trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). The fact that the patient's condition did not improve and he progressed to septic shock despite receiving aminoglycoside therapy is a crucial clue, as Nocardia is often resistant to this class of antibiotics.

The combination of an immunocompromised state with a disseminated infection involving the lungs, skin, and central nervous system is the classic triad for Disseminated Nocardiosis.
