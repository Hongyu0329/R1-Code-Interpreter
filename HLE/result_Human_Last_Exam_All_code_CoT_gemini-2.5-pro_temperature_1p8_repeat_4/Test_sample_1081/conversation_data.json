    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori for a group of type $E_8$.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Question:** The phrase \"the exact number\" in the question suggests an integer constant that is independent of the field size $q$. In the context of algebraic groups over finite fields, this typically refers to counting objects up to conjugacy, rather than the total count. Therefore, I will interpret the question as asking for the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori. The absolute number of such tori is actually $q^N$, where $N=240$ is the number of roots for $E_8$, which is not a fixed integer.\n2.  **Connect to Weyl Group Theory:** The Lang-Steinberg theorem provides a fundamental connection: the set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is in bijection with the set of $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$. An $F$-conjugacy class is an equivalence class under the relation $w \\sim x w F(x)^{-1}$ for $w, x \\in W$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism.\n3.  **Specialize to Group Type $E_8$:** A group of type $E_8$ is 'split' over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is because its Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial symmetries, meaning there are no 'twisted' forms. For a split group, the Frobenius map $F$ acts trivially on the corresponding Weyl group, i.e., $F(x) = x$ for all $x \\in W$.\n4.  **Simplify the Problem:** With a trivial Frobenius action, the $F$-conjugacy relation $w \\sim x w F(x)^{-1}$ simplifies to the standard group conjugacy relation $w \\sim x w x^{-1}$. Thus, the problem reduces to finding the number of ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n5.  **State the Known Result:** The number of conjugacy classes for the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a well-established result in computational group theory and representation theory. This number is 112.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will provide a Python script that states this result and prints the answer in the form of an equation as requested by the prompt.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the final answer.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori classes\n# for a reductive group G of type E_8 over the finite field F_q.\n\n# The number of such classes is equal to the number of conjugacy classes\n# of the Weyl group of type E_8, denoted W(E_8).\nnum_conjugacy_classes_W_E8 = 112\n\n# The problem is interpreted as finding the number of G(F_q)-conjugacy classes of\n# F_q-rational maximal tori. This number is constant and independent of q.\n\n# The final equation is derived from the fact that for a split group like E_8,\n# the number of tori classes equals the number of Weyl group conjugacy classes.\n#\n# Equation:\n# Number of rational maximal tori classes = Number of W(E_8) conjugacy classes\n# Number of rational maximal tori classes = 112\n\nprint(\"The final equation for the number of classes of rational maximal tori is:\")\n\n# We output the final equation with the computed number.\nprint(f\"Number of rational maximal tori classes = {num_conjugacy_classes_W_E8}\")\n\n```\n<<<112>>>"
