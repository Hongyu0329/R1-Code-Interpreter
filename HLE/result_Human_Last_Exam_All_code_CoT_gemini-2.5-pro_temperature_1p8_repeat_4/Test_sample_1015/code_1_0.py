    Understanding the Cambré Derrière in Vaganova vs. Balanchine:

    1. Vaganova Method: This Russian method emphasizes precision, strength, and purity of line. In a cambré derrière, the goal is to maintain a stable and square pelvis. The bend initiates from the upper back, and the hips are kept aligned with the shoulders as much as possible. This creates a pure, elegant arch based on spinal flexibility.

    2. Balanchine Method: Developed for the New York City Ballet, this American style is known for its speed, musicality, and dynamic, often off-balance lines. The Balanchine cambré derrière is famous for its distinct hip placement. The dancer is encouraged to push the hip of the supporting leg forward. This "breaks" the square alignment of the pelvis, allowing for a deeper, more dynamic curve and creating a characteristic spiral effect through the body.

    Evaluating the Choices:
    A. Arm placement during allongé: While stylistic nuances exist, this is not the primary, defining difference.
    B. Placement of hip: This is the most significant and well-known distinction. Vaganova stresses square hips, while Balanchine specifically teaches a pushed-forward hip. This fundamentally changes the aesthetic and mechanics of the step.
    C. Speed: While Balanchine's style is generally faster, a cambré can be performed at any speed in either method depending on the choreographic context.
    D. Degree of backbend: The ultimate depth of the backbend depends on a dancer's individual flexibility, not a prescription of the method. The difference lies in the technique used to achieve the bend.
    E. Placement of head: The head follows the line of the body and arms. The differing head placements are a consequence of the more fundamental difference in torso and hip alignment.

    Conclusion: The most defining technical difference is the placement of the hip.
