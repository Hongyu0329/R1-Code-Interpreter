# Plan:
# 1. Map variation (1) 'sul ponticello' to the correct parameter group. 
#    - This technique changes the harmonic content, making it brighter. This is controlled by Î½. Group ii.
# 2. Map variation (2) 'bridge mute' to the correct parameter group and identify the direction of change.
#    - A mute adds mass to the bridge, damping vibrations and lowering resonance frequencies. This affects the body resonances (f_m). Group iv is a good representative for changes to higher resonances. Adding mass lowers frequency, so f_2 goes down. Group iv, down.
# 3. Map variation (3) 'room filled with helium' to the correct parameter group.
#    - The speed of sound in helium is much higher than in air, which increases the frequency of the violin's internal air resonance (f_1). Group iii.
# 4. Map variation (4) 'on the E string' to the correct parameter group.
#    - The open string is changed from A to E, which changes the fundamental frequency of the open string, F. Group i.
# 5. Assemble the final string in the format 'group1,group2,group3,group4,direction'.
#    - The resulting order is ii, iv, iii, i. The direction for the second item is 'down'.
# 6. Print the final answer string.

answer = "ii,iv,iii,i,down"
