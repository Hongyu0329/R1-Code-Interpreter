    "This is a film trivia question. The scene described occurs in the 2006 Oscar-nominated film *Babel*. The character is the nanny, Amelia, played by Adriana Barraza. After being found in the desert by a U.S. Border Patrol officer, her polite \"Thank you\" for a bottle of water, spoken in English, raises the officer's suspicion, which ultimately leads to her deportation. The film ends with her boarding a bus at the border, her fate sealed.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to print the name of this film.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking to identify a film from a scene description.\n# The scene described is from the film \"Babel\".\n# This script will print the name of the film.\n\nfilm_name = \"Babel\"\nprint(f\"The film described is: {film_name}\")\n```\n<<<Babel>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Oscar-nominated film does a character seal his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
