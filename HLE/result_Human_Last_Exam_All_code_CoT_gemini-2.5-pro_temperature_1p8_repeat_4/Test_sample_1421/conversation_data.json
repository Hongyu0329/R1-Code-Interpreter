    "Of course. The fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields. A key feature is that the fermionic fields must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the partition function `Z` as a functional integral.\n2.  The integration is over Grassmann fields `ψ` and `ψ̄`.\n3.  The integrand is the exponential of the negative Euclidean action `S_E`.\n4.  The action `S_E` is the integral of the Lagrangian density over imaginary time `τ` from 0 to `β` (where `β = 1/(k_B T)`) and over spatial coordinates `x`.\n5.  Specify the anti-periodic boundary condition: `ψ(τ, x) = -ψ(τ + β, x)`.\n6.  A python script will be used to print out the final formula.\n\n```python\ndef print_fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the components of the formula\n    Z = \"Z\"\n    integral_symbol = \"∫\"\n    integration_measure = \"Dψ̄Dψ\"\n    exponent = \"e\"\n    action = \"S_E[ψ̄, ψ]\"\n    action_definition_integral = \"∫ dτ from 0 to β ∫ d³x\"\n    lagrangian_density = \"L_E\"\n    lagrangian_expression = \"ψ̄(τ,x)(∂_τ + H)ψ(τ,x)\"\n    boundary_condition = \"ψ(τ, x) = -ψ(τ + β, x)\"\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the components\n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function Z is a functional integral over Grassmann fields ψ and ψ̄.\")\n    print(\"The key components are:\")\n    print(f\"Partition function: {Z}\")\n    print(f\"Functional integral: {integral_symbol} {integration_measure}\")\n    print(f\"Boltzmann factor: {exponent}^(-{action})\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere the Euclidean action S_E is:\")\n    print(f\"{action} = {action_definition_integral} {lagrangian_density}\")\n    print(f\"And the Euclidean Lagrangian density (example for a single particle Hamiltonian H) is:\")\n    print(f\"{lagrangian_density} = {lagrangian_expression}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis integral is taken over fields that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time τ:\")\n    print(f\"Boundary Condition: {boundary_condition}\")\n    \n    # Assemble and print the final compact formula\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(\"The final formula is:\")\n    # Print each part of the final equation\n    print(\"Z = \", end=\"\")\n    print(f\"{integral_symbol} \", end=\"\")\n    print(f\"{integration_measure} \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"e^\", end=\"\")\n    print(\"-[\", end=\"\")\n    print(\"∫_0^β dτ \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"∫ d³x \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"ψ̄(∂_τ + H)ψ\", end=\"\")\n    print(\"]\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n\nprint_fermionic_partition_function_formula()\n\n# Extracting the core formula for the final answer\n# Z = ∫ Dψ̄Dψ exp[ -∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ψ̄(τ,x)(∂_τ + H)ψ(τ,x) ]\n# This must be accompanied by the anti-periodic boundary condition ψ(τ,x) = -ψ(τ+β, x)\nfinal_formula = \"Z = ∫ Dψ̄Dψ e^(-∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ψ̄(τ,x)(∂_τ + H)ψ(τ,x)) with boundary condition ψ(τ, x) = -ψ(τ + β, x)\"\n# Let's print the final answer tag below\n```\n<<<Z = ∫ Dψ̄Dψ e^(-∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ψ̄(τ,x)(∂_τ + H)ψ(τ,x)), subject to the anti-periodic boundary condition ψ(τ, x) = -ψ(τ + β, x).>>>"
