def find_unlikely_tribes():
    """
    Identifies the indices of insect tribes whose immatures are unlikely to be
    collected using a beat-sheet method.

    The beat-sheet method works by shaking or beating foliage to dislodge insects.
    Therefore, it is ineffective for immatures that are:
    - Endophytic (living inside plants, e.g., borers)
    - Living in soil or detritus
    - Living in protected nests or hives

    Tribe analysis:
    1) Apis: Immatures (larvae) are in protected hives. Unlikely.
    2) Melipotini: Immatures (caterpillars) feed on foliage. Likely.
    3) Eupholini: Immatures (larvae) are typically internal plant borers. Unlikely.
    4) Acritini: Immatures (larvae) live in decaying matter, not on foliage. Unlikely.
    5) Oxyptilini: Immatures (caterpillars) feed on foliage. Likely.
    6) Dictyophorini: Immatures (nymphs) live and feed on foliage. Likely.
    7) Acanthocerini: Immatures (larvae/grubs) live in soil or rotting wood. Unlikely.

    The indices of the unlikely tribes are 1, 3, 4, and 7.
