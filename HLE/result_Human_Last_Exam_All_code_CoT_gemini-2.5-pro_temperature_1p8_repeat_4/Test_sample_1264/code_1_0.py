    Solves the music theory puzzle about "All The Things You Are" in A minor.
    
    The logic is as follows:
    1.  The key is specified as A minor.
    2.  The transition is from the end of the A section to the start of the B section (bridge).
    3.  A standard harmonic function to end a section in a minor key is the V7 chord, which in A minor is E7. The defining note of this chord that gives it its "pull" to the tonic A is the leading tone, G-sharp.
    4.  A common and effective harmonic choice for the start of the bridge is a move to the bIVmaj7 chord, which in this key is Dbmaj7.
    5.  The Dbmaj7 chord contains the note A-flat as its fifth.
    6.  The note G-sharp from the E7 chord and the note A-flat from the Dbmaj7 chord are the same pitch but spelled differently based on their harmonic function. This is an enharmonic respelling.
    7.  Therefore, the melodic note that undergoes this respelling is G-sharp.
