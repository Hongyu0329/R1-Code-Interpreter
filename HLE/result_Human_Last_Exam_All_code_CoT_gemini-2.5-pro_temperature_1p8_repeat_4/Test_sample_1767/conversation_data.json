    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive. When two topological systems are joined together with a negligible barrier, the Chern number of the resulting combined system is simply the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual components.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the Chern number for the first insulator, `C1`.\n2.  Define the Chern number for the second insulator, `C2`.\n3.  Calculate the total Chern number, `C_total`, by summing `C1` and `C2`.\n4.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number is an additive topological quantum number.\n# For a junction of two systems, the total Chern number is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n# Chern number of the first insulator\nC1 = 1\n\n# Chern number of the second insulator\nC2 = 1\n\n# Calculate the total Chern number of the junction\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\n# Display the calculation\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {C1} + {C2}\")\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is: {C_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
