# The Chern number is an additive topological quantum number.
# For a junction of two systems, the total Chern number is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.

# Chern number of the first insulator
C1 = 1

# Chern number of the second insulator
C2 = 1

# Calculate the total Chern number of the junction
C_total = C1 + C2

# Display the calculation
