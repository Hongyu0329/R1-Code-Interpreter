    }

    # Step 2: Apply biological reasoning
    # High temperature is an abiotic stressor that leads to an overproduction of
    # Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), such as superoxide radicals (O2•−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
    # To prevent cellular damage, organisms have an antioxidant defense system.
    # The first line of defense, and the most rapidly activated response, involves enzymes
    # specifically designed to neutralize these ROS.
    # Key enzymes include:
    # - Superoxide dismutase (SOD), which converts superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide.
    # - Catalase (CAT) and Peroxidases (POD), which break down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.
    # These are all categorized as enzymatic antioxidants. While other antioxidants (liposoluble, hydrosoluble)
    # also play a role, the initial and primary activation involves this enzymatic system.
