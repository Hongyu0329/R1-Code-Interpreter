def print_optimal_neuromorphic_model():
    """
    This function identifies the optimal neuromorphic model from the given choices
    and prints its components.

    The optimal choice is Model A because it best represents the key principles
    of biological computation:
    1.  Continuous-Time Dynamics (∂w/∂t): Models processes that evolve continuously, like in the brain.
    2.  Adaptive Thresholds: Incorporates fatigue and cumulative activity for homeostatic plasticity.
    3.  Memory Integration: Includes a term for historical influence with decay.
    4.  Rich Plasticity: Features multiple forms of learning, regularization, and pruning.
    5.  Modulation: Accounts for input relevance and spatial factors.
