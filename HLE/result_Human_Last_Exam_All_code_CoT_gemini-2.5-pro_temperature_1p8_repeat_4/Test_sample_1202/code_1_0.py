    The user's question asks for the mechanism most likely responsible for both the retention (keeping both copies) and divergence (the copies becoming different) of duplicate genes.

    Let's analyze the options:

    A. Gene Conversion: This is a process where one gene copy is "corrected" using the other as a template. This action homogenizes the sequences, working *against* divergence. So, it is incorrect.

    B. Pseudogenization: This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene, where it accumulates mutations that disable it, turning it into a non-functional pseudogene. This is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not *retention* of function. So, it is incorrect.

    E. Adaptive Radiation: This is a macro-evolutionary pattern describing the rapid diversification of a lineage into new ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw material for this process, adaptive radiation itself is not a *molecular mechanism* for gene retention. So, it is at the wrong level of explanation.

    This leaves C (Neofunctionalization) and D (Subfunctionalization) as the two primary models that explain both retention and divergence.

    C. Neofunctionalization: In this model, one gene copy retains the original function, while the other copy is free from selective pressure and accumulates mutations. Occasionally, these mutations lead to a completely new, beneficial function. This new function leads to the *retention* and *divergence* of the duplicate.

    D. Subfunctionalization: This model posits that the ancestral gene had multiple functions (e.g., expressed in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that knock out different sub-functions. As a result, both copies are now required to carry out the original set of functions. This "division of labor" ensures both copies are *retained* and allowed to *diverge*.

    Comparing C and D for "most likely":
    Neofunctionalization requires the evolution of a novel, beneficial functionâ€”a relatively rare event. Subfunctionalization, on the other hand, can occur through the accumulation of common, disabling mutations in different parts of the two gene copies. Because the path to preservation via subfunctionalization relies on more common mutational events, many scientists believe it is a more frequent and therefore "more likely" mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes.
