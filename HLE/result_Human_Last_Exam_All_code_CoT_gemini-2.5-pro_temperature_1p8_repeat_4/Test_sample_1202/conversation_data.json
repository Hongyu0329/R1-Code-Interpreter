    "To solve this, I will analyze the provided multiple-choice question on evolutionary genetics. My goal is to determine the most likely mechanism responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the core concepts:** I will break down the meaning of \"gene duplication,\" \"retention\" (keeping the duplicate), and \"divergence\" (the two copies becoming different).\n2.  **Evaluate each answer choice** against these concepts to determine its validity.\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** I'll check if this process promotes or prevents divergence.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** I'll determine if this represents retention or loss of a functional gene.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** I'll analyze this model where one copy evolves a new function.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** I'll analyze this model where the original functions are partitioned between the two copies.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** I'll assess if this is a molecular mechanism or a broader evolutionary pattern.\n3.  **Compare the viable options:** The primary mechanisms for retention are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization. I will compare them to decide which is considered \"most likely.\" The subfunctionalization model is often argued to be a more common route for initial gene preservation because it relies on more frequent degenerative mutations rather than rarer gain-of-function mutations.\n4.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script that prints this logical explanation and concludes with the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the mechanisms of duplicate gene evolution and selects the most likely answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    The user's question asks for the mechanism most likely responsible for both the retention (keeping both copies) and divergence (the copies becoming different) of duplicate genes.\n\n    Let's analyze the options:\n\n    A. Gene Conversion: This is a process where one gene copy is \"corrected\" using the other as a template. This action homogenizes the sequences, working *against* divergence. So, it is incorrect.\n\n    B. Pseudogenization: This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene, where it accumulates mutations that disable it, turning it into a non-functional pseudogene. This is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not *retention* of function. So, it is incorrect.\n\n    E. Adaptive Radiation: This is a macro-evolutionary pattern describing the rapid diversification of a lineage into new ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw material for this process, adaptive radiation itself is not a *molecular mechanism* for gene retention. So, it is at the wrong level of explanation.\n\n    This leaves C (Neofunctionalization) and D (Subfunctionalization) as the two primary models that explain both retention and divergence.\n\n    C. Neofunctionalization: In this model, one gene copy retains the original function, while the other copy is free from selective pressure and accumulates mutations. Occasionally, these mutations lead to a completely new, beneficial function. This new function leads to the *retention* and *divergence* of the duplicate.\n\n    D. Subfunctionalization: This model posits that the ancestral gene had multiple functions (e.g., expressed in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that knock out different sub-functions. As a result, both copies are now required to carry out the original set of functions. This \"division of labor\" ensures both copies are *retained* and allowed to *diverge*.\n\n    Comparing C and D for \"most likely\":\n    Neofunctionalization requires the evolution of a novel, beneficial functionâ€”a relatively rare event. Subfunctionalization, on the other hand, can occur through the accumulation of common, disabling mutations in different parts of the two gene copies. Because the path to preservation via subfunctionalization relies on more common mutational events, many scientists believe it is a more frequent and therefore \"more likely\" mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip())\n    print(\"\\nBased on this analysis, subfunctionalization is considered the most likely mechanism.\")\n    print(\"Final Answer Choice: D\")\n\nsolve_biology_question()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
