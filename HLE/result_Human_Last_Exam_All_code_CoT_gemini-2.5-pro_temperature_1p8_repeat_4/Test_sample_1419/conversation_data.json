    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the corresponding Python code to find the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in `ϕ^4` theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce the Physical Context**: We are studying the `ϕ^4` quantum field theory near four spacetime dimensions. We use dimensional regularization, setting the dimension `d = 4 - ϵ`, where `ϵ` is a small parameter.\n2.  **The Beta Function**: The scaling behavior of the theory is described by the Renormalization Group (RG), and specifically by the beta function, `β(u)`, which dictates how the coupling constant `u` changes with energy scale. For `ϕ^4` theory, the one-loop beta function is:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + (3u²)/(16π²)`\n3.  **Find the Fixed Point**: A fixed point, `u*`, represents a scale-invariant version of the theory. This occurs when the coupling constant stops changing with the energy scale, i.e., when `β(u*) = 0`.\n4.  **Solve the Equation**: We will set up the equation `β(u*) = 0` and solve for the non-trivial fixed point `u*` (where `u* ≠ 0`). This gives the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: The Python code below will use the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic algebra needed to solve for `u*` and then print the resulting expression.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher\n    fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
