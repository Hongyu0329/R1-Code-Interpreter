    "To find the radical for the character 謄, I will follow these steps:\n1.  **Deconstruct the character**: I'll break down the kanji 謄 into its components. The character is composed of 言 and 朕.\n2.  **Identify the radical**: The radical is the component used to classify the kanji in dictionaries. For 謄, the radical is 言, which relates to \"speech\" or \"words\", fitting the character's meaning of \"to copy\" or \"transcribe\". When this radical appears on the left side of a character, it's known as a 'hen' (偏).\n3.  **Find the radical's name**: The name for the 言 radical is ごん (gon). Since it's on the left side, it is called ごんべん (gonben).\n4.  **Transcribe to Hepburn**: I will convert ごんべん into Hepburn romanization, which is \"Gonben\".\n5.  **Generate Python code**: I will create a simple Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the Hepburn transcription for the radical of the character 謄.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character is 謄.\n    # The radical is 言, which is located on the left side (a 'hen' or 偏).\n    # The name of this radical is ごんべん (gonben).\n    # The Hepburn romanization is \"Gonben\".\n    radical_name = \"Gonben\"\n    print(radical_name)\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
