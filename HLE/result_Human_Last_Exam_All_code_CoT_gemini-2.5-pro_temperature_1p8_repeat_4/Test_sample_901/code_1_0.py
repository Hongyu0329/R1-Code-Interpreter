# The reaction is an E2 elimination.
# Substrate: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane.
# Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, bulky base.
# For the E2 reaction to occur on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen must be in a trans-diaxial arrangement.
# The more stable chair conformation has both Br and methyl groups in equatorial positions.
# The ring must flip to a less stable conformation where Br and methyl are axial for the reaction to proceed.
# In this reactive conformation (Br axial at C1, methyl axial at C2):
# - The hydrogen at C2 is equatorial, so elimination cannot form a double bond between C1 and C2 (1-methylcyclohexene).
# - The hydrogen at C6 has an axial position available.
# The base abstracts the axial hydrogen from C6, and the double bond forms between C1 and C6.
# The product is named 3-methylcyclohexene.
