    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify Substrate and Reagent**:\n    *   **Substrate**: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry (1S, 2R) indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring plane, making them *trans* to each other.\n    *   **Reagent**: Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) in tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH). KOtBu is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type**:\n    *   The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. The bulky base hinders any potential SN2 (substitution) reaction.\n\n3.  **Analyze Stereochemistry for E2 Reaction**:\n    *   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and a beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the beta-hydrogen must both be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (*trans-diaxial*).\n\n4.  **Examine the Chair Conformations**:\n    *   Since the bromo and methyl groups are *trans*, they can exist in two chair conformations: one where both groups are equatorial (e,e) and another, after a ring-flip, where both are axial (a,a).\n    *   **Conformation A (more stable)**: The bulky bromo and methyl groups occupy the more stable equatorial positions to minimize steric strain. In this conformation, the Br is equatorial and cannot undergo an E2 reaction.\n    *   **Conformation B (less stable, but reactive)**: For the E2 reaction to occur, the ring must flip to the less stable conformation where the leaving group, Bromine, is **axial**. This forces the *trans* methyl group at C2 to also become **axial**.\n\n5.  **Identify Available Beta-Hydrogens for Elimination**:\n    *   In the reactive conformation (Conformation B), the Bromine is axial at C1. We now look for axial hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2**: The methyl group is in the axial position. This means the hydrogen on C2 is in the **equatorial** position. It is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, so **elimination towards C2 cannot occur**.\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial and one is equatorial. The **axial hydrogen on C6 is anti-periplanar** to the axial bromine on C1.\n\n6.  **Predict the Product**:\n    *   Because elimination is only possible via the abstraction of the axial hydrogen on C6, the double bond will form between C1 and C6.\n    *   The resulting product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the anti-Zaitsev product (the less substituted alkene), formed because the stereochemical requirement of the E2 reaction overrides the usual regioselectivity rules (Zaitsev's rule).\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the product.\n\n```python\n# The reaction is an E2 elimination.\n# Substrate: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane.\n# Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, bulky base.\n# For the E2 reaction to occur on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen must be in a trans-diaxial arrangement.\n# The more stable chair conformation has both Br and methyl groups in equatorial positions.\n# The ring must flip to a less stable conformation where Br and methyl are axial for the reaction to proceed.\n# In this reactive conformation (Br axial at C1, methyl axial at C2):\n# - The hydrogen at C2 is equatorial, so elimination cannot form a double bond between C1 and C2 (1-methylcyclohexene).\n# - The hydrogen at C6 has an axial position available.\n# The base abstracts the axial hydrogen from C6, and the double bond forms between C1 and C6.\n# The product is named 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nproduct_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\nprint(product_name)\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
