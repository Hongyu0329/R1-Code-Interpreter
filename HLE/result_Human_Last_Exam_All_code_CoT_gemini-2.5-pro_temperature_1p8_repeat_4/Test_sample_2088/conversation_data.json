    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will represent the original expression with variables. Let the expression be $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_{total})^4$, where $I_{total}$ is the result of subtracting the two integrals.\n2.  I will combine the two integrals into one, as they share the same denominator. This will simplify the expression inside the parentheses.\n3.  Next, I'll apply the substitution $u = 1-x$ to the combined integral. This substitution will make the structure of the integrand more apparent.\n4.  The crucial step is to recognize that the new integrand is the exact derivative of a simpler function. I will identify this function, which I'll call $F(u)$, by assuming its form and solving for its coefficients. The integrand can be written as $F'(u)$.\n5.  With the antiderivative known, I will use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the definite integral: $I_{total} = \\int_0^1 F'(u)du = F(1) - F(0)$.\n6.  Finally, I'll substitute the calculated value of the integral back into the main expression $E$ and compute the final numerical answer. The python script below will print out these steps along with the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the mathematical expression by printing the step-by-step derivation.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The expression to compute is:\")\n    print(\"(12)^4 * (Integral_1 - Integral_2)^4\")\n    print(\"where:\")\n    print(\"Integral_1 = integral from 0 to 1 of [(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1] / [3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6]^(3/4) dx\")\n    print(\"Integral_2 = integral from 0 to 1 of [x] / [3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6]^(3/4) dx\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Combine the two integrals.\")\n    print(\"Since the denominators are identical, we can combine the numerators under a single integral:\")\n    print(\"Let I = Integral_1 - Integral_2\")\n    print(\"I = integral from 0 to 1 of [(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x] / [3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6]^(3/4) dx\")\n    print(\"The numerator can be simplified to (1-x) * ((1-x)^8 - (1-x)^4 + 1).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Apply the substitution u = 1-x.\")\n    print(\"With u = 1-x, we have du = -dx.
