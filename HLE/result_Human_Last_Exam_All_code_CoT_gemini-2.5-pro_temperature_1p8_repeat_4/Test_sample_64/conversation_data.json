    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto), I will use a Python script. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  Create a small, simulated database using a Python dictionary. This database will store pitch accent information for a few Japanese words, including the target word 「弟」.\n2.  The script will look up 「弟」 in this database.\n3.  It will retrieve the standard accent pattern type, which is represented by a number (0 for Heiban, 1 for Atamadaka, etc.), and the corresponding name of the pattern.\n4.  Finally, the script will print out the word, its pronunciation, and its identified pitch accent pattern in a clear and readable format.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_pitch_accent(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates looking up a word's pitch accent in a dictionary.\n    Pitch accent patterns are denoted by a number:\n    [0]: Heiban (平板) - Low-High-High...\n    [1]: Atamadaka (頭高) - High-Low-Low...\n    [2], [3], etc.: Nakadaka (中高) - Low-High...Low...\n    [n] where n is number of mora: Odaka (尾高) - Low-High...High-Low(on particle)\n    \"\"\"\n    pitch_accent_db = {\n        '弟': {'kana': 'おとうと', 'pattern_num': 0, 'pattern_name': 'Heiban'},\n        '頭': {'kana': 'あたま', 'pattern_num': 2, 'pattern_name': 'Nakadaka'},\n        '猫': {'kana': 'ねこ', 'pattern_num': 1, 'pattern_name': 'Atamadaka'},\n        '犬': {'kana': 'いぬ', 'pattern_num': 2, 'pattern_name': 'Nakadaka'},\n        '花': {'kana': 'はな', 'pattern_num': 2, 'pattern_name': 'Odaka'},\n    }\n\n    if word in pitch_accent_db:\n        info = pitch_accent_db[word]\n        print(f\"Word: 「{word}」\")\n        print(f\"Kana: {info['kana']}\")\n        # We explicitly show the pattern number as part of the \"equation\" or result.\n        print(f\"The pitch accent pattern number is: {info['pattern_num']}\")\n        print(f\"This corresponds to the pattern: {info['pattern_name']}\")\n        print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n        if info['pattern_name'] == 'Heiban':\n            print(\"The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and then stays high through the rest of the word and onto any following particle (e.g., おとうとが -> L-H-H-H-H).\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Pitch accent information for 「{word}」 not found in the database.\")\n\n# Look for the pitch accent of 「弟」\ntarget_word = '弟'\nget_pitch_accent(target_word)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
