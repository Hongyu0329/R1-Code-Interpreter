    "Of course. Here is my plan to address your request.\n\nDetermining the single \"ideal\" Ni/Ce ratio is complex, as it depends on the specific synthesis method, reaction conditions (like temperature and pressure), and the desired catalytic outcome (e.g., maximizing hydrogen production vs. catalyst stability). However, scientific literature provides a well-established range and a commonly cited optimal ratio for maximizing the dispersion of Ni particles on the Ceria support, which is crucial for high catalytic activity in both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting (WS) reactions.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the molar ratio often cited as optimal in research literature. This ratio balances having enough active Ni sites without causing particle agglomeration, which reduces catalytic efficiency. A common finding is that a molar ratio where Ce is significantly in excess of Ni is ideal for creating highly dispersed Ni-O-Ce interfaces. A Ni:Ce molar ratio of approximately 1:9 is frequently reported to be highly effective.\n2.  Create a Python script that defines the number of atoms for Nickel (Ni) and Cerium (Ce) based on this 1:9 ratio.\n3.  The script will then calculate the ratio and print a clear statement that includes each number used in the calculation, as you requested.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_ideal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio for catalytic applications.\n    \n    The ideal ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles in Water Gas Shift and Water Splitting\n    is often found where Ni is highly dispersed on the Ceria support. A molar ratio\n    of approximately 1:9 (Ni:Ce) is frequently cited as optimal for maximizing\n    the active catalytic sites.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the number of atoms based on the commonly cited optimal molar ratio\n    ni_atoms = 1\n    ce_atoms = 9\n    \n    # Calculate the decimal ratio\n    ratio = ni_atoms / ce_atoms\n    \n    # Output the explanation and the final equation with each number\n    print(\"The ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio is often found to be approximately 1:9.\")\n    print(f\"This is based on having {ni_atoms} part(s) of Nickel for every {ce_atoms} parts of Cerium.\")\n    print(f\"The calculated decimal ratio is: {ni_atoms} / {ce_atoms} = {ratio:.4f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_ideal_ratio()\n\n```\n<<<A molar ratio of approximately 1:9 (Ni:Ce)>>>"
