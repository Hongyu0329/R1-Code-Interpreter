    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Symmetries:** The first step is to identify the fundamental continuous symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. A symmetry is a transformation of the independent variables (time, space) and dependent variables (velocity, pressure) that leaves the form of the equations invariant.\n2.  **Count the Dimensions of Each Symmetry Subgroup:** Each type of symmetry (e.g., translation, rotation) forms a subgroup. The dimension of each subgroup corresponds to the number of independent parameters needed to describe that transformation.\n    *   **Time Translation:** The system's behavior is independent of the starting time. This transformation has one parameter.\n    *   **Spatial Translations:** The system is independent of its location in space. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this can be done along three independent axes (x, y, z).\n    *   **Spatial Rotations:** The system's behavior is the same regardless of its orientation. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, rotations can be described around three independent axes.\n    *   **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a uniformly moving reference frame. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this boost can be in any of the three spatial directions.\n    *   **Scaling:** The equations possess a specific scaling symmetry that relates changes in length, time, velocity, and pressure scales. This transformation is controlled by a single parameter.\n3.  **Sum the Dimensions:** The total dimension of the full Lie group of symmetries is the sum of the dimensions of these independent subgroups. I will write a Python script to perform this sum and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_lie_group_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the\n    3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dimension for time translation (t -> t + a)\n    time_translation_dim = 1\n    \n    # Dimension for spatial translations in R^3 (x -> x + b)\n    space_translations_dim = 3\n    \n    # Dimension for spatial rotations in R^3 (rotations around x, y, z axes)\n    space_rotations_dim = 3\n    \n    # Dimension for Galilean boosts (change to a moving reference frame)\n    galilean_boosts_dim = 3\n    \n    # Dimension for the scaling transformation\n    scaling_dim = 1\n\n    # The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of the independent subgroups\n    total_dimension = (\n        time_translation_dim +\n        space_translations_dim +\n        space_rotations_dim +\n        galilean_boosts_dim +\n        scaling_dim\n    )\n\n    print(\"The dimension is the sum of the dimensions from each symmetry subgroup:\")\n    print(f\"Time Translation: {time_translation_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Spatial Translations: {space_translations_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Spatial Rotations: {space_rotations_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Galilean Boosts: {galilean_boosts_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Scaling Transformation: {scaling_dim}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(\n        f\"{time_translation_dim} + {space_translations_dim} + {space_rotations_dim} + \"\n        f\"{galilean_boosts_dim} + {scaling_dim} = {total_dimension}\"\n    )\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_lie_group_dimension()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
