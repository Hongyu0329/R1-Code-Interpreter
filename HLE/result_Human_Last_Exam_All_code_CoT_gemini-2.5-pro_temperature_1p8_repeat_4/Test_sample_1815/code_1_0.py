The dual group of Z (with the discrete topology) is the circle group T = R/Z. The torsion subgroup of T is Q/Z.\n"

In a discrete topology, a sequence converges if and only if it is eventually constant, so there are no nontrivial convergent sequences in the quotient Z/nZ.\n"
        "However, the condition is on the topology on Z itself. In the topology on Z whose open sets are unions of cosets of nZ, a sequence (x_k) converges to 0 if x_k is eventually a multiple of n. The sequence x_k = k*n for k >= 1 converges to 0 but is not eventually zero. Thus, it is a nontrivial convergent sequence. So, non-Hausdorff topologies also fail the condition."
