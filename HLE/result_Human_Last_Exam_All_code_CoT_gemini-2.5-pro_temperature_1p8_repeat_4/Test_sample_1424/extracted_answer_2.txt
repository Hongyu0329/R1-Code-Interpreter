In the frequency/energy domain, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable $\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The specific relationship for the retarded Green's function is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta}$, where $\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal.
