    This script calculates the critical amount of correlation required to balance
    potentiation and depression in the described neural network model.

    The formula is derived from the stability analysis of the weight dynamics:
    C_crit = (N_v + N_s) / 2 * mu * (theta - mu)

    Where:
    - C_crit: The critical covariance between input populations v and s.
    - N_v, N_s: The number of neurons in input layers v and s, respectively.
    - mu: The average rate of activation for the input neurons.
    - theta: The heterosynaptic offset constant in the learning rule.
