# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings
# of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.

# Let N be the number of such embeddings. An isometric embedding is a function
# f: X -> B such that for all x, y in X, the norm of the difference ||f(x) - f(y)||_B
# equals the distance d(x, y).

# We want to find the minimum value of N by choosing appropriate X and B.

print("Step 1: Analyzing the trivial case where X has only one point.")
# Let X = {p}. The only distance in this space is d(p, p) = 0.
# We can choose the Banach space B to be the zero vector space, B = {0}.
# A vector space containing only the zero vector is a valid Banach space.
# The cardinality of this space is K = 1.

# An embedding must satisfy ||f(p) - f(p)||_B = d(p, p).
# The only possible function is f(p) = 0.
# For this function, the condition is ||0 - 0||_B = 0, which is true.
# Thus, there is exactly one isometric embedding in this case.

print(f"For X = {{p}} and B = {{0}}, the number of embeddings is {N_case1}.")

print("Step 2: Analyzing the non-trivial case where X has at least two points.")
# Let X have at least two points, a and b, with distance d(a, b) = c > 0.
# This requires the Banach space B to have at least two points, so its cardinality K >= 2.

# If f is an isometric embedding, then for any vector v in B, the function g(x) = f(x) + v
# is also an isometric embedding, since ||(f(a)+v) - (f(b)+v)|| = ||f(a)-f(b)|| = c.
# This generates K distinct embeddings, so N >= K.

# The total number of embeddings N is the number of pairs (v_a, v_b) in B x B
# such that ||v_a - v_b||_B = c.
# Let w = v_a - v_b. Then N = K * |{w in B | ||w||_B = c}|.
# Let S_c be the sphere of radius c in B. N = K * |S_c|.

print("To minimize N, we must choose a Banach space B to minimize K and |S_c|.")
# To make the sphere size |S_c| minimal, we look for |S_c|=1.
# If a vector w is in S_c, so is -w (since ||-w||=||w||=c).
# For |S_c| = 1, we need w = -w, which means 2w = 0. For w!=0, the base field
# of the Banach space must have characteristic 2.
# The simplest such field is F_2 = {0, 1}.

# Let's define B over F_2 using the trivial norm (||v||=1 for v!=0, ||v||=0 for v=0).
# To make |S_c| = 1, we need the sphere to have one element. The only non-zero norm is 1, so c=1.
# S_1 = {v in B | ||v||=1} is the set of all non-zero vectors.
# For |S_1| = 1, B must have exactly one non-zero vector. So B = {0, e}.
# This space is isomorphic to F_2 as a vector space over itself.
# Here, K = |B| = 2 and |S_1| = 1.

# We choose an ultrametric space X compatible with this B.
# For instance, X = {a, b} with d(a, b) = 1.
# For these choices, we can calculate the number of embeddings.
