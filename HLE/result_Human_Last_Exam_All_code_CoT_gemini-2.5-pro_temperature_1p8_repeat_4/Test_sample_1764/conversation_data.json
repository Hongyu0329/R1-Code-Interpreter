    "This problem asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$. To find the \"smallest possible number,\" we can choose both the space $X$ and the Banach space $B$ to minimize this value.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first analyze the definition of an isometric embedding and its basic properties. In particular, I will show how new embeddings can be generated from an existing one through translation.\n2.  I will consider the trivial case where the ultrametric space $X$ consists of a single point. I'll show that for a specific choice of the Banach space $B$, the number of embeddings can be 1.\n3.  Next, I'll analyze the non-trivial case where $X$ has at least two points. I'll derive an equation for the number of embeddings, $N$, which depends on the cardinality of the Banach space, $K$, and the size of spheres within it.\n4.  I will then find the minimal possible value of $N$ for this non-trivial case by carefully selecting a specific Banach space over a finite field.\n5.  Finally, by comparing the results from the trivial and non-trivial cases, I will determine the overall smallest possible number of embeddings. The entire reasoning will be presented in a Python script that prints the logical steps and the results of the calculations.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings\n# of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.\n\n# Let N be the number of such embeddings. An isometric embedding is a function\n# f: X -> B such that for all x, y in X, the norm of the difference ||f(x) - f(y)||_B\n# equals the distance d(x, y).\n\n# We want to find the minimum value of N by choosing appropriate X and B.\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Analyzing the trivial case where X has only one point.\")\n# Let X = {p}.

For w!=0, the base field\n# of the Banach space must have characteristic 2.\n# The simplest such field is F_2 = {0, 1}.\n\n# Let's define B over F_2 using the trivial norm (||v||=1 for v!=0, ||v||=0 for v=0).\n# To make |S_c| = 1, we need the sphere to have one element.
