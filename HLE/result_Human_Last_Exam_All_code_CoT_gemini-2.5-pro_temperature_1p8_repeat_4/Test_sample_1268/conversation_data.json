    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan for solving the task, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Question:** The question asks for the relationship between the \"maximum norm\" $(k_{k,\\infty})$ and the \"covolume\" $(V)$ for squarefree natural numbers $(N)$. This question lies in the field of algebraic number theory, specifically the geometry of numbers applied to real quadratic fields $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$.\n\n2.  **Define the Terms:**\n    *   **Squarefree Natural Number N:** A positive integer not divisible by any perfect square other than 1. This $N$ defines the real quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$.\n    *   **Covolume V:** The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of the field $K$ can be viewed as a 2-dimensional lattice in the real plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The covolume $V$ is the volume of the fundamental parallelotope of this lattice. It is calculated as $V = \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$, where $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the field.\n        *   If $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, then $\\Delta_K = N$.\n        *   If $N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod 4$, then $\\Delta_K = 4N$.\n    *   **Maximum Norm $k_{k,\\infty}$:** This notation is best interpreted as the first successive minimum of the lattice $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with respect to the maximum norm (or $L_\\infty$ norm). In simpler terms, for any algebraic integer $\\alpha$ in the field, we can look at its two real embeddings (conjugates), $\\sigma_1(\\alpha)$ and $\\sigma_2(\\alpha)$. The maximum norm of $\\alpha$ is $\\max(|\\sigma_1(\\alpha)|, |\\sigma_2(\\alpha)|)$. Then, $k_{k,\\infty}$ is the smallest possible non-zero value of this maximum norm. It can be shown that this value is always 1 for any real quadratic field because the rational integer $1$ is always in $\\mathcal{O}_K$, and its maximum norm is $\\max(|1|,|1|) = 1$, and no non-zero integer can have a maximum norm less than 1.\n\n3.  **Find the Relationship (The Upper Bound):** The relationship comes from Minkowski's theorem on successive minima. For a 2D lattice with covolume $V$, the theorem implies that the first successive minimum $\\lambda_1$ (our $k_{k,\\infty}$) is bounded by the covolume. The precise inequality is:\n    $k_{k,\\infty}^2 \\le V$\n    This is equivalent to:\n    $k_{k,\\infty} \\le \\sqrt{V}$\n    This provides the requested upper bound for $k_{k,\\infty}$ in relation to $V$.\n\n4.  **Implement the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that:\n    a. Prompts the user to enter a squarefree natural number $N$.\n    b. Calculates the discriminant $\\Delta_K$ and the covolume $V$.\n    c. Calculates the upper bound $\\sqrt{V}$.\n    d. States the value of $k_{k,\\infty}$ (which is 1).\n    e. Prints out the derived inequality with the specific numbers calculated for the user's input $N$, clearly showing each number in the final equation.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_squarefree(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a number n is squarefree.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n    i = 2\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % (i * i) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 1\n    return True\n\ndef calculate_bound_for_squarefree(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the relationship between the maximum norm (k_k,inf)\n    and the covolume (V) for the quadratic field Q(sqrt(N)).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Calculations for N = {n} ---\")\n    \n    # The field is K = Q(sqrt(n))\n    # Calculate the field discriminant Delta_K\n    if n % 4 == 1:\n        discriminant = n\n    else:  # n % 4 == 2 or 3\n        discriminant = 4 * n\n        \n    print(f\"The discriminant of the field Q(sqrt({n})) is Δ_K = {discriminant}.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the covolume V = sqrt(|Delta_K|)\n    covolume = math.sqrt(discriminant)\n    print(f\"The covolume of the lattice of integers is V = sqrt({discriminant}) ≈ {covolume:.4f}.\")\n    \n    # k_k,inf is the first successive minimum of the lattice of integers w.r.t. the\n    # L_infinity norm.

Please try again.\")\n                continue\n            \n            calculate_bound_for_squarefree(N)\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Error: Invalid input.
