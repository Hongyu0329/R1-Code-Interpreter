# Step 1: Define the number of equivalence classes for each component space.
# A space is homogeneous if its auto-homeomorphism group acts transitively on its points.
# If a space is homogeneous, all its points belong to a single equivalence class.

# The torus is a homogeneous space.
torus_classes = 1

# The sphere is a homogeneous space.
sphere_classes = 1

# The real line is a homogeneous space.
real_line_classes = 1

# A discrete space with n points has the symmetric group S_n as its auto-homeomorphism group,
# which acts transitively. So, it is homogeneous.
three_point_discrete_classes = 1
five_point_discrete_classes = 1

# Step 2: Calculate the total number of equivalence classes.
# Since the components are not homeomorphic to each other, an auto-homeomorphism
# of the total space must map each component to itself.
# Therefore, the total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the number of
# classes in each component.
total_classes = (torus_classes +
                 sphere_classes +
                 real_line_classes +
                 three_point_discrete_classes +
                 five_point_discrete_classes)

# Step 3: Print the result as a detailed equation.
print(f"The total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the classes from each component:")
