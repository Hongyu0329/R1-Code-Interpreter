    "To identify the achiral, non-polar crystal classes that exhibit optical activity, we need to apply a series of filters based on the symmetry properties that define these characteristics.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Optical Activity:** First, we must identify the crystal classes that can be optically active. A crystal class is optically active if its symmetry allows for a non-zero gyration tensor (`g_ij`). This tensor is non-zero for 15 of the 32 crystal classes. These are the 11 chiral classes plus four additional achiral classes. We will start with this set of 15 classes.\n2.  **Achiral:** Next, we will filter this list to keep only the achiral classes. A class is achiral if it possesses an improper rotation axis (like a mirror plane 'm' or a rotoinversion axis '-n'). We will do this by removing the 11 chiral classes from our set.\n3.  **Non-polar:** Finally, from the remaining set of achiral, optically active classes, we will remove any that are polar. A crystal class is polar if it has a unique direction that is not symmetrically equivalent to its opposite.\n\nThis step-by-step filtering will leave us with the final set of crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n    This is based on filtering the 32 crystal point groups according to their\n    symmetry properties.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the set of crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity.\n    # These are the 15 classes with a non-zero gyration tensor.\n    # We use the Hermann-Mauguin (International) short notation.\n    optically_active_classes = {'1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432',\n                                'm', 'mm2', '-4', '-42m'}\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Starting with the 15 crystal classes that can be optically active:\")\n    print(f\"   {sorted(list(optically_active_classes))}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Filter for achiral classes.\n    # A class is achiral if it is not chiral.
