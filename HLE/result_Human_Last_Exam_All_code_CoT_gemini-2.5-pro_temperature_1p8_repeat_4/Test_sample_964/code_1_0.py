# This script simulates the chemical process to determine the final barium salt.

# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the reaction between barium chloride and silver nitrate.
# 2. Determine the products and identify the new barium salt.
# 3. Analyze the effect of adding and subsequently removing ammonia.
# 4. Conclude what the final barium salt is.

# Step 1: Mixing aqueous solutions of barium chloride (BaCl2) and silver nitrate (AgNO3).
# This is a double displacement precipitation reaction.
print("\nStep 1: Reaction between Barium Chloride and Silver Nitrate")
print("The balanced chemical equation is:")
# The equation shows the stoichiometric coefficients (numbers) for each compound.
print("1 BaCl2 + 2 AgNO3 -> 2 AgCl + 1 Ba(NO3)2")
print("\nThis reaction produces solid Silver Chloride (AgCl) and aqueous Barium Nitrate (Ba(NO3)2).")
print("At this point, the barium salt in the flask is Barium Nitrate.")

# Step 2: The mixture is dried, removing the water. The barium salt is unchanged.
print("\nStep 2: Freeze drying the mixture")
print("Water is removed. The flask now contains a solid mixture of Silver Chloride and Barium Nitrate.")
print("The barium salt is still Barium Nitrate.")

# Step 3: Ammonia is added. It reacts with AgCl but not Ba(NO3)2.
print("\nStep 3: Addition of Ammonia")
print("Ammonia is added, which reacts with Silver Chloride to form a soluble complex, dissolving the precipitate.")
print("Barium Nitrate does not react with ammonia.")
print("The barium salt is still Barium Nitrate.")

# Step 4: The ammonia is removed by drying. This reverses the previous step.
print("\nStep 4: Evaporating the Ammonia")
print("The removal of ammonia causes the Silver Chloride to precipitate out of the solution again.")
print("The barium salt is unaffected by this process.")

# Final Conclusion: The barium salt is unchanged after the initial reaction.
