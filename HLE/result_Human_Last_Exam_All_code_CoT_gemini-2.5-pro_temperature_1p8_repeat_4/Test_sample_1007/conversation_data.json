    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ballet step has the same ending leg position as its starting position.\n\n**1. Analyze each option:**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs beat three times, changing their relative position a total of six times. Starting from fifth position with the right foot in front, the dancer will land in fifth position with the left foot in front. Therefore, the feet have changed.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The word \"changé\" in French literally means \"changed.\" This step involves jumping from fifth position to an open position and then returning to fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the feet have changed.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** The name means \"to assemble\" or \"to join.\" In its most basic form, performed \"en place\" (on the spot), a dancer starts in fifth position, brushes one foot out, jumps off the supporting leg, and lands in the same fifth position with the same foot in front. While there are traveling versions of assemblé (like *dessus* and *dessous*) that do change the feet, the fundamental step does not require a change.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** This is a gliding, traveling step. \"Derrière\" means \"behind.\" If starting with the right foot in front, the left (back) foot will glide out, and the right foot will close behind it, making the left foot the new front foot. Therefore, the feet have changed.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative step that is an embellished version of a *pas de chat*. A standard *pas de chat* (step of the cat) involves changing feet. While a non-changing version of *gargouillade* can be performed, its common execution, based on its root step, involves landing with the feet switched.\n\n**2. Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, `Entrechat six`, `Échappé battu changé`, and `Glissade derrière` all fundamentally involve changing which foot is in front. While `Gargouillade` can be performed without changing, it's often taught as a changing step. `Assemblé`, in its basic form, starts and ends in the exact same position. Therefore, it is the best answer.\n\nThe following Python code systematically analyzes these options to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_step_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one typically ends\n    in the same position it started, without changing the feet.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary representing the properties of each ballet step.\n    # 'changes_feet' is True if the standard execution involves swapping\n    # the front/back position of the feet.\n    steps = {\n        'A': {'name': 'Entrechat six', 'changes_feet': True},\n        'B': {'name': 'Échappé battu changé', 'changes_feet': True},\n        'C': {'name': 'Assemblé', 'changes_feet': False},\n        'D': {'name': 'Glissade derrière', 'changes_feet': True},\n        'E': {'name': 'Gargouillade', 'changes_feet': True}\n    }\n\n    # Detailed explanations for each step.\n    explanations = {\n        'A': \"Ends with the opposite foot in front due to an odd number of leg crossings (three).\",\n        'B': \"The term 'changé' explicitly means the feet are changed.\",\n        'C': \"The basic, non-traveling 'assemblé en place' starts and ends in the same fifth position without changing feet.
