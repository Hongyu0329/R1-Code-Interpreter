    """
    Calculates the number of iterations required for the classical Schwarz
    Relaxation Method to converge for the 1D wave equation up to a given time T.
    """

    # --- Problem Parameters ---
    # The problem is symbolic, so we use example values to demonstrate the calculation.
    # T: The final time instant up to which convergence is required.
    T = 10.0
    # c: The propagation speed of the wave.
    c = 343.0
    # M: The size of the overlap region between subdomains.
    M = 25.0

    # --- Theoretical Basis ---
    # The theory for the classical Schwarz method for the wave equation shows that
    # the solution becomes exact in a time window that grows with each iteration k.
    # After k iterations, the solution is correct for all times t < k * (M / c).
    #
    # To be converged up to the time instant T, we need:
    #   k * (M / c) >= T
    #
    # Rearranging for k gives:
    #   k >= T * c / M
    #
    # Since the number of iterations k must be an integer, we take the ceiling
    # of the right-hand side.

    # --- Calculation ---
    required_iterations_float = (T * c) / M
    num_iterations = math.ceil(required_iterations_float)

    # --- Output ---
