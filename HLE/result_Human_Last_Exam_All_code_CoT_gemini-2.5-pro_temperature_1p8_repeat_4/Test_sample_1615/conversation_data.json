    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Theory:** First, I will break down the problem using graph theory concepts. The key terms are \"properly colour the vertices\" (which refers to vertex coloring), \"maximum number of colours\" (which relates to the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$), \"complete graph\", and \"maximum degree\" ($\\Delta(G)$).\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** A graph with $n$ vertices can always be colored with $n$ colors, a value achieved only by the complete graph $K_n$. Since the problem specifies that our graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph, it must require fewer than $n$ colors. I will show that for any non-complete graph, there are at least two vertices that can share a color, which means its chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ can be at most $n-1$.\n3.  **Prove the Bound is Achievable:** To confirm that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, I need to demonstrate that there exists a non-complete graph on $n$ vertices that actually requires $n-1$ colors. A graph consisting of a complete subgraph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) plus one additional, isolated vertex is a simple example that fulfills this condition.\n4.  **Calculate and Code:** Based on the reasoning that the maximum number of colors is $n-1$, I will use the given number of vertices ($n=12345$) to find the final answer. I will then provide a simple Python script to perform this calculation and print the result, including the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of vertices in the graph G\nnum_vertices = 12345\n\n# The chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring.\n# A graph with 'n' vertices has a chromatic number of at most 'n'.\n# This maximum is only reached if the graph is a complete graph (K_n), where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n# The problem states that the graph G is NOT a complete graph.\n# If a graph is not complete, it means there exists at least one pair of vertices that are not connected by an edge.\n# Let these two non-adjacent vertices be 'u' and 'v'.\n# Because they are not connected, 'u' and 'v' can be assigned the same color in a proper coloring.\n\n# This implies that we can always color a non-complete graph with at most n-1 colors.\n# For example, by assigning one color to the non-adjacent pair {u, v} and a unique color to each of the remaining (n-2) vertices.\n# This gives a valid coloring with 1 + (n-2) = n-1 colors.\n# So, the maximum possible number of colors is at most n-1.\n\n# To show that this maximum is achievable, consider a graph constructed by taking a complete graph on (n-1) vertices\n# and adding one more vertex that is isolated (not connected to any other vertex).\n# This graph has n vertices, is not complete, and requires n-1 colors due to the complete subgraph.\n# Therefore, the maximum number of colors for a non-complete graph on n vertices is exactly n-1.\n\n# Calculate the result for n = 12345\nmax_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n# Print the final equation as requested\nprint(\"The number of vertices is n = 12345.\")\nprint(\"The graph is not a complete graph, so the maximum number of colors required is n - 1.\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
