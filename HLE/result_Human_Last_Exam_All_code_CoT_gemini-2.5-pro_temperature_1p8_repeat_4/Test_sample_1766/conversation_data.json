    "Of course. Here is a Python script to solve for the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`, and the spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, is obtained by coupling `l` and `s`. Its possible values range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:**\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n    *   For each `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in steps of 1. The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by $\\hbar m_j$.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** The script will iterate through each possible value of `j` and its corresponding `m_j` values. For each state, defined by the pair `(j, m_j)`, it will calculate and print the full eigenvalue equations for both $J^2$ and $J_z$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_J2_Jz_eigenvalues():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues for J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    The eigenvalues are presented in the format of the eigenvalue equation.\n    We are using units where hbar = 1, but will show 'hbar' symbolically in the output.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1\n    s = 0.5\n    \n    print(f\"For a p-electron (l={l}, s={s}), we find the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Iterate through all states (j, m_j) and print eigenvalues\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate the eigenvalue for J^2\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"--- States for j = {j} ---\")\n        \n        # Iterate through possible m_j values for the current j\n        m_j_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            print(f\"For the state |j={j}, m_j={m_j}>:\")\n            \n            # Eigenvalue equation for J^2\n            print(f\"  J^2 |{j}, {m_j}> = {j}*({j}+1) \\u0127\\u00b2 |{j}, {m_j}> = {j_squared_eigenvalue} \\u0127\\u00b2 |{j}, {m_j}>\")\n            \n            # Eigenvalue equation for J_z\n            print(f\"  J_z |{j}, {m_j}> = {m_j} \\u0127 |{j}, {m_j}>\\n\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the solutions\nsolve_J2_Jz_eigenvalues()\n```\n<<<The common eigenvalues have been calculated and printed by the script.
