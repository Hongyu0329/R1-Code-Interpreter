    # --- Biological Knowledge Base & Reasoning ---

    # Step 1: Determine the effect on ALDH levels.
    # (2E)-4-Hydroxy-2-nonen-8-ynal is an electrophilic stressor. Cells respond to such
    # stress by upregulating protective enzymes. ALDH (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase) is a
    # primary enzyme for detoxifying aldehydes, so its expression is expected to increase.
    aldh_change = "increase"

    # Step 2: Identify the protein involved.
    # The cellular antioxidant response to electrophiles is mediated by the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.
    # Keap1 is the sensor protein that detects these stressors. JAK1 is primarily
    # involved in cytokine signaling, which is less relevant here.
    involved_protein = "Keap1"

    # Step 3: Compare the effect of 4-OI.
    # 4-OI (4-Octyl Itaconate) is a known and highly potent activator of the Nrf2 pathway.
    # It is generally considered more effective at inducing this pathway than HNE-like compounds.
    # Therefore, 50 uM 4-OI is expected to cause a more significant change.
    comparison = "more"
