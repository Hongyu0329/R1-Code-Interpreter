Trisyllabic Laxing is a rule of sound change in the history of English. It states that
a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the third-to-last syllable
(also called the antepenultimate syllable) of a word.

Example: sane vs. sanity
- 'sane' has a long 'a' vowel sound (/eɪ/).
- When we add '-ity', we get 'sa-ni-ty'. The 'a' is now in the 3rd-to-last syllable.
- The vowel shortens to /æ/, resulting in 'sanity' (/ˈsænəti/).

        "serenity": "YES. Comes from 'serene' (long /iː/ vowel). In 'se-re-ni-ty', the vowel shortens to /ɛ/. The syllable 're' is third from the end. This is a classic example.",
        "gratitude": "YES. Related to Latin 'grātus' (long 'ā' vowel). In 'gra-ti-tude', the vowel is the short /æ/. The syllable 'gra' is third from the end. This follows the pattern.",
        "pleasant": "NO. It comes from 'please' (long /iː/ vowel) and the vowel shortens to /ɛ/. However, 'plea-sant' is only TWO syllables. The rule requires three, so this is a different type of shortening, not trisyllabic laxing.",
        "southern": "NO. It comes from 'south' (diphthong /aʊ/). The vowel shortens to /ʌ/. However, 'sou-thern' is only TWO syllables. This is not trisyllabic laxing.",
        "shadow": "NO. This is the most definitive exception. It comes from Old English 'sceadwe', where the root vowel was ALREADY SHORT. It was never long to begin with, so it could not be 'laxed' or shortened by this process. Unlike the others, there is no shortening from a long-vowel base form."
