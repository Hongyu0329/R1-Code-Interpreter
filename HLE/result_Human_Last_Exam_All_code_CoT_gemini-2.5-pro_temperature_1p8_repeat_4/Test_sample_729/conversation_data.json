    "To determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, `Q_128`, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Group**: We'll start by defining the generalized quaternion group `Q_128` using its standard presentation. This group is of order `128 = 2^7`. Its presentation is `G = <x, y | x^64 = 1, y^2 = x^32, y^-1*x*y = x^-1>`.\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups**: A power subgroup `G^n` is the subgroup generated by the n-th powers of all elements in `G`. That is, `G^n = <g^n | g in G>`. We need to find how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way for different integers `n`.\n3.  **Analyze Elements' Powers**: We will compute the `n`-th powers of the elements of `G`. Elements are either of the form `x^k` or `x^k*y`.\n4.  **Categorize by `n`**: The structure of `G^n` depends on whether `n` is even or odd.\n    *   **Case 1: `n` is odd**: We will show that for any odd `n`, `G^n` is the entire group `G`. This gives us one power subgroup.\n    *   **Case 2: `n` is even**: We will show that for any even `n`, `G^n` is a cyclic subgroup generated by an element of the form `x^d`, where `d` is an even divisor of 64.\n5.  **Count the Subgroups**: We will count the number of unique subgroups from each case and add them together. This involves finding all the even divisors of 64.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: The Python code will programmatically find the even divisors of 64, count them, and add the result to the single subgroup from the odd case to arrive at the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 (Q_128).\n    \n    The group Q_128 has the presentation: <x, y | x^64 = 1, y^2 = x^32, y^-1*x*y = x^-1>.\n    A power subgroup G^n is defined as G^n = <g^n | g in G>.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the power subgroups G^n for odd n.\")\n    print(\"For any odd integer n, the set of n-th powers {g^n | g in G} generates the entire group G.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, G^n = G for all odd n.\")\n    num_from_odd_n = 1\n    print(f\"This gives {num_from_odd_n} unique power subgroup (G itself).\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the power subgroups G^n for even n.\")\n    print(\"For any even integer n, the power subgroup G^n is a cyclic subgroup of the form <x^d>.\")\n    print(\"Here, d = gcd(n, 64).\")\n    print(\"To find the number of distinct subgroups, we need to find all possible values for d.\\n\")\n\n    order_of_x = 64\n    print(f\"Since n is even, d = gcd(n, {order_of_x}) must also be an even number that divides {order_of_x}.\")\n    print(f\"So, we need to find all the even divisors of {order_of_x}.\")\n    \n    divisors = [d for d in range(1, order_of_x + 1) if order_of_x % d == 0]\n    even_divisors = [d for d in divisors if d % 2 == 0]\n    \n    print(f\"The divisors of {order_of_x} are: {divisors}.\")\n    print(f\"The even divisors of {order_of_x} are: {even_divisors}.\")\n\n    num_from_even_n = len(even_divisors)\n    print(f\"Each of these {num_from_even_n} even divisors corresponds to a unique power subgroup: <x^2>, <x^4>, ..., <x^64>.\")\n    print(f\"This gives {num_from_even_n} unique power subgroups.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the total number of power subgroups.\")\n    total_subgroups = num_from_odd_n + num_from_even_n\n    \n    print(\"The total is the sum of the counts from the odd and even cases.\")\n    print(f\"Total = (subgroups from odd n) + (subgroups from even n)\")\n    print(f\"Total = {num_from_odd_n} + {num_from_even_n} = {total_subgroups}\")\n    \n    return total_subgroups\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```\n<<<7>>>"
