    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Problem**: The task is to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 chessboard that wraps around on its edges (a torus).\n\n2.  **Understand Toroidal Attacks**: On a toroidal board, the rules for \"non-attacking\" are expanded. In addition to standard row and column attacks, diagonals also wrap around. For any two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` on an `N x N` board, they attack each other if any of these conditions are met:\n    *   **Row Attack**: `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column Attack**: `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Diagonal Attack (Wrapped)**: The sum of the coordinates or the difference of the coordinates are the same, modulo the board size `N`. This can be expressed as:\n        *   `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N`\n        *   `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`\n\n3.  **Strategy: Backtracking**: A brute-force search is too slow. A more intelligent approach is **backtracking**. We will write a function that tries to place queens one by one.\n    *   The board's 25 cells will be numbered from 0 to 24.\n    *   The recursive function will try placing the k-th queen.\n    *   At each step, we check if placing a queen in a cell is \"safe\" (i.e., it doesn't attack any queens already on the board according to the toroidal rules).\n    *   If a placement is safe, we recursively call the function to place the next queen. If not, we backtrack and try the next cell.\n    *   To avoid counting permutations of the same set of 4 queens as different solutions, we ensure that we only place subsequent queens in cells with a higher index than the previously placed queen.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when all 4 queens have been successfully placed. We increment a counter each time this happens.\n\n4.  **Final Output**: The script will execute the backtracking search and print the total number of valid placements found in a descriptive sentence.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Suppress recursion limit errors for deep searches, though not strictly\n# necessary for this small problem size.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n# Board configuration\nN = 5  # Board size is NxN\nK = 4  # Number of queens to place\n\ndef is_safe(r_new, c_new, placed_queens):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a new queen at (r_new, c_new) can be placed without\n    being attacked by any of the queens in placed_queens.\n    This check includes toroidal (wrapped) diagonal attacks.\n    \"\"\"\n    for r_old, c_old in placed_queens:\n        # Check for same row or column (should not happen with the way\n        # we construct solutions but included for clarity).\n        if r_new == r_old or c_new == c_old:\n            return False\n            \n        # Check for toroidal main diagonals.\n        # This condition checks if the queens lie on the same \"r-c\" diagonal.\n        if (r_new - c_new + N) % N == (r_old - c_old + N) % N:\n            return False\n            \n        # Check for toroidal anti-diagonals.\n        # This condition checks if the queens lie on the same \"r+c\" diagonal.\n        if (r_new + c_new) % N == (r_old + c_old) % N:\n            return False\n            \n    return True\n\ndef count_placements(queens_to_place, start_index, placed_queens):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively finds the number of ways to place the remaining queens.\n    \n    :param queens_to_place: The number of queens we still need to place.\n    :param start_index: The linear cell index to start searching from.
