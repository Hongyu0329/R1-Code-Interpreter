    analysis = {
        'A': "Incorrect. Tandem repeats are a source of mutation and variation but are not considered a primary compensatory mechanism for protecting essential gene functions across the genome from decay.",
        'B': "Incorrect. Chromosomal inversions are a cause of suppressed recombination, not a solution to the problems it creates. They establish the very condition of limited recombination.",
        'C': "Incorrect. While transposable elements can generate variation, their activity is often mutagenic and disruptive, contributing more to genetic deterioration than preventing it.",
        'D': "Correct. Multigene families, created by gene duplication, provide genetic redundancy. If one gene copy in a family is inactivated by a deleterious mutation, other copies can preserve the original function. This directly counteracts Muller's Ratchet, the irreversible accumulation of mutations that plagues genomes with limited recombination.",
        'E': "Incorrect. While polyploidy (whole genome duplication) also provides redundancy, multigene families are a more specific and fundamental 'architectural feature' within chromosomes that serves this protective role, especially in non-recombining regions like sex chromosomes which are not themselves polyploid."
