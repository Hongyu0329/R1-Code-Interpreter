    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor and Order**: The problem asks for the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a conductor $d = 53599$ and order $k = 6$.\n2.  **Factor the Conductor**: For a character $\\chi$ to be primitive with a conductor $d$, where $d$ is a product of distinct primes ($d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$), $\\chi$ must be a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ for each prime factor $p_i$. A character $\\chi_i \\pmod{p_i}$ is primitive if its order is greater than 1. First, I will find the prime factorization of $d=53599$.\n3.  **Use Order Properties**: The order of the combined character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_i$. We require this lcm to be 6. This means the order of each component, $k_i$, must be a divisor of 6 (and greater than 1), i.e., $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n4.  **Count Component Characters**: For each prime factor $p_i$, I will count the number of available characters for each possible order $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$. The number of characters of order $m$ modulo a prime $p$ (where $m | (p-1)$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(m)$.\n5.  **Apply Inclusion-Exclusion**: With the counts for each component, I'll use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find the total number of combinations where the lcm of the orders is exactly 6.\n    *   First, calculate the total number of combinations of primitive characters whose orders divide 6.\n    *   Then, subtract the combinations where the lcm is *not* 6. This happens if the orders are all not divisible by 2, or all not divisible by 3.\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Combine the above steps to find the final numerical answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        if temp % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            while temp % d == 0:\n                temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors.append(temp)\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef solve_dirichlet_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given\n    square-free conductor and a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    order_k = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order k = {order_k}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Factor the conductor d\n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    num_prime_factors = len(prime_factors)\n    print(f\"The conductor d = {d} is square-free with {num_prime_factors} prime factors: {prime_factors}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Set up the counting problem based on character properties\n    print(\"\\nA character chi is primitive mod d if it's a product of primitive characters mod p_i.\")\n    print(\"A character mod p_i is primitive if its order > 1.\")\n    print(f\"We need lcm(order(chi_1), ..., order(chi_{num_prime_factors})) = {order_k}.\")\n    print(\"This means each component's order must be a divisor of 6, and > 1.
