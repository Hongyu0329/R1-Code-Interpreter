    print("   - Rationale: Given the patient's substance use history and request for stimulants, a urine drug test is essential to confirm his reported use and screen for other substances that could be contributing to his instability (e.g., relapse on cocaine).\n")

    print("3. The third priority is to address his severe insomnia with a low-risk intervention.")
    print(f"   - Action: {options['IV']}")
    print("   - Rationale: The patient is 'struggling mightily' with insomnia. Prescribing melatonin is a safe, non-addictive option that can provide symptomatic relief. This can build therapeutic rapport and support the patient while addressing the underlying cause (cannabis use).\n")
