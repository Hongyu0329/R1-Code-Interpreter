    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in d=3 using the epsilon expansion, we follow these steps based on renormalization group theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Parameters:** The problem is set in a spatial dimension `d=3`. The epsilon expansion is performed around the upper critical dimension, which for this class of universality (the O(n) model, which includes the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models) is `d_c = 4`.\n2.  **Calculate Epsilon (ϵ):** The expansion parameter `ϵ` is defined as the deviation from the upper critical dimension: `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **Choose the Model:** The properties of the system, including its exponents, depend on the number of spin components, `n`. The problem does not specify `n`, so we will use the most common and fundamental case, the Ising model, which corresponds to `n=1`.\n4.  **Apply the Epsilon Expansion Formula:** We will use the standard first-order epsilon expansion formula for the specific heat exponent α in the O(n) model:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n5.  **Compute the Value:** A Python script will be used to substitute the values `d=3`, `d_c=4`, `n=1` into the formula and calculate the final value of α, printing out each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# In the context of renormalization group theory, we calculate the specific heat\n# scaling exponent alpha (α) for a system in d=3 using the epsilon expansion.\n\n# 1.
