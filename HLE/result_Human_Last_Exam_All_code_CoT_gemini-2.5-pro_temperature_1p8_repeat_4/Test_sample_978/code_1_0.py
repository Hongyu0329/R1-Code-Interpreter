    # Analysis of Mark's incident (Pool Damage)
    # Mark was negligent while working for Evergreen.
    # Therefore, Mark is liable.
    # Evergreen is vicariously liable for its employee's actions.
    # Conclusion 1: Evergreen and Mark are jointly and severally liable for the pool damage.

    # Analysis of Lincoln's incident (Car Damage)
    # Lincoln was negligent by blowing rocks towards a car. The amount of damage does not negate liability.
    # Therefore, Lincoln is liable.
    # Evergreen is vicariously liable for its employee's actions.
    # Conclusion 2: Evergreen and Lincoln are jointly and severally liable for the car damage.

    # Evaluating the answer choices based on the conclusions:
    # A is incorrect because the neighbours are not liable and Evergreen is liable for Lincoln's actions.
    # B is incorrect because liability is for separate incidents, not all damage collectively.
    # C is incorrect because Evergreen is also liable for Lincoln's actions.
    # D is incorrect because even minimal damage can attract liability.
    # E is correct as it states liability for each incident separately and correctly applies vicarious liability.
