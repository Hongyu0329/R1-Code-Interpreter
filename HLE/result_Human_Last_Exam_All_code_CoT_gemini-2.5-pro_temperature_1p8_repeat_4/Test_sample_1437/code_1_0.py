# The Lindhard polarization function, Pi(q, w), describes the response of an electron gas.
# In the static (w=0) and long-wavelength (q->0) limit, it has a simple, fundamental value.
#
# Through a derivation using linear response theory at absolute zero temperature,
# it can be shown that the Lindhard function is equal to the negative of the
# density of states (including spin) at the Fermi energy, g(E_F).
#
# The final equation is:
# Pi(q=0, w=0) = -g(E_F)
#
# To answer the question for a single numerical value, we consider the universal dimensionless
# ratio of the Lindhard function to the density of states.
#
# Equation for the ratio: Pi(q=0, w=0) / g(E_F) = -1
#
# The only numerical value in this final equation is -1.
