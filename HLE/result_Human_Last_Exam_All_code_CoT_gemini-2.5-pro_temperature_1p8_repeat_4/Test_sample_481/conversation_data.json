    "My plan is to first identify the numerical imprints on Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules. Based on drug databases, the 10mg capsule is often imprinted with the number 3105, and the 20mg capsule with 3106.\n\nNext, I will write a Python script to compare these two numbers digit by digit. The script will store the two imprints, iterate through their digits, and identify which ones are different. Finally, it will print the full imprint for each capsule with spaces between the digits and then state the specific numbers that differ between the two.\n\n```python\ndef find_imprint_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the differing numbers on two Teva fluoxetine capsules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Numerical imprints for Teva fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules\n    imprint_10mg = \"3105\"\n    imprint_20mg = \"3106\"\n\n    diff_10mg_list = []\n    diff_20mg_list = []\n\n    # Compare the imprints digit by digit\n    # Assuming imprints are the same length\n    for i in range(len(imprint_10mg)):\n        if imprint_10mg[i] != imprint_20mg[i]:\n            diff_10mg_list.append(imprint_10mg[i])\n            diff_20mg_list.append(imprint_20mg[i])\n\n    # Format the imprints with spaces for the final output \"equation\"\n    spaced_imprint_10mg = \" \".join(imprint_10mg)\n    spaced_imprint_20mg = \" \".join(imprint_20mg)\n\n    print(f\"The number on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is: {spaced_imprint_10mg}\")\n    print(f\"The number on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is: {spaced_imprint_20mg}\")\n    \n    if diff_10mg_list:\n        print(\"\\nThe different numbers are:\")\n        print(f\"From the 10mg capsule: {', '.join(diff_10mg_list)}\")\n        print(f\"From the 20mg capsule: {', '.join(diff_20mg_list)}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nThe numerical imprints are identical.\")\n\nfind_imprint_differences()\n\n```\n<<<5 and 6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
