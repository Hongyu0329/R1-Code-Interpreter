    "To find the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the topological rules that govern these diagrams. I will provide a Python script that walks through the logic step-by-step and calculates the answer.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Introduce the key formulas:** There are two main formulas we need.\n    *   The first relates the number of loops ($L$), internal lines ($I$), and vertices ($V$): $L = I - V + 1$.\n    *   The second relates the properties of the vertices to the lines. For a $\\phi^n$ theory (where each vertex connects $n$ lines), this formula is $n \\cdot V = 2 \\cdot I + E$, where $E$ is the number of external lines.\n2.  **Set up the equations:** We are given that the diagram is \"two-loop\", so $L=2$. We can substitute this into the first formula to get a direct relationship between $I$ and $V$.\n3.  **Solve for V:** We will combine the two formulas to derive a single equation for the number of vertices, $V$, in terms of the theory type ($n$) and the number of external lines ($E$).\n4.  **Find the minimum V:** To find the minimum possible number of vertices, we will test the simplest valid theories (e.g., $\\phi^3$, $\\phi^4$) and the simplest diagrams (those with the minimum number of external lines, $E=0$). The lowest integer result for $V$ will be our answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop\n    Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of loops is given.\n    L = 2\n\n    print(\"To determine the minimum number of vertices, we use topological relations from graph theory applied to Feynman diagrams.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Relate loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V).\")\n    print(\"The formula is: L = I - V + 1\")\n    print(f\"For a two-loop diagram, we have L = {L}.
