    "My plan is to solve this riddle by breaking it down into its constituent clues and resolving the apparent contradiction between them.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Vonnegut Quote:** The quote \"looks like a porcupine in all the pictures\" is from Kurt Vonnegut's novel *Breakfast of Champions*. In the book, this description explicitly refers to the German composer **Johannes Brahms**, who was famous for his very large, bushy beard and hair.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Name Constraint:** The riddle requires a two-word name where both words begin with the same letter (alliteration).\n\n3.  **Identify the Conflict:** The man in the quote is Johannes Brahms, but his name ('J' and 'B') does not fit the alliteration rule. This means the quote is a clue to the *type* of person and their appearance, rather than their exact identity.\n\n4.  **Find the Solution:** I need to find another famous composer who fits the \"porcupine\" look and has an alliterative name. The Hungarian composer **Béla Bartók** is a perfect fit. He was known for his short, spiky hair, and his name, \"Béla Bartók\", satisfies the alliteration requirement.\n\nTherefore, the riddle uses a quote about Brahms to point you toward Bartók. I will now write a Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\n# The riddle uses a quote from Kurt Vonnegut that describes the composer Johannes Brahms.\n# Brahms's appearance fits the \"porcupine\" description, but his name does not start with the same letter.\n# The riddle is a bit of a trick, pointing to another famous composer known for spiky hair\n# whose name *does* meet the alliterative requirement.\n\nfirst_name = \"Béla\"\nlast_name = \"Bartók\"\n\n# Print the name that satisfies all the riddle's conditions.\nprint(f\"The name of the man is: {first_name} {last_name}\")\n```\n<<<Béla Bartók>>>"
