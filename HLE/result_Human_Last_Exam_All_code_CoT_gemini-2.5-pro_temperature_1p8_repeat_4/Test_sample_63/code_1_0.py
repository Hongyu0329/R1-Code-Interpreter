# The riddle uses a quote from Kurt Vonnegut that describes the composer Johannes Brahms.
# Brahms's appearance fits the "porcupine" description, but his name does not start with the same letter.
# The riddle is a bit of a trick, pointing to another famous composer known for spiky hair
# whose name *does* meet the alliterative requirement.

first_name = "Béla"
last_name = "Bartók"

# Print the name that satisfies all the riddle's conditions.
print(f"The name of the man is: {first_name} {last_name}")
