    "This is a factual question about a person's identity and public record. A script cannot browse the web to find such an event. Therefore, the best approach is to provide a script that prints the known information.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Acknowledge that \"Azikiwe\" is part of Goodluck Jonathan's full birth name: Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n2.  State that he is publicly and officially known as Goodluck Jonathan.\n3.  Clarify that there is no public record of a specific event or year where he began to identify himself by the name \"Azikiwe\" as it was already one of his given names.\n4.  Create a Python script that prints this explanation to the user.\n\n```python\ndef get_answer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the user's question about Goodluck Jonathan.\n    The question is based on a false premise, as there was no specific event or year\n    where he began identifying as 'Azikiwe'. It is part of his birth name.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"There is no public record of a specific year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan started to publicly identify himself as 'Azikiwe'. 'Azikiwe' is one of his given names from birth.
