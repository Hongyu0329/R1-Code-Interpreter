    Calculates the number of involutions in PSL(3,9).

    For PSL(n,q), the order of the center of SL(n,q) is d = gcd(n, q-1).
    For PSL(3,9), n=3, q=9. So, d = gcd(3, 9-1) = gcd(3, 8) = 1.
    This means the center is trivial, and PSL(3,9) is isomorphic to SL(3,9).

    Involutions in SL(3,9) are non-identity matrices A where A^2 = I.
    The determinant of an involution A must be 1. The eigenvalues of A are +1 or -1.
    If k is the number of -1 eigenvalues, det(A) = (-1)^k.
    For det(A)=1, k must be even.
    For a 3x3 matrix, the number of non-identity involutions requires k=2.

    The number of such matrices is given by the formula: q^(k*(n-k)) * [n, k]_q
    where [n, k]_q is the Gaussian binomial coefficient.
    For n=3, k=2, q=9:
    [3, 2]_9 = (q^3 - 1)/(q - 1) = (9^3 - 1)/(9 - 1) = 728/8 = 91.
