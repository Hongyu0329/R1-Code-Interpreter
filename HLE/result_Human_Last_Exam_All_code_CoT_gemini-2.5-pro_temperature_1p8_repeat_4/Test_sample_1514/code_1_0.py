    This script explains the solution to the given topology problem.
    The number of topologically distinct compactifications of the ray [0,1)
    with a remainder X is equal to the number of orbits of non-empty
    subcontinua of X under the action of the homeomorphism group of X.
    Our goal is to find the minimum possible value for this number.
    """

    # Step 1: Establish a lower bound.
    # Any valid space X must be a nondegenerate, locally-connected, compact metric space.
    # This implies X is a continuum.
    # Any such continuum X must contain at least three non-homeomorphic types of subcontinua:
    # 1. A singleton point, {p}.
    # 2. The space X itself.
    # 3. A proper non-degenerate subcontinuum, which will be an arc since X is path-connected.
    # These three types are topologically distinct and must belong to different orbits.
    # For example, a point has 0 dimensions, an arc has 1 dimension with 2 endpoints,
    # and X itself may be an arc, or a circle (1D, no endpoints), etc.
    # This means there must be at least 3 orbits.
    lower_bound = 3
    print(f"A lower bound on the number of orbits, and thus compactifications, is {lower_bound}.")

    # Step 2: Provide an example X that meets this lower bound.
    # Let's consider the circle, X = S^1. It satisfies all the required properties.
    # The subcontinua of a circle are of three types:
    # 1. Single points.
    # 2. Proper closed arcs.
    # 3. The entire circle S^1.

    # Step 3: Count the orbits for X = S^1.
    # We consider the action of the group of all homeomorphisms of S^1 onto itself.
    # Orbit 1 (Points): The circle is homogeneous, meaning any point can be mapped to any other point.
    # Thus, all singleton subcontinua form a single orbit.
    singleton_orbits = 1
    # Orbit 2 (Arcs): Any proper arc on the circle can be mapped to any other proper arc by a
    # homeomorphism (e.g., by stretching/shrinking and rotating). So, all proper arcs form a single orbit.
    arc_orbits = 1
    # Orbit 3 (The whole space): The entire circle S^1 can only be mapped to itself,
    # forming a distinct orbit.
    s1_orbits = 1

    # The total number of orbits is the sum.
    total_orbits_for_s1 = singleton_orbits + arc_orbits + s1_orbits
    print(f"For X = S^1, the number of distinct orbits of subcontinua is {total_orbits_for_s1}.")

    # Step 4: Final Conclusion.
    # The minimum number of compactifications is at least 3.
    # We have found a space, S^1, for which the number is exactly 3.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible number is 3.

    smallest_number = 3
    print("\nThe final equation is:")
    print(f"Smallest number = {singleton_orbits} (orbit of points) + {arc_orbits} (orbit of arcs) + {s1_orbits} (orbit of the whole space) = {smallest_number}")
