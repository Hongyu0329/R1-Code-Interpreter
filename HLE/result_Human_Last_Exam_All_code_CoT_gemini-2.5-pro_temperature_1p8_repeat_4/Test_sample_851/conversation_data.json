    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan followed by the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define Crystal Properties**: First, I will establish the criteria for a crystal class to be considered:\n    *   **Optically Active**: For the purposes of this question, we must consider the broader definition of optical activity, known as gyrotropy. While it is most commonly associated with the 11 **chiral** crystal classes (those without a mirror plane or inversion center), four specific **achiral** classes (`m`, `mm2`, `-4`, `-42m`) also permit gyrotropy, typically observable only when light propagates along specific directions.\n    *   **Achiral**: A crystal class is achiral if it possesses any rotoinversion axes, which include a center of inversion (`-1`) or a mirror plane (`m`).\n    *   **Non-Polar**: A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar direction (a direction not equivalent to its opposite by any symmetry operation). The 10 polar classes are `1`, `2`, `m`, `mm2`, `3`, `3m`, `4`, `4mm`, and `6`, `6mm`. All other classes are non-polar.\n\n2.  **Filter the Classes**: The goal is to find the crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions: they must be achiral, non-polar, AND optically active (gyrotropic).\n\n3.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script to perform this filtering process automatically.\n    *   A dictionary will be created to store the properties (chirality, polarity, and gyrotropy) for each of the 32 crystallographic point groups.\n    *   The script will loop through this data, check each class against the three required properties, and collect the names of the classes that match.\n    *   Finally, the script will print the resulting list of crystal classes.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active (gyrotropic).\n\n    This function classifies the 32 crystallographic point groups based on three properties:\n    1. Chirality: Whether a class lacks rotoinversion axes (like mirror planes or inversion centers).\n       'is_chiral' is True for chiral classes.\n    2. Polarity: Whether a class has a unique polar axis.\n       'is_polar' is True for polar classes.\n    3. Optical Activity (Gyrotropy): Whether the symmetry allows for a non-zero gyrotropy tensor.\n       This is true for all 11 chiral classes plus four specific achiral classes: m, mm2, -4, -42m.\n       'is_optically_active' is True for these classes.\n\n    The function then filters for classes that are:\n    - Achiral (NOT is_chiral)\n    - Non-polar (NOT is_polar)\n    - Optically Active (is_optically_active)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    crystal_classes_info = {\n        # Hermann-Mauguin Symbol: [is_chiral, is_polar, is_optically_active]\n        # Triclinic\n        '1':    [True,  True,  True],\n        '-1':   [False, False, False],\n        # Monoclinic\n        '2':    [True,  True,  True],\n        'm':    [False, True,  True],  # Achiral but gyrotropic\n        '2/m':  [False, False, False],\n        # Orthorhombic\n        '222':  [True,  False, True],\n        'mm2':  [False, True,  True],  # Achiral but gyrotropic\n        'mmm':  [False, False, False],\n        # Tetragonal\n        '4':    [True,  True,  True],\n        '-4':   [False, False, True],  # Achiral but gyrotropic\n        '4/m':  [False, False, False],\n        '422':  [True,  False, True],\n        '4mm':  [False, True,  False],\n        '-42m': [False, False, True],  # Achiral but gyrotropic\n        '4/mmm':[False, False, False],\n        # Trigonal\n        '3':    [True,  True,  True],\n        '-3':   [False, False, False],\n        '32':   [True,  False, True],\n        '3m':   [False, True,  False],\n        '-3m':  [False, False, False],\n        # Hexagonal\n        '6':    [True,  True,  True],\n        '-6':   [False, False, False],\n        '6/m':  [False, False, False],\n        '622':  [True,  False, True],\n        '6mm':  [False, True,  False],\n        '-62m': [False, False, False],\n        '6/mmm':[False, False, False],\n        # Cubic\n        '23':   [True,  False, True],\n        'm-3':  [False, False, False],\n        '432':  [True,  False, True],\n        '-43m': [False, False, False],\n        'm-3m': [False, False, False]\n    }\n\n    matching_classes = []\n    print(\"Analyzing 32 crystal classes based on the following criteria:\")\n    print(\"1.
