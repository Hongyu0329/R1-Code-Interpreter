    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of a specific order in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a result from Lie algebra known as Witt's formula. This formula gives the number of linearly independent Lie polynomials of a given degree, which corresponds directly to the number of terms (and thus nonzero coefficients) at that order in the BCH series.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Witt's Formula**: The number of basic commutators of degree `n` in `k` generators, denoted `L_n(k)`, is given by:\n    `L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the degree (the order, which is 10 in this case).\n    *   `k` is the number of generators (which is 2, for X and Y).\n    *   The sum `Σ` is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n    *   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Determine Parameters**:\n    *   `n = 10`\n    *   `k = 2`\n\n3.  **Find Divisors**: The positive divisors `d` of `n=10` are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Sum**: We will compute each term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)` for each divisor and sum them up.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We will divide the total sum by `n=10` to get the final answer.\n\nThe Python script below will automate this process, including helper functions to find divisors and compute the Möbius function, and will print each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num.\n    e.g., get_prime_factorization(12) -> {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Mobius function μ(n).\n    μ(n) = 1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    μ(n) = -1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    μ(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    # If n has a squared prime factor, μ(n) = 0\n    for p in prime_factors:\n        if prime_factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    # Otherwise, (-1)^(number of distinct prime factors)\n    return (-1) ** len(prime_factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_coefficients():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero BCH coefficients for a given order and number of generators.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # The order of the expansion\n    k = 2   # The number of generators (e.g., X and Y)\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero coefficients of order n={n} in the BCH expansion for k={k} generators.\")\n    print(\"Using Witt's formula: L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)\\n\")\n    \n    divisors_of_n = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"The divisors of n={n} are: {divisors_of_n}\")\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    sum_parts = []\n    \n    for d in divisors_of_n:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        exponent = n // d\n        term_value = mu_d * (k ** exponent)\n        total_sum += term_value\n        sum_parts.append(f\"(μ({d})) * {k}^({n}/{d})\")\n\n    # Displaying the symbolic formula\n    full_formula = f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * [ {' + '.join(sum_parts)} ]\"\n    print(f\"\\nFormula breakdown:\\n{full_formula}\")\n\n    # Displaying the intermediate values\n    value_parts = []\n    for d in divisors_of_n:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        exponent = n // d\n        base_val = k ** exponent\n        value_parts.append(f\"({mu_d})*({base_val})\")\n\n    full_values = f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * [ {' + '.join(value_parts)} ]\"\n    print(f\"\\nPlugging in the numbers:\\n{full_values}\")\n\n    # Displaying the final calculation\n    final_calc_str = f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * [ {total_sum} ]\"\n    print(f\"\\nCalculating the sum:\\n{final_calc_str}\")\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n    print(f\"\\nFinal result: L_{n}({k}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve_bch_coefficients()\n<<<99>>>\n```"
