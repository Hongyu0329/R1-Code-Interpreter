    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the task.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The system is a gas of light quanta (photons) in a volume `V` at temperature `T`. Photons are bosons, so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. A key property of a photon gas is that the number of photons is not conserved, which implies their chemical potential is zero.\n2.  **Apply Statistical Mechanics Principles:** The equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the macroscopic configuration with the highest number of microscopic arrangements (microstates). This is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy `S` subject to physical constraints.\n3.  **Connect to Large Deviation Theory:** The principle of maximizing entropy is underpinned by large deviation theory. Sanov's theorem, for instance, tells us that for a large system, the probability of observing a macroscopic state (like a particular energy distribution) that deviates from the most probable (maximum entropy) state is exponentially small. Therefore, the equilibrium values we seek are those derived from this most probable distribution.\n4.  **Derive the Distribution:** The process of maximizing entropy `S` for bosons, subject to a constant total energy `U`, leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution function for the average occupation number of a state with energy `ε`. For photons (with zero chemical potential), this is:\n    `f(ε) = 1 / (exp(ε / (k_B*T)) - 1)`\n5.  **Calculate Mean Energy (U):**\n    *   The total energy `U` is found by summing the energy of all possible states, weighted by their occupation. This sum is replaced by an integral over the continuous energy spectrum.\n    *   `U = ∫ ε * f(ε) * g(ε) dε`, where `g(ε)` is the density of states for photons.\n    *   For photons in a 3D volume `V`, `g(ε) = (V * ε^2) / (π^2 * ħ^3 * c^3)`.\n    *   Solving this integral yields the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy, where the numerical factor **15** arises from a standard definite integral: `∫ x^3 / (e^x - 1) dx = π^4 / 15`.\n6.  **Calculate Entropy (S):**\n    *   The entropy can be found using the thermodynamic relationship between energy `U`, Helmholtz free energy `F`, and temperature `T`: `S = (U - F) / T`.\n    *   For a photon gas, it can be shown that `F = -U / 3`.\n    *   Substituting this gives `S = (U - (-U/3)) / T = 4U / (3T)`.\n    *   By substituting the derived expression for `U`, we find the final equation for `S`, which will contain the numerical factor **45** (from `3 * 15`).\n7.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a Python script to present these final, derived formulas for `U` and `S` in a clear format, ensuring all numerical constants from the derivation are explicitly included in the output.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_photon_gas_equations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and displays the equilibrium values for mean energy (U) and entropy (S)\n    for a photon gas (Bose case) based on statistical mechanics, which is underpinned\n    by large deviation principles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Variable Definitions for the equations ---\n    # These are symbolic representations for the final output.\n    symbols = {\n        'U': 'U', # Mean Energy\n        'S': 'S', # Entropy\n        'V': 'V', # Volume\n        'T': 'T', # Temperature\n        'k_B': 'k_B', # Boltzmann constant\n        'hbar': 'ħ',  # Reduced Planck constant (h / 2π)\n        'c': 'c',   # Speed of light in vacuum\n        'pi': 'π'    # Mathematical constant pi\n    }\n\n    # --- Mean Energy (U) Derivation ---\n    # The derivation involves integrating ε * g(ε) / (exp(ε/(k_B*T)) - 1) from 0 to infinity.\n    # The solution to the dimensionless part of the integral, ∫x^3/(e^x-1)dx, is π^4/15.\n    energy_numerator = f\"{symbols['pi']}^2 * {symbols['V']} * {symbols['k_B']}^4 * {symbols['T']}^4\"\n    energy_denominator_num = 15\n    energy_denominator = f\"{energy_denominator_num} * {symbols['hbar']}^3 * {symbols['c']}^3\"\n    \n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Mean Energy (U) for a Photon Gas ---\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium mean energy is derived by integrating the energy contribution of all states,\")\n    print(\"weighted by the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"  {symbols['U']} = ( {energy_numerator} ) / ( {energy_denominator} )\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\n> The number '{energy_denominator_num}' in the denominator originates from the solution to the standard definite integral\")\n    print(f\"  ∫[x^3 / (e^x - 1)]dx from 0 to ∞, which evaluates to π^4 / {energy_denominator_num}.\")\n\n    # --- Entropy (S) Derivation ---\n    # Derived from the thermodynamic relation S = (U - F) / T, where for a photon gas F = -U/3.\n    # This simplifies to S = 4*U / (3*T).\n    # Substituting the expression for U results in 4 / (3 * 15) = 4 / 45.\n    entropy_numerator = f\"4 * {symbols['pi']}^2 * {symbols['V']} * {symbols['k_B']}^4 * {symbols['T']}^3\"\n    entropy_denominator_num = 45 # This comes from 3 * 15 from the S = 4U/(3T) relation\n    entropy_denominator = f\"{entropy_denominator_num} * {symbols['hbar']}^3 * {symbols['c']}^3\"\n\n    print(\"\\n\\n--- Equilibrium Entropy (S) for a Photon Gas ---\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium entropy is found using the thermodynamic relation between energy and entropy.\")\n    print(\"For a photon gas, this relation is S = 4*U / (3*T).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"  {symbols['S']} = ( {entropy_numerator} ) / ( {entropy_denominator} )\")\n\n    print(f\"\\n> The number '{entropy_denominator_num}' in the denominator is the result of the factor 4/3 from the\")\n    print(f\"  thermodynamic relation multiplied by the factor 1/{energy_denominator_num} from the energy equation (3 * {energy_denominator_num} = {entropy_denominator_num}).\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the results\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    display_photon_gas_equations()\n\n```\n<<<The equilibrium equations for mean energy (U) and entropy (S) have been derived and are printed by the code.>>>"
