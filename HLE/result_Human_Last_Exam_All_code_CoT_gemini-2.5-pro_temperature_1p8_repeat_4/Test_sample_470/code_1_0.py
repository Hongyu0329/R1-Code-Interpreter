# Step 1: Define parameters from the problem
# p is the characteristic of the field F
p = 2
# D is the defect group, D = (C_2)^5. It is an elementary abelian 2-group.
# We can view D as a vector space over F_2 of dimension 5.
dim_D = 5
order_D = 2**dim_D

# E is the inertial quotient, with order 5.
# Since 5 is a prime number, E is a cyclic group E = C_5.
order_E = 5

# Step 2: Calculate l(B)
# l(B) is the number of p'-conjugacy classes of E.
# p' elements are those with order not divisible by p=2 (i.e., odd order).
# Since |E|=5 (odd), all elements of E are p'-elements.
# E is cyclic, hence abelian, so every element is its own conjugacy class.
# Thus, the number of conjugacy classes is |E|.

# Step 3: Calculate k(B)
# For a block with an abelian defect group D, k(B) is the number of orbits of E on Irr(D).
# The number of irreducible characters of D is |Irr(D)| = |D|.
num_chars_D = order_D

# The action of E on Irr(D) is analogous to its action on D.
# D is a 5-dim vector space over F_2, and E=C_5 acts on it.
# This action must be non-trivial, otherwise E itself would be trivial.
# Over F_2, the polynomial x^5 - 1 factors as (x-1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1).
# These factors correspond to the irreducible representations of C_5 over F_2:
# W0: A 1-dimensional trivial module.
# W1: A 4-dimensional simple module.
# Since D is 5-dimensional, its decomposition into irreducible F_2[E]-modules must be D = W0 + W1.

# The number of orbits is the sum of orbits of size 1 and size 5.
# Orbits of size 1 correspond to characters fixed by all of E.
# The space of fixed characters corresponds to the trivial submodule W0.
# The dimension of this submodule is 1.
dim_fixed_space = 1
# The number of fixed characters is 2^dim_fixed_space.
num_fixed_chars = 2**dim_fixed_space
num_orbits_size_1 = num_fixed_chars

# The remaining characters are in non-trivial orbits.
num_moving_chars = num_chars_D - num_fixed_chars
# Since |E|=5 is prime, all non-trivial orbits must have size 5.
num_orbits_size_5 = num_moving_chars // order_E

# Total number of orbits is k(B).
k_B = num_orbits_size_1 + num_orbits_size_5

print(f"Calculating k(B):")
print(f"k(B) is the number of orbits of E on Irr(D).")
print(f"The action of E on D (a 5-dim space over F_2) decomposes it into a 1-dim trivial module and a 4-dim simple module.")
print(f"Number of characters fixed by E is 2^{dim_fixed_space} = {num_fixed_chars}. These form {num_orbits_size_1} orbits of size 1.")
print(f"Number of remaining characters is {num_chars_D} - {num_fixed_chars} = {num_moving_chars}.")
print(f"These form orbits of size |E|=5. Number of such orbits = {num_moving_chars} / {order_E} = {num_orbits_size_5}.")
print(f"Total number of orbits, k(B) = {num_orbits_size_1} + {num_orbits_size_5} = {k_B}.\n")
